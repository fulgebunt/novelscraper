    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1. The Player Who Can\u2019t Level Up (1)\u201cSqueeeakk!\u201d The green goblin shrieked as it went down.\u201cNice work, everyone.\u201d\u201cThank you for your work, Guide.\u201d\u201cGood job!\u201d\u201cKilling goblins is pretty easy now!\u201dThe players chatted as they put away their weapons. The man addressed as \u201cGuide\u201d was the last player to put his sword away.\u201cDid everyone level up?\u201d the guide asked.\u201cYes,\u201d answered one of the players.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even kill that many, but we\u2019ve already leveled up,\u201d added another one from the group.\u201cIt\u2019s because you level up quicker in the beginner levels.\u201d The guide turned around and continued, \u201cThen, we will climb the second floor tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the entrance in the morning.\u201d The guide said his goodbyes and left first. The remaining players were still packing their stuff; when he was out of earshot, they began talking in hushed tones.\u201cSo, is that guy really that famous?\u201d\u201cTotally.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard of him too!\u201dThe goblin corpse had disappeared by now, leaving a murky crystal in its place. One of the players picked it up and continued, \u201cI\u2019m not completely sure about it, but rumor has it that he can\u2019t level up.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked the curious one in the group.\u201cHe\u2019s the player who can\u2019t level up. I know there isn\u2019t a numerical ranking system; if there were, he would be dead last, no doubt.\u201d\u201cReally? He can\u2019t level up?\u201d\u201cYes. Another rumor is that he possesses a unique ability. However, if that were true, what\u2019s he doing helping newbies like us?\u201d said the crystal-carrying player to no one in particular.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Lost in thought, the group of newbie players nodded and looked in the direction in which the guide left.***Gi-Gyu, the guide who left the hunting ground alone, was busy checking his schedule. His guiding appointments were done for the day, which meant it was time for him to hunt.Gi-Gyu watched the forest as he walked by. Like clockwork, he had been following the exact same routine for the last five years. Every day, he would spend a chunk of his time guiding people around the Tower; then, he would use what\u2019s left of his day for hunting. This had been his everyday routine ever since he entered the Tower as a player.Gi-Gyu headed toward his regular hunting ground to avoid the other players. After wandering around the Tower for five years, he found a secluded corner where he could hunt in peace. For now, no one seemed to be aware of this spot; it was his secret spot.This secret spot had a unique feature of sorts\u2014a goblin would spawn here every day.Today\u2019s goblin was looking around, waiting for its prey.\u201cKrrrk? Krrrk?\u201dSchwing!Gi-Gyu unsheathed his sword from his waist and trod quietly toward it. Every step he took was filled with caution.\u2018A well-placed strike to the goblin\u2019s vulnerable spot when it\u2019s unaware should be enough to kill it. This should be an easy hunt.\u2019\u201cSqueeakk!\u201d However, the goblin spotted Gi-Gyu and screeched.\u201cTsk.\u201dToday\u2019s hunt turned out to be another problematic one. His surprise attack succeeded at odd times, but times like those were sporadic. Consequently, most of his hunts turned out to be problematic.\u201cSqueeakk!\u201dDodging the spear, Gi-Gyu jumped toward the goblin.***After a long one-hour hunt, Gi-Gyu was drained. He had been hunting goblins in the same place for five years, so he should\u2019ve been getting faster at it. But even now, it still took him over an hour to kill a single goblin.Gi-Gyu exercised diligently in the hope of improving his stamina. However, he failed to build even a single muscle, let alone gain a stamina point.When the Tower and the Gate appeared in this world, a handful of people awakened as \u201cplayers.\u201d Those who obtained unlimited potential ascended the Tower and closed the Gate, creating their own powerful group.Now, the world was so dependent on the players that it could not survive without them. A player was an admired hero and a symbol of wealth since the beings called players literally controlled the world economy. So, when Gi-Gyu awakened as a player, he was ecstatic.\u201cStatus screen.\u201d Lying on the ground, Gi-Gyu called up his status screen.[Level 1][Unique Ability ???]He was still at Level 1, and his unique ability was still something unknown. Looking at the screen, Gi-Gyu frowned bitterly.A unique ability was something that only a select few called the Chosen Ones could acquire. Usually, this unique ability awakened into a special skill. Gi-Gyu was one of those Chosen Ones, but the problem was, he didn\u2019t know what his ability was. His unique ability remained a bunch of question marks despite his best efforts. After Kim Gi-Gyu became a player with a unique ability, he believed he had an easy life ahead of him. But of course, the reality wasn\u2019t what he had expected.\u201cWho knew there could be a player like me?!\u201d Gi-Gyu grumbled to himself. He was a player with a unique ability, one of the Chosen Ones. However, his unique ability was the great unknown, he couldn\u2019t level up, and he was as strong as an average human at best. All these factors resulted in Gi-Gyu being an unprecedented player.***The Gate that led to the Tower was located in the Seoul branch of the Player Association.\u201cThis is your pay for the day.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dGi-Gyu received three 50,000 won bills. For Gi-Gyu, this was a lot of money. Gi-Gyu worked as a tutorial guide for the novice players in the Tower. His job was to appraise the newly awakened players about the Tower, the other players, and the battles. He accompanied them from the first to the fourth floors, called the tutorial floors.Gi-Gyu complained, \u201cAhh\u2026 Each day I\u2019m getting fewer customers than the last.\u201dRecently, the number of novice players requesting a tutorial guide has decreased. This was because the guilds offered their own guides in hopes of seducing novice players into their guilds. The new players, in turn, preferred the guides from the guilds they planned on joining rather than the association\u2019s guides. Such preference guaranteed that they could hunt with the same guides even after the tutorial levels.Unfortunately, this meant less work for Gi-Gyu. He missed the days when he made a lucrative living as an association guide.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. His income was progressively decreasing, and his level refused to go up. He had to make much more than what he was making if he wanted to continue paying for his mother\u2019s hospital bills, the rent, and his family\u2019s living expenses.\u201cAt this rate, I might have to get a part-time job,\u201d Gi-Gyu lamented. Perhaps he needed to give up his hunting time and find a part-time job. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to live as a player anymore if it came to that.Gi-Gyu headed toward the payment office nearby. Whenever a monster was killed in the Tower or at the Gate, a crystal appeared in its place. A player\u2019s primary income came from exchanging these crystals for money at the payment office.\u201cThat\u2019ll be 20,000 won.\u201dSince all Gi-Gyu brought was a single small crystal he got from killing the goblin, his pay was meager. Putting away the money in his pocket, Gi-Gyu turned around. It was time to go home.***Gi-Gyu\u2019s home was located atop a shabby apartment complex; it was an even shabbier rooftop attic. He opened the door and entered with a big smile.\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d Gi-Gyu greeted.\u201cWelcome back, Gi-Gyu.\u201d His mother returned the greeting.\u201cHow are you feeling today, Mother?\u201d he asked.\u201cWelcome home,\u201d chirped in his younger sister, Yoo-Jung.In this tiny place\u2019s corner was a hospital bed where Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother rested. A particularly nasty accident torpefied her lower body, leaving her immotile.\u201cOppa[1], you haven\u2019t had dinner yet, right? I\u2019ll make you something,\u201d Yoo-Jung offered.\u201cOkay,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered as he walked up to his mother and began massaging her. And this was his everyday routine after getting out of work and returning home. His mother was paralyzed from a spinal injury, and she needed frequent massages to prevent further muscle stiffening.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gi-Gyu,\u201d his mother apologized suddenly.\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry about, Mother,\u201d Gi-Gyu consoled her.Gi-Gyu\u2019s father passed away from an accident when he was young. That same accident was also responsible for his mother\u2019s spinal injury. After his father\u2019s death, Gi-Gyu had to mature overnight to care for his mother and younger sister. When Gi-Gyu was still at an innocent young age, he was suddenly burdened with the responsibility of being the only breadwinner in his family.He learned early on the cruelty of capitalism. He lived in a world where medical treatments were only for those with money, so Gi-Gyu quit school and began working. He spent a better part of his early years working odd jobs, taking on any and all jobs he could find. Just when he made peace with the fact that he would spend the rest of his life delivering food and working part-time jobs full-time, he awakened as a player.\u2018What an unfair world.\u2019Gi-Gyu frowned as he remembered his past. Meanwhile, he didn\u2019t forget to keep his hands busy. Using the wet towel Yoo-Jung had brought him earlier, he washed his mother\u2019s back.\u201cOppa, dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d Yoo-Jung called out.\u201cGo ahead and eat, Son. You must be so tired,\u201d his mother urged.\u201cOkay,\u201d Gi-Gyu responded.Yoo-Jung set the metal table with rice, kimchi, and a fried egg.\u201cWhere did you get the egg from?\u201d\u201cThe chicken we\u2019re raising at school laid some, so I brought them home. Hehe!\u201d Yoo-Jung answered with a bright laugh, making Gi-Gyu\u2019s fatigue melt away.\u201cThanks. It looks delicious,\u201d said Gi-Gyu, showing his appreciation.\u201cHurry up and eat.\u201dBeep!He sat down at the table and turned on the old TV. After all these years, this had become a ritual of sorts. Every night, he would watch the Player Channel while eating dinner since it was the only time he could update himself on the daily trivia regarding the other players and the world.-Angela Guild announced its plan to advance to the 75th floor recently.-Indeed. They claimed they\u2019d conquer the 75th floor, which hasn\u2019t been cleared so far.-Hmm\u2026Angela Guild was a multinational guild that ranked amongst the top three in the world. It was led by a Korean guild master, Lee Sun-Ho. He was a high ranker and a Chosen one, someone with a unique ability. Surprisingly, he was Gi-Gyu\u2019s age but was already deemed the strongest by the global population.-They have announced that they\u2019ll hold a departing ceremony at the Gate in Seoul tomorrow morning.-Wow, what an event!-Indeed. Our hero is a subject of great pride for Koreans worldwide.-I wish him success in conquering the 75th floor.-What\u2019s our next story?-Our next story is related to the Gate and might shock you all. There have been sightings of an S-Class Gate in the US!-Pardon?!One of the announcers shouted in shock.In the entire history of mankind, there hadn\u2019t been a single gate that could triumph over the difficulty that an S-Class Gate posed. Even closing one S-Class Gate required at least ten high rankers.-Currently, the US government plans on making an official request for help to the Korean Player Association. It has promised a hefty reward for every participating player.-Along with Angela Guild\u2019s announcement, such news must be causing incredible excitement among the players.-Yes, I agree.Beep!Gi-Gyu turned off the TV. These were important news, but they didn\u2019t concern him.\u201cI sent the fee for your class trip, so have fun, Yoo-Jung,\u201d Gi-Gyu said.\u201cW\u2026what?\u201d It came as a surprise to Yoo-Jung.When Yoo-Jung looked at him in confusion, Gi-Gyu added, \u201cMother\u2019s sleeping, so let\u2019s talk quietly. You have a class trip tomorrow, right? Why didn\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Yoo-Jung hesitated.\u201cIs it because I\u2019m not making enough money?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cWhy would you say that?!\u201d Yoo-Jung yelled angrily. When Gi-Gyu saw his mother rustle in her bed, he said to his sister, \u201cLet\u2019s talk outside.\u201d\u201cO-okay.\u201d Yoo-Jung agreed. Gi-Gyu took her out to the roof, and they both sat down on small chairs.\u201cI know why you didn\u2019t tell me, but you still should have. It\u2019s an important class trip, after all,\u201d Gi-Gyu continued the interrupted conversation.\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t have to go. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Yoo-Jung tried to explain.Gi-Gyu shook his head and added, \u201cI never got to do those things when I was young. Yoo-Jung, I want you to have a better life. I want to give you a chance to try everything. It\u2019s hard right now, but I will eventually pay back our family debt. I\u2019ve also already begun saving for your university tuition\u2014\u201d\u201cBut the university\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to go. If you want to try something else, just know that you have my complete support and I\u2019ll help you to the best of my ability. That\u2019s my duty as your older brother.\u201dYoo-Jung lowered her face quietly.\u201cDo you understand, Yoo-Jung?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cI called for an in-house nurse for the next three days, so you can enjoy your trip. Don\u2019t worry about Mother.\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu handed her all the money he earned from the crystal and the day\u2019s guiding work.\u201cN-no! I don\u2019t need the money\u2026\u201d Yoo-Jung tried to turn it down.\u201cJust take it. Go have fun with your friends. Now, you should pack and go to bed.\u201d\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d\u201cHurry!\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dYoo-Jung went inside, and Gi-Gyu sat alone outside for a long time with a grim face.1.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2. The Player Who Can\u2019t Level Up (2)Entering the association building was a hassle during the morning rush hour. That was even more apparent today since many were here to witness the Angela Guild\u2019s departure ceremony.\u201cWe, the Angela Guild, will conquer the Tower!\u201d A guild member shouted as the audience below watched with bated breath. The entire building was filled with so many agog hunters that Gi-Gyu had to spend an eternity just to get in.\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cThere you are, Gi-Gyu.\u201d The guide department\u2019s head, Oh Tae-Shik greeted him.Gi-Gyu greeted him as well and sat down. After settling down, he exchanged pleasantries with the other hunters present in the room.\u201cHi, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cKim Gi-Gyu, long time no see.\u201dHyun-Shik, a short guy, and Tae-Oh, a sharp-looking man, were seated near Tae-Shik.\u201cOh, hey.\u201d Gi-Gyu gave them a half-assed greeting.Usually, the position of being an association guide was temporary. Players often took this as a part-time gig until they reached a certain level. It was certainly not a long-term career for most. This was why all the other guides quit not long after starting \u00a0the job. Of course, this was the case for everyone except Gi-Gyu.Tae-Oh and Hyun-Shik were newbie guides . And since newbie guides never tarried in this place, Gi-Gyu never took the time to befriend them.\u201cAre you leaving right now?\u201d Tae-Shik asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cYes, I\u2019m taking my group from yesterday to the second floor,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cOh, haven\u2019t you heard? Those customers asked for a new guide; this will be your last trip with them. Someone new will accompany them from tomorrow,\u201d informed Tae-Shik.\u201cWhy?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked curiously.Everyone was enjoying themselves yesterday, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t make any mistakes, and the Players followed his instructions very well, so why indeed.\u201cThey said they couldn\u2019t trust you. I think they must\u2019ve heard the rumor,\u201d Tae-Shik explained.\u201cOh...\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly.That rumor had cost Gi-Gyu many customers recently. He didn\u2019t know who began such a rumor, but there was nothing much he could do about it, even if he knew. After all, the rumor was true.\u201cTae-Oh will be taking over after today. Still,\u00a0break\u00a0a leg today!\u201d Tae-Shik encouraged Gi-Gyu.On the other hand, Tae-Oh apologized to Gi-Gyu with a blank face, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNah. There\u2019s nothing you need to be sorry about.\u201d\u201cBut I still feel like I\u2019m stealing your customers, so I feel bad,\u201d Tae-Oh answered emotionlessly. If a stranger saw this interaction, they would\u2019ve thought that Tae-Oh was being sarcastic. But, Gi-Gyu knew better.\u2018He just has a quiet personality.\u2019Tae-Oh was one of those ever stoic and honest types. Gi-Gyu knew he genuinely felt sorry for what had happened.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take my leave now. See you guys later.\u201d It was time to meet the client Players, so Gi-Gyu stood up.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it too much. You already have new customers scheduled, so think of it as a blessing,\u201d Tae-Shik consoled Gi-Gyu.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe other guides also said their farewells, \u201cTake care, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cHave a safe hunt, Gi-Gyu.\u201dEveryone felt sorry for Gi-Gyu. They knew about his family situation, how hard he worked,\u00a0and what an upright man he was. They wanted to help him, but no amount of help could make him start leveling up. Unfortunately, there was no place in this world for a player who couldn't level up.\u201cTsk.\u201d Tae-Shik clicked his tongue in pity as he watched Gi-Gyu walk out the door.***\u201cI see everyone came early,\u201d Gi-Gyu said to the players, who were waiting for him at the designated spot. Gi-Gyu was 20 minutes early, but it seemed he was still the last one to arrive.\u201cYeah.\u00a0I was so excited about climbing the second floor that I couldn\u2019t sleep last night!\u201d one player exclaimed.\u201cMe too!\u201d another player chimed in.\u201cI bought plenty of potions just for today,\u201d the third player announced enthusiastically.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly at the players. This wasn\u2019t the first time\u00a0his customers had canceled his services. Still, Gi-Gyu announced with a gentle smile akin to a kind teacher,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe second floor is dangerous, so don\u2019t let your guard down. Everyone needs to focus,\u201d and began leading the group.\u201cOkay!\u201d The players answered with vigor.***\u201cThis is the door?\u201d\u201cIt looks just like how it was described to me.\u201d The players chatted as they stood in front of the giant clunky door.\u00a0The five stories tall steel door seemed like a haphazard build; Gi-Gyu even pushed it open with little effort.Creak.When it opened with a squeaking sound, the players admired the scene out loud. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty!\u201dThe sight withheld by those doors was indeed awe-inspiring. The starry sky inside seemed even more brilliant and lively than the one outside. It was a stark contrast to the all-blue Gate.\u201cNow, stop staring, and please get inside quickly.\u201d Gi-Gyu walked in first, followed by the other players.\u201cThis is the second floor?\u201d one of the players asked.As soon as they were inside, the scenery changed suddenly.\u00a0They found themselves amid an endless forest with mammoth trees.\u201cThe Tower is so magical,\u201d one player commented.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Tower.\u00a0Just think about how the Gate, the players, and all those other magical things appeared out of the blue. No one knows the answer to the why or the how. We are still as clueless about the Tower as we were 23 years ago when it first appeared,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.Why did the Tower suddenly appear? What about the Gates? And why did some people awaken as players? It seemed no one found the answers to these questions in the last 23 years. A rumor suggested that the truth would all be revealed when the players ascended to the higher floors, but nothing had been confirmed so far.\u201cI heard that Angela Guild will try to climb higher, so I hope they find something,\u201d\u00a0said a player filled with hope for the unknown.\u201cI\u2019m more worried about that S-Class Gate that appeared in the US,\u201d another player added.\u201cWhy should we worry about that?! If it goes down, it will be the US that goes down with it, not our country.\u201d\u201cHey, but people will still end up dying.\u201dThe players discussed the recent events loudly.\u00a0Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t much interested since they were talking about the things he already knew.\u00a0Guessing this conversation was never going to end, he began walking ahead as he explained, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m about to repeat the basic info regarding the second floor, so listen carefully. This floor houses monsters known as orcs. They look different from the goblins, but they have similar abilities.\u00a0Their combat power and speed\u2026\u201d\u201cCombat power and speed?\u201d one of the players asked.\u201cYes, the orcs have greater combat skills than the goblins, but they\u2019re slower. So, a single hit from an orc can cause fatal damage, but it will be easy to dodge,\u201d when Gi-Gyu explained. The players from the client group nodded as they followed him.***\u201cThe orcs on the second-floor use clubs instead of glaives. This will hold true until you reach the fourth floor, so get yourself acquainted with the orc\u2019s fighting style here.\u201d When Gi-Gyu gave this instruction, his students answered, \u201cYes, Sir!\u201dThud!A player\u2019s sword hit an orc\u2019s club, making it dart out of the orc\u2019s hand. Another player took this opening to stab the orc.Shink!\u201cChweek!\u201d The orc screamed.\u201cOrcs are pretty resilient, so you mustn't let your guard down\u00a0until it's completely beheaded or you\u2019re certain it\u2019s dead. An orc without its weapon can still be deadly,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.The players swung their swords one at a time at the retreating orc.\u00a0After sustaining numerous wounds, the orc collapsed, and its green blood soaked the ground underneath.\u201cYay! I leveled up,\u201d a player exclaimed.\u201cYou leveled up faster than I did.\u201d When another player commented with\u00a0curiosity, Gi-Gyu explained. \u201cCongratulations. Every player requires a different amount of experience points to level up. But this doesn\u2019t mean the players with lower experience requirements are better.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d the player who thought otherwise asked.\u201cIndeed. The Tower\u2019s rules are pretty fair. If a player\u2019s experience requirement is lower, he\u2019ll tend to have lower skills or a slower growth rate. There would always be something else that creates a proper balance. Most of the famous rankers usually have incredibly high experience requirements.\u201d When Gi-Gyu explained, the player who asked the question nodded in understanding. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t be so happy when your growth at the beginner\u2019s stage is fast. In fact, you should try to make an even greater effort. But of course,\u00a0some powerful players\u00a0don\u2019t have to follow these rules. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cOh!\u201d A player who seemed to know the answer exclaimed. He replied, \u201cThe unique ability holders.\u201d\u201cThat's right! I knew that too!\u201d another player added.\u201cThey aren\u2019t considered your average players. Unique ability owners are special and powerful existences, which means their\u00a0strength\u00a0can\u2019t be measured by numerical levels or stats.\u201d Gi-Gyu explained, but he didn\u2019t add that\u00a0he was the weakest player despite being a\u00a0unique ability holder.\u201cGosh, it would\u2019ve been great if we had unique abilities too,\u201d one player lamented.\u201cTotally. Most unique ability holders are either rankers or high rankers, right?\u201d another player concurred.Did they know how Gi-Gyu felt? Were they doing this on purpose to torment him? The players continued to chat about the unique ability holders, but Gi-Gyu looked around without paying attention to them. Part of a guide\u2019s job was to be a lookout when the players took breaks.\u2018Everything seems okay here.\u2019He inspected his surroundings carefully, but he didn\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary.\u00a0Sometimes, a sudden horde of beasts or revived monsters could spread panic among the newbie players. At times like those, the guide\u2019s duty was to lead them to safety.\u2018It should be okay as long as a guardian doesn\u2019t show up.\u2019Every floor had a guardian, also called the \u201cboss monster.\u201d\u00a0Only a guild or a large group of players could hunt these creatures\u00a0because they tend to be much more powerful than their respective floors. But they were rarely seen, which was why there weren\u2019t many hunting parties that specifically targeted them.Gi-Gyu continued to study the area as he announced to the other players, \u201cLet\u2019s head out now!\u201d***\u201cThank you for your hard work again today.\u201d Gi-Gyu thanked the other players.\u201cYou too, Guide!\u201d\u201cThe player who got hurt should visit the hospital. I know we treated him with a potion, but he might have injured his bones or nerves,\u201d Gi-Gyu advised them.\u201cGot it!\u201dAfter the day\u2019s work, Gi-Gyu checked his old wristwatch.\u2018It\u2019s late.\u2019Today\u2019s work took longer than he expected because one of the players got seriously injured. Thankfully, Gi-Gyu performed a\u00a0successful\u00a0first aid; his appointment took much longer than he had planned.\u2018I don\u2019t think I can hunt today.\u2019It was a little too late for him to do his daily solo hunt, but this wasn\u2019t all that bad. Gi-Gyu knew Tae-Shik would make sure he got paid overtime. Gi-Gyu said his goodbye to the players and left the Tower.\u201cIt was a long day, huh?\u201d Tae-Shik asked when Gi-Gyu returned to the office.\u201cYeah, someone got hurt in the middle of the session,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.\u201cDid you treat him properly?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGi-Gyu checked the time and realized that he had taken an additional three hours to finish his job today.\u00a0Then, Tae-Shik handed him 20,000 won for his troubles.\u201cThis is too much, but I\u2019ll still accept it. Thank you!\u201d Gi-Gyu answered as he smiled playfully.Ever since Gi-Gyu became a hunter at 18, Tae-Shik was the one person Gi-Gyu could always count on. In the beginning, Gi-Gyu felt frustrated when he couldn\u2019t level up. And the daily brushes with death he suffered were of no help to that frustration and annoyance. Then one day, he was returning home with a minor injury. Since he didn\u2019t have the money for potions, Gi-Gyu\u2019s wound was left untreated. It was on that fateful day that he met Tae-Shik.It was Tae-Shik who offered Gi-Gyu the guide position at the association. Whenever he could, Tae-Shik tried to pay him extra. Tae-Shik also took care of the hospital bill when Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother needed emergency treatment.\u201cI know it\u2019s hard now, but be patient. I\u2019m sure things will get better,\u201d Tae-Shik encouraged Gi-Gyu.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0Gi-Gyu thanked him, and Tae-Shik replied with a warm smile.\u00a0He was one of the few people other than his family whom Gi-Gyu could depend on.\u201cOh, I almost forgot, Gi-Gyu.\u00a0We have a new customer who\u00a0specifically requested you by name.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3. The Player Who Can\u2019t Level Up (3)\u201cSomeone requested me by name?\u201dGi-Gyu was surprised because requesting a specific guide cost extra.Tae-Shik replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, so don\u2019t be late tomorrow. I\u2019ll have all the equipment ready.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dOn his way home, Gi-Gyu was lost in thought. Usually, a client requested a specific guide because of recommendations from their acquaintances. Someone had recommended Gi-Gyu; he was curious to know who it was.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out tomorrow.\u201d Gi-Gyu decided not to think too much about it and headed home.***The next day, Gi-Gyu arrived at the association office on time. He announced, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cAlright. Take a seat,\u201d Tae-Shik replied. He was alone in his office, and when Gi-Gyu sat down, he began, \u201cThe client wants to do a five-day course with you starting today. His goal is to complete all the tutorial floors as quickly as possible.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s eyes widened as he asked in surprise, \u201cWho would spend that much money?\u201dThe full five-day course included staying in the Tower the entire time to climb the tutorial floors as quickly as possible. The client had to pay for the guide\u2019s food, potions, and equipment rental on top of the night shift premium and overtime. All in all, this was the most expensive course the association offered.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe he was requested by name for something like this. The pay from this job could finance his living expenses for an entire month, that was if he could complete it successfully.\u201cBeats me. But from what I gather, he\u2019s neither filthy rich nor a prized member of some guild. I guess you can ask him in person soon,\u201d Tae-Shik replied as he handed Gi-Gyu a cup of instant coffee.\u201cWhy are you giving me coffee all of a sudden?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked suspiciously. After spending years under Tae-Shik\u2019s wing, Gi-Gyu learned a thing or two about his personality and habits. Whenever Tae-Shik had something important to discuss, he would make Gi-Gyu a cup of instant coffee. Consequently, he looked down at the paper cup and frowned.\u201cWould you be interested in working for the association?\u201d Tae-Shik asked.\u201cFor the association?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWith a serious expression, Tae-Shik explained, \u201cYou know you can\u2019t work as a guide forever. We\u2019re losing customers to the guilds even as we speak. And the upper management is also thinking about cutting the guide department\u2019s funding. I\u2019ve heard the US offers a more lucrative business, but that isn\u2019t the case in Korea. Since this department isn\u2019t making any money, they\u2019re planning to get rid of it.\u201d\u201cJust like that?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in surprise. The fact that Tae-Shik was telling him about this meant it wasn\u2019t just an unfounded rumor. Gi-Gyu had been expecting this, but the abruptness of it all wasn\u2019t within his expectations.\u201cYes, so why don\u2019t you try working for the association? You won\u2019t be able to work as a player, but I can offer you a desk job or even make you my secretary,\u201d Tae-Shik offered.\u201cWhy would I wanna work as your secretary, Hyung?[1]\u201d Gi-Gyu answered as he burst into laughter. But despite his playful tone, his heart began to pound with frustration.\u201cGive it some serious thought, Gi-Gyu. Once this department is gone, I plan on climbing the corporate ladder myself.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Gi-Gyu gave him a casual answer before leaving the office. When he was outside, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cWorking for the association\u2026\u201d***\u201cAre you Player Kim Sun-Pil?\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled and greeted the man who approached him at the designated meeting place.\u201cOh, yes, I am!\u201d Sun-Pil answered.Gi-Gyu had been waiting for his clients. After the first man arrived, three more people followed. The man asked, \u201cYou\u2019re Kim Gi-Gyu, right? Suk-Woo told me so much about you.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed in surprise. He had been wondering who recommended him, and it turned out to be Yoo Suk-Woo.\u2018Thanks, Suk-Woo.\u2019Yoo Suk-Woo was a customer\u00a0about the same age as Gi-Gyu.\u00a0Suk-Woo was a kind man, and they had gotten along very well. They even became friends; unlike Gi-Gyu, Suk-Woo was a player who could level up. He was Suk-Woo\u2019s guide back then; after completing the job, he met Suk-Woo a few times in Seoul. Sadly, the current Suk-Woo wasn\u2019t someone Gi-Gyu could ever meet in the Tower. Gi-Gyu heard that Suk-Woo became a ranker and now led his own guild.\u201cSo how do you know Suk-Woo\u2026?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked Sun-Pil.\u201cHe\u2019s my cousin.\u201d\u201cOh! Nice to meet you.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled and offered his hand for a handshake. Afterward, the rest of the clients introduced themselves.\u00a0The group was led by Sun-Pil and had three men and one woman. The other two men were named Jae-Won and Sung-Woo, while the female player was called Ha-Neul.After the introductions, Gi-Gyu\u00a0gave a brief explanation about the Tower.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you already know what I\u2019m about to say, but I\u2019ll go over it nonetheless.\u201dWhen the group nodded, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201c23 years ago, the Tower and the Gates\u00a0came out of nowhere. Soon after, people began awakening as players,\u00a0and the world was thrown into a turmoil. The Tower posed no threat to humans, but the Gates did. The Gate, also called a dungeon, has to be closed within a certain amount of time. Else, it explodes and releases all of its monsters into\u00a0the world.\u201dEveryone nodded since this story was\u00a0actually a\u00a0well-known fact now. Satisfied, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why the players were given the duty\u00a0and the responsibility to protect this world along with their powers.\u00a0Well, then again, not every player values their\u00a0responsibility\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201d\u00a0Sun-Pil\u00a0laughed as if he found\u00a0Gi-Gyu\u2019s words funny. Most people from the association liked to emphasize the importance of a player\u2019s duty and responsibility, but Gi-Gyu seemed different.\u201cBut please remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Now, shall we continue this conversation as we get going?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked the players.\u201cYes!\u201dWith that, Gi-Gyu and Sun-Pil\u2019s group entered the Tower. Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cThis is the Tower\u2019s first floor and also where the tutorial floors begin.\u201dSun-Pil and the rest studied their surroundings as Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cThe tutorial floors include the first five floors. When a player enters the fifth floor, he must pass a test to become a true player. This is why the first five floors are called the tutorial floors.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the group answered.As he explained, a bitter expression appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face. He had actually never tried to test himself on the fateful fifth floor. Most players who took this test were at least Level 4 or higher, but even they found it difficult. So, it was practically a death sentence for a player like him who was stuck at Level 1. There was a moment years ago in which Gi-Gyu decided to risk it all and try the fifth-floor test. However, when he finally stood in front of the entrance, the memories of his mother and sister held him back. After all, he knew taking the test would result in him dying a horrible death.\u201cOnce you pass the fifth-floor test, you\u2019ll cross a landmark and become a genuine player. However, even after this, you\u2019ll face more tests on the tenth floor and every ten floors after that,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained to the group.\u201cIs the reward for passing the test different for every player?\u201d one player asked.\u201cYes. The reward will be different for every player. There have been incidents where even the tests were different for various players on the higher floo\u2014\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard about that too!\u201d one of the customers interrupted Gi-Gyu.\u201cHush. The guide is talking,\u201d another customer scolded the interrupter, making Gi-Gyu smile. Because the players in this group seemed determined to learn, and they were referred to him by an acquaintance, Gi-Gyu enjoyed teaching them immensely.\u201cThe rewards usually include stats or skills,\u201d Gi-Gyu added.\u201cWe understand.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s go hunting,\u201d Sun-Pil\u2019s group tensed at Gi-Gyu's announcement.***\u201cToday, we\u2019ll stay on the first floor to hunt the goblins. I\u2019ll teach you the process of hunting, the cleanup, and the necessary first aid procedure in case of an emergency,\u201d Gi-Gyu said to the group.\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cNow, do you see those two goblins over there?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he pointed at the goblins roaming the nearby area. He then continued, \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find a goblin alone since they move in groups.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fear the goblins too much. They are just things you kill so that you can get more comfortable with the idea of killing something alive,\u201d Gi-Gyu told the group and threw a rock at the goblins.\u201cKirrk.\u201d\u201cKirrk?\u201d Two goblins turned toward the players and sprinted toward them.\u201cGuide, help!\u201d one of the players screamed.\u201cJust do your best. It may take a long time, but killing a goblin is easy for even a first-timer,\u201d Gi-Gyu said to the group encouragingly and took a step back. One of the characteristics of a good guide was that he only joined the fray in an emergency.\u201cTry blocking the goblin\u2019s wooden spear first. You\u2019ll get used to it in no time,\u201d Gi-Gyu urged the players. While they looked around in confusion, one of the goblins suddenly closed the distance between them. Its wooden spear plunged toward a player, who swung his sword in fear.\u201cUwaah!\u201d the player screamed.\u201cKirrrk!\u201dThat casual strike sent the goblin\u2019s spear flying, bringing a smile of relief to the player\u2019s faces. The player who blocked the goblin exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s so weak!\u201dNo words of encouragement could\u2019ve motivated the players as much as that sight did. Fearless, they ran after the goblins with a roar. \u201cUwaahh!!!\u201dConsidering it was their first battle, the four players did well, but they were covered in wounds. They huffed with exhaustion, \u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d\u201cThe metal tips of a goblins\u2019 wooden spears are usually rusted, so the wounds need to be treated quickly. If they aren\u2019t, they\u2019ll cause progressive poisoning.\u201d He approached the players who were panting on the ground with a glass jar filled with a red-liquid potion.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d groaned a player when Gi-Gyu poured the potion onto his wound.\u201cIt tickles, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cInteresting fact: How much it tickles will depend on the size of the wound,\u201d Gi-Gyu said as he watched the potion work its magic. Gi-Gyu then walked around to pour the potion onto the other players\u2019 wounds as well.\u201cAfter finishing a battle, it\u2019s always a good idea to treat your wounds immediately,\u201d Gi-Gyu advised them collectively.\u201cOkay!\u201dThe players touched their bodies in surprise since all their wounds had disappeared. Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cBut a potion isn\u2019t a cure-all. A serious injury like a severed arm or nerve damage can\u2019t be treated with it. And you all know that potions don\u2019t work on normal people, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard potions are like energy drinks to them,\u201d one player answered.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now, does anyone know how injuries that can\u2019t be treated with potions are healed?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.Jae-Won, who said he wanted to become a tanker, answered, \u201cYou\u2019ll need a high-ranking healer or an elixir.\u201d\u201cElixir\u2026,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.An elixir was a rare magical item. Unlike potions, elixirs also worked on normal people or non-players. It was supposed to be a panacea that also brought youth to the user. There was a time when this was Gi-Gyu\u2019s goal in life.\u2018Mother.\u2019Gi-Gyu shook his head to dispel his worries as he stood up. Since the players were resting after their first battle,\u00a0it\u00a0was time for their guide to stand guard.***Later on, the players hunted a few more goblins. Sun-Pil\u2019s group was a talented bunch. They quickly learned the hunting pattern, and considering this was their first time in the Tower, they performed brilliantly.\u201cShall we call it a day?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen please get ready to set up the camp,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced to the group.\u201cShould we put up the tents here, Guide?\u201dThey arrived at a safe zone,\u00a0near the second floor\u2019s entrance. Gi-Gyu answered, \u201cYes. Please set up the tents while I prepare our dinner.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cCan I help you cook?\u201d Ha-Neul offered, but Gi-Gyu refused, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201dHa-Neul, looking embarrassed, returned to her group. Gi-Gyu\u00a0ignored the minor disturbance\u00a0and began cooking.\u201cWow! Guide, it smells so good!\u201d\u201cI know! Are you a chef, Guide?\u201d After setting up the tents, the players walked up to Gi-Gyu and exclaimed. The aroma wafting from the boiling pot indeed smelled delicious. Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cPlease have some.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSoon, the entire group was wolfing down the food. Gi-Gyu also served himself a small portion. Suddenly, Yoon Jae-Won asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cBy the way, Guide, I heard you can\u2019t level up. Is it true?\u201d\u201cHey! Yoon Jae-Won!\u201d the other players rebuked.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I can be an idiot sometimes,\u201d Jae-Won apologized. When the atmosphere darkened, Gi-Gyu put on a nonchalant face and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jae-Won apologized again.\u201cNo worries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\u201d\u201cYour situation is truly interesting. A player who can\u2019t level up\u2026,\u201d Sun-Pil said to Gi-Gyu with pity.Gi-Gyu laughed quietly and murmured, \u201cI agree.\u201d1. A term used to address an older brother or an older male by a younger brother or a younger man.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4. The Player Who Can\u2019t Level Up (4)\u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous,\u201d Gi-Gyu told the players. After their early morning goblin hunt, the group now stood in front of the second floor entrance. The players were rigid due to the fear of the unknown.\u201cThe second floor isn\u2019t going to be much different. You\u2019ll see orcs, but they will be wielding wooden clubs this time, not glaives. So as long as you can block their attacks, you\u2019ll be able to kill them easily,\u201d Gi-Gyu said calmly.\u201cPlease take care of us on the second floor as well, Guide.\u201d\u201cWe trust you, Guide.\u201dIt seemed Sun-Pil\u2019s group had complete faith in Gi-Gyu. Feeling grateful, Gi-Gyu opened the door and announced, \u201cLet\u2019s go inside. Please don\u2019t get scared when you are inside.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d the group replied.Gi-Gyu led the way, followed by the players, who exclaimed, \u201cWow!\u201d\u201cSo amazing...\u201dAnd just like that, the group arrived at the second floor of the Tower.***\u201cBlock the club!\u201dGi-Gyu kept his eyes on the battle and gave instructions from time to time.Thud!\u201cAim for its neck. Orcs are resilient, so they won\u2019t die unless you hit their vital spots!\u201dSlash!Success was guaranteed as long as the players followed Gi-Gyu\u2019s instructions.\u201cChweek!\u201d\u00a0screeched an orc as it collapsed.\u201cWow! We killed an orc!\u201d one of the players yelled excitedly.\u201cYou\u2019re all learning so fast!\u201d Gi-Gyu complimented the group.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you, Guide.\u00a0Your instructions have a way of increasing my focus and decreasing my nervousness!\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but smile after listening to Sung-Woo\u2019s flattery. He was finding this job gratifying\u00a0in many ways.\u201cI really think we\u2019re making effortless progress thanks to you, Guide. This course was a bit pricey, but it was well worth it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful that you feel that way,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied, and the group nodded in agreement. Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cRemember, from now on, you can\u2019t let your guard down on this floor.\u00a0There are some orcs with higher intelligence on this floor, so look\u00a0out for any surprise attacks.\u201d\u201cAh! Got it,\u201d the players replied and immediately began surveying the perimeter. This made Gi-Gyu burst into laughter.\u201cFor now, I\u2019ll stand guard, so please don\u2019t worry and rest.\u00a0Also, I think we can ascend to the third floor today.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s so fast!\u201d the players exclaimed.\u201cWell, we\u2019re in the tutorial phase after all,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.\u201cPlease take good care of us, Guide.\u201d***The group reached the third floor. As Gi-Gyu expected, the players advanced at a surprising speed.\u00a0Their minds were like sponges; they instantly absorbed every piece of trivia and knowledge Gi-Gyu gave them. Also, they grew accustomed to the battles at a frightening pace.They camped out for the day on the third floor before resuming their journey the following day. This was where they needed to be more alert, so Gi-Gyu warned them, \u201cThe goblins and the orcs will roam around in groups from this floor on.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu added, \u201cBut as long as you\u2019re well informed, it\u2019ll actually be easier to hunt here as compared to the second floor.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThe orcs and the goblins pairing together can be helpful to a player. After all, they are only monsters\u2014they are always looking for an\u00a0opportunity to fight among themselves,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cSo you can get them to fight among themselves by throwing a rock at them or\u00a0secretly killing a member of any camp. Once their mutual destruction ends, you can easily pick up the loot after killing the injured and exhausted survivors.\u201d The group nodded in understanding after hearing Gi-Gyu's explanation.Now, the group had blind trust in Gi-Gyu and began following him without question.\u2018Suk-Woo\u00a0hyung was right.\u2019Sun-Pil felt that he made the right choice by following Suk-Woo\u2019s recommendation. He was hesitant at first due to the high price, but now there was no doubt that Gi-Gyu was a talented guide. It was impressive how Gi-Gyu\u00a0only guided them toward the easy-to-kill monsters. Before long, it became apparent Gi-Gyu was leading them into situations they could just barely handle\u2014neither too safe nor too dangerous.\u00a0This allowed the group to get used to the battles and gain experiences quickly.\u201cLet\u2019s wait here for now,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d one of the players asked.\u201cThe third floor\u2019s guardian was caught a few days ago, and it respawns today,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cA guardian?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m referring to the boss monster of this floor.\u00a0Some guilds only hunt the guardians because they reward better items and higher experience points compared to the\u00a0regular monsters,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.The players nodded and replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard about that before.\u201d\u201cWhen the guardian hunters kill their target, there will be a completion firework. We\u2019ll resume then, so please rest for now,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced to the group.\u201cAre the guardians very strong?\u201d Jae-Won asked curiously. Jae-Won was the most aggressive player in the group. Gi-Gyu had met many players like Jae-Won in his career as a tutorial floor guide. After speedy level-ups and facing only the easy monsters, these players tend to feel overly confident about their skills.\u2018Teaching these players modesty is also part of being a guide.\u2019With this thought, Gi-Gyu turned toward Jae-Won and answered, \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the guardians. Even the guardians of the tutorial floors are overwhelmingly strong. Besides, we don\u2019t have enough players in our group to face it.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s that strong?\u201d Jae-Won asked again.\u201cMost guardians require a guild or a group of at least 15 players to hunt. They\u2019re extreme and persistent. They say that you should try fighting a guardian if you want to see the full extent of the Tower\u2019s horror,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered.\u201cSo is a guardian like a gatekeeper?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA gatekeeper was a monster that needed to be killed\u00a0to close a gate. There wasn\u2019t much difference between a gatekeeper and a guardian in terms of strength; if they lived on the same Tower floor, the guardian would be just a bit stronger. The group finally began to tense up after Gi-Gyu\u2019s severe warning.Gi-Gyu added, \u201cPlease don\u2019t underestimate the guardians. Even a ranker won\u2019t attempt to hunt a guardian alone except on the lower floors.\u201d\u201cThat sounds scary.\u201d The players shivered; it seemed they finally understood the danger. Gi-Gyu smiled quietly.\u00a0\u2018That ranker warning always works.\u2019Boom!Suddenly, they heard firecrackers from far away.\u00a0Gi-Gyu looked at the sky, stood up,\u00a0and announced, \u201cIt looks like they took care of the guardian.\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201d the players\u2019 eyes widened as they asked in surprise. Gi-Gyu had just explained\u00a0how strong the guardians were, so they didn\u2019t expect that the hunt would end so soon.\u00a0.\u201cMost guilds that specialize in\u00a0guardian hunting have high-level\u00a0players. They tour the Tower at specific times when the guardians are known to appear.\u00a0Usually, their goal\u2019s to get the items as soon as possible,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cThey\u00a0either sell these items or expend them to level up their newbie members,\u201d Gi-Gyu added.\u00a0Suddenly feeling curious, Gi-Gyu asked Suk-Pil, \u201cBy the way, why didn\u2019t you choose the guide from Suk-Woo\u2019s Cain Guild?\u201dAlthough not as powerful as the Angela Guild, Cain Guild, led by Suk-Woo, was still a recognizable name in Korea. If Suk-Woo was his cousin, it would\u2019ve benefited Suk-Pil financially and in many other ways to use the guide from the Cain Guild. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand Sul-Pil\u2019s choice in picking him.With a smile, Suk-Pil replied, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to be too dependent on my cousin. Oh,\u00a0and don\u2019t count getting your name from him as being dependent. Getting advice and getting help are two very different things.\u201dGi-Gyu quickly understood Sun-Pil\u2019s intention.\u2018He plans on forming his own guild.\u2019It was clear Suk-Pil was developing his career\u00a0with hopes of creating\u00a0a new guild. Gi-Gyu nodded in understanding and didn\u2019t prod further. Asking more questions at this point would have been considered rude.After the brief conversation, the group resumed their hunt.\u00a0All the players had\u00a0to reach similar levels before ascending to the fourth floor. After several more hours of battles, Gi-Gyu led the group to a safe zone.\u201cWe\u2019re leveling up so fast. Maybe we\u2019ll become rankers too?!\u201d Jae-Won chatted excitedly. Gi-Gyu was listening to the players\u2019 conversation without a word when suddenly, Sun-Pil asked, \u201cGuide, do you think we\u2019ll be able to become rankers? I\u2019ve heard some of the players you guided, including Suk-Woo, became rankers. I think you\u2019re a pretty good judge of these things.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026,\u201d Gi-Gyu hesitated.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry if it was an inappropriate question,\u201d Sun-Pil apologized hurriedly.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. I was just lost in my thoughts. So, a ranker\u2026 huh?\u201dAll the players now looked at Gi-Gyu expectantly. Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cBased on your skills and the growth speed, I think it\u2019s very possible. But there is something else more important.\u201d\u201cYou mean the player\u2019s job?\u201d Sun-Pil asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded and explained, \u201cAs you must already know, once a player passes the fifth-floor test, their job gets\u00a0decided. Some say the decision is random, while others claim it\u2019s based on the player\u2019s talent. I\u2019ve even heard that it\u2019s fate, but no one knows the truth yet.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cBut most rankers have jobs that suit them, or they have a hidden or a specialized job,\u201d Gi-Gyu added.One by one, the players began stating what they wished for.\u201cI want a hidden job!\u201d\u201cI would love a unique ability!\u201dGi-Gyu told them encouragingly, \u201cAny player can become a ranker if they work hard enough.\u201d\u201cThank you, Guide.\u201dBut of course, some would require more work than others. Suddenly, Gi-Gyu wondered what job he would receive if he passed the\u00a0fifth-floor test. In the past, he used to contemplate this question often. But once he decided against taking the test, he stopped fantasizing about the future.\u2018A job.\u2019If he passed the test and received a good job, would he be able to level up? This thought made Gi-Gyu smile.***The group entered the fourth floor. Gi-Gyu continued to give the players instructions, \u201cSame logic applies to the fourth floor. The orcs and the goblins here are a little faster and stronger, but just remember the same basic pattern and strategy.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d the players answered enthusiastically. Gi-Gyu smiled and announced, \u201cThen we\u2019ll get right to the hunt.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dIt had been a long time since Gi-Gyu met a bunch like this. Drunk on their new found power, the players nowadays were more selfish and sneakier. It was easy for the players to become domineering. Of course, there was no telling when this group of players might change. But for now, they were the most innocent players Gi-Gyu had seen in a long time.\u201cChweek!\u201d\u201cSqueeeakk!\u201dWhile Gi-Gyu was deep in his thoughts, the orcs and the goblins fell like dominoes nearby.\u2018They have great coordination.\u2019Gi-Gyu was told the players\u00a0in this group were long-time friends. Perhaps this was why their coordination improved\u00a0so quickly. The players returned to Gi-Gyu after another successful hunt. They exclaimed, \u201cGuide, it was so easy!\u201d\u201cExcellent. I think you should all be able to pass the test now. Let\u2019s level up a bit more today, and you can take the fifth-floor test tomorrow,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cHaa\u2026 But that test still sounds so scary.\u201d\u201cI hate all tests!\u201dListening to the players\u2019 sighs and complaints, Gi-Gyu encouraged them, \u201cYou don't have to worry so much. The test on the fifth floor isn\u2019t that hard. Any Level 3 or above player can clear it easily. As long as you remember my instructions and remain vigilant, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\u201cJust do what you\u2019ve been doing so far. Now, you all know that the fifth-floor test is done individually, right?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cSo from now on, we\u2019ll do some individual hunts to prepare for the test. When we meet a group of monsters,\u00a0please don\u2019t count on your coordination too much. Instead, I want each of you to pick a monster and fight on your own,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained, and the players followed his instruction. Next, they didn\u2019t all attack a monster; instead, they each picked one and went to town on it. The group battles were over; It was time for solo fights.\u2018Good.\u2019Gi-Gyu watched with satisfaction. Everyone was doing very well so far. They seemed to have a good understanding of the battle patterns, and their ability to block the clubs\u00a0was\u00a0improving rapidly.Just then, Gi-Gyu spotted a dust storm faraway. \u201cHuh?\u201dThis was not a good sign. Gi-Gyu checked his watch.\u2018This isn\u2019t the right date for the fourth-floor guardian to appear. What is that dust storm?\u2019The\u00a0storm's size was far too big to be just a monster horde. However, now wasn\u2019t the time to play detective; Gi-Gyu yelled hurriedly, \u201cWe need to run! Hurry and finish up!\u201dThat distraction was enough for an orc to strike Jae-Won\u2019s leg; it broke. \u201cAck!!!\u201dSun-Pil ran toward Jae-Won to help. Two of the four members were distracted, and nothing could be said about the other two\u2014their group was in chaos. Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cDammit!\u201dThe dust storm was getting closer.\u00a0It was obvious they couldn\u2019t escape it at this rate.\u00a0Ignoring the screaming players, Gi-Gyu began to quickly consider his options. There had to be a way for all of them to survive this situation. Even as he contemplated, the dust storm kept on approaching. The ground began to shake as well.\u2018The guardian!\u2019This had to be a guardian. Gi-Gyu still hasn\u2019t come up with a solution when suddenly, Ha-Neul became wounded and fell to the ground. \u201cKyaa!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5. Lou (1)Gi-Gyu swore, \u201cDammit!\u201d\u201cHa-Neul!\u201d one of the players screamed.A spear was sticking out of Ha-Neul\u2019s waist; a goblin had just stabbed her. Two members of their four-member team were injured, and there was no way to treat them amid the battle. The dust storm was getting closer, and overwhelming anxiety was paralyzing Gi-Gyu. All in all, the situation was worsening by the minute.\u2018I got it! The smoke shell!\u2019Suddenly, he remembered that he had a smoke shell in his bag. A smoke shell could provide them much-needed time for treating their injured and escape. Gi-Gyu quickly took out the smoke shell and yelled, \u201cI\u2019m going to use a smoke shell! When the smoke spreads, you all need to step back! That\u2019s the only way we can survive this!\u201d\u201cOkay, Guide!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201d Thankfully, the players were still alert enough to understand Gi-Gyu\u2019s instruction. Gi-Gyu opened the cap and threw the shell at the dust storm.Psssh.The smoke shell on the ground began to give up black fumes. Gi-Gyu screamed, \u201cNow! Run!\u201dThe players followed the shout in a heartbeat and began retreating swiftly. Sun-Pil helped Jae-Won walk while Sung-Woo supported Ha-Neul. Gi-Gyu took out the potion hurriedly and ordered, \u201cShow me your wounds right now!\u201dThe urgency in Gi-Gyu\u2019s order helped Jae-Won and Ha-Neul move their wounds closer to the potion bottle quickly. Then, Gi-Gyu dumped the expensive liquid on their injuries and bodies; this wasn\u2019t the time to worry about money. After all, their lives were paramount.\u201cUghhh,\u201d Jae-Won and Ha-Neul moaned as they felt the tingling sensation of the potion working on their bodies. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu had bigger worries\u2014the dust storm was hot on their tails.Jae-Won yelled, \u201cGuide, I think I can move now!\u201d\u201cHa-Neul! Are you okay?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll carry her!\u201d Sun-Pil offered.\u201cWe need to move now. Prop up the wounded!\u201d Gi-Gyu ordered. Ha-Neul was unconscious, so Sun-Pil lifted her and began running.\u201cChweek!\u201d\u201cSqueeeakk!\u201dVarious monstrous shrieks stemming from the dark smoke followed them as they ran for their lives.***\u201cHaa\u2026 \u201c\u201cHuuuuu\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dRight now, the entire group was panting like dogs as they rested in a cave. Gi-Gyu found this cave a while back and decided to make it an emergency hideout.After catching their breath, the players couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat the hell was that just now?\u201dIt was apparent that everyone here had heard those screams from the orcs and goblins. The dust storm didn\u2019t spare anyone\u2014it engulfed the giant orcs and the goblin hordes alike. Gi-Gyu answered tensely, \u201cIt was probably the fourth-floor guardian.\u201dHe never expected to see the fourth-floor guardian giant orc here. What were the hunting guilds doing? Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand how the guardian could have suddenly appeared in front of them.\u201cWe\u2019ll set off the firecrackers after leaving the cave at the right time,\u201d Gi-Gyu said to the players as he handed them some firecrackers. The sound of the firecrackers could alert the guardian-huntings guild or the other players to come and help them. However, it would also alert the monsters, so their escape window would be very small.Thankfully, they had enough food and equipment to hide out for a long time since they had prepared for a five-day course. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow\u2019s everyone?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine now,\u201d Jae-Won answered.\u201cI think something\u2019s wrong with Ha-Neul! She isn\u2019t waking up!\u201d Gi-Gyu walked up to her after hearing Sung-Woo\u2019s worry-laden voice.\u2018She has been poisoned with goblin venom.\u2019The skin on Ha-Neul\u2019s waist was turning black. Gi-Gyu reached for his bag and began searching for an antidote.\u201cDammit,\u201d Gi-Gyu swore quietly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI need the antidote to cure Ha-Neul\u2019s goblin poisoning, but the bottle broke while we were running,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dHa-Neul\u2019s torpor worried the players to no end.\u2018At this rate, she could be in grave danger.\u2019The best-case scenario was some mild side effects, but the worst-case scenario was death. She would have been fine if she were simply poisoned by goblin blood or a poisonous spear tip. Lamentably, she currently showed symptoms of being poisoned by a mix of several different toxins.Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI\u2019m going out to patrol the area.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be safe?\u201d one of the players asked.\u201cI know this area very well.\u00a0Also, I\u2019ve to find a good place to set off the firecrackers,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. He had passed through this region countless times in the last five years; he knew exactly where the monsters liked to appear and which paths were safe to walk. This wasn\u2019t the safest option, but he felt confident in his ability.\u201cYou must all remain here until I return,\u201d Gi-Gyu warned.Sun-Pil and Sung-Woo replied with worried faces, \u201cPlease be careful.\u201d\u201cMake sure you stay safe.\u201dGi-Gyu slowly walked out and reassured them, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d***After he left the cave, Gi-Gyu trudged along. Their current location was an isolated lowland, which meant the other players in the area were unlikely to see the firecrackers. Besides, making so much noise at the cave entrance could attract monsters.Gi-Gyu looked around the area, but he couldn\u2019t see any signs of the monsters. Deciding that he could continue, Gi-Gyu began to amble. He knew there was a hill 20 minutes from this cave.\u00a0The other players must\u2019ve spotted the unusual dust storm by now, so Gi-Gyu believed they would also notice the firecrackers on the hill.\u201cArgh,\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned and paused. It seemed he sprained his ankle earlier, and the pain was worsening. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have many potions left.\u00a0Gi-Gyu knew he had to save them in case of fatal injuries. He\u00a0decided to ignore his wound and continue.\u201cChweek!\u201dGi-Gyu lowered his body further and hid behind a rock after hearing a sharp orc cry.\u2018It\u2019s an orc.\u2019A single orc was wandering around nearby.\u2018Why would an orc be here?\u2019Gi-Gyu had never seen an orc on this path before. Perhaps the orcs were herded to this area because of\u00a0the guardian\u2019s abrupt appearance.\u2018I should\u2019ve expected this.\u2019It seemed his five-year experience as a guide was\u00a0falling short\u00a0in this unexpected situation. Gi-Gyu turned around to find another path.\u201cChweek!\u201dUnfortunately, he could hear an\u00a0orc crying in the opposite direction too.\u2018There too?\u2019He still had his last smoke shell in the bag. To Gi-Gyu, even one orc could be a huge threat. He was clearly stuck with only one recourse now. He couldn\u2019t retreat, which meant he had to advance forward. Setting off the firework here was not an option unless he wanted to attract the orcs to him.\u2018I have only one smoke shell left.\u2019He remembered the last smoke shell in his bag. If he threw it at the orc ahead of him, it could give him a chance to run around it. Gi-Gyu walked forward and saw the orc still roaming the path.\u201cChweek!\u201dPsssh\u2026The orc screamed at the fumes from the\u00a0shell; Gi-Gyu used this opportunity to run with his sprained ankle.\u201c\u201cChweeeeeeek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201dSuddenly, a strange-looking orc appeared in front of him. The orc was over three meters tall, and it boasted frighteningly thick canines. It seemed incredibly intimidating, stifling all of Gi-Gyu\u2019s senses.\u2018Fourth-floor guardian!\u2019Gi-Gyu crouched on the ground and held his breath. It seemed the guardian hadn't noticed him yet. If he remained on the ground and crawled, perhaps he could escape.\u201cChwee\u2014\u201cSniff, sniff, sniff\u2026Shiver!The guardians could smell fear from their prey. Gi-Gyu quickly took out the potion and poured it on his sprained ankle.\u201c\u201cChweek, Chweek\u2026?\u201dSoon, the orc began moving in the opposite direction.\u00a0Thankfully, the guardian orc was walking away from Gi-Gyu\u2019s destination.\u201cHuh?!\u201dCrash!When Gi-Gyu was trying to put the potion bottle back in his bag, the bottle slipped out of his hand; the sharp smashing sound was quite deafening that day.\u201cChweek?!\u201d\u201cDammit!\u201dThe guardian orc was staring dead at the rock behind which Gi-Gyu was hiding. Suffice to say, that damn bottle was quite loud.Crack!Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hesitate to turn around and run back to where he came from.\u00a0Milliseconds later, the\u00a0guardian\u2019s giant glaive hit the exact spot where Gi-Gyu was crouching. The sound of the explosions and the rock fragments clouded his path, but Gi-Gyu continued to sprint nonetheless.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201d\u201cChweekkk!\u201dThe trees slowed down the giant guardian orc a little, but Gi-Gyu knew he would be caught in no time at this rate.\u201cChweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201dBoom! Boom!Gi-Gyu could hear unfamiliar explosions behind, but he didn\u2019t have time to look back.\u2018The only chance I have is reaching that place!\u2019As his mind went into overdrive, it soon came with the location of a place that might offer him safety. It was a risky move, but it would be better than dying a horrible death here.\u201cChuweeeeekkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!\u201dThe guardian orc was now right behind Gi-Gyu. Cautiously, he turned around.Pssshhh!Kaboom!With the last bit of strength he had, Gi-Gyu set off the firecracker. He expected the other players in the area to arrive soon\u00a0after realizing the guardian's location.\u201cChweeeeeeekkkkkkkkkkkkk!\u201dSuddenly, a\u00a0\u00a0giant glaive flew above Gi-Gyu\u2019s head. He quickly turned to doge it and ran towards the door nearby.It was the entrance to the fifth floor.***Plop\u2026Plop\u2026\u201cHmm?\u201dGi-Gyu jolted and opened his eyes when he felt\u00a0water droplets slapping his face.\u201cWhere am I?\u201dHis memories returned as his eyes adjusted to the darkness.. Gi-Gyu remembered entering the fifth floor to escape the guardian orc.\u201cSo I guess I\u2019m here.\u201dFear of death drove him to the one place he had been avoiding for five years. Gi-Gyu found himself in a cold wet cave. He rummaged through his bag;unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t anything helpful left. The only functional item he had was the steel dagger on his waist.After checking out his perimeter, Gi-Gyu hesitantly took a step. Going forward was now the only option he had left.[You have entered the first test chamber.][Checking the player\u2019s information.][Unknown ability has been detected.][You have satisfied all requirements.][Test difficulty level has been significantly reduced accordingly.]\u201cWhat?\u201dAn unfamiliar system voice rang continuously\u00a0in his head; suddenly, the scenery in front of him changed.***[First test.][Hunt a goat.]Dazed, Gi-Gyu found himself standing amid green pasture.Blink, blink...All he could do now was blink because he couldn\u2019t understand this situation.\u2018Satisfied all requirements? Reduced difficulty?\u2019 \u2019He remembered the system\u2019s last words clearly. In addition,\u00a0there was a blue screen in front of him stating\u00a0\u00a0the test description.And lastly\u2026\u201cA goat\u2026?\u201dA goat was standing in front of him, a snow-white goat lazily eating grass while staring at the obvious weirdo here. Gi-Gyu\u2019s head began to throb.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dHe tried to understand what the system stated earlier. He had never heard any player mention hearing the system talking about meeting the requirements and reducing the test difficulty level. Gi-Gyu suspected it was because his level was too low, but he couldn\u2019t know this for certain.In the end, Gi-Gyu took out his dagger. There was only one answer to this test. Still keeping his guard up, he slowly approached the goat.\u201cBaaaa!\u201d the goat cried out in its trembling voice. His hand shaking, Gi-Gyu stabbed the goat.Shink.\u201cBaaaa!\u201d the goat screamed as Gi-Gyu\u2019s steel dagger pierced its neck; soon, the goat fell to the ground. He has been worried the goat might be stronger than it looks, but when he realized he was wrong, Gi-Gyu slumped on the ground.\u201cThat's it?\u201d When nothing happened afterward, Gi-Gyu became confused. But soon after, the system voice rang inside his head.[You have passed the test.][Your job will be decided.][Your unknown ability will appear.][You will be given a reward.][Perfect score!][The quality of your reward has been increased.]Suddenly, the space around him began to crumple.***When Gi-Gyu woke up, he was sitting in the dark. The total darkness made it hard for him to know if his eyes were even opened. Then, Gi-Gyu heard a boy\u2019s voice.-Who are you?\u201cWhat?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion.-Are you my master?\u201cYour master?\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand what the boy was talking about. And wasn\u2019t he supposed to get a reward in a box inside the reward chamber?-I asked you if you\u2019re my master.When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t answer, the boy asked again in a frustrated voice. Gi-Gyu inquired, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d-Dammit, so this idiot is my master.Gi-Gyu also began to feel frustrated when the young boy refused to give him a proper answer. He asked in annoyance, \u201cJust what are you yapping about?\u201d-This is so unfair. I\u2019ve been waiting for so long, yet I end up with this stupid human.\u201cI sai\u2014\u201dGi-Gyu was about to ask the boy again when he was interrupted.-I\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time. Whether you want me or not, you\u2019re now my master.\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve been waiting for me?\u201dThe boy remained quiet for a while before continuing.-That\u2019s right. You\u2019re my master, so give me a name.\u201cA name?\u201d-I\u2019m telling you to sync with me.Gi-Gyu was about to ask again when the system voice rang inside his head.[The Ego requested\u00a0a\u00a0sync.][Would you like to sync\u00a0with Ego?][Please decide Ego\u2019s name...]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lou (2)\u2018Name?\u2019\u2018Decide his name?\u2019-I asked you to give me a name!One name suddenly popped in Gi-Gyu\u2019s head after hearing the boy\u2019s frustrated screams. Gi-Gyu said, \u201cLou.\u201d-What?\u201cYou asked me to name you, so you are \u2018Lou\u2019 from now on.\u201dAs if in a trance, the boy said nothing, and a short silence fell in the area.-Alright.\u201c\u2026\u201d-I like it. From now on, my name is \u201cLou.\u201d Call me \u201cLou.\u201d[You have synced with Ego.][You have successfully synced with Ego named \u201cLou.\u201d][\u201cLou\u201d shall belong to you from now on.][You can now access \u201cLou\u2019s\u201d information.]The system voice continued to make announcements. It announced so many things that Gi-Gyu found his mind drowning in automated notifications.-I\u2019m disappointed I have an idiot for a master, but I guess I have no other choice.The sheer rudeness of the brat\u2014uhm, I mean boy, made Gi-Gyu wanna faint.***\u201cDoctor! The patient is conscious!\u201d a nurse yelled.\u201cCall his family and check his vitals,\u201d the doctor ordered.\u201cYes, Doctor!\u201d The nurse replied.Gi-Gyu's head pounded as if his heart was inside his skull.\u2018What\u2019s that sound?\u2019A cocktail of various noises and sounds tickled his ears as he regained consciousness. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t hear very well because his ears were waterlogged. His eyes refused to open, he felt unreasonably cold, he was shivering feverishly, and his brain was begging for more time in slumberland.\u2018Should I just go back to sleep?\u2019The throbbing, the cold, the pain and all seemed to be inviting him into a comfortable eternal slumber. The fatigue made him crave sleep like a deranged junkie.\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d Yoo-Jung whispered.\u201cYoo-Jung\u2026?\u201d When Gi-Gyu heard his sister\u2019s voice, his eyes flew open, and his previously stiff jaw magically moved.\u201cOppa?! Can you hear me?!\u201d Yoo-Jung exclaimed.\u201cWhat the\u2026 Where am I?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion. His eyes were blurry, so he couldn\u2019t see much, but he quickly realized where he was.\u2018It smells like medicine.\u2019He was in a hospital. His sight and hearing slowly returned; soon, he could see Yoo-Jung staring at him worriedly.\u201cOppa! Are you okay?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked.\u201cGi-Gyu!\u201d Tae-Shik yelled in panic.\u201cYou can\u2019t yell in here!\u201d a nurse warned them.The door burst open, and a man hurried inside. The newcomer who interrupted Yoo-Jung was none other than Oh Tae-Shik. Noticing Tae-Shik\u2019s rapid approach, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhy am I in the hospital?\u201dHis memory was too fuzzy for him to recall anything.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d Tae-Shik asked.\u201cNo, I\u2026 I\u2026 Why can\u2019t I remember?\u201dHug.\u201cThank god, Gi-Gyu,\u201d Tae-Shik murmured as he hugged Gi-Gyu.\u201cWe need to do some tests on the patient.\u201d The heartwarming scene was abruptly interrupted by the doctor.\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d Tae-Shik left when the doctor entered the room. Gi-Gyu suspected that Tae-Shik left his work in the middle of the day to see him. Meanwhile, Yoo-Jung also left with Tae-Shik to let the doctor conduct his examination.The doctor asked him a few simple questions and then examined his body. After the check-up, the doctor said, \u201cEverything looks fine. Since you have regained your consciousness, we\u2019ll proceed with some tests.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 Alright,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered, still a bit confused.When the doctor left the room, Yoo-Jung returned and murmured, \u201cThank goodness. I\u2019m so relieved.\u201d\u201cSo why am I in the hospital?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYou were found near the fifth-floor landmark. The people from the association found you unconscious and brought you to this hospital.\u201d\u201cI was found near the fifth-floor landmark?\u201dThere was another question Gi-Gyu wanted to ask, but he knew Yoo-Jung wouldn't know the answer. \u00a0Yoo-Jung replied, \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know the details. Mr. Tae-Shik told me that you got hurt while trying to save other people.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in surprise.\u201cI\u2019m still trying to process everything that happened, Oppa. Gosh\u2026 But I\u2019m so thankful that you\u2019re finally awake. I need to go check on Mom, so I\u2019ll come back later. You need to rest,\u201d Yoo-Jung said to him.\u201cOkay. Please tell Mom I\u2019m fine.\u201dYoo-Jung left the room and closed the door behind her. Left alone, Gi-Gyu wondered,\u00a0\u2018What happened?\u2019\u00a0He vaguely remembered the rude boy\u2019s voice, not much else.\u2018I don\u2019t know what happened.\u2019No matter how hard he tried, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened to him.***After finishing the day\u2019s work, Tae-Shik revisited Gi-Gyu in the evening. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo what happened to me?\u201d\u201cYou still can\u2019t remember?\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cI\u2019m starting to remember bits and pieces of it; the whole picture is still unclear. I remember our party meeting a guardian and hiding in a cave. Then, I went outside to set off firecrackers, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOutside, I met the guardian again, so I ran away and set off the firecrackers\u2026 Oh! How\u2019s Ha-Neul?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked suddenly.Tae-Shik laughed and teased, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should be more worried about your own health right now?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m fine,\u201d Gi-Gyu protested.\u201cHa-Neul is fine. The players hunting near the area saw your firecrackers and rushed to help. Thankfully, there was a guild near where you were. The guardian escaped, but they were able to track your moves and found the group hiding in the cave,\u201d Tae-Shik explained patiently.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered with relief. Just then, Tae-Shik\u2019s face became a little serious. He asked, \u201cSo what happened?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t found in front of the fifth-floor entrance. You were found collapsed near the portal landmark at the end of the fifth floor. That must mean\u2026\u201dWhen Tae-Shik looked at Gi-Gyu expectantly, Gi-Gyu asked rhetorically, \u201cIt must mean I passed the test, right?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dThe calm on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face seemed comical to Tae-Shik, so he laughed and said, \u201cGi-Gyu! Congratulations!\u201d\u201cI still don\u2019t know what happened exactly. My memories are still really spotty.\u201d\u201cJust rest for now. player Kim Sun-Pil will be visiting you soon. When you were unconscious, he visited you every day,\u201d Tae-Shik reassured Gi-Gyu.\u201cI was unconscious for days?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked with surprise. He couldn\u2019t precisely gauge how long he was out for, but even his best guess wasn\u2019t close to reality.\u201cAbout two weeks,\u201d Tae-Shik answered.\u201cTwo weeks?!\u201d\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t worry. Your hospital bill was covered by the insurance.\u201d\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Gi-Gyu said.\u201cI recall you saying that you haven\u2019t rested properly since you were seriously injured by a goblin. Take this opportunity to rest and relax. I\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d Tae-Shik said his farewell.\u201cOkay.\u201d***\u201cGi-Gyu!\u201d\u201cGuide!\u201dJae-Won and Ha-Neul rushed toward Gi-Gyu and grabbed his hands. Gi-Gyu gave them a warm smile and squeezed their hands. He was happy to see that all the players looked perfectly healthy. Jae-Won said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\u201cI heard you left the cave because of me, Guide\u2026\u201d Ha-Neul murmured.\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay now,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.Then, Sun-Pil, his group members, and Gi-Gyu walked to the break room together. Gi-Gyu said, \u201cI\u2019m so relieved you\u2019re all okay.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re also glad you\u2019re okay, Guide,\u201d Jae-Won replied.\u201cHave you recovered fully now?\u201d Ha-Neul asked.They chatted for a long time in the break room. There, Jae-Won and Ha-Neul explained that soon after Gi-Gyu left the cave, the players hunting nearby arrived to help them. Apparently, Ha-Neul\u2019s condition was severe; thankfully, a healer was there to help. They also told Gi-Gyu that even as they were being rescued, Jae-Won and Sun-Pil insisted on searching for him.The group talked for hours as if they were long-lost friends.Sun-Pil explained, \u201cJae-Won and I really wanted to go back to find you when we heard the firecrackers\u2019 epicenter was a mass.\u201dGi-Gyu remembered what happened at the entrance to the fifth floor. The players told him the guardian orc was rampaging in the area, but it had escaped by the time the guild arrived.\u201cEveryone thought you were dead, Gi-Gyu. But Jae-Won and I believed you were still alive, which was why we tried to go back for you\u2026\u201d Sun-Pil murmured apologetically.\u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d Jae-Won added.Since the guardian had escaped, sending two players seeking the unknown made no sense. So, they were advised to request help from the association, which is precisely what they did. When Sun-Pil and the rest slumped with guilt, Gi-Gyu said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright; It was my choice. A player must be responsible for his own life after all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The players nodded.While staring at Gi-Gyu with obvious curiosity, Ha-Neul asked, \u201cBy the way, Guide, I heard that you were found at the fifth-floor landmark. Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t remember it, but that\u2019s what I was told as well,\" Gi-Gyu answered calmly.Ha-Neul inquired further, \u201cSo does that mean you passed the test?\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cOh! I\u2019m so sorry I asked,\u201d Ha-Neul apologized.\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201dAfter Ha-Neul\u2019s questions, Gi-Gyu and the players continued their conversation. Sun-Pil relayed a message to Gi-Gyu, \u201cSuk-Woo couldn\u2019t make it because he\u2019s too busy. He asked me to tell you he\u2019s sorry.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied, and the other players offered, \u201cIf you ever need any help, please call us. We\u2019ll do everything we can.\u201dGi-Gyu laughed and replied, \u201cSame goes for me. Please let me know if you need anything.\u201d***Gi-Gyu was dismissed from the hospital a few days later. As soon as his presiding doctor gave him a clean chit, he signed the discharge paper.Yoo-Jung asked, \u201cSo you saved those players, Oppa?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to give up your life for other people. You\u2019ve already sacrificed yourself for this family\u2014that\u2019s more than enough,\u201d Yoo-Jung grumbled.\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I don't consider what I do for my family a sacrifice,\u201d Gi-Gyu clarified patiently.The brother-sister duo was on their way home. Gi-Gyu patted Yoo-Jung\u2019s head and added, \u201cMy family and my life are the two most important things in my life. That day in the Tower, I only did what I did because I was certain I would be safe. I would never leave you and Mom, so you should never worry.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Yoo-Jung replied brightly.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry home, Yoo-Jung.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu reached the shabby rooftop attic, he felt like it had been months since he was home. He walked in and greeted his mother, \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d\u201cGi-Gyu!\u201d His mother burst into tears when she saw him.\u201cWhy are you crying, Mom?\u201dHis mother sobbed, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Mom\u2019s so sorry. You were in a coma, yet I couldn\u2019t even visit you in the hospital. I couldn\u2019t take care of you. I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Mother. Please don\u2019t cry,\u201d Gi-Gyu consoled her.His mother cried for a long time. All Gi-Gyu and Yoo-Jung could do was wipe her eyes for her. When she finally stopped crying, their mother explained her new fears. It seemed she was now worried about Gi-Gyu being a player. After a long conversation, his mother finally fell asleep holding Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand.Gi-Gyu said to Yoo-Jung, \u201cLet\u2019s eat dinner now.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make something,\u201d Yoo-Jung volunteered.\u201cNo, I can do it. It has been a while since I cooked,\u201d Gi-Gyu offered.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Yoo-Jung looked at him worriedly, but Gi-Gyu laughed and opened the fridge door.\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d To Yoo-Jung\u2019s question, Gi-Gyu answered, \u201cLet\u2019s eat bibimbap[1].\u201dGi-Gyu grabbed several containers from the refrigerator and began to mix everything. He added gochujang[2]\u00a0to white rice, kimchi, and vegetables. With a drop of sesame seed oil, the final result looked delicious. After the meal, Gi-Gyu did the dishes and changed.Yoo-Jung asked, \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you going out?\u201d\u201cI have to go to the Tower,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Yoo-Jung\u2019s face turned bright red. Gi-Gyu was discharged just hours ago, so she couldn\u2019t believe he would want to return to the Tower so soon. She yelled, \u201cHave you lost your mind? You just left the hospital, yet you\u2019re going back to the Tower in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cYeah, I need to confirm something.\u201d\u201cConfirm what?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked angrily.\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, Yoo-Jung.\u201d Leaving his worried sister behind, Gi-Gyu walked outside. All this while, his heart had been pounding wildly, and that confused him to no end. There was something he had to check.\u201cStatus screen,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. A blue screen appeared before him; the screen showed the player\u2019s individual information.[Level 1][Job: Ego\u2019s partner][Unique Ability: Link (Can link up with Ego.)][Skill: Assimilation (Can assimilate to become one with linked Ego and use Ego\u2019s ability.)]\u201cEgo\u2019s partner?!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed. This strange-sounding title was the job he received after passing the test. He had been secretly praying for a level-up ever since he woke up; sadly, he was still at Level 1.\u201cLink?\u201dThe question marks that followed his unique ability were now finally replaced.Link.As the name suggested, a unique ability was something that only a single player could own. In other words, only Gi-Gyu had this ability in the entire world. The prospects this held made his heart pound like a drum. It had been five years since the last change occurred on his status screen, so this was enough to excite him to death.\u201cI need to get to the Tower first.\u201d He knew he would find out more about this change inside the Tower, so Gi-Gyu was willing to be patient. Expectantly, he headed toward the Tower.1. A Korean rice dish topped with sauteed vegetables or kimchi.\u00a0\u261c2. Spicy red pepper paste.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7. Lou (3)\u201cHow am I supposed to use this?!\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered in frustration. After entering the Tower, he tried everything he could think of, but he still couldn\u2019t make his ability work. There was no information on using his so-called \u201cLink\u201d ability or the assimilation skill that awakened due to his new job. Like a malfunctioning robot, Gi-Gyu kept trying to summon the skill. Pity, nothing happened.Feeling defeated, Gi-Gyu sat down on the ground and muttered, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Was that boy I named Lou, not the Ego?\u201dAs if just waiting for that statement, a blue marble suddenly appeared before his eyes.[Ego \u201cLou\u201d is being summoned.][Nonphysical form of Ego \u201cLou\u201d has been summoned.][Lou failed to create his physical form.][Lou\u2019s physical form will be chosen randomly due to the player\u2019s lack of ability.][Lou\u2019s physical form will be formed by absorbing random materials.]\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201dFinally, Gi-Gyu realized the summoning only worked when he called out the Ego\u2019s name. However, the rush didn't last long as the system\u2019s announcement began ringing bells in his mind.\u2018Absorb\u2026 random materials?\u2019Fwoosh!\u201cHuh?\u201dWhile he was still reeling from the announcement, a vortex suddenly surrounded the blue marble and began absorbing everything in its surroundings.\u201cNo!\u201d Gi-Gyu screamed. Before he knew it, the vortex had sucked in his sword, his dagger, and the bag hanging around his waist. Gi-Gyu tried his best to grab onto his bag, but all that was left in his hands were the bag\u2019s straps.Gi-Gyu yelled in panic, \u201cArghhh! That bag is worth five million won!\u201d On top of being extortionately priced, the bag also held potions, expensive disposable items, and some very pricey pieces of equipment.\u201cW-wait!\u201dAlso, the bigger problem right now was that the vortex was also sucking in his clothes. At this rate, he would become the weakest exhibitionist.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Before long, Gi-Gyu was just in his underwear, and this realization stressed him to no end. Even though the vortex, thankfully, didn\u2019t suck him in, he could only watch in despair as it slowly sucked in the only article protecting his dignity.[Lou has absorbed enough materials.][Lou\u2019s physical form will be decided.]Suddenly, the space around him began to shake. The blue marble changed its shape randomly before both the vortex and the marble came to a sudden halt.-Hey!It was then that Gi-Gyu heard the bratty boy\u2019s voice.***\u201cSo you\u2019re Lou?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.-Of course. Forgot you gave me that name or something? Anyway, how often do I have to repeat myself before you finally get it?The imp of a kid was now wearing a blanket he got from god knows where. As Gi-Gyu tried to hold a civil conversation with Lou, he had to use every bone in his body not to get angry at the boy\u2019s impertinent tone.\u201cI have a question.\u201d-Now what? If it\u2019s anything dumb, I won\u2019t dignify it with an answer.Gi-Gyu was currently holding a sword that he had never seen in his entire life.It was an entirely crimson sword.Lou\u2019s current physical form was this red sword. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat exactly is an Ego? Is it like a soul?\u201d-Hmm... Not dumb. Okay. It\u2019s not a soul.\u201cThen what is it?\u201d-Like I would know.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu could only sigh deeply in response to that answer. The information Lou possessed seemed\u2026 limited. Gi-Gyu asked another question, \u201cDoes an Ego hold the same abilities as the player?\u201d-I don\u2019t know what a player is. But if you\u2019re referring to levels, skills, or abilities, we certainly have them too.That was the most shocking fact Gi-Gyu learned that night. And that was after seeing a blue marble turn into a crimson sword. He couldn\u2019t understand how this physical form was decided. He was even more confused about what the blue marble deemed absorbable. Another surprising thing was that the red sword he held had its own status screen.[Lou][Level 1][Power 1, Speed 1, Stamina 1, Magic 1][Accessory]One thing was for sure\u2014this sword could level up like players.\u2018So this is like a growing item?\u2019The sword had growth potential; it was definitely a unique item because Gi-Gyu had never heard of anything like this before.-Idiot! What are you doing? Are you gonna continue fondling me like a pervert?Crack!Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his frustration anymore. He has been patient with this sword until now, but it was time to teach it a lesson. Gi-Gyu cherished his mental health, and this act would definitely only be for his health; there was no way he would derive pleasure from it. However, he had to act nice for a bit more since he still had some questions for the mouthy, bratty, insolent sword. Gi-Gyu took a deep breath and asked, \u201cCan you move by yourself?\u201d-Hmm... Not now, but probably in the future.\u201cCan you break the link and find a new master on your own?\u201d-Hmm\u2026\u201cPlease answer the question?\u201d Gi-Gyu prodded in a friendlier voice.-An Ego\u2019s master can break the link, but the Ego can\u2019t do it independently.\u201cOh! Then my next question is this: Could you harm me after becoming mobile?\u201d-I can certainly attack you. But if you die, the Ego linked to you will perish as well, so I suppose an Ego can\u2019t kill its master.These were all handy pieces of information. More importantly, the answers were exactly what Gi-Gyu hoped to hear. A slow smile appeared on Gi-Gyu's face as he asked his last question, \u201cCan you feel pain too?\u201d-What? Hmm\u2026 An Ego is a great being; therefore, it can feel all emotions, including pain! Also, you can fine-tune an Ego\u2019s perception of any and all emotions, bu\u2014\u201d\u201cIs this how it\u2019s done?\u201d Gi-Gyu interrupted Lou and summoned the system.[Would you like to turn on Lou\u2019s pain sensor?]The system voice asked immediately. Without hesitation, Gi-Gyu turned on Lou\u2019s pain sensor.-W-what do you think you\u2019re doing?!***Clunk!-Arghh!The red sword was thrown to the ground hard. It crashed into the rocks on the ground, making Lou scream.-I asked you what you\u2019re doing! Put that down! I said, put that thing down right now!\u201cI heard earlier that you can heal from most wounds. Am I right?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. To his surprise, Lou could repair itself.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll save on the repair fee.\u2019Gi-Gyu picked up the biggest rock he could find and walked toward Lou. He then began \u201cdisciplining\u201d the red sword without hesitation.Clunk!-That hurts! I said it hurts! Stop!\u201cYou!\u201d Gi-Gyu emphasized each word.Clunk!\u201cNeed!\u201dClunk!\u201cTo learn some manners!\u201dClunk! Clunk! Clunk!\u201cThis is Korea, where good manners are a virtue! You jerk!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled as he continued to beat the red sword with a rock. Every time he hit the sword, a small scratch appeared on Lou.\u201cIf you continue to act this rudely, it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d-I\u2019m sorry! Sorry! It hurts! I said it hurts!Clunk!\u201cSorry? You\u2019re sorry? It hurts?\u201d Gi-Gyu repeated Lou\u2019s words sarcastically.-I apologi\u2014When Lou saw Gi-Gyu raise the rock again, it screamed in panic.-I apologize. I\u2019ve been alone for so long that I lost my mind.Gi-Gyu finally grabbed the scratch-covered Lou and replied, \u201cGood. Let\u2019s hope we get along well from now on, Lou!\u201d-...\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me?\u201d-I-I apologize.Gi-Gyu finally grinned. Lou was the very first item he received after his unique ability was revealed. In his heart of hearts, he knew he wouldn\u2019t have thrown it away even if it had remained brash. Thankfully, after a brief disciplining session, his mental stability and the unique item were secured. Gi-Gyu had to admit he partly took out his lifelong frustration on Lou, but he didn\u2019t feel guilty. He said to the sword, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll answer my questions politely from now on. Do you understand?\u201d-...\u201cAnswer me.\u201d-Okay\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to be informal in a situation like this.\u201d-Yes, Sir!Gi-Gyu was satisfied with Lou\u2019s military-style answer. He was reminded again how pain was always helpful in correcting bad manners.\u201cDo you know what a link is?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.-A link is something that makes an Ego belong to its master. It connects an Ego to its master and allows its assimilated master to use the Ego\u2019s abilities, skil\u2014\u201cDo I detect a hint of impudence?\u201d-N-no, Sir!Gi-Gyu began to see the big picture based on Lou\u2019s explanations.\u2018So this link will allow me to gain Egos like Lou; once I assimilate to it, I can use its abilities. Does this mean...\u2019If Lou leveled up, would he become stronger too? Could Lou level up in his place?If so, this meant\u2026Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart began to pound. After finishing his thoughts, Gi-Gyu looked at Lou and asked, \u201cCan you level up?\u201d-Level\u2026 up?\u201cExactly. Do you need something special to grow? Or do you level up when you kill a monster? How do you become stronger?\u201d-???\u201cYou told me you can grow stronger.\u201d-I don\u2019t know.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t like Lou\u2019s answer. It seemed the only way to find the answer was through experiences. Gi-Gyu picked up the red sword and left the Tower wrapped in a blanket. His legs felt cold, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t mind it so much tonight.***\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu bought the minimum number of equipment and potions he would need. He was really thankful for the insurance money since he could now spend the saved-up cash on these purchases.-Hehe\u2026Lou\u2019s quiet embarrassed giggles made Gi-Gyu wonder how could this awesome red sword be possessed by an Ego with the mental capacity of a toddler. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t suppress its sarcastic laugh, but he let it go since he didn\u2019t find it annoying.\u201cLet\u2019s make the best effort,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.This mental expenditure would pay off if things worked out the way he expected.***\u201cKirrrk. Kirrrk.\u201dGi-Gyu now stood on his secret hunting ground on the first floor. As expected, he found a single goblin there.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d The anxiety made him sigh since it had been a long since he last hunted. But Gi-Gyu shook his head to calm down his nerves. Lowering his body, Gi-Gyu was about to attempt a surprise attack just like he had always done. However, seconds before he could take his first step, he heard a system notification in his head.[Assimilation will allow you to use Lou\u2019s ability.]\u2018Huh?\u2019The difference was subtle, but Gi-Gyu definitely felt a little lighter. His body seemed to move a little faster; at the same time, he felt stronger.\u2018Not bad!\u2019This was probably what other Level 1 players felt while hunting. Gi-Gyu was finally feeling the changes he watched other players enjoy during the last five years. After all, a single-digit ability change could empower a player significantly.Rustle, rustle\u2026Gi-Gyu's shoes made noise as he walked on the grass, but it seemed the monster couldn\u2019t hear him. Gi-Gyu swung Lou at the goblin when he got close enough.Slash!A clean-cut appeared on the goblin\u2019s back, followed by its green blood seeping from the wound.\u201dSqueeeeeeeeeakk!\u201d the goblin screamed and twisted in pain. Before Gi-Gyu could enjoy his successful surprise attack, he heard Lou\u2019s scream.-Arghhhh! That hurts! That hurts!\u201cS-sorry! I forgot to turn off your pain sensor,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized awkwardly. Lou was screaming alongside the goblin because Gi-Gyu had forgotten to turn off its pain sensor after that night. Gi-Gyu was about to turn the sensor off, but the goblin darted.\u201cJust hang on for a moment!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled.Whoosh!The goblin\u2019s wooden spear almost grazed Gi-Gyu\u2019s arm, but he dodged it just in time.\u2018So much faster.\u2019He was referring to himself, not the goblin. Had this been the old Gi-Gyu, he would\u2019ve come out of this encounter with a big gash on his arm; today, he could see the spear\u2019s movement very clearly.\u2018I can do this.\u2019Gi-Gyu slowly focused his senses. He had been, in a way, hunting this exact same goblin for the last five years; if there was anyone utterly familiar with its movement pattern, it was him.\u2018Left.\u2019After stabbing from its right, a goblin always attacked from the left next.Wham!-That hurts!The goblin\u2019s wooden spear hit Lou and fell.\u201cSqueeeakk!\u201d The goblin crouched in confusion to pick up its weapon, but Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t going to allow it.Thud!The goblin fell to the ground from Gi-Gyu\u2019s kick. It tried to get back up as it cried out, \u201cKirrk! Kirk!\u201dHowever, Gi-Gyu kicked the goblin\u2019s wooden spear away and held Lou with both of his hands.Pierce!Lou plunged into the goblin\u2019s heart.-That hurts![Lou is absorbing the goblin\u2019s blood.][Lou has gained experience points.][Lou has leveled up.][Lou\u2019s ability is increasing.]\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu laughed when he heard the system announcement.\u2018This must be what other players hear after leveling up.\u2019-It hurts\u2026 I said it hurts, you idiot!\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized and patted Lou gently.-That tickles! I said it tickles!\u201cFrom now on\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.-W-what?\"You\u2019re my number three treasure.\u201dThe top two spots were held by his mother and Yoo-Jung.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8. Lou (4)The rush his first kill today brought was unlike anything he had felt before. After the first came the second, the third, the fourth\u2026 Gi-Gyu was like a manic as he went on a killing spree. Lou\u2019s ability was something utterly beyond his wildest expectations.[Lou has leveled up.]Surprisingly, Gi-Gyu could feel every level Lou gained. Every time Lou leveled up, Gi-Gyu\u2019s stamina recovered as if he had the best night\u2019s sleep. He was so focused on his hunt that he couldn\u2019t even tell how much time had passed.\u201cSqueeeakk!\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s five years of experience and Lou\u2019s outstanding abilities worked in sync and maxed out his efficiency, significantly bringing down the hunting time. Now, he could kill a goblin with a single strike, two at most. He was growing at a speed way above what any average novice player could even dream of.During his hunt, Gi-Gyu suddenly became curious. He asked, \u201cHey, \u2018Lou!\u2019 Are there other Egos out there?\u201d-Y-you\u2019re already thinking about throwing me away?Lou asked in a shaky voice. It still addressed Gi-Gyu informally, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t think it was necessary to scold this godsend item for it. Besides, Lou was no longer acting as rudely as before. Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cRelax. You don\u2019t have to be so anxious while talking to me from now on.\u201d-T-thanks, Master!If there were other Egos like Lou, perhaps Gi-Gyu could become even stronger if he obtained them. Lou alone was enough to give him hope, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling greedy. He was about to ask Lou again, but it seemed there was no need to voice his question. Lou answered before Gi-Gyu could say a word.-If that\u2019s the case, I can tell you all about it! I\u2019m sure there are other Egos out there.\u201cYou can read my thoughts?\u201d-Sort of. After all, you and I are connected!\u201c...\u201d-???Gi-Gyu coughed and asked Lou again, \u201cAnd the same player system applies to those other Egos, right?\u201d-I don\u2019t think so.This piqued Gi-Gyu\u2019s curiosity, so he asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d-There are many Egos out there, but they can\u2019t access the system unless they are linked. Without it, they\u2019re just good items and nothing more.\u201cAre you saying there are other players who can link with Egos?\u201dLinking was supposed to be Gi-Gyu\u2019s unique ability, but it wouldn\u2019t be so unique if everyone could do that, now would it?-I don\u2019t know. But I think some might force a link or use some absorption skill to create a similar result.\u201cIs there anything you know for certain?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in frustration. After all the uncertain data Lou provided, Gi-Gyu was sure of one thing: Lou can grow by taking the experience points Gi-Gyu earned. \u00a0Essentially, this was a symbiotic relationship between Gi-Gyu, a player who can\u2019t level up, and Lou, an Ego. What frustrated Gi-Gyu was the sheer lack of knowledge Lou had of its own kind. This meant it was now Gi-Gyu\u2019s job to figure out the answers as he went.Suddenly, he began to wonder if another player could steal Lou if they had the skill to force-link. Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cThere are so many things I need to figure out.\u201dIt seemed he had to collect much information about his newfound ability, but Gi-Gyu was actually fine with it. The sole fact that he could now grow and improve was enough to please him. Technically, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t level up himself, but Lou\u2019s growth essentially belonged to him. Wasn\u2019t this exactly what he had been about ever since he became a player?\u2018Looks like I\u2019ll have to spend some time looking into this matter.\u2019***For the next several days, Gi-Gyu frequented the Tower to get used to his new weapon and level up Lou. He also had to adjust to his own body since its strength was increasing rapidly.Gi-Gyu also informed Tae-Shik that he might no longer work as a guide. Gi-Gyu\u2019s new ability to level up pleased Tae-Shik immensely since he seemed genuinely happy when he congratulated Gi-Gyu. Tae-Shik was what you would call a good friend, and Gi-Gyu was grateful that he had one.[Lou has leveled up.]\u201cAlready?\u201d Gi-Gyu looked down at the red sword in his hand with confusion: Lou was already at Level 4.-Hehe!That laugh was all the proof one needed to understand Lou enjoyed his progress a bit too much. Ignoring the giggling child, Gi-Gyu opened Lou\u2019s status screen.[Lou][Level 4][Power: 4][Speed: 4][Stamina: 4][Magic: 4][Accessory: Disabled]\u201cBy the way, what is \u2018accessory?\u2019\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. He hadn\u2019t even tried to use this ability since he was too busy hunting monsters. And\u2026 also because casting a skill required a lot of energy.-I don\u2019t know!The answer had not a shred of shame or guilt.Unimpressed and unsurprised, Gi-Gyu began to organize his thoughts based on what he knew so far and lamented, \u201cGosh, he is an idiot. Well, I guess we can try using it later.\u201d\u2018But damn is he leveling up quick. And even his other stats are leveling up alongside his overall level.\u2019It was surprising because all players got a varied increase in stat points with each level up. A majority experienced an increase in a specific stat; a minority experienced an even stats increase. \u00a0It seemed that Lou\u2019s increase in stats was very consistent. Each level up added a single point to all his stats.\u2018I wonder why...\u2019Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand, but he knew this wasn\u2019t a bad thing. After this brief incident, he resumed walking; it was time to ascend to the fourth floor.***\u201cChweeeeeeeeek!!!!!!!!\u201d Gi-Gyu pierced an orc\u2019s heart with Lou, and its green blood stained the red sword. He had hunted countless orcs so far, but this hunt was different.\u2018What is this?\u2019He retrieved Lou and tried to wipe away the blood, but the green liquid enveloped the sword like sticky jelly.[Lou is absorbing the orc\u2019s blood.][The amount of orc\u2019s blood absorbed has exceeded the designated amount.][Lou is leveling up.][Lou is absorbing the orc\u2019s strength.]\u201cHuh?\u201d-I-I\u2019m becoming stronger!\u201cWhat?\u201dThe green blood shone before Lou absorbed it completely. Then, Lou abruptly began pulsating.Badum, badum\u2026Lou\u00a0was pulsating like a beating heart. Gi-Gyu could feel the pulse on his hands and exclaimed, \u201cWhat is happening?!\u201dThankfully, the perimeter was clear since he had already killed all the monsters around. Gi-Gyu quickly opened Lou\u2019s status screen.[Lou][Level 5][Power: 7][Speed: 5][Stamina: 5][Magic: 5][Accessory: Disabled]Lou\u2019s status screen changed a bit when he became Level 5. At Level 5, its Power stat should\u2019ve had five points, but it actually had seven.\u2018Why?\u2019Was it because Lou absorbed the orc\u2019s power just like the system announced? Unfortunately, Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t given much of a chance to ponder. Now, something about Lou felt different.-Muahahahaha!!! Listen, Master, I\u2019m stronger now, so you shall be punished for tormenting me!Apart from getting second-hand embarrassment, Gi-Gyu also felt a bit lost in his thoughts. He wondered if Lou\u2019s could now unlink itself after absorbing the orc\u2019s power. Did this mean it could attack Gi-Gyu without any repercussion? Gi-Gyu stared at Lou tensely. For now, nothing was happening other than the pulsation.Could it be that Lou was mistaken? If it did, then\u2026***-Argh! I\u2019m sorry!Whoosh!-Please! I don\u2019t know why I said that!\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed.-Please! Please, Master! Master!Gi-Gyu stopped swinging Lou above the bonfire.-Phew\u2026 That was too hot. I thought I was gonna die.\u201cSo why did you say something like that?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.Lou\u2019s threat scared Gi-Gyu at first, but it seemed that it was just an empty threat. Gi-Gyu had dropped the sword a few minutes ago and watched it from afar for any changes. However, Lou failed to do squat apart from trash talking.In the end, Gi-Gyu picked up Lou and taught it some manners all over again. He threatened, \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to stick some meat on you and cook it.\u201d-I-I said I\u2019m sorry! I just felt dizzy and happy and\u2026\u201cWere you drunk?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.The system announced that Lou had absorbed more blood than designated, so perhaps monster blood acted like alcohol to \u201cLou.\u201d\u2018I guess that makes sense.\u2019By now, Gi-Gyu had figured out that Lou gained extra points in power because it absorbed the orc\u2019s blood and gained its strength. Did this mean every time Lou absorbed some monster\u2019s blood over the designated amount, the stat relevant to that specific monster would level up significantly?Just thinking about it wasn\u2019t going to give him the answer. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll have to test out my theory.\u201d-Hehe\u2026 S-sorry!Gi-Gyu patted Lou without a word.-Hehe\u2026***[The amount of goblin\u2019s blood absorbed has exceeded the designated amount.][Lou is leveling up.][Lou has gained the goblin\u2019s speed.]\u201cI knew it!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed confidently.-It\u2019s happening again! I\u2019m getting stronger!Without even picking up the dead goblin\u2019s crystal, Gi-Gyu opened Lou\u2019s status screen.[Lou][Level 6][Power: 8][Speed: 8][Stamina: 6][Magic: 6][Accessory: Disabled]\u201cYay!\u201d Gi-Gyu swung Lou around wildly, unable to control his joy.-I\u2019m dizzy, you idiot master.Ignoring Lou\u2019s insult, Gi-Gyu began to organize his thoughts. He felt confident about a few things based on what had just happened. Hunting monsters and feeding Lou their blood increased the sword\u2019s level. Atop that, once Lou absorbed an excess amount of blood from any type of monster, it could gain extra stat points based on the monster\u2019s ability.\u201cSo more blood means more strength\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured to himself.-Hey! You\u2019re my stupid slave!Gi-Gyu felt certain of his findings. The goblin\u2019s blood could give Lou the goblin\u2019s speed, increasing the sword\u2019s speed stat. Gi-Gyu now knew precisely what he had to do.-Hey! You! Idiot! You must devote your soul to me right now\u2026But before that, it seemed Gi-Gyu had to teach Lou some good manners again.***\u201cWow, that guy is hunting goblins again!\u201d a guide from some guild exclaimed.\u201cDoesn\u2019t he get tired?\u201d another guild asked in awe.The guides of a guild were escorting their new recruits in the Tower when they spotted Gi-Gyu. The novice players were also curious about this man with the red sword, so they said, \u201cWow! Who is that guy?\u201d\u201cHe must be really strong. That goblin just melted away!\u201d another player joined in.The player with the red sword was hunting a horde of goblins at an incredible speed. Such a sight shocked the beginner players. It almost seemed like he was carrying out a massacre.\u201cHe used to be a famous guide; now, he\u2019s known for massacring goblins and orcs,\u201d one guide explained.\u201cI know, right? It\u2019s as if he has a deep-rooted grudge against goblins and orcs,\u201d another guide added.\u201cWow!\u201d the third guide exclaimed in awe. The man with the red sword was a subject of wonder even to experienced guides.One of the novice players asked, \u201cWhat level do you think he is?\u201d\u201cProbably over 10,\u201d one of the guides answered.\u201cThen, what is he doing on this floor?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Maybe he really holds a grudge against this floor\u2019s monsters,\u201d a guide guessed.The head guide interrupted the conversation and announced, \u201cListen! You need to focus now. Stop staring, and let\u2019s keep working. All players can grow into fighters just like him. You need to work hard to become like him, understand?\u201dThe guild guides led the players bypassing Gi-Gyu, who continued to swing his red sword. Even as the beginner players walked by, they couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Gi-Gyu.***Gi-Gyu hunted in the Tower like a lunatic for a long time. Usually, he brought food and a tent to stay days at a time. He only left the Tower if he ran out of food or if his bag was overflowing with crystals.Some guild guides nicknamed Gi-Gyu the \u201cpersistent hunter.\u201d Any player who knew even a little about Gi-Gyu believed he had lost his mind after he finally began to level up. But Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t care what other people said about him. There was only one reason he chose not to ascend to the higher floors even though he could.[Lou][Level 7][Power: 18][Speed: 18][Stamina: 7][Magic: 7][Accessory: Disabled]\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered. He couldn\u2019t believe his own eyes. The amount of experience needed to level up increased along with the level. On the other hand, the monsters on the tutorial floors didn\u2019t offer much experience points. Despite this, Lou already reached Level 7. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t tell how many goblins and orcs he sacrificed to get this far. It felt like his whole body reeked of monster blood.-Hehe\u2026\u201cGood job,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and caressed Lou gently. Thanks to Gi-Gyu\u2019s repeated manner lessons, Lou learned to retain its wits better after absorbing excessive blood. It seemed that pain really did cure all bad manners.-Kekekeh! I love you, Master.This was how Lou reacted nowadays when he became drunk.\u201cI wonder how strong I am now,\u201d Gi-Gyu wondered. He couldn\u2019t tell the extent of his own strength anymore. Nowadays, orcs and goblins were nothing more than easy kills to him. Only one or two swings of Lou were enough to kill them. This was a huge change considering Gi-Gyu could barely kill a single goblin a few days ago.\u201cLet\u2019s go home now,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced. What he had accomplished on the tutorial floors was astounding. His bag was, once again, swamped with crystals. Now, it was time to rest a little and get ready. He had to prepare himself to ascend the Tower as a real player.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9. The F-Class Gate (1)After leaving the Tower,\u00a0Gi-Gyu headed toward the Player Association\u2019s Seoul office to get paid. A massive crimson sword would\u2019ve caught the eyes of all onlookers; strangely, no one gave Gi-Gyu an extra glance.-Master! Master!\u2018What is it?\u2019-It\u2019s so nice to be outside!Currently, Lou was in an accessory form because it was tired of the Tower and its sword form. It adorned Gi-Gyu\u2019s index finger in the shape of a snake-shaped ring. This was the first time he used Lou's accessory function, and he was happy with it.\u2018Nice design too.\u2019Thanks to this ability, it was easy for him to hide and carry Lou outside the Tower. He could quickly transform it back to its red sword form whenever he needed it.-Hehe\u2026Gi-Gyu stroked the ring as Lou giggled.\u2018When he acts insolent, I want to beat the crap out of him. But when he acts like this, he\u2019s quite adorable.\u2019-Master! I can hear you!They bickered until he reached the payment office. There, Gi-Gyu dumped the bagful of crystals on the counter.\u201cWow! Even today, your haul is as bountiful as ever,\u201d the office cashier commented in surprise. Gi-Gyu and the cashier could be considered acquaintances since he saw her almost daily. She asked, \u201cWhat happened? You used to bring a single crystal; now this?\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t answer her question. The cashier didn\u2019t mind and quickly handed him the receipt. But when he saw it, he asked her with surprise, \u201cHuh? The amount here\u2014\u201d\u201cThe market quote for crystals has plummeted recently. After the Angela Guild ascended to the 75th floor, we received an overabundant number of crystals.\u201dDemand and supply: Everything, in a way, depended on it. The amount Gi-Gyu earned today wasn\u2019t small, but that didn\u2019t mean he had to be happy with the pay. Getting paid less for the same amount of work was no one\u2019s sweet spot.\u2018Now that I think about it, I haven\u2019t watched Player News in a while.\u2019Every night, for five years, he watched the player channel, but that changed last month. Last month, his priorities changed a bit. Gi-Gyu requested, \u201cPlease deposit the full amount to my account in the player\u2019s bank.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d the cashier replied.Holding the receipt, Gi-Gyu turned around.\u2018Gotta find out what happened in the outside world while I was under my rock.\u2019With a purpose in mind, Gi-Gyu headed toward Tae-Shik\u2019s office.***\u201cHuh?\u201d When Gi-Gyu arrived, he saw that the guide department office had been turned into a storage room. The sofa he used to sit on was still there, but the rest of the place was filled with boxes. He couldn\u2019t find any traces of Tae-Shik or the other players.\u201cKim Gi-Gyu?\u201d someone said his name.\u201cHuh? Ah, Tae-Oh.\u201d When Gi-Gyu turned around, he saw Tae-Oh standing behind him. Tae-Oh asked, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? The guide department was disbanded while you were busy leveling up.\u201d\u201cReally? Oh! I guess I\u2019ve been too busy recently,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. For the last few days, he had been treating the Tower\u2019s tutorial levels as his home, only leaving to stock up and sell crystals. He had been so busy that he didn\u2019t get to visit Tae-Shik; consequently, he never got the news about the guide department.Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cSo I guess it\u2019s finally gone.\u201d\u201cIt happened about two weeks ago. You\u2019re here to see Team Leader Oh Tae-Shik\u2014no! I should be calling him General Manager now,\u201d Tae-Oh said.\u201cGeneral Manager?\u201d\u201cAfter the guide department was disbanded, Oh Tae-Shik was reassigned as the gate maintenance department\u2019s general manager,\u201d Tae-Oh explained. Gi-Gyu always knew Tae-Shik was too good to be stuck in the guide department, but he didn\u2019t expect this kind of a promotion. General manager? It seemed Tae-Shik was more talented than Gi-Gyu thought.Tae-Oh offered, \u201cI was on my way to the gate maintenance department, so I can take you there if you want.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered and followed Tae-Oh. On the way, it became quite apparent that Tae-Oh had heard all the rumors regarding Gi-Gyu, the guy whom no one saw recently. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, Tae-Oh chatted nonstop about what he had heard.\u2018Has Tae-Oh always been this chatty?\u2019Gi-Gyu always thought Tae-Oh was a quiet guy; for some reason, it seemed Tae-Oh\u2019s general mood had lightened.\u2018I guess this is a good thing.\u2019Gi-Gyu decided to chalk it up as some recent headway in Tae-Oh\u2019s life. Suddenly, he heard Tae-Oh calling his name, \u201cGi-Gyu?\u201d\u201cOh, sorry. I was thinking about something else,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized.\u201cI\u2019m joining a guild soon,\u201d Tae-Oh announced.\u201cA guild?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYeah. It\u2019s not a really famous one, but it\u2019s a pretty decent guild,\u201d Tae-Oh explained. Perhaps this was why he had lightened up since the last time Gi-Gyu saw him. Tae-Oh continued, \u201cIt\u2019s a medium-sized guild called the Caravan Guild. They had been trying really hard to recruit me and even offered some unbelievable perks.\u201d\u201cCongrats, Tae-Oh.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s you who should be congratulated. Congratulations on leveling up! So what happened exactly?\u201d Tae-Oh asked with curiosity.\u201cOh, well\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu hesitated for a moment while he organized his thoughts. He then explained, \u201cIt just happened after I passed the fifth-floor test.\u201d\u201cReally? I guess you never know what might happen in the Tower! I mean, the fact that you couldn\u2019t level up was bizarre, to begin with, right? Anyway, congratulations, Tutorial Slayer,\u201d Tae-Oh congratulated him teasingly.\u201cTutorial Slayer?\u201d Gi-Gyu had never heard this term before, so he asked in confusion.\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t even know your own nickname? After seeing the one-sided massacre you\u2019ve been bringing down on the tutorial monsters, everyone just agreed to call you that. Many newbies even consider you their idol. They said you look so amazing when you round up the monsters and kill them all at once,\u201d Tae-Oh explained.\u201cReally?\u201d A slight blush appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face. It was such a corny nickname, but this was the first time he had gotten one. Gi-Gyu had to admit that he wasn\u2019t unhappy about it.Tae-Oh added, \u201cYeah. So keep up the good work. I know your life has been tough, so I\u2019m sure more good things will happen to you.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dThe duo soon arrived at the maintenance department\u2019s entrance. Tae-Oh left after a quick farewell, and Gi-Gyu was greeted by someone else.\u201cHey! There\u2019s our Tutorial Slayer!\u201d Standing against a wall and holding a mug, Tae-Shik waved at Gi-Gyu.\u201cS-stop that!\u201d Gi-Gyu shushed him in embarrassment. The nickname itself wasn\u2019t the problem; where it was being said was. The maintenance office was huge and filled with people. So, when Tae-Shik yelled out his greeting and waved, everyone there stared at Gi-Gyu.\u201cThat guy is the Tutorial Slayer?\u201d one office worker whispered.\u201cYeah. He used to be the longest standing guide here, but I heard he began to climb the Tower recently,\u201d another worker explained.\u201cHuh? So he didn\u2019t ascend to the higher floors before?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard he couldn\u2019t because he couldn\u2019t level up,\u201d someone else chimed in.Like an animal in the zoo, Gi-Gyu could hear and feel everyone talking about him.\u2018So I guess people here have heard about me.\u2019Gi-Gyu lowered his head to hide his burning face and walked up to Tae-Shik.\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d Gi-Gyu argued.\u201cHahaha, isn\u2019t it funny? You used to be the eternal Level 1 guide; now, you\u2019ve gotten strong enough to get a nickname! Enjoy your fame, dude,\u201d Tae-Shik teased Gi-Gyu.\u201cGosh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed.It had been almost a month since they last saw each other. Tae-Shik seemed happy to see Gi-Gyu since his wide smile never became just a smile. With a playful smile, Tae-Shik offered, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my office for now. There is so much to talk about.\u201d***\u201cHave a seat, Gi-Gyu,\u201d Tae-Shik offered.\u201cGuess you got a promotion,\u201d Gi-Gyu commented. Tae-Shik\u2019s private office wasn\u2019t overly big, but it looked luxurious. It certainly couldn\u2019t compare to the dingy office Tae-Shik used to have in the guide department.Tae-Shik asked, \u201cHow have you been?\u201d\u201cFine. I\u2019ve been so busy hunting that I never got a chance to visit you. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I understand,\u201d Tae-Shik replied.After a short mundane chat, Gi-Gyu finally asked, \u201cSo I guess the guide department is really gone, huh?\u201d\u201cYes, the association decided to dump it,\u201d Tae-Shik explained.\u201cBut I still feel disappointed. I worked there for so long\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll create your own guild someday,\u201d Tae-Shik teased. They both chuckled before Tae-Shik asked with a sober face, \u201cI suppose you haven\u2019t been keeping up with the news about the players?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, everything went bananas, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. This was why he came to visit Tae-Shik, so he listened intently as Tae-Shik explained, \u201cAngela succeeded in ascending to the 75th floor. There were some casualties, but it was definitely worth it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cBut the problem is\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik hesitated, unable to hide how sad he was. Gi-Gyu waited quietly, and Tae-Shik continued, \u201cIt\u2019s about that gate in the US.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. He remembered it was an S-Class Gate, but the US surely had enough resources to close it. However, to Gi-Gyu\u2019s shock, Tae-Shik said, \u201cOver four high rankers have died.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu gasped, unable to believe what he had just heard.Four high rankers. The death of four high rankers was a burdensome revelation. Tae-Shik continued, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t your average S-Class Gate. In the end, the US added more rankers, and the gate was successfully closed, but even those players didn\u2019t get out without a scratch.\u201d\u201cOh my god\u2026 How?\u201d Gi-Gyu gasped in shock as Tae-Shik added, \u201cThere is an even bigger problem now. A kind of exceptional gate has been appearing in other countries as well.\u201d\u201cAn exceptional gate?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. For example, it would seem like an F-Class, but it would turn out to be a C-Class Gate once a player enters it. Some even have an impossible structure inside. All in all, these new Gates have exceptional and unexpected qualities; thus, the name,\u201d Tae-Shik explained. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his confusion. Since the Tower and the Gates appeared 23 years ago, the world has experienced consistency. So why were all of these sudden changes occurring now?Tae-Shik warned, \u201cSo you shouldn\u2019t enter any gates for a while, Gi-Gyu. You need to be patient.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t enter forever. As a player, you\u2019ll have to enter a gate at some point, but I think it would be best to avoid it during such a difficult time,\u201d Tae-Shik implored.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d When Gi-Gyu agreed, Tae-Shik nodded in relief. Gi-Gyu felt a little guilty because he had indeed been considering entering a gate. There were a few advantages to closing a gate. The crystals found inside the gates were finer, making them worth much more. In addition, the player responsible for closing a gate was given a special reward. There were even rumors that some special gates gave items that could increase a player\u2019s abilities.Lastly, one couldn\u2019t ignore the prize money that came with it. The amount varied depending on the class; sometimes, the player could even get a bonus. These perks were why the players, who valued their lives, were willing to enter the dangerous gates.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cGood. Now, do you want to have lunch with me?\u201d Tae-Shik asked as he checked his watch. It was already lunchtime. It has been so long since he spent time with Tae-Shik that Gi-Gyu wanted to say yes; unfortunately, he had to shake his head.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI need to go home. I haven\u2019t seen Yoo-Jung and Mother for about a month now.\u201d\u201cOf course. Yoo-Jung has been really worried about you,\u201d Tae-Shik replied and nodded in understanding.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u201cAlright, Gi-Gyu.\u201d***\u201cOppa! Here is your coffee,\u201d Yoo-Jung offered.\u201cThanks,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied gratefully. He returned straight home after he met Tae-Shik. He was filthy after his month-long stay in the Tower, but Yoo-Jung still hugged him tightly when he arrived. After greeting his mother and eating lunch, Gi-Gyu stared at his phone.\u201cHmm... Not this one,\u201d he murmured. Gi-Gyu was searching the internet for a gate he could enter and hunt.\u2018It might be dangerous, but I still have to hunt inside to pay off our family\u2019s debt quickly. The interest rate on it has been killing me.\u2019According to Tae-Shik, the Gates were becoming increasingly dangerous lately, but the chance of Gi-Gyu ending up in one of those exceptional Gates had to be slim. And besides, if he felt it was too dangerous to go alone, he could find a group to join. This was precisely why he was looking through the website that posted available hunting groups.\u201cThis gate sounds too dangerous,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. So far, he hadn\u2019t been able to find a group that planned on entering a gate that sounded safe. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t level up in the past, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t learn. He knew a few criteria that made a gate perfect for a first-timer based on what he had learned. He was looking for a gate that satisfied these conditions, but there seemed to be none that sounded acceptable.\u201cThe number of available hunting groups definitely decreased,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.Back when he was a guide, he used to look through this site for fun. He remembered seeing so many more hunting groups needing new members back then. But now, there seemed to be only three pages of them on the website.\u2018I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be that dangerous.\u2019Then suddenly, one of the posts stood out to Gi-Gyu.-Planning on hunting inside the F-Class Gate in Guri City. Dealers are welcome.010-XXX-XXXXGi-Gyu exclaimed, \u201cFound one!\u201d This gate wasn\u2019t too far from his home, and it was an F-Class. This particular gate was a sustainable type, and Gi-Gyu was also happy with the group members. He quickly called the number listed on the ad.\u201cHello? Yes, okay. See you soon. Yoo-Jung, I\u2019m going out!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled.\u201cHuh? Where are you going?!\u201d Yoo-Jung asked in surprise.\u201cGangnam!\u201d Gi-Gyu answered, put on his jacket, and left home quickly.***\u201cHello,\u201d Gi-Gyu greeted the man in the cafe who seemed to be the leader of the hunting group. The man replied, \u201cNice to meet you. My name is Ha Song-Su.\u201d\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. They sat down and began to talk about the dungeons. Ha Song-Su asked, \u201cDo you have any experience in hunting inside a gate?\u201d\u201cNo, this will be my first time. But I\u2019m familiar with attack strategies and other patterns,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered. There were two types of gates: single-shot and sustainable. A single-shot gate was special because it offered many rewards, but it disappeared once cleared. On the other hand, a sustained gate didn\u2019t disappear even after being cleared. In fact, after a certain amount of time, it regenerated and allowed the same hunt to be carried out repeatedly. Since the master plan for sustained gates was often well known, hunting in these gates was much less dangerous. However, the reward was accordingly less attractive.\u2018But my share of crystals and the experience points should be worth it.\u2019The gate this hunting group was interested in was a sustained type. Song-Su asked, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you only passed the first test recently. Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cThen shall we draw up a contract?\u201d Song-Su asked.\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded without hesitation. Only groups with a long history or those that belonged to a guild skipped this legality. For all the rest, a contract was necessary in case of a dispute over the rewards. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for the members to fight among themselves, especially if a reward included an equipment item.Gi-Gyu read over the papers Song-Su offered.\u2018It seems pretty standard.\u2019It was definitely a simple contract. All the rewards were to be divided equally among the players, and a deposit was requested in case of absenteeism or unexpected behavior. And in the case of an equipment item, the member who draws the highest number from a dice was to take it.Gi-Gyu commented, \u201cIt all sounds very standard.\u201d\u201cWill you sign it then?\u2019 Song-Su asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered. When they completed the contract, Ha Song-Su stood up and explained, \u201cWe\u2019ll all meet at Guri Station the day after tomorrow at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Please don\u2019t be late.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dA sustained gate usually belonged to a guild or the association. A reservation was necessary to hunt in these gates, which meant that the group couldn\u2019t be late. After agreeing on the particularities, Ha Song-Su left the cafe first, and Gi-Gyu left soon after.It was now time for Gi-Gyu to prepare for his first hunt inside a gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10. The F-Class Gate (2)Gi-Gyu had to prepare for tomorrow, and the remaining hours of the day were his only companions. After the meeting, he became a literal example of the word \"post-haste\". He knew the perfect spot to maximize his growth; now, he only wished to get there the very next second. He murmured, \u201cI have to hunt as much as I can before I\u2019ve to leave for home.\u201dGi-Gyu and the sixth floor were still strangers to each other since he had been engrossed with hunting the monsters on the tutorial levels. Now, Lou had struck a wall: regardless of how many they killed, Lou\u2019s speed and power refused to increase. So, he had to quickly ascend to the higher floors and hunt some new monsters.\u2018I\u2019ll surely repay the debt once I become stronger.\u2019Gi-Gyu had been hunting for a long time on the fourth floor, but he never\u00a0saw its guardian again. And it wasn\u2019t because someone else captured it. The guardian forced Gi-Gyu into entering the fifth floor; after becoming strong enough, he planned on repaying the favor at first sight.\u201cAfter all, I only became stronger thanks to that guardian\u2026 Lou! Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.-Ugh! You\u2019re so childish.\u201cYou\u2019re the childish one here. I\u2019ve never met a bigger ass than you, jerk,\u201d Gi-Gyu bickered.Floors above the fifth were easier to ascend since they all had portals for convenient transportation. However, a player could only use portals to the floors they had visited previously.And Gi-Gyu was currently rushing toward the fifth-floor landmark.***\u201cSo this is the landmark.\u201dGi-Gyu had been here before; back then, he was unconscious. This was, in a way, his first time here since he couldn\u2019t even remember if he was assward or facefirst back then.\u201cThere's pretty much a city here.\u201dThe fifth-floor landmark was essentially an entire city.\u00a0A landmark existed on each floor, starting at the fifth floor. These landmarks were created by players from all over the world as a place to rest. Landmarks could have anything from well-furnished buildings to teetering cabanas. The landmarks on the tutorial floors were more developed because there weren\u2019t any dangerous monsters around.\u201cI should just get right to the battles,\u201d Gi-Gyu told himself. He had to get as many experience points as he could get before entering the Gate tomorrow. So, Gi-Gyu made his way toward the sixth floor without sightseeing: there would always be time for that in the future.***Gi-Gyu had already researched the path between the fifth and sixth floors beforehand, so he was on the sixth floor before long. The monster that appeared on the sixth floor were lizardmen.\u201cWhen was I this nervous before?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. This was the first time he was hunting a monster besides orcs and goblins. The Lizardmen were going to be a new beginning for him, a step up for Gi-Gyu as a player.\u201cCreak! Creak!!!\u201d a lizardman screamed with its strange voice. Its scimitar was so rusted that even a small knick from it was enough to give tetanus.\u2018I\u2019m so glad I already got the tetanus booster. Then again, everyone said lizardmen are pretty easy to hunt.\u2019One of Gi-Gyu\u2019s past customers, who later became his good friend, used to tell him about the different floors and their monsters. He visited Gi-Gyu sometimes and talked about effective ways to hunt the various creatures roaming the many floors. He was a good man who wanted to tell Gi-Gyu about the things Gi-Gyu himself couldn\u2019t experience at the time. That player was a talented hunter, skilled enough to take a shot at becoming a ranker; unfortunately, he died while trying to hunt a guardian.\u2018I\u2019ve to be smart about this and only hunt the guardians when I'm completely ready.\u2019His friend\u2019s death saddened him, but Gi-Gyu learned a valuable lesson from it.Gi-Gyu remembered what his friend told him about hunting a lizardman.\u2018He said that I should attack its waist to imbalance it.\u2019-Oh! Another hunt!\u2018Be quiet!\u2019The ring on his finger was already transforming back into the red sword. Lou seemed excited at the prospect of hunting the lizardman. Gi-Gyu obliged by gripping the sword with both of his hands and charging forward.\u201cCreeeek! Creeeek!\u201dClank!The lizardman\u2019s rusted scimitar and Lou met with a sharp noise.Slash!\u201cHuh?\u201dAnd just like that, Lou cut through the corroded scimitar.\u201cCreek!\u201d the lizardman shrieked as Lou sliced its shoulder and left a trail of green blood.\u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed in shock. He had witnessed Lou cut through the orcs\u2019 and goblins\u2019 weapons like a hot knife through butter; unexpectedly, even the sixth-floor lizardmen failed to challenge this now-reformed bratty sword.\u2018Guess I don\u2019t even need to keep the proper hunting strategy for this floor in mind.\u2019With a bright smile on his face, Gi-Gyu dashed toward the lizardman.***Guri Station.Ha Song-Su and his group members were waiting for Gi-Gyu at the station. Song-Su greeted Gi-Gyu, \u201cThank god you got here on time.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cWe\u2019ll leave immediately then,\u201d Song-Su announced. Gi-Gyu was barely on time. He only had two minutes to spare till the set time, which must\u2019ve been why Ha Song-Su didn\u2019t look too happy. But thankfully, he didn\u2019t say anything about it.\u2018I\u2019m glad I cleaned off the blood before I came.\u2019Gi-Gyu had been busy hunting until the very last minute. He only made it because Lou reminded him of the time. It was considered bad manners to hunt right before a group Gate hunt. If a player spent too much energy beforehand, he could feel drained during the group hunt and put the other members in danger.Gi-Gyu knew this very well, but he had been so focused on hunting that he forgot about time. Besides, thanks to Lou\u2019s improved stamina, he didn\u2019t feel tired at all.***Before long, the hunting party stood in front of the Gate.Ha Song-Su made the payment at the entrance, \u201cHere is the admission fee.\u201d\u201cHa Song-Su and the group of five, right?\u201d the admission cashier asked.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI wish you good luck in clearing the Gate safely,\u201d the admission cashier said to the group and stepped aside. The Gate they were entering today belonged to the association, so the cashier had to be the doorkeeper sent by the association.\u201cBefore you begin, I\u2019ll explain the rules once more. You must follow my orders without question. Since we must clear the Gate within our reserved time, we\u2019re going to move quickly,\u201d Song-Su announced.\u201cAlright,\u201d Gi-Gyu and the rest of the group answered together. It seemed the other players also found this group online. They were all acting awkward around each other, not a good sign.The blue Gate began to shake. This was the first time Gi-Gyu was seeing one up close; he was mesmerized by it.\u2018It looks very different from the floor doors in the Tower, but it\u2019s still very beautiful.\u2019It was indeed beautiful. Inside the Gate could be a living hell; at least, its entrance was lovely.\u201cIs this your first time entering a Gate?\u201d one of the members with an unknown name asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cYes.\u201d The man smirked at Gi-Gyu\u2019s answer.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu narrowed his eyes as he watched his group entering the Gate one by one. Soon, it was his turn, so Gi-Gyu jumped into the blue Gate.***[You have entered the Gate.]\u2018So this is the Gate.\u2019Soggy air stabbed at Gi-Gyu\u2019s nose.\u201cCheck your equipment before going forward. It\u2019s going to get darker inside, so please light your torches,\u201d Song-Su announced.Crackle\u2026 Blaze!Everyone brought out their own torchlights.\u2018I guess it takes a special kind of man to become a group leader.\u2019They were about to hunt inside the easiest class Gate, yet Ha Song-Su seemed very thorough. He checked each member carefully and then designated different roles based on the members\u2019 talents. It seemed Ha Song-Su had already studied the group members before he came here today.\u201cNow, we\u2019ll get going!\u201d Song-Su announced, and the group began to move.\u2018Thank goodness. This doesn\u2019t look like one of those exceptional Gates.\u2019As he walked, Gi-Gyu realized the Gate\u2019s interior and the description he had heard of it matched to a tee. Relief washed over him now that he thought this was an ordinary Gate. Excitement and glee weren\u2019t too far behind as he pated himself for fearlessly making this attempt.His group formed a triangle with the tanker Song Byung-Hoon at the front. The second row included Gi-Gyu and a player who belonged to the close combat category. Behind them were the group leader Ha Song-Su and a female player.\u2018Does Song-Su know that woman?\u2019Ha Song-Su clearly didn\u2019t like getting close to any of the members, but he kept the female player close by for some reason.***The group paused not too long after they began because they could feel a monster nearby.\u201cGet ready,\u201d at Ha Song-Su\u2019s command, all the players stopped. He announced, \u201cA zombie has been spotted in our perimeters. Prepare for a battle.\u201dAll the players, including Gi-Gyu, gripped their weapons tighter. Ha Song-Su quickly returned to his position and nocked an arrow. He requested, \u201cTanker! Please lead the aggro hard.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHa Song-Su\u2019s arrow left its bow at an almost unreal pace.Whoosh!The arrow\u2019s shrill whistling sound struck everyone\u2019s ears and left a resounding echo.Stab!The shrill whistle was followed by the grotesque sound of an arrow piercing thick flesh.\u201cGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201dThe shrieking zombies attracted the nearby zombies, and they began swarming Gi-Gyu\u2019s group.\u201cHaaa!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon shouted to attract the zombies; consequently, the seemingly endless wave of zombies rushed toward his shield. Song-Su ordered, \u201cDealer!\u201dIt was finally Gi-Gyu\u2019s turn.-Let\u2019s kill them all!With Lou\u2019s excited cheer, Gi-Gyu twirled the sword and ran toward the zombies that were busy attacking the shield.Slash!\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cThe hell?!!!\u201dGi-Gyu, Song Byung-Hoon, and the other close combat dealer Choi Dae-Oh exclaimed in confusion.\u201cWhat the! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d one player asked in surprise, but before anyone could answer, Ha Song-Su screamed, \u201cFocus!\u201d Every member stopped gawking. They knew they couldn\u2019t forget the fact that they were in the middle of a battle.Everyone, including\u00a0Gi-Gyu, was confused because of what happened when Gi-Gyu swung his sword. He swung Lou once and ended up slaying four zombies like they were fragile wooden chopsticks.\u2018I better control my strength.\u2019Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand what happened exactly, but one thing was for certain: he didn\u2019t have to go all-out in this battle. Then, Lou beheaded a zombie with each relaxed swing. Thanks to Gi-Gyu\u2019s quick work, it didn\u2019t take the group long to finish the hunt.Ha Song-Su announced, \u201cWe\u2019ll take a quick break.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the members answered and sat down on the ground. They couldn\u2019t afford to use expensive potions for every injury, so it was important to regain strength naturally after every battle. If someone were wounded, they would\u2019ve watered down the potion and applied it. This was enough to heal the wound slowly over time.\u201cGi-Gyu, what the heck was that earlier?\u201d Song Byung-Hoon approached Gi-Gyu and asked.\u201cWow\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say you were only Level 7?\u201d Choi Dae-Oh also came by to ask. Choi Dae-Oh was the player who smirked at Gi-Gyu before entering the Gate. Obviously, he was older, but Gi-Gyu still didn\u2019t like how informally he talked.The two men continued to gush over Gi-Gyu. It made sense since Gi-Gyu\u2019s technique earlier was no doubt impressive.\u201cGi-Gyu must\u2019ve achieved some critical hits,\u201d Byung-Hoon guessed.\u201cOh, but that doesn\u2019t make sense. How can someone do that many critical hits consecutively?\u201d Dae-Oh asked in doubt.\u201cBut, oh man! When I heard this was your first time hunting inside the Gate, I was so worried. But now, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a smooth sail!\u201d Byung-Hoon exclaimed excitedly. Both men seemed thrilled at the prospect of an easy hunt. After all, having a powerful player in a group decreases the chances of death or dangerous situations.Gi-Gyu replied quietly, \u201cI just got lucky, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cOh, come on! This guy is humble too; let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s no such thing as a luck stat,\u201d Byung-Hoon flattered Gi-Gyu.\u201cYou don\u2019t look tired at all either.\u201d When Dae-Oh mentioned this with surprise, Gi-Gyu replied awkwardly, \u201cI-I guess not?\u201dSong Byung-Hoon and Choi Dae-Oh seemed ignorant of how uncomfortable they were making Gi-Gyu. When they continued to chat loudly, Ha Song-Su warned them, \u201cPlease be quiet. You can\u2019t let your guard down. We\u2019re still inside the Gate.\u201dThe warning quietened the noisy duo, but not completely. Song Byung-Hoon muttered, \u201cGosh! He\u2019s being so picky!\u201d Although he said this quietly, his voice rang because they were underground. Gi-Gyu glanced at Song-Su, but it seemed that Song-Su planned on ignoring Byung-Hoo.\u2018I\u2019 have to hide my abilities better.\u2019The unexpected source of power was creating a clear division between the group; it wasn\u2019t ideal for survival. Gi-Gyu pulled himself together since it was time for the group to continue.***\u201cI think this is a mid boss\u2019 room,\u201d Ha Song-Su stated.A metal fence was blocking their path, and they knew that crossing it would bring them face to face with the mid-boss. It was common knowledge that this Gate\u2019s mid-boss was a giant zombie, so the players began checking their stamina and equipment. Then, Ha Song-Su walked up to the fence, took out a small glass vial from his bag, and threw it at the metal fence.Shhhh, shhhhh\u2026\u2018Corrosion solution.\u2019The metal fence began to slowly melt away. Ha Song-Su warned the members, \u201cPlease be careful not to touch the corrosion solution.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the players answered.Cautiously, the members began crossing the fence using the small eroded hole. Gi-Gyu was the last one to cross; the fence repaired itself as soon as he did.\u2018The escape path has been sealed.\u2019Escaping the Gate was possible, but a player couldn\u2019t escape the mid-boss\u2019 or the boss\u2019 room. It was a life or death situation, meaning the players could only leave after killing the boss.\u201cGi-Gyu! Please take good care of us.\u201d Song Byung-Hoon winked at Gi-Gyu, who replied awkwardly, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d He had been trying to control his strength, but the zombies kept falling like twigs in front of him. By now, everyone believed Gi-Gyu lied about his level. They seemed to like the idea, and they did their best to flatter him.\u201cFocus!\u201d Ha Sung-Su yelled as a giant zombie appeared.[Gate\u2019s mid-boss, Giant Zombie, has appeared.]\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d the female player, who hadn\u2019t done much so far and remained close to Song-Su, groaned when she saw the giant zombie. The three-meter monster was covered in squirming worms trying to escape its body.\u201cKuooooo!\u201dThe players weren\u2019t given much time to feel disgusted because the giant zombie roared, causing the worms to fall on the ground. The battle was about to begin.\u201cHaaa!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon shouted to distract the monster. His aggro was followed by Ha Song-Su\u2019s fire arrow and the female player\u2019s magic attack.Thud!\u201cAck!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon groaned when the giant zombie slammed his shield. Byung-Hoon\u2019s arms began to shake visibly as he muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s too strong\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need to hang on a bit longer!\u201d Choi Dae-Oh rushed toward the giant zombie with his sword held high.Slash!A bunch of the zombie\u2019s worms fell to the ground with a gnarly sound. Unfortunately, the attack failed to deliver much damage to the giant zombie. Instead, it continued to slam on Song Byung-Hoon\u2019s shield.\u201cAckkk!!!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon screamed in pain.\u201cThink! The giant zombie\u2019s weaknesses are its neck and chest! Focus only on those two areas!\u201d Ha Song-Su screamed and continued shooting his fire arrows at the giant zombie\u2019s chest.Then, Gi-Gyu finally made his move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11. The F-Class Gate (3)Gi-Gyu planned on delivering a swift blow to the giant zombie\u2019s head, so he kicked the ground to jump. Maybe it was because his stomp wasn\u2019t strong enough or something else, but he didn\u2019t reach the giant zombie\u2019s head.\u201cDammit,\u201d Gi-Gyu swore. His initial plan was a bust, but he still wanted to use the remaining momentum to deliver all the damage he could. So, Gi-Gyu drove Lou into the giant zombie\u2019s shoulder before falling to the ground.Crack!The gash Lou made began spreading as the monster screamed in pain, \u201cGrrrrraaaa!!!\u201d\u201cNow!\u201d Ha Song-Su yelled, and the remaining members attacked the monster together in response. Even Song Byung-Hoon was now brandishing a sword and rending the giant zombie\u2019s leg.Fwooosh!Blaze!Now that the giant zombie was at its last leg, one of Ha Song-Su\u2019s fire arrows finally succeeded in setting the giant zombie on fire. The players felt encouraged by the sight and attacked with greater vigor.***Once the giant zombie fell, only the main boss remained between them and a successful clear. The group decided it was best to rest up as much as possible before going forward.\u201cUgh, never imagined I would share my dinner table with maggots one day,\u201d Song Byung-Ho murmured as he chewed on a piece of jerky. It had been quite a while since the group first entered the gate. This was a perfect time to eat and replenish their energy before hunting the boss monster.\u201cBut thanks to you, Gi-Gyu, we were able to finish it quickly. After we clear this gate, would you let me join your group?\u201d Song Byung-Hoon begged.\u00a0Gi-Gyu tried his best to look nonchalantly, but he couldn't help disliking Song Byung-Hoon and Choi Dae-Oh.\u2018Why would he say something like that in front of this group\u2019s leader?\u2019At this point, it wasn\u2019t even about lacking proper manners. The duo was obviously trying to disrespect Ha Song-Su. Had they been genuinely interested in working with Gi-Gyu, they would\u2019ve waited until they were alone with Gi-Gyu.\u2018I guess he\u2019s just ignoring them.\u2019Their antics actually made Gi-Gyu see Ha Song-Su in a positive light; his leadership and thoroughness were commendable, to say the least. He was also an excellent strategist and could put the right man in the right place. Ha Song-Su was still a low-level player, but if he joined one of the major guilds or became a ranker, Gi-Gyu had no doubt Song-Su would make a name for himself.\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to clear the gate much faster thanks to you, Gi-Gyu,\u201d another player complimented.\u201cTotally,\u201d agreed someone else.\u201cNot at all,\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head humbly, but he knew they were right. They were certainly making good time because he was making short work of everything that stood in their way. At this rate\u2026\u2018I guess I can use the extra time for some extra hunting. It should be okay, right?\u2019Whenever the main goal of a gate hunt was to catch the boss monster, the hunting group always took the shortest possible route. Being late was never an option because the gate schedule was always jam-packed. However, if you were left with some free time that you\u2019ve already paid for, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for players to use that for some extra monster hunting.\u2018Will the zombie blood enhance any of Lou\u2019s abilities?\u2019Perhaps\u00a0Lou hadn\u2019t absorbed enough zombie blood so far because Gi-Gyu hadn\u2019t heard any announcement from the system yet. But if he continued to hunt zombies, Lou was bound to gain something. Zombies only appeared in the gates, so this was Gi-Gyu\u2019s only chance to kill as many of them as possible. Had Gi-Gyu belonged to a guild or a hunting group, he could\u2019ve made somewhat regular trips to the different gates.-Ughhhh\u2026 Disgusting!\u2018You can taste too?\u2019-The zombie blood is bitter\u2026 So bitter.Pfft!Lou's complaint made Gi-Gyu laugh. The zombie blood must\u2019ve tasted horrible.\u201cNow! We just have the boss monster left. Please don\u2019t let your guard down,\u201d announced Ha Song-Su. Sadly, it failed to get a response from his teammates, especially Song Byung-Hoon and Choi Dae-Oh.\u201cYes!\u201d Gi-Gyu made a point of answering loudly; in the end, the two rude men quietly answered as well.***\u201cWhaa\u2026\u201d one player groaned.\u201cWow,\u201d another exclaimed in awe. The group stood in front of a giant metal fence that had to be at least five-story tall. It was also very thick, thicker than even a utility pole.\u201cThis is the boss\u2019 room,\u201d Ha Song-Su announced, and the group stopped in its tracks.\u2018Talon...\u2019This gate\u2019s boss was Talon, a giant ghoul, and only this fence stood between them.\u201cBy the way, was this metal fence built to keep Talon inside?\u00a0I wonder how these sustained gates really\u00a0work,\u201d Choi Dae-Oh said as he approached Gi-Gyu.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu, in turn, gave an offhanded reply and continued to stare at the fence.He had heard Talon was huge, but even then it was, at most, three humans stacked together big. That was certainly big, but not big enough to warrant such a fence.\u2018The Tower or the gates aren\u2019t like the dungeons in games. Every little thing here has to have a reason and a purpose.\u2019This was what Gi-Gyu believed. This was real life\u2014everything, no matter how huge or tiny, served a definite purpose. He believed that figuring out that purpose was the key to understanding the Tower\u2019s secrets.Choi Dae-Oh asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to check your equipment?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. He had been staring at the fence quietly all this while; after the reminder, he finally looked away. Then again, for Gi-Gyu, \u201cchecking equipment\u201d meant asking Lou a simple question.\u2018How\u2019s your condition?\u2019-Excellent!Gi-Gyu was having a small conversation with Lou when Ha Song-Su gathered the players around. He explained, \u201cOkay, listen up. I\u2019m about to share the hunting strategy for Talon\u2014\u201d\u201cWe already know. Did you really think we won\u2019t even check something like that before entering a sustained gate?\u201dSong Byung-Hoon\u2019s interruption was straight up rude and offensive, but Ha Song-Su continued patiently, \u201cYou still need to listen. A slight mistake on anyone\u2019s part can ruin our entire gate trip. And that\u2019s not even the worst-case: a mistake here can cost everyone their lives.\u201d\u201cTsk. So annoying!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon grumbled. Obviously, he failed to notice how tense the atmosphere in the group was. The female player even seemed ready to jump forward, but she flinched and calmed down after Song-Su gave her a look. Gi-Gyu was probably the only one who noticed their strange interaction.\u2018That was really weird just now.\u2019Ha Song-Su\u2019s companion, the female player, didn\u2019t even reveal her name during their entire trip. Her reaction just now was definitely odd, but Gi-Gyu decided not to think too much about it.Ha Song-Su took a deep breath and continued, \u201cThis gate\u2019s gatekeeper and boss monster, Talon, has only one specialty: it can change its attack pattern. Other than that, Talon\u00a0is a keeper-level\u00a0monster\u00a0with rather basic strengths. The greatest advantages it has are its size, speed, and power.\u201dThis much everyone in the group knew; what Ha Song-Su said next was their key to clinch victory.\u201cWhat you need to remember is what happens when Talon changes its pattern. Once we deliver enough damage, Talon would crouch and try to change its pattern. If it\u2019s successful in that, hunting it will become much harder since it will target the distant players first.\u201dOne strategy was to attack while Talon was partway through this change, but its defense increased three-fold during this change.Ha Song-Su added, \u201cThe close combat dealer and the tanker\u2019s aggro will be the key to killing this monster.\u201d\u201cWe understand,\u201d everyone except Song Byung-Hoon answered.\u201cYeah, yeah, I got it,\u201d Song Byung-Hoon replied in frustration; by this time, the other players were already busy crossing the metal fence.***\u201cHush\u2026\u201dAhead of them, Talon was sitting with its back toward the group. The giant monster gave off an unusually intimidating aura.\u2018This is my first time seeing a boss monster.\u2019Gi-Gyu had seen a guardian or two before, but not a gate boss. A gatekeeper, also called a boss monster, was known to be almost as strong as the guardians. Gi-Gyu was feeling wonderstruck when Ha Song-Su said to him, \u201cI\u2019m about to shoot.\u201dThis was Ha Song-Su\u2019s way of asking someone to focus. Ha Song-Su pulled out a special-looking arrow and nocked it on his bow.\u2018It's an explosive arrow.\u2019Gi-Gyu knew what it was. When the Tower and the gates appeared, various countries made great efforts to create weapons using the crystals. Unfortunately, regular people couldn\u2019t use them because the power within the crystals was too strong. After many failed experiments, humans were only left with several flops, and this explosive arrow was one of them.The idea was to refine the energy within the crystal to cause an explosion. This idea failed because the explosive power contained within the crystal wasn\u2019t significant. But it was certainly powerful enough to act as an arrowhead.Whoosh!The explosive arrow flew at a blinding speed and struck the middle of Talon\u2019s back.\u201cKyeee!!!\u201d Talon screamed in pain and anger; before it could do anything, a loud noise filled the area.Kaboom!The arrow had just exploded.\u201cClose combat dealer!\u201d Ha Song-Su yelled.\u201cOkay! Haaaaaa!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon roared and dashed forward. Gi-Gyu followed close after and said, \u201cI\u2019m going!\u201dTalon seemed to have received significant damage from the internal explosion. However, when was a single explosion ever enough to slow down a boss ghoul?\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon roared again, making it turn toward him.Wham!Talon slammed its fist onto Song Byung-Hoon\u2019s shield. With a loud bang, Song Byung-Hoon was thrown into the air.\u2018Please do your best!\u2019-I got this!They were currently facing a boss monster; it would\u2019ve been foolish not to use all of his strength. This was the time to give everything he had. Suddenly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s speed increased, and he was near Talon the very next second.Slash!Gi-Gyu swung Lou elegantly and sliced off Talon\u2019s right hand. All this while, Ha Song-Su never once seemed impressed by Gi-Gyu; now, even he exclaimed, \u201cWow!\u201d Slashing the boss monster\u2019s hand with a single slash was, no doubt, a praiseworthy accomplishment. But, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t stop there. He unleashed a barrage of slashes onto Talon, leaving Song-Su\u2019s arrows and Choi Dae-Oh\u2019s sword strikes as mere extras. The female player\u2019s magic attacks also continued to cause damage to the monster.Song Byung-Hoon was surprised by Gi-Gyu\u2019s movements. Gi-Gyu was clearly stronger than the team leader; Byung-Hoon\u2019s eyes sparkled at that thought.\u201cThe pattern change is starting!\u201d Ha Song-Su yelled. Talon must have suffered significant wounds because it ran to the back and crouched on the ground. Song-Su suggested, \u201cGi-Gyu, how would you like to take this chance to attack it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu contemplated. It certainly wasn\u2019t a bad idea. The monster\u2019s defense went up during the pattern change, but Gi-Gyu was now strong enough to cause significant damage. So perhaps this was worth a try.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAlright.\u201dGi-Gyu held Lou tightly and approached the crouched talon.\u2018Gotta aim for the neck.\u2019Injuring any other area was going to be meaningless. Beheading it with a single swing was going to be his best bet. It was a critical juncture; Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands began to sweat.[Lou\u2019s assimilation level is increasing.][You can now use Lou\u2019s powers more efficiently.]-Huh?\u2018What?\u2019Suddenly, Gi-Gyu felt a rush of energy inside him.\u2018Was I not tapping into Lou\u2019s full power till now? That\u2019s gotta be it.\u2019After the rush, Gi-Gyu felt his chances of finishing this fight were higher than ever. Then, he swung Lou across Talon\u2019s neck with all of his strength.[You have slain the gatekeeper, Talon.][You have gained experience points.][You have successfully killed the gatekeeper with a single attack.][You have gained extra experience points.][Lou is absorbing Talon\u2019s blood.][Lou\u2019s ability increased slightly from Talon\u2019s blood.][You have obtained a new skill\u2014Cannibalism.][Cannibalism: You can prey on corpses to regain your stamina.]\u201cWhat the hell?!!!\u201d one of the players swore.\u201cNo way!\u201d another player exclaimed.\u201c...\u201d Ha Song-Su remained silent.***Gi-Gyu had just beheaded Talon with a single swing of his sword. Let alone others, even Gi-Gyu himself was surprised. So, the other members gaping in confusion and shock was actually quite natural. They had suspected Gi-Gyu was no ordinary player; still, the most they expected from him was dealing some minor damage to Talon.But straight-up beheading?\u201cGi-Gyu! You need to give me your phone number,\u201d Song Byung-Hoon begged.\u201cM-me too!\u201d Choi Dae-Oh yelled hurriedly.Ha Song-Su remained quiet.Song Byung-Hoon and Choi Dae-Oh continued to act overly friendly with Gi-Gyu. The two sneaky men glanced at Ha Song-Su and smiled secretly.Ha Song-Su announced, \u201cI think we should first decide who gets the equipment item.\u201d To everyone\u2019s surprise, the group gained an equipment item after killing Talon. Such an item was very rare to come by. Because this was separate from the rewards that came with clearing a gate, the group needed to decide who got it. Of course, the contract everyone signed already stated how to do this. All they had left to do was roll a dice.\u201cUmm\u2026 Ummm, wait! Can we do this after I go to the washroom?\u201d Song Byung-Hoon suddenly asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ha Song-Su frowned but still nodded. Song Byung-Hoon smiled in satisfaction and asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cGi-Gyu, come with me to the washroom. I\u2019m only a tanker, so I\u2019m scared to go alone.\u201d\u2018Only a tanker? Scared? Something\u2019s wrong with him.\u2019\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu remained quiet because he didn\u2019t know how to respond.\u201cI wanna go too!\u201d Choi Dae-Oh yelled. But Song Byung-Hoon shook his head and ordered, \u201cYou just stay here and protect the equipment!\u201dSong Byung-Hoon must\u2019ve feared Ha Song-Su or the female player might steal the item and run if Choi Dae-Oh wasn\u2019t here to watch them.In the end, Gi-Gyu and Song Byung-Hoon moved to a quiet area.\u201cGi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to pee?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYou\u2019re strong, but you\u2019re not very smart, Gi-Gyu,\u201d Song Byung-Hoon teased.\u201cPardon?\u201dSong Byung-Hoon claimed he needed to relieve himself, but he was now saying something completely different.\u2018I think I know what\u2019s going on here.\u2019Gi-Gyu could guess what Song Byung-Hoon was thinking. Although he had never left the tutorial floors, Gi-Gyu had met countless players as a guide. He prided himself on being a good judge of a character. And it seemed that Gi-Gyu was right about Song Byung-Hoon.\u201cGi-Gyu, would you like to have that equipment item?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12. The F-Class Gate (4)It wouldn\u2019t take a genius to figure out Song Byung-Hoon\u2019s intentions.\u00a0Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to take unnecessary risks; with a hardened face, he said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cOh, come on. Why are you acting so stern?\u201d Song Byung-Hoon asked as he tapped Gi-Gyu\u2019s arm playfully. By now, Song Byung-Hoon was acting too familiar with him. Gi-Gyu\u2019s face clearly showed his displeasure, but it didn\u2019t seem like Song Byung-Hoon cared much.Song Byung-Hoon continued, \u201cI mean, let\u2019s be honest here. Gi-Gyu, you did all the work here today, didn't you? Dae-Oh and I, being ethical men, aren\u2019t interested in that equipment item, but did you see Ha Song-Su and that woman? How could they even think about rolling the dice?\u201d\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed, finding Byung-Hoon\u2019s suggestion ridiculous. There was no way Gi-Gyu would participate in such a complicated situation, but it seemed Song Byung-Hoon mistook Gi-Gyu\u2019s silence as interest in his suggestion. Byung-Hoon continued excitedly, \u201cWhat we are gonna do is pretty simple: Dae-Oh and I will simply pressure them into handing the item to you. And if we do this, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll help us out too in return, won't you?\u201dUnlike an average item made by players or regular humans, an equipment item like that usually fetched a sky-high price. So, this sounded like an attractive offer at a glance; Gi-Gyu practically had nothing to lose and everything to gain. In return, all he had to do was go hunting with Song Byung-Hoon and Choi Dae-Oh in the gates a few times. But\u2026Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow would you pressure them?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We\u2019ll make it happen, so all you need to do is go along with it, Gi-Gyu,\u201d Song Byung-Hoon explained.\u201c...\u201dOnce again, Song Byung-Hook took Gi-Gyu\u2019s silence for something it wasn\u2019t. While humming a merry tune, Song Byung-Hook returned to the group. With a troubled look, Gi-Gyu also headed toward where his group was waiting.***\u201cNow that I\u2019ve emptied my bladder, shall we take care of the equipment item?\u201d Song Byung-Hoon announced, making the female player frown a little. But he didn\u2019t seem to care as he continued, \u201cJust bring it over here first, Dae-Oh.\u201dIt appeared Choi Dae-Oh had decided to follow Song Byung-Hoon\u2019s lead because he replied obediently, \u201cOf course!\u201dThe equipment item was placed in the middle of the group. The reward for killing Talon was a dagger: the Dagger of Paralysis. Something like that was definitely worth a big chunk.\u2018It must be worth a fortune since it can consistently paralyze an enemy upon a successful attack.\u2019It certainly was a desirable item. Equipment items already fetched a good price, but those with paralysis ability sold for even higher.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take out the dice,\u201d Ha Song-Su announced as he put his hand in his pocket.\u201cHaa!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon suddenly yelled as he jumped to grab the Dagger of Paralysis. He then plunged toward Ha Song-Su with the weapon.Ha Song-Su was an archer; right now, he didn\u2019t even have his bow close by. So, he was in a very vulnerable state.Whap!But before Song Byung-Hoon could reach Ha Song-Su, Gi-Gyu grabbed him. As Song Byung-Hoon screamed till his face went red, Dae-Oh took a few steps back with a confused face.\u2018Just now\u2026\u2019Song Byung-Hoon continued to shriek loudly, but Gi-Gyu zoned out everything apart from Ha Song-Su and the female player. Ha Song-Su didn\u2019t flinch for a second even when the dagger was millimeters away from him. As for the female player\u2026\u2018She\u2019s fast.\u2019Had Gi-Gyu not grabbed Song Byung-Hoon\u2019s arm in time, there was no way of knowing what might have happened.\u2018Didn\u2019t she specialize in magic?\u2019Flash!A dagger\u2019s glare struck Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, and only then did he realize that the female player was holding a dagger. He suspected that if he hadn\u2019t stopped Song Byung-Hoon, she would\u2019ve amputated this idiot\u2019s arm.\u201cGi-Gyu! What do you think you\u2019re doing?! Weren\u2019t we on the same page? Hey! Dae-Oh,\u201d Song Byung-Hoon protested in confusion.\u201cStay still,\u201d Dae-Oh replied while staying as far away from Gi-Gyu as possible. Then, Gi-Gyu pushed Song Byung-Hoon down with his arm, making him fall to the ground.Clank!With a rattle, the Dagger of Paralysis also fell to the ground.\u201cW-why are you doing this, Gi-Gyu?! I was just kidding!\u201d Song Byung-Hoon tried to make excuses, but the tense atmosphere finally struck him.Whack!Song Byung-Hoon fainted when Gi-Gyu hit the back of his neck.\u2018First time I use this move, and it works? What luck!\u2019After briefly staring at Song Byung-Hoon, Gi-Gyu looked at Choi Dae-Oh.\u201cAs for you, Choi Dae-O\u2014\u201d Gi-Gyu began, but before he could finish, Choi Dae-Oh knelt on the ground and begged, \u201cHe told me he would sell the equipment item and share the profit with me if I did as he asked. That\u2019s the only reason I went along! I had no idea he was going to stab the group leader!\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like Choi Dae-Oh was lying. Ignoring the trembling man, Gi-Gyu turned toward Song-Su and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d Ha Song-Su asked with a face full of interest.\u201cHe was trying to attack you, so you should take care of him,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. As soon as he finished his sentence, the female player took a step. Just like what Gi-Gyu had done, she hit the back of Dae-Oh\u2019s neck.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Gi-Gyu's suspicion was confirmed. It was obvious that this girl was much more skilled than he was. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think I should be asking you that?\u201d Ha Song-Su answered with another question. He added, \u201cAnyway, I would like to thank you for what you did just now. Ha-Rim, stay behind me.\u201dHa-Rim, the female player, lowered her head and obeyed. Gi-Gyu said to Ha Song-Su, \u201cI\u2019ll take that dagger then.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Ha Song-Su asked, intrigued.\u201cDidn\u2019t I just save your life? I think I deserve some reward.\u201d\u201cHmm, I think it\u2019s too much\u2026\u201d\u201cAn item like this should be nothing to someone like you, right?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked, making Ha Song-Su stiffen. Ha Song-Su thought Gi-Gyu had found out his identity, but Gi-Gyu actually had no idea, so he explained, \u201cSomeone like her is following you around and acting like a bodyguard; you obviously aren\u2019t just any hunter. I\u2019m not interested in you, so I don\u2019t plan on investigating you. I won\u2019t talk to others about you either.\u201dGi-Gyu really wanted to take the Dagger of Paralysis. And because of what just happened with Song Byung-Hoon, he now had a legitimate excuse to take the item. After soloing the boss and saving their team leader\u2019s life, he believed he deserved it.\u201cAlright,\u201d Ha Song-Su replied and nodded.Gi-Gyu picked up the Dagger of Paralysis and declared, \u201cThen I'll leave these two men to you.\u201d\u201cDo you plan on staying inside the gate longer?\u201d Ha Song-Su asked.\u201cYes, I want to hunt a bit more till the end of our reserved time,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me with an annoying cleanup,\u201d Ha Song-Su grumbled, but he no longer looked upset.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m dumping them on you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d Ha Song-Su replied and glanced at the female player. He gave her a look, and Ha-Rim jolted. Nervous, Gi-Gyu tightened his grip on Lou; thankfully, all Ha-Rim did was grab Song Byung-Hoon and Choi Dae-Oh\u2019s necks.\u201cSee you later,\u201d Ha Song-Su said goodbye. He and Ha-Rim then turned around to touch Talon\u2019s corpse before the four of them disappeared from Gi-Gyu\u2019s sight.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. His back and hands were soaked in sweat.-You need to be more careful! How could you make a deal with that mad woman?!\u201cSorry,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized to Lou. Lou was screaming nonstop when he was talking with the dangerous duo. He was yelling for Gi-Gyu to run because there was no way they could take on that woman named Ha-Rim. But Gi-Gyu decided to stay because he felt running away in that situation would\u2019ve been even more dangerous. Thankfully, it seemed he made the right call.-I belong to you, which means I\u2019m your family now! Master, don\u2019t forget that if you die, I die too!\u201cSorry,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and caressed Lou. Even though Lou sounded selfish, Gi-Gyu knew his Ego was worried for him. It seemed an apology was enough to appease the sword.-Just be careful from now on!\u201cAlright.\u201dBefore leaving, Gi-Gyu looked at where Song-Su and Ha-Rim stood a moment ago one last time.***[Lou has absorbed the zombie\u2019s stamina.]Gi-Gyu had plenty of time to stay behind and hunt because they had cleared the gate quickly. Lou had gained a zombie's ability by the end of his onslaught on this gate\u2019s zombies.\u201cPerfect.\u201dGi-Gyu was satisfied with what he had accomplished today. By now, there were barely any zombies left inside the gate, so he decided to kill one or two more before heading toward the reward chamber.\u201cGrrr\u2026\u201d the last zombie groaned as its head rolled on the ground.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed. Starting from the lizardmen hunt, he had been hunting continuously for the last three days; the fatigue was finally setting in. He sat down for a moment to rest and regain his strength. When he checked the time, he realized he still had plenty of time to spare.\u201cI better leave now,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. He had probably taken everything he could from this gate, so there was no motivation to stay behind. Well, he could wait for the zombies to reappear, but how many would he have to kill this time to level up? Gi-Gyu decided that he had enough for now. The smart thing would be to increase his hunting time gradually.He stood up and was about to head toward Talon\u2019s corpse when\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201dHe spotted something sparkling on one side of the wall.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dDifferent players had cleared this gate dozens of times, so all the hidden pieces inside had already been retrieved. Also, Gi-Gyu had never heard of a light like this.\u201cUmm\u2026 what is that?\u201dGi-Gyu slowly approached it and touched the wall.Tap\u2026 Tap...When he tapped it, he heard some hollow sounds.\u201cIt\u2019s empty inside,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.The inside of the wall seemed empty, which was even stranger. The location where the light was coming from was an easy spot to break during a battle. There was no way all of the previous players missed the hidden piece here.\u201cEither it was never found, or\u2026\u201dPerhaps there was a condition Gi-Gyu satisfied to trigger its appearance.Tap\u2026 Tap...When he tapped it again with his fist, he realized the wall wasn't very strong.Crash!Gi-Gyu swung Lou against the wall, which crumbled down with a loud noise. After the wall crumbled away, the light inside shone brighter than ever.-Ego?\u201cWhat?\u201dLou's murmur confused Gi-Gyu.-I think there\u2019s an Ego inside! I can feel it!As Gi-Gyu slowly cleared rubbles, the light\u2019s intensity increased even more. When he cleared a large enough area for a person to pass by, he spotted a sword.\u201cIs that an Excalibur or something?\u201dA white sword was stuck in the ground. Gi-Gyu walked closer to it and saw a strange-looking sword. He couldn\u2019t tell what it was made of, but the handle at the end of the white blade looked like it was made from wood.Ba-dum!Ba-dum!Suddenly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart began to pound rapidly.\u2018Does it want me to hold it?\u2019It was as if the sword was calling for him. Slowly, Gi-Gyu held the wooden handle. And that was when he zoned out.***Gi-Gyu found himself inside a space filled with white light.\u201cI guess this is better than what happened before,\u201d he murmured. This felt similar to the space he found himself in when he first met Lou. The difference was that the previous space was filled with darkness, but he was surrounded by brilliance here. However, the luminosity wasn\u2019t blinding; instead, it felt warm.-Are you my master?\u201cAre you an Ego? The one inside the sword?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.-Yes. I\u2019ve been waiting for my master here. Could you answer my question?Gi-Gyu chuckled since this meeting was in stark contrast to his first hello with Lou. Also, because this wasn\u2019t his first time meeting an Ego, he was much more relaxed.\u201cI'm not your master, but I would like to be.\u201dGi-Gyu wasn\u2019t its owner yet, but he would be soon.-My name\u2026\u201cEl,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered.-El. Is that my name?\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered warmly. He could almost hear the Ego, now named \u201cEl,\u201d laugh.-Thank you. Now please take me away.[You have synced with El.][El shall belong to you from now on.][You can now access El\u2019s information.]-Thank you, Master.Then, the space began to distort around him.***[The devil sealed by El is waking up.][The seal has been broken, so the gate will now perish.]As soon as Gi-Gyu entered El\u2019s space, the gate began to shake loudly. Before long, the ceiling began to crumble, and large chunks of it fell around him.-Run!-Run, Master!-Who are you?-And who might you be?\u201cShut up!\u201d Gi-Gyu hurriedly pulled out the white sword and ran toward Talon\u2019s corpse. Meanwhile, the gate didn\u2019t stop quaking. Based on how the gate was shaking and considering what the system announced a moment ago, Gi-Gyu knew something huge was about to happen.\u201cDammit!|The ground began cracking. Talon\u2019s corpse wasn\u2019t far away, but Gi-Gyu found it hard to maintain his balance.Rumble!Now, even the walls were trembling. Gi-Gyu took careful steps on any intact surfaces he could find and finally reached Talon\u2019s corpse. When he touched the dead body, he heard the system.[Would you like to move to the reward chamber?]\u201cYes!\u201d Gi-Gyu answered and found his vision darken slowly.Kaboom!Before everything turned black, Gi-Gyu got a glimpse of the falling walls and a pair of blood-red eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13. The Auction House (1)[A reward has been prepared.][You have destroyed the gate.][A bonus reward has been prepared.]Gi-Gyu found himself inside a gray room; seconds later, several bronze and silver boxes appeared in front of his eyes. This was his first time inside a reward chamber.\u201cI guess the silver boxes have the bonus reward,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and opened the bronze box first. A bonus reward was given when a certain condition was met. Perhaps finding El was one such condition.[30 purple crystals]\u201cNot bad.\u201dA purple crystal was the lowest quality crystal found inside the gates, but earning 30 of them wasn\u2019t a bad deal. After all, this was only an F-Class gate.\u201cThis is the main prize,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured expectantly as he moved on to the silver boxes. Since this was a bonus reward and encased in a silver box, there was a good chance this would be an equipment item.\u201cHuh?\u201d[Protection Talisman][The carrier of this item will gain protection. A non-player can also carry it and gain the ability to resist various illnesses and diseases.]After reading the description, Gi-Gyu excitedly picked up the small necklace from the silver box.***On his way home, Gi-Gyu felt quite heavy-hearted. He said, \u201cWow\u2026 So the gate was destroyed. Was this an exceptional gate? Or is it because I found El?\u201dThankfully, the gate perished long after Gi-Gyu left, so no one suspected him.\u2018I better keep quiet about this.\u2019The consequences would\u2019ve been dire and simply ineffable had anyone found out about it. Gi-Gyu decided to keep the incident a secret. When he thought about his first gate hunt, he realized his gains were way more than what he could\u2019ve ever imagined. After all, he earned two equipment items, 30 purple crystals, some additional crystals from killing zombies, and El. But, Gi-Gyu felt uncertain about many aspects of this journey.\u2018I wonder who they are.\u2019Gi-Gyu pondered about the true identities of Ha Song-Su and Ha-Rim, but he quickly shook his head. Most players who hid their identities tended to be dangerous. Even if they weren\u2019t, it was never a good idea to probe into someone who wanted to remain anonymous.His own safety had always been on top Gi-Gyu\u2019s priority list. He was getting stronger with each passing day, but that didn\u2019t mean he would kick every hornet\u2019s nest he saw. Gi-Gyu was smart enough to recognize that he was just strong among the amateurs\u2014not the rankers and high rankers of this world.\u2018And then there\u2019s that devil\u2026 Just what is it?\u2019El explained that the creature it locked away was a devil. When he synced with El, the seal imprisoning the devil was broken. What were those blood-red eyes he saw before leaving the gate?\u2018El, do you know anything about it?\u2019A white ring with medusa\u2019s face for its center stone adorned Gi-Gyu\u2019s middle finger: This was El. Just like Lou, El had an accessory function. He was aware of what it did this time, so he immediately activated it after leaving the gate.-I can\u2019t remember much. It feels like my head is filled with fog. All I remember is that someone ordered me to protect the devil\u2019s seal. That\u2019s all, Master.\u2018And who ordered that?\u2019Lou suddenly butted in before El could answer.-What a stupid question! She obviously doesn\u2019t know.-...Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t like Lou's rudeness, but he agreed. He touched his head and murmured, \u201cThings are getting so complicated lately.\u201dGetting stronger every day was all well and good, but Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t particularly enjoying all the messy situations he was a part of now. Unfortunately, the past couldn\u2019t be changed. Since he knew worrying about it wouldn\u2019t change anything, all he could do was prepare for the possible consequences.For a player, that line meant getting stronger. And that happened to be exactly what Gi-Gyu wanted for himself, to begin with.\u2018El, let me have a look at your status screen.\u2019Gi-Gyu was looking through El\u2019s stats earlier when he found the accessory function. It made him go off-track, so he never got the chance to give her stats a thorough vetting. Back then, he checked Lou's stats to learn about him; it was time for Gi-Gyu to learn more about El.-Yes, Master.El calling him \u201cMaster\u201d felt a bit awkward, so Gi-Gyu just whispered, \u201cHmm.\u201d He had already told El that there was no need to call him that, but El refused to listen.\u2018Calling me master isn't a good reason to teach El some manners like Lou, right?\u2019El's status screen appeared in front of Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes and broke his train of thought.[El][Level 2][Power: 2][Speed: 2][Stamina: 2][Magic: 2][Accessory: Enabled]This looked very similar to what he saw when he first met Lou. The levels were the only noticeable difference. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI thought you would be much stronger since you were responsible for protecting the devil\u2019s sea\u2014\u201d-Master, I have been protecting the devil\u2019s seal for so long that I lost all of my power. Even if you hadn\u2019t synced with me, the seal would\u2019ve broken eventually, and I would\u2019ve perished.Gi-Gyu nodded quietly. He felt a little better after hearing El's explanation.***\u201cOppa!\u201d Yoo-Jung greeted Gi-Gyu when he returned home.\u201cHow\u2019s Mother?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wash up first.\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll get your dinner ready!\u201d Yoo-Jung offered brightly. After patting her head, Gi-Gyu headed to the washroom. After a quick shower, he changed. As soon as he walked out of the washroom, Yoo-Jung asked, \u201cOppa! Dinner\u2019s ready, so why aren\u2019t you eating yet?\u201dGi-Gyu rummaged through his bag as he murmured, \u201cI need to get this to Mother first.\u201d He took out the talisman and walked to his mother. Yoo-Jung watched with curiosity; without an explanation, Gi-Gyu quietly hung the talisman around his mother\u2019s neck. When Yoo-Jung saw what it was, she exclaimed, \u201cIsn\u2019t that a \u2018protection talisman?\u2019\u201d\u201cShhh! You\u2019ll wake her up,\u201d Gi-Gyu hushed her.\u201cWow! Where did you get such an expensive item from?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked with excitement.Protection talismans were one of the few items that even non-players could use. It increased the user\u2019s life force while protecting them from minor illnesses. This couldn\u2019t heal their mother, but it could give her some health benefits.Gi-Gyu muttered to Yoo-Jung, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to have Mother stay in a hospital.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dGi-Gyu was told that recent medical advancements provided treatment options for even patients with total body paralysis. There was no guarantee of complete recovery; he wanted to try it if there was even a slight chance of recovery. Until now, the treatment cost wasn\u2019t something Gi-Gyu could afford. But since he was becoming financially stable, he felt it was finally time to take his mother to a hospital.\u201cI\u2019ll look into the hospitals,\u201d Gi-Gyu offered.\u201cAre you sure this will be okay?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked hesitantly.\u201cYeah,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied and patted her head one more time. He appreciated the fact that his little sister was looking out for him.***For now, Gi-Gyu decided against advancing to the next floors inside the Tower. To increase Lou\u2019s stats, which required the sword to absorb monsters\u2019 blood, he had to hunt as many of the same kind of monsters as possible. This meant that he had to spend a lot of time killing monsters with higher levels than Lou and El. It was a time-staking task, but the result was satisfying. Although Gi-Gyu\u2019s ascension was slow, he was becoming stronger at a much faster speed in comparison. This was what really counted since a player\u2019s level mattered only because it came with corresponding abilities and skills.\u201cEl, you\u2019ve leveled up a lot too.\u201d-Thank you, Master.El was already at Level 6. One disappointing aspect was the fact that, unlike Lou, El couldn\u2019t absorb monsters\u2019 blood to become stronger. Although El's stats only had a unit change with each level up, Gi-Gyu was still thankful for being its master.\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. El didn\u2019t have Lou\u2019s special ability, but she had a special ability of her own: every level up in her stats reflected in Gi-Gyu\u2019s stats. In other words, Gi-Gyu\u2019s stats changed with El\u2019s stats. Owning Lou and El was akin to owning two special abilities.\u201cEgos tend to level up slowly, but it\u2019s very consistent.\u201dUnfortunately, ever since he synced with El, the level-ups of his two Egos had slowed down significantly. He suspected that it was either because of the increase in the experience points requirement or the experience points were being shared between the two of them. But Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t too bothered by this. After all, he was hunting like a lunatic lately and he rarely felt tired, so this didn\u2019t seem to matter so much.\u201cI better find more Egos later.\u201dAfter he obtained El, Gi-Gyu was once again reminded of the Egos\u2019 power. If he could get another one, he knew he could get stronger at a much faster rate.\u201cBut if I get more Egos, I will never experience peace again,\u201d Gi-Gyu moaned. Of late, his head had been filled with the ramblings and arguments of the Ego duo, so he couldn\u2019t imagine how much more noise he would have to endure if he owned more Egos. But this was the price Gi-Gyu had to pay to become powerful, and he was only too happy to pay it.-What?!-Master, I will try to be as quiet as I can.Gi-Gyu was glad El was such a respectful creature.***\u201cI really think I\u2019ve to hunt more inside gates,\u201d Gi-Gyu thought out loud. His quest to level up Lou had brought him to the ninth floor. The Ego duo had leveled up significantly; Lou\u2019s improvement had been truly amazing. Yet, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but think about gates.The main reason behind why he couldn\u2019t hunt in gates was that he couldn\u2019t find suitable hunting groups. The last time he found a hunting party was because of the website that advertised available groups. However, he still remembered the uncomfortable position he was forced into the last time, so he wanted to avoid such an event at all cost. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t belong to an established group or a guild. This meant that there weren't many other ways Gi-Gyu could hunt inside the gates.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t a solo player allowed inside the gates?\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered in annoyance. A capable player shouldn't have any problems clearing an F-Class Gate, but the association didn\u2019t allow it. Players were considered an important asset, and it was the association\u2019s duty to control the players\u2019 vanity and arrogance. If a player ended up dead after a failed hunt, the loss could be too damaging.\u201cMaybe I need to make my own group,\u201d Gi-Gyu pondered. Many monsters like the zombies only appeared inside the gates, so gate hunting was necessary to strengthen Lou.\u2018But I don\u2019t want to be in a group.\u2019Sadly, being in a group had its own cons. Gi-Gyu feared the other players more than the monsters. He sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026 I better get down first. Mom is finally moving into a hospital today.\u201dToday was the day Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother was being admitted to a hospital. Tae-Shik helped in choosing the best place for her. It was a famous hospital in Seoul, so it was expensive, but Gi-Gyu wanted his mother to have the best care possible.***\u201cYou must be so busy. You didn\u2019t have to come,\u201d Gi-Gyu protested.\u201cToday is the day your mother\u2019s being admitted to the hospital, right?\u201d Tae-Shik replied.\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied earnestly. Tae-Shik was visiting to help Gi-Gyu with his mother. Tae-Shik reassured him, \u201cYou can trust this doctor, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I can. After all, you introduced him to me. If he can\u2019t be trusted, you\u2019ll have to answer to me,\u201d Gi-Gyu teased, making Tae-Shik smile and grumble, \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk.\u201dTae-Shik asked, \u201cAre you doing well?\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s going great. Someday, I\u2019m going to be strong enough to take you down, Hyung.\u201dAlthough Tae-Shik looked like a slightly sharp middle-aged man, he was actually a ranker. In the past, he became famous as a high ranker; one day, he retired and began working for the association. Recognizing his talent, the association was willing to help Tae-Shik climb up the corporate ladder faster, but all he wanted at the time was to run the guide department.\u2018It\u2019s nice to see that he\u2019s finally where he\u2019s supposed to be.\u2019In Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, Tae-Shik\u2019s new position suited Tae-Shik better than working at the guide department.Gi-Gyu said, \u201cThere is actually one problem I have right now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tae-Shik asked with surprise.\u201cI\u2019m having difficulty finding a group.\u201d\u201cA group?\u201d\u201cYes. I need to tour the gates, but I can\u2019t trust anyone to accompany me. And since solo hunting is illegal, I am torn,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.\u201cY-yo-you! I told you not to go inside the gates, so what are you talking about?!\u201d Tae-Shik exclaimed.\u201cTo be honest, I already tried hunting inside an F-Class Gate. Killing the monsters was easy, but dealing with the other players was so tricky,\u201d Gi-Gyu complained.\u201cHaa\u2026 You\u2019re so stubborn. But you found monster-hunting easy? In an F-Class Gate?\u201d Tae-Shik asked as he contemplated. Gi-Gyu, on the other hand, waited quietly for Tae-Shik to answer. There was a reason Gi-Gyu mentioned his problem to Tae-Shik.Tae-Shik was now a prominent figure inside the association. So, Gi-Gyu was hoping Tae-Shik could perhaps find a solution. And thankfully, it seemed Tae-Shik had already forgotten about how Gi-Gyu entered the gate against his wishes. Instead, Tae-Shik seemed more interested in the fact that Gi-Gyu found hunting F-Class monsters easy.Tae-Shik finally offered, \u201cI think there might be a way.\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed.\u201cWhy are you so excited? You don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m about to say,\u201d Tae-Shik retorted; with a playful smile, he continued, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you obtain the player credential?\u201d\u201cGosh! What the heck! Do you really think I didn\u2019t think of that?\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled in frustration as he felt his hopes crashing down.Player credential was a classification system similar to that of the gates. It was done in alphabetical order, and it measured the players\u2019 strength. High-ranking players were allowed to go solo hunting inside the gates, and Gi-Gyu was already aware of this.However, the problem was the classification process. An item made from the gate crystals was used to measure a player\u2019s power. Of course, the trouble here was that Gi-Gyu was still a Level 1 player. On top of that, all his abilities stemmed from Lou and El. Based on the current method, he would never be powerful enough to get the credential. Gi-Gyu had no doubt he would be labeled F-Grade. Them not even considering him a plyer wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility either.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI guess I better think about this\u2026\u201dBut perhaps it wasn\u2019t such a bad idea to just try it. If he got lucky, he could cheat with Lou and El\u2019s help.\u201cOh, and\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik began as if he was about to say something important. \u201cThere was an accident where a sustained gate in Guri City perished. I don\u2019t know if it suddenly turned into an exceptional gate or something, but\u2026 Just be careful, Gi-Gyu. After becoming just a bit stronger, players tend to get into trouble because of their arrogance.\u201dGi-Gyu scratched his head to hide his guilt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14. The Auction House (2)\u201cOppa! Oppa! What are you thinking?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked loudly.\u201cNothing much,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered, coming out of his daydream.\u201cGosh, then just go home and sleep or something!\u201d Yoo-Jung ordered him.\u201cAlright,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied as he stood up. Then, turning toward his sister, he added, \u201cPlease take good care of Mother. I got this private ward partly for you too, so try to stay here as much as possible.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Yoo-Jung answered. Because their home was located in an isolated and unsafe neighborhood, Gi-Gyu would always be worried about his little sister\u2019s safety. So, when he decided to have his mother stay in a hospital, he got a private ward. The hospital was situated in a much safer area, so he urged Yoo-Jung to make this her new home.\u201cI\u2019ll be back later,\u201d Gi-Gyu promised his sister before leaving the hospital.\u201cStay safe! Being a player doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune to danger!\u201d Yoo-Jung warned her brother.***There was only one thing in Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind nowadays.\u2018Solo\u00a0gate hunting.\u2019But realistically speaking, this was impossible. It was one thing to get a permit, but dealing with the gatekeepers, aka the boss monsters, was also a serious problem. Talon appeared in all Guri City gates, and there wasn\u2019t any clear battle strategy available for hunting it. It wasn\u2019t overly strong; as the gatekeeper, it was almost as strong as the Tower\u2019s floor guardians. This was why 10\u201315 players of the same class as the gate were normally required to fight this monster.Of course, players with grades higher than that of the gate were free to hunt alone.\u2018But I\u2019m not quite there yet.\u2019Gi-Gyu was an objective judge when it came to his own skills. He certainly had been improving at a faster rate than many other players, making him a little stronger than your average rookies, but he knew he couldn\u2019t call himself \"strong.\" Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to act adventurous and end up losing his life.\u2018Still, there has to be something I can do.\u2019Was there a way for him to get stronger even faster?\u2018I guess there is only one thing I can do.\u2019***The Player Association\u2019s Seoul branch was a hive of activity today. An auction where players could trade expensive and rare items was underway inside the building. The auction house was always overcrowded; today, Gi-Gyu was also part of the crowd.\u2018I can\u2019t find it anywhere.\u2019Just like Lou found El, or like the way he spotted El's light inside the gate, Gi-Gyu had been wondering if he could find more Egos out in the world. Sadly, what happened inside the F-Class Gate had yet to repeat itself. He rummaged through all the stalls that sold items and equipment relevant to players, but he couldn\u2019t find anything special. He even took a second opinion from Lou and El, but even they couldn\u2019t feel any other Egos inside the building.\u2018I guess I should\u2019ve known that this wasn't going to be easy.\u2019This made perfect sense since finding Egos with powerful abilities couldn\u2019t be that easy. Gi-Gyu had been hoping for a miracle, and the most prospective place he could think of was the auction house.\u201cWould you like to register the Dagger of Paralysis for today's auction?\u201d the registrar asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cThe starting price will be 30 million won. The start time is\u2026\u201d the registrar continued to explain the auction process. Gi-Gyu listened and nodded before heading toward the auction house. Since he never got the opportunity to sell the Dagger of Paralysis, he had it for a while now. He could\u2019ve left it to the registrar and returned later to get paid whatever amount the item sold for. However, this was the very first quality item Gi-Gyu won, so he wanted to see it being sold in person.\u201cDo you think something good will be auctioned off today?\u201d a nearby player chatted with another player.\u201cI don\u2019t know. If they knew, they would\u2019ve sent out a notice,\u201d his companion replied.\u201cIf something like a skull set is brought out like the last time, everyone\u2019s going to go wild,\u201d the first player commented. Because the auction hadn't started yet, the place was filled with loud chatter. Gi-Gyu heard people greeting each other and talking expectantly about what auction items might be available today. Finally, he found a quiet seat away from the other players and sat down.\u201cThe auction will now begin,\u201d the auctioneer announced. Soon after, the offering began. Gi-Gyu decided to ask Lou and El to keep an eye out for useful items. \u2018If you guys find something good, let me know.\u2019-Got it.-Yes, Master.Usually, auctions began with the vending of the lowest quality items. The main prize appeared in the middle or at the end. However, what Gi-Gyu wanted wasn\u2019t something expensive; he was searching for an item that encased an Ego. The problem was, Gi-Gyu had no idea where an Ego might be hiding.\u2018I\u2019m afraid it will be inside something pricey based on where I found Lou and El.\u2019-Not all Egos are in a sword-like form like us!-We don\u2019t know what other Egos might look like, Master.\u2018That\u2019s a relief.\u2019His relief stemmed from the fact that there was at least a possibility he wouldn\u2019t have to buy something that looked as luxurious as Lou and El.The first auction item was a dull iron sword. But because it included an additional power stat, it sold at a decent price. Unfortunately, all the items that followed were also duds; i.e., Gi-Gyu and his Egos couldn\u2019t feel anything on any of the items. Meanwhile, the auction continued as the auctioneer announced, \u201cNow! The next object is the Dagger of Paralysis.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s Dagger of Paralysis was next in line. As soon as it appeared, the offering price went up quickly.\u2018Not bad, huh?\u2019The paralysis function was in high demand among players; consequently, the dagger was worth a lot despite being a low-level item. After a bout of intense bidding, the Dagger of Paralysis was finally sold for 100 million won. It actually went for twice what Gi-Gyu had expected.Gi-Gyu tried his best to hide his joy and focus on the rest of the action. Gi-Gyu felt tired because nothing worth buying came up the whole time he was there. He was about to leave when suddenly, the auctioneer announced with excitement, \u201cIt\u2019s finally time for today\u2019s main item\u2014the Bracelet for the Wounded!\u201d\u201cOhhh!\u201d a player from the audience exclaimed.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for that!\u201d another yelled excitedly.\u201cI hear its recovery power is amazing!\u201d some player in the distance explained to his companion. This item bought excitement to not only the players present but even Gi-Gyu. However, the reason Gi-Gyu stared at the bracelet was different from that of the other players.\u2018It\u2019s an Ego.\u2019Gi-Gyu could see the blue light being emitted from the bracelet.-It\u2019s an Ego!-I think it\u2019s a really powerful one too!\u201cHaa\u2026\" Gi-Gyu sighed silently.-What\u2019s wrong?-Master?This was exactly what Gi-Gyu had been searching for, but the Bracelet for the Wounded was the main item of today\u2019s auction. There was no way he could afford to offer the winning bid. Shaking his head, Gi-Gyu left the building.\u2018But now I know an Ego can be found anywhere and not just in special places like the gates.\u2019This had been his secondary goal for visiting the auction house today. Now, Gi-Gyu knew he didn\u2019t have to nearly die or smash a wall to get an Ego; he could get them just about anywhere.Suddenly, something dawned on Gi-Gyu, and his eyes widened, \u201cWait a second. That was 100 million won! My dagger went for 100 million won!!!\u201d The Dagger of Paralysis was sold for 100 million won; only then did he realize the wealth he had struck. In his entire life, he hadn\u2019t earned even a fraction of that, and he was just happy with having Lou and El in his possession. But now, he had 100,000,000 won too! It was the best news he could hope for.\u201cHehehe,\u201d Gi-Gyu giggled. Even if he deducted the 10% auction fee, he would still walk away with 90 million won. He whispered in excitement, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a kiss later, Lou and El.\u201d-Have you lost your mind?!-Master\u2026***In the end, Gi-Gyu gave up on buying or searching for other Egos. Instead, he returned to hunting. For an entire month after the auction, Gi-Gyu kept himself busy inside the Tower. In that time, he successfully ascended beyond the tenth floor; he was now heading toward the 13th floor.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI had no idea the test on the tenth floor was going to be that easy.\u201d-Hehe\u2026After a player passed the first test on the fifth floor, they had to take additional tests on the tenth floor and every ten floors after that. Only the players who passed these tests could ascend to the next floor. Gi-Gyu\u2019s test on the tenth floor was to hunt an orc.\u201cWhy did the difficulty level of the tests on the fifth floor and the tenth floor drop for me?\u201d he wondered out loud. All Gi-Gyu heard from the system was that he met a requirement, but he didn\u2019t know what that requirement was. He could come up with many possible answers, but he couldn\u2019t confirm any of his suspicions.\u201cWell, who cares? It made my life easier, so I guess that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d-Great attitude.-Indeed, Master.Gi-Gyu nodded in agreement. After sitting down, he asked, \u201cLou! You leveled up earlier, didn\u2019t you?\u201d-Yup!A while back, Gi-Gyu heard the system announcement about Lou leveling up, but he was so busy hunting he didn\u2019t get a chance to check. It had been a long time since Lou leveled up, so he gripped Lou tightly as a blue status screen appeared in front of him.[Lou][Level 14][Power: 34][Speed: 38][Stamina: 44][Magic: 29][Available Skills][Accessory][Cannibalism: You can prey on the corpses to regain your stamina.]There were huge changes to Lou's status screen. Firstly, Lou had already reached Level 14. But even more surprising were the changes in his abilities. After absorbing different monsters\u2019 blood, Lou's growth accelerated beyond Gi-Gyu\u2019s expectations. And consequently, Lou achieved stats beyond his level\u2014his current stats matched a Level 30 player. So, Gi-Gyu was more than satisfied with Lou's growth.\u201cBy the way, about the cannibalism skill\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.Lou obtained this skill after killing Talon. Cannibalism allowed a player to regain their stamina by preying on a corpse; it wasn\u2019t something Gi-Gyu could use. This was the first active skill he obtained, but it was useless to him.Gi-Gyu now had the strength of players in the 30\u2019s levels, yet he was still hunting without any functional skills.Lately, Gi-Gyu had noticed how troubled El seemed to be, so he consoled, \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, El.\u201d-I apologize for not being helpful, Master.\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re doing very well,\u201d Gi-Gyu encouraged her. El\u2019s depression seemed to be growing with each hunt. Her voice was usually void of any emotions, but he could still tell that El was disappointed in herself. He called up El's status screen.[El][Level 11][Power: 11][Speed: 11][Stamina: 11][Magic: 11][Available Skills][Accessory]El was growing at an ordinary speed. Apparently, the disparity in Lou and El\u2019s growth rate depressed the latter to no end. This couldn\u2019t be helped since El couldn\u2019t absorb the monsters' blood.\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll soon find a way to help you grow faster,\u201d Gi-Gyu tried to console El, who didn\u2019t reply. Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly and stood up. It was already very late; it was time to go home now.***On his way back, Gi-Gyu got a call from Yoo-Jung saying they were out of groceries. So, he dropped by the grocery store on his way back home. Now that he had saved some money, he could finally move to another neighborhood with his family. However, Yoo-Jung and their mother were staying at the hospital, so he didn\u2019t think it was necessary right now. And it wasn\u2019t like he went home much anyway.Gi-Gyu suddenly asked his Egos, \u201cBy the way, you guys really don\u2019t know anything about the Tower?\u201d-I told you I can\u2019t remember.-Me neither, Master.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu pondered. Lou and El had told him they lived inside the Tower for a long time, so he thought they might know some secret or special information about the mammoth structure. Unfortunately, it seemed that they didn\u2019t know much. Gi-Gyu had chatted with his swords on multiple occasions, but he never came up with anything useful.\u201cI wonder what happened to that devil in the F-Class Gate,\u201d Gi-Gyu contemplated. He was referring to the creature El kept in bounds before he synced with her. After the gate perished, was the devil released to the world? But if that were true, why didn\u2019t anyone notice it? Based on the size of those red eyes, it had to be pretty big. Yet, no one was talking about this devil. As time passed, the destruction of the Guri City gate was slowly forgotten. Everyone just chalked it up as another inexplicable strange phenomenon like the Tower, the gates, the monsters, the whole nine yards.-I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of help, Master.Gi-Gyu was lost in thought as he climbed the stairs to his home. Then, he came to an abrupt halt\u2014the area above him on the stairs was becoming distorted.\u201cIs that a gate?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in surprise. This was definitely a signal that a gate was forming.***\u201cDid you say your name is Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d the people from the association asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. It was late at night, but his neighborhood was noisy. Countless cars were coming and going, and some men in fancy suits were standing right in front of him. They were sent by the association, and they thanked Gi-Gyu, \u201cFirstly, thank you for reporting the gate occurrence.\u201dGi-Gyu was right about what he saw. The distortion was indeed a signal of a new gate forming. This was his first time seeing it up close, but Gi-Gyu remembered his player\u2019s training. He immediately called the Player Association and the people who maintained the gates arrived soon after. Newly incepted gates weren\u2019t dangerous to non-players. But, unlike the Tower, even non-players could enter gates. Children or drunkards often ended up inside the gates by accident, so they needed to be monitored closely.\u201cBased on its energy emission, this must be an F-Class Gate. You\u2019ll have the priority hunting pass, player Kim Gi-Gyu. What would you like to do?\u201d one of the men from the association asked. If a player reported a newly incepted gate, they would be given the priority hunting pass to it. This gave the player the chance to clear the gate first. They also had the right to transfer this pass to anyone of their choice.Rewards for clearing a gate for the first time were great even considering the danger, so the priority hunting passes were often sold for a high price. In addition, if the gate turned out to be a sustained type rather than a single-shot, the founder could end up making a lot of money.But sadly, this was no longer the case nowadays. Because of the recent incidents involving the exceptional gates, the number of players wanting to enter newly formed gates has plummeted lately. Besides, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t think an F-Class Gate was going to bring him much money.However, the fact that he owned the priority pass meant he could enter the gate alone. After a short contemplation, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cCan I make a quick call?\u201dHe took out his phone and walked away for a moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15. Blacksmith Ego (1)Gi-Gyu was calling Tae-Shik, who answered the call after just two rings.\u201cHello?\u201d Gi-Gyu greeted.-I was just about to call you!It seemed Tae-Shik wanted to talk to\u00a0Gi-Gyu as well. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cIs it about the newly formed gate?\u201d-That\u2019s right! I heard a gate appeared in front of your house. They said the institutor is\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied quickly, making Tae-Shik sigh.-So you must have the priority pass then.\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m calling you about,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.-Just tell them you\u2019ll keep the pass. Then, wait for me; I\u2019ll be right there.Tae-Shik hung up the phone without even waiting for Gi-Gyu\u2019s answer. The conversation ended before Gi-Gyu could ask anything; he sighed deeply, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu only called because he wanted a little advice, but Tae-Shik\u2019s unexpected response left him speechless. Gi-Gyu tried calling Tae-Shik again a few times, but there was no answer. In the end, Gi-Gyu walked back to the association members and said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep the priority pass.\u201d\u201cAlright. Remember, your pass will expire in five days, so use it before that. After five days, it\u2019ll be auctioned off to another guild, player, or group,\u201d an association member explained calmly.\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter their conversation ended, the men went back to controlling the traffic around the gate. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu sat down on a bench nearby that wasn\u2019t affected by the gate formation. After waiting for a while, Gi-Gyu heard the association employees making a fuss.\u201cGeneral Manager!\u201d the men exclaimed in surprise.\u201cDon\u2019t mind me. Just keep working,\u201d Tae-Shik ordered calmly.\u201cAh, yes, Sir!\u201d all the association employees replied in unison.After a brief conversation with the gate maintenance workers, Tae-Shik waved at Gi-Gyu. He asked, \u201cDid you wait long?\u201d\u201cNot really. You got here really fast; did you catch a jet or something?\u201d said Gi-Gyu jokingly. However, Tae-Shik replied with a solemn face, \u201cI ran.\u201dGi-Gyu became speechless. Once upon a time, Tae-Shik was a renowned high ranker. So, this man was indeed faster than most cars. Ignoring Gi-Gyu\u2019s confused look, Tae-Shik continued, \u201cI heard you took the priority pass. Good job.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you told me to do, Hyung.\u201d\u201cIndeed. After all, a priority pass is very valuable. I was sure you knew this too, but I just wanted to make sure. Let\u2019s go to a cafe first. I\u2019m so thirsty from running all the way here,\u201d said Tae-Shik.Gi-Gyu stood up to follow Tae-Shik when he suddenly heard the association employees whispering nearby.\u201cWho\u2019s that man?\u201d one employee asked as he glanced at Gi-Gyu.\u201cWhat\u2019s his relationship with the general manager?\u201d another worker wondered.\u201cAh! Maybe he\u2019s the player who was close to the general manager when he worked in the guide department. What do you think?\u201d the third man guessed.\u201cYou mean the player who can\u2019t level up?\u201dBeing the center of a whisper-conference would be awkward for anyone, let alone Gi-Gyu. So, he pretended not to have heard anything and hurriedly followed Tae-Shik.***Their feet brought them into a cafe located near Gi-Gyu\u2019s home. Passersby were slowly crowding the area, murmuring and roaming the area. It was apparent they were nothing more than curious spectators.One month was the usual time limit. A gate exploded if it wasn\u2019t cleared within that or neglected for longer than that. Gate explosion meant all the monsters inside the gate would come swarming out. At that point, even if the players tried their damnedest, they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop the monsters before they had caused great mayhem.\u201cWhat is your plan, Gi-Gyu? I assume you plan on clearing it alone, right?\u201d Tae-Shik asked while he gulped down the bitter americano and looked outside.\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping to do,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik sighed deeply again and continued, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019ve known you for a long time, so why now? Why are you so interested in gate hunting?\u201d After a quick pause, Tae-Shik looked straight into Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes and asked bluntly, \u201cWhat level are you now?\u201dWhen\u00a0Gi-Gyu remained silent, Tae-Shik prodded, \u201cJust be honest with me.\u201dGi-Gyu looked around, but no one was paying any attention to them. The cafe was pretty empty, to begin with. Gi-Gyu answered quietly, \u201cI\u2019m Level 1.\u201d\u201cI knew it. Not leveling up for half a decade and then suddenly start leveling up like crazy? I never bought it,\u201d Tae-Shik muttered, clearly not surprised by Gi-Gyu\u2019s statement.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a shrug. With another sigh, Tae-Shik questioned, \u201cTell me what happened. How did a Level 1 player become the Slayer? How did you become so strong?\u201dBefore Gi-Gyu answered him, Tae-Shik placed a round machine on the table.\u2018A barrier item.\u2019Barrier items were used to create a soundproof and invasion-proof barricade around the user. It even allowed its user to decide the perimeter of the area they wanted to enclose. Most high-level players owned such an item. Due to its rarity and expensive price, not many lower-ranking players dared to purchase one.\u2018How much should I tell him?\u2019Gi-Gyu contemplated how much he should tell Tae-Shik.\u2018Should I tell him about Lou? El too?\u2019And what about his job and unique ability? After thinking over his options slowly, Gi-Gyu opened his mouth.***Gi-Gyu stood inside Dongdaemun Market[1]. He was surrounded by shopkeepers yelling loudly to attract potential customers.\u201cCheap items here! Super cheap!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got a bayonet that can kill an orc with each shot! It\u2019s for sale!\u201d\u201cPotions for the lowest price!\u201dDongdaemun Market used to be famous for its cloth shops; after the Tower and the gates appeared, its function slowly changed over time. Now, it was a wholesale market for player items. This was where players with the blacksmith job made and sold items. The market offered excellent varieties, from well-known brand items made by renowned craftsmen to lower quality objects. Here, one could even find advanced items sometimes dropped by monsters. Items here could be bought at a much lower price than at the auction house, so Gi-Gyu often visited this place.\u201cWe got the best and the cheapest items here! Come have a look!\u201d one of the many shouting shopkeepers hollered.Gi-Gyu was here to purchase new protective gears. His old gears were appropriate only for the tutorial floors, so it was time for a change. Gi-Gyu bought a new set of protection equipment back when he got Lou, but its quality wasn\u2019t up to standard for him now. Gi-Gyu currently had 50 million won in his bank account. After prepaying his mother\u2019s hospital bill and the interest for his family debt, this was all he had left.The day Gi-Gyu found the new gate, Tae-Shik told him, \u201cThe first thing you need to do is get prepared for the solo gate hunt.\u201d That day, Gi-Gyu told Tae-Shik everything. There really was no reason why Gi-Gyu should hide the existence of Lou and El, especially because Tae-Shik was someone he could trust. Gi-Gyu was also aware that Tae-Shik would definitely be of great help in the future. Also, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to deceive the one person who had always been generous and kind to him.After Tae-Shik heard everything, he told Gi-Gyu to return after getting ready. Gi-Gyu first needed to obtain all the necessary items to prepare for the solo hunt. He had to buy equipment items and some disposable counterparts to prepare for the worst-case scenario.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he looked at the array of armors in a shop. Most looked like they were made of leather, but they looked sturdy. He picked up the strongest-looking black leather armor.[Sloppy leather armor made by an unskilled blacksmith][Normal][Defense Level 7]It was a useless item. Gi-Gyu checked all the other items one by one, but they weren\u2019t much different from his current protection gears. Gi-Gyu walked back and forth along the display boards as he muttered, \u201cNothing here is worth buying\u2026\u201dIndeed, there wasn\u2019t a single useful item in the market.-Yeah! Not one thing here has an Ego inside!-I couldn\u2019t detect any either, Master.Gi-Gyu had asked Lou and El earlier to tell him if they felt any Egos. Unfortunately, it seemed there weren\u2019t any around.\u201cThis won\u2019t do!\u201d Gi-Gyu mumbled in annoyance. He had to prepare everything and enter the gate in five days, but that much time wasn\u2019t even barely enough.Damn! I\u2019ve to find something useful no matter what!\u2019With renewed determination, Gi-Gyu began touring Dongdaemun Market again.***-Cheer up\u2026-It\u2019s alright, Master.The two Egos tried to console Gi-Gyu, who was clearly upset. He failed to find anything useful regardless of how many times he searched Dongdaemun Market. All the decent protection gears were marked up ridiculously, while all items with reasonable prices had the most useless functions. This defeated the very purpose he came here for: find quality items at a low cost. If he wanted to pay full price, wouldn\u2019t he have gone to the player department store or the auction house?\u201cShould I borrow some money, so I can purchase one of those expensive items?\u201d Gi-Gyu contemplated out loud. There was no way any bank would give him a loan, but he knew Suk-Woo or Tae-Shik would be willing to help him financially. Yet, Gi-Gyu shook his head and muttered, \u201cNo. If I keep depending on others, things will never change for me. Okay, one last look, and I\u2019m out.\u201dHe swore this was really going to be his last round around Dongdaemun Market today. If he failed again, he would\u2019ve to go to the auction house and get custom-made armor.After the last round that also ended in failure, Gi-Gyu was sitting on a bench with a defeated look. Then, an adorable boy walked up to him and asked, \u201cHyung, are you looking for something specific?\u201dConfused, Gi-Gyu said, \u00a0\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHyung, our shop has some really awesome items! The prices are super low too! My grandpa is an amazing craftsman, but no one seems to know this\u2026 If I take you there myself, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll give you a discount too!\u201d the boy, about eight years old, explained earnestly. The boy looked cute, but he was wearing a rather shabby outfit. His badly-worn shirt and oversized pants looked like thrift store rejects.This conversation somehow attracted the attention of many.\u201cThat child is at it again,\u201d one of the nearby shop owners muttered.\u201cHe would make more money working at a factory. No one ever buys anything from their shop, so why does he keep dragging our customers there?\u201d another shop owner complained.\u201cWho knows.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we report his grandfather for child abuse?\u201d the first shop owner asked.\u201cHe was reported many times before, but the boy cried and refused to leave every time. I heard even the police gave up,\u201d someone replied.From the looks of it, this child was pretty famous in Dongdaemun Market. The chatters seemed to have zero effect on the kid as he continued, \u201cHyung, I swear I\u2019ll give you a huge discount, okay? My grandpa is the best blacksmith in town!\u201dGi-Gyu looked at the child with pity. Kids like him were no treasure in this market since they were nothing more than baits for soft-hearted players. Often, blacksmiths with no skills or potential took in these poor children and made them into baits. They baited soft-hearted players into buying items, playing on the pity they felt for the children. Apparently, this was how many of the unskilled blacksmiths made a living.A nosy-looking man nearby advised Gi-Gyu, \u201cI\u2019ve been to that boy\u2019s store before. It looks decent from the outside, but all the items there don\u2019t even have a status screen. It was the worst! And if you go there, you might get assaulted. His grandfather is a wacky old man. I\u2019ve even seen him throw salt at his customers.\u201d[2]\u201cMy grandpa isn\u2019t a bad man! Don\u2019t talk about him like that!\u201d the boy protested.\u201cYou bastard! Remember how he threw salt at me when I followed you there?!\u201d the man yelled angrily.\u201cThat\u2019s because you called my grandpa a fake and a condescending old man who can\u2019t even make a proper player item!\u201d the boy screamed. The boy was so bothered by the decrying that he stopped trying to solicit\u00a0Gi-Gyu. Instead, he walked up to the rude man and swung his fist.\u201cW-what?!\u201d the man stammered. Confused, he tried to push the child away when\u00a0Gi-Gyu announced hurriedly, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go to your grandpa\u2019s shop.\u201d\u201cReally? You\u2019re really coming? Waaah!\u201d the boy exclaimed excitedly.\u00a0When the boy ran toward Gi-Gyu,\u00a0the rude man\u00a0spit on the ground\u00a0and warned Gi-Gyu, \u201cYou look like a novice player, so I\u2019ll give you some advice. Don\u2019t go there. You\u2019ll only make a fool of yourself and regret it later.\u201dAll Gi-Gyu did was glance at the man silently before following the boy. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cIs your grandfather\u2019s store far from here?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 No! It\u2019s really close!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s hurry. I don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained patiently.\u201cOkay! Follow me!\u201dThe people around looked at Gi-Gyu with pity, thinking the old man would mistreat him. However, Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes sparkled with intelligence\u00a0as he walked behind the boy.***Gi-Gyu followed the boy for a long time; now, they weren\u2019t in the crowded market but in a deep alley somewhere. Gi-Gyu asked his Egos silently, \u2018Are you sure that boy\u2019s clothing is an Ego?\u2019-Well, it\u2019s not your regular Ego. It\u2019s more like a fragment of an Ego. Or maybe an Ego\u2019s corpse? I\u2019m not sure how to explain it. This is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this.-Everything is the first time for you, Lou.-You, you\u2026 Whatever! So, yeah, that boy\u2019s clothes are definitely an Ego. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a synthetic Ego created by a human. However, rather than possessing a conscience, the clothes only have a part of the Ego\u2019s power.\u2018Does this mean he can sync with the Ego like me and use its power?\u2019-Don\u2019t be ridiculous! He isn\u2019t synced with that Ego\u2014he\u2019s just wearing an Ego. I doubt those clothes have any functions at all.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t follow the boy because he pitied him; he had his own plans. After all, there were plenty of other children who had worse lives than this child. On top of that, when children were used like this, they often matured quickly and became even sneakier than some adults. Normally, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve never followed a boy like this.There was only one reason behind why he decided to follow the kid: Lou and El both told him that they could feel an Ego in the boy\u2019s clothes. Gi-Gyu found this hard to believe, but he had no choice but to believe his Egos\u2019 words. This also piqued his curiosity about the boy.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d the boy announced. They stood in front of the run-down two-story building in a neglected alleyway. The boy walked down to the basement of this building, and\u00a0Gi-Gyu followed. The stairs were all cracked as if they were ready to collapse at any moment, and an unpleasant odor was wafting from the bottom of the stairs. The place looked ominous, but Gi-Gyu felt confident he could protect himself if necessary.\u201cGrandpa! We have a customer! I brought him here!\u201d the boy yelled eagerly as he opened the broken wooden door.\u201cBoy! I told you not to bring any customers, didn\u2019t I?\u201d an old man\u2019s voice came from the inside. Gi-Gyu slowly walked past the wooden door as the old man continued, \u201cMy grandson shouldn\u2019t have done that. Just get out. Nothing here is for sale\u2026\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu could hear the old man\u2019s voice, but he couldn\u2019t focus on it at all.-Oh my god.-This is impossible!The old man\u2019s entire workshop was glowing with golden light.1. Dongdaemun Market is a large commercial district in Seoul.\u00a0\u261c2. In Korea, salt is believed to ward off evil spirits.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16. Blacksmith Ego (2)\u201cAre you hard of hearing? Didn\u2019t I say I\u2019m not selling you squat? Get out!\u201d the old man screamed. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply and just stood there, unmoving.\u201cAre these all Egos?\u201d whispered Gi-Gyu.-How did a human do this?!-Master, thankfully, none of the Egos here hold consciousness.The old man\u2019s shabby workshop was barely 35 square feet, but it looked like a gold-filled treasure chest to Gi-Gyu. The boy asked anxiously, \u201cHyung, hyung! What\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t like Grandpa's items either?\u201d\u201cN-no, that\u2019s not it. Sir, may I please have a look at them?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked respectfully.\u201cWhat? Tsk. Min-Su, where did you find this strange man?!\u201d the old man said in annoyance, but his eyes never left Gi-Gyu. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s relief, the old man took the boy and stood against the wall as he replied, \u201cWell, I doubt you\u2019ll understand the true value of any of my items, but have a look anyway. Don\u2019t you dare complain that there aren\u2019t any status screens for them!\u201d\u201cT-thank you, Sir,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered gratefully. As if possessed, he began examining the items in the room, and the old man continued to monitor him. The blacksmith seemed interested in Gi-Gyu, perhaps because his grandson brought Gi-Gyu here. Or maybe it was because the old man suspected something.Gi-Gyu exclaimed in his mind, \u2018Oh my god! I\u2019ve never seen items with these kinds of abilities in my life.\u2019-I can\u2019t believe these Egos without consciousness hold such great powers.-That old man must be a great craftsman.The iron sword Gi-Gyu picked up looked clunky; in his eyes, it shone the brightest among all the items in the room. As soon as Gi-Gyu touched it, the sword\u2019s status screen, invisible to all the previous customers, appeared in front of his eyes.[Unnamed sword][Level 79][Power: 187][Speed: 60][Stamina: 210][Magic: 3][This blade will become sharper with each monster it slays.][Power and stamina will also increase with each monster it slays.][Sealed][Sealed][Sealed][Ego without a master. This Ego has lost its consciousness, so it only holds its power now and nothing else.]\u201cTo you, this might just look like a blunt iron sword, but it\u2019s the best item I\u2019ve ever made in my life,\u201d the old man claimed proudly. Gi-Gyu caressed the sword without a word. This blunt iron sword was Level 79 and had the abilities of a ranker.Gi-Gyu stammered, \u201cH-ho-how much is it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow much do I need to pay to buy this sword?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked again. The old man grinned at his question and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not for sale. I\u2019m not stupid enough to sell my best work to someone who can\u2019t even use it. Stop this nonsense and put it down.\u201d\u201cIf I can use it, w-will you sell it to me?\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered again, too mesmerized by the sword\u2019s might.\u201cWhat?\u201d the old man asked, baffled. \u201cWhat nonsense are you spewin\u2014\u201d\u201cThis is a Level 79 unnamed sword. Its stats are\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu began to read out the sword\u2019s status screen.\u201cY-you\u2026 You can see the sword\u2019s stats?\u201d\u201cYes, I can. Can you see them too, Sir?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d the old man gave Gi-Gyu an empty laugh, but his eyes were filled with euphoria. Gi-Gyu remained quiet and waited for the elder to speak. The old man ordered, \u201cGive me a minute, Min-Su. Go see your father for a while.\u201d\u201cSee Dad\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Grandpa has to talk with the customer you brought,\u201d the old man explained patiently.\u201cGrandpa! So I did well today? Did I bring the right customer this time?\u201d Min-Su asked excitedly.\u201cYes, you did very well. Now, change back to your clothes before you go. Stop wearing the things Grandpa made, will you? Your dad\u2019s going to lose it.\u201d\u201cBut this smells so nice, Grandpa\u2026\u201d Min-Su grumbled and walked up to a corner where a perfectly fine set of pants and shirt lay. This situation would pique anyone\u2019s curiosity, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t care less because of the incredible objects around him. There weren\u2019t many items in the workshop, but just like the unnamed sword, the rest were also Egos.[Unnamed armor][Level 35][Unnamed boots][Level 64][Unnamed hood][Level 23]They were all labeled unnamed because they weren't given any names yet. When Gi-Gyu was busy admiring the items, the old man offered, \u201cLet\u2019s talk now.\u201dMin-Su, the old man\u2019s grandson, had finally left the store. The old man\u2019s eyes sparkled as they began their conversation.***\u201cI guess I was right. Your rings were glowing so brightly that I suspected something, but\u2026 There are plenty of other players with glowing items, so I wasn\u2019t completely certain.\" The old man only began an earnest conversation after Gi-Gyu briefly told him about his Egos. Gi-Gyu had no other choice because the old man refused to sell him anything before learning the truth.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cDid you make everything in this workshop?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d-What?!-How can he create Egos?The old man\u2019s answer drew comical astonishment from Lou and El. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow do you make them?\u201d\u201cWhat a shameless question! Are you really asking a blacksmith to reveal his secret?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but didn\u2019t I also share my secret?\u201d Gi-Gyu insisted, but the old man refused again, \u201cWhine all you want; the answer is still no.\u201dGi-Gyu asked another question, \u201cFine. Will you sell them now that you know I can use them?\u201d\u201cI will, but only if you can prove to me that you can truly use them,\u201d the old man promised, making Gi-Gyu glow with excitement.Why was this shabby workshop filled with Egos? Who was this old man? How did he come to make these Egos? What was the true identity of these Egos?He had many questions, but his current priority was to obtain the items. For something so precious, Gi-Gyu was willing to pay any price. Fortunately, the old man\u2019s place and clothes looked nice enough to tell Gi-Gyu that he wasn\u2019t in for the money.Actually, everything was going suspiciously well.Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll prove that with this unnamed sword. You okay with that?\u201d\u201cA blacksmith always wants his work to reach someone who recognizes its value. Only a player who can use my items to their full potential is worthy of them. So, yes, please go ahead.\u201dAfter getting permission, Gi-Gyu picked up the unnamed sword expectantly. Now, all he had to do was give it a name; then, he would be its owner. The excitement covered him with goosebumps as he thought about his amazing luck. Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cYour name is Sharpness.\u201dIt was not the trendiest name, but Gi-Gyu liked the sound of it when he read it on the sword's status screen. Now, all that was left was for Sharpness to sync with him and become his. Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart refused to calm down; instead, it pounded louder with each passing second. But\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201d Gi-Gyu gasped in confusion.\u201cHuh.\" The old man looked unimpressed with this turn of events.To Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, nothing happened. The sword didn't sync with him no matter how long he waited. Gi-Gyu tried again, thinking he wasn\u2019t clear with his command.\u201cI said your name is Sharpness\u2026 Okay?\u201d\u201c...\u201dWho could\u2019ve thought that yelling the same command again and again would change nothing? The old man asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201dGi-Gyu replied in confusion, \u201cPlease excuse me for a moment.\u201dSilently, Gi-Gyu asked Lou and El, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019-I told you these aren\u2019t normal Egos. And even if they were, you aren\u2019t even an Ego Master. So did you really think you could force a sync with all Egos in this world? Egos are very picky when it comes to choosing their masters. El and I had no choice but to accept you. Had we had a choice to wait out for someone else, did you really think we would\u2019ve chosen you? Huh! I would\u2019ve waited an eternity if I had a choice.It seemed like the hard, depressing truth. Gi-Gyu felt sad.-I\u2019m not like Lou. I like you, Master.\u2018Thanks, El!\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu was happy again.Despite El's consolation, the fact still remained that Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t sync with this unnamed sword. It was a tad disappointing, but he wasn\u2019t going to give up just like that.Gi-Gyu picked up the unnamed hood and yelled, \u201cYour name is Brilliant Hood!\u201dHis naming skills, again, failed to impress everyone.-Are you serious?Again, much to Gi-Gyu's confusion, nothing happened. Disappointed, the old man said, \u201cI guess you can\u2019t use my items either. Things must\u2019ve worked out for you somehow with those rings, but it doesn't seem to be the case with my works. You should just be satisfied with those two items and leave.\u201dThis seemed like a good time to give up, but Gi-Gyu stood his ground. Filled with frustration, he decided to try one last time. He picked up the unnamed armor and yelled desperately, \u201cYour name is Brunheart! Please sync with me!\u201dGi-Gyu closed his eyes tightly as he prayed for this to work. This was his last chance to get an amazing Ego.[You have synced with Ego Brunheart.][You can now access Brunheart\u2019s information.][You lack necessary skills, so you can\u2019t use all of Brunheart\u2019s abilities.][Brunheart has lost most of its abilities.]The unnamed armor, now named Brunheart, shone brightly.\u201cOhhhhh! Thank you! Thank you, Brunheart!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed in delight. The old man, just as ecstatic, screamed, \u201cYou! I\u2019ve finally found someone who can use my items!\u201dGi-Gyu found the jet-black leather armor on his torso after the light dissipated. With a keen look in his eyes, he asked the old man, \u201cSir! How much is this armor?\u201dBy then, the brilliance had disappeared completely, and Brunheart\u2019s abilities had been transferred to Gi-Gyu, allowing him to feel a genuine satisfaction.\u201cThat\u2019ll be 3.5 billion won, Sir,\u201d the old man answered in a very business-like tone. His excitement from earlier was completely replaced by a perfect professional demeanor. Gi-Gyu stammered, \u201cB-but Min-Su told me you\u2019ll give me a discount.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s only 3.5 billion won, Sir.\u201d***\u2018I now owe him 3.45 billion won, but he said I can take my time paying it back. So\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu was no novice, so he negotiated to the best of his abilities, but the old man refused to budge. Besides, negotiating the price of an object made by such an incredible craftsman seemed disrespectful and plain wrong. In the end, Gi-Gyu explained his situation, and they signed a contract. Gi-Gyu was now burdened with an unexpected debt of 3.45 billion won, but he was actually happy about it. He murmured, \u201cI\u2019m so lucky! I got it for just 3.5 billion won.\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu opened Brunheart\u2019s status screen.[Brunheart][Level 7][Power: 15][Speed: 3][Stamina: 40][Magic: 6][Accessory][Defense: 12]Gi-Gyu obtained a single item, but its benefit would increase with each level up. There were some rare items high-ranking players used for a similar effect. However, their price and compatibility left a select few desiring them.Gi-Gyu murmured happily, \u201cI think I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d-Did you forget you can't sync with all the Egos.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked Lou. He had been dreaming about how he could become the strongest player if he ever became rich enough to buy all the items inside that old man\u2019s shop. He could even buy those overpriced Egos at the auction house with enough money.-To sync with an Ego, the said Ego\u2019s intention matters, of course, but the master\u2019s ability is key too. Do you really think you can simultaneously control several Egos' consciousnesses? Or even just their strength?-Lou is right. You already have Lou and me, two excellent Egos, Master. You may not realize it, but I suspect that just controlling us should be straining you at your current level.-As long as you\u2019re a human, you shouldn\u2019t have unreasonable expectations. El and I are already top-rate Egos. So, if you get to sync with an Ego in the future, think very carefully before jumping the gun.After hearing the explanation, Gi-Gyu realized Lou and El were right, and he just couldn't sync with an unlimited number of Egos. But from the way Lou said it, Gi-Gyu surmised the task would\u2019ve been possible had he not been a human. But, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand what Lou meant by it. Anyway, for now, he decided he had more than enough.-Also, remember, we know as much about this new Ego as you do. Since it lacks consciousness and is only a fragment, I believe its growth will be much more limited than ours.\u201cI see,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied in understanding. He could see where Lou and El were coming from, considering their situation. But for now, he couldn\u2019t help but be excited about the most effective item ever.Now, he had four days left before his priority pass expired. He had spent the whole day looking for items, and he had to spend another day meeting with Tae-Shik. This meant he only had one extra day to do what he wished. Gi-Gyu\u2019s plan was to spend that day hunting to maximize his offensive capabilities. He announced, \u201cNow, let\u2019s all work really hard! Lou! El! Brunheart!\u201d-You\u2019re so childish.-Don\u2019t worry, Master.Because Brunheart didn\u2019t have a consciousness, it didn\u2019t reply.Before long, Gi-Gyu stood on the 13th floor. This place was mostly inhabited by gargoyles. He murmured, \u201cShall I test out Brunheart's defense prowess first?\u201dGargoyles were made of stones, so a single punch from them could cause much damage. Gi-Gyu had heard that the gargoyles on the higher floors could even shoot laser beams. Thankfully, the ones here could only throw punches.\u2018If I let their attacks graze me lightly, I\u2019m sure the damage will be minimal.\u2019Gi-Gyu held stamina recovery and defense increasing potions; It was finally time to test Brunheart\u2019s ability.\u201cKweeek!\u201d a gargoyle from afar spotted Gi-Gyu and screeched. Then, it immediately began running toward him. The gargoyles had wings, but the ones on the 13th floor were too heavy to fly.Ktunk! Ktunk! Ktunk!The human-sized gargoyle stormed toward him as it shook the ground. It threw its balled fist at Gi-Gyu as soon as it got close enough.\u2018It\u2019s so slow.\u2019Gi-Gyu could clearly see the gargoyle\u2019s movement as if the monster was moving in slow motion. He twisted his body slightly, and the monster\u2019s fist grazed Brunheart lightly. Had there been direct contact, it would\u2019ve been dangerous, but a little graze was something he could handle.Crack!\u201cHuh?\u201dTo Gi-Gyu's surprise, the gargoyle\u2019s fist crumbled as soon as it touched Brunheart. Gi-Gyu took a step back in confusion and muttered, \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201dThe gargoyle, obviously in pain, screamed.[Brunheart\u2019s lost abilities have now been recovered.][Brunheart\u2019s skills are being revealed.][Reflect: A portion of an attack\u2019s damage is reflected back toward the enemy.]\u201cT-this is incredible!\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he looked back and forth between the shrieking gargoyle and BrunheartPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17. A Fragment of an Ego (1)Gi-Gyu had promised Tae-Shik that he would visit after completing his preparation. So, after obtaining Brunheart, repairing the disposable items, and completing a round of hunting, Gi-Gyu visited Tae-Shik.\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cJust follow me,\u201d Tae-Shik ordered. Gi-Gyu followed him without a word. When they entered Tae-Shik\u2019s office, he pointed at Brunheart and asked, \u201cIs that an Ego too?\u201d\u201cYes, I somehow ended up with another,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied nonchalantly.\u201cReally? From what you told me, Egos didn\u2019t sound like stuff one can find easily,\u201d Tae-Shik mentioned in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019m pretty lucky,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered, making Tae-Shik grin. Tae-Shik replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re lucky. After all the hardships you\u2019ve endured in the last five years, I think you deserve everything you\u2019re getting right now.\u201dTae-Shik had personally witnessed how hard life was for Gi-Gyu, so he should be happy for Gi-Gyu; for some reason, his brow furrowed as his lips curved upward.After their brief chat, Tae-Shik led Gi-Gyu to the basement of the\u00a0Player Association\u2019s\u00a0Seoul\u00a0branch.\u00a0Gi-Gyu saw\u00a0many players as he followed Tae-Shik in the basement; they all seemed to be in a hurry, running around while using their abilities to do so quickly. From this, one could guess this was where the association agents trained.\u201cGeneral Manager!\u201d one player greeted Oh Tae-Shik. The rest of the players bowed to Tae-Shik when they recognized him, but Tae-Shik waved his hand at them dismissively and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, and keep training.\u201dGi-Gyu followed Tae-Shik across the spacious basement, and the duo soon stood before a small metal door. Tae-Shik announced with a blank face, \u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d When he opened the door, Gi-Gyu \u00a0asked, \u201cWhere is this place?\u201d\u201cThis is a part of the training hall,\u201d Tae-Shik explained. Inside the metal door was a huge open space; Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe this building had such a ginormous room beneath it. All of the walls were white, and it was clear they weren't just ordinary concrete structures\u2014they looked stronger than steel.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cMost spars take place in this part of the training hall, but it hadn\u2019t been used recently.\u201dGi-Gyu seemed to be listening intently, but his head was filled with questions.\u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0Even if this is the Seoul branch\u2019s basement, the size of this place still doesn\u2019t make sense. Just the ceilings are way too high. And what are those walls made of? Are they being protected by some kind of a barrier?\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s head moving like a chicken didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Tae-Shik; he laughed and explained, \u201cThe association is a pretty capable group.\u201d\u201cI can see that,\u201d Gi-Gyu agreed.\u201cSo, have you thought about my suggestion? I\u2019m talking about you working for the association. With the recent changes in your situation, you won\u2019t have to work a desk job or even become my secretary. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be hired as an agent or something similar,\u201d Tae-Shik asked cautiously. Gi-Gyu gave him a bitter smile and replied, \u201cI appreciate your offer, but I think I\u2019ll have to pass.\u201dAfter five tough years, Gi-Gyu finally had the chance to become a real and possibly strong player; he wasn\u2019t going to waste it. The association wanted to be more powerful than the guilds, so it had a well-run system in its place which treated its players fairly and generously.Despite the very many perks, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to belong to the association, let alone any other organization. His unwillingness also stemmed from the fact that it was difficult to leave these groups once a player joined them\u2018Being in a group always trumps being alone; it can also speed up one\u2019s progress. However, individual opinions mean nothing in a group.\u2019To Gi-Gyu, the most important thing was the people around him. This included his family and people like Tae-Shik in his life. So, what if the group he joined became hostile toward these people? Or what if he was given an order he didn\u2019t want to obey?Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want these kinds of complications in his life. Tae-Shik replied quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to get you a position inside the association, so let me know if you ever change your mind.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cSo you probably know by now why I brought you here, right?\u201d Tae-Shik changed the subject.\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a nod and guessed, \u201cYou want to spar with me, right?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cYou want to test me to see if I'm good enough. If you feel I can solo hunt inside the gate, you\u2019ll let me do it. Am I correct?\u201d\u201cI love how quick you are. This is why you\u2019re my favorite, Gi-Gyu. If you aren\u2019t up to my standard, you better give up this solo hunt idea. I\u2019ll help you sell the priority pass at the highest price possible,\u201d Tae-Shik laid out the plan. Without a word, Gi-Gyu prepared Brunheart, Lou, El, and got battle-ready.When he looked back at his opponent, he found Tae-Shik standing far away with his fists raised. Tae-Shik wasn\u2019t wearing any armor or holding a spear, his usual weapon of choice. Right now, he had no weapon, armor, or special item apart from his regular clothes.Had Gi-Gyu been a prideful or arrogant player, he would\u2019ve been offended. He might have even yelled, \u201cYou dare fight with me unarmed?! You better do your best not to die!\u201d Thankfully, Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t, and he wasn\u2019t going to shout something so stupid either.Oh Tae-Shik was once a high ranker. Even now, he was so capable he got the General Manager position just because he wanted to. Gi-Gyu felt thankful Tae-Shik was just using his fists for this spar.Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Sir.\u201d\u201cI like your attitude, Gi-Gyu.\u201dTheir eyes narrowed a bit for focus, and their breaths came into a rhythm.\u201cHup!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled as he made the first move. He kicked the floor for speed and sprinted toward Tae-Shik with Lou.Clang!But, Lou wobbled like a twig when it met Tae-Shik\u2019s palm.\u2018He\u2019s a beast!\u2019It was no wonder Tae-Shik was a high ranker; his power was beyond anything a human could muster. Gi-Gyu openly admired Tae-Shik\u2019s strength and skill in blocking Lou, but he remained focused. Without panicking, he composed himself to swing El. Gi-Gyu stood his ground firmly before sprinting toward his opponent again. But just when El was about to reach Tae-Shik\u2019s head, it swerved slightly. It didn\u2019t take Tae-Shik long to realize it was Gi-Gyu\u2019s hesitancy that caused this sudden change in direction.\u201cHey, you insolent jerk! Focus! You think you can even make a small scratch on me?! Don\u2019t be afraid to hurt me and aim for my vulnerable spots!\u201d Tae-Shik screamed in annoyance. Just as Tae-Shik stated, Gi-Gyu\u2019s hesitancy just now was utterly useless. Gi-Gyu groaned, \u201cUgh\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu changed El's direction at the very last minute, superfluously worried that El might hurt Tae-Shik. That mistake cost him dearly since the strike lost most of its might after the deviation. Tae-Shik easily whacked El out of Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand with his palm, and she flew across the basement. Now, Gi-Gyu was in no position to aim Lou in the right direction.Gi-Gyu was now defenseless, and Tae-Shik wasn\u2019t kind enough to miss such an opportunity.Boom!An explosive bang resounded in the room; it was of Tae-Shik\u2019s palm colliding with Brunheart.\u201cAckkk!\u201d Gi-Gyu screamed as his body flew and became pinned against the wall; he was hit hard in the pit of the stomach. His body slid down helplessly to the floor; then, he threw up bright-red blood.\u201cBlegh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu gagged as he coughed up blood and sprayed it all over the floor. Lou and El were on the floor far away from him, leaving just Brunheart on his person.\u2018Dammit!\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu swore silently. The difference in power was simply too big and utterly out of his expectations. Gi-Gyu thought he could at least scratch Tae-Shik a few times. He even imagined himself driving Tae-Shik against the wall with a little luck.But, the final result was pathetic. Tae-Shik hadn\u2019t moved a single step from where he stood, and it was Gi-Gyu who was driven to the wall while vomiting blood all over the place.Just then, a small plastic bottle was dropped in front of Gi-Gyu. Tae-Shik said, \u201cIt\u2019s the potion for the internal damage. Drink it.\u201d\u201cWhy would you keep the potion in something like this?\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered as he wiped his mouth. He opened the bottle, took a sip, and enjoyed the warm sensation the potion brought to his stomach. Internal injuries had to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage.Tae-Shik announced, \u201cYou\u2019ve passed.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in surprise. His question was soon answered by the small scratch on Tae-Shik's fist. It was a minor cut, but it was still deep enough to cause bleeding.Tae-Shik wiped the blood from his fist and asked with genuine curiosity, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu crowed. The bleeding on Tae-Shik stopped quickly; within a few minutes, the small scratch disappeared as well. Still flopping on the floor, Gi-Gyu scratched his head and replied, \u201cI got really lucky with my item, I guess.\u201d***\u201cYou have a week from today. If the gate isn\u2019t cleared in a week, association agents will be sent in,\u201d an association member who managed the gates explained to Gi-Gyu in a professional manner.\u201cOkay, I understand,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cThen I wish you best of luck in clearing the gate,\u201d the man said without much expression. Usually, association employees dealt with Gi-Gyu with much care after learning about his close relationship with Tae-Shik. However, now that Tae-Shik was standing right beside them, the man couldn\u2019t help but squeeze out every ounce of professionalism he had.Tae-Shik warned Gi-Gyu, \u201cForget about getting a whole week. Five days. I\u2019m giving you five days. If you aren\u2019t out by then, there will be no agents\u2014I\u2019ll personally drag you out.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Gi-Gyu protested, but Tae-Shik shook his head and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s actually cheaper for me to go in than paying the agents the travel fee.\u201dTurning away from Tae-Shik, who couldn\u2019t hide his worry, Gi-Gyu rummaged through his bag to do one last check of all the necessary items before entering the gate.\u2018So I\u2019ve got my potions, smoke shells, and food\u2026\u2019When he was satisfied, Gi-Gyu tied the bag and turned toward Tae-Shik to say goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. This is only an F-Class Gate, so I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be that dangerous.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t act too cocky,\u201d Tae-Shik replied as he patted Gi-Gyu\u2019s shoulder affectionately.-Isn\u2019t this similar to that gate we hunted before? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re entering a haunted temple, so why is he making such a fuss?\u2018He\u2019s like a father to me. He\u2019s just worried, that\u2019s all.\u2019-Tsk.Gi-Gyu still hadn\u2019t entered the gate. Frustrated, Lou urged Gi-Gyu to get going.\u2018I already contacted Mom and Yoo-Jung, so all I have left to do is go inside.\u2019Gi-Gyu was finally ready and began walking toward the gate. Its blue color shook beautifully as if it was welcoming him. Gi-Gyu said to Tae-Shik, \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201cGood luck,\u201d Tae-Shik replied; with that, Gi-Gyu\u2019s entered the gate.***[You have entered the gate.]Gi-Gyu found himself in a humid cave. The place felt familiar, but it was different from the fifth-floor test cave where he first met Lou. This particular spot had a subtle brilliance and looked unique.-Doesn\u2019t look like much. Why did you have to take so long yapping back there?\u201cShut up, Lou.\u201d-Master, please be careful. Your safety is always our priority.\u201cThanks.\u201dGi-Gyu transformed both Lou and El into their sword forms and began walking. Brunheart was already on his torso in its black leather armor form.\u201cHigher-level gates tend to be bigger, but that\u2019s not true in all cases. We can\u2019t be certain of anything in here,\u201d Gi-Gyu warned. As he walked slowly, he mentally organized all the information he had gathered about the gates over the years. Gi-Gyu heard many things during his five-year tenure as a guide. This wasn\u2019t his first time inside a gate, but he still couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous. After all, this was his very first solo hunt.\u201cAs long as this isn\u2019t a maze-shaped gate, an F-Class Gate shouldn\u2019t take long to clear,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as if to reassure himself.Gates came in many shapes, and the hardest known forms were the maze, the underground, and the tower.\u201cIf this is a sustained type gate, then\u2026\u201dBeing the first player to clear a particular gate was the most important thing in gate hunting. One-shot gates provided many rewards when cleared and then disappeared permanently, but the sustained gates continued to exist afterward. To find out what type of gate this was, Gi-Gyu had to clear it. If it turned out to be a sustained type, he didn\u2019t have to worry about a gate break after it was cleared once. Instead, he could end up with a lot of money from renting the gate out.\u201cHuh?\u201dRustle...Gi-Gyu suddenly stopped walking when he felt a monster\u2019s presence. It was coming from a corner he couldn\u2019t see. Gi-Gyu resumed walking but slowly this time and with taut nerves.\u2018There are three.\u2019He could feel three monsters nearby. Thanks to Lou, El, and Brunheart's rising levels, Gi-Gyu\u2019s instinct had improved as well. So now, he could calculate the number of enemies and their conditions before facing them.\u2018What kind of monsters are they?\u2019He still hadn\u2019t found out what kind of monsters inhabited this gate. If a guild won the priority pass, it would\u2019ve sent a team of scouts by now. But as a commoner player with no money, Gi-Gyu only had himself to do all the work.\u201cGrrr!\u201d a black creature growled as it suddenly jumped toward Gi-Gyu from the corner.\u201cHup!\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t panic as he swung Lou to slice the monster.\u201cA wolf?\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered when he finally saw his opponent. After getting injured by Lou, the wolf was glaring at Gi-Gyu while baring its fangs. Soon after, two more wolves appeared from the same corner. Gi-Gyu controlled his breath and announced, \u201cThey\u2019re just wolves!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t going to be difficult at all. Gi-Gyu\u2019s lips were already curling up into a smile as Lou and El glowed. The two swords began slashing at the wolves quickly. The wolves were fast, but Gi-Gyu was faster. The monsters\u2019 sharp teeth couldn\u2019t break through Brunheart, which meant Gi-Gyu was well protected. The reflection skill even broke the wolves\u2019 teeth.\u201cArf!\u201d\u201cArffff!\u201dBefore long, two of the wolves moaned in pain and collapsed to the ground. Gi-Gyu yelled excitedly, \u201cWhat a great start!\u201dThen, he thrust Lou toward the third wolf\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18. A Fragment of an Ego (2)\u201cLet\u2019s take a break here.\u201d-You\u2019re such a human.-You\u2019re being rude to our Master, Lou.Feeling tired from the continuous hunts, Gi-Gyu sat down after making sure he was safe. After killing nearly all the monsters within his perimeters, he felt he deserved a quick rest. So, he brought out his bonfire kit, started a flame, and began eating a piece of jerky.\u201cHow long has it been so far?\u201d he murmured as he looked down at his old watch. Because electric devices didn\u2019t work inside the gates, most players were used to wearing an old-fashioned analog watch.\u201cWe\u2019ve been hunting for five hours straight.\u201d For that entire span, Gi-Gyu had a one-track mind about going forward. It was no wonder he was tired since he had been incessantly hunting for five hours.Gi-Gyu learned so far that this gate was inhabited by the blue wolves. These monsters were about as strong as the creatures on the Tower\u2019s 8th floor. The blue wolves were known to have incredible stamina and annoyingly tenacious nature, but\u2026\u201cGosh, they are no better than the orcs,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. So far, no wolf could survive more than two swings of Lou and El, which made them about as strong as the orcs. It was a testament to Gi-Gyu\u2019s increased strength, but he still felt a bit bitter. The fact of the matter was that all this strength, power, and might wasn\u2019t his. Without the swords, he would be the same \u201cplayer who can\u2019t level up.\u201dGi-Gyu asked his Egos, \u201cIf I lose you guys, I\u2019ll return to being a weak, useless player, won't I?\u201d-...-You can continue to use our powers within a certain circumference. However, our connection will weaken if we are too far apart. And then, your ability to use our powers will become severely limited.\u201cI know. Lou already told me.\u201dGi-Gyu had asked Lou about this topic back when he wanted to get a player\u2019s credentials. Measuring a player\u2019s power involved getting into a machine powered by crystals naked. Players not only had to remove all their accessories and items but also their clothes. Consequently, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t obtain a player\u2019s credentials despite being strong enough. However, he was thankful for his strength and for coming this far.Gi-Gyu said to his Egos, \u201cI know I can\u2019t use the benefits of owning a player\u2019s credentials, like the tax deductions and such. But, without you guys, I would\u2019ve never even dreamt of hunting like this inside a gate alone.\u201d-Don\u2019t be so pathetic.-If you grow your abilities, I\u2019m sure someday you can use our powers regardless of how far apart we are, Master.It was no big mystery that El was the kind one of the two; she always consoled Gi-Gyu.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, you see. How am I supposed to grow strong? I\u2019ve gotten a job, some skills, and even a unique ability, yet I still haven\u2019t leveled up. My stats haven\u2019t moved an inch. I thought they would change after I passed the test, but\u2026\u201dEven after passing the 10th-floor test, nothing changed for him personally. His Egos kept on leveling up and gaining experience points, but nothing made a direct change in Gi-Gyu\u2019s stats. Still, he decided to stop worrying about it. He murmured, \u201cI\u2019m sure things will work out.\u201dHe then opened Lou's status screen.[Lou][Level 17][Power: 40][Speed: 54][Stamina: 50][Magic: 34][Available Skills][Accessory][Cannibalism: You can prey on corpses to regain stamina.]Lou had leveled up significantly, and his stats had increased a lot too. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cBut how do I make use of this cannibalism skill? Haa\u2026\u201dLou had gained this new skill, but how was Lou supposed to prey on the corpses? Did the system want Lou to open his imaginary mouth and eat what they hunted?Gi-Gyu gave up after mulling over it for a while. Then, he announced, \u201cLet\u2019s just get back to hunting.\u201d-Your order is my command, Master.-You\u2019re so fake, El.Gi-Gyu decided it was better to keep moving than worry about problems he didn\u2019t have solutions to.***\u201cArff!\u201d another blue wolf fell to the ground after being stabbed by Lou. Gi-Gyu quickly pulled out Lou and swung El to behead a wolf sneaking up on him from behind. The headless wolf collapsed to the ground as well.\u201cHaa\u2026 We must be getting closer to the boss monster\u2019s room.\u201d The monsters dying under his blades had been growing stronger; this meant they were approaching the boss\u2019 room. Gi-Gyu increased his pace and hunted the wolves before they could even attack him. So far, his stamina hadn\u2019t suffered much because the blue wolves were too weak.His lower body and arms had minor scratches because these parts lacked Brunheart's protection. However, his increased stamina stat patched them right up after a quick rest. Lou, El, and Brunheart's combined stamina gave Gi-Gyu nearly 100 points in stamina. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t take full advantage of it because of his low level, but utilizing just 30 points wasn\u2019t hard. Remember, a stamina of 30 points was what a tanker would normally possess. So, it was no wonder the blue wolves couldn\u2019t even leave a decent scratch on him.An abrupt thought came to Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind,\u00a0\u2018Then just how strong is Tae-Shik hyung?\u2019\u00a0This made him believe that rankers had non-human levels of power.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t remember how many system announcements he heard about Lou's speed increasing from absorbing the wolf\u2019s blood. After countless hunts, he spotted a giant cave in front of him.\u201cA cave within a cave,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured out loud as he sat down. The gates were considered wondrous things because they had these kinds of exotic features. This had to be the boss\u2019 room; even a newbie player could make this guess.Being the smart thing to do, Gi-Gyu decided to make some last-minute preparations before entering the boss\u2019 room. He muttered, \u201cI haven\u2019t used a single disposable item yet.\u201dSmoke shells, potion, emergency supplies\u2014all the items he spent much effort to obtain, untouched. The only disposable item he ended up using was the bonfire kit.Gi-Gyu felt disappointed and upset for all the time and energy he wasted in preparing for this hunt. But, his earnings so far seemed to make up for it.\u201cI got over 40 purple crystals. Should I get one of those bags with built-in expansion magic?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he looked down at his bag overflowing with crystals. Already having this kind of problem inside an F-Class Gate meant this trouble would just stack up in the higher-level gates. Without a convenient storage option, he would\u2019ve to enter and exit higher-level gates multiple times just to get his loot out. That would be like spitting on the thumb rule regarding gates: Don\u2019t leave them before clearing.Gate sizes varied from country to country; there were gates in some countries that were bigger than the entire nation of Korea. Therefore, going in and out of the gates multiple times was time consuming and dangerous. Hiring a porter to carry your loads wasn\u2019t a bad idea; because Gi-Gyu worked alone, he wasn\u2019t confident he could protect the porter and himself.\u201cWell, I can think about this later. For now, I need to buff up,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and took out all potion bottles except the red and orange ones; they were for internal and external injuries, respectively. Potion bottles looked like they were made of glass, but the material used was actually elastic, like rubber. These bottles were made of new materials synthesized by utilizing the crystals. Gi-Gyu quickly gulped down the contents of the bottles. He began with the green one, followed by three other colored potions.[You have drunk the goblin fluid.][Your stamina\u2019s temporarily increased by 3.][You have drunk the orc\u2019s blood.][Your stamina\u2019s temporarily increased by 5.][You have drunk the blessing potion.][All of your abilities will temporarily increase by 1.]The names and the tastes of these potions were awful, but their effects couldn\u2019t be denied. Players from the production category could harvest information or blood from monsters. They then processed it to make buff portions like these. Blessing potions, on the other hand, were created by players from the clergy category.Felling the raw power coursing through his veins, Gi-Gyu exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s already working!\u201d It might not look like much, but the increase from the potions was equivalent to three levels.-Don\u2019t make a fuss. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re at the gate right now. If we were outside, people would\u2019ve thought you\u2019re crazy for talking to yourself so loudly.-Don\u2019t be so disrespectful to our master, Lou.Gi-Gyu wondered if it was high time to teach Lou some manners again. However, he decided against it because of the new piece of trivia he had heard: Great animosity between the Ego and its master could decrease the assimilation rate. Also, he realized that he had indeed been talking a little too much with himself ever since he obtained the Egos. So\u2026 Gi-Gyu stood up and announced, \u201cIt\u2019s time to hunt the boss monster!\u201dYes, Gi-Gyu made himself believe he wasn\u2019t talking to himself, but to his Egos. After justifying his new habit, he headed inside the cave.***As Gi-Gyu entered deeper into the cave, he could feel the increasing pressure overwhelming his body. This was how the boss monsters showed off their strength.\u2018The boss must be pretty strong.\u2019Talon from his first gate had lost much of its strength because it belonged to a sustained gate that had been cleared several times previously. But this was the first time a player was attempting to clear this particular gate, so the never-been-hunted boss was showing off its intimidating presence.When Gi-Gyu finally entered the cave, he witnessed surprising scenery. He murmured, \u201cA prairie?\u201d He was expecting an even darker cave at the end; instead, a stretch of grassland greeted him. However, the lack of wind reminded Gi-Gyu he was still inside the gate.\u2018There\u2019s the boss monster.\u2019On a low hill was a giant blue wolf crouching down; it was so big it looked like a small hill on top of the hill it was sitting on. It was this gate\u2019s boss, also called the gatekeeper. These boss monsters were supposed to be as strong as the guardians inside the Tower.Unlike the weakened Talon that had been hunted multiple times inside the sustained gate, Gi-Gyu had no information on this wolf. In addition, this wolf was at its full power because it had never been hunted before. Realizing he was about to fight such an extraordinary creature, Gi-Gyu felt a little excited. It wasn\u2019t from the prospect of the oncoming battle but from what he might gain after killing this monster.\u201cGrr\u2026\u201d the giant wolf growled and rose after noticing Gi-Gyu.-Wow, that\u2019s a pretty strong monster. But of course, that\u2019s in comparison to you, Master.-Please be careful, Master.Lou was rude as usual, but Gi-Gyu could tell it was speaking out of concern for him.\u2018There isn\u2019t much time left till the effects of the potions run out.\u2019The cave turned out to be longer than his expectations, so he didn\u2019t have much time left till the effects of the potions ran out. There was always a chance a player could be attacked as soon as they entered the boss\u2019 room, so drinking all available buff potions before facing the boss was a common practice. But, in this case, he ended up wasting the limited time the potions offered.Gi-Gyu raised Lou and El simultaneously; after spending so much time with them, his form didn\u2019t look as awkward as before. And then there were those five years he spent hunting goblins.\u201cGrrrrrr!\u201d the huge blue wolf roared; its breath was akin to a gale inside the prairie.\u201cKrr!\u201d The monster sprinted toward Gi-Gyu with full force.\u201cHuu\u2026 Huu\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu calmly controlled his breathing in the face of this massive pressure. And rather than trying to avoid the monster\u2019s attack, he decided to face it straight on. Gi-Gyu gripped Lou hard, making the muscles on his right arm bulge. The blue wolf was getting close with each passing second. Then, when it thought it was close enough, the monster suddenly kicked the ground and jumped to the sky. For a moment, Gi-Gyu thought the world had darkened, but then\u2026Clunkkk!The giant blue wolf\u2019s long and massive canine clashed with Lou, causing a loud roaring sound. As the sparks flew, Lou broke a chunk off its fang. Just then, Gi-Gyu\u2019s used his left hand to swing El like a whip.***\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu huffed audibly. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he felt this tired or hurt; every part his body was covered in lacerations except his torso. He suffered so many cuts that one could see his fight plan printed in blood on the ground.Plop!Gi-Gyu\u2019s legs had been shaking for a while; in the end, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from squatting down on the ground.\u201cGrr\u2026\u201dWhen the wolf groaned weakly, Gi-Gyu yelled in annoyance, \u201cShut up, you stupid mutt.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe how tired he was feeling all thanks to this wolf. When he checked his watch, he realized he had been fighting this blue wolf for over three hours. Now, the wolf lay in front of him, defeated. From time to time, it cried and moaned quietly, but it could no longer move. After all, its legs were a mess after sustaining uncountable cuts from Lou and El. It also suffered a large gash on its stomach from where its organs were spilling out.\u201cI got lucky,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. Toward the end, the wolf was at an advantage for a moment; it panned on swallowing Gi-Gyu whole. Blaming himself for what was happening, he was prepared to die when suddenly, the accumulated damage inside Brunheart reflected toward the wolf. The monster fell from the force, and Gi-Gyu was able to gain a miraculous win.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is how strong an F-Class Gate's boss really is\u2026\u201dThis couldn\u2019t even compare to what Gi-Gyu experienced with Talon from the other gate. To celebrate surviving this day, he decided he would pat Lou and El every day to increase their assimilation level.Gi-Gyu\u2019s legs still shook dangerously, so he used Lou to help himself up.-I\u2019m not a cane!Gi-Gyu grinned and slowly walked toward the wolf. Since it was a boss monster, he knew it was going to recover quickly. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t even imagine how he was going to survive if the wolf managed to get up and began fighting again. Even as he wondered that, one of the monster\u2019s legs was bubbling as it healed.\u201cThank you,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured appreciatively. He really was grateful to the wolf for dying in his hands. Then, Gi-Gyu plunged Lou into the middle of the wolf\u2019s head.[You have eliminated the boss Chang-Gyung.][You have gained experience points.][Lou is absorbing Chang-Gyung\u2019s blood.][Lou has absorbed Chang-Gyung\u2019s blood to gain the agility stat.][Lou has absorbed Chang-Gyung\u2019s blood to gain a skill.][Strong Will: When suffering unbearable damage, it can provide a quick stamina recovery.]Because he gained the experience points, Gi-Gyu felt it was safe to assume he succeeded in killing the blue wolf.[Cannibalism is being activated.]\u201cHuh?\u201d Gi-Gyu gasped as he watched the blue wolf slowly disappear. As if it was being eaten away by a set of strong jaws, portion after portion of the monster's corpse began to disappear. When the entire monster finally vanished, there was only a navy crystal left in its place. The navy crystals were higher quality than the purple ones; therefore, slightly more expensive. The crystal in front of him wasn\u2019t small either, so Gi-Gyu was happy to realize that it was going to bring him a pretty penny.Gi-Gyu also felt energized as his stamina recovered.[Lou has absorbed Chang-Gyung.][The blue wolf, Chang-Gyung, has been successfully\u00a0egofied.]Gi-Gyu heard the system\u2019s announcement; suddenly, he realized something new had just occurred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19. A Fragment of an Ego (3)\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in surprise.-I don\u2019t know! I\u2019ve never heard about a monster transforming into an Ego!Everything was new to Lou\u2014no surprise there. Gi-Gyu asked El, \u201cHow about you, El? Do you know anything about this?\u201d-No, nothing. I apologize, Master.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed and sat down on the ground. His mind was still tired and drained from the long battle; thanks to the cannibalism skill, his stamina had recovered. He murmured, \u201cEgofied\u2026 Does that mean\u00a0Chang-Gyung\u2019s Ego now belongs to Lou?\u201d-Nope. Not me.Then what? If neither El nor Lou had anything to do with this, where did Chang-Gyung go? And who did it belong to? Filled with doubts, Gi-Gyu decided to check his status screen.[Level 1][Job: Ego\u2019s partner][Unique Ability: Sync][Skill: Assimilation][Retained Ego: Chang-Gyung]\u201cHuh?\u201d Gi-Gyu gasped when he saw the new line at the end of his short status screen. He wondered out loud, \u201cSo\u2026 how do I use this retained Ego?\u201d Now that Chang-Gyung was his retained Ego, there had to be a way to make use of it. So, quite like the time he got Luo, Gi-Gyu tried yelling \u201cEgo,\u201d \u201cSync,\u201d \u201cChang-Gyung,\u201d and more words of the same verity. Again, quite like that time, nothing happened.\u201cMaybe I can\u2019t use it yet?\u201dHe tried everything he could think of; when nothing happened, he came up with two possible explanations. First, retained Egos weren\u2019t meant to be functional. Or, the second one, he had to satisfy some unknown, preset condition to make this work.He murmured, \u201cI would love nothing more than to use it right now, but I guess I\u2019ve to take my time learning about it. I\u2019m just happy we figured out how the cannibalism skill works.\u201d-Yeah. I had no idea cannibalism could be used to do something like that. Egofying a monster\u2026 I don\u2019t know if this was possible because of you, Master, or because cannibalism is a special skill.Lou was his usual, confused self when Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here first.\u201d After bagging the navy crystal Chang-Gyung left behind, he searched the area for anything more. Unfortunately, he came out empty-handed.\u201cI guess there isn\u2019t a bonus item here,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered in disappointment. In the Guri City Gate, he obtained the Dagger of Paralysis, but this gate was a dud. There was no doubt Gi-Gyu earned a lot here, but he couldn\u2019t help being greedy. After all, Gi-Gyu was always hungry for more. Then again, gate items weren\u2019t cabbages: they were very rare. Demand for them was higher than ever, but their supply was severely lacking; consequently, their bank-breaking price was actually reasonable.Feeling fully recovered now, Gi-Gyu stretched his arms and got ready to leave the gate. But suddenly, he gasped as he whispered, \u201cW-wait\u2026\u201d He had this fleeting feeling that he was forgetting something; soon, it struck him. He stammered, \u201cI-it\u2019s not here.\u201d-What isn\u2019t?-What is wrong, Master?\u201cChang-Gyung\u2019s corpse disappeared because of cannibalism! Inside the gates, players have to touch the keeper\u2019s corpse if they want to be transferred to the reward chamber!\u201d If there was a second way, Gi-Gyu hadn\u2019t heard of it. Gi-Gyu murmured in frustration, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dHe could return home by turning around and going back to the gate entrance. But, he wouldn\u2019t get the rewards he earned today if he did that. Also, would the gate even be considered clear if he walked out like this? Since the gate now lacked the boss monster, it didn\u2019t seem like any other groups or guilds could clear the gate either. Did that mean a gate break would still occur after a month or so?Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind went into overdrive, trying to come up with a solution. In the end, he couldn\u2019t figure it out, so he muttered, \u201cGuess, I gotta look for the reward chamber, myself.\u201dUnfortunately, he came up with zilch after multiple searches. But, Gi-Gyu still suspected that if there was another way into the reward chamber, it had to be located within the boss\u2019s room.So Gi-Gyu continued to roam the vast grassland alone.***By now, Gi-Gyu had spent three days inside the gate that formed in front of his home. Reaching and killing the boss took the first two days, and he wasted the third day looking for the reward chamber.\u201cHyung must be so worried,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in concern. Given how deeply Tae-Shik cared about Gi-Gyu, he had to be worried sick because Gi-Gyu still hadn\u2019t left the gate.Gi-Gyu knew the only reason Tae-Shik hadn't come looking for him was the five-day promise. Gi-Gyu guessed that Tae-Shik was probably dying to enter the gate by now. He couldn\u2019t tell if Tae-Shik was being overprotective because Tae-Shik still thought of him as a weak Level 1 player. Or perhaps Tae-Shik didn\u2019t care about his newfound strength at all. Either way, Gi-Gyu felt both thankful and burdened by Tae-Shik\u2019s fatherly behavior. Tae-Shik wasn\u2019t related to him by blood, and it wasn\u2019t like Gi-Gyu had known him all his life. Yet, Tae-Shik seemed to care about Gi-Gyu like family.\u201cLet\u2019s just eat,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced as he sat down and took out a piece of jerky. Thankfully, he still had plenty of food left.-Why don\u2019t you just go outside and ask for help?-It\u2019s heartbreaking to see you suffer, Master.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t leave like this. I need to find a way on my own no matter what.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Lou asked in annoyance.-Why do you refuse to ask for help? The other humans might not be able to help you, but how stupid is roaming around this prairie alone? Is this necessary?\u201cIf I leave the gate like this, people will find out that the boss\u2019 corpse disappeared. Remember how the Guri City Gate perished after I entered even though it was a sustained type? It happened long after I left, so nobody suspects me so far, but if this gate turns out to be another special case, people are going to become suspicious of me.\u201dSuspicion had a nasty habit of turning into unwanted interest, and that kind of interest could be poisonous. Consequently, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t leave the gate and ask for help.Gi-Gyu suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s try killing every monster inside this gate.\u201d Even inside the sustained gates, the monsters didn\u2019t regenerate until the gate was cleared. The same had to be true for this gate, so Gi-Gyu thought a solution might appear if he hunted every monster that inhabited this place.With this plan, Gi-Gyu began to move.***The fourth day.Because the gate wasn\u2019t big, eliminating all the monsters inside didn\u2019t take Gi-Gyu long. During his hunt, El and Brunheart leveled up. However, after a certain point, Lou stopped gaining any more of the wolf monsters' agility.Now, the gate was free of all its monsters; Gi-Gyu confirmed this by checking every nook and cranny of this gate. But despite killing every wolf here, he still couldn\u2019t find a way to the reward chamber.\u201cI only have one more day left,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured worriedly. Tomorrow, Tae-Shik would enter the gate and find out there was no boss monster.\u201cArghhh!\u201d Gi-Gyu screamed as he scratched his head in annoyance. Things were becoming too complicated.-Something feels strange.\u201cWhat is?\u201d Lou\u2019s sudden announcement was met with Gi-Gyu\u2019s sparkling, hope-filled eyes.-This space\u2019s energy is being focused on a single spot.-I can feel it too. It\u2019s as if this gate\u2019s entire energy\u2019s being sucked in.\u201cWhat? To where?!\u201dFinally, he seemingly had a clue to reaching the reward chamber.-The place where the big, blue wolf was!-It\u2019s where the gatekeeper was found!Lou and El answered at the same time. Gi-Gyu exclaimed, \u201cThe prairie!\u201d He immediately began running toward the boss\u2019 room. With his enhanced abilities and agility stat, Gi-Gyu was much faster than before. When he was first trying to find the boss\u2019 room, he didn\u2019t know the way. He also had to kill monsters as he went along, so it took much longer the first time. But now, the path to the boss\u2019 room was pretty straight, so Gi-Gyu reached it in no time.\u201cWhat's this?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion when he entered the boss\u2019 room. The spot where Chang-Gyung died was now acting as a congregation point for a bunch of golden beams.Lou murmured quietly.-Fragments of an Ego\u2026-This can\u2019t be. Why are Egos so common in this world?Without replying to his Egos, Gi-Gyu walked toward where Chang-Gyung died. There, the lights converged to form a small marble. Soon, the light beams disappeared, leaving behind a small marble, which Gi-Gyu picked it up wordlessly.[You have obtained a fragment of an Ego.][Would you like to move to the reward chamber?]The gate was finally cleared.***\u201cGood job. Twenty-four hours. Had you been any later than that, I would\u2019ve charged in,\u201d Tae-Shik said. Gi-Gyu, who had just walked out of the gate, said playfully, \u201cI\u2019m pretty strong, you know. Except for the boss monster, I killed all the monsters with just a swing or two.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s tone was teasing, but Tae-Shik\u2019s expression became grave as he asked, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d Tae-Shik had known Gi-Gyu for a long time, so he could tell Gi-Gyu was worried about something.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cCan we talk after I take care of the follow-up procedure?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cGeneral Manager! The association president is looking for you!\u201d a man yelled as he ran toward Tae-Shik. But, Tae-Shik replied firmly, \u201cTell that old man I\u2019ll see him later.\u201d\u201cB-but General Manager!\u201d the man stammered in shock at Tae-Shik's disrespectful tone.Ignoring the messenger, Tae-Shik reassured Gi-Gyu, \u201cLet\u2019s take care of this place first. I\u2019ll get the crystals, the gate clear rewards, and all the other stuff sorted out for you immediately.\u201dSadly, the gate Gi-Gyu cleared appeared to be a one-shot type rather than a sustained one. But the reward he earned was still pretty significant. Whenever a gate was cleared, the association sorted out the crystals and the rewards quickly. Since Gi-Gyu cleared the gate, he was entitled to the prize money the association offered. Because the payment office was run by the association, Gi-Gyu could also sell his crystals on the spot.Gi-Gyu quickly opened his bag and took out numerous purple and navy crystals. \u201cPlease wait a moment!\u201d an association employee said to Gi-Gyu. Then, he quickly returned with a reward check for 10 million won and the settlement for the crystals. Gi-Gyu counted it and found that combined, he received about 50 million won.When he obtained the Dagger of Paralysis, he ended up with over 100 million won. But something like that was a rare occurrence. Even this time, the only reason Gi-Gyu earned over 50 million won was that he successfully solo cleared a gate.The association employee congratulated Gi-Gyu, \u201cCongratulations on completing your first solo hunt. I\u2019ve noticed you don\u2019t have the player credential yet. Is there a reason for that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that, so don\u2019t worry about it. You did well, so you\u2019re free to leave now,\u201d Tae-Shik interrupted the employee. The association employee found it odd that Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t have the player credential; when Tae-Shik took over, he had no choice but to leave without an answer.Since the gate was now closed, the association members moved around busily to take care of the aftermath. Tae-Shik offered Gi-Gyu, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my car.\u201d It seemed Tae-Shik brought his car here while Gi-Gyu was hunting inside the gate.Gi-Gyu protested weakly, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get inside your car\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy not? My beautiful panda is every man\u2019s dream!\u201d Tae-Shik laughed out loud, and Gi-Gyu followed meekly.***\u201cWill you be going to the hospital now?\u201d Tae-Shik asked.\u201cYes. I need to go see Mother and Yoo-Jung,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. The two men were sitting inside a tiny pink Tico.[1]\u00a0Tae-Shik, who was over 190 cm tall, was squatting while holding the handle, and Gi-Gyu, who was over 180 cm tall, sat in the passenger seat in a similarly uncomfortable position.Tae-Shik had a strange fetish for pink things. He asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cLet\u2019s talk while I drive you to the hospital. So firstly, why did it take so long to clear the gate?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to. I just thought that with your skills, you should've been able to clear it in two days tops. So I\u2019m just curious why it took you so long.\u201d\u2018I knew it!\u2019Gi-Gyu now knew for certain that Tae-Shik understood he wasn\u2019t the weak Level 1 player anymore. It was obvious that Tae-Shik expected him to clear the gate easily, yet he still worried for no reason.Anyway, Tae-Shik guessed the timing very accurately; maybe it was because he was a ranker. After hesitating for a while, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI got stuck in a situation where I couldn\u2019t move to the reward chamber.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cSo I walked around to find a way to get to the reward chamber. I ended up killing every monster inside the gate, and\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu explained as the car stopped at the red light. He continued, \u201cAnd that was when I found an Ego\u2019s fragment. I could finally enter the reward chamber after picking it up.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Tae-Shik asked, but it seemed he had already guessed what Gi-Gyu would say next.\u201cI think the gate was an Ego,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered. It had been five years since he became a player. Although only a few months have passed since he could finally call himself a proper player, Gi-Gyu\u2019s intuition suggested that the gate was giving him small clues to its secret.1. Tico is a compact car produced by an automaker GM Daewoo between 1991 and 2001.\u00a0\u261cFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20. Mother (1)\u201cMother, I\u2019m back,\u201d Gi-Gyu greeted his mother.\u201cThere you are, Gi-Gyu! It has been so long since I last saw you, my son,\u201d his mother replied happily.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been coming around more often,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You must be very busy with your work, so I\u2019m just thankful you visited me,\u201d his mother reassured him. She couldn\u2019t turn her neck because of her condition, so she was looking up at the ceiling as she talked to him.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asleep yet?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. It was late at night, so he expected her to be asleep, but she was still wide awake. His mother replied, \u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026 sleep. But Yoo-Jung is sleeping, so don\u2019t wake her up.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dGi-Gyu could already see Yoo-Jung sleeping on a sofa nearby, so his mother\u2019s message was more of a reminder to him. Yoo-Jung\u2019s blanket had slipped to the ground in her sleep, so Gi-Gyu picked it up and covered Yoo-Jung. Then, he began massaging his mother\u2019s legs and asked, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks to my son,\u201d his mother replied quickly.\u201cYou always say you\u2019re fine. I\u2019m going to talk to your doctor tomorrow morning and hear the truth from his mouth. So, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m living such a luxurious life, all thanks to my son, right? But Gi-Gyu, I\u2019m okay with staying in a group room instead of this fancy private one. After all, it must be costly,\u201d his mother said hesitantly.\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. It seemed his mother was a little too worried about the private room\u2019s price. So, he reassured her, \u201cI made a lot of money recently, so please don\u2019t worry, Mother. All you need to do is focus on getting better.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t help worrying about burdening you, Gi-Gyu,\u201d his mother replied. Gi-Gyu\u2019s reply was to continue massaging her arms silently.Knock, knock.Just then, someone knocked on the door. Gi-Gyu smiled widely and said out loud, \u201cCome in, Hyung.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry about visiting you so late at night. I came here with Gi-Gyu, so I thought it would be rude not to come up and see you,\u201d Tae-Shik said to Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother apologetically.\u201cWelcome,\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother greeted Tae-Shik, who was blushing and coughing awkwardly. This woke Yoo-Jung up, who greeted Tae-Shik, \u201cUncle! Welcome!\u201d\u201cYoo-Jung! Did I wake you? I\u2019m sorry. You should go back to sleep,\u201d Tae-Shik apologized.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I have exams tomorrow, so I need to study anyway,\u201d Yoo-Jung replied with a smile. Tae-Shik coughed inelegantly again and placed the fruit basket on the table. He explained, \u201cI bought some fruits for you. Please enjoy them with Yoo-Jung.\u201d\u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t have. We\u2019re already very grateful for all you\u2019ve done for us. You don\u2019t have to bring anything when you visit me,\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother replied quietly.Happy to see Tae-Shik and his mother chatting pleasantly, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI\u2019ll be back, so you two have a nice chat.\u201d Gi-Gyu wanted to have a private chat with his sister, so he took Yoo-Jung to the break room.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow\u2019re your studies going? Are you ready for the exams?\u201dGi-Gyu was a very attentive and involved brother. He kept himself well-informed of Yoo-Jung\u2019s school schedule. Yoo-Jung tried her best not to burden her brother with these things, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help being concerned for his sister.\u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d Yoo-Jung replied weakly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel pressured about getting good grades. All I want is for you to live your life the way you want to. Always keep what I said back then in your mind, okay?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Okay,\u201d Yoo-Jung nodded as she rubbed her eyes sleepily.Just then, an elderly woman appeared out of nowhere and asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cAre you Yoo-Jung\u2019s older brother?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion.\u201cGranny! You still haven\u2019t gone to bed?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked in surprise, seemingly familiar with the stranger. The elderly woman explained, \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I was taking a walk when I heard your voice, Yoo-Jung.\u201dThen, the older woman suddenly held Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands tightly, but he didn\u2019t pull away; instead, Gi-Gyu gently held her hands in return. Her eyes filled with warmth, the elderly woman said, \u201cI have been wondering how Yoo-Jung was raised to be such an upstanding young woman. Now, I can see that it\u2019s all thanks to you, young man. You have a good energy about you.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Gi-Gyu thanked her as he glanced at Yoo-Jung. When he gave his sister a curious look, Yoo-Jung scratched her head and explained, \u201cI found her collapsed in the hospital park, so\u2026 I just called the nurses for help.\u201d\u201cMy goodness, that\u2019s not true. You did much more than that! Thanks to Yoo-Jung\u2019s quick thinking, this old woman\u2019s life was extended just a bit longer,\u201d the elderly woman explained gratefully.\u201cGood job, Yoo-Jung. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Gi-Gyu told his sister with a fraternal smile.\u201cYes, you should be proud of her, young man. Yoo-Jung bragged about her older brother so much that I feel like I already know you,\u201d the older woman said to Gi-Gyu familiarly. Gi-Gyu was indeed proud of his sister for growing up to be such a kind young woman. Seeing a stranger thanking her made Gi-Gyu believe that all the hardships he went through in the past were worth it.The elderly woman turned toward Gi-Gyu and murmured, \u201cYoung man\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Granny,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied respectfully.\u201cI can see many energies clashing around you. Please don\u2019t lose yourself and be careful. I hope you overcome all the hardships you\u2019re about to face in the future,\u201d the woman continued.\u201cPardon? Granny?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion, unable to understand what the elderly woman was talking about. Before he could even ask for an explanation, the elderly woman had somehow left him far behind. It would have been rude to demand an answer from the elderly lady at this hour, so Gi-Gyu decided to ask later if he got a chance.Gi-Gyu and Yoo-Jung chatted for a few more minutes before returning to see their mother. Afterward, he returned to the break room to sleep.***\u201cHyung, you\u2019re still here?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked Tae-Shik when he woke up from a loud noise. He noticed Tae-Shik sitting in front of him, nodding off. Tae-Shik also woke up and replied, \u201cHow could I leave after what you told me about the gate? We\u2019ll first talk with your mother\u2019s doctor about her condition this morning. Then, you\u2019ll come to the association with me, and we\u2019ll talk about the gate there.\u201dGi-Gyu flinched and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re going to report this to the association?\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you think I\u2019m an idiot? I would never do something like that. We just need a quiet place to talk, that\u2019s all,\u201d Tae-Shik replied in annoyance.\u201cAlright,\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded in understanding. Because Tae-Shik\u2019s office had a strong barrier, he must\u2019ve thought it would be safer to talk there. Some items could neutralize such barrier items, but the barrier in Tae-Shik\u2019s office was created by a player of the support category. This meant the barrier around Tae-Shik\u2019s office was stronger than most, and therefore, safer.Gi-Gyu was heading toward his mother\u2019s hospital room when someone called him from behind, \u201cYou\u2019re patient Lee Su-Jin\u2019s guardian, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered. When he turned around, he saw a doctor in a white coat standing behind him. The doctor asked, \u201cCan we talk for a moment in private?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied immediately.\u201cMay I join you?\u201d When Tae-Shik asked the doctor, the doctor asked Gi-Gyu for his permission. Gi-Gyu nodded without hesitation.Instead of going to Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother\u2019s room or his own office, the doctor led them to a park bench outside the hospital building. Gi-Gyu found this odd, but he followed without a word. Tae-Shik, on the other hand, looked very worried for some reason. The doctor, Gi-Gyu, and Tae-Shik sat down on the bench together.The doctor asked Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik, \u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head, and Tae-Shik asked, \u201cIs this bad news?\u201dWhen the doctor flinched visibly, Tae-Shik explained, \u201cI\u2019ve been to plenty of hospitals before. My parents also passed away inside a hospital, so I know the drill.\u201d\u201cOh, I see,\u201d the doctor replied knowingly. Hearing Tae-Shik\u2019s worried tone, Gi-Gyu became tense as well. He asked the doctor, \u201cIs there\u2026 Is there a problem with my mother?\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 Yes,\u201d the doctor replied hesitantly. He was planning on beginning with a mundane conversation before slowly bringing up the main topic; because of Tae-Shik, it seemed he had to get right to the point. Realizing what the doctor was trying to do, Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cI would prefer it if you just tell me. Tae-Shik hyung probably knew this, and that was why he said what he said just now.\u201dGi-Gyu explained to the doctor what Tae-Shik was trying to do. Realizing he had no choice, the doctor nodded and replied, \u201cAlright.\u201d The doctor now seemed more relaxed and less burdened as he continued, \u201cYour mother is in grave condition. She refuses to show it, but the complete body paralysis has severely damaged her muscles. Her body is also having a hard time absorbing any nutrients. All the paralysis-related complications have progressed markedly. I can see you have been trying your best to take care of her; unfortunately, it\u2019s too late. Our hospital is doing its best, but at this rate\u2026\u201d\u201cHow long? How long will she be able to live?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked bluntly.\u201cAnywhere between three months and a year,\u201d the doctor muttered. Suddenly, something ridiculously heavy began pressing down on Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest. The doctor continued, \u201cThere is more. We came across another problem while we were inspecting her spinal damage. To be frank, we still haven\u2019t been able to figure out the source of this problem. And I even believe that the main issue is something else entirely; the paralysis and this new problem are just side effects.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?! Please, just tell me clearly!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled, but the other patients and passersby in the park didn\u2019t pay attention to him. After all, a scene like this was very common in the hospital setting.The doctor looked at Gi-Gyu awkwardly while Tae-Shik held Gi-Gyu\u2019s shoulder to stop him. Everyone here, including Gi-Gyu, knew the doctor was doing his best, but sometimes that just wasn\u2019t enough. The doctor replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed in despair as tears rolled down his eyes. Gi-Gyu was in no shape to be asking rational questions, so Tae-Shik took the helm and asked, \u201cAlright. Now, is there anything you can do at all?\u201d\u201cIn a situation like this, there is only one solution.\u201d When the doctor replied, Tae-Shik murmured in understanding, \u201cElixir\u2026\u201dThe doctor agreed, \u201cYes. Only an elixir can save patient Lee Su-Jin.\u201d***-Don\u2019t overdo it.-Master\u2026Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply to Lou and El\u2019s worried murmurs. Instead, he continued to swing them viciously. \u00a0A large minotaur failed to dodge Lou and El and fell in three pieces. Its corpse disappeared in a few seconds, leaving a single crystal in its place.-You need to snap out of it!Lou screamed, but Gi-Gyu ignored him again and walked off to find another minotaur to hunt. Nearby, he spotted another monster wandering with an ax in its hand. Normally, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve approached with caution since his preferred hunting method was a surprise attack. But, things were different now. Like an untamed stallion, he dashed toward the monster and swung Lou down its head.Dun!The minotaur spotted Gi-Gyu and blocked Lou with its ax. Gi-Gyu swung El with his other hand, but the monster took a quick step back and roared, \u201cMoarrrrrr!!!!!!\u201dDa, da, da, da, da\u2026Suddenly, the ground began shaking as thundering sounds echoed throughout the wooded forest.-At this rate, we\u2019re all going to die! Can\u2019t you see a minotaur herd is coming at us?When fighting a minotaur, it was necessary to cut its neck or use silence magic to stop it from crying out loud. Its cry had the effect of attracting all nearby minotaurs toward it. It was very similar to how wolves howled to gather their kind.Normally, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve followed this strategy to a tee; now, he was hunting as if the great unknown had possessed him.Dun! Dun! Dun!By now, the ground quakes were stronger than ever. The minotaur Gi-Gyu had been fighting just now was already dead, leaving another crystal behind. But by the time Gi-Gyu looked up, he was surrounded by dozens of angry minotaurs.\u201cMoar!\u201d\u201cMoarrr!\u201d\u201cMoarrrrrr!\u201dThe minotaurs began to roar again. However, their cries didn\u2019t seem to worry Gi-Gyu, who murmured, \u201cSo noisy\u2026\u201dHe kicked the ground once more and swung Lou and El. The two swords, although plunged at an incredible speed, were blocked by the two minotaurs\u2019 axes.\u201cMoarrrr!\u201dSlam!Gi-Gyu was temporarily held in the air when another minotaur stormed toward him. The monster headbutted Gi-Gyu, making him grunt, \u201cUgh!\u201dOne of the minotaur\u2019s horns struck Brunheart, saving Gi-Gyu from a mangled torso; the other horn left a giant gash on his unprotected right arm. The blood from the injury poured onto his thin white shirt, slowly turning it red. Gi-Gyu dropped to his knees and vomited a large amount of blood. He quickly opened his bag and drank a potion.\u201cMoarr!\u201dSeveral minotaurs tried to strike their axes toward Gi-Gyu, but they made the mistake of attacking simultaneously. Consequently, all the axes tangled together before they could even strike Gi-Gyu. As for the select few that didn\u2019t get tangled, they struck the spot where Gi-Gyu was kneeling before he escaped.-Crazy bastard! You\u2019re going to die!Lou screamed again, but Gi-Gyu untied his bag and took out a smoke shell without acknowledging his Ego. He threw it toward the minotaur; then, a frenzied slaughter took place. From within the black smoke, only the minotaurs\u2019 shrieks and the clanking noises of metals colliding with each other rang out.Also, one could see Lou and El flashing ominously from time to time.***\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu panted loudly. It had already been two weeks since he visited his mother at the hospital. Since then, Gi-Gyu hasn't returned to his mother; instead, he had spent every waking and sleeping moment in the Tower. He was now standing on the 19th floor. The next floor was where he had to take the third test.Gi-Gyu had killed countless monsters on his way to this floor. Accordingly, his Egos\u2019 abilities have increased significantly. They didn\u2019t gain any new skills or any additional changes to their status screens, but the overall level increase in their abilities was astounding.Gi-Gyu was becoming stronger at an incredible speed, but the pain he felt inside was even greater. It felt like he had a voracious hole in his chest, and it all began the day he had that devastating conversation with his mother\u2019s doctor. After panting like a dog for a while, Gi-Gyu finally calmed down his breathing and sat down on the ground quietly.-Have you finally calmed down? You crazy jerk.-Master, are you okay now?\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you two worry,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and laid down on the ground. He whispered, \u201cWhat do I do now?\u201dAn elixir wasn\u2019t something even money could buy. It certainly wasn\u2019t something Gi-Gyu could afford with what he had, even if it was for sale. Even the strongest player couldn\u2019t purchase an elixir. People liked to say that an elixir was given only to those who were chosen by god.Gi-Gyu was lying on the ground somewhere on the 19th floor, surrounded by over fifty navy crystals.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21. Mother (2)After a few more days of hunting, Lou failed to absorb any more of the minotaurs\u2019 ability. Thankfully, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind had also cleared by then, so he finally left the Tower.\u201cWas it around here?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. He became reckless and indifferent after hearing his mother\u2019s diagnosis, but he never forgot to pick up the crystals during his hunt. After his frenzied hunt, not only did he obtain a truckload of crystals, but he also got two items. Since he couldn\u2019t carry around so many crystals in his bag, he hid them in some secret corner of the 19th floor.\u201cFound it,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured when he spotted an area that was covered with different colored sands in a strange pattern. Gi-Gyu purposely threw the sand there from a different floor to mark where he hid his bags. Without a word, he squatted down and began to dig the area with his hands.-Gosh, you\u2019re acting so pathetic. Are you going through your hormonal teenage years all over again?-Master\u2019s mother is gravely ill. I completely understand how you must feel, Master.-But does that give him the right to go mad and behave recklessly? How could he go hunting without taking any precautions? You need to act even smarter in difficult situations like this. So what if her situation seems? Don\u2019t lose yourself\u2014focus! Focus and find a way to way out! If you don\u2019t, you know you\u2019ll regret it after your mother passes away.Even as Gi-Gyu dug the ground, Lou\u2019s words stabbed his heart like a knife. Tears began streaming down his face, but he didn\u2019t stop digging. After a little while, he finally struck gold and found the ten sacks full of crystals.Gi-Gyu tied them all together, one by one, into a straight line. His power stat had increased dramatically, but the bags\u2019 collective weight still burdened him down. He murmured, \u201cI better go see Mother now.\u201d-Alright.-I am always at your command, Master.Gi-Gyu headed toward the portal while barely managing to drag the tied-up bags. There were quite a few people near the 19th-floor portal, so Gi-Gyu elicited a volley of murmurs from them.\u201cLook at that man,\u201d one player whispered.\u201cWhat the?! Are those all filled with crystals?\u201d another player asked in shock.\u201cWow\u2026 Who is he? Does he live in the Tower or something?\u201d the first player wondered with curiosity.All of Gi-Gyu\u2019s bags stacked together could dwarf a human five times the normal human size. So, it was no wonder the people stared at him in shock.\u201cHehe, they look really heavy. Can we help you?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu turned around, he caught several sly-looking players examining him with narrowed eyes. Some of them were even blatantly eyeing the bags he was carrying with interest.\u2018Red Players, huh\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu knew instinctively who they were. They belonged to a group of criminal players that treated the Tower as their home base. They were notorious for taking advantage of innocent players, stealing, and even committing murders. The bright red badges on their chest confirmed Gi-Gyu\u2019s suspicion.\u201cThey\u2019re from the Smurf Guild!\u201d one passerby player exclaimed.\u201cHey, let\u2019s go somewhere else,\u201d his companion murmured.\u201cOh my gosh, that poor man. He\u2019s going to lose all those crystals. It must\u2019ve taken him years to collect that many,\u201d another player muttered with sympathy.\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped. There is no way out if you get caught by the Smurfs.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t they usually stay on the 30th floor?\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to answer that how?\u201dThe players who were watching the scene with interest before were now running away. They seemed sorry for Gi-Gyu, but that wasn\u2019t enough for them to get involved.\u201cWe\u2019ll help you carry your bags!\u201d The man who spoke to Gi-Gyu first tried to touch one of the bags. The man had a memorable scar near one of his eyes.Schwing!Milliseconds later, the man found Lou, in sword form, aimed at his neck. He stammered in confusion, \u201cW-what the?!\u201dGi-Gyu said to the man quietly, \u201cGet lost. You shouldn\u2019t covet what doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201dThe man hesitantly took a few steps back. His companions unsheathed their swords and glared at Gi-Gyu, but none of them was stupid enough to make the first move. They murmured in fear, \u201cH-his eyes\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s eyes were glowing crimson, and he was enveloped in a bloodthirsty aura. The aura was so intimidating that the Smurf Guild members couldn\u2019t help but take a step back.Then, an abrupt shout from afar broke the standstill. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s from the association! Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d a Smurf Guild member shouted.\u201cLet\u2019s go! I\u2019m gonna remember your face, so you better watch yourself in the Tower from now on, unless you wanna die by my hand!\u201d The sly-looking player with the scar yelped before running away with the others.The area around the 19th-floor portal was under the association\u2019s supervision, so it was always crawling with association members. The association volunteered to patrol this area, so they only sent high-level agents. Even the Red Players seemed afraid of the association. By the time the association employee arrived at the scene, the criminal had left. They questioned Gi-Gyu, \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d\u201cThose Red Players seemed interested in stealing my bags,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained the situation calmly. His eyes had returned to normal, and his tone was civil.\u201cI-I can see why they would be interested,\u201d the association employee stammered, making Gi-Gyu smile bitterly. Indeed, the crystals he was carrying were worth a small fortune; it was no wonder those Red Players felt greedy.The man from the association asked, \u201cBy the way, are you Player Kim Gi-Gyu by any chance?\u201d\u2018Huh? He knows my name?\u2019When Gi-Gyu looked at the agent in confusion, the association employee waved his hands and explained, \u201cOh, please don\u2019t misunderstand me! I only know because General Manager Oh Tae-Shik has been desperately looking for you. He put up a photo of you on all the portals; I recognized you from the picture.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u2018That man! What had he been doing while I was busy hunting?\u2019It sounded like Oh Tae-Shik had turned Gi-Gyu into a wanted man.The agent stated, \u201cYou just need to follow me, Sir.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dGi-Gyu felt certain of this man\u2019s credentials, so he followed the agent silently. As for the crystals, he decided that he could deal with them later.***As they walked, Gi-Gyu asked the agent why Tae-Shik was looking for him, but the employee seemed to be at a loss too. The moment they reached the 1st-floor landmark, Gi-Gyu was surrounded by numerous association employees, greeting him eagerly.\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d one employee yelled.\u201cPlease come over this way!\u201d another screamed even louder.\u201cNo, come this way!\u201d the third agent shouted.The first agent who found Gi-Gyu on the 19th floor explained with embarrassment, \u201cThe general manager promised to give a bonus this month to whoever brings you in, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cWhat is wrong with that man?!\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. It seemed Tae-Shik was hell-bent on making a wanted man out of Gi-Gyu. He\u00a0pushed away all the agents swarming around him and continued on with the man who found him first. When they reached Tae-Shik\u2019s office, the agent said, \u201cYou can go inside now. My name is Heo Sung-Hoon. Please make sure to tell the general manager.\u201d\u201cHaha, alright,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered with a laugh.Knock, knock!The door opened immediately after Gi-Gyu knocked.\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Tae-Shik shouted and swung a fist toward Gi-Gyu\u2019s head. But, Gi-Gyu was even faster and dodged the strike with a swift turn. When Tae-Shik\u2019s hand ended up punching nothing, he muttered, \u201cOh, how dare you?!\u201dUnfortunately, when Tae-Shik made a second attempt, his punch found its target; Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t avoid being smacked in the head this time. Gi-Gyu glared at Tae-Shik by reflex, and Tae-Shik looked right back at him with a sparkle in his eyes.\u201cThis time, you squatted in the Tower for way too long. I can feel the bloodlust oozing from your body. Just get inside already. We don\u2019t have much time,\u201d Tae-Shik explained hurriedly.\u201cI should be the one getting angry, Hyung,\u201d Gi-Gyu protested. But, he still followed Tae-Shik inside and sat down on the sofa.Gi-Gyu complained, \u201cWhat was so important that you made me into a wanted man? By the way, it was a man named Heo Sung-Hoon who brought me here.\u201d\u201cSung-Hoon? Got it. I better double his bonus this month,\u201d Tae-Shik replied and nodded, making Gi-Gyu sigh, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu was still annoyed; after seeing Tae-Shik\u2019s usual goofy behavior, he smiled. When Gi-Gyu put down his bags on the floor, Tae-Shik asked, \u201cAre all those bags filled with crystals?\u201d\u201cThere are two items inside as well. They\u2019re equipment items, but they are of no use to me. I think I\u2019ll just sell them,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cWait here,\u201d Tae-Shik told Gi-Gyu, made a single call, and three men arrived before long. As the trio carried all the bags out, Tae-Shik promised Gi-Gyu, \u201cThey will calculate it accurately and deposit the profit into your bank account. The equipment items will be sent to the auction house, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYou have the authority for all that, Hyung?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the association\u2019s general manager, after all. This is normal for anyone at this level,\u201d Tae-Shik replied nonchalantly, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide how impressed he was. Now that Tae-Shik had taken care of the bags, Gi-Gyu felt much lighter. It was finally time to discuss why Tae-Shik brought him here so hurriedly.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cIt\u2019s about your mother,\u201d Tae-Shik replied; Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes became serious. Tae-Shik continued, \u201cYou know when the elixir first appeared, right?\u201d\u201cThe elixir?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The elixir.\u201d\u201cAt the beginning, when the Tower first appeared, the very first player who cleared the 50th floor was Marco Alonso. He received the elixir as a reward; the elixir had only appeared twice since,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered in detail.\u201cSo you know about it very well.\u201d Tae-Shik seemed impressed. There was a reason why Gi-Gyu knew so much about the elixir. It was because he knew early on that this item was the only thing that could cure his mother. He researched the elixir extensively before; in the end, he could only come up with one conclusion: It was near impossible for him to get one.Tae-Shik said to him, \u201cBy the way, there was one similarity between those two gates.\u201d\u201cThat they were both maze type?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWell before these exceptional gates began appearing in abundance, there had been several cases in the past where gates with similar structures appeared. One of these was a maze type, known to be the hardest gate to clear.Maze gates were in a category and grade of their own; consequently, if a player were to chance upon a newly formed maze type, they weren\u2019t given a priority pass. Instead, any capable player could enter it out of their own violation.Suffice to say, maze gates were the most dangerous type of gates. There had been countless cases where a single maze type gate housed numerous taxons of monsters. And that was when one didn't speak of the deadly traps and the boss keepers that were way stronger than the gate that lodged them.There was a silver lining, though: Maze-type gates\u2019 gate break occurred later than that of all the other types. A maze gate wouldn\u2019t break even after three months of not being cleared. But, they were such difficult gates to clear that three months were not always enough.Maze gates appeared twice in the past; each time, the rewards for clearing them had been elixirs.Gi-Gyu stammered, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this now because\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo days ago, a third maze gate appeared in the US. As soon as I heard the news, I sent out your pictures. Do you get it now?\u201d Tae-Shik answered with a bitter smile. He added, \u201cI would love to go inside myself; as you know, anyone at or above the general manager level isn\u2019t allowed to enter a gate except for an emergency situation.\u201d\u2018Is hyung for real? Didn\u2019t he say he would charge in if I failed to clear the F-Call Gate in five days? This is a maze type\u2026\u2019\u00a0Suddenly, Gi-Gyu realized the reason Tae-Shik said that. It wasn\u2019t Tae-Shik was doubted Gi-Gyu could clear it, but because he was worried the gate might transform into an exceptional type.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cGi-Gyu, I believe you have a special power. I also think you\u2019re the only player who has gotten this close to the gates\u2019 secret. But you, clearing a maze gate? I know it\u2019s impossible. Besides, three high rankers have already announced their intention to enter this gate.\u201dMunch, munch\u2026Gi-Gyu bit his lips as Tae-Shik spoke, \u201cGi-Gyu, I just wanted to tell you that you should live a life you won\u2019t regret. Since you now have a chance to get an elixir, I wanted to tell you that you should go, even if it means you might die inside.\u201dTae-Shik looked down and continued, \u201cYou now have an opportunity, so if you don\u2019t even try, then\u2026 I know you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life. You will never be content that way.\u201d\u201cHyung\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you must go. I\u2019ve already taken care of all the preparations. Now, all you\u2019ve to do is say goodbye to Yoo-Jung and your mother before you leave. Do your best, so you don\u2019t regret it for the rest of your life. You must avoid the high rankers and the guilds at all costs. You must survive on your own. I\u2019ve never been inside a maze gate either, so I can\u2019t give you any advice.\u201d\u201cThank you. I really mean it.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly. Tae-Shik gave him a similar smile as well. Tae-Shik offered, \u201cGo ahead, freshen up, and meet your mother. Once you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll have someone help you to the gate.\u201dUnable to control his emotions, Gi-Gyu lowered his face and left the room. Now alone in his office, Tae-Shik glanced at the empty ashtray and murmured in a lonely voice, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m so desperate for a smoke again. I think I\u2019ve done all I can, Mr. Kim.\u201dFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22. The Maze of Heryond (1)Thanks to Tae-Shik, Gi-Gyu was able to get a quick shower before going to the hospital. It had been a while since Gi-Gyu last visited his mother, but his mother didn\u2019t act disappointed or blame him. Instead, she just felt guilty, believing her son was overworking because of her.As it turned out, Yoo-Jung was the one doing all the scolding. \u201cDo you have any idea how much Mother has suffered recently? Just her headaches had been so terrible that she couldn\u2019t sleep!\u201dGi-Gyu had asked the doctor to keep Yoo-Jung and their mother in darkness about the diagnosis. So, Yoo-Jung had no idea why he was acting so irrationally or why he stayed inside the Tower for so long.When Gi-Gyu held Yoo-Jung\u2019s hands gently, she stammered, \u201cH-have you lost your mind, Oppa? What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cPlease take care of Mother even if I\u2019m not around.\u201d Gi-Gyu made a quiet request.\u201cW-wh-what? What are you talking about?!\u201d Yoo-Jung asked in confusion.\u201cJust\u2026 I think I won\u2019t be able to visit her for a while. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all? Are you sure there isn\u2019t anything more? Oppa, I\u2019m going to graduate and start working soon, so\u2026 Just hold on for a bit longer. Please, don\u2019t do anything dangerous. I\u2019ll make lots of money; then, you can retire. We\u2019ll open a small cafe and live off of it,\u201d Yoo-Jung promised.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Yoo-Jung,\u201d Gi-Gyu reassured his sister and stood up.Outside, someone from the association sent by Tae-Shik was waiting for Gi-Gyu. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, it was Heo Sung-Hoon.\u201cGeneral Manager Oh Tae-Shik ordered me to take care of you if I want that bonus,\u201d Sung-Hoon explained, making Gi-Gyu laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s okay for you to leave the portal? Who will protect it?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cThere are plenty of other agents protecting the portal,\u201d Sung-Hoon answered easily. With that, Gi-Gyu packed lightly and accompanied Heo Sung-Hoon. Gi-Gyu was told that Tae-Shik had already taken care of all the necessary preparation to enter the new maze gate in the US. All Gi-Gyu had to do was travel to the US. So, before boarding the plane, Gi-Gyu met Tae-Shik one last time.Tae-Shik said calmly, \u201cWhy are you looking so down? No one\u2019s expecting you to clear that gate. Don\u2019t overdo it. Just do the best you can, that\u2019s all. I wish I could go with you and watch you enter the gate personally. But, I haven\u2019t worked much in the last few days, so the association president is refusing to let me go.\u201d\u201cIf I die, please take care of Mother and Yoo-Jung. You should also find a nice woman and get married before it\u2019s too late, Hyung,\u201d Gi-Gyu advised Tae-Shik, who muttered, \u201cNonsense!\u201d\u201cAnd there is an elderly gentleman in Dongdaemun Market who goes by the name of Old Man Hwang. Please give this to him,\u201d Gi-Gyu requested as he handed a bankbook to Tae-Shik; the PIN was on the bankbook\u2019s first page. Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cThat\u2019s everything I have left after paying a bit of the family debt, Mother\u2019s hospital bills, and leaving some money for Yoo-Jung and Mother\u2019s living expenses. Please tell him I can\u2019t pay him back in full. Also, tell him I\u2019m proud. Proud that I can use such an amazing item made by the greatest craftsman I know. Ask him to be understanding.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about that item blacksmith?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cGot it. And don\u2019t worry about your family. I will protect them no matter what,\u201d Tae-Shik promised.\u201cThank you.\u201dGi-Gyu had finally done everything he could before entering the Tower with Sung-Hoon.***\u201cYou\u2019re already done?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked in shock when he saw Gi-Gyu.\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon murmured and laughed in astonishment.Before leaving for the US, Gi-Gyu asked Sung-Hoon to drop by the Tower. There was something he had to take care of before leaving the country\u2014the 20th-floor test.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t receive any reward for clearing the 10th-floor test, but he liked to believe the 20th-floor test would be different. If he could gain something, anything, from this floor, it could help him in surviving the gate.Gi-Gyu explained to Sung-Hoon, \u201cI was strong enough to take this test a long time ago, but I chose not to take it until now.\u201dGi-Gyu had been hunting monsters to help Lou level up, which was also why he hadn\u2019t talent the test yet. Normally, it would take an entire day to pass the 20th-floor test for the average player, so when Gi-Gyu returned after just 20 minutes, it was no wonder Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t hide his shock.\u2018I\u2019ve done everything I can possibly do to get prepared,\u2019The new maze gate in the US was the worst kind of gate. This meant that Gi-Gyu had to get as strong as possible before entering it. He even considered pushing himself and taking the 30th-floor test too, but he knew clearing the in-between floors would take too long. The best thing he could\u2019ve done was clear the 20th-floor test, and that was exactly what he did. Thankfully, there was something he gained from this test, unlike when he passed the 10th-floor test. So, Gi-Gyu opened his status screen to review the changes.[Level 1][Job: Ego\u2019s partner][Unique ability: Sync][Skill: Assimilation (Grade E: You can now use 35% of your Egos\u2019 abilities.)][Retained Ego: Chang-Gyung]Now, his assimilation skill had a grade, which was uncommon, to say the least. The 20th-floor test had seemingly upgraded his assimilation skill. Before this, Gi-Gyu could use his Egos\u2019 stats and abilities to an extent, but he had no idea what percentage of their strength he was utilizing. Well, that wasn\u2019t completely true. He could feel that he was using a bit of their strength; now, he was using 35% of their strength, way more than what he did previously.\u2018I\u2019m only using 35% of their abilities, but my body is already filled with so much energy.\u2019The power he had before clearing the test was nowhere even close to what was coursing through his body now. Since Lou, El, and Brunheart had all leveled up, their stats were higher than ever. And consequently, Gi-Gyu felt amazing, energized, and in the best shape he had ever been in his life.\u2018I understand El keeping quiet, but I\u2019m surprised Lou isn\u2019t saying much either.\u2019If Gi-Gyu died, all the Egos synced with him would also perish. Even if he did his very best, the possibility of him dying inside the gate was still over 90%. And the same applied to his Egos too.Based on how Lou had been acting since the beginning, Gi-Gyu expected him to throw all the tantrums in the world just to cancel this trip. Yet strangely, Lou had been quiet all this time.-Do you think I\u2019m that heartless? It\u2019s your mother we\u2019re talking about.\u2018Umm\u2026\u2019Did Lou have a mother too? Was Lou born an Ego from the beginning?Or\u2026-I will always be at your command, Master.El assured Gi-Gyu, who replied, \u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked when he heard Gi-Gyu speak out loud.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was just reminding myself to be strong.\u201d Gi-Gyu gave a quick excuse. Heo Sung-Hoon smiled bitterly and replied, \u201cI understand. After all, where you\u2019re going is considered hell on earth.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go now,\u201d Gi-Gyu said and nodded.\u201cAlright. Please follow me.\u201d Heo Sung-Hoon led the way.The dangerous journey to cure his mother was about to begin.***The Tower, the one place every Player frequented, connected the entire world. Because there was a separate zone for each country, it was rare for the Players of different nations to cross paths. But, there was no question the Tower was connected to every country in the world.There existed a separate portal that allowed Players to travel across different zones. This portal was, of course, controlled by the association. Players the association considered important didn\u2019t have to take planes or boats to travel to another country. Using the association\u2019s portal, a Player could go anywhere in the world with ease. Factors like these culminated together to make the association the strongest organization in the world.\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Heo Sung-Hoon announced. They were standing at a secret spot inside the fifth-floor landmark. The zone portal was deep inside the general association branch\u2019s basement, which was one of the biggest buildings in the fifth-floor landmark. Gi-Gyu had heard of this place, but he had never seen it in person. After all, the zone portal\u2019s location was one of the association\u2019s most closely guarded secrets.Guessing what Gi-Gyu was thinking, Heo Sung-Hoon straightened his chest proudly and explained, \u201cYou seem very close to General Manager Oh Tae-Shik, yet it looks like you don\u2019t know him very well.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion.\u201cGeneral Manager Oh Tae-Shik holds great sway inside the associations. There\u2019s even a rumor that he has already been designated as the next president of the association. An average general manager doesn\u2019t hold this much authority. And more importantly, General Manager is basically taking responsibility for all of your actions by giving you access to this portal. If you told someone about the location of the zone portal, he would have to shoulder a greater part of the responsibility and the blame,\u201d Heo Sung-Hoon explained seriously.\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. Hearing about this side of Tae-Shik from a total stranger felt unreal to Gi-Gyu. Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cMany Players in the world hold General Manager Oh Tae-Shik in high esteem, especially those from the association. So, please, never not doubt his authority.\u201d\u201cOh, of course. I\u2019m sorry if you felt I was being disrespectful,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized.\u201cThere is no need to apologize,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied with a kind smile before walking up to the employee who managed the portal. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, they spoke in English. The employee then walked away, and Heo Sung-Hoon asked Gi-Gyu to take a step back.Whirrr\u2026Whoosh!Seconds later, the entire area was filled with loud vibrations. As the piercing noises continued, the air split to reveal a blue rip in front of Gi-Gyu.It was a gate.***\u2018The zone portal is structurally so similar to a sustained gate\u2026 Who could\u2019ve thought that? So this gate is actually inside the Tower?\u2019Ever since Gi-Gyu became a true Player after obtaining Lou, it was as if the entire world did a backflip without telling him. Everything he knew turned into useless crap with no value; his life seemed like a lie. And that was after ignoring the fact that every person was seemingly full of secrets.\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d Sung-Hoon called his name.\u201cY-yes?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous. We have arrived.\u201dThey left the Tower in LA and were inside the car on the way to the new gate. Gi-Gyu had been worrying about his passport and visa, but Tae-Shik had already taken care of the paperwork as well.Sung-Hoon must\u2019ve thought Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hear him from being too anxious, so he smiled and assured Gi-Gyu, \u201cI\u2019ll be with you to scout the gate, so don\u2019t worry. For now, please take this.\u201d\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered and took the documents Sung-Hoon handed him. When he looked down, he saw five A4 pages that included a detailed report.Sung-Hoon explained, \u201cThis is the summary of what the scouting team found so far about this new gate. In this maze, grade C and D monsters have been appearing frequently. They said even grade A monsters have been spotted occasionally. But the scouting team has only examined a small part of the maze so far; please remember that this isn\u2019t a full description of the gate. It might even be better to rely solely on your instincts as a Player instead of trusting this information.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered appreciatively.\u201cIf you look at the next page, you\u2019ll see the list of important Players and guilds that are participating in this US maze gate. This new US maze gate has been named the\u00a0Maze of Heryond,\u201d Sung-Hoon continued.\u201cThe names of the three high rankers who are participating are Ironshield, Athena, and Lucifer,\u201d Sung-Hoon added. The high rankers often used code names for themselves to hide their true identities. These code names were approved by the association based on the high rankers\u2019 unique qualities.Ironshield was a high ranker from the US, Athena was from Europe, and Lucifer was\u2026Gi-Gyu asked in surprise, \u201cDid you just say Lucifer?\u201d\u201cYes, Lucifer will also be participating,\u201d Sung-Hoon answered.Lucifer was the second most famous Korean high ranker after Lee Sung-Ho. Her incredible luck and vicious personality were why she was nicknamed after the devil. She seemed more than happy with killing anyone who crossed her or attacked her first. This was why only a few high-level Players knew her true identity.So, Gi-Gyu couldn't believe Lucifer was entering this gate as well.Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cIn addition, many other rankers and world guilds are also participating. You can read it over for more details.\u201dGi-Gyu asked cautiously, \u201cDo you know Lucifer\u2019s true identity?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m only a lowly association employee,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied.\u201cOkay,\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded and closed his eyes. Now that he knew so many powerful Players were entering this gate, Gi-Gyu reckoned he would be no more than a bottom-feeder. Since it was quite likely he would be the weakest one there, was it even possible for him to get his hands on the elixir?-Why are you so worried?Lou asked and continued.-Don\u2019t worry so much. Worrying won\u2019t change a thing.Gi-Gyu got out of the car after hearing Lou\u2019s unmotivational motivation. Suddenly, countless people circled him and began whispering among themselves.\u201cWho is he?\u201d one onlooker asked.\u201cHe was riding the association car, so maybe he\u2019s from the association?\u201d another man guessed.\u201cDoes anyone know who he is?\u201d someone yelled out a question.\u201cIf he came in the association car, he couldn\u2019t be just a low-level Player,\u201d a passerby commented.Gi-Gyu could hear people around him murmuring, but he couldn\u2019t understand because they were all speaking in English. Feeling awkward, he walked ahead with Sung-Hoon. Gi-Gyu was surrounded by many people; as he walked the small path, he could see a blue gate rippling in the air.This was Gi-Gyu\u2019s first time abroad; before he could even tour a single place, he was faced with this new maze gate.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23. The Maze of Heryond (2)\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d asked a petite, black-haired woman wearing a black mask and a pair of large sunglasses. The man standing next to her, who was carrying a comically large bag, answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d\u201cThen use your fancy detection skill and figure it out,\u201d the woman ordered. Very few players of the support category had the Detection skill; it allowed a player to peek into other players\u2019 approximate levels, stats, and skills. This ability depended on the user\u2019s strength, so the information gained by various players with the same ability could be different. The man carrying the large bag wore nerdy glasses; of course, he was the highest support level player.\u201cHuh?\u201d When the man seemed confused, the woman\u2019s expression changed as she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe mild interest on her face turned into full-on curiosity as the man explained, \u201cHe\u2019s only Level 1? And\u2026 he basically has no stats. From what I can see, he has a unique ability; no idea what it is, though.\u201d\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t see it?\u201d the woman asked in confusion.\u201cNo, this has never happened before, so I\u2019m not sure how to proceed,\u201d replied the man in glasses, seeming genuinely bewildered.The woman lamented, \u201cGosh, your old age\u2019s finally hindering the one good thing about you? Can\u2019t even use your only skill properly, useless! Tsk.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say? How dare you! Just give me a minute,\u201d the man in the glasses replied angrily. While glaring at her through his glasses to \u201cdetect\u201d her, the man continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve been together almost every day, so when did you get the time to level up? You\u2019re already Level 3\u2014\u201dBefore he could even complete his sentence, she stood on her toes, smacked her hand on his lips, and complained, \u201cI didn\u2019t put any barrier around us, jerk. Have you lost your mind? What if someone's listening in?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Can\u2019t you be more\u2026 lady-like?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t complain about the way I speak. You\u2019re being sexist.\u201d When the woman warned him, the man nodded and replied, \u201cAlright.\u201dThe woman with long black hair took a step back and watched Gi-Gyu, who was looking around as if he was lost. A few foreign players approached him with interest, but Gi-Gyu just stammered with his broken English.The woman took her large sunglasses off and murmured, \u201cThat player arrived in the association car to enter the Maze of Heryond, but he can\u2019t speak a lick of English? He\u2019s getting more interesting by the minute.\u201dHer unique violet eyes sparkled as she continued, \u201cHis face is my type too. Very interesting indeed.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Please don\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d the man with the large bag begged.\u201cDon\u2019t talk back to me,\u201d replied the woman as her eyes remained glued to Gi-Gyu\u2019s back.***\u201cPlease stay here. I\u2019m going to go see some association people to get the entrance permission.\u201d When Sung-Hoon asked politely, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAh, of course. Please take your time.\u201dAll capable players could enter maze-type gates; to sieve out dangerous players like the Red Players, the association confirmed everyone\u2019s identity beforehand. If a ranked Red Player entered the Maze of Heryond, this hell on earth could instantly transform into something much worse.\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in confusion. Sung-Hoon left him only for a moment, but all the many eyes glued on him gave him chills. Some even tried to make conversation with him, but all Gi-Gyu could do was keep repeating the only English phrase he knew.\u201cI can\u2019t speak English,\u201d Gi-Gyu said once more to another player who approached him. Every time this happened, they seemed confused as they tilted their heads before leaving him.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d sighed Gi-Gyu. If he survived this journey inside the gate, he decided to make learning English a priority. Gi-Gyu knew that someday, he would have to enter not only the Korean gates but also those located all over the world. Meeting foreigners would be a surety then, so learning English was an absolute necessity.Until now, he never had to speak English because he had been working as a guide for the Korean association. But, he suspected things would be different now. After Heo Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t return for quite a while, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind began to wander, and he had a silly thought. He muttered, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get so powerful that the association will provide me with an interpreter wherever I go. That would be nice.\u201d-By the time something like that happens, you might already be speaking every language in the world.\u201cNow that I think about it, how am I able to communicate with you guys? Are you speaking Korean to me?\u201d asked\u00a0Gi-Gyu.-What are you talking about? Our communication is conceptual. We don\u2019t know Korean. Well, we\u2019ve learned a little from you now, but not much.-Lou is right. I have been studying Korean very hard to not become a burden, Master. To be honest, I think Lou can also speak pretty fluent Korean.-S-shut up!His Egos' conversation made Gi-Gyu smile. While busy chatting with Lou and El, he finally noticed Sung-Hoon waving at him from afar. It seemed Sung-Hoon wanted Gi-Gyu to come closer, so he got walking. When he got closer, Sung-Hoon offered, \u201cPlease follow me.\u201dBefore long, they stood before an interim tent where Sung-Hoon handed him a bag.\u201cPlease take this bag.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cThis is something the general manager prepared for you in advance. This bag has a built-in expansion spell, and it\u2019s filled with potions and disposable items. There is also enough food to last at least a month,\u201d explained Sung-Hoon.\u201cA month?\u201d Gi-Gyu was surprised to hear this because he expected the Maze of Heryond to take at least three months to clear. Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion, Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cThe general manager also asked me to tell you that if you\u2019re still alive after a month, you should return home.\u201d\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered easily, but he had no intention of following Tae-Shik\u2019s order. He didn\u2019t plan on leaving the gate until he had cleared it and had the elixir in his hands. Unless, of course, something unexpected forced him to do otherwise.\u201cAnd this is also for you as well,\u201d said Sung-Hoon as he took something out from his pocket. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s the Arachne\u2019s Ball of Thread. This is known to be a necessity inside all maze-type gates. This item gives you a single chance to return to the gate entrance, so please make sure you don\u2019t lose it.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu took the red ball of thread, making its status screen appear.[Arachne\u2019s Ball of Thread][Single use item that can be used to teleport to the gate\u2019s entrance.]As he held the bag and the ball in his hands, Gi-Gyu ran a mental calculation. The bag with the expansion magic, all items inside, and then there was the Arachne\u2019s Ball. Buying all this together would\u2019ve sent any normal player into a spiral of debt, but he got it for free. He couldn\u2019t help feeling that his debt to Tae-Shik was growing fast.\u2018I might have to repay him for the rest of my life.\u2019Gi-Gyu already owed Tae-Shik so much. He mumbled, \u201cIf he\u2019s so willing to help, I wish he could\u2019ve helped me when I was having trouble with the family debt.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d asked Sung-Hoon, thinking he missed an important comment from Gi-Gyu.\u201cNothing,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and shook his head. Despite what he mumbled, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve never accepted any sort of financial help from Tae-Shik. In fact, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve distanced himself from Tae-Shik had he made such an offer. Although Gi-Gyu knew the importance of paying one\u2019s debt, what he valued, even more, was doing his best to avoid being in debt in the first place.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside now. I have one day to spare, so I will help you to the best of my abilities,\u201d Sung-Hoon offered.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201dAfter going through different procedures and preparations, it was finally happening\u2014It was finally time to enter the gate. Gi-Gyu felt his heart ache a little.\u2018I will either obtain the elixir for my mother or\u2026\u2019Or he was going to die trying.***\u201cDodge that web!\u201d Sung-Hoon warned Gi-Gyu.\u201cGot it!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled as he turned once to avoid the giant spider\u2019s web.\u201cFire!\u201d shouted Sung-Hoon and threw his spear. His weapon flew like the wind and hit the center of the spider\u2019s countless eyes. Seconds later, it began glowing with a crimson-orangish hue; then, it exploded.\u201cKweggg!!!!!!!\u201d the giant spider screamed and fell. Within a few seconds, it stopped moving.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d As Gi-Gyu huffed breathlessly, Sung-Hoon walked up to him and asked, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dJust like Gi-Gyu, Heo Sung-Hoon\u2019s clothes were also in shreds, proving how intense their battle was. With a sigh, Sung-Hoon stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect grade C monsters to appear so early on.\u201dStudying Sung-Hoon with awe, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI\u2019m more surprised by you, Sung-Hoon. You killed that grade C monster so easily.\u201dSung-Hoon laughed as he responded, \u201cI\u2019m just a bottom-level staff at the association.\u201dFor the past ten hours, they had been hunting inside the Maze of Heryond without rest. They\u2019ve been trying to study the routes within the gate; by now, the two players had an idea of the general directions.The Maze of Heryond was vast and twisted, so they couldn\u2019t find the correct path easily. If they found the correct path, they could advance without being interrupted by the monsters or the traps. The best they could do now was mark the roads with a special dye, so they could avoid crossing the same path twice.\u201cSung-Hoon, what level are you? Oh, but if you\u2019re uncomfortable with telling me, you can just tell me your grade,\u201d Gi-Gyu asked respectfully. In their last fight, it became apparent that Sung-Hoon was, at the very least, as strong as a grade C monster. A moment ago, they had a little trouble because a swarm of monsters attacked them together. However, if Sung-Hoon fought a grade C monster one on one, Gi-Gyu suspected Sung-Hoon could kill it in under five minutes. Gi-Gyu had never hunted with a high-level player, so his curiosity was at an all-time high.\u201cI\u2019m grade B, but I\u2019ll take the Fifth on my exact level,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon with a faint smile. This answer made Gi-Gyu compare Sung-Hoon to himself. There was no doubt Sung-Hoon was stronger, but Gi-Gyu felt confident he could catch up if he worked hard enough. The gap between them didn\u2019t seem as impossible as the one between Tae-Shik and himself.After a short rest, Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon resumed hunting. By now, the duo had a solid routine. Whenever they came across a crossroad, they marked the path they took. When they found themselves at the same crossroad, they chose the other path. It was a simple plan, but this was the only way to effectively manage a maze gate.Whatever booby traps or monsters they faced on their way were their burdens to carry. Other than that, there was nothing else to be concerned about.After 15 hours had passed since they entered the Maze of Heryond, Sung-Hoon announced, \u201cI better turn around now, considering how long it will take to return to the entrance.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work,\u201d thanked Gi-Gyu as he offered his hand. Sung-Hoon shook it and added, \u201cBased on what I saw, clearing this gate would be hard for you, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll die from it. I heard you used to be called the \u2018Player Who Can\u2019t Level Up\u2019 until very recently. So, it\u2019s obvious your growth rate is incredible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m flattered, but I know I still have a long way to go.\u201dWith seriousness in his eyes, Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cI believe you have enough skills to escape if you meet any monsters you can\u2019t handle. So your main problem will be the other players. Please be wary of them.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu nodded, Sung-Hoon emphasized, \u201cYou must especially avoid all the guilds and players that were highlighted red on that list. And if you meet a ranker or a high ranker, please use the Arachne\u2019s Ball of Thread.\u201d With a smile, he added, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t try to save it in an emergency situation. You must remember that there is nothing more important than your own life.\u201d\u201cI will remember that. When you return, please tell Tae-Shik hyung not to worry,\u201d Gi-Gyu requested.\u201cOf course. Then I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dSung-Hoon took the marked path and left without looking back once. After spending 15 hours together, they should\u2019ve, at least, become acquaintances even if they were strangers before. So, Gi-Gyu expected Sung-Hoon to turn around and say goodbye again; to Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, Sung-Hoon never turned around. He quickly disappeared from Gi-Gyu\u2019s sight.\u201cNow, let\u2019s get started for real,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced quietly. The truth was\u2026 He never went all-out while fighting alongside Sung-Hoon. He only revealed a part of his skills that was enough to pass the 20th-floor test.It wasn\u2019t that Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t trust Sung-Hoon. It was because\u2026\u2018I could feel someone watching us from somewhere.\u2019-I do too.-Me too, Master.During this entire hunt, Gi-Gyu had this faint feeling that someone was watching him. Now that Sung-Hoon was gone, it was going to be much easier to lose this unknown observer.***\u201cOh, my. Did he figure out I\u2019ve been watching him?\u201d the black-haired woman murmured quietly; She was the one spying on Gi-Gyu all this time from close by.The woman was no longer wearing sunglasses. She was only wearing her mask; based on the shape of her face and eyes, it was clear she was a great beauty. Even with the armor, her silhouette suggested she was an attractive woman.Her companion murmured, \u201cHe must\u2019ve good instincts.\u201d\u201cGood instincts? He figured out the fact that I\u2019ve been observing him. He also found out where we were hiding. You think that\u2019s just \u2018good instincts?\u2019\u201d replied the woman with a smirk. Suddenly, the surrounding air turned cold as she added, \u201cThat\u2019s not just instinct.\u201dThe man in glasses frowned in confusion. Ignoring him, the woman continued, \u201cThere is something more to that man. This confirms it. I\u2019m finding him so much more interesting now.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to clear this gate?\u201d asked the man in frustration. With an annoyed frown, the woman grumbled, \u201cWho cares about this maze? I finally found a man who can pique my interest!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t enough. Let\u2019s try to get closer,\u201d the woman proposed.\u201cPardon? W-wh-what?\u201d the man in glasses yelled, but the woman had already disappeared.\u201cSighhhh\u2026\u201d The man in glasses sighed even more deeply.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24. The Maze of Heryond (3)Out of sheer instinct, Gi-Gyu jumped up and narrowly dodged a giant spider\u2019s front leg. Then, he propelled himself with the help of an adjacent wall and swung Lou.Slice!With a gruesome slashing noise, he amputated the giant spider\u2019s front leg.\u201cKweggggggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d the giant spider screamed as its body twisted in pain.-Focus! It\u2019s not dead yet!But, there was no need for Lou to shout because Gi-Gyu was already prepared.\u201cI know that!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled as he turned toward the monster again. Using the torque from that turn as fuel, he swung Lou. That turn also helped him narrowly dodge a piece of spider web that flew out from nowhere.Crack!With a loud crashing sound, the giant spider\u2019s head dented visibly.\u2018Got one!\u2019He had killed one monster successfully, but there were still two more surrounding him. Gi-Gyu jumped again to escape a clump of spider webs; while still being in the air, he set his trajectory toward his next target. But\u2026\u201cDammit!\u201d he swore when he spotted an extra monster that had escaped his detection. Then, a spider web suddenly entered his field of vision; seconds later, it had engulfed him. Gi-Gyu, helpless and immobile, fell to the ground.Thud!\u201cUgh!\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned. It wasn\u2019t a bad fall, but his whole body spasmed. Since the spider web was extremely sticky, freeing himself from it was proving difficult. Meanwhile, the giant spiders didn\u2019t stop for a smoke break; they were still speeding toward the immobile Gi-Gyu. Just imagine a swarm of spiders rushing toward you\u2014horrifying, right? Now, imagine them 100 times bigger; that was what Gi-Gyu was seeing.Gi-Gyu struggled harder and faster as he groaned, \u201cArgh!\u201d The struggle paid off as he succeeded in reaching his bag; from it, he fished out a potion. By this time, the giant spiders were just inches from him.Blaze!He busted the potion bottle, poured its contents on himself, and started a fire using that as a base. Thanks to that, he burned away the spider web bounding him, but he couldn\u2019t avoid being burnt as well.Whack!It was just then that a giant spider\u2019s front leg slammed down on Gi-Gyu\u2019s torso. The giant spiders\u2019 legs were known for both their sharpness and power which was comparable to a heavy hammer. That single kick sent Gi-Gyu flying before he was plastered on a wall.Crack!Two explosions took place at that moment. The first was when Gi-Gyu hit the wall, and the second was the giant spider\u2019s head cracking from Brunheart\u2019s reflection skill.\u2018That\u2019s the second one so far.\u2019[Strong Will is being triggered.][Your stamina will recover very quickly.]The giant spider\u2019s last attack must\u2019ve been strong enough to kill Gi-Gyu. He suspected this was why the Strong Will skill was activated. Then, he stood up slowly.\u201cKweggg!\u201d\u201cKweg!\u201dThe giant spiders continued to shoot their webs in confusion, but Gi-Gyu managed to dodge them. Thanks to Strong Will, much of his stamina had recovered. Gi-Gyu kicked the ground again to attack. There were only two spiders left, but he had been fighting them for the past 30 minutes. Had there been a single extra monster there, he would\u2019ve been imagining his tombstone.After finishing off the rest of the giant spiders, Gi-Gyu picked up their crystals and sat down on the ground. His legs were shaking so badly that he didn\u2019t think they could support him.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe battles were becoming tougher. Fighting higher-level monsters allowed his Egos to level up faster, but the risks were increasing significantly as well. However, Gi-Gyu was adapting to his new situation quickly. When he first entered this gate, he found fighting a single giant spider difficult. It was just like when he battled a goblin every day before he found the Egos. But Gi-Gyu had been fighting without any skills or abilities for the first five years as a player. He was used to stress and danger, which were part of his everyday life. Now that he had been in this gate for a while, Gi-Gyu could hunt three spiders simultaneously. It was a close battle, but he managed to survive it.\u201cLet\u2019s take a little break,\u201d Gi-Gyu suggested to his Egos.-Don\u2019t be in such a hurry.-Lou\u2019s right, Master.\u201cAll right. Anyway, I don\u2019t feel like anyone is watching me anymore.\u201d Gi-Gyu thought out loud. It had been a week since he entered the Maze of Heryond; by now, that distinct feeling had faded. Perhaps Gi-Gyu was imagining it all, and there was never someone spying on him. After mulling over the matter for a while, he decided to chuck it at the back and focus on the more important stuff: His current situation.At odd times, he did face monsters other than the giant spiders; at the end of the day, giant spiders remained his most frequent customers. This wasn\u2019t a good sign since it meant he wasn\u2019t getting any close to where he needed to be. As players got closer to a boss room, the monsters they encountered would become progressively stronger. And that was rousing Gi-Gyu\u2019s anxiousness.At the very least, Gi-Gyu should\u2019ve been seeing different types of monsters as he advanced. This would\u2019ve meant he was on the right track. Sadly, nothing changed even as more time passed, so Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling panicked.\u201cKyaaa!\u201dWhile Gi-Gyu was resting on the ground, he suddenly heard a young girl\u2019s scream.***Before taking any action, Gi-Gyu contemplated for a brief moment. Should he save the screaming girl? But, what was a young girl doing inside the gate? Wasn\u2019t she a bit too young for this?\u201cKyaaaa!\u201dWhen he heard another scream, he didn\u2019t hesitate. In this day and age, a player\u2019s age was meaningless. Even a 10-year-old child could become a player and hunt monsters.\u201cGotta act like a decent man,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered as he sprinted with Lou and El in his hands. Since he could hear the scream, the girl shouldn\u2019t be too far away. Following the scream was easy, and his speed helped him close the distance fleetly.\u201cKya! Please save me!\u201d the screamer shouted in Korean.\u201cHang on!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled to reassure the little girl. Before long, a young girl with jet-black hair entered his sights. She was holding a short dagger and trembling as she stared at a giant spider. The moment Gi-Gyu confirmed that it was indeed a colleen who needed his help, he ran towards the giant spider.Gi-Gyu screamed urgently, \u201cStep back!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous!\u201d the little girl shouted, but he continued to dash forward.\u2018Huh?\u2019Gi-Gyu flinched when he suddenly felt himself moving a little faster. But, before he could process what was happening, Lou was already around the giant spider\u2019s head.Slice!Now, a single slash from Lou was enough to split a giant spider\u2019s head. The monster\u2019s head began spurting green blood; to make sure it was dead, Gi-Gyu took another step forward and stabbed the monster\u2019s head several times with Lou.[You have gained some experience points.][Lou has absorbed the giant spider\u2019s blood and has developed internal immunity against poison.]After Lou succeeded in absorbing the giant spider\u2019s ability, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t pick up the crystal. Instead, he ran toward the young girl and asked, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cAh, Ahjussi[1], thank you!\u201d the young girl replied gratefully.\u201cAhjussi? Umm\u2026 You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. Would you like to rest for a while now?\u201d Being called Ahjussi surprised Gi-Gyu, but he quickly recovered.\u201cO-okay\u2026\u201d answered the still-shocked girl and sat down with a dazed look. After making sure she was safe, Gi-Gyu picked up the giant spider\u2019s crystal. Then, he grabbed a water bottle, some jerky, and offered it to her, \u201cHere, have some.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d The young girl seemed much calmer now. She certainly looked young; since she was a player, she wouldn\u2019t be mentally scarred or anything by this encounter. After handing her the jerky and the water, Gi-Gyu sat down some distance away from her.The young girl was very beautiful, perhaps too beautiful for a child. Suddenly, Gi-Gyu wondered, \u2018Maybe she isn\u2019t a child?\u2019From the looks of it, she seemed 16, but her long jet-black hair and alluring face suggested otherwise. Her small height made her look like a child, but there was something very mature about her overall look. What shocked Gi-Gyu the most was her unique violet eyes.\u2018Maybe she is multiracial?\u2019He felt curious; knowing it would be rude to ask such a personal question, Gi-Gyu kept quiet. He also decided to give her a little more time to calm down before asking any questions.\u2018This is the Maze of Heryond, which means it\u2019s the worst place to be. So a young Korean girl here\u2026 Anyway, since she can survive for so long in a place filled with giant spiders, she can\u2019t be a newbie.\u2019There were so many things that didn\u2019t make sense about this girl. Feeling oddly apprehensive, Gi-Gyu distanced himself a bit more from her. There was something very strange about this situation.The young girl thanked him again, \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\u201cWhy are you here alone?\u201d Gi-Gyu finally asked.\u201cI came in here as a part of a group, but I got lost,\u201d she replied as tears began welling in her eyes. She looked pitiful, but he ignored it. There weren\u2019t any monsters around them, which meant she was safe for now. Back then, he felt obligated to save her, and he did. However, wiping away her tears was never his responsibility.But, Gi-Gyu still felt a bit uncomfortable. The more he looked at the girl, the more she reminded him of Yoo-Jung.He asked her awkwardly, \u201cYou\u2019re lost? Haa\u2026 Is there a way for you to contact your group?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dAfter contemplating for a long time, Gi-Gyu stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not in a position to take you back to the gate entrance. You\u2019re a player too, so you must know that only you\u2019re responsible for your own life, right?\u201dThen, he began rummaging through his bag. The girl looked surprised, but she accepted the reality soon. Handing her a small package, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cThis is a safe zone installation kit. This isn\u2019t the highest quality item, so it might perish in just a single day. But someone might come to help you within that time, so it will at least give you a chance.\u201d\u201cA-Ahjussi\u2026\u201d the girl murmured fearfully, but Gi-Gyu said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ve to save yourself.\u201dHe felt apologetic for being so blunt, but he had no choice. She reminded Gi-Gyu so much of his sister Yoo-Jung, but this whole \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d scenario smelled fishy to him. And even more importantly, he didn\u2019t have any time to waste. Gi-Gyu had to clear this gate as quickly as possible. So, there was no time for him to help this girl find her group.Besides, he had already done the decent thing. He had already saved her life, and that was more than enough in most cases. Gi-Gyu was just about to leave when suddenly, he felt his shirt being pulled.\u201cAhjussi\u2026\u201dWhen he turned around, he saw the girl holding the edge of his shirt and looking up at him. Now that he saw her up close, he realized that she was even more beautiful than he initially thought. Despite her vernal looks, there was something strangely seductive about her.Feeling uncomfortable, Gi-Gyu pushed her hand away and took a step back.\u2018She smiled?\u2019For a second, he thought he saw her smile. But perhaps he was mistaken because there were only tears in her violet eyes. She pleaded, \u201cI belong to the support category! I\u2019m pretty talented, which is why I came here. A-and\u2026 When you were fighting that spider, I even cast a buff spell on you to help\u2026\u201dOnly then did Gi-Gyu recall the sudden increase in speed and strength he experienced back then. Now, he realized it was the girl\u2019s doing. With an ugly frown, he warned her, \u201cHaven't you learn not to cast spells on others without permission?\u201dUnless it was a familiar companion player, casting a buff spell on another player without permission was a huge taboo. A supporter player could only cast a buff spell on another player if they were given clear permission. This was important because a sudden buff could confuse players and lead them to their deaths; this was especially true during a battle.Whimper, whimper.\u00a0\u201cI-I haven\u2019t been a player for lo-long, and my level is v-very low too. But, I have a unique ability, so they told me they would pay me a lot\u2026 A-and my mom is really sick, s-so\u2026\u201d the young girl explained between her sobs. She kept wiping her eyes with her sleeves, but her tears refused to stop.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu finally had a clear picture. This child was a newbie player, but she was blessed with a unique ability at a very young age. It seemed her unique ability was the buff-up spell. Because buff-related unique abilities were rare, some players must\u2019ve recognized her usefulness. It was obvious they lured her into this place of extreme danger.To bring an uneducated young child to a gate like this was a stupid idea. It was no wonder she got lost and was now separated from the group.\u2018I don\u2019t know which group she belongs to; if I ever make it out, I\u2019ll have to report it.\u2019A player was, of course, responsible for their own life regardless of their age. But this girl didn\u2019t receive even the most basic training, and she was a minor. So, Gi-Gyu decided to make an exception.He asked, \u201cIs your mother\u2019s illness something a hospital can cure if you had the money?\u201d\u201cYea-yeah,\u201d the girl answered hesitantly.Like that, if Gi-Gyu found the elixir, he wouldn\u2019t have to share it with her. This also meant she wasn\u2019t going to stab him in the back to steal the elixir. After deciding what he must do, Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go back to the gate entrance. I have to reach the maze\u2019s center, and that means it\u2019s only gonna get more dangerous. Are you sure you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d\u201cPardon? You\u2019re going to take me with you?\u201d\u201cYes, but if I find out you\u2019re not useful, I\u2019m going to dump you on any group we meet on the way. If that\u2019s still okay with you, you can come with me.\u201dThe young girl smiled brightly and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201dHer buff skill could prove useful as they could certainly make his battles much easier. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu kept telling himself he wasn\u2019t helping her because of her sick mother. And it also definitely wasn\u2019t because she reminded him of Yoo-Jung.While Gi-Gyu justified his decision, Lou muttered in annoyance.-Gosh, you\u2019re an idiot.1.

    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25. The Maze of Heryond (4)It had been three weeks since Gi-Gyu entered the Maze of Heryond and two since he saved the girl. After spending so much time inside the maze, Gi-Gyu changed a lot.\u201cLet\u2019s eat now,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cI\u2019m sick of eating jerky every day\u2026 Should I cook instant noodles or something today?\u201d the girl offered eagerly.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t cook any food with a strong smell inside the gates or the Tower. It will attract monsters or other players with bad intentions,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained patiently.\u201cThen we can\u2019t cook any food at all?\u201d When Soo-Jung asked with a sad frown, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cUnfortunately, yes, unless you find a place you\u2019re completely certain is safe.\u201d\u201cAh! Okay. Thank you for letting me know,\u201d the black hair girl, Soo-Jung, answered and began filling her notepad with this new info. Gi-Gyu watched her crooked writing and smiled.The girl\u2019s name was Jung Soo-Jung. Even her name sounded similar to his sister, so Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but feel affectionate toward her. As he suspected, Soo-Jung received the invitation to become a player just last year. Apparently, an unnie[1]\u00a0Soo-Jung knew very well introduced her to a guide. Ever since then, she had been working with this guide as a team. It seemed this guide insisted on working with Soo-Jung because he knew about her unique ability.\u2018Not only did that guide use her, but he also didn\u2019t educate her properly.\u2019This guide barred her from interacting with other players, didn\u2019t teach her the basics everyone knew, and even made her work like a mule. It seemed he was just stringing her along.\u2018At least it didn\u2019t sound like he did anything unforgivable to her,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought with relief. Because Soo-Jung was such a beautiful girl, the male guide could\u2019ve had an ulterior motive toward her. But based on what he had heard from her, it didn\u2019t sound like her guide did anything like that.Since they met two weeks ago, Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung had been roaming the maze together. Currently, they were in an area frequented by poisonous slimes and venomous ants of grade C and B, respectively. Their physical stats were trash, but they retained powerful toxins as their weapon. Fortunately, Gi-Gyu had gained a certain level of immunity toward monster poison after hunting all those giant spiders. This made it a little easier for him to hunt these venomous monsters.The more poisonous slimes and venomous ants he killed, the more blood Lou absorbed. And that, in turn, increased Gi-Gyu's poison immunity. This meant hunting these creatures was becoming even easier as he advanced.Gi-Gyu had to admit Soo-Jung had been a big help so far. Her unique ability,\u00a0Marking, allowed her to increase another player\u2019s stats by 10 percent. It was such an incredible ability that Gi-Gyu could now understand a bit of the guide\u2019s turn of mind. After all, a 10% boost could easily turn a loss into a victory.So far, Gi-Gyu chose not to dump Soo-Jung to another group. He had been traveling with her through this maze until now, but he had already told her that she could leave him at any time.\u201cOppa! I leveled up again!\u201d Soo-Jung announced proudly.\u201cCongrats.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied calmly, Soo-Jung complained, \u201cOh, come on! That was so insincere! You need to congratulate me with more excitement!\u201dBy now, they were close enough for Soo-Jung to address Gi-Gyu as \u201cOppa\u201d rather than \u201cAhjussi.\u201d They had been fighting dangerous monsters side by side for the past few weeks, so it was no wonder they became acquainted quicklyGi-Gyu warned, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that we\u2019re still inside the maze. You can\u2019t speak that loudly, Soo-Jung. Didn\u2019t I tell you already that every moment here is more dangerous than the last?\u201d\u201cBut if the monsters appear, you\u2019ll protect me by killing all of them with your pretty swords!\u201d Soo-Jung replied innocently.\u201cGosh\u2026 Our lives are in constant danger, so I don\u2019t understand how you can be so calm. Anyway, let\u2019s just eat our jerky and get going,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced with an exasperated sigh.\u201cOkay!\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung continued to eat their meals. Unfortunately, his food supply was disappearing quickly. To begin with, it was only enough to only last him a month; with Soo-Jung\u2019s appearance, it was vanishing faster than he anticipated. She explained that her bag, which held all of her supplies, was taken away by her guide.\u2018But she has been enduring this journey very well.\u2019To Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, Soo-Jung rarely asked to take a break. He suspected she was pushing herself to not burden him, and he felt thankful for it. After they finished their jerky, Gi-Gyu quickly cleaned up and led the way again; Soo-Jung just followed him.-She\u2019s doing really well, especially for a girl. I mean, she hasn\u2019t asked for a break this entire time.\u2018You think so too?\u2019-Is this what you mean when you say someone has the potential to become a high ranker?\u2018Yup. She\u2019s also leveling up much quicker compared to ordinary players. If she joins a good guild and gets proper training, she\u2019ll become powerful in no time. What a waste.\u2019-Stop worrying about others and just focus on your own survival.\u2018I know.\u2019Like would be a strong world; for all intents and purposes, Lou didn\u2019t seem to dislike Soo-Jung either. However\u2026-Master, that woman is dangerous.\u2018This again, El?\u2019Since he met Soo-Jung, El had been warning him against helping her.-I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but I get a bad feeling about her. She just feels\u2026 really dangerous.\u2018El, I know you\u2019re only worried about me, but please don\u2019t overreact.\u2019-But Master\u2026\u2018El, you know how much I appreciate you, right? But, you don\u2019t have to worry about his.\u2019After the words of assurance, El didn\u2019t say anything more. Just then, Gi-Gyu lowered his body because he felt an unfamiliar presence nearby; Soo-Jung followed suit. Turning toward her, he whispered, \u201cI think there is a guild ahead of us. Let\u2019s just wait it out here.\u2019Soo-Jung nodded quietly. After he ordered her to wait for him, he walked away. He got closer to the group and hid to study it. Just ahead of him, he could see a group of 30 players marching. Gi-Gyu noticed they were all well-equipped and moving like an army unit.\u2018Are they American players?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu wondered because most players in that group were blond.The one leading the group was a man in snow-white armor; he seemed familiar. Suddenly, Gi-Gyu realized who it was.\u2018He\u2019s Ironshield!\u2019Unlike the high ranker nicknamed Lucifer, whose face remained a mystery, the faces of Ironshield and Athena were well known to the public. Gi-Gyu remembered reading the description of Ironshield, and it matched this group\u2019s leader. And that group he was leading had to be his guild\u2019s members.\u2018Dammit.\u2019As a high ranker, there was no way Ironshield didn\u2019t notice Gi-Gyu\u2019s presence nearby. So, Gi-Gyu quickly turned around.-Move, you idiot!Boom!Moments later, a giant sword struck down the wall behind which Gi-Gyu was hiding just a few milliseconds ago.\u2018That\u2019s not something a human can do!\u2019The huge sword was just as big as Gi-Gyu. The fact that he could throw such a heavy weapon at Gi-Gyu meant Ironshield possessed extraordinary power. But, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t panic; instead, he remained crouched and slowly crawled away. Thankfully, he received no more attacks.***\u201cWas I mistaken?\u201d Ironshield murmured, confused.\u201cGuild Master, what\u2019s wrong? Why did you throw Calleon so suddenly?\u201d one of his guild players asked cautiously.Ironshield shook his head and ordered, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I think I was mistaken. Please go retrieve Calleon.\u201d\u201cOf course, Sir.\u201dIronshield tilted his head and pondered as his subordinate ran to retrieve his sword.\u2018I was certain I felt someone\u2019s presence over there. Was it someone who can fool my senses?\u2019He contemplated for a second before quickly shaking his head. There were only two players in this maze who could hide their presence from him: Athena and Lucifer. But knowing them, Ironshield was certain they would rather fight than spy on him. The spy had to be a small-time player, so Ironshield decided to forget about it since he couldn\u2019t be bothered with finding some low-level player.\u201cArgh,\u201d the player who went to bring back the giant sword groaned as he pulled it out from the wall. But because Calleon was so heavy, the player failed to carry it despite his high power stat. In the end, another guild member had to help him carry the sword back to Ironshield.Their guild master mentioned in disappointment, \u201cIt looks like you have been neglecting your training. Anyway, thanks for the sword.\u201d\u201cWe apologize, Sir,\u201d apologized the embarrassed duo. Despite holding it together, the two players could barely carry the sword.\u201cCalleon,\u201d Ironshield called out to the sword and held it with one hand easily. He then placed it back in its sheath on his back. It almost looked like the sword name Calleon moved on its own when Ironshield called for it.The Iron Guild members gazed at Ironshield with admiration as they murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s our guild master.\u201d Meanwhile, Ironshield was still staring at the area where Gi-Gyu was standing a moment ago.\u2018I\u2019m sure I felt someone over there.\u2019But, shaking his head again, Ironshield ordered, \u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201d\u201cMarch!\u201d his second in command announced loudly. Then, the Iron Guild group resumed their march with Ironshield leading the way.***\u201cHiuck\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s whole body was covered in a cold sweat as he panted. While running away, he only felt the brunt of Ironshield\u2019s power for a second, but it was enough to almost make his heart stop.Had Lou not yelled at him in time, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve been cleaved in two pieces by that giant sword. Worried about Gi-Gyu, Soo-Jung asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Oppa?\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s nothing. There is a guild ahead of us, s-so we must be on the right path af-after all. We\u2019ll just have to be more careful,\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered.\u201cLook how much you're sweating,\u201d Soo-Jung said to him worriedly. When she raised her arm to wipe away his sweat with her shirt sleeve, Gi-Gyu slapped her hand away.Slap!Suddenly, he felt an overwhelming presence similar to what he felt from Ironshield. But, the one standing in front of him was only Soo-Jung, not Ironshield. Both Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung tensed from shock. Realizing he had made a mistake, he apologized, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not feeling well, so I think I overreacted.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Soo-Jung reassured him and wiped away his sweat with her sleeve. Her caring gesture seemed to have a calming effect. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cPhew\u2026 I had no idea he was such a beast.\u201d\u201cWho did you meet?\u201d\u201cHave you heard of a player nicknamed Ironshield?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, Soo-Jung jolted as her eyes widened.\u201cIsn\u2019t he one of the high rankers?\u201d\u201cYeah. Ironshield and his Iron Guild members are marching ahead of us. He just passed by from a distance, but he must\u2019ve felt my presence. No wonder he\u2019s so famous. I almost got caught and killed just now,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cI\u2019m sure he can\u2019t kill a person that easily\u2026\u201d Soo-Jung murmured naively, making his smile turn bitter. She was such an innocent young girl that Gi-Gyu felt an obligation to teach her the reality of this world. He explained, \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand the players\u2019 world yet. It is taboo to spy on another player, both inside the gates and the Tower. No one would be surprised to hear a player got killed from spying on another player.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou never know if whoever is watching you is trying to kill you or not. So, if you find someone spying on you, you must attack him.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re talking about people and not monsters\u2014\u201d When Soo-Jung murmured, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cIf you don\u2019t kill the spy, he might end up killing you. This is a rule of the gate.\u201dSoo-Jung seemed shocked to hear the truth. She asked in confusion, \u201cThen why did you watch him in secret? If you walked up to him and explained your situation, then maybe\u2026\u201dWith a brotherly smile, Gi-Gyu patted her head. When Soo-Jung lowered her head shyly, he suddenly realized what he had done. Gi-Gyu jolted and yanked back his hand.\u2018For a second, I thought she was Yoo-Jung.\u2019He only patted Soo-Jung\u2019s head because he saw his little sister in her. Trying to hide what he had done, Gi-Gyu answered, \u201cEvery player in this place is here for the same reason. We\u2019re all rivals; had I walked up to him, I would\u2019ve only made it easier for him to kill me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m Lucifer or Athena, so he wouldn\u2019t have wasted his time listening to a nobody like me.\u201dSoo-Jung flinched at the mention of Lucifer, but she quickly returned to her previous calm self. She begged, \u201cThen from now on, don\u2019t go out to scout ahead. I\u2019m afraid you might get killed, Oppa.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dIronshield and his guild were one of the most likely people to clear the Maze of Heryond. So, the fact they were heading in the same direction as him meant he was on the right path. If he followed their lead, perhaps Gi-Gyu could reach the boss\u2019 room around the same time.The entire time Gi-Gyu was in the Maze of Heryond, he had one goal. The only way he was going to leave this place alive was if he obtained the elixir. He was still worried about Soo-Jung\u2019s safety, but\u2026\u2018I still have Arachne's Ball of Thread.\u2019In the worst-case scenario, Gi-Gyu planned on giving this item to her and going after the elixir alone.***Another week passed, but the Maze of Heryond still wasn\u2019t cleared. There was no way of knowing what had happened to the other players so far. Did no one reach the boss\u2019 room because of the enormous maze? Or did some players reach the keeper but failed to kill it? Gi-Gyu knew he wouldn\u2019t know anything for certain until this maze gate was cleared. But his ignorance of the overall situation didn\u2019t matter much.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m right behind the Iron Guild. They\u2019ve been killing all the monsters ahead of us, so it\u2019s so much easier now,\u201d Gi-Gyu said out loud. Right now, he was following the Iron Guild\u2019s group. They maintained a good distance from the group, but they still hadn\u2019t encountered many monsters. It seemed the Iron Guild was determined to kill every single monster inside this gate. It was no wonder it was one of the top guilds in the world.Gi-Gyu felt a little disappointed he couldn\u2019t gain more experience and help Lou absorb more monster blood, but he had his priorities. He was here for the elixir, and everything else he gained was just a bonus.Soo-Jung asked, \u201cSo you came here to cure your mother\u2019s illness too, Oppa?\u201d\u201cYup. My mother is very sick right now,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. Everyone who came inside the Maze of Heryond knew about the elixir. Three types of players entered this dangerous gate. Some were hoping to sell the elixir for a fortune, and the others probably wanted to use it to regain youth. There was also a third type: Their goal was the same as Gi-Gyu; they were here because they were desperate.Gi-Gyu was honest about his intentions to Soo-Jung. He explained, \u201cIf you\u2019re after the elixir too, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re enemies. But if you don\u2019t need it, and you help me clear this gate, I will help your mother in any way I can.\u201dSoo-Jung smiled innocently and answered, \u201cNope! I don\u2019t need the elixir. I\u2019m here just for the money, so it\u2019s okay.\u201dGi-Gyu patted her head affectionately and continued walking slowly. Because the Iron Guild was a large group, it wasn\u2019t difficult to follow them. Gi-Gyu knew he had to take his time and move slow to not get caught.Just then, someone jumped on Gi-Gyu from above.-Run!\u201cWhat?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion, but Lou\u2019s warning was too late.Thud!\u201cGot ya, little mouse!\u201d Golden-haired Ironshield, in his snow-white armor and Calleon on his back, grabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s neck and smiled widely.1.

    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26. The Maze of Heryond (5)Ugh...\u201dGi-Gyu coughed up a spurt of blood as Ironshield landed on him; Ironshield\u2019s arm was still pushing down on him. The damage from that single stomp was so immense that Gi-Gyu was surprised he didn\u2019t faint on the spot. His vocal cords struggled to form words; in the end, he weakly stammered,\u201cSoo\u2026 Soo-Jung, run!\u201dThere was no answer to his plea. Instead, Ironshield asked in English, \u201cWho are you? How did you follow me and keep your presence hidden?\u201d\u201cWh-what the h-heck are you s-say-saying?\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand a word Ironshield said. The high ranker pushed Gi-Gyu down further as he persisted, \u201cAnswer me. Tell me, how did you deceive my senses! What are you? If you tell me the truth, I will make your death painless.\u201d\u201cKill? Kill? Please no kill. I can\u2019t speak English!\u201d Recognizing the word \u201ckill,\u201d Gi-Gyu begged in his broken English. Ironshield, looking down at Gi-Gyu emotionlessly, seemed confused as he asked, \u201cWhat?!\u201dUnable to hide his shock, Ironshield muttered, \u201cYou can\u2019t even speak English? Seriously?\u201d\u201cNo. I can\u2019t speak English,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered desperately. Now, all he could do was use his severely-lacking arsenal of English words to explain his situation. Ironshield loosened his grip around Gi-Gyu\u2019s neck a little and murmured, \u201cHaa\u2026 This is ridiculous.\u201dAfter a short conversation, the high ranker concluded Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t lying. Gi-Gyu\u2019s lack of grammatical knowledge made it obvious he didn\u2019t speak English. He could connect every English word he knew to barely create a sentence at his best.\u201cSorry, sorry, sorry. Just gate hunting. Hunting,\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered, frustrating Ironshield even more. Looking down at Gi-Gyu with pity, Ironshield let go of his neck.\u201cKhegg\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu could finally breathe, he opened his bag and drank an internal damage potion. Thankfully, the high ranker didn\u2019t make any move to stop him.\u2018She isn\u2019t here.\u2019The moment he escaped Ironshield\u2019s grasp, Gi-Gyu turned to where Soo-Jung was standing. However, she had vanished from her spot. It seemed she ran away the moment Gi-Gyu was attacked. But he wasn\u2019t disappointed; he was just thankful she got away safely.\u2018I\u2019m so relieved she escaped.\u2019-This isn\u2019t the time to worry about her. I can\u2019t believe a human could have this level of presence. You should be more worried about your own life.\u2018It doesn\u2019t look like he will kill me.\u2019Gi-Gyu glanced at Ironshield, who was watching him with his hand on his forehead. As things stood, it didn\u2019t seem like the high ranker was interested in killing Gi-Gyu. Thinking his explanation had worked, Gi-Gyu began repeating the same broken sentence.\u201cI can\u2019t speak English. I\u2019m just hunting. Gate hunting.\u201d When his hands regained their functionality thanks to the potion, he used them to gesture that he was no threat to the high ranker.\u201cHa! Dammit!\u201d Ironshield spat out the words as if he had made his decision. Moving so fast that Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t even see him, Ironshield whacked the back of Gi-Gyu\u2019s neck. Gi-Gyu fainted without making a single sound.-Haa\u2026-Master\u2026As Gi-Gyu fainted, he could hear Lou and El sighing. After Gi-Gyu fainted on the ground, Ironshield turned to face his guild members running toward him.\u201cGuild Master, we haven\u2019t found any traces of other players around the area,\u201d one of the players reported.\u201c...\u201dWhen Ironshield didn\u2019t reply, the same player asked, \u201cSir? Did you say something?\u201d\u201cNo, just carry this child back to the camp. And gather all the Asian guild members,\u201d ordered Ironshield.\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d all the players answered respectfully. One of the players carried Gi-Gyu as ordered, while another man headed toward where the remaining guild members were resting.A pair of violet eyes glowed nearby, but no one seemed to have noticed them.***\u201cJust who is this kid?\u201d Ironshield murmured in confusion as he watched Gi-Gyu on the ground. Gi-Gyu was stripped of his weapons and currently bound.\u201cMaybe he was sent by Athena or another guild?\u201d When one of his men suggested, Ironshield frowned in annoyance and muttered, \u201cIdiot.\u201d Without turning toward the player, Ironshield explained, \u201cWhy would Athena send a spy who can\u2019t even speak English? What\u2019ll he report if he can\u2019t even understand what we are talking about? And no guild would ever dare to send a scout to spy on us.\u201d\u201cI-I apologize, Sir. B-but, what if he\u2019s pretending not to speak English?\u201d the player asked, convinced his idea was a definite possibility.\u201cHe\u2019ll spill once we begin torturing him. It won\u2019t matter if he speaks English or not then,\u201d Ironshield replied. It seemed the player who spoke up was a rookie. One of the middle-aged guild members reminded the newbie, \u201cDavid, I hope you realize how kind our guild master is being by explaining everything to you. He wants you to learn.\u201dThe middle-aged player was speaking the truth. Although Ironshield didn\u2019t bother to hide his annoyance, he still took the time to explain his thoughts.David\u2019s eyes glowed with admiration. He shouted, \u201cThank you so much, Sir!\u201dThe mindless enthusiasm annoyed Ironshield, so he grabbed his head and muttered, \u201cSteve, don\u2019t encourage him like that. I don\u2019t need a blindly loyal soldier. I want my men to think for themselves and present contrasting opinions from time to time.\u201d\u201cOf course, Sir,\u201d Steve replied with a curt nod. With a slight shake of his head, Ironshield asked, \u201cWhere are the Asian members I asked for earlier? Aren\u2019t they here yet? I told you to gather those who haven\u2019t forgotten their mother tongue, right?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go and check on them again,\u201d two players answered and left. Now alone again, Ironshield looked down at his right hand. It was the same hand that grabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s neck earlier.\u2018Was that Lucifer\u2019s aura?\u2019It was very faint, but he could feel a trace of Lucifer\u2019s aura on his hand. Ironshield felt frustrated, but he was certain his curiosity would be satisfied soon. But, he failed to realize that his favorite sword, Calleon, was trembling, which was very unlike him.***Gi-Gyu regained consciousness with searing pain in his cheeks.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d A distressed moan escaped his mouth as he slowly opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was Ironshield in his snow-white armor and the Iron Guild members. Soon, Gi-Gyu noticed that all the members gathered around him were Asian.\u2018They are here to interpret.\u2019Gi-Gyu quickly realized Ironshield wanted to communicate with him. Ironshield mumbled something, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying. Thankfully, the Asian members walked up to him one by one and began translating. The interpretation took place in the order of Chinese, Japanese, and finally Korean.Gi-Gyu knew who this Korean player was.\u2018That\u2019s Korean-American\u00a0Rogers Han. I remember the Korean media going wild about him entering the Iron Guild.\u2019When Rogers Han entered the famous Iron Guild, the entire Korean population felt pride. Gi-Gyu was star-struck for a moment before he quickly shook his head with a smile.\u2018Ironshield is standing right in front of me, so why am I surprised to see Rogers Han?\u2019Meeting Ironshield was probably as uncommon as meeting the president of the United States. So, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help laughing at himself for being surprised at meeting Rogers Han, who was just one of the many Iron Guild members.\u201cYou must be a spy,\u201d said Roger Han in Korean when it was finally his turn to interpret.\u201cI\u2019m not a spy,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cSo you\u2019re Korean,\u201d Rogers murmured. He then said something to Ironshield, who nodded. It seemed like it was finally time for the long-awaited conversation. Gi-Gyu and Ironshield spoke with Rogers Han\u2019s help.Rogers relayed, \u201cOur guild master is asking who you are. He wants to know why you were spying on our guild and what guild you belong to. Also, tell him how you hid your presence from him and fooled his senses.\u201dAll Iron Guild members present seemed shocked after learning that Gi-Gyu had somehow deceived Ironshield\u2019s senses. Gi-Gyu ignored them as they erupted in murmurs and answered, \u201cI\u2019m just a plain player. I came to hunt inside the Maze of Heryond. I never spied on anyone, and I don\u2019t belong to any guild.\u201dRogers Han interpreted Gi-Gyu\u2019s answer to Ironshield, who nodded.\u2018Did it work? Does he believe me now?\u2019Ironshield\u2019s simple nod briefly brought Gi-Gyu solace, but he quickly realized he was mistaken.\u201cAckkk!\u201dRogers Han suddenly took out his dagger and stabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s thigh. He then pulled out the weapon and poured a healing potion on Gi-Gyu\u2019s wound. Looking down at him without any sympathy, Rogers Han muttered, \u201cYou must be here for the elixir. I can\u2019t believe you thought lying would work in this situation. Not a wise choice.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d As Gi-Gyu endured the pain, he couldn\u2019t help but draw a deep breath. At the same time, he contemplated what he must do to escape this place. He still had Arachne's ball of thread in his pocket, but\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t have Lou and El with me.\u2019His Egos were nowhere near him: Not on his body in their sword form or on his fingers in their ring forms.\u2018Dammit.\u2019When Gi-Gyu looked around, he saw a middle-aged guild member with a white beard studying Lou and El with curiosity. There was no way Gi-Gyu could escape using Arachne\u2019s Ball of Thread without his weapons.\u2018I can escape and then return to this place later\u2026 \u2019Doing so would take him a long time, but Gi-Gyu was certain he could return to this very place from the gate entrance. It was because he had memorized the path to where he was currently. Also, he had been marking all the routes he took, so he knew he could return to this exact spot without much difficulty, even if he was transported to the gate entrance.But, leaving without Lou and El was as stupid an idea as could be; Gi-Gyu was just thankful he was still wearing Brunheart. After a brief hesitation, he opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re correct. I came here to get the elixir. When I noticed your guild, I thought it would be easier for me to approach the keeper if I followed you. But I never intended to spy on you, and I never hid my energy. I just thought Ironshield was leaving me alone for whatever reason he had. I thought it was his way of permitting me to follow.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s answer was mostly true, but there was a bit of a lie in it as well. The result of his response was quickly displayed. Ironshield took out his own dagger and approached Gi-Gyu.***\u201cI-I\u2019m no-not lying\u2026\u201d stammered Gi-Gyu in pain. His mouth was so dry that his voice was beginning to crack.\u201cDamn fool. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re lying even after being tortured by our guild master,\u201d Rogers Han commented in disgust.\u201cNo\u2026 No-not l-lyi-lying\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu pleaded. He really wasn\u2019t lying anymore. The only thing he left out was the fact that he was traveling with Soo-Jung.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. We have already used the detection skill on you, so we know the truth. I never expected to find a Level 1 player without any skills in this maze. I never thought I would see a player like you, period. Are you sure you\u2019re even a player?\u201d Rogers Han interpreted Ironshield\u2019s message. Before Gi-Gyu could even answer, the guild master twisted his dagger plunged in Gi-Gyu\u2019s thigh.\u201cAckk\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned in pain as Rogers Han continued to speak on Ironshield\u2019s behalf.\u201cYou want me to believe you made it all the way here alone? Look at you. You can\u2019t even handle my torture right now. Do you know I changed the rope while you were unconscious? I did that to test you. Currently, you\u2019re bound by a normal rope rather than an item. Yet you can\u2019t even free yourself. The only reason you\u2019re going through this torture is that you\u2019re weak. So weak that you can\u2019t even break a normal rope. All this can only mean one thing: Someone helped you get this far.\u201dGi-Gyu had to admit this was true. Right now, Lou and El were with some unknown middle-aged man.\u00a0Gi-Gyu\u00a0could physically feel his connections with his Egos becoming faint. The only reason he wasn\u2019t dead yet was because of Brunheart. He had enough strength to break the rope; without Lou and El, he couldn\u2019t even attempt an escape.Indeed, the only reason Gi-Gyu could make it this far was because he had help from Lou and El. As a player, they were more important to him than his own life.\u2018Without Brunheart, I would\u2019ve been dead by now.\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s hatred toward Ironshield grew exponentially. The high ranker refused to believe Gi-Gyu and continued to torture him without mercy. At the very least, it would have made more sense to Gi-Gyu if Ironshield had killed him without hesitation.\u2018I\u2019m going to kill him someday. I swear I will.\u2019If he ever made it out alive and saved his mother with the elixir, Gi-Gyu swore to become powerful enough to plunge Lou into the heart underneath that snow-white armor. Noticing the vicious look in Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, Ironshield murmured, \u201cGuess you still haven\u2019t had enough. The torture will continue for another 30 minutes.\u201d\u201cAckkk!\u201dIronshield turned around and left the screaming mess behind. In his place, Rogers Han took control of the dagger still stuck in Gi-Gyu\u2019s thigh. It was clear the Korean-American player had no intention of going easy on his hostage just because they had the same nationality. In fact, unlike Ironshield, who remained blank as he tortured Gi-Gyu, Rogers Han seemed excited. His face was filled with pleasure as he whispered, \u201cI love the sound of a pained scream.\u201dRogers Han licked his lips and cut off Gi-Gyu\u2019s little toe. Screaming in agony, Gi-Gyu swore to himself over and over again.\u2018Ironshield, Iron Guild, and Rogers Han\u2026 I will kill you all someday.\u2019***\u201cI\u2019ll ask you one last time.\u201d Ironshield looked at Gi-Gyu with obvious frustration. Gi-Gyu was by now in a gruesome state. He was covered in blood, and his fingers and toes had been regenerated so many times that his nerve endings there were fried. The only mercy Ironshield showed was not touching Gi-Gyu\u2019s face.But Gi-Gyu\u2019s face was still covered in blood and tears.Rogers Han interpreted Ironshield\u2019s question, \u201cYou must be working for Athena, right\u2026?\u201dIt was a leading question. There was no way Ironshield believed Gi-Gyu was sent by Athena. When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t answer, Ironshield asked another question, \u201cOr did Lucifer send you?\u201d\u201cI-I told yo-you. I am alone\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied weakly, Ironshield thought out loud.\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been Athena. That woman hates people like you. Then it must be Lucifer.\u201dIronshield contemplated all the possibilities. He felt certain Gi-Gyu was sent by Lucifer, but he needed Gi-Gyu to confess. Lucifer was known to act alone, except when she\u00a0was accompanied by her well-known minion. So if Lucifer moved with Gi-Gyu, what was her reasoning behind it?What was Gi-Gyu trying so desperately to hide? Ironshield still had many unanswered questions, which was why he kept Gi-Gyu alive until now. To confirm his suspicion, Ironshield offered some information to Gi-Gyu.\u201cIt\u2019s possible you were used by Lucifer. I\u2019ll tell you what she looks like, so tell me if you have seen her. If you tell me the truth, I will let you live.\u201d This was the last chance Ironshield was willing to give Gi-Gyu. This whole situation confused Ironshield to no end. They had continuously tortured Gi-Gyu for three days, but he still didn\u2019t confess anything useful.Although Ironshield didn\u2019t spell it out, Gi-Gyu also knew this was his last chance. Finally, Ironshield said to him, \u201cShe has violet hair and black eyes. Have you seen her before?\u201dA long silence fell. The guild master didn\u2019t prod his hostage; instead, he waited patiently. But when Gi-Gyu remained silent, Ironshield shook his head and muttered, \u201cI guess you have no intention of answering me.\u201dWith a disappointed look, the high ranker announced, \u201cI\u2019ll admit that you\u2019re a fierce one. Had you been a better player, I might have scouted you. You endured everything very well. I will end your misery with my own sword now.\u201dWhen Ironshield unsheathed Calleon from his back, Rogers Han licked his lips as if disappointed.Just then, one of the guild members yelled as he ran toward them.\u201cGuild Master! We found the gatekeeper\u2019s location!\u201dGi-Gyu recognized this novice player: It was David. Gi-Gyu had seen him being scolded multiple times for making beginner\u2019s mistakes. Although he was slowly losing his consciousness, Gi-Gyu vaguely recognized the words David yelled so loudly.\u2018Kee\u2026 per\u2026?\u2019As he realized the importance of those words, Gi-Gyu began regaining his wit. Meanwhile, Ironshield scolded David, \u201cDavid! You shouldn\u2019t be yelling out important information like that!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201d David stammered.\u201cWell, he\u2019ll be dead in a minute anyway, so I suppose it can\u2019t hurt him to know. Perhaps he\u2019ll feel better knowing this before he dies. David, tell me where the keeper is.\u201d When Ironshield ordered, David glanced at him nervously before answering, \u201cIt\u2019s within 300 meters from here. Because of a device, we couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201dPer Ironshield\u2019s order, Rogers kindly interpreted the information to Gi-Gyu. It was disgusting to see Rogers looking so pleased with the prospect of Gi-Gyu\u2019s impending death.\u2018Dammit.\u2019When Gi-Gyu listened to David\u2019s description, he couldn\u2019t help swearing to himself. He was certain he recognized the place David was talking about. It was where he was attacked by Ironshield.Tears of regret began rolling down his eyes.\u2018It was right in front of my eyes, yet I didn\u2019t see it.\u2019But what was the point of knowing the keeper\u2019s location now? After all, he was going to die in just a few minutes. Suddenly, the memories of his mother, Yoo-Jung, and Tae-Shik crossed his mind. From the beginning, Gi-Gyu had known there was a high chance he was not going to survive this journey, but he didn\u2019t expect to die at a fellow player\u2019s hands.After David gave his report, Ironshield turned toward Gi-Gyu and said his final words, \u201cNow, you must go in peace. It has been a long time since I met a player with such grit. You have no abilities at all, so to have endured my torture for so long is truly impressive. I can see why Lucifer allowed you to accompany her. \u201dIt was clear Ironshield was genuine in his compliment. He really thought Gi-Gyu was \u201cimpressive.\u201d Ironshield grabbed Calleon again and said his farewell, \u201cGoodbye.\u201dIronshield wanted to show his respect to Gi-Gyu for enduring his torture for so long. Calleon moved beautifully in the air and was just about to fall on Gi-Gyu when suddenly\u2026Thwock!A moonlit arrow struck Ironshield\u2019s shoulder.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27. Lucifer\u2019s ArrivalGaah!\u201dA gruesome sound escaped Ironshield\u2019s mouth before he muttered angrily, \u201cArtemis\u2019 arrow? Is this Athena\u2019s doing?.\u201d\u201cHehehe, you got it!\u201d replied a woman as the air nearby suddenly began to crease. Seconds later, two women appeared from within: A beautiful woman with a silver bob cut and another wearing an old Greek god\u2019s mask.\u201cAthena and Artemis. I see your skills have improved since the last time we met,\u201d Ironshield murmured as he pulled out the moonlit arrow from his shoulder and threw it at them. The silver-haired player caught it easily.\u201cLong time no see, Ironshield,\u201d greeted the silver-haired woman.\u201cArtemis\u2026\u201d Ironshield\u2019s face turned ugly as he whispered her name. He asked coldly, \u201cI suppose I can take this as your declaration of war on the Iron Guild?\u201d\u201cHehe! Have we ever not been at war?\u201d asked the woman with a coy smile. At that moment, Gi-Gyu thought he saw the masked woman\u2019s eyes glow eerily.Without answering the woman\u2019s rhetorical question, Ironshield ordered, \u201cRogers, take David and this spy to the other guild members. I\u2019m sure Athena\u2019s guild is already attacking them.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, Sir,\u201d Rogers Han answered quickly, but the newbie player, David, shouted in panic, \u201cBut Guild Master!\u201dAnnoyed by the rookie, Rogers Han shouted at him, \u201cJust follow me, newbie! We won\u2019t be any use to the guild master here anyway!\u201dDavid seemed confused as he hesitantly looked around. But eventually, he turned around. After all, an order from the guild master was an absolute command. When Rogers chucked Gi-Gyu on his shoulder, Ironshield ordered, \u201cRogers, keep him alive!\u201d\u201cPardon? But\u2026\u201d Rogers wondered if it was smart to keep their hostage alive, especially after such horrid torture. He nodded to Ironshield; secretly, he shook his head.\u2018There\u2019s no merit in keeping him alive, so\u2026\u2019A guild master\u2019s order was akin to an imperial decree, but Rogers decided to go against it. Unfortunately for Gi-Gyu, he had seen Rogers\u2019 true nature. Rogers smiled sneakily and answered, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\u201cDammit!\u201d Gi-Gyu swore, but Rogers shut him up quickly.\u201cBe quiet.\u201dBoth Rogers and David turned around and ran toward their guild\u2019s group. Athena and Artemis didn\u2019t stop the two players from getting away. One murmured to the other, \u201cThey\u2019re gonna die anyway.\u201d\u201cYou mean you two will die at my hands?\u201d Ironshield asked the duo as he spun Calleon and slammed it into the ground. Suddenly, a gigantic steel shield emerged from the ground; it stood before Calleon and Ironshield, making them impervious to all frontal attacks.It was time for a battle.***\u201cDammit!\u201d Gi-Gyu swore again. He wanted to die right on the spot from shame and embarrassment. He was still alive due to Ironshield\u2019s change of mind. Now, Rogers was carrying Gi-Gyu on his back like a sack of potatoes. It seemed his pathetic life was going to continue for a little while longer.\u201cKeep quiet,\u201d Rogers muttered. As things stood, Gi-Gyu\u2019s life was in the hands of the man who tortured him. He now had absolutely no control over his body, and the feeling of helplessness made him want to sob.\u2018I\u2019m so powerless\u2026\u2019But Gi-Gyu had no one to blame but himself. He was a weak, unskilled player, yet he chose to enter the Maze of Heryond. Atop that, he decided to follow the infamous Iron Guild\u2014a huge mistake.Regret over his many, debatably-dumb, decisions wasn\u2019t the only emotion he was feeling: There was boiling fury too.\u2018I\u2019m\u00a0going to kill them all!\u2019\u201cHey, David. Go ahead and get ready for the battle. It looks like the fight has already begun. I\u2019ll treat this bastard first and follow you afterward,\u201d Rogers Han ordered.\u201cPardon? B-but the guild master as-asked us to jo-join the rest of the members imm-immediately,\u201d stammered David.\u201cHey, David. Look at this guy, hanging onto his life! He will die on the way if we don\u2019t treat his wounds. Would you like to be the one who tells the guild master if he dies?\u201d When Rogers Han asked sarcastically, the novice player stammered, \u201cA-all right.\u201dThen, David resumed running toward his guild\u2019s camp. Still a good distance from the camp, he could hear the sounds of weapons clashing, screams of pain, and shrieks of misery\u2014the whole shebang. And from the opposite direction, where Ironshield was facing those two women, Gi-Gyu could hear even louder explosions.Rrrrumble!Kaboom!The explosive sounds were something no humans should be able to create. It seemed like lightning was striking within the gate. With every loud blast, the ground shook as if the entire gate was about to crumble down.\u201cScary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s awestruck look, Rogers asked knowingly. Gi-Gyu almost nodded in agreement at his question. This definitely wasn\u2019t a fight between normal humans; it was a fight between high rankers.\u2018It sounds like the gods are fighting.\u2019Panting heavily, Gi-Gyu listened hard and tried to imagine the fight taking place. Unfortunately, it was impossible to picture it.Schwing!\u201cW-what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion when he saw Rogers unsheathing his sword.\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m gonna kill you now,\u201d replied Rogers as he showed off his white teeth.\u201cBut your guild master\u2026 Never mind. Just kill me.\u201dGi-Gyu was about to remind Rogers of Ironshield\u2019s order to keep him alive, but he stopped himself. He didn\u2019t want to survive by begging for his life at this point. Besides, the moment he got on Rogers\u2019 back, he knew what Rogers had in mind.The public saw Ironshield\u2019s guild as a righteous and exemplary group. If Gi-Gyu was left alive and the story of his torture got out, it would damage their stellar reputation. So, there was no way he was coming out of this encounter alive, with or without Ironshield\u2019s orders. It was such a selfish and hopeless idea that Gi-Gyu almost laughed.\u2018Rogers\u2026 is a man who likes to show off and obsessively keep his reputation clean. He is terrified of people discovering his true nature. And that\u2019s probably why he wants me dead.\u2019Gi-Gyu closed his eyes calmly as Rogers announced, \u201cI\u2019m just sorry I don\u2019t get to give you a painful death.\u201d Even now, Rogers was being a jerk. Before swinging his sword, Rogers asked, \u201cAny last words?\u201d\u201cAre any of your guild members nearby?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cWhy? You think they will save you from me?\u201d Rogers asked with a sneer. He thought Gi-Gyu was planning on begging the others to save him.Rogers shook his head with an ugly smile and began slowly plunging his sword into Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart. Through the unimaginable pain, Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cPerfect.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen the tip of Rogers\u2019 sword was just an inch away from Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart, Gi-Gyu glared at Rogers and shouted, \u201cReflect!\u201dIn the past few days, he was subjected to an array of torture techniques, of which Brunheart used that opportunity to accumulate all the damage Gi-Gyu received. The recent increase in his assimilation level helped greatly in this endeavor. Gi-Gyu has been waiting for the perfect chance to use Brunheart\u2019s reflection skill. He had planned on using it when Ironshield was about to behead him, but an even better opportunity came by. Gi-Gyu had no intention of losing this perfect chance.[Brunheart\u2019s damage accumulation limit has exceeded.][Reflection skill has been activated.][Brunheart will perish now.]A loud explosion flared between the two players. It was such an incredible explosion that it was hard to believe Gi-Gyu was behind it.\u201cAckkkk!\u201d Rogers\u2019 scream could be heard from the thick smoke. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu felt a sudden wave of helplessness spread throughout his body. It was as if his very soul was being sucked out. But, this didn\u2019t come as a surprise. His stats took a nosedive after he was distanced from his Egos; now, his last Ego, Brunheart, had perished, so Gi-Gyu had no strength left.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu panted loudly.\u201cB\u2026bastard!\u201d Rogers screamed in both pain and anger. As the smoke began to clear slowly, two players appeared on the ground. One was Gi-Gyu, who was leaning against a wall, panting loudly. The other was Rogers, whose entire face and body were severely burnt. He was wailing as he lay atop Gi-Gyu\u2019s legs.Even Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t come out of this explosion unscathed, but Rogers, definitely, took the greater hit.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned as he barely managed to stand up. His legs refused to cooperate; somehow, he pushed Rogers away. Rogers continued to flail and scream in pain as he collapsed.Limp, limp\u2026Gi-Gyu staggered badly as he approached Rogers. Then, Gi-Gyu picked up Rogers\u2019 sword that was lying nearby.\u2018My current strength is similar to what I had before I got Lou. I may be weak now, but I\u2019ve lived my whole life like this.\u2019Although he was weaker than ever right now, Gi-Gyu still remembered living with this helpless body when he worked as a guide. He killed goblins with that strength, so how hard could this be?Gi-Gyu raised the sword with both of his hands and sat on Rogers\u2019 stomach.\u201cB-bastard! Don\u2019t!\u201dStab!Rogers\u2019 own sword jutted out of his neck. Brunheart\u2019s accumulated damage must\u2019ve been massive because Rogers couldn\u2019t even resist. A Level 1 player had made sure he would reach the gates of hell safely.Plop!Gi-Gyu collapsed on the ground, unable to endure the disappointment that filled his body. Right now, he couldn\u2019t even move his finger. He still had Arachne\u2019s Ball of Thread, but he didn\u2019t have the strength to reach for it. Besides, without Lou, El, and the elixir, returning home was pointless. Even if he survived and returned home, he would lose his mother soon; then, he would live the rest of his life as a feeble player.\u201cLou\u2026 El\u2026\u201dThe first thing Gi-Gyu needed to do was retrieve Lou and El, but he was exhausted.\u201cElixir\u2026\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu as he remembered the second thing he had to obtain. After all, he came inside this gate to save his mother. But, all he wanted to do now was sleep. His eyes closed slowly as he muttered to himself, \u201cI finally figured out\u2026 where the gatekeeper\u2026 is now too, yet\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m going to\u2026 kill\u2026 you,\u201d Beside Gi-Gyu, Rogers whispered.Pfft!Gi-Gyu knew he was about to die, but there was at least one consolation. It was the fact that Rogers lay beside him, choking on his own blood as he cursed Gi-Gyu. The pain Rogers was feeling right now couldn\u2019t even be half of what Gi-Gyu had endured over the past few days. But, Gi-Gyu was just satisfied he could kill a powerful player, someone who was almost a ranker.And just like that, Gi-Gyu closed his eyes.\u201cOppa!\u201d Gi-Gyu heard a familiar voice calling out to him.\u201cY-Yoo-Jung?\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered his sister\u2019s name. Was he hallucinating?\u201cWhat are you talking about?! Oppa, are you okay?\u201dGi-Gyu at first thought he was hearing Yoo-Jung\u2019s voice; when he opened his eyes, it was Soo-Jung who was crouching in front of him. She was smiling brightly at him.\u201cSoo-Jung?\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s blood had clotted and stuck his lips together. Soo-Jung\u2019s smile grew wider as she stopped him by placing her finger on his lips. She asked him teasingly, \u201cIf I save you and even get you the elixir, what will you give me?\u201d\u201c...?\u201d\u201cCan you give me your life, Oppa? Can you live as my slave until the day you die? Do you think you can do that?\u201d asked Soo-Jung as her eyes glowed eerily. Gi-Gyu had always thought her violet eyes were beautiful; now, he realized they resembled those of the grim reaper.When Soo-Jung removed her finger from his lips, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hesitate for long and made his lips rip the scab.\u201cOne\u2026 more thing.\u201d\u201cHmm? You\u2019re so funny, Oppa. All right, what is it?\u201d\u201cHelp me kill Ironshield\u2026 and destroy the Iron Guild.\u201d Gi-Gyu barely managed to whisper his requests.\u201cWhat?\u201d Soo-Jung giggled and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s two things! Well, I suppose it will depend on how well you do. Then we have an agreement?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026 swords\u2026 The white-haired middle-aged man took them\u2026 Then, yes, we\u2026 have a deal\u2014\u201d Gi-Gyu fainted before he could finish his sentence. Soo-Jung laughed and murmured, \u201cJust how many conditions are you placing on this contract?\u201dSuddenly, the man with the glasses appeared from the dark and suggested, \u201cI agree. This man is very interesting.\u201d\u201cRight? He was even more amusing when I watched him up close. He is evil by nature, but someone suppressed it for some reason. Did you see when he killed that idiot? It was probably his first murder, but he stabbed the vital spot perfectly. No hesitation, no anger, and no guilt. He was perfectly cold and objective,\u201d said Soo-Jung, no Lucifer, with excitement as she pointed at Rogers, who was still choking on his blood.The bespectacled man asked blankly, \u201cThat Iron Guild member Rogers\u2026 Don\u2019t you think he\u2019ll live if we leave him like this?\u201d\u201cHmm, probably, right?\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t survive such an extensive injury, but powerful players like Rogers had an incredible regeneration capacity. Much of the bleeding had already stopped, and even the hole in his neck was closing slowly.The glassed man asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWhy bother asking me? If he survives, then that will be his fate. Do you think Gi-Gyu will like it if I killed that bastard for him? I\u2019ll bet Gi-Gyu will choose to kill Rogers himself,\u201d replied Soo-Jung as she looked away from Rogers. She continued with a smile, \u201cThanks to everything that happened, I found out where the keeper of this maze is. I had lots of fun, and profited quite a bit too. It was also unexpected to see Ironshield battling Athena so suddenly. This guy is so much fun\u2026\u201dWhen Soo-Jung stood up, she slowly began to grow. The change in her appearance was subtle yet shocking. Her violet eyes turned jet black, while her black hair turned violet. The woman that stood in Soo-Jung\u2019s place resembled the beautiful little girl from a moment ago, but she was also a completely different person.The man in glasses smiled and teased, \u201cSo is this the arrival of Lucifer?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Soo-Jung, no Lucifer, flinched and replied, \u201cLucifer is a stupid nickname because I\u2019m going to be the one who kills the real devil.\u201dThen, Soo-Jung stretched her arms leisurely.The\u00a0most vicious\u00a0high ranker had finally arrived in the worst maze of all time.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28. Lucifer\u2019s arrival (2)\u2018I feel dizzy.\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s head spun, and his vision was blurry. His consciousness cleared a while later, and he weakly opened his eyes. As his vision returned, he discovered someone was cradling him. Then, an abrupt stream of screams slammed\u00a0into\u00a0his ears.\u201cAckkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d\u201cLucifer\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cWhere is our guild master?!\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu managed to look around, he saw a black flame engulfing the screaming players.\u2018Iron Guild? Then where are the other players\u2026?\u2019To his shock, a giant black flame was sweeping through the Iron Guild members and various other random players. Nothing that stood in its way came out alive.\u2018Black flame!\u2019This was Lucifer's signature move. When she became a high ranker, she obtained her own unique ability, this black flame. And this flame was also why she got the moniker Lucifer.'I knew Marking wasn\u2019t her unique ability.\u2019While being tortured by Ironshield, Gi-Gyu deduced Soo-Jung was Lucifer. Ironshield\u2019s description of Lucifer wasn\u2019t exactly the same, but he got a strong feeling that Ironshield was talking about the young girl he was traveling with. Add to that suspicion, all the things that made no sense about Soo-Jung, and you would get Lucifer.So first, Lucifer toyed with Gi-Gyu; then, he got himself captured by another high ranker. But, he didn\u2019t resent Lucifer one bit for it. She was probably just amusing herself by following him around; she didn\u2019t cause him any direct harm. Ironshield and his guild, on the other hand, had physically hurt him\u2026 very badly.It might be nothing, but maybe a part of why he didn\u2019t detest Lucifer was that she resembled Yoo-Jung.\u201cAre you awake? You should\u2019ve slept a bit longer,\u201d said the purple-haired woman standing in front of him. Even though her lips held a gentle smile, the menacing black flames in her hands sent some mixed signals. Her hair danced beautifully as she suggested, \u201cTake a good look. You made a deal with me, so I\u2019m showing you what kind of power I hold.\u201dGi-Gyu asked in a clear voice, \u201cBut this was what we agreed on, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI wanted to do it alone. Destroy the Iron Guild, that is. The life of every Iron Guild member, including the ones inside this maze, belongs to me,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced without fear.\u201cWhat?\u201d Soo-Jung\u2019s eyes crumpled unhappily, but a smile spread on her lips within seconds. She agreed, \u201cYes, indeed. All right.\u201dThe black flames whirling around them subsided slowly; then, they began targeting only the players who didn\u2019t belong to the Iron Guild. But this didn\u2019t mean the Iron Guild members were spared. A majority was already on the ground, dead or close to it. The remaining were either missing some limbs or collapsed on the ground with foam escaping their mouths.Soo-Jung, or Lucifer, walked a few steps forward and stood before a man. Gi-Gyu realized it was the middle-aged man with a white beard. She seized the swords from this player\u2019s waist and announced, \u201cThis fulfills one of the conditions on our contract!\u201dGi-Gyu saw that she was smiling while holding Lou and El. Before he could react to what was happening, Gi-Gyu fainted again.***-Wake up.-Please wake up, Master.When Gi-Gyu heard his Egos' voices tickling his ears, he opened his eyes again.[Strong will has been activated.][Strong will has been activated.][Strong will has been activated.]When his mind cleared a bit, it was flooded by a ton of system announcements; soon, he felt energy coursing through him.\u201cLou? El?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in confusion.-Don\u2019t push yourself. Just look ahead; it will help you.-That woman is dangerous, Master.\u201cAre you awake? That\u2019s strange. You were barely breathing just a moment ago,\u201d said a man when he noticed Gi-Gyu had opened his eyes.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. Actually, there was no need for that question: Gi-Gyu knew who he was. The man in the glasses was the one who was carrying him earlier. Gi-Gyu\u2019s vision cleared slowly, allowing him to see his surroundings better. When he saw what stood not too far from him, he whispered, \u201cOh my god.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the corps commander. Is this your first time seeing one?\u201d the bespectacled man asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s a corps commander?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked in awe, the glassed man answered with a blank face, \u201cIt\u2019s Heryond, of course. He\u2019s the master of this maze.\u201dGi-Gyu slowly looked around to see a giant mountain in front of him. Although it was impossibly big, its form resembled that of a human. It was wearing black thorn-covered armor and a helmet with six horns. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s the keeper of this maze?!\u201d\u201cWell, I guess you could say that,\u201d the glassed man replied with a shrug.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his embarrassment as he gaped at the monster. After looking at the gatekeeper, he realized how arrogant and cocksure his pre-torture self was. Back then, he really believed he could defeat this monster.Beside the keeper was a tiny woman: Soo-Jung. She winked at Gi-Gyu and announced, \u201cI hope you enjoy the show!\u201dAnd just like that, the battle began. The man wearing glasses dropped something on the ground, creating a translucent circle. He ordered Gi-Gyu quietly, \u201cYou should come inside. You might get killed if you get too close.\u201d\u201cIs this a barrier?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re more knowledgeable than I thought,\u201d the man replied with a nod. This was no ordinary barrier: It looked like it was created using a unique mixture of various players\u2019 skills. But because Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know much about barriers in general, he couldn\u2019t tell for sure.Still, Gi-Gyu entered the circle without protest.Boom! Boom! Boom!As soon as he entered the barrier, Soo-Jung took to the sky and slammed into the keeper, making the entire area around Gi-Gyu shake. The black flames Soo-Jung shot from her hands grew exponentially and covered the keeper like bacteria. Screaming in pain, the monster tried to push Soo-Jung away.Suddenly, a black hole appeared in the sky. Gi-Gyu whispered, \u201cA black gate?\u201dUnfortunately, the man wearing glasses had stopped answering Gi-Gyu\u2019s questions. Instead, he watched the battle with a blank face as if he was bored. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s shock, countless monsters emerged from the black gate and began attacking Soo-Jung.\u201cHup!\u201d Soo-Jung exhaled lightly, making the surrounding air burn. Slowly, a black flame appeared around her and seemingly began burning down the sky. Then, a giant sword with a muted color arose from the black flames. It was much bigger than the giant keeper; slowly, it fell to the ground as it split the world into two.\u2018She must be a god\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu found her power godly.***-I can't believe you actually managed to get it.-Umm, congratulations\u2026 Master.Lou and El didn\u2019t sound happy as Gi-Gyu held a box made of diamonds.\u00a0The box alone had to be worth a fortune, but the content inside was what would save his mother.Her purple hair dancing around her face, Soo-Jung announced, \u201cSo that\u2019s the last of my part of the bargain. I understand you want to kill Ironshield and destroy his guild, but it sounds like you don\u2019t want me to help you.\u201dGi-Gyu asked cautiously, \u201cIs your name really Soo-Jung?\u201d\u201cYup. My name is Jung Soo-Jung, and I\u2019m really Korean too.\u201d When Soo-Jung replied, Gi-Gyu nodded. After Lucifer destroyed the gatekeeper Heryond, Gi-Gyu, the man in glasses, and Lucifer were transferred to the rewards chamber. Since he didn\u2019t participate in the battle, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t obtain any experience points. But because he was present at the scene when the keeper died, he could follow Soo-Jung to this chamber.The rewards were in two separate boxes: one gold and one diamond.Soo-Jung suggested, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you open it and check?\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu with respect. He no longer treated Soo-Jung like an ordinary girl. Partly because she was no longer in her girly form, but it was mostly because she was a high ranker who could easily kill him with her pinky.Gi-Gyu slowly opened the diamond box and found a glass jar filled with purple liquid. Soo-Jung murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the elixir.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu had mixed feelings. He walked into the Maze of Heryond, fully prepared to die. His determination to obtain what he was seeking was sky-high; honestly, he didn\u2019t really expect to get the elixir. It was a suicide attempt by a desperate man who was pushed into a corner by his circumstance. And what happened, in the end, was something no one could have imagined.A high ranker almost killed him, but another just handed him the elixir. Although he was happy to have gotten what he came for, he couldn\u2019t help feeling useless because this wasn\u2019t his achievement.\u201cOur rewards are two bottles of the elixir. So here,\u201d said Soo-Jung as she handed one of the bottles to Gi-Gyu.\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThis is a gift from me to celebrate our new contract. Drink up. I detest weak men, so you need this. We were here for the corps commander anyway, not the elixir. These bottles are a bonus we don\u2019t need, so feel free to take one more.\u201dGi-Gyu gaped at Soo-Jung\u2019s playful explanation. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. Did she have any idea what a bottle of elixir was worth? Did she know what the elixir could do for a player\u2019s body?Of course, she did. After all, she was the famous Lucifer.Gi-Gyu's hand trembled as he took the bottle. Soo-Jung continued, \u201cYour body has been damaged beyond repair now. A player is still only human, so there are things even potions can\u2019t heal. This elixir will regenerate your body, so you can start with a better \u2018shell.\u2019 In fact, you\u2019ll end up with an even better body than before. It will even improve your abilities, and your stat will increase faster with each level-up. You will be on your way to becoming a high ranker.\u201dWell, his stats wouldn\u2019t increase, as he was the player who couldn\u2019t level up.\u2018No, wait.\u2019\u2018If I drink this, will I be able to level up?\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands trembled in anticipation. His hands shook so badly that he almost dropped the bottle. Trying his best to keep his voice calm, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat is it you want from me? It doesn\u2019t look like you want to kill me, so do you really want me to become your slave forever? Is that what you really want?\u201dShe wanted him to drink the elixir, which meant she didn\u2019t want to kill him. Besides, what would she gain from killing him anyway?Soo-Jung smiled and replied, \u201cWell\u2026 That\u2019s not exactly true. I just like you, that\u2019s all.\u201dWith a quiet laugh, she ordered him, \u201cBe my pupil.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too useless right now, so don\u2019t bother coming to me in your current state. But when you reach the 50th floor, find me. I\u2019ll teach you how to become stronger. And if you die before then, well, I guess that\u2019s that.\u201dGi-Gyu thought quietly for a moment. After organizing his thoughts, he asked his final question, \u201cAre you\u2026 the devil?\u201d It was a cautious and serious question, but it only made Soo-Jung laugh. She turned toward the man in glasses and murmured, \u201cHe\u2019s so funny, isn\u2019t he? Don\u2019t you agree, Baal?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe man in glasses, Baal, didn\u2019t answer her. Soo-Jung ignored her companion and asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cAnd you know the devil?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it\u2026 Just once. It was giant, and it had blood-red eyes.\u201d\u201cOhh\u2026\u201d exclaimed Soo-Jung as if she was impressed.\u201cHe resembled the corps commander,\u201d Gi-Gyu added.The smile on Soo-Jung\u2019s face gradually disappeared as she explained, \u201cGuess you met a pretty big monster, huh? This is why I\u2019m so interested in you. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not the devil. I am called Lucifer, but I have nothing to do with the devil.\u201dSoo-Jung suddenly placed her hand on Gi-Gyu\u2019s head, but he didn\u2019t flinch away. Soo-Jung continued, \u201cI\u2019m more like someone hunting the devil. I\u2019ll tell you more about it when you become my pupil. Oh, and this is a gift for you.\u201dA shocking sensation traveled from her hand to his head. It moved down and soon reached his right eye. It seemed this woman liked to give gifts. Gi-Gyu was surprised at how generous the infamous Lucifer was.\u201cThis is a token of our contract and a way to communicate with me. For now, it won\u2019t have any functions; once you become stronger and wiser, you\u2019ll learn more about it. After all, one can only see what one knows. So work hard, my future pupil.\u201dAs Soo-Jung finished speaking, Gi-Gyu felt his right eye burn a little. He laughed and drank the purple elixir in a single gulp.[Your\u00a0shell\u00a0is being regenerated.]With the system\u2019s announcement, Gi-Gyu found his consciousness slowly fading; then, he heard Soo-Jung\u2019s voice again.\u201cOh, there is one more thing you need to take.\u201dHis eyes widened as she continued, \u201cI noticed that your swords are unique. I\u2019ll teach you how to make one of them much stronger. Well, you might die from it, but it\u2019s okay, right?\u201dNod.With that small nod, Gi-Gyu fainted again. He couldn\u2019t remember how many times he had lost his consciousness inside this maze. Being so fragile was embarrassing, but then there was his amazing luck. I mean, who would ever encounter two high rankers in a single gate?***\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, Lucifer.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu had no idea this was what Soo-Jung meant by making Lou and El stronger.-This is crazy.-M-Master, I told you she\u2019s dangerous\u2026\u201dFollowing his Egos warnings, Soo-Jung said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cYou remember what I taught you? Just do that.\u201dIronshield, covered in blood and holding a silver-haired woman in one hand, was standing in front of Gi-Gyu. Soo-Jung explained to Gi-Gyu earlier that when someone powerful like her cleared the gate, they could keep the gate standing for a while longer even after claiming the rewards. Typically, a one-shot gate perished soon after being cleared.Ironshield roared at Lucifer, \u201cHow dare you steal my prey?\u201d\u201cHow is he your prey?\u201d Lucifer argued back in annoyance. The two high rankers were bickering, but all Gi-Gyu could focus on was the blood-covered Ironshield. He felt confused and embarrassed at first; then, his fury engulfed him. Gi-Gyu knew Ironshield wasn\u2019t an evil man, but he was still the culprit who tortured him. Without a word, Gi-Gyu took a step toward Ironshield.\u201cYou have changed\u2026\u201d Ironshield muttered when he saw Gi-Gyu. He continued with a frown, \u201cAre you Lucifer\u2019s minion now? Or have you always belonged to her? Haa, this is going to be so annoying.\u201dDealing with Lucifer and her four-eyed follower was already annoying enough. And now, it seemed Lucifer got herself another capable lackey. Ironshield knew Gi-Gyu was still no match for him, but there was no way of knowing what kind of power he gained by becoming Lucifer\u2019s minion.Gi-Gyu gritted his teeth and said to him, \u201cLet\u2019s fight.\u201d He gripped Lou and El hard and lowered his body in preparation. However, Ironshield didn\u2019t understand Korean, so he just looked at Gi-Gyu in confusion.\u201cWhat?\u201dMustering all the English words he could remember, Gi-Gyu yelled, \u201cDie. Die. You die!\u201d He was trying to rile up Ironshield, and it worked. Ironshield\u2019s face crumpled in anger as he raised Calleon, rooted in the ground. He murmured, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but\u2026 It\u2019s sad to see you wasting your life away when I allowed you to live.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what the heck you\u2019re talking about, but you die! You die! You will soon die!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled in Korean as he kicked the ground to run toward his opponent. Ironshield, his face devoid of emotion, brandished Calleon. When El and Calleon struck each other, the system announced.[Holy sword has awakened El\u2019s special ability.][El is absorbing holy sword Calleon\u2019s ability.][Only a small part of Calleon\u2019s ability will be absorbed because of the user\u2019s low level.][Absorption has been completed.]\u201cW-what?\u201d Ironshield\u2019s confused gasp echoed throughout. Taking this as his chance to escape, Gi-Gyu took a few steps back. Meanwhile, one of Ironshield\u2019s knees buckled due to sudden weakness.Gi-Gyu quickly bowed to Soo-Jung and said his farewell, \u201cThen I will see you later.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dGi-Gyu took out Arachne's Ball of Thread and activated it without hesitation. His journey inside the Maze of Heryond was finally over. He expected the gate to perish shortly.With a playful smile, Soo-Jung asked, \u201cShall we talk now, Ironshield?\u201d\u201cDammit,\u201d Ironshield swore as he bit his lips.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29. ElixirThanks to Lucifer, or Soo-Jung, the Gate of Heryond was cleared. Usually, the media would go wild when a new gate was cleared. Gi-Gyu wanted to avoid such noise and attention; luckily, everything worked out for him. The gate perished a day after being cleared due to Soo-Jung\u2019s interference, so Gi-Gyu used that extra day to contact the association\u2019s Korean branch. Thus, he returned to Korea before the news hit.As soon as Gi-Gyu reached Korea, he wanted to meet Tae-Shik. But it seemed Tae-Shik was away on a business trip per the association president\u2019s order. Because Tae-Shik went inside the Tower, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t even contact him. So, after leaving a message for Tae-Shik, Gi-Gyu went straight to the hospital.Yoo-Jung was still at school, so Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t see her when he reached his mother\u2019s room. Given Yoo-Jung\u2019s personality, she would\u2019ve\u00a0definitely\u00a0skipped school to care for their mother. But, it seemed their mother had someone forced her into going to school.His mother\u2019s condition had worsened in the span Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t here. When Gi-Gyu asked the doctor about it, he replied that it was a miracle she was still alive.\u2018Thank goodness, I\u2019m\u00a0not too late.\u2019After telling the doctor his mother wanted to spend her final days at home, Gi-Gyu got her discharged from the hospital. The hospital staff was concerned, worried that her condition would worsen even more if she\u00a0wasn't\u00a0under a doctor's care. However, Gi-Gyu was firm on his decision.His mother whispered\u00a0weakly\u00a0when they arrived home, \u201cS\u2026on?\u201d\u201cMother, are you alright?\u201dThanks to the Protection Talisman and the great potion Gi-Gyu purchased, his mother\u2019s condition remained stable for a while. However, he knew even then that these items were far from an actual cure. The great potion cost him hundreds of millions of won, but all it could do was relieve her symptoms temporarily.Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother cried as she murmured, \u201cS\u2026on\u2026 I missed you\u2026\u201dShe had never complained about Gi-Gyu's rare visits, but there was no doubt she missed him terribly. Aware that she wasn\u2019t long for this world, she finally\u00a0began telling\u00a0him what she had been thinking.\u201cI had wished\u2026 to see you one more time before I died\u2026 So thank you for coming.\u201d\u201cMother, please don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re going to get better now,\u201d Gi-Gyu reassured her as he wiped her tears with his sleeve. However, she probably thought he was just trying to make her feel better, as she continued, \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something I have been wanting to tell you. The truth is\u2026 Son\u2026\u201dShiver\u2026She couldn\u2019t finish her sentence, as she began experiencing a seizure. Gi-Gyu opened the bottle and began to slowly drip it down into his mother\u2019s mouth. The magical purple potion entered her body drop by drop until the bottle became empty. Finally, the worries he had while he was making his way home had faded away.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed in relief.Suddenly, her body began glowing with bright light, and she gently rose into the air. The same thing happened when Gi-Gyu drank the elixir, so he sat down and watched without panicking.Now, there was nothing else he could do but wait. He had done everything he could possibly do for his mother.-Congrats, Master.-Master, congratulations.\u201cNot yet\u2026 I have to wait and see how she reacts to it,\u201d Gi-Gyu mumbled. Although he had high hopes, he still couldn\u2019t relax completely, since his mother wasn\u2019t a player. The elixir was known to work on everyone, but that assumption was based on the very few times an elixir appeared. There was no way of knowing if there were any side effects associated with it.When his mother began to emit even brighter light, Gi-Gyu closed all the curtains and watched patiently. After floating in the air for a while, her condition began to change visibly. Her muscles reimagined their mass, her wrinkles disappeared, and her face regained its color. Soon, her transformation was over.\u201cIt\u2019s a success,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. His mother was no longer glowing, so he carefully lay her down on the blanket. Finally, everything he set out to do was done.Gi-Gyu grabbed his phone, which had been charging, and texted Yoo-Jung.-Come home.When he finally relaxed, his days of fatigue suddenly engulfed him. Gi-Gyu lay down on the floor and fell into a deep sleep. So many incredible things had happened in a single trip that it was no wonder he collapsed.-Thank goodness.-I\u2019m so worried about him\u2026 Master is getting closer to that woman. I don\u2019t like it.-There is nothing we can do about it.Lou sounded sad for some reason. He muttered,-After all, everything is happening as it should.-As it should\u2026***\u201cOppa! Do you have any idea\u00a0about mom\u2019s current condition? You haven\u2019t been home in over a month. Mom suffered so much. And now that you\u2019re back, you just say two words: Come home? You need to get to the hospital right now to see\u2026\u201dYoo-Jung yelled as she burst into their home. But she couldn\u2019t finish her sentence, as she saw an unfamiliar-but-beautiful woman standing in the kitchen.\u201cWho? Umm\u2026 Mom?\u201d Yoo-Jung murmured in shock.\u201cYoo-Jung, is that you?\u201d\u201cMom\u2026? Is that you, Mom?\u201d Yoo-Jung whispered when she recognized the woman\u2019s voice. Mother to Yoo-Jung and Gi-Gyu, the woman was as healthy as the day she was born. Unable to believe her eyes, Yoo-Jung kept blinking her eyes. In the living room, she vaguely noticed Gi-Gyu sleeping on the floor.Yoo-Jung asked in confusion, \u201cWhat happened? It\u2019s you, right, Mom? You\u2019re my mom, right?\u201d\u201cOf course I am. Your brother is sleeping, so maybe we should talk later, okay?\u201d Yoo-Jung\u2019s mom, Lee Su-Jin, replied with a motherly smile. Her smile was beautiful and warm enough to melt the winter day\u2019s ice.Sob.\u201cMommmmmmmmmmm!\u201d Yoo-Jung cried out as she hugged Su-Jin.\u201cWe should keep quiet since your brother is\u00a0sleeping\u2026\u201d Su-Jin murmured, but there were tears in her eyes too when she hugged her daughter. Their embrace lasted a while before they began making dinner together. As they cooked, the chatter in the kitchen didn\u2019t stop for a second.Both Yoo-Jung and Su-Jin couldn\u2019t stop smiling. They were worried their voices might wake Gi-Gyu\u00a0up, but his fatigue made sure he was out cold. If not for his loud snores, Yoo-Jung would\u2019ve conceded he was dead.And soon, the dinner was ready. Su-Jin made a meal for her son, who miraculously saved her life.***Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t tell how long he was out for, but he felt like he had a long dream. Although he couldn\u2019t remember it, he felt certain it was a good dream. It had been such a long time since he felt this refreshed.Gi-Gyu hadn't felt this good ever since his father passed away and his mother fell ill. Maybe all the hardships his family had to suffer through had a hand in that.\u201cIt looks delicious, Mom!\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cIt totally does! Thanks, Mom!\u201d Yoo-Jung agreed enthusiastically.\u201cEat up, my beautiful son and daughter!\u201dIt had been such a long time since their mother last cooked for them that Gi-Gyu and Yoo-Jung jumped to pick up their spoons. Thankfully, Gi-Gyu\u2019s family didn\u2019t cry at the dinner table\u2026 because they had already cried their hearts out when Gi-Gyu woke up.After taking a bite of the fried egg, Yoo-Jung replied playfully, \u201cMom! That\u2019s not fair! It should be the beautiful daughter first and then son!\u201dThey all ate happily amid Yoo-Jung\u2019s occasional exclaims. \u201cSo delicious!\u201d Because her mouth was full of food, Yoo-Jung couldn\u2019t even speak properly. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu ate his eggs and seaweed soup silently.The joy and peace he felt were long overdue. He had been dreaming of this moment for a very long time. After the meal, Gi-Gyu volunteered to do the dishes. Su-Jin and Yoo-Jung insisted they could do it, but\u00a0they\u00a0couldn\u2019t stop him.While washing the dishes with rubber gloves and an apron on, he asked, \u201cMother, does your body feel okay? Does anything feel strange?\u201d\u201cNo. In fact, I\u2019m so full of energy that it\u2019s almost strange. Now, tell me, Gi-Gyu, what happened? How did you do this?\u201d Su-Jin asked.Suddenly, Yoo-Jung interrupted and demanded an answer from her brother too.\u201cOppa, could it be that you really got the elixir?\u201dGi-Gyu just smiled, and the two women didn\u2019t prod him further. He explained, \u201cI wish I could take you back to the hospital and get you checked out. It would be great to make sure you\u2019re really okay, but I think it\u2019s best if you stay out of other people\u2019s eyes for a while.\u201dSu-Jin nodded in understanding. If the others found out about the miracle she experienced, her whole family would receive unwanted attention from the world.Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cWhen Tae-Shik hyung gets back, we\u2019ll get you examined. So, please, be patient till then.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing for me to be patient about, Gi-Gyu. I\u2019m just happy I get to eat this delicious meal with my son and daughter. That\u2019s all I ever wanted; this is more than enough for me,\u201d Su-Jin replied, making him smile.\u201cSon\u2026\u201d When his mother murmured, her eyes again filling with tears, Gi-Gyu shook his head. He said to her teasingly, \u201cAh! Mother! If you start crying again, your son is going to leave!\u201d\u201cI just wanted to say thank you.\u201d Despite Gi-Gyu\u2019s warning, his mother couldn\u2019t stop herself from crying. Although she never showed it, Su-Jin had suffered for an excruciatingly long time. Of course, it was the same for Yoo-Jung and Gi-Gyu as well.Su-Jin watched Gi-Gyu\u2019s broad back sadly. Her children, still so young, had to mature out of their age. It was because of the difficulties they had to endure for such a long time. Su-Jin thought to herself sadly,\u2018Even if it were just a for an extra moment\u2026 I wish they could have had a happier childhood.\u2019Gi-Gyu had given up everything for his family without once acting childish. Su-Jin murmured to her son, \u201cFrom now on, please stop worrying about me and live your life,\u00a0Son.\u201dTrying his best to hide his tears, Gi-Gyu continued to wash the dishes silently.***\u201cBastard. I can\u2019t believe you really did it.\u201d Tae-Shik\u2019s face was filled with bliss, but his words didn\u2019t match his expression. He continued, \u201cJust how did you do it? You have no idea what is happening over there in the US, do you? After the Heryond\u2026 No, this isn\u2019t the time to talk about this. Gotta take you to a quiet place, so we can talk privately.\u201dThe moment Tae-Shik returned from his business trip, he came to Gi-Gyu. Tae-Shik wanted to know what happened at the maze, so Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cThen let\u2019s go talk at home.\u201d\u201cYou mean your home?\u201d\u201cYes, Mother is so grateful for all that you\u2019ve done for her. She has been hoping to invite you for dinner,\u201d explained Gi-Gyu.\u201cHmm.\u201dTae-Shik took out his phone and made a quick call. He said to someone on the phone, \u201cTell that old man I\u2019ll go see him tomorrow. Just tell him I need to take care of something related to Heryond. He\u2019ll understand.\u201dWithout waiting for an answer from the person on the other end, Tae-Shik hung up. With Gi-Gyu in the passenger seat, Tae-Shik began driving his beloved pink Tico to Gi-Gyu\u2019s house.Since Gi-Gyu had called ahead, Su-Jin was busy preparing dinner for her guest. As Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik walked up to the rooftop, they could already smell the delicious aroma wafting from Gi-Gyu\u2019s home. Tae-Shik suddenly stopped on the stairs and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cIs this the aroma of your mother\u2019s cooking?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI had no idea she was such a great cook. Let\u2019s hurry up. I ate jerky and packaged food in the Tower for so long that I could feel my taste buds dying. Also, I\u2019m starving.\u201d Tae-Shik\u2019s business trip took place inside the Tower, so it seemed he hadn\u2019t had a decent meal in a long time.Opening the front door, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI\u2019m home, Mother. I brought Tae-Shik hyung with me.\u201d\u201cWelcome! You\u2019re right on time. Dinner is ready,\u201d Su-Jin greeted both men with a bright smile.\u201cLet\u2019s get inside, Hyung,\u201d said Gi-Gyu as he took his shoes off. But for some reason, Tae-Shik remained in the entrance, looking dazed.Gi-Gyu said to Tae-Shik in confusion, \u201cHyung, what are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you coming inside?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Huh? Oh! I\u2019m coming! I\u2019m here! Thank you!\u201d Tae-Shik hurriedly took his shoes off and walked inside. After taking their coats off, Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik sat down at the table as Su-Jin prepared their meal.Tae-Shik ate awkwardly, and Gi-Gyu watched him with a grin. Sitting across from them, Su-Jin thanked Tae-Shik with a deep bow, \u201cI am so grateful for all you\u2019ve done. Our family owes you a great debt.\u201d\u201cN-not at all! I was happy to do it. I\u2019m just so relieved and thankful that you have recovered,\u201d Tae-Shik murmured clumsily, making Su-Jin laugh. With a small nod, she replied, \u201cYou probably want to talk with Gi-Gyu privately, so I\u2019ll leave you to it. I hope I get to treat you to a proper meal next time. I haven\u2019t been able to go out, so I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t get to prepare anything decent for you.\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s not true! It\u2026 it was really delicious! This was the best meal I have ever had in my life!\u201d Tae-Shik shouted; when he noticed Gi-Gyu laughing at him, he blushed.Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother brought them some hot tea and then left to give them some privacy. She wanted Tae-Shik to feel comfortable talking with Gi-Gyu. When she was out of sight, Tae-Shik took something out from his pocket and placed it on the table.It was his barrier item.\u201cI think your mother will feel hurt if she\u00a0heard\u00a0what we\u2019re about to discuss. It would be best if she didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d Tae-Shik explained, and Gi-Gyu nodded in understanding. Gi-Gyu felt thankful Tae-Shik was being so considerate. After all, it was true. Su-Jin would\u2019ve felt guilty if she had heard what had happened to Gi-Gyu. They were about to talk about Gi-Gyu\u2019s suicide mission, which he barely survived.Gi-Gyu decided to tell Tae-Shik everything, including how he met Ironshield and his guild and how they tortured him. Gi-Gyu also needed Tae-Shik to know about Athena and Artemis\u2019 attack, the true identity of Lucifer, the corps commander, and the elixir.Everything that happened in the maze was important, and Gi-Gyu had to explain how he barely survived each event that could\u2019ve easily led to his death. But before discussing all of these major events, Gi-Gyu had something he had to ask Tae-Shik first.\u201cHyung, do you like my mom?\u201dFwah!Surprised by such a blunt question, Tae-Shik coughed and spat out his tea.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30. Elixir (2)Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik\u2019s conversation continued for a long time. As Tae-Shik listened attentively, he frowned anxiously at times; at others, he looked at Gi-Gyu with obvious pride. When Gi-Gyu told him about what happened with Ironshield, Tae-Shik became furious.Mentally replacing Gi-Gyu for himself, Tae-Shik felt as if he was tortured for days and swore, \u201cThose bastards!\u201dGi-Gyu smiled bitterly, feeling grateful for Tae-Shik\u2019s empathy.\u2018I\u2019m so thankful hyung is here for me.\u2019Tae-Shik asked, \u201cSo Rogers Han did that? Toffee-nosed bastard! But, are you sure he\u2019s really dead?\u201d\u201cWell, I stabbed his neck, so I think so,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu with a shrug.\u201cHe\u2019s a member of the Iron Guild, so you never know. There is still a chance he might be alive. I\u2019ll look into it, so don\u2019t worry too much about it. Anyway, about what happened\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik couldn\u2019t finish his sentence as he hesitated. Gi-Gyu had just told him he killed a man. Now, any other normal human would\u2019ve freaked out or even ran out straight away. Not Tae-Shik, though. He was actually more worried that the guy Gi-Gyu murdered, the Toffee-nosed bastard, could be alive. So, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but find this conversation a little ironic.When Tae-Shik stalled awkwardly, Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cPlease feel free to say whatever you want, Hyung.\u201d\u201cI wanted to ask you if you\u2019re okay. I mean, really, okay? That bastard deserved to die, of course. And if you hadn\u2019t killed him, I certainly would have. But this is your first time killing someone, so\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu gave him another bitter smile and replied, \u201cI actually feel perfectly fine, which is a little unsettling. But now that I think about it, I believe you might be right: He is probably still alive and kicking.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s eyes glowed at the prospect of killing his enemy again. Although Tae-Shik saw it, he didn\u2019t say a word because this wasn\u2019t his business to interfere. After a brief pause, Gi-Gyu continued to tell Tae-Shik about the rest of the story. When he was finally done, Tae-Shik's face wore an odd expression. He murmured, \u201cSo many unbelievable things happened to you.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. It still feels like it was all just a dream,\u201d said Gi-Gyu. His body still remembered the dreadful pain, so he knew it wasn\u2019t just a dream.Tae-Shik asked suddenly, \u201cAnd what about the elixir you drank? Do you feel any different? Did you experience any miracles as your mother did?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Lucifer told me the elixir changes players slowly.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I see.\u201d\u00a0Tae-Shik nodded.\u201cShe explained that it\u2019ll first improve my internals and then move on to the outside. She described it as my physical shell being reformed,\u201d explained Gi-Gyu.\"I'm not familiar with the elixir, so I'm afraid I can't help you with that. Haa...\" Tae-Shik mumbled, puzzled. \"I can't believe you got yourself into such a precarious situation.\"What Tae-Shik didn\u2019t realize was that Gi-Gyu actually didn\u2019t tell him everything. For example, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t tell him Lucifer\u2019s true identity or his deal with her.\u201cBut why did Lucifer help you? I mean, her personality is indeed unpredictable, but...\u201d Tae-Shik murmured in confusion.\u201cYou know Lucifer too, Hyung?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cI\u2019ve seen her once from a distance. She was fighting at the time; let me tell you, she\u2019s a completely different beast than the other high rankers. Lee Sun-Ho would\u2019ve to get involved to bring her down.\u201d\u201cLee Sun-Ho?\u201d Gi-Gyu jolted in surprise as he asked, \u201cIs Lee Sun-Ho really that powerful? Enough to kill Lucifer?\u201d\u201cIndeed. It wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement to say Lee Sun-Ho is the strongest player in the world. I used to be a high ranker, so I know there are different levels even among the high rankers,\u201d explained Tae-Shik.In the past, Gi-Gyu only had a vague idea of what \u201cstrong\u201d meant in this world. But now, things were very different for him because he had now seen high rankers battling with his own eyes. And although it was only once, he even exchanged blows with a high ranker. Just like Lucifer said, it was true that one could only see what one knew.The high rankers were beastly beings; now, Gi-Gyu had seen that firsthand. They couldn\u2019t be humans; based on what he had seen, he believed Lucifer had to be the strongest of them all. But to hear Tae-Shik say Lee Sun-Ho was just as powerful, or even more\u2026 It was beyond shocking and made goosebumps rise on Gi-Gyu\u2019s arms.Returning to the subject of Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother, Tae-Shik offered, \u201cFor now, I\u2019ll look into an appropriate hospital for your mother\u2019s examination. I know a few doctors who know how to keep their mouths shut. So examining your mother privately shouldn\u2019t be a problem for them. Also, I think we should take this opportunity to get you tested as well.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying you should get tested as a player. We have no idea what effect the elixir will have on you, right? And who knows how it could affect your Egos? On top of that, you still don\u2019t know what that eye gift from Lucifer is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu with a nod.\u201cIgnorance could be a ticking time bomb in this case. Even antivenin can poison you if it isn\u2019t used correctly. Our priority should be learning as much as possible about your new abilities. We can think about the consequences of everything later,\u201d Tae-Shik suggested logically.\u201cThank you, Hyung.\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t doubt that Ironshield was going to come after him. Before that, he had to become as strong as possible if he wanted any chance of survival. One consolation, at least, was the promise Lucifer made before they parted.\u2018Ironshield won\u2019t find you for a while. I will make sure of it, so don\u2019t worry about it. Just focus on getting strong.\u2019Lucifer didn\u2019t elaborate further, but it was enough to reassure Gi-Gyu. Now that they were done discussing his recent adventure, Gi-Gyu asked Tae-Shik again, \u201cSo you haven\u2019t answered my question. Do you like my mother?\u201d\u201cKhoff, koff.\u201d Tae-Shik coughed awkwardly, making Gi-Gyu smile. Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like her for her new younger and prettier look. I know you\u2019ve been taking care of her all this time. I also heard you nursed her often when I wasn\u2019t around.\u201dTae-Shik blushed as Gi-Gyu encouraged him, \u201cI\u2019m all for it. Mom shouldn\u2019t have to be alone anymore. And if it\u2019s you, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll feel guilty toward my dad. I\u2019m not saying you should go get her right now, but you should do something if you really like her. You must realize that the way my mom looks right now, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if men became interested in her. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help chuckling when he saw Tae-Shik\u2019s ears turn red. Deciding he had teased the older man enough, Gi-Gyu took out something from his pocket and handed it to him.\u201cAnd here.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dIt was apparent the pouch contained a crystal. Based on its size, it had to be a big one. Tae-Shik asked, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the second reward I got from Heryond. Open it.\u201dWhen Tae-Shik opened the pouch and saw what was inside, his face became rigid. He muttered, \u201cHuh\u2026 So this was one of the rewards?\u201d\u201cYes, as you can see, it\u2019s a yellow crystal. Its size and clarity suggest it\u2019s probably of a very high grade. Its price would be too high for me to dispose of it myself.\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s true,\u201d Tae-Shik stammered.Crystal values varied depending on their colors. Yellow crystals were one of the highest grade crystals, and there were less than 100 of them in the world. The scientists claimed that this crystal could be the key to creating a new kind of ultimate weapon. Their prices varied depending on their size and quality, but most sold for tens of billions of won.Gi-Gyu said to Tae-Shik, \u201cWhen you sell it, please keep half of the profit and give me the rest. I owe you a lot, so I hope this will be enough.\u201d\u201cB-but this is too much,\u201d Tae-Shik protested, but Gi-Gyu was firm on his decision. Even with half of the money, he knew he could pay off his family debt plus what he owed Blacksmith Hwang. After paying for all that, he would still be left with enough money that his family wouldn\u2019t have to ever worry about money.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cWithout you, I would\u2019ve died a long time ago. If you don\u2019t accept this, I\u2019ll never see you again, Hyung.\u201dRealizing Gi-Gyu wouldn\u2019t budge, Tae-Shik nodded. He promised, \u201cI will try to sell it at the highest price possible.\u201d\u201cThank you, Hyung.\u201d***Gi-Gyu was once again impressed by Tae-Shik\u2019s authority. Less than two days after they had dinner together, Tae-Shik was back with the names of the doctors and the hospital that could examine Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother. He even figured out how to measure Gi-Gyu\u2019s current abilities in private.Currently, Gi-Gyu, Tae-Shik, and Su-Jin were waiting in a small building near Chuncheon city. Yoo-Jung couldn\u2019t make it because she had to go to school. Unfortunately, she would also have to stay alone for a few days, as Gi-Gyu and Su-Jin had to undergo some tests. Gi-Gyu knew Yoo-Jung would be comfortable staying home alone while attending school regularly. After all, most of their family worries were resolved now.A female doctor, who seemed well acquainted with Tae-Shik, approached Su-Jin and announced, \u201cMrs. Lee, please come this way.\u201dAfter Su-Jin walked away for her exam, Tae-Shik told Gi-Gyu, \u201cSu-Jin\u2019s examination will probably take less than a day, so don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s you we need to worry about.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re calling her by her first name now?\u201d Gi-Gyu joked.\u201c...\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, so don\u2019t make that scary face at me, Hyung.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik sighed deeply.It had only been two days since Gi-Gyu drank the elixir, yet he was already noticing a difference. In the past, Gi-Gyu always had a hard time building muscle. When he worked as a guide, there was a time when Gi-Gyu worked out like a madman. He hoped to become stronger with exercise, which would\u2019ve made it easier for him to hunt goblins. Unfortunately, Gi-Gyu\u2019s body refused to bulk up, and his muscle strength never improved. He never discovered the reason behind this peculiarity; even if he did, he could've done nothing back then.But since yesterday, Gi-Gyu could feel something was different about his body. He could feel his body bulking up slowly. His hair became a little darker, and he suspected he was a bit taller too.Tae-Shik offered, \u201cIf the doctor gives you a clean bill of health, we can go to the Tower to see if you can level up now.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dGi-Gyu was in no hurry to find out if he could level up. First things first, he had to confirm his basic abilities were okay. He had gone through this same test when he first became a player, so comparing the results could\u00a0give him the\u00a0changes easily. Testing his reflexes and magic functioning were next in line. The last thing to assess was going to be his player grade.\u201cI feel nervous,\u201d Gi-Gyu said while his body was being examined for the\u00a0tests.\u201cEven if nothing changed in your body, you will still have your Egos, right? We\u2019re doing these tests just out of curiosity and nothing more,\u201d comforted Tae-Shik.\u201cYeah, I know. I guess I shouldn\u2019t worry at all,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a smile.Soon after their conversation, Gi-Gyu\u2019s tests began.***Heo Sung-Hoon from the association was the one who came to help with Gi-Gyu\u2019s test. Sung-Hoon murmured, \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cAre the test results that bad?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t sure if Tae-Shik brought Sung-Hoon because Gi-Gyu was acquainted with him already. Or perhaps there was more to Tae-Shik and Sung-Hoon\u2019s relationship. But either way, Sung-Hoon put his best effort into Gi-Gyu\u2019s tests.Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t bad\u2026 They are vague.\u201d\u2018What is he talking about? \u2018When Gi-Gyu gave him a curious look, Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cYour basic abilities are extremely high. They are actually beyond the normal human levels.\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cThey are high for a normal human, not for a player.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu wanted to smack Sung-Hoon just about now. It seemed Sung-Hoon hadn\u2019t noticed Gi-Gyu\u2019s annoyance because he continued, \u201cYour reflex level is extremely high as well.\u201d\u201cFor an average non-player, that is?\u201d\u201cExactly. If you enter the Olympics right now, you\u2019ll win all the gold medals. But as a player, I would say you\u2019re at Level 10, at most.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cThe results for the other tests are about the same,\u201d Sung-Hoon said, trying to explain the poor results without hurting Gi-Gyu. Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t too upset, though. In fact, this was what he expected since he was still only at Level 1 with essentially zero abilities. In addition, Gi-Gyu took these tests without any help from his Egos. So, these results were actually almost better than his expectations. After all, wasn\u2019t it a good thing that he had a Level 10 player's might despite being a Level 1?If he could level up at all, then his current condition was more than what he could ever hope for.Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cBut your magic functioning level is through the roof.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cIn this category, you have tested higher than the ranker level,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon. The magic functioning level measured how quickly and accurately a player could utilize their magic. Having a high level/score meant a player could activate and strengthen their skills faster.Although Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t have any active skills at the moment, he could get them someday in the future. So, this was certainly good news for him.And the last thing to test was his grade. Sung-Hoon explained, \u201cI brought an older machine today. It\u2019s not the newest version, but it works fine. It will measure your approximate grade by estimating the amount of magic you hold.\u201d\u201cI am aware of what it does,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cIf a player\u2019s level is high, then his magic level would naturally be high as well. Players at a low level with a high magic score usually have great potential. This is why the magical level is measured with the player\u2019s current level in mind.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dGi-Gyu already knew how the machine worked, but he didn\u2019t interrupt Sung-Hoon.\u201cKim Gi-Gyu, you\u2019re Level 1, correct?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked.\u201cYes, I am.\u201dGi-Gyu had already told Sung-Hoon the gist of his situation. Tae-Shik highly recommended Sung-Hoon, and based on their past history, Gi-Gyu felt confident Sung-Hoon could be trusted. So, Gi-Gyu told him a few of his secrets and narrated a bit of what happened in the maze. Sung-Hoon was now aware of Gi-Gyu\u2019s Egos and what happened with Lucifer.Telling Sung-Hoon the truth was also essential after Gi-Gyu survived the Maze of Heryond. Sung-Hoon had been suspicious of how Gi-Gyu left the gate alive, so Gi-Gyu felt it was necessary to explain what had happened.Sung-Hoon ordered, \u201cPlease take off all of your clothes and enter that capsule. You can\u2019t wear any accessories either.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu.The capsule was secretly airlifted to this place by Tae-Shik; thus, the test machine\u2019s older version stood in front of them. Gi-Gyu slowly got undressed and entered it.Ba-dum, Ba-dum\u2026Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart pounded loudly as he waited. Although he knew he shouldn\u2019t have high expectations, he couldn\u2019t help hoping for a good result. So many things had happened recently, so perhaps he would receive a grade higher than an F.Sung-Hoon instructed, \u201cNow, hold your breath\u2026\u201dHup.\u201cExhale now.\u201dHaa\u2026Bzzz\u2026Before long, white steam wafted from the capsule as its door opened.\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Sung-Hoon announced. It was such a simple test that Gi-Gyu felt pathetic for feeling so nervous. Then again, any player who went through this test was bound to feel anxious like Gi-Gyu.Just then, Tae-Shik walked in and asked, \u201cWhat? All done already?\u201dSung-Hoon greeted Tae-Shik briefly and began to analyze Gi-Gyu\u2019s magic functioning level. Tae-Shik walked up to Gi-Gyu and asked, \u201cSo, how were the test results?\u201d\u201cWell, he said it was a little confusing and vague,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cReally? Well, that\u2019s what I expected. I glanced at your results, and it looked like your basic abilities were pretty good. If you can level up, your growth potential is huge. And with your ability\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik contemplated for a moment before making a statement. Then, he said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cI think you could become the next beast.\u201dThe term \u201cBeast\u201d was what Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu used to refer to an especially strong high ranker. Just then, Sung-Hoon walked up to Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu. It appeared that he was done with his calculations.When Sung-Hoon\u2019s face looked tense, Gi-Gyu asked nervously, \u201cIs the result awful?\u201d\u201cN-no, that\u2019s not it.\u201d After taking a deep breath, Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cYour grade has been measured to be SS.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThat means you have the potential to become a high ranker.\u201d When Sung-Hoon explained, Gi-Gyu gaped widely in shock.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31. Elixir (3)Gi-Gyu asked in disbelief, \u201cAre you sure the machine isn\u2019t broken?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s old, so I checked it earlier, and everything worked like a charm then. If you think you can\u2019t trust the machine, I can go in myself.\u201d Then, Sung-Hoon quickly began undressing, so Gi-Gyu had to wave his hand in surprise. \u201cN-no! That\u2019s not what I meant. I was just shocked to hear my result.\u201d\u201cI can certainly understand why you would feel skeptical in this situation,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon. But it was Tae-Shik who put Gi-Gyu\u2019s doubt to rest.\u201cIt\u2019s simple, Gi-Gyu: You drank the elixir. The number of people who have done that can be counted on one hand. When one obtains the elixir, they do one of the three things. First, sell it to the richest person they can find. Second, feed it to their sick non-player family member. Or third, they hide it away for later use,\u201d explained Tae-Shik, providing the most logical reasoning.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu contemplated what Tae-Shik was trying to say.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cAs for those who actually drink the elixir\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re probably all high rankers, right?\u201d Gi-Gyu finished the sentence for him.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Usually, they are high-level players even before consuming the elixir. This is probably why the elixir\u2019s effects are still unknown to the public.\u201d When Tae-Shik suggested, Gi-Gyu nodded and murmured, \u201cOr\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d asked Tae-Shik.\u201cMaybe the elixir\u2019s effect is greater when a low-level player consumes it,\u201d Gi-Gyu suggested, his face filled with an odd certainty.***Every test that could be done in the hospital for Gi-Gyu was completed. His mother\u2019s medical exam was finished as well. The doctor stated that Su-Jin\u2019s body was in a perfectly normal condition. Her body wasn\u2019t displaying any signs of aging, her muscle strength and stamina were better than average, and she was healthier than before overall.Gi-Gyu teased, \u201cNo matter how I think about it, I believe my mom would make an amazing bride.\u201d\u201cKhoff, khoff\u2026\u201dTae-Shik coughed in embarrassment, and Gi-Gyu added, \u201cBut I guess the most surprising thing that came out of this is my mother\u2019s new ability.\u201d\u201cYeah, totally.\u201d Tae-Shik agreed. Looking at each other knowingly, the two men nodded as they said together, \u201cShe can now use player items.\u201dThanks to the elixir, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother gained a special ability of sorts: She could now use player items despite not being one. The elixir gave her the mana necessary to utilize player items.Gi-Gyu thought happily, \u2018I better get her some good items,\u2019Gi-Gyu believed his mother would be safer if she had some player items protecting her. Tae-Shik added, \u201cI\u2019m so relieved that both you and Su-Jin are fine. All of your results turned out great.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Noticing a frown on Gi-Gyu\u2019s head, Tae-Shik asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wondering about the gift from Lucifer. What do you think?\u201d\u201cA gift\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say that it\u2019s just a mode of communication for now? If it has no other functions right now, I\u2019m not sure if I would call it a gift,\u201d replied Tae-Shik.\u201cThen what would it be?\u201d\u201cIt should be nothing more than a token of your contract with her.\u201d When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t comment, Tae-Shik shook his head and continued, \u201cBut, we are focusing on the wrong things: We have bigger fish to fry. Just the secrets and work I\u2019ve to do\u2026 Ahhh, I worry I can even handle it all.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded in agreement and asked Tae-Shik, \u201cCould you drive my mother back home, Hyung?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI have someplace I need to be,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu, worrying Tae-Shik. Tae-Shik asked in a worried voice, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019ve to stay put and rest for a while.\u201d\u201cI need to drop by the Dongdaemun Market.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to drive you there then?\u201d offered Tae-Shik, wanting to help out in any way he could. But, Gi-Gyu shook his head and answered, \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got to do some thinking, so I\u2019ll be fine going alone.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Gi-Gyu reassured. Tae-Shik still seemed unhappy, but he nodded in the end. Gi-Gyu had gone through so much in such a short time, so Tae-Shik couldn\u2019t help but worry about him. He knew Gi-Gyu was no longer a hopeless 18-year-old boy, and too much worry on his part could be harmful to Gi-Gyu.Tae-Shik asked as his eyes turned serious, \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\u201cYou can ask me anything, Hyung. I feel I can comfortably tell you everything without making bones about it.\u201d\u201cMoving forward, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d Tae-Shik asked with a subdued voice, as he didn\u2019t want Su-Jin to hear them. He continued, \u201cWhat\u2019s your game plan for the future? Too many things have happened, so don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve to prioritize what you need to do? You\u2019ve made enough money, which is great, but I don\u2019t think you can retire after what happened with Lucifer.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded in agreement. Lucifer had done too much for him, so he owed her a great deal. Gi-Gyu planned on repaying that debt no matter what, but there was one thing that bothered him to no end: What if Lucifer never let him go? She did say she didn\u2019t care about him, but this was Lucifer they were talking about. She would not let her investment walk away before squeezing it dry. And yes, Gi-Gyu was the big, fat, creamy investment in this analogy.Although he was just as worried and confused as Tae-Shik, Gi-Gyu calmly \u00a0answered, \u201cI have already decided on my priorities.\u201d After licking his dry lips, he added, \u201cMy top priority\u2026 To become strong.\u201d***Gi-Gyu took the subway to the Dongdaemun Market. As he was traveling from Chuncheon, it took him a long time to get there. Gi-Gyu took a seat, closed his eyes, and contemplated. After leaving the maze, he had to take care of many things, so he never got the time to think.Now that the doctor had given Gi-Gyu and his mother a clean bill of health, it was finally time to organize his thoughts.\u2018A single high ranker could be as strong as a nation\u2019s entire army.\u2019This was what Gi-Gyu had learned recently. Lucifer, Ironshield, and Athena. They could easily hold their own against an entire nation\u2019s army. And if these high rankers went all out\u2026\u2018It would be devastating.\u2019Gi-Gyu had witnessed only a small part of Lucifer\u2019s power, but he now felt certain of one thing: An all-out fight, no- An all-out battle between high rankers could level an entire nation.\u2018All the average players combined won't be enough to handle these high rankers.\u2019This was why Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t desire the strength that various guild masters had. If what he wanted in life were to rule and control others, such might have been necessary. However, Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t aiming for that. He just wished for his and his family's safety and\u2026\u2018Revenge.\u2019The elixir had completely healed him, but his body still throbbed with pain. His body still remembered the gruesome torture it suffered\u2014the phantom pain was agonizing.\u2018Ironshield!\u2019The one responsible for this pain, Ironshield, would come after him. The high ranker knew Gi-Gyu\u2019s face, so finding him shouldn\u2019t even be a problem. Gi-Gyu trusted Lucifer, but there was no way of knowing how long she could hold off Ironshield. Gi-Gyu knew he shouldn\u2019t be surprised even if Ironshield found him tomorrow and destroyed everything he loved.Tae-Shik was a capable man, but he wouldn\u2019t be enough to protect Gi-Gyu\u2019s entire family from the Iron Guild.\u2018Rogers Han.\u2019Then there was a matter involving Rogers Han, who could still be alive. Gi-Gyu suspected Rogers Han could\u2019ve somehow survived despite being stabbed in the neck. He didn't want to fear the unknown or feel resentment toward the fact that he lost a target of his revenge. So, Gi-Gyu decided to focus on preparing for the worst situation. He had to prepare himself for the day he would finally destroy them.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu opened his eyes slowly. Now, he had to find a way to become strong. How was he going to gain enough power to not only survive the world\u2019s strongest guilds and players but also kill them?\u2018Lou, El, and the other Egos.\u2019His greatest weapon was his unique ability. Lou was getting stronger with each monster it killed, and El recently found a way to get stronger too.The Empress of Holy Swords: This was El\u2019s true identity. Quietly, Gi-Gyu opened El\u2019s status screen.[El][Title:\u00a0The Empress of Holy Swords][Level 29][Power: 60][Speed: 42][Stamina: 55][Magic: 80]-Abilities-[Accessory][The Empress of Holy Swords: It can absorb the abilities of inferior holy swords.][Calleon: It can block a single fatal attack.]During Gi-Gyu\u2019s brief fight with Ironshield, El absorbed a small part of Ironshield\u2019s holy sword, Calleon. The result was an astounding increase in El\u2019s stats and two new abilities called The Empress of Holy Swords and Calleon. With the title of The Empress of Holy Swords came the ability to absorb stats and powers from other holy swords. Based on what happened when El clashed with Ironshield\u2019s Calleon, the number of stat points El could absorb from the other holy swords depended on Gi-Gyu. This meant that if he became strong enough to battle Ironshield, El could absorb Calleon completely.And the second skill El gained was named after Ironshield\u2019s sword, Calleon. Gi-Gyu suspected that this new skill was one of Calleon\u2019s skills. Despite being a single-use skill, it was a welcome addition, as it could save him from a fatal attack. It was akin to having an extra life.What pleased Gi-Gyu the most was that El had \u201cabsorbed\u201d this skill from Calleon, not \u201ccopied\u201d it. So when Calleon lost this skill, Ironshield also lost his extra life to Gi-Gyu.Pfft\u2026Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help grinning as he asked his Egos silently,\u2018The giant sword, Calleon, is that an Ego too? Are all holy swords Egos?\u2019-No.-Not all of them are Egos. Then again, I just learned that I am a holy sword, so I don\u2019t know much at this point, Master.\u2018Then, please let me know when you learn more about it, El.\u2019-Of course, Master. I\u2019ll always help you to the best of my abilities.\u2018Thanks, El.\u2019Now, Gi-Gyu\u2019s duty was to find as many holy swords as possible for El\u2019s growth. This would be a difficult task because he just found out they existed, but he was still pleased. After all, he just found a way for El, and in turn, himself, to become stronger.Gi-Gyu closed his eyes again.\u2018Lucifer.\u2019Another thing of worry was the \u201cgift\u201d Soo-Jung gave him. He wondered if he could really trust the power she gave him. The answer came to him rather quickly.\u2018No.\u2019It was true he owed Lucifer a great deal. However, Gi-Gyu remembered her heading toward the keeper\u2019s room immediately after finding him, which meant she knew where it was. There was only one explanation for this: She was there when he was being tortured, watching calmly. Lucifer watched Gi-Gyu being tortured for days, yet she only appeared at the last minute when he was about to die.Lucifer disguised herself as a young girl to approach him. When Gi-Gyu was caught by Ironshield and was in danger, she hid without a word. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know the reason behind her actions, but the fact was that she treated his torture as a sideshow. Based on what he had seen of her power, Lucifer could\u2019ve easily saved him from all the pain, yet she chose not to help him.Tap.Gi-Gyu suddenly felt someone nudging his leg. He saw a middle-aged man kicking his leg when he opened his eyes. It was obvious this man was heavily intoxicated. When Gi-Gyu looked around, there were plenty of empty seats around them: The man was trying to pick a fight.The drunkard yelled, \u201cHey! You bastard! You should be standing up and giving your seat to your elder! I\u2019ve been standing here for a long time! Hic!\u201dThere were many empty seats around them; evidently, this man was being unreasonable. There were several other passengers nearby, but they did what spectators do.\u201cThere are plenty of empty seats here. Please just take one of those,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied politely. Maybe Gi-Gyu\u2019s polite voice somehow convinced the drunkard that he was scared, as the man began yelling even louder.\u201cYou jerk! How dare you talk back to your elder?! Is that what your parents taught you to do? When your elder asks for something, you should just shut up and do it!\u201dGi-Gyu frowned at the man\u2019s rude behavior. Unfortunately, this was a common occurrence nowadays. After the Tower appeared, not all changes were positive. Due to the sudden industrial developments, many people became jobless. This, in turn, caused an increase in violent behaviors in public. Many became dependent on alcohol as they wasted their lives away. Gi-Gyu often saw these drunkards picking fights with innocent bystanders on the news.-The next stop is Hwegi Station.This was Gi-Gyu\u2019s stop. When he stood up to get off, the man gleefully yelled, \u201cThere you go! That\u2019s right! Do you have any idea how hard my generation worked?! You young people are having such easy lives, all thanks to us! Do you realize that?! Do you?!\u201dGi-Gyu, now standing and towering over the man, looked down at him quietly. He had always been a tall guy, but he felt he had gotten even taller after drinking the elixir. He said to the man, \u201cIt\u2019s people like you who give a bad rep to your generation. Unlike you, many men your age out there work very hard for their families.\u201dGulp.The drunkard swallowed audibly. Glaring at the pathetic man, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d\u201cHiuckkk!\u201d When the drunkard met Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, he stumbled, trying to take a step back. No one got up to help him as Gi-Gyu added, \u201cPlease stop getting drunk like this and get some help. You should stop annoying innocent people like you did today.\u201dGi-Gyu got off the subway as the drunk man stared at him fearfully. \u201cH-h\u2026 hiuck! H-his eyes! What the heck was that? Dammit!\u201dThe man\u2019s pants were wet by the time the subway door closed behind Gi-Gyu.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32. MovingKnock, knock.Gi-Gyu stood before an old, worn door and knocked on it politely. He could hear someone inside, but he didn\u2019t enter, as he wasn\u2019t given permission to enter. When no response came from inside after a while, Gi-Gyu knocked again.Knock, knock.Finally, the forging sounds stopped, and an elderly voice announced, \u201cCome in.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu entered, he saw Old Man Hwang focused on his work. It was past 10 p.m., but that was the time they agreed on when Gi-Gyu contacted Old Man Hwang earlier.Old Man Hwang must\u2019ve been quenching and tempering because he was covered in sweat. In one of his hands was a thick hammer bigger than his leg.Without turning toward Gi-Gyu, the blacksmith declared, \u201cI\u2019ve received your payment. I\u2019ve to say I was worried our cooperation would come to an abrupt end.\u201dThe old man began hammering again as Gi-Gyu apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. I actually didn\u2019t expect to see you again. The way you sent your payment was obviously part of your last will.\u201dThe older man had seemingly guessed the dire situation Gi-Gyu was in when he sent the payment.\u2018Wisdom does indeed come with age,\u2019\u00a0thought Gi-Gyu.Old Man Hwang continued, \u201cAfter years, someone who can help my babies see the world appears, only to die days later. I was very disappointed.\u201dClang, clang.The blacksmith hammered the piece he was working on a few times and then added, \u201cYet you came back alive. Hmm\u2026 I can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m glad to see you alive. Just give me a minute.\u201dThe older man finally stopped hammering. The completed piece, a bracelet, was glowing brightly on the table.\u2018It\u2019s another Ego.\u2019-Just who is this human? I knew he could make the Egos, but watching him make one before my very eyes is so\u2026 weird.-But all of his Egos lack consciousness. They are fake. They\u2019re just empty shells.Gi-Gyu unconsciously touched his chest as he listened to Lou and El. He had spent much time with Brunheart, and now that it was gone, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but feel a little empty inside.Brunheart perished after saving Gi-Gyu\u2019s life. It may have been a fake Ego like Lou and El claimed, but Gi-Gyu felt like he lost a comrade in arms. It wasn\u2019t the loss of additional abilities he mourned but the loss of a friend.Old Man Hwang asked quietly, \u201cDid my child die?\u201d He was clearly referring to Brunheart.\u201cYes, it saved my life, perishing as a result.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The blacksmith placed his hammer on the table and murmured, \u201cOf course. It was born for that purpose, so I shouldn\u2019t be sad about its demise.\u201dOld Man Hwang was a true craftsman: he understood the purposes of his weapons. However, his eyes were tearing up despite his blunt words. It was apparent those items were more than tools to him.Old Man Hwang muttered, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sold it for so cheap. Well\u2026 at least, it gained a good master. But the price of meeting a good master ended up being death. The life of armor is a sad one, don\u2019t you think? Because it didn\u2019t have a consciousness, it perished without feeling the pride in what it had accomplished.\u201d\u201cThank you for letting me meet such great armor, Sir.\u201d\u201cHahaha,\u201d the old man laughed out loud. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s relief, the blacksmith didn\u2019t act as coldly toward him as before. It seemed the old man now approved of Gi-Gyu a bit.He studied Gi-Gyu\u2019s face and asked, \u201cIt looks like a lot happened to you. Can you tell me about it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long story. Are you sure you want to hear about it?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s not like I have anything else to do. After all, I\u2019m just an idle old man,\u201d replied the old man as he brought a chair he made himself for Gi-Gyu. The two men got comfortable and began to chat.***\u201cHuh\u2026 Your story is unbelievable. In just a few months, you went through stuff others don\u2019t experience in their entire lifetimes,\u201d commented the old man. He seemed genuinely impressed and saddened by Gi-Gyu\u2019s story.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t tell him everything that happened. He left out the parts he wasn\u2019t comfortable telling the blacksmith. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t have to tell the blacksmith anything, but he felt there were some parts of his story the old man had to know about.\u201cYour appearance has also changed greatly,\u201d Old Man Hwang muttered as he studied Gi-Gyu carefully. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but laugh a bit, as he felt like a weapon being examined. When he first met the blacksmith, Gi-Gyu thought he was just a blunt old man. But now, Old Man Hwang gave off a Taoist-like aura. From the looks of it, Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t the only one who went through a change in the past few months.\u2018No, that\u2019s not it. He has always been like this. He hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u2019Ever since Gi-Gyu drank the elixir, he began to see things he couldn\u2019t before. He realized that Old Man Hwang had always been like this: He wasn\u2019t just a great craftsman. Gi-Gyu could glimpse into much more thanks to his improved instinct.He is a great blacksmith and a powerful player.\u2019\u201cHuh. I guess your sight has improved as well, Young Man?\u201d\u201cYes, indeed.\u201dOld Man Hwang wasn\u2019t referring to Gi-Gyu\u2019s literal eyesight. He was talking about Gi-Gyu\u2019s ability to see through a person. Clearly impressed, the blacksmith replied, \u201cHaa... I\u2019ve lived a long time, but I have never seen someone grow this much in such a short amount of time.\u201dFeeling their conversation wasn\u2019t going anywhere, Gi-Gyu finally decided to broach the main subject. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll pay the rest of Brunheart\u2019s price within the week.\u201dGi-Gyu had already given the blacksmith a lot of money, but he didn\u2019t feel like he had paid enough for Brunheart. The old man nodded and replied, \u201cYes, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201dThe old man was indeed a savvy businessman. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cAnd as for why I came here\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want to see my other items, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGi-Gyu had to confirm many things; he needed Old Man Hwang\u2019s pseudo Egos for that.With a shrug, the old man answered, \u201cWell, it appears you\u2019re the only one who can use my items. I almost feel like I\u2019m creating my pieces just for you.\u201d\u2018Brilliant blacksmith, powerful player, and\u2026 \u00a0a bright businessman.\u2019Gi-Gyu smiled and requested, \u201cThen may I have a look?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Old Man Hwang rose and gave Gi-Gyu some space to roam. The old workshop was filled with nameless pseudo Egos. But to Gi-Gyu and Old Man Hwang, they looked like priceless treasures.An abrupt reminder entered Gi-Gyu's head, and he asked, \u201cOh, and there is one more thing I would like to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Old Man Hwang asked in curiosity.\u201cDo you know about special weapons?\u201d The second Gi-Gyu mentioned this, the elderly man became rigid. Gi-Gyu realized the old man knew about the special weapons he was referring to.Feigning ignorance, the elderly man asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by special weapons?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the regular items with high levels or those rare finds. I\u2019m referring to the weapons that are special themselves. For example\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu paused\u2014\u201cweapons like the holy swords.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The old man caressed his white beard and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll admit I am aware of them.\u201d\u2018I knew it!\u2019One of the reasons Gi-Gyu visited the old man was to get some answers. But he frowned when the old man suddenly added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know them.\u201d\u2018He\u2019s giving me a vague answer. He\u2019s telling me he doesn\u2019t know them, but he\u2019s aware of them.\u2019When Gi-Gyu looked confused, the old man explained, \u201cThe weapons you\u2019re referring to are not like the items you currently possess or my babies. You said Egos are picky when it comes to choosing their masters, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sir.\u201d\u201cAnd you were saying you\u2019re the only one who can use these Egos so far, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOld Man Hwang smiled with interest and continued, \u201cThe special weapons you\u2019re talking about aren\u2019t Egos, yet they are also very finicky about their masters. I don\u2019t know their standards, but perhaps they prefer strong players or kind masters. It\u2019s also possible they have their own rules we aren\u2019t aware of.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t know a single guy who owns one.\u201dDespite the old man repeatedly saying he didn\u2019t know much, he kept on pouring out crucial information. The blacksmith asked, \u201cSo this is why I said I don\u2019t know them, but I am aware of them. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\u201cThese weapons are a class apart from all the other normal items. I suspect\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t interrupt; instead, he patiently waited for the older man to continue.\u201cThey were probably made for a specific purpose. I mean, fighting their masters\u2019 fight shouldn\u2019t be their sole purpose. They must have a special purpose.\u201d\u201cOf course, Sir.\u201d\u201cA long time ago, I saw a holy sword. It was just one time, but I remember it.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIt belonged to a powerful player, and his holy sword disappeared as well when he died. Being a blacksmith, I got so curious about his sword that I asked him to let me examine it. He owed me a great deal, so he was happy to oblige.\u201d Old Man Hwang told the story as if it happened a lifetime ago. \u201cThat sword wasn\u2019t something created by a human. It was also different from the items dropped by the monsters.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt had to be a work of someone other than humans. Perhaps it was created by a whole new race hiding inside the Tower. Or maybe it was made by higher beings we aren\u2019t aware of.\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t elaborate any further.-Exactly. You\u2019re right, Old Man. Also, the items you make are pseudo Egos, but the very fact that you can means that you aren\u2019t a human either.Lou spat out in annoyance.***\u201cMother, what kind of house would you like?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me, Son.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be shy about this, Mother. Please tell me,\u201d Gi-Gyu prodded with a smile. Yellow crystals were always in high demand, so Tae-Shik sold Gi-Gyu\u2019s at an excellent price.After Tae-Shik had taken his share, 20 billion won was deposited into his player bank account. Gi-Gyu paid the sum for Brunheart and all the other Egos he purchased from Old Man Hwang as soon as he received the payout. This left him with 3 billion won. But after paying off various debts, including his mother\u2019s remaining hospital bills, the final balance in Gi-Gyu\u2019s account was 1 billion won.\u2018The first thing I need to do is move.\u2019This was something Gi-Gyu had wanted to do for a long time. His neighborhood was an unsafe place, too isolated from the rest of the city. With a young and beautiful mother at home, Gi-Gyu\u2019s worry about his family's safety increased. He was, of course, worried about Yoo-Jung as well.Unlike his mother, a gorgeous woman, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t find his sister a great beauty. In fact, he thought she was rather unattractive, but it seemed that other people found her comely. Perhaps Yoo-Jung did resemble their mother after all.Gi-Gyu was now physically strong enough to protect his family, but he would often be away hunting in the Tower or the gates. On top of that, his current home was too crowded. He had always dreamt of living in a spacious home.His mother protested, \u201cEven if you have some money now, you shouldn\u2019t waste it away. You must save it for\u2014\u201d\u201cMother, I can make this kind of money easily, so please just tell me where you would like to live.\u201d When Gi-Gyu insisted, Yoo-Jung suddenly raised her hand and yelled, \u201cMe! Me!\u201dToday was her school\u2019s foundation anniversary, so Yoo-Jung was home. She exclaimed, \u201cI want to live in a three-story house with a basement. I also want a large garden to raise two big puppies!\u201dApparently, Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t the only one dreaming about moving out. This was expected since their home was an awful place to live.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow about you, Mother?\u201d\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter to me. As long as I get to live with you and Yoo-Jung, then\u2014\u201dRealizing his mother was about to cry again, Gi-Gyu quickly replied, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go out right now and start looking.\u201dHe rose and left their home. Gi-Gyu knew that if he stayed any longer, his whole family would end up hugging and crying again. They were happy tears, so this wasn\u2019t a bad thing, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to go through the emotional scene again.\u201cHaa\u2026 Mother has been so emotional lately. Wait! How am I supposed to look for a new home?\u201dGi-Gyu had never moved before, so he had no idea how to buy real estate. He knew he should visit a real estate agent, but he had no idea which neighborhood he should be looking at. And that was just one of the many questions circling his mind. For example, did he even have enough money to buy a house? What about Yoo-Jung\u2019s school? Gi-Gyu felt so lost as to what he should do next.Sadly, he didn\u2019t have anyone to ask these questions either. Tae-Shik was too busy right now, and Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to bother him with every little thing. Because Gi-Gyu dropped out of high school and rarely contacted his old classmates, he didn\u2019t have many friends left. There were less than 30 contacts on his cell phone.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d He sighed and sat down on the stairs. He had always thought hunting was the hardest thing to do, but it seemed that plenty of other things could cause him troubles. Like Lucifer said, the more you knew, the more you could see in this world.\u201cDo you need help?\u201d A man, who was walking up the stairs, asked Gi-Gyu.\u201c...?\u201d\u201cIf you have something you\u2019re worried about, I\u2019m happy to listen.\u201d The man\u2019s voice sounded familiar. \u201cBecause my name is Heo Sung-Hoonnn! Grrr!\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand why, but Heo Sung-Hoon seemed amused by something. He was chuckling loudly as he walked up the stairs to Gi-Gyu.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33. Moving (2)When Gi-Gyu looked at him blankly, Sung-Hoon asked in confusion, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had the time to watch TV, so\u2026\u201d replied Gi-Gyu, feeling embarrassed. Based on Sung-Hoon\u2019s reaction, it seemed \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d was a popular TV drama or movie. Sadly, what little free time Gi-Gyu had was spent watching the player\u2019s channel, so he had no idea what Sung-Hoon was talking about.Gi-Gyu was still young, so the fact that he was so behind the newest trend embarrassed him a bit. Sung-Hoon consoled him with a kind smile, \u201cWell, it was popular over 20 years ago, so no worries.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon with another smile and just stood there quietly. It was a bit unsettling, so Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cUmm\u2026 What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m here to see you, player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cI can see that, but why? Did something happen?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion. Sung-Hoon was an association employee and a capable player. He had helped Gi-Gyu on multiple occasions, and all of them required him to leave his post. So, was it really okay for him to be away from his work so often?\u201cI was assigned a new position,\u201d Sung-Hoon explained.\u201cA new position?\u201d\"Yes, I will be working as your secretary, player Kim\u00a0Gi-Gyu.\u201d When Sung-Hoon announced calmly, Gi-Gyu gaped in shock. He asked, \u201cWhy would you be working as my secretary, Sung-Hoon? I don\u2019t belong to the association or have a high enough position to have a secretary.\u201d\u201cWell, to be exact, I\u2019m General Manager Oh Tae-Shik\u2019s secretary.\u201d As if finding Gi-Gyu\u2019s reaction funny, Sung-Hoon continued with a playful smile, \u201cBut, General Manager Oh Tae-Shik told me he doesn\u2019t need a secretary. So he ordered me to help you, player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cThen, who assigned you to be Tae-Shik\u2019s secretary?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cOh Tae-Shik did.\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019Sung-Hoon had been addressing Tae-Shik as \u201cGeneral Manager\u201d until now, but for the first time, he used just the name: Oh Tae-Shik.With a sigh, Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cHaa\u2026 The portal maintenance position paid a hardship allowance, so I made good money. But my salary dropped when I became his secretary.\u201dFrom the way he was acting, Sung-Hoon seemed pretty annoyed. He had always shown great respect for Tae-Shik, yet the recent change had reduced his admiration for the general manager.Sung-Hoon added, \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s what happened. If you need anything from now on, just call me. Could you give me your cell phone?\u201d\u201cAh, here.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu handed him his phone, Sung-Hoon entered his phone number.[Hot Secretary Heo Sung-Hoon]\u2018I had no idea Sung-Hoon was like this.\u2019Gi-Gyu stared down at the name Sung-Hoon entered in his phone. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo you\u2019ll be following me around?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Sung-Hoon waved his head awkwardly and continued, \u201cI\u2019m not your bodyguard. I\u2019m only here to help you with your daily things.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were my bodyguard.\u201d\u201cWell, if you wish, I could certainly stay by your side every day. But, you\u2019ll have to pay me overtime then.\u201d Sung-Hoon replied and made the universally known money sign with his fingers.Gi-Gyu shook his head and inquired, \u201cNo, thanks. But why did Tae-Shik hyung do this?\u201d\u201cSo you would owe him. He wants you to be indebted to him.\u201d\u201cIndebted to him?\u201dGi-Gyu asked why Tae-Shik would place an association employee as his secretary, but the answer he got baffled him.Understanding Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion, Sung-Hoon explained, \u201cRight now, you feel guilty and thankful toward the general manager, right? And you probably also feel a little burdened by his kindness.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the general manager wants. He truly cares about you, player Kim Gi-Gyu, but that man is also an incredible businessman. You will undoubtedly become a mighty player, and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll do anything for the general manager if he asks. Even if he asks for something impossible, you\u2019ll try your absolute best. Am I right?\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t nod, but he almost flinched at Sung-Hoon\u2019s accurate assessment.\u2018Sung-Hoon\u2019s right. I\u2019ll probably act in a heartbeat even if he asks for something impossible.\u2019It was because Gi-Gyu owed Tae-Shik a great deal. Heo Sung-Hoon smiled knowingly and replied, \u201cSee? That\u2019s exactly it. Gi-Gyu, people like you always repay their debts of blood and kindness. So if there comes a time when the general manager needs your help, you\u2019ll help him without question. Besides, you don\u2019t plan on refusing the general manager\u2019s help anytime soon, do you?\u201dAgain, Sung-Hoon was right. If Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to owe Tae-Shik anymore, all he had to do was refuse his help. But he had no intention of wasting what Tae-Shik offered.Clap!Sung-Hoon smiled and announced, \u201cThen, it\u2019s settled. Shall we go have a look at some houses?\u201d When he offered his hand, Gi-Gyu awkwardly took it and stood up.***\u201cAre you okay to move in one week?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked.\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cThen I will arrange for the moving company,\u201d offered Sung-Hoon.\u201cThere is no need. We\u2019ll be leaving everything behind. This is our new home, so I want everything new inside. We\u2019ll just pack a few things we require,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.Gi-Gyu wondered if Heo Sung-Hoon used to be a real estate agent before he became a player. Sung-Hoon made an excellent secretary, as he took care of almost everything Gi-Gyu needed to move.\u2018I think Sung-Hoon chose the wrong profession for himself.\u2019Gi-Gyu felt like Sung-Hoon should\u2019ve become a businessman. Or perhaps a conman, as Sung-Hoon was incredibly eloquent. Heo Sung-Hoon even managed to impress the other much-experienced real estate agents.All in all, Gi-Gyu was satisfied with how things turned out. He purchased a spacious house with a garden overlooking the beautiful Bukhan River. Since Su-Jin drank the elixir, a medical professional had to monitor her health on a regular basis. But, Gi-Gyu felt uncomfortable taking her to just any hospital. Thankfully, Gi-Gyu was pleased with the clinic Tae-Shik introduced to them, and this clinic happened to be close to his new house. On top of it, this house was also within his price range.Gi-Gyu murmured to Sung-Hoon, \u201cI\u2019m only concerned about Yoo-Jung\u2019s school. It\u2019s so far from our new house\u2014\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that! Did you know that Yoo-Jung passed her GED this year? She wants to stay close to her mother and prepare for the SAT alone, so she quit school.\u201dGi-Gyu was left speechless by Sung-Hoon\u2019s cheerful interruption.\u201c...?\u201dGi-Gyu was shocked for two reasons. First, he had no idea Yoo-Jung took the GED, passed it, and was now preparing to take her SAT. Second, how did Sung-Hoon know about this before him?When Sung-Hoon saw the shock and confusion on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face, he hurriedly explained, \u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand this situation. I believe Yoo-Jung kept this a secret from everyone. I only found out by coincidence while working on their protection detail.\u201d\u201cProtection detail?\u201d Gi-Gyu was surprised once again.\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? While you were away, the general manager spent a chunk of his personal balance placing several bodyguards on your sister and your mother. The guards, of course, kept their distance so they didn't impinge on the ladies\u2019 privacy. All this was a hush-hush matter, as the general manager didn\u2019t want your family to feel burdened.\u201dListening to Sung-Hoon\u2019s explanation, Gi-Gyu scratched his head. Gi-Gyu had no idea Tae-Shik went this far to take care of his family. Thinking Gi-Gyu might be feeling offended, Sung-Hoon added, \u201cYour neighborhood happened to be in an unsafe area. And your mother was ill too, wasn\u2019t she? The general manager was only trying to help, so please don\u2019t feel upset. Also, the bodyguards were dismissed soon after you returned.\u201d\u201cOf course, I understand. I am thankful for what he did for us.\u201d Apart from feeling even more impressed by Tae-Shik, he also felt quite disappointed in his sister.\u2018When I get back home, she will get the scolding of her life.\u2019While Gi-Gyu\u2019s anger toward Yoo-Jung grew, Sung-Hoon suggested, \u201cThis area doesn\u2019t have the most convenient transportation system, so I think it would be best for you to buy a car. You should be left with enough money even after you factor out the money for your new furniture and living expenses.\u201d\u201cGood idea. Please have it arranged.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon with a smile. Gi-Gyu was now much more comfortable asking Sung-Hoon for help in various matters.***A week had passed since Gi-Gyu last entered a gate or the Tower. He felt that the changes in his body were still ongoing, and he also needed more time to get used to his newly improved Egos.Most importantly, what El told him earlier was still circling his mind.-I haven\u2019t been able to absorb Calleon\u2019s power thoroughly. In my current condition, I can\u2019t say for sure what\u2019ll happen if I acquire more experience points. I apologize, Master.\u2018Not at all, El. For now, please just focus on absorbing Calleon\u2019s power.\u2019-Of course, Master.From what Gi-Gyu had heard from El, the sudden massive influx of holy power from Calleon was creating roadblocks, i.e., El was having difficulty digesting it all. For now, Gi-Gyu was just happy he could enjoy his well-deserved rest. Now that his mother was healed, he could lay back and enjoy his days off with his family.And finally, the moving day came.\u201cUwaah! A garden?! Seriously? A whole house!\u201d Yoo-Jung hopped around with her hands raised in excitement.Smack!Gi-Gyu lightly tapped his sister's head. Even though it was only a gentle swat, Yoo-Jung still rubbed her head with her hands. When she glared at him, Gi-Gyu scolded her, \u201cHow dare you glare at me like that?! I\u2019m still mad at you about what you did.\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dGi-Gyu had admonished Yoo-Jung when he found out she quit her school. He had to leave high school because of his family situation, but more of the same was never what he wanted for his sister. However, he came to understand her decision after she explained herself.\u2018She said she wanted to spend as much time with Mother as possible because she thought Mother was going to die. Silly girl\u2026 How can I get angry at that?\u2019Back then, Yoo-Jung did say that their mother\u2019s condition was worsening rapidly while Gi-Gyu was away. Afraid their mother might end up dying alone, she made the tough call. Bitterness and guilt flooded Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart after he heard his sister\u2019s explanation.He muttered, \u201cI guess you\u2019re all grown up now.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I grew up a long time ago, Oppa. But hey, in the olden days, I would\u2019ve had two kids by now!\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu tapped Yoo-Jung\u2019s head again when suddenly, Tae-Shik appeared at their door. \u00a0He asked, \u201cAre you guys all packed now?\u201dSurprised to see Tae-Shik here, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHyung?! Is it okay for the general manager to be away from his post this often? Don\u2019t your employees get annoyed that you\u2019re always away?\u201d\u201cWho would ever dare to cross me?! After all, I\u2019m Oh Tae-Shik! Oh Tae-Shik! Hahaha!\u201dIt seemed Tae-Shik was becoming sillier by the minute. Sung-Hoon climbed the stairs behind him and explained, \u201cThe association president asked you to return after you help with the moving, General Manager.\u201d\u201cThat old bastard\u2026\u201d muttered Tae-Shik.Because Gi-Gyu\u2019s family was leaving their old furniture behind, they just had to carry one large bag filled with their clothes. Gi-Gyu asked the two men, \u201cCould you go down and wait with Mother and Yoo-Jung for a minute?\u201d\u201cWhy? Aren't you coming?\u201d Tae-Shik asked.\u201cJust hurry up and go down. I\u2019ll be there shortly,\u201d Gi-Gyu insisted. After he made sure he was alone, he walked back inside. Then, he began ripping the floorboards under his mother\u2019s old bed. Underneath, there were several bank books with their respective PINs neatly written on the first pages; their purpose superscribed.-Yoo-Jung\u2019s tuition.-Mother\u2019s funeral cost.-Kim Gi-Gyu\u2019s funeral cost.Gi-Gyu picked up the bank books and placed them inside his bag with a bitter expression. Underneath the bankbooks were an envelope that had turned yellow from age.-Kim Gi-Gyu\u2019s will.Gi-Gyu burned this envelope and watched it with a faint smile. Just then, he heard Yoo-Jung calling for him from outside.\u201cOppa! Oppa! Hurry up!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d Gi-Gyu answered as he slammed the door behind him.Thud!Silently, he bid farewell to his old home and old life.It was his goodbye to poverty, pain, and sad memories.***\u201cUwaah! This is unbelievable! Are you sure this is our new home now?\u201d Yoo-Jung screamed as she exited the pink Tico. Standing before a large white gate, she continued, \u201cThis is crazy! Oppa! Mom! I can\u2019t believe this!\u201dSmack!When Gi-Gyu swatted his sister\u2019s head again, Yoo-Jung argued, \u201cOuch! Oppa! You\u2019re going to damage my brain and make me stupid!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Just get inside, Yoo-Jung.\u201d\u201cUwaah! This must really be our new home! Mom, hurry up!\u201dWatching Yoo-Jung with a smile, Tae-Shik got out of the car as well and said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cThe furniture is from me.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I got the furniture as a present for your family. I got only the best, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it.\u201d When Tae-Shik replied as if this was no big deal, Gi-Gyu scratched his head awkwardly and grumbled, \u201cYou know you didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201dThen, with a teasing grin, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t buy them thinking you\u2019ll also end up moving in soon, did you, Hyung?\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s face turned bright red as he gaped in surprise. With a quiet laugh, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cHaa\u2026 I think it\u2019s time for me to get started.\u201d\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asked Tae-Shik.\u201cI feel fine. I can tell my body is finally stabilizing.\u201dGi-Gyu could feel the improvement in his condition and abilities. He suspected that he could even climb several Tower floors without his Egos.Gi-Gyu murmured with hope, \u201cNow, if I can just level up\u2026 That will be the icing on the cake.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too high. I don\u2019t want you to be devastated if it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Tae-Shik warned. Gi-Gyu replied with a chuckle, \u201cI am not hopeful at all. By the way, I have a question, Hyung.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s expressions were so serious that Tae-Shik became curious.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cIt\u2019s about the fourth-floor guardian. Was it ever caught?\u201dTo his question, Tae-Shik returned an awkward look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34. First RevengeNoticing the awkward expression on Tae-Shik\u2019s face, Gi-Gyu asked with concern, \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cA problem\u2026 I guess you can call it that,\u201d replied Tae-Shik.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThe 4th-floor guardian\u2019s behavior is filled with anomalies. For starters, no guardian had ever left its habitat before it. And just recently, we discovered a troubling fact: the guardian is becoming stronger,\u201d explained Tae-Shik.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Gi-Gyu seemed dazed.\u2018Becoming stronger? What does Tae-Shik hyung mean by that?\u2019Tae-Shik continued, \u201cSo far, hundreds of players have fallen victim to that guardian. Several high-level hunting parties went out to kill it, but they haven\u2019t returned yet. Those groups were more than strong enough to take care of a single guardian on the 4th floor. Now\u2026 We can only assume that the guardian is becoming stronger. It is as if it\u2019s eating the players to level up.\u201d\u201c...\u201dA grave expression appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face as he murmured, \u201cI was wondering why I haven\u2019t heard anything about it. It turns out something like this was happening...\u201d\u201cI think these changes began with the exceptional gates. I\u2019ve seen guardians that were born strong, but I\u2019ve never seen one that could get stronger by killing players,\u201d Tae-Shik pondered out loud.Gi-Gyu had an old grudge against the 4th-floor guardian. Ever since their first encounter, he had been craving a rematch. But he always thought it was never going to happen. After all, it was only a 4th-floor guardian; the guardian-hunting guilds could hunt it easily. So, Gi-Gyu gave up on killing it a long time ago.He only asked Tae-Shik about it out of curiosity, so this was not the answer he was expecting.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cThe last hunting party that went after it was a C-grade subjugation squad. You can guess how strong they must\u2019ve been, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYet, no one from that group survived.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe what he had just heard. Usually, a C-grade hunting group had over 30 players, 60% of which were grade C. A grade C player referred to someone between levels 80 to 100. These players were strong enough to reach the Tower\u2019s 40th floor. In other words, they could even hunt the 30th-floor guardian.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why we are preparing to send a B-grade subjugation squad this time.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Catching the sparkles in Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, Tae-Shik asked as his lips curled up, \u201cWhy? Are you interested?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu with a bright smile.***Tae-Shik told Gi-Gyu before returning to the association, \u201cThis new subjugation squad will be formed within a week. Since it\u2019s a B-grade group, it\u2019ll take a while to organize everyone. None of the guilds are willing to go in because it\u2019s not worth their time. I should\u2019ve known that until the association offers a significant reward, that guardian will stay alive.\u201dAfter Tae-Shik left, Gi-Gyu murmured to himself, \u201cI get that it isn\u2019t worth their time, but how can they just sit back and relax while other players are dying like this?\u201dBut unfortunately, this was how the world worked. The guardian-hunting guilds profit by killing guardians and selling the drop items. Usually, these guardian-hunting guilds hunted guardians that lived on floors lower than their levels to minimize risk.But the 4th-floor guardian was a different story. The monster was located on such a low level that the items it might drop wouldn\u2019t be worth their time. It had eradicated a C-grade hunting party atop that, which meant the risk involved was too great.The risk-to-benefit ratio wasn\u2019t pleasing to the guilds.One might argue that the guardian might possess high-priced items since it had gotten much stronger. But this wasn\u2019t a chance any guild was willing to take. These guilds were essentially a business, and going after this 4th-floor guardian wasn\u2019t a wise decision.The best-case scenario was that a guild successfully killed this guardian and obtained some expensive items. But there was no guarantee that this would happen. Most likely, they would lose some of their guild members, and if they managed to kill the guardian, the drop items might only be 4th-floor level. This was a formula for great loss, not profit.So, the association assembled a subjugation squad when a particular guardian couldn\u2019t be destroyed for various reasons. In this case, it was because the guardian was too strong. The association even offered a prize for killing this kind of monster to entice players. This technique attracted many players who wanted the title of being the \u201cFirst\u201d to kill a unique type of guardian.Lou asked Gi-Gyu bluntly.-So you\u2019re gonna join this subjugation squad?\u201cYes. I\u2019ve wanted to test out my new body anyway. El has absorbed Calleon\u2019s power, so I want to test her and all the weapons I bought from Old Man Hwang. I was planning on doing all these tests in the Tower, but I think this might be a better way. Don\u2019t you agree?-You\u2019re so stubborn.Gi-Gyu could hear the disapproval in Lou\u2019s voice, but he was surprised at what Lou said next.-But I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201cMe too,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.-But my reason is different from yours.\u201cHuh? What is it?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu in confusion.-You went through way too much inside the Maze of Heryond. All the secrets you learned and the tortu- bad things that happened to you\u2026\u201cLou, I\u2019m fine. You can talk freely since I share all my thoughts with you guys anyway,\u201d Gi-Gyu reassured Lou. It seemed even his bratty Ego was concerned about how the Iron Guild tortured Gi-Gyu. Usually, Lou acted rude and cold, so Gi-Gyu felt touched by his unspoken concern.-Fine. Anyway, what I was trying to say is that you need to let it out every once in a while.\u201cLet it out? What do you mean?\u201d-Well, the elixir completely healed your physique, but what about your psyche? The stress, anger, and resentment you must\u2019ve gathered in that maze\u2026 You need to let it all out on something, and I believe that the fourth-floor guardian is a perfect target.\u201cThat\u2019s true. I wanted to get back at it for some time now. The only reason why I didn\u2019t act on it was that I thought it was already dead.\u201d Gi-Gyu agreed with Lou. This guardian drove Gi-Gyu into taking the fifth-floor test, which awakened his unique ability.Gi-Gyu leaned back on the chair and asked Lou, \u201cBut do you think I can kill it?\u201dGi-Gyu was much stronger than before, so he wasn\u2019t afraid. Also, he would have a subjugation squad to rely on and wouldn\u2019t have to face the monster alone. But this guardian supposedly destroyed a C-grade hunting group, so it had to be a tremendous monster.-Umm\u2026 I have no idea how strong that guardian is, so it\u2019s hard to say.-But I think you can take it down, Master.El, who had been quiet all this time, suddenly chimed in.\u201cEl?\u201d-The changes you experienced recently are remarkable, Master. I think you can feel confident about yourself.-Don\u2019t encourage him like that. What if he gets killed from being too cocky? If he dies, we\u2019ll die too, El.As usual, Lou was realistic, while El was optimistic. It looked like their argument would get out of hand, so Gi-Gyu stopped them.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you two.\u201d-Hmm\u2026-Of course, Master.Lou seemed unhappy about something, while El replied obediently like she always did. To appease Lou, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cEven if something happens, I like to think I\u2019m strong enough to escape a dangerous situation. Think about what happened in the Maze of Heryond. After what I had to go through there, do you think I can\u2019t handle a difficulty or two?\u201d-Talk is cheap.\u201cI\u2019m not going on this hunt to die. This isn\u2019t a suicide mission by any means. After what happened in the maze, I thought about many things. I decided that helping others is good, but not at the cost of my life. When I\u2019m inside the Tower or a gate, my survival is above everything. I\u2019ll protect myself at all costs.\u201dGi-Gyu realized this while he was being tortured. He decided then that this was how he would live from now on, even before he learned Soo-Jung was Lucifer. Saving others was a noble deed, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t plan on sacrificing himself to be a hero.Gi-Gyu was resting with closed eyes when Yoo-Jung yelled, \u201cOppa! Dinner\u2019s ready! And when are you going to buy me a puppy?\u201d\u201cStop thinking about bringing in even more change to this family for now. Let\u2019s just wait until we adapt to our new situation first, Yoo-Jung,\u201d Gi-Gyu advised his sister.\u201cHmph\u2026 Fine! Just hurry up and come out to eat dinner! Mom made bulgogi[1]\u00a0today! I'll eat your portion if you don\u2019t hurry up!\u201d She burst into Gi-Gyu\u2019s room without knocking and left with narrowed eyes and a cunning grin. Gi-Gyu was getting hungry anyway, so he decided to stop pondering about his situation.\u201cI\u2019m just glad she looks much happier now,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. Yoo-Jung had been quieter before, always worried about him and their mother. But now, his sister seemed much more relaxed. Gi-Gyu was relieved to see such a positive change in his sister.***Gi-Gyu spent a few more days with his family at home. He wanted the elixir\u2019s modifications to take effect completely before making any move. And today, El announced she had finished absorbing Calleon\u2019s power; it seemed the elixir was also done modifying his body.Admiring the outward changes to Gi-Gyu\u2019s appearance, Yoo-Jung exclaimed, \u201cUwaah, Oppa\u2026 You should quit being a player and become a celebrity. I usually don\u2019t like to compliment you, but you look so\u2026 dreamy.\u201dGi-Gyu had always been tall and fairly good-looking. But thanks to the elixir, Gi-Gyu\u2019s appearance has improved dramatically. He was already 180 cm before; now, he was close to 190 cm. His lean body, which never bulked up no matter how hard Gi-Gyu tried, was now hard with muscles. Gi-Gyu\u2019s skin used to look dry and wrinkled from stress and lack of sleep; now, his skin looked rejuvenated. Tae-Shik was a giant, so Gi-Gyu looked fragile when he stood before Tae-Shik. But now, they seemed equals.Feeling embarrassed, Gi-Gyu protested, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?! With that face, you could be a successful celebrity, making just as much money as a player!\u201d Yoo-Jung argued. She seemed quite serious about her suggestion, but Gi-Gyu had no plans to quit being a player. He knew his appearance had improved, but good looks were never enough to make it in the entertainment industry. Besides, if he quit being a player, he would face many problems. The biggest of all would probably be guaranteeing his family\u2019s safety. Unless he remained a player and became stronger, he and his family would never survive the inevitable future danger.\u2018I am certain that there will be many big changes in my life. I\u2019ve to be strong enough to protect my family through them.\u2019Gi-Gyu thought about all the things that could impact his life in the future. The exceptional gates, the changes in the Tower, the guardian who could level up, Lucifer, and Ironshield. These factors, if you will, would affect not only the players but also everyone else in the world. Gi-Gyu needed strength to protect his family in a future like that, and he could only do that as a player.\u201cWe just got our lives back, so I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.\u201cWhat, Oppa?\u201d\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t plan on quitting being a player, so don\u2019t mention it again.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to be in danger anymore. Then you should get me a bottle of elixir too! If you don\u2019t wanna be a celebrity, I will drink it and do it myself!\u201d Yoo-Jung insisted.\u201cWhat?\u201d When Gi-Gyu mockingly glared at his sister, Yoo-Jung covered her ears playfully and ran toward their mother.When she was out of sight, Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cIf I can, I do have to get her the elixir as well.\u201dThe elixir had significantly extended Gi-Gyu and their mother\u2019s lives. Since Yoo-Jung wasn\u2019t a player, her lifespan was bound to be shorter compared to a player.\u2018I can\u2019t let that happen to Yoo-Jung.\u2019Gi-Gyu felt determined to find another elixir if he ever got the chance.\u2018El, are you sure your power is fully stabilized now?\u2019-Yes, Master. I\u2019m ready.-I\u2019m the one in trouble now! My growth has been so slow! Go! Hunt monsters! Go! Hunt the damned monsters! I don\u2019t want to be weaker than stupid El!\u2018Fine, fine, Lou. I\u2019m going back to the Tower.\u2019***\u201cHyung, what happened to that subjugation squad?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu as he walked into Tae-Shik\u2019s office.\u201cOh my. Do we have a celebrity in our midst? I hardly recognize you, Gi-Gyu,\u201d Tae-Shik, who was doing some paperwork, greeted him with excitement.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not the only one noticing your looks. Don\u2019t you see those people over there?\u201d asked Tae-Shik as he pointed outside: Some female employees were working there. Gi-Gyu saw that some female employees were staring at him and whispering. Gi-Gyu blushed and muttered, \u201cI better start wearing a hat and a mask.\u201d\u201cUwaah\u2026 It\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re Su-Jin\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cStop it already. Just tell me about the new subjugation squad,\u201d Gi-Gyu insisted as he sat on the sofa. When Tae-Shik lowered the blinds to his office, the female workers all returned to their work.\u201cSo you\u2019re going to join the subjugation squad?\u201d Tae-Shik asked as he made some instant coffee.\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s a good idea in more than one way,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dGi-Gyu wasn\u2019t participating in the upcoming hunt just for his revenge, mental health, and testing out his newly improved body. He also wanted to study the other players\u2019 skills and abilities with his own eyes. When he worked as a guide, he guided many players who were now considered high-level players. However, the problem was, Gi-Gyu had never seen these high-level players at work. He never had the chance to witness how these strong players hunted inside the Tower. After watching what the high rankers could do in the Maze of Heryond, Gi-Gyu realized he didn\u2019t know much about other players. He understood the basics, but he had to really see them in action to comprehend their might. In other words, this was going to be his chance to learn about the other players. He knew he could estimate his own level in comparison by doing so.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik sat down in front of Gi-Gyu with a cup of coffee in his hand. He replied, \u201cI have no problem with you joining the subjugation squad. After all, I have a pretty good idea of how strong you are.\u201dDuring his recent break, Gi-Gyu occasionally sparred with Tae-Shik to see how strong he was becoming with each passing day due to the elixir. This was why Tae-Shik was aware of Gi-Gyu\u2019s improved strength.\u201cBut there is a problem, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cWhat problem?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he rose from the sofa.\u201cYou\u2026 won\u2019t be able to hunt even if you join the group. You\u2019ll probably have to go as a porter.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhat is Tae-Shik hyung talking about?\u2019\u201cUnofficially, we know that you\u2019ve SS level potential, but\u2026 you don\u2019t even have an official player credential,\u201d Tae-Shik explained.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu understood the issue immediately. Unofficially, he was an SS-grade player. This meant he could become a high ranker, making him a fairly strong player.But Gi-Gyu never received a proper player credential. The easiest way for a subjugation squad to calculate a player\u2019s strength was to look at their grade, level, potential, unique ability, and skills.Since this was a B-grade group, there was no way an ungraded player like Gi-Gyu would get a chance to participate in the actual battle. Unless, of course, in the unlikely event that every other member in the party died, and he was the only one left.Gi-Gyu pressed his temples in frustration and asked Tae-Shik, \u201cThen what should I do?\u201d1. Bulgogi, literally meaning \u201cfire meat\u201d in Korean, are thin marinated slices of beef or pork grilled on a barbecue or a stove top.\u00a0\u261cFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35. First Revenge (2)Tae-Shik replied, \u201cWell, there is a simple solution: Just get the player\u2019s credential. There shouldn\u2019t be any difference in your grade measurement, even if we use the newer machine. When you get tested officially, you'll still get the SS grade like before. Problem solved.\u201dGi-Gyu knew this was the most obvious answer to his problem, but he murmured, \u201cBut if I do that, then\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to become famous?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu. Receiving the SS grade meant that he could become a high ranker. The appearance of a new SS-grade player would attract much attention from the entire world, not just Korea.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI assume the Iron Guild already knows about me, so there wouldn\u2019t be much security difference, but I still don\u2019t want to be recognized yet. I\u2019m already getting some unwanted attention because of my looks, so can you imagine if people found out I was an SS-grade player?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll become a celebrity,\u201d replied Tae-Shik with a nod.\u201cAnd I won\u2019t be the only one under the spotlight. People will soon become interested in my family and put them under a microscope.\u201dTae-Shik contemplated for a while before he said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cThen I\u2019m afraid there is nothing I can do. Even the association\u2019s general manager can\u2019t give a player a fake grade willy-nilly.\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for that, Hyung. You have already helped my family and me so much. I could never ask you for more.\u201dTae-Shik was the association\u2019s general manager, but even he didn\u2019t have the power to give out fake player credentials. This was incredibly impossible since an officially registered player credential came with many benefits.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAny other solutions?\u201d\u201cThere is another obvious one: Just join the guild that will take the lead or participate in this upcoming hunt. Or you could also join the association,\u201d Tae-Shik answered, taking this opportunity to emphasize the association\u2019s power.Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly and replied, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to work under someone. Also, creating my own group is out of the question.\u201d\u201cGosh\u2026 You\u2019re so picky. Oh, that\u2019s right. Wait here for a minute.\u201d Tae-Shik walked toward his computer and typed apace as he continued, \u201cI knew it. Kim Sun-Pil, was it? Yes, that\u2019s his guild\u2026 Gi-Gyu, his guild is also planning to participate in this subjugation hunt.\u201d\u201cKim Sun-Pil?\u201d\u201cYeah. Do you remember those players you guided when you ended up being cornered by the fourth-floor guardian? That\u2019s the only reason why I remember their names. I knew I saw their names on the subjugation squad list,\u201d Tae-Shik explained.Much time had passed since that day, but he still couldn\u2019t believe Kim Sun-Pil\u2019s guild had grown strong enough to participate in a B-grade subjugation hunt. When Tae-Shik noticed Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, he explained, \u201cThey are actually grade C, not B. His group is going as one of the spare forces, so it would be better for you to go with them. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try contacting them? They owe you one, so I\u2019m sure they will take you with them,\u201d Tae-Shik suggested, giving Gi-Gyu much to think about.After a short silence, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhen does the subjugation squad head out?\u201d\u201cThe day after tomorrow. You don\u2019t have much time, so if you\u2019re going to go with them, you better get on it.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thank you.\u201dGi-Gyu left the room and began looking through his contacts.\u2018Umm\u2026\u2019Kim Sun-Pil had given Gi-Gyu his phone number when Gi-Gyu was hospitalized before.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed before pressing the dial button.When Gi-Gyu left the association building, all the female employees gathered inside Tae-Shik\u2019s office. Tae-Shik asked coldly, \u201cWhat do you want? Do you guys have something to tell me?\u201d\u201cWho was that guy? He looked so handsome. General Manager, please introduce him to me. I\u2019ll work really hard if you do,\u201d asked one of the female employees.\u201cNo way! You should introduce him to me! Please!\u201d another woman begged.\u201cHe looked close to you, General Manager, which means he must be someone important. So, out of respect for you, I'd also like to meet him,\u201d said the third female employee.Tae-Shik grinned. He was the general manager, their boss. Yet, his employees felt comfortable enough to ask him such a thing because he had always acted friendly with them.Slowly, Tae-Shik\u2019s face turned serious as he groaned, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201dNoticing the change in his expression, the female employees all took a few steps back. They were afraid their boss would nag them about getting back to work.But instead, Tae-Shik replied mysteriously, \u201cIf you\u2019re curious about him, why don\u2019t you all make a guess? I\u2019ll give you a hint: You\u2019ve all seen him here before. Many times at that.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d***\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me sooner? I was so worried something might have happened to you,\u201d Sun-Pil asked with concern as they sat inside a 24-hour cafe near the Gangnam station. Gi-Gyu was wearing a cheap hat and a black mask; despite the disguise, one could tell he was a handsome man because of his aura. The people sitting nearby couldn\u2019t help glancing at him, wondering if he was a celebrity.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cSomething came up, so I was swamped. By the way, I finally began to level up.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Sun-Pil looked impressed as he replied, \u201cThen you must\u2019ve been busy hunting in the Tower until now.\u201d\u201cWell, yes, I suppose.\u201d A lot more had happened than just hunting. Gi-Gyu had been inside the Maze of Heryond, where he met several high rankers. He witnessed the corps commander being killed and even obtained the elixir. But Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t think Sun-Pil would believe him even if he told him about everything.\u201cSo, what is it that you wanted to ask me? My group owes you so much, guide Kim Gi-Gyu. Without you, we would\u2019ve all died in the Tower that day. You saved us all; we owe you big time.\u201d Sun-Pil smiled widely before teasing, \u201cOur lives are worth quite a lot now. I would be happy to give you anything you ask, Gi-Gyu.\u201dGi-Gyu smiled as well as he asked, \u201cWell, it\u2019s about the upcoming fourth-floor guardian hunt. I heard your guild is joining the subjugation squad. Your guild\u2019s name is Morningstar, right?\u201d\u201cHuh?! How did you know?\u201d Sun-Pil seemed genuinely shocked.\u201cI am interested in the upcoming hunt as well, so I was doing some research and came across your guild\u2019s name. I believe you\u2019re the Morningstar\u2019s guild master?\u201d\u201cIndeed. So you\u2019re interested in the subjugation expedition too?\u201d Sun-Pil asked, his eyes glowing knowingly.\u201cYes. I owe a lot to that guardian, after all.\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s exactly why we are participating in this hunt. Considering what that bastard did to you\u2026 And it also put us in grave danger at the time. We haven\u2019t forgotten that day at all.\u201d Listening to Sun-Pil\u2019s excited voice, Gi-Gyu realized he probably wouldn\u2019t have difficulty convincing Sun-Pil.Gi-Gyu smiled and asked, \u201cSo, about that\u2026 I haven\u2019t obtained a player credential yet due to some personal matters. I also don\u2019t belong to a guild, so would it be possible for me to enter this upcoming hunt as a part of Morningstar?\u201dGi-Gyu knew he was asking for a huge favor. Joining and leaving a guild wasn\u2019t an easy process. A guild was not like a school club that accepted all students. It was essentially a business organization created to reap profit, making its reputation a critical factor. Most guilds were picky in accepting new members, and a high player retention level was considered a great asset. Most players wouldn\u2019t quit if their guild was powerful and they were treated well.And then there was the well-known fact: Guilds made leaving their organization as hard as possible for players. In other words, Gi-Gyu asked Sun-Pil to let him join Morningstar for the hunt and leave right after it. The moment Gi-Gyu quit, he would negatively affect the Morningstar Guild\u2019s statistics. As a newly formed guild, this could be a huge hit.But Sun-Pil answered without hesitation, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cIf this will damage your guild\u2019s reputation, you can say no. Please, think carefu\u2014\u201d Gi-Gyu tried to ask again for surety.\u201cIt\u2019s really fine. If I can\u2019t even do a small favor like this for you, I deserved to die that day at the hands of the guardian,\u201d Sun-Pil answered firmly and continued, \u201cSince that day, I\u2019ve worked my butt off. I wanted to make sure I was strong enough never to need someone else\u2019s help. I also wanted to become stronger, so I could save others like you did.\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling embarrassed as Sun-Pil idolized him.\u2018Sun-Pil, I\u2019m not that good of a person. You\u2019re mistaken.\u2019Hiding his honest thoughts, Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly. Unlike before, he now had too much to lose. Now, he had much to accomplish and protect. With stakes this high, he wouldn\u2019t even think about sacrificing himself for others.Sun-Pil added proudly, \u201cThat\u2019s why I formed a guild soon after. After grinding day in and day out, I succeeded in becoming a C-grade player with a C-grade guild under him.\u201d\u201cYou should be proud of yourself,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with genuine admiration. Becoming a C-grade player and establishing a C-grade guild within a few months were almost impossible tasks. When Gi-Gyu worked as Sun-Pil\u2019s guide, he could tell Sun-Pil was talented. But, talent alone could never achieve something like this. Gi-Gyu could almost see how hard Sun-Pil must\u2019ve worked to get here. This realization made Gi-Gyu like him even more.Sun-Pil announced, \u201cWe will help you in every way possible this time, so please feel free to rely on us. We will do our best to help you get your revenge.\u201dThen, Sun-Pil and Gi-Gyu concluded their meeting with a handshake. Gi-Gyu had been worried about how he was going to join the hunt; fortunately, he found an easy fix.\u201cBy the way, did something happen? If not for your voice, I wouldn\u2019t have recognized you. And why are you wearing a hat and a mask? You also look a little taller,\u201d asked Sun-Pil as he studied Gi-Gyu.\u201cUmm\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll tell you about it later,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied as he pressed down his hat to hide his face a little better.***A day before the hunt, Gi-Gyu completed registering himself as a Morningstar member.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered as he rubbed his chin in concern.-It can\u2019t be helped. You know what actually wouldn\u2019t have made sense? Had everything gone the way you were expecting.Lou replied coldly as Gi-Gyu sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThere was a good reason behind Gi-Gyu's frustration. He just discovered that he couldn\u2019t wear/utilize normal equipment items. In the past, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t afford any of these expensive items. But now that he had some money to spare, he was planning on wearing a few pieces of cheap equipment for this hunt.But every time he put on an item, the system announced.[You cannot wear this equipment item.]When Gi-Gyu seemed confused, Lou finally explained.-It\u2019s probably because you\u2019re wearing two pseudo and two real Egos. Most average equipment items can\u2019t tolerate an Ego\u2019s power, which means you can\u2019t wear them as long as you have us. Of course, it would\u2019ve been a different story if you had a legendary grade item.\u201cA legendary grade item?\u201dThere was only one legendary-grade weapon Gi-Gyu knew about.\u201cSo you\u2019re talking about something like the Archangel\u2019s Armor player Lee Sun-Ho has.\u201d-I don\u2019t know what that is, but if that item has a legendary grade, then yes.In the end, Gi-Gyu had to give up on wearing equipment items to the hunt.-You should be thankful that the elixir\u2019s modification now allows you to wear more than three Egos. Right now, you\u2019re wearing four Egos. Be grateful for that.Lou was becoming more and more annoying. Gi-Gyu considered giving him another lesson on manners, but he shook his head and murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s true that Egos are the strongest weapon I can carry.\u201dIt was an undeniable truth; Gi-Gyu knew it.\u201cThen, I guess I\u2019m ready for the hunt.\u201dHe had already prepared the disposable items. It was too bad he couldn\u2019t wear any equipment items, but he had to accept. He had no say in the matter since it was the price he had to pay for owning Egos.Now, he was ready to join the hunt tomorrow. When he closed his eyes, he could imagine how things would unfold during the hunt. This was his first time joining a subjugation squad. He was going to be reunited with Kim Sun-Pil and the others. He would also get to meet some other members of the Morningstar Guild.In addition, he would be amid many other guilds and players who were also participating in the hunt.\u201cI\u2019m coming for you, guardian.\u201dGi-Gyu quickly fell asleep.***\u201cIs everyone from the Morningstar Guild here?\u201d \u00a0Kim Dong-Hae from the Child Guild, who was to lead the subjugation squad, asked the group.\u201cYes!\u201d answered the Morningstar members.Kim Dong-Hae was a famous member of the Child Guild, a B-grade group. He was considered a semi-ranker because he was very close to reaching the A-grade. All players A-grade or higher were considered a ranker. The Child Guild, a mediocre group at best, grew to be recognizable thanks to Kim Dong-Hae. The rumor had it that Kim Dong-Hae was their guild master\u2019s favorite. In fact, people believed the only reason Child Guild\u2019s guild master was running the guild was to help Kim Dong-Hae level up faster.Yun Jae-Won, standing next to Gi-Gyu, whispered, \u201cWow! I knew he would be in this group, but I\u2019m still relieved to see such a big player is going to join us.\u201dEveryone in the group Gi-Gyu guided that day was here to participate in the hunt. It had been a long time since Gi-Gyu last saw them, so they greeted each other with genuine pleasure.Gi-Gyu asked with curiosity, \u201cHe\u2019s considered a big player?\u201d\u201cKim Dong-Hae? Of course. After all, he\u2019s almost a ranker now, \" Jae-Won, standing nearby, replied in surprise.Suddenly, Gi-Gyu realized what was happening.\u2018Ahh\u2026 now I see. I\u2019ve met so many high rankers that a semi-ranker doesn\u2019t seem like much anymore.\u2019He had met the real beasts in the Maze of Heryond, so now, no one seemed to impress Gi-Gyu.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jae-Won asked.\u201cI just feel a little bitter about something,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.In the past, had Gi-Gyu met a semi-ranker, he would\u2019ve been impressed and excited. But, after experiencing so many life-changing events, he could no longer connect with his previous innocence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36. First Revenge (3)The subjugation group set out after a simple headcount. Gi-Gyu was new to the whole \u201cdeducing-a-player\u2019s-level-by-his-aura\u201d thingy, but he tried his best to estimate everyone\u2019s level.\u2018Looks like quite a lot of strong players have participated in this hunt.\u2019The elixir had also improved his ability to sense others\u2019 energy and aura, so Gi-Gyu was now better at guessing the other players\u2019 levels. He was certainly not as good as the players in the support category, but his instinct was fairly accurate.After watching Gi-Gyu with curiosity for a while, Jae-Won asked, \u201cGuide, you seem much taller now. Did something happen? And why are you wearing a ski mask?\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201d Gi-Gyu wore a full cloth mask all day to avoid any unwanted attention. He had forgotten all about it. Now that he was inside the Tower, he slowly took it off.\u201c...\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe surroundings suddenly quietened down when Gi-Gyu\u2019s face came to light. It was as if the entire hunting party paused for a moment. Gi-Gyu felt like all the female players, some male ones too, were staring at him.After seeing his face, Sun-Pil, Ha-Neul, and Jae-Won murmured various interpretations of \u201cWow\u201d and \u201cAmazing.\u201d\u201cGuide?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Guide Gi-Gyu, right?\u201dTheir faces were filled with surprise and disbelief.Sun-Pil asked cautiously, \u201cSo when you said you\u2019ve been busy, you meant you were getting plastic surgery\u2026?\u201dShaking his head, Gi-Gyu replied smoothly, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. After I passed the fifth-floor test that day, I obtained a job. I think this is one of the effects of the skill I got from my job.\u201dDuring his recent vacation, Gi-Gyu spent some time crafting a plausible explanation for his outward transformation. Finally, he decided to just dump it on his mysterious and never-to-be-known \u201cskill.\u201d Unless someone used the detection skill on him, no one would doubt his explanation.\u2018Most people will accept any anomaly if it\u2019s connected to a skill.\u2019This lie, no. This explanation, was a way to divert attention, but it seemed to be doing the opposite.\u201cJust what kind of skill is it that could\u2026 Handsome? How?\u201d Ha-Neul whispered in shock.\u201cI want it too! If only I could change my job!\u201d Jae-Won howled in desperation. The subjugation group became flabbergasted by Gi-Gyu\u2019s change at first; soon, the players continued as if nothing had happened.The other players inside the Tower watched the subjugation party with admiration and envy. This specially formed group included high-level players who, usually, weren\u2019t seen on the 4th floor. Thus, these experienced hunters were bound to look like idols to the newbies on the tutorial floors.Any orcs and goblins that stood in the subjugation party\u2019s path suffered quick deaths.\u2018I couldn\u2019t ascend to the higher floors for five years because of these lowly monsters.\u2019Gi-Gyu reminisced about his days as an association guide. He was now strong enough to kill these weak monsters with one finger. But for his first five years as a player, these creatures had made his life miserable.Sun-Pil seemed to be reminiscing too as he murmured, \u201cIt feels like only yesterday when we were roaming this area with you. But it has been a long time since that day, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dAs the party approached the area where the fourth-floor guardian first appeared, Ha-Neul muttered, \u201cWe almost died that day.\u201dWith a nod, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThat day, we were indeed being hunted; today, we will hunt it down.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Sun-Pil answered enthusiastically.\u201cWow, you haven\u2019t changed, guide! Still as amazing as ever!\u201d When Jae-Won exclaimed loudly, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI\u2019m not a guide anymore; please feel free to use my name. And you don\u2019t have to speak so formally with me.\u201dWhen the Morningstar members kept calling Gi-Gyu \u201cguide,\u201d the other members of the subjugation team began showing him even more interest. The more eyes were on him, the more discomfort Gi-Gyu felt. This was a problem because he didn\u2019t want any attention on him.Sun-Pil suggested, \u201cThen you should loosen up around us and speak informally too!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. After all, you\u2019re the oldest among us, so we would feel more comfortable if you treated us more familiarly,\u201d Jae-Won insisted.Gi-Gyu was the same age as Suk-Woo, Sun-Pil\u2019s cousin. Since Sun-Pil was a year younger than his cousin, he was also a year younger than Gi-Gyu. All the other members were the same age as Sun-Pil, which meant Gi-Gyu was older than all of them.With a nod, Gi-Gyu dropped all formalities and replied, \u201cThen shall I drop all formalities, guys?\u201d\u00a0It wasn\u2019t Gi-Gyu\u2019s style to speak so familiarly with people he didn\u2019t know very well. But, dragging this conversation longer than necessary was bound to attract more attention, so he just caved.Immediately, the other guild members smiled and replied, \u201cYes, Hyung!\u201d\u201cSounds good, Oppa!\u201dWith a satisfied smile, Gi-Gyu answered, \u201cNow, that\u2019s much better.\u201d\u201cPlease get ready, Everyone! This is the first place the guardian frequents, so we will begin tracking it!\u201d The leader of the subjugation group Kim Dong-Hae announced loudly. Usually, guardians rarely left their inhabited areas, but this fourth-floor guardian was different. The psychometric skill was best when it came to tracking a specific monster, so various players with that skill were brought to this hunt.While the support players examined the scene using their psychometric skill, the other players sat down on the ground in groups to rest. The members of the Morningstar Guild did the same.Because they had decided to drop the formality, Gi-Gyu and the other members now felt more comfortable chatting.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cBy the way, why did you name your guild Morningstar?\u201d\u201cThat was because of you, Hyung,\u201d Jae-Won replied while chewing on a piece of jerky.\u201cBecause of me?\u201d\u201cYes. According to Sun-Pil, you were shining like the early morning star when you came to our rescue. We thought he was being too corny. But Sun-Pil insisted, so we agreed to it.\u201d When Jae-Won explained, Kim Sun-Pil blushed and shouted, \u201cHey! Yun Jae-Won! Just shut up!\u201dAfter hearing the reason behind the guild\u2019s name, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help blushing too. Turning toward him, Sun-Pil explained, \u201cPlease don\u2019t feel awkward or burdened by it. At the time, you were a player with no abilities or skills, right?\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and agreed, \u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cDespite being the weakest back then, you still volunteered to leave that cave with that firecracker. It was a perilous situation, yet you went out without hesitation. So what if you knew the area? It was still a dangerous decision. I found your valor so inspiring that I had to name my guild after you, Hyung.\u201d When Sun-Pil explained shyly, Jae-Won teased him, \u201cUwaah! Kim Sun-Pil! That was so touching!\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d Gi-Gyu was genuinely touched. He told Sun-Pil, \u201cI had no idea you thought so highly of me. Thank you so much for everything. I\u2019m also grateful to you for letting me join this hunting party.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all, Hyung. It was my pleasure,\u201d replied Sun-Pil.Gi-Gyu was genuinely thankful to the Morningstar members. A big part of why he joined this subjugation party was his mental health. Even though he hadn\u2019t seen the guardian yet, he could already feel his psyche healing. He realized that perhaps saving someone\u2019s life wasn\u2019t such a bad thing after all.Suddenly, a nearby group spat toward the Morningstar members, \u201cWhat\u2019s with them? Do they think they\u2019re on a picnic or something? What are they babbling about?\u201dTheir denunciation wasn\u2019t too loud, but the players here had high enough levels to hear it. There was no way Gi-Gyu and the other members of the Morningstar couldn\u2019t hear them. When the Morningstar group turned toward the other group, one of the annoyed players shouted, \u201cAm I wrong? You think you\u2019re something because of your looks, but we are inside the Tower. Here, being strong trumps everything.\u201dGi-Gyu turned toward them and recognized their guild.\u2018Brother Guild.\u2019This male-only group was the most renowned macho group of them all. All the players were muscular with short hairstyles. But Gi-Gyu did not consider them an accurate representation of manliness.\u2018Tae-Shik hyung is.\u2019To Gi-Gyu, only someone with Tae-Shik\u2019s appearance and character was worthy of the title: Macho.As the leader of the Morningstar Guild, Sun-Pil rose quickly and shouted at the Brother Guild members, \u201cWhat did you just say? You better apologize right now!\u201d\u201cWhy should we? Wanna fight us? You must think you\u2019re something just because we let you in this B-grade subjugation party; you need to know your place. If the guardian appears, weaklings like you would be dead in a minute,\u201d one of the Brother Guild members warned.The loud member of Brother Guild and Sun-Pil glared at each other menacingly. Trying to break up their fight, Ha-Neul whispered to Sun-Pil, \u201cOppa, just let it go.\u201dSimilarly, the other members of Brother Guild stood up to stop their rude player. \u201cHey, stop it already.\u201dWhile both groups were at a standstill, Kim Dong-Hae shouted, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?!\u201dWhen Sun-Pil and the Brother Guild member heard and felt the semi-ranker\u2019s vicious energy, they immediately replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. Just a moment ago, he felt so much better, but that annoying player ruined everything.***The subjugation group resumed marching after Kim Dong-Hae\u2019s shout resolved the minor kerfuffle. The atmosphere was a little tense because the players with psychometric skills had found a trace of the guardian. It was time to search for their target again.Jae-Won frowned as he muttered, \u201cGosh, that dude is so annoying.\u201dHe was frustrated because he noticed the rude member of Brother Guild was still glaring at Gi-Gyu. When the argument first erupted, Jae-Won was trying to calm down Sun-Pil. However, that player\u2019s constant glare toward Gi-Gyu was now becoming irritating. Jae-Won was just about to explode in anger when Jae-Won mumbled loudly, \u201cThey always talk about loyalty, but it looks like their specialty is picking fights with random strangers.\u201dBrother Guild was a rather famous group. It barely reached the B grade, but its members\u2019 unique appearance made it well known. Brother Guild was also noted for prioritizing loyalty above everything else.So, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling disappointed in this guild. With a small smile, he said to Jae-Won, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 You\u2019re too nice, Hyung.\u201dOf course, no one in the Morningstar noticed how dark Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes had turned.-Master, you need to calm down. Please.-Haa\u2026 Why are you having such difficulty controlling your emotions?Gi-Gyu shook his head in confusion after hearing his Egos.\u2018Why am I feeling this way?\u2019That guy was undoubtedly annoying, but that shouldn\u2019t have been enough to make Gi-Gyu this angry.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s PTSD?\u2019He wondered if something happened to his personality after being tortured by Ironshield. Deep in thought, Gi-Gyu padded as he followed the group; soon, Kim Dong-Hae raised his fist. He quietly announced, \u201cPause. Get ready. I think the guardian is just ahead of us.\u201dThe entire group suddenly froze at Kim Dong-Hae\u2019s message. Everyone here knew the fourth-floor guardian was no ordinary monster. Even though it was the guardian of the lowly 4th floor, the experienced players readied themselves as if they were about to fight a treacherous foe.Unfortunately, the annoying member of Brother Guild muttered loudly, \u201cHmph! It\u2019s only the 4th-floor guardian. Our guild should be enough to kill it.\u201dHis comment was unwelcomed, not only by the Morningstar players but also everyone else. Jae-Won finally couldn\u2019t stop himself and shouted, \u201cIf you think you\u2019re so strong, why don\u2019t you run out and fight it on your own?! No one here will stop you.\u201d\u201cWhat? What did you say, you bastard?\u201d the player from Brother Guild swore at Jae-Won.\u201cI said\u2014\u201d Jae-Won was about to argue when suddenly, everyone heard a subdued order.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dEveryone, even the Brother Guild member who seemed ready to kill, stopped when they heard the shout. Surprisingly, this shout didn\u2019t come from Kim Dong-Hae; he did plan on stopping the loud duo, though.To everyone\u2019s surprise, the shout came from Gi-Gyu. His eyes were devoid of all emotions as a strange haze wafted around him. His emotionless gaze fell on the Brother Guild member as he said, \u201cYou have been trying to pick a fight with us since the first break. If this continues, this party will fail to work effectively as a team. You\u2019re causing too much trouble here.\u201d\u201cS-so what?! You\u2019re obviously younger than me; how dare you be so disrespectful to me?!\u201d stammered the Brother Guild member. A single shout had shaken him to his core: The embarrassment was crushing. His voice was getting louder; it was apparent he was trying to mask his embarrassment.Gi-Gyu replied calmly, \u201cYou were the one who disrespected me first.\u201dRealizing he was going to get nowhere, Gi-Gyu called for Kim Dong-Hae.\u201cHaa\u2026 Captain Kim Dong-Hae?\u201dSince Kim Dong-Hae was this group\u2019s leader, addressing him as \u201ccaptain\u201d was the proper etiquette. Kim Dong-Hae watched Gi-Gyu with obvious interest as he asked, \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf we go on our hunt like this, we might have an accident. I think it would be best if we resolve this situation right now. What do you think?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked politely.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Kim Dong-Hae pondered.\u201cFine! Dammit! Let\u2019s do this! I\u2019ll show you what a real man can do, Pretty Boy!\u201d the Brother Guild member shouted, making Kim Dong-Hae frown. The player from Brother Guild was indeed crossing the line. And As Gi-Gyu mentioned, bad blood between the players could lead to an accident.Turning towards Gi-Gyu again, Kim Dong-Hae asked, \u201cBut will you be alright?\u201dMorningstar was a C-grade guild, while Brother Guild was B-grade. Kim Dong-Hae had also studied each players\u2019 abilities and levels before coming to this hunt. Therefore, such a question was a reasonable one.Gi-Gyu answered confidently, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cBut Hyung! That guy is B-grade,\u201d Jae-Won warned.\u201cOppa\u2026\u201d Ha-Neul seemed worried as well.But it was Sun-Pil who stopped Jae-Won and Ha-Neul. Instead of trying to stop Gi-Gyu, Sun-Pil said encouragingly with a wink, \u201cI think I know you enough to realize you\u2019ll find a way, Hyung. Please make the Morningstar name proud.\u201dAccepting Sun-Pil\u2019s words with a nod, Gi-Gyu smiled and asked the Brother Guild member, \u201cSo, are you interested?\u201d\u201cOf course! Pretty boy! I will cut your face up, and then you\u2019ll have a reason to walk around with a mask on! Just don\u2019t cry like a baby afterward!\u201d When the annoying Brother Guild member announced, his colleagues laughed, \u201cHahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201dKim Dong-Hae acted as the referee for this fight and laid out the rules after gathering the fighters.\u201cWe still have a guardian to hunt, so don\u2019t use any weapons. One of you surrenders; the fight's over. Got it?\u201dInterested, all the other players of the subjugation party formed a circle around the two fighters. This was a fight between a B-grade and a C-grade. Based on the difference in grades, one would think this wouldn\u2019t be much of a fight. But the grade wasn\u2019t the only determining factor in a player\u2019s strength. Various factors like synergy in combos, stats, and equipment items could change the flow of a battle.With so many variables to consider, the players couldn\u2019t help watching the fight with genuine interest. Even Kim Dong-Hae seemed interested, as he allowed a fight right before such an important hunt.In addition, Kim Dong-Hae believed this could relieve the members\u2019 stress and heighten their excitement.Morningstar was following as a spare guild. And although Brother Guild was part of the main hunting party, it wasn\u2019t much stronger than the Morningstar Guild.\u2018Something about him...\u2019Kim Dong-Hae thought as he studied Gi-Gyu. The energy he felt from Gi-Gyu was a memorable one; he suspected Gi-Gyu had a secret weapon.The players of Brother Guild cheered for their members excitedly.\u201cKill him!\u201d\u201cGood-looking men must all die!\u201d\u201cMacho all the way!\u201dShaking her face in disgust, Ha-Neul muttered, \u201cI was wondering why they were trying to pick a fight with us. Now I know why. They were jealous of Gi-Gyu oppa\u2019s looks. Idiots.\u201dJust as the fight was about to begin, Gi-Gyu slowly turned toward his opponent and asked, \u201cBy the way, a fight is no fun if there is no bet involved. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cA bet?\u201d When the Brother member asked in confusion, Gi-Gyu taunted, \u201cWhy? Are you afraid you might lose?\u201d\u201cHa! You idiot! Name your bet! I don\u2019t care!\u201dWith a satisfied smile, Gi-Gyu suggested, \u201cIf I win, your guild must quit from this hunt and let the Morningstar Guild take your place instead. If you win, you can do whatever you want to me. What would you like? You can cut my face or even kill me. Do whatever you wish.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu smirked, his opponent thought Gi-Gyu was laughing at him. The Brother Guild member shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure your pretty face can never smile again.\u201dGi-Gyu turned toward Kim Dong-Hae and asked, \u201cCaptain Kim Dong-Hae, will you be our witness?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe Brother Guild and the Morningstar Guild had the same strength, so no one would miss them during the hunt. But excluding an entire guild from the party could be problematic. So, Kim Dong-Hae proposed a compromise, \u201cIf Player Kim Gi-Gyu wins, the Morningstar Guild will switch places with the Brother Guild. The Morningstar Guild will participate in the main group, and the Brother Guild will become a spare force.\u201dGi-Gyu smiled and replied, \u201cThat sounds acceptable.\u201dUnlike the Morningstar Guild, where some of its members tried to stop Gi-Gyu out of concern, none of the Brother Guild\u2019s members stopped this player from participating in this fight. Was it because this rude player was one of the high-ranking members of the group? Did every member of the Brother Guild believe their comrade would win?Meanwhile, Jae-Won murmured, \u201cHas Gi-Gyu hyung always been like this?\u201dHa-Neul, just as worried, asked, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we stop him?\u201dBut it was too late to stop the fight. Taking a step back, Kim Dong-Hae announced officially, \u201cYou may begin.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37. First Revenge (4)Gi-Gyu grinned as the fight began.\u2018This worked out perfectly.\u2019He had succeeded in temporarily joining the Morningstar Guild to participate in this hunt. But unfortunately, Sun-Pil\u2019s guild was only C-grade. Since it was a spare force, Gi-Gyu suspected he wouldn\u2019t get a chance to fight the guardian head-on.\u2018Then again, the guardian\u2019s newfound strength could force everyone into the battlefield, even the spare force. But that\u2019s just a possibility. If I can get the Morningstar Guild into the main party, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get my fill of the guardian.\u2019And the permission to pummel this annoying macho was a bonus for Gi-Gyu. It was what you call a win-win situation.Gi-Gyu and the macho eyed and circled each other as they looked for an opening. The macho was trying his best to hide it, but he was confused as hell right now. It was true that his guild barely managed to pass as a B-grade, but Morningstar Guild was only a C-grade guild at best. He only picked a fight with Gi-Gyu because he was confident his group was much stronger. However, he was shocked by how calm and carefree Gi-Gyu looked.\u2018Is he smiling?\u2019Indeed, Gi-Gyu was smiling at him. It was a refreshing smile, but the macho could feel an ominous feeling creeping up on him.\u2018There is no room for mistakes,\u2019\u00a0the macho thought nervously.He was a B-grade player fighting a C-grade player, but a higher grade didn\u2019t guarantee a win in a battle like this. But one\u2019s level did. After all, higher levels and grades usually came with higher abilities, more experience, and better skills. Therefore, the macho believed he had an excellent chance of winning this.\u201cDammit!\u201d swore the Brother Guild member, unable to shake off the bad feeling.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to attack?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he playfully gestured toward his opponent. Despite Gi-Gyu\u2019s taunt, the Brother Guild member stood straight as if he was stuck.\u201cHaa\u2026 If you aren\u2019t going to make the first move, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured and then sprinted. Lou and El were on his waist in their sword form. With the boost he got from the elixir and his recently purchased pseudo Egos, Gi-Gyu\u2019s was faster than ever before.Whack!A loud thud rang inside the forest. When Gi-Gyu\u2019s fist planted straight on his opponent\u2019s face, the players surrounding the two fighters exclaimed, \u201cWhat the heck?!\u201d\u201cWhat was that just now?!\u201dBefore the macho could even deliver a single attack, he was sent flying and fainted outside the circle.\u201cEnough!\u201d Kim Dong-Hae raised his hand to announce the end of the fight. His voice rang as he yelled, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu from Morningstar Guild is the winner. Any objections?\u201dWhen no one said a word, Kim Dong-Hae grinned.\u2018I didn\u2019t think so\u2026\u2019No one could deny that Gi-Gyu won the fight fair and square. Even Kim Dong-Hae barely managed to see Gi-Gyu\u2019s rapid attack just now. It was just that fast and accurate. The captain watched Gi-Gyu with interest, but Gi-Gyu had no idea what Kim Dong-Hae was thinking. All he did was stand with a blank look on his face.Everyone remained dazed until the Morningstar Guild\u2019s players cheered, \u201cUwaah! Hyung! I knew you could do it!\u201d\u201cThis is crazy\u2026!\u201dMeanwhile, the Brother Guild\u2019s players carried their own and moved to the back of the party. Watching them without any sympathy, Kim Dong-Hae announced, \u201cNow that everything\u2019s settled, Brother Guild will not be joining the main hunting party. With a player like that, I think Morningstar will be more helpful than Brother Guild anyway. Anyone has a problem with that?\u201d\u201cNone,\u201d a member of the Kindergarten Guild replied. It was common knowledge that the Kindergarten Guild was close to the Child Guild, which was why it joined this subjugation party.\u201cThen we will begin the hunt in an hour. Try to be in your peak condition for that,\u201d ordered Kim Dong-Hae before returning to his place.Gi-Gyu walked up to the other Morningstar players and sat down. Unable to hide their awe, the players asked, \u201cUwaah\u2026 Awesome! Just what happened during the last few months, Hyung?\u201d\u201cI wanna know your level! What level are you?!\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026 We thought we became strong pretty fast, but you, Hyung\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu answered their questions with a smile and suggested, \u201cWe should get ready too. Now that we\u2019ll be joining the fight at the front, we can\u2019t let our guards down. We need to be more prepared than any other group.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Sun-Pil replied confidently. Although Gi-Gyu was only a year older, Sun-Pil found him to be someone he could idolize.\u2018Gi-Gyu hyung is incredible.\u2019Suk-Woo was Sun-Pil\u2019s idol too, but even Suk-Woo never affected Sun-Pil the way Gi-Gyu did. Gi-Gyu was kind and strong, yet he also possessed cold logic and flexibility. It seemed that Gi-Gyu had all the qualities a great player was supposed to have. Then, Sun-Pil began preparing for the hunt with a newfound respect for Gi-Gyu. There was much to do, including checking on his doping potions.***-That was pretty impressive.When Lou murmured, Gi-Gyu replied in his head, \u2018Yeah, I was surprised too.\u2019The hunt was just about to begin. While stretching his body and getting ready, Gi-Gyu chatted with Lou. They were discussing the fight Gi-Gyu had with the Brother Guild member.\u2018I knew that I had gotten stronger, but I had no idea the improvement would be this drastic.\u2019-It\u2019s partly because that player was really weak.\u2018Lou, can\u2019t you just let me have this for once?\u2019-Hmph.Gi-Gyu bickered with Lou as usual, but all of his focus was on the fight he had just now. He was able to defeat his opponent with a single move.\u00a0This Brother Guild member was a B-grade player who had already gone through the secondary job change. It meant the macho\u2019s level was over 100; he was just a leap away from becoming a ranker. Yet, Gi-Gyu defeated him with a punch.\u201cGreat,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with a pleasing smile.\u201cWe\u2019ll head out now. Our scouts say the guardian is about 30 minutes away from us, so we\u2019ll be moving quickly.\u201d When Kim Dong-Hae ordered, every player stood up immediately. The captain added, \u201cAs you must all know, this guardian is an exceptional case, so please do not lose your focus.\u201dThe entire party began to move as Kim Dong-Hae commanded. The players walked straight to their rightful positions in the group. Their formation was a straightforward one. All the reserve forces were to move to the back of the party and concentrate on long-distance attacks. Their secondary purpose was to act as support whenever necessary.Meanwhile, the main groups were to form their personal formations accordingly. The guilds that made up the main group had never fought together before, so it was best to fight as individual groups rather than together as one.\u201cHyung, are you sure you want to be at the front? We\u2019ve all seen how strong you are just now, but that doesn\u2019t discount the fact: The front will bear the greatest brunt,\u201d Sun-Pil asked in concern.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I believe I need to be at the front to make the most of Morningstar\u2019s battle power,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied firmly.Because this was the first time Gi-Gyu was working with the Morningstar Guild, they had to discuss how to work together as best as possible. What Gi-Gyu wanted was to be at the head of the group. Jae-Won\u2014the tanker\u2014just behind him, Sung-Woo\u2014the damage dealer\u2014in the middle, Sun-Pil\u2014the archer\u2014behind Sung-Woo, and Ha-Neul\u2014the magician\u2014in the back.The formation could change slightly if necessary as the battle progressed, but the overall structure would stay the same. Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cI\u2019ll take the bruiser position, so if I leave an opening, you need to step up, Jae-Won.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me, Hyung.\u201d\u201cI know Sun-Pil and Ha-Neul will do just fine, but I\u2019m still worried about Sung-Woo.\u201dAlthough Sung-Woo was a damage dealer, his level was much lower than the other players. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help being worried about him. This B-grade subjugation party was created for just one purpose: Hunt the wildly unpredictable and dangerous 4th-floor guardian. A single attack from such a monster could very well end Sung-Woo\u2019s life.Gi-Gyu's eyes were filled with concern as he advised Sung-Woo, \u201cDon\u2019t engage unless you\u2019re certain of your safety, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Sung-Woo.As they discussed their battle plan, Gi-Gyu naturally took the leader position. But Sun-Pil, the real guild master, didn\u2019t show any displeasure.\u2018I need to learn as much as I can from Gi-Gyu hyung!\u2019It seemed that Sun-Pil was now Gi-Gyu\u2019s biggest fan.***\u201cOh my god\u2026 All these corpses belong to the players who fought the guardian before us?\u201d a female player whispered as she gagged. She was a player of the healer category from the Kindergarten Guild.\u201cOh my god!\u201d The other players had similar ghastly reactions. The only ones who looked straight ahead unaffected were Gi-Gyu and Kim Dong-Hae. A short distance ahead of them, the guardian was munching on the mountain of human flesh that surrounded it. Some in the pile were missing a torso; others just had a torso. Some were rotten with worms squirming inside their orifices; others were fresh out of life.The subjugation party became tense as the players\u2019 anxiety level increased slowly. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe his eyes even as the guardian gnawed at the human flesh pile right in front of him.\u2018It\u2019s the same guardian from that day?\u2019There was no doubt the guardian had gotten much stronger than before. Gi-Gyu had never seen a guardian except for this one, which meant there was no way for him to compare this monster to the other guardians. He felt a little disappointed that he didn\u2019t have more general information about the guardians.\u201cAhh\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d Ha-Neul moaned and asked, \u201cAre you okay, Oppa?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu turned around, he saw that all the Morningstar members looked rigid with nervousness. Sun-Pil tried to stand next to Gi-Gyu nonchalantly, but he couldn\u2019t hide his trembling hands. The guardian\u2019s aura was simply too powerful and evil.\u201cChange of plan.\u201d After making his decision, Gi-Gyu murmured to his team members, \u201cWe have to stay as far back as possible and become passive participants. We will only actively get into it after the other guilds have weakened the guardian. It would be best for Sung-Woo to just stay out of this fight altogether.\u201d\u201cB-but!\u201d Sun-Pil yelled in disbelief. Gi-Gyu knew exactly what Sun-Pil wanted to say. So before he could ask, Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cYou think that would make us cowards, right? It\u2019s true, but the fact is that we\u2019re one of the weakest groups here. We might compare to Brother Guild, but you\u2019ve to understand we are nothing compared to the other real B-grade guilds. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cY-you\u2019re right,\u201d replied Sun-Pil with clenched fists. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but this was the cold truth.Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know the other players, but I know you guys. I like to think we know each other pretty well. Understand this, I don't, and will not, care about the other players; you guys are my priority here.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201d In the end, Sun-Pil nodded as he looked at Gi-Gyu. Slowly, the regret and guilt of having to play defense faded in Sun-Pil\u2019s eyes. Sun-Pil agreed that the Morningstar members\u2019 security had to be their number one priority.Gi-Gyu encouraged the players with a faint smile, \u201cAnd don\u2019t be so scared. It still doesn\u2019t change the fact that we\u2019ll be the one trampling on its cold, lifeless corpse.\u201dThanks to his words, the Morningstar players seemed less anxious.Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu thought secretly,\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s much weaker than the corps commander.\u2019-You know those two monsters aren\u2019t comparable, to begin with, right?\u2018But I can\u2019t compare this guardian to the talon or Chang-Gyung, can I?\u2019-Haa.It was only for a brief moment, but Gi-Gyu had seen the corps commander with his own eyes. Because he remembered what the boss monster of the maze felt like, this guardian didn\u2019t scare him much.Kim Dong-Hae, who had been contemplating for a while, finally announced, \u201cHaa\u2026 We shall now begin our hunt.\u201d With a sigh, he added, \u201cPlease try not to die, everyone.\u201dPer Kim Dong-Hae\u2019s command, the Child Guild led the group slowly. Behind it was the Kindergarten Guild and the rest; Morningstar was the tail of the main party.Gi-Gyu held Lou and El in each hand and twirled them once before walking.***\u201cAckkkk! Ice cutter!\u201d When Kim Dong-Hae shouted, white water drops appeared on his sword. Slowly, these water droplets circled the guardian before burying themselves into it.\u201cGrrrr!\u201d Kim Dong-Hae\u2019s attack had caught the guardian off guard; only now did it realize the players\u2019 presence. It threw the scrumptious thigh it was feasting on and faced the subjugation group. The 4th-floor guardian, a giant orc, swung his now-larger arms around and struck Kim Dong-Hae.\u201cUghh!\u201d When Kim Dong-Hae screamed as he fell to the ground, a healer player nearby ran to him to heal his injury.\u201cHeal!\u201dThe hunt had now begun.With Kim Dong-Hae at the front, the other tankers walked toward the guardian calmly.Thud! Thud! Thud!The selected tankers from each guild planted their giant shields on the ground, creating a large dirt wall around the orc.\u201cNow!\u201d When Kim Dong-Hae screamed his order, every guild rushed to throw their disposable weapon items toward the monster. Most of the items used were of the explosive category. Calmly following the order, Gi-Gyu also threw his bomb through the small opening in the dirt wall.Kaboom!The dirt wall shook as a giant blast resounded in everyone\u2019s ears. Gi-Gyu took a step back to protect himself from the large quantity of sand flying around and blurring his vision. Turning back toward the Morningstar players, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cGet ready, everyone. The real hunt is about to start.\u201d When he saw the other members nod, Gi-Gyu called out to his Egos.\u2018Lou, El.\u2019-What is it?-Yes, Master?\u2018Let\u2019s do our best, okay?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu encouraged his Egos silently.Soon, the sand dust slowly settled, and the dirt wall, shattered from the explosion, was revealed. One player whispered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dThe 4th-floor guardian, the humongous orc, was now much bigger than the orc everyone saw before the explosion. It was so big that it could now be called an ogre. There was not a single scratch on this monster to everyone's shock.\u201cChweeek!!!!!!!!!\u201d The furious orc fumed visibly.Kim Dong-Hae announced, \u201cEveryone, attack!\u201dFollowing their guild\u2019s tactics, the groups charged toward the guardian.It was finally time for Gi-Gyu\u2019s revenge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38. First Revenge (5)\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d the players panted. It had been over an hour since the hunt for the 4th-floor guardian began. Thankfully, there were only a few casualties, but most players were exhausted by now.These were all minor problems; the elephant in the room was something else.\u201cWe can\u2019t kill it,\u201d a random player at the front line murmured in despair.As things stood, there were no reserve forces available. The guardian had forced the spare forces to join the fray soon after the battle began. It battled the combined might of the main and the spare forces\u2014it still came out unscathed. It even looked refreshed, as if it hadn\u2019t been fighting the players for over an hour.A player in the back whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a beast\u2026\u201dPerhaps the term \u201cbeast\u201d was an accurate term for this guardian. Even Kim Dong-Hae seemed weary of the orc\u2019s stamina and tenacity.One member from the Child Guild desperately shouted, \u201cCaptain! Shouldn\u2019t we retreat at this point?\u201d He was fighting even as he yelled.\u201cNot yet! Just a little while longer!\u201d Kim Dong-Hae replied as his eyes landed somewhere. He was staring at the Morningstar Guild: It was obsessively focused on attacking the orc\u2019s back. More specifically, Kim Dong-Hae observed one man among the many in the group. He pondered,\u00a0\u2018They still aren\u2019t attacking the guardian actively for some reason.\u2019The Morningstar members were keeping their attacks tight and small. So far, Kim Dong-Hae hadn\u2019t seen them make any big moves. For some reason, the captain had a feeling that Gi-Gyu, the mysterious player, was the key to victory. This was why he couldn\u2019t order a retreat just yet.Slicing the orc\u2019s back with Lou, Gi-Gyu muttered in disgust, \u201cThis is a real beast for sure.\u201dBoom!The orc turned around at an incredible speed and slammed his glaive on the spot where Gi-Gyu was standing just a moment ago. With a loud explosion, dust and debris blew everywhere.\u201cStep back!\u201d As soon as Gi-Gyu shouted, the Morningstar players took a step back as a unit. Thanks to Gi-Gyu\u2019s strategy of keeping their attacks small and defensive, the Morningstar was the least tired guild in the hunting party.With a small smile, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI\u2019ve got a good sense of this beast now.\u201dOther players believed they\u2019d wasted the last hour of their time, but Gi-Gyu disagreed. His necklace glowed as he heard the system announcement.[Wound Aggravation has been enabled.]At the same time, the gash Lou made on the orc\u2019s back stopped healing. Gi-Gyu had used the last hour to understand the orc\u2019s fighting pattern. The last hour gave him a good sense of the monster\u2019s behavior.\u2018Its regeneration power, stamina, and strength are incredible, but its attack pattern is about the same.\u2019Gi-Gyu discovered that the 4th-floor guardian had the same basic battle pattern as the other orcs. No one else noticed this, but Gi-Gyu did because he hunted orcs for five straight years. He also hunted countless orcs when he first obtained Lou. He was confident in his assessment, and he even suspected the other players would never figure this out independently. After all, the B-grade players had probably forgotten about fighting such weak monsters like the 4th-floor orcs.\u2018So did this guardian evolve or something?\u2019Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help wondering this because the guardian\u2019s pattern was too similar to the orcs.Turning toward the other Morningstar members, he announced, \u201cAttention! Do you remember what I taught you when I was your guide?\u201d\u201cYes, Hyung!\u201d\u201cDo you remember fighting the orcs individually to prepare for the 5th-floor test?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.Sun-Pil replied confidently, \u201cOf course we do! How could we ever forget that?!\u201d\u201cThis is exactly like that. Just think of this guardian as an orc.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Sun-Pil seemed confused by Gi-Gyu\u2019s response, but before he could ask for a further explanation, Gi-Gyu was already gone.\u2018Accelerate!\u2019Accelerate and Wound Aggravation were skills Gi-Gyu had access to thanks to the pseudo Egos he purchased from Old Man Hwang. Gradually, he felt his body becoming faster.\u201cChweeek!\u201d the guardian screamed in pain.\u201cWhat the!\u201d one player who barely dodged the orc\u2019s glaive shouted when he noticed the long wound on the monster\u2019s hand. The player couldn\u2019t understand where this injury came from.Kim Dong-Hae smiled in understanding and murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t stay behind like this.\u201d Without hesitation, he also sprinted toward the guardian.\u201cCaptain Kim Dong-Hae!\u201d one of the Child Guild players screamed, but Kim Dong-Hae didn\u2019t slow down.Boom! Boom! Boom!Unfortunately, the orc was also beginning to move faster; the casualties increased each time it swung its glaive. The healing skill only worked on alive players who could accept such help. Unsure of what to do and who to help, the players of the support category hovered hesitantly.At that moment, they heard a familiar voice.\u201cPlease focus your healing skills on Captain Kim Dong-Hae and me!\u201dGi-Gyu screamed while slashing at the orc with Lou and El as if he was possessed. He swung Lou and El once after another in a carefully crafted attack pattern. And as a result, the guardian\u2019s green blood spurted out with every slash.\u201cWater protection!\u201d As if he was determined not to lose to Gi-Gyu, Kim Dong-Hae attacked the orc with his skills from the opposite side. To everyone\u2019s shock, the orc, utterly unharmed even after facing an hour of constant offense, was now bleeding.\u201cW-we can do this!\u201d many players cheered as they began their attacks again.Just then, Gi-Gyu shouted, \u201cBe careful!\u201d \u00a0He warned Kim Dong-Hae because he saw the orc\u2019s glaive flying toward the captain. Unlike Gi-Gyu, who knew the orc\u2019s pattern, Kim Dong-Hae had been fighting blindly.Kaboom!It was a close call, as seconds later, the glaive struck the spot Kim Dong-Hae was standing a moment ago. Hearing the loud explosion, the captain stammered, \u201cT-thank you.\u201d\u201cIf you still haven\u2019t recognized the orc\u2019s attack pattern, you should stay back, Captain!\u201d Gi-Gyu replied as he used Lou and El in succession to block the glaive. By now, everyone had witnessed the orc's incredible power and knew just how troublesome dealing with it was. Yet, Gi-Gyu alone fought the monster with ease and gave everyone well-thought-out instructions.Kim Dong-Hae wondered in shock, \u2018Just how strong is he?\u2019\u00a0Sadly, he couldn\u2019t show his admiration because Gi-Gyu vanished from his sights like lightning.Only the Morningstar Guild members were actively attacking the guardian with much success now. They seemingly knew precisely where the orc would strike next because they easily dodged its attacks. The Morningstar players gradually injured the guardian and slowed it down.\u201cChweek! Chweek! Chweeeeeeek!!!!!!!!!\u201d the orc roared in pain.At best, Kim Dong-Hae\u2019s sight wasn\u2019t on Gi-Gyu for a fleeting moment. But, in that moment, Gi-Gyu inflicted countless injuries on the monster's body.Thud!Gi-Gyu kicked the ground to leap.\u201cChweeek!\u201d It seemed that the orc had now caught onto Gi-Gyu\u2019s attacks. Glaring at him in rage, the guardian snorted loudly. A vapor-like heat escaped the orc\u2019s nostrils as it grabbed its glaive with both hands for the first time. Gi-Gyu stood like a statue and watched the guardian prepare to attack.Thinking Gi-Gyu froze, Kim Dong-Hae shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous!\u201dThe Morningstar Guild members were backing away, realizing the situation had suddenly gotten much more dangerous. All the subjugation group players stood far away watching the battle between Gi-Gyu and the guardian orc. It seemed that only Gi-Gyu and the guardian existed in this world right now.\u201cChweeek!\u201dNow ready to attack, the orc slammed down on the ground with its glaive.Boom!Another dust wind blew everywhere.Gulp.Kim Dong-Hae couldn\u2019t see the attack just now. He gulped audibly as many questions flooded his brain,\u2018Did Gi-Gyu dodge it?\u2019\u2018Did he block the attack?\u2019\u2018Is he dead?\u2019He had many questions; before long, they were all answered.\u201cChweek.\u201d\u201cN-no,\u201d Kim Dong-Hae shouted in desperation. As the dust settled, he saw the orc standing strong on the ground.But then, one of the Morningstar players screamed, \u201cLook behind you!\u201dIt was Sun-Pil.\u201cHuh?\u201d Kim Dong-Hae gasped, trying to understand what Sun-Pil was trying to say. At the same time, he noticed something strange: The orc was standing absolutely still.And then\u2026Ktunk!With a loud noise, the orc fell forward to the ground.The entire subjugation party attacked the orc without success during the first hour. But, just five minutes after Gi-Gyu actively fought, the orc was dead.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026\u201d Kim Dong-Hae, speechless at the scene in front of him, couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu plunged Lou and El into the orc\u2019s back.[You have obtained experience points.]Every survivor in the subjugation party heard the system announcement.\u201cIt\u2019s finally over\u2026\u201d one player murmured.\u201cOh my god\u2026 We really did it,\u201d another whispered.\u201cUwahh!!!\u201d several players exclaimed.Maybe it was the disbelief or the excitement, but everyone was chatting loudly now. Kim Dong-Hae was having just as hard a time accepting what had happened. Countless B-grade guilds participated in the hunt; in the end, a C-grade guild shone like the sun during the fight. Even among the many Morningstar Guild players, one stood out the most\u2014Gi-Gyu. It wouldn\u2019t have been an exaggeration to say Gi-Gyu almost killed the orc alone.Everyone was cheering and celebrating when Gi-Gyu heard the system announcement. Apart from him, no one else on the field heard it.[Cannibalism has been activated.][The lowest level devil Perez has been eliminated.][Attempting to egofy Perez.][Perez\u2019s egofication has failed.][Lou has absorbed a fragment of the unegofied Perez.]***\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d Sun-Pil asked. Although Gi-Gyu felt guilty for not being able to tell him the truth, he remained calm and replied, \u201cWho knows? It was an unusual guardian, so maybe it makes sense that its death was unique too.\u201dSun-Pil asked because the guardian\u2019s corpse disappeared after its death. When a guardian died, it always dropped at least one item, which the players took as a prize. But this time, nothing was dropped by the fourth-floor guardian.The subjugationgroup had completed taking care of their casualties; they were on their way home after a successful hunt. Although they suffered several casualties, it wasn\u2019t as bad as everyone expected.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d one of the Brother Guild\u2019s members approached Gi-Gyu. It was the rude player Gi-Gyu fought earlier.\u201cYes?\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hold a grudge against him, but he kept his answer curt.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about what I did earlier! I didn\u2019t realize what a powerful player you are. It was because you\u2019re in a C-grade guild\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu watched him in frustration as the man came up with a weak excuse.\u201cYou know very well that a guild\u2019s grade doesn\u2019t always match its players\u2019 grades. And it sounds like you\u2019re saying you wouldn\u2019t be apologizing if I wasn\u2019t strong. Am I right?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked bluntly.\u201cW-well\u2026\u201d\u201cJust go away. You\u2019re annoying me.\u201d\u201cI apologize!\u201d the Brother Guild player bowed and scurried away. It seemed Gi-Gyu\u2019s recent battle had scared the Brother member straight. Watching the Brother Guild player return to his group, the other players showed even more interest in Gi-Gyu. Everyone had been hesitant to approach him, but now, they swarmed Gi-Gyu and bombarded him with questions and comments.\u201cCan we be friends?\u201d\u201cYou were so amazing back there!\u201d\u201cYou were incredible!\u201dUnaffected by the other players\u2019 compliments, Gi-Gyu replied in a business-like tone, \u201cThank you.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu continued to act cold and uninterested, the players awkwardly left him. Jae-Won, who was standing next to him, teased, \u201cWow! You\u2019re so popular now, Hyung!\u201dJust then, Kim Dong-Hae walked up to Gi-Gyu. He politely asked, \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, could we talk for a moment?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Alright.\u201d Gi-Gyu was also interested in the captain, so he accepted.\u201cCan we talk in private?\u201d When Kim Dong-Hae suggested, Gi-Gyu turned toward Sun-Pil, who nodded. Everyone could guess what Kim Dong-Hae wanted to talk to Gi-Gyu about.Gi-Gyu and the captain walked away from the group. Their captain\u2019s absence didn\u2019t lead the group in disarray. Even without Kim Dong-Hae, the group did a fine job getting organized and dealing with the aftermath.Kim Dong-Hae asked, \u201cDo you plan on staying in the Morningstar Guild? I\u2019m not saying this because I think little of your guild. In fact, I\u2019ve learned the Morningstar Guild isn\u2019t a group to be ignored anymore. But someone like you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu, you should be able to join a bigger guil\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t plan on staying with the Morningstar guild.\u201d At Gi-Gyu\u2019s reply, Kim Dong-Hae\u2019s eyes brightened as he continued, \u201cThen would you like to join the Child Guild? You will receive the best terms possible, and we will accept any conditions you request.\u201dIt was clear Kim Dong-Hae was trying to scout Gi-Gyu, who had shown his incredible skills a moment ago. Since Sun-Pil and Gi-Gyu already had an agreement, Gi-Gyu knew he was free to join whichever guild he chose. But Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t plan on joining any guild. This was just a one-time thing.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Kim Dong-Hae seemed disappointed as he added, \u201cBut I would still like to maintain a close relationship with you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. If there is anything our guild, or I, can do for you, please come find me.\u201dWhen Kim Dong-Hae offered Gi-Gyu his business card, he accepted it with a nod and replied, \u201cThank you.\u201dKim Dong-Hae bowed as well and left to join his group.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu was currently leaving the Tower with the rest of the subjugation group, but his focus was on something else.\u2018Lou, any changes to you?\u2019-Not really\u2026Lou answered brusquely. The uninterested tone evoked a brief frown from Gi-Gyu before he decided to just check his Egos\u2019status.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39. First Revenge (6)The two Egos that helped Gi-Gyu the most in the hunt were his most recent purchases.[Bi][Level 51][Power: 19][Speed: 25][Stamina: 67][Magic: 90]-Abilities-[Accessory][Magic Recovery: Increases the magic recovery speed.][Wound Aggravation: Aggravates the wounds and slows down the opponent\u2019s healing.]It was a necklace with a small jewel ornament: The first pseudo-Ego Gi-Gyu purchased from Old Man Hwang on his last visit. Unlike Lou and El, the stats of the blacksmith\u2019s Egos seemed very random. Gi-Gyu wondered if it was because a human made those pseudo Egos. In addition to its stats, Bi had two skills named Magic Recovery and wound Aggravation. All in all, Gi-Gyu was quite satisfied with this item.The next Ego was named Hermes.[Hermes][Level 45][Power: 30][Speed: 89][Stamina: 12][Magic: 40]-Abilities-[Accessory][Accelerate: Increases the player\u2019s speed for five minutes. After the first three minutes, the player can move at the maximum speed.][16% movement speed increment; 8% agility increment.]Hermes was in the form of a pair of shoes, and it was the second Ego Gi-Gyu purchased from Old Man Hwang. This item also had a strange stats distribution, but Gi-Gyu was just happy with its skills that could increase his speed and agility.The fourth-floor guardian hunt was the first time Gi-Gyu tried out this item, and its usefulness shocked him.-They aren\u2019t important at all right now. You need to concentrate on me. I can\u2019t understand why my body changed this way.Lou seemed jealous of all the attention Gi-Gyu\u2019s other Egos were getting. When Lou complained in a pouty voice, Gi-Gyu replied,\u2018Don\u2019t be a baby. I was going to look at you anyway. \u2019Gi-Gyu replied coldly and opened Lou\u2019s status screen.[Lou][Level 70][Power: 101][Speed: 129][Stamina: 91][Magic: 208][Poison Resistance: 7%][Fire Resistance: 3%]-Abilities-[Accessory][Cannibalism: You can prey on corpses to regain stamina.][Strong Will: When suffering severe damage, it can provide a quick stamina recovery.][Absorbed Devil: Fragment of Perez.]\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAn odd expression appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face when he looked at Lou\u2019s status screen. Lou and Gi-Gyu had been hunting together for months now, and Lou had leveled up quite steadily over the course. Moreover, when they entered the Maze of Heryond and hunted monsters way above their level, Lou grew at an exponential rate. Suffice to say, Gi-Gyu was pleased with his Ego\u2019s growth so far, but\u2026\u201cThe fragment of Perez\u2026?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.-I don\u2019t think it has any function.\u201cI agree.\u201dLou didn't feel any changes from absorbing Perez except for the additional line at the bottom of his status screen. Gi-Gyu began to feel frustrated because he had no idea how to use the egofied Chang-Gyung or this fragment.-I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find out in time.\u2018I hope so.\u2019Gi-Gyu shook his head and joined the subjugation group again. Just then, El stammered,-M-Master.\u2018Yes? Ah! You want me to check your status screen too, right?\u2019-When I absorbed Calleon, I grew quite a bit\u2026 I wanted to show you that I can also be helpful to you, Master.El\u2019s voice trembled as she whispered shyly. Gi-Gyu felt guilty for not even bothering to check El\u2019s condition. He also found El cute for asking this with such shyness.\u2018I\u2019ll have a look right now. Sorry, El.\u2019-It\u2019s no problem, Master.[El][Title:\u00a0Empress of Holy Swords][Level 87][Power: 128][Speed: 130][Stamina: 145][Magic: 120]-Abilities-[Accessory][El can now reflect 5% of any damages received from other holy swords.][Empress of Holy Swords: As the empress, El can absorb all other inferior holy swords.][Calleon: It can block a single fatal attack.]The only major changes were her increased stats and level. After absorbing a part of Calleon, El\u2019s level became higher than Lou's, and her stats also grew evenly. There wasn't much to note except the new skill that allowed her to reflect a percentage of other holy sword attacks.-...Somehow, Gi-Gyu could feel El being disappointed, so he patted El and encouraged,\u2018El, I\u2019m so proud of you for growing this much. You\u2019ve done well.\u2019-Thank you, Master.El replied calmly, but Gi-Gyu could tell that she was a little excited by his compliment.-Pathetic.Lou muttered as Gi-Gyu rejoined the hunting party.\u2018I\u2019m a little sad that Brunheart isn\u2019t here with us.\u2019Gi-Gyu felt strangely naked today since Brunheart wasn\u2019t on his torso.***\u201cGood job,\u201d Tae-Shik said to Gi-Gyu.Before leaving the Tower, Gi-Gyu had to promise the Morningstar Guild members he would have dinner with them at a later date. Kim Dong-Hae of the Child Guild also invited Gi-Gyu to dinner, but all Gi-Gyu said to him was that he would call him later.Immediately after Gi-Gyu left the tower, he went to the association building to meet Tae-Shik.\u201cI guess this is why everyone wants the elixir. I can\u2019t believe you took down the monster that even a B-grade subjugation group failed to kill,\u201d Tae-Shik added, clearly impressed by Gi-Gyu\u2019s work. As the Gate Maintenance Department\u2019s general manager, Tae-Shik had already received a detailed report about the hunt, so he complimented Gi-Gyu with fatherly pride.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cIt\u2019s partly thanks to my Egos leveling up in the Maze of Heryond. But, I\u2019ve something more important to discuss.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThe guardian orc\u2019s fighting pattern was too similar to a basic orc. Usually, a guardian shouldn\u2019t attack the same way as an average orc, right?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Tae-Shik nodded, realizing that something was wrong.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cThis guardian was incredibly strong, and the only reason I could kill it was its familiar fighting pattern. I\u2019m not sure if we would\u2019ve won had I not recognized the pattern.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was as if\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu took a sip of the instant coffee Tae-Shik made\u2014 \u201can orc had evolved into a guardian. When I killed it, the system called it the lowest level devil.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking into the devils too, so I'll let you know as soon as I find out anything about it.\u201d Tae-Shik had been collecting information on the devils because of the many encounters Gi-Gyu had related to them.Tae-Shik added, \u201cThe subjugation party will be given a reward for the recent kill. I think you\u2019ll be receiving about 300 to 500 million won.\u201d\u201cReally? That much?\u201d When Gi-Gyu jumped in surprise at the large amount, Tae-Shik replied in confusion, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I told you this was a B-grade hunt. The amount you\u2019ll get is actually less than the usual reward because there were so many guilds and players involved. You deserve much more.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dBefore Gi-Gyu obtained his Egos, he was happy with the few thousand won he was getting from selling the crystals. But now, he was earning millions of won from a single hunt. Gi-Gyu felt like his reality was changing way too quickly.Changing the subject, Tae-Shik said, \u201cAnd\u2026 there is something else.\u201dAfter hesitating for a moment, Tae-Shik continued, \u201cRogers is alive.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dGi-Gyu had stabbed Rogers Han\u2019s neck, so he thought this Korean-American player was dead. But, as it turns out, he was still alive.\u201cAfter the Maze of Heryond perished, it became common knowledge that Lucifer closed it. And you\u2019ve also heard that the Iron Guild and the Athena Guild have both sequestered themselves, right?\u201d asked Tae-Shik.\u201cYes, you told me about that before, Hyung.\u201d\"Since Lucifer is nowhere to be found, the players now believe some other high-ranking players took over the maze.\u201d This was news to Gi-Gyu, so he listened carefully.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cEveryone thought the Iron Guild and Athena\u2019s sequestration is because they must be recovering from the damages received inside the maze.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cBut the Iron Guild has begun to move recently.\u201d At Tae-Shik\u2019s ominous tone, Gi-Gyu clenched his fists in displeasure.Tae-Shik explained, \u201cThey\u2019re not making any big moves, but it looks like they\u2019re going to accept recruits again and focus on climbing the Tower like the Angela Guild. They are trying to grow their battle power.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t make any comment, Tae-Shik continued, \u201cI\u2019m only telling you this in case you\u2019re curious. And as long as you\u2019re in Korea, those bastards can\u2019t touch you. So don\u2019t worry about that.\u201dOnce again, Gi-Gyu felt thankful to Tae-Shik for his kindness and loyalty.With a sigh, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cHaa\u2026 Now, I better focus on leveling up. I won\u2019t have any time to rest at all. I also need to go through my secondary job change.\u201dThe secondary job change was possible after reaching the 50th floor of the Tower. Gi-Gyu\u2019s current strength allowed him to ascend to the 40th floor with relative ease.Gi-Gyu had only passed the 20th-floor test till then, but it wasn\u2019t because he lacked the skills to go higher: He just didn\u2019t have the time. Now that Lou and El were stronger than ever and Gi-Gyu owned many pseudo Egos, he felt confident he could reach the 50th floor.\u2018Lucifer told me to find her after reaching the 50th floor, right?\u2019Gi-Gyu remembered Lucifer\u2019s words.\u201cThe thing is\u2014\u201dJust when Tae-Shik was about to say something, a sudden elderly voice interrupted him.\u201cOh Tae-Shik! Oh Tae-Shik, are you in your office?!\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu turned toward Tae-Shik, he found that Tae-Shik\u2019s face was turning blue.\u201cHyung, are you alright?\u201d Gi-Gyu had never seen Tae-Shik look like this, so he was confused and anxious.Unable to hide his alarm, Tae-Shik muttered, \u201cDammit! It\u2019s the old man!\u201d\u201cThe old man? You mean the president?\u201d\u201cT-that's right!\u201d Tae-Shik replied and began to find a place to hide. The way he was acting looked funny, but Tae-Shik seemed genuinely desperate.\u201cOh Tae-Shik!\u201d When the old man yelled the general manager\u2019s name again, Tae-Shik hid underneath the desk and begged Gi-Gyu, \u201cGi-Gyu! I\u2019m not here, okay? Just tell him I\u2019m not here!\u201dGi-Gyu sat in surprise, not knowing what to do when the office door burst open.\u201cHuh? Who are you?\u201d When the older man asked rudely, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his confusion.\u201cPardon?\u201d\u2018Ah! So he\u2019s the president of the association!\u2019It didn't take long for Gi-Gyu to figure out that he was in the association president\u2019s presence. Quickly standing up and bowing deeply, Gi-Gyu greeted the old man, \u201cHow do you do? I'm Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cOh?!\u201d The older man studied Gi-Gyu with interest. Tilting his head knowingly, the president breathed, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Gi-Gyu felt an incredible aura pushing on his body. He gasped as he exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201dThe suppressive aura wasn\u2019t something a low-level player could endure. He felt certain anyone weaker would have fainted on the spot. Slowly, Gi-Gyu pushed back, but the harder he fought back, the more vicious the old man\u2019s aura became.\u201cOld man! What the heck are you doing?!\u201d Just then, Tae-Shik jumped out from the desk and shouted.\u201cGot ya! So you were hiding over there, huh?\u201d The old man\u2019s aura abruptly disappeared as he jumped to grab Tae-Shik\u2019s neck. Turning toward Gi-Gyu, the old man apologized, \u201cWell, Young Man, I\u2019m sorry. When this bastard hides his presence, even I can\u2019t find him easily.\u201dThe old man seemed genuinely apologetic; Gi-Gyu understood the president\u2019s actions had no malice, so he accepted the apology quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Sir.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d\u201cDo you know me, Sir? When Gi-Gyu asked, the old man smiled and replied, \u201cOf course I do. You have no idea how many times Tae-Shik has mentioned you. He would go on about Gi-Gyu this and Gi-Gyu that. I was getting so sick of it.\u201dGi-Gyu scratched his cheek shyly as Tae-Shik yelled, \u201cOld man! Stop!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s the truth, isn\u2019t it? I even feared that you weren\u2019t interested in women\u2026\u201d the president muttered loudly.\u201cOld man! Ackkkkkkk!\u201d Tae-Shik screamed in pain when the old man grabbed and pulled his ear. Gi-Gyu had never seen Tae-Shik like this, so he couldn\u2019t hide his interest in what was unfolding before his eyes.Tae-Shik had always been so strong and macho; now, he looked like a child in front of the association president, who was, clearly, an incredible player.\u2018There isn\u2019t much information on the Korean branch\u2019s president. All I\u2019ve heard is that he was a legendary figure and a powerful player.\u2019Despite being a public figure, the association president was a mysterious man: Many didn\u2019t even know his name. But based on what he had seen so far, Gi-Gyu could tell this elderly man was a powerful player.\u2018He\u2019s almost\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu refused to finish his thought. He had become a little stronger lately, but if he admitted what he was guessing about the president, Gi-Gyu was sure he would feel depressed.\u201cHey, Young Man.\u201d The president turned toward Gi-Gyu.\u201cYes, Sir?\u201d\u201cWhen do you have some time to spare?\u201d\u201cTime?\u201dSuddenly, Tae-Shik screamed desperately, \u201cTell him you don\u2019t have any time! Never! Not even in your next life! Not even the life after that!\u201dIgnoring the big, pleading baby, the president asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cCan you spare me a day next week perhaps?\u201d Before even waiting for Gi-Gyu\u2019s answer, the elderly man added, \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner together.\u201dEven before he knew what he was doing, Gi-Gyu nodded in agreement.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40. Oh Tae-GuAfter Gi-Gyu agreed to a dinner meeting with the association president, he left the building. When he came outside, he saw Sung-Hoon waiting for him.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you,\u201d Sung-Hoon announced. Behind him, an unfamiliar car was parked neatly. It wasn\u2019t the same car Sung-Hoon usually drove, so Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cDid you get a new car?\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t know much about cars but even could tell it was a new car and from a name brand at that. Sung-Hoon opened the back door with a faint smile and suggested, \u201cPlease take a seat.\u201dFor the first time in his life, Gi-Gyu was getting the VIP treatment, so he said awkwardly, \u201cI feel a little overwhelmed.\u201dSung-Hoon shrugged and replied, \u201cWell, this is your new life now, so please don\u2019t feel uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t do it if I didn\u2019t want to.\u201dGi-Gyu got into the car slowly. It was no wonder people liked expensive cars\u2014they were incredibly comfortable. Gi-Gyu smiled playfully and joked, \u201cI was going to give you a bonus once I got my reward from the hunt. But it looks like you don\u2019t need a bonus since you can afford such a great new car.\u201d\u201cN-no! You got it all wrong. This isn\u2019t my car! It\u2019s yours, Gi-Gyu!\u201d Sung-Hoon replied hurriedly. Gi-Gyu had already guessed that, but he wanted to tease Sung-Hoon a little.Sung-Hoon groaned and said emphatically, \u201cI was going to surprise you with this, but I guess I failed. Anyway, you need to give me that bonus.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Although Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hire Sung-Hoon, Sung-Hoon had been working very hard for Gi-Gyu. Gi-Gyu was thankful for his help, and he felt that the man deserved a bonus.Scratching his cheek, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cBut I had no idea the car would arrive this quickly.\u201d\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d When Sung-Hoon asked in confusion, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license yet.\u201d\u201c...\u201dThump!Sung-Hoon seemed shocked, as he forgot to slow down at the speed bump. The car jolted hard, and a startled Sung-Hoon apologized, \u201cAck! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201dThis was a brand new car whose owner hadn\u2019t even driven it once. Knowing how expensive this foreign car was, Sung-Hoon became rigid. He quickly parked it nearby and ran out to check. Thankfully, there were no scratches, so Sung-Hoon sighed in relief, \u201cPhew\u2026\u201dWhen Sung-Hoon returned, Gi-Gyu reassured him, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Please don\u2019t worry about little things like dents and scratches. Just think of it like your own car, Sung-Hoon. I\u2019m just grateful you\u2019re driving me around.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t you make a lot of money too, Sung-Hoon? You may belong to the association, but you\u2019re also a high-grade player.\u201dGi-Gyu remembered hunting with Sung-Hoon inside the Maze of Heryond. Gi-Gyu knew Sung-Hoon was even stronger than Kim Dong-Hae based on what he saw.Sung-Hoon explained, \u201cThe association salary isn\u2019t that great. And because I\u2019m so busy with work, I rarely get a chance to go out hunting. The only extra income I get is the overtime pay or stipends for business trips.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu contemplated for a moment before asking, \u201cThen why do you work for the association?\u201dThey lived in a capitalist world. Most people consider money the most important thing in life. It was common knowledge that most players were high earners, so someone like Sung-Hoon, a skilled hunter, could make a lot of money if they wanted.\u201cWell, there are many reasons why a player would choose to work for the association. This doesn\u2019t apply to me, but most people who work at the association do so for their family.\u201d\u201cFamily?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYou know that hunting monsters isn\u2019t the only thing players do, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThe association players have to fight with members of various guilds and Red Players frequently,\u201d explained Sung-Hoon.Although killing other players inside the Tower or the gates was officially illegal, the same couldn\u2019t be said about \u201chunting accidents.\u201d Murderers usually hid their crimes by disguising them as accidental deaths or hiding the corpses.Instead of the public police force, the association was responsible for investigating and punishing the criminals inside the Tower and the gates. It wasn\u2019t that uncommon for association members to get killed in the process.\"This is why many players owe favors and grudges to other players. Unfortunately, people nowadays rarely forget grudges and remember favors. Once a player dies, no one can protect their families from that player\u2019s enemies. This is common among ordinary players. However, for the association players, the association acts as a protective wall that shields their families,\u201d Sung-Hoon explained.\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d Gi-Gyu had worked for the association as a guide for five years, but this was the first time he had heard about it. It was partly because he never got the chance to talk to anyone about such a sensitive topic. Gi-Gyu also knew that most people wouldn\u2019t tell him the complete truth about things like this.Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cBut, this doesn\u2019t apply to me. I didn\u2019t join the association for this. This is just why most association players chose to work for this organization.\u201dGi-Gyu closed his eyes. He could relate, as his family was also his utmost priority. What if he died and Rogers or any other players who held a grudge against him harmed his mother or Yoo-Jung?-Calm down.Lou warned Gi-Gyu, who replied, \u2018I know.\u2019Gi-Gyu was having a difficult time controlling the sudden boiling rage at the thought.-Why are you so worried about it? There are plenty of ways you can prevent something like that.\u2018That\u2019s true.\u2019Gi-Gyu went through many options in his head before deciding on one.\u2018I just have to make sure no one with a grudge against me is alive.\u2019While Gi-Gyu was busy with his thoughts, Sung-Hoon announced that they had arrived at Gi-Gyu\u2019s home.***Gi-Gyu\u2019s dinner with the association president was next week, so he had plenty of time. Refusing to waste a single second, Gi-Gyu headed to the Tower every chance he got.Last time, Gi-Gyu passed the 20th-floor test, and Lou was done absorbing stat points from the lower-floor monsters. Now, Gi-Gyu steadily and quickly climbed to the 30th floor. The monsters he faced on the 20\u201330 floors felt no different than the orcs from the tutorial floors. Thanks to his newfound stats and abundant abilities, Gi-Gyu massacred the various monsters he faced as he went higher up the Tower.Gi-Gyu was growing and becoming stronger rapidly, but there was one problem.\u2018I\u2019m not getting enough experience points!\u2019All this hunting only gave him a meager amount of experience points, making it hard for his Egos to level up. Now that he had four Egos in total, the monsters from 20\u201330 floors weren\u2019t cutting it.\u2018But Lou\u2019s abilities are increasing, so I must keep going.\u2019Lou continued to absorb different monsters\u2019 blood to increase his stats slowly. Lou was also developing further tolerances and immunities against various toxins, so Gi-Gyu had to hunt on each floor rather than skipping to the 30th floor.El now had higher stats and abilities than Lou. So, even though Lou never mentioned it outright, it seemed his pride was hurt. This was probably why he nagged Gi-Gyu every day.-Go get it! Hunt it down!\u201cLou\u2026\u201d-Get up and work! There is no time to rest!Finally, Gi-Gyu lost it. He announced, \u201cI\u2019ve turned on your pain sensor, Lou.\u201d-Ackkkk! Sorry! Sorry!Just as Lou wished, Gi-Gyu hunted without rest. But he did this with Lou\u2019s pain sensor enabled.\u2018Coddling someone just because they're important is definitely a bad idea.\u2019Being Gi-Gyu\u2019s first Ego and all, Lou was very precious to him, so he had overindulged Lou. This was why Lou had been becoming ruder and meaner.-I\u2019m really sorry\u2026\u201cGood, Lou. We\u2019re partners, right? So, there are certain rules we both have to follow to maintain a cordial relationship.\u201d-I-I know.Lately, Lou had become arrogant and overbearing, but the threat of pain was enough to make even him docile. Threats and punishments decreased Gi-Gyu\u2019s assimilation level with Lou, but he felt so much better now that it all seemed worth it.While waiting for the day he would have dinner with the association president, Gi-Gyu spent all his time inside the Tower.***\u201cOppa, move your feet!\u201d Yoo-Jung ordered as she vacuumed. Today was a rare day, as Gi-Gyu had decided to stay home and rest. Before today, his schedule had been quite monotonous: Go inside the Tower, hunt all day, sell the collected crystals, and finally spend the night with family. Hunting and leveling up were certainly important. However, Gi-Gyu, who was still healing from the past emotional trauma, knew spending time with family was also important.\u201cAh, fine,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered as he raised his feet. Yoo-Jung quickly vacuumed underneath and continued to the next room. When Yoo-Jung was out of sight, Gi-Gyu turned on the TV.Click.The picture quality of the latest flat-screen TV was so life-like that Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cTae-Shik hyung definitely got the expensive stuff for us.\u201dEverything in their new home, including the sofa, the TV, and the vacuum Yoo-Jung was using right now, was a gift from Tae-Shik.Meanwhile, the news anchor on the TV pondered aloud.-Who do you think cleared the Maze of Heryond? Athena? Ironshield? Lucifer? We still have no idea who took care of this gate.The Player News channel was still talking about the Maze of Heryond. The same anchor continued.-Also, the question remains: Was an elixir rewarded in this hunt? And if it was, who took it? Wealthy people from all around the globe have actually put up a bounty on the elixir!Gi-Gyu clicked the remote to change the channel. There was no reason for him to watch this news, as he knew exactly what happened inside the maze. When he flipped to the next channel, he found the reporters discussing the Angela guild.-The Angela guild has stopped on the 80th floor.-Yesterday, they brought down their soldiers and left the Tower.-There is even a rumor that Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho was injured. Have you heard of it?-That must be just a rumor.The reporters continued to talk about the Angela Guild.-They were climbing the Tower so smoothly until they reached the 80th floor. Are you saying there is another reason they suddenly decided to leave the Tower?-Nothing has been confirmed so far. It\u2019s possible they just needed a break or do some maintenance.-Has the Angela Guild made any official statement?-Nothing specific yet.None of this information was helpful to Gi-Gyu. So what if the Angela guild stopped climbing the Tower? What help was a rumor that Lee Sun-Ho was injured?But then, Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cIf Lee Sun-Ho was really injured, just how strong was his opponent?\u201dAccording to Tae-Shik, Lee Sun-Ho was most likely stronger than Lucifer. So Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t imagine someone like him getting injured.-If Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho was really injured, we could have a serious problem in our hands. The Angela Guild has excellent healers, and Lee Sun-Ho is known to use great potions like it costs nothing. So, if he has an untreatable injury\u2026The reporter gulped loudly and continued.-Doesn\u2019t this mean he might need the elixir?Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes sparkled as he watched.-But, that\u2019s only if the rumor is true.-I suppose we\u2019ll find out if we watch what Angela Guild does next. If they begin searching for the elixir, it will confirm that Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho was indeed injured.Gi-Gyu quietly turned off the TV.\u2018Lucifer has the last elixir bottle.\u2019Even after giving Gi-Gyu two elixir bottles, Lucifer was still left with one more. Of course, there was a probability that it wasn\u2019t the only elixir around: Maybe there was a vial or two of the elixir circulating the black market.If Lee Sun-Ho was really looking for the elixir, would he fight Lucifer for it?\u201cI\u2019m going too far with this,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. It was most likely that Lee Sun-Ho wasn\u2019t wounded at all. With this thought, Gi-Gyu opened his cell phone: There was something he had to find out.Gi-Gyu needed to do his research on the association president. There wasn\u2019t much-known information about this elderly man. All Gi-Gyu knew about him now was that he was pretty old and a legendary figure. Strangely, not even the association president\u2019s real name or age was known to the public.\u201cI better learn as much about him as possible before the dinner.\u201dThe president couldn't have asked Gi-Gyu for dinner just to make an acquaintance. There had to be something the elderly man wanted from Gi-Gyu. Why would someone so important invite him to a meal?Gi-Gyu wondered what the president wanted from him. What could it be?\u2018Tae-Shik hyung assured me that he\u2019ll try his best to keep my information hidden from the president.\u2019Since that day, Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu had continued to talk regularly. Tae-Shik told Gi-Gyu that he didn\u2019t know why the president wanted to see Gi-Gyu. Tae-Shik suspected that it was simply because his father, the association president, was interested in Gi-Gyu. But this reason still didn\u2019t make any sense to Gi-Gyu.Gi-Gyu wondered if the president received the report about Lucifer and the elixir. But Tae-Shik was adamant that there was no way this could\u2019ve happened.As Gi-Gyu searched the internet, he muttered, \u201cI can\u2019t find anything about him\u2026\u201dThere wasn\u2019t even a photo of the association president on the internet. Even Gi-Gyu wouldn\u2019t have known how the president looked had he not seen him that day.But, how was this possible? How could such a public figure remain this mysterious?Disappointed that he couldn\u2019t find anything, Gi-Gyu had no other choice but to wait.***\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu scratched his head and looked up at the building. It was where he was supposed to have dinner with the association president. But\u2026\u201cThis is Tae-Shik hyung\u2019s apartment\u2026 He\u2019s so rich, so why won\u2019t he move to a better place?\u201dGi-Gyu was escorted here tonight by a chauffeur. He found their route a bit too familiar, and when the car finally stopped, he realized he was in front of Tae-Shik\u2019s apartment building.Gi-Gyu got in the elevator and reached Tae-Shik\u2019s apartment.Ding-dong!The doorbell rang, and the door opened.\u201cWelcome.\u201dThe greeter was none other than the association president. He was wearing an apron and was currently wiping his hands with it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41. Oh Tae-Gu (2)Since the association president invited him, Gi-Gyu knew there was a chance Tae-Shik might join them. However, eating in Tae-Shik\u2019s apartment and seeing the mighty president in an apron was definitely out of his expectation.The president said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cWhy are you just standing there? Come on in.\u201d\u201cAh, of course. Excuse me\u2026 Pfft!\u201d When Gi-Gyu entered the apartment, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from bursting into laughter. Wearing an apron and rubber gloves, Tae-Shik was washing the dishes in the kitchen.The president explained, \u201cYou arrived a little earlier than I expected. I apologize for the mess. Could you have a seat and wait for a minute? I just found out that Oh Tae-Shik has been treating his house like a pigsty.\u201d\u201cI would love to help,\u201d offered Gi-Gyu as he pulled up his sleeves. But the president shook his head and replied, \u201cNot a chance. You\u2019re our guest. I\u2019m already mortified that I invited you to such a messy place; I could never make you help us clean. I\u2019m making dinner right now, so please give us a minute.\u201dThe elderly man returned to the kitchen and continued to make Korean soybean paste soup. It was surreal watching the association president make dinner for Gi-Gyu. What was even shocking was the aroma wafting from the stew. Was he the association president or a chef?\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik was busy vacuuming the living room. When his eyes met Gi-Gyu\u2019s, the big man laughed awkwardly.Gi-Gyu whispered, \u201cThis is very refreshing.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 That old man is so annoying. It\u2019s normal for a man\u2019s house to be a little messy.\u201d When Tae-Shik made an excuse, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cBut my mom wouldn\u2019t like a messy house like this.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSuddenly, Tae-Shik began to vacuum faster. He was at one time a famous high ranker, so when Tae-Shik put his mind to it, his whole house sparkled even before the dinner was ready.\u201cSee? I knew you could do it. Gosh\u2026 Now, we can eat,\u201d the president, now satisfied, announced with a smile.On the dining table was a bowl of Korean soybean paste stew, kimchi, and steamed rice. It was a very simple meal.The president explained, \u201cI know there isn\u2019t much to eat, but I can guarantee you it tastes great. I hope you enjoy it.\u201d\u201cI hate to admit it, but this old man can really cook, Gi-Gyu.\u201d When Tae-Shik agreed, the association president smacked his head with a spoon.Thud!\u201cHey! Why would you hit me with a spoon like that?!\u201d\u201cYou sounded so stupid that I didn\u2019t realize I was hitting someone\u2019s head! How dare you speak to your father like that?!\u201d When the president shouted, Gi-Gyu blinked in shock.\u2018What?\u2019\u201cW-wait!\u201d Tense and confused, Gi-Gyu looked back and forth between Tae-Shik and the association president. Then, he murmured, \u201cY-you do resemble each other!\u201dGi-Gyu hadn\u2019t paid much attention before, but now that he studied them carefully with his sharpened eyes, he could see the resemblance.Tae-Shik wondered out loud, \u201cHuh? Haven\u2019t I told you before?\u201d He tilted his head and said, \u201cThis old man is my father.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dClicking his tongue, the president asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cDidn\u2019t he tell you about me, Young Man?\u201d\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d Gi-Gyu put his spoon down, still unable to process this new information. He had always known Tae-Shik was a great man. After all, he was a pioneer, a ranker, a high ranker, and now the association's general manager. Tae-Shik carried many admirable and shocking titles, but this was the most astonishing one of them all.Tae-Shik was the association president\u2019s son.\u201cHyung\u2026 So you were born with a diamond spoon in your mouth, huh?\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered. In the minds of many, the association president of a country was even more powerful than that country\u2019s president. And there was a simple reason behind this: The association president had authority over players.Unlike a country\u2019s president, whom the people elected, the president of the Global Players Association selected the president for each association branch in every country. The public respected the person in this position even more than their country\u2019s president.And Tae-Shik was this great man\u2019s son.\u201cBut you always knew how amazing I am, didn't you?\u201d Tae-Shik teased Gi-Gyu\u201cLet\u2019s just eat first. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to chat later,\u201d the president announced.\u201cOf course, Sir,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied respectfully. He was a little more cautious with how he spoke now that he knew this man was not only the association president but also Tae-Shik\u2019s father.Noticing how nervous Gi-Gyu looked, Tae-Shik said kindly, \u201cDon\u2019t be so anxious. You\u2019ll get sick if you eat while you\u2019re nervous.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dTheir meal began. Just like the president and Tae-Shik claimed, the Korean soybean paste soup tasted great. The dinner was also surprisingly pleasant. Contrary to Gi-Gyu\u2019s worries, the president didn\u2019t bring up any heavy topics. The elderly man actually seemed much more excited about criticizing his son.\u201cYou have no idea what a troublemaker this bastard was.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s living all alone as an old bachelor, so why won\u2019t he let me live with him?\u201d\u201cWhen I talk to you about this jerk of a son, I feel like I\u2019m talking with my grandson, Young Man.\u201dIt seemed that the president had many pent-up emotions against his son. It was clear he enjoyed grumbling about Tae-Shik to Gi-Gyu. After the meal, the president brought out some tea for everyone.\u201cNow, shall we get to the main business?\u201d the president asked.\u201cYes, of course.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, the association president smiled and introduced himself.\u201cLet\u2019s start from the beginning. My name is Oh Tae-Gu, and I am the current president of the association\u2019s Korean branch.\u201dThen, President Oh Tae-Gu\u2014possibly the most powerful man in Korea\u2014offered his hand to Gi-Gyu.***\u201cIt sounds like you got much help from Tae-Shik,\u201d Oh Tae-Gu murmured.\u201cYes, the general manager has helped me a great deal.\u201d When Gi-Gyu agreed, the association president smiled proudly. But his face quickly tensed as he added, \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that you were always only on the receiving end.\u201d\u201cI am well aware of that.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201d Oh Tae-Gu clicked his tongue as he rubbed his white beard. The association president probably warned Tae-Shik to keep quiet beforehand, as sipping his tea silently was all he did during this conversation. Since Tae-Shik didn\u2019t seem worried, Gi-Gyu knew whatever the elderly man wanted to say wasn't harmful.The president continued, \u201cTae-Shik may claim he was the one who helped you, but he can\u2019t do all that with his power alone. He definitely used his authority as the general manager to help you, so you have to admit that it was partly the association that aided you\u2014\u201d\u201cI must disagree there, Sir. Everything General Manager Oh Tae-Shik did to help me was his own doing. He might\u2019ve used his authority in the association to help, but since he reached this position on his own, I believe he\u2019s the one who helped me, not your organization.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied confidently, Oh Tae-Gu didn\u2019t seem upset. He looked interested and murmured, \u201cWhat a daring young man.\u201dGi-Gyu continued, \u201cI know I\u2019m being shameless, but I do not consider myself indebted to the association. I owe everything to the general manager, no, Tae-Shik hyung.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, Old Man? This boy is going to be big,\u201d Tae-Shik chimed proudly. Nodding, Oh Tae-Gu asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cBut you aren\u2019t expecting to continue receiving this kind of help, right? What Tae-Shik has done for you is already over the top. And it was surely beyond what he could do for you on his own.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and replied, \u201cI do not expect any more help from him. I already have so much debt I need to repay.\u201dTae-Gu\u2019s eyes became serious as he offered, \u201cBut I would like you to keep receiving help.\u201dGi-Gyu listened without a word as Tae-Gu continued, \u201cBut not in Tae-Shik\u2019s name anymore; I want you to receive the association\u2019s help.\u201d\u201cI do not want that.\u201d Gi-Gyu was firm in his answer. He explained, \u201cIf I\u2019m under some organization, I will be bound by its limitations. I do not want that for myself, Sir.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t beat around the bush. So let me put it to you straight; I don\u2019t want you to join the association.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked with curiosity. He thought the president was offering this assistance with the prerequisite that he would have to work for the association. However, it seemed the elderly man had a different idea.Tae-Gu elaborated, \u201cI\u2019m very interested in you. My curiosity began because of Tae-Shik\u2019s involvement, and what I found about you was fascinating. A player who couldn\u2019t level up worked as a guide for five years; then, he suddenly began smashing through multiple levels like they were nothing. I heard you even entered the Maze of Heryond and came out in one piece.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t bother denying this. After all, Tae-Gu was the association president: He had to have eyes everywhere.\u201cSo you survived the Maze of Heryond, and you and your mother\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t get my mother involved,\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered as his eyes turned cold. Suddenly, a violent aura flooded Tae-Shik\u2019s living room. Clicking his tongue, Tae-Gu explained, \u201cTsk\u2026 I didn\u2019t put surveillance on your family or anything. I was just very invested in your mother\u2019s cure, which is the only reason why I know what happened.\u201d\u201cWhy were you interested in my mother\u2019s health, President?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYou can ask Tae-Shik about that later.\u201dAs Gi-Gyu calmed down, the violent aura began dissipating. The elderly man grumbled, \u201cSuch hot temper. You\u2019re just like Tae-Shik in that area. Anyway, I hear you got two elixir bottles in the maze. You took one too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cI find you very interesting. I wonder what your secret is. Well, I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s important is that you\u2019re a talented player, and you will become even stronger as time passes. That is why I want to invest in you.\u201dClack.Tae-Gu took a sip of his tea before placing his cup on the table. He continued, \u201cThe association will never ask you to obey its orders. All we ask in return is for you to agree to some favors from time to time. Think of it as a request. There will, of course, be appropriate rewards when you complete these requests. On top of it, the association will do its best to take care of your well-being and growth.\u201d\u201cRequests?\u201d\u201cYes, requests. I\u2026\u201d Oh Tae-Gu\u2019s wrinkled face crumpled into a smile as he paused. The current bright smile on the elderly man\u2019s face made him look like a young man in his 20s.\u201cI would like you to become our hired soldier.\u201d***\u201cHyung, your father\u2026 I just don\u2019t understand what the president must be thinking.\u201d Gi-Gyu wondered after Tae-Gu left. He claimed he had much work to finish at the office. After the president was gone, Tae-Shik told Gi-Gyu he took the day off, so he was free. In the end, Gi-Gyu stayed behind to chat with Tae-Shik.Of course, the main topic was Gi-Gyu becoming the association\u2019s hired soldier.Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cA hired soldier?! That\u2019s such a vague term. He\u2019s saying I won\u2019t belong to the association, but he\u2019ll still give me all the benefits even though I\u2019ll be an outsider. I just don\u2019t understand what he wants from me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it,\u201d replied Tae-Shik as he brought two cups of instant coffee. It seemed he didn\u2019t like the tea Tae-Gu made for them earlier. Tae-Shik explained, \u201cThat old man likes you just like I do. He recognizes a great player when he sees one. I think he wants to help you, but there is a limit to how much he can do for you as an individual.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu nodded, Tae-Shik continued, \u201cSo he\u2019s trying to make an excuse to help you as much as possible. The association has several hired soldiers on retainer already. They are all great players.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the identities of these players since it's a top secret known only to the most important members of the association,\u201d explained Tae-Shik.\u201cI think I can make a few educated guesses.\u201dTae-Shik smiled and added, \u201cAnyway, you\u2019ll get to be at the same level as those great players. All you have to do is receive all the help you can get and accept only the requests you like. I didn\u2019t think this was a bad offer, so I didn\u2019t say anything earlier.\u201d\u201cI know, but I still don\u2019t understand one thing.\u201d Gi-Gyu looked confused as he asked, \u201cWhy is he helping me? I don\u2019t think your father is the type to help someone just because he likes that person. And you said there are many other hired soldiers working for the association. So what is the president's real reason for helping me and those other soldiers?\u201d\u201cWell\u201d\u2014Tae-Shik emptied his cup\u2014\u201cour enemy is too strong.\u201dTae-Shik looked straight into Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes as he continued, \u201cFrom your recent experience, we have learned how powerful the devils, the Tower, the gates, and the other foreign guilds are. They are much stronger than we expected. For now, it may look like everyone wants to keep the peace, but trouble can arise at any time. My father wants to prepare for such a time. He\u2019s trying to secretly commission as many hired soldiers as possible while strengthening the Korean association. He\u2019ll try his best to make the Korean branch follow the right path, and\u2026\u201dAfter contemplating the correct term, Tae-Shik finished his explanation, \u201cHe wants a secret weapon: A secret weapon that can defeat our enemies. However, before agreeing to anything, you\u2019ve to understand something. My father uses the association\u2019s power to provide a safe environment for all his hired soldiers, which helps them grow faster. It won\u2019t be easy for you to refuse his requests if you become his hired soldier.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cBut, this also doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll become a slave to his command. There will be no penalties even if you refuse his request. You can even refuse to receive any and all requests if you wish.\u201dScratching his head, Tae-Shik added, \u201cBut what you have to understand is my old man owns the unholy trifecta: Cold, cunning, and calculating.\u201dNow, Gi-Gyu had much to think about, so he chatted with Tae-Shik late into the night before taking the cab back home.***A week had passed since the dinner, and Gi-Gyu used that time to organize his thoughts regarding his complicated situation. The main thing he needed to decide was whether to accept Tae-Gu\u2019s offer.Gi-Gyu thought about the pros and cons of becoming a hired soldier. He also contemplated what he wanted for himself in the future. Was Tae-Gu\u2019s offer going to help Gi-Gyu achieve what he wanted?After much thought, Gi-Gyu entered Tae-Shik\u2019s office and announced, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dGi-Gyu had researched all the information he had gathered until now. Based on what he knew, the answer was obvious: Gi-Gyu had to accept the association president\u2019s offer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42. Oh Tae-Gu (3)Tae-Shik didn\u2019t approve or disapprove of Gi-Gyu\u2019s decision. He just wordlessly sent Gi-Gyu to the association president\u2019s office.\u201cI\u2019ve never been here before,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. He had visited the association building countless times, but he never got a chance to see the president\u2019s office before.Knock, knock!\u201cCome in,\u201d the now-familiar voice answered from inside. Gi-Gyu opened the door and entered as he greeted, \u201cHave you been well, Sir?\u201d\u201cI have. Please have a seat,\u201d replied Oh Tae-Gu.Gi-Gyu looked around the president\u2019s office slowly as he sat down on a luxurious sofa. The room reminded him of his junior high principal's office that he visited on cleaning duty. The association president\u2019s room was appropriately elegant and authoritative.Tae-Gu also looked very different from when Gi-Gyu saw him in Tae-Shik\u2019s apartment. Instead of the lacy apron, the president was now in a tasteful suit. As would be expected from Tae-Shik\u2019s father, Oh Tae-Gu was a large, sturdy man with an unusual aura about him.The president asked, \u201cSo I hear you\u2019ve decided.\u201d\u201cYes, I couldn\u2019t think of any reason to refuse your offer.\u201d\u201cGood,\u201d Tae-Gu replied as a pleased smile spread on his face. He continued, \u201cFrom now on, you will have the same authority as General Manager Oh Tae-Shik. Of course, unlike him, you will not be burdened with responsibilities that come with such power. Tsk. Isn\u2019t this an amazing deal for you?\u201d\u201cPardon\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you that you can now wield power comparable to a general manager. The association will treat you as such; of course, your status will remain a secret to the public,\u201d Tae-Gu explained with a smile as he studied Gi-Gyu\u2019s reaction.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help being shocked by this news. He expected to receive some perks by accepting the president\u2019s offer, but what he got was beyond his wildest expectation.Based on all that Tae-Shik had done for him, Gi-Gyu knew a general manager wielded substantial power.\u00a0A general manager could even command an entire association branch in emergency cases.Impressed by the president\u2019s generosity, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThat\u2019s very magnanimous of you.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m old, so all I have left are my bones and my magnanimity. I suppose you could say I\u2019m kind to my bones. Did you get the pun?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I definitely agree with your self-assessment, Sir,\u201d When Gi-Gyu concurred, the old man grinned and replied, \u201cWhat an agreeable young man you are. I like you even more now.\u201dThe president continued with a firm nod, \u201cFrom now, the association will be responsible for your family\u2019s safety. Nothing can change this. You can refuse my requests, quit being a hired soldier, and even die, but the protection will always be there.\u201d\u201cI am grateful for your kindness and consideration.\u201d Gi-Gyu bowed deeply. This was the biggest reason why he decided to become a hired soldier. Since Gi-Gyu was out often, the association\u2019s protection of his family could prove to be the most significant merit of this job. It was akin to a second layer of protection around his family.The president suggested, \u201cYou should keep Sung-Hoon as your secretary. That boy is a smart one, isn\u2019t he? I think he likes you too, so this is perfect. Sung-Hoon will also be necessary for you to exercise your authority since your identity will need to remain a secret. You will require a few mechanisms that will vouch for your identity.\u201d\u201c...\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t refuse the suggestion, Oh Tae-Gu added, \u201cSince you aren\u2019t saying no, you must approve of Sung-Hoon.\u201dClosing his eyes for a moment, the president continued, \u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019re looking into the devils.\u201d\u201c...!\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes widened in awareness.\u201cTae-Shik used to be a high ranker, but he didn\u2019t keep his position for a long time. He just wasn\u2019t cut out for that role. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t know much. But most high rankers know about the devils. You know what that means, right? This is a secretive topic. So, I\u2019m curious why you want to learn about these creatures.\u201d\u201cY-you mean\u2026?\u201dTae-Gu opened his eyes and looked at Gi-Gyu quietly. Tae-Gu\u2019s aura was as calm as the sea, but goosebumps still rose all around Gi-Gyu\u2019s body as if a poisonous snake was coiling around his neck.The president calmly announced, \u201cMy code name is Asura.\u201d\u201c...!\u201d\u201cAnd I am still an active high ranker.\u201dFinally, the association president\u2019s identity was coming to light.***\u201cI\u2019ve already heard about how you survived the Maze of Heryond and obtained two elixir bottles. You have already crossed paths with many high rankers, including Ironshield and Lucifer, correct?\u201d When the president asked, Gi-Gyu nodded.Gi-Gyu\u2019s head was still spinning from the information he got a moment ago.\u2018I knew the association president had to be a powerful player, but I can\u2019t believe he is THE Asura\u2014one of the greatest high rankers in history.\u2019Asura was a legendary high ranker whose identity had always been a mystery. Unlike the other high rankers, the public didn\u2019t even know his nationality. Sadly, a name without a face didn\u2019t last long in anyone's memory. With time, Lee Sung-Ho became so famous that Asura lost his fame, but this didn\u2019t change that Asura was a true legend.\u2018Asura is one of the first five original high rankers, and he was known as the strongest player until Lee Sun-Ho appeared in the picture.\u2019So Oh Tae-Gu, the president of the Korean branch, was Asura.\u201cWhat kind of contact have you had with the devil?\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t answer this question. Lou currently possessed a fragment of a devil, but Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t sure if he should disclose this information.When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond, the president continued, \u201cI\u2026 cannot tell you more about the devil just yet. This secret isn\u2019t something you can bear at the moment. There are several reasons why I give select powerful players the name \u2018hired soldiers\u2019 and great authority. All you need to know now is that one of the reasons has something to do with the devils and that the devils have a very close relationship with the Tower and the gates. But it\u2019s too premature for you to get deeper into this issue. You\u2019ll only put yourself in danger if you jump into something you\u2019re not ready for.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. He was still a bit shocked from learning about the president, but he was slowly regaining control over his emotions.\u201cI\u2019ll call you soon. Think of it as my first request. You can, of course, refuse if you wish.\u201d\u201cI will visit from time to time, Sir.\u201d When Gi-Gyu offered vaguely, Oh Tae-Gu clicked his tongue and replied, \u201cTsk. You may leave.\u201dGi-Gyu rose and bowed deeply. He was bowing not to the association president Oh Tae-Gu, but to Asura, one of the five original high rankers and a legend.When he left the president\u2019s room, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d He thought he had recovered from the shock, but he still needed more time to digest this new information.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed as he slumped his shoulders.-Cheer up!He still had a long way to go.***Several days had passed since Gi-Gyu became a hired soldier.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Sung-Hoon approached Gi-Gyu from afar, clapping all that way.\u201cIs getting a driver\u2019s license at my age really something to celebrate?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked in confusion, Sung-Hoon explained with a wink, \u201cNo, of course not. I was congratulating you for receiving authority comparable to a general manager.\u201d\u2018He sure knows a lot.\u2019Gi-Gyu realized long ago that Sung-Hoon probably had a close relationship with Tae-Shik and Tae-Gu. Suddenly, a thought popped in Gi-Gyu\u2019s head. He asked, \u201cAre you the president\u2019s son too?\u201d\u201cPardon? What are you\u2014\u201d\u201cWait, you have a different surname. Then again, you and Tae-Shik hyung could\u2019ve different mothers. Perhaps you were born out of wedlock, so you can\u2019t publicly call the president \u2018father\u2019 or take his last name.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Sung-Hoon scratched his head in confusion. Soon it became apparent that Sung-Hoon had no idea what Gi-Gyu was talking about, so Gi-Gyu shrugged and replied, \"Haa\u2026 Never mind. I don\u2019t think anything can surprise me anymore.\u201dGi-Gyu spent the last few days getting a driver\u2019s test. He loved his new home near the Bukhan River, but the public transportation system in his neighborhood was awful. It made moving around hard for his entire family.If Gi-Gyu requested a chauffeur from the association, he knew the organization would send him one. But if possible, he wanted to drive his family himself. Thankfully, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t let the player race down and passed his driver\u2019s test on his first attempt.\u201cOh, and this is for you.\u201d When Sung-Hoon took out a small box and offered, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAre you proposing to me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you\u2026 Of course not! Besides, I like women.\u201d Sung-Hoon chuckled at Gi-Gyu\u2019s joke. When Gi-Gyu took the box and opened it, he murmured, \u201cI think you really were proposing, Sung-Hoon.\u201dInside the box was a beautiful white gold ring embossed with an extravagant shield. It was an insignia that symbolized the association.Sung-Hoon explained, \u201cFrom now on, this will represent your identity, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. You can walk into any country\u2019s association branch, and the officials there will recognize you thanks to the ring. They will treat you like a general manager, and the ring also gives you an SS rank player qualification as a side bonus.\u201d\u201cHuh. So this holds that much power?\u201d\u201cIndeed. But firstly, you\u2019ve to insert your mana into it so that it\u2019ll belong only to you,\u201d Sung-Hoon explained. Just as Sung-Hoon suggested, Gi-Gyu put his mana into the ring. A bright light gathered on top of the ring for a moment before disappearing suddenly.Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cAll manager level association members know about that ring, so all you have to do is show it to whoever is in charge. Then, you\u2019ll be able to wield your authority without any problem.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d When Gi-Gyu seemed impressed, Sung-Hoon smiled playfully and asked, \u201cPlease look inside the ring.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThere was something in English written inside the ring. Embarrassed he couldn\u2019t read it, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t even bother to know what it said. When he remained quiet, Sung-Hoon explained, \u201cYou must\u2019ve guessed by now that most of the association\u2019s hired soldiers are high rankers, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I thought. Why else would this much power be given to them?\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Sung-Hoon laughed in amusement.\u2018Sung-Hoon definitely knows a lot.\u2019If he ever got a chance, Gi-Gyu planned on finding out more about this mysterious man. With a slight nod, Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cBy the way, have you heard about the chicken debate?\u201d\u201cThe chicken debate?\u201dSung-Hoon\u2019s lips curled up slightly. By now, Gi-Gyu had realized that subtle smile was Sung-Hoon\u2019s tell: It meant he was about to tell Gi-Gyu a secret. Sung-Hoon clarified his question, \u201cDid the high rankers become hired soldiers? Or was it the hired soldiers who became high rankers?\u201dSung-Hoon\u2019s smile widened, and Gi-Gyu now understood what Sung-Hoon meant. Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAre you telling me that other hired soldiers became high rankers because they were hired soldiers?\u201d\u201cExactly. The President is an excellent judge of a player\u2019s talent. It looks like he has high hopes for you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes, but I think we\u2019re digressing again. Anyway, I\u2019m telling you this because\u2014\u201d Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t have to finish his explanation because Gi-Gyu was now better at making good guesses.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cMy code name.\u201dSung-Hoon\u2019s smile widened even more; this man really enjoyed divulging secrets. Every high ranker had a code name. Sung-Hoon announced proudly, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu, your code name is Morningstar. You were titled as such in the hopes that you\u2019ll become our new rising star.\u201dMorningstar. It was pure coincidence that Gi-Gyu\u2019s code name was the same as Kim Sun-Pil\u2019s guild. Kim Sun-Pil did say that he chose this name because he admired Gi-Gyu, whom he believed to be a warm and kind man willing to help others when needed.But after going through so much, Gi-Gyu's nature had taken a turn.\u2018I\u2019m no longer that kind man anymore.\u2019Gi-Gyu slowly placed the white gold ring on his finger. He already had Lou and El on his fingers, so now he had three extravagant rings on his hands. But for some reason, they suited him. Instead of looking over the top, they gave Gi-Gyu a refined aura.Ambling ahead, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cI understand the association giving its hired soldiers code names. But why do the high rankers in the other countries have code names too?\u201dSung-Hoon scratched his head and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that the other countries also protect and invest in their high rankers, so that might be why. If not, it may also be because it has become a tradition now.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and asked with a playful smile, \u201cDid you bring the car?\u00a0My\u00a0brand new car?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu asked for his car, Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cUgh\u2026 You don\u2019t have to spell it out like that. I know it\u2019s\u00a0your\u00a0car, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dGi-Gyu walked up to his car, opened the door, and murmured, \u201cI feel excited just knowing that this is my car, a brand new one at that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve made it big, Gi-Gyu!\u201d Sung-Hoon smiled and got into the passenger seat. Turning toward Gi-Gyu, he began, \u201cNow, start with adjusting your seat. Then, check your side mirrors and the emergency brake\u2014\u201d\u201cI know. I just got my license, remember? Just fasten your seatbelt.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied confidently, Sung-Hoon fastened his seatbelt with a worried look.Clack!Gi-Gyu changed the gear to \u201cDrive\u201d and slowly pressed the accelerator pedal.\u201cAcckkk!\u201d Sung-Hoon screamed as the car jolted into full speed.\u201cHuh?! This\u2026\u201d\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu! You can\u2019t press the accelerator that hard! I mean! Gi-Gyu! You gotta slow down! I know we can survive a car crash, but still\u2026 No! Please! Ackk! Dammit! Ugh!\u201d As the car roared to life, Sung-Hoon roared for his life.That day, the motorists on the street witnessed the birth of a new villainous driver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43. Phoenix Guild\u201cGosh, I\u2019m tired,\u201d Gi-Gyu mumbled as he sat down on the ground. He wasn\u2019t talking about just his physical fatigue. Currently, his psyche was as drained as the other side of a dam. Much time had passed since he obtained his driver\u2019s license; he was on the 24th floor now.Gi-Gyu spent all his time hunting non-stop inside the Tower. He was practically living there.-How could you be tired already? We still have a long way to go before reaching the 30th floor.Lou announced in annoyance.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply and muttered, \u201cAnd why do you think I\u2019m hunting these monsters who don\u2019t even give me that many experience points? Who do you think I\u2019m doing this for?\u201d-Aaa\u2026If Lou had a face, Gi-Gyu could see him turning away in embarrassment. So, why was Gi-Gyu so tired? Well, that had a simple answer: Lou had to absorb monsters\u2019 blood to increase his stats. Based on a monster\u2019s forte, Lou could increase his stats in the corresponding attribute after absorbing their blood.However, there was a limit to how much blood he could absorb from the same type of monster: It was different for each monster taxon. For example, the limit for the 4th-floor orcs was 100, and 1000 for the stoneflies.Anyway, all that was old news. Right now, Gi-Gyu had a big problem on his shoulders: All his Egos had stopped leveling up. Bi and Hermes have reached a stable level. Lou and El had levels too high for the floor he was on, so they weren\u2019t leveling up either.Even though Lou\u2019s level wasn\u2019t going up, his stats thankfully were. Lamentably, absorbing blood to gain stat points worked only for Lou. So while he was enjoying steady growth, his fellow Egos\u2019 progress remained stagnant.Gi-Gyu contemplated out loud, \u201cAm I doing the right thing?\u201dHe wondered if he should ascend quickly to the higher floors and return to hunt these lower-floor monsters once he got stuck at some point. Was delaying his other Egos\u2019 progression for Lou really the right thing?-Are you asking this because you don\u2019t know the answer, or\u2026\u201cI know, I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m even more frustrated.\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed again. It was never a good idea to ascend the Tower too fast. And even if he decided to ascend now, all he would be doing was delaying the inevitable. Moreover, returning to these lower floors would actually make it harder for his Egos to level up in the long run. Consequently, his ascent to even higher floors would be delayed.\u201cBesides, it will be easier for me to climb the Tower if you become stronger, Lou.\u201dThis was the simple truth. The stats Lou absorbed from monsters helped Gi-Gyu immensely. Moreover, Lou could not only absorb stats from monsters, but he could also steal a percentage of what made them special. For example, Lou obtained a portion of the 23rd-floor stoneflies\u2019 defense option.If Lou continued to gain more options, it would eventually help Gi-Gyu climb the Tower much faster.\u201cThis is why I can\u2019t give up continuing hunting on these lower floors. El, please be patient a little while longer. Lou still hasn\u2019t caught up with you.\u201d-Thank you for your kindness, Master. I agree that our priority should be your overall strength rather than my own. I do not want to see you suffer anymore, Master.\u201cIf Lou were half as considerate as you, I would love him so much more, El.\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help smiling at El\u2019s kind words.-Hmph!!!Ignoring Lou, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure Bi and Hermes will also like to start leveling up soon.\u201dOf course, there was no answer from his pseudo Egos. Nonetheless, Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly and muttered, \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll grow consciousness someday.\u201dThe Egos Old Man Hwang created were only fragments. Despite having powers similar to Egos, they were just mindless, empty shells. According to Lou, they were nothing more than fakes. But despite their lack of consciousness, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling genuine affection toward these pseudo Egos. They reminded him of when he was weak. This was why Gi-Gyu talked to Bi and Hermes from time to time even though he knew they couldn\u2019t respond. Who knows? Maybe something might happen in the future that gives these Egos a gift of awareness.\u201cLet\u2019s just get back to hunting,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced as he looked at his old watch. If he was quick, he could kill enough monsters for Lou to gain a few more stat points before dinner.***Gi-Gyu muttered awkwardly, \u201cI had no idea driving normally is this hard.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be called the villainous driver, this is necessary.\u201d Heo Sung-Hoon replied firmly. Ever since Gi-Gyu got his driver\u2019s license, he drove the car himself to get to the Tower. Sung-Hoon, of course, was always by his side.Sung-Hoon had screamed and shrieked the first time Gi-Gyu drove him in his car. After witnessing what a terrible driver Gi-Gyu was, Sung-Hoon insisted on teaching Gi-Gyu to be a better driver by following him every day.\u201cI can go faster; I can\u2019t believe I have to drive slower on purpose!\u201d This was Gi-Gyu\u2019s main complaint. He was confident that he could drive without getting into an accident. Thanks to his abilities from being a player and drinking the elixir, Gi-Gyu\u2019s reflexes were well beyond what an average non-player could ever dream of.Gi-Gyu was positive he could calmly react in any unexpected situation. He wanted to enjoy driving his incredible car at full speed, but he was very disappointed since he had to follow the ever-so-slow speed limit.\u201cI\u2019m not doing this because I\u2019m worried you might get into an accident, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d Sung-Hoon was determined to teach Gi-Gyu proper driving etiquette. He explained, \u201cThe problem is that the other drivers on the street will feel threatened when you drive like this. I know you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t get into an accident, but the other drivers don't know that a player\u2019s behind the wheel. To them, it could be a player or a drunkard. So what you\u2019re doing is violence!\u201dGi-Gyu had to agree since he felt Sung-Hoon was right. So, he let Sung-Hoon nag the entire time he drove. Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI think I would be angry as well if my mother or Yoo-Jung met a driver like me on the street.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You and everyone else will all be happy if you remember that!\u201d Sung-Hoon exclaimed in excitement. When Sung-Hoon refused to stop talking, Gi-Gyu briefly fantasized about a skill that could shut someone up. But he continued to drive calmly without voicing this thought.\u201cLook over there! Imagine a car like that constantly driving around you! That\u2019s violence! That's openly threatening behavior!\u201d Sung-Hoon yelled as he pointed at one of the cars ahead of them. It was a yellow sports car, and the driver was swerving side to side while blasting loud music. All the other cars around it were slowing down and trying their best to avoid this yellow sports car.Finally, Gi-Gyu understood Sung-Hoon\u2019s lesson and thought, \u2018No one should drive like that.\u2019Gi-Gyu decided to drive his car unhurriedly; soon, he overtook the yellow sports car. Ignoring the yellow car right behind him, he continued to drive slowly.Honkkkk!!!!!!!!!The yellow sports car honked loudly in frustration as Gi-Gyu\u2019s car blocked its way. Just when Gi-Gyu was about to give it space, the yellow car abruptly changed lanes. Gi-Gyu turned to look at what was happening and found the yellow car\u2019s driver screaming at him.\u201cYou stupid wench! If you\u2019re gonna drive like this, you should be staying home. Why are you out here annoying everyone?!\u201dThe driver was a young man giving Gi-Gyu the finger and swearing like there was no tomorrow.Crack!Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes narrowed in a fury, but he tried to calm down by taking slow breaths.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dNoticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s anger, Sung-Hoon begged, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be patient! This kind of thing happens all the time on the road! Are you going to get into a fight every time it happens?! You can\u2019t! You mustn\u2019t! Control yourself!\u201dThat was the smart choice, but the yellow car\u2019s driver was making it very hard for Gi-Gyu to calm down. The young man continued to scream, \u201cAnswer me, you idiot! Only women drive like you! So why don\u2019t you stay home and take care of your husband?! Do you really wanna shame your husband by driving his car like this?! Biiiiiiiitch!!!\u201dGi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI wonder if that man doesn\u2019t have a mother\u2026. He clearly has no respect for women.\u201dUnfortunately, the driver of the yellow sports car refused to stop. Gi-Gyu\u2019s car windows were heavily tinted, so the yellow car driver must\u2019ve thought a woman was driving it. Or perhaps the rude driver thought Gi-Gyu was too scared to respond because the yellow sports car continued to follow Gi-Gyu\u2019s car closely.Sung-Hoon said encouragingly, \u201cYou did very well, Gi-Gyu\u2026\u201dGrit.Sung-Hoon was trying to prevent a fight, but he was also furious, evident by his gritted teeth.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed and opened the window a little. Afraid of what Gi-Gyu might do, Sung-Hoon yelled, \u201cW\u2026what are you trying to do?!\u201dSung-Hoon was about to stop Gi-Gyu, but Gi-Gyu simply gave the young driver his middle finger. He kept it out for a while before closing the window. Sung-Hoon clapped and cheered, \u201cGood job!\u201dThe yellow car driver screamed even louder, \u201cY-you asshole! Dammit!\u201d Suddenly, the yellow sports car sped up ahead of Gi-Gyu\u2019s car.Vroom.Squeak!Swerving to the side, it blocked Gi-Gyu dangerously.Creak!Thanks to Gi-Gyu\u2019s enhanced reflexes, he managed to stop his car before it could crash into the yellow sports car.\u2018If it were a non-player driving this car, there would\u2019ve been an accident.\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s was nearest to exploding in anger.Meanwhile, several young men exited the yellow sports car and approached Gi-Gyu\u2019s car. They looked like they were about to destroy Gi-Gyu\u2019s car as they banged on his window.\u201cGet out! Dammit! Today\u2019s going to be your funeral, asshole! Get out!\u201d one of the young men screamed menacingly.\u201cYou\u2019re a man, yet this is how you drive?! Gosh, how could anyone give a driving license to someone like you!\u201d another man added.\u201cGet out right now!\u201d the driver of the yellow sports car shouted.\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu\u2026\u201d When Sung-Hoon murmured, Gi-Gyu said quietly, \u201cWe should get out.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d Sung-Hoon nodded. It seemed that Sung-Hoon was also fresh out of patience. When Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon exited the car, the men waiting outside took a step back hesitantly. They were surprised by Gi-Gyu\u2019s height and Sung-Hoon\u2019s menacing look, but that didn\u2019t deter them from strutting toward the duo for long. Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon were taller than they anticipated, but it was still four against two.Nudge, nudge\u2026The man, who looked like the driver, poked Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest as he declared, \u201cHey. If you\u2019re gonna drive like that, just hire a cab. A dying old man can drive better than you.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu realized the driver reeked of alcohol, he sighed and asked, \u201cHaa\u2026 Did you just hit me? And you\u2019re drunk too?\u201d\u201cWhat? Yeah, I touched you just now, so what? What are you gonna do about it?\u201d The man snickered at Gi-Gyu, whose lip curled up ominously. When Gi-Gyu looked at Sung-Hoon quietly, Sung-Hoon shook his head and mouthed, \u2018A player should never hit a non-player.\u2019Thinking Gi-Gyu was a coward, the driver asked with a grin, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is that tall body just for show? I\u2019m sure you must\u2019ve fought some in your day, Old Man! Hahaha!!! My friends and I are players, so you think you can handle us? I would love a good fight.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Both Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon gasped in shock.\u201cD-did he say he was a player?\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered.\u201cT-the man standing in front of us\u2026 He\u2019s a player?\u201d Sung-Hoon seemed just as confused. Why were they confused? Well, the driver\u2019s aura was so weak that Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t even register it. But since the men insisted, Gi-Gyu had no choice but to believe them.The driver probably mistook Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion as fear because he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Are you gonna wuss out?\u201dFeeling pleased with how things were working out in his favor, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you know what happens if a player attacks a non-player?\u201d\u201cYou think I\u2019m scared of that? My father is the director of the Phoenix Guild\u2019s Department of Strategy. Get it? We\u2019re talking about the Phoenix Guild here,\u201d the driver bragged.The Phoenix Guild was a rather famous group in Korea: It was one of the top ten guilds in Korea.With an intentionally disappointed face, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI see. So your father is a director in the Phoenix Guild\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! So you better kneel and beg for mercy!\u201d The man was now convinced that Gi-Gyu was terrified of him. He raised his hand to slap Gi-Gyu\u2019s cheek, but Gi-Gyu dodged it effortlessly.\u201cHuh? Did you just duck?\u201d The man seemed confused. He thought Gi-Gyu was a non-player, so he probably didn\u2019t expect Gi-Gyu to dodge his slap easily. Finally, a confused expression appeared on the man\u2019s face as he realized something was wrong.Gi-Gyu continued with a slow smile, \u201cHaha\u2026 So you\u2019re a player, and your father is some sort of director? That\u2019s perfect!\u201dLooking up straight at the man, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWell, here is the thing.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring that up to my close friend\u2019s father?\u201d\u201c...?\u201dEveryone tilted their head in confusion as they watched Gi-Gyu. Why was he suddenly bringing up his close friend\u2019s father here?Reaching for the rude man in front of him, Gi-Gyu punched his face hard as he yelled, \u201cThe president of the association, you asshole!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44. Phoenix Guild (2)Blushing profusely, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI admit that I acted childishly.\u201dCurrently, Gi-Gyu was sporting a bright red face: It was from embarrassment, not from his scuffle.\u201cA close friend\u2019s father\u2026 The president of the association\u2026 Pfft!\u201d When Sung-Hoon teased, Gi-Gyu quickly covered Sung-Hoon\u2019s mouth with his hand. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know why he said such a thing. All he knew was that his anger turned him into someone he wasn\u2019t.\u2018This is all your fault, Lou.\u2019When Gi-Gyu grumbled to his Ego, Lou replied sarcastically.-Why are you blaming me? This just shows what a terrible person you are.Gi-Gyu suspected his outburst was due to prolonged stress. He had been hunting incessantly for so long that he started yelling something so childish.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu sighed, Sung-Hoon tried to console him.\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. Everyone has an embarrassing moment or two in their life. I mean, I had\u2026 Mmph!!!\u201dGi-Gyu covered Sung-Hoon\u2019s mouth again. Glaring at Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon, the police officer standing nearby ordered, \u201cPlease be quiet over there.\u201dGi-Gyu lowered his face in shame and replied, \u201cOf course. I apologize.\u201dGi-Gyu, Sung-Hoon, and the four men from the yellow sports car were inside the police station. Many saw their fight, the one they had in the middle of the street, and reported them to the police. The six players involved were arrested on the spot and were brought to the police station.When Gi-Gyu saw one of the men he fought glaring at him, he asked, \u201cWhat is it? You got something to say to me?\u201dThe man was miserable: Both of his eyes were bruised, and his nose was still bleeding. His friends were in about the same sad condition. Watching these pathetic players, Gi-Gyu thought, \u2018It was so hard controlling my strength when I was beating them up earlier.\u2019These men were supposed to be players just like him, yet they were so fragile that Gi-Gyu was afraid they would die if he used his full force. So he made sure to control his strength during the fight, which turned out to be more challenging than the entire fight. Gi-Gyu had to land his punches with such precision that he was left unsatisfied even after beating the daylights out of his opponents.The man, glaring at Gi-Gyu a moment ago, lowered his face in fear.The policeman in charge announced, \u201cThey said they are on their way. It won\u2019t be long, so please be patient.\u201dGi-Gyu also lowered his face in shame and murmured, \u201cHaa\u2026 This is so embarrassing.\u201dThe fight earlier was between players, so the local police could deal with it. The association took care of all criminal cases involving players. Because this wasn\u2019t a huge fight, the association wasn\u2019t sending someone immediately. Had they used their abilities in a residential area, the Association Surveillance Department would\u2019ve sent an agent right away.Had their fight taken place in a public place and resulted in significant damage, it was very likely the association\u2019s Executive Department would\u2019ve gotten involved. It would've sent someone immediately to carry out a non-judicial punishment. The penalty and repercussions of something like that could be enormous and complicated.Gi-Gyu mumbled, \u201cFor now, let\u2019s not tell Tae-Shik hyung about this.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d Sung-Hoon nodded in agreement. Both men couldn\u2019t hide their embarrassment. How could they have fought in the middle of a street like common thugs? It would have been inappropriate for Gi-Gyu to use his hired soldier status to get out of this situation. In fact, he took the white gold association ring off his finger earlier and hid it in his pocket.Just like the policeman promised, an agent from the association arrived shortly. He introduced himself to the police, \u201cI\u2019m Yeo Sung-Gu from the Association Surveillance Department. These are the men you called about?\u201d\u201cYes, we detained them after receiving a report about some men fighting on the street. But it turned out that they are players,\u201d the policeman replied tensely. Finally, the ball was in the association\u2019s court.Yeo Sung-Gu looked around to check out each man involved in this incident. When he spotted the driver of the yellow sports car, he paused. It was only for a moment, but Gi-Gyu immediately realized something was wrong. No one else noticed it, but Yeo Sung-Gu\u2019s face turned dark.The agent announced with a sigh, \u201cHaa\u2026 You\u2019ll all need to go to the association first.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied and stood up. Since cases of such kind were usually dealt with inside the association building, the other men also didn\u2019t say much and followed obediently.Outside, a car from the surveillance department was waiting. Oddly, the agent ignored Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon and moved farther away to talk privately with the yellow car group. Gi-Gyu whispered to Sung-Hoon, \u201cDo you know that guy?\u201d\u201cNo, I belong to the portal maintenance team, a completely different department. And I don\u2019t have any friends in the surveillance department,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon as he shook his head.The four beaten-up men got into the association car. Yeo Sung-Gu walked up to Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon and offered, \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cI do.\u201d When Sung-Hoon nodded, the agent handed him a cigarette. The two smoked quietly while the white smoke clouded their vision a little. After a short silence, Yeo Sung-Gu began, \u201cI\u2019ve heard what happened from the police. Those guys were drunk driving, and they threatened you and made the first move. Am I correct?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied quietly.\u201cAnd that\u2019s when you assaulted them. They could barely move since they were intoxicated, but you still chose to fight those vulnerable men.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu suddenly realized something was wrong as the agent continued, \u201cSo\u2026 They made the first move, but you made sure they couldn\u2019t make the second. In other words, you beat a few vulnerable men to within an inch of their life for throwing a single punch.\u201d\u201cThat man tried to slap me first. And he thought I was a non-player.\u201d When Gi-Gyu insisted, Yeo Sung-Gu sighed in frustration. He threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped on it before replying, \u201cDo you know who the director of Phoenix Guild\u2019s strategy department is? That guy\u2019s father. This isn\u2019t going to end well. Had you let them beat you up, you could\u2019ve settled it with some money, but\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you telling me I should\u2019ve let him beat me up?\u201d Gi-Gyu frowned unhappily. Shaking his head, the agent replied, \u201cBut you hit him. Look at his face. Are you saying you believe you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here?\u201dGi-Gyu turned toward Sung-Hoon, who decided to let Gi-Gyu do whatever he wished. Turning toward the agent, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cThat man thought I was a non-player, yet he\u2014\u201dYeo Sung-Gu interrupted Gi-Gyu and instructed, \u201cBased on their injuries, I can tell you are a pretty high-level player. So you do know that the penalty increases with a player\u2019s level, right? If there is a huge difference between the levels of two fighters, even the self-defense claim doesn\u2019t apply. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201dThe agent was correct. If the gap between the two players was extreme, the self-defense claim didn\u2019t apply in an assault case. A high-level player couldn\u2019t fight back even if a lower-level player attacked them unless their opponent used a weapon or a special item.Gi-Gyu understood the logic behind this. If there was a significant level difference, the higher-level player could just ignore the lower-leveled player\u2019s attack. Still, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but feel furious. Yeo Sung-Gu, an association employee, should\u2019ve been an impartial and objective judge of this case. Yet, the agent wasn\u2019t worried about Gi-Gyu at all. He even told Gi-Gyu that he should just let it go since it was his fault.Trying his best to keep his voice calm, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAre you feeling lazy right now?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cIf you are really from the surveillance department, why are you playing favorites? You shouldn\u2019t try to twist this case into something you find easier to deal with.\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201d Yeo Sung-Go\u2019s face reddened as he stammered. But he recovered quickly and smirked at Gi-Gyu.\u201cWere you bribed by those men?\u201d When Gi-Gyu guessed, Yeo Sung-Gu cleared his throat and turned away.\u201cKhhmm.\u201dAs if coming to a decision, the agent replied, \u201cI was going to go easy on you, but I can see that you will not cooperate. We need to get to the association building first, so just get in the car. And give me your phones. I can\u2019t have you do anything that will interfere with this investigation.\u201dYeo Sung-Gu was annoyed, apparent by his disrespectful behavior toward Gi-Gyu. Sung-Hoon gasped when he asked for their phones, \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dSung-Hoon tried to argue, but Gi-Gyu stopped him. By now, Gi-Gyu had a good idea of what this agent and the four men were planning. Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon got into the car silently. The other four men from the yellow sports car snickered as they watched Gi-Gyu.It was now clear that the four men and the agent were on the same side. Sung-Hoon grabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s wrist as his eyes hinted, \u2018Not here.\u2019***In the car, the four men refused to stop mocking Gi-Gyu. Gi-Gyu respectfully asked Yeo Sung-Gu to control them, but the agent ignored Gi-Gyu\u2019s request. It appeared that the four men believed they had won.Something inside Gi-Gyu twitched. It was similar to anger, but it was something much more. Afraid it might explode at any time, Gi-Gyu clenched his fists tightly.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon looked out the window and said in confusion, \u201cWhere are we going? This isn\u2019t the way to the association building.\u201d\u201cDo you think you know everything about the association? You think you\u2019re a surveillance department agent? You know nothing, so just keep your mouth shut,\u201d replied Yeo Sung-Gu coldly.Gi-Gyu couldn't help smirking at the agent\u2019s behavior.\u2018Sung-Hoon works in the association too, making him this agent\u2019s colleague. Yet Yeo Sung-Gu is treating Sung-Hoon so rudely.\u2019Gi-Gyu unclenched his fists and leaned back comfortably. Noticing the change in Gi-Gyu\u2019s energy, Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cNot really,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered quietly. There was a simple term for what was going on: Farce. He has seen such stuff on the\u00a0news, but he never expected to play a part in one.When the car stopped, Yeo Sung-Gu opened the door and announced, \u201cPlease exit the car.\u201d The agent wasn\u2019t talking to Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon.The yellow sports car driver answered, \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived, Ahjussi?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Yeo Sung-Gu answered with a smile.\u201cHehehe! Hey, you guys should get out too,\u201d the one who picked the fight with Gi-Gyu leered and said to Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon. Then, he turned toward the agent and asked, \u201cYou called plenty of men here, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve called enough to take care of these two. And just in case, I even invited a special gentleman here.\u201d When Yeo Sung-Gu explained respectfully, the sports car driver shrugged and replied, \u201cOh, come on. Ahjussi, you overdid it. These jerks aren\u2019t that strong.\u201dThe four men exited the car, followed by Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon. Gi-Gyu saw that they were standing in front of an abandoned factory. They thought they were being driven to the association building, but instead, they arrived at an abandoned factory in the outskirts of Seoul.[1]\u00a0The surrounding area was so isolated and quiet that even murder could easily go unnoticed.And that was most likely why Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon were brought here.Sung-Hoon murmured in genuine displeasure, \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d He had no idea this kind of corruption dirtied his workplace, the association.\u201cWell, I suppose a fish can rot from the tail up,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a bitter smile. When the sports car driver saw Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon whispering leisurely, he shouted in annoyance, \u201cWhat the hell are you guys yapping about? Just get inside!\u201dYeo Sung-Gu, standing nearby, mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this.\u201d Perhaps he still had a little conscience left inside him, but he didn\u2019t do anything more to right the wrong. Atop that, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t feel any genuine remorse from the agent. Yeo Sung-Gu was obviously in cahoots with the four men. This agent was bringing shame to the association name.Sung-Hoon asked quietly, \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cIs there even a solution to this situation?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, Sung-Hoon tilted his head in contemplation and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But what if we can\u2019t handle what\u2019s waiting for us inside?\u201d\u201cThen we better run, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon chatted lazily. With a smirk, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cBased on what I can feel from the inside of the factory, I don\u2019t think we have anything to worry about. Besides, I have you with me, Sung-Hoon.\u201dGi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon followed the men obediently. Gi-Gyu had assessed the players that were about to surround them, so he suggested, \u201cWe better take care of the corrupt men here and now. Men like them can never elevate our society, so\u2026 It would be better to get rid of them now so they can\u2019t do any more damage. And Sung-Hoon, you might get a bonus if we take care of the corruption within the association.\u201dWith a determined nod, Sung-Hoon followed Gi-Gyu into the building.***Before Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon could enter the building, several men in black suits searched them; Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t resist. The men took away Sung-Hoon\u2019s spear, but they didn\u2019t find anything on Gi-Gyu. More specifically, they\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0find anything on him.After the body search was completed, the men led Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon inside the factory. The place was filled with players, and Gi-Gyu could even feel someone with significant power hiding in the shadows.One of the men in black suits ordered, \u201cGive me the dash cam memory card from your car.\u201d When the man raised his hand toward Gi-Gyu, Gi-Gyu took it out from his pocket and replied, \u201cYou mean this?\u201dThis memory card had the footage of what had happened earlier, so Gi-Gyu took it when he was taken to the police station.Gi-Gyu added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to!\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d the man in the black suit swore as he took a step forward to take the memory card away from Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand. But instead, he ended up stumbling as Gi-Gyu dodged him with incredible speed.The strongest player among the thugs present murmured, \u201cI guess we have a strong one here.\u201d Recognizing the man, Sung-Hoon tensed a little. But Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t turn toward Sung-Hoon to ask. Instead, he looked at the player and asked, \u201cYou belong to the Phoenix Guild too?\u201dThe powerful player murmured, \u201cWhat a rude young man you are.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t take a genius to realize that everyone in this factory belonged to the Phoenix Guild. What confused Gi-Gyu was how much sway the strategy department director held inside the guild. How could a single director command so many members for his personal use? On top of that, what they were doing right now was illegal. The director position was undoubtedly a powerful one. However, Gi-Gyu was still having a hard time believing he could send so many powerful members just to cover up his son\u2019s misdeed.The culprit of this situation hid behind the black-suited players and yelled suddenly, \u201cIdiot! You\u2019re standing in front of the Phoenix Guild\u2019s ranker, Choi Won-Jae!\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help smiling as he watched the prodigal son. Didn\u2019t he brag earlier that he was also a player? So why was he hiding behind the ranker like a coward?With a smirk on his face, Gi-Gyu mocked the ranker, \u201cHow can you call yourself a ranker when you obey an idiot like that? You must be so embarrassed for yourself.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a proud ranker, yet you spend your days wiping these bastards\u2019 asses?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Choi Won-Jae\u2019s face turned rigid in anger. Gi-Gyu usually didn\u2019t enjoy swearing, but he didn\u2019t exactly live a sheltered life. While working as a guide, he learned how to swear. But he learned the worst cuss words while working his various part-time jobs before becoming a player.When Gi-Gyu criticized him mercilessly, Choi Won-Jae\u2019s face turned red. Still trying to sound calm, the ranker offered, \u201cIf you give us that memory card and let the Young Maste\u2014I mean, this gentleman you assaulted earlier beat you until he feels better, we will let you live.\u201dChoi Jae-Won talked like he was making a generous offer.\u2018Young Master? So there is more to this than I thought, huh?\u2019The ranker\u2019s slip of the tongue allowed Gi-Gyu to learn a bit more about this situation. Looking worried, Sung-Hoon whispered to Gi-Gyu, \u201cYou know that Choi Won-Jae is a pretty powerful ranker, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d After reassuring Sung-Hoon, Gi-Gyu looked at Choi Won-Jae again and asked, \u201cAnd what if I refuse to give you my memory card?\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll leave in a body bag.\u201d With this threat, Choi Won-Jae began to move. Following his lead, the other Phoenix Guild members formed a circle around Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon. They were trying to prevent Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon from escaping the factory. It seemed like the men here had no intention of letting them live.\u201cHaa\u2026 I may be a novice driver, but all I did was try to get home,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in frustration.\u201cI apologize,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied as if everything was his fault.\u201cNo, there is no need for you to apologize, Sung-Hoon,\u201d announced Gi-Gyu as he began stretching his neck.-Will you be okay?Lou asked.\u2018Of course.\u2019-But you need to remember that they are still humans.Gi-Gyu grinned at Lou\u2019s warning as he turned the Ego into a sword. He muttered, \u201cThey aren\u2019t human. They\u2019re nothing more than garbage.\u201dNoticing the sword that appeared out of nowhere, the Phoenix Guild members exclaimed, \u201cW-where did that sword come from?\u201d\u201cIt must be a rare item!\u201dRight before everyone\u2019s eyes, a red and a white sword appeared in Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands.1. Seoul is the capital city of Korea.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45. Phoenix Guild (3)Gi-Gyu had been feeling something boiling deep inside him ever since he arrived at the abandoned factory. It wasn\u2019t something simple like anger; it was something different.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu was about to say something when Yeo Sung-Gu interrupted in panic, \u201cThey\u2019re nobodies! Don\u2019t be afraid and just attack!\u201dIf Gi-Gyu escaped this place, Yeo Sung-Gu would be in big trouble. The punishment for everything he had done in the last few hours wasn\u2019t something as simple as dismissal from the association.When Yeo Sung-Gu screamed, the Phoenix Guild members began to move. Choi Won-Jae, however, remained still as if he wanted to see how strong Gi-Gyu was.Bloodthirst clouded Gi-Gyu's eyes as he murmured, \u201cIf I were weak like I used to be, I would\u2019ve died here.\u201d Seconds later, a vicious and chaotic aura emerged from Gi-Gyu and flooded the abandoned factory. Akin to countless slithering snakes, it wrapped around his opponents.\u201c...\u201d Choi Won-Jae continued to stand still and study Gi-Gyu. Most guild members present here were C-grade; Choi Won-Jae himself was an A-grade ranker.Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cHad I died here, I would\u2019ve joined the numerous who took their last breath here. I\u2019m guessing countless innocents died here screaming.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you mumbling?! Dammit! Get him already! Kill him!\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s menacing aura was successful in deterring his opponents, so the one behind this whole farce couldn\u2019t help shouting angrily.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Sung-Hoon whispered. The scene before him was simply unbelievable. He had been nervously preparing himself for an inevitable battle, but when he felt Gi-Gyu\u2019s energy, Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t help feeling overwhelming futility.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been that long since we hunted together inside that maze.\u201dIt was only for a day, but Sung-Hoon had seen Gi-Gyu battle the monsters inside the Maze of Heryond. Even then, he deemed Gi-Gyu a strong player. He also knew Gi-Gyu was growing rapidly, but still\u2026Sung-Hoon muttered, \u201cHe has become a beast.\u201d The speed at which Gi-Gyu had grown so far was unimaginable. How could anyone become this strong this fast? It seemed Association President Oh Tae-Gu had made a winning bet.While Sung-Hoon stared in disbelief, Gi-Gyu ordered him, \u201cSung-Hoon, please make sure Yeo Sung-Gu doesn\u2019t escape. And grab your cellphone.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou know who to call, right?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cYup!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you need to do. As for these guys\u2026\u201d With this soft announcement, Gi-Gyu kicked the ground. It almost looked like he suddenly disappeared because he moved so fast. In the blink of an eye, Gi-Gyu stood in front of one of the players charging toward him with a weapon in his hand.Slice.With a ghastly sound, the player\u2019s arm fell to the ground.\u201cAckkk!\u201d When the wounded player screamed in pain, the other guild members shouted, \u201cWhat are you all doing?! Go grab that bastard!\u201d\u201cKill him! There are only two of them! We have the ranker Choi Won-Jae and the others on our side!\u201dAs if waiting for that very statement, all the black-suited players rushed toward Gi-Gyu. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hesitate for a second before mercilessly swinging Lou and El.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of them,\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered just loud enough for Sung-Hoon to hear. The factory was filled with agonizing screams and sounds of clashing weapons, but Sung-Hoon heard Gi-Gyu\u2019s whisper loud and clear.Slash!Stab!Thud!Every time Gi-Gyu swung his swords, he took down\u2014at least\u2014one opponent. Consequently, the factory was flooded by screeches, screams, and metallic clangs.\u201cAckkkk! My arm! My arm!\u201d\u201cMy leg\u2026 My leg\u2026!\u201d\u201cRanker Choi Jae-Won! Please help us! He\u2019s too strong!\u201d\u201cHiukkk! He\u2019s a beast!\u201dWithin seconds, numerous Phoenix Guild members fell to the ground, missing a limb or two. But so far, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t kill anyone: He just made sure they wouldn\u2019t stand up again.And it wasn\u2019t because the guild members were acting like punching bags. They were giving it their all. Sadly, before they could even unleash their ultimate moves, they were stabbed by either Lou or El.Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t tell how much time had passed. To Gi-Gyu, it was only a moment, while it felt like a lifetime to his opponents.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d For the first time since the battle began, Gi-Gyu exhaled deeply. Around him, the severely injured players were screaming and flailing in pain. Had the wounds been normal stab wounds, his enemies could\u2019ve endured the pain and continued fighting. But with Bi activated, the Wound Aggravation skill was in effect. Grasping at their worsening wounds, the players groaned and begged for potions.\u201cWhat a mess,\u201d Choi Won-Jae muttered bitterly as he watched his men\u2019s suffering. The ranker wanted to get involved; unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t at the moment.\u201cW-what the hell is he\u2026? Y-you can kill him, right, Ahjussi? Right?\u201d The director\u2019s pathetic son grabbed Choi Won-Jae\u2019s jacket in fear.The truth of this situation was a complicated one. In the public\u2019s eyes, this idiot was some director\u2019s son. However, this dumbass was actually the secret bastard son of the Phoenix Guild\u2019s guild master. This dunderhead was born from a tryst between the guild master and his mistress, and the guild master treasured him. The guild master had his cretinous, bastard son grow up as the strategic department director\u2019s son to hide his infidelity. This was why all of these players were at this nincompoop's beck and call. It wasn\u2019t the director\u2019s power that brought on this event\u2014It was the guild master of the Phoenix Guild himself.Choi Won-Jae replied calmly, \u201cI\u2019ve got to take care of this myself.\u201dHowever, the guild master\u2019s by-blow, Yeon Nam-Ju, shook his head, begging the ranker not to leave him. Right now, Yeon Nam-Ju and his three friends were hiding behind Choi Won-Jae, so he thought,\u2018After I deal with this, I will have to kill them. Then, I will have to make sure the Young Master finds his way to the right track.\u2019According to the ranker, those three men were why Yeon Nam-Ju was in this situation. The ranker wondered if Yeon Nam-Ju could still change his ways; he needed to try to know. Choi Won-Jae owed a debt he could never repay to the guild master, so he never refused the guild master\u2019s orders, not even those that had him take care of dirty deeds like this.Choi Won-Jae remained calm because he didn\u2019t think he would lose to Gi-Gyu. He was surprised to find Gi-Gyu much stronger than he expected, but all the players Gi-Gyu had defeated so far were mere C-grade players. Choi Won-Jae was not just any player: He was a proud ranker of the Phoenix Guild.Watching Choi Won-Jae getting ready, Gi-Gyu sneered and asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re ready to get serious?\u201d\u201cA-Ahjussi!\u201d Yeon Nam-Ju tried to stop Choi Won-Jae, but the ranker pushed the young man away and walked toward Gi-Gyu.Drip\u2026Drip\u2026Gi-Gyu\u2019s body was soaked in blood. Even as he stood still, blood dripped down from him. Slowly pushing back his blood-soaked hair, Gi-Gyu looked at Choi Won-Jae quietly. Gi-Gyu seemed oddly creepy with a face smeared with other players\u2019 blood.He murmured, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m fighting a ranker.\u201d He had battled Ironshield before, but all he did was clash El with Ironshield\u2019s Calleon once. Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cBut being a ranker does not change that you\u2019re garbage.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d Choi Won-Jae, a damage dealer, announced as he unsheathed his sword.Sung-Hoon shouted to Gi-Gyu with his phone in his hand, \u201cI contacted him! He\u2019ll be here right away!\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu turned around, he saw Yeo Sung-Gu on the floor under Sung-Hoon\u2019s foot. Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cGood job. I guess we don\u2019t have much time left, so we better finish this fast, right?\u201dGi-Gyu smiled at the ranker once more before he dashed forward.Boom!An explosion, too loud for just two swords colliding, was heard soon after.***\u2018This doesn\u2019t feel like my own body.\u2019Something broke inside Gi-Gyu; seconds later, he found himself floating in the air. Although unfamiliar, it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant sensation. He felt dizzy, just like when he drank for the first time, but his body moved more fluidly than ever.Slash.\u2018Too slow.\u2019To Gi-Gyu, Choi Won-Jae\u2019s sword appear to move in slow motion. Dodging the ranker\u2019s sword with ease, Gi-Gyu swung Lou to wound Choi Won-Jae. Thanks to the Wound Aggravation skill, the injury on the ranker slowly turned darker.\u2018He\u2019s moving way too slow.\u2019Suddenly, Choi Won-Jae\u2019s sword glowed, and a robust heatwave wafted from his body. Realizing the ranker had activated his skill, Gi-Gyu quickly stepped back. He had already enabled Accelerate, so his speed would peak in a few moments.Gi-Gyu shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re too slow!\u201dLou escaped Choi Jae-Won\u2019s attack as Gi-Gyu made a turn. After a complete turn with one of his feet as an axis, Gi-Gyu swung El to cut off a few of the ranker\u2019s fingers.\u201cUgh!\u201d Unable to counter the attack, Choi Jae-Won finally groaned in pain. Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t using any active skills, yet as if possessed by a higher being, he moved too fast for Choi Won-Jae to handle.Yeon Nam-Ju trembled and whispered, \u201cT-this can\u2019t be\u2026 This\u2026 I must be dreaming\u2026\u201d The ranker had been with Yeon Nam-Ju all his life. Choi Won-Jae always seemed invincible to him; now, Gi-Gyu was playing him like a fiddle. Yeon Nam-Ju felt like his world was crumbling down around him.Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu just focused on slashing Choi Won-Jae\u2019s flesh and bones. After a few more minutes of fighting, the ranker moaned and crumbled down to the ground. To be more accurate, he fell because Lou had amputated both of his legs. The ranker\u2019s legs flew across the room to join all the other limbs that littered the ground.Trying his best to endure the extreme pain, Choi Won-Jae asked, \u201cW-who are you\u2026? Were you sent here to target the Young Master?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I was just driving home when that jerk tried to pick a fight with me,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied emotionlessly.\u201cJ-just kill me and let the Young Master live. Things will get very bad for you if you kill him,\u201d begged Choi Won-Jae as if stating his last will.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu sighed in frustration, Sung-Hoon rushed toward him and warned, \u201cPlease stop! If you go on any further, then\u2026\u201dSlash.But before Sung-Hoon could reach Gi-Gyu, Lou beheaded Choi Won-Jae. The ranker probably didn\u2019t expect Gi-Gyu to kill him because even as his head took to the sky, his eyes remained wide open.\u201cUgh!\u201d Yeon Nam-Ju felt like he was being suffocated.Sting.Gi-Gyu suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right eye, but he ignored it as he walked forward.\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d Sung-Hoon stared at Choi Won-Jae\u2019s head on the ground in shock before grabbing Gi-Gyu\u2019s arm.\u201cDon\u2019t stop me.\u201d When Gi-Gyu warned him savagely, Sung-Hoon replied quickly, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to stop you. I\u2019m not that crazy. What happened today is beyond repair at this point anyway. But that jerk over there\u2026 I know who he is, and if you kill him, things will become really annoying.\u201dStudying Gi-Gyu\u2019s face worriedly, Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201dGi-Gyu gave Sung-Hoon a small smile before continuing to walk toward Yeon Nam-Ju. With each step he took, the pain in his eyes worsened. It was as if his eyeball wanted to pop out of his skull. And then there was the burning sensation in his chest: It wasn\u2019t getting any better either.Meanwhile, Yeon Nam-Ju begged, \u201cP-please let me live. I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do what I did\u2026 I- I think I got too drunk\u2026\u201d The pathetic man was on his knees and rubbing his hands for forgiveness.Slice.The speed at which Gi-Gyu moved was too fast for a low-level player like Yeon Nam-Ju to follow. Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s right hand fell to the ground with a graceful swing.\u201cAck\u2026 Ugh!!!!!!!!!\u201d Yeon Nam-Ju sobbed due to the kind of pain he had never felt before. With a faint smile, Gi-Gyu reassured him, \u201cI won\u2019t kill you with my own hands.\u201d\u201cY-you mean it?\u201d Feeling hopeful, Yeon Nam-Ju managed to look up at Gi-Gyu, who added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make sure you die on your own.\u201dStab.As Lou dug deep into Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s thigh, an almost cheerful piercing sound echoed inside the factory. Yeon Nam-Ju was the one with a sword in his thigh, but it was actually Gi-Gyu who was enduring a maddening amount of pain. Gi-Gyu\u2019s right eyeball seemed fixated on causing him as much pain as possible. The unpleasant pain was too distracting, so Gi-Gyu closed his eyes.\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon whispered, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hear it: The whisper was buried under the screams from Yeon Nam-Ju and the Phoenix Guild players.***\u201cWh\u2026 What happened?\u201d When Tae-Shik opened the door to the abandoned factory, he couldn\u2019t believe the scene in front of his eyes. He moaned in distress when he saw the bodies littered all over the ground. Thankfully, some bodies were still moaning and screaming for help, so it wasn\u2019t a complete massacre.\u201cGeneral Manager, we have taken care of all the patrolling players outside the factor\u2014\u201d Some surveillance department agents followed inside, but their words stuck to their throats when they saw the scene inside.\u201cUrrggghhh!\u201d Some agents even began to vomit at the gruesome scene. These agents were used to seeing the corpses of monsters and humans since they worked for the association. However, the sight inside the abandoned factory was beyond their worst nightmare.Sung-Hoon walked up to Tae-Shik and greeted him grimly, \u201cThere you are.\u201d\u201cW-what happened here\u2026?\u201d Tae-Shik asked rigidly. Before Sung-Hoon could answer, a trembling voice called out to Tae-Shik, \u201cH-Hyung\u2026?\u201d It was Gi-Gyu who slowly appeared from a dark corner.Gi-Gyu\u2019s face was stained with tears, and he was trembling like a reed in the wind. In a pained voice, Tae-Shik whispered, \u201cGi-Gyu\u2026\u201d\u201cH\u2026Hyung\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu staggered toward Tae-Shik as he stammered, \u201cI\u2026 feel strange.\u201dThe light from the opened factory door slowly shone on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face as he walked forward, and Tae-Shik noticed that Gi-Gyu\u2019s right eye had turned violet. Without a word, the general manager hugged Gi-Gyu comfortingly.\u201cHuh? What? General Manager, one of the corpses here is\u2026!\u201d one of the agents who entered the factory yelled. When Tae-Shik didn\u2019t respond, the same agent continued, \u201cOne of the corpses is disappearing!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d At the impossible news, Tae-Shik finally turned toward the agent. When Tae-Shik released Gi-Gyu for a moment, a system announcement rang inside Gi-Gyu\u2019s head.[Cannibalism has been activated.][Player Choi Won-Jae is being egofied.][Egofication has failed.][Player Choi Won-Jae\u2019s fragment has been absorbed.][You now have access to a part of Player Choi Won-Jae\u2019s memory.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46. Phoenix Guild (4)Gi-Gyu found an alien emotion bubbling inside him; then, a familiar man suddenly appeared in front of his eyes. When Gi-Gyu saw him, he finally realized what that bubbling emotion was.It was absolute loyalty, the kind Gi-Gyu had never felt before.\u2018I have a favor to ask from you.\u2019\u2018I will happily do anything you ask, Guild Master. If I can repay my debt to you, I will be honored to give my life to you.\u2019Gi-Gyu heard a familiar voice that wasn\u2019t his own from his mouth. To his surprise, it was Choi Won-Jae\u2019s voice; slowly, the blurry image of the man in front of his eyes began to clear. The man was none other than the Phoenix Guild\u2019s guild master.\u2018This child is my only blood\u2026 I didn\u2019t get to protect him until now, and I won't get to take care of him myself even now. So I want you to raise my son in my place.\u2019\u2018Of course, Sir. I will protect the young master with my utmost loyalty.\u2019Gi-Gyu, in Choi Won-Jae\u2019s voice, bowed and answered.What was happening? Did Gi-Gyu somehow become Choi Won-Jae? Before he could come up with an answer, the scene in front of him changed. Suddenly, he saw a young boy of six or seven, standing in front of him.\u2018Young Master.\u2019\u2018Who are you, Ahjussi?\u2019\u2018I will serve you from now on.\u2019Again, Gi-Gyu felt some indescribable emotions as Choi Jae-Won announced his intention. The innocent boy looked so pure as he replied, \u2018Please take good care of me!\u2019The guileless young boy smiled and offered him his tiny hand. Gi-Gyu held it happily, but suddenly, his surroundings changed again.\u2018Young Master\u2026 This isn\u2019t right.\u2019Gi-Gyu finally learned the name of the bastard who picked a fight with him as his own mouth begged in Choi Won-Jae\u2019s voice, \u2018Master Nam-Ju\u2026\u2019\u2018Ahjussi, you know my father isn\u2019t interested in me, don\u2019t you? He doesn't care.\u2019There was no doubt Yeon Nam-Ju was the young boy Gi-Gyu saw a moment ago. But there was no trace of innocence on his face, only confusion and resentment. His face filled with misery, Yeon Nam-Ju continued, \u2018Did you think I didn\u2019t know? I know I\u2019m not his legitimate son. Dad always looks at me with love, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s genuine. All Mother feels for me is hate because I am my father\u2019s illegitimate child.\u2019In Choi Won-Jae\u2019s body, Gi-Gyu felt a stinging pain in his heart. He murmured, \u2018Young Master\u2026\u2019How did that innocent boy grow up to be such a tormented young man? Gi-Gyu, no Choi Won-Jae, knew the answer to this. He knew that things went wrong from the very beginning. The guild master was childless, and his wife was very ill. So, he had an affair that led to the birth of his son. Afraid his enemies would target his only child, the guild master put his son in one of his subordinate\u2019s care.\u2018You made a mistake, Guild Master. You should\u2019ve been honest with your son\u2019s identity and faced the problems head-on.\u2019The guild master\u2019s subordinate tried his best to care for the child like his own, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that the boy wasn\u2019t his own. The subordinate\u2019s wife was understandably displeased with the spawn her husband brought, so she was never welcoming toward the child.The tragedy began from day one. Yeon Nam-Ju had rough teenage years, and once he befriended those hooligans, everything went downhill. One day, young Yeon Nam-Ju told Choi Won-Jae, \u2018Please stop caring for me. Just leave me alone.\u2019\u2018Young Master, you must tell me if anything happens. I\u2019m here to serve you.\u2019Before long, Yeon Nam-Ju and his friends received the invitations from the Tower and became players. When Yeon Nam-Ju realized his adoptive father was someone important in a famous guild, he became out of control. And the fact that he was the guild master\u2019s secret son only worsened the situation.At first, Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s goal was simple. His adoptive father only gave him unconditional love and support; sometimes, it seemed fake. He wanted a parent who would applaud him for his achievements and scold him for his mistakes. However, how could his adoptive father reprimand the guild master\u2019s son? Too much love spoiled him and turned him into what got him killed.\u2018Ahjussi\u2026 I k-killed a person. What do I do? I was just driving\u2026 I\u2019m so scared!\u2019One day, Yeon Nam-Ju came running to Choi Won-Jae for help: This was the beginning of a never-ending catastrophe. When Yeon Nam-Ju committed a hit-and-run for the first time, many guild members were mobilized, per the guild master\u2019s order, to cover up the situation. And just like that, Yeon Nam-Ju went unpunished even after killing someone. If he was out of control before, he was like an untamed beast out in the open after the incident.\u2018Ahjussi! Those bastards need to be punished!\u2019\u2018Young Master, this isn\u2019t right.\u2019\u2018Ahjussi! I thought you were on my side. Don\u2019t you care about me anymore?\u2019Then, a woman and several kneeling men appeared before Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes. Their faces remained fuzzy, but he quickly understood what was going on: Yeon Nam-Ju was separating two lovers by force.Yeon Nam-Ju stabbed one of the kneeling men\u2019s chest. The dying man whispered, \u2018I\u2026 curse you\u2026\u2019Yeon Nam-Ju repeatedly stabbed the man\u2019s chest without mercy. When he was finally dead, a bloodstained Yeon Nam-Ju stood up and asked, \u2018Ahjussi! I killed him! You\u2019ll take care of the rest, right?\u2019The kneeling woman could only watch her lover\u2019s death with tear-filled eyes. Choi Won-Jae knew he should\u2019ve stopped Yeon Nam-Ju then. It might not have been too late to set Yeon Nam-Ju right. Choi Won-Jae realized he should\u2019ve done the right thing, even if it took confining and beating him up.Suddenly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s consciousness became faint, and it was separated from Choi Won-Jae\u2019s body. Gi-Gyu wondered in annoyance, \u2018What does it want from me? Should I be sympathetic since Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s childhood was a sad one? I should feel guilty for torturing this young man who had a misunderstood life? Big oof!\u2019Choi Won-Jae\u2019s feelings were no longer interfering with Gi-Gyu\u2019s thoughts, so he could now think more clearly. Gi-Gyu felt frustrated because he couldn\u2019t understand why he was shown the dead ranker\u2019s memories. What angered him the most was how Choi Won-Jaw felt pity and love toward Yeon Nam-Ju. Did having an unhappy childhood give someone the right to become twisted and sadistic?Gi-Gyu thought, \u2018If Yeon Nam-Ju weren\u2019t so incorrigible, I might have felt a little sympathy toward him.\u2019Had Yeon Nam-Ju just been angry at the ones who caused him unhappiness or killed himself out of depression, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve felt pity toward him. But this bastard unleashed his pain and sadness on the innocents. In fact, he bullied those weaker than him and found pleasure in doing so.\u2018Besides, what about me?\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s life was also riddled with unfortunate incidents and pain. Did he lose his humanity and become a sadistic psychopath? Not now, not ever. If misfortune became a legitimate excuse for bad behaviors, what did this mean for people like Gi-Gyu, who overcame their hardships to grow better and stronger? Did this mean Gi-Gyu was an idiot for working hard to get a better life?\u2018I just feel angry becaus\u2014\u2019His last thought was interrupted because Gi-Gyu finally woke up from his dream.***Gi-Gyu opened his eyes. He could feel something warm flowing down his right cheek: His right eye was filled with tears. He swore silently, \u2018Dammit.\u2019Based on the last system announcement, it seemed Gi-Gyu had seen a small part of Choi Won-Jae\u2019s memories. Gi-Gyu felt disgusted for having shed even a single tear. How could he have felt pity for that bastard even for a second?!When Gi-Gyu looked around, he found himself in Tae-Shik\u2019s apartment. Tae-Shik asked, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dTae-Shik was still in his business suit when he offered Gi-Gyu a cup of instant coffee. Gi-Gyu grinned and accepted as he murmured, \u201cI guess your taste in food will never change.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s whole body felt frozen, but the warmth from the instant coffee helped a little. Tae-Shik began, \u201cI heard what happened from Sung-Hoon.\u201dGi-Gyu jolted in shock and asked, \u201cIs Sung-Hoon okay?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be okay? It sounded like he didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Tae-Shik replied with a smirk. Still feeling cold, Gi-Gyu pulled the blanket up to his neck and murmured, \u201cSo what happened afterward?\u201d\u201c...\u201dTae-Shik hadn\u2019t expected Gi-Gyu to be so blunt about it. He mumbled, \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cHow much time has passed since I became unconscious?\u201dGi-Gyu remembered fainting in Tae-Shik\u2019s arms. But he had no recollection of what happened afterward. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cGosh\u2026 I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d\u201cWhy would you be embarrassed?\u201d Tae-Shik grinned teasingly, making Gi-Gyu relax a little. He continued, \u201cIt has been about three hours since you fell asleep. It\u2019s still pretty late at night.\u201dGi-Gyu glanced over to find that it was pitch black outside. He asked, watching the dark sky, \u201cWhat will happen now?\u201dGi-Gyu remembered everything he had done in the abandoned factory earlier. Every time his hands moved, a burst of horrific screams, blood, and flesh chunks flew all around him. After killing a great many players, Gi-Gyu beheaded Choi Won-Jae and tortured Yeon Nam-Ju.Gi-Gyu frowned unhappily at the thought. He couldn\u2019t believe he tortured another human being. Of course, Yeon Nam-Ju deserved to die, but torturing was another matter.Confused by Gi-Gyu\u2019s question, Tae-Shik asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe guy I tortured was the bastard son of Phoenix Guild\u2019s guild master. It\u2019s just like what you would see in a soap opera.\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s face remained calm as if he already knew. He replied, \u201cStuff like this happens all the time. Did you think crazy rich people only exist in soap operas?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure the guild master won\u2019t idly stand by after hearing that his son was murdered. He will try his best to get his revenge.\u201dThe Phoenix Guild wasn\u2019t exactly a world-class group, but it was still a recognized guild in Korea. It didn\u2019t have any high rankers, but it had countless rankers. It was a powerful guild, and Gi-Gyu had just killed its guild master\u2019s only son. Based on what Gi-Gyu had seen, it sounded like the Phoenix Guild didn\u2019t care about the consequences of its actions. Gi-Gyu felt certain the Phoenix Guild master would come after him with everything he had.\u2018Fighting the entire Phoenix Guild will be so annoying.\u2019While Gi-Gyu was mulling over his options, Tae-Shik suddenly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re already on it.\u201d\u2014Tae-Shik gave Gi-Gyu a small smile\u2014\u201cYou have no faith in the association.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dGi-Gyu just hadn\u2019t witnessed the full extent of the association\u2019s power before, so he had no idea what to expect. Tae-Shik explained, \u201cWe, the association, have the responsibility to protect you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You had the right reason to do what you did.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cOn top of that, those bastards used the association\u2019s name to do their dirty work.\u201d When Tae-Shik said in disgust, Gi-Gyu suddenly remembered as he exclaimed, \u201cOh, you mean Yeo Sung-Gu?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We found a few more like Yeo Sung-Gu inside the association. We always try our best to keep things clean, but you can never prevent this kind of corruption from happening inside a large organization.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded in agreement as he listened. Then, Tae-Shik explained that the association had been monitoring and investigating the Phoenix Guild and the other relevant figures for a long time now.Tae-Shik announced, \u201cBut you did do one thing wrong.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve called me the moment something like that happened. If not, you should\u2019ve at least tried to get out of the situation by using your new authority in the association. This whole thing became even more complicated because you didn\u2019t do that.\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t kind, and Gi-Gyu was thankful for it. Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly and replied, \u201cAt first, I was embarrassed to use the association ring. I thought I just needed to cooperate with the investigation for things to work out smoothly. But the situation worsened so fast.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cThen, I thought that since I have the power to protect myself now, I will be okay. But if I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu lowered his eyes\u2014\u201cI think that\u2019s why I wanted to take my anger out on them.\u201dGi-Gyu looked up straight into Tae-Shik\u2019s eyes and added, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like being weak and helpless. So when I saw those jerks, I exacted my revenge on this corrupt and filthy world. I guess I also wanted to feel the power I now have to reassure myself. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t call you.\u201dGi-Gyu had experienced helplessness countless times in his life. Being poor and vulnerable was a life of sorrow and despair. He finally became strong enough to survive in this world, but Gi-Gyu was afraid he would forget why he needed this power in the first place.Tae-Shik nodded in understanding as he replied, \u201cAll right\u2026 I guess I should\u2019ve expected this from you. Anyway, don\u2019t worry about the Phoenix Guild. It can\u2019t attack you.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201cThe association will officially and publicly deal with the Phoenix guild.\u201d With a smile, Tae-Shik added, \u201cIn the name of justice, of course.\u201dWas the association really representing justice? Gi-Gyu wondered for a moment, but the fact was, he didn\u2019t really care.Tae-Shik continued, \u201cIn this day and age, it will be hard to eradicate them, but we will make sure no one thinks to go after you. We just have to eliminate the major figures up top, and it will fix everything.\u201d\u201c...\u201dTae-Shik patted Gi-Gyu\u2019s back encouragingly and said, \u201cI think it will be good for you to see the extent of the association\u2019s power.\u201dWith that, Tae-Shik left the room.***-Today, the association has ordered the Phoenix Guild to disband.-The association criticized the misdeeds the Phoenix Guild has committed until now. Guild Master Kim Min-Su, Department of Strategy\u2019s Director Oh-Jung, and ranker Choi Man-Yong have long been under investigation, says an association member.-The depravities this guild committed are being released quickly.-The Phoenix Guild\u2019s ranker, Choi Won-Jae, was reportedly killed in an accident.-The public is shocked by the disbandment of such a powerful guild. However, the citizens are grateful for the association\u2019s decisive action against the criminals.By the time Gi-Gyu woke from his deep sleep, the situation had already been resolved. Listening to the news on Tae-Shik\u2019s living room TV news, Gi-Gyu finally realized that Oh Tae-Shik wasn\u2019t bragging about the association\u2019s power.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu laughed as he continued to listen.-The association announced that all Phoenix Guild members who are innocent would be free to join other guilds or work as solo players. Of course, it will be interesting to see whether the other guilds will be willing to accept anyone from the Phoenix Guild, which has now become a symbol of corruption.-I suppose the current Korean guild power structure will be demolished.-No, it won\u2019t. It will just fix itself since everyone and everything can be replaced.-What will happen to all the rights Phoenix Guild held until now?-They will be absorbed by the association and be redistributed after.Just as Tae-Shik promised, everything was becoming resolved quickly. Gi-Gyu felt embarrassed for being annoyed at what he would\u2019ve had to deal with.-Of course, there are some contrasting opinions regarding this recent event. Several guilds have come forward to ask a simple question: Is the association abusing its authority? They claim a thorough and independent investigation is needed to confirm the association\u2019s claim regarding the Phoenix Guild\u2019s misdeeds.-The association has already provided clear evidence against the Phoenix Guild. What more do these guilds want?-They are claiming that someone manipulated this evidence.-However, all major and mainstream guilds have shown their faith in the association. They have announced their acceptance of all the association\u2019s decisions.-I see. So the majority agrees with the association.The news continued for days, leaving the entire nation shaken. And it wasn\u2019t a surprising reaction since a mighty guild was destroyed and disbanded in a single day.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI guess Hyung told me the truth about the association being powerful.\u201dTae-Shik claimed that the association was already investigating the Phoenix Guild. Their investigation was nearing its end, and they were deciding on how to deal with this corrupt guild. And just then, Gi-Gyu got involved in the unexpected incident with Yeon Nam-Ju. Gi-Gyu realized that the Phoenix Guild was about to go down no matter what. All he did was move up the inevitable.-Breaking News!Suddenly, every channel on TV began to air the same breaking news.-The Phoenix Guild\u2019s Guild Master Kim Min-Su commits suicide amid the recent investigation.Finally, the saga ended as the last thorn plucked itself out.***Gi-Gyu spent the rest of the day in Tae-Shik\u2019s apartment after informing his family that he would return home late. He made this decision because Tae-Shik was also going to be late, and he had something to discuss with Tae-Shik.Meanwhile, Lou asked,-Are you feeling better now?\u201cYeah. I\u2019m better now. Thanks.Since Gi-Gyu had much to think about, Lou had been giving him some privacy.-Master, please don\u2019t worry too much.\u201cThanks, El.\u201d-Idiot. You should\u2019ve been smarter about things. You said everything was going to be fine.\u201cI thought it was going to be okay.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled and added, \u201cIt felt different from when I stabbed Rogers. Both Rogers and all the players in the abandoned factory deserved to die, but I shouldn't have been so intentionally cruel. I should\u2019ve killed them quickly, not causing them more pain than necessary.\u201dLou remained quiet for a moment before replying,-Just be straight with me. You\u2019ll feel better if you are honest about your feelings right now. El and I share your feelings because of the assimilation. That means we can understand your emotions. So just be open about them.Gi-Gyu hugged his knees and became silent. Slowly, his face turned sad as he whispered, \u201cWhen I was killing people, I\u2026\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu hesitated\u2014\u201cI felt great. I liked it.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t deny how much he enjoyed killing another human being. Gi-Gyu wondered if this meant he was no longer human anymore.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47. Phoenix Guild (5)Three days had passed since the abandoned factory incident. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t go hunting during this time; instead, he returned home and stayed there because he needed much time to think about what had happened. And today, he had a meeting with Tae-Shik.Tae-Shik commented when he saw Gi-Gyu, \u201cYou look pretty good.\u201d\u201cWell, since I don\u2019t have to worry about money anymore, I can\u2019t help but look relaxed,\u201d Gi-Gyu joked.They were meeting at a cafe near the Bukhan River. It was a quiet and well-decorated place with a fantastic view. Most importantly, it was usually empty on the weekdays, so it was safe to talk freely here.\u201cWow\u2026 \u00a0I heard the Phoenix Guild is no more,\u201d commented Gi-Gyu.\u201cI told you I would show you the association\u2019s true power,\u201d bragged Tae-Shik as he continued to pour some syrup into his Iced Americano. When it became more syrup than coffee, Gi-Gyu shivered and asked, \u201cUgh\u2026 Isn\u2019t that too sweet?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d It was quite evident now why Tae-Shik preferred cheap instant coffee over fancy Americano.\u201cBy the way, did Kim Min-Su really commit suicide?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, Tae-Shik grinned as he looked straight into Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes. He replied, \u201cWhy do you ask? Are you wondering if the association killed him?\u201d\u201cThat thought did cross my mind.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded because it was the truth. Before Tae-Shik answered him, Gi-Gyu added, \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t matter to me even if you killed him.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk. The association isn\u2019t as clean and ethical as I would like it to be, but it\u2019s not\u00a0that\u00a0corrupted. After all, both the old man and I like to keep things clean.\u201d When Tae-Shik replied with a shrug, Gi-Gyu teased him, \u201cIs that the silver spoon in your mouth speaking? Oh, wait, it would be a diamond spoon in your case.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dTae-Shik took a sip of his drink and determined its sweetness had finally hit the sweet spot. With a pleased smile, he continued, \u201cKim Min-Su definitely killed himself. After seeing a part of Choi Won-Jae\u2019s memory, you said that Kim Min-Su couldn\u2019t raise Yeon Nam-Ju himself because of his enemies and his ill wife, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWell, his wife died not too long ago. Kim Min-Su looked everywhere for the longest time to find the elixir for her, but he was never a strong enough player to get his hands on it,\u201d Tae-Shik explained. Gi-Gyu scratched his head awkwardly at the mention of the elixir as Tae-Shik continued, \u201cAnd his enemies\u2026 It makes sense that he had many since Kim Min-Su wasn\u2019t exactly a model player. Yeon Nam-Ju didn\u2019t turn out all twisted and evil just from his unhappy childhood. An apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree after all. Anyway, by the time the association got to him, Kim Min-Su had lost pretty much everything. His life was over, so I supposed death was his only way out. Even the strongest player is still a human.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d agreed Gi-Gyu. The Phoenix Guild was almost completely disbanded by now. A few innocent players quit the guild and joined another, while the rest involved in Kim Min-Su\u2019s dirty works were taken care of one way or the other. Gi-Gyu killed many in the abandoned factory, and as for the rest, including the corrupt association agents like Yeo Sung-Gu\u2026\u201cWe decided to send everyone involved in the Phoenix Guild\u2019s dirty work away.\u201d When Tae-Shik shrugged, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cYou\u2019re referring to Gehenna, right?\u201dTae-Shik nodded. Gehenna was a secret place where criminal players were sent. The place was hidden deep somewhere, maintained and supervised only by the association. Rumor had it that not even the strongest player could escape this place. All criminals there were sent for life, so it was basically a death sentence. Many chose to commit suicide rather than be sent to Gehenna. It was nicknamed \u201cThe Hell,\u201d as no one could ever escape from there.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cIs Gehenna really a gate like the rumors suggest?\u201dMany wondered how a place could confine even high rankers since no human-made structures could imprison them. So, if Gehenna wasn\u2019t in the Tower, it could only be a gate.Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cI heard it\u2019s a gigantic sustained gate that the association just uses to imprison criminals.\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d Tae-Shik shrugged and replied, \u201cI have no idea since I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Then you should try going inside someday, Hyung.\u201d When Gi-Gyu teased, Tae-Shik yelled with mock anger, \u201cWhat? You jerk!\u201dBoth Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik chuckled at the thought. Yeo Sung-Gu and everyone involved in the recent incident would all be sent to Gehenna, leaving Gi-Gyu with nothing to worry about.After a long, peaceful pause, Tae-Shik asked quietly, \u201cHave you had some time to organize your thoughts?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied confidently.\u201cCan you tell me about it?\u201d Tae-Shik was asking Gi-Gyu what conclusion he came up with.Gi-Gyu silently turned toward the Bukhan river. It looked so calm and beautiful without a single ripple in the water.\u201cWhen I first became a player, I knew I might end up killing a person someday. But for a while, I didn\u2019t have to worry about it since I couldn\u2019t even level up.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled playfully before continuing, \u201cAnd when I was being tortured by the Iron Guild, I swore to kill every one of them. I did almost kill Rogers.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWhen I killed him, I didn\u2019t feel anything. In fact, when I heard he was alive, I felt relieved. It didn\u2019t feel right because it was\u2026 an easy kill.\u201dTae-Shik nodded because he could understand how Gi-Gyu felt.Gi-Gyu added, \u201cI still haven\u2019t changed my mind about killing every member of the Iron Guild. I also can\u2019t back out from the deal I made with Lucifer. But\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu\u2019s face turned dark\u2014\u201cit was different in that abandoned factory. It\u2019s not that I feel guilty about what I did. Those bastards deserved to die, and it sounded like they had killed dozens before me. It makes sense since the Phoenix Guild became stronger because of their dirty dealings and corruption. Had I been just a helpless victim that day, Yeon Nam-Ju would\u2019ve continued to kill innocent people. So, I don\u2019t feel a shred of guilt because I did what I had to do.\u201dSlurp.Tae-Shik continued to suck through the straw loudly while listening. Gi-Gyu turned toward Tae-Shik and murmured, \u201cBut\u2026 when I was torturing them and amputating their limbs, I didn\u2019t feel discomfort, guilt, or even that I was doing the right thing.\u201dAfter a short pause, Gi-Gyu added, \u201cI just felt pleasure.\u201dThis was what confused Gi-Gyu the most. When Gi-Gyu seemed troubled, Tae-Shik calmly commented, \u201cThere are plenty of other players who enjoy killing people. And it\u2019s not just players because many non-players enjoy it too. You can meet many like that if you go to prison.\u201dIn a soft voice, he continued, \u201cYou may disagree with me, but this is what I think: It\u2019s\u2026 okay for someone to enjoy killing another person. What matters the most is if they can control their impulses.\u201d\u201cI knew you would say that,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. He had known Tae-Shik for many years now, so he knew how Tae-Shik\u2019s mind worked.Gi-Gyu agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I think too. What\u2019s important is if I can control myself or not.\u201dStanding up, he added, \u201cOr more specifically, if I\u00a0need\u00a0to control it or not.\u201dSlowly, the concern that filled Gi-Gyu\u2019s face disappeared.***\u201cMy right eye turned violet, right? It must have something to do with the gift Lucifer gave me, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked his Egos.Inside the abandoned factory, Gi-Gyu\u2019s right eye turned violet as well. And then there was Lucifer with violet eyes. The connection seemed obvious.-Probably.-I\u2019m sure it\u2019s from that woman, Master.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I wonder if it happened because of my emotional state at the time.\u201d Gi-Gyu thought out loud. He was still organizing his thoughts, and he was curious about what happened that day. Could it be that Lucifer\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d weakened his will? Was that why he lost control and tortured those players?-It\u2019s possible.\u201cThen I better go meet Lucifer.\u201dNow Gi-Gyu had one more reason to rush the meeting with Lucifer. He murmured, \u201cI had to meet her someday anyway. I guess it\u2019ll be sooner than later.\u201dGi-Gyu swung Lou, which was followed by a monster splitting in half. It had been a while since he last hunted; his body felt lighter than before.\u201cDo you think the power she gave helped me trounce Choi Won-Jae?-Maybe.\u201cHey, you need to put more effort into answering my questions.\u201dGi-Gyu knew that no one except Lucifer could give him the answer, but he still couldn\u2019t help but let his thoughts wander. Choi Won-Jae was a ranker, so Gi-Gyu shouldn't have been able to defeat him even if he was much stronger now. Apart from that, there was also something concrete that convinced Gi-Gyu he got help from Lucifer: He couldn\u2019t recreate the power and speed he enjoyed that day no matter how hard he tried.-You have to understand that I also don\u2019t know much at this point. Once you meet that wench, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find all the answers you want.Gi-Gyu picked up the crystal from the ground and insisted, \u201cThen tell me stuff that even Lucifer can\u2019t.\u201d-Haa\u2026 I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this to me.\u201cIt\u2019s because, as you know, your master went through something huge recently.\u201dGi-Gyu walked on, trying to find the next monster to slay. He murmured, \u201cEgofying a gatekeeper, egofying a devil, and egofying a human.\u201dSlash!Gi-Gyu slew another monster before it could even notice his presence. He continued to mumble, \u201cWhat\u2019s an Ego? And how am I supposed to use the egofied Chang-Gyung and the fragment?\u201dAnnoyed by Gi-Gyu\u2019s endless questions, Lou begged,-Can\u2019t you just focus on hunting?\u201cBut these are all important questions.\u201d-Haa\u2026Gi-Gyu carelessly picked up another crystal from the ground and muttered, \u201cAnd why can\u2019t an average monster be egofied?\u201dHe had killed tens of thousands of monsters until now, but unlike the gatekeeper, Perez, and Choi Won-Jae, the Cannibalism skill didn\u2019t work on them.-Hmm\u2026 I might have an idea about that.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gi-Gyu paused and asked. This was the first time Lou was offering something useful.-You believe you got Cannibalism after killing Talon, right?\u201cYes.\u201dGi-Gyu received his first notification regarding this skill after he killed Talon. Similarly, he got the Strong Will skill after killing Chang-Gyung. Gi-Gyu believed Lou absorbed the Cannibalism skill from Talon.-I believe I\u2019ve always had the Cannibalism skill. Or maybe it\u2019s something I developed from having you as my master.\u201c...\u201dGi-Gyu began to walk again as Lou continued,-As for egofication\u2026Lou trailed off before continuing,-All I know is that an Ego is a powerful entity with consciousness. Both El and I know that we\u2019re Egos, but we can\u2019t explain what we are. So I can\u2019t tell you what egofication means.Slash!Another monster fell to the ground helplessly.-So just keep climbing the Tower. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll eventually find the answers if you climb high enough. All the answers are inside the Tower.***In Gi-Gyu\u2019s case, time fixed the majority of his problems. Once the Phoenix Guild was disbanded, the other guilds that protested the association\u2019s decision and the public\u2019s excitement and concerns all died down. Even Gi-Gyu\u2019s own worries lessened over time. Humans were oblivious creatures, and this wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Gi-Gyu.Sung-Hoon waved as he greeted Gi-Gyu, \u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in concern. Sung-Hoon looked so gaunt that he resembled a corpse. Gi-Gyu added, \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d\u201cAnd who do you think is responsible for that? How could you say that to me when it\u2019s all your fault?!\u201d Sung-Hoon glared at Gi-Gyu. Sung-Hoon was in the abandoned factory with Gi-Gyu, so he witnessed every single gruesome detail, but he still treated Gi-Gyu the same as ever. He didn\u2019t look at Gi-Gyu strangely or show any fear. Gi-Gyu suspected that either Sung-Hoon was more strong-minded than he looked or had seen even worse things in his past.Gi-Gyu apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cGosh! I mean, the culprit is right here! That man standing in front of me is the one who did all the work in that factory! So why was I questioned and investigated?!\u201d Sung-Hoon cried out loudly.After what happened in the abandoned factory, the association finally had everything they needed to take down the Phoenix Guild. The association had to thoroughly investigate what happened to go ahead with their plan. Under normal circumstances, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve been the one under the microscope. However, Gi-Gyu avoided that because he was under the association president\u2019s protection. This left Sung-Hoon stuck with all the work.Sung-Hoon complained, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I had to repeat myself. Haa\u2026 I\u2019m so glad you kept the dash cam memory card safe. The association also sent players with psychometric skills, so things went relatively smoothly.\u201dSung-Hoon looked up at Gi-Gyu and grumbled, \u201cI thought I would die from having to talk so much.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 Sung-Hoon, your bank account number is still the same, right? So I can just send the bonus there, right?\u201d\u201cYes, and I will always be at your service, Sir!\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu laughed, Sung-Hoon grinned and added jokingly, \u201cFrom now on, please just use your association ring first. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can think about breaking necks. It will be so much easier that way. Or maybe we should\u2019ve let them follow us to the Tower and hunt them down there! That way, there would\u2019ve been no investigation.\u201d\u201cI understand. I just thought I would see what happe\u2014\u201d\u201cSo you did this on purpose!\u201d When Sung-Hoon began to scream indignantly, Gi-Gyu quickly covered his mouth and changed the subject.\u201cSo you said the association president is looking for me?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Yes.\u201d Sung-Hoon replied with a sigh. He came to see Gi-Gyu because he was asked to bring Gi-Gyu to President Oh Tae-Shik.Gi-Gyu asked with a grin, \u201cCouldn\u2019t he have just called me?\u201d\u201cWell, you went through a lot recently, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. So I think the president wants to make sure you\u2019re okay and talk to you in person.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful for his concern, but I have to admit that it\u2019s annoying. Now, I have to go all the way to the association building.\u201d Gi-Gyu was just thankful that the president wouldn\u2019t make him explain everything again. Gi-Gyu also didn\u2019t expect Oh Tae-Gu to be the \u201cconsoling\u201d type. All his previous conversations with the man had been straightforward and emotionless. And that was exactly how Gi-Gyu liked it.Sung-Hoon announced, \u201cWell, we better go now.\u201dThen, he led the way, and Gi-Gyu followed him without a word.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48. Request\u201cYou look great,\u201d Tae-Gu said the moment Gi-Gyu walked in.\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou look like you just dropped a heavy load.\u201dAt first, Gi-Gyu was sure the president was talking about shit, but no one did that with that serious a face, especially not the association president. And Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t about to discuss shit with the president of the entire Korean branch, so he just dropped the issue.\u201cTsk, just have a seat,\u201d Oh Tae-Gu ordered when Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond. Sung-Hoon was waiting outside the room, so Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t wait for him and obeyed quietly. He had only been in this office once before, but he felt comfortable in the president\u2019s office for some reason.\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d asked the president.\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t refuse the offer, Oh Tae-Gu returned with two teacups. After pouring hot water into a teapot, Tae-Gu began the conversation.\u201cTsk, every time I see you, you look different. I must say, it\u2019s quite amusing.\u201d\u201cDo I look that different?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.Tae-Gu quietly closed his eyes before replying, \u201cBefore today, you looked like something was burdening you. You must\u2019ve had repressed emotions rotting inside you. So, your psyche must\u2019ve been haywire even though you did look okay from the outside.\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond; he just continued to listen quietly as the president asked, \u201cBut now that you\u2019ve expelled all that rotten energy, it makes sense that you look much different now. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dTae-Gu opened his eyes and looked at Gi-Gyu. Although Gi-Gyu found it hard to understand the president\u2019s vague comment, he could make a good guess. Oh Tae-Gu was most likely talking about the destructive energy Gi-Gyu released in the abandoned factory.The president continued, \u201cAnyway, you took care of something pretty big, Young Man. I had no idea things became so corrupt while I was away.\u201d\u201cYou were away, Sir?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked in surprise, Tae-Gu picked up his teacup and replied, \u201cI have held this title for a long time, but others were actually running this organization until recently. I had to take care of something, so it hasn\u2019t been long since I returned.\u201dNow that Gi-Gyu thought about it, he did find it odd that he had never heard of Tae-Gu before. Gi-Gyu had known Tae-Shik for over five years, but Tae-Shik only recently started complaining about his \u201cold man.\u201d Perhaps the president\u2019s prolonged absence allowed him to remain mysterious to the public.\u201cSome major changes are coming to the association. I will reorganize this whole place to get rid of corruption. Then, we\u2019ll get to start with a clean slate,\u201d Tae-Gu announced, his eyes glowing eerily.Gi-Gyu nodded and asked, \u201cDid you find Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s body yet?\u201dTae-Gu seemed embarrassed because he averted his gaze. Yesterday, Tae-Shik called and told Gi-Gyu that the association had lost Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s corpse.Yeon Nam-Ju died at Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands. At first, Gi-Gyu planned on only hurting the jerk, but he lost control. When he returned to normal, Yeon Nam-Ju was already dead.And now, Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s body had gone missing. Oh Tae-Gu murmured, \u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201dNo one knew who or why someone stole Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s corpse. Since Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s body was part of the evidence, it was in the association\u2019s possession when it went missing. And the fact that it disappeared into thin air seemed to embarrass Tae-Gu.The president replied, \u201cI will let you know as soon as we find it. I would like to apologize to you for what happened.\u201d\u201cNo, there is no need.\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head. It was true that Yeon Nam-Ju\u2019s missing body bothered him greatly. He couldn\u2019t figure out why anyone would want the corpse. He wondered if it would come back and bite him on the ass.\u2018I need to be careful for now, but not forever.\u2019Gi-Gyu still felt anxious about the possible repercussions, but he felt confident about one thing: He would soon be strong enough to fear nothing.-You\u2019re being too cocky, aren\u2019t you?\u2018Shut up, Lou. I\u2019m in the middle of a conversation.\u2019-You have the worst personality.Lou tried to pick a fight, but Gi-Gyu ignored him and focused on his conversation with the president. The conversation was still filled with greetings and mundane chitchat. Frustrated because they were getting nowhere, Gi-Gyu bluntly said to the president, \u201cWe should get down to business, Sir.\u201d\u201cIndeed, I called you here to make my first request.\u201d After hearing the central point of their conversation, Gi-Gyu nodded with a solemn face.The president continued, \u201cAs I said before, you have the right to deny my request. I would appreciate it if you just think of it as a suggestion or a favor.\u201d\u201cOf course, Sir. To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t take on any jobs I feel uncomfortable with.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled and added, \u201cBut if it\u2019s something that wouldn\u2019t feel burdensome and might even help me, I will accept it. I would, of course, expect a generous reward.\u201d\u201cHehehe, I understand.\u201d Tae-Gu chuckled.Then, Tae-Gu\u2019s face turned solemn, a look that befitted his position, and he continued, \u201cThis won\u2019t be an overly hard task for you. I think you might actually like it.\u201dWith a grin, he added, \u201cI would like you to close a gate.\u201d***Around the time Gi-Gyu passed the 5th-floor test, the Angela Guild announced its intention to conquer the 75th floor. It was also when an S-class gate appeared in the US. After this event, many exceptional gates appeared worldwide, followed by anomalies in the Tower.Currently, Sung-Hoon was driving Gi-Gyu to the gate Tae-Gu mentioned. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an exceptional gate before. Do you know anything about it?\u201dGi-Gyu called shotgun for this ride because, as he explained to Sung-Hoon earlier, he didn\u2019t want to drive for a while in light of what happened recently. Sung-Hoon was very understanding, and he was happy to drive Gi-Gyu around in his new car.Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cOnly a few of them have appeared so far, so I don\u2019t know much about them. I just know that they are a little different from the regular gates, and there is a high chance that an exceptional gate can be unusually difficult to close.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu looked out the window quietly. Tae-Gu\u2019s request was to close a new exceptional gate that appeared in Yeosu city. This gate was C-grade, but its actual difficulty level could be much higher since it was an exceptional gate.\u2018An exceptional gate\u2026\u2019The player channel on TV talked about it from time to time, and all Gi-Gyu knew about it was that it was literally \u201cexceptional.\u201d That didn\u2019t simply mean a higher difficulty level. It implied that something unexpected could happen inside. For example, the boss monster could appear immediately after a player entered. There was a case where the gate prevented the players from leaving until it was closed. Gi-Gyu had even heard of exceptional gates that only allowed entry to players who met some specific criteria.Although clearing exceptional gates seemed difficult, it didn\u2019t necessarily require unique strategies. However, Gi-Gyu had to admit that exceptional gates were, in general, more difficult than normal gates.Gi-Gyu commented, \u201cI had been really curious about what kind of requests the president would make. I\u2019m a little surprised that it\u2019s such a normal task.\u201d\u201cWell, what did you think he would ask?\u201d asked Sung-Hoon.\u201cI don't know. Something more special, I guess. But don\u2019t you know what the other association mercs do? Can't you tell me?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, Sung-Hoon looked at him in confusion.\u201cGi-Gyu, who do you think I am? What am I to you?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 a search engine?\u201d replied Gi-Gyu with a chuckle. Shocked, Sung-Hoon gaped before explaining, \u201cI\u2019m just one of the many lowly association employees. I may know a bit more than others, but there isn\u2019t that much of a difference between what you know and what I know.\u201d\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Gi-Gyu snorted and argued, \u201cI can tell that you have many secrets, Sung-Hoon. You say you aren\u2019t anyone important, but you seem to be pretty close to Tae-Shik hyung and the president. And until now, you have told me more secrets than the two of them combined.\u201dSung-Hoon scratched his cheek awkwardly as he mumbled, \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t tell me, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me when the time is right,\u201d Gi-Gyu offered and looked out the window again.\u201cI\u2019m their disciple,\u201d replied Sung-Hoon in a calm voice.\u201cA disciple?\u201d\u201cYes. Just think of me as the president\u2019s and the general manager\u2019s disciple for now. If you want more details, you should ask them.\u201dGi-Gyu waited for more, but it seemed that this was the most Sung-Hoon was willing to disclose. Soon, they exited the busy highway and entered Yeosu. The exceptional gate, currently under the on-site association agents' supervision, was not too far away.***When they arrived at the location, an employee from the Department of Gate Maintenance asked Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon, \u201cThe association sent you?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied, but it seemed that the employee was suspicious of them. He requested, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you show me your association employee card or a player certificate? Rumors regarding this gate are spreading fast, so we have had cases where some reporters and stupid players tried to enter by lying about their credentials.\u201dIt seemed this claim was true because the association employee looked genuinely concerned. Gi-Gyu scratched his head and murmured, \u201cWell\u2026\u201dWanting some help, Gi-Gyu looked at Sung-Hoon, who only smiled at him quietly. Gi-Gyu knew why his companion was silently refusing to help. He was a little annoyed, but there was nothing he could do about it. However embarrassing it might be, it was finally time to use his newly given authority.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cWho is the manager here\u2026?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d The association employee seemed confused at Gi-Gyu\u2019s request. He asked, \u201cWhy are you looking for the manager? Did I make a mistake here? You should know that if you request to see the manager without a legitimate reason, you may suffer a penalty from the association.\u201dThe employee\u2019s face turned red from anger. He believed Gi-Gyu was being disrespectful to him. He continued in annoyance, \u201cA manager is pretty far up the hierarchy. So you cannot meet him unless you have a good reason. Please tell me why you wish to see him.\u201dGi-Gyu had to agree that the employee was being reasonable. He was following the standard protocol, after all. Gi-Gyu stammered, \u201cUmm\u2026 Please don\u2019t misunderstand. I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201dGi-Gyu hesitated before continuing with a sigh, \u201cThe manager will vouch for my identity.\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his embarrassment because it felt like he was bragging about how important he was. And Sung-Hoon was enjoying every second of it, chuckling away in some corner.The employee sighed and replied, \u201cHaa\u2026 All right. I\u2019ll let the manager know and see what he says. Please don\u2019t be surprised if he refuses to see you.\u201d\u201cOh, of course.\u201d\u201cWho should I tell him is looking for him?\u201dGi-Gyu looked awkward again as he pressed on his temple a few times.\u201cMo\u2026\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu whispered, the employee leaned forward and asked, \u201cPardon? I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Morningstar.\u201d***The manager ran out hurriedly and yelled, \u201cAre you, Mr. Morningstar?!\u201dThe employee who went to get him turned pale; perhaps the fact that he had never seen his manager look this panicked had something to do with it.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cAh, well\u2026\u201dWhen he hesitated, Sung-Hoon answered for him, \u201cYes, that\u2019s him.\u201dSung-Hoon must\u2019ve thought he had teased Gi-Gyu enough. He stepped forward and greeted the manager, \u201cAnd I\u2019m Heo Sung-Hoon, Morningstar\u2019s secretary. Nice to meet you.\u201dSung-Hoon and the manager chatted for a while. The manager turned back toward Gi-Gyu with a nod and requested, \u201cNow, could you show it to me?\u201d\u201cHere it is,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu as he raised his hand. On his fingers, three beautiful rings shone brightly. The manager looked at the aegis, which represented the association, a few times before taking out a dark ring from his pocket. When this ring drew near Gi-Gyu\u2019s fingers, the association aegis began to glow faintly.With a deep bow, the manager announced, \u201cI have now confirmed its authenticity. It\u2019s an honor to have you here, Mr. Morningstar.\u201dGi-Gyu had never been treated with such respect before. When Gi-Gyu looked around awkwardly, Sung-Hoon stepped up.\u201cI think there are too many people watching us out here. Shall we go inside now?\u201d Sung-Hoon suggested. Realizing his mistake, the manager jolted and hurriedly escorted Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon to his makeshift office.The gate was being monitored and protected by association employees. Many temporary tents were set around the gate for the employees to rest and sleep. The three men entered a large tent closest to the gate.Then, Sung-Hoon made a serious request. \u201cPlease make sure your employees keep quiet about this. The president has been in quite a bad mood lately.\u201dThe manager nodded quickly and replied, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I am, and I will follow the protocol to a tee.\u201d He thumped his chest as if to reassure both Sung-Hoon and Gi-Gyu. The manager then turned toward Gi-Gyu and added shyly, \u201cWe are trying to follow the manual as best as possible, Mr. Morningstar. However, this is our first time serving an association merc, so please understand if we make some mistakes.\u201dThe manager suddenly called Gi-Gyu\u2019s code name when he realized Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t looking at him. \u201cMr. Morningstar?\u201d\u201c...\u201dWithout a word, Gi-Gyu opened the tent door and walked toward the gate, dazed. The manager seemed confused, but he followed Gi-Gyu quietly.When Gi-Gyu walked up to the gate, the manager warned, \u201cYou are too close! It could be dangero\u2014\u201dBut it was too late. Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand touched the blue light that was the gate.[Would you like to sync?]The system announcement rang in his head; suddenly, the gate began turning red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49. Request (2)The association employees surrounding the gate shrieked when they saw the eerie red color staining the blue gate.\u201cW-what\u2019s happening?!\u201d one employee yelled.\u201cIt\u2019s a break! This is a gate break!!!\u201d another screamed in fear.\u201cWe need to escape right now! It\u2019s going to blow!\u201d warned one of the agents.\u201cBut why is it happening now?! Didn\u2019t we calculate three weeks for the break?!\u201d shouted someone while leaving their tent.\u201cMaybe because it\u2019s an exceptional gate?\u201d answered someone nearby.Everyone around the gate shouted in fear as they scrambled. But Gi-Gyu remained calm and didn\u2019t remove his palm from the gate. Heo Sung-Hoon ran toward Gi-Gyu and warned, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu! It\u2019s dangerous!\u201dA gate only changed color when it was about to break and explode, unleashing its monsters into the outside world. When Sung-Hoon finally reached the gate, he bodily lifted Gi-Gyu and screamed, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201dThe association manager responsible for this gate also yelled in shock, \u201cMr. Morningstar!\u201dThe moment Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand lost contact with the gate, its color suddenly returned to its normal blue. The menacing crimson vanished in the blink of an eye, leaving behind the oddly soothing blue gate.Confused and surprised, the manager stared at Gi-Gyu and murmured, \u201cWhat just happened?!\u201d Deducing that the change had something to do with Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t hard. But neither the manager nor Sung-Hoon could talk to Gi-Gyu when they saw his face. Gi-Gyu looked rigid, just as confused as them.\u201cDammit!\u201d \u00a0Gi-Gyu spat out in frustration.***Soon after the incident, the association sent additional agents to the Yeosu Gate. Something like this had never happened before. Based on the color changes, it seemed the gate went from being stable to breaking and then back to being stable. This unusual event was bound to attract the entire world's attention. And since people feared the unknown, the public would definitely panic. So, the association moved quickly to prevent the spread of information to the public. Within the hour, the association surrounded the Yeosu Gate.Gi-Gyu shook his head and muttered, \u201cWhat a mess\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, it was Gi-Gyu himself who created this mess. Sung-Hoon teased in a sarcastic tone, \u201cI\u2019m so impressed! I guess you can now even control gate breaks, Player Kim Gi-Gyu?!\u201d\u201cI told you it\u2019s not like that,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with a sigh. Sung-Hoon considered teasing him further but decided against it because Gi-Gyu seemed pretty upset. After a short pause, Sung-Hoon asked in a more serious tone, \u201cSo what happened?\u201dGi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon were currently staying inside a new tent set up for them a moment ago. A magical barrier was placed around this tent, which meant it was completely soundproof. In addition, no one could enter the tent without Gi-Gyu\u2019s permission.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed, frustrated at this complicated situation. Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t know about the existence of Egos yet. He thought that Gi-Gyu just happened to have some unique and powerful weapons. Gi-Gyu contemplated telling him about the Egos, but he felt too lazy to make such an effort. On top of that, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t think Sung-Hoon needed to know about them just yet.Finally, Gi-Gyu decided to give a vague explanation. He replied, \u201cYou know that I have a unique ability, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI think it has something to do with the exceptional gates.\u201dSung-Hoon nodded and murmured, \u201cI suppose it makes sense since unique abilities are so mysterious.\u201d It seemed that Sung-Hoon accepted Gi-Gyu\u2019s explanation.A unique ability was literally a one-of-a-kind ability. No two players could have the same unique ability; they could have two different unique abilities. Consequently, no one knew the true extent of each unique ability.Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201dAfter a short silence, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI think I need some time to think.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go make a report of the current situation to the association,\u201d Sung-Hoon announced and left the tent.Finally, alone in the tent, Gi-Gyu asked Lou and El, \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201dGi-Gyu only approached the gate because he felt familiar energy flowing from it. When he got close enough, his instincts told him what he was standing before.\u201cThat gate\u2026\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu.It was an Ego.-But didn\u2019t you suspect this already?-That\u2019s right, Master.\u201cIt was just a theory.\u201dAfter Gi-Gyu killed Chang-Gyung, Cannibalism was activated for the first time to egofy the monster. Because of it, the gate wouldn\u2019t close, forcing Gi-Gyu to kill every monster inside the gate. In the end, he obtained a piece of Ego from where Chang-Gyung had died. According to Lou, it was an Ego\u2019s corpse or a fragment.Since he got the fragment when the gate was about to close, Gi-Gyu wondered if gates were actually a type of Egos.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dAs it turned out, he was right: Gates were indeed Egos.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply, remembering the system asking if he wanted to sync with the Yeosu Gate.-What are you going to do now?\u201cI don\u2019t know. When I was about to sync with it, the gate color changed, so\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with a shiver. A gate changed color only when it was about to break. In other words, had he synced with the gate, all of its monsters would\u2019ve entered this world.-But it\u2019s an Ego you can sync with! You can\u2019t just leave it like that.\u201cI know.\u201d-Why don\u2019t you try to sync with it first?\u201cBut it would break\u2014\u201d-Just use the association\u2019s power to secure the city and then try syncing with it.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply immediately to Lou\u2019s suggestion. Instead, his mind began to calculate the feasibility of Lou\u2019s idea. \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d\u2018This exceptional gate could really be an Ego, so I can\u2019t just waste it.\u2019Everything so far indicated that this gate was an Ego. On top of that, it was an Ego that was ready and willing to sync with him. The risk involved was significant, but Gi-Gyu believed the reward would be worthwhile. After making his decision, Gi-Gyu stood up.The sun had set by now, and the full moon was high up in the sky, shining brightly.***\u201cAccording to the scouts, the monsters inside this gate belong to the undead category. They believe the monsters\u2019 grades are no higher than C,\u201d explained the manager of the Yeosu Gate. Gi-Gyu, Sung-Hoon, and the manager were discussing the gate inside Gi-Gyu\u2019s makeshift tent.Before making any final decision, learning as much about the gate as possible was necessary. They finalized the basic report from the scout team while Gi-Gyu listened to the manager\u2019s analysis.Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cWhy is this gate considered an exceptional type?\u201d To be considered exceptional, there had to be something very different about the Yeosu Gate.\u201cAll players inside the gate suffer continuous damages,\u201d the manager replied.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWe believe it\u2019s because of the toxins from the undead\u2019s rotting bodies. If you have a poison immunity item, then\u2014\u201dGi-Gyu interrupted him and replied, \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dLou possessed a certain level of poison immunity. He got the skill after absorbing the blood of the Maze of Heryond monsters.Clearly impressed by Gi-Gyu\u2019s confidence, the manager exclaimed, \u201cUwaahh\u2026. No wonder you\u2019re an association merc!\u201d\u201cUmm, you\u2019re embarrassing me. Please don't,\u201d Gi-Gyu begged, making Sung-Hoon chuckle, \u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cOh, of course, Mr. Morningstar.\u201d The manager replied solemnly.Trying to change the subject, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat type of internal structure does this gate have?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a standard field shape. The interior resembles a graveyard, and other than the fact that you will suffer continuous damages, there isn\u2019t anything else to note,\u201d explained the manager.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.The three men discussed the gate for a while before deciding that its difficulty couldn\u2019t be much different from their expectations. The only other notable thing was\u2026\u2018The gate is an Ego.\u2019What it meant in terms of difficulty, monsters types, or even structure was a mystery. So, Gi-Gyu had no idea what he might face inside the gate. When Gi-Gyu remained quiet, Sung-Hoon asked quietly, \u201cYou think it\u2019ll be too dangerous?\u201dThe manager and Sung-Hoon weren\u2019t aware that this gate was an Ego, yet they could sense something wasn\u2019t right. If the gate broke, all the monsters inside would have a field day on the streets. Also, no player had ever returned from a broken gate: They simply \u201cdisappeared\u201d inside the gate. And once they disappeared, no one could even find a single trace of those players.The Yeosu Gate had already exhibited signs of breaking once, so if it broke while Gi-Gyu was inside\u2026Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat was the original break schedule for this gate?\u201d\u201cWe expected a little over three weeks,\u201d replied the manager.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Gi-Gyu knew why the gate turned red earlier, so he was confident the gate wouldn\u2019t break while he was inside. He announced, \u201cThen I\u2019ll enter the gate first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cHow many agents do you think will be needed?\u201d the manager asked. It was possible to ask for reinforcements from the association if necessary. And since the Yeosu Gate had already tried to break once, it definitely qualified for that. Gi-Gyu was the highest-ranking association member here, so he had the authority to make the call.Gi-Gyu commanded, \u201cPlease call as many reinforcements as possible. We must move as if the gate might break at any time. And\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu swallowed audibly\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll be entering the gate alone. Sung-Hoon, you must stay outside.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Sung-Hoon\u2019s face was full of surprise. He asked, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to leave me out of this?\u201d\u201cYes, this is going to be very dangerous. It might also have something to do with my ability, so I have no idea what could happen inside.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 If you insist, I guess I have no choice.\u201d Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t look happy, but Gi-Gyu smiled and replied, \u201cYou need to keep yourself safe, Sung-Hoon.\u201dGi-Gyu then turned toward the manager and ordered, \u201cYou saw how the gate was about to break earlier, right? That\u2019s why I think it would be best for me to do this quickly. I\u2019ll enter the gate tomorrow morning, so please call the association for backup.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d the manager nodded and replied with a rigid face.Turning back toward Sung-Hoon, Gi-Gyu added, \u201cAs for you, please call Tae-Shik hyung and let him know what\u2019s going on here.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201dNow, Gi-Gyu felt confident that he had done everything he could to keep the city safe. Only one thing was left on the To-Do list: Enter the gate and face whatever was inside.***The manager offered to get Gi-Gyu a hotel room nearby so that he could sleep comfortably overnight, but Gi-Gyu decided to stay in the tent. Knowing the gate was an Ego, he couldn\u2019t be sure if something might happen during the night, so he wanted to be nearby just in case. Besides, Gi-Gyu had slept in much smaller tents, so this clean and spacious association tent felt like a luxurious hotel to him.However, the same wasn\u2019t true for Sung-Hoon. Lying inside a sleeping bag, Sung-Hoon kept massaging his back as if he was in pain. He grumbled, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you accept the offer to stay in the hotel? And why the hell is this so uncomfortable?!\u201d\u201cI told you that you could stay there if you wanted. Yet you insisted on sleeping here with me, Sung-Hoon!\u201d When Gi-Gyu retorted, Sung-Hoon groaned and muttered, \u201cArgh\u2026 Anyway, it\u2019s time to get up. Let\u2019s get packing and get out of here.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded. They had already packed before going to bed last night, so there wasn\u2019t much they had to do. Gi-Gyu\u2019s bag included only the basics: Sleep gear, food, and some disposable items. It was all for one person, so there wasn\u2019t much.After getting ready, Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon went out to find the manager.The manager asked, \u201cAre you ready to go inside?\u201d\u201cYes, I think I really have to close it as quickly as possible for everyone\u2019s safety,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.\u201cAhh\u2026 An association merc indeed. Mr. Mornin\u2014\u201d When the manager was about to exclaim again in awe, Gi-Gyu interrupted him quickly, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d\u2018Just what is the association feeding their managers? Why is he that awed by a single merc?\u2019Gi-Gyu felt awkward because the manager treated him like a hero. He also was surprised by how utterly clueless he was about association mercs before. If they were such heroic and revered figures, how come they weren\u2019t well known?The manager replied shyly, \u201cAll right, khoff\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease make sure you have firm control over this area,\u201d Gi-Gyu asked the manager.\u201cOf course. The reinforcements will arrive shortly. My men have already determined and secured the breakage perimeter, so please don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThank you. And please remember, the gate might break the moment I get close to it, okay?\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dWith a nod, Gi-Gyu laggard toward the gate. The association employees were already ordered to stay far away at a safe distance, so only Gi-Gyu could be seen approaching the blue light. With each step he took toward the gate, the gate turned a brighter shade of red.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d When Sung-Hoon groaned, the manager asked worriedly, \u201cAre you sure this will be okay?\u201d Both Sung-Hoon and the manager watched with concern from afar. On the other hand, Gi-Gyu looked very peaceful as he continued to walk.Total silence fell in the area. Everyone watching the scene knew that the gate could break at any time, so the tension in the air was palpable.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed quietly. He was walking toward the unknown, so he wasn\u2019t completely free of fear either.Finally, he reached the gate and raised his hand to touch the now-red light.[Would you like to sync?]Without hesitation, Gi-Gyu answered, \u201cYes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50. Request (3)Whir.The gate began to vibrate. Everyone in the area tensed as they stared at Gi-Gyu and the gate. The gate could break at any moment now, but suddenly, it stopped vibrating. And then\u2026The gate swallowed Gi-Gyu whole.\u201cW-what the?!\u201d Both the manager and Sung-Hoon gasped in shock. They clearly saw that Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t enter the gate on his own two feet. Instead, the gate swallowed him as if it was a living creature. Slowly but surely, the gate changed back to its original color as if nothing had happened.***Gi-Gyu was just as shocked after being devoured by the gate. He muttered, \u201cI knew syncing with it wouldn\u2019t be easy, but this\u2026\u201dTo sync with Lou, all Gi-Gyu had to do was name him in that weird dimension. So, he wished for this gate to be as easy as Lou; sadly, his wish was left unanswered.\u201cWell, I prepared for the worst-case scenario, so I should be fine,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he looked around. A dark, dry land and a dead forest were all that met his eyes.[You will now be tested to see if you\u2019re qualified.]\u201cHuh?\u201dWhile Gi-Gyu was looking around to plan his next move, a system announcement rang in his ears.-Hmm\u2026Lou murmured when he heard the announcement.-I can\u2019t be entirely certain, but I think it wants to test you to see if you are worthy of syncing with this Ego.\u201cWhat kind of test is it talking about?\u201d-How would I know? But based on what I see here, I think you can just go ahead with your original plan.\u201cYou mean I should close the gate?\u201d-Exactly. I think this gate might be a little too hard for you, but\u2026Lou sounded concerned, which was very unlike him. But Gi-Gyu could understand why his Ego felt this way. The gate\u2019s continuous damage effect was already at work since Gi-Gyu could feel something prickling his exposed skin.[You will now experience continuous damage.]The toxin from the undead was constantly attacking Gi-Gyu; the extent of the injury was quite unexpected. Based on the scout teams\u2019 info, the toxin shouldn\u2019t have affected Gi-Gyu much due to his internal immunity. However, the stinging sensation was real, and it led to only one conclusion:\u201cThe gate\u2019s difficulty level has gone up.\u201d-That would be my guess too.\u201cWell, I guess I don\u2019t have time to waste then.\u201dSlowly, Gi-Gyu took his first step. He had already noticed that the gate entrance closed when he agreed to sync with it.\u201cI have nothing else to do but to pass the test.\u201dGi-Gyu was ready to battle his faceless challenger.***Gi-Gyu took out a potion bottle from his bag and drank it. This potion increases a player\u2019s internal toxin immunity and was among the supplies provided by the association.[Your internal poison immunity will increase temporarily.]\u201cIt tastes terrible.\u201dIt tasted worse than a Chinese herbal medication, making Gi-Gyu frown. Afterward, he continued toward the area that gave off an incredible aura. His sharpened senses helped him immensely in finding the correct location. Also, since the gate was a simple field shape without any crossroads, Gi-Gyu could walk straight on, trusting his instinct.-There is a monster coming up.\u201cI know that.\u201d-Master, please be careful.\u201cThanks, El.\u201dAfter a short conversation, Lou and El quickly transformed into their sword form. The two beautiful rings were now two powerful swords ready for a fight. From not too far away, a skeleton soldier was running toward them. Only white bones made up its body, and the monster was holding a rotten shield and a tarnished sword.\u201cHup.\u201d Gi-Gyu kicked the ground to sprint toward it. At an incredible speed, he swung Lou toward the skeleton soldier.Clack.Shockingly, the skeleton soldier\u2019s heavily worn shield blocked Lou effectively. Gi-Gyu yelped in surprise, \u201cHow could a skeleton be this fast?!\u201d He quickly distanced himself as he groaned, \u201cUgh\u2026\u201dOf all the skeleton monsters he had faced in the Tower and the gates before, this skeletal monster was\u2014no doubt\u2014the fastest. Usually, skeleton soldiers were slow and awkward because they lacked muscles. But inside this gate, they were surprisingly quick and strong.However, it still didn\u2019t change that they were nothing more than a bag of bones.Thud.Rattle.Protecting himself from the skeleton with Lou, Gi-Gyu swung El to break the monster\u2019s skull. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cAccording to the scout\u2019s report, all the monsters here should be no higher than low C-grade. But this one was definitely a high C-grade. It looks like the difficulty level of this gate has really increased.\u201dGi-Gyu contemplated before continuing, \u201cDoes this mean that this gate can control its monsters\u2019 grades?\u201dIf that were the case, it would be a huge problem.-No way. I\u2019m sure that skeleton just fought its hardest.\u201cIf I can sync with this gate, maybe my reward would be much more than expected!\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled in anticipation.***In terms of interior, this gate didn\u2019t have much to brag about since it was just dead land all around.Rattle, rattle\u2026Currently, Gi-Gyu was fighting for his life because, seemingly, every skeleton inside the gate was hunting him. Countless monsters ran toward him, and Gi-Gyu fought expertly. If Sung-Hoon were seeing this battle, he would\u2019ve asked Gi-Gyu, \u2018Are you the best swordsman or what?!\u2019Gi-Gyu alone deftly fought hundreds of skeleton soldiers: It was a majestic scene. The monsters attacked him one after another, and he dodged them elegantly as he swung his swords.The skeletons failed to even give him a papercut, while Gi-Gyu destroyed them with ease.Rattle, rattle\u2026The broken bones of the soldiers covered the ground all around him.\u201cHup.\u201d Gi-Gyu leisurely controlled his breathing as he continued to kill the skeletons. He wasn\u2019t even using Accelerate, but these monsters were still no match for him.-Behind you.\u201cGot it.\u201d-Watch the ground.\u201cI know!\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s heightened senses eliminated all of his blind spots, but Lou still alerted him from time to time. Initially, there were countless skeleton soldiers around him; now, they had been turned into crystals.Clank!With a single slash, he shattered the last skeleton\u2019s skull and sword.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed. After facing so many monsters at once, he felt a little empty inside. Still controlling his breathing, he decided to take a little break.[You will experience continuous damage.]\u201cTsk.\u201d The skeleton soldiers failed to injure him, but the toxin was slowly accumulating in his body. Gi-Gyu had drunk several bottles of the antidote, the internal immunity potion, and the healing potion, so they were also losing their efficacy.\u201cLet\u2019s just pick up the crystals now.\u201d After examining his body, Gi-Gyu began to move methodically. Around him were hundreds of the crystals the now-truly-dead undead dropped.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d His precious stone reaping speed was excellent, but their sheer amount was slowing him down. The poison was continuously injuring him, so taking his time to pick up the crystals seemed like a waste.In the end, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cAccelerate.\u201dHe didn\u2019t use this skill during the battle, yet he ended up using it to pick up the crystals.***\u201cGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!\u201d A monster screamed creepily. It was a headless knight known as a durahan.\u201cGuess this is the mid-boss,\u201d Gi-Gyu stated when he saw it. He was standing on a tree that eerily had only branches and no leaves. He chose this tree because he needed to look at his surroundings from high up.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d He stood unstably on one of the branches as he spotted a graveyard entrance. In front of it was the durahan holding its own head in its hand.\u201cAnd the graveyard must lead to the boss\u2019 room.\u201d Gi-Gyu continued to look around to gather as much information as possible. It had been three days since he entered the Yeosu Gate. He didn\u2019t move at his full speed; instead, he had been taking his time killing as many monsters as possible. Considering this, Gi-Gyu thought he arrived at the boss\u2019 room much quicker than he expected.\u201cThat durahan looks pretty strong.\u201d Gi-Gyu could feel the shocking aura emanating from the monster\u2019s body even from this far away. The durahan was giving off a deadly vibe, overwhelming Gi-Gyu.-It feels pretty strong.\u2018Yeah, hmm\u2026\u2019-But it shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem for us.\u2018I know that, but I\u2019m worried about the boss monster I\u2019ll have to face afterward.\u2019-The boss?When Lou asked, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cConsidering this is supposed to be a test to sync with the gate, the monsters I killed so far were way too weak. I\u2019m sure the mid-boss, the durahan, is also much stronger now, but I still think I can easily defeat it.\u201d-You think the gate focused most of its power on the boss?Gi-Gyu nodded.-Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re worrying unnecessarily? If this gate really is an Ego, its power must be limited.When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t answer, Lou continued,-I don\u2019t understand the grading system you humans use to measure power. But if the gate really made the monsters stronger, I think it would\u2019ve had to use all of its power to do this. It means that the boss monster couldn\u2019t be that much stronger than our expectations.\u201cAll right.\u201dGi-Gyu answered and jumped down from the tree. Without even taking a breath, he began to run toward the durahan: Aiming for a Blitz attack. Gi-Gyu drank the internal immunity potion and the agility potion as he sprinted. As the potions took effect, he could feel the durahan\u2019s deadly aura waning a bit. The last bottle he drank was the healing potion.Slam!As Gi-Gyu reached the gate, he swung his sword at the headless knight that protected the graveyard. When the durahan\u2019s giant halberd, Lou, and El clashed, a loud explosion rang throughout the gate.***\u201cWow, dammit\u2026 It was pretty strong,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he walked on while pouring the healing potion on his wounds.Step, step\u2026Slowly but steadily, he headed toward the center of the sinister graveyard. Several torchlights were hanging on the wall, but they held icy blue flames instead of red-hot fire. Watching the glowing lights, Gi-Gyu kept walking. The path to the graveyard\u2019s heart was downhill. It was dark and wet in the most unpleasant way, but Gi-Gyu was thankful that there weren\u2019t any rodents around.Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks.\"A crypt?\u201dHe spotted a white crypt in front of a wall. He saw that he was now inside a closed but spacious area when he looked around. Gi-Gyu grinned and announced, \u201cHere I am.\u201dThis had to be the boss\u2019 room. Gi-Gyu stretched and walked up to the crypt, feeling the tingling sensation all around him.-Hmm.-Master.The Egos must\u2019ve felt the unusual power from the crypt because they warned Gi-Gyu. But he touched the crypt anyway and replied confidently, \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dClunk, clunk\u2026As soon as Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand touched the crypt, it began to shake from side to side. Not knowing what was about to come, Gi-Gyu took a step back to create some distance from it.Pause.The crypt stopped shaking, and when its cover opened, a blue smoke began to drift out.[Are you the one who wishes to become my master?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51. Gate Ego\u201cWas that a system announcement?\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered in shock when he realized that the blue smoke was speaking through the system. Still having difficulty understanding what was happening, Gi-Gyu stood in silence. After a long pause, the androgynous system voice asked him again.[I will ask you again.]-I will ask you again.Slowly, its blue smoke began to find its shape.\u201cIt\u2019s a lich?\u201dThe boss monster, like its minions, was nothing but a bag of bones enshrouded by a black robe. Gi-Gyu quickly realized that it was a lich, one of the strongest monsters in the undead category. It was common knowledge that a lich only appeared in high-level gates and the floors above the 60th.The lich was so strong that Gi-Gyu had to use every ounce of his strength just to resist its aura.\u2018This is crazy!!!\u2019There was no way this lich was a C-grade boss monster. A hopeful assumption would put it in B-grade; the best assumption would put it alongside A-grade gate monsters.\u201cLou, you idiot!\u201d Gi-Gyu continued to stare at the lich as he angrily murmured.-S-sorry\u2026Lou told Gi-Gyu earlier that he didn\u2019t expect a strong boss monster, but it was clear his Ego had been dead wrong. It was rare for Lou to apologize, so it was apparent they were in as precarious a position as possible.[I\u2019ll ask you for the last time.]-I\u2019ll ask you for the last time.Gi-Gyu was now certain of his first hypothesis: The lich was talking with him through the system.[Are you the one who wishes to become my master?]-Are you the one who wishes to become my master?\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Gi-Gyu answered emphatically. There was no point in acting cowardly at the moment. The best thing he could do was fight with everything he had.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Eerie blue smoke escaped the lich\u2019s mouth as it murmured. What Gi-Gyu could hear in his head now wasn\u2019t the system's voice or the monster. It was more like a\u00a0vocalization.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t sure if vocalization was the word he was looking for, but this was the best description he could come up with.The blue lich moved like a ghost as it studied Gi-Gyu.\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d the lich murmured, and the sound echoed throughout the dark, gloomy room.\u201cAre you the gate?\u201d Gi-Gyu glared at the lich and asked sharply. Thankfully, the overwhelming dark aura wrapped around him was slowly receding, so he was regaining control over his body.\u2018I think I might have a chance against it.\u2019Due to his long period of growth, Gi-Gyu felt he could defeat this boss monster.\u201cThe gate\u2026?\u201d When the lich seemed confused, Gi-Gyu clarified, \u201cI want to be this gate\u2019s master. You just asked me if I want to become your master. Get it? So I will ask you again. Are you the gate?\u201d\u201cGate\u2026\u201d the lich murmured before becoming still. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m the master that rules this place of exile. Therefore, you must prove yourself worthy of being my master\u2026\u201dWhen the lich opened his hands, a dark-colored staff materialized in them. Before the lich could even firmly grab the staff, Gi-Gyu ran toward it with Lou and El in his hands.***Kaboom!An unbelievably loud explosion took place. A black orb had exploded right in front of Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, thrusting him away.Thud.Gi-Gyu slammed against the nearby wall and fell to the ground.\u201cKhoff!\u201dThat single attack had given him a severe internal injury, as he coughed up a handful of blood.\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d The explosion was so outlandish that Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help swearing out loud.Whoosh!When the lich waved its staff, dozens of black arrows appeared in front of the monster. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t even get the time to take care of his internal injury before he had to dodge another attack.Booooom!!!!!!!!!!!All those dark, ominous arrows accurately struck the exact spot Gi-Gyu was standing on just moments ago.\u2018I would\u2019ve died.\u2019Gi-Gyu felt certain that he would've died instantly had even a single arrow struck him.\u201cAccelerate!\u201d he shouted to activate his skill. Now wasn\u2019t the time to be stingy about using everything he had. The best strategy for him was to finish this battle as quickly as possible.Gi-Gyu\u2019s movements became steadily fast; unfortunately, the lich simply increased the number of arrows it created to counter his speed. In addition, they were now following Gi-Gyu like homing missiles.Kaboom!Gi-Gyu jumped, kicked a wall, and then used the resultant thrust to narrowly dodge the lich\u2019s attack. Moments later, numerous black arrows struck the wall he used to gain forward thrust. Since the arrows were homing in on him, he had to lodge them into the structures around him.When Gi-Gyu turned toward the lich, he saw that the monster hadn\u2019t made any more black arrows yet. Taking this as his chance, he began to rush toward it.Clack!Gi-Gyu swung Lou, which the lich blocked with its staff. He muttered, \u201cSorry, but that wasn\u2019t my main attack. This is!\u201d He used the force from Lou and the staff\u2019s clash to flip and land on his feet. And the second his feet touched the ground, Gi-Gyu plunged El into the monster.\u201cKwaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!\u201d the lich screamed in pain.[El successfully caused additional damage to the evil creature.]\u201cI knew you were the key, El!\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered as he escaped the black orb that appeared out of nowhere.-This evil monster is no match for me, Master.When El announced proudly, Gi-Gyu complimented her, \u201cI believe in you, El.\u201d-Tsk.Lou was annoyed by their conversation because he was clicking his tongue like a baby.Surprised, the lich said, \u201cI see that you\u2019re holding something very annoying\u2026 You who wish to become my master\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you should stop fighting me and just sync with me!\u201d Gi-Gyu shouted again as he kicked the ground. His current speed was at the Accelerate skill\u2019s ceiling, so he was faster than ever. Gi-Gyu was storming toward the lich; in response, the lich opened his arms. Its thin bones, hidden under the black robe before, were now fully exposed.The mixture of black and white colors looked oddly beautiful as thousands of dark arrows appeared before the monster.\u201cHuh!\u201d \u00a0Gi-Gyu was moving at full speed, so he couldn\u2019t change his direction sharply. He was in midair, and because he wasn\u2019t a tanker, he didn\u2019t have the skill to form a shield. So, as things stood, Gi-Gyu was running straight into a volley of arrows.At this rate, the arrows would turn him into mincemeat. In that short moment, dozens of thoughts crossed Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind before he formed a cross by holding El and Lou together. The best thing he could do now was protect his vital spots.\u201cHehehe\u2026 Die\u2026 You\u2026 human\u2026\u201d the lich announced creepily.\u201cDammit!\u201d Gi-Gyu swore as his sword cross faced the volley of dark arrows.[El is banishing the evil creature\u2019s aura.][Lou is absorbing this banished aura.]\u201cHuhhh?\u201d The moment those arrows touched the cross, they fell like a bunch of twigs.[Lou shall now awaken as the Emperor of Black Magic.]\u201cWhat?\u201d[Please offer a sacrifice for Lou to successfully become the Emperor of Black Magic.]Then, Lou began to exude an evil aura. The lich murmured in shock, \u201cH-how\u2026 c-could a human have\u2026\u201dThe lich was faceless, but Gi-Gyu could still tell how confused and shocked the monster was. After landing safely on the ground, Gi-Gyu also wondered about the system announcement. Then, Lou\u2019s arrogant voice suddenly rang in his head.-Did you see that?!***With the new announcements from the system, the situation reversed quickly.\u201cP-please don\u2019t kill me\u2026\u201d the lich begged. Gi-Gyu followed the boss monster around the small crypt as it ran in circles to escape him.-Hahaha! Did you see that? Did you?!-You\u2019re acting up, Lou.-Idiot! This is my true identity!Lou refused to stop chattering as the evil aura continued to waft from him. Gi-Gyu used Accelerate again to catch up to the lich. When he caught it, he plunged Lou into its bony body.Pshhh\u2026\u201cP-please let me live\u2026\u201d the lich begged again, shaking visibly. Gi-Gyu wondered if it was because Cannibalism was working in the background to absorb it.[Lou is absorbing the sacrifice.][Lou\u2019s stats are increasing.]-Hahaha!Lou laughed as if he had lost his mind. Gi-Gyu watched his sword with pity and murmured, \u201cYou\u2019ve been so depressed lately, haven\u2019t you, Lou?\u201d-You have no idea how furious I was when I watched that stupid Empress of Holy Swords becoming stronger than me!\u201cHuh?\u201d Suddenly, Gi-Gyu realized something strange. He muttered, \u201cLou, you\u2019re being unusually rude and callous right now. What\u2019s with you?\u201d-Umm\u2026It seemed that Lou finally came to his senses. For a while, he didn\u2019t speak another word. El explained,-Lou\u2019s just confused, Master.\u201cConfused about what?\u201d-He is\u2026Lou interrupted El quickly.-Shut up! Let\u2019s just kill the lich already. My head is pounding now.\u201cAll right,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied, not wanting to question Lou any further. Lou slowly absorbed the lich as the system announced.[Lou will awaken as the Emperor of Black Magic after absorbing its sacrifice.][The completion of this process will take several days.]\u201cLou?\u201d Gi-Gyu called Lou\u2019s name, but his Ego didn\u2019t reply. Meanwhile, now nothing more than a wisp of smoke, the lich begged, \u201cI will accept you as my master, so please\u2026\u201dAfter Lou had absorbed most of the monster, the lich was now just sentient smoke. The lich probably thought that Gi-Gyu was urging Lou to absorb the rest of it, so it was panicking.Gi-Gyu was concerned about Lou, but he also had to take care of the lich. He turned toward the monster and asked, \u201cThen how do I sync with you? I guess I need to name you.\u201d[The gate consents to sync with you.][Please name the gate.]Before the lich could answer Gi-Gyu, the system made an announcement. With a grin, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cBrunheart.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I like\u2026 it\u2026\u201d When the lich replied, Gi-Gyu smiled, tinged with bitterness. It was a small gesture, but he hoped it would be enough to honor his old armor.[You have successfully synced with Brunheart.]Then, the world suddenly darkened around him.***Oh Tae-Shik shouted, \u201cEveryone, get ready!\u201dIn front of him, the Yeosu Gate was vibrating while glowing blood-red as if it would burst. Currently, hundreds of players were surrounding the gate, ready to defend the city with their lives if necessary.Gulp.Someone gulped audibly, a small noise at best, but it still seemed deafening to the players. Everyone was agitated and using their senses to the fullest. The number of times a gate broke in Korea could be counted on one hand, so most here had never witnessed such a devastating event.\u201cAny guilds nearby?\u201d Tae-Shik asked Sung-Hoon.\u201cThe Child Guild happened to be near us, so they\u2019re on their way.\u201d\u201cIt will be too late by then! Dammit,\u201d Tae-Shik muttered angrily. He asked, looking around with obvious anxiety, \u201cHow about the Yeosu citizens? Have they been evacuated yet?\u201dSung-Hoon replied, \u201cYes, they have, but the reporters\u2014\u201d\u201cThey obviously want to die, so just let them stay. Our priority should be our agents\u2019 lives, not the reporters. We have already asked those pests to evacuate numerous times! Do you understand? We\u2019re not obligated to endanger ourselves to protect them.\u201d When Tae-Shik ordered in frustration, Sung-Hoon nodded and answered, \u201cYes, Sir!\u201dTurning toward his agents, Oh Tae-Shik announced, \u201cListen carefully!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d\u201cWe are about to face a gate break, which hasn\u2019t happened in a very long time! It\u2019s a C-grade exceptional gate, but we have enough players to fight it and protect the city! Any objections?!\u201d\u201cNo, Sir!\u201d the association agents answered aggressively.\u201cYou will kill anything and everything that leaves this gate! Do you understand?\u201d Tae-Shik asked.\u201cYes, Sir!\u201dThe players\u2019 anticipation was palpable in the air. Tae-Shik maintained a confident facade, but his heart was overflowing with worry.\u201cGi-Gyu\u2026\u201d When Tae-Shik whispered worriedly, Sung-Hoon reassured him, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll make it, so please don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe moment Gi-Gyu entered the gate, it became red as if it was about to explode. It had been a few days since the gate swallowed him. But a few hours ago, the gate began to vibrate alarmingly, so numerous association agents were called in.Tae-Shik had been waiting outside the gate for days now, so he had more time to prepare for the possible break. Suddenly, the red gate began rotating while making ominous clangors.Wee woo, wee woo, wee woo\u2026\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik muttered in surrender. He had to accept that Gi-Gyu failed to close it.The break seemed inevitable now.\u201cThe gate is breaking!\u201d Sung-Hoon shouted.\u201cGet ready!\u201d Tae-Shik ordered in a loud but calm voice.\u201cMake sure you all survive!\u201d the Yeosu Gate\u2019s manager yelled encouragingly. Suddenly, the gate stopped vibrating, and the association agents tensed.And then\u2026Flashhh!A bright light exploded from the gate, releasing incredible energy.The term gate break was used to describe the phenomenon where a gate exploded and released its monsters into the world. It was considered a disastrous event, and it was also one of the many reasons humans stopped fighting each other.\u00a0[1]\u201cGi-Gyu\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik murmured in desperation.\u201cDid you say my name?\u201dTo Tae-Shik\u2019s shock, Gi-Gyu answered his call.1. Humanity\u00a0now had a common enemy, a formidable one at that, so human wars have vanished after the appearance of the Tower and the gates.\u00a0\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52. Gate Ego (2)Oh Tae-Shik was left speechless when he heard Gi-Gyu\u2019s voice. Meanwhile, the bright light that had blinded everyone was slowly dissipating. Tae-Shik soon came out of his stupor and asked, \u201cGi-Gyu\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes! Why did you call my name?\u201dGi-Gyu, walking out from the gate, looked around in confusion. Countless armed players were staring at him in awe. He could feel the tension in the air, so his confusion grew.Click!Suddenly, the crisp sound of a camera shutter going off rang in everyone\u2019s ears. More flashes and camera shutters quickly followed it.Click! Click! Click!The flashes and clicks were akin to a chemical reaction, showing no signs of stopping. Realizing what was happening, Tae-Shik shouted, \u201cControl those reporters! Hurry up! Follow the standard protocol!\u201dSung-Hoon ran toward Gi-Gyu; since he knew Sung-Hoon had no intention of harming him, he just waited there. Sung-Hoon yelled, \u201cPlease put this on! Hurry up!\u201dSung-Hoon was handing Gi-Gyu a mask. Unfortunately, it was an ugly black one with a wide, creepy smile. Despite the confusing situation, Gi-Gyu found the time to joke. \u201cSung-Hoon, your taste in fashion is rather\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease hurry!\u201d When Sung-Hoon insisted, Gi-Gyu finally wore the mask. Meanwhile, the other association agents were bustling around them. A few minutes ago, their task was to protect innocent citizens from the vile monsters. But now, they were running around confiscating cameras and controlling the rampant reporters, all to protect Gi-Gyu\u2019s identity from being released to the public.Meanwhile, the reporters shouted, \u201cTake as many photos as you can!\u201d\u201cThis is the biggest scoop of our lives! Take! Photos!\u201dThe reporters screamed and moved with incredible speed. Since everyone thought the gate was about to break, most reporters here were players.But the association agents were just as fast, if not faster. The two groups clashed with each other valiantly. Yeosu was preparing for a gate break, which could be hellish; now, it was facing a different kind of hell.\u201cWe need to get outta here.\u201d Tae-Shik approached Gi-Gyu and announced.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion.\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be asking that! But we don\u2019t have time for chitchat right now. We need to leave immediately!\u201d Tae-Shik shouted and pulled Gi-Gyu along. The gate manager and Sung-Hoon walked beside Gi-Gyu to block him from the reporters\u2019 view.To Tae-Shik and Sung-Hoon\u2019s relief, they managed to escape the pandemonium much more easily than anticipated.***\u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop the reporters completely, Sir,\u201d the gate manager apologized with his head bowed low. They were currently inside Tae-Shik\u2019s office in the association building, discussing the recent event.Tae-Shik replied, \u201cI understand. No one expected that, and we hadn\u2019t had anything like that in quite a while. No use crying over spilled milk; don\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201dThe gate manager turned toward Gi-Gyu and apologized again, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Mr. Morningstar.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu awkwardly. Distraught by his failure to maintain control over the gate site, the manager left quietly.When the manager was out of sight, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI\u2019m still so confused and shocked.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I feel too,\u201d Tae-Shik replied as he shook his head. Just thinking about the dangerous situation earlier made him tense again. Tae-Shik finally asked, \u201cSo what happened? I swear that gate was about to break.\u201dEverything pointed out that the exceptional C-grade gate was about to explode. Tae-Shik could've fought off all the monsters, but that was only true if he was doing it inside the gate. Once the monsters were out in the world, they tended to become overly excited. There was no way to stop them from attacking the civilians hidden all over the city. Even if the association gathered every strong player to protect the city, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to save everyone.Tae-Shik, feeling emotional, turned away as he murmured, \u201cI thought you\u2026 died. And since the gate was about to break, you would\u2019ve definitely disappeared even if you hadn\u2019t died.\u201d\u201cAh, Hyung\u2026 Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d Gi-Gyu felt too shy and embarrassed to console Tae-Shik.\u201cYou bastard! How could you put yourself in danger again?! Don\u2019t you care about your mother and Yoo-Jung?!\u201d\u201cB-but!\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn't help but feel wronged. True, entering the gate was dangerous, but he didn\u2019t feel like he was in a truly fatal situation. When Gi-Gyu seemed ready to blurt out an excuse, Tae-Shik sighed and continued, \u201cHaa\u2026 Never mind. A merc is supposed to work in the shadows, i.e., their identity has to remain a secret. But because of the potential break this time, we failed to keep you safe from the reporters.\u201dIn the case of a possible gate break, the entire city needed to be informed and warned to prepare for it effectively. That was why much of the information regarding the Yeosu Gate was released to the public.Tae-Shik added, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why so many reporters gathered at that spot. We\u2019re in such a mess\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201dTae-Shik seemed genuinely concerned about what had happened. He muttered, \u201cIn the past, we could control the reporters by force or money. But now, so many of them are ex-players that it has gotten much trickier. It\u2019s even worse because those reporters think the association is their enemy for some reason. If they suspect the association did anything wrong or is hiding something, they will go berserk and make exaggerated reports.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about player paparazzi?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, Tae-Shik replied with a nod, \u201cYeah.\u201dPlayer paparazzi were ex-players turned reporters who covered players and the Tower-related news. Because non-players weren\u2019t strong or fast enough, this was a new job created after the Tower and the gates\u2019 appearance. These player paparazzi mostly belonged to the assassin or thief category, which meant their specialty was agility and stealth.Instead of risking their lives fighting the monsters, these players chose to hunt for other players\u2019 secrets to make a living. They made great money finding player-related scoops.Tae-Shik murmured, \u201cThis might become a little annoying.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like the association released my information to the public on purpose. So I\u2019ll be fine, Hyung,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied reassuringly. It was out of everyone\u2019s hands, so worrying about it too much was unnecessary. Gi-Gyu knew the association would do its best to stop his identity from being revealed to the public, so he didn\u2019t want to blame or pressure Tae-Shik.Suddenly, the door burst open, and Tae-Gu greeted them, \u201cThere you are.\u201dAmbling, he asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cHave you finished talking with my son?\u201d\u201cOld man! I told you to call before coming to my office!\u201d When Tae-Shik threw a childish tantrum, Tae-Gu raised his cane and smacked his son\u2019s head.Thud!For quite some time now, Gi-Gyu had been wondering why Oh Tae-Gu even carried a cane since he could walk perfectly fine on his own. But now, he could make a pretty accurate guess. Ignoring his grumbling son, Tae-Gu turned toward Gi-Gyu and asked with a bright smile, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t finished your conversation, may I join you to listen?\u201dGi-Gyu looked at the old man awkwardly before replying with respect, \u201cCould I discuss it with Tae-Shik hyung in private first, Sir?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 All right. I will respect your decision.\u201d When Tae-Gu muttered in disappointment, Tae-Shik shouted arrogantly, \u201cSee?! Get out, Old Man!\u201dSmack!Tae-Gu hit Tae-Shik\u2019s head again before leaving the office with a dejected look. The president\u2019s sudden appearance made Gi-Gyu think about a topic he had been putting off for a while now. He asked Tae-Shik, \u201cHyung, should I tell the president and Sung-Hoon about Egos?\u201dTo explain what had happened inside the gate, Gi-Gyu had to first tell them about his Egos and unique ability. \u00a0President Oh Tae-Gu was Tae-Shik\u2019s father, but this alone wasn\u2019t enough for Gi-Gyu to trust the elderly man completely. His Egos, which were essentially his unique ability, were his biggest strength and weakness. Sharing this information with others came with great personal risk.\u2018After all, without my Egos, I\u2019m just the player who can\u2019t level up.\u2019When the Iron Guild caught Gi-Gyu, he learned what being apart from his Egos felt like. A crass description would be a junkie failing to get his next fix. Although drinking the elixir had helped him grow stronger, it still couldn\u2019t make up for what the Egos did for him.Tae-Shik replied, \u201cYou can trust the old man and Sung-Hoon. But of course, it\u2019s your decision. I can guarantee you that those men will never harm you, though.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu hesitated before voicing his thought, \u201cIf the president wanted to harm me, he could probably just kill me with his pinkie.\u201d Gi-Gyu was still afraid of Oh Tae-Gu. It wasn\u2019t the elderly man\u2019s personality or position\u2014It was the fact that Oh Tae-Gu was Asura, which meant his power had to be beyond Gi-Gyu\u2019s wildest imagination.Gi-Gyu thought for a moment before continuing, \u201cThen I will just tell him everything. I think I will need a lot of help from him, and it will be too difficult to come up with different explanations and excuses every time.\u201d\u201cAll right, and I\u2019ll help ensure you don\u2019t regret your decision. And if the old man harms you in any way, I\u201d\u2014Tae-Shik gave Gi-Gyu a naughty grin\u2014\u201cI will make you my heir!\u201d***\u201cThe existence of items with a consciousness and a growth rate is indeed surprising. Egos\u2026 huh. So you\u2019re saying that gate was also an Ego? And you synced with it\u2026?!\u201d Sung-Hoon gaped at such an incredible concept.Sung-Hoon, Gi-Gyu, Tae-Shik, and Tae-Gu were all sitting inside the association president\u2019s office. These four men were the people Gi-Gyu could trust the most inside the association.Tae-Gu asked discreetly, \u201cSo may I ask what happened to that gate?\u201d Asking about someone\u2019s unique ability could be considered rude, perhaps even aggressive. So, the president wasn\u2019t too overbearing with his question and maintained a respectful attitude.Gi-Gyu gave the elderly man a sour smile and replied, \u201cIt hasn't stabilized yet, so it isn\u2019t answering me. I guess the gate was badly damaged when I closed it.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Tae-Gu seemed disappointed by Gi-Gyu\u2019s answer. Actually, Gi-Gyu also felt the same way, as two of his three Egos weren\u2019t answering him. Lou was in the middle of his awakening, and the newly named Brunheart was also staying silent for some reason. Thankfully, there was a silver lining: Lou wasn\u2019t answering him, but he could still use Lou\u2019s attributes and skills.Gi-Gyu added, \u201cI will let you know when I find out more about it.\u201d\u201cAll right. I would appreciate it, and I will also do my best to find out as much about this as possible. Huh\u2026 A player who can control gates. If the world learns of this, it will create such turmoil,\u201d Tae-Gu murmured in concern.Based on what had happened so far, it seemed that Gi-Gyu could control gates. There was no way of knowing what this entailed, but if Gi-Gyu could control gates and the monsters within, it would be a game-changer.Gi-Gyu\u2019s value as a player would skyrocket\u2014measuring him in terms of power and importance would become nigh impossible. It wouldn\u2019t even matter if the gate he owned was a low or a high grade one.With determination in his eyes, the association president decided, \u201cWe\u2019ve to hide you better, Young Man. I will do my best to block those reporters from releasing your photos, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dWhen Tae-Gu promised, Gi-Gyu bowed and replied, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not burdening you with this, Sir.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Gi-Gyu. He never does anything that won\u2019t profit him in the long run,\u201d Tae-Shik announced.\u201cIndeed, the president is a savvy businessman,\u201d When Sung-Hoon agreed with Tae-Shik, Oh Tae-Gu raised his cane. He tried to smack them, but they blocked his attack with ease.Thud, thud.Narrowing his eyes, Tae-Gu turned toward Gi-Gyu and explained, \u201cAnyway, I will send the reward for completing this request to your bank account. Now, how do you feel about being an association merc? Is it to your liking?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded and replied without hesitation, \u201cIf there are any more missions like this, please let me know.\u201dTae-Gu gave Gi-Gyu a pleasing smile.***\u201cHyung,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured to Tae-Shik.\u201cYes?\u201dSince Sung-Hoon had parked Gi-Gyu\u2019s car at his home while he was inside the gate, Tae-Shik offered to drive him home. So, they were currently returning home in Tae-Shik\u2019s car. And Gi-Gyu took this opportunity to invite Tae-Shik to a family dinner.When they arrived, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother was still busy cooking. Yoo-Jung also hadn\u2019t returned home yet, so they sat in the living room and waited. Gi-Gyu was looking at his phone when suddenly, he asked in disbelief, \u201cHyung, is this right?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tae-Shik took Gi-Gyu\u2019s phone. After checking the content on the screen, Tae-Shik replied nonchalantly, \u201cYup, that looks about right.\u201dGi-Gyu took his phone back and gaped before wiping his phone screen. He asked again, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dTae-Shik got back to looking at Gi-Gyu\u2019s elementary school yearbook. He seemed quite interested in a particular snotty brat. He saw a photo he liked and was about to ask something when Gi-Gyu interrupted him.\u201cSo I was paid five billion won for the mission? Seriously?\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s voice remained calm, but his heart was pounding wildly.\u201cI said yes, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Tae-Shik seemed annoyed that Gi-Gyu kept asking the same question. He explained, \u201cYou are a mercenary for the association. And this is your pay for just closing a C-grade gate. You with me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou actually closed it all by yourself. On top of that, this gate almost broke. If it did, it would\u2019ve been a huge disaster. In simple terms, you\u2019re the hero who saved numerous lives!\u201d\u201cY-you think so?\u201d When Gi-Gyu stammered, Tae-Shik grinned and replied, \u201cYes. And the old man isn\u2019t an idiot. Do you have any idea what the public outrage would be like if the old man is stingy with paying a hero?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded, still unable to believe his account balance. He was paid five billion won for a few days' work. When he hunted the fourth-floor guardian as a part of the B-grade mercenary team, he got 500 million won. Seeing his bank account balance proliferate, Gi-Gyu became speechless.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI guess I will never have to worry about money again.\u201d He knew his whole family could live comfortably for the rest of their lives with just the money he had. And that was before his recent payout. There was a time when just spending a thousand won would make his hand tremble. Thinking about that, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but hug his phone as if it was a long-lost lover.\u201cGosh\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik sighed with a smile as he watched Gi-Gyu. He knew how hard Gi-Gyu\u2019s life had been until now, so he felt both pride and sorrow.After a moment of silence, Gi-Gyu shouted, \u201cMother! I\u2019m rich now!\u201d He left his room and ran to his mother in the kitchen.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53. Gate Ego (3)\u201cUwaah! So we\u2019re really rich now, Oppa?\u201d Yoo-Jung exclaimed in excitement.\u201cYup. So from now on, you better behave. You'll get nothing from me if you do anything inappropriate like spending the night with your boyfriend.\u201d When Gi-Gyu announced, Yoo-Jung licked her spoon and grumbled, \u201cYou should first ask if I even have one.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s mother, who had been listening quietly, advised, \u201cGi-Gyu, you need to be very careful with your money, so\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother seemed very hesitant talking about money. She knew how hard Gi-Gyu had worked to get here, so she didn\u2019t feel like she had the right to tell him what to do.Gi-Gyu knew what his mother was trying to say. He replied, \u201cAll I ever wanted was to have enough money for our family to live comfortably. And now that I have, I don\u2019t plan on suddenly changing my spending habits. I\u2019m just relieved that you and Yoo-Jung won\u2019t have to worry about money anymore.\u201d\u201cGood. I understand.\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother seemed happy with his answer. Gi-Gyu no longer had to make decisions based on money, so he gave her his honest thoughts. In the past, his days were filled with worrying about money. There seemed to be a never-ending need for it with his mother\u2019s hospital bills and all. Gi-Gyu never spent much on himself, and he didn\u2019t plan on starting now. To him, money was just a tool to buy necessary items and make his family happy.\u2018After all, there is something more important than money now.\u2019Now, power took priority over money for him. To protect his family from the dangers coming their way, he had to become the strongest version of himself.\u201cYoo-Jung, what is your plan now?\u201d Tae-Shik changed the subject smoothly.\u201cUmm\u2026 Could you get me a position inside the association, Ahjussi?\u201d When Yoo-Jung asked Tae-Shik, Gi-Gyu shot her a glare and replied, \u201cYoo-Jung. Just for that, you won\u2019t be getting an allowance this month.\u201dYoo-Jung\u2019s face turned blue in fear. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe how she tried to use Tae-Shik. He would\u2019ve scolded her if they were alone, but he didn\u2019t want to do this when he had company.Realizing what Gi-Gyu must\u2019ve thought, Yoo-Jung explained, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d After taking a deep breath, she continued, \u201cI want to study hard and get a position with the association. I really mean it, Oppa. I\u2019m not a player, but I still want to help you, even if it\u2019s just a little. I\u2019m just worried that you won\u2019t need my help if I wait longer. I can see you\u2019re busy every second of the day; I want to help, but there is nothing I can do.\u201dGi-Gyu became speechless. Sometimes, he forgot what a thoughtful girl Yoo-Jung was. Was it because he was her brother?\u2018She always looks like a little kid to me.\u2019Gi-Gyu only saw his little sister as a child even though she was now a mature young woman. But today, she did seem a little more grown-up than usual.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide your dream based on my needs, Yoo-Jung. I want you to do what you want. You don\u2019t even have to get a job. You can just enjoy your life, so\u2014\u201dSuddenly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother interrupted, \u201cGi-Gyu, this isn\u2019t a rash or injudicious decision on Yoo-Jung\u2019s part.\u201d She continued earnestly, \u201cYoo-Jung told me long ago that she wanted to help you. Even when I was sick and bedridden, she talked about this.\u201d\u201cMom!\u201d Yoo-Jung yelled in embarrassment.With a proud smile, Tae-Shik said quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see a family caring about each other. And if you want, I can get you a position inside the association where you can help Gi-Gyu, Yoo-Jung. But if you aren\u2019t good at it, you will be dismissed immediately, and someone else will take the position.\u201d\u201cGosh! I\u2019m going to work hard, okay?!\u201d Yoo-Jung announced loudly. Feeling embarrassed, she picked up the remote to turn on the TV. Gi-Gyu watched a player-related channel a moment ago, and Yoo-Jung didn\u2019t bother changing it.Just then, Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu\u2019s phones vibrated.Bzzz!Bzzz!-The Yeosu Gate\u2026The reporter on the TV was making an announcement when Yoo-Jung and Su-Jin noticed the strange looks on Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik\u2019s faces.\u201cO-Oppa\u2026?\u201cGi-Gyu?\u201dGi-Gyu raised his hand and asked, \u201cPlease give me a minute.\u201d He quickly answered the call from Sung-Hoon while Tae-Shik began talking to Tae-Gu. While hearing from their respective sides, the two men stared at the TV.-We have a problem, player Gi-Gyu.When Sung-Hoon said that, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cYeah, I think we do.\u201d-Tae-Shik, get back to the association. Now.The association president told his son. Oh Tae-Shik replied in annoyance, \u201cYou stupid old man! You said you were gonna take care of this!\u201dSuddenly, everyone in the living room glued their eyes to the TV. On a major player channel, a picture of Gi-Gyu in a weird mask was being shown.***-I\u2019m sure you are all aware of the recent appearance of an exceptional gate in Yeosu, correct?-Of course. In light of the recent exceptional gate appearances all around the globe, everyone was curious about how the association would handle it. Unlike what the majority believed, the association took care of it on its own instead of outsourcing it to the numerous guilds. That act piqued the public\u2019s interest even more.-Indeed. And yesterday, this exception gate was closed.-Pardon?Countless TV channels dealt with player-related news. This channel, the most popular one, was discussing the Yeosu Gate.One of the reporters asked calmly,-Did the association clear it?The main anchor answered with excitement,-Yes, it looks that way, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important! We just received a report stating this gate was teetering on the edge of breaking before it was closed.-What?It seemed that the reporter was genuinely shocked by this news. Did they not have a prewritten script in front of them?-Our channel could bring you this latest on-site information thanks to our brave player reporters. Apparently, the association managed to close the gate only moments before it was about to break. There is also a report of an unknown player walking out of the gate before it closed.Thankfully, the people believed that the gate was closed\u00a0before\u00a0the break rather than the unknown player walking out at the same time as it broke.-Oh! So this player must be the hero that saved Yeosu!-Exactly! Could this be the birth of a new ranker? Our reports state that only one player walked out from the gate.-What?! Pardon? Did I hear you correctly?The anchor grinned and answered,-Yes, you heard me right.-Then\u2026 Are you saying a single player alone closed a C-grade exceptional gate?-That\u2019s my point! Like I just said now\u2026The anchor paused and pointed at the camera to get every viewer\u2019s attention. He continued,-I believe this could be the birth of a new ranker!A short silence fell before the anchor added with excitement.-And we managed to obtain a single photo of this player. The association has asked all the reporters to relinquish any photos that showed this player\u2019s face. They destroyed all the photos taken that day, but we, the public\u2019s number one choice, managed to save one.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe they managed to save even one photo. It couldn\u2019t have been an easy or legal task. He suspected that the player paparazzi who sold this photo was now an enemy of the entire association, but they most likely also made a lot of money off of it.-We will end our programming today with the hero\u2019s photo!With the news anchor\u2019s announcement, the photo of a player wearing a mask filled the screen. In the photo, countless association agents surrounded this player in front of the Yeosu Gate.Tall, wearing a black mask with a large mouth, three noticeable rings, and one necklace. Not everyone would\u2019ve recognized Gi-Gyu from that photo, but anyone who knew him personally could tell who it was instantly.***Sun-Pil said on the phone, unable to contain his excitement.-That player in the photo is you, right, Gi-Gyu hyung? Suk-Woo hyung didn\u2019t even recognize you because you look so different now!Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cUmm\u2026 Well\u2026 I\u2019ll explain everything to you later.\u201d-All right! You can call me anytime, so please contact me when you get a chance!\u201cAll right.\u201dAs soon as Gi-Gyu hung up the phone, a text came from Kim Dong-Hae.-Player Kim Gi-Gyu, you\u2019re amazing.Gi-Gyu was getting texts and calls from everyone he knew. He didn\u2019t know all of them, but they all seemed very interested in him. Putting down his phone for a moment, Gi-Gyu massaged his temples. He muttered, \u201cThis will be a problem.\u201dSince the news channel only released a masked photo of Gi-Gyu, the general population had no idea who he was. However, and unfortunately, many still recognized him in that photo. Gi-Gyu knew it was only a matter of time before the world figured out his identity.Tae-Shik mumbled, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did the association president say?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, Tae-Shik replied, \u201cHe asked me to tell you how sorry he is about this debacle. He had no idea your photo would be released on the news like that. He didn\u2019t expect an annoyingly skilled paparazzi to be present at the time. This guy has been a thorn in the old man\u2019s side for a while.\u201dGi-Gyu became curious.\u201cThere is a paparazzi whom even the president can\u2019t handle?\u201d\u201cYeah. This guy used to be a pretty powerful ranker, but he now works as a player paparazzi. He uses a fake name, Go Hyung-Chul, and he\u2019s so skilled that even the association can\u2019t stop him.\u201d Tae-Shik seemed genuinely apologetic.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cGo Hyung-Chul\u2026\u201d After a short silence, he replied, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late to worry about what had already happened. There is no one to blame here, so we should just figure out our next move.\u201dGi-Gyu had gone through so many traumatic events that he wasn\u2019t overly bothered by this. His current mentality drove him into finding the solution to a problem rather than crying over it.Tae-Shik explained, \u201cThe old man\u2019s gonna call you very soon. He will offer a solution to this whole mess as an apology.\u201d\u201cSounds like a plan. For now, I better stay hidden as much as I can.\u201d\u201cExactly. Just make sure you stay with Sung-Hoon wherever you go outside,\u201d Tae-Shik suggested and apologized again. When Gi-Gyu nodded, Tae-Shik changed the subject. \u201cWe received a report of an odd movement inside the Iron Guild.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe have noted some hectic movements within that group in the past few days. We are still working on the details, but I don\u2019t think there is anything you need to worry about,\u201d explained Tae-Shik.Gi-Gyu nodded and replied, \u201cAll right.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything more, but he continued to massage his head, which was throbbing now. It seemed that this damned life of his would never let him have a moment of peace. When Gi-Gyu finally got a chance to become stronger, his mother\u2019s condition worsened. When his mother got better, Lucifer jumped into the picture. And when he got enough money to live the rest of his life peacefully, the entire world became interested in him. So many great things happened to him recently, but they were all followed by equally shitty problems.With a sigh, Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cHaaa\u2026 Just gotta accept my fate and prepare for the shitshow that might be my future.\u201d\u201cYou got it,\u201d encouraged Tae-Shik as he patted Gi-Gyu\u2019s back.Suddenly, Gi-Gyu looked at Tae-Shik and asked, \u201cHyung! Have you been hunting lately?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Tae-Shik scratched his cheek in embarrassment. Gi-Gyu could tell how much stronger Tae-Shik had become just from a light pat. Tae-Shik explained, \u201cJust a little\u2026 I can\u2019t just stay idle and lazy anymore. It\u2019s time for me to prepare myself too.\u201dWhen Tae-Shik looked away and stared into the distance, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cPrepare for what?\u201d\u201cPrepare to go higher,\u201d Tae-Shik replied with a mysterious smile.***Following the discussion with Tae-Shik, Gi-Gyu decided to stay home for a while. There was a good chance reporters were lingering outside the tower, waiting for the new \u201chero\u201d to appear. Gi-Gyu wanted to remain anonymous as long as possible, and staying home was the best idea he had.Another reason Gi-Gyu decided to take a break from hunting was his worries. Anxious, he called out to Lou, \u201cLou\u2026 You\u2019re okay, right?\u201dGi-Gyu wasn\u2019t sure what was going on with his Ego. Perhaps Lou\u2019s awakening was still underway because Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t even open his status screen. He wondered if the awakening could\u2019ve broken their sync, but he could still feel Lou\u2019s presence.El reassured him,-Please don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll endure it well.\"Endure what?\u201dWhile Lou was awakening, Gi-Gyu had the opportunity to have more frequent conversations with El. In the past, whenever Lou spoke, El tended to remain quiet. Gi-Gyu suspected El did this to avoid any confrontation with Lou.But now that Lou had gone silent, El began to speak much more.-We, the Egos, have minimal memories of our past, Master.\u201cYes, I am aware of that.\u201dGi-Gyu already knew that Lou and El didn\u2019t remember their lives before meeting him. Lou only knew that he had been waiting a long time and just some minor information on the Tower and some monsters. All El knew was just a bit about the devil she had been guarding. His Egos spurted out random information at odd times, but it was sporadic. It was as if something or someone was suppressing the Egos\u2019 memories.-Currently, we are in a state where our memories, along with most of our powers, are sealed.\u201cHuh?\u201d-This is what I learned after I awakened as the Empress of Holy Swords. I haven\u2019t told you until now because it didn\u2019t seem necessary, Master. But you seem so worried that I thought this would help you ease your concern.In perfect monotone, El explained,-I uncovered a layer of my seal by awakening as the empress, and he\u2019s doing the same.Gi-Gyu listened carefully as El continued,-He has served you faithfully until now, Master. I know he sometimes acts rudely, but I could feel that he cares for you deeply.\u201cI know that, El,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu warmly.-But\u2026El seemed hesitant before she added,-Lou is the Emperor of Black Magic. The master of all the evil swords.Slowly, El announced in certainty,-His is a vile existence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54. Gate Ego (4)Gi-Gyu mumbled, \u201cWhat do you mean, El?\u201d-Ah! I think you misunderstood me, Master.El corrected her statement,-I meant he\u00a0was\u00a0a vile existence.\u201cLou was a vile existence?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked, still confused. He wished he could have this conversation face to face with El.-Because we are just tools now. Your tools.There was sadness in El\u2019s voice as she continued,-That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s feeling confused right now. He must\u2019ve remembered his past, so it may take him a while to process everything. Please just be patient and wait for his return.\u201cBy the way, El\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu asked hesitantly, \u201cDoes that mean you went through this too?\u201d-Yes, Master.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t say another word as he patted El. He remembered the time when El didn\u2019t speak to him. It turned out she was being considerate while going through a tough time herself.***-Who is this hero of the Yeosu Gate?-Why is the association keeping mum about this whole situation?-Why is the association not making an official statement regarding this mysterious player? Is he the association\u2019s secret weapon?-Will this player lead Korea into the world league?-The player with the potential to become the next high ranker.-The association is playing favorites with the selected player. Is this wise?Countless articles about Gi-Gyu filled the newspapers and the online forums. Even with the mask, people could somehow make that he was a handsome devil, making the public even more interested in him. And Koreans weren't the only ones acting like chatty Cathies\u2014the entire world was interested in Gi-Gyu, believing in the inevitable birth of a new ranker.Very few players could become strong enough to be called a ranker, so there weren\u2019t that many of them. Consequently, the appearance of a player with such potential stirred the entire world.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. He murmured, \u201cI should be climbing the Tower right now.\u201d He needed to reach the 50th floor as quickly as possible, but he was stuck at home. Because if the paparazzi caught him and exposed his identity to the world, it would be a huge problem. This sitch frustrated Gi-Gyu, but it wasn\u2019t like he could kill all the player paparazzi just because they were trying to interview him.And then there were Lou and Brunheart: They were still keeping silent. But Gi-Gyu had no time to waste anymore. With a determined nod, he announced, \u201cI\u2019ll just wait for a bit longer, and if things don\u2019t settle down by then, I\u2019ll have no choice but to go. I\u2019ll have to climb the Tower sometime soon.\u201dGi-Gyu was sitting on the sofa when his mother approached him.\u201cGi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cYes, Mom?\u201d\u201cWould you like to walk with me?\u201d his mother asked him. Suddenly, Yoo-Jung, who was in her room, ran out when she heard Su-Jin\u2019s suggestion. She yelled with excitement, \u201cMe too! I wanna go for a walk too!\u201dWith a warm smile, their mother explained, \u201cIt\u2019s so rare for you to be home nowadays, so I would love it if we could spend the day as a family.\u201d\u2018I guess I\u2019ve been neglecting them,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought as he looked at his family. Usually, he spent all his free time worrying about not spending this time inside the Tower. Now that his mother was healthy and Yoo-Jung was also home most of the time, Gi-Gyu decided to no longer ignore them and spend some quality time with them.Resting at home quietly was Gi-Gyu\u2019s way of unwinding from having to kill as a profession. This was why he spent his time meaninglessly on the sofa or in his room whenever he was home.\u2018And Mother has also been staying inside a lot.\u2019Even after drinking the elixir, their mother rarely went out.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cIs there anywhere you would like to go, Mom?\u201d\u201cI heard there is a pretty cafe nearby, but I haven\u2019t been able to visit it since I can\u2019t drive. It would be nice to go there today as a family. What do you think?\u201d When their mother suggested, Yoo-Jung chirped, \u201cMe too! Me too!\u201d\u201cAre you a parrot or something, Yoo-Jung?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked with a grin.\u201cI wanna go out too! We haven\u2019t been able to leave the house much except when Sung-Hoon or Tae-Shik ahjussi took us out!\u201d Yoo-Jung grumbled.Gi-Gyu stood up and announced, \u201cThen we better go out for a drive. I\u2019ll get the car ready, so come out when you're ready.\u201dHe decided to spend this nice day with his family. Gi-Gyu put on his jacket, hat, and mask and left the house.***\u201cPfft.\u201d Yoo-Jung\u2019s suppressed laugh made Gi-Gyu narrow his eyes. He warned her, \u201cStop laughing.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201d When Gi-Gyu heard his sister laugh again, he began, \u201cYou\u2026!\u201d He was about to yell when his mother stopped him.Gi-Gyu\u2019s family sat at the cafe terrace that overlooked the Bukhan River. They were enjoying quality time as a family for once. Yoo-Jung had been teasing Gi-Gyu, saying he looked like a wanted criminal with his hat and black mask.Yoo-Jung mocked him, \u201cIf you walk around at night looking like that, all the girls will run away from you screaming!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not wearing all this because I want to. Besides, I don\u2019t plan on dating anyway,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied lightly.\u201cI\u2019m just saying that you\u2019ll get more attention by looking so suspicious,\u201d Yoo-Jung slurped her caramel macchiato and grumbled. Pointing toward the customers inside the cafe, she said to him, \u201cLook there.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu turned to look, he saw several female customers staring at him. With his enhanced hearing, he could hear their conversations clearly.\u201cAre they celebrities?\u201d one girl asked,\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think so,\u201d her companion whispered.\u201cYou should go and try to talk to him. He\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cBut can\u2019t you see those two women sitting with him? They are so pretty.\u201dGi-Gyu quickly took off his hat and mask, feeling embarrassed. He didn\u2019t want people to misunderstand why he was covering himself up. Once he revealed his handsome face, the girls inside the cafe exclaimed and chatted even more loudly. But soon, they stopped guessing if he was a celebrity.\u201cIt\u2019s so nice here.\u201d Enjoying the refreshing river breeze, Su-Jin murmured, \u201cComing out here with my son and daughter like this\u2026 I\u2019m so happy right now.\u201dWhen she smiled brightly, Yoo-Jung pointed inside the cafe again and whispered teasingly, \u201cMom! You need to look over there as well.\u201d It turned out that the female customers weren\u2019t the only ones interested in Gi-Gyu\u2019s family. Su-Jin discovered many male customers staring at her and murmuring among themselves.\u201cWow, she\u2019s so pretty. Are they all celebrities?\u201d one male customer exclaimed.\u201cWho\u2019s that man?\u201d asked his friend.\u201cHey, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s hanging out with that guy for his looks.\u201dGi-Gyu became angry as he listened to them talking about his mother. He considered teaching them a lesson, but he decided against it. He was with his mother and Yoo-Jung, so it was best not to make an unnecessary scene.\u2018Mother really does look very young now.\u2019Gi-Gyu never paid much attention to his mother\u2019s looks; objectively speaking, it was true that Su-Jin had become very beautiful. His mother now looked about the same age as Soo-Jung.Suddenly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes darkened as he thought of the reason that brought such a drastic change.\u2018Elixir.\u2019And that thought tugged on some nasty memories: What happened inside the maze. \u00a0They weren\u2019t fond memories, so Gi-Gyu\u2019s face became rigid.\u2018Lucifer\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu wondered what she must be doing right now. And where was she? With these thoughts, he slowly drank his coffee.***The time Gi-Gyu spent with his family was lovely. They went on picnics and chatted happily for the next several days. Gi-Gyu even registered his mother for a driving school. Enough time had passed that it was now safe for Su-Jin to enjoy an active lifestyle. The public transportation system was so horrible around their neighborhood that even grocery shopping without a car was near impossible. So, their family could do with another driver.Gi-Gyu had more than enough money in his account, so once his mother got her driver\u2019s license, he planned on buying her a car of her choice.Time passed peacefully, but the media\u2019s interest in Gi-Gyu remained. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He murmured, \u201cI don\u2019t have more time to wait.\u201dHe certainly didn\u2019t consider spending time with family a waste, but he had to remember his currently tricky situation. Many powerful enemies were chasing him, so Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling anxious.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu laughed bitterly. He murmured, \u201cI guess I can\u2019t rest until I become a high ranker.\u201d His enemies were such impressive fighters that he realized long ago he couldn\u2019t rest until he was just as strong, if not stronger. Most players could never dream of becoming a ranker, no matter how hard they worked. So Gi-Gyu felt daunted by the huge goal he had to accomplish.But this didn\u2019t mean he felt discouraged. Determined, he mumbled, \u201cI will reach the 50th floor no matter what! I swear!\u201d To his disappointment, no one applauded his confident statement. Usually, Lou would have made rude comments, calling Gi-Gyu an idiot. Gi-Gyu was surprised by how much Lou\u2019s absence affected him.Feeling Gi-Gyu\u2019s disappointment, El apologized,-I know you miss Lou\u2019s nasty comments, but I can\u2019t say such rude things to you, Master. How could I\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s all right, El. I\u2019m not feeling this way because I like being disrespected,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu with a smile. Grabbing his bag with the built-in expansion magic, he announced, \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cAre you going back to work?\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother asked with a worried look.\u201cYes, I can\u2019t stay home like this forever.\u201d\u201cPlease be careful. I will be devastated if you get hurt, Son.\u201dGi-Gyu opened the front door with a bright smile and reassured her, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry.\u201d He was finally on his way to return to the Tower. Before closing the door behind him, Gi-Gyu said to his mother, \u201cI am living my dream right now.\u201d***\u201cWow\u2026 This is crazy,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured when he saw a large group outside the association. The reporters were swarming the building like a colony of ants. Some were even holding large signs stating their demands.-Release the masked man\u2019s identity to the public!Gi-Gyu pushed his hat down to hide his face better. He wore oversized clothes today on purpose, hoping they would help prevent people from recognizing him. He dawdled among the reporters to get to his destination. Around him, other players were also having difficulty reaching the Tower. They grumbled,\u201cGosh, these reporters! They are such a nuisance.\u201d\u201cThey are why reporters get such a bad rap.\u201d\u201cWho cares if there is a new ranker? Why are they making such a big deal?!\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling apologetic, realizing he was the reason behind all this.\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2019Unfortunately, Gi-Gyu was an unusually tall guy. Every time he took a step, he easily pushed away several reporters. Some reporters began to eye him with interest, making Gi-Gyu pause anxiously. Just then, one of the reporters started to walk up to him cautiously.Step, step\u2026Many thoughts crossed Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind at that moment. He was trying to come up with a lie or an excuse for this reporter while suppressing his annoyance as best as he could. The man finally reached Gi-Gyu and whispered warily, \u201cAre you also a reporter? If you just got here, you need to move to the back.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI can tell that you\u2019re a rookie. We\u2019ve been waiting here for a long time, so this is our spot. Just go to the back and wait there! If you cut in line like this, the older reporters will get very angry at you. There are many player paparazzi here, so you better watch your manners.\u201dNod.Gi-Gyu nodded without thinking and began walking toward where the reporter pointed. Coincidently, the spot was near the Tower, where he wanted to go anyway.He was walking there when he spotted a familiar face. Gi-Gyu suddenly became angry as he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dSung-Hoon seemed confused as he stared at Gi-Gyu. He asked in return, \u201cI should be the one asking you why you\u2019re here, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cI meant\u2014\u201d Gi-Gyu was about to ask why Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t come to pick him up. But suddenly, he realized he never called Sung-Hoon to come and get him. Gi-Gyu closed his mouth in embarrassment, secretly relieved he stopped in time.When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t finish his sentence, Sung-Hoon stated, \u201cI figured you were taking a break, but I guess you managed to make it here today. The association president has been so frustrated by these idiots here.\u201dSung-Hoon shook his head in annoyance and continued jokingly, \u201cIf our president were a red player, all these people would\u2019ve died. It would\u2019ve been the return of Asura! Damn! That would\u2019ve been quite a sight, but I suppose human lives are too precious.\u201dLooking toward the Tower, Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cAre you on your way into the Tower?\u201d\u201cYes, If I have to hide for a while, I thought it would be best to spend my time hunting in the Tower,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. After all, the best place to hide from your average reporters was inside this magical structure.Sung-Hoon nodded in agreement. \u201cThe player paparazzi looking for you in the Tower are all on the high floors. They think you\u2019re already a ranker. So I think you\u2019re safe to go inside and do your thing.\u201dThat was exactly what Gi-Gyu thought when he chose to enter the Tower. He nodded and was about to walk on when suddenly, he heard an unfamiliar voice in his head.-Are you his master?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55. Gate Ego (5)Sung-Hoon caught the sudden change in Gi-Gyu\u2019s expression, so he called out, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Gi-Gyu woke up from his thoughts and announced, \u201cOh, I better get inside the Tower now.\u201d\u201cPardon? Oh, of course.\u201d Before Sung-Hoon could say much, Gi-Gyu entered the Tower. Sung-Hoon noticed the change in Gi-Gyu\u2019s demeanor, but the swarm of reporters soon pulled his attention back. He had no idea what he had to do to fix this problem.***-Answer me.Another message entered Gi-Gyu\u2019s head when he didn\u2019t respond.-Are you his master?Gi-Gyu needed a safe place to have this conversation. He quickly ran to the Tower, and once inside, he heard the voice again.-Are you\u2014\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as his eyes darkened. This being, whoever it was, was relaying its message directly into Gi-Gyu\u2019s head. It could mean only two things: It was either a powerful player or an Ego.But the question it asked was if Gi-Gyu was \u201chis\u201d master, not \u201ca master.\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand the question due to the odd wording.-I\u2019m the great\u2026 Umm\u2026 My name is\u2026 Huh\u2026?The being\u2019s voice, solemn and staid before, sounded confused.-Bru\u2026nheart\u2026 That\u2019s my name.Its voice sounded so grand that Gi-Gyu expected another devil or one of his enemies, yet it seemed that it was just his new Ego, Brunheart. Gi-Gyu released a sigh of relief and felt the tension leaving his body.\u201cYou asked for a name, so I gave it to you not too long ago. How could you have forgotten it already?\u201d-...\u201cAnd what do you mean if I\u2019m \u2018his\u2019 master? What the heck are you talking about? And where are you, by the way?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion. He wasn\u2019t wearing \u201cBrunheart\u201d at the moment; he didn\u2019t even know what it was supposed to look like. The voice inside his head answered promptly,-Call my name.\u201cBrunheart,\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s calm voice rang inside the Tower. He was only on the first floor, and he chose a remote place before speaking with Brunheart. Gi-Gyu could also tell there was no one nearby based on his enhanced senses.He had no idea what calling out this new Ego\u2019s name might do, but he was sure he could handle the consequences. After all, this wasn\u2019t his first time interacting with an Ego.[The nonphysical form of Ego Brunheart has been summoned.]Along with the system announcement, a black sphere began materializing before him.\u201cN-no!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled nervously; thankfully, nothing happened, except for the appearance of Brunheart\u2019s nonphysical form.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dIn the past, when Lou appeared in his nonphysical form, he sucked in everything around him to produce his physical form. However, Brunheart\u2019s nonphysical form did no such thing. Was it because Brunheart was different, or\u2026\u201cIs it because I\u2019m stronger now?\u201dSince nothing happened, Gi-Gyu felt embarrassed for shouting like a lunatic; at the same time, he also felt relieved.[Brunheart\u2019s physical form hasn\u2019t been decided.][Please choose Brunheart\u2019s physical form.]A different system voice made the request. Gi-Gyu deduced that he was too weak even to decide Lou\u2019s form in the past. That was why the system chose a random form for his Ego at the time. But now that he was stronger, Gi-Gyu finally got a say in his Ego\u2019s physical form.But\u2026\u201cHow am I supposed to decide?\u201dGi-Gyu slowly walked toward the black sphere and tapped it gently. But the sphere remained immobile; it just continued to float in the air. After contemplating for what seemed like hours, Gi-Gyu gave up and asked El for help.\u201cEl, what am I supposed to do?\u201d-Please place your hand on the sphere and imagine the shape you would like for it to take. Brunheart will transform according to your wish.\u201cI see.\u201dEl had been like a passive observer from the very beginning, so she never actively offered comments like Lou and only spoke when spoken to. All this was a telltale sign of a quiet personality.After patting El for a moment, Gi-Gyu placed his hand on the sphere and murmured, \u201cBrunheart.\u201dThere was a reason why he named his newest Ego Brunheart. Gi-Gyu hoped that giving the new Ego his old armor\u2019s name would transfer the experiences he shared with the armor.Gi-Gyu was thankful to the old Brunheart and missed it terribly. Although it couldn\u2019t speak, Gi-Gyu felt certain that his armor was alive at the time. Sadly, Brunheart ended up being used and abused before getting killed to save Gi-Gyu.Bzzz.Slowly, the sphere began to rotate and transform into its new form.***-Masterrrrr\u2026-Masterrrrrrrr\u2026-Masterrrrrrrr.-Master\u2026When someone called out to Gi-Gyu desperately, he replied, \u201cYes?\u201d-I\u2019m so happy that I get to be with you again, Master!It was Brunheart.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his surprise when he learned of the newly formed Brunheart\u2019s personality. It was very unexpected, especially considering what the Ego sounded like in its nonphysical form.\u2018I was expecting Brunheart to be more of a silent knight type who\u2019s always there to protect me\u2026\u2019-Master! Does that mean you hate me? I\u2026 But I\u2019m your Brunheart!There was no doubt: Brunheart\u2019s voice sounded like a kid. His quivering voice made Gi-Gyu think he would start crying at the drop of a hat. Gi-Gyu shouted, \u201cNo! Of course not, Brunheart! I like you a lot!\u201dGi-Gyu was still inside the Tower. So, his sudden proclamation attracted quite a few curious eyes. Thankfully, they quickly lost interest because oddballs inside the Tower were as usual as fights in a bar.Blushing visibly, Gi-Gyu began to walk fast.-Hehe, I like you too, Master.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed and patted his chest where a black sphere was now embedded. He murmured, \u201cGot the arc reactor. Just lacking the billions now.\u201d Much like the American hero movie, Gi-Gyu now had a black, metallic sphere stuck on his\u00a0upper abdomen.Brunheart seemed very different from the other Egos he possessed. While it was transforming into its final physical form, Brunheart suddenly jumped onto Gi-Gyu and began to assimilate with him. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t feel any pain, and when he accepted it, Brunheart found its place in the center of his torso. The sphere felt odd to Gi-Gyu, perhaps even a little uncomfortable, but he expected to get used to it in no time.\u2018He feels like an extension of my body.\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s biggest weakness was that he was powerless without his Egos. Drinking the elixir helped a little, but just that couldn\u2019t help him fight powerful foes.Thankfully, his newest Ego became part of his body. It meant that there was no way anyone could take it away from him. Unlike Lou and El, Brunheart would stay with him for the rest of his life.\u2018I guess the old Brunheart made my wish come true.\u2019Gi-Gyu had been praying to get Brunheart back, so he felt his prayer was answered. Now, he had something that could always protect him.-Did I do well, Master?!\u201cYeah, you\u2019re great,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he rubbed his stomach.\u2018I know I must look like a pervert, but it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu knew what constantly rubbing his body would make him look like, but he couldn\u2019t help it.-Hehe.Brunheart seemed happy with the pats. With a smile, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI must first analyze your abilities, Brunheart.\u201d-Of course!Gi-Gyu opened Brunheart\u2019s status screen.[Brunheart][Grade E][Gate Ego][Power: 30][Speed: 30][Stamina: 30][Magic: 30]-Abilities-[Bodily\u00a0Incorporation][Reflect: A portion of all damage received will be reflected toward the enemy.][Absorption: Can absorb other gates to become stronger.][Control: Can absorb and thereby control gates of lower grade.][Open: Can open a gate.][Close: Can close a gate.][Ego with inherited memories]\u201cUwaah\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu was genuinely impressed. Like his other Egos, Brunheart\u2019s status screen included the descriptions of his skills; his new Ego had an array of fancy skills.But there were also a few differences.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a level,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. Was it because it was a gate Ego? Instead of a numerical level, Brunheart only had a grade. Gi-Gyu also noticed that Brunheart\u2019s abilities were all equal. And lastly, Brunheart had Bodily Incorporation instead of Accessory. Being an Ego with inherited memories, the new Brunheart also retained Reflect.\u201cI love it.\u201d Gi-Gyu was glad to have the amazing reflection skill back, but more importantly, this proved that he really did get the old armor back.-Hehe, I love you too, Master.\u201cBut what are these other skills? Absorption? Control?\u201d Gi-Gyu wondered out loud. He had never heard of these skills before. Based on the names and the descriptions, he could make an educated guess of what they were, but it was hard to believe such functions really existed.-It means I can absorb other gates and control them! Of course, I\u2019m talking about just the ones you get to possess, Master.Brunheart replied in an insecure voice. He didn\u2019t seem confident in his own skills, but all Gi-Gyu could do was gape in surprise. With all these skills, only one word could describe Brunheart's potential: Unlimited. But Gi-Gyu was still confused about Control. What did it mean to control a gate? What were the parameters of his control? And so on. He decided to test it out if he ever got the chance in the future.\u201cOpen?\u201d Gi-Gyu only meant to ask what this skill meant, but suddenly, the sphere embedded in his body released a flash of light.\u201cW-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Gi-Gyu was stammering in confusion when a skeleton soldier abruptly appeared from the light.Rattle.Without hesitation, Gi-Gyu swung El, and the skeleton crumbled down to the ground helplessly.\u201cClose!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled in panic. Since he could open a gate, he could also close them. And to his relief, the black sphere absorbed the light back.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu laughed in surprise, Brunheart asked,-What\u2019s wrong, Master?\u201cI\u2019m just ecstatic!\u201d Indeed, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t believe his incredible luck.***It had been almost a week since he began hunting inside the Tower again. Lou was still in the midst of awakening, i.e., he remained silent, but the sword could still absorb monsters\u2019 stats. Hoping the added strength might help Lou, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t stop hunting.Currently, he was on the 28th floor. He could climb this fast because he never left the Tower, not even to sell the crystals he gathered along the way. Hard jerkies became his staple food, and his now bearded face made him look like a handsome barbarian.\u201cWhat do I do now? If I leave the Tower right now, it will be hard for me to return with all those reporters outside,\u201d Gi-Gyu wondered as he rubbed his unkempt beard. In front of him was a field of crystals. It almost looked like the crystals were magically growing from the field, but they were actually from all the monsters Gi-Gyu had killed earlier. His bag had built-in expansion magic, but even that couldn\u2019t hold this many crystals. He didn\u2019t bring an extra bag with him, so he had no choice but to leave these crystals behind.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to waste them like this.\u201d Gi-Gyu was now rich beyond his wildest imagination, but old habits died hard. On top of that, these crystals had to be worth a fortune. Gi-Gyu didn't feel comfortable throwing away that much money.Feeling stuck, Gi-Gyu looked around in concern.-Master! Me! Me!\u201cHmm?\u201dBrunheart yelled in his childish voice,-Me! You can store them inside me!\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe gate Brunheart could open was the same gate Gi-Gyu closed in Yeosu. The problem was that he had no control over the monsters inside. Through Brunheart, Gi-Gyu could only open and close the gate; he couldn\u2019t control the monsters' regeneration. In summary, neither Brunheart nor Gi-Gyu could control this gate\u2019s skeletons. It meant that if he stored the crystals inside, they could disappear or be lost.\u201cBut I guess it would be better than throwing them away like this.\u201d In the end, Gi-Gyu decided to follow Brunheart\u2019s suggestion. First, he gathered all the crystals in one place. This process didn\u2019t take long because he used the acceleration skill, Accelerate. After creating a small hill of crystals, Gi-Gyu yelled toward it, \u201cGate open!\u201dBlue light flashed from Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest and swallowed the mound of crystals whole.And\u2026[The gate has gained experience points.][The monsters inside the gate are becoming stronger.][The gate\u2019s grade will increase after gaining enough experience points.]An unfamiliar system voice announced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56. Cain GuildGi-Gyu remained dazed for a moment.Rattle.He forgot to close the gate immediately in his daze, and a skeleton soldier used this opportunity to make a break.\u201cHup!\u201d With a short breath, Gi-Gyu sliced the monster in half. His body now worked on autopilot whenever he saw a monster.\u201cHuh?\u201d But something felt a little different. Gi-Gyu could tell the skeleton\u2019s strength and speed had increased slightly. It was such a subtle difference that he wouldn\u2019t have felt it if not for his improved senses.\u201cDoes this mean the monsters inside the gate become stronger if I put crystals inside?\u201d-I think so!Brunheart replied cheerfully. Rubbing his rough beard, Gi-Gyu shook his head and murmured, \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I can control them. If they become stronger, it will be just more annoying for me whenever I open or close a gate.\u201dSuddenly, a random thought crossed his mind.\u201cWait! I can hunt them, right? If I just put the crystals, which I can\u2019t carry anyway, to make those monsters stronger\u2026 And then if I hunt them later\u2026\u201dHowever, a frown appeared on his face as he realized something.\u201cDammit! I can\u2019t enter this gate myself!\u201dOr could he? Gi-Gyu decided to test it out immediately. He opened the gate and tried to enter it from all directions. Unfortunately, failure smacked his face every time he tried to enter the gate: The gate would close every time he tried to step in. He wished he could ask someone else to enter the gate, but he didn\u2019t want to put anyone in danger. Consequently, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t test to see if\u00a0anyone\u00a0could enter this gate.\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find its use someday,\u201d muttered Gi-Gyu. At the very least, he didn\u2019t waste his crystals by abandoning them in the Tower. He resumed walking, feeling satisfied with his situation.***Gi-Gyu soon reached the 29th floor. The 30th floor was just above him; he would enter a whole new world after crossing that line. More red players could be found on the higher floors while the association\u2019s authority and protection weakened. Suffice to say, stronger monsters wouldn\u2019t be his only problem on the floors above.So, once he was close to reaching the 30th floor, Gi-Gyu decided to take a short break. His beard had grown so much that it was now enough to cover the general shape of his face. Oh, and Brunheart hadn\u2019t stopped talking in the meanwhile.-Master, I\u2019m so sad! I\u2019ll get to see your mother and sister soon, right?! I want to meet them as soon as possible! My master\u2019s family! I also want to meet the Ego named Lou. Oh, and El is way too quiet.\u2018Brunheart is so talkative.\u2019But Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t mind it. Lou was still silent, so there was no constant flow of sarcastic comments. El was barely speaking, as usual. All in all, there was no one else in the Tower he could talk to. So, Brunheart was actually helping Gi-Gyu maintain his basic social skills.-By the way, why don\u2019t you hunt with other players, Master?\u201cBecause it\u2019s annoying.\u201d-Annoying?\u201cExactly.\u201d Gi-Gyu rubbed his beard again and realized it was now covering his cheeks.\u2018I better shave it off soon.\u2019He smirked, imagining how ridiculous he must look right now. Stretching his arms, Gi-Gyu answered Brunheart\u2019s question, \u201cEveryone here is weaker than me. Since I\u2019m much faster at hunting, anyone I hunt with will just waste time admiring me.\u201d-Hmm\u2026Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t being pompous. While most players hunting on this floor were C-grade, he was almost a ranker, so no one here could match his speed or strength.\u201cBesides, humans\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu slowly stood up\u2014\u201d can be very jealous. Most people want to defeat foes stronger than them. That is unless they encounter someone way beyond their reach. The Tower is a dangerous place, to begin with, so I don\u2019t want the added risk of hunting with others.\u201d-Hmm\u2026 It\u2019s so tricky. I wish I had a body, so I could run and hunt with you, Master!Gi-Gyu laughed and agreed, \u201cI would love that too.\u201dIf Egos had physical bodies and could work with him, Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve considered them his true companions.\u201cI\u2019m sure if we keep working hard, we\u2019ll find an answer.\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu resumed hunting.***It didn\u2019t take long for Gi-Gyu to become well known in the Tower. The 20-something floors held many players, but they were all C-grade on average. One could find most of the players between the 20th and the 30-something floors. So, even though Gi-Gyu tried his best to avoid other people, many still saw him and his feats.Like the other players, he had to find the spots with the most monsters, so he frequently met various players. But they never tried to make conversation with Gi-Gyu or interfere with his hunt. After all, he was large and had an eerie look. He wielded his double swords to massacre all monsters in sight wherever he went. That, along with his messy beard, pictured a not-so-good image in everyone\u2019s minds.While watching Gi-Gyu battle, one onlooker murmured, \u201cThat player definitely doesn\u2019t belong on this floor.\u201d\u201cUgh, he looks so scary. He couldn\u2019t be a red player, could he?\u201d his companion whispered in fear. The other players were curious about who Gi-Gyu was, but no one was brave enough to approach this monster-killing machine.\u201cBy the way, doesn\u2019t he kind of look like that hero on TV?\u201d wondered one of the players from a hunting group nearby.\u201cYou mean that masked ranker?\u201d another player asked.\u201cYes, him. Maybe not\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell, this guy does have a similar body\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, come on! I heard that the Yeosu hero is the association\u2019s secret weapon. Why would such an important player be here on the 29th floor looking like that?\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201dThe longer Gi-Gyu stayed in the Tower, the more interest he seemingly attracted from his fellow players. A few wondered if he was the Yeosu hero, nicknamed the mask ranker, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.Gi-Gyu was eavesdropping on their conversations while diligently hunting. After killing the last monster in a herd, he murmured, \u201cHmm\u2026 This is good. I feel relieved.\u201dGi-Gyu was afraid someone might recognize him, so he was considering wearing the full ski mask Sung-Hoon gave him earlier. But it seemed that not wearing anything and walking around confidently helped hide his identity.\u201cPhew\u2026 I think I\u2019m almost done.\u201d A few more herds and Lou wouldn\u2019t need the blood of this floor\u2019s monsters for stat points. He expected to finish up in a day or two. Afterward, he planned on taking some time off before attempting the 30th-floor test. The cornerstones for his plan were finally beginning to take shape.\u201cI\u2019m way behind schedule,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu in disappointment since it took him much longer than expected to reach this floor. However, he didn\u2019t mind this delay because he was becoming stronger at a surprising speed.Gi-Gyu gradually moved to a more isolated area to find another herd of monsters. Thanks to him, the monsters in the nearby areas were almost extinct. His bag was still a crystal away from bursting, so he had been feeding all the crystals to Brunheart. The monsters of this area would take a while to regenerate, so he needed to find another place to hunt.Suddenly!Clang, clang.Gi-Gyu\u2019s sensitive ears picked up the sounds of clashing weapons and skills.\u201cKyaa!\u201d\u201cYou bastards!\u201dThe screams and shouts of many players followed the clangs, clanks, and clangors.\u201cWe\u2019re from the Cain Guild! Do you think you can get away with this?!\u201d Gi-Gyu heard the pained voice of a player.\u201cWe\u2019re going to kill you all here anyway, so who cares? No one will find out,\u201d a vicious voice replied.Gi-Gyu was about to walk away, but when he heard \u201cCain Guild,\u201d he paused and continued to eavesdrop.\u201cDammit. The guild master was right. We shouldn\u2019t have come here!\u201d a desperate voice muttered.\u201cThe Smurfs\u2026 They are too strong\u2026\u201d another voice groaned in despair. Gi-Gyu could hear their anguish and hopelessness. With a sigh, he turned around and headed toward the battle; he used Accelerate to reach there as quickly as possible. Since he had become much stronger, Accelerate had also amplified accordingly. The battle took place far away, but Gi-Gyu arrived there in no time, thanks to the amplification.\u201cWhat?! Who the heck are you?!\u201d The player who first spotted Gi-Gyu yelled.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, just get lost! We\u2019ll kill you on the spot if you get involved!\u201d a player with a red mark on his chest warned.\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine, so please run and get some help!\u201d one of the players from the Cain Guild screamed at Gi-Gyu. The Cain Guild member didn\u2019t want Gi-Gyu to get hurt by getting involved. Feeling even more sure about what he must do, Gi-Gyu moved and swung his swords simultaneously.Slash!The sound of a sword cutting into human flesh rang ominously. Everyone stared in shock, forgetting they were in the middle of a battle.Thud, roll.The head of one of the red players fell and rolled on the ground.Psst!A fountain of blood began to spew out from the dead man's severed neck. Gi-Gyu, standing closest to the body, became covered in blood as he announced, \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201dNo one raised their hands.***\u201cT-thank you.\u201d Do Bong-Gu, one of Cain Guild\u2019s mid-level guides, bowed deeply. He was thanking Gi-Gyu respectfully, but the guide couldn\u2019t hide his intense fear. What Gi-Gyu did to the Smurf Guild member was beyond sinister. Without using a single skill or ability, Gi-Gyu had just killed a player with momentum alone.The other Smurf members ran without even taking care of their dead player\u2019s body. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t bother to chase after them because he knew they wouldn\u2019t recognize him later.\u2018Hmm\u2026 Cannibalism didn\u2019t absorb him; the same happened when Choi Won-Jae died. Is this because Lou is still occupied by his awakening? Or does this skill only works on ranker level players?\u2019Even though Do Bong-Gu was voicing his gratitude, all Gi-Gyu could do was think about this question. Gi-Gyu remembered Choi Won-Jae being almost egofied due to Cannibalism. But the same thing hadn\u2019t happened a second time since then.\u201cU-um\u2026\u201d Do Bong-Gu murmured in confusion when Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I was checking something in my head.\u201d When Gi-Gyu apologized for his rudeness, Do Bong-Gu stammered, \u201cN-no, it's all right. I just wanted to thank you again for your help.\u201dThe other Cain Guild members approached Gi-Gyu and murmured, \u201cThank you.\u201dGi-Gyu shook his hands and smiled as he replied, \u201cNo worries. I only helped because I know your guild master.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYour guild master is Suk-Woo, right?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d Do Bong-Gu looked at Gi-Gyu with suspicion.\u201cI\u2019m friends with Suk-Woo. I was going to just walk by, but I heard you mentioning the Cain Guild, so I came to help,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained.\u201cOh! I see!\u201dPlayers scarcely helped each other in situations like these since no one wanted to risk their lives to help others. The red players knew this very well and used it to single out players and attack them.Gi-Gyu asked Do Bong-Gu, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a well-known hotspot for red players? Why did you come here?\u201dGi-Gyu could tell Do Bong-Gu was the leader of this group, so he spoke to the Cain Guild guide directly. Do Bong-Gu scratched his head and murmured, \u201cWell\u2026 We heard about the bulk massacring of monsters going on inside the Tower. Since we hadn\u2019t entered the Tower in a while, we entered today to see if the rumor was true. We were told some random weirdo was hunting all the monsters\u2014\u201dSuddenly realizing the \u201cweirdo\u201d was Gi-Gyu, Do Bong-Gu raised his hands and apologized, \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\u2018What a strange man.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought as he watched Do Bong-Gu become flustered. However, Gi-Gyu also felt apologetic since all these players were forced into this dangerous area because he massacred the monsters everywhere else.But still, this group shouldn\u2019t have come here even if they couldn\u2019t find any monsters in their regular spots. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cBut as a group leader, you shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201dHis face turning a little red, Do Bong-Gu replied, \u201cI knew there were red players here, but I didn\u2019t think they would dare attack us, the Cain Guild.\u201dGi-Gyu had to agree with Do Bong-Gu\u2019s rebuttal. The Cain Guild was a pretty famous group in Korea. Attacking its players would\u2019ve resulted in dire consequences for those red players. Gi-Gyu could now understand why this guide felt safe entering this area.However, when was it not better to be safe than sorry? Gi-Gyu stated firmly, \u201cYou never know what those bastards might do.\u201d\u201cAh, of cours\u2014\u201dThe sentence, \u201cBut you look just as suspicious and dangerous as them,\u201d was about to leave Do Bong-Gu, but he stopped himself just in time.Still feeling guilty for killing all the monsters in the area, Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cThen would you like to hunt with me for a while?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI know some areas nearby where you can find many monsters. I can help you for a while if you wish.\u201d Do Bong-Gu contemplated the offer. Although the scary bearded player in front of him claimed he knew Guild Master Suk-Woo, Do Bong-Gu wasn\u2019t naive enough to believe it without any proof. However, it also didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to harm them since he had just saved them. Then again, it was stupid to believe any strangers inside the Tower.Realizing Do Bong-Gu\u2019s hesitation, Gi-Gyu quickly introduced himself.\u201cAh, I guess I didn\u2019t even tell you my name. I doubt Suk-Woo ever mentioned me, but\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu scratched his cheek shyly and offered his hand\u2014\u201cmy name is Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dGi-Gyu forgot that his hand was soaked in blood, but Do Bong-Gu didn\u2019t care. A bright smile appeared on Do Bong-Gu\u2019s face when he heard Gi-Gyu\u2019s name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57. Cain Guild (2)\u201cOur guild master has mentioned you a few times during the general assembly! He told us that he had a friend he wanted to scout to our guild. He said it was an amazing player named Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d Do Bong-Gu was acting as if he was in the presence of a celebrity.Feeling embarrassed by the guide\u2019s unexpected reaction, Gi-Gyu lowered his face and wondered, \u2018What exactly did Suk-Woo tell these guys? Why is he so excited to see me?\u2019\u201cBy the way, could you\u2026\u201d When Do Bong-Gu murmured, Gi-Gyu caught on immediately and took out his player registration card. This card didn\u2019t include the player\u2019s grade and could only be used for identification. Do Bong-Gu wasn\u2019t comfortable taking this bearded man\u2019s word for it, but he was satisfied after confirming Gi-Gyu\u2019s identity. He announced, \u201cIf you\u2019re the Player Kim Gi-Gyu whom our guild master talked about, I am sure I can trust you.\u201dDo Bong-Gu finally decided to discuss the offer with his fellow guild members. And together, they quickly decided that it was in their best interest to hunt with Gi-Gyu.Do Bong-Gu watched Gi-Gyu with both interest and confusion.\u2018He is so different from what the guild master told us. Wasn\u2019t the guild master worried about his friend\u2019s caring nature\u2026?\u2019Do Bong-Gu's doubts didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t grateful for Gi-Gyu\u2019s help. They were inside the Tower, their enemies were the red players, and Gi-Gyu had every right to kill them. However, that didn\u2019t mean he had to accept that Gi-Gyu had a \u201ccaring nature.\u201d After all, Gi-Gyu beheaded that red player without hesitation and was now laughing playfully with the other guild members as if nothing had happened.Do Bong-Gu couldn\u2019t help feeling a little nervous about Gi-Gyu. However, he was certain that Gi-Gyu meant no harm to the Cain Guild members, which was the only reason Do Bong-Gu decided to follow him.\u2018If he turns on us, we can still run.\u2019Unlike the battle with the Smurf Guild members, Gi-Gyu was alone. Gi-Gyu's vicious aura alone was enough to make the Smurf players run; even so, Do Bong-Gu felt confident that his group could escape if necessary.Do Bong-Gu announced, \u201cThanks to your help, we could escape the red players, but I think I should still make a report to our guild immediately.\u201dGi-Gyu agreed, \u201cGo ahead.\u201dDo Bong-Gu sent one player from his group to deliver the message, and the rest of them began following Gi-Gyu.***\u201cIt\u2019s over here.\u201d Gi-Gyu guided the players to an area he cleared a few days ago. By now, some monsters had regenerated, so this was a perfect time to hunt.\u201cOhh!\u201d Do Bong-Gu exclaimed in excitement. They were having a hard time finding monsters this morning, but Gi-Gyu was right. Here, they could see many monsters roaming around.Do Bong-Gu asked, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have my players check their weapons and get right to the hunt. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied.Turning toward the other guild members, Do Bong-Gu began to prepare them.While Gi-Gyu was watching quietly from the sidelines, Brunheart asked in confusion,-Master! Why are you doing this? You said you weren\u2019t going to hunt with the other humans!\u2018My friend runs their guild. He helped me a lot in the past, so I want to repay a bit of my debt.\u2019Gi-Gyu took the time to explain his action.\u2018I also wanted to ask them how things were going outside the Tower. I think it\u2019s time for me to leave, so I need to know if it\u2019s safe to go out now.\u2019Gi-Gyu could\u2019ve gained all the necessary information from the employees at the portal by using his association mercenary status. However, he was still awkward about using his new authority. So this was the perfect opportunity for Gi-Gyu to help his friend while getting the information he needed.\u2018I hope the reporters outside are gone by now.\u2019Gi-Gyu believed those reporters couldn\u2019t have found his identity while he was inside, but he still felt overwhelmed by them. Enough time had passed, so Gi-Gyu felt the reporters must\u2019ve left by now.Do Bong-Gu returned to Gi-Gyu after completing all the preparations. He announced, \u201cWe\u2019ll begin hunting now. We\u2019ll continue until you\u2019ve to leave, Player Kim Gi-Gyu, so please let me know.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Do Bong-Gu ordered the players, \u201cNow, you may begin your hunt. But please don\u2019t go too far out of my sight.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d the Cain Guild members answered with excitement. They had seemingly forgotten all about their near-death experience at the hands of those red players. Currently, they were just thrilled to see so many monsters and ran toward them.Only Do Bong-Gu remained standing by Gi-Gyu\u2019s side. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to hunt?\u201d\u201cI can do it later. I\u2019m their guide, after all, so I must do my duties first.\u201d When Do Bong-Gu answered with a smile, Gi-Gyu realized Suk-Woo did an excellent job training his guild members.Seeing the mid-level guide felt refreshing; Gi-Gyu recalled when he used to work as a guide himself. He never reached the mid-level, but he still helped many novice players through the tutorial floors.Do Bong-Gu started a conversation. \u201cI heard you used to be a guide yourself.\u201d\u201cI was.\u201d It seemed Suk-Woo had told his guild members a lot about Gi-Gyu. His voice filled with elation, Do Bong-Gu chatted, \u201cIsn\u2019t guiding the players to the right path amazing?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond, Do Bong-Gu seemed a little embarrassed. He quickly changed the subject, \u201cWhen I return to the guild, I won\u2019t forget to tell the guild master that you saved us, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cHaha, I would appreciate that,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu with a laugh before adding, \u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dAll the Cain Guild members were doing well with their hunt, so Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t feel the necessity to continue this meaningless conversation. Then, suddenly realizing what he was doing, Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly and thought, \u2018I guess I forgot all of my basic social skills.\u2019The non-bearded him of the past would\u2019ve continued this mundane chat for a while before broaching the main subject. But now, he felt too impatient.\u201cWhat happened to\u2026 What is he called? The masked player? That whole deal about the masked ranker. What\u2019s going on with that? Are the reporters still surrounding the Tower?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d The topic excited Do Bong-Gu; he replied, \u201cNo! There was a huge incident regarding that.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu had no idea what he was talking about. When Gi-Gyu looked confused, he explained, \u201cThe association made another public statement that they couldn\u2019t reveal the masked player\u2019s identity. So all the reporters went home!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t comprehend what he had just heard. All those persistent reporters left just because the association made another official statement? Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion, Do Bong-Gu grinned. He continued, looking far too eager, \u201cThey left because the association president personally made the announcement!\u201dGi-Gyu blinked in shock.***\u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026 The association president, who never made a public appearance until now, spoke on TV? He said he couldn\u2019t release any information on the masked player without his permission? And he asked everyone to quash their interest in that player? That\u2019s what you\u2019re telling me, right? Then he also announced various new policies concerning the association to redirect all the attention.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu summarized what he had just heard, Do Bong-Gu nodded emphatically and replied, \u201cYes! I know the new policies are important too, but this was the first time the association president made a public appearance! Everyone was so shocked! Outside the Tower, the association president is now the talk of the town! People have just forgotten about the masked player!\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s face turned awkward.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019Sometime back, Tae-Gu confidently promised Gi-Gyu he would take care of this situation. However, Gi-Gyu never expected him to reveal his identity to the world for that. Overall, the association president did manage to divert the world\u2019s attention by revealing his identity; thus, he kept his promise.\u2018Or maybe, he planned on revealing his identity anyway, and he just happened to find the perfect timing.\u2019Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t naive enough to believe that Oh Tae-Gu, the association president, did this just for him. He was certain that this event had something to do with Oh Tae-Gu\u2019s plan to clean out his organization and begin reforming it.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cSo, I\u2019m not indebted to the president.\u201d After all, he was an association merc, and it was the association\u2019s responsibility to take care of him. This line of thinking helped Gi-Gyu feel much more at ease.\u201cPardon?\u201d Do Bong-Gu probably thought Gi-Gyu said something to him, but Gi-Gyu just shook his head and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u2018They have hunted enough. Time to go.\u2019Gi-Gyu got the information he wanted, so he was ready to leave. But suddenly, his senses alerted him of something, and he said to Do Bong-Gu, \u201cPlease gather all of your guild members immediately.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI can sense numerous players approaching our location; I think they are red players,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied grimly. The aura he picked up was similar to what those red players had.Do Bong-Gu shouted, \u201cGet ready for battle! Quickly deal with the remaining monsters as a team and\u2014\u201d His words were stuck in his throat because Gi-Gyu was rapidly cutting down the monster population there. It only took a moment, and Do Bong-Gu couldn\u2019t hide how impressed he was.\u2018He\u2019s so powerful.\u2019\u00a0From what happened earlier,\u00a0Do Bong-Gu could tell how strong Gi-Gyu was.\u2018Player Kim Gi-Gyu might be even stronger than our guild master\u2014\u2019Do Bong-Gu never got the chance to finish that thought since he saw several red players rushing toward them, screaming, \u201cThey\u2019re here! Those bastards!\u201dDo Bong-Gu calmly took out his emergency flare gun and shot it into the sky. The blue and black smoke quickly spread high up. If the guild member he sent away earlier had reported their situation, their guild should\u2019ve sent additional support to this floor by now. And if they saw this flare, they would come here rushing.\u2018And with Player Kim Gi-Gyu, we can survive till then.\u2019\u00a0Do Bong-Gu reassured himself. Even though Gi-Gyu was a powerful player, there was no way he could deal with all of these red players. So, he put his hope of survival on the en-route Cain Guild support team.The Cain Guild members gathered in one place, and the red players the Smurf Guild brought surrounded them. Gi-Gyu could tell these red players usually hunted on the floors above the 30th from their aura.One of the bigger red players, a bald guy, stepped forward and asked, \u201cDid you assholes kill one of ours?\u201dGi-Gyu, busy gathering the Cain Guild members before, stepped forward and replied, \u201cNot these guys. I killed him.\u201d\u201cHuh! You bastard! Are you some kind of philosopher? Nahhh. You a hobo?\u201d The bald player asked rudely.Gi-Gyu just studied the Smurf Guild members standing nearby; then, he recognized one.\u201cHuh?! You\u2019re\u2026!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed.\u201cWhat? Do you know me?\u201d When the Smurf member asked, Gi-Gyu grinned. Gi-Gyu had been wondering if he would ever see this guy again. He tried to steal Gi-Gyu\u2019s crystal bags back then. Gi-Gyu remembered the day very well. He had just heard his mother\u2019s diagnosis and was depressed, so he locked himself in the Tower for a long time and hunted mindlessly. When he was finally leaving the Tower with his crystal-filled bags, he faced some thieves.The same guy who tried to rob him was now trying to kill him. Gi-Gyu smiled and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re the thief from that day, aren\u2019t you?\u201dAt the time, this thief warned that he would get Gi-Gyu later, but he failed to recognize Gi-Gyu due to the drastic change in his appearance.The Smurf Guild member replied, \u201cWhat the heck are you talking about? We\u2019re\u201d\u2014the other red players chuckled\u2014\"all thieves and murderers.\u201dIgnoring their laughs, Do Bong-Gu announced, \u201cWe\u2019re the Cain Guild! Our reinforcements are nearby, and they would\u2019ve seen our flare by now. They must be on their way, so if you leave us now, you can avoid an unnecessary battle.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, I'm so scared!\u201d the bald player gasped mockingly before leering. Gi-Gyu knew why the red players were so confident right now. Before the bald player could reply, Gi-Gyu explained the situation to Do Bong-Gu.\u201cWe are surrounded by red players right now. It will be too late for us by the time our reinforcement arrives. Is there a war I don\u2019t know about between the Cain Guild and those people?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Do Bong-Gu.\u2018Something doesn\u2019t add up.\u2019The red players acted as if they wanted to go to war with the Cain Guild. Or did someone hire the Smurf Guild to kill the Cain Guild members here?\u201cLet\u2019s just beat them up first and ask questions later,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced.\u201cPardon?\u201d Do Bong-Gu asked in confusion, but Gi-Gyu just murmured, \u201cAccelerate.\u201d\u201cThere are some women here too! It\u2019s so hard to find women inside the Tower. This is just perfect! Kill everyone except for the wome\u2014\u201d The bald player was giving out his order when a stupid expression appeared on his face. He was looking ahead, but he could somehow see the shock on his fellow red players\u2019 faces: They were standing behind him. And while he was learning that his voice no longer obeyed him, a whisper entered his ear, \u201cLet\u2019s not touch the women, okay? Didn\u2019t your mother teach you anything?\u201dTo everyone\u2019s shock, the bald player\u2019s head was rolling on the ground. However, the other red players didn\u2019t run this time. One of them shouted angrily, \u201cKill them! We won\u2019t fall for this again! Our guild members are surrounding this area! Kill that crazy bastard!\u201dGi-Gyu scratched his head with Lou\u2019s handle and murmured, \u201cI guess they aren\u2019t going to run this time.\u201d He thought that if he killed the one who looked like their leader, the others would scatter like the last time again; Gi-Gyu was mistaken.However, Gi-Gyu\u2019s entire victory strategy didn\u2019t depend on that. He killed the strongest of them just now, so it was just a matter of time before he took care of them all.Do Bong-Gu, encouraged by Gi-Gyu\u2019s show of power, ordered, \u201cCain Guild! It\u2019s time to fight! Kill all the red players!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201dThere was no way to escape this battle now. More importantly, they had no reason to run. The Cain Guild members looked toward Gi-Gyu, the bearded, dirty-looking player. This unexpectedly powerful man had proven himself to be a friend of their guild master.With Gi-Gyu by their side, the Cain Guild members felt confident they could survive this fight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58. Cain Guild (3)Before long, both sides were locking horns. Cain Guild\u2019s side had 30 members, and the Smurf Guild had 50 red players. Unlike before, the Cain Guild members were now aggressively attacking the red players. They threw caution to the wind, ignored defense, and just clashed with the red players.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned unhappily. His senses just picked up another set of auras; he couldn\u2019t tell how many people were rushing here, just that they were too many. They could be Cain Guild\u2019s reinforcements, more foes, or both.If Gi-Gyu were alone, he could\u2019ve somehow escaped. But unfortunately, he was with other players he needed to protect.\u2018If they didn\u2019t belong to Suk-Woo\u2019s guild, I wouldn\u2019t have to care as much.\u2019Gi-Gyu felt it was his duty to help the Cain Guild members escape to the best of his abilities.Slash!Even while his brain was focused on the alien auras, Gi-Gyu indifferently swung Lou in a beautiful arc.\u201cDammit! My arm! My armmmm!!!\u201d a red player screamed as his arm fell to the ground. Blood spewing from his stump, the injured player began crawling toward his amputated arm.Slice.Without hesitation, Gi-Gyu swung El, and the injured red player stopped screaming.Boom!Some player used their explosion skill to rock the entire battlefield; the chaotic battle continued as the insane red players screamed, \u201cHehehe!!!!! Kill them! Kill them\u00a0all!!![a]\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll destroy all of them!\u201dRed players usually had a criminal record, so they took refuge inside the Tower. These villains lived inside the lawless Tower, committed murders, and sustained themselves with thievery. In summary, red players were humans without humanity.Throb.\u201cI knew it.\u201d Gi-Gyu touched his right eye after taking a timeout from the battle. \u201cI guess I was right about this.\u201dThere was one more reason Gi-Gyu got involved in this fight: He wanted to confirm his suspicions regarding Lucifer\u2019s gift. He first felt this throbbing sensation when he killed Choi Won-Jae.\u2018So the power Lucifer gave me gets activated when I kill a person.\u2019Thanks to this battle, Gi-Gyu confirmed what he had been thinking all along. He didn\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t activate earlier when he killed the other red player. But the important thing now was that his right eye was throbbing. And without even checking in the mirror, he knew his right eye had turned violet.And now, he didn\u2019t have to turn to know that someone was attacking his back. He didn\u2019t even have to worry about the attack; he just let his body absorb it. Then, he nonchalantly turned and swung Lou and El simultaneously.Slice, slice, slice!Three slashing sounds rang in the area before Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cReflect.\u201dKaboom!He purposely took the damage from that attack to use Reflect. The skill\u2019s destructive power was comparable to the explosions created by the mage category players.\u201cD-dammit!\u201d the red players stammered after witnessing Gi-Gyu\u2019s power. Although these criminals were maniacs, they had terrific instincts.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s probably why they know to run when they face true danger.\u201d He pushed back his blood-soaked hair and smiled brightly. Currently, his sclera was a perfect violet color, and his strength, speed, perception, etc., were peaking.Gi-Gyu announced to his enemies respectfully, \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s hurry this up, shall we?\u201d***The perfect word to describe the battle scene was hell. What had happened on the 29th floor was only possible inside the Tower. Human corpses covered almost every inch of the area where the battle took place.The remaining red players began to back away as they muttered, \u201cW-we can\u2019t win this\u2026\u201d\u201cDammit! We were never told the Cain Guild was this strong!\u201d\u201cHey! Why did our guild master order this?!\u201dThere were almost 50 of them when the battle first began, but only five were left alive now. They had truly lost their minds because they were still smirking while simultaneously wetting their lips.In front of this group of five, one man stood quietly. Messy beard and whole body soaked in blood, it was Gi-Gyu.\u201cYou can\u2019t run,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced as he slowly walked toward one of them. It was time to end them.\u201cHehehe,\u201d one red player died while laughing.\u201cP-please spare me!\u201d another one died while begging for his life.Suddenly, Do Bong-Gu whispered nearby, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu, your eye\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing. Please don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d When Gi-Gyu reassured him, Do Bong-Gu stammered in fear, \u201cI-I think it would be best to take the rest of them out for questioning.\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for Gi-Gyu, all the Cain Guild members would\u2019ve died instead of the red players. So, Do Bong-Gu was thankful that Gi-Gyu was on their side.Gi-Gyu shook his head and replied drily, \u201cThere will be more than enough captives later to interrogate.\u201d \u00a0Without waiting for an answer, Gi-Gyu stolidly killed the rest of the red players. As the pleas for mercy and the cries of pain died down, an awkward silence fell in the area.\u201c...\u201d Do Bong-Gu remained quiet, partly from the excitement of the battle, mostly from remembering how Gi-Gyu fought. None of the Cain Guild members could see Gi-Gyu as a human anymore.Gi-Gyu ended the silence by making an announcement.\u201cThe next batch is nearby.\u201dNod.Do Bong-Gu nodded in understanding. He wasn\u2019t a high-level player, but even he could feel the incoming force\u2019s overwhelming aura. The Cain Guild members quickly drank their potions and checked on their weapons.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201dAn overwhelming bloodthirsty aura began to swarm them at an alarming speed. The red players\u2019 reinforcements were seemingly aware of the massacre that ended their brothers. The murderous aura surrounded the Cain Guild members and Gi-Gyu like a thick fog.\u201cT-this feels like\u2026\u201d Do Bong-Gu whispered in shock.\u201cThis can\u2019t be! No way!\u201d another member of the Cain Guild screamed fearfully.Even Gi-Gyu sounded frustrated as he murmured, \u201cThere are at least 300 of them.\u201dDo Bong-Gu replied, \u201cI- I think it\u2019s the entire Smurf Guild.\u201d There were many red players in the Tower, but the Smurf Guild only housed about 300 of them. So, it felt like the entire guild decided to join the fray.\u2018And one of them feels very strong.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought, guessing that it had to be the Smurf Guild\u2019s master himself. As the aura of the guild master and his 300 players weighted down on Gi-Gyu\u2019s senses, he felt himself sweat a little.-Please don\u2019t worry, Master! I\u2019ll protect you!!!When Brunheart announced in a cheerful voice, Gi-Gyu felt much calmer. He replied with a grin, \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d Finally, he realized that cowering in fear was never an option since his goal was to destroy a bigger guild than the Smurf Guild.Gi-Gyu promised himself that someday, he would kill every member of the Iron Guild.A sharp-looking man, obviously the most powerful among all the red players, stepped forward and asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cAre you the one who killed my boys?\u201d\u201cSlaughterer Choi Min-Suk,\u201d Do Bong-Gu murmured.Slaughterer Choi Min-Suk was a ranker who was notoriously vicious. One day, he entered the Tower and formed a guild only of and for red players\u2014the Smurf Guild.Gi-Gyu replied mockingly, \u201cYes, Sir. I did indeed.\u201d\u201cFunny guy, huh?\u201d Choi Min-Suk laughed.This whole situation seemed to amuse the guild master. With a nonchalant attitude, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cMay I ask you something?\u201dThe Smurf Guild players had surrounded the area, and even the floor monsters were regenerating. The Cain Guild members\u2019 situation was dire, yet Gi-Gyu was calm. Choi Min-Suk looked at him with interest as he replied, \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d\u201cWhat did these members of the Cain Guild do to you for you to bring your entire guild here?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Choi Min-Suk tilted his head in amusement before mumbling, \u201cShall I tell him?\u201dThe Smurf Guild members standing around their master watched with worry. Gi-Gyu suspected the ones closest to the guild master were the guild executives. Although they seemed concerned, they didn\u2019t make a sound. It was clear they obeyed Choi Min-Suk without question.And after a few minutes, Choi Min-Suk answered, \u201cWe, the Smurf Guild, plan on leaving the Tower. And to do this, we need these Cain Guild members.\u201dGi-Gyu and all the Cain Guild players\u2019 faces crumpled in a fury.***The red players were allowed to live only inside the Tower. Society allowed this because the Tower was completely separate from the public. And this meant that these criminals were not allowed to leave the Tower and re-enter the world.The association maintained all the portals that led to the Tower. So, even if these criminals could somehow enter the Tower after committing a crime, they could never leave this place.So how was Choi Min-Suk going to take his men out? And what did this have anything to do with the Cain Guild members? Do Bong-Gu and the rest couldn\u2019t understand this.But Gi-Gyu could guess Choi Min-Suk\u2019s plan. His face now blank again, Gi-Gyu glared at the Smurf Guild master and asked, \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026! You\u2019re a fascinating guy indeed.\u201d Choi Min-Suk looked mildly surprised as he asked, \u201cSo you know about it too?\u201d\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s demanded an answer in a cold voice. Choi Min-Suk replied, \u201cWe captured and killed one of the Cain Guild executives. Fortunately for us, he told us all about it. He said\u2014\u201dBefore Choi Min-Suk could finish his reply, Gi-Gyu ran toward him and shouted, \u201cStop it!\u201dThere were 300 players ready to protect their guild master, so it was very reckless of Gi-Gyu to dash toward their leader. And that was after you ignored that Choi Min-Suk was a famous ranker in his days.The Smurf Guild master quickly took out his dagger and blocked Lou and El. He offered leisurely, \u201cYou should join us. I\u2019m willing to give you the deputy guild master position.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu took a step back and spat out the words, \u201cI would never join your stupid guild.\u201dGi-Gyu positioned himself for the battle. He had been fighting impetuously till then; now, he had a strong motivation to kill the man before him. Choi Min-Suk also changed his position as he murmured, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you just don\u2019t know or are pretending not to know.\u201dBefore Choi Min-Suk was nicknamed \u201cslaughterer,\u201d he was a famous player assassin. Holding two daggers in his hands now, the Smurf Guild master blocked Gi-Gyu\u2019s attack again.Clank!Everyone around them also took out their weapons.Gulp.Do Bong-Gu and the rest of the Cain Guild members gulped loudly and prepared themselves for another battle. Treating the intense fight as a breeze, Choi Min-Suk commented, \u201cI can feel it. You\u2019re definitely one of us. You\u2019re our kind.\u201dChoi Min-Suk\u2019s daggers glowed bright red\u2014it was the slaughterer\u2019s notorious skill called the Flame Dagger. This very skill was responsible for Choi Min-Suk\u2019s gruesome nickname. The burning heat from the dagger was enough to melt the thickest steel.\u201cShut up!\u201d Gi-Gyu screamed as he swung Lou and El against Choi Min-Suk\u2019s hot daggers.Kaboom!The loud explosion acted as a battle cry; the Smurf Guild players began to move as they screamed, \u201cKill them all!\u201dThe Smurf players circled Choi Min-Suk and Gi-Gyu and headed toward the Cain Guild members. The Cain players raised their weapons, looking pale, knowing this might be their end.\u201cIce Volt!\u201d shouted the Cain Guild\u2019s mage players. To this, the Smurf mage players screamed their skill, \u201cFireball!\u201dBoom, boom, boom!More screams and shouts followed.\u201cForce!\u201d\u201cIron wall!\u201dThe sounds of the swords and shields clashing rang throughout the forest.\u201cHehehe\u2026 you\u2019re enjoying yourself, aren\u2019t you? I can tell.\u201d Choi Min-Suk smirked at Gi-Gyu as he waved his daggers. The heat from his weapons burned Gi-Gyu\u2019s flesh each time Lou and El clashed with his daggers.Choi Min-Suk, attacking at lightning speed, murmured, \u201cYou have amazing swords. I haven\u2019t seen many items that could withstand my flame daggers\u2019 heat.\u201dAccelerate was the only reason Gi-Gyu managed to keep up with Choi Min-Suk. He wasn\u2019t known for his strength, but his flame daggers made up for it. And his speed was comparable to that of high-level rankers. Compared to Gi-Gyu\u2019s fight with Choi Won-Jae, this battle was in a league of its own.\u201cI told you to shut up!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled as he blocked the daggers with Lou. At that moment, Gi-Gyu\u2019s speed peaked, and Choi Min-Suk failed to dodge El\u2019s slash aiming for his leg.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about me. I\u2019m nothing like you, you psycho killer!\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured, knowing Choi Min-Suk could hear everything despite the loud noises surrounding them. Suddenly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest shone blindingly, and he said, \u201cEver heard of chalk and cheese?\u201dWith that, Gi-Gyu began laughing. One big thing that made the flame dagger so threatening was its ability to deal continuously heat damage. Of course, Gi-Gyu had Brunheart, who could accumulate such damage and reflect it.When blood-red heat began to spew from Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest, Choi Min-Suk stammered, \u201cW-what the!\u201d The Smurf Guild master tried to back away, but Lou grazed his neck before he could.\u201cW-what is happening\u2026?!\u201d Before Choi Min-Suk could even finish his sentence, Lou punctured his neck like a hot knife cutting butter. And the heat bursting from Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest began to melt Choi Min-Suk slowly.Throb.At that very moment, Gi-Gyu\u2019s right eye turned an even darker shade of violet.[a]Even if the raws have excessive punctuation, let\u2019s just leave at triple maximum.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59. Cain Guild (4)[Cannibalism has been activated.][Player Choi Min-Suk is being egofied.][Egofication has been completed successfully.]\u201cIt worked?\u201d Gi-Gyu was surprised by the system announcements. He watched Choi Min-Suk disappear slowly, but he didn\u2019t get the time to mull over it since the battle was still ongoing.When the Smurf Guild members realized Choi Min-Suk was dead, they screamed, \u201cOur guild master is dead!\u201d\u201cDammit! Kill everyone!\u201dThe Smurf red players were more excited than shocked by their leader\u2019s death. When Gi-Gyu looked around, he noticed that this excitement had already killed a few Cain members. Currently, Gi-Gyu stood alone in the middle of the battlefield with the Smurf executives closing on him.One of the enemies murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he killed our guild master.\u201dBut there wasn\u2019t fear in that murmur\u2014it had joy. Instead of being afraid, they were a bit tense at best. Several Smurf members announced, \u201cThe guild master\u2019s position is now open!!!\u201d Were they tense due to Gi-Gyu or the competition for that seat? Overall, every red player there was interested in becoming the new leader.\u201cWhoever kills that bastard gets to be the new guild master. Do you all agree?\u201d When one Smurf player suggested, the rest shouted, \u201cYes!\u201dEven as his muscles tensed, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his bitter smile. His whole body was throbbing painfully. To charge Brunheart, he baited Choi Min-Suk with everything he had; as an aftereffect, he suffered a lot of fire damage. Now, every corner of his body was screaming in pain, his right vision was blurrier, and he was feeling dizzy.\u201cKill him!\u201d yelled one of the Smurf executive members.\u201cBlizzard!\u201dGi-Gyu was about to defend himself when an ice magic spell suddenly covered the area. The temperature plummeted, slowing down the red players and easing Gi-Gyu\u2019s burns a little.\u201cOur reinforcement is finally here!\u201d one of the Cain Guild members yelled.\u201cOur guild master came in person to save us!\u201d another Cain player screamed in relief.\u201cWe\u2019re alive! We\u2019re saved!\u201d Several Cain members cheered together. Gi-Gyu looked up to find a player floating in the air while moving his hands to control the ice skill. Gi-Gyu murmured in annoyance, \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dYoo Suk-Woo, Gi-Gyu\u2019s friend and Cain Guild\u2019s guild master, was looking down at him. Just then, Gi-Gyu heard a system announcement.[Strong will has been activated.]Just like his friend, Gi-Gyu\u2019s skill was also late in its arrival.***Yoo Suk-Woo didn\u2019t come alone: He brought 50 of his elite guild members with him. And just those 50 were more than enough to eliminate the entire Smurf Guild. People could concoct stuff like \u201cgood always triumphs over evil\u201d to justify the previous statement. However, Gi-Gyu knew the truth. The Cain Guild's power was beyond what the red players could ever dream of as a group. The Smurf Guild was the weakest red player guild, so it couldn\u2019t pose a problem to a top-tier organization like the Cain Guild.Suk-Woo came down to Gi-Gyu and asked, \u201cWhat the heck happened here? And is that really you, Gi-Gyu? Why do you look so different? What happened to your eye?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied calmly, Suk-Woo landed next to him.Yoo Suk-Woo was a high-level ranker of the mage category. However, Suk-Woo had countless skills and incredible magical power, so everyone believed he had the potential to become a high ranker.\u2018And I agree.\u2019Gi-Gyu believed that Suk-Woo had unlimited potential as a player. With this thought, Gi-Gyu asked Suk-Woo, \u201cHow did Choi Min-Suk discover your secret?\u201d\u201cAh, so you really are Gi-Gyu.\u201dOnly a few people in the world knew Suk-Woo\u2019s secret. Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cThat\u2019s why the Smurf Guild targeted your guild members. I think they were going to take them as hostages and use them as leverage to negotiate with you.\u201dYoo Suk-Woo\u2019s face crumpled into an ugly frown. He replied, \u201cI see. Thankfully, everything turned out okay in the end. I received a report that my guild members were fighting the Smurf Guild\u2019s red players with you. So I brought all of my elite players to help.\u201dThen, Suk-Woo gave Gi-Gyu a small smile. Meanwhile, the battle was winding down around them. Most red players were still resisting, so the elite players had to kill them. Those who surrendered and let themselves be bound peacefully were left alive.Suk-Woo asked his man in charge of the red player hostages, \u201cWhat\u2019s our damages?\u201d\u201cFive dead, and the rest have severe injuries.\u201dSuk-Woo and Gi-Gyu approached Do Bong-Gu\u2019s group to assess them. They were lying on the ground, and the healers were bustling around to treat them, but most had suffered injuries far too severe for elementary treatment.\u201cG-guild master\u2026\u201d Do Bong-Gu stammered as he tried to stand; unfortunately, his body didn\u2019t comply. Gi-Gyu gazed at Do Bong-Gu\u2019s left leg: A very sharp weapon had amputated it. He looked around to see if he could find the guide\u2019s leg, but he couldn\u2019t find it in all the many limbs spread around the area.Suddenly, Yoo Suk-Woo shouted, \u201cSearch!\u201d A blue light appeared on Do Bong-Gu\u2019s amputation site before flying to a pile of body parts far away. Then, it stopped above a limb that appeared to be Do Bong-Gu\u2019s amputated leg.Suk-Woo announced, \u201cGood. You'll be fine if you get the healer to work on that leg right now.\u201d\u201cT-thank you. Thank you so much, Guild Master.\u201d Do Bong-Gu bowed over and over again as he murmured. He could\u2019ve lost his leg permanently if it wasn\u2019t for Suk-Woo, so it was no wonder the guide felt grateful.Gi-Gyu asked Suk-Woo, \u201cIs that a new skill?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d Suk-Woo answered nonchalantly before thanking Gi-Gyu, \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cThanks to you, most of my guild members are still alive, and we managed to avoid trouble. If the Smurf Guild took my players as hostages, things would\u2019ve turned out badly,\" Suk-Woo explained.\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s true.\u201d Gi-Gyu suspected Choi Min-Suk planned on using the Cain Guild members as hostages to make a deal with Suk-Woo. If Gi-Gyu hadn\u2019t gotten involved, Choi Min-Suk would\u2019ve probably gotten what he wished. He would\u2019ve tortured the Cain Guild members, and Suk-Woo would\u2019ve caved in eventually.\u2018Because I know Suk-Woo cares about his people.\u2019Thanks to Gi-Gyu, Do Bong-Gu\u2019s party survived until the reinforcements arrived. And they were also able to annihilate the Smurf Guild.Suk-Woo and Gi-Gyu hugged each other. Suk-Woo murmured, \u201cIt has been way too long.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dAfter learning about the deaths of five comrades, they couldn\u2019t smile, but both Suk-Woo and Gi-Gyu were genuinely happy to see each other. After Suk-Woo created his guild and Gi-Gyu began getting stronger, they hadn\u2019t had the chance to meet for a long time. However, something unfortunate like this had finally brought them together.Suk-Woo watched his guild members before telling Gi-Gyu, \u201cLet\u2019s talk later.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and replied, \u201cQuestion the surviving red players and then hand them over to the association.\u201dKilling anyone registered as a red player was legal inside the Tower. The association even offered many rewards and benefits for bringing in alive red players. Since killing captured and defenseless red players were just amoral, giving them to the association was the best option.But before that, Suk-Woo needed to do his own questioning. Gi-Gyu suggested, \u201cWho knows how many people Choi Min-Suk told about your secret? You better make sure none of the surviving red players know.\u201d\u201cAll right. Thanks again.\u201d Suk-Woo nodded gratefully before adding, \u201cWell, let\u2019s clean up here and get out of the Tower.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dThe Cain Guild members had already initiated the cleanup, so Gi-Gyu and Suk-Woo joined them after their quick chat.***On the 29th floor, association agents could be found near the portal. Even though a large-scale battle involving the red players took place just a moment ago, the portal was deathly quiet as if nothing had happened.It made sense because the portal was considered a safe zone. Although the association agents protected this area, only a limited number of them were present on this floor. The Tower floors became bigger the higher one went, so the association agents couldn\u2019t protect and control the entire Tower.Also, electric devices didn\u2019t work inside the Tower, so firecrackers and flares were the only way to communicate. Guilds and individual players had to protect themselves independently on the higher floors. It was especially true for floors above the 20th since most red players lived there.Gi-Gyu and Suk-Woo handed the captured red players to the association agents and left the Tower. The association also helped them get the injured to safety.Gi-Gyu murmured to Suk-Woo, \u201cThankfully, only Choi Min-Suk and a few dead executives knew about your secret.\u201dAfter questioning the surviving red players, they drew this conclusion. Choi Min-Suk kept his reason for targeting the Cain Guild a tight secret. Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cBut don\u2019t let your guard down. Once a secret gets out, it\u2019s no longer a secret.\u201d\u201cYeah, thanks for your advice.\u201d Suk-Woo nodded.When they finally left the Tower, Gi-Gyu watched the people around him and exclaimed, \u201cUwaah! It feels so great to be out and back in the world.\u201d\u201cGosh, you look so awful. We need to talk about what happened to you,\u201d Suk-Woo replied with his face looking a little brighter. Several of his guild members died or were severely injured, but this was actually the best-case scenario. Also, players accepted death and departure facilely since it had become a part of their lives.Gi-Gyu proposed, \u201cWould you like to see Tae-Shik hyung before leaving?\u201d\u201cAh! I heard Tae-Shik hyung became the general manager!\u201d Gi-Gyu had introduced Suk-Woo to Tae-Shik a long time ago, so they met a few times together in the past.After asking Suk-Woo to wait a moment, Gi-Gyu went to the shower room inside the association building. After a quick wash and shave, he changed into a set of clean clothes he stored in the association locker assigned to him.When Gi-Gyu returned, Suk-Woo asked, \u201cUmm, who are you?\u201d It seemed that Suk-Woo genuinely didn\u2019t recognize Gi-Gyu.\u201cWhat? What the heck are you talking about? Stop joking around,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a frown.\u201cW-what?! Could it be\u2026\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cAre you Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d Suk-Woo stammered in shock, \u201cT-this is crazy. I wouldn\u2019t have even recognized you if not for your right eye color! What\u2019s going?!\u201d\u201cStop this nonsense. Let\u2019s just go see Tae-Shik hyung now.\u201d Gi-Gyu tried to change the subject. He knew how different he looked now since even he felt awkward every time he looked in the mirror.Even as they walked to Tae-Shik\u2019s office, Suk-Woo couldn\u2019t get used to Gi-Gyu\u2019s new appearance. He whispered, \u201cT-this is just crazy!\u201d***\u201cSo you killed Choi Min-Suk and destroyed the Smurf Guild?\u201d Tae-Shik gaped in shock.\u201cYeah, it just happened. I was just gonna save the Cain Guild members, but things got out of control and\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu answered as he scratched his head shyly. Both Tae-Shik and Suk-Woo couldn\u2019t hide their disbelief.Tae-Shik argued, \u201cHow are you so calm after killing a red player guild\u2019s guild master? And what the hell happened to your eye?\u201d\u201cHyung, how did Gi-Gyu change so much?\u201d Suk-Woo asked Tae-Shik, realizing that Gi-Gyu would never give him a straight answer. Tae-Shik shook his head and replied, \u201cHaa\u2026 It\u2019s a long story.\u201dTae-Shik wasn\u2019t sure if Suk-Woo would believe him even if he told the full story. When Tae-Shik hesitated, Suk-Woo continued, \u201cI mean, I just can\u2019t believe how much Gi-Gyu has changed. I remember you being so stressed because you couldn't level up, but now\u2026 I did hear from Sun-Pil that Gi-Gyu became really strong, but to be honest, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. Yet for you to have killed Choi Min-Suk so easily\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right! You\u2019re Sun-Pil\u2019s cousin, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Trying to change the subject again, Gi-Gyu asked. Suk-Woo replied, \u201cWhat? That\u2019s not the point here.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Did you boys eat yet?\u201d Tae-Shik asked with a sigh.\u201cNo, I told you we just left the Tower,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu.\u201cI know you stayed inside the Tower for over a week. How about you, Suk-Woo?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten either.\u201d When Suk-Woo replied, Tae-Shik stood up and announced, \u201cWell then, we should get some food. We can talk while we eat.\u201dTae-Shik was a stress eater. Given how much he was insisting on food, it was obvious he was extremely stressed. So, Suk-Woo and Tae-Shik led the way while Gi-Gyu followed.\u201cIt\u2019s so nice having dinner with you two.\u201d When Gi-Gyu announced with a bright, innocent smile, both Suk-Woo and Tae-Shik shook their heads and sighed.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d***\u201cI\u2019m losing sleep because of you, Gi-Gyu.\u201d When Tae-Shik grumbled, Gi-Gyu argued back, \u201cHow is that my fault!\u201d\u201cGosh, you\u2019re such a brat.\u201dTae-Shik, Gi-Gyu, and Suk-Woo were sitting inside a soondae[1]\u00a0soup restaurant near the association building Tae-Shik frequented. The trio often came here in the past, so it reminded them of many fun memories.Tae-Shik shook his head again in disbelief as he stated, \u201cYou suddenly went inside the Tower and didn\u2019t come out for days. And now you\u2019re telling me\u2026\u201dTae-Shik paused before mimicking\u00a0Gi-Gyu\u2019s voice.\u201cHyung! I fought the Smurf Guild! And when I hit Ranker Choi Min-Suk a few times, he just died! And I also killed many of his guild members too! But in the process, I saved Suk-Woo\u2019s guild members! Aren\u2019t you proud of me?!\u201dSlamming down on the table in frustration, Tae-Shik asked, \u201cIs that it, you jerk?! Is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d When Tae-Shik sighed, Gi-Gyu argued, \u201cBut they are such parasites. You know better than anyone how many innocent players die every year because of red players, Hyung. And like you said, Suk-Woo\u2019s guild members were in danger!\u201dTae-Shik sighed again. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not frustrated because you killed them.\u201d\u201cI do. I know what you\u2019re worried about, Hyung.\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s eyes turned serious as he muttered, \u201cAs I've said before, the problem is whether you can control yourself.\u201dGi-Gyu blurted, \u201cAnd like I said before, the real problem is whether I\u00a0need\u00a0to control it.\u201dSuk-Woo sighed while watching Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik arguing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60. Cain Guild (5)Gi-Gyu and Tae-Shik glared at each other for a while before Tae-Shik gave in.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure you have a handle on this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t carry around a handle,\u201d Gi-Gyu joked.\u201cHuh?\u201d When Tae-Shik seemed confused, Gi-Gyu laughed and asked, \u201cHaha, handle on what?\u201d\u201cAre you confident that you won\u2019t\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik trailed off, unable to say the words. Frustrated, Gi-Gyu tilted his head and prodded, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dTae-Shik didn\u2019t reply; it looked like he was trying to think of the right word. Finally, he asked, \u201cAre you confident that you won\u2019t turn into an animal?\u201d\u201cYes, that will never happen.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied promptly, Tae-Shik replied, \u201cAll right then.\u201dA short silence fell. Before long, their three bowls of soondae[1]\u00a0soup arrived, and the meal began rather tensely. Thankfully, Suk-Woo cleared the air with a generic compliment.\u201cWow\u2026 This is so delicious! You have no idea how much I missed this. I would love to come here from time to time to eat, but I\u2019ve been way too busy lately.\u201d\u201cAre you still that busy?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu; he had already finished his bowl.\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m actually busier than ever nowadays.\u201d When Suk-Woo replied, Tae-Shik asked, \u201cGi-Gyu, haven\u2019t you heard?\u201dGi-Gyu looked confused as Tae-Shik continued, \u201cThe Cain Guild recently became one of the top ten guilds in Korea. After the Phoenix guild disbanded, the Cain Guild took its place. So it\u2019s no wonder Suk-Woo is crazy busy.\u201dFwah!Gi-Gyu was drinking water; he spat it in shock. He asked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah\u2026 It just kind of happened.\u201d Suk-Woo looked away shyly.Suk-Woo\u2019s guild didn\u2019t\u00a0get\u00a0this prestigious spot\u2014they\u00a0took\u00a0it. What Gi-Gyu did certainly helped, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason. Since the Phoenix Guild getting disbanded was partly Gi-Gyu\u2019s fault, he was pleased with how things turned out for his friend.Gi-Gyu congratulated Suk-Woo, \u201cThis is a big deal. Being in the top ten guilds of Korea is quite an accomplishment. Congratulations!\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dNoticing that Tae-Shik was still eating, Gi-Gyu took another sip of water. Suk-Woo suddenly asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it? I can tell now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied Gi-Gyu as he took another sip.\u201cThe masked ranker. It\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFwahh!Gi-Gyu spat his water for a second time today; although Tae-Shik managed to evade the spray, his bowl didn\u2019t. His bowl now drenched in Gi-Gyu\u2019s spit, Tae-Shik muttered in annoyance, \u201cAhh\u2026 Dammit!\u201dMeanwhile, Gi-Gyu had no time to apologize to Tae-Shik. He stammered, \u201cN-no, I\u2019m not!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to me. It\u2019s so obvious that it\u2019s you. Don\u2019t underestimate a ranker\u2019s eyes.\u201d Suk-Woo shrugged.Embarrassed and awkward, Gi-Gyu looked around anxiously before asking, \u201cIs it really that obvious?\u201d\u201cActually, no, not really. I only figured it out because of your rings. If you want to hide your identity, you should really do something about them.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSpeechless, Gi-Gyu looked down at his hand. Indeed, he was still wearing those noticeable rings from the TV photo. Back when the reporters were crowding around the Tower, he hid them by keeping his hands in his pocket. But now he completely forgot about them, as he hadn\u2019t been in public for quite a while.Suk-Woo was right: Gi-Gyu\u2019s rings were conspicuous. Anyone who saw his photo on TV could probably tell that they were the same.\u2018I need to find a way to hide these.\u2019Gi-Gyu was busy thinking of a solution when Suk-Woo asked, \u201cBy the way, you also became a merc, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat? How did you\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu glanced at Suk-Woo. Surprise had lost its pizzazz on that table. Tae-Shik, who returned after paying for their food, murmured, \u201cYoo Suk-Woo, I told you not to say things like that in public.\u201d\u201cBut I bet all the other mercs have also noticed the ring; they probably already know it\u2019s Gi-Gyu. And you said association mercs don\u2019t have to hide their identity among fellow mercs,\u201d Suk-Woo argued.\u201cGosh, you mercs are so disobedient and annoying. Fine, whatever. Do as you wish,\u201d Tae-Shik muttered and sat down. As soon as Gi-Gyu heard this, he turned toward Suk-Woo and asked, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re a merc too?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d Suk-Woo took out his hand and showed it to Gi-Gyu, but it had no ring.\u201cCancel.\u201d When Suk-Woo used one of his skills, a ring appeared on his finger. It was the same white ring Gi-Gyu received from the association. Suk-Woo explained, \u201cThese rings were custom-made for us, but there is no built-in hide option. So all of us must find our own way to hide it. I mean, look at it. This ring is so noticeable.\u201dIt was kind of Suk-Woo to explain these things to Gi-Gyu. He continued, \u201cAs I said, the other mercs probably also know your identity. But you need to know something: Not all mercs are friendlies. Be careful. And find a way to hide those rings, will you?\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured, still having difficulty processing all the information dumped on him.\u2018Well, this makes sense. Suk-Woo has a huge potential, so no wonder he was hired.\u2019Gi-Gyu could understand why the association chose Suk-Woo. He was a powerful player who quickly became a ranker after receiving the Tower\u2019s invitation. The potential, persistence, and sheer will Suk-Woo possessed were undoubtedly considerable.On top of it all, his substantial leadership skill turned his guild into one of the top ten guilds in Korea. Actually, believing he wasn\u2019t a merc would\u2019ve been harder.Suk-Woo looked down at the shiny watch on his wrist and announced, \u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have much time, so\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry I keep interrupting you,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized. Tae-Shik was listening to Gi-Gyu and Suk-Woo quietly until now, but he also wanted to get to the main topic. Tae-Shik asked, \u201cSo how did Choi Min-Suk find out about your secret skill, Suk-Woo? That bastard said he found out from one of your guild executives, but I thought you didn\u2019t tell anyone in your guild.\u201dChoi Min-Suk targeted the Cain Guild members because he had something on their guild leader. He believed the red players could leave the Tower because of Suk-Woo\u2019s unique ability, which only a handful of people knew. For his own safety, Suk-Woo didn\u2019t go around advertising it. If the wrong people found this secret, players much stronger than Choi Min-Suk would target Suk-Woo.Gi-Gyu whispered, \u201cHow did he find you can create portals?\u201d Tae-Shik already knew this secret, so he wasn\u2019t shocked, but a solemn look appeared in Suk-Woo\u2019s eyes.***Suk-Woo said it was a pure coincidence: An incident forced him into using his unique ability, and one of his executives saw it. Unfortunately, this executive was captured and killed by Choi Min-Suk. Suk-Woo knew of the executive\u2019s death, but he had no idea the Smurf Guild was involved. Thanks to Gi-Gyu, the mystery was solved.Gi-Gyu, Suk-Woo, and Tae-Shik chatted for a while longer before parting ways. Tae-Shik still had work to finish, so he returned to his office while Suk-Woo waited for one of his Guild members to come and pick him up. Since Sung-Hoon was waiting for Gi-Gyu in the association building, Suk-Woo and Gi-Gyu decided to take a short walk together.\u201cWe only talked about me today,\u201d Suk-Woo muttered as they strolled. He asked, \u201cGi-Gyu, what happened?\u201dGi-Gyu had kept quiet about his changes until now. He muttered, \u201cA lot happened in my life too. More than you can ever imagine. There were days when I was weak and helpless, but things happened that allowed me to trounce rankers and become a merc like you.\u201dThe street was quiet. It was very late, so there wasn't anyone out and about. Suk-Woo didn\u2019t respond or prod; he just waited patiently.Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cMy mother is healthy now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Suk-Woo gasped, knowing what Gi-Gyu was saying.\u2018He must\u2019ve found the elixir!\u2019Suk-Woo knew about his mother\u2019s illness and had been doing his best to find a cure, but all roads just led to the elixir. It was an impossible dream, or at least that was what Suk-Woo believed. But he was wrong since Gi-Gyu found the elixir.Gi-Gyu whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve met many people, and I even found a way to become stronger. It\u2019s a long story; unfortunately, I can\u2019t talk about many things right now.\u201dThat was all Gi-Gyu was willing to reveal. He just hinted Suk-Woo about the incredible events that happened in his life.Honk!A black sedan with the Cain Guild\u2019s symbol on its windshield honked at Gi-Gyu and Suk-Woo.\u201cI think my ride is here,\u201d Suk-Woo announced. He was about to walk toward it when Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cHey.\u201dSuk-Woo became tense, as he recognized the intense strain in Gi-Gyu\u2019s voice. He asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu bit his lower lip, unable to hide his discomfort. After what seemed like hours, Gi-Gyu finally opened his mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s your code name?\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s corny code name, Morningstar, had been bothering him since he first heard it. Had Suk-Woo gotten something much cooler, Gi-Gyu planned on protesting to Tae-Gu. But when Suk-Woo turned stiff, Gi-Gyu chuckled.\u201cPfft\u2026 You got a dumb name too, didn\u2019t you?\u201dCautiously, Suk-Woo replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Arok\u2026 You?\u201d\u201cMorningstar.\u201dAn odd silence fell until\u2026\u201cPfft\u2026! Hahaha!\u201dBoth players burst into laughter. They chuckled like kids before parting ways.***After leaving Suk-Woo, Gi-Gyu was on his way home with Sung-Hoon. As he relaxed in the plush passenger seat, fatigue engulfed him. Killing fellow humans instead of monsters was more stressful than he anticipated. Then, Tae-Shik\u2019s question began circling his mind.\u2018Are you confident that you won\u2019t turn into an animal?\u2019Gi-Gyu closed his eyes and smiled.\u2018Yes, that will never happen.\u2019Based on what had happened with the Smurf Guild, he was now certain. When he was killing those red players, he didn\u2019t feel the pleasure he felt before. The guilt also wasn\u2019t there. As he killed those criminals, Gi-Gyu noticed he wasn\u2019t feeling an ounce of hesitation.So, he was now certain that Tae-Shik\u2019s worst-case scenario would never come to pass.\u2018Oh, almost forget that Choi Min-Suk was successfully egofied.\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s current goal was to climb the Tower and learn everything about Egos. He believed learning about Egos and Ego fragments was the key to becoming even stronger.Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cSo you\u2019ve been staying on the 29th floor all this time?\u201dGi-Gyu had already told him the gist of what happened inside the Tower. Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve mostly just been hunting, as I wanted to confirm something.\u201d\u2018Lou.\u2019Lou had still not awakened, and that made Gi-Gyu very nervous. That was a big part of why Gi-Gyu had been hunting mindlessly in the Tower. He found that hunting helps in relieving stress.\u201cEven so, I don\u2019t think spending all of your time hunting is a good idea, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. I know you\u2019re a powerful player, but you must remember that you\u2019re human first.\u201d Sung-Hoon glanced at Gi-Gyu with worry as he continued, \u201cI hope you learn to enjoy your life.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Gi-Gyu felt grateful to Sung-Hoon since he could feel genuine care in Sung-Hoon\u2019s voice. Sung-Hoon added, \u201cYou should also learn to spend your wealth on yourself and your family. Don\u2019t just pile your money; enjoy it a little.\u201d\u201cAll right. Would you like a bonus?\u201d When Gi-Gyu joked, Sung-Hoon seemed a little flustered as he answered, \u201cWell, if you insist\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu chuckled in amusement, and Sung-Hoon also changed the subject with a smile. He asked, \u201cAh, did you see that famous player inside the Tower?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cWe got many reports about this weirdo who had been massacring the 29th-floor monsters. The other players suspect that he is a red player. They described a tall man carrying red and white swords. This weirdo was supposedly wearing an unusual necklace, and umm\u2026 Except for the messy beard, it actually sounded like you\u2026\u201dAfter mumbling for a moment, Sung-Hoon suddenly sighed and muttered, \u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a grin.1. Soondae is a type of blood sausage in Korean cuisine, a popular street food.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61. Test and Awakening\u201cAhh\u2026 This is driving me crazy\u2026\u201d muttered Gi-Gyu when he saw the mirror after taking a shower.-But I think you look beautiful! I like it!Brunheart chimed in merrily.\u201cBut it stands out too much! I mean, violet?\u201d The color had softened a bit, but there was no mistaking it: His right eye was still a vivacious violet color. Gi-Gyu felt troubled by his unique look.\u2018Am I part cat? Why do I have heterochromia?\u2019\u201cI also don\u2019t like wearing lenses.\u201d His model-like appearance was already drawing more eyes than he liked; now, he was even more noticeable.Since he couldn\u2019t find a solution to his problem, he decided to leave it for now and left the washroom.When Yoo-Jung saw him, she waved at him and greeted, \u201cYo! Foreigner! Hi! Hello!\u201dShe was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts; she was sitting on the sofa leisurely.\u201cAre you itching for a beating?\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered while pressing his temples in frustration. Yoo-Jung used to be such an obedient little sister; what happened to her?\u201cWhy did your eye color change?\u201d Yoo-Jung asked as Gi-Gyu pushed her legs away and sat on the sofa next to her. He replied, \u201cWho knows? But it\u2019s stressing me out.\u201d\u201cOppa, you should really become a celebrity. You have become so handsome, and now with that pretty eye\u2026 Look at me and listen carefully.\u201d Yoo-Jung turned toward him and continued, \u201cA pretty boy who overcame his difficult circumstances and became a powerful player! An odd-eyed beauty! A brother with an even more beautiful sister! This could be your angle!\u201dGi-Gyu's answer was a light smack to her head. Glaring at him, Yoo-Jung protested, \u201cOppa! I told you not to hit my head!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re studying for anything right now,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu in a calm voice as he leaned back on the sofa. He slept very well last night, but he still felt exhausted.He planned on taking care of a few errands before returning to the Tower this time.Yoo-Jung argued, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong! I\u2019ve been studying very hard lately! Here I was actually making an effort to spend time with you, but you\u2026!\u201d\u201cSure, whatever.\u201d\u201cKids, are you fighting again?\u201d Su-Jin asked. She was in the kitchen, cooking up a storm for them while humming a merry tune. Their mother spent most of her time home, so cooking became her new hobby.\u201cHave you watched the Player News lately, Oppa?\u201d Yoo-Jung changed the channel to what Gi-Gyu used to watch every day in the past. He was in no mood for player gossip, but it had been long since he watched it, so he decided to check if there was anything worth knowing.-The association president has finally revealed his secret identity.-The association plans to change its policies. It\u2019s time we find out the details. The question is, will the changes be all good?-The Cain Guild has annihilated the Smurf Guild\u2014one of the most brutal red player guilds!-Everyone is praising the Cain Guild for making such a great accomplishment after recently becoming one of the top ten Korean guilds.The Player News channel was listing all the hot topics, and Gi-Gyu almost laughed as he watched.\u2018I\u2019m involved in all the headlines.\u2019Lately, he had noticed that he was involved in all the breaking news one way and another. In the past, Gi-Gyu had zero influence; he was one of many players and nothing more. But now, he was so powerful that everything he did ended up on the news. Of course, only a few people knew of his involvement in these events.\u201cOh! This is great! I got worried every time you entered the Tower because of those red players; now, I feel so much better, Oppa! Players like those need to disappear from this world!\u201d Yoo-Jung announced with excitement.\u2018I\u2019m working on that, Yoo-Jung,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. He was never one to brag, and he knew the truth would only make his family worry even more. So all he did was smile and close his eyes.Their mother added, \u201cI was worried about those red players too, Gi-Gyu. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re gone. Those evil players make the families of all innocent players worry day and night.\u201dGi-Gyu opened his eyes and continued to watch the news.-The Smurf Guild master, Choi Min-Suk, is reported dead.Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t thrilled after all that killing\u2014he wasn\u2019t sad either.***After a long-overdue rest, Gi-Gyu headed to Old Man Hwang\u2019s workshop.\u201cWhat happened to your eye?\u201d The elderly man asked the moment he saw Gi-Gyu. Gi-Gyu\u2019s appearance had changed drastically, so the surprise was warranted. Gi-Gyu made up an excuse with a sigh, and the older man nodded in understanding.Old Man Hwang explained, \u201cSome items can change eye color like that, but I suppose those won\u2019t help you since you can\u2019t use player items.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re right.\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t use player items due to his Egos, so he didn\u2019t even consider them for his problem.Old Man Hwang asked, \u201cWhat brings you here today? It has been such a long time.\u201d The elderly man seemed a bit upset with Gi-Gyu\u2019s delayed visit.Gi-Gyu apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t come here in a while. I was swamped.\u201d\u201cKhmm!\u201d Old Man Hwang cleared his throat awkwardly. He didn\u2019t mean to reveal how he missed Gi-Gyu. \u201cWell, I know how busy you must\u2019ve been. I saw you on TV.\u201d\u201cKhmm!\u201d It was now Gi-Gyu\u2019s turn to clear his throat in embarrassment. He should\u2019ve known Old Man Hwang could easily identify the masked player. After all, the elderly man made weapons for a living\u2014how could his sharp eyes miss that? Gi-Gyu even suspected that Old Man Hwang\u2019s eyes were sharper than most players.Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, Sir.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d When Old Man Hwang narrowed his eyes in question, Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI need to find a way to hide my rings.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d The elderly man nodded as he eyed Gi-Gyu\u2019s rings. They were indeed unique with their beautiful glow. One look, and anyone could tell they weren\u2019t ordinary accessories.Old Man Hwang drew the curtain to a smaller room and announced, \u201cGloves and gauntlets are stored over here.\u201dThe tiny room was connected to the main workshop, but it was neatly separated to provide extra storage. Curious, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSir, you must have enough money to move, so why don\u2019t you? I\u2019m sure you can afford a much bigger and better workshop.\u201dJust the money Gi-Gyu had paid him should\u2019ve been enough for the old man to move to a fancy building in a much better location. Shaking his head, the blacksmith replied, \u201cI have my reasons, so please don\u2019t ask me that question again.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded in understanding. He didn\u2019t really care where the elderly man worked as long as he could purchase the blacksmith\u2019s Egos.\u2018By the way, I haven\u2019t seen Min-Su in a while either.\u2019Old Man Hwang\u2019s grandson, Min-Su, often strutted around the workshop; lately, he had been absent. Gi-Gyu remembered the elderly man mentioning Min-Su\u2019s father, so he assumed the boy must be with him.Returning to the matter at hand, Gi-Gyu carefully examined the gloves and gauntlets. Old Man Hwang watched with interest and asked, \u201cLast time you were here, you couldn\u2019t sync with many of my weapons. So what changed?\u201d\u201cI have my ways, Sir.\u201dGi-Gyu only purchased Bi and Hermes during his last visit because he couldn\u2019t sync with the other pseudo Egos. The elixir had improved his \u201cshell,\" so he could now sync with more than three Egos. However, that wasn\u2019t all: Brunheart was the one who truly knocked that \u201cthree Ego limit\u201d out of the park.\u2018So you\u2019re saying obtaining that gate Ego has increased my sync potential?\u2019El admitted that she had never encountered a gate Ego until she met Brunheart. Usually, a normal Ego would eat up Gi-Gyu\u2019s sync potential. However, Brunheart had actually boosted his ability to sync, allowing him to sync with even more Egos. In other words, if Brunheart became stronger, Gi-Gyu\u2019s sync potential could also increase.With this thought, Gi-Gyu continued to examine Old Man Hwang\u2019s work. He complimented the elderly man, \u201cSir, you have such beautiful taste.\u201dThe blacksmith\u2019s weapons were works of art. Ever since he purchased the old Brunheart, Bi, and Hermes, Gi-Gyu couldn't help admiring the elegant pieces.\u201cHaha, of course, they are. A true craftsman must be able to create works that are both beautiful and functional.\u201d Old Man Hwang seemed happy, but Gi-Gyu was troubled. He needed an item to hide his extravagant rings, but the elderly man\u2019s works were even more conspicuous. Gi-Gyu wanted something unremarkable so he could wear it every day.When Gi-Gyu picked up a pair of gauntlets, Old Man Hwang said, \u201cGood choice.\u201d The pair was the most inconspicuous item that also looked the most functional. When he tried the black gauntlet, he realized it was very flexible, allowing his fingers to move freely.\u201cSync,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured.[Please name the Ego.]Thanks to his newfound strength, the weapons inside Old Man Hwang\u2019s workshop no longer rejected Gi-Gyu. And with his increased sync potential, syncing with more Egos wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201cOberon.\u201d[You have synced with Oberon.][You can now access Oberon\u2019s information.]The pair of gauntlets, now named Oberon, glowed brightly, indicating the sync was a success. Gi-Gyu quickly accessed its status screen.[Oberon][Level 27][Power: 40][Speed: 30][Stamina: 12][Magic: 8]-Abilities-[Accessory][Force: Can temporarily increase strength.][Can increase basic strength by 1%.]\u201cOh!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed in admiration. The buff Oberon brought was befitting of such a beautiful gauntlet. On top of that, the skill named \u201cForce\u201d was something only damage dealers possessed. It temporarily increased the user\u2019s strength, and it was known to be a very effective skill. And also why many rankers used it frequently.Creak, creak\u2026Gi-Gyu tried clenching a few times. It felt a little uncomfortable because the gauntlets were new, but he knew getting used to them would take no time.\u201cLou, El,\u201d Gi-Gyu called out his Egos\u2019 names. Now, he had to see if Lou and El could transform into their sword form even when he was wearing the gauntlets. At Gi-Gyu\u2019s command, black smoke escaped Oberon\u2019s metallic joints; Lou and El soon appeared in his hands.\u201cGood.\u201dThe last thing was to check Oberon\u2019s accessory form. There was no way Gi-Gyu could wear the pair of gauntlets everywhere. Lou and El returned to their ring forms, and the black gauntlets also slowly transformed.\u201cI guess they turn into bracelets.\u201dThe gauntlets disappeared and were replaced by a bracelet on each of his wrists. They were made of some unknown black metal, and ebony flowers adorned them. Gi-Gyu clenched his fists to check the fit. Overall, he was satisfied with his new Ego.\u201cDo you like them?\u201d Old Man Hwang asked.\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk\u2026 At this point, all my babies seem tailor-made for you. Since my children no longer reject you, they will be here forever, waiting for you to choose them.\u201d When the blacksmith murmured sadly, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty.Old Man Hwang was right: Any Egos Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t choose would be stuck in this workshop for eternity. Gi-Gyu wished he could sync with all of them, but it was not possible at the moment.\u201cI will work hard to use all of your weapons someday, Sir.\u201d\u201cI would appreciate that.'' Old Man Hwang\u2019s eyes shined with appreciation.Admiring his new bracelets, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow much should I pay for Oberon?\u201dIt was time to pay for his purchase. But to Gi-Gyu\u2019s surprise, the blacksmith shook his head and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu with a confused face. Old Man Hwang was a true craftsman who loved and treasured his works. That was why he priced his weapons accordingly. From his very first purchase, Gi-Gyu became used to paying a large sum of money to the blacksmith for his works. The elderly man was a savvy businessman, so this was an unexpected answer.Old Man Hwang asked with a serious look on his face, \u201cInstead, will you help me in the future if I am in need?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something I can do\u2014\u201d\u201cAll right, that\u2019s good enough. If you give me your promise, I will consider Oberon fully paid.\u201d The blacksmith turned around with a nod, dismissing Gi-Gyu. Watching the elderly man\u2019s back, Gi-Gyu realized something.\u2018He\u2019s going to ask me for something complicated in the future, isn't he?\u2019\u2019Gi-Gyu had received an incredible weapon, so he knew Old Man Hwang\u2019s future request would be equally incredible. Then again, it would\u2019ve been difficult for him to refuse the blacksmith\u2019s boon even without this exchange. After all, Old Man Hwang was the only one who could make pseudo Egos for him.After bowing deeply to the elderly man\u2019s back, Gi-Gyu left the workshop. As he climbed the stairs to exit the building, he murmured, \u201cI\u2019ve finally completed my preparation.\u201dGi-Gyu was now ready to take the 30th-floor test.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62. Test and Awakening (2)Gi-Gyu no longer had any excuses to procrastinate taking the 30th-floor test. Suk-Woo\u2019s problem was for Suk-Woo to deal with, the public had lost much of its interest in the masked ranker by now, and no one from the Smurf Guild could come after Gi-Gyu now. So, now was the perfect time.With his new Egos, Gi-Gyu was ready to take the 30th-floor test.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu exhaled deeply. Ever since he decided to take the test, he had been feeling an overwhelming sense of anxiety. It was growing with each passing day, so he had been unconsciously delaying taking the test until now.-Don\u2019t be so nervous!Brunheart exclaimed with his usual cheerfulness.-I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be all right, Master.El reassured Gi-Gyu.\u2018Why am I so nervous?\u2019This emotional state was alien to him. The ominous feeling told him that taking this test would mean losing something. However, one of Gi-Gyu\u2019s goals was to ascend the Tower. He had to pass this test to continue climbing the Tower: It was that simple. So, he couldn\u2019t halt his progress based on a vaguely ominous feeling. He wished aloud, \u201cI hope the 30th-floor test is the same as all the other tests.\u201dFor some unknown reason, the difficulty levels of all the tests he took till now were lowered. Hoping for more of the same, Gi-Gyu headed out.***\u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d Sung-Hoon greeted Gi-Gyu the moment he arrived at the association building. It seemed that every time Gi-Gyu decided to enter the Tower, Song-Hoon magically appeared to accompany him. But this couldn\u2019t be the case, could it?Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cDo you wait for me here every day?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d As it turned out, Gi-Gyu\u2019s guess was a fact. When he gaped, Sung-Hoon smiled and explained, \u201cYou know my job is to manage your life, don\u2019t you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu? And except for meeting you at your home for personal errands, where else can I see you? The Tower, of course.\u201dNoticing that Gi-Gyu still looked confused, Sung-Hoon added, \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to go to work, I just come here and wait for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I find that mildly creepy.\u201d Gi-Gyu felt a bit uncomfortable by Sung-Hoon\u2019s reply.Pointing at Oberon, Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cNew set of gauntlets? A recent purchase?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d mumbled Gi-Gyu. Unwilling to talk details, he quickly changed the subject and asked, \u201cSung-Hoon, don\u2019t you go hunting at all?\u201d\u201cSometimes, I get dispatched to a gate, so yes. I also go inside the Tower when I get a chance, so you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m doing fine on my own. My job may be to take care of you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu, but I will always be a player first.\u201d\u201cYou must lead a busy life,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. It appeared that Sung-Hoon\u2019s life was just as busy as Gi-Gyu's.With a wide grin, Sung-Hoon shrugged and replied, \u201cNot as busy as you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. Are you going hunting again today? When will you be returning?\u201d Sung-Hoon took out his phone and opened the calendar app.\u2018He can\u2019t possibly enjoy making me uncomfortable, right\u2026?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought awkwardly. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t like being burdened by unnecessary interest and attention, and Sung-Hoon knew this very well. Yet, it seemed Sung-Hoon enjoyed every second of his misery.Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s growing discomfort, Sung-Hoon continued with determination, \u201cBasically, I\u2019m to\u00a0dedicate\u00a0my very being to you as your manager. So, my interest in your life shouldn\u2019t make you uncomfortable, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. Please, just tell me your schedule. Tell me how you spend every waking moment of your day, so I can assist you as best as I can!\u201dWhen Sung-Hoon emphasized the word \u201cdedicated,\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu rubbed his forehead as if he was getting a headache. He didn\u2019t want to encourage Sung-Hoon\u2019s teasing way, but he had to admit that it was best for his \u201cmanager\u201d to know his schedule.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI\u2019m going into the Tower to take the 30th-floor test. So I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201cThe test?\u201d Sung-Hoon\u2019s eyes shined.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat an exciting time. I\u2019m looking forward to how strong you\u2019ll become after you pass this test, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dAll players received a special reward after clearing a test inside the Tower. This was the rule in the player world.However, Gi-Gyu seemed like an exception to this rule: He didn\u2019t receive a reward after clearing the 10th-floor test. Instead, the difficulty level of the test was decreased. So, Gi-Gyu believed he wouldn\u2019t get anything from the 30th-floor test either.Of course, Sung-Hoon didn\u2019t know about this, which was why he was so expectant. Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI hope I become stronger too.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re already very strong, so I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about. Don\u2019t be nervous about this test, and have fun. The 30th-floor test should be too easy for you to pass, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d When Sung-Hoon suggested lightly, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cAll right.\u201dUnfortunately, he still couldn\u2019t shake off the ominous feeling.***Currently, Gi-Gyu was on the 29th floor; he was very familiar with this floor because he had spent a lot of time here. The floors above the 50th were almost as big as a small country; the 29th floor was only the size of a small city.Gi-Gyu had visited the door to the 30th floor before, so he just rushed there. No one, monsters and humans alike, dared to stop him. There were roars and whispers, but he reached the door without any interruptions.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu moaned as he stood in front of the steel door. His hands shook, and he instinctively knew that his body was giving him a clear warning.\u201cWhy\u2026 do I feel this way? What\u2019s going on?\u201d No matter how hard he thought about this, he couldn\u2019t come up with an answer.Shiver.His hands still shaking, Gi-Gyu grabbed the steel door and pulled it open. The heavy door moved slowly, and inside was a whole new universe that humans would find hard to imagine.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside!\u201d Gi-Gyu announced, hoping it would calm his shaking body.El replied,-I am happy to go anywhere you go, Master.Brunheart added,-Me too! You\u2019re the best, Master!Gi-Gyu chuckled and took a step forward. The second he was inside the test area, some invisible force closed the steel door behind him.Creak!***[You have entered the test chamber.][You have satisfied all requirements.][You are qualified to take the test.]Gi-Gyu heard the familiar system sound announcing his entrance. He waited for the system to state the decrease in the difficulty level, but\u2026[A special test will take place.]An unfamiliar system voice announced, and Gi-Gyu suddenly found himself floating in darkness. He still had full control over his body, but moving freely became difficult. Soon, the darkness disappeared, and a frustrated murmur escaped Gi-Gyu\u2019s lips. \u201cI knew it.\u201dThe ominous feeling was proving itself a soothsayer.\u201cInstead of lowering the test difficulty level, it\u2019s giving me a special test.\u201d Gi-Gyu had no idea what this even meant. Unhurriedly, he checked his bag and equipment; thankfully, nothing was lost.\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ve still got everything.\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu looked around and found himself in unfamiliar badlands. Fine particles of sand flew around as he stood alone in the middle of nowhere. When he squinted, he saw something very far away.\u201cIs that\u2026 a castle?\u201dHe spotted a black castle and knew immediately he had to go there. The system announcement didn\u2019t give him any other instructions, so all he could do was begin walking.\u201cI guess that\u2019s where the test will occur,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu as he swung his hands. He didn\u2019t have to call them; Lou and El just appeared in his hands. He had never formally trained using double swords, but he was now an expert in using them.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Gi-Gyu kicked the ground and began running.-Yes, Master.-I\u2019m all in!It looked like the castle was quite a distance away. Gi-Gyu was certain monsters would attack him on the way, so he decided to shorten the trip by rushing there.\u201cKerrrk!\u201d Several scorpions popped out from different areas of the badlands.\u201cGuess I\u2019m hunting giant scorpions today,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. A giant scorpion was the size of three cars. With its red shell and poisonous sting, a giant scorpion was a menacing monster.Five scorpions simultaneously attacked Gi-Gyu, but he didn\u2019t panic. Also, the sand was slowing him down and preventing him from going full speed.\u201cKerrrk! Kerrrk!\u201d The scorpions swarmed toward Gi-Gyu viciously. Their stings stretched like rubber bands as they targeted his body, but he dodged them with ease.Thwack!The poison sting struck the spot Gi-Gyu was standing a moment ago.\u201cHup.\u201d Gi-Gyu controlled his breath expertly. He learned this a long time ago: Well-controlled breathing could make him more sensitive to oncoming attacks. He could also deliver more accurate attacks, thanks to it.Fwoosh!Another scorpion\u2019s poison sting flew toward Gi-Gyu as it pierced the air sharply. He turned midair to dodge it and plunged Lou into one of the monsters.Crack!He used his fall and Lou to cleave the scorpion\u2019s hard shell.\u201cKerrrkkk!\u201d the giant scorpion screamed in agony. While he dealt with this scorpion, the other monsters didn\u2019t bother to attack him.\u00a0They seemed more interested in the battle taking place.\u00a0With Accelerate in effect, Gi-Gyu moved even faster as he activated his other skills.\u201cForce.\u201d It was the skill he gained from his newest Ego, Oberon. Before long, a strength he had never felt before began coursing through his body.\u2018Skills are the best!\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought gleefully. He used his increased strength to plunge Lou into the flailing scorpion that had just lost its poisonous sting.Crunch!The scorpion spasmed for a moment before disappearing, leaving behind a crystal alone. When Gi-Gyu tried to pick it up, the other scorpions came to their senses and decided that it was high time they attacked him.\u201cKerrrk!\u201d As if angered by their friend\u2019s death, the other giant scorpions growled louder and targeted Gi-Gyu. But they were no match for him. Gi-Gyu fought back apace and destroyed the herd before long.***\u201cThis can\u2019t be the end of the special test,\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered as he got closer to the castle. Various badlands monsters like giant scorpions and desert worms attacked him on the way, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t find them difficult to handle. There was no way a \u201cspecial test\u201d would be this simple, so he knew something far more powerful was waiting inside the castle.\u201cWell, there is no point in worrying about it.\u201d He had no idea what was waiting for him, so he couldn\u2019t prepare countermeasures and had to just face it head-on.Gi-Gyu began to walk a little faster as he came closer to the castle. The black castle seemed even larger and scarier as he approached it. After killing a dozen more monsters, he found himself standing before the castle.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d He inhaled deeply. Amid all the hunting and running, he didn\u2019t take a single deep breath.Gi-Gyu slowly walked up to the massive castle entrance; it began to open as if it had been waiting for him.Creak!-Please be careful, Master.-Master, take it easy!Both El and Brunheart warned him. Like his Egos, Gi-Gyu could also feel the various auras and presences inside the gate. He didn\u2019t dash inside; instead, he took several tentative steps.Rattle, rattle\u2026When he heard the metallic sounds, he paused.\u201cCreeekkk!\u201d One hundred well-trained lizardmen in full armor turned toward Gi-Gyu and lined up in a militaristic formation. All their eyes held contempt and malice for their foe.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. He wasn\u2019t worried about their strength; he was worried about their number. Since they were well-armed and trained, Gi-Gyu knew it would take quite an effort to deal with them. He didn\u2019t doubt himself for a second and swirled his swords while eying the monsters.Gi-Gyu relaxed his grip on El while stretching his hand holding Lou.\u201cCreeek!\u201d The lizardmen were also eying him with their spears aimed.\u2018Haaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply once again. Even though the monsters he battled so far had been easy, his anxiety refused to dissipate.\u201cStill feel so nervous\u2026\u201d he muttered. Just what was inside this castle that made him feel so uneasy? Inside, the spire looked even more ominous.Dash!Gi-Gyu kicked the ground and sprinted toward the lizardmen.Clank.\u201cCreeekkk!\u201d the lizardmen screamed as they also stormed toward Gi-Gyu with their spears raised high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63. Test and Awakening (3)Gi-Gyu was facing 100 well-trained and armed monsters; at the end of the day, they were just lizardmen. Despite their very many advantages, the battle ended much earlier than Gi-Gyu anticipated.\u201cKreek\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu slowly approached a few lizardmen trembling in pain on the ground.Stab!Without hesitation, he thrust Lou into each of them.[Lou has absorbed the lizardman\u2019s blood.][Lou has obtained the lizardman\u2019s heat tolerance.]\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d He exhaled deeply. The battle may have been easier than expected, but it didn\u2019t mean he came out unscathed: Gi-Gyu\u2019s several wounds were bleeding all over. It wasn\u2019t surprising since he had just faced 100 lizardmen. Thankfully, Lou gained something useful from this whole ordeal.He sat on the ground after confirming that there were no more alien auras around him. \u201cI\u2019m tired\u2026\u201d-We should take a break before going forward!Brunheart replied. Sitting on the ground, Gi-Gyu began to treat his wounds with the potions he brought. As his injuries healed, he looked up and felt an incredibly ominous aura coming from high up in the castle. He knew where he had to go, but he felt hesitant to go forward.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu chuckled since he was never one to fear his enemies.\u201cHup!\u201d When he was done treating his wounds, Gi-Gyu stood up and began cautiously walking deeper into the castle.[You have entered the test chamber.][The special test will now take place.]\u201cThe special test?\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered in shock. That army of lizardmen wasn\u2019t even part of the test? Gi-Gyu was a bit discouraged, but he didn\u2019t stop. The castle itself was a gloomy place, filled with countless vile and terrifying auras. It wasn\u2019t huge, which meant the creatures inside couldn\u2019t make any big movements. However, the overwhelming sense of dread, thanks to the oppressive auras inside, convinced him that the test\u2019s difficulty had increased for him.\u201cI think it\u2019s finally beginning.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s special test was about to start.***\u201cOpen,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured, making the black sphere on his chest revolve and emit blue light. In a blink of an eye, Brunheart\u2019s gate engulfed the pile of crystals he collected by killing the lizardmen.[Brunheart has gained experience points.][All the monsters inside the gate have gained experience points.]\u201cClose.\u201d Gi-Gyu quickly closed the gate lest the skeletons make a break for it. As a nice warmth spread around his chest, he looked around and found himself alone on this floor.\u201cIt looks like this castle has five floors.\u201d Gi-Gyu suspected different monsters occupied each floor. After he killed all the monsters on this floor, a staircase leading to the next floor opened up.Currently, Gi-Gyu was on the third floor. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out the boss monster was on the fifth floor, so he would face it after clearing another floor.\u201cLet\u2019s rest here for a day.\u201d-Of course, Master.El\u2019s reply was calm as usual, while Brunheart shouted in excitement,-That sounds like a great plan!It had already been five days since Gi-Gyu entered the 30th-floor test chamber. Clearing each floor of this castle took a lot of energy, so it was best to get plenty of rest before proceeding to the next floor. Thankfully, the monsters on each floor didn\u2019t regenerate once the stairs to the next floor opened up.Gi-Gyu set his tent up haphazardly and enabled the barrier item in case of a random monster\u2019s attack.\u201cBrunheart,\u201d Gi-Gyu called out while chewing some jerky, and Brunheart immediately answered.-Yes, Master?\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t control the monsters inside your gate?\u201d The monsters inside Brunheart\u2019s gate were becoming stronger with each crystal Gi-Gyu deposited, but he couldn\u2019t command them. Gi-Gyu wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard on this castle\u2019s monsters if he could control the skeleton soldiers inside. He would\u2019ve simply sicced his skeletons on this castle\u2019s monsters and left to deal with the big daddy alone.-I don\u2019t know yet. Maybe later\u2026? I don\u2019t know much about myself\u2026 Am I useless?! I\u2019m so sorry, Master! I really want to be helpful to you\u2026Brunheart\u2019s voice sounded tearful, feeling sad about not being able to help his master. But Gi-Gyu smiled wide and replied, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true.\u201d After thinking for a few minutes, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll probably be able to use them later.\u201d-But there is no guarantee, Master!Gi-Gyu was willing to continue strengthening the skeletons if there was even the slightest chance he could command them later. Also, he believed that even if he couldn\u2019t command them, he should be able to use them one way or another in the future.Gi-Gyu entered the tent, leaned against a wall, and closed his eyes.***[The stairs to the next floor have opened.]When Gi-Gyu pierced a squirming centipede\u2019s head, the system announced as the nearby wall opened up.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned a little. The fourth-floor monsters lacked number and strength, so he dealt with them effortlessly and didn\u2019t suffer any injury. Now, he had a problem to consider: Should he take another day to rest, or should he charge in?In a normal situation, this would've been a no-brainer. Gi-Gyu was a by-the-book guy, so he would\u2019ve rested, got into his peak condition, and then faced the boss monster.However, things were a little different here: The aura from the fifth floor was getting stronger with time.The aura he felt from the fifth floor had to be from the boss monster. And for some reason, the boss was becoming stronger every day. If Gi-Gyu delayed going to the fifth floor, he knew the boss monster would become even more powerful.\u201cIf I go now, neither of us will be in top shape, so\u2026\u201d Thinking this was sound logic, Gi-Gyu began to walk forward.Clack, clack\u2026While climbing the stairs, he took out all the buff and healing potions from his bag. Not many were left, but now wasn\u2019t the time to save them, so he drank them all.[Your power has increased.][Your speed has increased.][Your stamina recovery has increased.]These were all expensive potions that his past poor self wouldn\u2019t even dream of using. However, now that he was rich beyond his wildest dream and had the association\u2019s support, he was consuming them like candies.When he finally saw the top floor, he heard the system announcement.[You are now entering the 5th floor.]\u201cAre those the guards?\u201d Gi-Gyu saw another giant door; this one was guarded by two knights in steel armor holding halberds. At first glance, they looked like statues, but they were no doubt alive.Clank.Clank.The knights in steel armor aimed their halberds at Gi-Gyu; in response, Gi-Gyu held Lou and El at an angle and muttered, \u201cForce.\u201dAccelerate gradually increased Gi-Gyu\u2019s speed, so he decided to save it for the boss and use Force on the guards. When he activated Force, he saw the tendons in his hands pop up and felt an undeniable power filling his body.Kraackkkkk!The two knights sprinted toward Gi-Gyu. When their halberds hit Lou and El, a loud metallic noise rang. The force was so great that sparks continuously flew everywhere. Gi-Gyu lowered his head smoothly and pushed away one knight\u2019s halberd.Clunk!The halberd, heading toward Gi-Gyu, crashed into the other knight\u2019s chest. As the second knight staggered, he quickly gave the knight behind him a backward stab with El.\u201cGrrrk\u2026\u201dEl had pierced the area where the knight\u2019s helmet and armor met, causing the monster to collapse to the ground. The other surviving knight got his footing and ran toward Gi-Gyu with his halberd. El was still in the other knight\u2019s neck, so he grabbed Lou with both hands and swung it toward the halberd.Clink!The metallic clang wasn\u2019t that loud this time; Gi-Gyu had cleaved the knight\u2019s armored body in half at its waist. Force gave him enough power to cut through the knight\u2019s body and armor. He quickly picked up the crystals and continued forward. Procrastinating at this point was fruitless, useless, and empty.Creak!The door the guards were protecting opened, revealing a grand hall. At the end of it was an extravagant throne befitting a king.And\u2026\u201c...\u201d An odd silence fell in the hall as the only two living things in the room studied each other. The creature on the throne was half man and half skeleton and was currently examining Gi-Gyu with its chin on its hand.***Gi-Gyu took his time examining the man on the throne. The left side of this creature looked like a man, while the other half was all bones. The man didn\u2019t move, but he certainly wasn\u2019t dead.Shiver\u2026Gi-Gyu could finally put a face to the shocking aura he had been feeling; it didn\u2019t make the situation any less terrifying. His entire being relaxed, the man murmured, \u201cAre you\u2026\u201dHis voice sounded bizarre as he continued, \u201c...the one who woke me up?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t answer him. He found himself drowning deeper in the deadly aura with every word the creature spoke. When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond, the fleshy half of the man frowned and demanded, \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Gi-Gyu finally managed to reply. He was an attack-first-ask-questions-later kind of guy since he believed waiting for an inevitable battle was a waste of time. His opponent was sitting on a throne, a clear vulnerable position, so waiting around made no sense. This was the best chance for him to make the first move.But for some reason, Gi-Gyu stood still and just stared at his foe.\u2018He feels so familiar.\u2019Even though this was the first time Gi-Gyu had seen this creature, the man felt very familiar to him.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The man grabbed the throne\u2019s arms and used them to rise slowly. His body shook dangerously, but the man managed to stand up straight. Gi-Gyu tensed as the man began to walk toward him.Step, step\u2026For some reason, the humane part of the creature didn\u2019t give off any threatening aura. When he got closer to Gi-Gyu, the man paused, and his half lip stretched widely in a creepy grin. Gi-Gyu felt nauseous just watching the creature\u2019s face, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.The creature unhurriedly continued, \u201c...am the master of all black magic\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat!!!\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his shock.\u2018The master of all black magic? Why does this sound so familiar?\u2019The man added, \u201c...and all evil swords.\u201dThumpppp!The creature\u2019s thundering cry echoed throughout the hall. Suddenly, the walls began transforming into several similar-looking swords. Gi-Gyu was confused for half a second before he recognized all the swords\u2019 shape. \u201cLou\u2026?\u201dThe man smirked and questioned Gi-Gyu, \u201cLou?\u201d Reaching out to grab one of the newly formed black swords, the man continued, \u201cMy name isn\u2019t Lou.\u201dWith a chevalier bow, the master of all evil swords murmured, \u201cMy name is\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu waited with bated breath, but the creature didn\u2019t complete his sentence. Instead, the black swords swirled like a hurricane as they rushed toward Gi-Gyu.Using Lou and El, Gi-Gyu dodged and blocked the attack.\u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d The man stated his name, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hear what it was. The man's voice wasn\u2019t quiet or subdued, but it seemed something prevented Gi-Gyu from hearing the creature\u2019s name.\u201cAccelerate! Force!\u201d Gi-Gyu quickly activated his skills. Some may believe these two skills wouldn\u2019t add much to Gi-Gyu\u2019s abilities, but the truth was, they doubled his battle power. Thanks to the increased speed, he escaped the storm of black swords.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu panted like a dog. He escaped the storm, but he was still covered in wounds. He also felt exhausted from gathering all of his strength so quickly.\u2018I need to finish this battle as quickly as possible.\u2019Time wasn\u2019t on Gi-Gyu\u2019s side. The longer it took him to fight this creature, the harder it would be for him to win. The creature looked unfocused for a second, so Gi-Gyu dashed toward him. Who the creature was didn\u2019t matter; his survival and victory did.The moment Gi-Gyu\u2019s sword hit the man\u2019s head, Lou shouted,-Dammit! Dodge!When Gi-Gyu heard the familiar voice, his reflexes took over. He pulled back his sword and backed away immediately.Kaboom!A loud black explosion took place where Gi-Gyu was standing a moment ago. He would've suffered a serious injury had he not moved when he did. However, Gi-Gyu had no time to process where this explosion came from. The familiar rude voice muttered in annoyance,-That\u2019s my physical body.Lou was back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64. Test and Awakening (4)\u201cLou!\u201d When Gi-Gyu shouted in excitement, Lou replied,-You can\u2019t lose your focus now, you idiot.Heeding the warning, Gi-Gyu moved; seconds later, a long sword pierced that spot. The other blades in the sword hurricane also began rushing toward Gi-Gyu as if on cue.\u201cImpressive,\u201d the half-man murmured.-Hey, why is that dude making such awkward comments?When Lou tried to joke, Gi-Gyu replied as he blocked one of the black swords, \u201cHow should I know?!\u201dSlash!The hurricane gave Gi-Gyu numerous gashes; they were bleeding heavily. Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t in much pain. The stamina regeneration potion he drank earlier was helping him greatly. When the black swords around him slowed for a bit, Gi-Gyu took a moment to breathe and asked, \u201cYour physical body?! What does that mean?\u201d-...Lou didn\u2019t answer immediately; instead, he took his time replying.-What is there to understand? As I said, that\u2019s my body.\u201cI heard you the first time, but what exactly does that mean?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked again, still confused.-I used that body when I was alive.Lou sounded bitter as he explained. A shocked and still very confused Gi-Gyu gaped, but he slowly began piecing the puzzle together. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cWhen you were alive?\u201dGi-Gyu remembered El mentioning something like this, but at the time, he didn\u2019t know what it really meant.-Just know that I can beat his ass six ways to Sunday. He isn\u2019t even half as powerful as I used to be.It was more of a brag than an explanation, meaningless. Lou continued, ignoring Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion,-After all, I, the soul, am here in your sword. That body\u2019s only functioning thanks to my old memories and nothing more. On top of that, its physical form isn\u2019t even in that great a shape.\u201cSo, to sum it all up, that body is yours, it\u2019s not in good condition, and it\u2019s not as strong as you.\u201d-...Lou gave Gi-Gyu\u2019s sum up the silent treatment, but it seemed Gi-Gyu did get the gist of the situation. Gi-Gyu could feel how proud Lou was of his past strength. Uncertain about his next move, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cBut that\u2019s your body. Are you sure it\u2019s okay for me to kill it?\u201dOnce Gi-Gyu killed the creature, there was a good possibility that Lou\u2019s former body would be destroyed forever. Gi-Gyu wondered if Lou was really okay with this.-There is no other way. Since this space is special, I think it might be possible for you to do this. I will lend you my power for a moment, so make sure\u2026Fury filled Lou\u2019s voice as he continued,-...you destroy it so that no one can ever taint my body like this again.Suddenly, Lou\u2019s sword form began to spew violet smoke. Its destructive and ominous aura made every hair on Gi-Gyu\u2019s body stand.Lou asked politely,-Please do this for me.Gi-Gyu had never seen this side of Lou. From the moment they first met, Lou had acted childish and rude. Realizing the seriousness of this situation, Gi-Gyu replied in determination, \u201cAll right, I will make sure to destroy your physical body.\u201dSuddenly, the man began to scream in madness, \u201cHow dare you! How dare you!\u201dIgnoring the man\u2019s angry roar, Gi-Gyu began to walk toward him. If he had hurried and moved rashly, he probably would\u2019ve suffered severe injuries due to the sword barrage still storming toward him. He took one careful step at a time as he heard the system announcements.[Your sensitivity to magic is increasing.][The assimilation level has reached C-grade.][You can now use your Ego\u2019s abilities more effectively.][You have learned \u201cDeath\u201d from Lou.][You now have partial access to \u201cDeath.\u201d]The system announcements pleased Gi-Gyu greatly.***Hundreds of swords flew at Gi-Gyu, but he didn\u2019t panic and just calmly swung Lou.Shhh.The violet smoke from Lou slowly engulfed the swords, turning them into dust and scattering them into the air.\u201cW-what the! How\u2026! But those belong to me!\u201d the man howled again in rage. He picked up one of the swords and swung it in the air. He was trying to do what Lou just did by releasing the violet smoke, but he failed miserably and just waved it in thin air.Pssss!The half-man\u2019s swinging sword hit Lou and crumbled into nothing. Lou\u2019s physical body whispered in shock, \u201cT-this can\u2019t be! I-I\u2019m\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu asked Lou one last time,\u00a0\u2018Are you sure this is okay?\u2019-I already said yes! Stop asking me.Lou replied in annoyance, but Gi-Gyu could feel his Ego\u2019s confusion. Even as Gi-Gyu drove Lou into the physical body, the man didn\u2019t stop murmuring. \u201cI am\u2026\u201dThe violet smoke gradually embraced the man, turning him into dust too. Even as the creature\u2019s face scattered away, he whispered, \u201cI am the king of the devils.\u201dThe man, Lou\u2019s physical form, was dead.[You have passed the special test.][Perfect clear.][An additional reward will be given.]The space around Gi-Gyu began to crumble down.[The special test\u2019s reward will be given now.]A dark space surrounded Gi-Gyu. Standing in the world devoid of all things, he heard the system making further announcements.[You have obtained new skills!][You have obtained \"Combination!\u201d][You have obtained \u201cGrant!\u201d][Your assimilation level has increased.]Slowly, a bright light began to fill Gi-Gyu\u2019s vision. Then, he found himself in a blindingly bright space. From somewhere above, two boxes floated down toward him like gifts from God. Without a word, he accepted them.The two boxes, one made of diamond and the other of gold, were now in Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands.***\u201cLou, we need to talk,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he stood in the 30th-floor landmark.-...When Lou didn\u2019t answer him, Gi-Gyu insisted, \u201cI know you can talk now. Stop hiding and have a serious talk with me.\u201dGi-Gyu suddenly realized that he was treating Lou like a pouting girlfriend; the thought was enough to give him chills. Then again, what else could he do? He had to talk to Lou about the new skills and rewards and what happened with his physical body.-Why\u2026?Lou replied in a cautious voice. Feeling a little upset, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhen did you complete the awakening process?\u201d-A while ago.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d-El already told you. I needed some time to think.Before Gi-Gyu could reply, Lou continued quickly,-Do you know what immortal beings do to endure eternity?Gi-Gyu knew it was a rhetorical question, but he could tell Lou was ready to have a serious conversation. After a short contemplation, Gi-Gyu replied honestly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dGi-Gyu tried to come up with an answer. If he were immortal, how would he survive the neverending time? Wealth and respect would fade, and being the strongest would also lose its meaning over time.So what was the right answer? Gi-Gyu waited for Lou\u2019s reply expectantly.-It\u2019s oblivion.\u201cHuh?\u201d-I said you need oblivion. To live that long, one must forget that they\u2019ll live eternally. If not, you\u2019ll lose your existence in time.Lou\u2019s explanation sounded cryptic. Gi-Gyu still couldn\u2019t quite understand it, and Lou continued without giving him the time to process everything,-I will just give you the answers to what you\u2019re curious about. Like El and my physical body told you, I am the master of black magic and evil swords.Gi-Gyu gulped loudly as Lou added.-And the king of the demons.\u201cKing of the demons\u2026?\u201dGi-Gyu knew two things about them: They were enemies and had a deep connection with the Tower and the gates. The incredibly strong Perez was the lowest level demon. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t even imagine how powerful the creature El sealed away from the world must\u2019ve been.And now, Lou was claiming to be the king of all devils.-But some of my minions betrayed and imprisoned me. Those traitors! I ended up losing my body and spending eternity alone. Over time, my fury and desire for revenge became faint, but I needed to protect my existence somehow.Lou sounded sorrowful as he continued.-So\u2026Lou paused as if he was reminiscing his painful past.-I chose to forget. I gradually erased most of my memories over time. First, I erased my purpose in life. Then, my name and the rest. Eventually, I even forgot what I was; I saved my being by forgetting.Wasn\u2019t forgetting your purpose in life and your identity the same as losing yourself? Gi-Gyu wondered about this, but he didn\u2019t voice his thoughts.-The memories I sealed away were released for a moment recently.Lou explained as if he was telling Gi-Gyu a bedtime story.-I couldn\u2019t remember everything, but even the tiny pieces of my memories were enough to confuse me. It made me doubt myself. I couldn\u2019t even decide what I should do next, so I had no choice but to do it.\u201cDo what?\u201dGi-Gyu felt like he could hear Lou laughing as he continued,-I decided to forget everything once more. I chose oblivion again.***Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t bring up that topic again since he didn\u2019t want to muddle Lou\u2019s consciousness. Also, since Lou had already erased most of his memories again, he couldn\u2019t answer Gi-Gyu\u2019s questions anyway. But overall, Gi-Gyu was satisfied with the outcome.\u2018He can make new memories with me now.\u2019Gi-Gyu treasured Lou since Lou was his first Ego and Lou first gave him hope. So he didn\u2019t care about Lou\u2019s past. Also, whatever Lou went through didn\u2019t seem like something he could help with anyway.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to receive an Ego\u2019s fragment as a reward.\u201d-I agree; it\u2019s strange.Lou answered quickly. Just then, Brunheart chimed in with excitement,-Lou! Lou! Let\u2019s be friends! I\u2019m Brunheart!Brunheart didn\u2019t interrupt Gi-Gyu and Lou while they were discussing such a heavy topic. But now that the serious conversation was over, Brunheart greeted Lou with his usual cheerfulness.Lou asked Gi-Gyu in annoyance.-What the heck is this?\u201cHe\u2019s a gate Ego and he has inherited the previous Brunheart\u2019s memories. He\u2019s a nice boy, so be kind to him, Lou.\u201d-Gate Ego? Gosh, this world is full of weirdos.-Lou! You are Master\u2019s very first Ego, right? I hope I get to show you my utmost respect!-If you insist.Lou acted as if Brunheart annoyed him, but Gi-Gyu could tell Lou was pleased with Brunheart\u2019s respectful behavior. With a nod, Gi-Gyu returned to the main topic.\u201cSo the gold box had three Ego fragments.\u201dThose three fragments vanished the second he opened the golden box; they were now displayed on his status screen. Since he also wanted to check his newfound skills, he delayed opening the diamond box and just examined his status screen.\u201cWow, I\u2019m checking my stats after so long,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. Since his personal stats rarely changed, he rarely checked them and was usually more interested in his Ego\u2019s status screens. His heart pounding expectantly, he first looked at his status screen.[Level 1][Job: Ego\u2019s partner][Unique Ability: Link (Can sync with Egos.)]-Abilities-[Assimilation (B): You can use 60% of your Ego\u2019s stats.][Death: Can control death.][Combination: Can combine Egos.][Grant: Can grant an Ego.][Retained Ego: Chang-Gyung, Choi Min-Suk][Retained Ego Fragments: 4 pieces.]\u201cI feel so happy.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled widely as he read his stats.-Why are you so happy?\u201cHow could I not be? I used to have only a line or two. I know it\u2019s just a few more lines, but it still feels like a huge difference to me,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu in excitement. The first thing he noticed was the assimilation grade. He skipped a few grades, but that wasn\u2019t important; the significant change he could feel was. He could now use much more of his Egos\u2019 powers, and he could already tell that by how his body felt.Lou had briefly explained the new skill \u201cDeath\u201d to him, and Gi-Gyu decided to try it out later. Then, there were the other two new skills: Combination and Grant.\u201cSo I can combine and grant Egos?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in confusion. Just the description wasn\u2019t enough for him to understand these skills. He realized he had to try them out to learn their true functions.Gi-Gyu wondered aloud, \u201cSo if I combine Lou and El, will it be like Ellou? Or Louel? Does that mean a new Ego will be created?\u201d-Don\u2019t even say something so creepy!-Master, I must protest as well.Both Lou and El screamed in annoyance. Gi-Gyu chuckled, surprised that even El was so against the idea.\u201cFine, anyway, Grant\u2026\u201d Was he to use this skill on the Ego fragments? Or on Chang-Gyung and Choi Min-Suk\u2019s Egos? Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t tell what he was supposed to do with this new skill. In the end, he decided he wouldn\u2019t know until he tried using it.\u201cOkay, this is the last box,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu as he touched the diamond box.-Are you expecting something good?When Lou asked, Gi-Gyu replied expectantly, \u201cOf course! It\u2019s a\u00a0diamond\u00a0box. I got the elixir the last time I opened one.\u201dGi-Gyu received a diamond box with the elixir inside the Maze of Heryond. Did that mean there would be another elixir in this diamond box?Heart beating like a drum, Gi-Gyu slowly opened the box.\u201cT-this is\u2026?!\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered in confusion, and Lou\u2019s shocked gasp followed it.-...!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65. The Ranker\u201cA piece of bone?\u201dThe diamond box had nothing inside except for a piece of bone. It was such a curious reward that Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but stare at it for a moment. He understood that the likelihood of him getting another elixir bottle was slim, but he expected something more valuable than this random piece of bone.However, Lou seemed to recognize it since Gi-Gyu could feel him reacting strongly to it. \u201cLou? Do you know what this is?\u201d-It\u2019s part of my physical body.\u201cPart of your body?\u201d-Yes. I can\u2019t believe they are toying with my body like this.The black sword, Lou, trembled in a fury. Gi-Gyu\u2019s fingers shook along with it, so he had to wait a while for Lou to calm down.-Just take it and keep it safe for now. It will provide an opportunity for us later.\u201cAll right,\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know a single thing about the piece of bone, but he still put the box in his bag without hesitation. After all, it came from the diamond box; even without Lou\u2019s suggestion, he could tell it was valuable.On top of that, it was part of Lou\u2019s old physical body. Knowing what Lou used to be, an undeniably powerful being, there had to be something to this piece of bone. After processing these thoughts, he announced, \u201cIt\u2019s time to leave the Tower.\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t plan to climb any higher today, so he promptly left the Tower. His current goal was to go over the things he had gained and re-equip himself.***After resting and spending some time with his family, Gi-Gyu returned to the association: He wanted to meet Tae-Shik.\u201cHyung, I have a favor to ask.\u201d Working on his desk, Tae-Shik looked up at Gi-Gyu in confusion. Gi-Gyu had asked for favors before, but only a handful of times and never this candidly.Tae-Shik gulped and stammered, \u201cW-what do you need?\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine a favor that warranted such directness and determination. With a smile, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cI want to have a sparring match with you.\u201d\u201cA spar?\u201dGi-Gyu sat down on the sofa and explained, \u201cI obtained many things from the 30th-floor test. But unfortunately, I have no one to test them out on.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try out your new skills inside the Tower or the gates?\u201d Tae-Shik asked with mock annoyance. A spar wasn\u2019t a big deal, so in a way, Tae-Shik felt relieved. However, he still felt strange that Gi-Gyu asked him to do this.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThe monsters inside aren\u2019t strong enough for me to test out my new skills. I suppose I can find a high-grade gate and try them out there, but I could get some unwanted attention if I do that.\u201dGi-Gyu smiled brightly before adding, \u201cSo you\u2019re the only one who can help me, Hyung!\u201d\u201cGosh\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik massaged his forehead in annoyance.\u201cWell, I did think about asking the association president instead, but\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu murmured, Tae-Shik shook his head emphatically and protested, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t do that! I\u2019ll spar with you! I haven\u2019t had the chance to test myself either lately, so this will be a good opportunity!\u201dTae-Shik quickly rose from his seat as if he was ready to fight Gi-Gyu right in his office. With a shrug, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAll right\u2026 But what\u2019s up with that reaction? So fishy\u2026 Worried I might owe the president a debt? Or are you worried the president will crush me with his strength?\u201dTae-Shik opened the door and walked out as he answered, \u201cBoth.\u201dGi-Gyu gave him a playful smile as he followed him out.***Currently, they were in the association basement, where Gi-Gyu asked Tae-Shik for permission to enter a gate before. Tae-Shik insisted on testing Gi-Gyu\u2019s strength out at the time to see if Gi-Gyu was fit to enter the gate.And now, they were back here.\u201cIt has been a long time since we were down here.\u201d Actually, not much time had passed, but Gi-Gyu still felt very different from the last time he was here.\u201cOnly association employees can enter this place, so don\u2019t worry about privacy,\u201d Tae-Shik said nonchalantly. Turning toward Gi-Gyu, he ordered, \u201cJust unlock your magic capacity, so I can have a look.\u201dUsually, a player\u2019s magical power represented their strength, unlike the gaming concept. In this world, a player\u2019s attributes and skills were stored inside their body as magical power. Once their magic power exceeded a certain level, they could hide or unlock their capacity. For example, a player with seemingly insignificant power could suddenly overwhelm their opponent by revealing their true strength. Or a powerful player could hide his power to conceal his presence from others.However, that wouldn\u2019t work on Gi-Gyu since the elixir had heightened his senses. Consequently, he could gauge a player\u2019s magic capacity accurately even if they hid it well.Tae-Shik explained, \u201cMy senses aren\u2019t as accurate as yours. I could feel how strong you were in the past because you weren\u2019t as powerful; now, I can\u2019t even make a guess.\u201dGi-Gyu had been hiding his full power for a while now. Moreover, since his assimilation level had increased after passing the 30th-floor test, his ability to sense other players\u2019 magic capacity also increased. In Gi-Gyu\u2019s current condition, he could easily hide his power even from high rankers.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAll right.\u201d As Tae-Shik requested, Gi-Gyu slowly revealed his full power. Only players could see magic, and when Tae-Shik saw the blue storm revolving around Gi-Gyu, he gasped, \u201cW-what the?!\u201dThe amount of power Gi-Gyu unlocked was enough to seal a low-level item or suffocate a weak player. His incredible magic made Tae-Shik exclaim in shock, \u201cHey! Hey! Stop that already! What the heck is that?!\u201dShaking his head in disbelief, Tae-Shik murmured, \u201cWith this much magic\u2026\u201d He was in such awe that he couldn\u2019t even finish his sentence. Gi-Gyu frowned and argued, \u201cI know it looks like a lot, but it\u2019s just my capacity. I don\u2019t have any decent skills, and it\u2019s not like I can use my magic in full anyway.\u201dMagical capacity was a player's full power, which included everything from their attributes to skills. What Tae-Shik saw wasn\u2019t just Gi-Gyu\u2019s strength\u2014it also had his Egos\u2019 abilities. So although the power storm around Gi-Gyu looked alarmingly enormous, he didn\u2019t have access to all of it just yet. The assimilation grade had increased, which helped, but it still wasn\u2019t 100%. That was why Gi-Gyu looked so frustrated.\u201cHey, if you could use all of that power, you would\u2019ve been a high ranker already. Haa\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik sighed deeply before continuing, \u201cMost players can\u2019t achieve half of what you have even if they work their entire lives for it. Yet, you achieved all this in less than a year.\u201dTae-Shik stopped talking and walked away.\u201cWhere are you going, Hyung?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked Tae-Shik, who was leaving the training hall, Tae-Shik replied, \u201cPractice weapons won\u2019t be enough for our battle. I will go get my real weapon, so just wait here.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help smiling at Tae-Shik\u2019s announcement. Tae-Shik\u2019s weapon was just as famous as Tae-Shik himself when he was an active high ranker. Since Tae-Shik now felt the need to use it, he acknowledged Gi-Gyu as a powerful player.Feeling proud of himself, Gi-Gyu smiled in satisfaction.***Tae-Shik held a long, dark-colored spear; it was an ordinary-looking weapon with no decorations. However, Gi-Gyu knew how powerful it was since it was related to Tae-Shik\u2019s code name.\u201cBehemoth.\u201d When Gi-Gyu murmured, Tae-Shik flailed his hands in frustration and objected, \u201cHey, please don\u2019t call me by my old code name. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018old\u2019 code name? You know very well that a player\u2019s code name can never change: It's yours forever once you get one. You\u2019ll have to use it once you return to being an active high ranker,\u201d Gi-Gyu stated. No player could just up and change their code name without a valid reason; not liking it wasn\u2019t a valid reason.Tae-Shik scratched his cheek in embarrassment and murmured, \u201cI know that, but\u2026\u201d With another sigh, he added, \u201cFine, whatever. It\u2019s just mortifying to be called by that name, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered and twirled his hands. Lou and El silently took their place, Oberon changed into a pair of dark-colored gauntlets, and Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest shone brightly before a gray armor materialized on his body. He was now fully armed and ready for the fight.Gi-Gyu examined Tae-Shik and thought, \u2018Wow, just how strong is Hyung? It looks like he\u2019s still an active high ranker.\u2019-This Oh Tae-Shik fella sure is strong.-Master, this may be a practice fight, but please be careful anyway.-Master! I\u2019m sure you can win! I just know it!Tae-Shik\u2019s robust aura made Gi-Gyu hesitate, but he realized he wasn\u2019t alone when his Egos encouraged him. He was grateful for the kind words, but that didn\u2019t mean he was now magically strong enough to defeat Tae-Shik. \u2018How is he a retired ranker with that crazy amount of power? \u2019Gi-Gyu only saw Tae-Shik as a middle-aged man in the past; now, he knew better. Tae-Shik did give up his official position as a high ranker and a ranker; obviously, he didn\u2019t stop hunting and training to keep himself sharp.\u201cYou can only see what you know.\u201d When Gi-Gyu whispered, Tae-Shik scratched his ear and asked, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about now?\u201dTae-Shik positioned himself as he gripped his spear firmly. His weapon, nicknamed the Behemoth\u2019s thorn, was one of the few legendary weapons in the world.Gi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just remembered something someone said to me before.\u201d He looked at Tae-Shik, who now stood with a serious face, and his eyes darkened with an ambition to win. Noticing the greed of power in Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, Tae-Shik smiled proudly and murmured, \u201cI like this.\u201dWith a nod, Tae-Shik announced, \u201cI\u2019ll make the first move.\u201d The Behemoth and his thorn flew toward Gi-Gyu faster than a bullet.***Sung-Hoon exclaimed in shock, \u201cWhat the heck happened here?!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 there you are,\u201d Tae-Shik replied in a tired voice.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Sung-Hoon,\u201d Gi-Gyu also murmured weakly. Both Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu were on the floor, so exhausted and severely wounded that they couldn\u2019t even move a finger.Sung-Hoon muttered, \u201cI\u2019m here, but\u2026\u201d He looked around the training hall in disbelief and continued, \u201cWho the hell fought here? Did an S-level monster suddenly appear or something?\u201d\u201cStop talking nonsense and just pour some healing potions on us already,\u201d Tae-Shik ordered in irritation. Grumbling but still obedient, Sung-Hoon did as Tae-Shik commanded.\u201cG-get me some too, Sung-Hoon.\u201d When Gi-Gyu whispered, Sung-Hoon sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dOnce Sung-Hoon poured healing potions on the duo, they were back to normal in just a few minutes. Shaking his head, Tae-Shik murmured, \u201cUwahh\u2026 I thought I was gonna die.\u201dAfter their battle, Tae-Shik used his last bit of strength to call Sung-Hoon. Had he fought Gi-Gyu a minute longer, Tae-Shik knew he would\u2019ve felt too weak to even reach for his phone. Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu would\u2019ve had to wait here long before people began to look for them.Gi-Gyu pouted and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re lying. I know you didn\u2019t use your full force, Hyung.\u201d Gi-Gyu was much stronger now, but he still couldn\u2019t force Tae-Shik into going all out; he couldn\u2019t help grumbling in disappointment.\u201cWow\u2026 Sung-Hoon, I really didn\u2019t want to swear. I really tried to keep things clean, but\u2014\u201d Sung-Hoon interrupted Tae-Shik and asked, \u201cBut what?\u201d\u201cThis bastard became strong enough to almost force me to use my full strength. It took him less than a year to get this far, yet he\u2019s complaining?! What a jerk!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon only sighed, not knowing what to say. He still couldn\u2019t believe this strange situation.Despite what Tae-Shik said, Gi-Gyu still had a long way to go. Tae-Shik\u2019s specialty was his subversive and deadly skills; he couldn\u2019t use them\u00a0against Gi-Gyu right now. So Tae-Shik\u2019s exhaustion was partly from his effort to control his strength not to hurt Gi-Gyu too badly.But this didn\u2019t mean Gi-Gyu was weak by any means.\u2018I almost ended up using it.\u2019\u00a0Tae-Shik shook his head in shock. During their spar, he almost went all out; this fact shocked him to his core.Still feeling the pain, Tae-Shik looked down at his wounds. Despite pouring several bottles of healing potions on himself, his injuries weren\u2019t healing as well as they usually did. Tae-Shik asked, \u201cDo you have some skills from the curse category or something?\u201d\u201cSomething. It\u2019s called Wound Aggregation,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu.\u201cHuh. Never heard of it before.\u201d When Tae-Shik seemed impressed, Gi-Gyu shrugged and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing really. Just some minor skill, that\u2019s all.\u201dIt again reminded Gi-Gyu of just how few skills he had. And the once he had belonged to the buff, debuff, and defense categories. He laid down on the training hall floor and looked around. Just as Sung-Hoon mentioned, they did a number on the place.Rattle\u2026The cement dust from the ceiling was still falling all around. Sung-Hoon announced, \u201cFixing this will cost a fortune. If not for the barrier around this place, everyone in the building would\u2019ve thought we were being attacked.\u201dTae-Shik and Gi-Gyu rested quietly until their eyes met. Tae-Shik asked, \u201cBy the way, what was that thing you used at the end?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I obtained recently, but I don\u2019t think I can use it effectively at this point.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Tae-Shik yelled, \u201cHey! Are you serious? Can\u2019t you see what it did to my spear?\u201dBoth Sung-Hoon and Gi-Gyu looked at Tae-Shik\u2019s spear and saw a tiny scratch on it. Tae-Shik growled, \u201cThis is a legendary weapon, you jerk! It\u2019s supposed to have limitless durability, so I can\u2019t believe you did this to me!\u201dToward the end of their battle, Gi-Gyu\u2019s sword began effusing a violet smoke. Had Tae-Shik not dodged it, thanks to his superior instinct, Behemoth\u2019s thorn could\u2019ve been damaged severely.\"But the repercussions of this skill are too big. I thought I was dying while using it,\u201d Gi-Gyu grumbled in frustration. He used Death for the first time using his own power, and it drained him. He could tell it was a mighty move, but it left every part of him throbbing in pain. Even with the healing potions and the Strong Will skill, his wounds were healing way too slowly.\u201cGosh, you\u2019re such a beast.\u201d Tae-Shik shook his head again as he looked at Gi-Gyu. He stood up and announced, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to get ready now.\u201d\u201cReady for what?\u201d Gi-Gyu rose as well and asked, but Tae-Shik only smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66. The Ranker (2)Tae-Shik replied casually, \u201cI\u2019m talking about registering you as a ranker.\u201d When Gi-Gyu gave him a stupefied look, Tae-Shik added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to be recognized by the public? It\u2019s because you think the public interest is annoying, right? Also, you\u2019re worried that it\u2019ll become easier for your enemies to target you once your face gets known.\u201dAfter a brief thought, Gi-Gyu nodded since Tae-Shik was right. To register as a ranker, a player had to reveal their face to the public. Gi-Gyu was afraid that this would lead to many frustrating, perilous, and dreadful situations, including people like Ironshield recognizing him.When Gi-Gyu seemed hesitant, Tae-Shik reassured him, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about those things.\u201d Tae-Shik seemed to have put a lot of thought into this idea. \u201cRemember, you\u2019re an association mercenary. That means the association can prevent your face from being publicized. Think about it. How do you think the rankers like Lucifer and the old man, I mean Asura, kept their identities hidden for so long? So there is a way to keep your identity a secret from everyone.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed as Tae-Shik continued, \u201cIf that were the only problem, we would\u2019ve registered you as a ranker already. But the bigger issue is your enemies: Do you know how many enemies you\u2019ve made? Consciously and unconsciously? Some of them could be very powerful, which means they would find a way to get to you even if you hid your face. And the association didn\u2019t want that, of course.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cBut based on what I saw during our sparring match today, I think you\u2019ll be fine. I don\u2019t know what might happen if you meet foreign rankers, but at least in Korea, I am certain that it will be tough for anyone to kill you.\u201dTae-Shik recognized how much Gi-Gyu had grown as a player recently; Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling proud. Tae-Shik was someone he respected and admired, so this was a huge deal for him.Tae-Shik added another point, \u201cBesides, you will face many limitations as a mercenary unless you\u2019re officially registered as a ranker.\u201d\u201cAh, I can explain that in more detail to Player Kim Gi-Gyu, General Manager,\u201d Sung-Hoon offered. Being Gi-Gyu\u2019s secretary, Sung-Hoon decided to explain the details to him. \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu, normally, the mercenary position is awarded to players who are at least rankers.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d Gi-Gyu had heard about the requirements for becoming a mercenary. Also, he knew Suk-Woo became a mercenary only after he became a ranker.Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cSo, you getting the mercenary position was an exceptional event. Unfortunately, numerous problems arose due to it.\u201d Sung-Hoon frowned as if annoyed and continued, \u201cTo use the authority given to a mercenary, the player must be at a position important enough that they can meet any association manager whenever they wish.\u201dIt made sense since only the ranker-level players were usually allowed to become mercenaries.\u201cThen Sung-Hoon can explain everything to you, Gi-Gyu. I need to get back to my office to order the repairs for this place and take care of some other stuff.\u201d Tae-Shik found this conversation useless, so he stood up and left the training hall.Gi-Gyu asked Sung-Hoon, \u201cI know rankers can usually request to meet an association manager without any trouble. So you\u2019re saying that the mercenary position just has a slightly higher authority than the ranker position? The kind of authority that the association backs?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d When Sung-Hoon clapped, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling annoyed since Sung-Hoon was treating him like a kid. But he decided not to say anything about it.Sung-Hoon continued, \u201cThe problem is that you don\u2019t hold any sway over the manager-level authorities. Your current position is a very awkward one: You have no status. That\u2019s why the association president put me in charge to vouch for your credential, but it hasn\u2019t been working very well.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ve also noticed that your presence hasn\u2019t been very useful?\u201d When Gi-Gyu commented, Sung-Hoon\u2019s forehead ticked a little. Sung-Hoon smiled and quipped, \u201cBut you could do what you did only because I was there. Anyway, it\u2019s not like you use your mercenary authority much. Hell, the only time you used it was at the Yeosu Gate. So, I think it\u2019s time for you to register as a ranker. Let\u2019s make some changes and turn you into a fully functioning mercenary.\u201dBored, Gi-Gyu yawned and commented, \u201cYou took way too long to explain that. I\u2019m not stupid, so please always get right to the point with me.\u201d\u201cFine, fine. Sure,\u201d Sung-Hoon shrugged, clearly not taking Gi-Gyu seriously.Gi-Gyu stood up and announced, \u201cSo the point is that I need to register as a ranker, right?\u201d\u201cYou got it.\u201dTurning toward Sung-Hoon, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it. No big deal.\u201dOnce Gi-Gyu left the training hall, Sung-Hoon sighed deeply and murmured, \u201cI guess becoming a ranker is no big deal to him. Why do I feel so weak and useless? Gosh\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon\u2019s whining echoed throughout the demolished training hall.***When Gi-Gyu met with Tae-Shik again, Tae-Shik explained that it would take time to register as a ranker. There were two ways to become a ranker, and Tae-Shik went with the option that helped Gi-Gyu the most. Gi-Gyu nodded without a word and left the association building.Now, it was time to return to the Tower.\u201cDeath and assimilation level, check. Just gotta check the rest now.\u201dThe 30th-floor test gave Gi-Gyu a lot of rewards. After his spar with Tae-Shik, he confirmed the extent of his new assimilation grade and familiarized himself with Death.\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much power I\u2019ve gained,\u201d Gi-Gyu thought aloud. All he did was pass a single test, yet the rewards were incredible. Gi-Gyu felt like all of his hard work until now had been finally recognized.What impressed him even more than the stats and the buffs was Death.\u201cIt\u2019s beyond anything I could ever dream of\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured, still unable to believe his luck. He had minimal control over this skill, yet it was enough to scratch Behemoth\u2019s thorn\u2014a legendary weapon. It had to be more than just a mere skill.-Of course. After all, I used to own Death. And if you can control it well, then\u2026Lou trailed off teasingly before continuing,-You could even kill God.\u201cPfft!\u201d Gi-Gyu burst into laughter. Wiping away his tears, he replied, \u201cLou. Ever since you awakened as the Emperor of Black Magic, you\u2019ve been acting more and more like an arrogant teenager.\u201dEl agreed with Gi-Gyu\u2019s assessment.-That\u2019s the perfect way to describe him, Master.With his usual excitement, Brunheart asked,-Teenager! Teenager?! What\u2019s a teenager?! Is it an illness?-Shut up! I\u2019m telling the truth!Lou screamed angrily, but Gi-Gyu just laughed at him even more. He thought, \u2018Kill God? Hahaha\u2014Wait! Doesn\u2019t that mean God really exists?\u2019That was exactly what Lou was insinuating. Then again, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t care whether God existed or not: It changed nothing for him.Shaking his head, Gi-Gyu verbalized all he had to take care of.\u201cCombination and Grant\u2026 Those things Lou obtained when he awakened as the Emperor of Black Magic. That's about it, right?\u201d-You\u2019re talking to yourself again. If someone saw you, they\u2019ll deem you insane.\u201cShut up,\u201d Gi-Gyu warned Lou in annoyance and took a nervous breath. He couldn\u2019t help feeling on edge because he was about to try a brand-new skill.\u201cCombination.\u201d When Gi-Gyu stated out loud, he heard a system announcement.[Please choose the Egos you would like to combine.]\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu hesitated before replying, \u201cLou.\u201d-Hey![You have chosen Lou as the main Ego.][Please pick the sub Ego to be combined with Lou.]\u201cOh! Is it really working?!\u201d-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You bastard!Lou kept screaming, but Gi-Gyu grinned and ignored him. However, after reveling in Lou\u2019s anxiety for a while, Gi-Gyu said, \u201cCancel that. Cancel! Hehehe.\u201d-Haa\u2026 Someday\u2026 Someday! I\u2019m going to beat you up!Lou roared angrily, but Gi-Gyu, apathetic, replied, \u201cNope! Not gonna happen.\u201d Then, with a heavy expression, he announced, \u201cCombination. Main Ego Bi.\u201d The recent system announcement helped Gi-Gyu understand how this new skill worked. The system voice announced again.[You have chosen Bi as the main Ego.]On edge, Gi-Gyu added, \u201cFor sub Ego, I choose\u201d\u2014he gulped\u2014\u201cChoi Won-Jae\u2019s fragment.\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu expectantly waited for the system to make another announcement.***\u201cYou\u2026 called for me?\u201d A husky male voice asked as it entered some guild master\u2019s room. The voice sounded unpleasant, like a nail being dragged across a chalkboard, but the guild master didn\u2019t frown. Instead, the guild master replied, \u201cHave a seat.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Nail-Voice sat down and waited patiently while his guild master pored over some documents. After looking over the papers, the guild master looked up at the man and asked, \u201cSo what was it you wanted?\u201d\u201cI-I would like to go to Korea.\u201d\u201cTo Korea?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Nail-Voice replied with a firm nod.The guild master looked at him with interest and then asked bluntly, \u201cIs it for your revenge?\u201d\u201cY-yes, it is.\u201d\u201cI like your honesty,\u201d the guild master complemented, but there was no emotion in his words. The man stammered, \u201cI-if you insist, I-I am willing to quit this guild. I\u2019m ready to give up everything. I must go to Korea\u2026\u201dNail-Voice was one step away from begging on his knees. The entire world thought his guild master was a fair man, but only Nail-Voice knew the truth: The guild master could be cruel beyond reason if it meant the good of his guild and his safety. That was why he offered to quit the guild. It was a tough decision, but he needed to do this.\u201cFine.\u201d When the guild master replied, the man\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\u201c...!\u201d The man did not expect to receive permission so easily.\u201cGo to Korea,\u201d the guild master repeated with a malicious grin. \"I will establish a branch there, and I shall appoint you as the branch manager. Go do what you need to do.\u201d\u201cT-thank you!\u201d Nail-Voice bowed deep enough for his head to touch the floor, making the guild master laugh.\u201cAnd I will give you my sword,\u00a0Nine.\u00a0Accomplish what you must with this weapon.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d Tears began rolling down Nail-Voice\u2019s face since he knew Nine was a legendary weapon and a holy sword. Before leaving, Nail-Voice couldn't help but bow with each step.The guild master, alone in his office, murmured, \u201cRogers Han.\u201dGuild Master Ironshield watched the closed door and smiled. He stood up as he whispered, \u201cYou must build enough power in Korea so that I can kill that wench later.\u201dIronshield took a few steps, but the way he moved seemed a little awkward.Step, step\u2026The Iron Guild headquarter was inside one of the tall buildings in New York. Ironshield stood in front of a window wall and enjoyed the beautiful city view.\u00a0When the bright light hit him, one could see his right pants leg flutter.***[A fragment cannot act as a sub Ego material.]Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment as he murmured, \u201cGuess this isn\u2019t gonna work.\u201d Thinking carefully, he continued, \u201cBut Egos and egofied figures like Chang-Gyung and Choi Min-Suk will probably work. Or an Ego fragment, not a person.\u201dAfter trying out different combinations in his head, this was the best Gyu could come up with. But before going ahead with it, he asked his Egos for their opinions.-Hmm, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea.Lou replied.-I think there are some risks involved, but I agree with your reasoning, Master.El seemed a little more concerned.And\u2026\u201cBrunheart, your opinion is the most important,\u201d said Gi-Gyu. He was considering Brunheart as the main Ego, so Brunheart\u2019s opinion was what mattered the most. If Brunheart refused to be a part of this, Gi-Gyu would respect his decision.-Umm\u2026Brunheart hesitated. Understanding how his Ego felt, Gi-Gyu said reassuringly, \u201cBrunheart, it\u2019s okay! You can be honest with me. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d-If you say so, then\u2026Gi-Gyu thought about the many risks involved in his decision as he waited for Brunheart to choose. Brunheart wasn\u2019t an ordinary Ego\u2014he gave Gi-Gyu Control and Combination, so Gi-Gyu deemed him the most stable option. After contemplating for a while, Brunheart finally replied,-I\u2019ll do it. I want to be helpful to you, Master. And I think I\u2019ll be able to keep my consciousness if I try.Brunheart\u2019s voice sounded grave, which was unusual. Gi-Gyu patted his chest and replied, \u201cThanks.\u201dGi-Gyu announced again with a serious face, \u201cCombination.\u201d[Please select your main Ego.]\u201cMain, Brunheart.\u201dAnd\u2026[Please select your sub Ego.]\u201cSub, Ego fragment.\u201dGi-Gyu began to emit a faint golden glow.[Combination is now taking place.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67. The Ranker (3)The faint glow circled Gi-Gyu a few times before entering his chest.-M-master!When Brunheart stammered in surprise, Gi-Gyu nervously asked, \u201cBrunheart! Are you okay?\u201d-Master\u2026Brunheart\u2019s voice faded away slowly. Gi-Gyu began to panic and was about to deactivate Combination when he suddenly heard the system\u2019s dry voice.[You\u2019re being transferred to the gate.]Then, everything turned dark.***\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d Once Gi-Gyu regained sight, he immediately realized where he was: Inside Brunheart\u2019s gate.\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Confused, Gi-Gyu murmured; then, he heard an abrupt exclamation,-Master!It was the same cute and immature voice.\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu looked up in the air, but Brunheart didn\u2019t say anything more.[Brunheart and the Ego\u2019s fragment have successfully combined.][The Ego fragment may affect Brunheart\u2019s gate.]Gi-Gyu was standing in the middle of a graveyard. It was the same place he captured the gloomy and rude lich before it turned into the boyish and playful Brunheart. When he looked up, he saw a golden light high up floating toward the crypt.\u201cAm I supposed to follow that?\u201d As if being swayed by an unknown force, his instinct made him follow the light. When he touched the crypt, another system announcement rang in his ears.[This gate does not have a manager.][You can use the Ego fragment from Combination to create a gate manager.][Please set up a gate manager.]Several monster figures popped into Gi-Gyu's mind. It was such a strange situation, but it didn\u2019t surprise him; for some reason, it gave him a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Slowly, he studied each monster.\u2018Zombie goblin, skeleton knight, and\u2026\u2019Since most were from the undead category, Gi-Gyu assumed it was due to the characteristic of Brunheart\u2019s gate. He glossed over many options before he finally found two suitable candidates.\u2018Lich and\u2026\u2019One of them was a carbon copy of the lich he hunted before.\u2018...death knight.\u2019And the other was a death knight with black armor and helmet and a flaming sword. Gi-Gyu remembered reading about this monster in an encyclopedia: A long-dead high ranker created this monster.Gi-Gyu contemplated, \u2018I really like the death knight.\u2019The lich he fought back then was much weaker than he anticipated. On the other hand, even high rankers found killing a death knight hard.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dAfter a moment of hesitation, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI choose the lich.\u201d[Lich has been selected as the gate manager.][The entire Ego fragment has been consumed.][From now on, the lich with manage this gate.]Then, the crypt, the one Gi-Gyu touched, began effusing a blue smoke.-Why did you pick the lich?The death knight was actually the strongest monster Gi-Gyu could think of right now. So, his decision would leave anyone, let alone Lou, confused and curious. He explained, \u201cBecause I was choosing a manager. I\u2019m not sure if the gate manager will ever be involved in a battle. Besides, I lack magic, so I thought it would be better to pick someone smart and of the magic category... \u201dGi-Gyu trailed off, unsure, but he didn\u2019t regret his decision. Since he wasn\u2019t selecting a general or a fighter, he firmly believed that the lich was a better fit for the job.Soon, a lich with a fluttering robe materialized before Gi-Gyu and greeted, \u201cGreetings to you, Grandmaster.\u201dAmused by the monster\u2019s polite behavior, Gi-Gyu laughed. It seemed like only yesterday when he battled a lich; today, he had one being all respectful to him: It felt weird.\u201cUmm\u2026 So you\u2019re the new manager?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cYes, I will be managing this gate from now on,\u201d the lich replied with a bow.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu rubbed his chin before continuing, \u201cDoes that mean you also manage every monster inside this gate? They will follow your order?\u201dThe lich\u2019s answer was unfortunate and unexpected.\u201cNo, that won\u2019t be the case.\u201d\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re the gate manager, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u2018How can a gate manager not control the monsters inside its own gate?\u2019\u201cPlease give me a moment.\u201d The lich waved his hand, and a small status screen appeared in front of Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes.[Gate control level: 1%]The lich explained, \u201cThe current control level is too low for me to dominate the monsters inside. The control level will increase as you, the grandmaster, and I battle the monsters inside this gate. Once the level reaches a certain level, you can summon and control the monsters at will.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded in understanding: He had to clear the gate one more time to get full control. The lich said that it could do it alone, but with Gi-Gyu\u2019s help, things would go much faster.-I must say that your idea is very sound.When Lou commented, Gi-Gyu smiled and replied, \u201cI told you I\u2019m not stupid.\u201dTurning toward the lich again, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cThen do you have any other abilities or skills?\u201d\u201cNot yet\u2026 I apologize for my inutility, Grandmaster\u2026\u201d The lich trailed off shyly\u2014it didn\u2019t suit his gruesome outer appearance. With a smile, Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cThen I better help you get stronger.\u201d***Gi-Gyu asked the lich to follow him outside the graveyard, but it explained that it could not move until it was given a proper name. Since they were inside Brunheart, Gi-Gyu first thought to name the lich Brun, but both Lou and El adamantly opposed it. In the end, the lich was named\u00a0Hart.After naming it, Gi-Gyu could check its status screen; he skipped this step and walked out of the graveyard.The first thing he did was hunt the durahan that protected the graveyard. Despite becoming stronger thanks to all the crystals Gi-Gyu fed the gate, the durahan was no match for Gi-Gyu. Once he killed this monster, the gate control level went up to 3%. Seconds later, the\u00a0durahan regenerated and bowed deeply to Gi-Gyu\u2014it was now in Gi-Gyu\u2019s control.After Gi-Gyu and Hart hunted together for what seemed like days, he murmured, \u201cHart, I can\u2019t believe how useless you are.\u201d\u201cI-I apologize, Grandmaster\u2026\u201dWhen they hunted together, the lich was useful as a knife in a gunfight: Gi-Gyu had to take care of everything. He finally decided to test the lich\u2019s hunting skill, so he let Hart and the newly regenerated durahan battle the skeletons.Hart turned out to be a stick in a gunfight. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cSo it\u2019s clear the durahan is much stronger than you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grandmaster\u2026\u201dThe durahan growled in pleasure, \u201cGrrrr!\u201dFrom what Gi-Gyu had seen, he concluded that the lich\u2019s strength increased with the gate control level. Since it was still low, the lich was a toothpick in a gunfight. Thankfully, as they killed the countless skeletons and formed their army, the gate control level increased quickly.Within two short days, Gi-Gyu achieved a 100% gate control level. He announced in pleasure, \u201cNow you\u2019re much stronger and useful. Don\u2019t you agree, Hart?\u201d\u201cThis is all thanks to you, Grandmaster,\u201d Hart murmured. Gi-Gyu worked like a donkey during the last two days to help Hart get stronger. There were moments when Gi-Gyu thought he saw tears in that lich\u2019s hollow, bony eye sockets. In the end, everything worked out, and it was a now little stronger than when Gi-Gyu first fought it.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo you\u2019ve complete control over this gate now?\u201d\u201cYes. The gate doesn\u2019t have many skills yet, but the monsters inside are now in our control, Grandmaster.\u201dGi-Gyu frowned before asking, \u201cAnd how do I leave this place?\u201d\u201cYou just need to ask Master Brunheart,\u201d replied Hart.To the lich, Brunheart was the owner of this gate. Therefore, Brunheart was its master, while Gi-Gyu, Brunheart\u2019s master, was the grandmaster. Gi-Gyu nodded and announced, \u201cLet me out, Brunheart.\u201d[I\u2019ve been waiting for you to say that, Master!]Brunheart\u2019s voice rang in the form of a system announcement as Gi-Gyu was once again surrounded by total darkness.***\u201cI gotta check one more thing, and then we\u2019ll leave. Combination took so long that I forgot about Lou\u2019s new skill for a second.\u201d Gi-Gyu frowned as he looked down at the worn, old watch on his wrist. He had spent two entire days battling those skeletons: Way more than what he would\u2019ve liked.Lou insisted.-Don\u2019t forget about Grant. We need to try it out too.\u201cI know that.\u201d After replying to Lou, Gi-Gyu yelled, \u201cOpen!\u201dSlowly, Brunheart, embedded in Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest, began to rotate. The gate door opened, and the skeletons jumped out one by one.\u201cUwahhhh!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed in excitement. Previously, they attacked Gi-Gyu on sight; now, they just stared in confusion.Suddenly, lich Hart jumped out and roared, \u201cHow dare you stand so tall in front of Grandmaster? Bow, you morons!\u201dThen, dozens of skeleton soldiers simultaneously kneeled and bowed deeply to Gi-Gyu. His eyes widened in surprise, and he asked Hart, \u201cYou can leave the gate too?\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t know that even the gate manager could leave the gate. The lich explained, \u201cI can do this now because of the gate\u2019s stockpile energy from the crystals.\u201dGi-Gyu promptly ordered, \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you be returning immediately?\u201d\u201cOf course, Grandmaster\u2026\u201d Hart turned around obediently.\u201cYou\u2019re wasting the crystals just by being outside the gate, right? I\u2019ll call you later if I need you,\u201d explained Gi-Gyu. He was satisfied with everything he had learned so far. He now had full control over the monsters inside the gate, and he could even call for the gate manager. Once all the monsters returned to the gate, Gi-Gyu closed it.\u201cThis is basically\u2026\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. He had been so busy increasing the gate control level that only now did he see the parallels.\u201c...a gate break!\u201d \u00a0He just realized two things: He controlled a disaster, and he would never sell another crystal again.***\u201cDid you just leave the Tower?\u201d Tae-Shik asked when Gi-Gyu entered his office. Tae-Shik had something to discuss, so he had been patiently waiting for Gi-Gyu\u2019s return for the past three days.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cYeah. I had to familiarize myself with a few things. Actually, I still have a few left to learn about.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu sounded disappointed, Tae-Shik smiled and told him, \u201cI\u2019m sure you can check those things later. You\u2019re already strong enough. It could be a problem if you become too powerful too fast.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and laid down on the sofa, utterly spent. He entered the Tower after the sparring match with Tae-Shik without taking a rest. And after two days of battling the skeletons, Gi-Gyu needed sleep.Also, Death\u2019s aftereffects were especially long-lasting.\u2018Definitely not something you break a pi\u00f1ata with.\u2019However, Death, as a skill, could deliver a fatal blow to his enemies, so he had to master it somehow.\u201cSo, how did it go?\u201d Gi-Gyu went right to the point. He wanted to return home and rest, so there was no time for chit-chat.\u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019re a ranker now, of course.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in shock, surprising Tae-Shik with his shock. Tae-Shik explained, \u201cWhat did you expect? I did tell you there were two ways to become a ranker, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOne way was to fight another existing ranker to steal his ranker status. The other was to take over a dead ranker\u2019s position with the association\u2019s help. Tae-Shik chose the second method for Gi-Gyu, so Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t have to do much to get this prestigious title.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI feel a little empty now\u2026\u201dEvery player\u2019s dream was to become a ranker. Yet, he became one without much effort, so he found this whole deal a bit surreal.Tae-Shik explained, \u201cFor now, your face is registered only in the Korean association records. Depending on the situation, we may have to release your identity. But the old man has been implementing new policies to clean up the association, so I don\u2019t think you have to worry about your safety.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t worried at all. He knew Tae-Shik and the association president were doing their best to protect him. Besides, Gi-Gyu felt like he was now strong enough to protect himself even if his identity became known. Of course, he wanted to avoid being a public figure at all costs.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you later then,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced. He was so tired that he only desired the warmth of his bed now. He was about to leave the office when Tae-Shik yelled, \u201cHey! You still have to do one thing before it\u2019s official!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68. The Ranker (4)\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gi-Gyu, on his way out, looked back.Tae-Shik replied, \u201cI think an unofficial ranking match is still necessary.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked, genuinely confused by Tae-Shik\u2019s answer. Didn\u2019t Tae-Shik just say he was officially a ranker now since the association acknowledged him as one? So why was he suddenly talking about a ranking match? Gi-Gyu thought hard, but he just couldn't understand.Tae-Shik scratched his cheek, remembering he never explained the proper process. \u201cAh! I guess you don\u2019t know. Do you really think the other rankers will be okay with an association-appointed ranker? They each spent so much effort for that position, so what do you think their reactions would be if the association deemed a random player a ranker? It definitely won\u2019t be \u2018I understand. Have a nice day.\u2019\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head. Now that he thought about it, he realized Tae-Shik was right. He hadn\u2019t been putting much thought into this whole thing, but now, he could understand how annoyed the other rankers would feel.\u2018After all, the rankers and the high rankers have great pride in their position.\u2019There was no way the other rankers would accept Gi-Gyu just because the association ordered it. Tae-Shik explained, \u201cThat\u2019s why an official ranking match must occur. You must battle an existing ranker with at least three other rankers as witnesses. An official match calls for at least three rankers and an audience; your match will be officially unofficial since it will be in an undisclosed place without any audience.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d This setting helped Gi-Gyu hide his identity, so he was okay with this \u201cunofficial\u201d match.\u201cAll right,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied since there was no way to avoid this match. Besides, he was easing up to the idea of public life. Maybe life wouldn\u2019t be so bad even if his identity became public. Tae-Shik announced quietly, \u201cThen I will let you know once I decide on your opponent.\u201dGi-Gyu left with a nod.***Gi-Gyu felt drained, and his fatigue wasn\u2019t something potions could fix. By the time Sung-Hoon dropped him off at his home, he could barely keep his eyes open. The exhaustion from Death and creating a new gate manager took a bigger toll than expected.Gi-Gyu slept for two days straight, not even waking up for meals. It worried his family, but they didn\u2019t wake him up. When he finally woke up, Yoo-Jung asked in shock, \u201cAre you Snow White or something, Oppa?\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d Gi-Gyu, at first, thought he just slept deeply for an hour or two. However, Yoo-Jung\u2019s comment told him he slept for much longer. He looked at the clock before his sister could answer him and murmured, \u201cI only slept for two hours, so what are you talking about?\u201dGi-Gyu remembered returning home at 11 a.m; it was now 1 p.m., which meant he had only slept for two hours. Wasn\u2019t calling him Snow White for that a bit much?Yoo-Jung shook her head and replied, \u201cThat was two days ago.\u201d\u201cT-two days?\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered in confusion. He quickly took out his cell phone, confirmed the date, and murmured, \u201cWhat the heck? How could I have slept that long?!\u201dThe span of Gi-Gyu\u2019s beauty sleep bewildered him, so Lou and Brunheart explained.-Death is harder to control than you think.-Managing my gate takes a lot of energy too, Master!\u2018I thought my stamina has increased significantly because of the elixir and the increased stats, but I guess it\u2019s still not enough.\u2019This reminded Gi-Gyu of how difficult controlling Death would be. When he seemed concerned, Lou reassured.-Don\u2019t worry. Once you get used to them, it won\u2019t waste so much of your stamina.-An average player couldn\u2019t have endured it at all! It only took you two days to recover because of your stats and the elixir, Master!Gi-Gyu shook his head, still feeling frustrated. Worried, Yoo-Jung looked at him and asked, \u201cOppa, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied lightly and put on a jacket. He checked his phone and saw that Tae-Shik and Sung-Hoon had called him earlier. Yoo-Jung continued, \u201cMom\u2019s worried about you too, Oppa. She said she had never seen you sleep this much before. And what\u2019s with your face? Are you angry about something?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m fine, really.\u201dAfter saying that, he left home again.***When Gi-Gyu arrived at the association building, Sung-Hoon greeted him, \u201cIs it true? Did you seriously sleep for two days straight?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I was surprised too,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied lightly and headed toward Tae-Shik\u2019s office. He was about to open the door to Tae-Shik\u2019s office when Sung-Hoon asked worriedly, \u201cBy the way\u2026 Are you angry about something?\u201dGi-Gyu looked at him in confusion and replied, \u201cNo. Why?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI swear. I\u2019m excellent.\u201d Gi-Gyu hadn\u2019t looked in a mirror today, so he wondered if something was wrong with his face. Both Yoo-Jung and Sung-Hoon had asked the same thing, and Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand why.Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad if you\u2019re feeling okay.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSung-Hoon bowed and walked away. It was an odd situation, so Gi-Gyu considered asking Sung-Hoon why he asked such a question; in the end, he dropped the idea in favor of asking Tae-Shik instead.\u201cHey.\u201d Tae-Shik greeted calmly. Gi-Gyu laid down on the sofa and looked at the older man. He still felt a little dazed, probably because he woke up after such a long sleep.Tae-Shik announced with a blank look, \u201cI have one regular news and one bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?\u201dThen, Gi-Gyu realized that perhaps Sung-Hoon already knew about this bad news. And that was why Sung-Hoon asked if he was okay. Sitting up, Gi-Gyu asked with a grin, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201dTae-Shik wasn\u2019t even offering good news with bad news, so why bother picking one over the other? Still a little tired, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t argue and first asked for the regular news.\u201cYour match opponent has been decided,\u201d Tae-Shik replied.\u201cWho is it?\u201dA ranking match was like a spar between two players, i.e., killing was prohibited. So, Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t worried about his life; he was just curious about his opponent.Tae-Shik answered, uninterested, \u201cShin Yoo-Bin.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s the guild master of the Gypsophila Guild. She\u2019s a well-recognized and liked player whom everyone considers a powerful rookie ranker. She is the perfect opponent for you. You\u2019ll fight her in three days, and the old man, Suk-Woo, and I will act as the witnesses.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded, realizing Tae-Shik did everything in his authority to make this match comfortable and convenient for Gi-Gyu.\u2018Three days\u2026\u2019That was more than enough for Gi-Gyu to get ready. His eyes shone brightly, his violet one looking especially sinister. Shivering, Tae-Shik said, \u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me so creepily.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Gi-Gyu was just nervous about hearing the bad news, so why was Tae-Shik calling his look \u2018creepy?\u2019Tae-Shik asked, \u201cAre you angry or something?\u201d\u201cDoes my face look weird today? Why did you ask me that question? Yoo-Jung and even Sung-Hoon said the same thing.\u201d When Tae-Shik asked the same question, Gi-Gyu found his confusion peeking.Tae-Shik pointed at the mirror on the wall with his chin and replied, \u201cGo have a look.\u201dCurious, Gi-Gyu walked to the mirror; when he saw his reflection, he stammered, \u201cW-what the?!\u201d The mirror reflected some man with bloodthirsty eyes and a face-length angry frown. The man, Gi-Gyu, had no idea he was going around with such a menacing look. After looking at his reflection, Gi-Gyu finally understood why everyone asked him if he was angry.Tae-Shik suggested, \u201cYou should control your violent aura.\u201d\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose!\u201d Gi-Gyu screamed in confusion. While staring at his reflection, he tried to control his emotions. Slowly, the fury in his eyes dissipated, and his face returned to normal. He murmured, \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d\u201cI heard you slept for two days straight. Did you have a nightmare or something?\u201d\u2018A nightmare\u2026?\u2019Gi-Gyu felt like he could almost remember the dream, but his head began to pound, so he gave up.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cAll right, fine. Now, here is the bad news.\u201d After Gi-Gyu\u2019s face returned to normal, Tae-Shik continued with a sigh, \u201cIron Guild is creating a branch in Korea.\u201dThe bloodthirst Gi-Gyu managed to control just now burst out with full force.***\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gi-Gyu apologized after finally regaining control over his fury. Tae-Shik pressed his temples as if in pain and replied, \u201cGet a grip over your emotions. I mean, really. If not, you\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu dryly.Shaking his head, Tae-Shik continued, \u201cYou have no idea how much work this single news bought me. Anyway, the Iron Guild is planning on establishing a branch in Korea. Its branch master will be\u2026\u201dTae-Shik rubbed his forehead before murmuring, \u201cRogers Han.\u201d\u201c...\u201d The rage broke out with greater fervor, but Gi-Gyu tried to control it by biting his lower lip and clenching his fists. His fingernails dug into his palms, and his lip began to bleed, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t care.Tae-Shik pleaded, \u201cWe tried our best to stop this. We really did since we know you can\u2019t face the Iron Guild just yet.\u201d Tae-Shik seemed genuinely apologetic because Gi-Gyu was an association mercenary and a close acquaintance. Being helpless to protect him frustrated Tae-Shik greatly.\u201cThe Iron Guild made this request to the Global Players Association.\u201d Tae-Shik explained, \u201cThe old man had some say in this, of course. So, he would've stopped if it were just the Global Players Association, but\u2026\u201dWhen Tae-Shik fidgeted a little, Gi-Gyu knew there was more to this story, so he focused on Tae-Shik\u2019s words.\u201cThe Angela Guild has also gotten involved. The Global Players Association and the Angela Guild requested the Korean association to allow the Iron Guild branch into Korea. The old man could\u2019ve dealt with the Global Players Association, but the Angela Guild\u2026\u201dTae-Shik clenched his fists and apologized, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201c...\u201dA short but heavy silence fell inside Tae-Shik\u2019s office. Soon, an eerie smile appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face, and he said, \u201cActually, this is perfect.\u201d***After hearing the Iron Guild news, Gi-Gyu's whole focus turned toward researching the Iron Guild. He used all of his resources to learn about the Iron Guild, including its overall strength, the number of agents it had sent to its other branches, Rogers Han\u2019s current condition, and Ironshield himself.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he looked over the documents Sung-Hoon handed him. Yes, the association helped him get much of this information.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Ironshield hasn\u2019t appeared in any public event for a long time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFrom their research, they learned that ever since Ironshield left the Maze of Heryond, he hadn\u2019t appeared in public, much less participated in hunts.Sung-Hoon added, \u201cAnd Rogers Han barely survived.\u201d After getting stabbed in the neck, healing potions alone weren\u2019t enough to treat him: High-level healers had to use medical magic to keep him alive. Now, Rogers was back in the field, but he still suffered a huge side effect.\u201cIn terms of strength, their Korean branch would be comparable to the Phoenix Guild,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu as he shook his head. It would be just one of Iron Guild's many branches worldwide, but it would still be powerful enough to be a top ten Korean guild. This reminded Gi-Gyu of just how strong his enemy was.Gazing at Gi-Gyu with worry, Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d During the last three days, Sung-Hoon has witnessed a glimpse of Gi-Gyu\u2019s quiet rage and resentment. After seeing the extent of his anger, Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t help but worry.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWill the association really do what I ask?\u201dSung-Hoon replied without hesitation, \u201cYes. The president, as well as everyone else, is with you on this.\u201d After taking a deep breath, Sung-Hoon added, \u201cWe will do our best to hide everything and anything you do, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a strange way of saying things. You\u2019re making it sound like I\u2019m about to do something illegal,\u201d Gi-Gyu grumbled. Saying the association would help would\u2019ve sufficed, but Sung-Hoon said they would do their best to \u201chide\u201d everything Gi-Gyu did.Sung-Hoon grinned and replied, \u201cGeneral Manager Oh Tae-Shik wanted to kill Rogers Han himself, but the association cannot openly refuse and fight the Global Players Association and the Angela Guild. And if the association makes a big fuss about this, you might get involved in something even worse.\u201dGi-Gyu smiled and answered, \u201cI know. The association is already doing more than enough, so I\u2019m not complaining.\u201dJust then, a familiar voice called his name, \u201cGi-Gyu!\u201dIt was Suk-Woo, so Gi-Gyu waved his hand with a grin. Suk-Woo exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re finally a ranker too! Congrats!\u201d\u201cWell, I need to win this match to become an official ranker. So I think it\u2019s too early for you to congratulate me,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied playfully.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Shin Yoo-Bin is strong, and that\u2019s why everyone calls her the strongest rookie ranker. Don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Gi-Gyu reassured. After hearing about his opponent from Tae-Shik, he made sure to do his research on Shin Yoo-Bin. He had learned more about this rookie ranker than the Iron Guild so far.Suddenly, Gi-Gyu heard loud bickering from the door.\u201cGosh, old man! I told you I got this!\u201d Tae-Shik insisted.\u201cYou said you got it, yet you got nothing done!\u201d Tae-Gu screamed in return.\u201cI\u2019m going to marry the woman I love, so just stop this already!\u201dWhen the two men noticed Gi-Gyu, they waved their hands and greeted him.\u201cHey, Gi-Gyu. You\u2019re here early,\u201d Tae-Shik said to Gi-Gyu.\u201cLong time no see, Young Man,\u201d the association president greeted Gi-Gyu. Everyone related to the ranking match was here except for Shin Yoo-Bin. Currently, they were inside a secret sparring room, similar to the one Tae-Shik and Gi-Gyu battled in, located within the association building. Since it was an unofficial match, it couldn\u2019t occur within the Tower or any other public place.After a few minutes, the door opened again, and Shin Yoo-Bin walked in.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late. Something urgent happened in my guild, so I had to take care of it. I sincerely apologize.\u201d When Shin Yoo-Bin bowed deeply, Gi-Gyu smiled. Looking at her familiar face warmly, he greeted, \u201cIt has been a long time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69. The Ranker (5)\u201c...?\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin, and all the others in the room, stared at Gi-Gyu in confusion. Their eyes widened in surprise, and since Suk-Woo couldn\u2019t control his curiosity, he asked, \u201cDo you two know each other?\u201dRecognizing Suk-Woo, Shin Yoo-Bin bowed lightly and greeted, \u201cYou must be the Cain Guild\u2019s guild master, Yoo Suk-Woo. No, I have never met this gentleman before. This is our first time meeting.\u201dHowever, Tae-Shik realized something, so he nodded and murmured, \u201cI see\u2026\u201dTae-Gu whispered with curiosity, \u201cDo you know something? Do you know how they know each other?\u201dBefore Tae-Shik could explain, Gi-Gyu smiled and clarified, \u201cWe met briefly when you were very young. So I understand that you don\u2019t remember me. Your father\u2019s name is Shin Jung-Chul, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cH-how did you know that?\u201d When Shin Yoo-Bin stammered in surprise, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI was Mr. Shin Jung-Chul\u2019s tutorial guide a long time ago. Four years ago, Mr. Shin Jung-Chul and I became pretty close, so he often visited me to talk about the higher floors even after our partnership ended. Then one day, he introduced me to his daughter, who was my age.\u201dRemembering her late father fondly, Shin Yoo-Bin smiled brightly and answered, \u201cThat was me!\u201d\u201cIndeed. You were in high school at the time. I can see that you\u2019re all grown up now.\u201d Gi-Gyu seemed genuinely happy to see her. While he was researching Shin Yoo-Bin, he learned something fascinating. When he worked as a guide, this one player befriended him by telling him about the higher floors he conquered. But one day, this player stopped calling Gi-Gyu. Later, Gi-Gyu heard from others that this player passed away inside the Tower while battling a monster.Shin Yoo-Bin was this player\u2019s daughter.\u201cAh! I remember! You\u2019re that Guide Oppa!\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin shouted in excitement. But immediately, her eyes widened in shock as she murmured, \u201cBut this can\u2019t be! You were pretty good-looking at the time too, but\u2026 You weren\u2019t this handsome.\u201dGi-Gyu scratched his head and replied, \u201cWell, a lot has happened since then.\u201d\u201cAnd I thought you couldn\u2019t level up either.\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin still seemed shocked, so Gi-Gyu changed the subject. \u201cI heard what happened to your father a long time after it happened\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t attend his funeral and visit you.\u201d\u201cN-no, it\u2019s all right,\u201d replied Shin Yoo-Bin, suddenly feeling shy.Clap, clap!\u201cNow! You can chit-chat later!\u201d Tae-Shik clapped and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the ranking match.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m sorry for my rude behavior.\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin bowed toward Tae-Gu, Tae-Shik, and Suk-Woo.Schwing!Calmly, she unsheathed her sword and announced, \u201cWe can talk later, Oppa.\u201d As serenity embodied her, a torrential magic storm surrounded her. When she lowered her body into a perfect battle position, Gi-Gyu swirled both of his hands and smiled. He murmured, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see how strong you have become.\u201d***\u201cI yield,\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin announced weakly and sheathed her sword; the battle had left her shell shocked.\u201cGood job,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied calmly, and Tae-Gu murmured, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I hope you\u2019ll vouch for Player Kim Gi-Gyu to the ranker association, Miss Shin Yoo-Bin.\u201d When Suk-Woo asked Shin Yoo-Bin, she nodded and answered, \u201cOf course. Please don\u2019t worry about that. Regarding Kim Gi-Gyu\u2019s worthiness as a ranker\u2026 I, the guild master of the Gypsophila Guild, will vouch for him completely.\u201dThere was no question that Gi-Gyu won this battle, hands down. Actually, Gi-Gyu spent most of his strength trying not to hurt Shin Yoo-Bin accidentally. Despite Gi-Gyu not going all out, the fight ended in less than five minutes. Tae-Shik walked up to Gi-Gyu, tapped his shoulder, and congratulated him, \u201cAs of this moment, you\u2019re a real ranker.\u201dTae-Gu, Suk-Woo, and Sung-Hoon all cheered for Gi-Gyu, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d Yoo-Bin also approached Gi-Gyu with a bright smile and murmured, \u201cCongratulations, Oppa.\u201d Feeling shy, Gi-Gyu scratched the back of his head and nodded.\u201cGi-Gyu, I need to leave now. I still have much work left to do. We\u2019ll meet later for a drink, okay?\u201d When Suk-Woo announced, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cOf course. Take care.\u201dEver since Suk-Woo\u2019s guild became a top ten guild, he was swamped with work, so he had to leave immediately after the match.Before leaving, Tae-Gu said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cWhen you get a chance, visit me.\u201d Tae-Shik and Sung-Hoon looked like they wanted to stay longer to talk, but the association president dragged both men out with him.Suddenly, the sparring hall became dead quiet, with only Gi-Gyu and Yoo-Bin standing in its middle. After a long, awkward silence, Yoo-Bin said shyly, \u201cOppa, I\u2019m still so shocked by all this. Are you even the same person I saw back then?\u201dSeveral years ago, Yoo-Bin, her father, and Gi-Gyu had one lunch together, but Yoo-Bin remembered it as well as Gi-Gyu did.With a smile, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHave you been well? I don\u2019t think you were a player four years ago, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. After my father passed away, I got the invitation from the Tower,\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin answered. Impressed, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing. I can\u2019t believe you became this strong in such a short period.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who\u2019s truly amazing, Oppa. I mean\u2026 Weren\u2019t you still working as a guide until recently because you couldn\u2019t level up?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu's eyes widened in surprise. How did Yoo-Bin know about that?\u201cAh! I only know because I have some connections in the association. My father really liked you, so I asked about you out of curiosity.\u201d Shin Yoo-Bin smiled and continued, \u201cWhenever my father got drunk, he would tell me I should marry a guy like you, Oppa. He used to say you\u2019re the perfect guy\u2026 Oops!\u201d Yoo-Bin jumped with a blush. She murmured, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know why I brought that up. I don\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Gi-Gyu waved his hand with a smile.Another silence fell until Yoo-Bin looked up at Gi-Gyu again. As if finally coming to a decision, Yoo-Bin bit her lower lip, walked up to him, and suddenly grabbed his hand. \u201cOppa, you\u2019ll give me your phone number, right?\u201d***-Oppa, it was so lovely to see you today. We should talk more when we get a chance.Gi-Gyu was on his way to meet Tae-Shik when his phone received a text from Shin Yoo-Bin, so he texted back,-Okay.\u2018Player Shin Jung-Chul helped me so much when I worked as a guide\u2026 Yet I didn\u2019t even attend his funeral or visit his family after his passing.\u2019Gi-Gyu felt both happy and guilty after he saw Shin Yoo-Bin. When he was alive, her father was a good friend; sadly, Gi-Gyu learned of his death too late. But even after Gi-Gyu found out about it, he didn\u2019t visit Shin Jung-Chul\u2019s family to console them. Gi-Gyu felt guilty that he didn\u2019t ensure the well-being of Shin Jung-Chul\u2019s family.-What nonsense are you talking about?Lou seemed annoyed as he continued,-At the time, you could barely take care of yourself, let alone your own family, right? I assume this man Shin Jung-Chul was doing much better than you, so why would you feel guilty about this?Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly at Lou\u2019s blunt words. It was hard to hear, but it was the truth. When he heard about Shin Jung-Chul\u2019s death, Gi-Gyu wanted to visit his family. However, he knew he couldn\u2019t be of any help to them, so he avoided visiting.Gi-Gyu murmured defensively, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I know there was nothing I could've done for them back then. But now, I can try to be more helpful to that family.\u201dLou sighed in frustration.-Gosh, you\u2019re such an idiot.Brunheart chimed in.-That\u2019s not true, Lou! Master is so kind!Knock, knock!While his Egos chatted, Gi-Gyu arrived at Tae-Shik\u2019s office.Creak\u2026When Gi-Gyu entered the office, he saw a large bruise on Tae-Shik\u2019s face. It had only been an hour since they saw each other, so the bruise was bewildering.\u201cWhat happened to your face, Hyung?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cCould it be\u2026 Did someone punch you?\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the sight. Thanks to their recent spar, Gi-Gyu knew that Tae-Shik was still a powerful high ranker. All things considered, there was only one person who could hit him like that.\u2018The association president must\u2019ve smacked him.\u2019That was the explanation Gi-Gyu came up with and found irresistibly funny. After all, where else but in a comic act could you find an elderly man punishing his middle-aged son? Then there was the son: Despite being a powerful player, Tae-Shik still acted like a boy in front of his father.Tae-Shik grumbled in a whisper, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did he smack you, Hyung?\u201d\u201cDammit! That old man arranged a blind date for me! I told him I wanted to marry someone I love!\u201d Tae-Shik screamed, vexed.\u201cUmm\u2026Does the president want an arranged marriage for you or something? Maybe for a political reason?\u201d Gi-Gyu found it hard to believe that Tae-Gu would insist on something like this. But Tae-Gu and Tae-Shik lived in high society, so Gi-Gyu was unfamiliar with their lifestyle. Feeling awkward, Gi-Gyu turned a little rigid, but Tae-Shik shook his head as he replied, \u201cNo. He said I can marry the woman I love\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s the problem?\u201dWith that question, an even darker cloud of depression covered Tae-Shik. \u201cHe asked me if the woman I love loves me back, and\u2026 when I said no, he said I would die an old bachelor. He said, \u2018Just said go on a blind date and marry someone right away.\u2019 He has no respect for me! I got so angry that I yelled at him. Then he got so angry that he\u2026 That old man!\u201dWatching a grown man, a giant one at that, tearing up was not a pretty sight. Feeling uncomfortable, Gi-Gyu considered leaving the office for a moment; at length, he sighed deeply.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dFinally making his decision, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHyung! Are you busy nowadays?\u201d\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m always busy.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s eyes shined as he clarified his intention, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking. I just want to know if you have the time to court my mother.\u201dBang!Tae-Shik slammed his desk as if he was ready to break it. He replied, \u201cOf course! Totally! I have time! I have so much time that I don\u2019t know what to do with it!\u201d\u201cThen, you will take care of my mother\u2019s and Yoo-Jung\u2019s schedule. You will take my mom grocery shopping and drive her and Yoo-Jung around. You better take it very seriously.\u201d When Gi-Gyu offered, Tae-Shik stammered, \u201cR-really? You mean that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll convince my mom to let you help around, so\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu\u2019s face grew solemn\u2014 \u201cIf you don\u2019t win her over in six months, you will have to give up on my mom. A man who can\u2019t even date properly will never be able to make my mom happy.\u201d\u201cT-thank you! Thank you, Gi-Gyu!\u201d Tae-Shik jumped like a little child as he shouted. As their conversation dawned on him, he scratched his cheek and murmured, \u201cAhh\u2026\u201dChanging the subject, Tae-Shik announced, \u201cYou\u2019re officially a ranker now. Did you know the association pays a salary depending on your rank among the rankers? Well, that doesn\u2019t matter since the association will take care of that. Just know that being ranker comes with numerous benefits.\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t come here to talk about that.\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s eyes turned serious. A slow grin appeared on his face as he asked, \u201cYou mean you wanna talk about the Iron Guild?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dGi-Gyu was here because he needed to learn more about the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch.Tae-Shik explained, \u201cTonight, all the major news channels will release the facts regarding the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch. Iron Guild has already purchased the building it will use as its headquarter, which means this will happen very quickly.\u201d\u201cWhat about the Global Players Association and the Angela Guild? What are they doing right now?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked.\u201cTo be honest, the Global Players Association isn\u2019t really involved in this. After all, the Global Players Association\u2019s job is to mediate among the associations of different countries. So the main group that\u2019s actually involved is\u2026\u201d Tae-Shik trailed off.\u201cThe Angela Guild.\u201d\u201cIndeed, but according to our research\u201d\u2014Tae-Shik took a pause\u2014\u201cAngela Guild will only participate in this process until the new branch gets established. We don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get involved any more than that. In summary, the Angela Guild will wash its hands of Iron Guild once the branch is established.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded in understanding. These two guilds were never on good terms, so there was only one reason the Angela Guild would help the Iron Guild: They found some common ground.Also, both the guild had been quiet until recently, so it was obvious they together decided to take action simultaneously. And to fight the Iron Guild, Gi-Gyu needed to figure out why.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70. The Calm Before the StormOnce the news about Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch broke out, all Korean news channels went wild.-The Iron Guild! It has arrived in Korea!-The Angela Guild and the Iron Guild plan to work together!-Who will be the branch manager of the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean office?-What will the Iron Guild profit from its Korean branch?Many showed interest in this news since it had both pros and cons. A world-class guild inside Korea meant the country would be a little safer. However, it also meant the other resident guilds had to give up many of their rights to the Iron Guild.-Why did the Korean association allow this?-Why isn\u2019t the government stopping this?-Does the Angela Guild have more power and authority than the Korean government and the Korean Players Association?Just as many welcomed the new branch, many were also against it. At first glance, a guild branch looked like a business; however, it was more of an elite group of players on foreign soil. Usually, this group was stronger than most nations\u2019 armies, so accepting a foreign army into Korea had to be a difficult decision.But the Iron Guild had no problem getting their request approved, thanks to the Angela Guild. Meanwhile, the Angela Guild\u2019s guild master, Lee Sun-Ho, had also not made a public appearance in a long time now. There were rumors that he was severely injured, but many people began to doubt this story. After all, how could an injured person sway the Korean government and the Korean Players Association (KPA)?Ring, ring, ring...\u201cHello?\u201d Gi-Gyu answered his cell phone.-I found him.Sung-Hoon replied without first greeting Gi-Gyu. However, he didn\u2019t care since he knew exactly what Sung-Hoon was talking about. \u201cAll right.\u201dJust a few days after becoming a ranker, Gi-Gyu was, once again, leaving his house.***\u201cWhy do you think he wanted to meet here?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cEasy to escape? Paparazzi are such sneaky people,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu as he looked around. Currently, they were in a small town in Hanam City, which was destroyed by a recent gate break. Lagging on repairs, the entire town had nothing but damaged buildings. It was a dark and eerie sight with not a single living thing brightening the place.Watching the sad scene in front of him, Gi-Gyu caressed his chest. He wondered, \u2018If I open Brunheart\u2019s gate completely, will it cause similar damage?\u2019Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t certain since many factors resulted in such a disaster: It was a B-grade gate, the association didn\u2019t react in time, and many more.Gi-Gyu was thinking about this and that when Sung-Hoon suddenly asked, \u201cAre you a pervert or something?\u201dSung-Hoon gave Gi-Gyu a strange look and muttered, \u201cWhy do you keep caressing your chest?\u201dSmiling widely, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cYou have quite a talent, Sung-Hoon.\u201d\u201cTalent for what?\u201d\u201cAnnoying me enough to make me want to smack you!\u201d When Gi-Gyu stepped forward menacingly, Sung-Hoon jolted in fear and backed away. Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cWow, you\u2019re now officially a tyrant, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dWhen Sung-Hoon shook his head as if embarrassed, Gi-Gyu smiled and said, \u201cI was just joking.\u201d\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t sound like you were joking,\u201d Sung-Hoon grumbled.Looking down at his watch, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cHe should\u2019ve been here by now. Are all paparazzi horrible at keeping promises?\u201d\u201cWell, they are known to be unmanageable,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied in annoyance. Thinking they had to wait a bit longer, Sung-Hoon announced, \u201cWe have three months left now.\u201dThe Iron Guild members would arrive at their Korean branch in three months. Despite the pressure from the Angela Guild and the Global Players Association, the Korean Players Association (KPA) bought Gi-Gyu this precious time.With a shrug, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThree months should be more than plenty.\u201d During this time, he planned on preparing himself to kill Rogers Han. And he was here as the first step toward his successful plan.\u201cHaa\u2026 Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being arrogant? We\u2019re talking about destroying a group that\u2019s as strong as a top ten Korean guild\u2026\u201d When Sung-Hoon trailed off, Gi-Gyu looked up in the air. With determination in his eyes, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cBut we must do it. We have no other choice.\u201dBefore Sung-Hoon could make another comment, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI think he\u2019s finally here.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Sung-Hoon seemed confused as he looked up to where Gi-Gyu was looking.Gi-Gyu said to the air, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s rude to be this late?\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late.\u201d Suddenly, the air above them split, and a faint figure appeared from it. The newcomer was about 170 centimeters, had messy hair, thick glasses covering much of his face, and looked like a beggar.\u201cYou\u2019ve ruined all the fun, so you better take responsibility.\u201d When Gi-Gyu joked, Sung-Hoon looked at him in confusion.***Modern society was an ocean of information before the Tower, the gates, and the players appeared. Except for the top-secret data that belonged to governments or powerful corporations, one could find most information online. The reporters were especially very active figures who released various sensitive news for profit.However, the world changed once those mysterious structures and powers appeared. Information involving the non-players remained accessible, but anything regarding the Tower and the gates became a mystery to the public. Any and all information about the high-level players became a top-secret.This was how the player paparazzi came about. They were once players, but they now acted as freelance reporters to expose information about the Tower and the gates.Being a player paparazzi was a lucrative business, so many skilled players turned to it; only one was considered legendary. This paparazzo could get any information he wanted, and he even forced the KPA\u2019s president, Oh Tae-Gu, into making a deal for the masked player\u2019s photos.This infamous player paparazzo\u2019s name was Go Hyung-Chul.Gi-Gyu asked the man floating in the air, \u201cAre you Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s contact?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Go Hyung-Chul only accepts requests through me,\u201d the messy-looking man replied firmly. Now that the contact was a bit closer, Gi-Gyu finally realized what a skilled player the contact was. Since Go Hyung-Chul used such a powerful player as a contact, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder how strong Go Hyung-Chul himself was.Gi-Gyu asked him, \u201cCan you come down? All this looking up is hurting my neck.\u201dWith a nod, the man slowly floated down to the ground.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019 Curious, Gi-Gyu studied the man before shaking his head. \u201cI have a request for Player Go Hyung-Chul. It\u2019s a big job with high risk, so I would like to talk to him in person.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d the man refused swiftly. He explained, \u201cHe only accepts the requests that go through me. I also have the power to accept or deny requests, so please feel free to speak to me.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu became quiet as he fell into deep thoughts. Sung-Hoon suddenly grabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s sleeve and whispered, \u201cThis is too risky, Player Kim Gi-Gyu. If others found out your request\u2026\u201dSung-Hoon trailed off as he eyed the man, but the contact seemed uninterested. He just looked at Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon blankly.However, Gi-Gyu had made up his mind, so he reassured, \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201dGi-Gyu then turned toward the man and explained, \u201cI\u2019ll first let you know the compensation I\u2019m willing to pay. Five billion upfront and ten billion won when I get the requested information. The total payment will be 15 billion won if he succeeds.\u201dThis was everything Gi-Gyu had at the moment. He was glad he saved most of his wealth and didn\u2019t spend it on unnecessary stuff. He felt a little apologetic toward his family because he had told them they were rich now. However, this was necessary to protect them.The contact, indifferent till a moment ago, seemed very interested now. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the request?\u201dGi-Gyu grinned a little as Sung-Hoon murmured worriedly, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu\u2026 Are you sure this is a good idea?\u201dGi-Gyu promptly replied, \u201cI believe the Angela Guild and the Iron Guild have made some kind of deal. Please find out what it is.\u201d\u201c...!\u201d The contact, indifferent first and a bit interested later, was now gaping like a fish. He stammered, \u201cA-are you crazy?\u201dIt was an insane choice, but it was the only one Gi-Gyu had. After all, asking Go Hyung-Chul to keep a secret was akin to asking a news outlet not to reveal a piece of spicy news.However, the variable to constant ratio of this Korean branch thing was massive. Why was Rogers Han being sent as the branch manager? Why did the Angela Guild help Iron Guild? Were they allies now? What did it mean for Korea as a nation since even Association President Oh Tae-Gu couldn\u2019t stop them? Gi-Gyu needed to know why the Angela Guild was siding with the Iron Guild, especially when they were never on good terms before.\u2018I must do this for my revenge.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought in determination. If it helped, he was even willing to sell his soul to the devil.The man, clearly appalled, began to float away as he replied, \u201cI refuse your request.\u201dBut to his surprise, Gi-Gyu grabbed the man\u2019s ankle as he stated, \u201cYou can refuse if you want, but\u2026\u201dThe man flailed mid-air, but Gi-Gyu had a firm grip on his leg. Gi-Gyu continued with a grin, \u201cMr. Go Hyung-Chul, please come down before I beat you up real good.\u201d***The man gasped and denied, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?! I\u2019m not Mr. Go Hyung-Chul!\u201dHowever, Gi-Gyu just pulled the contact down like plucking an unwilling fruit. With a loud thud, the man fell, scattering dirt everywhere. Meanwhile, Sung-Hoon just watched with his jaw on the floor, failing to even comprehend such an unexpected turn of events.Gi-Gyu quickly approached the contact and reached out.\u201cBinding.\u201d When Gi-Gyu announced, Oberon shot a black stem toward the contact. Surprised by Gi-Gyu\u2019s new skill, Sung-Hoon murmured, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu\u2026?\u201dGi-Gyu gained this skill after Lou awakened as the Emperor of Black Magic.[Black Magic: The power of black magic can be granted to an Ego.]Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t understand much from the description, but trial and error gave him an explanation: Depending on the Ego and its abilities, he could add Black Magic to them and create a new skill. As Gi-Gyu and his Egos became stronger, the skill was bound to be useful.Black Magic with Oberon gave rise to a new skill called Binding.[Binding: Binds the enemy with Black Magic.]The contact flailed helplessly to free himself, but Binding\u2019s strength was directly proportional to Gi-Gyu\u2019s strength, so he couldn\u2019t do anything.Gi-Gyu chuckled before commenting, \u201cMr. Go Hyung-Chul, how could you try to flee after hearing my request?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu walked up to him slowly, the contact, Go Hyung-Chul, insisted, \u201cWhat are you talking about?! I\u2019m just a\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no need to act anymore.\u201d With an eerie calmness in his eyes, Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI can see everything.\u201dLou muttered in displeasure as Gi-Gyu\u2019s violet eye shined brighter than usual.-Gosh, I have to admit that this ability is unbelievable.[Go Hyung-Chul]Gi-Gyu could see the man\u2019s name floating above him through his violet eye like a status screen. Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s unusual eye color, Go Hyung-Chul gasped and screamed, \u201cY\u2026you have the\u00a0evil eye?\u201dAs if in surrender, Go Hyung-Chul closed his eyes and murmured, \u201cI knew it! I knew there was a connection between you and Lucifer! But still\u2026 How?!\u201dPoof!The stem that trapped Go Hyung-Chul shattered: He was now free. However, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t move, and when the magic dust settled, Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon could finally see the real Go Hyung-Chul. He no longer looked like a beggar; instead, he looked dapper: Clean hair, sleepy eyes, firmly closed lips, and red eyes. Go Hyung-Chul looked at Gi-Gyu with interest and offered, \u201cI am interested now. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d Even his voice and speech pattern were different.The legendary paparazzo, Go Hyung-Chul, was ready to talk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71. The Calm Before the Storm (2)Sung-Hoon groaned as he murmured, \u201cSo that man is Go Hyung-Chul\u2026\u201dHowever, neither Gi-Gyu nor Go Hyung-Chul paid him any attention. Go Hyung-Chul murmured again, \u201cSo you have the evil eye.\u201d\u2018No wonder he is the legendary paparazzo\u2026\u2019\u00a0Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s familiarity with the evil eye surprised Kim Gi-Gyu. After Lou awakened as the Emperor of Black Magic, Gi-Gyu\u2019s violet eye, a gift from Lucifer, turned into an evil eye. Awakening an evil eye was no cakewalk, but Lou helped Gi-Gyu awaken it.The evil eye had a simple function: It helped Gi-Gyu see right through someone for what they were. As he became stronger, it could also help him see a person\u2019s name, dispositions, and other characteristics. But for now, all he could see was the person\u2019s name.Go Hyung-Chul announced, \u201cI ready for a deal.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ll accept my request?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.\u201cYes, but you must pay more. The risk involved and my pay aren\u2019t comparable.\u201d\u201cYou were going to sell my information and photos to the highest bidder, weren\u2019t you? Why don\u2019t you do this for me, and we\u2019ll call it even.\u201d When Gi-Gyu offered, Go Hyung-Chul yawned and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201dRumor had it that Go Hyung-Chul was close to becoming a high ranker; he belonged to the assassin category. The rumors seemed true because Gi-Gyu could\u2019ve never deduced the contact was Go Hyung-Chul if not for the evil eye. Even his improved magic sense failed to pick up the strength hidden by the assassin category.Not too long ago, Go Hyung-Chul sold a photo of Gi-Gyu exiting the Yeosu Gate to the media. Gi-Gyu thought he could guilt trip this man into helping him, but Go Hyung-Chul didn\u2019t seem apologetic.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo what can I give you instead?\u201dThis was a crucial deal for Gi-Gyu, so he needed Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s help, especially now that he had disclosed his request. If they didn\u2019t make a deal and Go Hyung-Chul disclosed his request, it would have disastrous consequences.Go Hyung-Chul studied Gi-Gyu with interest. His eyes smiling, the paparazzi asked, \u201cTell me about your relationship with Lucifer. And what can the evil eye do?\u201dRevealing such sensitive information could land him in hot water with Lucifer, but he promptly replied, \u201cI am Lucifer\u2019s pupil, and the evil eye allows me to look right through a person.\u201dGo Hyung-Chul\u2019s bored expression turned into shock, and he murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u2026 Why would you tell me something like that straight on?! Haa\u2026 I guess you\u2019re at least telling me the truth.\u201d Unlike what the rumors suggested, Go Hyung-Chul wasn\u2019t omniscient. Gi-Gyu\u2019s relationship with Lucifer was news to him, and the ease with which he got the news shocked him.\u201cHahaha!\u201d Go Hyung-Chul laughed loudly and said, \u201cI will consider myself paid. I guess I\u2019ve to accept your request now. Once I find the information, I will contact you.\u201dAnd with that, Go Hyung-Chul disappeared into thin air.Shaking his head in disbelief, Sung-Hoon muttered, \u201cHa! I don\u2019t even know what to think.\u201d Gi-Gyu's reply was a simple, bitter smile.***After meeting Go Hyung-Chul, Gi-Gyu sped up the cogs in his plan. He still had three months, but Gi-Gyu knew in his heart of hearts that was anything but enough. Gi-Gyu knew he would have to spend every waking moment working to achieve what he wished.His destination after meeting Go Hyung-Chul was Suk-Woo\u2019s guild. When he arrived at the 30+ story building, a security guard stopped him at the entrance.\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d the security guard, wary.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c...\u201d The security guard didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he picked up the phone and asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cYour name, please?\u201d\u201cKim Gi-Gyu.\u201dThe guard made a quick call. After hanging up, he bowed deeply to Gi-Gyu and announced, \u201cSomeone will be down to escort you upstairs shortly.\u201d The person on the other end must have told the guard something about Gi-Gyu because his attitude did a complete 180.Ding!Then, Gi-Gyu heard the elevator door open and saw several people exit it. One of them yelled in excitement, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d\u201cPlayer Do Bong-Gu! Hello!\u201d Gi-Gyu waved his hand toward the familiar figure. Do Bong-Gu was the Cain Guild\u2019s guide he helped in the Tower fight against the Smurf Guild. Soon, Do Bong-Gu and five other players scampered to Gi-Gyu.Other guild members walking nearby saw the interaction between Gi-Gyu and Do Bong-Gu. They seemed very interested as they murmured among themselves.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?\u201d one player asked.\u201cWow! That\u2019s the head of the guides, Player Do Bong-Gu, right?\u201d another exclaimed with excitement.\u201cWho\u2019s he talking to?\u201d a guild member nearby whispered.Gi-Gyu ignored the audience and asked Do Bong-Gu, \u201cI guess you got a promotion?\u201d\u201cYeah, it just happened,\u201d Do Bong-Gu replied shyly as he scratched his head.\u201cIs your leg all right?\u201d Gi-Gyu remembered Do Bong-Gu losing a leg during that Smurf Guild fight. Thanks to Yoo Suk-Woo\u2019s special skill, his amputated leg was found among the numerous pile of limbs. Since he was walking without a limp now, Gi-Gyu suspected the leg was reattached successfully.Do Bong-Gu replied, \u201cYes. I would like to apologize for not thanking you properly that day. Most of our guild members returned home safely because of you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dThe lobby was filled with people, but Do Bong-Gu didn\u2019t care and bowed deeply, followed by the other five players behind him.This resulted in an even louder chatter from the passersby. After all, the Cain Guild was now a top ten guild, so they wondered who commanded such respect from Do Bong-Gu, the head of all Cain Guild guides.Still ignoring their audience, Gi-Gyu, Do Bong-Gu, and his entourage, got on the elevator.***Suk-Woo was buried in piles of documents as he sat at his desk. When he saw Gi-Gyu enter, he greeted, \u201cHey, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cWahh! You do this much work every day?\u201d When Gi-Gyu exclaimed in shock, Suk-Woo replied with a tired grin, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. At least not for a while\u2026\u201dUntil his guild became secure in its new place, Suk-Woo knew he would be swamped with never-ending work. Because everything happened so fast, Suk-Woo didn\u2019t get the time to employ people who could help him with the workload. Consequently, he was stuck with most of the paperwork for now.Suk-Woo apologized, \u201cCould you give me a minute to finish this?\u201d When Gi-Gyu nodded, Suk-Woo continued on with the documents. He was working at an incredible speed, but Gi-Gyu knew this wouldn\u2019t lead to an oversight.\u2018He\u2019s such a workaholic.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu shook his head and closed his eyes for a moment. While he waited patiently, he remembered the first time he met Suk-Woo. Back then, they were both going through a difficult phase: Suk-Woo was looking for a better life, and Gi-Gyu was trying to climb out of poverty. Because of this similarity, Suk-Woo and Gi-Gyu quickly became friends.\u2018Suk-Woo really considers his guild his family.\u2019\u00a0While Gi-Gyu had his family, Suk-Woo had his guild. A long time ago, he told Gi-Gyu that although he had a family, he didn\u2019t stay in contact with many of them. So the Cain Guild was basically Suk-Woo\u2019s family.After finishing his paperwork, Suk-Woo finally looked up and apologized, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for making you wait.\u201d Then, he joined Gi-Gyu on the sofa.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cNo worries. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really busy, so I should be apologizing for bothering you.\u201dBefore coming here, Gi-Gyu had already told Suk-Woo on the phone what he wanted. Now, it was time to hear Suk-Woo\u2019s answer.Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201dSuk-Woo\u2019s face turned rigid as he contemplated. The decision he was about to make could ruin his precious guild beyond repair. This was why Gi-Gyu made a business offer rather than ask Suk-Woo as a friend.Gi-Gyu reminded Suk-Woo about what he offered, \u201cIf you agree to this, there will be two main benefits to your guild. First, after the Iron Guild branch is destroyed, most of its rights will be re-routed to the Cain Guild. Second, I will do you one favor without question in the future.\u201dGi-Gyu asked the Cain Guild to fight the Iron Guild with him because Suk-Woo was vital to his plan. In return, the Cain Guild would obtain significant benefits.\u201cAnd what you need me to do is\u2026\u201d Suk-Woo trailed off before continuing, \u201cDeal with the Iron Guild branch members? Just the regular players and not the elite ones?\u201d\u201cYes, that will be a huge help.\u201dAfter a few moments of silence, Suk-Woo nodded and replied with a smile, \u201cAll right. I guess this means the Cain Guild and the mercenary Morningstar are allying.\u201dGi-Gyu smiled as well as he stood up. He offered his hand and said to his friend, \u201cThanks, Suk-Woo.\u201d They shook hands, and the alliance was officially formed.***Gi-Gyu was relieved after completing two of the most important tasks. Firstly, he found Go Hyung-Chul and had him research the Angela guild. Secondly, he ensured the Cain Guild players would take care of the Iron Guild branch players.At first, Gi-Gyu considered using his gate monsters to deal with the Iron Guild players, but he needed his skeleton soldiers for something else. So, all in all, everything was working out as he wished.His last task for that day required him to go to the association building. This time, he wasn\u2019t here for Tae-Shik; he was here to ask for help from KPA\u2019s president, Oh Tae-Gu.\u201cCome in,\u201d Tae-Gu announced when he saw Gi-Gyu standing outside his office; Gi-Gyu entered with a smile.\u201cYou surprise me every time I see you, Young Man.\u201d Tae-Gu sat on the sofa and added, \u201cSoon, you\u2019ll be able to use your code name Morningstar more openly. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have much to talk about then.\u201dGi-Gyu knew instinctively that the president was talking about him becoming a high ranker soon.Oh Tae-Gu asked, \u201cSo is your plan going well?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cYou have chosen such a hard path to follow.\u201d\u201cI had no other choice.\u201dTheir conversation was as vague as it could be.Oh Tae-Gu explained, \u201cAs you must\u2019ve already heard from Sung-Hoon, the association will act as a bystander once all hell breaks loose.\u201dActing as a bystander would free the KPA (Korean Players Association) of all responsibilities. Sadly, this was the best KPA could do for Gi-Gyu since a country\u2019s association branch couldn\u2019t bully the little guy, which were the guilds in this case. All countries\u2019 association branches had some say in which foreign guild could enter their land. However, once inside, the association couldn\u2019t interfere with the foreign guild unless they were ready for an international conflict. In the worst-case scenario, there could be significant bloodshed.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I need, Sir.\u201d He felt so relieved that he didn\u2019t have the association as his enemy. Just having the association turn a blind eye would be a huge help to him.\u201cBut there is one more thing I need, Sir.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Tae-Gu moaned a little and asked, \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d\u201cI need you to provide absolute control over the area,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cAbsolute control?\u201dCurrently, the association was helping Gi-Gyu move secretly while protecting his identity. But Gi-Gyu wanted more from the association president.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI want a wide perimeter around the Iron Guild branch headquarters to be blocked completely. Evacuate all citizens and make sure no other guild can enter this area. Will this be possible?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu asked cautiously, Tae-Gu\u2019s face remained emotionless. The president murmured, \u201cThat kind of control\u2026\u201dAfter a sigh, Tae-Gu continued, \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy unless there is a gate break\u2026 To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t even try because I know it won\u2019t be successful.\u201dTae-Gu\u2019s answer was firm. His eyes a little darker now, Gi-Gyu asked quietly, \u201cThen let me ask you a different question.\u201dHis eyes unwavering, he continued, \u201cIf there\u00a0is\u00a0a gate break in the area, will you be able to block the perimeter completely?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72. The Calm Before the Storm (3)\u201cAre you saying you can cause a gate break at will?\u201d Tae-Gu asked with a tense face.\u201cNot exactly a break.\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s reply brightened Tae-Gu\u2019s face visibly. It was an expected reaction since every country had tried to weaponize the gates since their inception. After all, controlling gate break was synonymous with having a nuclear bomb. Thankfully, no one had succeeded so far.\u201cBut something similar.\u201d When Gi-Gyu said that, all the brightness left Tae-Gu\u2019s face, leaving only darkness and concern behind.***Gi-Gyu and the association president had a long conversation about Gi-Gyu\u2019s power and plan for the Iron Guild\u2019s branch.\u201cHuh\u2026 Your growth seems limitless. Now you can even control gate monsters thanks to those Egos\u2026 I wish I could steal such power,\u201d Tae-Gu murmured greedily.\u201cSir, I can\u2019t believe you just said that!\u201d When Gi-Gyu exclaimed, Tae-Gu replied, \u201cI\u2019m only saying it because I know it\u2019s impossible. But you should be careful. Many in the world wouldn\u2019t understand or accept your power. Always be careful about what you say.\u201d\u201cI will remember your advice, Sir,\u201d Gi-Gyu answered with a smile. Tae-Gu seemed exhausted as he murmured, \u201cSo you need me to provide absolute control over the area\u2026\u201dTae-Gu trailed off before nodding. \u201cAll right. I will do it.\u201d\u201cThank you, Sir!\u201d Gi-Gyu shouted. The KPA (Korean Players Association) was an essential component of his plan since only they could block off an area.Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t after just Rogers Han: His goal was to destroy the entire Iron Guild eventually. But first, he had to target the Korean branch. Gi-Gyu was a realist, so he knew that he couldn\u2019t destroy the entire branch even with the Cain Guild\u2019s help. After all, its strength was comparable to that of the top ten guilds in Korea.\u2018But if my plan works\u2026\u2019If everything went without a hitch, he would cause the Iron Guild fatal damage. His lips curled up into a vicious grin as his mind raced. Gi-Gyu asked Tae-Gu, \u201cAnd I have one more favor to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tae-Gu asked easily. A few factors made Tae-Gu side completely with Gi-Gyu: Iron Guild\u2019s attempt to branch out in Korea, the minimal authority KPA would have over this foreign branch, as well as the Global Players Association (GPA) and the Angela Guild\u2019s involvement. Angela Guild\u2019s dominance in Korea forced Tae-Gu to allow the Iron Guild branch\u2019s entrance, but he had hoped to defy it one way or the other. Consequently, he was pleased to hear Gi-Gyu\u2019s plan. If things worked out the way Gi-Gyu wished, Tae-Gu could get his revenge against the Angela Guild without getting directly involved. Since he had nothing to lose, he accepted Gi-Gyu\u2019s request for help.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI need money and crystals. Of course, I\u2019m not asking for them for free\u201d\u2014he took a pause\u2014\u201cI would like to receive as many requests as possible from you, Sir. I would prefer all missions that reward abundant crystals and money. I want to use my position as a mercenary to get what I need.\u201dGi-Gyu still had almost three months left to prepare, so he had to get to work immediately.***As soon as Tae-Gu began giving him tasks, Gi-Gyu became very busy. Today, he had to clear another gate, so he went straight to the location with Sung-Hoon.\u201cAre you Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d When the on-site gate manager asked, Gi-Gyu nodded and showed his ring. The manager stammered in awe, \u201cS-so you\u2019re an association mercenary!\u201dKnowing Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to waste any time, Sung-Hoon quickly stepped up. He said to the manager, \u201cFrom now on, you can talk to me, Sir. I\u2019m Morningstar\u2019s secretary.\u201d\u201cO-of course\u2026\u201d replied the manager with a trembling voice after checking the ring. While Sung-Hoon and the gate manager chatted, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI\u2019ll get right to it.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, Player Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d After hearing Sung-Hoon, Gi-Gyu nodded and promptly jumped into the gate.Closing an exceptional gate was usually the most profitable; sadly, they were rare. The only gates available nearby were normal ones, but the association only took responsibility for the tricky cases. The tricky ones usually were either of a high difficulty level, or with monsters which other players liked to avoid, or with unusually complicated architecture.The association also dealt with the gates that were about to break. Many reasons could lead to a gate not being closed before their break. Such gates were always a huge public concern; therefore, the executive department or the Department of Gate Maintenance took care of them.To make money, Gi-Gyu decided to take on these time-sensitive gates.Sung-Hoon looked at his watch and murmured, \u201cHe\u2019s a little late today.\u201dThe manager exclaimed in confusion, \u201cPardon? But it has only been an hour since he went inside!\u201d Sung-Hoon answered with a wordless smile and continued to watch the gate. About ten minutes later, everyone there except Sung-Hoon gasped in shock because the gate began closing.\u201cW-what the?!\u201d the manager stammered. In disbelief, he turned toward Sung-Hoon and asked, \u201cB-but didn\u2019t he go alone?\u201d\u201cHe did.\u201d Sung-Hoon shrugged nonchalantly. It was a B-grade gate, so, usually, most guilds would take days to close it. However, a single player cleared it in an hour or so\u2014How could they not be shocked?As the gate closed slowly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s silhouette appeared. Sung-Hoon lit a cigarette and hummed as he asked, \u201cNever seen an association mercenary, huh?\u201dRiding on someone else\u2019s coattails sure was fun.***\u201cWould you like to drink with me?\u201d Sung-Hoon offered Gi-Gyu a can of beer. Gi-Gyu silently accepted it, opened the can, and watched the river near the Ttukseom Hangang Park.It had been a month since he began touring various gates to make extra money.Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cSo, have you completed all the requests?\u201d\u201cYes, I closed all of them,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu with a shrug. Oh Tae-Gu had named 18 gates the association was having difficulty closing. None of them were A-grade, but they were still anywhere from B to C-grade, which meant they weren't easy gates to close. No one could deny that closing so many gates within a month was amazing.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI wish there were more for me to close, but I guess it will do since I don\u2019t want to go outside Korea to do more.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201d Sung-Hoon looked at him in disbelief. When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond, he changed the subject. \u201cTwo months left now.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s eyes turned eerie as Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cWhat are your plans for the last two months?\u201d\u201cWell\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu took a sip of his beer\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve collected all the crystals I need, but\u2026 I guess I can go to the Tower for some more.\u201dOh Tae-Gu could only give the tricky gates to Gi-Gyu because everyone wanted to clear the normal or easy-to-clear gates. Also, many guilds depended on the profit from these easy gates, so he couldn\u2019t let a single player monopolize all the gates, tricky and otherwise.Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cThen there is the stuff I got recently: I\u2019ve to organize it too. Hmm\u2026 I think the time will pass by quickly.\u201d\u201cI suppose,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied indifferently. With a shrug, he added, \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing so well recently, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine.\u201dGi-Gyu finished the beer with a grin, crumpled the can, and looked for a trash bin. Even after looking for a while, he couldn\u2019t find one, so he frowned and murmured, \u201cOpen.\u201dSuddenly, a blue light appeared on top of Gi-Gyu\u2019s shirt. Gi-Gyu threw the beer can inside Brunheart\u2019s gate and shouted, \u201cTake this can and throw it in a trash bin!\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon could only sigh as he watched the ridiculous scene.-Master! I\u2019m not a trash bin!!!Brunheart grumbled, but Gi-Gyu just grinned and raised his hand toward Sung-Hoon. Dazed, he handed his empty beer can to Gi-Gyu, who threw it inside the gate.\u00a0Gi-Gyu felt certain that his gate manager lich, Hart, would train the skeletons well enough to take care of the beer cans.Sung-Hoon murmured, \u201cWhenever I\u2019m with you, I feel like I\u2019m living in a different world, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dShrug.Gi-Gyu shrugged without a word. He acted calm, but there was a storm raging inside his heart.\u2018Anything can happen in these two months. Damn! The anxiety is killing me.\u2019Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t doubt his ability to defeat Rogers: He worried about the other cogs since it wouldn\u2019t be a simple 1v1. His enemy was invading his territory, and it was his duty and pleasure to get rid of the garbage. However, doing so ensured that he would have to accomplish his bigger goal: There was no turning back.\u2018I will destroy Ironshield and the Iron Guild.\u2019With renewed determination, Gi-Gyu closed the gate and quietly watched the river with Sung-Hoon. Tired of waiting, Sung-Hoon muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s late.\u201d\u201cWhen has he ever been on time?\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t seem too bothered. With a sigh, he added, \u201cAnd he always shows up around the time when we begin talking about him.\u201dSuddenly, the air behind Gi-Gyu began to crumple, and a man appeared from it\u2014Go Hyung-Chul. His high level of stealth was enough to show that he was a very high-level player. \u201cAre you guys talking behind my back again?\u201dWith a frown, Go Hyung-Chul grumbled, \u201cYou surprise me every time I see you.\u201d He thought he could sneak up on Gi-Gyu without being caught this time, but he failed again.Laughing playfully, Gi-Gyu turned to face the paparazzo and replied, \u201cAnd you\u2019re so rude, dude.\u201d Sometime after they first met, Gi-Gyu learned that Go Hyung-Chul was the same age as him.The red-eyed paparazzo sat down beside Gi-Gyu and raised his hand demandingly. Sung-Hoon grumbled under his breath but still handed the paparazzo a beer can.Gi-Gyu tried to console Go Hyung-Chul, \u201cYou\u2019re incredibly stealthy. Believe me. I\u2019m sure even high rankers won\u2019t recognize your presence. I\u2019m just a special case.\u201d\u201cHmph! That\u2019s why I\u2019m forced to work for you right now.\u201d Go Hyung-Chul snorted, but he didn\u2019t seem offended.Gi-Gyu\u2019s magic sensitivity was currently higher than ever, thanks to the Emperor of Black magic and all the hunting he did recently. Therefore, he could feel even the slightest magic ripple around him better than anyone. So, he wasn't lying when he said he was a special case. After all, no player could use a skill without employing some magic.In a much lighter tone, Gi-Gyu asked Go Hyung-Chul, \u201cSo did you bring me anything useful this time?\u201d\u201cYou asked me to find out the deal between the Angela Guild and the Iron Guild, yet you\u2019re asking about it as if you\u2019re talking about the weather,\u201d When the player paparazzo complained, Gi-Gyu prodded, \u201cHurry up and tell me.\u201dGi-Gyu had met Go Hyung-Chul four times in total; he had only got some useful trivia about Ironshield.\u2018I can\u2019t believe Ironshield lost his right leg.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu assumed that Lucifer was behind this devastating injury.Go Hyung-Chul looked at Gi-Gyu and replied, \u201cI have something big this time.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?!\u201d Sung-Hoon gasped in shock, and Gi-Gyu met Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s eyes. His eyes glowing eerily, the player paparazzo continued, \u201cBut this will be the last.\u201dGo Hyung-Chul was currently a player paparazzo, but he was still a player of the assassin category. In fact, he was considered the best in this field. His current title may lead some to believe that he was acquiring his information peacefully, but no one knew exactly what he did to discover these top secrets.However, Gi-Gyu and Sung-Hoon did know one thing: Go Hyung-Chul wasn\u2019t going around with his expensive cameras, looking and waiting for things to happen.Go Hyung-Chul warned, \u201cThe last time I\u2019m providing you information. I am done with your request as of today.\u201d It was an announcement, not a request.\u201cIs what you\u2019re about to give me enough to satisfy me?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.Go Hyung-Chul turned to gaze at the river as he replied, \u201cProbably.\u201dNeither Gi-Gyu nor Sung-Hoon prodded Go Hyung-Chul anymore. They remained patient until Go Hyung-Chul was ready to talk. As the serene river waves ate away at their minutes, Go Hyung-Chul finally murmured, \u201cThe rumor about Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s injury is true. I don\u2019t know what kind of injury he suffered, but I know he\u2019s in a grave condition.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s face turned serious as Go Hyung-Chul added, \u201cHe needs the elixir.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73. The Calm Before the Storm (4)\u201cSo Lee Sun-Ho did get wounded and is searching for the elixir,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. It was huge and shocking news; if it got out, the entire world would be shaken, not just Korea.Confused, Gi-Gyu asked Go Hyung-Chul, \u201cIf this is true, why didn\u2019t you sell this information to the media? You could\u2019ve made a fortune.\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know how much Go Hyung-Chul made so far as a paparazzo, but he suspected this could bring him the most money he had ever made.Go Hyung-Chul snorted and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. Lee Sun-Ho is the pillar of our nation. Even the association can\u2019t oppose him, let alone his Angela Guild, which proves my point. So think about it. If the world finds out that Lee Sun-Ho is no more, do you think the other countries will leave Korea alone? I\u2019m not sure if they would invade Korea, but there is no doubt they will try to influence our country. I can\u2019t let something like that happen.\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t answer him. It was scary to think that one person had so much power over this country. He thought, \u2018Korea has many high rankers and rankers, but our numbers can\u2019t compare to China or Japan.\u2019While the other countries housed numerous powerful players, Korea only had Asura, whose identity was a secret; Lucifer, who wasn't interested in politics; and a few others. Oh Tae-Gu, aka Asura, was planning for the inevitable future through the association\u2019s mercenary system. However, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know the whole story, so he couldn\u2019t see the complete picture. But it still helped Gi-Gyu understand where Go Hyung-Chul was coming from.\u2018If Lee Sun-Ho is out of the picture, then Korea would\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu was deep in thought when he heard Go Hyung-Chul murmur, \u201cKorean media won\u2019t buy my information anyway since Lee Sun-Ho is too powerful to have as an enemy.\u201dThe fear in Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s eyes surprised Gi-Gyu since he had always maintained a blank face with sleepy eyes. Nothing seemed to scare Go Hyung-Chul, so the flash of fear in his eyes said a lot about Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s power.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo why did you accept my request? Doing this job might make you Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s enemy too.\u201d\u201cBecause you paid the price I named.\u201d A faint smile appeared on Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s face before he explained, \u201cYou told me about your relationship with Lucifer and what the evil eye did. Those two pieces of information were payment enough.\u201dThen, Go Hyung-Chul slowly stood up and disappeared. Gi-Gyu could sense Go Hyung-Chul\u2019s stealth and mobilization skills when activated, but he didn\u2019t bother to grab him. When Sung-Hoon and Gi-Gyu were alone again, Sung-Hoon murmured in annoyance, \u201cThis is getting more complicated.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t reply because his mind was racing.***\u2018So he needs the elixir.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought in concern. Currently, there was no known elixir available in the world. The public assumed that Lucifer, the Iron Guild, or the Athena Guild took the elixir from the Maze of Heryond.\u2018But someone so powerful like Lee Sun-Ho must know where the other elixirs are.\u2019Everyone suspected that the rich and the famous hid away all the elixirs found before the Maze of Heryond. However, Lee Sun-Ho, someone rich and famous, had to know the whereabouts of at least some of these elixirs. So why was he still not cured?\u2018Either there isn\u2019t any available elixir in the world, or he\u2026\u2019Lou finished Gi-Gyu\u2019s thought.-Or he has already used one, but it wasn\u2019t enough.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t refute the idea. Instead, he asked his Egos, \u2018What kind of wound would require more than one elixir?\u2019-Hmm\u2026Lou seemed uncertain when El suddenly chimed in.-The elixir has the power to recreate the human shell.It had been long since El spoke, so Gi-Gyu listened attentively.-But if the human body, the shell, is too damaged and requires multiple regenerations\u2026Gi-Gyu finished El\u2019s thought, \u2018It would mean he would need several elixirs.\u2019It made sense, so they were back to the assumption that Lee Sun-Ho needed the elixir. The question now was why the Angela Guild allied with the Iron Guild.\u2018The Iron Guild doesn\u2019t have the elixir. The one who has the elixir is\u2026\u2019Lucifer.Gi-Gyu was beginning to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Since Lucifer had the elixir, what kind of deal did the Iron Guild and the Angela Guild make? Did the Iron Guild promise to connect Lee Sun-Ho to Lucifer?\u201cThat's a ridiculous idea.\u201d It made no sense, and Gi-Gyu failed to solve the mystery regardless of how hard he thought.-I-I\u2019m too full!Brunheart protested, bringing Gi-Gyu out of his thoughts, but he insisted, \u201cNo, Brunheart. You can eat some more. You can do this.\u201d-But I\u2019m supposed to eat the crystals in small increments, Master!\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Brunheart. I know you can eat more.\u201d Gi-Gyu encouraged as he watched the gate above his chest swallow the mountain of crystals like Packman.Gi-Gyu spent most of his money to buy these crystals and only left a small amount for his mother and Yoo-Jung\u2019s living expenses. Since he couldn\u2019t just leave so many crystals outside, he wanted Brunheart to eat them.-P-please let me take a little break, Master.When Brunheart begged, Gi-Gyu finally replied, \u201cAll right.\u201d-T-thank god!While Brunheart sighed in relief, Gi-Gyu jumped back in his thoughts.\u201cLou.\u201d-What do you want?Gi-Gyu asked his Ego, \u201cIs there a way for me to learn more about the evil eye? Lucifer told me the evil eye would be our communication tool, but\u2026\u201d-Hmm.After thinking for a moment, Lou stated.-Maybe it\u2019s something to do with the 50th floor since Lucifer asked you to meet then? All I know is that the evil eye can reveal a person\u2019s true identity. It doesn\u2019t give you any communication ability.Despite losing his Emperor of Black Magic memories, Lou still knew more about black\u00a0magic\u00a0than anyone Gi-Gyu knew. So, he had no reason to doubt Lou\u2019s confident claim.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. The Tower wasn\u2019t a game he could challenge whenever, and then there were the tests he had to pass every ten floors. Suffice to say, he currently didn\u2019t have the time or the energy to ascend to the 50th floor.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cThe 30th-floor test was difficult. So the tests on the higher floors probably won\u2019t be any easier.\u201dSince the 30th-floor test\u2019s difficulty level didn\u2019t decrease, assuming otherwise for the floors above would be dangerous.No matter how hard he thought, no solution to his dilemma came. Shaking his head, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cBrunheart, it\u2019s time for your meal.\u201d-Kyaaa! But Master!Brunheart's screams rang inside Gi-Gyu\u2019s head, but he finished the mountain of crystals in the end.***Inside a cafe north of the Han River, Gi-Gyu was staring at his unexpected visitors. When he received a call from Sun-Pil, he expected to meet him alone. So Gi-Gyu was surprised to see that Kim Dong-Hae had accompanied Sun-Pil.\u201cLong time no see, Player Kim Dong-Hae,\u201d greeted Gi-Gyu.\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to see you.\u201d Kim Dong-Hae, the Child Guild member who led the subjugation squad, replied. Gi-Gyu had heard recently that Kim Dong-Hae was now a ranker.Sun-Pil grumbled, \u201cHyung! You\u2019ve had so many meetings with Suk-Woo hyung lately, but I don\u2019t even get a call?\u201dGi-Gyu replied apologetically, \u201cI\u2019ve been swamped, sorry.\u201d Turning toward Kim Dong-Hae, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhy did the two of you come together? I thought I was only meeting Sun-Pil today.\u201d\u201cI brought Player Kim Dong-Hae here because we have something to discuss with you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s growing confusion, Sun-Pil asked, \u201cDid you know that the guild master of the Child Guild retired? Player Kim Dong-Hae is the new guild master now.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?!\u201d Gi-Gyu jolted in shock. Kim Dong-Hae and Sun-Pil seemed very awkward because it was obvious that Gi-Gyu really had no idea.Trying to remain calm, Kim Dong-Hae blushed and murmured, \u201cThe Child Guild is only a medium-sized group, so it\u2019s understandable you didn\u2019t know, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dSun-Pil wasn\u2019t as good at hiding his shock as he replied, \u201cPlayer News aired this at least a few times. How could you not know?\u201d\u201cGosh, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ve been burning candles at both ends,\u201d apologized Gi-Gyu. He had been so busy that he couldn\u2019t even find the time to sit down and watch TV. The only news he heard was regarding the Angela and the Iron Guild from Sung-Hoon. He spent all his spare minutes resting since he used everything else on his big plan.Kim Dong-Hae accepted Gi-Gyu's apology with a smile and said, \u201cN-no need to apologize!\u201dTurning toward Sun-Pil, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo what did you want to talk about?\u201d Gi-Gyu would have begun with a mundane chat about their lives if it were just Sun-Pil. However, he decided to get right to it since Kim Dong-Hae was also here.Both Sun-Pil and Dong-Hae seemed very hesitant. Their lips trembled a little, clearly having difficulty discussing what they came here for.\u201cWe want to ask you for\u2026\u201d When Sun-Pil trailed off hesitantly, Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion peaked. He guessed, \u201cAre you trying to ask me for money? I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that!\u201d\u201cAre you turning your guild into a cult and want me to join? Sorry, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201dGi-Gyu asked jokingly, trying to lighten the mood. Sun-Pil\u2019s hesitance made Gi-Gyu think he was here to ask for money. However, that wasn\u2019t the case, so he shrugged and grinned. \u201cPlease feel free to talk to me about anything. I can\u2019t do you any big favors, but I will certainly consider it if it\u2019s nothing too big.\u201dSun-Pil looked relieved when Gi-Gyu offered in a serene voice. Suddenly, Sun-Pil stood up from his seat and announced, \u201cI want to ally with you, Gi-Gyu!\u201d The sudden proclamation drew eyes toward their table from everywhere. People inside the cafe were already peeking at Gi-Gyu for his looks and violet eye. Now with Sun-Pil\u2019s outburst, everyone was openly staring.Hating all the attention, Gi-Gyu yelped, \u201cC-calm down!\u201d Sun-Pil realized where he was, so he quickly sat down, still seeming flustered. Kim Dong-Hae stepped in and explained, \u201cI want to ally with you too. Both Morningstar and my Child Guild want to become your allies, Playe\u2014I mean Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cYou want your guilds to ally with an individual player?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in confusion since something like this rarely happened.Kim Dong-Hae continued, \u201cReading about the Yeosu Gate\u00a0reminded me of how amazing you are.\u201d Kim Dong-Hae remembered seeing the unusual rings on Gi-Gyu\u2019s fingers, so he quickly recognized him in the masked player\u2019s photo. And that was why Kim Dong-Hae contacted Gi-Gyu at the time.Kim Dong-Hae added, \u201cYou became a ranker at record speed. Your incredible strength and charm were enough to seduce me. I know that you must have even more amazing secrets.\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his shock and embarrassment. He couldn\u2019t believe Kim Dong-Hae was saying something so corny and mortifying. Undeterred, Kim Dong-Hae continued, \u201cI would like to become your ally and form a close relationship with you, Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d\u201cMe too! Don\u2019t forget the Morningstar Guild!\u201d Sun-Pil quickly butted in.Gi-Gyu contemplated before narrowing his eyes. He murmured, \u201cBut you don\u2019t even know what I might do. Have you ever considered the possibility that I might cause harm to your guilds?\u201dBoth Kim Dong-Hae and Sun-Pil answered simultaneously, \u201cWe don\u2019t care.\u201dKim Dong-Hae blurted, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you will become a red player or someone who harms others; if you do such a thing, it\u2019ll just show that I am not a good judge of a character. My first act as the guild master might end up being a costly mistake, but we both believe you\u2019re worth the risk, Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu. Whenever a guild thinks about allying with someone or a group, we consider many things; this is no different. All our deliberation, calculation, and whatnot assured us that your future is limitless.\u201dDong-Hae said all that in a single breath. When he paused to take a breath, Sun-Pil stated, \u201cWe\u2019re asking for this because we believe in your potential, Hyung. The risks we take on right now will yield a much bigger reward. This is my choice as a guild master, not a friend.\u201dFrom the looks of it, Sun-Pil and Dong-Hae talked about this at length and became friends in the process.Lou smirked and muttered.-They obviously became friends because of you. You must be pleased with your popularity among men.Gi-Gyu frowned at Lou\u2019s words but did not care much since the recent offer was eating up all of his processing power. Normally, he would have accepted the alliance in a heartbeat, but now it would become a variable in his plan. He was grateful they thought so highly of him, but he was about to face the biggest battle of his life.Dong-Hae and Sun-Pil licked their dry lips and waited for Gi-Gyu\u2019s answer. Gi-Gyu thought, \u2018Neither the Child Guild nor the Morningstar Guild are small fish. Combined, they can provide significant power.\u2019\u00a0The Morningstar Guild was growing fast, while the Child Guild was already a mid-sized guild with a long history. Gi-Gyu never doubted that these two young guilds would grow just as quickly as him. And when they became more powerful, they would be a great asset to him.With a smile, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThen shall I give you a test?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74. The Calm Before the Storm (5)\u201cWhat kind of test?\u201d Kim Dong-Hae gulped and asked, while Sun-Pil remained quiet. Watching the two players, Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly.Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI am planning something right now. I need to fight a powerful enemy, but I cannot tell you who it is until the day of the battle.\u201d Gi-Gyu slowly turned toward Dong-Hae from Sun-Pil and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s something big, so I can\u2019t have a leak. It\u2019ll ruin my plan.\u201dDong-Hae and Sun-Pil nodded as they understood the importance of keeping secrets. Gi-Gyu added, \u201cWhen the D-Day is close at hand, I will tell you the time and the place. If you bring all available players to the place, I will tell you my plan. You can, of course, refuse me at any time, including D-Day. However, if you help me\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu looked at Dong-Hae and Sun-Pil, who gulped audibly, with a faint smile\u2014\u201cYou can consider me the closest ally of both your guilds.\u201dDong-Hae and Sun-Pil were hesitant for a while before Sun-Pil said, \u201cGi-Gyu hyung, couldn\u2019t you tell me your plan in advance? I want to know the type and the number of players I would need. I also need to know what kind of preparations I should make.\u201dThe request was reasonable since Gi-Gyu asked them to fight an unknown but powerful force. It was bound to be a perilous battle, so both parties wanted to make necessary preparations. It was apparent Dong-Hae agreed since he didn\u2019t object.Gi-Gyu turned toward Sun-Pil and firmly replied, \u201cJust bring your true-blue elites. Your guilds weren\u2019t part of my plan, so any help you provide will be a bonus.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Hesitant, Sun-Pil studied Gi-Gyu. Suddenly, the day darkened as Gi-Gyu closed his eyes, eerily down the cafe temperature. Dong-Hae and Sun-Pil\u2019s eyes widened in confusion as Gi-Gyu stated, \u201cIf I do as you ask and tell you of my plan\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu opened his eyes again\u2014\u201cand you refuse my request, I will have to take care of you two for security reasons. I really don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201dNothing in both of their bodies dared to make a sound at that moment.***-Don\u2019t you think you cornered them too harshly?Lou asked in a monotone.\u201cIs making alliances supposed to be easy? That\u2019s why I called it a test. The parties involved in a true alliance protect their combined interest without hesitation, disregarding the risks,\u201d as if offended, Gi-Gyu protested.-I think you\u2019re just becoming cold.\u201cWell, you guys would be the first to notice any changes in my personality, right?\u201dBrunheart shouted cheerfully.-I like you no matter what, Master! Yayyyyyyyy!!!!!!After Brunheart stopped shrieking in excitement, El spoke.-Master, Lou is an evil sword. On top of that, you are\u2026When El paused, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cI didn\u2019t quite catch that, El. Can you repeat?\u201d Gi-Gyu wanted to hear what she had to say, but she refused to answer despite his prodding.Lou murmured in annoyance.-What a mess.Gi-Gyu was sure Lou would be shaking his head in frustration if he had one. Then, he ignored his thought, completed the task at hand, and announced, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201dAfter spending most of his money on crystals, Gi-Gyu used the rest to renovate his home basement. He often had to test new skills, so he had to find a deserted area in the Tower each time, which was a waste of time. Besides, even if he found an area, it would usually be open; that meant many risks.So, Gi-Gyu just bought several pieces of equipment and redid his basement. Sure it took some time, but the final result was worth it.\u201cLast piece goes here and\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu inserted a crystal into a small sphere in the middle of his basement. It was the last step in setting the best barrier money could buy, which Tae-Shik got him recently. Since he would test his skills here, he needed a heavy-duty item that could protect his family upstairs. He borrowed it from Tae-Shik, but he planned on buying it once the whole situation was over.Whir\u2026As a subdued vibration rang in the basement, the magical barrier slowly began to cover the basement; before long, the renovation was complete. The basement wasn\u2019t huge, but it was enough to test his new skills.\u201cI better buy this whole neighborhood once I have more money.\u201d He planned on having a private training hall near his home. And ever since he realized he could earn money easily, this stopped being a far-fetched dream.Sitting on the floor, Gi-Gyu began to organize his thoughts. He recently gained so many new skills that he needed more time to go through them.\u201cAll right, Cannibalism, Lou\u2019s Black Magic\u2026 Plus, all the skills from using Black Magic on other Egos. Oh, and I haven\u2019t tried Grant and the evil eye. Hmm\u2026 Is that all?\u201d Gi-Gyu counted the new skills by using his fingers. He murmured to Lou, \u201cI feel I now have a basic understanding of Cannibalism: I know its limitations and how it works. Overall, I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve learned.\u201dGi-Gyu had toured more gates during the last few weeks than his entire life. There, he used Cannibalism a lot and learned that there was a limit to how many skills he could absorb. Cannibalism\u2019s might was proportional to Gi-Gyu\u2019s stats since Lou said Gi-Gyu\u2019s shell was too weak for more skills. Everything seemed to depend on the quality of his \u201cshell\u201d now.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s all about my level,\u201d Gi-Gyu postulated since a player\u2019s \u201cshell\u201d became stronger as they leveled up. In simple words, an increase in a player\u2019s level meant a stronger shell, which, in turn, meant more abilities and skills.Unfortunately, Gi-Gyu was still at Level 1; since he wasn\u2019t leveling up, it was likely that his shell wasn\u2019t growing either.-It doesn\u2019t make sense, though. How can a weak shell house both El and me?Lou spoke in disbelief. Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t happy with all the limitations hindering his progress, but he hid his doubts and concerns. \u201cI guess I should be thankful that my shell can grow as Brunheart\u2019s gate grows.\u201d-I\u2019m so happy to be a help to you, Masterrrr!Brunheart announced in his adorable voice. Gi-Gyu patted the sphere in his chest and asked,\u00a0\u201cLou, what are the advantages of you awakening as the Master of Black Magic and Evil Swords?\u201dGi-Gyu called up Lou\u2019s status screen.[Lou][Title: Master of Black Magic and Evil Swords][Level 98][Power: 141][Speed: 159][Stamina: 111][Magic: 188][Immunity to poison: 10%, Immunity to flame: 5%, Defense 6.7%, Immunity to heat 10%, Magic affinity increased]-Abilities-[Accessory][Cannibalism: You can prey on corpses to regain your stamina.][Strong Will: When suffering unbearable damage, it can provide a quick stamina recovery.][Berserk: Temporarily increases strength at the cost of your sanity.][Thundering Feet: You can stomp your feet to create a mild vibration.][Body of Steel: It can increase your defense by 10%.][Black Magic: Bless the other Egos with black magic.][Absorbed Devil: Fragment of Perez.][Absorbed Player: Choi Jae-Won\u2019s fragment.]\u201cIt\u2019s so long now.\u201d Gi-Gyu frowned as he read through Lou\u2019s long status screen. He couldn\u2019t get more than ten lines on his status screen no matter how hard he worked. However, Lou had so many skills that just processing them was a chore.Lou\u2019s current skill limit was five, and all five slots were occupied now. Thankfully, he could reuse the slots by dropping the skills occupying them.-I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re jealous of my status screen.\u201cIt\u2019s not jealousy I\u2019m feeling.\u201d Gi-Gyu understood that strong Egos meant strong him. So, he wasn\u2019t jealous; frustration would be the more accurate word. The stronger his Egos got, the more of his shell they took up, i.e., he had to give up personal growth to support his Egos' growth.Gi-Gyu sighed and asked, \u201cHaa\u2026 Never mind. Did you gain anything from this awakening?\u201d-Are Black Magic, significantly increased magic affinity, and exponentially better magic stat not enough for you? Man, you\u2019re the worst kind of gold digger.Gi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s plenty. I was just curious if there was anything I missed.\u201d-Well\u2026Lou thought for a moment before continuing.-Things might change if we meet anyone who uses black magic or evil swords.For a moment, Gi-Gyu thought he could feel Lou smiling. He replied, \u201cSo nothing to do or check at the moment?\u201d-Nope.\u201cI know the effect of Black Magic on other Egos depends on their personalities and abilities. And that should be enough for now.\"Gi-Gyu had already used Black Magic several times before. And he concluded that Black Magic could give him and the other Egos additional skills if he and Lou became stronger.\u201cOnly Grant and evil eye are left now.\u201dConsidering the importance of the upcoming battle, Gi-Gyu had to learn everything about these two things. He had been concentrating for hours now, so he closed his eyes and announced, \u201cI need to eat first.\u201d***After a simple meal with his family, Gi-Gyu returned to the basement. The only new thing was that Tae-Shik now ate with his family. His family also understood Gi-Gyu\u2019s constant absence since they knew he was working on something big.\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the evil eye for now.\u201d He believed that Grant would take just as much time as Combination did, so he decided it was more efficient to concentrate on the evil eye.\u201cLou, tell me everything you know about the evil eye,\u201d asked Gi-Gyu.-I told you what I know already. It can see someone for what they really are. Also, you can control pretty much everything evil: Swords, monsters, the whole shebang.\u201d\u201cControl?\u201d-That\u2019s right.Lou hesitated before continuing,-But there\u00a0is\u00a0something I didn't tell you.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d-I don\u2019t know if the problem is with you or that wench, Lucifer. But the point is, your evil eye is a bit strange. Evil eyes come in a pair, but you only have one.Lou seemed very irritated as he continued,-I\u2019m not sure if yours is just tainted, or it was different, to begin with. All I can say is that you need to meet Lucifer to find the answer.Lou became quiet, as if he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. Gi-Gyu could understand Lou\u2019s frustration. Lou was the master of all that was evil, so even though he let go of his memories, he couldn\u2019t let go of his pride. Losing everything he had in the past must\u2019ve been stressful to the Ego, so Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t nag any further.\u201cWell then, there is just one thing left.\u201d Gi-Gyu undid Bi from his neck and murmured, \u201cGrant.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75. The Calm Before the Storm (6)Content advisory: This chapter contains depictions of racism.Clink. Clink.With a scarf covering his neck, a man led hundreds of players in neatly formed rows, flooding the area with the sounds of metal being dragged. Nearby, numerous players acted as spectators and cheered them.\u201cIron Guild! Iron Guild!\u201d\u201cShow them the power of America!\u201d\u201cU.S.A!\u201dWhen the scarf-wearing man paused to wave at the crowd, it cheered even louder in excitement.\u2018Not bad.\u2019\u00a0Rogers Han thought with a smirk. He was a promising player, a world-class guild\u2019s branch manager, and so on\u2014why wouldn\u2019t he have the smirk?\u2018Ahh\u2026 When was the last time I felt this good? Everything changed when that idiot almost killed me.\u2019Inside the Maze of Heryond, he let his guard down for a second, which almost cost him his life. Had he known something like that would happen, he would\u2019ve killed his prey much quicker. After all, who knew taking your time torturing your hostage could be deadly?Once Rogers was rescued, he drank several great potion bottles, but for some reason, his wound refused to heal fully; he still had a horrid scar on his neck.Tremble\u2026Rogers shivered in anticipation: He was so close to getting his revenge. While many cheered him on, some insulted Rogers Han, an Asian player.\u201cUgh! Damn that monkey!\u201d\u201cDoes he really think he\u2019s American now?\u201d\u201cChink!\u201dOne Caucasian player muttered, \u201cIronshield must\u2019ve lost his mind. How could he assign an Asian as a branch manager? We should\u2019ve known things would go bad the moment he began hiring the Asian players.\u201dSuddenly, an Iron Guild member approached the mutterer. Since many here were players, they all heard the man\u2019s \u201cmutter.\u201d The mutterer turned blue and stammered, \u201cW-what do you want?!\u201dIn a full-body steel armor, the player warned in a firm voice, \u201cDo not insult our guild master or our guild.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s the truth! That monkey over there\u2026\u201d The mutterer began arguing, but he couldn\u2019t finish his sentence because he noticed Rogers Han approaching them. Many civilians and association agents were around them, so the mutterer didn\u2019t fear this guild member. After all, how could a player hurt him, a non-player? However, the world pivoted on exceptions: One such exception was a\u00a0powerful branch manager.The mutterer held Rogers Han in contempt till a moment ago; now, he was quaking in his boots. Standing close to the rude man, Rogers Han showed the man his pearly white and said with a raspy and unpleasant voice, \u201cYou should be careful of what you say from now on.\u201dThen, Rogers put his arm around the Iron Guild member and pulled him back toward the group. \u201cKekeke\u2026\u201d\u201cBranch Manager, are you going to let that man get away after he insulted you?\u201d the Iron Guild member asked in confusion.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rogers asked quietly.\u201cThat bastard insulted you and our guild\u2014\u201d\u201cHow was that an insult?\u201d Rogers looked at the guild member with a blank face as he continued, \u201cHe is just some trailer trash jealous of me. I take it as a compliment.\u201dRogers quickly moved up to the front of the group to lead again. Racism was a constant in his life, so he was desensitized to it. Sadly, it distorted his values heavily.Rogers believed in white supremacy. And the racism he faced birthed intense self-hatred and a twisted worldview.\u2018It\u2019s perfectly normal for the strong to destroy the weak. This is how the world works\u2026\u2019So, Rogers derived great pleasure from the jealousy of some white man. With an ugly smile, Rogers announced, \u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201d***The Incheon International Airport was jam-packed today since the central figures leading the new Iron Guild branch would arrive in Korea. Such ceremonious arrivals were rare, so many civilians came to enjoy the show.Apart from civilians, numerous players and even executives from various Korean guilds were present, hoping to form a close relationship with the Iron Guild branch.And then, there were, of course, several players from the Korean Players Association (KPA).\u201cStep aside! Make room!\u201d The airport employees yelled to create a clear path for the arriving players. The hustle and bustle inside the Incheon International Airport was an incredible sight to behold.Suddenly, the reporters began to shout, \u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201dThe reporters swarmed to get as many photos of the Iron Guild branch members as possible. The camera flashes blinded everyone, but the cheers didn\u2019t stop.\u201cUwaaah! It\u2019s the Iron Guild!\u201d\u201cRogers! You\u2019re our hero! We can see you!\u201dThe civilians welcomed the Iron Guild with open arms.Clink.Normally, no one was allowed to bring weapons through an airport, but, don\u2019t forget, the world pivoted on exceptions. The Iron Guild players, in their steel armors, proudly walked on the path the people made for them.Leading the armored knights, Rogers walked with a blank face. The excited reporters shouted, \u201cPlease say a few words!\u201d\u201cWhat is your plan for this branch?!\u201d\u201cWhat is your guild master doing currently?\u201dThe reporters yelled in hopes of getting a scoop. However, unlike in the US, where he maintained a faint smile, Rogers kept an emotionless expression and continued to walk.\u2018Dirty Asians.\u2019\u00a0Despite being Asian himself, Rogers felt they were disgusting. When the Iron Guild first selected him, the entire nation cheered for him with pride. However, love for his nation was the last thing in his mind; he didn\u2019t even want to talk to these filthy animals.Suddenly, Rogers heard people gasping and shouting another name.\u201cOh! It\u2019s the association president, Oh Tae-Gu!\u201d one civilian yelled.\u201cWow! I\u2019ve never seen the association president in person before!\u201d his companion replied with excitement.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I came here today!\u201d a reporter nearby announced.Indeed, President Oh Tae-Gu led several of his men and was walking toward Rogers.\u2018The president of the Korean Player Association\u2026\u2019\u00a0Rogers planned on ignoring every Asian here, but even he couldn\u2019t disrespect Oh Tae-Gu. One couldn\u2019t get that position by simply being a good businessman or an excellent leader: Only the strongest could sit on that throne. In most countries, a player only lasted a few years in this position, but in Korea, Oh Tae-Gu had been maintaining his power for decades. Rogers had also heard that the KPA\u2019s president kept himself hidden until recently.Even Ironshield, whom Rogers feared the most in this world, warned before he left, \u201cBeware of the Korean association president.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Oh Tae-Gu offered his hand as he stood in front of Rogers Han. The president was an elderly man, but his aura was crushing and nothing but extraordinary.Gulp.Rogers gulped audibly and took Oh Tae-Gu\u2019s hand. He murmured, \u201cI\u2019m the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch manager, Rogers Han.\u201dFlash!Click, click, click!Dozens of cameras went off simultaneously to capture this momentous occasion. Suddenly, an association agent yelled, \u201cStop her!\u201dSomehow, a little girl escaped the association agents\u2019 blockade and ran toward Rogers. The agents tried to stop her, but Oh Tae-Gu raised his hand, gesturing to let the little girl go.The child held a crown made of flowers. Raising it shyly with her trembling hands, the little girl whispered, \u201cPlease protect our country\u2026\u201d\u201c...\u201d A heavy silence fell as Rogers gazed at the child coldly. He would have accepted the crown in the past and even hugged the child to maintain his reputation. But after what had happened in the Maze of Heryond, he didn\u2019t care anymore. Rogers looked down at the child with disgust, making the girl take a tentative step back in fear.Leering, Rogers said to Oh Tae-Gu, \u201cIs this the best KPA can do? Letting a civilian in like this\u2026\u201dRogers did not try to hide his annoyance. The truth was, he was frustrated that he felt threatened by President Oh Tae-Gu, so Rogers wanted to insult him by using the girl as an excuse, but that didn\u2019t do anything. Giving Rogers a relaxed smile, the association president replied, \u201cI guess the Iron Guild\u2019s branch manager can\u2019t read other people\u2019s power. A grown man being wary of such a child\u2026\u201dAlthough Oh Tae-Gu\u2019s voice was kind, Rogers could feel the elderly man\u2019s fury, so he shut his lips firmly. Rogers finally accepted the flower crown, and the girl smiled brightly before running back to her parents. The camera flashes continued to go off.\u201cPlease, right this way.\u201d President Oh Tae-Gu ushered the Iron Guild members out of the airport.***Dozens of black vans ran on the highway.\u201cDammit!\u201d Rogers shrieked in his cracking voice as he stomped on the flower crown. He swore, \u201cHow dare a stupid Asian insult me like that\u2026!\u201dRogers couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. Originally, he was supposed to ride with the association president, but he asked to be in a separate van, so only the Iron Guild members were with him now.Leaning back in his seat, Rogers ordered, \u201cGo straight to the Iron Guild branch headquarters.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d the driver, another Iron Guild member, asked in confusion.\u201cTell them I need to check the headquarters building first. I don't care what they say. Just head straight to the Iron Guild branch.\u201d When Rogers ordered firmly, the driver knew he had no other choice. He answered, \u201cOf course.\u201dGoing to the branch building instead of dropping by the association building first was an incredibly rude gesture; it was the best revenge plot Rogers could concoct for the association president. Rogers wondered how the news channels would report what he was doing now in tomorrow\u2019s news.Watching out the window, Rogers whispered in resentment, \u201cKim\u2026 Kim\u00a0Gi-Gyu.\u201d Before arriving here, he had done thorough research on Kim Gi-Gyu. Rogers knew he was the \u201cplayer who couldn\u2019t level up,\u201d he worked as a guide for the association, and that he even had a close relationship with the general manager of the Department of Gate Maintenance. Rogers gathered a decent amount of information on this unknown player, but\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d murmured Rogers in frustration. For some reason, gathering info on Gi-Gyu was proving itself very difficult. Consequently, he had no idea what Kim Gi-Gyu had been doing lately or which guild he belonged to. Rogers wanted to monitor his enemy closely, but it seemed someone was protecting Kim Gi-Gyu\u2019s information from being leaked out.He muttered, \u201cHe has ties to that damn Lucifer, so I guess this makes sense.\u201d Anger clouded Rogers\u2019 eyes as he fantasized about killing them both.Although Rogers didn\u2019t have much information on Gi-Gyu, he was confident he would find his enemy. When he raised his hand, one of the guild members handed him a document when he raised his hand. On it were the names, photos, and addresses of two people.\u201cKim Yoo-Jung and Lee Su-Jin\u2026\u201d Rogers murmured as he smirked in pleasure.The guild member sitting in the passenger seat informed Rogers, \u201cI\u2019ve just informed the KPA that we\u2019ll be heading straight to the guild branch building.\u201d\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d When Rogers asked, the guild member replied, \u201cThey said it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cDid they say anything else?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing.\u201dThe association's response surprised and confused Rogers since he expected them to protest or get angry at him. Instead, he saw the association vans ahead of them take an exit while his own van continued on the highway.Rogers grinned in satisfaction and announced with excitement, \u201cFinally, they are treating me with the respect I deserve. They can\u2019t even protest against my rude gesture because they are afraid of the Iron Guild and me.\u201dThe Iron Guild branch building wasn\u2019t too far away now, and Rogers already had a game plan in mind. First, he would find Kim Gi-Gyu\u2019s family and torture them until Gi-Gyu came out of whatever hole he was hiding in. Then, he would torture Kim Gi-Gyu, to death this time.Schwing!Rogers carefully unsheathed his sword and murmured, \u201cWith Nine, I can do anything.\u201dThe biggest reason Ironshield was so powerful was because of these holy swords. Now, Rogers had Nine: A green holy sword. He felt confident that he could kill anyone in Korea, except Lucifer.The driver announced quietly, \u201cSir, we\u2019ll be arriving shortly.\u201dHis revenge and ambition were on the cusp of being fulfilled. Ready to do what he came here for, Rogers sheathed his sword and readied himself.When he looked out the window again, he noticed the streets were unusually empty. He wondered, \u201cHmm? Why are the streets so empty? Did everyone go to the association building to wait for me there?\u201dWhile the Incheon International Airport was flooding with people, no one was here waiting for them. Officially, Rogers was supposed to visit the association building first, so he deduced the crowd must be waiting for him at the association building.Creak!Before long, all the vans carrying the Iron Guild members stopped.Clink.One by one, the steel armored knights exited the black vans; sadly, no one was here to enjoy the sight.Suddenly, the warning alarms went off.-A gate break has occurred. All civilians must evacuate immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76. The Second Revenge\u201cUmm, so you\u2019re really going to fight the Iron Guild?\u201d Sun-Pil asked in shock. Standing next to them, Dong-Hae had the same confused expression as Sun-Pil.Gi-Gyu nodded and replied, \u201cYou can still say no. The battle has already begun, so you must leave now if you want.\u201d The gate break alarms were blaring, heralding the start of the battle. Unfortunately, the citizen evacuation wasn\u2019t complete due to Rogers Han\u2019s detour. But this wouldn't matter since they would be evacuated while the Iron Guild members were busy dealing with Gi-Gyu\u2019s summoned undead.Once all innocents were out, the barrier around the city would be completed. Then, Gi-Gyu would give them hell.Dong-Hae replied firmly first, \u201cI\u2019ll stay and help you, Player Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d His face was one of someone ready to die. Immediately after, Sun-Pil added, \u201cMe too. I\u2019m staying too, Hyung. I, too, am serious about the alliance.\u201d Sun-Pil frowned and glanced at Dong-Hae; he seemed a little upset that he wasn\u2019t the first one to answer Gi-Gyu.Gi-Gyu looked at both players and grinned. Sung-Hoon, who was on his phone, announced, \u201cThe Iron Guild asked the Korean association to let them help with the gate break.\u201dGi-Gyu replied, \u201cSo Rogers agreed to help with the gate break? Everything is going smoothly then.\u201d\u201cThe association requested all the other local Korean guilds to evacuate; two offered to help, but they stepped back when we told them the Iron Guild was taking control. Oh, and about 80% of the civilians have been evacuated so far,\u201d Sung-Hoon explained quickly.Gi-Gyu nodded and began walking. Now that the alarm had been triggered, it was time to move. With only Sun-Pil, Dong-Hae, and Sung-Hoon around him, Gi-Gyu awkwardly scratched his cheek before muttering, \u201cOpen.\u201dWhir!Rattle.Rattle.\u201c...!\u201d Dong-Hae gasped in shock.\u201cT-this is insane!\u201d Sun-Pil exclaimed.\u201cI-I had no idea this was possible\u2026!\u201d Sung-Hoon murmured with eyes as wide as saucers.The three players couldn\u2019t hide their surprise as they stared at the gate with its quivering blue light. Seconds later, a neatly arranged undead militia exited the gate.\u201cHow are these skeleton monsters this strong\u2026?!\u201d Sun-Pil gaped as he felt the monsters\u2019 aura.\u201cHow\u2019s that the big news? Didn\u2019t you see Player Kim Gi-Gyu open a gate and summon all these undead?\u201d Dong-Hae shouted in disbelief. While these players gaped, an endless line of skeletons left the gate, followed by a headless knight and a lich.Clunk.Clink.Thud!The headless knight and the lich kneeled in front of Gi-Gyu respectfully. In an eerie voice, the lich announced, \u201cGreetings to the grandmaster.\u201dGi-Gyu looked at the two monsters emotionlessly and ordered, \u201cProtect the areas I told you about. And kill everyone from the Iron Guild. They will be in their steel armor.\u201dClank.The durahan and the lich, named Hart, rose and bowed. \u201cYour wish is our command.\u201d\u201cOh, but leave Rogers Han alone\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu stretched his arms and neck side to side\u2014\u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled widely; his white teeth shone quite brightly amid the ever-increasing army of the undead.***\"It\u2019s gonna shower.\u201d When Tae-Gu murmured, Tae-Shik frowned and asked, \u201cOld man! What the heck are you talking about now?!\u201dTae-Gu and Tae-Shik were standing on the roof of a tall building nearby: They could see the entirety of Seoul from there. The Iron Guild branch headquarters was a tall building in Yeoksam Dong. And currently, this entire region was under the association\u2019s control, barring entry and exit to everyone without permission.By now, all local citizens knew about the gate break, so the remaining 20% or so un-evacuated citizens were also running out screaming. This area had many large-sized Korean guilds, and the KPA was also close by. So, the evacuation process was swift.\u201cIt has finally begun,\u201d Tae-Gu murmured. Both Tae-Gu and Tae-Shik could sense the monsters nearby. Tae-Gu continued with his eyes glued to the city, \u201cI know he explained it to me, but I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201dThey both could hear and see the undead militia below, and it was unlike what they were used to. The undead didn\u2019t destroy everything in their way\u2014they marched like the perfect army.Tae-Shik crouched on the ground and lit his cigarette. \u201cHmm, isn\u2019t that more like an army?\u201d\u2014he narrowed his eyes\u2014\u201cThe Cain Guild will make its move once the evacuation process is complete.\u201d\u201cAre you certain about him?\u201d Tae-Gu asked as he turned toward Tae-Shik, who was blowing smoke. With a casual shrug, Tae-Shik replied, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat boy.\u201d Tae-Gu, watching the gray clouds approaching the city, clarified, \u201cI\u2019m asking you if you\u2019re sure that boy won\u2019t turn into a monster.\u201dTae-Shik stomped on his cigarette with an emotionless face and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t care. All I want is for that boy to be happy.\u201dAs the civilians\u2019 aura gradually disappeared from Yeoksam Dong, Tae-Gu and Tae-Shik watched the city without a word.Clank.Before long, the streets were filled with screams, battle cries, and the sounds of weapons clashing with each other.Drop, drop.A creepy fog slowly enveloped Yeoksam Dong, and the dark clouds above seemed to seal the area completely. As if mourning the lives that would be lost today, the sky began to rain.\u201cIf that child loses control and interferes with our plan, I will have no choice but to get involved. I\u2019ll need to take care of him, so\u2026\u201d Tae-Gu trailed off. One didn\u2019t want to complete the thought; the other didn\u2019t want to hear it.Raising his cell phone, Tae-Shik made a call. He ordered quietly, \u201cFrom now on, block all players, non-players, and living creatures.\u201dDrop, drop, drop\u2026Drop, drop, drop, drop\u2026Shwaaaaah!The heavy rain blurred everyone\u2019s vision. Tae-Shik whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s time to honor the Grigory.\u201d***\u201cAll right,\u201d Suk-Woo hung up and turned around. The rain was becoming heavier, and his elite members stood solemnly underneath it. There were less than 100 of them, but these were the strongest and most trustworthy players in his guild. When he raised his hands, he began to levitate slowly. Surrounded by the tall buildings, the forest, and the rain, the armored players looked out of place, yet they should be nowhere but here.Suk-Woo looked down at his guild members and announced, \u201cI have received the signal. It\u2019s time to get to work. As I said before, you can ignore the monsters and just kill the Iron Guild members.\u201d\u201cGuild master, are you sure the monsters won\u2019t attack us\u2026?\u201dThe Cain Guild members trusted Suk-Woo, but they couldn\u2019t help feeling uncertain about this strategy. Although rare, the players sometimes had to kill other players if the two guilds were at war. However, Suk-Woo wanted them to fight\u00a0alongside\u00a0the monsters to battle other players. In simple words, he was asking them to go against their instincts.Suk-Woo began to fly as he replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure of it. You don\u2019t have to worry about the monsters.\u201d That simple order was enough to dispel their doubts; the Cain players ran forward without hesitation.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Suk-Woo looked around in concern. He could tell that the association had control over the area, but the problem was the agents that were sent to control the area.\u201cThis feels strange.\u201d Others probably couldn\u2019t tell, but Suk-Woo could feel the players the association sent to barricade the city were different from your average players.\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s them.\u201d When Suk-Woo first received his code name, he heard about a group of players who were part of the association but were also independent.A group created and controlled by Tae-Shik and Tae-Gu to protect Korea and humankind: Grigory.Suk-Woo had no idea of the beginning or the history of this group. All he knew was that it was made of players with special powers. He suspected that this secret group was barricading the city.***\u201cHahaha! I knew it! A Third World country like this obviously has no order,\u201d Rogers shouted as he slew a skeleton soldier. Before he arrived in Korea, he had heard of the open gate near the Iron Guild branch building. But he assumed the Korean association would take care of it, like how every country did.But here he was, fighting the monster the moment he arrived. Rogers couldn\u2019t believe what was happening around him. He continued to yell, \u201cDamn Koreans! Can\u2019t even close a gate. Why do we, the Americans, have to do everything?\u201d Rogers killed one monster after another as he laughed in pleasure. All the worries and the stress Ironshield and Tae-Gu gave him melted away. Right now, he only felt bliss.\u201cKim Gi-Gyu!\u201d Rogers roared, rousing the flames of his vengeance.Several Iron Guild members surrounded him and asked, \u201cBranch Manager! Please give us an order!\u201d The skeletons were stronger than they expected, to say nothing of their number. It hadn\u2019t been long since they arrived in Korea, so if their branch manager got hurt or killed, It would be the biggest embarrassment to their guild and country.\u201cWhy would you need an order?! Just kill them all! Both monsters and\u2014\u201d Suddenly, Rogers felt the presence of unfamiliar players around him. \u201cDid the association bring in reinforcements to control this gate break?\u201dRogers vaguely remembered hearing about this, and he became furious.\u2018How dare they?! These weak Asians who call themselves his brothers\u2026! How dare they try to help him?\u2019\u201cThey don\u2019t think I can take care of this?!\u201d Rogers\u2019 pride was hurt. Did the Koreans really think he couldn\u2019t massacre these weak skeleton soldiers by himself? Madness slowly filled Rogers\u2019s face as he shrieked, \u201cKill everyone! Every human and every monster that gets in our way!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dA superior\u2019s order was absolute. The Iron Guild members had no choice but to obey Rogers, especially since Ironshield personally told them to. Then, the Iron Guild players promptly began to move.***The elite players of the Morningstar and the Child Guilds combined were smaller than the Iron Guil group. However, they still charged ahead; thanks to the undead, the battle was a close one thanks to the undead. Gi-Gyu, who was watching the progression, was the last to leave the building. The association made sure there were no electronic devices, including security cameras, active here: No one could make contact inside the barrier now.Yeoksam Dong was a rather small city, so he met several players wherever Gi-Gyu went.-It\u2019s finally time.When Lou announced calmly, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cYeah.\u201dBoom!Kaboom!Clang, clang!As the explosions and weapons clashes filled his ears, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cHave the battles already begun?\u201d Based on his senses, he could tell that the skeletons had moved back, and the fight was mostly between the players. He guessed Hart and the durahan had led the skeletons to focus on one region.\u201cBi.\u201d Suddenly, his necklace began glowing, and then a mysterious blue and red wolf materialized before him. This was the result of combining Chang-Gyung\u2019s Ego with Bi.\u201cGrrr!\u201d The newly improved Bi growled as it rubbed against Gi-Gyu. Jumping on the wolf\u2019s back easily, he ordered, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBi began with a leisurely trot; within seconds, it was sprinting at an incredible speed.The hunt was finally on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77. The Second Revenge (2)The Iron Guild sent three armed elite teams to Korea to form a branch. Each group had 100 players who were at least semi-rankers or higher. A ranker led each group, and Rogers Han controlled the three rankers.Back then, Rogers was just a semi-ranker; now, his strength had grown by folds thanks to a new item. Gi-Gyu\u2019s current goal was to prevent the three teams from teaming up against him.The three guilds currently helping Gi-Gyu have never worked together before. On the other hand, Iron Guild\u2019s three teams should\u2019ve trained together countless times. Defeating them as a single team would be much harder. Just like their name, the Iron Guild became stronger together.Sun-Pil and Dong-Hae\u2019s guilds were working together to battle the first team, the Cain Guild was dealing with the second team, Gi-Gyu\u2019s undead were crushing the third team, and Hart and the durahan were gradually cornering Rogers Han.\u201cI guess this is where Sun-Pil\u2019s guild is fighting.\u201d Gi-Gyu caressed Bi\u2019s mane to change the direction.\u201cBi! I need you to be a little faster.\u201d When Gi-Gyu gently urged, Bi growled, \u201cGrrr!\u201d The newly born Bi seemed excited to obey. He used Grant to endow his Ego with an Ego fragment.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cIf I had known better, I would have granted it to Hermes.\u201d-There is no point in regretting your decision now.\u201cI know that,\u201d Gi-Gyu grumbled. Still, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he could\u2019ve gained had he incorporated Chang-Gyung into Hermes, a simple pair of shoes. But, all in all, the final result of his decision wasn\u2019t half bad. After all, he now had access to greater abilities and new skills.Gi-Gyu held on to Bi\u2019s mane with one hand and brought up the wolf\u2019s status screen.[Bi][Level 81][Power: 77][Speed: 102][Stamina: 91][Magic: 98][-Abilities-][Accessory][Can transform into its monster form.][Can increase magic recovery speed.][Wound aggravation: Can delay healing of an enemy\u2019s wounds.][Bleeding: Can increase the bleeding of an enemy\u2019s wounds.][Elemental Fire: Can turn its body into flame.][Elemental Water: Can turn its body into water.][Elemental Dark: Can turn its body into darkness.]\u201cIt\u2019s so amazing,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in pleasure, beyond satisfied. After seeing the gains from the incorporation, Gi-Gyu tried to incorporate Choi Min-Suk into another Ego. However, it failed, and Gi-Gyu realized that only Egos with similar characteristics could be combined. \u201cI\u2019ll have plenty of time for all this later,\u201d Gi-Gyu said, knowing this wasn\u2019t the time to be distracted.He grasped Bi harder and decided, \u201cIt\u2019s raining right now, so I think I should use one of your new skills now.\u201dWith an excited smile, Gi-Gyu shouted, \u201cElemental water!\u201d Suddenly, Bi\u2019s four paws turned into a giant water drop and assimilated with the rain. Then, the wolf ran in the air, stepping on water droplets, like a missile, and within seconds, Gi-Gyu arrived at his destination.***\u201cIce Sword!\u201d Dong-Hae shouted as he swung his weapon. Albescent frost covered his sword quickly; it brought his opponents\u2019 body temperature down on contact. Once his opponents slowed down, Dong-Hae killed them easily.\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Dong-Hae murmured as he looked around to kill another of his enemies.Boom!Behind him, countless more explosions rang, making it apparent the Iron Guild mages were detonating their explosion skills.\u201cSun-Pil!\u201d Dong-Hae shouted while Sun-Pil was busy fighting an Iron Guild player with his close friends, Jae-Won and Ha-Neul. \u201cYes, Hyung!\u201dSuddenly, their opponent asked, \u201cIs this how Korea welcomes her guests?\u201d\u201cDammit\u2026 Why did Chalemont have to be our enemy today?!\u201d muttered Sun-Pil.Dressed in full-body armor and a helmet straight out of the Middle Ages, Chalemont was the giant man leading one of the three teams. When Chalemont asked in an accusing tone, Sun-Pil replied in perfect English. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this.\u201dChalemont swung his weapon and murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re attacking the Iron Guild by inventing a fake gate break\u2026 No, maybe there really is a gate break here?\u201d The last claim was supported by the undead roaming around them and attacking Chalemont\u2019s players.The Morningstar and the Child guilds weren\u2019t enough to deal with the Iron Guild\u2019s team; they only survived because of the summoned undead.Chalemont turned his sword like a windmill as he whispered, \u201cTo control these monsters like this\u2026 You must have an incredibly powerful player on your side.\u201d Every time his sword rotated, a pressured gale would force Sun-Pil back. So, Sun-Pil threw his dagger at Chalemont and dove behind Jae-Won, who slammed his giant shield on the ground and shouted, \u201cEarth Shield!\u201dSuddenly, concrete began to climb Jae-Won\u2019s shield to create an even larger shield. When Chalemont stopped swinging his sword, Sun-Pil knocked his arrow and waited.Clunk!Seconds later, Chalemont\u2019s sword crushed through the concrete shield and split it into two.Crack!Through the split shield, Sun-Pil shot his arrows. Chalemont murmured in annoyance, \u201cIdiots. You will all be dead very soon. The other team leaders must be aware of what is happening here by now. They must be on their way here by now.\u201dJae-Won shouted in frustration, \u201cWhy is Hyung so late?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Dong-Hae hyung is over there fighting three players right now!\u201d When Sun-Pil replied, Jae-Won exclaimed, \u201cNo, not Dong-Hae hyung!\u201dThey were the weakest force in this whole area, so they should\u2019ve gotten reinforcement by now. And that reinforcement would be\u2026\u201cAh\u2026! Don\u2019t worry! He\u2019s here!\u201d Sun-Pil shouted in elation. Everyone seemed confused by the statement until a booming sound struck their ears. The Iron Guild members nearby warned Chalemont, \u201cBoss! Watch out!\u201dWhen Chalemont turned around, he whispered in shock, \u201cT-this is\u2026!\u201d He could feel a terrifying aura aiming for his head, so he raised his sword high and shouted, \u201cIron\u2026!\u201d He was about to use his last and the greatest skill, but before he could activate it, something fell on top of him.Stab!\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late.\u201dGi-Gyu landed on top of Chalemont as he plunged Lou and El. His Egos pierced through his sword and armor to stab Chalemont\u2019s shoulders. Lou successfully stabbed Chalemont\u2019s heart as his head slumped without a word.[Cannibalism is being activated.]\u201cBi, take care of the rest,\u201d Gi-Gyu ordered.\u201cGrrrr\u2026\u201d Bi turned into water again and swept away the enemies. The Iron Guild members could do little to injure Bi in his water form, so they just focused on maintaining their formation. Thanks to the wolf, the Morningstar and the Child guilds could finally breathe a little.[Player Chalemont is being egofied.]Sun-Pil shouted, \u201cGi-Gyu hyung! Why are you so late! We\u2019re fine, so go help Dong-Hae hyung!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201d Gi-Gyu answered and turned around. He had already noticed that Kim Dong-Hae was tackling several Iron guild members alone to help the other players. He was so focused that he didn\u2019t even notice Gi-Gyu\u2019s arrival.\u201cHaaaa!\u201d Dong-Hae screamed as he fought three Iron Guild players. He announced, \u201cIce Blast!\u201d Suddenly, a loud ice explosion took place, one big enough to engulf Dong-Hae himself.[The egofication of Player Chalemont has failed.][Player Chalemont\u2019s fragment has been absorbed.]\u201cAccelerate! Accelerate!\u201d When Gi-Gyu roared, he seemed to have turned into a flash of light. \u00a0In the nick of time, he grabbed Dong-Hae and rolled away from the explosion. His face pale, Dong-Hae shouted, \u201cW-what took you so long?!\u201dDong-Hae was well aware his ice blast was a suicidal move since this skill required him to have a certain amount of safe distance. However, he didn\u2019t notice Gi-Gyu\u2019s arrival and was being pressured by the three Iron Guild members, so he decided to die with them rather than die alone.Reading Dong-Hae\u2019s thoughts, Gi-Gyu grinned and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I won\u2019t forget what you did for me today.\u201d Gi-Gyu placed Dong-Hae on the ground and began to run toward his next target.***The news channels went wild with what was happening in the Yeoksam-dong.-Yeoksam-dong is currently in a sea of fire.-Another gate break has occurred. The association announced that the Iron Guild is currently fighting off the monsters while the Cain and the Morningstar guilds are helping out.-After his recent, first public appearance, President Oh Tae-Gu is currently at the site to protect the rest of the city. He has placed a barrier and has ordered his agents to kill any monsters that escape it.-The general manager of the Department of Gate Maintenance is also on site.The Iron Guild was about to officially establish its branch, but the gate break threw the nation into turmoil. Since Yeoksam-dong was under a barrier, the media tried to make the best of what they knew.The news impressed many.\u201cOh my god!\u201d\u201cThe Iron Guild is indeed the savior of the world!\u201d\u201cThe Iron Guild players are risking their lives to save Korea on their very first day.\u201dThe tale of the Iron Guild players\u2019 \u201cselfless sacrifice\u201d drew abundant encouragement, love, and gratitude from the Korean population. After all, Gangnam, where Yeoksam-dong was located, was considered one of the safe areas. So, how could they not praise the heroes helping the KPA with this unexpected gate break?But, of course, not everyone believed the story they heard on TV.\u201cRidiculous,\u201d the Hephaestus Guild\u2019s guild master smirked. The Hephaestus Guild was one of the top ten guilds in Korea. Its office happened to be located in Yeoksam-dong. The guild master muttered, \u201cI never expected the association to do something like this.\u201dYeoksam-dong was the Hephaestus Guild\u2019s territory, yet the KPA asked them to step back. All the other guilds in the area were also asked to step back with their offers to help cruelly rejected. For the first time in history, the association president and a general manager were on-site to control an area.\u201cAny guild master can tell that something is very wrong here.\u201d The Hephaestus Guild\u2019s master drank his beer as his body trembled in anger. Even his full beard shook as he watched the news.\u201cThis situation doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d the guild master murmured. Sadly, even he didn\u2019t have the power to break through the security protocol set by the association to see what was really going on.Choi Chang-Yong, the guild master of another top ten Korean guild, Blue Dragon Guild, replied, \u201cUnless the Angela Guild puts a stop to this, we won\u2019t have any choice but to let it go.\u201d Contrary to his kind face, Choi Chang-Yong was filled with rage at the moment. Their guilds couldn\u2019t oppose the association, which angered him to no end.Currently, all the guild masters of the top ten Korean guilds, except Suk-Woo of the Cain Guild, were gathered in an office for an emergency meeting. All the powerful guild masters looked to one man at the head of the table.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The young man had a pale face and seemed contemplative. He looked barely out of his teenage years, but everyone in the room respected and feared him. After all, only this young man could disobey the association.One of the guild masters asked respectfully, \u201cI would like to hear what you think, Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho.\u201dThe guild master of the Angela Guild\u2014Lee Sun-Ho\u2014smiled.***\u201cWe made the right choice. I knew it.\u201d Dong-Hae tapped Sun-Pil\u2019s shoulders and announced. Everyone around them, including Jaewon and the members of the Morningstar and the Child guilds, all nodded in agreement.Sun-Pil slowly replied, \u201cGi-Gyu hyung is so amazing.\u201dBefore, they were all hesitant; now that the battle was nearing its end, they now knew they had made the right decision. As they gathered together, they saw the skeleton soldiers walking around, stabbing any surviving Iron Guild members on the ground. This was necessary to keep today\u2019s affair a secret.The deputy guild masters of the Morningstar and the Child guilds walked up to Sun-Pil and Dong-Hae as they announced, \u201cTo be honest, we doubted your choices a little at first. We even thought you were crazy to come here.\u201dThe Child Guild players were especially against the idea at the beginning. Even during the fight, they screamed several times that they should turn back. This was expected since they couldn\u2019t see victory even with the Morningstar Guild\u2019s help.\u201cFrankly, we would\u2019ve died if things continued to go the way they did,\u201d Sun-Pil murmured. Thanks to Gi-Gyu, the worst didn\u2019t come to pass, and they won, with a few casualties, though.The friendlies turned toward the site of an active battle. Fire, ice, and rain mixed into one in that area: Gi-Gyu was there helping the Cain Guild. Dong-Hae announced, \u201cWe should help the injured return home, but afterward, we should go and join Gi-Gyu.\u201dGi-Gyu told them they could leave now, but no one seemed ready to retreat just yet. Every player firmly believed that the battle ahead would bring them huge rewards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78. The Second Revenge (3)While the Morningstar and the Child guilds had to fight tooth and nail with Chalemont\u2019s team, Gi-Gyu incapacitated them all swiftly and rushed toward the Cain Guild team. This haste was due to Brunheart\u2019s warning.-Master! Most of the skeleton soldiers have been destroyed!\u201cAre Hart and the durahan still okay?\u201d-They are fighting really well so far! After devouring so many crystals, it\u2019s their duty to fight and make you proud!One Iron Guild team managed to obliterate Gi-Gyu\u2019s undead team and should\u2019ve joined the Cain Guild fight by now. Now, Suk-Woo and his guild would\u2019ve to simultaneously deal with two Iron Guild teams. The pressure just doubled on them.\u201cThat\u2019s to say nothing of the other reason,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. Tae-Shik informed him that there wasn't much time left till he needed to finish everything. Since the KPA refused all help, the other guilds were getting antsy. It was only a matter of time before they began actively protesting against the association and asking what was really happening in Yeoksam Dong. In addition, the high-level barrier that surrounded the city was effective for only a limited time. Once the barrier was disabled, everything that happened inside the city would be revealed to the public. Gi-Gyu had to do everything he could to avoid this sticky situation.Gi-Gyu prodded, \u201cBi! We gotta hurry! Please go a little faster!\u201d\u201cGrr!\u201d Bi growled and picked up speed. Thankfully, they arrived at their destination just in time.\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu swore as he jumped off Bi. True to his expectations, the Cain Guild team was battling two Iron Guild teams alone. As if it read Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind, the wolf immediately charged toward the enemies.Soaked in blood, Suk-Woo shouted at Gi-Gyu, \u201cHey! What took you so long\u2026?!\u201d\u201cSorry, we\u2019ll talk later,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu, kicking the ground with all his strength to jump. The street was littered with corpses, and most belonged to the Cain Guild; thankfully, the casualties weren't as great as Gi-Gyu expected.Thud!\u201cIs that a new enemy?!\u201d said some guy who looked like the Iron Guild team\u2019s leader. The vibration from Gi-Gyu\u2019s jump shocked everyone, and the battle paused for a brief moment. Gi-Gyu reached the enemy leader in that brief second and clashed his swords with the enemy\u2019s.\u201cHehehe, I can tell you\u2019re a powerful player,\u201d the enemy leader muttered. Based on the madness in his eyes, Gi-Gyu could guess who it was. Gi-Gyu whispered, \u201cRhodes?\u201d\u201cI guess you know my name, huh!\u201d Rhodes replied gleefully.Irony Guild\u2019s three elite teams were led by Chalemont, Rhodes, and Karen; Gi-Gyu had read the reports on each of them. Chalemont was famous for his old-fashioned helmet, while Rhodes had crazy eyes. And the woman battling Suk-Woo on the opposite side was Karen, who had shiny blond hair and an even shinier rapier.Rhodes asked, \u201cWho are you? There is no way I\u2019ve never heard of a powerful player like you.\u201d Rhodes swung his long sword with a bright grin; he was considered the strongest among the three.\u201cAnything\u2019s possible,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu while dodging the attack using Accelerate and Rush. Rush was the new skill he got when he used Black Magic on Hermes. The synergy between Accelerate and Rush was incredible, allowing Gi-Gyu to move faster than he had ever before.\u201cUgh!\u201d Rhodes groaned when Lou slashed his arm.\u201cArgh.\u201d Unfortunately, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help moaning as well since using Accelerate and Rush simultaneously was too taxing.\u2018Gotta finish it fast,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. As Gi-Gyu swung Lou, he caught Suk-Woo and his team, covered in blood, fighting the other team. Lou scratched Rhodes\u2019 long sword, creating ominous metallic sounds. Gi-Gyu tried to take this opportunity to stab his enemy with El, but Rhodes was faster. He shoved Lou with his sword and ran to attack Gi-Gyu.Rhodes chuckled like a madman and yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing fighter! Kekeke, I love it!\u201d Gi-Gyu began to panic a little and used both Lou and El to attack his enemy from behind. It was a perfect move, and there was no way Rhodes could escape it.Stab!\"Kekeke.\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered in shock when Rhodes giggled, \u201cY-you crazy bastard!\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his shock at Rhodes\u2019 madness. He had skewered Rhodes\u2019 waist with Lou and El, but Rhodes just plunged his sword into his own stomach with a smile. By doing so, he managed to stab Gi-Gyu, who was standing behind him. It was as if Rhodes\u2019 was trying to commit suicide.\u201cUgh! Ack\u2026!\u201d Gi-Gyu took a step back as he looked down, his stomach was bleeding. While Gi-Gyu looked confused by the unexpected attack, Rhodes turned his head around and smiled. His stomach and waist, severely wounded previously, were already healing at an incredible speed.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cHis unique ability\u2026\u201d The was only one reason behind Rhodes\u2019 madness and his status as the strongest among the three: Regeneration. This unique ability helped him quickly recover from most attacks, which was how he came to love pain and became renowned as a crazy, bloodthirsty player.Gi-Gyu took another step and dashed toward Suk-Woo, \u201cSuk-Woo!\u201d Karen\u2019s rapier was about to pierce Suk-Woo\u2019s neck; when she saw Gi-Gyu, she shouted in a fury, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare interfere!\u201dKaren\u2019s rapier was still headed toward Suk-Woo\u2019s neck when Suk-Woo suddenly shouted, \u201cMirror Image!\u201dInstantly, a blurry Suk-Woo materialized before the real Suk-Woo.***\u201cHe contacted us quicker than I thought,\u201d Tae-Shik frowned and murmured. The Angela Guild just made an official request to the association. It offered to stop the gate break while demanding access to the area. The association refused, saying there were still too many monsters inside for the barrier to be deactivated. But it was only a matter of time before the Angela Guild pressured the association again.Tae-Gu announced, \u201cOne hour.\u201d Turning toward his son, he explained, \u201cI\u2019ll lift the barrier in one hour.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d Tae-Shik shouted at the association president. He was so shocked by this decision that he forgot to call him \u201cold man\u201d like he usually did. Tae-Shik planned on dragging this for another three hours, yet Tae-Gu was promising only one: This was not what they promised Gi-Gyu.Tae-Gu muttered, \u201cEven one hour is stretching it.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?! You know you can buy at least three more hours! Father!\u201d Tae-Shik replied angrily. He believed that if his father spoke to the Angela Guild in person, he could force the guild to be courteous and give at least three hours. After all, Oh Tae-Gu was the association president, so even the Angela Guild couldn\u2019t openly disrespect Tae-Gu.\u201c...\u201d Tae-Gu\u2019s lips flinched a few times. He did this whenever he became angry. Tae-Shik shut his mouth since aggravating Tae-Gu further wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. After a while, Tae-Gu explained, \u201cLee Sun-Ho is coming here in person.\u201dTae-Gu\u2019s hands clenched into tight fists, making his magic whirl around him like a small storm. The nearby association agents flinch and back away.Tae-Gu turned toward his son and ordered, \u201cCall for the Grigory. We\u2019re going to war.\u201d\u201c....\u201d\u201cWe would be lucky to get even one hour at this rate,\u201d Tae-Gu muttered, his outrage palpable. Tae-Shik grasped Behemoth\u2019s thorn and suggested, \u201cI think we should send in Sung-Hoon first.\u201dTae-Gu nodded in agreement.***\u201cAre you all right?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked in worry, Suk-Woo replied breathlessly, \u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026 I\u2026I\u2019m okay\u2026\u201dCurrently, Gi-Gyu and Suk-Woo\u2019s mirror images were fighting Rhodes and Karen. Mirror Image was a rare skill only the strongest mage players could use. It materialized a mirror image similar to the user in terms of strength, speed, and appearance. Suk-Woo barely managed to escape death thanks to this skill.Suk-Woo sat down on the ground, panting, while Gi-Gyu watched over him. As Gi-Gyu heard the images employing their skills, he realized this was the first he was seeing Mirror Image in action.\u201cHup! Ice Sword!\u201d\u201cBoom Arrow!\u201dThankfully, the Morningstar and the Child guilds joined them, giving them the much-needed support. Rhodes and Karen were still a pain, so, concerned, Gi-Gyu looked down at Suk-Woo and asked, \u201cAre you sure you can keep fighting?\u201dSuk-Woo replied with a sluggish nod. Mirror Image was a stunning skill, but it ate up a lot of the player\u2019s energy. Consequently, most mages considered it their last resort. Knowing there was no other choice, Gi-Gyu nodded and jumped back into the battle as his mirror image fighting Rhodes blurred away.When Rhodes saw the real Gi-Gyu, he muttered in annoyance, \u201cFinally. There you are.\u201d Rhodes was having so much fun when he suddenly found himself fighting an illusion. He was furious, but because Gi-Gyu\u2019s image was fairly strong, he had to continue fighting.Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll kill you quickly.\u201d He swirled Lou and El in circles and murmured, \u201cBi.\u201d The wolf chomping down on Iron Guild members far away instantly returned and turned back into Gi-Gyu\u2019s necklace.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The sudden change in Gi-Gyu\u2019s aura confused Rhodes. He couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what changed, but a foreboding feeling engulfed Rhodes.\u201cKekeke\u2026\u201d Annoyed at the fear he was feeling, Rhodes began to giggle. He raised his long sword, aimed at Gi-Gyu, and announced, \u201cI\u2019ll do my best as well. I shall fight my guild\u2019s honor.\u201d\u201cYeah, whatever. Aren\u2019t you curious? Don\u2019t you wanna know why you were attacked the moment you landed in Korea?\u201d\u00a0Gi-Gyu asked as he gathered his magic.\u201cWhy should it matter? All we do is fight if we see an enemy.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu found Rhodes\u2019 answer odd. None of the three leaders seemed curious about why they were being attacked. They couldn\u2019t have expected this attack, so where was the curiosity? Did Ironshield only send players used to bloodshed and ambush?Gi-Gyu murmured in agreement, \u201cWell, I guess it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d After all, he was going to kill them all anyway.Gi-Gyu named two skills at the same time, \u201cElemental Dark. Binding.\u201dSlowly, darkness began enveloping Gi-Gyu, and the same darkness reached Rhodes to suffocate him.Confused, Rhodes yelled, \u201cW-what\u2019s this?! What is going on\u2026?!\u201d He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence because the darkness had grasped his neck. Soon, his confused questions turned into violent screams.A dark shape that resembled Gi-Gyu appeared nearby. As it moved its lips, Gi-Gyu\u2019s voice leaked out. \u201cI told you I\u2019ll give you a quick death.\u201d The dark, smoky figure picked up Lou and El and plunged them into Rhodes\u2019 head leisurely.[Cannibalism is being activated.][Player Rhodes is being egofied.][Egofication of Player Rhodes was successful.]***Following Tae-Shik\u2019s order, Sung-Hoon quickly entered the barrier, his destination clear: The area with the max amount of explosions.While running at max speed, Sung-Hoon saw all the corpses on the ground. Most belonged to the Iron Guild, but he could also see some from the Child and the Morningstar guilds.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d He gagged from nausea. The undead skeletons, slicing and mangling Iron Guild players, were especially gruesome. Barely managing not to vomit, Sung-Hoon continued to run.Several Yeoksam Dong high rises were destroyed beyond recognition. It was the worst war zone he had ever witnessed. It was safe to say that if hell really existed, it would look very similar to this.Sung-Hoon could hear the screams and explosions becoming louder. He was getting close. Finally, he could see the Cain, the Morningstar, and the Child guilds fighting bravely against the Iron Guild members. Sung-Hoon shouted, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d\u201cSung-Hoon?\u201d Gi-Gyu turned around mid-swing. When Sung-Hoon spotted Gi-Gyu, he yelled, \u201cYou must hurry right now!\u201dSung-Hoon dashed forward, and when he got closer, he explained, \u201cYou must get to Rogers immediately! You don\u2019t have much time left!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d The battle was nearing its end; surviving participants were all wearing crimson.Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cLee Sun-Ho is coming this way!\u201dgomi's ThoughtsGomi:\u00a0Ok, so I guess Gi-Gyu can speak English now?Sam:\u00a0Maybe he learned his lesson in the Maze of Heryond.J.Andie: Du-dun! Lee Sun-Ho is coming!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79. The Second Revenge (4)It was raining heavily, but only tension filled the area as numerous people surrounded two men.Gulp.Even the man who suggested this meeting, the Hephaestus Guild master, gulped tensely. No one expected this meeting to be this strained.With unusual politeness, Tae-Gu asked, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho?\u201d His tone was smooth, but the fury in his voice was unmistakable.\u201cI\u2019m only exercising my right,\u201d murmured a pale-faced man. Since everyone here was a top figure of the player word, they could all hear the barely audible conversation. Present in this tense environment were Lee Sun-Ho, several Angela Guild execs, guild masters of the other top ten Korean guilds, Oh Tae-Gu, and Oh Tae-Shik, and many high ranking association agents.Oh Tae-Gu announced, \u201cThe association requested everyone\u2019s cooperation, and everyone behind you agreed. I don\u2019t see the problem here, Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho.\u201d\u201cBut your request was unreasonable, and\u201d\u2014Lee Sun-Ho tilted his head rudely\u2014\u201cone of the guild masters, whose headquarter is inside the quarantined area, is very concerned. Why is the association refusing our help? We just want to help close the gate.\u201dTill now, Lee Sun-Ho had maintained a black voice and face; then, a small smile appeared on Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s face as he asked, \u201cCould it be\u2026 Are you committing something unlawful inside?\u201dLee Sun-Ho\u2019s smile widened slowly. Tae-Gu frowned in annoyance and replied, \u201cThis barrier\u2019s sole purpose is to keep the gate break inside contained. Inside, countless brave players are risking their lives to fight the monsters, so any sudden introduction of unnecessary reinforcements would b\u2014\u201d\u201cUnnecessary reinforcements? Am I unnecessary reinforcement?\u201d Lee Sun-Ho interrupted the association president. Such rude behavior drew anger from all the association agents around, increasing the tension to never seen before levels.\u201cIf I force my way in, will you stop me?\u201d Lee Sun-Ho stopped skirting around the issue and asked directly. Oh Tae-Gu promptly replied, \u201cYes.\u201dThe guild masters of the top ten guilds exclaimed in shock and outrage, \u201cH-how dare you?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s blatant disrespect, President Oh!\u201d\u201cPresident Oh Tae-Gu!\u201d\u201cPresident\u2026!\u201dSilently, Tae-Shik grasped the Behemoth\u2019s thorn, making several guild masters take a few steps back. These players were well aware of Tae-Shik\u2019s reputation as a ranker.Ignoring the ever-increasing tension levels, Lee Sun-Ho offered a compromise, \u201cThen how about this\u201d\u2014he stared straight into Tae-Gu\u2019s eyes\u2014\u201cI will enter alone. I won\u2019t take anyone with me.\u201dThe last line was followed by a massage only Oh Tae-Gu could hear:-I won\u2019t tell anyone about what I witnessed inside, Asura. In fact, I will stand with the association.***\u201cKwaaaah!\u201d The durahan threw his head like a mace while swinging his dark sword. Unfortunately, Rogers dodged this attack easily and slashed at the durahan.\u201cCurse!\u201d Before the sword wound could even appear on the durahan, the lich shouted to heal it instantly.Rogers muttered in frustration, \u201cDammit. These persistent undead creatures\u2026\u201d Rogers couldn\u2019t even take another breath before the lich shouted his various skills, \u201cCurse! Binding! Dark ball! Dark spear! Dark arrow!\u201dWhen the array of magical attacks simultaneously targeted Rogers, he swung his sword and shouted, \u201cNine!\u201dNine glowed with green light and absorbed all the magical attacks. But while Rogers was occupied with his defense, the durahan attempted another attack.\u201cKwaaaah!\u201d The durahan roared as he dashed forward. Rogers had Nine, but he could only use a part of the sword\u2019s might.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having this much difficulty with the undead monsters!\u201d Rogers grumbled in anger as he held Nine in the other hand. This holy sword always experienced a short delay after he used it.The lich laughed creepily and announced, \u201cThe grandmaster will love it.\u201d All those crystals Brunheart ate strengthened not just the skeletons but also Hart and his faithful servant, the durahan. In fact, most of the crystals were absorbed by these two monsters.However, they still weren\u2019t a match for Rogers. They could only last this long thanks to the enormous quantity of accumulated power from the crystals.\u2018But we don\u2019t have much accumulated power left.\u2019Rattle, rattle\u2026The skeleton soldiers were trying to tie up Rogers, but he killed dozens with a single swing of Nine.\u2018That sword is too destructive for our kind,\u2019\u00a0the lich thought. As could be expected, the holy sword was the undead\u2019s arch-nemesis.The lich swung his hands to summon more skills as he whispered, \u201cGrandmaster\u2026 Please hurry\u2026\u201d He had to stall until Gi-Gyu was there; unfortunately, the lich didn\u2019t have much fight left in him.***The second Gi-Gyu learned Lee Sun-Ho was coming there, he summoned Bi and rushed toward Rogers. Locating him was easy since Gi-Gyu simply headed toward Hart and the durahan\u2019s location.\u201cDammit,\u201d Gi-Gyu swore quietly. He resented that his fear of Lee Sun-Ho dictated his next move. Lee Sun-Ho was only one player, yet he wasn\u2019t someone Gi-Gyu could even dare to fight. Moreover, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know if he was an enemy or an ally, so his emotions were haywire.\u201cWhy is my strength never enough?\u201d After the Maze of Heryond, Gi-Gyu\u2019s strength had increased exponentially, resulting in him soloing some of the Iron Guild\u2019s strongest. Yet, that wasn\u2019t enough: There were still many in the world he couldn\u2019t defeat.\u201cSomeday\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu promised himself that he would be the strongest one day. Silently, he grasped Bi\u2019s mane tightly; as if it read its master\u2019s mind, the wolf began moving faster. It wasn\u2019t long before they arrived at a small corner in Yeoksam city where Rogers was dealing with the monsters.\u201cHmm.\u201d Gi-Gyu watched his enemy instead of immediately joining the fight. Quiet fury burned inside him, but this wasn\u2019t the time to act rashly. He needed to study the situation and form a plan first. Gi-Gyu knew he needed to finish this battle as quickly as possible since he hadn\u2019t much time.\u201cHart and the durahan are doing better than I expected,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in surprise. Then again, they eat almost 40 billion won\u2019s worth of crystals, so it made sense that the lich and the durahan were much stronger, but Gi-Gyu still felt very proud of them.Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t going to last much longer, even with their increased strength. Gi-Gyu studied Rogers\u2019 every movement carefully.\u201cYes\u2026!\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands trembled in pleasure as he watched Rogers fight. Yes, killing the enemy who caused him so much agony was a definite possibility now.Suddenly, Rogers took out a sword that gave off a green glow. Gi-Gyu could see that this sword increased all of Rogers\u2019s stats by almost 50 percent with this weapon.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d-Hmm.Both Gi-Gyu and Lou moaned quietly as they watched with interest. Gi-Gyu moaned because he could see that Rogers was stronger than expected, but he didn\u2019t understand why Lou moaned.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d-That is an interesting sword.-That\u2019s\u2026El chimed in for once. After a short pause, El continued.-That\u2019s a holy sword named Nine, Master.\u201cThe holy sword Nine? So does that mean if you touch it, you\u2019ll be able to absorb it, El?\u201dSince she could absorb Calleon, this one should be even simpler, right? Lou replied.-It\u2019s not that simple.El explained.-Calleon is from my lineage, so I could absorb it easily. However, Nine is kind of a distant relative. Its ability as a holy sword isn\u2019t as great as Calleon, and I do not have as much influence on it.-It\u2019s not quite a holy sword.-Indeed, Master. I agree with Lou.-In fact\u2026 Nine\u2019s closer to my lineage than hers.\u201cReally?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked with interest. This was a curious conversation; unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the time for it.\u201cWhatever.\u201d It truly didn\u2019t matter since Rogers being an easy kill would be a bonus and a source of pride if he were a strong prey. Either way, Gi-Gyu was going to enjoy this.After all, who doesn\u2019t like those little surprises life throws our way?***\u201cDammit! Dammit!\u201d Rogers roared with every swing of his sword. His frustration had reached an all-time high thanks to those undead creatures. He imagined winning this battle easily with Nine\u2019s help, but the two undead refused to die.\u201cWhere are the rest of the guild members?!\u201d Rogers shouted angrily. One side effect he suffered after receiving Nine was that his senses had dulled significantly. The Iron guild\u2019s elite teams were the best in the world, so they should\u2019ve been here by now.\u2018Why the fuck are they still not here?!\u2019\u00a0Everything annoyed and angered Rogers.\u2018I want more strength! Give me more!!!\u2019\u00a0Rogers\u2019 greed for power was incessant, as he thought strength was the key to everything. He recalled the twitching, trembling Gi-Gyu, who survived despite everything he endured. Rogers felt both envious and annoyed by Gi-Gyu.\u2018I want to destroy him.\u2019\u00a0Rogers\u2019 wish to kill Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t just because the latter stabbed his neck. There was just something so dazzling about Gi-Gyu that Rogers knew he couldn\u2019t have. So, he had to destroy it.\u201cRogers!\u201d A sudden shout pulled him out of his fantasies and made him realize Nine\u2019s side effects were worse than he anticipated. Someone familiar had jumped toward him from a high rise, but he failed to sense them despite their proximity.Feeling distracted, Rogers swung his sword again. The player who flew toward him was closing in.Clang\u2026!Kaboom!Gi-Gyu\u2019s swords crashed into Nine, causing a loud explosion. Unable to stand the incredible force, Rogers took a few steps back.\u201cDammit! Dammit!\u201d Rogers swore, shocked by the sudden appearance of such a powerful player.Gi-Gyu yelled leisurely, \u201cRogers. I\u2019ve been waiting for this day, you bastard!\u201d\u201cDo you know me?\u201d The man\u2019s fury confused Rogers because he couldn\u2019t remember the man for the life of him. Rogers continued to study Gi-Gyu when his gaze fell on the two swords.\u201cTwo swords? You\u2026? Ki-Kim Gi-Gyu?!\u201d Rogers stammered in shock.With a vicious grin, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cYup! How have you been?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dRogers couldn\u2019t hide his confusion. Kim Gi-Gyu, the player he had been dying to destroy, appeared so suddenly in front of him. For some reason, Rogers didn\u2019t recognize Gi-Gyu\u2019s face at all. The only thing that identified the player as Kim Gi-Gyu to Rogers were the two unique swords he was holding.The moment Gi-Gyu appeared, the durahan and the lich stopped attacking and stood still like statues. It seemed the whole world stopped except for Gi-Gyu and Rogers.\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?!\u201d Rogers knew he should be feeling anger, but his mind was all hazy. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he was confused or if his brain stopped working.Gi-Gyu said to his monsters, \u201cYou did very well. I appreciate your hard work.\u201d\u201cEvery moment of this battle was our honor, Grandmaster,\u201d Hart replied respectfully with a deep bow. When Gi-Gyu raised his hand toward the lich and durahan, they vanished into Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest like a genie returning to its bottle. The skeletons also stepped back and began to head elsewhere.With a smile, Gi-Gyu positioned himself for a battle and announced, \u201cLet\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201d Without giving Rogers time to reply, Gi-Gyu sprinted forward with both of his swords pointing toward Rogers.Rogers hurriedly raised Nine to block the attack. The sword\u2019s green light shone brighter, trying to engulf Gi-Gyu, but Gi-Gyu pushed forward and absorbed it instead.\u201cW\u2026what the?!\u201d Rogers stuttered in confusion. Nine had the ability to absorb life from all living creatures; that was why it could eat up Hart\u2019s skills.However, it was now Gi-Gyu doing all the absorbing. With a bright smile, Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cIt\u2019s because I have the original.\u201dgomi's ThoughtsJ.Andie: I digress, but can someone make a\u00a0mukbang\u00a0of Brunheart eating all those 40 billion won (and counting) worth of crystals?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80. The Second Revenge (5)\u201cY-you\u2026 Th-this strong? T-this doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d Rogers asked in his strained voice, barely dodging another attack. He had Nine, it hadn\u2019t been that long since the Maze of Heryond incident, and he had also grown stronger. So, how could Gi-Gyu push him into a corner?Rogers screeched again, \u201cWhat the hell do you mean by \u2018original?\u2019\u201dGi-Gyu only smiled and continued to swing his swords.\u201cBinding!\u201d The gauntlet wielding El released some sort of black energy that began tying up Rogers. Unable to move, Rogers flinched hesitantly as he witnessed the next gruesome scene.Slice.A\u00a0long cut appeared on Rogers\u2019 right arm with a slashing noise. It wasn\u2019t a deep wound, but Wound Aggravation and Bleeding, Bi\u2019s skills, made sure the severe pain left Rogers shaken to his core.Taking a slow step back, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d With a satisfied smile, he continued, \u201cThe more curious you are, the more fun I\u2019ll have! I will never tell you the answer.\u201dSwirl.Gi-Gyu playfully twirled his swords before the bound Rogers, having the time of his life. \u00a0Meanwhile, the wound on Rogers\u2019 arm refused to heal despite his high level and the immunity he had gained over the years. It seemed that he was no match for Gi-Gyu\u2019s attacks.\u201cAccckkkkk!\u201d Rogers howled in anger. His head was filled with confusion, but the increasing pain helped clear his mind a bit. Remembering his goal, he clenched his fist and punched his own face. His lips began to bleed, but he chuckled and murmured, \u201cLet\u2019s do this\u2026\u201dThe pain awoke Rogers\u2019 senses, and he decided to accept Nine\u2019s side effects to win. He decided to use every ounce of his strength to accomplish his goal just as he had always done.Watching Rogers\u2019 eyes turning sharper, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Let\u2019s have some fun\u201d\u2014he took a slow step forward\u2014\u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve been planning my revenge for a very long time.\u201dGi-Gyu's steps quickened, and he dashed forward.***Lou explained while Gi-Gyu was battling Rogers.-That\u2019s a corrupted holy sword; I wouldn\u2019t even call it a holy sword. That\u2019s why absorbing it would be hard.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond, but Lou continued,-Nine might be closer to being an evil sword at this point. As for the reason behind\u2014\u201cShut up!\u201d Gi-Gyu shouted. He was talking to Lou, but it was Rogers who responded, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?! I didn't say anything!\u201d\u201cSorry. I wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d Gi-Gyu grinned and swung Lou widely. Thinking he found a gap, Rogers plunged Nine forward, but El blocked it easily.Feeling distracted by Lou\u2019s chatter, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. This battle takes priority over your story.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?! Focus on me, you bastard!\u201d Rogers shrieked.-Tsk.Thinking Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t taking him seriously, Rogers became angrier. Ironically, Gi-Gyu was actually trying to concentrate on this battle. Gi-Gyu had been waiting for this for a long time, and he suspected his true strength would only emerge after defeating Rogers.In a bored voice, Lou suggested.-If you want this battle to last, you should take away his sword.\u201cWhat?\u201d-At this rate, Nine is going to eat him up.\u201cGot it.\u201dWith a nod, Gi-Gyu studied Rogers\u2019 movements again. He tried his best to separate Nine from his enemy, but Rogers seemed adamant about holding onto his holy sword. Gi-Gyu tried various skills, including Binding and Thundering Feet, to steal Nine, but it wasn\u2019t working: This fight seemed like Rogers\u2019s swan song.\u201cI guess I have no other choice.\u201d In the end, Gi-Gyu backed away. Thinking Gi-Gyu was trying to escape, Rogers jumped forward and shouted, \u201cFocus!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed and hurriedly blocked Nine using Lou and El.Smack!The block sent red sparks flying everywhere, and Gi-Gyu took the opportunity to punch Rogers\u2019 face. Rogers flew helplessly and landed on the ground far away. He managed to rise quickly and dashed toward Gi-Gyu again; then, he suddenly paused.\u201cDeath.\u201d When Gi-Gyu murmured, purple smoke appeared from Lou.***Sung-Hoon, the Cain guild members, Yoo Suk-Woo, Sun-Pil, Dong-Hae, and their guild members arrived and watched the battle from afar.\u201c...\u201d Most, including Sun-Pil, Dong-Hae, and the nameless guild members, were speechless.\u201cThat\u2019s Gi-Gyu?\u201d When Suk-Woo, looking pale, asked, Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHe has become unbelievably powerful\u2026\u201d Suk-Woo murmured in shock. Everyone watching the fight could tell Gi-Gyu was toying with Rogers. Meanwhile, Rogers could barely defend himself and acted like a mindless zombie.Sung-Hoon announced, \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of time.\u201dThe barrier was lifted just then, meaning Lee Sun-Ho was on his way here. Sung-Hoon yelled, \u201cPlayer Kim Gi-Gyu, you gotta finish him off quickly!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied cheerfully, Rogers roared, \u201cHow dare you?!\u201dRogers\u2019 face turned red as he shrieked in frustration, but no one listened to him. In the end, Gi-Gyu plunged his sword into Rogers\u2019 chest.Rogers staggered and screeched, \u201cArghhhhhh! Dammit! Dammit! How? Why? How did you become so powerful?!\u201dGi-Gyu swung Lou again, amputating Rogers\u2019 right hand that held Nine. Rogers\u2019 hand, still gasping Nine, fell to the ground nearby. Ignoring Rogers\u2019 pained scream, Gi-Gyu picked up Nine: It was badly damaged by now.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned as he felt some strange energy enter his body. However, apart from a little reluctance, he felt no discomfort.Lou announced in resignation.-I just don\u2019t get how your body can tolerate it.His other Egos cheered for him in the order of El, Brunheart, and Bi.-You\u2019re amazing, Master.-Master, you\u2019re the best!-Grr\u2026While his Egos were reveling in his victory, Gi-Gyu held Nine and thought about ways to use it.\u2018Can I absorb it or somehow use it in the future?\u2019\u201cOpen,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced to open his gate.It might\u2019ve seemed like an easy victory to the onlookers, but Gi-Gyu found this fight tough. The constant use of Accelerate and Rush ate a lot of his stamina, Death made his muscles ache like hell, and he now only desired the warmth of his bed. Unexpectedly, even Bi\u2019s elemental skills used a lot of his power.\u201cT-this doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 How could this happen\u2026?\u201d Collapsed on the ground, Rogers looked up at Gi-Gyu in bewilderment.\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu only smiled and looked down at Rogers quietly.\u201cDo you really think you\u2019ll survive attacking the Iron Guild like this? I may have lost, but our guild master will avenge me!\u201d Rogers screamed as his body twisted in agony. He tried his best to stand up and fight again, but it was useless.Still smiling, Gi-Gyu poured healing potions on Rogers Han\u2019s wounds.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d Watching his body heal slowly, Rogers roared. Somehow, it made him believe he had succeeded in scaring Gi-Gyu, so Rogers gleefully yelled, \u201cHehehe. I get it. You\u2019re afraid of the Iron Guild, aren\u2019t you? That makes sense. Good. If you let me live, I will not tell Ironshield what happened here. I won\u2019t tell him about you.\u201dRealizing Gi-Gyu would let him live, Rogers chuckled. Gi-Gyu smiled and asked, \u201cYou haven\u2019t checked your status screen, have you?\u201d\u201c...?\u201d Why was Gi-Gyu asking him such a strange question? Rogers shivered as an ominous feeling engulfed him. He could feel the weakness\u2014it was as if he had aged dozens of years during this battle. Pretending not to care, Rogers opened his status screen.\u201c...!\u201d Rogers\u2019 eyes widened when he saw how meager his attributes had become. His level was still the same, but most of his attributes and skills had disappeared.With a satisfied smile, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you curious why this happened? Too bad, I don\u2019t plan on telling.\u201d\u201cArghhh! I\u2019ll kill you! No matter what happens, I\u2019m going to end you! I will torture you again! I\u2019ll strip your flesh from your bones and rip your veins out!\u201d Rogers screeched, but Gi-Gyu remained calm and lifted him by his neck. \u201cSorry, but that\u2019s not gonna happen. In fact, I\u2019m going to be the one doing those things to you.\u201dRogers flailed like a fish, too weak to resist.\u201cOpen,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. His gate opened again, and as he threw Rogers inside. \u201cStay there. Eat, get healthy, and wait for my return. Soon, I\u2019ll send you a companion\u2014Ironshield. Hart!\u201d-Yes, Grandmaster.\u201cKeep him alive. Make sure he\u2019s healthy. You can use as many potions as you need from my stash. He can barely fight a single skeleton soldier anymore, so he won\u2019t be any threat to you.\u201d-Your wish is my command.Gi-Gyu watched emotionlessly as the skeleton soldiers dragged Rogers away. \u00a0\u201cOh, and Hart. Keep Nine safe too.\u201d-Of course, Grandmaster.After closing the gate, Gi-Gyu thought about Nine.\u2018This sword eats up its master\u2019s attributes.\u2019According to Lou, Nine took the stats of all its lesser masters and absorbed their enemy\u2019s life force in return. Once it found a worthy master, it would bestow them all the accumulated stats. Therefore, Nine was closer to being an evil sword than a holy one.\u2018I don\u2019t know what Ironshield was planning, but I know one thing: He did this to steal Rogers\u2019 power.\u2019Ironshield used Rogers as a tool, and it helped Gi-Gyu gain another piece of the puzzle.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Gi-Gyu staggered from pain as Sung-Hoon shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cUgh, he isn\u2019t even giving me any time to rest,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. He could feel the massive aura tsunami heading toward them. It seemed Lee Sun-Ho didn\u2019t feel it necessary to hide his presence.\u201cOh my, I guess it\u2019s all over now,\u201d Lee Sun-Ho announced.***The man had an emotionless and pale face, but the entire world recognized him since his name was synonymous with power.Lee Sun-Ho placed Korea on the map and was the guild master of the most famous guild. He wore an ordinary outfit, but this didn\u2019t change that he was Korea\u2019s pride.Suk-Woo and the rest stayed behind and watched tensely as Lee Sun-Ho studied Gi-Gyu.\u201cAre you Kim Gi-Gyu?\u201d Lee Sun-Ho asked.\u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u201cWith that unusual eye color, one has to be blind not to recognize you.\u201d Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s familiar attitude confused Gi-Gyu. At first, Gi-Gyu was surprised to learn that Lee Sun-Ho knew his name; soon, he realized that this made sense: Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s Angela Guild was one of the few groups more powerful than the association.Looking around, Lee Sun-Ho murmured, \u201cThis is very odd.\u201d Turning toward Gi-Gyu again, he continued, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a gate break occurred here at all.\u201dThe hurricane of violent aura made Gi-Gyu gulp nervously. However, he knew that Lee Sun-Ho was being respectful by only showing a part of his true strength. Yes, that aura hurricane was just a part.Lee Sun-Ho added, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u2018Go Hyung-Chul told me Lee Sun-Ho was badly wounded, but other than looking pale, he looks perfectly fine.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought as he watched Lee Sun-Ho.Running toward them, Sung-Hoon hurriedly stated, \u201cAngela Guild\u2019s Guild Master Lee Sun-Ho! I\u2019m Heo Sung-Hoon from the association! Everything has been dealt with here. All the monsters from the gate break have been killed. We even took care of the boss monster too. Unfortunately, some Iron Guild members died in the process. Oh, and the rest suffered great losses too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Lee Sun-Ho replied. With a smile, he continued, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really matter. I already know that you people took care of the Iron Guild. Well, its Korean branch anyway.\u201dNo one said a word. Gi-Gyu studied Lee Sun-Ho with interest and used his sense to make an educated guess.\u2018If I fight him now, will I have a chance? Is a nick possible if I go all out and even use Death?\u2019-Don\u2019t be an idiot and just stay still.-Master, no.-Master! You can\u2019t fight him! Never!Gi-Gyu had to agree with his Egos since he also knew the answer in his heart of hearts. There was a very good reason why Lee Sun-Ho was considered the strongest player in the world.When neither Sung-Hoon nor Gi-Gyu replied, Lee Sun-Ho said again, \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\u201cThen why did you come here? If you aren\u2019t concerned about what happened, I would like to know why you bothered coming here.\u201d Everyone here came because they believed in Gi-Gyu and risked their lives to help him take revenge. So, even as his joints ached tensely, he stepped forward.Gi-Gyu was grateful to them all, so he felt responsible for their lives. A fight with Lee Sun-Ho could harm his friends, so he had to prevent that at all costs.Lee Sun-Ho announced, \u201cI made a deal with the Iron Guild.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu had already heard this from Go Hyung-Chul. He still didn\u2019t know the details of this deal, but he suspected one thing.\u2018It must have something to do with Lucifer.\u2019Lee Sun-Ho continued, \u201cThe Iron Guild promised to give me something I want if I help it establish a branch in Korea. More specifically, I was told I will get to meet the person who has what I want.\u201d\u201cThe elixir\u2026.\u201d When Gi-Gyu whispered, Lee Sun-Ho didn\u2019t deny it. Lying and hiding information at this point was a waste of time and effort.Lee Sun-Ho nodded, closed his eyes, and explained, \u201cAnd the only one who has the elixir at the moment is Lucifer. So if you don\u2019t want me to rip your heir into shreds, you better\u201d\u2014he opened his blood-red eyes with a smile\u2014\u201d show yourself now, Lucifer. It\u2019s time.\u201dGi-Gyu asked in confusion, \u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026?\u201d\u201c...?\u201d Sung-Hoon\u2019s eyes widened in confusion, but Gi-Gyu gasped as he realized what was happening.Suddenly, two figures, a man and a woman, appeared out of thin air in front of Gi-Gyu. The familiar woman with violet eyes and black hair grumbled, \u201cYou call yourself god\u2019s messenger, but you play dirty like this.\u201dTurning toward Gi-Gyu with a bright smile, she greeted, \u201cLong time no see!\u201dIt was Lucifer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81. The Reunion with LuciferSung-Hoon asked in a panic, \u201cD-did you say Lucifer?!\u201dSuk-Woo looked rigid, while the rest of the confused players took several steps back. With a kind smile, Lucifer murmured, \u201cI think I scared your friends, Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t say a word. Even though Jung Soo-Jung greeted him in a friendly manner, he couldn\u2019t help becoming even tenser.\u2018I couldn\u2019t feel her presence at all.\u2019\u00a0Had Lucifer been an enemy, he would\u2019ve died since he failed to notice how close she was before she revealed herself.Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s stiff countenance, Jung Soo-Jung scratched her cheek and murmured, \u201cI meant to surprise you, but I guess you don't like it. Umm, well\u2026 Whatever! I\u2019ll talk to you about it later.\u201dJung Soo-Jung turned toward Lee Sun-Ho and asked, \u201cSo I heard you need the elixir?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI can see why.\u201d Lucifer\u2019s violet eyes glowed eerily as she continued, \u201cYour \u2018shell\u2019 is too damaged.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Lee Sun-Ho didn\u2019t respond.The violet glow in her eyes subsided a bit as Jung Soo-Jung added, \u201cBut you know\u2026\u201dAs Jung Soo-Jung\u2019s aura relaxed, an uncomfortable silence fell, but Jung Soo-Jung and Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s presences were louder than ever. Only the players around the two could see their magic storms roaring and clashing.Plop.The insidious magic began suffocating all the players in the area. The weakest ones collapsed first: the Morningstar Guild members, the Child Guild members, the Cain guild members, Sun-Pil, and Dong-Hae last. Only Jung Soo-Jung, Baal, Lee Sun-Ho, Sung-Hoon, Suk-Woo, and Gi-Gyu were left standing.Finally, Jung Soo-Jung said, \u201cAre we friends? Why would I give you my elixir?\u201dLee Sun-Ho replied, \u201cI would like to make a deal with you.\u201d\u201cA deal\u2026\u201d Jung Soo-Jung scratched her cheek again as if bored. Meanwhile, Baal, the man in glasses, stood quietly and glared at Lee Sun-Ho.Jung Soo-Jung continued with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna make a deal with you. After all, the elixir will only be wasted on you. It\u2019s not like it can heal your shell; it\u2019ll only slow down the corruption.\u201dSuddenly, Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s figure began to distort; in the blink of an eye, a snow-white full-plated armor covered him, and a sword appeared in each of his hands.\u2018The sword of purity?\u2019\u00a0Watching Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s swords, Gi-Gyu noticed something odd. Lou muttered,-Yes, those are holy swords too.Tinged with bitterness, El added.-But they are stronger than the current me.***\u201cYou think you can handle a battle right now?\u201d Jung Soo-Jung vanished and reappeared much closer to Lee Sun-Ho. She caressed his cheek, but Lee Sun-Ho remained stoic. Usually, Jung Soo-Jung seemed tomboyish; now, she looked impossibly seductive.She continued, \u201cYou may be powerful, but beating both Baal and I won\u2019t be easy.\u201dJung Soo-Jung suddenly dissipated into violet smoke before reappearing beside Gi-Gyu. \u201cThis whole place will burn to the ground\u2026 I thought you didn\u2019t like to kill. Am I wrong?\u201dLee Sun-Ho finally opened his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t get to pick and choose now.\u201d\u201cHehehe, yeah. I can see that you\u2019ve got nothing to lose now.\u201d Jung Soo-Jung giggled before calling her minion\u2019s name, \u201cBaal.\u201dBaal silently took out the elixir from his bag, drawing the eyes of even those kneeling. This magical purple liquid was truly a treasure one couldn\u2019t buy even with all the money in the world. Gi-Gyu, who had recently benefited from it, knew its value better than anyone.Jung Soo-Jung asked coldly, \u201cAnd if I agree to this deal, what will you offer me?\u201dGi-Gyu realized he could never fully figure Lucifer out: Seconds before, she was preparing for war; now, she was negotiating. Gi-Gyu watched quietly without making any attempt to get involved. His instinct told him this was the best thing he could do right now. In fact, it was the\u00a0only\u00a0thing he could do under that enormous pressure.[An unbearable amount of magic is pressuring your body.][Your stamina will suffer continuous exertion.]Lee Sun-Ho offered, \u201cI will let everyone here live, including your heir.\u201d\u201cAnd you won\u2019t touch him for a whole year. Agreed?\u201d When Jung Soo-Jung suggested, Lee Sun-Ho nodded and replied, \u201cAgreed.\u201d\u201cDone.\u201d Jung Soo-Jung took the bottle of elixir from Baal and threw it toward Lee Sun-Ho. Lee Sun-Ho caught it easily, and his outfit quickly turned into his normal outfit. He was about to turn around and leave when Jung Soo-Jung demanded, \u201cNow, swear it on your god.\u201dLee Sun-Ho paused and mouthed something silently. Only Jung Soo-Jung seemed to have heard it since she nodded with a satisfied look. Then, Lee Sun-Ho, the subversive emperor, left without acknowledging anyone.Psssh!The area where Jung Soo-Jung and Lee Sun-Ho stood began to crumble down. Even the surrounding buildings turned to dust, failing to withstand the two players\u2019 aura tempest.Plop.Finally, the still-standing players caved and plopped to the ground; Gi-Gyu was no exception.Shaking his head, Sung-Hoon muttered, \u201cBy the way, that woman is Lucifer\u2014\u201d Sung-Hoon abruptly stopped talking when he saw Lucifer walking up to Gi-Gyu.Lucifer said to Sung-Hoon and Suk-Woo, \u201cYou can take care of the cleanup, right?\u201d\u201c...?\u201d Sung-Hoon remained speechless, but Suk-Woo nodded quietly.\u201cThen you know what, my pupil?\u201d When Soo-Jung turned toward Gi-Gyu, he asked, \u201cYes\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d Jung Soo-Jung touched Gi-Gyu\u2019s shoulder and disappeared. The battleground was now missing Lucifer, Gi-Gyu, and Baal.***\u201cSo he opened the evil eye all on his own? What a ridiculous child.\u201d Soo-Jung murmured.\u201cThis just proves that you chose the right man. He is worthy of your attention,\u201d Baal replied. Listening to their conversation, Gi-Gyu finally opened his eyes.Turning toward Gi-Gyu, Jung Soo-Jung asked, \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake?\u201d She was holding a teacup in her hand.Gi-Gyu asked in confusion, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d He had no idea how long he had been unconscious. He looked around before answering his own question in awe, \u201cIsn\u2019t this my basement?\u201d Indeed, the trio was in Gi-Gyu\u2019s renovated basement; his family was upstairs. Despite knowing Lucifer wouldn\u2019t harm his family, he couldn\u2019t help but feel anxious.\u2018She had to give up her elixir again because of me.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. Perhaps the elixir held no sway over her, but she still did give away the greatest treasure in the world for him. It was clear that Gi-Gyu was indispensable to her, so it wouldn\u2019t have made sense for her to harm his family.Jung Soo-Jung took a sip of her tea and looked at Gi-Gyu. She asked, \u201cIs there anything you want to say to me?\u201d\u201cHave you been watching me this entire time?\u201d Gi-Gyu touched his violet right eye. Many factors like her quick arrival on the battlefield, her presence in his basement, and so on brought him to a conclusion. Lucifer could watch him through his violet eye, the evil eye.\u201cYup.\u201d When Jung Soo-Jung answered without hesitation, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know what to feel. Sitting up on the sofa, he murmured, \u201cYou really need to respect my privacy.\u201dHis whole body ached; sadly, potions couldn\u2019t fix this kind of pain.With a playful grin, Jung Soo-Jung asked, \u201cAre you feeling shy right now? You are so cute!\u201dGi-Gyu should have gotten angry, but his debt to Lucifer didn\u2019t let him. Thanks to Jung Soo-Jung, his mother was alive, and he became stronger much faster. On top of that, she protected him from Lee Sun-Ho just now.They were bound to each other by a contract. But even without this, Gi-Gyu had no choice but to do as Soo-Jung asked. She was much more powerful than him, and Gi-Gyu knew it wouldn\u2019t take much on her part to destroy him if he protested.Many thoughts crossed his mind when he suddenly heard Jung Soo-Jung\u2019s voice. She ordered, \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it.\u201dShe finished her tea and continued, \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything to you in time.\u201d She threw the teacup in the air; Baal caught it, and put it inside his bag as if this happened all the time. Jung Soo-Jung stood up and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce them to me?\u201d\u201c...?\u201dShe smiled and offered her hand. When Gi-Gyu took it and stood up, she explained, \u201cYou need to introduce me to your family.\u201d***Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his discomfort. Although he felt certain Lucifer wouldn\u2019t harm his family, he couldn\u2019t gather why this meeting was necessary.Upon asking, she gave him a surprising reason. After what happened earlier, many players and groups would be looking for her. It was unwanted attention, so she needed a place to stay.Also, she wanted to spend more time with Gi-Gyu, so his house became the perfect spot. After promising not to harm his family or use any skills or magic, Gi-Gyu finally allowed her upstairs. He knew that even if she broke her promise and tried to harm his family, there would be nothing he could do to stop her. But the promise still made him feel better.\u2018By the way, what happened to the association's promise of protecting my family? I guess even the association is helpless against Lucifer.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought worriedly. Oh Tae-Gu reassured him that the association would protect his family to its best ability. But someone like Lucifer couldn't be stopped. Gi-Gyu suspected that the association probably didn\u2019t even know that Lucifer was in his home right now.Gi-Gyu made a quick call to Tae-Shik. Lucifer brought him back home without his permission, but this still was not a good excuse for him to leave without cleaning up the mess he had made in Yeoksam city. He needed to know how things were going back in Yeoksam city.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Yeah,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied on the phone. Thankfully, the cleanup in Yeoksam was going swimmingly. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201dIn the 24 hours Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t there, things took an unexpected turn; Lee Sun-Ho actually helped with the cleanup. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling like things had gotten much more complicated. He scratched his head in worry, but there was nothing he could do about it at the moment.Tae-Shik said to Gi-Gyu on the phone.-Just keep an eye on her. If anything happens, call me. Just focus on your situation right now, and don't worry about here.\u201cThanks, Hyung.\u201dTheir call ended quickly. Gi-Gyu felt guilty for having others take care of the Yeoksam city cleanup, but Tae-Shik was right. He needed to concentrate on his current situation. Because right at this very moment, Jung Soo-Jung was in his living room eating dinner with his family.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed as he shook his head. To his surprise, Gi-Gyu felt rather peaceful considering everything that had happened so far. Was it because his situation had become so complicated that his brain stopped processing it all? Or could it be that he only felt this way even though his situation hadn\u2019t changed at all?-I can\u2019t believe there is magic I am not aware of.Lou grumbled in annoyance since he also failed to sense Lucifer. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know if it was because Lou had lost his memories or for another reason. Like how Lou didn\u2019t know much about the evil eye even though it stemmed from magic. But Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t blame Lou for anything. He murmured, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to do more research.\u201dAnyway, Lucifer was going to stay with him for a while now.\u201cHahaha, Mrs. Lee! Look at your skin! I thought you were in your 20s!\u201d Soo-Jung exclaimed.\u201cOh my! Soo-Jung, you\u2019re such a kind girl!\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother replied with a giggle.\u201cAnd did you say your name is Yoo-Jung? You have amazing skin too!\u201d When Soo-Jung complimented Gi-Gyu\u2019s sister, Yoo-Jung exclaimed, \u201cOh! You\u2019re so nice!\u201dGi-Gyu watched the three women in his living room and shook his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82. The Reunion with Lucifer (2)\u201cGi-Gyu! Just where did you find this pretty little lady?\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother asked with a bright smile.\u201cI thought you liked men, Oppa!\u201d Yoo-Jung added with a grin.It had been a while since Gi-Gyu saw such laughter and glee in his family; sadly, he had the infamous Lucifer Jung Soo-Jung to thank for it.In a shockingly honeyed voice, Lucifer replied, \u201cHahaha! You have such good eyes, Mrs. Lee! Yes, I am indeed gorgeous!\u201d\u2018W-what? When did she become this sweet and girly?! Gotta stop this! Like right now!Gi-Gyu walked up to Soo-Jung and murmured, \u201cUmm, Soo-Jung, we should go talk in private for a moment\u2026\u201d When Gi-Gyu tried to take Soo-Jung away, Yoo-Jung narrowed her eyes and asked suspiciously, \u201cHmm. What are you two planning to do alone?\u201dSoo-Jung gave Yoo-Jung a knowing smile while Gi-Gyu stammered, \u201cW-what? What? What do you mean?!\u201d Gi-Gyu had never been a part of such a misunderstanding, so he was quite flustered.Suddenly, an idea struck him, and he announced, \u201cOh, a puppy!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d When Yoo-Jung exclaimed in confusion, Gi-Gyu continued, \u201cI got a puppy for you! Wait here!\u201dGi-Gyu ran out to the garden while Yoo-Jung and their mother followed him slowly.\u201cHehehe!\u201d Soo-Jung chuckled in amusement as she followed as well.When he was alone in the garden, Gi-Gyu grabbed his necklace and whispered, \u201cBi, transform into a miniature version.\u201dThe necklace glowed and gradually transformed into a puppy instead of its usual giant wolf form. Gi-Gyu grabbed it with his hands and turned to look at Yoo-Jung.\u201cW-what?! Kyaaaa! So cute!\u201d Yoo-Jung\u2019s eyes widened as she dashed forward. Trying very hard not to scare Bi, Yoo-Jung studied it in excitement. She exclaimed in awe, \u201cUwaaah! What kind of dog is it? I\u2019ve never seen one like this!\u201dBi was a wolf monster with a unique blue and red fur combination. In its current form, it also had some faint black fur.Yoo-Jung asked, \u201cOppa! You didn\u2019t dye its hair to make it look pretty, did you? Do you have any idea how bad that is for puppies?!\u201d\u201cNo, and that\u2019s natural,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied as he handed Bi to Yoo-Jung. Since Bi had unwavering loyalty toward Gi-Gyu, the wolf also felt close to his family and remained docile in Yoo-Jung\u2019s arms.\u201cWoof!\u201d\u201cOh my god! He\u2019s so cute!\u201d When Yoo-Jung exclaimed, Bi barked adorably a few more times, \u201cWoof! Woof!\u201dYoo-Jung couldn\u2019t help rubbing her cheek against the cute puppy. Watching with a relieved smile, Gi-Gyu explained, \u201cI already named it.\u201d\u201cOkay! What is it?\u201d\u201cHis name is Bi,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu as he patted the puppy\u2019s head, making Bi purr in pleasure. Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother also walked over and patted it as she said, \u201cWhat a cute puppy!\u201d***After using Bi to get out of the embarrassing situation, Gi-Gyu tried to hurriedly usher Soo-Jung to the downstairs basement. Yoo-Jung saw this and narrowed her eyes at him again. Thankfully, when Baal joined Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung, Yoo-Jung\u2019s suspicious look disappeared.When they were finally alone, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhy put that show upstairs?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Soo-Jung sat nonchalantly on a sofa and added, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get closer to my pupil\u2019s family.\u201dWhen Soo-Jung grinned, Gi-Gyu sighed deeply, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dCurrently, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mind was plagued with worries and questions, yet Soo-Jung was here, delaying his plan. What was the Iron Guild's reaction? What about the public? The association? How did the Cain Guild and the others who helped him fare after the vicious battle? How many didn\u2019t make it from the incident? Was everything being taken care of in Yeoksam? Were there any immediate threats he should worry about?He had so many unanswered questions, but he had no time to deal with them.Oh, and that was after skipping the issues called Nine and Rogers.\u201cWhat are you so worried about?\u201d asked Soo-Jung, uncaring. \u201cThose people who helped you are all professionals, you know.\u201dWhen Soo-Jung raised her hand, Baal took out a teapot and a teacup from his bag and handed them to her. \u201cJust how big was that bag?\u201d some curious fella might ask, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t bother asking.Soo-Jung continued, \u201cThey all chose to help you, which means they\u2019re responsible for their own actions. And it's not like they are getting nothing for playing their part. Besides, I doubt you can do anything to help them.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu understood Soo-Jung\u2019s point. While he was a one-person team and had to take care of everything alone or ask for help from others, his friends had their respective groups to depend on.Soo-Jung added, \u201cWhatever they are doing to clean up the mess is something they must do. You, alone, won\u2019t add much to their effort. So don\u2019t worry about it. Your time will be best spent with me right now.\u201dSoo-Jung\u2019s violet eyes turned tranquil again. She studied him and continued, \u201cWhat you need to do right now is become strong.\u201d\u2018She is right. Time to put my worries to rest.\u2019When Gi-Gyu sat down on one of the chairs, an awkward silence fell in the basement. Soo-Jung, Baal, and Gi-Gyu sat together and remained quiet.Suddenly, Gi-Gyu realized that he needed to figure out how to address Lucifer. He murmured, \u201cUmm\u2026 Miss Soo-Jung\u2026? Or Lord Lucifer? Just Lucifer?\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s confusion tickled Soo-Jung\u2019s funny bone; she gave him a quick solution. \u201cHahaha, what the heck are you doing? Just call me Soo-Jung. We\u2019re the same age anyway.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn't hide his shock. Feeling irritated, Soo-Jung frowned and asked, \u201cWhy do you look so shocked that I\u2019m the same age? Do I look that old?\u201d\u201cN-no! It\u2019s just that you seem to know so much more than me, and\u2026 You\u2019re so ex-experienced,\u201d stammered Gi-Gyu. Based on just her appearance, Soo-Jung looked younger than Gi-Gyu. However, her demeanor was very mature, so Gi-Gyu always assumed she was older than him.\u201cWell, I have a good reason for that. But\u00a0my earth age\u00a0is the same as yours, so just treat me like your friend. You may be my pupil, but you don\u2019t have to act all formal and respectful toward me.\u201dFeeling more at ease now, Gi-Gyu stated, \u201cAll right. Then I\u2019ll call you Soo-Jung from now on.\u201d\u201cI like how you switched your tone so quickly,\u201d Soo-Jung replied with a giggle.Gi-Gyu found this new situation oddly comfortable since he had always feared meeting new people and allowing them into his personal space, but he found Soo-Jung an exception. They didn\u2019t exactly meet under the best of the circumstances, and their relationship was a strange one. So, why did he feel like this about her?\u201cIt\u2019s because our relationship is a strictly business one,\u201d answered Soo-Jung as if she could read Gi-Gyu\u2019s thoughts.\u201cCould it be that the evil eye allows you to read my mind as well?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked cautiously. If this were true, it would be a big problem.\u201cWhat are you talking about? I could just read it on your face, that\u2019s all,\u201d replied Soo-Jung quickly. Sure she wasn\u2019t lying, Gi-Gyu touched his face and wondered,\u2018Am I that easy to read?\u2019-Of course. Why is that even a question?-Unfortunately, I must agree with Lou, Master.-That\u2019s right! You\u2019re an open book, Master!Lou, El, and Brunheart\u2019s voice echoed in his head. Since even his Egos believed this, Gi-Gyu had no choice but to accept it as fact. Another silence fell, but it wasn\u2019t as awkward as the first one.Within a few minutes, Soo-Jung announced, \u201cYou must have many questions, don\u2019t you? You must be wondering how I appeared at the perfect time back then. Also, why I made that deal so readily as if I already knew everything. You\u2019re free to ask me anything you want.\u201dBetraying Soo-Jung\u2019s expectation, Gi-Gyu asked something completely different.\u201cWhat\u2019s the evil eye? I thought I had a decent understanding of black magic[1], but I don\u2019t know what the evil eye does.\u201dThe evil eye came under black magic, Lou\u2019s territory, but what Lou knew about it didn\u2019t apply to Gi-Gyu\u2019s evil eye. One day, the color of his right eye changed suddenly; with that, his personality also began changing. So, knowledge about the evil eye took priority over many things for Gi-Gyu.In a bitter voice, Soo-Jung replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u201d\u2014she sighed\u2014\u201cIt has been a long time since I returned to Korea. Can we talk at a cafe or something?\u201dA deep sadness fell on her face; surprised by her reaction, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t refuse her request.***\u2018I think I really chose the location of our house well.\u2019The Bukhan River area was known for its numerous cafes. They were inside one of the pretty coffee shops, and Soo-Jung was enjoying the river view while sipping coffee, seemingly pleased with the location Gi-Gyu chose. Meanwhile, Baal remained seated with his usual emotionless look.\u2018Maybe I can ask about Baal\u2019s identity now,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought expectantly. He had been curious about Baal since the first time they met. Baal undoubtedly had an odd look to him, and Gi-Gyu remembered Jung Soo-Jung telling Lee Sun-Ho that fighting both of them would be difficult.So who was Baal?Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t hesitate long before he asked bluntly, \u201cIs Baal a player?\u201d What he really wanted to know was if Baal was a human, but asking that would be too rude, so he picked his words carefully.Soo-Jung smiled innocently at Gi-Gyu, sending a chill down his spine. Lucifer was renowned as the cruelest and most vicious high ranker despite not being a red player. That innocent smile didn\u2019t suit her code name one bit.\u201cHe isn\u2019t a player,\u201d answered Soo-Jung.\u201c...?\u201d When Gi-Gyu waited for her to give him a real answer, Soo-Jung asked instead, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your sword?\u201dGi-Gyu flinched at first, but he nodded in the end. Before he even voiced his question in his head, Lou muttered.-He\u2019s a demon.\u2018What?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu shouted in his head.-I said he\u2019s a demon. And he\u2019s one of the most villainous of them all. In the past, he used to be\u2026Suddenly, Baal rose, and darkness fell around him like a black curtain. Gi-Gyu worried the other people around them might find this odd, but no one noticed anything. Then, Gi-Gyu realized the darkness was some form of a barrier.Baal greeted formally, \u201cThe great emperor of all demons\u2026 Greetings to his grandmaster.\u201dBaal kneeled on one knee in front of Gi-Gyu. Soo-Jung\u2019s face remained blank, while Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his shock. Meanwhile, Lou smirked loudly.-Hmph!Knowing Baal couldn\u2019t hear Lou, Gi-Gyu said to Baal, \u201cHe says \u2018Hmph!\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat? Pffttt! Hahahaha!\u201d Soo-Jung burst into laughter at Gi-Gyu\u2019s words, while Baal maintained his usual calm. Soo-Jung asked after laughing for a bit, \u201cYour new name is Lou, right?\u201d-Indeed.\u201c...?\u201d Gi-Gyu gaped in surprise. Soo-Jung talked directly to Lou. He stuttered, \u201cC-could it be\u2026? You can hear my Egos?\u201d\u201cEgos? Ah, so they\u2019re called Egos, huh?\u201d Soo-Jung had laughed so hard that tears rolled down her eyes. Wiping them away, she replied, \u201cYeah, I can hear them.\u201d1. Black Magic is a skill, while black magic is a type of magic.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83. The Reunion with Lucifer (3)Gi-Gyu had a hard time believing there was another person who could hear his Egos.-Why are you so shocked? That woman is already sharing your sight; how hard could getting access to our conversation be?When Lou muttered, Gi-Gyu grumbled silently, \u2018You didn\u2019t have to spell it out like that. I could\u2019ve figured it out soon enough.\u2019Soo-Jung said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cYou know, you can just speak aloud.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d Gi-Gyu paused before asking, \u201cYou just read my thoughts, didn\u2019t you?\u201dSoo-Jung smiled and answered, \u201cNo. I could only hear the conversation you had in your head; I can\u2019t read your thoughts.\u201dThere were no two ways about it. It was as suspicious an explanation as could be. Thankfully, Lou verified the truth for him.-She\u2019s telling the truth.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed and pressed his forehead. The more answers he received, the more confused he became. \u201cHaa\u2026 This is just too much for me. Let\u2019s focus on one thing at a time.\u201d\u201cI guess my pupil isn\u2019t as smart as I hoped,\u201d Soo-Jung murmured. Immediately, the Egos chimed in.-This is true.While Lou agreed, the other Egos protested.-Do not disrespect the Master.-Our Master isn\u2019t stupid!Gi-Gyu felt grateful to El and Brunheart while he contemplated banging Lou on the ground. Shaking her head, Soo-Jung continued, \u201cI\u2019ll explain this situation. Baal wasn\u2019t showing respect to Lou just now.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d\u201cHe was greeting you.\u201d Soo-Jung pointed at Gi-Gyu.Lou added.-That jerk Baal was one of the traitors that betrayed me in the past.\u201cWhat?\u201d When Gi-Gyu exclaimed in shock, Soo-Jung replied, \u201cJust like your Ego explained, Baal is one of the demons that rebelled and imprisoned their emperor. To Baal, Lou is just a fallen monarch; you are someone who made the former emperor your minion.\u201dBaal nodded in agreement.-That jerk is so annoying.Lou muttered, but the statement had no real anger. Gi-Gyu suspected that Lou\u2019s anger disappeared along with his memories, so he patted Lou in sympathy. Betrayal was never pleasant, and then to have to forget the anger also must have been horrendous.Lou murmured,-I don\u2019t need your pity. It was my choice to do this.Soo-Jung replied to Lou with a grin, \u201cAh, your attitude is impressive.\u201dNoticing they were straying from the main topic, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the business at hand. I need some answers.\u201dWhen Soo-Jung nodded in agreement, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s start with the evil eye.\u201d***With a relaxed expression, Soo-Jung began, \u201cTo give you a comprehensive answer, we need to first talk about the secret behind the Tower\u201d\u2014she shook her head\u2014 \u201cBut you aren\u2019t worthy.\u201d\u201cNot worthy?\u201d\u201cHaaa\u2026 Remember what I told you before? I said, \u2018Come see me after passing the 50th-floor test.\u2019 However, I had no choice but to meet you before because of some unexpected circumstances. But until you pass the 50th-floor test, I can\u2019t tell you about it.\u201dSoo-Jung yawned as if bored, and Gi-Gyu fell in deep thought.\u2018Does this mean the 50th floor is different? I thought even the test would be the same, but it seems the 50th floor holds a secret. No wonder not much is known about this floor.\u2019Soo-Jung continued, \u201cMuch time has passed since the former king of demons was imprisoned. Many things have happened since then. And as you can see, Baal and the other demons aren\u2019t completely loyal to their current ruler.\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply, feeling his time would be better spent focusing on her words so that he could remember everything.Soo-Jung added, \u201cThe evil eye isn\u2019t common, but it isn\u2019t a special ability either. Most high-level demons have it.\u201dLou had already told Gi-Gyu about everything Lucifer had said until now, but they were finally getting into the main topic. Soo-Jung continued, \u201cBut even among evil eyes, there are some special ones. Over many generations, this ability has changed and improved, but it has remained exclusive to demons.\u201dSoo-Jung\u2019s eyes changed from violet to red to green and then finally to black. She murmured, \u201cI can use all types of evil eyes.\u201d-Nonsense. You\u2019re lying. Just because your eye color changes doesn\u2019t mean you can use all types of evil eyes.Lou smirked and added.-Even I don\u2019t recollect ever being able to use all of them. So how dare you claim\u2014\u201cBut you were a full-fledged demon, remember?\u201d When Soo-Jung asked, Lou became quiet.She continued, \u201cA demon can only have one type of evil eye, but I\u2019m different.\u201dSince Lou no longer interrupted her, Soo-Jung explained, \u201cThe evil eye is one way to distinguish a demon\u2019s rank. Green is the lowest, while red means middle-rank or higher.\u201dGi-Gyu, who had kept quiet till now, finally asked, \u201cAnd violet?\u201dSoo-Jung giggled and replied, \u201cOnly the royals have it.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d\u201cOnly the highest level demons possess this color since it's the strongest type of evil eye out there.\u201d Slightly confused, Soo-Jung asked, \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t know about this?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply since Lou really hadn\u2019t told him much about the evil eye. Touching his right eye, he cautiously asked, \u201cSo why and how did I get this violet evil eye?\u201d\u201cWho knows? I didn\u2019t expect you to awaken an evil eye. Like I said\u201d\u2014she grinned teasingly\u2014\u201conly demons have the evil eye.\u201d***Their party left the cafe before long, partly because Soo-Jung felt better but mainly because Gi-Gyu needed some alone time to think. Then, they returned to Gi-Gyu\u2019s basement together.His face tense, he wondered, \u2018So the evil eye represents demons, so the fact that I have one must mean\u2026\u2019Was he a demon? What about his parents? How did he become a player then?Gi-Gyu glanced at Baal. He looked like a human.\u00a0He looked nothing like the fourth-floor guardian and the lowest level demons Perez, Ramus, or the others.\u00a0Now that he thought about it, Lou\u2019s physical form was also that of a human.Suddenly realizing something, Gi-Gyu asked loudly, \u201cHey, Soo-Jung! What about you? Are you a demon too?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu spoke more familiarly, Soo-Jung smiled and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re finally acting more comfortable around me.\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t bother repeating his question. When he remained quiet, she finally replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a human.\u201d\u201cThen how did you get the evil eye?\u201d When he asked, a bitter expression appeared on Soo-Jung\u2019s face. She murmured, \u201cI\u2019m a special case. Of course, there is a chance you\u2019re a special case too.\u201dFeeling he was getting close to the answer, Gi-Gyu prodded, \u201cSpecial case?\u201dSuddenly, Soo-Jung began removing her top. Gi-Gyu's eyes widened before he covered them and tried to shout, but Baal removed his hands from his face and pointed at Soo-Jung.Thankfully, she was wearing her underwear. When Gi-Gyu saw her body, he gasped.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThere was a small jewel on her chest. When he looked closer, he saw that the jewel resembled a cat's face. It reminded him of Brunheart on his own body and made him feel strangely closer to her.Soo-Jung explained, \u201cI got it transplanted from a demon. This is another form of Baal. Because of him, I\u2019m now a half-demon, half-human creature. As someone on the edge of the two worlds, I can use several special abilities.\u201dListening to Soo-Jung\u2019s explanation, Gi-Gyu realized something. She must have also gone through many hardships like him that she couldn\u2019t talk about or even explain to anyone else.Soo-Jung continued, \u201cBaal\u2019s cat jewel has the same predatory power as Lou\u2019s. Of course, Baal\u2019s power is more limited and comes with serious side effects, unlike Lou\u2019s.\u201dSoo-Jung put her shirt back on and added, \u201cI believe you awakened the evil eye because of your special abilities. When I took you in as my pupil, I didn\u2019t expect that; I just saw something special in you.\u201dShe slowly approached him and caressed his fingers; Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t refuse her touch. She stroked Lou and El on his fingers and caressed Brunheart on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the only man who can fulfill my wish.\u201dHis voice a little calmer now, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAnd what\u2019s your wish?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d Soo-Jung\u2019s eyes widened as if she was disappointed in him. She reminded him, \u201cI told you I was wrongly framed as Lucifer.\u201dTurning away from him, she added, \u201cMy wish is to kill the real Lucifer.\u201d***Since Soo-Jung was very tired toward the end of their conversation, she asked Gi-Gyu to leave so she could rest. After discussing it with his family, it was decided that Soo-Jung could stay in their house for a while.Gi-Gyu was also tired after the serious discussion, but he headed toward the association because he had much to do.\u2018Lucifer\u2026 The evil eye\u2026\u2019Gi-Gyu already felt burdened by all the secrets he knew, but there were still plenty more he had to unveil. Until now, Gi-Gyu believed all the demons were his enemy; after meeting Soo-Jung and Baal, it seemed not all demons were foes.\u2018Are there demons that side with humans?\u2019Tae-Shik asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cThat woman Lucifer didn\u2019t do something to you, did she?\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head and answered, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. But is it true? Did the Iron Guild really take its hand off its Korean branch? Despite the multiple casualties on their side, they just accepted it?\u201dEarlier, Tae-Shik explained to Gi-Gyu what happened after the Yeoksam incident. The association\u2019s official statement: Iron Guild lost all its Korean branch members to a sudden gate break. However, many had a hard time believing this story despite heavy hitters like the Cain, Morningstar, and Child guilds acting as witnesses.The U.S. public was also in an uproar. To them, the Iron Guild branch was equivalent to the U.S. military. They were furious that their entire branch was massacred on foreign soil.Shockingly, all this skepticism and fury was kept under control, thanks to two people.\u2018Lee Sun-Ho and Ironshield.\u2019The association released that Lee Sun-Ho himself was dispatched to help with the Yeoksam gate break. Lee Sun-Ho also publicly attested that the gate monsters annihilated the entire Iron Guild branch, shocking the world as a whole.Lee Sun-Ho was the greatest player on earth, so most believed him. As for those who didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t dare to raise questions.Then, there was Ironshield. He didn\u2019t question the association\u2019s explanation and publicly mourned the dead players. Since even the guild master reacted this way, how could the public not accept the \u201ctruth?\u201dIn the end, the Iron Guild players dispatched to Korea were honored as heroes. They were praised as brave souls who died to protect Korea. Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the irony. Before, the Iron Guild being seen as heroes could have ticked him; now, he just didn\u2019t care.\u2018Because I\u2019m going to destroy it in the end anyway.\u2019What frustrated Gi-Gyu was Ironshield\u2019s calm. He had hoped that Ironshield would become furious and come to Korea; thus, he would\u2019ve lured Ironshield into his territory. Then, he would\u2019ve defeated the guild master with help from his friends and allies. Since this tactic worked on Rogers Han, why wouldn\u2019t it work on Ironshield too? Sadly, Ironshield didn\u2019t fall into his trap.Tae-Shik said unhappily, \u201cThis means the Korean branch was just a pawn to Ironshield. There must be more to his plan.\u201d Raising his hands to hold Gi-Gyu\u2019s shoulders, Tae-Shik added, \u201cBut at least thanks to his indifference, the association didn\u2019t have to do much to clean up this mess.\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s hands felt unusually heavy today. When Gi-Gyu looked up at him, Tae-Shik murmured encouragingly, \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to worry about anything. Just find out as much as possible from Lucifer.\u201dTae-Shik\u2019s eyes shined with determination and trust as he added, \u201cYou must get as many secrets as possible from her.\u201dFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84. The Reunion with Lucifer (4)After meeting with Tae-Shik, Gi-Gyu felt much more at ease, knowing that the Yeoksam situation was well under control. Since Gi-Gyu knew Lucifer shared his vision, he didn\u2019t discuss much sensitive information. Still, his head was filled with thoughts from this meeting on his way home.Oddly enough, Tae-Shik seemed almost too confident that Lucifer wouldn\u2019t harm Gi-Gyu\u2019s family. Tae-Shik said during their meeting, \u201cShe won\u2019t touch Su-Jin or Yoo-Jung.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu asked why he believed this, Tae-Shik explained, \u201cBecause Lucifer has rarely ever harmed a civilian. The only civilians she punished really deserved to be disciplined.\u201dSince Tae-Shik was busy enough without Gi-Gyu bothering him, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t ask for details despite wanting to.\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced as he entered. Right now, his fatigue was at an all-time high because he hadn\u2019t had proper rest in a while.\u201cThere you are, Gi-Gyu!\u201d his mother greeted brightly. After a quick hug, he walked into the living room. He was going to go straight to his room, but the scene in the living room made him pause.\u201cWhat\u2019s up!\u201d The infamous and dangerous Lucifer was sitting on his living room sofa and eating a bowl of\u00a0bibimbap[1].\u00a0She was wearing a pair of very short shorts and a shirt, which looked like they belonged to Yoo-Jung.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The resemblance between Soo-Jung and his little sister, Yoo-Jung, was almost disturbing. After seeing her looking so comfortable and casual, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little.\u201cI\u2019m eating dinner, of course. Your mom is an amazing cook!\u201d\u201cHaha, I just mixed a few things to make that bibimbap, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s nothing fancy,\u201d replied Su-Jin with a pleased blush. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know how to react. Should he be impressed at how quickly Soo-Jung adjusted to her new surroundings? Or should he be thankful that Soo-Jung made his mother feel good? Uncertain of what to do, he just went inside his room.\u2018When did she become this close to my family?\u2019Knock, knock.A sudden knock brought him out of his reverie; he heard Soo-Jung\u2019s excited murmurs from outside the door. \u201cCome to the basement after changing. We\u2019ve got work to do\u2026!\u201dThere was something strange about her voice. Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t respond and continued to change his clothes when he noticed the full body mirror beside him.\u2018Is she using the evil eye to see me?\u2019Hesitantly, he asked, \u201cC-can you see?\u201dImmediately, he heard her reply. \u201cYup. Nice body, dude.\u201d\u2018Damn it! I really gotta do something about this shared vision thing!\u2019***\u201cI want you to get rid of our shared vision,\u201d Gi-Gyu demanded firmly. Before he found out Soo-Jung could see everything, this wasn\u2019t a problem. But now\u2026 Ignorance really was bliss.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Soo-Jung seemed very surprised by his request. She asked, \u201cDo you really think I can do something about that?\u201d She spoke as if her hands were tied, but her playful tone made Gi-Gyu suspect otherwise.\u201cTsk, you\u2019re no fun.\u201d Soo-Jung clicked her tongue when Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t react. \u201cAhh\u2026 Since I wanted to know what was going on with you without contacting you, accessing your vision was the only option I had.\u201dIf something sounds and feels like an excuse, it\u2019s an excuse. Shaking his head, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI\u2019m not blaming you. I just want it gone now.\u201dSoo-Jung asked slowly, \u201cUmm, are you sure you\u2019ll be okay with that?\u201d\u201cHmm? What do you mean?\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand what she was asking. Was she worried he would miss sharing his sight with her? Why would he?Soo-Jung explained with dripping seduction, \u201cGiving you my energy and taking it out from you are two very different things. On top of that, you developed the evil eye from what I gave you. So to extract my energy from you, I must\u2026\u201dShe seductively walked toward him, while Gi-Gyu just stared at her. Her charm didn\u2019t bedazzle him\u2014he just felt uneasy due to her tone.Gi-Gyu was sitting on a chair when Soo-Jung leaned toward him.Ba-dum, ba-dum\u2026His heart pounded wildly; he murmured, \u201cW-what are you\u2026?!\u201dSmooch~It was a simple kiss, but Gi-Gyu\u2019s face turned bright red.Fwooosh~Suddenly, he felt something, some sort of energy, leaving his right eye through his mouth. It was out of his control, and it entered Soo-Jung\u2019s mouth. After some time, she took a step back and whispered, \u201cThat was pretty good, huh?\u201dGi-Gyu thought, \u2018If she were a man, I would\u2019ve beaten him up.\u2019\u2018Couldn\u2019t she have warned me?!\u2019\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t look like you hated it either.\u201d When Soo-Jung said that, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but cough awkwardly. He didn\u2019t say anything; now, it was her turn to feel uncomfortable. Suddenly realizing why he was silent, Soo-Jung stammered, \u201cT-that wasn\u2019t your first kiss, ri-right?\u201d\u201c...\u201dSoo-Jung was shocked, and a short silence fell before she herself broke it. \u201cReally? First kiss\u2026. With that face? Huh, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cJust stop already. We don\u2019t share my sight anymore, right?\u201d\u201cYou got it. Soon, your eye color will return to normal. You won\u2019t lose your evil eye; it\u2019ll just revert to its dormant form.\"Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t use his evil eye effectively even with Lucifer\u2019s energy, so he wasn\u2019t actually losing anything. Consequently, he was glad his eyes would now not attract attention due to their unusual color.In an almost inaudible whisper, Soo-Jung murmured, \u201cBut you can someday awaken it on your own.\u201dSlowly, her face turned rigid and serious. She no longer looked playful; instead, she looked determined yet seductive: It was Lucifer\u2019s true face.Soo-Jung announced, \u201cNow, it\u2019s time to start your lessons.\u201d***All high demons were experts in the black magic, and Baal, being one, was able to strengthen the basement barrier further.\u00a0With the barrier and spells, including the space expansion and intensity control magic, Gi-Gyu\u2019s basement now looked similar to the association\u2019s basement training hall.Soo-Jung stood in the middle of the basement as she explained, \u201cI warned Ironshield before to steer clear of Korea because it\u2019s where you live. I have also punished him for daring to harm me.\u201dAfter a short pause, she continued, \u201cSo Ironshield planned a sneaky trap. Ignoring my warning, he used the Korean branch as an excuse to send Rogers Han and his players here, probably expecting me to retaliate. And to prevent that retaliation, he used Lee Sun-Ho.\u201dGi-Gyu asked, \u201cBut you gave Lee Sun-Ho the elixir. Doesn't that mean you\u2019re free of Lee Sun-Ho now? What\u2019s stopping you from going to the U.S. and killing Ironshield?\u201dGi-Gyu wanted to kill Ironshield himself, but he was still curious about what was stopping Lucifer from doing it. With a lopsided grin, Soo-Jung explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that. Lee Sun-Ho and I are archenemies, so we can\u2019t exist together. I haven\u2019t been in Korea much, even though it\u2019s my home because it\u2019s Lee Sun-Ho\u2019s territory. For a reason I can\u2019t disclose, I have been staying hidden. It\u2019s also why I didn\u2019t contact you until now. And have you ever wondered what\u2019ll happen if your identity as my heir and disciple becomes public? You will be in grave danger.\u201dLucifer and Lee Sun-Ho being archenemies was news to Gi-Gyu. Walking in a circle around Gi-Gyu slowly, Soo-Jung continued, \u201cWell, because of Ironshield, Lee Sun-Ho figured out our situation. I had no choice but to make this deal with him, but the deal only included one-year protection for you, not me.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re okay here because of the barriers, but we can\u2019t hide from Lee Sun-Ho anywhere else in Korea. If I try to leave Korea or try something funny, Lee Sun-Ho will come after me with an elixir-fueled, much-improved body. And this is exactly what Ironshield wants.\u201d With an irritated frown, Soo-Jung added, \u201cIronshield is trying to keep me from moving since I\u2019m exposed here. Even as we speak, I\u2019m sure he's preparing for our next fight.\u201dGi-Gyu quietly stored all of this information in his head. With a laugh, Soo-Jung shrugged and said, \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m easy prey for Lee Sun-Ho. He may be powerful, but he won\u2019t come out unscathed if he ends up fighting me.\u201dSoo-Jung finally stopped circling Gi-Gyu. She continued, looking at him, \u201cThat is why you must become strong. You\u2019ve to become someone even Lee Sun-Ho is wary of. You\u2019ve to become strong enough to make him think twice before making a move against me.\u201dHer dainty lips closed quietly. After a moment of silence, she said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t become as strong as Ironshield in a year\u201d\u2014with a teasing look, she ran her thumb across her neck\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re growing at an explosive speed. Even faster than Lee Sun-Ho. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s monitoring you with interest already. It was another reason I had no choice but to make an appearance.\u201dSoo-Jung smiled at Gi-Gyu\u2019s dazed look and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit complicated, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cQuite so.\u201d Gi-Gyu scratched his cheek, giving up on understanding the situation. \u201cIn simple words, I need to get strong, right? I don\u2019t think there is any reason to think too hard about it. It sounds pretty simple: Become powerful.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201d Soo-Jung laughed loudly and announced, \u201cI gotta admit that I picked the right man to be my pupil.\u201dSuddenly, a black flame appeared in her hand, while Lou and El materialized in Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands.***\u201cThere isn't much I can do to help you grow,\u201d Soo-Jung stated.Clang!Soo-Jung added, \u201cIf you had passed the 50th-floor test and gone through the secondary job change, things would\u2019ve been different. But for now, this is all I can do. Got it?\u201dLucifer\u2019s black flame crashed into Lou\u2019s purple smoke, creating a loud explosion. Despite the booming sounds, Gi-Gyu could hear Soo-Jung\u2019s instructions clearly.Soo-Jung continued, \u201cAfter clearing the 50th-floor test, a player gains new skill and strength that\u2019s truly out of this world. Honestly, defeating all those Iron Guild members without going through secondary job change is an incredible feat. I\u2019m so proud to have you as my pupil.\u201dSoo-Jung looked playful, but she never stopped attacking Gi-Gyu. Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu was having a hard time just blocking her sword, not to mention actively attacking her.She murmured, \u201cAn ordinary player would be satisfied with where you are, but you are a unique ability holder. When unique ability holder goes through a secondary job chang\u2014\u201dCrackkk!Soo-Jung\u2019s black flaming sword struck Lou as if it wanted to gnaw at it. Surrounded by purple smoke, Lou fought back with determination.\u201cNot only does it strengthen a player\u2019s attributes, but also their unique ability. In some special cases, it\u2019s even possible to gain another unique ability.\u201d Soo-Jung smiled and took a step back, her black flame sword glowing dangerously.Impressed by Gi-Gyu\u2019s defense, Soo-Jung complimented him. \u201cWow! No wonder you\u2019re my pupil! I can see your great potential. Or maybe this is Lou\u2019s power? After all, he is the original.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu huffed, covered in sweat, failing to make a sound through all that heaving. Suddenly, Soo-Jung opened her other empty hand and another black flame sword appeared in it. She smiled and dashed forward. \u201cThe only thing I can do for you now is to give you some good sparring matches and advice.\u201dThen, with a nod, she made black flames erupt all around Gi-Gyu with a nod. With a fearful flinch, Gi-Gyu rolled away from them. Her grin becoming wider, Soo-Jung announced, \u201cSo do your best to survive my lessons and not die. If you do, you\u2019ll definitely become stronger.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s hellish training was just about to begin.1. Bibimbap is a Korean rice dish topped with sauteed vegetables, gochujang, and a choice of protein.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85. The Reunion with Lucifer (5)While Gi-Gyu was busy training with Lucifer, the outside world was abuzz with the Yeoksam incident. The netizens were having a field day with the news. Then again, how could they not? An entire guild branch was demolished.-We must thank the Iron Guild for its sacrifice!-The entire branch of 300 members died on foreign soil. Shouldn\u2019t the Korean government provide adequate compensation to the Iron Guild?-The U.S. is the best.-Am I the only one who finds this strange? Every player from the Iron Guild died, yet the Morningstar guild, which I\u2019ve never even heard of, only suffered minor fatalities? Does this make sense?-But didn\u2019t an article say the Iron Guild members sacrificed themselves to minimize fatalities of the other smaller guilds?-I still find it weird.-Whatever. Go to r/conspiracy, for fuck\u2019s sake.The media was already following the mainstream story, so KPA only tried to manage the chatter, not control it. Those who went around asking questions only received silence, so they eventually disappeared. In the end, the biggest and the most publicized emotion was gratitude toward the Iron Guild.KPA wasn\u2019t pleased with the appreciation the Iron Guild was getting, but since the Yeoksam incident was dying down, they didn\u2019t bother correcting anyone.-Wow, but it\u2019s tough to believe that we had a gate break bad enough to annihilate the entire Iron Guild branch\u2026 So scary.-What if it didn\u2019t happen in Yeoksam but somewhere more defenseless.-That\u2019s a frightening thought.The newest topic everyone was discussing was the gate break\u2019s level and what could\u2019ve happened had it not been controlled. The public\u2019s fear increased slightly, but all in all, the situation remained relatively calm in Korea.As promised, the Cain Guild got the role and the rights the Iron Guild branch was supposed to take. The Morningstar and the Child guilds also received great benefits, and their reputations improved significantly.Time passed by; thankfully, Gi-Gyu\u2019s name wasn\u2019t mentioned once. The public never figured out Lucifer\u2019s role in this event or that the gate break was man-made.***Currently, Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung were inside one of the cafes in Gangnam city. \u00a0The cafe was pretty empty and quiet, but large crowds could be seen outside. Today was the day the nation decided to carry out a condolence parade for the players who sacrificed themselves during the Yeoksam gate break. The dead players of the Iron, Morningstar, and Child guilds were to be remembered for their bravery. Sitting inside the cafe, Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung watched the people following the parade.A waitress walked up to their table and announced, \u201cTwo Americanos and complimentary pretzels. Our boss feels bad he couldn\u2019t participate in the parade, so he\u2019s giving out these to show his support for the brave players.\u201dThe waitress smiled and walked away, peeking at Gi-Gyu and Soo-Jung with interest and awe at times.Soo-Jung asked Gi-Gyu playfully, \u201cNow I get it. You caused that gate break to get free pretzels, didn\u2019t you? Haha.\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head and replied, \u201cHaa\u2026 I told you we shouldn\u2019t come here today. It\u2019s so crowded and noisy. Why did you insist on coming here?\u201d\u201cBecause I wanted to get some fresh air! What\u2019s wrong with that?!\u201dThey have been training hard lately, so this was the first time they left Gi-Gyu\u2019s home in a long while. After spending so much time together training, they had naturally gotten closer. However, the more Gi-Gyu learned about Lucifer, the more fear he felt toward her.\u2018I just can\u2019t even tell how strong she really is,\u2019\u00a0he thought, confused.After so many sparring sessions, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t become dramatically stronger because there was no change in his level or stats: All he gained was experience. Gi-Gyu learned a lot from the floors and gates he cleared, but learning from an expert was a different ball game. Now, he knew how to use everything, including his swords, effectively.\u2018But even so, I can\u2019t even imagine going against her and having even the tiniest chance to win,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought with a shiver. Soo-Jung maintained a playful attitude during their spars, scaring him even more. However, that one time he managed to surprise her did wonders for his confidence.Gi-Gyu was deep in his thoughts when Soo-Jung asked, \u201cCan I keep staying in your house for a while longer?\u201d\u201cAs long as my family is okay with it.\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s simple reply drew a smile from Soo-Jung. Actually, he had his selfish reasons for wanting Lucifer to stay.\u2018As long as Soo-Jung is there, no one will dare to attack my family.\u2019This thought was further steeled by the unexpected incident not too long ago. Some assassin players attacked his family. Being decently skilled, they broke through the first layer of barriers around his home. However, Soo-Jung killed them the moment they stepped inside. The bodies were sent to the association for an investigation.It turned out that Rogers had hired some assassins to kill Gi-Gyu\u2019s family. They were instructed to move if Rogers didn\u2019t contact them within a certain amount of time. Once the association announced Rogers Han's death, the assassins decided to honor the deal since they were already paid.\u2018If Soo-Jung or I hadn\u2019t been home that day\u2026\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t even want to think about that. The association promised to protect his family to the best of its abilities, but clearly, that wasn\u2019t enough. After all, the assassins did cross the first line of their implemented security system. Also, since Soo-Jung was staying with them, no association agents were around his home for protection. All in all, Gi-Gyu was reminded that he could never let his guard down, even with Lucifer here.Thankfully, everything worked out. Thinking about the imprisoned Rogers inside his gate gave Gi-Gyu much relief. Now, he could relive his anger on the one responsible for this assassination attempt.Munching on the free pretzels, Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cBy the way\u201d\u2014he swallowed them\u2014\u201care you sure the evil eye can\u2019t affect my emotions or personality?\u201dGi-Gyu asked very gingerly, but Soo-Jung still got annoyed. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you?! The evil eye has nothing to do with its holder\u2019s personality! The change in your personality is because your true nature is returning. Once you accepted the power of the evil eye, your suppressed emotions and personality just burst out.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe I have such a cruel nature.\u201d Gi-Gyu slumped sadly.\u201cIt\u2019s actually incredible that you could suppress it all this time. No one can hide or suppress their true nature. Obviously, someone sealed away you\u2014\u201d Soo-Jung abruptly stopped talking because she could feel a powerful player walking toward them. Gi-Gyu also noticed this, so he looked around until he spotted a familiar face.\u201cOppa!\u201d A female player waved and greeted. She approached them and announced, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you! You\u2019ve been ignoring my texts.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019ve been really busy. Sorry,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu awkwardly.The female player seemed depressed as she stood at the table. Slowly, she turned and studied Soo-Jung with an odd expression. Soo-Jung was currently hiding her power, so even someone experienced like Tae-Shik would fail to tell if Soo-Jung was a player.The female player murmured, \u201cAnd this must be your girlfriend\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, this is\u2014\u201d Soo-Jung suddenly interrupted Gi-Gyu by covering his mouth and continued the introductions, \u201cHahaha, I am. And who are you?\u201dGi-Gyu quickly pushed Soo-Jung\u2019s hand away and yelled, \u201cWhat are you talking about? She is just a friend, Yoo-Bin!\u201d\u201cAh! A friend! Okay. I\u2019m Shin Yoo-Bin. Nice to meet you,\u201d Yoo-Bin greeted politely and offered her hand. Soo-Jung shook it, and to Gi-Gyu\u2019s confusion, a subtle tension arose between the two women.\u2018Huh?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu looked at them curiously, but the tension quickly disappeared. He assumed he was mistaken and asked Yoo-Bin, \u201cSo what brings you here?\u201d\u201cMy guild is in charge of the parade security. It\u2019s a momentous event, so I\u2019m trying my best to do a good job. All those poor players\u2026 We must honor them,\u201d explained Yoo-Bin confidently. Since it was a long parade, and many players participated, the police alone couldn\u2019t control the crowd. So, the association and the Gypsophila Guild were responsible for security.Feeling awkward, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s momentous, I guess.\u201d Missing the uncomfortable expression, Yoo-Bin continued, \u201cI know there were some unpleasant rumors about the Iron Guild, but after what happened\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all bad. We must thank them for their sacrifice. I just remembered this: I heard the Cain, Morningstar, and Child guilds also participated.\u201dGi-Gyu quickly realized what Yoo-Bin had just remembered, so he promptly changed the subject. \u201cHuh? Yoo-Bin! I-I think someone\u2019s looking for you outside.\u201d\u201cOh! Okay. Then I\u2019ll see you later, Oppa! Please don\u2019t ignore my texts again!\u201d \u00a0Turning around, Yoo-Bin quickly left the cafe.Watching Gi-Gyu with interest, Soo-Jung smirked. Gi-Gyu shook his head, took a sip of his coffee, and murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d***The sky was dark, and an ominous atmosphere filled the air. Skeletons sauntered around everywhere, and dead trees grew tall.In the middle of this gruesome scene, a man worked without rest.Fwip!A skeleton soldier mercilessly whipped the man\u2019s back.\u201cUgh.\u201d The man groaned, but he didn\u2019t say a word since it was impossible to have a conversation with the skeleton. The man was pulling a wagon filled with giant rocks; he was in the process of making a pyramid.Skinny body, clothes that looked like rags, and unfocused eyes, this man was none other than\u2026\u201cRogers Han.\u201d A gloomy and cold voice called out the name. A mysterious smoke appeared, slowly turning into Hart, the gate manager and Gi-Gyu\u2019s faithful servant.Rogers asked, \u201cW-what?\u201d\u201cFood,\u201d Hart announced and threw something on the ground. It was a moldy piece of bread; Rogers ran toward it as soon as he saw it. He didn\u2019t care about the mold\u2014he just stuffed it into his mouth.Hart announced, \u201cThe grandmaster promised he would let you go if you finish the pyramid.\u201dThe words brightened Rogers\u2019 world. Since there was no light around, only skeletons, Rogers had no idea how many days he had spent in this nightmare. The skeletons forced Rogers Han to work without rest, only feeding him stamina and strength potions and moldy pieces of bread. Rogers wished he could get ill and die, but being a player meant being immune to most illnesses.\u201cT-thank you,\u201d Rogers murmured as he cried.\u201cTsk.\u201d Hart clicked his tongue and looked at Rogers.\u2018There is no way Grandmaster will let this player go,\u2019\u00a0Hart thought. Gi-Gyu had ordered Rogers Han to build a pyramid; there was no special meaning behind it. Gi-Gyu believed constructing mysterious structures like the pyramids had to be one of the worst forms of torture.Rogers Han was in such dire straits that even Hart felt sorry for him. However, Hart shook his head and muttered, \u201cNo! I can\u2019t feel this way. This man tried to harm the grandmaster\u2019s family.\u201d Turning toward the skeleton nearby, Hart ordered, \u201cWhip him harder!\u201dRattle.The skeleton nodded.After Hart disappeared, Rogers murmured, \u201cIronshield\u2026 that bastard\u2026\u201d After Gi-Gyu told him that Nine had taken all his stats, he realized Ironshield used him.Rogers no longer felt angry toward Gi-Gyu. He now only had hatred for Ironshield.Rattle.Fwip!\u201cUgh...\u201d The skeleton whipped Roger\u2019s back, who remained standing in a fury.***After returning home, Gi-Gyu looked around.\u201cWoof!\u201d Bi, who was sleeping in the yard, barked as it ran toward him. It licked Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands, and they played for a little while before Gi-Gyu headed toward the basement.The basement looked very different now. It looked bigger than the rest of the house. Baal raised his glasses and greeted, \u201cWelcome back.\u201d\u201cHello. How\u2019s everything going?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he walked to Baal.\u201cThings are going very well. The magic circle will be completed soon.\u201d When Baal replied, Gi-Gyu sighed in relief. \u201cI am so glad to hear that.\u201dNaturally, Baal had been staying in the basement with Soo-Jung. Walking on top of the magic circle Baal engraved, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cOpen!\u201dThen, the blue gate appeared from Gi-Gyu\u2019s chest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86. The Reunion with Lucifer (6)The second the blue gate appeared, the magic circle began glowing, emitting red and blue rays toward the gate. Gi-Gyu took a step back toward Baal, who murmured, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBaal studied the magic circle carefully, while Gi-Gyu looked at it anxiously. They had experimented many times before, but they hadn\u2019t seen any positive results yet.Fwoosh!The gate began vibrating ever so slightly, and no skeletons jumped out like before.Baal announced in an excited voice, \u201cOh! It\u2019s a success!\u201dGradually, the light from the gate began gathering in one place and gave birth to something shiny.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cWow... We really just created a crystal.\u201dThe blue crystal forming on the magic circle\u2019s edge even had Baal invested. When had anyone ever seen the stoic Baal look so relieved and interested?-I have to admit that Baal always had talent in the field of black magic. That jerk is one of my minions who learned my wisdom correctly.Lou didn\u2019t sound very happy as he explained, but Gi-Gyu could tell that Lou acknowledged Baal\u2019s talent.Fwoosh!The gate vibrated again, and the glow disappeared from the magic circle. Now, there sat a single blue crystal over the magic circle. After Gi-Gyu studied it for a few seconds, he announced, \u201cThis is real.\u201d The crystal was like all the others he got from the gates and the Tower floors, so he could sell it easily.Baal raised his glasses again and replied, \u201cGrandmaster, your gate is too inefficient. You feed it all those crystals, but it isn\u2019t efficiently utilizing the crystals\u2019 energy. But now, you can collect this surplus crystal energy and create new crystals.\u201dLike a mad scientist, Baal continued with excitement, \u201cSoon, you\u2019ll be able to produce crystals from the surplus energy without using any magic. This magic circle will be a stable source of income for you.\u201d\u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied with a nod. While staying with Lucifer and Baal, Gi-Gyu gained more than just special training and protection for his family. Lou had lost his memory and only knew the bare bones of black magic, but Baal was an encyclopedia.Brunheart\u2019s gate had to eat crystals to become stronger; it was a necessary evil. Consequently, Gi-Gyu had to spend much time taking on mercenary jobs to make money for this gate. He could take more jobs in the future, but he also had other things like exacting revenge, killing a few fools, etc.However, Gi-Gyu now had a passive income stream, thanks to Baal. He could now use the surplus crystal energy to create more crystals. The magic circle could only make mid-grade blue crystals for now, but going beyond that was always a definite possibility.Picking up the crystal, Gi-Gyu nodded and said to Baal, \u201cPlease continue to take good care of me.\u201dBaal nodded, returning to his stoic nature. Gi-Gyu was now certain he would never understand this Lucifer-Baal duo. \u201cBut please remember that black magic has many fields, and what I can do is limited.\u201d\u201cOf course. Anyway\u2026\u201d Closing the gate, Gi-Gyu continued cautiously, \u201cHow is \u2018that\u2019 going?\u201dThe excitement returned to Baal\u2019s face as he answered, \u201cNo progress yet, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to find a solution very soon. I am excited to be allowed to try all these various things. You\u2019re exceptional, Grandmaster.\u201dSince Gi-Gyu owned Lou and El, masters of all the holy and evil swords, Gi-Gyu could do things no other being would ever dare try. Currently, he had Baal working on something that could help him greatly. After hearing Baal\u2019s reply, Gi-Gyu\u2019s expectations peaked since his dream was within reach.Baal cleaned up the magic circle. This project was still experimental, so he needed to improve it further. Watching Baal, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say the gates are territories?\u201dIn between training sessions, Gi-Gyu chatted with Baal, who told him a few secrets. Recently, Baal informed Gi-Gyu that the gates were \u201csomeone\u2019s\u201d territories.Baal answered, \u201cYes. The gates are abandoned lands.\u201d\u201cAnd these \u2018someones\u2019 are demons?\u201d Gi-Gyu had asked this question before, but Baal didn\u2019t give him a straight answer at the time. Since Baal felt pretty good because of the magic circle\u2019s success, Gi-Gyu decided to strike the hot iron.\u201cIt could\u2019ve belonged to a demon, but not necessarily,\u201d Baal replied dryly.\u2018Yes! Success!\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu clenched his fists secretly in excitement. He remained quiet and looked at Baal encouragingly. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s delight, the demon continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not like only demons can possess lands.\u201d\u201cThen why would anyone abandon their land?\u201d Gi-Gyu wondered why someone would give up their possession.\u201cThe lands\u2026\u201d Baal trailed off before continuing after a short pause. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t by choice. They just abandoned it. I\u2019m sure there are some that still have owners.\u201dBaal finally finished closing the magic circle. Gi-Gyu asked a few more questions, but Baal didn\u2019t give him any more answers. When Gi-Gyu begged, Baal promised, \u201cWhen you cross the 50th floor and become worthy, I will tell you.\u201dBaal may have called Gi-Gyu \u201cgrandmaster,\u201d but he didn\u2019t serve Gi-Gyu. It was out of respect, nothing more. In the end, Gi-Gyu could only lick his lips in disappointment.***The training resumed. The sparring match now became part of Gi-Gyu\u2019s daily routine. According to Soo-Jung, Gi-Gyu would use his attributes much more efficiently after their training was over. Gi-Gyu had to admit that he could feel significant improvement already.[The assimilation level is increasing.][Assimilation (A):\u00a0You can now use 70% of your Ego\u2019s abilities.]With the system announcement, Gi-Gyu felt something incredible coursing through his body. He could feel an unfamiliar and powerful sensation enveloping him. This sudden change was different from when his Egos leveled up. Along with it, Lou\u2019s violet aura darkened further, so Gi-Gyu raised Lou in confusion.\u201cUwaah!\u201d Soo-Jung exclaimed as she slammed her sword against Lou. The dark flame hit Lou, but nothing happened. No sounds, no sparks, no nothing.\u201c...\u201d Gi-Gyu became quiet, and silence filled the basement.Her face filled with awe and surprise, Soo-Jung took a slow step back and murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing\u2026\u201d. She looked at Lou as if he was the most beautiful jewel.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening\u2026?\u201d Finally remembering to speak, Gi-Gyu asked Lou.-It\u2019s Death. Since our assimilation level increased, your ability to control Death must\u2019ve also increased.Lou explained with his usual bothersome, rude, and arrogant tone. However, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t care less, since the sudden feeling of fullness and satisfaction was euphoric. Gi-Gyu had never done drugs before, but he wondered if this was what it felt like.Soo-Jung suddenly shouted, \u201cSnap out of it!\u201d Her voice rang in the basement, but all Gi-Gyu did was slowly look up. He couldn\u2019t see it himself, but his change was obvious to Soo-Jung.Once Lucifer had taken away her energy, Gi-Gyu\u2019s right eye regained its normal color. However, now his eyes\u2014both of his eyes\u2014were glowing a faint violet.\u201cTsk!\u201d Soo-Jung clicked her tongue in frustration. Despite her shouts, Gi-Gyu remained dazed, so she promptly stormed toward him. Soo-Jung hadn\u2019t gone full-speed during their spars, but she was now using a part of her true strength.Clank!A clear metallic sound echoed in the basement. Her black flame sword transformed into its true form.Pshhh...Unexpectedly, the black flame didn\u2019t have much effect on Gi-Gyu. Suddenly, she threw her sword aside, grabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s neck, and slammed him to the floor. She didn\u2019t stop there. She got on top of him and punched his face.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned, finally regaining his consciousness.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Soo-Jung sighed in relief as she warned, \u201cDo not let the darkness take control. Keep today\u2019s incident as a reminder of what black magic can do to you.\u201d She rubbed her hands and stood up.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cBut it felt so\u2014\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Soo-Jung cut him off, clearly knowing what he would say. \u201cThe satisfaction is something very hard to resist.\u201d Looking at him with a bitter expression, she continued, \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re a superior being. Like the human species is beneath you. That feeling is the reason why demons act the way they do.\u201dThat was precisely what he had felt just now; Gi-Gyu nodded emphatically. \u00a0The euphoric sensation made him feel like he was floating. It had made him lose his human side; it was a never-felt-before sensation.Wait, he had actually felt something similar before. When he had first awakened his evil eye, which had surprised even Soo-Jung, and then when he had overused Death. Yes, it was an unfamiliarly familiar feeling.Soo-Jung murmured, \u201cYou must find the player with the hundred swords in the future.\u201d\u201cIs that player connected to Ironshield?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dCurious about Ironshield and his holy swords, Gi-Gyu had previously asked Soo-Jung and Baal about him. At the time, Soo-Jung explained, \u201cIronshield was lucky enough to meet the player with the hundred swords. This player isn\u2019t registered, but he has to be a high ranker. And most of his swords\u2026 have special skills.\u201dIronshield helped this player in the past, which was how he received several of his powerful holy swords.While Gi-Gyu maintained silence, Soo-Jung advised him, \u201cYour black magic is getting stronger, so you\u2019ll go through some changes. Since that can\u2019t be helped, just make sure you maintain a good balance.\u201dWith a sigh, she continued, \u201cYou\u2019re on your way to becoming a unique player. You\u2019re on the border of good and evil. You\u2019ve to remain in the middle, so make sure you don't neglect your holy sword, El.\u201dAfter defeating Rogers, Gi-Gyu had found a way for El to absorb Nine. But in the end, he decided to save this new sword for later use. Consequently, Gi-Gyu had to find another holy sword for her to absorb and become stronger.\u201cHaaaaah...\u201d Soo-Jung yawned as she stretched. Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t sure what tired her. Was it the tension leaving her body, or was she just bored with training him? Before leaving the basement, she said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cWe better finish up our training soon so that you can return to the Tower.\u201dAfter she left, only Gi-Gyu and Baal remained in the basement. Baal was busy doing his experiment, so Gi-Gyu looked around awkwardly.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu felt both tired and relieved at the same time. He was deep in his thoughts when his phone suddenly rang.R-r-r-ring.He took out his phone to check the caller ID.\u201cOld Man Hwang?\u201d The elderly man had never called Gi-Gyu before, so he became curious.\u201cHello?\u201d answered Gi-Gyu.-R-right\u2026 n\u2026now c-come to my workshop\u2026 Please\u2026Beep.The call was abruptly disconnected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87. Old Man HwangThe second the call got disconnected, Gi-Gyu was out of the door. For all rankers and higher, running was faster than driving. It wasn\u2019t because they were faster or could maintain their speed for longer\u2014it was because they could ignore traffic laws.Of course, random players sprinting to their destinations could frighten non-players. Hence, players had to ask for the association\u2019s permission unless it was an emergency.Gi-Gyu called the association earlier, so several association agents arrived before long. One of the agents asked, \u201cAre you the player who called?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a ranker.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, one of the players quickly rushed toward him and confirmed, \u201cYou must be Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201dThings like this occurred rather frequently, so the KPA trained a bunch of agents for this. It had them memorize the faces of all Korean rankers and would deploy them whenever someone made a request.When one of the agents recognized him, Gi-Gyu raised his fist. The association agents flinched, thinking Gi-Gyu was about to attack them. Their hands instinctively moved toward their weapons; thankfully, one agent recognized Gi-Gyu\u2019s ring.This agent asked, \u201cYou\u2019re a mercenary\u2026 Where is your destination, Sir?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Dongdaemun,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu.\u201cAll right. Everything is ready so that no one will stop you on the way.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThanks to the agent, who quickly recognized Gi-Gyu as a mercenary, things went smoothly and rapidly. Gi-Gyu was about to rush out when the agent added, \u201cNext time, please contact your assigned association agent to avoid this annoying step.\u201dAfter nodding, Gi-Gyu rushed toward his destination. Calling the association was a rash move; it would\u2019ve been easier and quicker had he called his agent, Sung-Hoon.Whoosh!After activating Accelerate, Gi-Gyu moved like the wind. His current speed was well beyond what any average player could dream of.\u2018Old Man Hwang isn\u2019t the kind of man I can choose not to help.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t that close to the elderly man, yet his safety was a priority. After all, the old man was one of the few who could improve Gi-Gyu's battle power. If Old Man Hwang died, it would be a huge personal loss.Clack, clack...Hopping on one traffic light after another, Gi-Gyu flew toward his destination.\u2018What happened to Old Man Hwang?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu wondered what could make the old man sound so desperate. Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t sure how strong the elderly man was currently, but there was no doubt he must\u2019ve been a powerful player in his younger days. So what could have happened to such a strong man?Thump!Gi-Gyu jumped to the ground and stood up.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll find out when I see him in person,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. It hadn\u2019t been many minutes since he left his home, but he was already standing in front of the old man\u2019s workshop.***Instead of knocking several times, Gi-Gyu decided to rip the door open to save time. It was an emergency with many variables; now wasn\u2019t the time for polite conduct. Also, he didn\u2019t want to give the culprit a chance to escape if they were still inside.Gi-Gyu approached the door quietly and was about to grab the doorknob when his Egos warned him.-Be careful!-Please be careful, Master!-Masterrr! Watch out!Gi-Gyu quickly backed away from the door.Fwoosh.Suddenly, a metallic spike lattice was ejected from the ground, aiming for the spot Gi-Gyu was on a moment ago. Even though it wouldn\u2019t have killed him, it still could\u2019ve severely injured him. This lattice was quickly followed by numerous arrows shot from the ceiling and the walls. Gi-Gyu took another step back as he enabled his skill. \u201cDeath.\u201dDeath immediately turned the arrows into dust; a dark silence fell in front of the workshop door for a short moment.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered in surprise. The security system Old Man Hwang placed around his place was incredible. The elderly man was clearly preparing for someone\u2019s attack. However, the intact traps that Gi-Gyu activated told him the elderly man wasn\u2019t attacked.-Be careful. There still might be more traps.When Lou warned, Gi-Gyu replied lightly, \u201cAll right.\u201d He took out Lou and aimed him at the door, wondering if he should just destroy it. Since there could be more lethal traps, he let Lou\u2019s violet smoke take care of the door. Within seconds, the door crumbled down into dust, giving Gi-Gyu a view of the inside.\u201cSir!\u201d Gi-Gyu screamed when he saw Old Man Hwang collapsed on the floor.\u201cSir! Please wake up!\u201d Gi-Gyu gently shook the elderly man, but the blacksmith didn\u2019t move. Gi-Gyu quickly pulled out a healing potion and poured it into the old man\u2019s mouth. Since Old Man Hwang was a player, the healing potion had to work on him. To Gi-Gyu\u2019s relief, the elderly man\u2019s pale face slowly improved. The blacksmith slowly opened his eyes and stared at Gi-Gyu. \u201cY-you came\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201d\u201cSir, I\u2019m here. What happened to you?!\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he looked around the workshop. The place was a mess, and the blacksmith\u2019s items were missing as if they had been stolen. What worried Gi-Gyu the most was the elderly man\u2019s state: Someone had struck his head with a blunt object with quite a lot of force; it was bleeding heavily.\u201cSir, your hands\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered in distress, looking at Old Man Hwang\u2019s horribly crushed hands. Gi-Gyu quickly poured a healing potion on them, but it was useless. The elderly man\u2019s life force was too drained for the potion to work; only the elixir could heal him now.\u201cI must get you to the hospital first.\u201d Gi-Gyu thought a hospital could somehow save the elderly man, but he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. There is no need.\u201dOld Man Hwang\u2019s voice was calm, but there was an unmistakable bitterness to it. The blacksmith looked straight into Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes despite the severe pain and said, \u201cI\u2019m dying, Young Man.\u201dLou and El agreed.-He won\u2019t live much longer.-This old man\u2019s life is almost over, Master.Meanwhile, Brunheart asked in surprise.-Master! Who is this old man?!Gi-Gyu gingerly placed Old Man Hwang\u2019s head on his lap. The blacksmith asked, \u201cI don\u2019t have much time left. Will you hear my story?\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t know how to respond. The blacksmith might just live if he disobeyed the old man\u2019s wish and took him to the hospital. However, if Gi-Gyu took him to the hospital and he died there, Old Man Hwang may die without peace.It was time for Gi-Gyu to make a decision. \u201cAll right, Sir.\u201dFinally, Gi-Gyu decided to treat the elderly man like a human rather than a blacksmith who could help him. Besides, even if the older man survived, Gi-Gyu suspected he would hold a grudge against Gi-Gyu for not listening to his story.Old Man Hwang nodded in relief and whispered, \u201cGood, thank you. Now, I need to ask you for that favor we agreed upon.\u201dGi-Gyu remembered the price they decided on for Oberon: He promised he would take one request from the elderly man. Old Man Hwang was now ready to claim his boon.Gi-Gyu made his last attempt to convince the blacksmith. \u201cSir, if you die like this now, you won\u2019t even know if I honored our agreement. So we should get you to the hospital first, and we can talk about your request after.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not doubt that you\u2019ll honor my request.\u201d Old Man Hwang was adamant.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. Now, there was no denying it: Old Man Hwang would die today. So, Gi-Gyu had to hear him out since that was also his dying wish.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat is your request, Sir?\u201d\u201cBefore I tell you that\u2026 Will you hear my story? You need to know this before I can tell you what I need.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu nodded, Old Man Hwang quickly began to talk.***Old Man Hwang began, \u201cI am one of the forerunners.\u201dForerunners were the first humans to get an invitation from the Tower. Since they began hunting foremost, they also became stronger faster. However, being the first also meant they had to explore the many then-unknown territories and lose numerous comrades.Tae-Shik and Tae-Gu were forerunners too. And\u2026\u2018My father was also a forerunner,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. He didn\u2019t remember his father very well, but this was what his mother told him a long time ago. He knew his father died in an accident that also gave his mother a terrible spine injury; apart from that, he assumed his father wasn\u2019t a particularly powerful player.Old Man Hwang continued, \u201cThe other forerunners climbed the Tower and hunted monsters, but I wasn\u2019t interested in becoming stronger.\u201dGi-Gyu began focusing on the elderly man\u2019s story. The blacksmith\u2019s voice suggested that he missed those days as he added, \u201cThat\u2019s why I stopped climbing the Tower. The other players ridiculed and shunned me. They claimed that I was running away from my duties to protect humanity\u2026\u201dIt was a sad story, but there was no regret in Old Man Hwang\u2019s eyes. He continued, \u201cBut I didn't care. I was a blacksmith before I became a player, so I used my new power to create better weapons. But soon, my limits began hindering my progre\u2014Khoff!\u201d\u201cSir!\u201dSuddenly, the blacksmith coughed up some blood. Gi-Gyu hurriedly fed him a great healing potion, which helped the elderly man a little.\u201cI don\u2019t think I have much time left\u2026 But you\u2019ll still hear me out, right? I\u2019ve been unable to tell anyone my story, so I would like to have at least one person who knows what I went through and what I know.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about that and take your time. It\u2019s a fascinating story, so I would love to hear it.\u201d When Gi-Gyu smiled, Old Man Hwang smiled as well. He continued, \u201cI\u2019m actually a tanker, not a blacksmith. So creating weapons had nothing to do with what I was born to do. I could make decent weapons, but nothing special. So, in the end, I became a mediocre player and a subpar blacksmith.\u201dOld Man Hwang grinned as he added, \u201cI was an oddball. When I realized I had reached my limit, I concluded that there had to be a way to get better. So I entered the Tower again. I began climbing to the higher floors to go through the secondary job change. I hunted and hunted and hunted\u2026 Until one day, I began to wonder\u2026\u201d\u201cWonder what, Sir?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked to show his interest.\u201cWhy do we only ascend the Tower?\u201d\u201c...!\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his shock as the blacksmith continued, \u201cI wondered if there was a basement? What was beneath the Tower? We, the humans, have designated the \u20181st floor,\u2019 but I was curious if it was really the lowest floor. I had many questions at the time.\u201dMany people still wondered what the Tower really was and why it appeared suddenly. There were plenty of scientists trying to figure out the answers to these questions. However, no one had ever thought about the Tower\u2019s basement.It was a refreshing idea to Gi-Gyu because he had also only ever thought about ascending the Tower.Old Man Hwang explained, \u201cI spent many years trying to find the basement. I roamed the 1st-floor countless times; I\u2019ve even been to some 1st-floor spots no one has ever seen.\u201dNoticing the anticipation in Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes, the old man\u2019s face turned red in pleasure. \u201cFinally, I found it.\u201dIt probably happened a long time ago, yet Old Man Hwang looked up in the air as if it were yesterday. \u201cI found the door that led to the basement.\u201d[You have received information beyond your qualification.][You will suffer a penalty.]Old Man Hwang continued to speak calmly, but Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes wavered. When Old Man Hwang said that he found the door to the basement, Gi-Gyu alone heard a system announcement, and a sudden sharp pain assaulted his brain. It was so agonizing that Gi-Gyu almost fainted.Lou shouted.-Stay awake!His Ego\u2019s roar kept him from losing consciousness; then, Gi-Gyu bit his lower lip until it began bleeding to keep himself awake. The unpleasant smell of his blood tickled his nose.\u2018Information\u00a0beyond my qualification\u2026? Penalty\u2026\u2019As if he was falling into a deep sleep, his brain began to slow down. Before Gi-Gyu could process what was happening, Old Man Hwang continued, \u201cAnd when I walked through that door\u2026\u201dOld Man Hwang was panting breathlessly now, his face was deathly pale, and his breathing was uneven. However, he still finished the sentence.\u201cThere was a whole new world behind it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88. Old Man Hwang (2)\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d Every time Gi-Gyu heard new information about the basement, he would feel that atrociously horrid pain. The pain from the penalty made him groan, worrying Old Man Hwang. \u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 am okay\u2026 P-please continue\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu bit his lips again and groaned. A drop of blood trailed down his face and fell on Old Man Hwang\u2019s forehead. The blacksmith murmured appreciatively, \u201cThank you.\u201dOld Man Hwang was thankful Gi-Gyu was willing to listen to his story. But Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t enduring this pain just to appease the blacksmith.\u2018A different world\u2026\u2019As expected, the Tower had many secrets. Gi-Gyu guessed that Soo-Jung, Tae-Shik, and the others refused to tell him these deep secrets because they knew about the penalty. So this was his chance to find out as much as he could.Old Man Hwang continued, \u201cLike a vagrant, I roamed in this new world.\u201d\u201cWhat was it like down there?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he poured more potion into the elderly man\u2019s mouth. The potion was doing nothing more than temporarily prolonging the blacksmith\u2019s life, but that was enough. Gi-Gyu kept giving him small doses to keep him alive and fulfill his dying wish.\u201cBurning lands\u2026 Lifeless desert\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a beautiful world,\u201d answered Old Man Hwang.-Hmm.When Lou made a noise, Gi-Gyu asked silently, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Do you know this place?\u2019-Just listen for now.It looked like Lou also had something to say about this place. The elderly man continued, \u201cI explored that place for a long time, but I couldn\u2019t find anything special. It felt like I was wandering through an endless gate\u2026 It felt useless. After spending a long time there without finding anything, I decided to return home. But on my way back\u2026\u201dFear crawled on Old Man Hwang\u2019s face as he said, \u201cI met a monster. It was a creature with dozens of arms and\u2026 Mind you, I was a pretty powerful player then, but this monster was much stronger than me. It played with me as a cat does with a yarn ball. I was being ripped apart when\u2026\u201dThe fear receded, serenity took over, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. It told Gi-Gyu that he was thinking about something pleasant.Old Man Hwang continued, \u201cThat\u2019s when I met her.\u201d\u201cHer?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Old Man Hwang\u2019s simple smile turned bright and innocent as he added, \u201cMy wife.\u201dYearning matured over years of separation floated in the old man\u2019s eyes. Strangely, the statement made Gi-Gyu uncomfortable; he asked, with a tense face, \u201cWas she\u2026 a player?\u201d\u2018His wife saved him in this new world? Wait! Was she even\u2026 human?\u2019\u201cNo\u2026 She was\u2026 Khoff, khoff!\u201d Old Man Hwang coughed up more blood.\u201cSir!\u201d Gi-Gyu yelled, seeing the last of his vitality fading away. Tears rolling down his cheeks, the blacksmith whispered, \"No, I can\u2019t die like this\u2026 Min-Su will be left all alone\u2026\u201dOld Man Hwang always looked so strong and stubborn, but even he couldn\u2019t face his death calmly. As sadness filled Gi-Gyu, Old Man Hwang\u2019s face brightened, and he said, \u201cWait! You can make Egos\u2026 You can\u2019t create weapons, but\u2026 just like how you gave Brunheart a new life...\u201dQuickly realizing what the blacksmith was talking about, Gi-Gyu became pale. Old Man Hwang begged, \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d The elderly man looked up at Gi-Gyu with determination and asked, \u201cYou must turn me into an Ego.\u201d\u201cSir!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors that you can egofy the dead.\u201d\u201cBut it isn\u2019t always a success.\u201dOld Man Hwang forced his mangled hands to move and held Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll die either way, so don\u2019t you think it\u2019s worth a try?\u201d-No way! If the egofication fails, his soul will be torn apart. He\u2019ll never ever be resurrected then.Gi-Gyu relayed Lou\u2019s warning to the elderly blacksmith, but Old Man Hwang was, once again, adamant.\u201cI\u2019m begging you.\u201d The elderly man looked at Gi-Gyu desperately, making Gi-Gyu call upon Lou for help.-I hate humans.Lou answered in frustration. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cLou, is there a way to increase the success rate of an egofication process?\u201d-Cannibalism isn\u2019t something you can control. Everyone must accept the fate given to them based on their qualifications. I can\u2019t guarantee you anything.Suddenly, Old Man Hwang grabbed Lou\u2019s blade, staining it with his blood. The elderly man already had enough wounds, and grabbing a sharp sword's blade did him no favors. But, his nerves were already too dull to feel pain; he slowly pulled Lou toward his chest and murmured, \u201cP-lease\u2026 Do this for me\u2026\u201dThe problem here wasn\u2019t only the success rate. Even if the egofication was a success, Gi-Gyu had no weapon to incorporate the Ego in. It might be a dying man\u2019s wish, but Gi-Gyu still had a full shell.So, even if everything worked out perfectly, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t immediately converse with the egofied Old Man Hwang. Gi-Gyu had to gain as much information as possible right now. \u201cWhere is Min-Su?\u201d\u201cThe 1st floor of the Tower. The door to the basement\u2026 T-take this with you.\u201d Old Man Hwang let go of Lou to rummage for something in his pocket. He took out a keychain-sized hammer and a crumpled piece of paper. Gi-Gyu accepted them and asked, \u201cAre you saying Min-Su is inside the Tower?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s right. You must rescue Min-Su. Min-Su will become a blacksmith much more powerful than me\u2026 Min-Su\u2026 He was kidnapped, so you must\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu shook his head, unable to understand what the old man told him. Sadly, Old Man Hwang\u2019s hour had come, and he was at peace with it now. When Gi-Gyu looked him straight in the eye, Old Man Hwang smiled.Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cI hope I will see you again\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLou pierced the elderly man\u2019s heart.[Cannibalism is being activated.]The system announcement made Gi-Gyu\u2019s heart heavy, and sadness engulfed him slowly.***There were too many confusing pieces to this puzzle.\u2018So Min-Su was kidnapped. The kidnapper also fatally wounded Old Man Hwang, stole all the weapons, and escaped to the Tower.\u2019What confused Gi-Gyu was the part about Min-Su.\u2018How did Min-Su enter the Tower? And that boy will become a greater blacksmith than Old Man Hwang?\u2019Min-Su was not a player, so how did he enter the Tower. Did he receive an invitation since the last time Gi-Gyu saw him?When Gi-Gyu opened the crumpled piece of paper Old Man Hwang gave him, he gasped.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu immediately recognized it. In fact, he suspected not many in the entire world knew about it better than he did: It was a detailed map of the 1st floor. The only thing new to Gi-Gyu was a hand-drawn door.\u201cThis must be the entrance to the basement?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. Surprisingly, it was in a spot that other players usually overlooked and rarely visited\u2014a familiar spot.\u201cCould it be\u2026?\u201dR-r-r-ring.Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t given much time to contemplate. He picked up his cell phone and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d-Did something happen?Sung-Hoon replied without greeting Gi-Gyu. The association agents from before must have contacted him.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cNothing important. I\u2019m going to the Tower right now; I need to get there as quickly as possible, so\u2026\u201d-Got it. I\u2019ll have everything arranged to keep interferences to a minimum.Sung-Hoon could hear the sorrow in Gi-Gyu\u2019s voice, so he promptly reassured Gi-Gyu and hung up, making Gi-Gyu smile.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu took out the small hammer Old Man Hwang gave him. For now, he had no idea how to use this item.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply once more before heading out.***True to his urgency, Gi-Gyu moved like lightning. All the emotion felt a little overwhelming, but the wind slapping his face helped.\u2018I wonder what this other world is like.\u2019Conspiracy theorists believed the Tower and the gates were separate worlds, different from ours. And according to Old Man Hwang, there indeed was a different world beneath the Tower. It took a strong and open mind to accept this theory.\u2018Lou! El! Is there anything you know about this?\u2019-Well, I wonder if you\u2019ll be penalized again if I tell you.When Lou murmured, Gi-Gyu paused and shivered. He was somehow able to endure the pain while Old Man Hwang told him his story, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could do it again.\u2018So much agony for so little information. That\u2019s a shitty bargain.\u2019-You better believe it. I bet most other players would\u2019ve died. You a freak! Most likely, either your willpower or your evil eye kept you going. But I\u2019m telling you that you almost died back there. Probably, Old Man Hwang didn\u2019t expect you to get this penalty. Else, he also wouldn\u2019t have spilled the beans like that.Gi-Gyu agreed with Lou\u2019s assessment. After gulping loudly, he asked, \u201cYou can tell me. Just do it.\u201dJust in case the incredible pain returned, Gi-Gyu stopped moving. After a short hesitation, Lou replied.-Idiot. You could die, you know. I\u2019ll just give you the safe information.Lou paused, wanting to see if the penalty was activated. When nothing happened, he continued.-Yes, different worlds exist. Many different worlds exist. There are many El or I don\u2019t even know about. As for the Tower\u2026Suddenly, a mild ache appeared in Gi-Gyu\u2019s head. A sign of the penalty beginning. Realizing what was happening, Lou stopped. He muttered instead,-There is no need for you to rush like this. Just wait until you reach the 50th floor.***Gi-Gyu continued to sprint after he entered the Tower. He briefly considered asking others for help, but that would mean sharing too many secrets. This situation involved a completely different world. In addition, Min-Su\u2019s safety was at risk. Min-Su could be the next best Ego blacksmith; revealing this to others could create problems for Gi-Gyu.Gi-Gyu also felt confident he could take care of himself. He was much stronger now, so he was confident he could get out of any problem alive.\u2018In the worst-case scenario, I can just escape.\u2019Fortunately for Gi-Gyu, this confidence didn\u2019t come from arrogance.Gi-Gyu hurried toward the location marked on the map\u2014the familiar spot.\u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s here.\u2019When he worked as a guide, Gi-Gyu visited this spot every day for five years. Yet he never noticed anything odd. He still couldn\u2019t believe that the basement door was located there.The surrounding scenery changed quickly. Since the assimilation grade increased, Gi-Gyu\u2019s speed went up another notch. Most players on the 1st floor were newbies, so they couldn\u2019t even perceive him.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu suddenly stopped. It felt like he was going around in circles for some reason. The other players might not have noticed it, but something wasn\u2019t right. Gi-Gyu knew exactly where he needed to go, and he should\u2019ve arrived by now.\u201cI think there is a barrier around here,\u201d he muttered. Inside the Tower, all barriers became stronger, so Gi-Gyu could tell he was standing before one.\u2018Evil eye.\u2019\u00a0He activated his skill silently. His right eye turned light violet, allowing him to see through the magic. The increase in assimilation grade also gave him his evil eye back. With it, Gi-Gyu quickly discovered a transparent membrane.\u201cTwo barriers? Cognitive impairment barrier and an entrance limitation barrier.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu put his hand on it, it bounced back.\u201cSomething\u2019s definitely happening inside,\u201d he muttered. The problem was that he had no idea how to break it. Did he have to get help from the other after all? Gi-Gyu was thinking of possible solutions when he suddenly remembered something.-Yeah, there is a very good chance this is the key.Then, Gi-Gyu took out the mysterious small hammer Old Man Hwang gave him before his death.Bzzz...When it reached the barrier, a small portion of the transparent membrane ripped. The opening was just big enough for Gi-Gyu to enter. The hammer wasn\u2019t a one-time use item since it remained perfectly intact in Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand.Putting it back in his pocket, Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. A sudden tension-filled him as he took a step forward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89. Old Man Hwang (3)Inside the barrier on the 1st floor, dozens of masked players stood surrounding a man wearing a worn leather jacket and holding a boy.One of the masked players,\u00a0who seemed to be the\u00a0group leader, said to the man in the leather jacket, \u201cWe must prepare for the ritual.\u201d\u201cAll right. Go ahead,\u201d the man replied in a resigned voice. The masked player nodded and announced, \u201cGet ready for the ritual!\u201dEvery player in the group wore a unique mask; most masks had foul-looking monsters.\u00a0The masked players began moving per order. Some began forming a circle, some with canes began drawing magic circles, and the rest activated their skills.Clatter.Clatter.A part of the masked group began dragging a stone coffin toward the center.The leader of the masked players announced, \u201cThis is the sacrificial altar.\u201d He sounded euphoric as he spoke, but the man in the leather jacket remained rigid without answering.\u201cIs something not to your liking,\u00a0Apostle?\u201d The masked player asked when he sensed the leather-clad man\u2019s displeasure. The \u201cApostle\u201d remained quiet as he looked down at the child in his arms, about seven or eight years old. The others couldn\u2019t see it, but his innocent appearance hid his incredible potential and already awakened powers.Finally, the apostle shook his head and replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d It was too late to regret his decision since he had come too far. Remembering the sacrifices he made, the apostle smiled bitterly, perhaps also realizing that it was all for nothing.The masked player appeared relieved by the apostle\u2019s unwavering will. The other players were focused on their tasks as the masked player murmured, \u201cOnce the ritual is complete, the door will open. Then\u2026\u201dThe masked player suddenly opened his arms as if worshiping his god. \u201cThe gods will appear and punish this world! And you, our apostle\u201d\u2014he turned toward the leather-clad man\u2014\u201cshall be the king of all gods!\u201dEerie pleasure filled the masked player\u2019s face, and the others around also raised their hands and bowed to the apostle. Watching the fanatics all around him, the man in the leather jacket smiled bitterly. Here, he was the only one who knew the truth. They had no idea they were just tools serving their purpose.Once the sealed door opened and connected their world to the other world\u2026The man in the leather jacket murmured, \u201cYou people have no idea, do you?\u201d Every player around him could hear his words, but no one listened. They only heard what they wanted to hear.\u2018Andras, what\u2019s your true intention.\u2019\u00a0The man in the leather jacket was deep in his thoughts when he heard the announcement.\u201cThe preparation for the ritual is complete!\u201dIt was finally time. All the masked players kneeled and shouted, \u201cApostle! Please bring the offering!\u201d\u201cOur offering!\u201d\u201cOhhhh! The offering!\u201dThe man in the leather jacket silently looked down at the boy again.The leather-clad man used a skill to keep the child asleep so that he wouldn\u2019t wake up before and during the ritual. As for after the ritual\u2026\u2018He\u2019ll die.\u2019\u00a0The man thought grimly. This child was the key because his veins carried the doorkeeper\u2019s blood. However, once the key was used, both the door and the key would die. The boy will become the next doorkeeper, losing his moral lifespan and consciousness.Step.Step.The man began to move, holding the child in his arms gently. He slowly walked toward the stone coffin and closed the cover after placing the child inside.The leader of the masked players ordered, \u201cIt\u2019s time! Prepare for the last step!\u201dSeveral players standing nearby ran and began drawing a magic circle on top of the stone coffin with human blood.Whir!As the magic circles below and above the coffin began vibrating, even the cave in which the fanatics stood began shaking.Boom!A sudden resounding explosion drew everyone\u2019s attention. Seconds later, when their eyes returned to the coffin, they found a player riding a strange colored wolf atop it. The panicked players shouted, \u201cIs that a wolf?!\u201d\u201cAn intruder!\u201d\u201cWhere are our guards?!\u201d\u201cWhat? How did he cross the barrier?\u201dThe wolf lowered its head, making its rider more visible: Shiny black hair, gray armor, and a pair of black gauntlets. Those were actually the least striking features. His overwhelming magic made him seem like a god.The leather-clad man met his eyes with the player on the wolf. Suddenly, the wolf master opened his lips and asked in a cold voice, \u201cWhere is Min-Su?\u201d***When Gi-Gyu entered the barrier, he moved quickly to assess the situation. Thanks to his enhanced senses, he could pretty accurately count the players inside the barrier.Over 50 players were inside the barrier. 30 gathered in one spot, and the rest guarded the parameters. Gi-Gyu took care of the guards on the outer edges apace; luckily, he got some information from them.\u2018These bastards plan to open the door by using Min-Su as a human sacrifice.\u2019The masked players called themselves the\u00a0Caravan. Thinking the ritual was already over, the guards easily let out the information between curses.Gi-Gyu quickly summarized the situation. Someone, most likely Old Man Hwang, sealed the door to the other world. Only Min-Su could open the door since he was from the gatekeeper\u2019s bloodline. After opening the door, Min-Su would become something inhuman.\u2018Caravan\u2026 That sounds familiar.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu looked around the place and thought quietly. He remembered hearing the name Caravan before, but he didn\u2019t have the time to mull over it.\u201cKill him! Kill the intruder!\u201d the leader of the masked players ordered.\u201cDon\u2019t let him ruin our ritual!\u201d another player with a ghastly mask shouted desperately.\u201cApostle, please just focus on the ritual!\u201d another player yelled to the leather-clad man.The masked players\u2019 eyes were filled with madness as they rushed toward Gi-Gyu. However, they kept some distance from the stone coffin Gi-Gyu was standing on. All they did was scream at him as if they wanted him to leave the coffin.\u201cSomething\u2019s inside this, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked as he watched them. He was right since his enemies groaned, \u201cArgh\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let him interfere with our ritual\u2026\u201d One of the masked players whispered, but none dared to move.Meanwhile, Gi-Gyu continued to assess his opponents.\u2018Most of them are B-grade players\u2026 Mostly semi-rankers\u2026 I can sense a few A-grade rankers too, but\u2026\u2019What confused him was the man in the leather jacket. Based on Gi-Gyu's sense, he was about as strong as Gi-Gyu. Yet he refused to move and just silently stared at Gi-Gyu.\u201cTsk,\u201d Gi-Gyu clicked his tongue in frustration. No one was attacking him, but this didn\u2019t mean he could stay here forever. He ordered Bi to attack the players before him and simultaneously materialized Lou and El in his hands. Then, he plunged both of his Egos into the stone coffin.The masked players screamed, \u201cN-no!\u201d\u201cOur ritual!\u201dKaboom!When Gi-Gyu\u2019s swords entered the stone coffin, a giant explosion occurred. Gi-Gyu flew back and fell to the nearby ground, and the area began to burn in angry flames.\u201cUgh.\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned and rose, his body scorched from the explosion. Thankfully, Oberon and Brunheart absorbed most of the damage. He activated Accelerate and Rush at the right time to escape the blast radius; he would\u2019ve been badly hurt had he been any slower.\u201cKhoff, khoff.\u201d Gi-Gyu coughed from the smoke. He couldn\u2019t see very well due to the fumes, but he could hear the players screaming.\u201cAckkk!\u201d\u201cGet that wolf!\u201dIt seemed Bi was still doing his job faithfully.Swish!Suddenly, a refreshing wind blew, dispersing the smoke. The scene before Gi-Gyu was a mess. The coffin was mildly damaged, the magic circles were bent out of shape, and the players close to the coffin before bounced off to different places.However, the man in the leather jacket still stood exactly where he was before the explosion.\u201cThat man\u2026\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu, distracted by the sight.\u201cYou\u2019re interfering with our ritual! You bastard! Die!\u201d Suddenly, an almost-ranker-level player sprinted toward him while wielding a long spear.Rumble!Gi-Gyu simply stomped the ground, and the weak vibrations made the man lose his balance. Taking this opportunity, Gi-Gyu reached forward to slice the man\u2019s arm with Lou.\u201cUgh!\u201d the man moaned. However, the man didn\u2019t stop and thrust his spear toward Gi-Gyu.\u201cBinding.\u201dWhen the masked player saw the black stem growing from Oberon, he swung his spear to cut it. However, it was the wrong move. Raising his arm left his body unprotected, and Gi-Gyu promptly plunged Lou into the player\u2019s neck.The masked player stammered as he choked, \u201cU-gh\u2026 O\u2026our r\u2026ritual\u2026 Our god\u2026 Andras\u2026\u201dWithin seconds, the man stopped breathing.\u201cAndras?\u201d-Andras\u2026? Did that bastard\u2026Lou whispered in rage. Gi-Gyu hadn\u2019t felt such anger from Lou since the 30th-floor test when his physical form was used as a puppet. The resentment Lou felt now seemed just as strong as then.Some players battling Bi headed toward Gi-Gyu as they screamed, \u201cDie! Die!\u201dEven Bi was badly injured now, so Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t continue to use him as his shield. He needed to come up with another plan.\u201cIt should be okay here,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured. This place was surrounded by a high-level barrier that not even the association noticed. Here, he felt comfortable fighting to the best of his abilities.\u2018Min-Su is inside there.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu could feel Min-Su\u2019s presence inside the coffin with his unusually heightened senses now that it was a bit damaged. Since the explosion only gave the stone coffin mild scratches, Gi-Gyu felt certain Min-Su was still safe inside.Over ten players stormed toward Gi-Gyu as they used their skills.\u201cKill him!\u201d\u201cOpen,\u201d Gi-Gyu ordered; immediately, Brunheart\u2019s gate opened as a blue light shone from his chest.\u201cH-he\u2019s accessing god\u2019s territory! But how?!\u201d one masked player stammered in shock.\u201cT-this can\u2019t be! He\u2019s only human!\u201d another whispered.\u201cWho is that man?!\u201d some injured masked player on the ground yelled.\u201cIs he also a god\u2019s messenger?!\u201d the leader of the masked players shouted in confusion.While the players stared at the blue gate in shock, Gi-Gyu ordered, \u201cDurahan. Bring out the skeletons.\u201d-As\u2026 you\u2026 wish\u2026After eating so many crystals, the durahan could now speak a little. Then, the headless durahan and a long row of skeleton soldiers exited the dancing blue light.One of the masked players murmured in surrender, \u201cThose are the god\u2019s soldiers\u2026\u201dGi-Gyu ordered, \u201cKill them all.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command,\u201d the durahan murmured as it swung its giant sword. After the battle began, Gi-Gyu slowly walked toward the stone coffin while keeping an eye on the leather-clad man. He still hadn\u2019t moved. Gi-Gyu lifted the stone coffin and placed it inside the gate using his incredible strength.\u201cHart, you know what to do. Take care of it, all right?\u201d Gi-Gyu ordered.-Grandmaster, your wish is my command.The gate closed, but the battle didn\u2019t stop. Explosions and screams could be heard from everywhere, but the leather-clad man and Gi-Gyu stood quietly as if they had nothing to do. When their eyes met, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you stopping me?\u201dHad the man tried, he could\u2019ve stopped Gi-Gyu from taking the coffin. Yet, he didn\u2019t move a muscle. The man gave Gi-Gyu a bitter smile and replied, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want my son to be used like this either.\u201dAfter a brief stunned silence, Gi-Gyu asked in shock, \u201cSir\u2026? You\u2019re Min-Su\u2019s father?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90. Old Man Hwang (4)Gi-Gyu\u2019s politeness confused the leather-clad man, and a dazed look appeared on the man\u2019s face before he began laughing.\u201cKekeke\u2026 I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being so polite to me in a situation like this. What an odd guy you are.\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu remained quiet, the man asked, \u201cDid my father send you?\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide his shock. He came here to save Min-Su, but the boy had been with his father all this time? So was Min-Su not kidnapped by the assailant who murdered Old Man Hwang? This whole situation was becoming too confusing.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re really Old Man Hwang\u2019s son and Min-Su\u2019s father?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I attacked my own father and brought my son, Min-Su, here.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 why?\u201d Gi-Gyu felt flabbergasted. Min-Su\u2019s father replied, \u201cI guess saying \u2018I had no choice\u2019 would be meaningless at this point.\u201dThe man looked around his surroundings before murmuring, \u201cI think we still have a little time, so I\u2019ll tell you. Since you managed to pass through the barrier, I\u2019m sure my father sent. If my father trusts you, I suppose I can talk to you.\u201dThe man looked up at Gi-Gyu and asked, \u201cAre you aware that the Tower is connected to another world?\u201d\u201cI do\u2026 a little, S-Sir.\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know how he should treat Min-Su\u2019s father. On the one hand, he killed Old Man Hwang and kidnapped Min-Su; on the other hand, he was Old Man Hwang\u2019s son and Min-Su\u2019s father. Suddenly, Gi-Gyu thought of something very awkward and shouted, \u201cW-wait!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cH-how old are you?\u201d Gi-Gyu stammered. It might sound random, but it was a relevant question. The Tower appeared 23 years ago, and Old Man Hwang met his wife in the Tower\u2019s basement. So, if the leather-clad man was really their son, he should be 23 at most. However, he didn\u2019t look very young. Add Min-Su and his age into the mix, and you would get a conundrum.Each piece of this puzzle was seemingly made of another puzzle.\u201cI\u2019m older than you.\u201d When the man answered, Gi-Gyu stuttered, \u201cH-how is that possible\u2026?\u201dThe man tilted his head and replied, \u201cI guess Father didn\u2019t get to tell you much.\u201dSuddenly, the surviving masked players shouted, \u201cApostle! You must destroy our enemy! We must complete our ritual!\u201d The fanatics begged, but the man in the leather jacket only looked at them blankly before continuing, \u201cTime passes differently in that world. My father spent a very long time in that place, and so did I. But not Min-Su.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed, finally beginning to put together the little puzzles. He remembered Soo-Jung, Lucifer, mentioning that she was the same earth age as him. He didn\u2019t understand this at the time, but now, it made more sense.Knowing this man was Min-Su\u2019s father and Old Man Hwang\u2019s son, Gi-Gyu felt hesitant to fight him. And the important information he willingly gave wasn\u2019t helping Gi-Gyu decide. He could also tell the man meant him no harm, and the ones who did were busy with Bi and his skeletons.In the end, Gi-Gyu decided to carry on with this conversation.Min-Su\u2019s father explained, \u201cMy father and Min-Su were born on earth, but I was born in the other world. I grew up there too. And creatures who live in a world different from where they were born have to suffer the penalty.\u201dWith a bitter smile, the man caressed his face.Crack!It was just for a moment, but Gi-Gyu thought he saw the man\u2019s face crack like porcelain. And within the cracks, he could see flames burning brightly.The man took his hand away from his face and continued, \u201cI contemplated for a very long time. I wondered if I should return to where I grew up and, if so, how I could accomplish it. But my father stopped me from returning to my world. He also severed any relationship we had.\u201dSo Old Man Hwang did seal the door; for some reason, the father-son duo unpleasantly parted ways.The leather-clad man muttered, \u201cI suffered so much. But I endured it for my son. Yet\u201d\u2014he smiled\u2014\u201cAndras told me that I should live my own life. I could be king in that world if I returned.\u201d\u201cAndras?\u201d\u2018This curious name again?\u2019When Gi-Gyu asked, the man replied, \u201cI guess you don\u2019t know about him. Those skeleton soldiers fighting for you\u2026 Their\u2026 should I call it a leader?\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes became blank as he continued to murmur incorrigibly. Lou, who had been listening quietly, explained.-It\u2019s a psychic attack: Andras\u2019 specialty. I don\u2019t think this man can think for himself anymore. He had some natural immunity, which must be why he could endure until now. But his strength actually made things worse. His mind and Andras\u2019 brainwashing created a whole new consciousness in his head.Lou seemed to be laughing at the man in the leather jacket.\u201cI-I\u2019m going to become a king. I\u2019ll be the king, and Min-Su\u2026 Min-Su?\u201d the man continued to murmur in confusion.Crack!Suddenly, Gi-Gyu realized he wasn\u2019t mistaken about the man\u2019s face. It really was cracking like a vase.The man shouted, \u201cI-I must open the door. The offering\u2026 The offering!\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t understand what was happening, but Lou explained.-It\u2019s too late now. If El were stronger, we could\u2019ve done something about the brainwashing, but now\u2026The man began to rotate his head in circles. Slowly at first, but it became faster by the second. When the surviving masked players saw this, they screamed, \u201cThe apostle is descending!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cIf we stay here, we\u2019ll all die!\u201dThe players shrieked and began running away, but the skeletons and the durahan didn\u2019t stop stabbing their backs. The fanatics tried their best to escape, creating a bizarre sight. Meanwhile, the sudden change made Gi-Gyu study his surroundings carefully.One ranker-level player wearing a mask shouted, \u201cThe barrier! We must remove the barrier so we can escape! We must get out of here!\u201dGi-Gyu had no time to waste since he had to figure out the mystery that the leather-clad man was.Gi-Gyu activated his evil eye, turning his eyes a dark violet. The man\u2019s face was melting and cracking simultaneously now; his entire body gave off extreme heat as if he was burning alive.[Flame Giant]The stat screen above the man\u2019s head indicated his true name. Suddenly, the man bulged as a colossal flame pillar engulfed him.***\u201cWhere did you go\u2026?\u201d Sung-Hoon murmured. When he heard Gi-Gyu was heading toward the Tower, he followed immediately. But when he arrived, he couldn\u2019t find Gi-Gyu anywhere. Every floor of the Tower had portal maintenance agents, so finding Gi-Gyu should\u2019ve been easy, but he was nowhere to be found.All Sung-Hoon knew was that Gi-Gyu was inside the Tower somewhere. He couldn\u2019t have been too far behind, so where did Gi-Gyu go?\u201cHe has to be on the 1st floor somewhere,\u201d muttered Sung-Hoon. Since none of the portal workers knew where Gi-Gyu was, Sung-Hoon could only roam around.Feeling frustrated, Sung-Hoon sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026How did he go missing in an active landmark like the 1st floor?\u201dIf Sung-Hoon failed to find Gi-Gyu soon, he would be in big trouble as he would get a scolding from the association president himself.Just when Sung-Hoon was about to drown in frustration, a familiar agent ran toward him and yelled, \u201cAgent Heo Sung-Hoon!\u201dRight now, there was only one reason an agent would look for him. So, boundless relief filled Sung-Hoon as he asked, \u201cDid you find him?\u201dThe agent shook his head and replied, \u201cNo\u2026 That\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cThen what is it?!\u201d\u201cThere is a barrier on the 1st floor! It\u2019s gone now, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked, but the agent was too busy panting. Sung-Hoon understood that the agent probably ran here, but did he have to pause at such a dramatic moment? After taking a few more gulps of air, the agent continued, \u201cSkeletons and a durahan! The area is filled with skeletons, and we\u2019ve even received reports of a giant fire.\u201dSung-Hoon became visibly rigid. He asked in a panic, \u201cWhere?!\u201dAfter hearing the location, Sung-Hoon decided to rush there; before leaving, he turned around and ordered, \u201cCall the general manager of the Department of Gate Maintenance (DGM). Inform General Manager Oh Tae-Shik about this! Tell him there is an emergency on the 1st floor! Tell him we need Grigory!\u201d\u201cGrigory\u2026?\u201d the agent murmured in confusion.\u201cJust tell him; he\u2019ll know!\u201d\u201cY-yes, Sir!\u201dWhile sprinting toward his destination, Sung-Hoon muttered, \u201cJust what are you doing?\u201d***The masked players deactivated the barrier to escape. Even though Gi-Gyu now didn\u2019t have to worry about the barrier, he didn\u2019t feel all that happy.Kaboom!The flame giant slammed down its right hand, narrowly missing Gi-Gyu.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed and repositioned himself, but things were getting worse. With each passing second, the flame giant got crazier, and the heat went up a notch. Lou\u2019s flame resistance helped initially; now, it wasn\u2019t as effective.\u201cIs this hellfire or something?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured before shaking his head. To non-players, it might feel like flames from hell. However, Gi-Gyu knew better since he had seen real hellfire before.Boom!\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d He sighed again and jumped to avoid the attack. Using his senses, he figured out the other players\u2019 locations. There weren\u2019t many survivors, and the skeletons, the durahan, and Bi were still hunting them.\u201cJust the gate monsters should be enough for them,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured before calling quietly, \u201cBi.\u201dHe could sense Bi rushing toward him; before he knew it, Bi was around his neck in his necklace form. As he dodged the flame giant\u2019s fist again, he shouted, \u201cElemental Water!\u201dSuddenly, Gi-Gyu turned into water, and his speed increased. His hands, now made of water drops, still held Lou and El firmly. Finally ready, Gi-Gyu crashed into the flame giant.Kaboommm!The collision of a hot and a cold force created an explosion so loud and massive that the entire floor heard and saw it.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned as he stood up. Unfortunately, he received more damage from the explosion than his opponent and now had a scorched body. His water form was also gone since his control over the elemental skills was still lacking.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Thinking up another idea, Gi-Gyu shouted, \u201cElemental fire!\u201dFlames erupted from Gi-Gyu; even though they weren\u2019t as intense as the flame giant\u2019s, they still held impressive energy. Gi-Gyu now looked like a man on fire. He flew high up in the air and crashed into the flame giant again.***\u201cH\u2026humans\u2026 in masks\u2026 players\u2026 kill\u2026 Grandmaster ordered\u2026\u201d After hearing the durahan\u2019s stutter, Sung-Hoon replied, \u201cYou mean Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu ordered you to kill the masked players?\u201d\u201cT\u2026that\u2019s\u2026 right.\u201d Durahan nodded. Sung-Hoon was running toward the giant fire when he lucked out and met the durahan. The durahan was busy killing masked players; thankfully, it recognized Sung-Hoon as an ally.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon sighed deeply. He remembered this durahan was one of the many Gi-Gyu summoned before. Based on what the durahan told him, Sung-Hoon figured out Gi-Gyu was battling the masked players.\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll join you,\u201d Sung-Hoon announced. He had asked for Grigory, so he knew this area would soon be under control. Only the strongest ranker could pass through Grigory.Sung-Hoon turned to look at the huge fire nearby. A scene right out of the biblical apocalypse.\u201cHe has been hunting humans more than the monsters lately.\u201d Sung-Hoon shook his head and raised his spear. Whatever happened, his role would remain the same.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91. Old Man Hwang (5)-So you\u2019re just going to do a half-ass job like this?When Lou grumbled in frustration, Gi-Gyu argued, \u201cIt's because I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d-Master, I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt. Please don\u2019t show any kindness to that demon.-Master! Please don\u2019t get hurt\u2026 I\u2019ll be so sad if you do\u2026El and Brunheart begged. Gi-Gyu\u2019s reply to Lou was sharp, but he couldn\u2019t do the same to his other Egos since they were just worried for him.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed, took a step back, and poured more magic into Binding to trap the flame giant.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in frustration. The flame giant, Old Man Hwang\u2019s son and Min Su\u2019s father, was just a brainwashed pawn. If possible, Gi-Gyu wanted to avoid killing him and suppress the flame giant in any way he could.But\u2026\u201cAt this rate, it\u2019s going to become very dangerous. I can\u2019t let this go on any further.\u201dDrip.A drop of blood trickled down Gi-Gyu\u2019s arm. A clear sign of his accumulated damage increasing at an alarming rate. Even before the man transformed, he was about as strong as Gi-Gyu. However, the battle slowly became one-sided after his transformation. Gi-Gyu knew it was hubris to believe he could subdue this monster alone.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu had no choice but to give up his wish to capture the flame giant alive.-Fucking idiot!Lou\u2019s curse made Gi-Gyu frown. \u201cYour tone has been very disrespectful lately, Lou.\u201d-Can you blame me? Why do you believe suppressing him is the only solution here?\u201cIsn\u2019t it obviou\u2014\u201d Gi-Gyu stopped mid-sentence, abruptly realizing Lou was right.\u2018Why am I so fixated on suppressing that? If that isn\u2019t an option, just gotta employ the second-best option.\u2019Gi-Gyu grumbled, \u201cThanks.\u201d All the shocking info about the other world and such had seemingly muddled his brain because he usually read such situations faster and better.\u201cIt\u2019s normal for humans to make mistakes from time to time.\u201d Gi-Gyu grinned and patted Lou\u2019s handle.-Idio\u2014Lou tried to protest in embarrassment, but El and Brunheart solicited attention before he could.-Master.-Master! Pat me! Pat me too!Gi-Gyu smiled wide again and grasped Lou and El.\u201cDeath,\u201d he muttered when he saw the flame giant\u2019s fist coming toward him.Kaboom!The violet smoke from Lou gave rise to an explosion; Gi-Gyu used that to plunge Lou into the flame giant\u2019s fist promptly. \u201cI can purify him with Death.\u201d***The battle wasn\u2019t an easy one, since Gi-Gyu was just beginning to get a handle on Death. If he had perfect control over this skill, perhaps he would\u2019ve had an easier time. Unless he plunged Lou into one of the fatal spots, delivering a critical hit would be tough. However, Death was an incredible skill and a secret weapon that even Lucifer praised; ultimately, the flame giant fell to the ground.The violet smoke corroded the flame giant on the ground slowly. Soon, his body cracked, and the original human form returned.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d Old Man Hwang\u2019s son, now naked, panted on the ground. Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cAre you back now?\u201dGi-Gyu didn\u2019t let his guard down since he wasn\u2019t a soothsayer. Suddenly, the naked man on the ground began to mutter his name. \u201cMy name\u2026 is Hwang Chae-Il\u2026 My alias is\u2026\u201dHwang Chae-Il was seemingly trying to remind himself who he was. Gi-Gyu listened quietly as the man continued, \u201cPaimon\u2019s descendant\u2026\u201d-I knew it.Lou smirked and muttered,-Ask him about Andras.\u201cSir, can you tell me about Andras?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu asked urgently, Hwang Chae-Il whispered, \u201cAndras! Go find the Caravan Guild! That\u2019s where Andras\u2026\u201dThe last flames on Hwang Chae-Il\u2019s body were going out, so Gi-Gyu hurriedly ran to the dying man. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Sir.\u201d\u201cW-what do you mean\u2026?\u201dStab!Lou pierced Hwang Chae-Il\u2019s heart in a single thrust; Min-Su\u2019s father begged, \u201cP-please take care of Min-Su\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can take care of him yourself later,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. Hwang Chae-Il died, and Gi-Gyu heard the system announcement.[Cannibalism is being activated.][The flame giant is being absorbed.][The flame giant is being egofied.][Egofication of the flame giant has succeeded.]\u201cIt worked,\u201d Gi-Gyu smiled brightly. However, sadness filled his face a second later. Feeling his heavy heart, his Egos became quiet.\u201cI guess I killed the father and son today with my own hands,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. What Old Man Hwang and Hwang Chae-Il experienced today probably couldn\u2019t be called true deaths, but this didn\u2019t change that Gi-Gyu ended their lives. Gi-Gyu wondered what Min-Su would think if he came to know of today\u2019s proceedings.\u2018Probably a mountain of resentment.\u2019\u201cThis is becoming so complicated.\u201d Gi-Gyu decided he had to untangle this messiness as quickly as possible.\u201cRanker Kim Gi-Gyu!\u201d Suddenly, he heard a familiar voice and turned around to spot Sung-Hoon.\u201cSung-Hoon?\u201d A confused look appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face since he didn\u2019t expect to see Sung-Hoon here.\u201cJust what happened here\u2026?\u201d Sung-Hoon trailed off. Both men looked around their surroundings to find it was scorched as if it had just suffered heaven\u2019s wrath.Feeling awkward, Gi-Gyu scratched the back of his head and replied, \u201cI needed to take care of something personal, and it kind of happened\u2026 I had no control over this.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Sung-Hoon sighed deeply and stated, \u201cThe association will take care of this place for now. We were all shocked to find a barrier on this floor. How could something like this happen\u2026 Do you have any idea who was behind it?\u201dHis eyes turning sharp, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cCaravan. I was told that it was the Caravan Guild.\u201dSung-Hoon tilted his head since he had never heard of this guild before. \u201cWell, I obviously don\u2019t know every single guild in Korea. Shall I investigate this Caravan Guild for you?\u201d\u201cYes, that would be helpful.\u201d When Gi-Gyu answered, Sung-Hoon nodded and asked, \u201cMay I have a quick look around?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. I don\u2019t think the others can enter this place yet anyway.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded and walked toward the ritual site. It was such a familiar place that he couldn\u2019t forget it even if he tried.It was a small cave Gi-Gyu lucked out and discovered a long time ago. After that, he visited this place for the next five years, hunting a single goblin every day.\u201cIt has been a long time since I came to my old hunting spot,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu.\u201cKirrrk.\u201d Suddenly, a goblin sneaked out from the tiny crack of the cave.\u201cHmm?\u201d Gi-Gyu looked down at his worn watch and nodded: The goblin still appeared at the same time; it still just roamed around without ever leaving the area. Gi-Gyu felt glad to see the goblin for some reason. It was like meeting an old friend.\u201cSqueak!\u201d After feeling Gi-Gyu\u2019s overwhelming magic, the goblin screamed and ran away from him. The spectacle made Gi-Gyu grin in satisfaction. Lately, all his opponents had been very powerful, so he had forgotten how strong he had become. He could barely hunt and kill one goblin in the past, but the same monster was running away from him in fear. It made Gi-Gyu understand the extent of his recent growth.Slice.Gi-Gyu felt strangely refreshed after Lou slew the goblin. While he was studying the area, he caught something.\u201cWhat\u2019s this\u2026?\u201d The cave from which the goblin came flashed a golden light; the light vanished before he could look closer.***After asking Sung-Hoon to wait for him a while longer, Gi-Gyu touched the outer wall of the cave. But no matter what he tried, the cave remained the same. He didn\u2019t see a second golden flash no matter how long he waited. It remained the same cave he had seen for five years while working as a guide.\u2018What was that light?\u2019Gi-Gyu felt certain it was an Ego light.\u201cLou, do you know anything about this?\u201d-Hmm\u2026Among Gi-Gyu\u2019s Egos, Lou helped him the most in situations like this. El had been keeping quiet for some time now, while Brunheart wasn\u2019t exactly a good source of helpful information. For now, Lou was Gi-Gyu\u2019s most trusted and knowledgeable companion. However, Lou was having a hard time answering this one.-I might have known before I lost my memory, but I don\u2019t really know at this point.\u201cBut you still know a lot. There are times when I feel like you haven\u2019t really lost your memories,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. Just earlier, Lou had suggested he might know more after he saw Andras and the flame giant. Lou also gave surprising information to Gi-Gyu from time to time while he chatted with Baal.Lou explained,-I did lose my memories. It\u2019s just that some things can trigger my faded memories.Lou\u2019s explanation sounded very complicated. Gi-Gyu asked again, \u201cSo you can\u2019t think of anything?\u201d-If that door leads to the place that I\u2019m thinking about\u2026 That door itself might have a special power\u2026Quite unlike his usual confident self, Lou was uncertain. Gi-Gyu could only nod as he replied, \u201cWell\u2026 This cave isn\u2019t going anywhere, so I better return home and talk to Baal or Soo-Jung first.\u201d-I\u2019m not sure if things will work out the way you think.Without answering Lou, Gi-Gyu left the area. After he was out of sight, the golden light flashed again.***As usual, the association took care of the incident's aftermath. The association was partly responsible for it because it happened on the first floor. Creating such an enormous barrier was a big task, so the association should\u2019ve caught it sooner. The association also had no excuse for allowing suspicious masked players to roam freely on the first floor.The first floor of the Tower was where the most novice players practiced. The newbies would\u2019ve been powerless to protect themselves had something gone wrong.The association was still very busy dealing with the Iron Guild situation. The agents were already on edge, so they spent much effort investigating the Caravan Guild. Unfortunately, they could not locate this particular guild. It wasn\u2019t registered in the association\u2019s official guild database, and no one could locate anything with the name Caravan either. Like a ghost organization, the Caravan seemed to be nonexistent.Finally, Gi-Gyu remembered where he had heard the name before.\u2018I\u2019m certain Tae-Oh said he was joining the Caravan Guild.\u2019When Gi-Gyu\u2019s power first awakened and he was focusing on hunting, he remembered bumping into his guide friend Kim Tae-Oh. At the time, Gi-Gyu thought his friend\u2019s personality seemed to have changed a little.Tae-Oh had said to him, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to join the Caravan Guild.\u201d He explained that this was why he was quitting the guide job. Finally, Gi-Gyu found a clue to this mystery. If he found Tae-Oh, he would find out about the Caravan.After\u00a0relaying this information to the association, Gi-Gyu returned home. When he told Soo-Jung about his findings, she asked tensely, \u201cWhat did you just say\u2026?\u201dBaal, who was listening nearby, also didn\u2019t look very happy. Wondering if he had done something wrong, Gi-Gyu repeated, \u201cI said that the Caravan players tried to open the door to the other world. And I think Andras is their leader.\u201dAfter a long silence, Soo-Jung replied, \u201cYou need to come with me to meet someone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92. Hwang Min-SuGi-Gyu\u2019s face showed confusion, but he could understand the situation in his head. That confusion was just the materialization of his internal awe.Soo-Jung asked him bluntly, \u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201dSoo-Jung didn\u2019t seem all that happy about where she was. Before Gi-Gyu could reply, Oh Tae-Gu explained, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my relationship with Lucifer is a bad one. Of course, how she must think of me is a completely different matter.\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.Currently, Gi-Gyu was in a small tea house with Tae-Gu and Soo-Jung. When Soo-Jung first told him they needed to meet someone together, Gi-Gyu had no idea whom she was talking about. He made a few guesses along the way, but the KPA president wasn\u2019t one.Gi-Gyu watched Soo-Jung make several calls before bringing him to this shabby tea house. When they arrived, Tae-Gu was already waiting for them.\u2018I guess this shouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. It was strange seeing them together; he realized it made sense when he thought about it. Tae-Gu and Soo-Jung were top players, they were most active around the same time, and they were both Koreans. So, it made perfect sense that Tae-Gu and Soo-Jung knew each other.Since Gi-Gyu had never seen Soo-Jung in contact with the association, he never considered the possibility that Soo-Jung and Tae-Gu knew each other.Feeling curious, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cHow do you two know each other?\u201dWithout a word, Soo-Jung raised her fist. Her fist cracked like glass, and her smooth pale hand resurfaced,\u00a0but a ring was now on her finger.Gi-Gyu murmured in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re a mercenary too\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, doesn\u2019t it make sense?\u00a0This old man has always been obsessed with strengthening his organization.\u00a0I suppose you can call our relationship a symbiotic one. It\u2019s no different from your relationship with the association, Gi-Gyu. Whenever we need something annoying or urgent taken care of, we call on each other,\u201d Soo-Jung explained as she gestured toward Tae-Gu with her chin.Even a stranger could tell Soo-Jung was acting impertinently toward the president. Tae-Gu was an elderly figure, while Soo-Jung looked like she was in her early 20s, making it look even more shocking. However, Gi-Gyu thought, \u2018I don\u2019t even know how old Soo-Jung really is.\u2019Soo-Jung previously told him that their earth ages were the same; therefore, he should speak informally to her. However, give the line more than a second, and you will realize something.\u2018Doesn\u2019t that mean she has a different age in a different world\u2026? Like Hwang Chae-Il, Soo-Jung might have lived much longer than she looks. In the other world\u2019s age system, she might be much older.\u2019If she wasn\u2019t as young as she looked, perhaps she wasn\u2019t acting impertinently. She might have been old enough to give her an excuse for her behavior.When Soo-Jung saw the understanding look on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face, she gasped. Looking horrified, she waved her hand and protested, \u201cHuh? What\u2019s that look on your face? No way! I\u2019m speaking this way because I don\u2019t like this old man. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m older than him.\u201d\u201cKhmm.\u201d Tae-Gu suddenly cleared his throat, indicating he wanted to get to the main point. \u201cSo why did the infamous Lucifer want to see me? I can\u2019t even remember the last time you contacted me.\u201dGi-Gyu could feel numerous strong auras around them. It had to be the association agents protecting their meeting place.\u2018I think they are named Grigory.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu still didn\u2019t know the true identity of this group, but he could tell they were elite soldiers under Tae-Gu and\u00a0Tae-Shik\u2019s\u00a0command.The shabby tea house was empty except for the three of them. Even the owner was nowhere to be seen, and the table they sat at didn\u2019t have any tea.\u201cYou\u2019ve already heard about the situation, right? The Caravan one?\u201d When Lucifer, Soo-Jung, replied, Tae-Gu tensed visibly and murmured, \u201cSo this is about that.\u201d\u201cI heard Andras is their leader.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d The news confused and shocked Tae-Gu. Realizing he hadn\u2019t told the association about Andras, Gi-Gyu exclaimed, \u201cAh!\u201dGi-Gyu explained, \u201cAccording to the players I battled inside the Tower, it sounded like someone named Andras\u00a0is leading\u00a0the Caravan Guild.\u201dTae-Gu cleared his throat again to show his displeasure, \u201cKhmm.\u201dSoo-Jung didn\u2019t seem very happy about this information either. \u201cI wonder what kind of progress they have made so far.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 haven\u2019t learned anything yet. I\u2019ve always suspected that they would open the door, but I never expected the door to be on the first floor.\u201dTae-Gu and Soo-Jung talked about stuff Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t understand, so he wondered why he was brought here in the first place. He looked at Soo-Jung, who seemed to understand what he was thinking. She asked, \u201cYou need to hear this too. You said you went through the penalty once already, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It was the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head, refusing to even think about the agony. He hadn\u2019t heard much about the other world, but explaining what happened was impossible without mentioning it. That was why Gi-Gyu told Soo-Jung about the penalty.Soo-Jung placed her hand on Gi-Gyu\u2019s head and ordered, \u201cJust stay still for a while.\u201dBeing patted by someone who seemed your age wasn\u2019t a good feeling. However, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t protest since he believed Soo-Jung had a good reason for doing something like this.[Marking is being activated.][Player Kim Gi-Gyu will temporarily belong to Player Jung Soo-Jung.][Imprint of Subordination will allow the pain to be shared.][Imprint of Subordination will allow tracing.][Imprint of Subordination.]Gi-Gyu heard several system announcements as several thick black lines appeared on his forehead.\u201c...?\u201d\u201cThis is my unique ability. Remember how I used it inside the Maze of Heryond before? That\u2019s why I can do this. You will belong to me temporarily, so I can share the pain you\u2019ll feel from the penalty. I can also temporarily increase my subordinate\u2019s attributes,\u201d Soo-Jung explained.\u201cWhat?\u201d Wide-eyed, Gi-Gyu turned to look at Soo-Jung. All this time, Gi-Gyu believed Marking was a simple buff skill; he had no idea it was such a potent skill. Soo-Jung once told him Marking was her unique ability, but he thought she was joking. Now, he realized she had gained another unique skill after going through the secondary job change. Still, Gi-Gyu deemed her black flames, her signature move, better than Marking.When\u00a0Gi-Gyu\u00a0looked unhappy, Soo-Jung frowned and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? We have a business relationship, don\u2019t we? I\u2019m your teacher, and you\u2019re my pupil. So this shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d\u201cJust explain this: What exactly does being your subordinate mean?\u201d Gi-Gyu demanded, his voice grave.There was a flash of annoyance on Soo-Jung\u2019s face before she grinned and explained, \u201cThink of it as your relationship with your Egos. But in our case, there will be more limitations. Don\u2019t worry; I can\u2019t control you.\u201dWith a wink, she added, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ll be the one at a disadvantage here. Besides, you aren\u2019t weak enough for me to completely control just with Marking.\u201dSoo-Jung\u2019s eyes and words held many meanings, but Tae-Gu agreed with her and stated, \u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth. Marking may sound scary, but it\u2019s not a powerful ability. She\u2019s only trying to share your pain from the penalty.\u201dGi-Gyu remained quiet despite Tae-Gu\u2019s reassurance until Lou said,-Don\u2019t worry. They are both telling you the truth.Finally, Gi-Gyu\u2019s face brightened a little. He didn\u2019t like \u201cbelonging\u201d to someone regardless of the consequences\u2019 magnitude. Nodding, he said to Soo-Jung, \u201cPlease inform me before using a skill like this.\u201d\u201cSure, sure, Your Highness.\u201d Soo-Jung smiled and added, \u201cBut there won\u2019t be a next time since you\u2019re becoming very strong, very fast.\u201d\u201c...\u201d When Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply. Soo-Jung chuckled. And finally, she began telling Gi-Gyu about the other world.***\u201cDammit,\u201d Tae-Shik muttered as he crushed the cigarette packet in his hand. The misery and guilt made him feel everything was his fault.\u2018Tae-Oh\u2026\u2019Tae-Shik met Tae-Oh when he was the head of the guide department. His priority had always been Gi-Gyu, but Tae-Shik also wanted to help Tae-Oh.Tae-Oh had an unfortunate childhood, turning him into a cold and untrusting player. However, Tae-Oh remained kind and loyal to those who truly cared for him. When he announced he was joining a guild, Tae-Shik found himself elated.\u2018Ahh\u2026 Why did it have to be the Caravan Guild?!\u2019Tae-Shik knew more secrets than most players on his level, but even he didn\u2019t know about the Caravan Guild. Although Asura had visited the other world, Tae-Shik never did. So, there were many secrets that Asura hadn\u2019t told his son.Tae-Shik learned a lot thanks to recent events. Demons lived and participated secretly in their world. He also learned about the masters of the other world and the rulers of the Tower.Had Tae-Shik known all this before, he would\u2019ve stopped Tae-Oh from entering a guild like that. So, he couldn\u2019t help feeling guilty.\u201cI need to become stronger,\u201d he muttered. He needed to become more powerful to follow his father and enter the other world. All the secrets would be revealed once he became strong enough.Also, he had to fully convert his potential into strength to inherit his father\u2019s position.Determination filled Tae-Shik\u2019s eyes as he promised, \u201cI will repay my debt to you,\u00a0Hyung.\u201dIt was the only way to protect and help Gi-Gyu: Tae-Shik\u2019s lifelong goal.\u201cFirstly, I need to get to Tae-Oh.\u201d He needed to find out more about the Caravan Guild to keep Gi-Gyu safe. For that, he had to first find Tae-Oh.***Gi-Gyu\u2019s brain hurt. He was already sharing the pain with Soo-Jung, yet it still felt too much. Gi-Gyu glanced at Soo-Jung and saw the sweat bullets on her forehead.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in concern. He no longer cared about Soo-Jung Marking him. The pain from the penalty tended to disable its victims from thinking. It was almost as if it was trying to erase the information the player shouldn\u2019t know by overwhelming them with pain.\u2018How the hell did I endure it the first time around?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu felt proud of himself for being able to finish listening to Old Man Hwang\u2019s story.Soo-Jung muttered, \u201cI remember this pain, but I still can\u2019t get used to it. I can\u2019t believe I have to suffer like this because I took in a stupid pupil.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d Tae-Gu gave her a bitter smile before adding, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree that Gi-Gyu is worth all of this trouble?\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose,\u201d Soo-Jung replied. The two players had a quiet conversation, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hear them due to the incredible pain.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. Now that the pain was slowly easing, he could finally remember the information he had received a moment ago.Shaking his head slowly, he murmured, \u201cSo there are different worlds in the back of the universe\u2026 And the Tower is like a wedge and a chain, a shortcut, to these worlds.\u201dHis skull still pounding, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cThe Tower is slowly\u00a0encroaching\u00a0on earth to connect it with the other world, right? And the gates are proof of this phenomenon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d replied Tae-Gu.\u201cAnd\u2026 The Tower\u2019s ruler, the Tower\u2019s creators, and the other world\u2019s rulers all live on the Tower\u2019s upper floors. Did I get that right?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu asked, both Soo-Jung and Tae-Gu nodded.\u201cThat other world\u2019s creatures can\u2019t use their real powers on earth until the takeover is complete. However, they can use their true powers in the Tower because it connects the two worlds. Haa\u2026 Talk about an information dump.\u201d Gi-Gyu looked at both Tae-Gu and Soo-Jung. Accepting their silent nods, he continued, \u201cOn the top floors of the Tower, these powerful beings can use 100 percent of their strengths, which is why they haven\u2019t been conquered yet by players.\u201dThe story Gi-Gyu just heard was hard to believe. Most people in the world, including Gi-Gyu up until a moment ago, believed the Tower was just a place to gain experience points, items, and crystals. It was like treasure storage to most. The public perceived the gates the same way; Tower floors with a chance of breaking.Now that Gi-Gyu knew the truth, he realized the Tower was the real threat to humans; the gates were just a symptom.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed again. Soo-Jung, who watched him quietly, said, \u201cLee Sun-Ho may be strong, but that\u2019s only on earth. He will be overwhelmed once he battles the lords of the Tower. However, it isn\u2019t a one-way street. Lee Sun-Ho can also easily defeat Tower creatures that enter the earth. Well, I guess this would depend on whom he fights.\u201dDespite detailed explanations, Gi-Gyu still found it hard to believe. Soo-Jung and Tae-Gu in front of him were so powerful that only a few in the world could fight them. One of these few was Lee Sun-Ho, but even Lee Sun-Ho was seemingly no match for those ruling the Tower.Feeling defeated, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cJust how powerful are they?\u201d He was quickly losing his will to fight this impossible war.Soo-Jung deactivated the Marking and leaned against the sofa. She looked exhausted as she replied, \u201cGodly.\u201dIn a calm voice, she continued, \u201cTo the non-players, they will look like gods.\u201dSoo-Jung sounded so matter-of-fact that Gi-Gyu knew it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93. Hwang Min-Su (2)\u2018So is becoming stronger pointless now?\u2019Gi-Gyu felt hopeless; it was as if someone had pushed him into a giant storm. This world was full of players who could never become half as strong as Tae-Gu or Soo-Jung, yet there existed creatures even more powerful than these two players. Could he ever defeat such entities?Gi-Gyu felt like he was drowning in deep, dark water.Slap!\u201cThere is no reason for you to be this scared,\u201d Soo-Jung consoled Gi-Gyu with a smack to his back. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t use her full force. Else, he would\u2019ve died on the spot.Soo-Jung calmly continued, \u201cMost beings in the Tower are trapped and sealed for now, and there is still plenty of time left until the invasion. We also took some measures to prevent them from leaving the Tower too easily, so don\u2019t worry about the end of the world just yet.\u201d\u2018Sealed?\u2019\u00a0One of Soo-Jung\u2019s words caught his attention.\u2018Sealed? Like El\u2026\u2018\u201cSealed away the demon!\u201d When Gi-Gyu suddenly shouted, Soo-Jung and Tae-Gu jumped and asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShaking his head quickly, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cN-no, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dIt was obvious to everyone that Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t sharing something with the class. Still, Soo-Jung shrugged and said, \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to tell us, that\u2019s fine.\u201dIt was one of the few things Gi-Gyu liked about powerful players: They didn\u2019t force him into revealing stuff he wasn\u2019t ready to share. Instead, they waited until he was ready.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cI will tell you about it later.\u201d He had already told Tae-Shik about it, but Soo-Jung and Tae-Gu didn\u2019t know how he obtained El. For some reason, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t want to talk about it just yet.Gi-Gyu changed the subject, \u201cSo, you mean the Caravan Guild is related to everything you told me and the door that leads to the Tower\u2019s basement?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cExactly, Young Man.\u201dSoo-Jung and Tae-Gu replied simultaneously. When Soo-Jung gestured toward Tae-Gu with her chin, indicating for him to explain the rest, Tae-Gu continued, \u201cThe Caravan Guild is certainly a problem, but\u2026 Andras is a much bigger issue.\u201d\u201cAndras,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu.\u00a0\u2018Even Lou felt resentment toward the name.\u2019Tae-Gu added with a voice full of disapproval, \u201cAndras is nicknamed the Marquis of Dissension.\u201d Soo-Jung and Tae-Gu frowned as Tae-Gu explained, \u201cHe\u2019s the worst demon that wants to free the Tower rulers. He wants to end our world.\u201d***After their meeting, Gi-Gyu returned home without Soo-Jung because she wanted to have a private chat with Tae-Gu.\u201cThe worst demon\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured, going over the earlier conversation. According to Tae-Gu, Andras was the worst demon not because he was the strongest but because he was the evilest. Andras was renowned as a lover of dissension and promoted violence and adultery. He was the incarnation of evil that dreamt of the world's end.\u201cSure sounds like the worst.\u201d When Gi-Gyu murmured, Lou replied with a frustrated sigh.-Yeah\u2026 There are annoying jerks; then there is Andras. Haa\u2026 He was born a jerk.-Even I have heard of his evil reputation, Master.Even the usually silent El chimed in.-Oh no! I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t know him\u2026 Hng.Brunheart sounded very disappointed that he couldn\u2019t join in the conversation. Finding Brunheart adorable, Gi-Gyu felt a little less tense.Working on the magic circle beside Gi-Gyu, Baal said quietly, \u201cAndras sits in the lower Seat of Power, yet he\u2019s famous for surviving this long.\u201d\"By the way\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu turned toward Baal\u2014\u201cwhat\u2019s \u2018Seat of Power\u2019?\u201d\u201c...?\u201d-...?Both Baal and Lou seemed shocked, confusing Gi-Gyu. He had never heard of \u201cSeat of Power\u201d before, so why did asking about it draw such reactions?Baal asked, \u201cOh, you really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cN-no.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied hesitantly, Baal raised his glasses as if troubled. He murmured, \u201cMy goodness. Didn\u2019t Lou\u2026 I mean, Master Lou, tell you anything about it?\u201d-I\u2019d forgotten all about Seat of Power. I remember it now, though. Seat of Power is a title\u2014a way to address high-level demons under demon kings. I\u2019m not talking about creatures like Soo-Jung, who isn\u2019t even a full-fledged demon. Just as there is a clear order among the demon kings, the high-level demon lords also have a unique order system with 72 seats called the Seat of Power. Demons with this title own territories, and the gates are examples of these territories. Oh, and do not assume that only demons have territories.While\u00a0Soo-Jung had a connection with his Egos, it was very limited. However, Baal could hear Lou clearly.\u00a0Baal agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and replied, \u201cI see.\u201d To his surprise, he gained new information and didn\u2019t suffer the penalty for it.Whir.The magic circle suddenly resonated. Baal watched it and explained, \u201cI think it will now produce crystals consistently.\u201dThanks to its newfound stability, numerous crystals appeared on the magic circle from the surplus energy. These crystals were then eaten by Brunheart\u2019s gate again.\"Creative economy!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed in pleasure. It was a slow process, but he now had an infinite cycle of energy and magic. The magic circle transformed the surplus and wasted energy into crystals, which Brunheart\u2019s gate ate and released surplus energy. Consequently, the gate was becoming stronger without losing a gram of energy.His face blank again, Baal replied, \u201cWell, I suppose your statement isn\u2019t wrong.\u201dBaal only showed human expressions while discussing the magic circle or other black magic stuff.\u2018Wait, he isn\u2019t human.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu almost forgot.\u201cLou was the emperor of all demons, so I guess he didn\u2019t have a Seat of Power.\u201d Being very curious about this mysterious demon, Gi-Gyu suddenly asked, \u201cThen what seat level do you hold, Baal?\u201dBaal was a demon lord, so he should also have had the title. With his usual blank face, Baal replied bluntly, \u201cI used to be\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a bitter and sad expression appeared on his face as he whispered, \u201cFirst Seat of Power.\u201d The fact that he had to use past tense pained\u00a0Baal.Lou ruthlessly muttered,-Idiot.***\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked in disappointment.\u201cI need to be away for a while. Why? Are you sad I\u2019m leaving? Will you miss me?\u201d Soo-Jung smiled teasingly and replied.\u201cN-no, it\u2019s n-not that.\u201d When Gi-Gyu stammered, Soo-Jung calmly promised, \u201cOnce I take care of it, I\u2019ll come back.\u201dDuring her private conversation with Tae-Gu, Tae-Gu ended up making a request to her. Soo-Jung decided to accept this mission since she was an association mercenary and the request lined up with her interests.\u2018The association employing Lucifer herself for a request? Sounds unbelievable.\u2019\u00a0On numerous occasions, the association\u2019s might had awed Gi-Gyu, so he wondered just how strong Lee Sun-Ho was to defy the association? What\u2019s more confusing was Lucifer and Baal being powerful enough to make direct deals with Lee Sun-Ho.\u2018What complicated relationships they must have with each other,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu wondered. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was peaceful only because these players\u2019 power was well-balanced. No matter how hard he tried, Gi-Gyu found untangling this web impossible.Just then, Soo-Jung suggested, \u201cI\u2019m going to say goodbye to your mother and Yoo-Jung. You\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, there is something I want to talk to Baal about,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. He could tell that Soo-Jung had gotten close to his family during her stay here. They have spent many days together, and it was nice to see different sides of her. Seeing the infamous Lucifer\u2019s humane side nearly made him question reality; it was akin to living with a celebrity.\u2018What the heck am I thinking?!\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu quickly shook his head, surprised by his thoughts. Soo-Jung was a dangerous figure\u2014Someone capable of ending their world. And her spending a few days with his family didn\u2019t change that.His mind told him not to get too attached, but the heart wants what it wants.\u2018It\u2019s hard not to want her as a friend.\u2019The darnedest thing happened somewhere along the way. He began looking forward to seeing her. Feeling a little embarrassed, he quickly changed the subject. \u201cUmm\u2026 Anyway, go say goodbye to my family.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s odd response confused Lucifer, but she remained silent and looked at him for a fleeting moment before climbing the stairs. On the other hand, Gi-Gyu went down to the basement and found Baal standing in the middle, concentrating on something.\u201c...\u201d Baal was probably very focused on his task because he didn\u2019t even acknowledge Gi-Gyu\u2019s arrival. Instead of interfering, Gi-Gyu decided to sit down on a chair nearby and wait. He knew how vital Baal\u2019s work was for Baal and him.Various bright and dark lights appeared from Baal, who controlled his magic to form and edit the content of the magic circle. Watching with interest, Gi-Gyu wondered, \u2018What level is Baal?\u2019Now that he thought about it, he realized he didn\u2019t know the level of any high ranker or above close to him. Gi-Gyu suddenly became very curious, but it wasn\u2019t the right time to ask such a question.\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu sighed silently. He was worried about what was to come in his future.\u2018Ironshield\u2026\u2019\u00a0He promised himself he would kill Ironshield for the nth time before realizing torture wouldn\u2019t be that bad an idea. Currently, Rogers was getting less than an hour of sleep every day and was forced to build the pyramid. Despite the constant whipping and starvation, Rogers didn\u2019t die because he was a player. After Nine took away his stats, leaving him a shell of his former self, he began resenting Ironshield. So, torturing Ironshield like Rogers Han could indeed be a splendid idea.\u2018After he finishes the pyramid, what should I make him build next? Eiffel Tower seems fun. Should I hire a talented architect for the next idea?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu chuckled, reveling in his fun revenge.\u2018Who knows? Rogers might come in handy in the future.\u2019Gi-Gyu looked down at his watch. He had been so deep in his thoughts that he didn\u2019t even notice how much time had passed. It was already dinner time, so he assumed Soo-Jung must be having dinner with his family. Gi-Gyu thought about joining them, but he decided to stay with Baal.Currently, Gi-Gyu\u2019s head was a little calm, free of its usual chatter. Brunheart was asleep after getting tired from their incessant chat earlier.\u2018Egos sleep too\u2026 How surprising.\u2019\u00a0As far as Gi-Gyu knew, El slept most of the day. The only one who didn\u2019t sleep was\u2026-It\u2019s definitely not because I slept for so long before. I\u2019m just superior.Lou explained. Lou had lived an eternity: A period so long that he had to erase his memory just to keep sane.When Gi-Gyu began to feel sad, Lou grumbled,-Don\u2019t be so pathetic.Gi-Gyu smiled.Suddenly, Baal greeted, \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dBaal had long been aware of Gi-Gyu\u2019s presence, but he still greeted Gi-Gyu out of respect.\u201cYes, I am.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Baal apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you wait for so long.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d Their conversation remained very formal. Despite their long time together, Gi-Gyu still found befriending Baal hard.-And there is no need for you to be his friend.Baal heard Lou\u2019s annoyed comment and smiled. Gi-Gyu knew Baal only smiled when his experiment was successful, so he asked, \u201cI guess it worked?\u201dGi-Gyu must have guessed right because Baal nodded. \u201cNine\u2019s corruption has been completed. It was already so close to being fully tainted that it wasn\u2019t hard to nudge it further. You shouldn\u2019t have any problem using it from now on.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded to show his appreciation. In a way, Nine was a gift Rogers Han gave him. Because it was a unique sword, neither Lou nor El could absorb it until now. But Gi-Gyu kept the sword because he knew its potential was endless. It was also vital in carrying out his next plan.For the last several days, Baal worked on fully corrupting Nine. When Gi-Gyu first obtained this sword, it was in an awkward state, so he decided to turn it into an evil sword since it was much easier.-But Master, you\u2019ve to maintain a balance. You cannot lean toward the darkness too much.\u201cI remember, El,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied and sheathed Nine before placing it inside the gate.Then, Gi-Gyu walked toward Baal. A stone coffin with damage all over stood before them.\u201cMin-Su,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he looked at the little boy. Old Man Hwang\u2019s grandson and Hwang Chae-Il\u2019s son, Hwang Min-Su, still laid inside the coffin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94. Hwang Min-Su (3)\u201cMin-Su,\u201d Gi-Gyu called the boy\u2019s name again. After the incident with Hwang Chae-Il and the Caravan Guild, Gi-Gyu handed the stone coffin to Baal. Hart had already tried to undo the magic and free Min-Su inside Brunheart\u2019s gate, but he failed. The best and the only expert in this field Gi-Gyu knew was Baal, so he asked Baal for help. Thankfully, Baal was happy to oblige.Looking down at the stone coffin, Baal explained, \u201cThe coffin was in a tricky state. Since the ritual was interrupted, most of the accumulated magic tied itself to the coffin.\u201d\u00a0Slowly raising his glasses, he continued, \u201cThis child is the doorkeeper\u2019s descendant; he is halfway through the awakening process for becoming the next doorkeeper.\u201d\u201cThen\u201d\u2014Gi-Gyu turned toward Baal\u2014\u201cwhat kind of changes should I expect?\u201dBaal shrugged and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c...?\u201d Gi-Gyu was surprised since \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d was something Baal seldom said.Concerned, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cIs there a chance that something dangerous might happen?\u201d Since Min-Su was halfway through the awakening process, Gi-Gyu wanted to prepare himself for what was to come.\u2018Wait\u2026 Will Min-Su even retain his personality, consciousness, and being after waking up? Will he lose control? What about\u2026\u2019\u00a0Suffice to say, Gi-Gyu\u2019s head was filled with questions.\u201cNot really. I can\u2019t imagine something dangerous happening,\u201d Baal replied.Gi-Gyu turned to look at Min-Su again. Honestly, there weren\u2019t many things he knew about the kid apart from that he was Old Man Hwang\u2019s grandson. The kid brought him to Old Man Hwang\u2019s shop; after that day, Gi-Gyu never spent time with him.But from now on, things would be different.\u2018Old Man Hwang said Min-Su will be an even greater blacksmith than him.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu remembered the elderly man\u2019s claim. Just what kind of talent did this boy had? And what were the abilities of a doorkeeper?Suddenly, Gi-Gyu smiled bitterly. Whatever the reason, Gi-Gyu had killed this boy\u2019s grandfather and father. And now, he was thinking about the ways he could use Min-Su.\u2018Is this why she said I have an evil nature?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu remembered what Lucifer told him.-Why are you so worried? You can\u2019t change what has happened so far. You just need to learn to deal with it and take responsibility.Lou advised nonchalantly and continued,-Contemplating like this isn\u2019t good for you.El and Brunheart joined the conversation.-I\u2019m afraid I must agree with Lou.-I don\u2019t care what anyone says, Master! I agree with you totally!Lou muttered in annoyance toward Brunheart,-Do you even know all the alphabet?\u00a0All you do is agree with him.Gi-Gyu burst into laughter as he listened to his Egos\u2019 banter. Baal, who had been quiet, finally announced, \u201cIt\u2019s time to wake him up.\u201dThey could\u2019ve woken Min-Su when they undid the stone coffin\u2019s magic, but Baal put a spell on the boy to keep him asleep until now. Gi-Gyu nodded in agreement and slowly walked up to Min-Su.It was finally time to wake up the child.***Baal said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cThe elixir brought you that one-year term.\u201dIn exchange for the elixir, Lee Sun-Ho gave Gi-Gyu a year's grace period. Gi-Gyu felt like it was an unfair deal on Soo-Jung\u2019s end, but it appeared that Soo-Jung and Baal disagreed with him. They both believed that one year was worth the priceless elixir.Watching Gi-Gyu\u2019s uncertain expression, Baal explained, \u201cWell, perhaps the one-year period might sound trivial, but you must admit that it will be useful. You know very well how precious the elixir is, so I assume you will spend this time wisely.\u201d\u201cI, of course, don\u2019t plan on wasting this time. I know I must become as strong as possible,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied as he scratched his cheek awkwardly.Baal nodded and announced, \u201cWe will be back soon.\u201d\u201cHave a safe trip,\u201d Gi-Gyu bid him farewell since Baal was also leaving with Soo-Jung. Their mission was to discover the truth about the Caravan Guild and find Andras, who was rumored to be on earth.Gi-Gyu was disappointed that he couldn\u2019t learn more about magic from Baal, but he knew what took priority at the moment. Thanks to Baal\u2019s stay in his home, he resolved the problems of Nine, Min-Su, and the wasted energy from Brunheart\u2019s gate. So, for now, Gi-Gyu had nothing pressing for Baal to help with.After their farewell, Baal left. Soo-Jung had already left earlier after her meal with Gi-Gyu\u2019s family. Gi-Gyu murmured, \u201cSoo-Jung seemed in quite a hurry to find Andras.\u201d\u2018Just how powerful is Andras that Soo-Jung had to hurry like this?\u2019\u00a0Finding Andras and the Caravan Guild was also vital to Gi-Gyu.\u2018I don\u2019t know why, but they took Old Man Hwang\u2019s weapons.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought, once again disappointed by the fact. All the pseudo-Egos, which Gi-Gyu needed desperately, Old Man Hwang stored in his workshop were stolen. This was one of the many important reasons they had to find the Caravan Guild.After seeing Baal off, Gi-Gyu walked back into his house. Soo-Jung and Baal hadn\u2019t stayed with him for a long time, but perhaps he had gotten closer to them than expected. The house felt a little empty without them.Clack.When Gi-Gyu opened the door to enter his house, he didn\u2019t immediately go downstairs to the basement. He walked into the living room, where a familiar voice asked, \u201cDid you say goodbye to Mr. Baal?\u201dGi-Gyu replied, \u201cYes, Mother.\u201d\u201cI wish he could\u2019ve stayed for dinner. I cooked something for Soo-Jung, but not for Mr. Baal. I feel a little guilty about that.\u201d When his mother commented from the kitchen, Gi-Gyu replied simply, \u201cThere is no need for you to feel bad. Please don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dBaal didn\u2019t eat, so he barely had any contact with Gi-Gyu\u2019s family.\u2018It\u2019s so funny that Mother calls him Mr. Baal.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but smile. Soo-Jung and Baal\u2019s stay had brightened his mother\u2019s demeanor. After the accident that left her bedridden, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother seldom left home. Even after the elixir cured her, she rarely left home; she only met and went out with Yoo-Jung and Tae-Shik. So, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother liked having Soo-Jung home.\u201cThanks to you, Gi-Gyu, our home has become so busy! I mean it in a good way.\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother commented as she hummed. Smiling, Gi-Gyu glanced at the kitchen. At the expensive dining table Tae-Shik bought for them, a small boy sat and asked Gi-Gyu, \u201cDaddy\u2026?\u201d\u201cMin-Su\u2026 I told you I\u2019m not your dad.\u201d Gi-Gyu protested weakly, but the little boy murmured again, \u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed as Min-Su insisted on calling him Dad.\u201cYoo-Jung!\u201d Su-Jin called for her daughter loudly.\u201cYes! Your Majesty! Did you need me?!\u201d Yoo-Jung, who had been watching TV in the living room, answered and quickly ran into the kitchen.\u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner. Go feed Bi first and come back.\u201d When Su-Jin asked, Yoo-Jung replied, \u201cOkay! Got it! Uwaah! Oppa! Long time no see!\u201d Yoo-Jung lightly playfully jabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s waist.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long, Yoo-Jung,\u201d grumbled Gi-Gyu.\u201cWill you be eating with us today?\u201d When Yoo-Jung asked, Gi-Gyu nodded and answered, \u201cYeah.\u201dShe teased with narrowed eyes, \u201cSo your love child finally taught you the importance of family?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered and tussled her hair. Yoo-Jung ran out to feed Bi with a grin. Gi-Gyu looked at Min-Su again and sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dAfter Min-Su woke up, he suffered amnesia: He had no memories of his grandfather, Old Man Hwang, or his father, Hwang Chae-Il. Because Gi-Gyu was the first person Min-Su saw, the boy followed him around and called him \u201cDad.\u201dIt was awkward at first, but since he could do nothing about it, he decided to let Min-Su stay with his family as Soo-Jung and Baal did. When Gi-Gyu first introduced Min-Su to his family, their reaction was memorable.\u201cI knew it, Oppa! This boy appeared right after Soo-Jung left, so\u2026\u201d Yoo-Jung whispered, insinuating Min-Su was Soo-Jung and Gi-Gyu\u2019s child.\u201cI\u2019m so happy to be a grandmother, Gi-Gyu. All of my dreams have come true now. I can now die without any regrets.\u201d Su-Jin had murmured with a grin.\u201cMom! What are you talking about? You need to see me get married and have my kids too! And besides, you aren\u2019t gonna die! You\u2019ll probably live longer than me!\u201d Yoo-Jung grumbled.Although Yoo-Jung and their mother joked, they didn\u2019t actually believe Min-Su was Gi-Gyu\u2019s son.\u00a0There was no resemblance whatsoever, and more importantly, Min-Su was way too old.\u201cDad? You need to eat too,\u201d Min-Su urged Gi-Gyu.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Min-Su. You can eat first.\u201d Gi-Gyu patted the boy\u2019s head affectionately. It looked like Min-Su\u2019s mental state had regressed a little, probably from the shock of what had happened. His vocabulary became limited, and he seemed dazed.\u2018The ritual will probably become the most traumatic part of his life.\u2019According to Baal, the effect of the failed ritual could have negatively impacted the boy.\u2018Min-Su probably also saw his father attack his grandfather\u2026\u2019Baal suggested that the brutal fight between the boy\u2019s father and grandfather must have also traumatized Min-Su. Baal guessed that the boy would recover in time, but Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling sad for him.When Yoo-Jung returned from feeding Bi, their meal began.\u201cMin-Su! Say ah\u2026\u201d When Yoo-Jung said, Min-Su obeyed, \u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cGood boy,\u201d Yoo-Jung replied as she fed him a spoonful of rice. Su-Jin was also at the table, eating while smiling at Min-Su.Whatever might have happened in the past, it didn\u2019t matter at the moment. Gi-Gyu enjoyed a peaceful meal with his family.***\u201cMin-Su, are you sure you\u2019ll be okay?\u201d Gi-Gyu looked at Min-Su with obvious worry.\u201cYup! I\u2019ll be fine, Dad!\u201d Min-Su smiled brightly and replied.Min-Su and Gi-Gyu were standing in the basement. Brunheart\u2019s gate was generating crystals atop Baal\u2019s magic circle in one corner. Besides it, Gi-Gyu had created a temporary workshop Min-Su asked for.\u2018Everything here is from Old Man Hwang\u2019s workshop.\u2019Min-Su\u2019s makeshift workshop was filled with the tools from his grandfather\u2019s workplace. These all now belonged to Min-Su as a family inheritance.\u201cHere.\u201d Gi-Gyu handed Min-Su a small hammer from his pocket. Gi-Gyu felt certain it also belonged to Min-Su; Old Man Hwang only gave Gi-Gyu this so that he could enter the barrier. He didn\u2019t know if this hammer might come in handy again in the future, but his instinct told him he should give it to Min-Su.\u201cUwaah\u2026\u201d Min-Su exclaimed in awe as he accepted the tool. Feeling curious, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhy? Do you see something inside?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty! It looks so nice!\u201d Min-Su looked at the small hammer happily. To Gi-Gyu, it was a strange-looking hammer, too small for actual work, but Min-Su saw something very different.\u201cHuhhh?\u201d Suddenly, Gi-Gyu shouted in shock. Even Lou seemed impressed as he murmured,-He\u2019s indeed Paimon\u2019s descendant\u2026 All weapons have blessed this boy.Min-Su yelled in excitement, \u201cUwaah! It\u2019s bigger now! It grew!\u201dOnce the hammer reached Min-Su\u2019s hand, it grew just big enough to fit the boy\u2019s hand perfectly.\u201cI guess it was an item too,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. He assumed it was just an unusual tool because he couldn\u2019t bring up its status screen.\u00a0But now that he thought about it, the hammer had to be an item influenced by the Tower\u2019s system. Gi-Gyu suspected that it was a magic item that could be recognized by only those worthy enough to see its true potential.Impressed, Gi-Gyu watched Min-Su.\u201cHuh?\u201d Gi-Gyu whispered as Min-Su walked toward the stone coffin, acting like a crow seduced by a sparkling jewel, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t stop him.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t throw away the stone coffin due to its powerful energy. There was no way of knowing what kind of magic this item held inside. The stone coffin had remained a mystery to Gi-Gyu, so he felt strangely ecstatic when Min-Su approached it.Lou ordered,-Watch carefully. You\u2019re about to witness the secret to Old Man Hwang\u2019s method.\u201cWhat?\u201d-That boy is Paimon\u2019s descendant. I don\u2019t know the exact details, but I\u2019m certain that the old man also had a connection with Paimon. Paimon, master of the high Seat of Power, is the keeper that protects the door to hell.Clank!Suddenly, a clear metallic sound rang inside the basement. When Gi-Gyu turned toward the sound, he saw Min-Su banging on the stone coffin with his new hammer. Even though the metal hammer hit the stone surface, it generated a clear metallic sound.Lou laughed and continued.-And he is also the greatest blacksmith of hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95. Hwang Min-Su (4)For several days, a constant hammering sound rang in Gi-Gyu\u2019s basement. Thanks to the soundproof barrier, his mother and sister didn\u2019t hear it from upstairs; unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t avoid the incessant noise with his sensitive player ears.Clang!Gi-Gyu quickly became sick of the continuous bangs and clangs and went to the basement. Min-Su was sculpting something out of the stone coffin; the boy honestly had terrific stamina and power as he kept hammering the coffin day in, day out.\u2018Isn\u2019t sculpting done with a hammer and a chisel?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought in confusion. Surprisingly, Min-Su managed to shape the coffin using just the hammer, making Gi-Gyu doubt his knowledge. However, he soon realized that Min-Su was just unique.Gi-Gyu watched as Min-Su split the stone coffin in half, shaping it delicately without a chisel. Watching Min-Su work was like watching a magic show: Every time he brought down the hammer, the coffin broke exactly how and where he wanted.-It\u2019s because he\u2019s Paimon\u2019s descendant.When Lou explained, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSounds like you were fond of Paimon?\u201dUsually, when Lou talked about the other demons, including Baal, Gi-Gyu could tell Lou didn\u2019t like them. However, Lou seemingly had a sort of affection toward Paimon.-He was one of the few demons that didn\u2019t betray me.\u201cHmm.\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t reply since he could hear the longing for his old life in Lou\u2019s voice.Clang!The hammer went down again, and Gi-Gyu continued watching Min-Su work.***\u201cI might end up being arrested for child abuse,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered. Indeed, if someone saw Min-Su right now, Gi-Gyu would be reported to the police for possible child abuse. Currently, Min-Su was sleeping on Gi-Gyu\u2019s lap; the week-long hammering had given him blisters and mild fever.Gi-Gyu tried his best to stop the boy, but Min-Su refused to take a break. The kid had actually created a weak barrier around him to gently push Gi-Gyu away. Realizing this was what Min-Su needed and wanted, Gi-Gyu stayed away.The result was Min-Su sleeping with uneven breathing on Gi-Gyu\u2019s lap.\u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve tried harder to stop him,\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered, feeling guilty. Admittedly, a part of why he didn\u2019t try harder was selfishness. He remembered what Old Man Hwang told him before his death and wanted to see if it was true.\u201cMin-Su will become a blacksmith much more powerful than me.\u201dHe felt apologetic for his selfishness, but when he turned toward Min-Su\u2019s work, it reminded him he had made the right choice. Studying the coffin's new shape in awe, Gi-Gyu whispered, \u201cIt was all meant to be.\u201dJust as Old Man Hwang claimed, Min-Su had a great potential to be an excellent blacksmith. One may wonder how being a good sculptor translated to becoming a good blacksmith, but Gi-Gyu knew better. The stone coffin barely took any damage from the giant magic explosion back then, but Min-Su shaped it into something utterly different. What was it if not raw talent?\u201cI wonder if potions would work on him.\u201d Gi-Gyu reached toward Brunheart\u2019s gate, and a skeleton walked out and handed him several potion bottles politely. Needless to say, Gi-Gyu was now using his gate as a bag.\u201cThanks, Hart,\u201d When Gi-Gyu thanked the lich, the monster replied.-I am always at your command\u2026 Grandmaster\u2026Gi-Gyu closed the gate and picked up the potion. Min-Su\u2019s aura was utterly different from players, so he knew Min-Su wasn\u2019t a player for certain. However, Min-Su entered the Tower, a place only players could enter, and sculpted the stone coffin. So, he knew it was worth a try.Shwaaa...After Min-Su gulped a few drops, his face became less pale. Encouraged, Gi-Gyu poured the same potion on Min-Su\u2019s damaged hands.\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d The potion was visibly healing Min-Su.\u201cMmm\u2026 Dad?\u201d Min-Su slowly opened his eyes and mumbled.\u201cAre you awake, Min-Su?\u201d\u201cYe\u2026 yeah,\u201d Min-Su replied weakly.\u201cYou must be hungry, huh?\u201d\u201cUhm,\u201d When Min-Su murmured, Gi-Gyu promised, \u201cLet\u2019s just finish this part, and we\u2019ll get you some food.\u201dThe potions relieved Min-Su\u2019s fatigue, so he remained awake. Patting the boy\u2019s head, Gi-Gyu lifted Min-Su. Since the little boy worked so hard for him, it was now time for him to reward Gi-Gyu.\u201cIn what order should I go about this?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured as he walked toward the sculpture. The sculpture was glowing brightly, gleaming on Gi-Gyu\u2019s face.When Gi-Gyu stood in front of it, Min-Su asked weakly, \u201cDad\u2026 What are you going to do with it?\u201dWith a smile, Gi-Gyu raised his hand to summon the status screen. He announced, \u201cCombination. Hwang Ji-Chul\u2019s fragment. Ego fragment.\u201dOld Man Hwang\u2019s real name was Hwang Ji-Chul. The sub-material Gi-Gyu chose for the Combination was an Ego fragment. Old Man Hwang\u2019s egofication failed back then, but\u2026\u201cI know it won\u2019t be perfect, but close to perfect is possible,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with hope. After spending hours studying this process with Baal, they come up with the best possible solution.Golden pieces appeared from Lou and Gi-Gyu and mixed into one in midair. Watching this process intently, Gi-Gyu ordered, \u201cNine!\u201dA skeleton soldier exited Brunheart\u2019s gate and handed Gi-Gyu a sword glowing in dark and murky green light. While the golden pieces of light mixed, there was something Nine needed to do.Now in his sword form, Lou clashed into Nine, followed by a system announcement.[Hwang Ji-Chul\u2019s fragment is being accepted by Nine.]Then, Lou let Nine absorb his stats despite being capable of absorbing Nine itself. It was a controlled process; once Nine had absorbed a bit of Lou\u2019s stats, Gi-Gyu stabbed it into the giant golden light storm.\u201cUgh.\u201d Gi-Gyu groaned from the pressure. The energy Nine absorbed left the sword and was absorbed into the mixture of golden lights.Admiring, Min-Su murmured, \u201cIt looks so pretty.\u201dThe unexpected strain this process put on Gi-Gyu made him sweat bullets; however, it was just a beautiful scene with firefly-like particles and intense lights to Min-Su.Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t tell how much time had passed when he heard the sudden system announcements.[Combination was a success.][Hwang Ji-Chul\u2019s fragment has transformed into Ego Hwang Ji-Chul.]\u201cIt worked.\u201d Finally, his day-long discussions yielded successful results: He succeeded in turning a fragment into an Ego.***Gi-Gyu wanted to stay and complete the rest of the process, but he couldn\u2019t because of Min-Su. The potions healed the boy physically, but it wasn\u2019t enough to treat Min-Su\u2019s psyche. Min-Su collapsed after watching the beautiful mix of lights for a few minutes.When Gi-Gyu brought Min-Su upstairs, Yoo-Jung glared at him and accused, \u201cOppa, what have you done?!\u201d Gi-Gyu only scratched his head awkwardly, failing to find an excuse.While Min-Su slept soundly in Gi-Gyu\u2019s bed, Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother suggested, \u201cHow about we give Min-Su a room?\u201dWhen Gi-Gyu first introduced Min-Su to his mother, he briefly explained the boy\u2019s situation. He told his mother that Min-Su had lost his family, and because he knew the boy\u2019s grandfather, he decided to take care of the now orphaned child.They had plenty of rooms in their spacious home, but Gi-Gyu shook his head after hearing his mother\u2019s suggestion. \u201cNot yet. I want to observe his situation for a bit longer, Mother.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re waiting for, but please don\u2019t take too long. Even a child needs his own space,\u201d Su-Jin said with a nod.\u201cAll right.\u201d Gi-Gyu had already thought of giving Min-Su a room; for now, he needed more time to think.\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d When Min-Su moaned, Su-Jin patted his head and asked, \u201cOh, are you awake, Min-Su?\u201d\u201cGrandma?\u201d\u201cHahaha,\u201d Su-Jin chuckled.Grumble.Hearing Min-Su\u2019s stomach growl, Su-Jin quickly stood up and announced, \u201cLet\u2019s get some food into you. How could you stop eating for a week, silly boy?\u201dYoo-Jung glared at Gi-Gyu, who sighed, \u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThere were believable excuses; then there were facts that sounded like excuses.\u00a0Gi-Gyu knew no one would believe Min-Su stopped eating of his own violation, let alone his family.***Tae-Shik clenched his fists; his palm bled as his nails dug into his flesh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d\u201cKim Tae-Oh\u2019s family was starving to death, and they didn\u2019t know where Kim Tae-Oh was either.\u201d Sung-Hoon\u2019s face was filled with rage as he reported to Tae-Shik.While investigating Kim Tae-Oh\u2019s whereabouts, Sung-Hoon learned about his family\u2019s situation: They were in dire straits after Kim Tae-Oh joined the Caravan Guild.Tae-Oh\u2019s family situation was similar to Gi-Gyu\u2019s old life: A family of three with an unwell mother and a younger sibling. His family had been waiting for Kim Tae-Oh\u2019s return all this time. They were living their last days; thankfully, the association found them.\u201cAll right\u2026 Just help them get on their feet,\u201d Tae-Shik ordered bitterly. The guilt was crushing him.\u201cOf course,\u201d Sung-Hoon replied with a nod and left the room.After learning about Andras, Tae-Shik knew this demon brainwashed Caravan players never to leave the guild. Consequently, all Caravan players suddenly disappeared, abandoning their families. The families of financially stable players survived, but families like Tae-Oh\u2019s waited for their loved ones till death.A crimson flash of anger appeared in Tae-Shik\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou better not underestimate us humans.\u201dTheir hunt for the Caravan Guild had just begun. Lucifer and Baal were out hunting, which meant Tae-Shik could no longer stay idle. It was time for him to make his move as well.***After Min-Su recovered, he returned to the basement. Of course, Gi-Gyu went with him.Min-Su asked, \u201cDad, what will you do today? Will I get to see the pretty lights again?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think it will be pretty, but you\u2019ll see something important,\u201d Gi-Gyu patted Min-Su\u2019s head and replied. Due to the stone sculpture\u2019s shape, he was certain Min-Su would be ecstatic to see what was about to come.\u2018I guess Min-Su\u2019s subconscious made him shape the sculpture after his grandfather.\u2019When Gi-Gyu first saw the final result, he couldn\u2019t hide his shock. The stone coffin had transformed into a sculpture that looked exactly like Old Man Hwang. It looked like a younger and stronger version, but there was no mistake that it was Hwang Ji-Chul in a stone form. It shone with golden light, looking otherworldly.Gi-Gyu said to Min-Su, \u201cYou really are an incredible blacksmith.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dGi-Gyu still couldn\u2019t believe how a sculpture, not a weapon, could shine like an Ego. Old Man Hwang alluded that Min-Su would be Gi-Gyu\u2019s greatest asset; now, it was time for him to give the little boy a gift.Gi-Gyu placed his hand on the sculpture\u2019s chest and announced, \u201cSync.\u201dBased on Baal\u2019s calculation, Gi-Gyu\u2019s shell could still accept a few more Egos.[You have successfully synced.]The sculpture wasn\u2019t a full-fledged Ego; it was just a fragment. With how far Gi-Gyu had come, no Ego fragment would refuse to sync with him. A bright light appeared along with the status screen, but Gi-Gyu dismissed it and shouted, \u201cGrant!\u201dHe selected Hwang Ji-Chul as the Ego\u2026The man known as Old Man Hwang\u2026The greatest blacksmith Gi-Gyu knew.Fwooosh!The blacksmith\u2019s Ego entered the sculpture with a blinding flash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96. Hwang Min-Su (5)When the golden lights combined into one and entered the sculpture, it began vibrating softly.Bzzz\u2026The vibrations were so soft that only a player could sense them; since Min-Su didn\u2019t have heightened senses, he didn\u2019t notice it. Gi-Gyu patted the boy\u2019s head and continued to watch the sculpture.[Grant was successful.]Gi-Gyu\u2019s face brightened after hearing the system announcement. He had used Grant two times, Bi and Old Man Hwang, and got desirable results both times. But what happened next confused him.[You\u2019ve successfully created a guardian.][Please designate the guardian area.]\u201cHuh?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured when he heard the system announcements. It was his first time hearing the term, so he was surprised. Old Man Hwang\u2019s sculpture refused to budge; instead, a giant map appeared in front of his eyes.\u201cWow!\u201d Gi-Gyu exclaimed at the impressive sight. It was the map of the area his house was in.\u201cIs this a Mana Map?\u201d he murmured out loud. Mana Map was a skill some support category players possessed. By spreading their magic in their surroundings, they could form a map, so Gi-Gyu suspected the map before him was something similar.[Designating a small guardian area would increase defense level.][Designating a large guardian area would decrease defense level.]Gi-Gyu nodded in understanding after hearing the system\u2019s kind reminder. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t designate the gate as the guardian area.\u201dNeedless to say, the guardian\u00a0area was the area a guardian was assigned to protect.\u201cI have no plans to move anyway, so this should be fine,\u201d Gi-Gyu decided. He had already planned some things for his home and the surrounding area, so he was happy to stay in his current home. That was also why he had renovated the basement as his training area.At first, Gi-Gyu thought about assigning Brunheart\u2019s gate as the guardian area, but he changed his mind. Raising his hand, he announced, \u201cOur house. Perimeter 500 meters.\u201d[The guardian area has been set.]After Gi-Gyu selected the area on the map, he heard the system\u2019s confirmation.[The guardian is being awakened.]After the last announcement, Old Man Hwang\u2019s statue lit up in multicolored lights. They weren\u2019t simply colors\u2014they were shades of human pigmentation.\u201cUwaaah!\u201d Min-Su exclaimed without making any comment. Gi-Gyu did the same as he watched the amazing scene unfold. Incredulously, Old Man Hwang\u2019s sculpture soon transformed into the real Old Man Hwang.Opening his eyes, the elderly man stammered, \u201cY-you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cAre you Old Man Hwang, Sir?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked cautiously, his voice trembling. The being before him was a mix-mash of Ego fragments, so there was no way of telling if it was the same Old Man Hwang. Also, it was Gi-Gyu's first time syncing with a human Ego, so he had no idea what the final result was supposed to look like.\u201cI\u2026I am\u2026\u201d Old Man Hwang studied his hands in dismay as he replied. Then, he slowly looked toward the boy and murmured, \u201cMin-Su\u2026?\u201d\u201cG-Grandpa?\u201dThe elderly man and the boy stared at each other.***\u201cThank you\u2026 Thank you so much. I had no idea this was possible.\u201d Old Man Hwang showed his gratitude; Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cThe chances of this working weren\u2019t high, but we lucked out.\u201dGi-Gyu continued, \u201cOriginally, I wanted to do something like this much later, but\u2026\u201dWatching the asleep Min-Su in Old Man Hwang\u2019s arms, Gi-Gyu commented, \u201cJust as you said, Min-Su is extremely talented. It was all thanks to Min-Su that I could make this attempt.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough, Young Man,\u201d Old Man Hwang murmured as he looked down at his grandson.Except for his younger look, Old Man Hwan\u2019s stone form looked every bit like the old blacksmith. Despite being a stone sculpture, he looked as human as the next guy; no one could deny it was the same blacksmith who died not too long ago.Lou warned Gi-Gyu,-You better hide this. No one can know that you can do this.\u2018I know.\u2019What Gi-Gyu had just done now was essentially resurrection. He had revived a dead person perfectly\u2026 Well, it actually wasn\u2019t a perfect resurrection, but it was close enough. Pandemonium would erupt in the world if others discovered that he could grant a dead person\u2019s memories and abilities to a new body.But, there was one problem.\u2018I don\u2019t think I can repeat this,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought, disappointed. Looking at the worn Nine lying in a corner, Gi-Gyu realized he couldn\u2019t use Grant like this again. Something died or was exhausted inside Nine when it\u00a0absorbed Old Man Hwang\u2019s fragment from Lou.-I believe resurrecting a human by egofication requires the use of life force.When Lou commented, Gi-Gyu asked silently, \u2018Life force?\u2019-All holy swords hold life force; from the looks of it, resurrecting a human consumes this force. It\u2019s different from how the monsters and demons regenerate.Gi-Gyu also believed that something was consumed when he resurrected Old Man Hwang. Consequently, he couldn\u2019t repeat this feat unless he had a holy sword or a life force source.\u2018Maybe it won\u2019t be possible to help Hwang Chae-Il after all.\u2019Gi-Gyu looked back and forth between Old Man Hwang and Min-Su. He wondered if he should break the news that he couldn\u2019t reunite their family anytime soon.Studying Nine with his sharp blacksmith\u2019s eyes, Old Man Hwang asked, \u201cSo is this a holy sword?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s now an evil sword, but it was once a holy sword.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, the elderly man muttered, \u201cI can see that the sword is no longer alive.\u201dOld Man Hwang contemplated and asked, \u201cMay I use it?\u201d He asked to use it as a blacksmith, not a swordsman.\u201cOf course, but be very careful with it. For now, Nine obeys me, but I don\u2019t know how it will react if you try to use it,\u201d warned Gi-Gyu.\u201cHaha.\u201d Old Man Hwang laughed and replied, \u201cThere is no need for you to worry. Can\u2019t you feel it? I now belong to you as well.\u201dOld Man Hwang looked a little bitter, but in a cool, accepting voice, he added, \u201cSince this sword also belongs to you, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded and stated, \u201cBut still, please remember to be careful. By the way, there is something more important we must discuss.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWe need to decide where you\u2019ll live,\u201d Gi-Gyu explained. Now that Old Man Hwang had returned, he couldn\u2019t just stay with Gi-Gyu\u2018s family since it would be awkward for all. Thankfully, Gi-Gyu had been planning for this day and offered his plan.***Clang, clang, clang!Loud construction noise from the plot next to Gi-Gyu\u2019s house rang throughout the neighborhood.Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother said with interest, \u201cI guess we\u2019re getting a new neighbor.\u201dThe area near Bukhan River where Gi-Gyu lived was nice, yet Gi-Gyu\u2018s family didn\u2019t have any neighbors. They lived in a detached home; there were many other houses nearby, but all of them were empty.When Yoo-Jung saw Gi-Gyu smile mysteriously, she asked, \u201cOppa, why are you making that face?\u201dThe truth was, Gi-Gyu had purchased all the land and the houses around his home. Since he now had more money than he could ever spend, he easily bought the entire neighborhood. He had been planning this for a long time, and he was happy that everything was going well. Of course, his family had no idea Gi-Gyu owned everything around their house.Gi-Gyu hired a construction company and asked them to quickly build a livable dwelling. \u00a0They completed his request in just four days. This was what Old Man Hwang had asked from Gi-Gyu.\u2018Old Man Hwang said he\u2019ll take care of the details himself,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought as he remembered the twinkle in the elderly man\u2019s eyes.\u00a0The blacksmith was excited to be building his home the way he wanted.\u2018It\u2019s understandable since he was stuck in that tiny workshop before.\u2019\u00a0There had to be a good reason why Old Man Hwang stayed in that small workshop; now that the elderly man was back, Gi-Gyu was eager to hear the reason.Gi-Gyu looked out the window and saw the newly-built three-story building next door.Ding-dong!Their doorbell seldom came into use, so Su-Jin wondered, \u201cWho could that be?\u201dBoth Gi-Gyu and his mother looked at the intercom screen. When Gi-Gyu saw the familiar face, he smiled brightly. Meanwhile, his mother seemed confused as she murmured, \u201cHmm?\u201dStill smiling, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cI better go out to greet him.\u201dConfused, Yoo-Jung asked, \u201cWhy? Who is it? Is it Tae-Shik oppa? Or did Soo-Jung unnie come back?\u201dGi-Gyu turned off the intercom screen and opened the door. Min-Su ran inside and yelled, \u201cNoona[1]!\u201d\u201cMin-Su?! What\u2019s going on? Did you move next door?\u201d When Yoo-Jung asked, Gi-Gyu crossed his arms casually and explained, \u201cYeah. I contacted Min-Su\u2019s grandfather, and they moved into our neighborhood.\u201d\u201cNoona! Hyung!\u201d Min-Su dashed toward Yoo-Jung and Gi-Gyu.\u2018His memories must\u2019ve returned.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought in relief. After Old Man Hwang returned, much of Min-Su\u2019s memories returned. Thanks to that, he recognized Old Man Hwang as his grandfather and Gi-Gyu as \u201cHyung.\u201d Unfortunately, Min-Su still didn\u2019t remember his father.\u201cHyung! Hyung! I can visit you often, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Gi-Gyu liked how Min-Su treated him more familiarly and patted the boy\u2019s head. Then, Old Man Hwang walked in with Su-Jin. Gi-Gyu\u2019s mother announced, \u201cHahaha. This gentleman brought us rice cakes.\u201dGi-Gyu saw a plate of sirutteok[2]\u00a0in his mother\u2019s hand. Nowadays, rice cakes as gifts were a rarity, but Old Man Hwang was an old-fashioned man. Suddenly, the elderly man winked at Gi-Gyu, surprising him.\u2018I had no idea there was this side to Old Man Hwang.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu had only seen the blacksmith's blunt and rough side until now. Perhaps the resurrection changed the elderly man in many ways.Old Man Hwang thanked Su-Jin, \u201cI wanted to show my appreciation to you for taking care of my Min-Su while I was away.\u201d\u201cNot at all. Min-Su is such a polite and bright young man. I was so impressed. Min-Su used to call Gi-Gyu his dad, and I\u2019ve wished Min-Su was really my grandson ever since,\u201d Su-Jin replied with a kind smile.While Su-Jin and Old Man Hwang chatted, Min-Su and Yoo-Jung went outside to play with Bi. Watching them having a good time, Gi-Gyu thought, \u2018I\u2019m definitely not wasting the time given to me.\u2019It might seem like he was wasting his grace period, but he was actually building a foundation that would make him much stronger.Gi-Gyu\u2019s family knew that Old Man Hwang and Gi-Gyu had a special relationship.\u201cI would like to talk with Gi-Gyu privately if that\u2019s okay.\u201d When the blacksmith asked politely, Su-Jin replied, \u201cOf course.\u201dThen, Old Man Hwang and Gi-Gyu headed downstairs to the basement. When they were out of everyone\u2019s earshot, Gi-Gyu announced, \u201cWhen Baal returns, I will connect this basement to your home, Sir.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Suddenly, Old Man Hwang grabbed Gi-Gyu\u2019s hand and explained, \u201cI am still stuck being a guardian, but my life is much more relaxed now compared to before.\u201d\u201cStuck being a guardian?\u201d When Gi-Gyu asked, the elderly man found a seat for himself and replied, \u201cI suppose I haven\u2019t told you why I stayed in that tiny workshop. It\u2019s because I was assigned to protect something there.\u201d\u201c...!\u201d Finally, the mystery of Old Man Hwang\u2019s workshop was about to be revealed. He had his suspensions ever since he heard the system announcement while using Grant. He now understood Old Man Hwang\u2019s abilities as a blacksmith and as a guardian. But Gi-Gyu knew it would be beneficial to hear the details directly from the blacksmith.Old Man Hwang explained, \u201cAfter I met my wife in the other world, we had Chae-Il. When we returned to earth, my wife stole something from her people. Ah! Don\u2019t worry.\u201d He grinned before continuing, \u201cWhat she took rightfully belonged to her\u2014her inheritance. Still, we were exiled from that place.\u201dOld Man Hwang's sneaky smile definitely came across as strange, but the story was so interesting that Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhat was it that she took?\u201dThe inheritance Old Man Hwang\u2019s wife stole was probably what he had to protect inside the cramped workshop. Gi-Gyu was curious about what it was.Suddenly, a tense expression appeared on Old Man Hwang\u2019s face. The playful demeanor disappeared, and the blacksmith looked very serious as he replied, \u201cPaimon is the greatest blacksmith. All blacksmiths worship him as their god.\u201dOld Man Hwang\u2019s stubborn side, which Gi-Gyu was used to, returned in full force. The elderly man added, \u201cI was protecting the Paimon\u2019s legacy,\u201d with a loud gulp.1. Noona is a term used by a younger brother or a younger male to address an older sister or an older female.\u00a0\u261c2. Sirutteok is a type of rice cake.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97. Hwang Min-Su (6)\u201cPaimon\u2019s legacy?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked. Lou suddenly took the lead and answered before Old Man Hwang.-Paimon\u2019s legacy\u2026 It has to be some great treasure to need such secrecy.Old Man Hwang replied to Lou,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s everything. Including himself.\u201dSince Old Man Hwang was now Gi-Gyu\u2019s Ego, he could hear Lou. What surprised Gi-Gyu was the respectful tone Old Man Hwang used toward Lou.Confused, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018including himself?\u2019\u201d\u201cExactly what it sounds like. The legacy includes Paimon himself.\u201d-Ridiculous.Lou smirked in disbelief. Gi-Gyu wanted to hear the details, but Old Man Hwang didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Now that the blacksmith was his Ego, Gi-Gyu could\u2019ve forced him, but he didn\u2019t want to do that to a friend.Trying not to prod, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cSo what happened to the legacy?\u201dGi-Gyu knew the Caravan Guild and Hwang Chae-Il attacked Old Man Hwang and stole all the pseudo-Egos in his workshop. Did that mean they also\u2026\u201cThey took it. They were after Paimon\u2019s legacy and Min-Su from the beginning.\u201d Gi-Gyu\u2019s guess was correct, but he didn\u2019t feel happy. As far as Gi-Gyu could tell, the Caravan Guild was a powerful group, so nothing good could come out of them obtaining such a powerful item.\u201cI guess we now have another reason to capture the Caravan Guild quickly,\u201d murmured Gi-Gyu. He couldn\u2019t even guess what the high demon\u2019s legacy was, but he knew it could help him greatly. After all, Paimon was considered the god of blacksmiths.Old Man Hwang replied, \u201cIndeed. We must find it and get it back. Besides, only the legitimate heir can use the legacy.\u201d\u201cYou mean Min-Su?\u201d\u201cYes, either Min-Su or\u2026\u201d Old Man Hwang\u2019s face turned bitter as he added, \u201cMy son.\u201d\u201cHwang Chae-Il?\u201d\u201cYes. Since you rescued Min-Su, I assumed you\u2019ve met my son?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu. A complicated expression appeared on the elderly man\u2019s face when he heard that.\u201cYour son\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu tried to bring up the topic cautiously, but Old Man Hwang shook his head and stopped him. The blacksmith requested, \u201cPlease do not mention my son. I need more time to think. You know, I\u2019d always known about his ambitions, but I never expected him to sacrifice his father and son for them.\u201dOld Man Hwang seemed to have misunderstood the situation, so Gi-Gyu quickly explained, \u201cNo, your son was brainwashed.\u201d\u201cI know. However, his manipulated persona was just a magnification of his hidden desires. I am well aware of what Andras can do,\u201d replied Old Man Hwang. The blacksmith knew more about the situation than Gi-Gyu expected.Old Man Hwang added, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later. I know you must have many questions, but please be patient. I am still reeling from the shock of it all.\u201dThe elderly man looked miserable, so Gi-Gyu also didn\u2019t feel like talking about it. Since he couldn\u2019t revive Hwang Chae-Il anytime soon, he nodded and decided he would discuss it later.***Gi-Gyu resumed climbing the Tower. Iron Guild had made no noise, and the Caravan Guild's pursuit was still ongoing under professionals. For now, the best thing Gi-Gyu could do was climb the Tower and become more powerful.\u2018I must reach the 50th floor,\u2019\u00a0he thought in determination.The 50th floor was his current priority, but that didn\u2019t mean he stopped nourishing Lou with the floor monsters\u2019 blood. Thankfully, this process didn\u2019t slow Gi-Gyu down. His monster-massacring speed increased as he went up since Lou grew stronger on each floor.These days, Gi-Gyu spent much of his time in the Tower, hunting, and he would return home to his basement once he was satisfied.Clank!A loud hammering sound rang inside the basement. Gi-Gyu had already informed his family that Old Man Hwang was a player and that he was here to help protect him. It wasn\u2019t the complete truth; it was better than a lie. Gi-Gyu\u2019s family was only happy to have Old Man Hwang and Min-Su frequent their home.\u201cMin-Su, you must listen to the metal when it speaks to you,\u201d Old Man Hwang taught Min-Su patiently.\u201cIt wants me to hit it lightly.\u201d When Min-Su replied, Old Man Hwang suggested, \u201cAll right. Then you should do what it wants.\u201dGi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help laughing as he watched the grandfather-grandson duo working. Gi-Gyu had never seen Old Man Hwang smithing before and had assumed it was no different from others. Recently, he had realized he was utterly mistaken.He didn\u2019t know much about blacksmiths or how they worked, but he believed they at least needed a forge or some other heat source. However, Old Man Hwang didn\u2019t have a forge in his old workshop or here, in Gi-Gyu\u2019s basement.Blaze!Gi-Gyu suddenly heard blazing fire; astonishingly, the fire came from Old Man Hwang\u2019s mouth.Gi-Gyu became speechless. Another thing he found odd was the metal\u2019s request to be struck lightly. Was this some new fetish he was unaware of? Also, why were Old Man Hwang And Min-Su happy to oblige?-Paimon did employ strange methods. The old man is indeed his legitimate heir.Gi-Gyu wanted to question Lou, but he decided against it and continued to spectate the smithing process.Gi-Gyu\u2019s spacious basement was currently divided into three areas: The sparring hall, the magic circle area, and Old Man Hwang and Min-Su\u2019s workshop. Min-Su used half of the stone coffin to make Old Man Hwang\u2019s sculpture, and the remaining half sat in the basement workshop's corner.Clank!The hammering continued to echo throughout the basement. This time, Min-Su was doing it alone without Old Man Hwang\u2019s help. The elderly man approached Gi-Gyu and greeted, \u201cHello there.\u201d\u201cHello, Sir. How\u2019s Min-Su doing?\u201d Gi-Gyu asked politely. Min-Su had begun learning blacksmithing from his grandfather. Min-Su\u2019s talent had surpassed Old Man Hwang\u2019s skills as he created that sculpture without any help. However, Min-Su lacked basic skills and experience, so Old Man Hwang focused on them.\u201cHe has always been a much more talented blacksmith than me. All I\u2019m doing right now is assisting him. It almost feels like I\u2019ve become his apprentice. I\u2019m actually learning more by teaching Min-Su.\u201d Old Man Hwang was very genuine with his words, proving his love for Min-Su and pride as a craftsman.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with a nod. Old Man Hwang becoming even more skilled was good for everyone.The blacksmith replied, \u201cBut it will take us longer to create the weapons you want, Young Man. Those items were created using Paimon\u2019s legacy after all.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded again. He understood that even a good artisan couldn\u2019t create excellence without appropriate materials, experience, and luck.\u201cBut there is no doubt that Min-Su has true talent. After all, Min-Su created your body.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, it was Old Man Hwang\u2019s turn to nod. As the blacksmith and Gi-Gyu watched the child work his magic, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help but marvel at Min-Su\u2019s power, stamina, and determination.\u201cAh!\u201d Old Man Hwang exclaimed as he remembered something. He continued, \u201cI just realized how selfishly I\u2019ve been acting. You have given me so much, but I have not returned the favor, especially now that you\u2019re my master.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that.\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head with an awkward smile. He still couldn\u2019t accept that Old Man Hwang had become\u00a0his Ego.\u00a0Perhaps it was because Gi-Gyu knew Old Man Hwang as a human before. Or maybe because of Old Man Hwang\u2019s strong consciousness.Old Man Hwang replied firmly, \u201cNo, let\u2019s make this clear. You are my rightful king.\u201dGi-Gyu felt uncomfortable correcting the elderly man twice, so all he could do was scratch his cheek awkwardly.\u201cSo could you do me this one favor?\u201d asked the blacksmith.\u201cFavor?\u201d\u201cTake this key to the address I wrote here. You will find here the gifts I would like to give you.\u201d Old Man Hwang explained as he handed Gi-Gyu a rusty key and a piece of paper. Gi-Gyu accepted it and replied, \u201cWhatever they are, I\u2019m sure they will benefit me. Thank you.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I had no idea how great being a guardian is. Its powers are amazing and convenient. It\u2019s so much better than the responsibilities I was burdened with in the past,\u201d Old Man Hwang continued. When he became a guardian Ego, he received guardian powers; when he was guarding Paimon\u2019s legacy, he received nothing but curse-like duties.Gi-Gyu had seen Old Man Hwang\u2019s status screen not too long ago.[Hwang Ji-Chul][Title: Guardian, Blacksmith][Level 81][Power: 121][Speed: 88][Stamina: 150][Magic: 87]-Abilities-[Human Form][Guardian Territory: His stats increase by 50% inside his guardian territory. Outside this area, his attributes decrease by 80%.][Territory Protector: Can teleport anywhere within his guardian territory once a day.][Protection Barrier: Twenty percent of the damage done to the barrier around the guardian territory will be transferred to him.][Blockade: Can trap the enemies that enter his territory within the barrier.]-Blacksmith Skills--Enchantment-Old Man Hwang\u2019s starting level and stats were higher than all of his other Egos. Old Man Hwang, as an Ego, was a masterpiece created by combining various powers, including a holy sword. Ergo, the blacksmith was an especially exceptional protector.Gi-Gyu liked what he saw in the elderly man\u2019s status screen: Under the \u201cBlacksmith Skills\u201d category, there were countless skills, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t bother examining them since he had no idea what they were anyway.And then there was the \u201cEnchantment\u201d category.Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cI had no idea you were an enchanter.\u201d\u201cI was originally an enchanter.\u201d Old Man Hwang explained that he awakened as an enchanter when he became a player. This meant the elderly man was also well versed in magic.\u201cAnyway, I hope we work well together, Sir. Please keep safe.\u201d\u201cAll right, I will,\u201d replied Old Man Hwang.Gi-Gyu also had to keep Old Man Hwang and Min-Su hidden from the Caravan Guild. Old Man Hwang was a blacksmith who had mastered Paimon\u2019s skills, while Min-Su was the only surviving heir to the Paimon\u2019s legacy. There were also many other reasons why the Caravan Guild would want these two individuals.\u201cThen I will see you later, Sir.\u201d With a polite bow, Gi-Gyu walked out. He played with the key Old Man Hwang gave him and thought about his reward.***The address Old Man Hwang gave him was of a storage facility in Dongdaemun. The shabby building was located in one of the gloomy allies. The metal shutter door was so rusted that it creaked unpleasantly when it was opened.\u201cJust what could be stored in a place like this?\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with curiosity. He couldn\u2019t feel any magic from the inside, so it couldn\u2019t be a weapon Old Man Hwang created or the Paimon\u2019s legacy itself. Still, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t help feeling excited since it was like Christmas morning to him.\u2018Actually, I haven\u2019t received any gifts in a while.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. Except for when he and Yoo-Jung were very young, they haven\u2019t received any Christmas gifts.\u201cI better get something good for Yoo-Jung from now on.\u201d Knowing his family\u2019s future Christmases would be much better now, Gi-Gyu smiled happily.\u201cAnd to protect my family\u2019s happiness, I must eliminate anything that threatens it,\u201d he murmured. To accomplish this, he needed to become more powerful. It was a simple concept, and Gi-Gyu was determined to follow it to the best of his ability.Rattle.Gi-Gyu inserted the rusty key into the even rustier lock. The two metal pieces were so old and damaged that Gi-Gyu spent much effort trying to open it. Soon, he became so frustrated that he used his strength to force it open. However, the lock didn\u2019t even creak, suggesting it wasn\u2019t made from normal metal.Click!Finally, the key turned.Rattle.The door slowly opened, and the lights turned on automatically. When Gi-Gyu looked inside, his jaw dropped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98. 40th Floor\u201cHahahahahah\u2026.\u201dThe creepy laughter of a man reverberated in the area.Slash!An enthralled beholder[1]\u00a0was cleaved in half when the man swung his sword without ever getting a chance to resist.Drip\u2026 Drip\u2026The red sword, covered in the beholder\u2019s purple blood, gleamed with a unique shade. A few drops of this blood slowly dripped to the ground, but most turned into a sticky mucus-like substance that the sword absorbed.[Lou has absorbed the beholder\u2019s blood.][Lou\u2019s immunity against psychic attacks has increased.]The system announcement rang in the man\u2019s head.\u201cHehehehahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d the man\u2019s terrific laughter rang again.Gi-Gyu\u2019s Egos begged him to stop.-Just stop already.-Master\u2026-Master! Why are you laughing like that?\u201cGrrr.\u201d Even Bi growled awkwardly, and Gi-Gyu finally stopped laughing.He thought happily, \u2018It gets so loud in my head due to all my Egos.\u2019Gi-Gyu\u2019s shell was still growing exponentially, so he was bound to have more Egos. He worried his ears would suffer then from all the talking Egos.Anyway, he continued laughing, much to his Egos\u2019 dismay.Lou said in annoyance,-I told you to stop!\u201cBut how can I stop?\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Lou sighed.-Gosh.There was a perfectly good and healthy reason behind Gi-Gyu\u2019s crazed laughter. He announced, \u201cOpen.\u201dWhen he ordered, Brunheart vibrated, and his gate glowed. Soon, dozens of skeletons marched out in an organized manner and created a formation around the gate. They still looked the same, but gobbling down so many crystals made them strong enough to deal with this floor\u2019s players and monsters easily.Gi-Gyu ordered, \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon, so protect this area.\u201dHe then drove a wedge into the ground. A recently purchased expensive barrier item. When the wedge was activated, a barrier that diverted other players\u2019 attention formed within specified perimeters. It was a high-level item and could withstand everything below a literal, full-scale war.Rattle.The skeletons nodded as if they understood Gi-Gyu. He smiled in satisfaction and was about to enter the gate when he turned around to face his soldiers again.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in sadness. He had such powerful soldiers, yet he had to do all the hunting himself. Again, there were reasons, believe me.Since skeletons only appeared on a few floors, a guy going around with a skeleton army would definitely attract much unwanted attention. Also, it could remind the other players of what happened in Yeoksam.The second reason was Lou. He could only become stronger by physically absorbing monster blood.Consequently, Gi-Gyu had to do the hunting himself.\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d Gi-Gyu promised the skeletons.Rattle.After organizing his thoughts, Gi-Gyu finally entered Bruntheart\u2019s gate. He may have used a barrier item, but leaving his skeletons and gate in the open wasn\u2019t a good idea. So, Gi-Gyu had to return as quickly as possible.***There was also a perfectly good and healthy reason behind Gi-Gyu entering his gate inside the Tower. The reason was right in front of his eyes now.\u201cPhew\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m so glad I can now enter the gate.\u201d Before, Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t enter Brunheart\u2019s gate; after he strengthened it with an Ego fragment, entry became possible.\u201cGrandmaster\u2026 welcome\u2026\u201d the durahan greeted. Even his vocalization became more precise thanks to munching down on crystals.Hart also greeted, \u201cGrandmaster, the construction is going smoothly.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded as he tried to look solemn by placing his arm on his waist.Rattle.Rattle.Gi-Gyu saw a large wagon, filled with stones, being dragged by hundreds of skeletons and one man. All of this was for one purpose: Building a pyramid.Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t know much about architecture, but Hart was a lich with vast knowledge. On top of that, Hart used his magic whenever the construction stalled. Consequently, construction continued at a fast pace.Originally, Brunheart\u2019s gate lacked stony materials; after he strengthened it with an Ego fragment, the gate began producing much more usable materials.\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu laughed in pleasure again. \u201cWhere are the things I gave you?\u201d\u201cI have stored them in the back safely. They will be displayed once the pyramid is completed.\u201d When Hart replied, Gi-Gyu asked, \u201cLet\u2019s go have a look. I need to verify they are stored safely.\u201d\u201cOf course. Please come this way.\u201d Hart began escorting Gi-Gyu. They left the construction site and headed toward a giant, temporary tent.\u201cOh! As expected, you have done an amazing job, Hart.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grandmaster.\u201dGi-Gyu slowly looked at the displayed items and nodded in satisfaction. Everything inside the tent was found in the storage room Old Man Hwang gave to Gi-Gyu.Sparkle.Countless gold, silver, and other precious, rare materials shone brightly. Looking at the many cars and elegant, ancient-looking objects, Gi-Gyu wondered if Old Man Hwang brought this from the other world. None of them were player items, but each looked priceless and beautiful.\u2018I\u2019m surprised at how possessive I feel about such objects.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu had never been interested in luxury items. But even he couldn\u2019t stop staring in awe when he saw Old Man Hwang\u2019s collection of rare luxury cars and antiques.What Gi-Gyu liked the most about them was the represented wealth.\u201cIf necessary, I can sell them for cash anytime,\u201d he mumbled in excitement. In the past, he wondered where Old Man Hwang kept all his wealth since he stayed in that tiny workshop. The truth was undoubtedly out of his expectations. He was shocked when he learned Old Man Hwang was a car collector and accumulated things that could easily be sold.Gi-Gyu ordered, \u201cDisplay them well inside the pyramid once it\u2019s completed.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command,\u201d replied Hart.\u201cOnce the exhibition area is built, make Rogers complete the rest of the pyramid alone.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my\u2014\u201d\u201cStop repeating the same thing, Hart.\u201d\u201cYes, Grandmaster.\u201dAfter giving his order, Gi-Gyu turned around. His eyes again caught the man dragging a wagon.\u2018Rogers Han.\u2019There were times when Gi-Gyu resented him so much that he wanted to drink his blood. Or feed him alive to a pack of wild dogs. However, Rogers was no longer a powerful player; he was just a helpless, worthless, weak slave now.Noticing Gi-Gyu\u2019s stare, Hart asked, \u201cWould you like to talk to him?\u201d\u201cLater,\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head and replied. Although his fury had subsided, he still resented Rogers. For now, Rogers would continue to be punished, but he would get his salvation someday.\u2018When I need him, of course.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu planned on using Rogers as a pawn in the future.Suddenly, Rogers and Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes met. Rogers lowered his head of his own volition, free of anger and pride. Actually, his fury was directed elsewhere now.\u2018I will be your dog. Just give me a chance.\u2019\u00a0Rogers tried to project his thoughts to Gi-Gyu. He was desperate for a chance to kill Ironshield. He now knew that Gi-Gyu wasn\u2019t a helpless rookie player\u2014He was a beastly player with monsters under his command. There was no limit to how much Gi-Gyu could grow.\u2018If I can borrow Kim Gi-Gyu\u2019s power, I know I can get my revenge against Ironshield.\u2019\u00a0This was what Rogers Han believed. Unfortunately, his beliefs came from a muddled mind, unaware that he was just Gi-Gyu\u2019s pawn.***Lou explained,-Andras\u2019 main abilities include fire, sword, and psychic attacks.Gi-Gyu swung his sword like an automated machine while listening to Lou.[Lou has absorbed the beholder\u2019s blood.][Lou\u2019s immunity against psychic attacks has increased.]The system announcement followed Lou\u2019s comment.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll remember that.\u201dWhile Lou absorbed the monster\u2019s blood, Gi-Gyu decided to take a short break with the hundreds of crystals littered around him.\u201cOpen,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced after ensuring no one was around him. The skeletons left the gate and retrieved all the crystals. After crystals were stored inside the gate, most were absorbed by the gate monsters. The remaining were kept to be sold for cash later. Thanks to the improvements made to the gate, Gi-Gyu now had a consistent stream of income.\u201cGrrr!\u201d Just then, Bi returned with a mouth full of beholders.\u201cGood job.\u201d When Gi-Gyu patted the wolf affectionately, Bi swallowed the beholders along with the crystals. Recently, he learned that Bi could also increase its stats by ingesting crystals. It was not the most effective level-up method, but he still allowed it. Bi also liked eating crystals, so he enjoyed giving them to the wolf as a reward.Gi-Gyu suggested, \u201cGo hunt some more. Or you can bring more beholders if you want.\u201d\u201cGrrr!\u201d Bi growled again before sprinting. Gi-Gyu began eating his lunch as he looked around. His skeletons collected and transferred the crystals into the gate while a strange-colored wolf flew around the Tower, munching on the monsters.Chuckling, Gi-Gyu muttered, \u201cIf someone saw me like this, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m the boss monster.\u201dAfter all, Gi-Gyu was using his monsters for hunting floor monsters. Who else but a boss monster or a high-level monster could achieve a feat like this?After eating his lunch, Gi-Gyu stood up. Now, he only had to hunt a few more monsters for Lou to reach the maximum psychic attack immunity level. After that, he would ascend the Tower and hunt monsters that specialized in psychic attacks.Slowly but surely, Gi-Gyu was preparing himself to battle Andras.\u201cGrrr!\u201d From far away, Bi returned with another mouthful of beholders.\u201cLet\u2019s hunt.\u201d Gi-Gyu vanished from his original spot and reappeared on top of Bi, slaying countless beholders nearby.***[Lou has reached Level 100.][Lou has satisfied the qualification to evolve.][The necessary conditions for Lou\u2019s evolution will appear.]Gi-Gyu suddenly stopped swinging his sword in midair. His entire body was covered in beholders\u2019 purple blood; the unpleasant smell seeped into his nose.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu had been hunting monsters non-stop for hours, so he took a tired breath and asked, \u201cEvolve?\u201d The latest system notification baffled him.-My body feels strange. It feels hot\u2026 I feel weird\u2026Lou sounded calm, but Gi-Gyu could feel his confusion. After ordering the skeletons to start collecting the new crystals, Gi-Gyu opened the system screen.[Lou\u2019s first evolution][Part of Lou\u2019s physical body: 1/1][Ego fragment: 10/10][Egofied souls: 3/3][Demon fragment: 1/1][Monster blood: ???/???]\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Gi-Gyu was surprised to see that all the necessary conditions for Lou\u2019s evolution were already met. He was also shocked to see the many needed materials: He obtained those after much effort. One of them was a part of Lou\u2019s physical body that he obtained as a reward for clearing the 30th-floor test.\u201cThis means\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu suspected that El\u2019s physical body would appear on the 40th-floor test.-How terrible.Lou commented, but El didn\u2019t say anything.-...Was this because she could guess her fate? Or was there another reason? Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t tell.\u201cTen Ego fragments\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in awe. He would have to clear at least ten gates to recollect ten fragments. Physically, this wasn\u2019t a difficult task. But there were only a limited number of gates, and all guilds were greedy for them. So, if the next evolution also had an ingredient list this extravagant, he wondered if he could even get all the necessary material.\u201cAnd what\u2019s up with those three egofied souls? Isn\u2019t that just asking for too much?!\u201d Gi-Gyu scratched his head in frustration.Egofied souls, as the name suggests, were souls that Gi-Gyu egofied. For example, Gi-Gyu recently egofied Hwang Chae-Il\u2019s soul. He had already used a few Ego souls and fragments, so he now only had four Ego souls left:\u00a0Rhodes, Hwang Chae-Il, Choi Min-Suk, and Kersetu.Kersetu was the boss monster Gi-Gyu successfully egofied in one of the gates he cleared during his gate-clearing spree. Kersetu was a steel giant; Gi-Gyu's victory over the powerful monster was hard-fought.\u201cBut I still don\u2019t know all the conditions for a successful soul egofication process,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured in concern. He was worried he would fail to egofy another soul in the future. He had the same worries for Cannibalism since its conditions were also hazy. However, he had an idea.\u2018I think it might be all about the victim\u2019s evil nature.\u2019There was no question Choi Min-Suk and Rhodes were evil, but it wasn\u2019t as clear-cut with Chang-Gyung, Hwang Chae-Il, and Kersetu.-I think evil creatures have a higher chance of egofication, but it\u2019s not guaranteed even for them. I think it\u2019s just a random process.\u201cI agree,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied. \u201cPerez, the fourth-floor guardian, must be the demon fragment, but what\u2019s with the monster blood? Are all those question marks because you absorbed too much blood?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu sighed deeply. The things he needed to use for Lou\u2019s evolution were priceless.\u201cSigh\u2026 I guess Lou\u2019s evolution is even more important.\u201d-Hmph.Lou harrumphed as if embarrassed; Gi-Gyu\u2019s lips curled up in amusement. After a short silence, he ordered, \u201cGo ahead with the evolution.\u201d[Lou\u2019s evolution will now begin.]1. Beholder is a type of monster.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99. 40th Floor (2)Currently, Gi-Gyu stood on the 35th floor. He had already cleared all the floors that were inhabited by the beholders. Now, Lou had the maximum immunity against psychic attacks. So, he didn\u2019t have to focus on killing more beholders; instead, he had to look for monsters that could provide other immunities, stats, or abilities.The 35th floor was the low-level succubi\u2019s territory; unfortunately, its blood also gave Lou psychic attack immunity.\u00a0However, Gi-Gyu had no choice but to hunt them.Blaze.The fire from the sword burned brightly as it targeted the monsters. Unlike the beautiful succubi, these monsters boasted of gruesome appearances. They were none other than the dwarves.\u201cSqueeel!\u201d the dwarves shrieked in pain. Due to their ugly appearance, it was impossible to tell their genders. Being subspecies of incubi and succubi, they also specialized in psychic attacks and were low-level monsters.The monsters scurried away from the line of attack in pain as the fire began burning them alive.Gi-Gyu announced quietly, \u201cSummon.\u201dThud!Suddenly, the area was filled with loud footsteps. Three creatures materialized from the drops of blood and Death\u2019s violet smoke. The first was a humongous steel giant, while the other two resembled familiar human players.\u201cSplit into two and destroy them all.\u201d The three beings made of blood and Death nodded and began sprinting. The monsters on the right side were taken care of by the huge steel giant Kersetu and the mystical wolf Bi. The creatures in the form of Rhodes and Choi Min-Suk took care of the left side.These summoned creatures quickly hunted down the monsters; soon, only several dozens of crystals and monster corpses remained around Gi-Gyu.\u201cTransmutation,\u201d Gi-Gyu shouted as he raised Lou. Then, the three summoned beings turned back into blood and Death\u2019s violet smoke before returning to Lou. Once they were absorbed, Gi-Gyu felt a kind of fullness and satisfaction.\"This is only just the beginning,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured with a naughty grin. He kept Lou raised as he still hadn\u2019t absorbed the floor monsters' blood. Once everything was over, only the dying flames and the crystals were left behind.\u201cOpen,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced, and dark clouds only he could see appeared from Lou.\u00a0It was a barrier-like skill that made the surrounding area invisible.Brunheart\u2019s gate quickly opened, and the skeletons orderly walked to collect the crystals.\u201cThis is so convenient.\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t hide how impressed he was. Only one thing had changed, yet everything was different now. He now didn\u2019t have to hunt the monsters one by one, he didn\u2019t have to pick up the crystals himself, and lastly, he didn\u2019t have to worry about others seeing his skeletons. And all these conveniences were thanks to one change.-Ahem.More specifically, it was thanks to Lou.\u201cHmm\u2026 I know you\u2019re being arrogant, but I can\u2019t fault you for that.\u201d Gi-Gyu couldn\u2019t even muster up any sarcasm since Lou\u2019s new powers had truly awed him.-You must remember that this is still not even\u00a0a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of\u00a0my true power.\u201cYeah, yeah, I get it. Would you stop repeating that line?\u201d Had Gi-Gyu not stopped Lou, he would have continued on and on about his true power.-Anyway, it appears that you can finally start using\u00a0a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of\u00a0my true power. Ahem.\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d-What are you talking about? Not even close. Once I regain my power, the entire world will kneel before me!\u201cShut up, Lou.\u201d Gi-Gyu interrupted his Ego. Suffice to say, Lou\u2019s first evolution increased his abilities and stats exponentially, but it also significantly changed his personality. After what happened on the 30th floor, Lou had become a little more solemn. But now, Lou has returned to being childish and rude.El murmured,-It feels like I have less and less work to do, Master.After Lou\u2019s first evolution, Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t use El much. Lou\u2019s summoned beings took care of the monster hunt, and Brunheart\u2019s skeletons dealt with the resulting crystals. The other Egos had their specified duties, but Gi-Gyu\u2019s need for her was fading away.\u2018Does she feel insecure?\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu wondered if this was why El had been sleeping more and talking less. He thought she felt useless since her role in his life was declining.He consoled her, \u201cThings will improve for you soon.\u201dHe truly believed this because his sharp instinct told him so, and the current situation also suggested the same.\u2018Once I reach the 40th floor, there will be many changes,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought. When he patted El gently, her anxiety lessened a little. Still, she murmured,-Things won\u2019t go the way you think, Master.Her voice was very faint as if she was trying to hide her nervousness.***-Why don\u2019t you have a look at my stat screen?\u201cPfft.\u201d Gi-Gyu did his best to stop himself from laughing when he heard Lou\u2019s shy request. Lou usually acted cool and arrogant, so Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t expect him to make such a request.\u201cYou just love your new powers, don\u2019t you?\u201d-Hmm\u2026Lou coughed uncomfortably, making it obvious he loved his new abilities. Without teasing Lou further, Gi-Gyu opened Lou\u2019s stat screen.[Lou][First Evolution Completed][Title: Master of Black Magic and Evil Swords][Level 103][Power: 197][Speed: 180][Stamina: 201][Magic 241][Poison Immunity: 13%, Flame Immunity: 12%, Heat Immunity: 13%, Psychic Attack Immunity: 15%, Defense: 7.7%, Magic affinity increased]-Available Skills-[Accessory][Cannibalism[1]: You can prey on corpses to regain your stamina.][Transmutation[2]\u00a0: You can absorb the blood and souls of hunted monsters.][Spirit Fusion: You can give elemental powers to Lou.][Amplification: Lou can amplify a skill\u2019s might.][Summon: You can summon absorbed Egos.][Death: Can control death.][Egofication: Absorbed souls can be egofied with a set success rate.][Black Magic: You can bless other Egos with black magic.][Absorbed Demon: 0][Absorbed Player: Choi Won-Jae\u2019s fragment, Chalemont\u2019s fragment.][Ego: Rhodes, Choi Min-Suk, Kersetu.][Ego Management]Needless to say, there were significant changes in Lou\u2019s status screen. For starters, all the skills he gained through Cannibalism were gone, replaced by\u00a0many new skills. Lou could now absorb the blood and the souls of monsters from a distance with Transmutation. Spirit Fusion allowed Lou to use Bi\u2019s elemental skill to create much destruction. The invisible barrier from before was just a combination of Lou and Elemental Dark using Spirit Fusion.Summon was responsible for the three summoned beings from the last fight. Since Gi-Gyu\u2019s demon fragments weren\u2019t Egos yet, he couldn\u2019t summon them. For a successful Egofication, he needed a soul and a truckload of luck.\u201cDeath and Ego Management,\u201d Gi-Gyu murmured the name of his two favorites. Originally, Death only appeared on Gi-Gyu\u2019s status screen; now, it was on Lou\u2019s screen too. Consequently, he would now feel less rebound from using this skill. Also, Gi-Gyu and Lou having the same skill created synergy, increasing the skill\u2019s usage capabilities.The last thing was the Ego Management category. The Egos sacrificed for Lou\u2019s evolution weren\u2019t actually sacrificed: Their abilities remained the same, although their intelligence decreased. However, it could be restored by substituting their souls, blood, and attributes Lou absorbed.\u201cIt will have limitless possibilities in the future,\u201d Gi-Gyu announced in satisfaction. It was already beneficial to him, but he suspected it would be even handier later.\u201cSomeday, it might even be enough to take down Lee Sun-Ho or Ironshield.\u201d Lou\u2019s evolution alone gave Gi-Gyu\u2019s strength an incredible boost. More importantly, he knew he would grow more.-You better respect and serve me better from now on.\u201cYou want me to hit you again?\u201d Gi-Gyu muttered to Lou. The only con was that Lou\u2019s old personality returned.***After 15 days inside the Tower,\u00a0Gi-Gyu decided to return home. Hunting was important, but maintaining relationships, not just with his family but also with his friends, was also vital. He looked like a handsome homeless now, so he had to take care of that too. He could trim his beard inside the Tower, but he couldn\u2019t wash off the thick smell of blood.As Gi-Gyu came down to the lower floors, the low-level monsters tried their best to avoid him. Gi-Gyu was covered in high-level monsters\u2019 blood, so he probably seemed like the grim reaper to them.After first going to the association and getting a shower, Gi-Gyu visited Tae-Shik\u2019s office. Looking at the empty office, Gi-Gyu asked the secretary, \u201cWhere did General Manager Oh Tae-Shik go?\u201d\u201cAh, please give me a minute.\u201d Oh Tae-Shik\u2019s secretary made a quick call. Soon, Sung-Hoon appeared and said to Gi-Gyu, \u201cThe general manager went to your home, Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu.\u201d\u201cMy home?\u201d asked Gi-Gyu in confusion.\u201cYes\u2026 He went through some stuff recently.\u201d\u00a0When Sung-Hoon explained, Gi-Gyu nodded.Finding the Caravan guild couldn\u2019t have been an easy task. Tae-Shik sometimes looked like a silly middle-aged man, but he was like a tiger when he worked. Most people felt uncomfortable around Tae-Shik, despite his courteous nature, because he could be overwhelmingly charismatic.\u2018Given his strength and assertiveness, he could've easily become a king in the olden days,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu thought.Sung-Hoon asked, \u201cWould you like to head home?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Gi-Gyu caressed his beard and contemplated. Earlier, he shaved using Lou, so he still had a thick stubble on his chin. He regretted not shaving again with a proper razor.\u201cNo, I should drop by somewhere first.\u201d When Gi-Gyu replied, Sung-Hoon offered, \u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t spend much time with Sung-Hoon lately, so he accepted the offer, and Sung-Hoon quickly brought Gi-Gyu\u2019s car out of the parking lot. Watching his car, Gi-Gyu contemplated, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sung-Hoon asked in confusion. Gi-Gyu turned at Sung-Hoon and muttered, \u201cDo you like secondhand stuff?\u201d\u201cSecondhand? Secondhand what?\u201dGi-Gyu slowly raised his finger to point at his car. Still confused, Sung-Hoon tilted his head and murmured, \u201cWell, if you mean your car, of course, I would love it. It\u2019s a very fancy car, after all.\u201dGi-Gyu\u2019s car was indeed an expensive foreign car. It was technically a secondhand car, but it was practically new because Gi-Gyu barely used it. So accepting it was a no-brainer for Sung-Hoon.Gi-Gyu suggested, \u201cThen you can have it. I feel like I haven\u2019t shown you my appreciation lately.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cA-actually, no.\u201d Gi-Gyu shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll give this to Yoo-Jung and get you a new one. Giving you my second-hand car seems wrong.\u201dGi-Gyu quietly took Sung-Hoon to the deserted parking lot and opened his gate. Sung-Hoon knew about his gate, but he couldn\u2019t understand why Gi-Gyu opened it now.With a smile, Gi-Gyu said to Sung-Hoon, \u201cPlease follow me.\u201dThe two men walked into Brunheart\u2019s gate.1. Cannibalism has evolved as it can now steal stamina and egofy stronger creatures.\u00a0\u261c2. Used on weaker, grunt-like creatures, also works on numerous creatures simultaneously as opposed to Cannibalism.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100. 40th Floor (3)Vrooom!As the passersby heard the obnoxiously loud engine, they could help but frown. However, they gasped in shock when they spotted the car.\u201cUwaahhh\u2026\u201dYou could never hate an expensive and luxurious car. While the women were impressed but still annoyed by the annoying sound, the men just exclaimed in awe.\u201cThat's so amazing.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dSurprisingly, even the driver of the said car shared their awe.\u201cOh my gosh! This is the best!\u201d Heo Sung-Hoon yelled in ecstasy. Using his enhanced reflexes as a player, he drove his new car slightly beyond the speed limit without getting in trouble.\u201cPlease be careful!\u201d When Gi-Gyu warned, Sung-Hoon regained his senses, slowed down, and murmured, \u201cAh\u2026 Sorry.\u201dSung-Hoon quickly added, \u201cI just can\u2019t believe I get to drive a car like this.\u201dGi-Gyu smiled brightly as he watched how happy Sung-Hoon was with his new gift. The association used its close ties with the government to take care of all the complicated paperwork for Gi-Gyu quickly. He also used his merc status to expedite the process further; consequently, Sung-Hoon was now a proud owner of this supercar.\u2018Still, I can\u2019t get over what I saw inside the gate.\u2019\u00a0Sung-Hoon remembered when he entered Brunheart\u2019s gate for the first time. He was shocked by how well maintained it looked. He was even more surprised to see the skeletons and Rogers working like Egyptian slaves.\u2018And then, there were all those cars\u2026\u2019\u00a0Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t breathe when he saw the extravagant cars. These cars were so rare and valuable that not even the richest players could obtain them easily. Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t imagine where Gi-Gyu found them, but he couldn\u2019t ask because his jaw was on the floor.Then, Gi-Gyu offered, \u201cPlease pick one.\u201dEven as he drove the car, Sung-Hoon couldn\u2019t believe Gi-Gyu had really gifted him this car. Since Gi-Gyu even offered to pay all the maintenance fees, he only had to enjoy the new car.\u201cI\u2019ll serve you forever, Your Majesty!\u201d Sung-Hoon exclaimed as he stepped on the pedal.***Sung-Hoon, who couldn\u2019t hide his excitement a moment ago, stood solemnly with his head down. The atmosphere turned tense suddenly, but Sung-Hoon silently accepted the change since he was used to such situations.Gi-Gyu announced in a bitter voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come sooner.\u201dGi-Gyu was sitting across from Yoo Suk-Woo, his friend, the Cain Guild\u2019s master, and the one who helped him destroy the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch.Unfortunately, the Cain Guild suffered many casualties during the Yeoksam incident, just like the Morningstar and the Child guilds.Gi-Gyu had called these guilds a few times before regarding the incident's aftermath, but he never visited them in person. He knew well that it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do.While preparing the plan, he forgot to consider one variable\u2014Guilt. After the fight, he realized he had sacrificed many for his selfish endeavors, so he couldn\u2019t help feeling responsible. Then, his guilt stopped him from visiting the Cain or the Morningstar guilds.Once Gi-Gyu felt more collected, he escaped the overwhelming guilt and finally faced his sin.Suk-Woo gave him a faint smile and replied, \u201cI understand.\u201d It was a bitter and sad smile.\u201cThanks for understanding,\u201d answered Gi-Gyu. Various emotions replaced the noise in the room, and the players just sat there silently.Guilt and forgiveness.Altruism and selfishness.Gi-Gyu and Suk-Woo didn\u2019t say much, but their silence conveyed much more. Gi-Gyu lowered his head awkwardly.\u201cYou have grown and become stronger, which is enough for me. Besides, we made those choices, so you don\u2019t have to feel guilty. You would be disrespecting the brave players and their choices if you felt burdened.\u201d Suk-Woo touched Gi-Gyu\u2019s shoulder encouragingly and consoled him.Suk-Woo\u2019s tone was rigid, but it was clear that he was trying to comfort him. Lowering his eyes, Gi-Gyu\u2019s hands trembled slightly as he asked, \u201cThey must all hate me, don\u2019t they?\u201dSuk-Woo replied immediately, \u201cI told you that we made our own choices. Every member of my guild chose to do it. None of them are so weak that they can\u2019t take responsibility for their actions.\u201dGi-Gyu nodded. Cain Guild was indeed powerful, not just physically but also emotionally.Gi-Gyu promised, \u201cNo matter what, I will always remain an ally of the Cain Guild. I will never forget what you and your guild did for me.\u201dSuk-Woo smiled and replied, \u201cGood. I sacrificed my family for that, so you better keep your words. And besides, you\u2019re part of my family too, aren\u2019t you?\u201dGi-Gyu felt a nice warmth in the Cain Guild\u2019s office that day.***The Cain Guild benefited much from eliminating the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch, but Gi-Gyu didn\u2019t think it was enough. More specifically, he wanted to give Suk-Woo and his guild something more personal. So, he decided to donate most of the money he made from selling crystals from Brunheart\u2019s gate. He knew Suk-Woo would never accept it, so he anonymously donated it to the Cain Guild through the association.\u2018I hope it will make things a little better,\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu wished. He knew he couldn\u2019t put a price on human lives, but he hoped that this money would at least help a little.The next places he needed to visit were the Morningstar and the Child guilds.Gi-Gyu asked in shock, \u201cYou are merging the two guilds?\u201dSun-Pil nodded and slowly explained, \u201cWe suffered greater casualties than we expected from the Yeoksam incident. Many guild members are fearful, so we decided merging our two guilds would do us good.\u201dSun-Pil\u2019s demeanor was very different from Suk-Woo's; he looked too tired. The Cain Guild was close-knit like a family, while the Morningstar Guild was strictly a business. The Child Guild was somewhere in the middle.The Morningstar and the Child guilds were smaller than the Cain Guild, so their casualties seemed greater. Also, since the Cain Guild was much older, the members were closer with stronger comradery. Morningstar Guild, a much newer group, was rapidly losing its members because the quitters thought their guild's actions had angered the Iron Guild.Gi-Gyu turned rigid as he asked, \u201cWhat about the confidentiality issue?\u201dAll the players recruited for the Yeoksam battle were considered trustworthy, but if they quit their guilds, Gi-Gyu feared they would leak what really happened with the branch.Sun-Pil replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. They all signed the player\u2019s non-disclosure agreement.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Gi-Gyu nodded. Since the player\u2019s NDA was a forceful contract among players, he felt reassured.\u201cSo if the two guilds are merging, who will be the guild master?\u2019Clack.Someone walked into the room and answered Gi-Gyu\u2019s question, \u201cWe\u2019ll be co-guild masters.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu as he watched the former Child Guild\u2019s master, Kim Dong-Hae. He hurried here when he heard Gi-Gyu was visiting the Morningstar Guild.Gi-Gyu apologized to both guild masters, \u201cI have no excuse. I should\u2019ve come sooner; I\u2019m sorry.\u201dSince it was just a business deal, some might think Gi-Gyu was overdoing it. However, people, some with loved ones and some with no one, had died; \u00a0he was apologizing for them.Sun-Pil nodded in understanding and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. We all did what we did for personal gains anyway.\u201dBut Kim Dong-Hae didn\u2019t share Sun-Pil\u2019s feelings. He said with a tense face, \u201cYou should\u2019ve come sooner.\u201dSun-Pil looked very uncomfortable with Dong-Hae\u2019s confrontation, but Gi-Gyu remained calm and looked at Dong-Hae. Dong-Hae looked into Gi-Gyu\u2019s eyes and continued rigidly, \u201cYou made a big mistake, Ranker Kim Gi-Gyu. Strong people draw people toward them, and you have that quality. You will keep climbing to the top, and many will willingly follow you. That I\u2019m sure of.\u201dDong-Hae took an audible gulp and murmured, \u201cYou\u201d\u2014fear flooded his eyes\u2014\u201d have to show more interest and responsibility toward these people. After all, we are all your allies, aren\u2019t we?\u201dGi-Gyu could feel the sincerity in Dong-Hae\u2019s plea. He bowed deeply and apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He didn\u2019t look up for a long time, but he murmured when he did, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything you said just now, Dong-Hae.\u00a0I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m as great a person as you think.\u00a0But I promise you that I will do my best to help you and the Cain Guild. You can count on me.\u201dGi-Gyu meant what he said and appreciated Dong-Hae\u2019s criticism. It wasn\u2019t that Sun-Pil and Suk-Woo didn\u2019t criticize Gi-Gyu because they didn\u2019t care. All these guild masters just had different feelings and opinions about what happened.Dong-Hae entered this situation when it was just a business deal; now, he was looking for something more.Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAnd I do consider you my ally.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Dong-Hae got the confirmation he wanted and seemed satisfied.\u201cNow, it\u2019s all good.\u201d Sun-Pil tried to lighten the mood. Indeed, what happened was all in the past now. Everyone lost something in the battle, but they all also gained something in return. Now, it was time to greet the future.Sun-Pil asked Gi-Gyu, \"Hyung, there is actually something you can help us with.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? I\u2019ll do my best to do what you want if it\u2019s something I can do,\u201d replied Gi-Gyu.\u201cActually, this is something only you can do, Hyung,\u201d Sun-Pil answered with a smile, while Dong-Hae wiped away his tears and nodded. Apparently, the duo had already discussed what they planned to ask Gi-Gyu.***Clang.Once again, the area around the Bukhan River was filled with metallic rumble. Gi-Gyu stood in an empty lot near the Bukhan River, surrounded by numerous buildings. The empty plot also had many players who had encircled Gi-Gyu rang and were responsible for the metallic clangs.Clang.Jae-Won, a member of Morningstar and Sun-Pil\u2019s friend, ordered the players, \u201cDealers, step back and let the tankers take over the front!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d several players in training shouted.\u201cHealers! Why are you just standing around? Use your healing skill!\u201d When Jae-Won yelled, the healers in training replied, \u201cOkay!\u201dThe recruits moved quickly as they followed Jae-Won\u2019s orders.Rattle.Meanwhile, the skeleton soldiers moved accordingly. Watching the scene with interest, Gi-Gyu asked Sun-Pil, \u201cWhat do you think? Is this helping?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Sun-Pil nodded emphatically. Sun-Pil's favor was asking for his skeletons. After many Morningstar and Child members died, their guilds merged and accepted many recruits. However, the merged guild found training all those recruits near impossible. Using guides to get all of them through the tutorial floors would take too long. On top of that, these novices were terrified of the monsters.So, Sun-Pil came up with an idea: If the newbies fought Gi-Gyu\u2019s skeletons, they could learn quickly in a safe environment.\u201cFor now, we told the new players that we have a player of the summoning category. We explained that the skeletons are summoned beings. Also, we got all of them to sign the NDAs and the guild contracts. We\u2019ve only brought those we knew we could trust,\u201d Sun-Pil explained.Sun-Pil continued, \u201cThis is where we will build the new office for the Morningstar-Child Guild. A barrier surrounds this training lot, so no one can see what\u2019s happening; only those with our permission can enter. In the future, we\u2019ll also build an underground training hall.\u201d\u201cAll right. Please take care of all the details. I\u2019m just glad I can help,\u201d Gi-Gyu replied simply. Sun-Pil looked up to Gi-Gyu; that was probably why he chose to build his headquarters near the Bukhan River.\u2018Soon, it won\u2019t really matter if people find out about my skeletons.\u2019\u00a0Gi-Gyu only needed to hide his gate\u2019s existence for a bit longer. Once he was stronger and had a more stable status, he could comfortably reveal his ability to the world. As time passed, the public would forget about what happened to the Iron Guild\u2019s Korean branch, so no one would connect Gi-Gyu\u2019s skeletons to the Yeoksam incident.While the skeletons stayed outside the gate, they had to consume crystals. But the gate had become so efficient in creating new crystals with the excess energy that Gi-Gyu could afford to do this.\u201cI\u2019ll return them later, Hyung.\u201d When Sun-Pil promised, Gi-Gyu replied, \u201cAll right. And if you need anything else, please let me know. If you can\u2019t get a hold of me, you can\u201d\u2014he pointed at Sung-Hoon\u2014\u201ccontact Sung-Hoon, and he\u2019ll help you out.\u201d\u201cAll right, Hyung.\u201dNow that Gi-Gyu had helped the Cain and the Morningstar-Child guilds, he felt much better.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Gi-Gyu waved and left quickly. Now that he was feeling good, it was time to get back to hunting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
