There\u2019s a hole in my stomach, anyways.\u2019He wanted to say that but he just let it be.He remembered the spring from 20 years ago.\u2018Was I 18 years old when I ran out of the town saying that I would become a great commander that would command the entire world?\u2019After that, he kept going to the battlefield for 20 years.And the result of that was that he only had a bit of money in his hands and that he belonged to the first corps of spearmen.\u2018What great general. I\u2019m going to die freezing. Damn it.\u201dHis life passed through like a revolving lantern.\u2018What would have happened if I had participated in that surprise tactic? No, if I had enrolled when they were enlisting soldiers in the region of Bate? No, no. If I went west in that winter when there was the monster subjugation?\u2019A crossroad with plenty of choices.At that time, he chose one side without hesitating.But the results weren\u2019t that good.And because of that, he had a hole in his stomach and was waiting to die.Soon, he could see the evil expressions of the enemy soldiers very close.\u2018Damn it.\u2019The curse ran through his throat.Stab.A steel sword stabbed his chest.\u201cDamn\u2026\u2026it.\u201dHis voice without strength rolled outside his mouth.Roan of the first corps of spearmen from the Rinse kingdom died like that.Translator: SubakNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Huff . Huff\u201dHis chest beat like he had run the whole day.\u2018Did I die?\u2019He felt strange.His senses felt dull just like when he had just woken up from a dream, and his head hurt as if it would split.At that time, he felt a strong impact in the back of his head.Thwack!\u201cThis bastard of a newcomer slipping out! You dare to get asleep while we are on standby for battle?\u201dRoan looked back with his cloudy eyes while touching the back of his head.\u201cOh? Are you glaring at me right now?\u201dA robust man with a square chin.He couldn\u2019t see well because his field of vision bothered him, but Roan could know who he was.\u201cMister Pete?\u201dIt was certainly Pete.The senior of the 7th corps rose unit he was first in 20 years ago.\u2018But he died in the monsters subjugation 20 years ago\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan frowned.\u2018In the end, you meet dead people again.\u2019At that moment, he stood up and extended his hand, feeling glad to see him again.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. Nice to see you.\u201dA greeting while he smiled.However, Pete\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t that good.\u201cThis bastard!\u201dA punch flew along with a curse.Thwack!\u201cKugh!\u201dRoan rolled after being hit.A severe pain could be felt.\u2018Damn it. Can you feel pain even after you die?\u2019He moved his chin.At that time, he saw his right hand and his body.A really feeble body.On top of that, the back of his hand was soft and clean.\u2018What is this? Do you get younger when you die?\u2019Everything made him question.At that time, someone hurriedly came to him and stopped him.\u201cRoan. Are you crazy? Why are you so suddenly like this?\u201dA noise so small it seemed it was whispering to him.Roan slowly turned his head and looked at the owner of the voice.\u201cPierce?\u201dA surprised expression.Roan\u2019s face was much more surprised than when he saw Pete.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026\u2026.? No, you got younger on top of that?\u201dPierce didn\u2019t die.On top of that, he couldn\u2019t die.Because after he became duke of Rinse kingdom, he didn\u2019t show himself in dangerous places like battlefields.However, he couldn\u2019t understand more than anything how he got young. It made him remember the first time they met 20 years ago.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dPierce slapped him with a hurried expression.Slap.At that moment, Roan felt that his consciousness got clearer.Just like the fog in his head was lifted.And the dull senses became sharp just like before.When that happened, he could clearly see the scene before him.\u2018Is this the rose troop\u2019s barracks?\u2019He was certain.He was certain that it was the barracks the rose troop used 20 years ago.It wasn\u2019t a thing such as heaven or hell.On top of that, the people that were seated in a line on the floor.They were all familiar faces.\u2018My comrades from the rose troop from 20 years ago? What happened? Did I not die?\u201dA confusing situation.However, his thoughts didn\u2019t last for long.\u201cThis bastard!Because Pete approached him and kicked him.Bang.\u201cKugh.\u201dRoan rolled in the floor and quickly curled himself.He hid his vitals by instinct.But fortunately, Pete couldn\u2019t continue kicking him.It was because the entrance of the barracks opened and a middle aged man with scary eyes appeared.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dA sharp voice.Roan recognized the owner of that voice even without looking at him.\u2018Squad commander Tane.\u2019His head started to roll.\u2018I didn\u2019t die.\u2019He slowly pinched the inner sides of his tigh.An intense pain.\u2018It\u2019s not even a dream.\u2019Then only one thing remains.\u2018Did I return to the past?\u2019It was difficult to believe, but it had the highest probabilities.If that also wasn\u2019t it, maybe the past 20 years of his life was just a dream.\u2018Whatever it is, i\u2019m still alive.\u2019It was enough for him with just that.Roan slowly stood up from that place and returned to his seat.Tane frowned but he didn\u2019t keep talking.He didn\u2019t have the leisure to do so right now.\u201cEverybody prepare. We will pass through Ale village and reach Pedian\u2019s plain.\u201dAt that moment, everybody\u2019s faces became distorted.\u201cOh damn. For it to be Ale village.\u201d\u201cIf we went to Varen\u2019s castle I was planning to densely ease myself.\u201d\u201cThat bar last time was fine, right?\u201d\u201cYes. The female owner killed it.\u201dThey talked among themselves and soothed their regretful feelings. Tane clapped.Clap!\u201cEverybody shut your mouths and move quickly! Oliver take care of the newcomers.\u201d\u201cYep!\u201dOliver that was tall and had a slim body replied in a loud voice and approached Roan.\u201cEverybody take your helmets and your armor.\u201dAt his words, the newcomer soldiers including Pierce started to slowly equip their armor.Oliver looked at Roan and said as if he was growling.\u201cYou stupid bastard. You too wear it quickly. I\u2019m looki\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t finish his words.Roan had skillfully equipped the armour and even finished organizing his luggage in an instant.\u2018What is this bastard? Why is he so skilled?\u2019Oliver was at a loss of words for a moment.Only looking at how he was packing the luggage was even a step higher than himself.\u2018I did these kind of things for 20 years.\u2019Roan put a bitter smile.Oliver wanted to say something else, but as he had nothing to point out he turned back with a disappointed face.At that time, Pierce\u2019s voice rang through his ear.\u201cRoan.\u201dA voice so small it seemed he was whispering him.As Roan looked back Pierce pointed the luggage bag and put a pitiable face.\u2018You really are the same as 20 years ago.\u2019He was also like this back then.Pierce at that time was timid and didn\u2019t have any talent. But on top of that he had a small body so he always asked him for help.Roan walked towards him and shook his head after packing his luggage in the bag.\u2018For this guy to become the duke of Rinse kingdom surpassing the commander in chief\u2026\u2026..\u2019Just looking at him right now, was something unbelievable.\u2018He was lucky. His life became better when he became apprenticed to the genius spearman Reil Baker\u2026\u2026..\u2019At that moment, Roan\u2019s eyes became round wide.His fingers trembled.\u201cRoan. What happened?\u201dPierce put on a worried expression but it wasn\u2019t a situation where he could mind that.\u2018If it\u2019s true that I returned to the past, then I know what\u2019s going to happen from now on.\u2019Although he didn\u2019t remember all of the small details and accidents, he did remember the news that made the world shake.Especially, the battles and wars he faced the past 20 years. He remembered it all clearly to the point that if he was asked to make a report of it, he could write it all down.Thump thump.His heart beat faster.\u2018I can become one.\u2019His two eyes became filled with hot passion.\u2018This time, I can become one.\u2019Roan\u2019s face became bright red.\u2018This time, I can really become a great commander. A great commander that can really command the entire nation.\u2019His smile became dim.\u2018No, no.\u2019The memories, experiences and information he had weren\u2019t in the level to satisfy him only with being a great general.Grip.He strongly clenched his fist.\u2018At least, I should become a monarch.\u2019From old times, they said to dream bigger.The objective of his past life was becoming a great commander.But he became a spearman.So the objective in this life was becoming a monarch.\u2018If that\u2019s so, won\u2019t I at least become a commander?\u2019On top of that, the starting line in this life was already different.Because he knew what was going to happen from now on.\u2018First\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He remembered the memories from 20 years ago.The first battle.That fierce memory.At that moment, Roan\u2019s face froze.\u201cDamn.\u201dHe remembered.The heartbreaking and miserable first battle.EndTranslator\u2019s note: This the my side project I was talking about.

There was that.\u2019The corner of his mouth slowly rose.He looked at Tane as if he was waiting for something with eager eyes.\u201cAh! Also\u2026..\u201dTane, that was packing his luggage, yelled with an expression as if he had remembered late.\u201cIs there someone that\u2019s familiar with the zone of Ale? Someone that lived for long in that zone, or spent a long time.\u201d\u2018This is it!\u2019Roan took a step and raised his right hand.\u201cI know it well.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dTane frowned.\u2018The guy who was being hit by Pete.\u2019Pete wasn\u2019t the type to get violent with no reason.Then that meant that this guy in front of him had a problem.\u2018Troublesome.\u2019The role of guide was certainly important.If he made a mistake, he could put in danger all of the squad.\u201cDo you really know well the zone of Ale?\u201d\u201cYes! I do. I can go from here, Ellin\u2019s fortress, to Ale village with my eyes closed.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dTane frowned and looked at Roan.\u2018Well, the decision is made by the adjutant.\u2019He didn\u2019t keep thinking for long.In the first place, he wasn\u2019t the type to do so.\u201cFine. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cIt is Roan.\u201d\u201cYou pack your things immediately and follow me.\u201dTane walked and looked at general Lander.\u201cLander. If you finish your preparations go to the drill ground with the guys.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dLander smiled as if telling him not to worry and nodded. Tane hit his chest and went outside.Roan hurriedly followed his back.As he went outside the barracks, a familiar smell tickled the tip of his nose.\u2018The smell of war. No, the smell of death.\u2019Ironware, bonfire, horses, sweat, guys and blood.A smell that had many things mixed.It was a smell he sensed for the past 20 years until he got sick of it.It was a disgusting smell, but somehow a corner of his heart got more comfortable.\u2018The more you get to like this smell, the closer you are to death.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and shook his head.At that time, Tane that was one step ahead of him asked bluntly.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m from a small town in the mountains that\u2019s in the borders of the mountain ranges of Grain.\u201d\u201cGrain mountain range\u2026.. It\u2019s a rough place.\u201dTane talked like that and continued his steps.\u2018A guy from Grain\u2019s mountain range know the zone of Ale well?\u2019A feeling he got deceived.\u2018Well, i\u2019m not the one to get punished.\u2019Tane smirked and looked in front.A middle aged man was looking at the pile of documents.\u201cAdjutant Dosen.\u201dTane approached him and bent down.Middle aged man, Dosen was one of the five aides in rose troop in charge of guiding.\u2018He already picked quite a few.\u2019Tane\u2019s gaze moved next to him.He saw the other guides from the other squads.They already numbered more than 10.\u201cOh. Tane.\u201dDosen smiled brightly and greeted him with his chin.Tane fell to the side and pointed at Roan.\u201cThere\u2019s also a guy in our squad that knows the zone of Ale well.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dDosen moved his sight and looked at Roan.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time seeing him. Is he a newcomer?\u201d\u201cYes. He came yesterday.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a really hot guy.\u201dDosen smirked and looked at Roan up and down.\u201cYou know well the zone of Ale?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan replied without hesitating.\u2018Only the amounts of battles in the zone of Ale amount to twenty. Twenty.\u2019Because of that, the surrounding zone was really clear to his eyes.Dosen nodded at his reply.\u201cThen should I ask you a simple question? What\u2019s the specialty product of Ale?\u201dA not difficult question.\u201cIt\u2019s Barley.\u201d\u201cThen, the biggest village in the zone of Ale?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s of course Ale. Continued by Riven village, Moss village, and Ferbus village.\u201dAnswer without stopping.\u2018All places where had battles.\u2019Roan smiled.Dosen nodded with a surprised expression.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you would even know Ferbus village. It seems like you have indeed lived in this zone for quite long. You are just perfect for a guide.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t really talk about where he came from.Because that wasn\u2019t the important thing.\u2018I find the hiding goblins one step ahead of them.\u2019He looked at the guides that were next to him.\u2018Because of these guys not doing their job properly, many people died.\u2019Of course, he knew well why they couldn\u2019t discover the goblins.This was a safe zone with no monsters at all.So they also thought that there was no way that goblins would appear.\u2018This time, I am blocking them.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.\u201cTake this. Don\u2019t lose it.\u201dTane gave him one spear.Roan nodded and gripped strongly.Grip.A strong and heavy feeling.\u2018Uncomfortable.\u2019His palms were excessively soft and smooth.The injuries and hardened skin he got the past 20 years all disappeared.\u2018It really is starting again.\u2019He smiled bitterly.\u201cThen, I will take my leave.\u201dTane saluted at Dosen and moved his step to the drill ground.Roan took in a deep breath while looking at Tane\u2019s back getting farther away.\u201cDon\u2019t be too scared.\u201dA soldier that was looking at him bumped his shoulder.He seemed to have misunderstood that he was afraid.\u201cThis much is nothing. Last year\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe talked about his tales of heroism for quite a while.\u2018I also have 20 years worth of tales.\u2019When he started to talk, the story had no end.At that time, Dosen put aside the pile of documents.\u201cI think that this many guides will be enough. Mason. As you have the most experience, lead the other guides.\u201dAt his words, the soldier that was talking without stop smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cUnderstood! Just leave it to me!\u201dAn exaggerated answer.A look that made you not able to trust in him at all.\u2018This is why you got ambushed by the goblins.\u2019Roan frowned.\u2018It\u2019s a bit troublesome if the rose squad gets annihilated.\u2019In his past life, the rose squad got annihilated because of the ambush of the goblins.Because of that, all of the surviving soldiers along with Roan, got separated and got enrolled in other squads.\u2018Even if you pile your efforts, it gets taken by other guys.\u2019The stones that came rolling aren\u2019t as appreciated as the fixed ones.And originally, the soldiers that were in this squad already ignored him.And taking the efforts of another was also a frequent thing.Because of that even after he had caught a lot of monsters, he got reprimanded for moving alone.\u2018I can\u2019t live like this in this life.\u2019Grip.He put strength in his hand.\u201cWell! We are also moving to the drill ground.\u201dMason\u2019s loud voice.He moved one step ahead of them and started walking.Roan followed his back and took in deep breaths.\u2018This is the start.\u2019The moment his life starts again.His heart beat faster.Blow.The wind that was blowing carried the smell of the battlefield.EndTranslator\u2019s note: This the my side project I was talking about.

Squad commander Gale was the kind of person that appreciated his soldiers.\u2019He threw himself when the goblins attacked them to at least try to save one more person.Later, when the rescuing soldiers arrived, the corpse that had suffered the most mincing in his body was Gale\u2019s.\u2018That kind of commander needs to live long.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes shined sharply.Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.Gale and his aides started to move towards the field.Roan and the other guides followed Mason and stood in the front.Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.The steps of the army marching could be heard noisily.\u201cWhere did I leave it back then? Right. In that battle, I\u2026\u2026\u201dHe started again.Mason talked without resting having forgotten the role of guide.\u2018Why is it me?\u2019There were many other guides.But why did it have to be him?As he turned his head, he realized the reason.The other guides were walking far away from him.\u2018He was a famous bastard.\u2019They knew the incredible talking ability Mason had.Only that the newcomer Roan didn\u2019t know of it, and fell in their trap.Roan, that couldn\u2019t hold it anymore opened his mouth cautiously.\u201cDon\u2019t we have to check the surroundings in case monsters appear?\u201d\u201cAfter that, I grabbed his wrist and then his legs, huh? What? Monster?\u201dMason, that was even spitting while talking, put on an absurd face.He patted Roan\u2019s back and shook his head.\u201cLook. Newcomer. There\u2019s no need to worry this much. This zone is the safest one. It\u2019s a place where no monsters appear.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cHa. You are much more of a coward than how you look.\u201dMason shook his head while clicking his tongue.Eyes as if he was looking down on him.However, Roan preferred those eyes.Because in that moment, he stopped moving his mouth.At that time, they saw the peak of the mountain that was in front of them.\u2018Rose gorge. No, Ale gorge.\u2019A small gorge you had to pass through if you wanted to reach Ale village.The original name was Ale gorge, but after the rose squad got annihilated, it started to be called as rose gorge with that kind of meaning.\u2018The day that they change the name won\u2019t come.\u2019Roan gripped his spear strongly while gulping dry saliva.Step. Step. Step.The guides feet were near the gorge.\u2018Now\u2019s the time.\u2019Roan called out to Mason.\u201cSir Mason.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe form of this gorge doesn\u2019t seem normal. Shouldn\u2019t we investigate beforehand?\u201d\u201cGorge? Investigate?\u201dMason frowned and looked at Ale\u2019s gorge.And then he shook his head and clicked his tongue.\u201cYou are really a coward. This is a safe zone. There are no things such as monsters.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t there a maybe?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s absolutely not. This is one of the safest places in Rinse kingdom.\u201dMason was confident.He thought that there would be no one that knew the region of Ale better than him, as much as his confidence.\u2018I am a native here.\u2019He turned his head and looked back at the other guides.\u201cHey. This newcomer here says that we need to investigate the gorge. What do you think?\u201dMost of the faces of the guides became distorted.\u201cWhat? Investigate? What dog shit are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou really are a beginner. Beginner.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know a thing, just stay still.\u201dPouring criticism.However, Roan\u2019s face didn\u2019t change in the slightest and had a serious face.\u201cHowever, all of our troop has to pass through that narrow gorge. If there are monsters hiding, we will get a huge blow.\u201d\u201cHa, really!\u201dIn the end, Mason shouted.He pointed at Roan\u2019s face with his index finger to the point he almost poked him.\u201cDon\u2019t say useless things. There\u2019s no way that will happen.\u201dHowever, Roan wasn\u2019t the type to back down right now.Because he knew really well what was going to happen .\u201cThey also say that you have to hit a stone bridge and then cross it. If maybe, there are monsters waiting for us \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dMason raised his hand and stopped him.His face was bright red.Gulp.Roan gulped down dry saliva.The reason Roan could talk back like this was because he didn\u2019t directly belong to him.Actions he could never do to Tane or Pete.Mason glared at him as if he wanted to devour him, and in the end said with an annoyed voice.\u201cIf you want to investigate that much, go alone.\u201d\u201cCan I?\u201dIt was a grave offense to leave his rank.Mason nodded.\u201cGo. I don\u2019t think that there won\u2019t be anything bad by doing something in vain.\u201dWords as if he was mocking him.However, Roan\u2019s face became brighter.\u201cThen, I will be going.\u201dAfter he nodded, he started to move.Running.Legs that couldn\u2019t be seen.Roan left the ranks and ran through the gorge\u2019s peak. Gale that was leading the front squad, noticed him.\u201cWho\u2019s the soldier that left the ranks and is running to the gorge?\u201dDosen looked and then, frowned.\u201cIt seems like a soldier in charge of guiding. I will go and check.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dGale nodded with a disturbed expression.Because of an unauthorized solitary action, he could make the entire squad fall in danger.Dosen looked at Gale and grabbed the reins.Rattle. Rattle.The steps of the horse became faster.\u201cMason!\u201dDosen found Mason.Mason, that was looking at Roan running to the gorge, bent his head.\u201cYes. Aide Dosen.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that bastard? Why did he leave the ranks as he pleased?\u201dFiring words.Mason put a bitter smile and scratched the back of his head.\u201cI wonder, that guy said that there could be monsters hiding in ambush in that gorge, so he said that he needed to investigate.\u201d\u201cIn the gorge? That bastard, doesn\u2019t he know that it\u2019s a safe zone?\u201d\u201cHe knows. But even so, he says that maybe\u2026\u2026.\u201dMason shook his head.Dosen was following with his sight the back of Roen that couldn\u2019t even be seen while frowning.\u201cDamn. Anyways, he was spotted by commander Gale. Maybe later you and that guy will have problems.\u201d\u201cAh! I find it unfair! That guy kept insisting stubbornly\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up. You are the responsible one. You have to get punished because you couldn\u2019t properly control your guys.\u201dAfter Dosen fired those words, he turned back his head.Whine.He heard the burbling of the horse and thought that it was making fun of him.Mason looked at Dosen\u2019s back that was getting farther away and then frowned.\u201cDamn. What is this because of a crazy newcomer bastard.\u201dAfter he spit, he looked back at the Ale gorge.\u201cBut where did that bastard go to?\u201dHe thought that now, he would have to kick him in the crotch once.Roan, that didn\u2019t know that Mason was thinking like this, was approaching the entrance.Shock.The sharp senses he accumulated in the past 20 years were telling him that it was dangerous.\u2018Danger.\u2019A threatening aura could be felt all around the gorge.Roan gulped dry saliva and grabbed his spear.\u2018The only thing I need right now is acting.\u2019He didn\u2019t need to get deeper while facing danger.He needed to return in a moderate amount of time as if he had investigated the gorge and come back startled.\u2018If I just say that there are goblins in the gorge, the end.\u2019A smile appeared in Roan\u2019s face.He leaned in a big tree trunk.A sky without clouds.\u201cRight. The weather was this good.\u201dHe remembered his past memories.The day when they got attacked by the goblins.The sky that day was deep blue.\u201cJust like we have gone in an excursi\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe gulped back the words he was mumbling.Shock.His back was pulling.The hair in his skin raised, and dried sweat flowed through his back.\u2018There\u2019s something.\u2019Inside the forest that didn\u2019t have anything until now.However, he felt a frightening presence.The noise he heard at that time.Chwee.Roan\u2019s face froze in an instant.\u2018Goblin!\u2019It was certainly the cry of a goblin.Chwee.The noise came closer.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading and for your support!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No. Three.\u2019Roan lowered his posture while still leaning on the tree.Blow.The leaves are blown by the wind.Chwee. Chwee.They cries of the goblins get nearer.Stealthily.Roan slowly took out his short sword.An old and sharpless short sword.However, it was enough to complete his role.Chwee.A sound heard nearby.\u2018Now!\u2019Roan quickly turned his body.And then, he saw the goblin right in front of his eyes.Chwee!The guy fell in a state of confusion when he saw Roan appearing suddenly.Roan didn\u2019t let go of the opportunity and quickly stabbed the goblin.Stab.The short sword got stabbed in the guy\u2019s chest.Chwee.And the goblin that dropped down after.Chwee! Chwee!The goblins that were behind got angered at the death of their companion.Those guys rushed on to him.Pull.Roan pulled the short sword that was in the chest of the goblin and threw it.Thump.The running goblins couldn\u2019t dodge it and rolled in the floor.An ideal opportunity.Roan quickly rushed on to them and stabbed them with his spear.The spear stabbed the head of the goblins in succession.Chwee.He disposed three goblins in an instant.But even so, his face wasn\u2019t good.\u2018It\u2019s a disaster.\u2019His palm of the hand hurt.Just because he moved his spear twice, the skin seemed to peel off.On top of that, it didn\u2019t even have strength behind it.\u2018I really became a complete novice.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and picked up the items of the goblins.\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I will have to take your necks.\u201dHis hand that moved at the same time.Slice.The head of the goblins rolled in the floor.Roan tied the dirty and rough hairs of the goblin and grabbed it.Drip. Drip.Green blood flowed from the sliced part.And then, the leaves of the mountain shook fiercely.\u2018Mmm!\u2019The wind was was still the same.\u2018It\u2019s them!\u2019If it wasn\u2019t for the wind, then only one option remained.The other goblins were coming down to look for their comrades.Roan quickly ran towards the exit of the gorge.Chwee! Chwee!Angry noises from the goblins could be heard behind.However it was impossible for them to chase him.He had already come out the gorge and entered the plains.He could see the rose troop far away.Roan shook the thing in his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s the goblins! Goblins are waiting in ambush!\u201dHe shouted loudly but no one heard him.He was still too far away.*****Mason, that was waiting for Roan to come, frowned when he looked at Roan coming out of the gorge.\u201cWhy is that bastard like that?\u201dIt seemed like he was yelling something, but he couldn\u2019t hear him.\u201cAnd what is that thing he is holding?\u201dA thing that seemed to be like water melon.\u201cHe seemed to have picked a fruit in the woods.\u201dAnother guide that was next to him said with an impudent voice.Mason looked at him as if it was stupid.However, as Roan got closer, Mason\u2019s face froze.Because his yells were heard more clearly.\u201cIt\u2019s the goblins! Goblin!\u201dOnly then he realized that it wasn\u2019t a watermelon he was holding, but the head of a goblin.Mason looked at the other guides with dumbfounded faces.\u2018It\u2019s really a goblin?\u2019Especially, Mason was several times more surprised than the others.\u2018For a monster to appear in the zone of Ale! It had never happened until now!\u201dHe shook his head like that while opening his eyes abruptly.This wasn\u2019t the time to be like this.He ran to the squad following from behind..\u201cGo, goblins!\u201dShouting with all of his strength.At that time, Gale that was cautious of Dosen yelled while he lit up with joy.\u201cWhat?! Is that true!\u201d\u201cIt is! Look over there!\u201dMason pointed at the gorge with his finger.Everyone\u2019s sights moved.Roan, that was running with his hair fluttering.And a faint voice.\u201cIt\u2019s a goblin. Goblins are waiting in ambush.\u201dGale\u2019s eyes became sharp.\u201cThe thing in his hands is the head of the goblin.\u201dHis right hand extended to the skies.\u201cSquad hold. Battle formation.\u201dAt that moment, all of the adjutant yelled with all their strength.\u201cSquad hold! Everybody battle formations!\u201d\u201cBattle formations!\u201dThe aides yelled and they each went to their respective squads.Gale still looked at the gorge calmly in the middle of this noise.\u201cDosen.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDosen that was nearby approached him.Gale pointed at Roan.\u201cBring that soldier. I need to hear the story.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAfter Dosen replied like that, he made eye signs to Mason.\u201cYes! I will bring him!\u201dMason replied nervously and moved his feet.\u2018Damn. Am I the only one that\u2019s going to get punished?\u2019His face showed a hint of nervousness.He made fun of the guy that said he was going to investigate.He was absolutely confident that there weren\u2019t going to be any monsters\u2018A goblin!\u2019But the guy he had made fun of appeared with the head of a goblin.Mason bit the lower parts of his lip.\u2018I need to coax him well so he doesn\u2019t say unnecessary stuff.\u2019His feet that was running towards Roan became faster.*****\u2018Pant. Pant. Pant.\u2019Roan felt like dying.He ran with all his strength because he feared that the rose troop would enter the gorge, so his chest felt like exploding.He wanted to rest a little after informing that the goblins were waiting in ambush, but he didn\u2019t have the leisure to do so.\u201cCommander Gale is looking for you.\u201dMason grabbed Roan\u2019s wrist.In the end, Roan couldn\u2019t even take a breath properly and got dragged towards Gale.At that time, Mason whispered in a low voice.\u201cForget everything I said to you back them. Understand? Actually, I also thought that there was a high chance for an ambush. So I got responsible for it and sent you to the gorge. Huh? Right?\u201dRoan didn\u2019t even have the strength to talk back.Mason got anxious as he saw that Roan wasn\u2019t showing any reactions.\u201cAre you listening to me? Huh? Answer me.\u201d\u201cWhew. Understood.\u201dRoan let out a deep breath and nodded.Only then did Mason\u2019s mouth shut.The two of them moved quickly and soon reached in front of Gale.\u201cOh! Come here!\u201dDosen exaggerated without any need to.Roan slightly ignored him and bent towards Gale.\u201cWhat was in the gorge?\u201dAbruptly taking out the main subject.\u201cIt\u2019s an army of goblins.\u201d\u201cThe numbers?\u201d\u201cThere were at least a thousand in the side of the mountain I searched. And normally, thinking that when you ambush, you will have another squad in the other side of the mountain. So thinking about it, it would be more than 2000.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dDosen frowned.The number of soldiers the rose troop had was 800 in total.It wasn\u2019t even the half of the goblin\u2019s army.\u201cAre you certain?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201dRoan replied unhindered.Because he had already experienced it in his past life, there wasn\u2019t even a tiny bit of mistake.\u201cMmm. What a pain.\u201dGale shook his head.The number was also it, but the location they were hiding was also a problem.The goblin army had already took over both sides of the mountains. They were in a really vulnerable position to attack when they were below.Then, Dosen interrupted.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to go round the gorge and go directly to Pedian\u2019s plain? We will get 2 days late but we can evade an unnecessary fight.\u201dAnyways, the objective of the rose troop was reuniting in Pedian\u2019s plain with the other squads and subjugate the monsters together.There was no need to confront the goblins.Roan, that was listening still got surprised and yelled.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201dHe remembered the miserable and cruel past.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What could a newcomer soldier know\u2026\u2026 Tch.\u201dClicking his tongue.However Roan wasn\u2019t planning on backing off at this point.He looked fixedly at Gale and slightly bent his head.\u201cSir commander. Do you know the similarities of the fight in Kali in May, year 176; Mendorf defense in August in 183, Roman\u2019s suppression tactic in October in 185, and the fight in Fiore in March in 191?\u201d30 years at much, and 10 years not too long ago fights.Gale frowned.\u2018Similarities?\u2019At that time, Mason laughed awkwardly.\u201cHahaha. This, this bastard. What are you talking about? What\u2019s the Mendorf defense, and what\u2019s the Roman suppression tactic? You picked that up somewhere and are talking nonsense.\u201dAt his words, Dosen added.\u201cIt\u2019s also the first time I hear about those fights. Ahem.\u201dReally unpleasant faces.He opened his eyes telling him to stop his nonsense.In the other side, Roan\u2019s face was still imposing.\u2018It\u2019s normal for them to not remember fights that are not related to our kingdom.\u2019It was also the same for him.However, as 7 years from now appears an unparalleled genius strategist called Ian Phillips, the study of strategy and tactics boomed.The generals and soldiers studied in the big and small battles in history, and Roan too concentrated in studying for a while.And because of that, he could remember all of the battles he had named.But fortunately, Gale could understand all of the fights Roan said unlike Mason and Dosen.\u2018The fight in Kali was a fight between our Rinse kingdom and Estia empire, the defense of Mendorf was the battle between Estia empire and Byron kingdom, the Roman suppression tactic was the fight that happened in Russia that the farmers rebelled, Fiore\u2019s fight was the fight between our Rinse kingdom and the monsters.\u2019Four battles that were different in time, nature and the adversaries.\u2018There\u2019s a common point between these battles?\u2019Roan said in a low voice as he saw that Gale wasn\u2019t getting it.\u201cMassacre.\u201dAt that moment, Gale\u2019s eyes became big and round.\u201cAh!\u201dA low exclamation.He nodded as if he was a little excited.\u201cRight. Massacre. It was massacre.\u201dThe four battles were all different in the adversaries, time, and nature but the winning side had massacred the losers.\u201cIn the battle of Kali, the people from Estia massacred our Kali\u2019s castle residents. In the defense of Mendorf the as Byron royalty left the Mendorf castle and fled, the people from Estia massacred the residents of Mendorf\u2019s castle residents.\u201d\u201cRight. In the case of the Roman suppression tactic, the farmer side that revealed all got massacred. And in the fight of Fiore, as our kingdom retreated, the monster army roamed through the zone of Fiore and attacked 7 big and small villages and massacred its residents.\u201dA conversation that dropped well.Gale looked at Ale\u2019s gorge with a frozen face.\u201cThen what you are thinking about\u2026\u2026 Perhaps?\u201dRoan slowly nodded.\u201cYes. If we leave the goblin army like this, the nearby towns people will get massacred.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dJust looking at the four battles he mentioned, the probabilities of it happening was high.Gale looked at Roan with a surprised expression.\u2018It\u2019s also it that he investigated the gorge alone, but even memorized the battles that not even Dosen knew of. A really amazing kid.\u2019In the other side, Dosen\u2019s face that was looking at the side, was clearly contorted.\u2018Damn. For someone like me that ate blades as meals for 10 years to not know of it. What\u2019s the identity of this bastard?\u2019A soldier that ate 20 years worth of blade meals.That was Roan.But of course, there was no way that Dosen would know of that.Gale wanted to keep testing the newcomer soldier he had in front of his eyes.\u201cThen, we move after defeating the goblin army?\u201d\u201cYes. Only then will the people around Ale\u2019s zone be safe.\u201d\u201cBut those bastards built a camp in the mountains. We are not in a situation that it\u2019s easy to confront them.\u201dHe talked with the meaning that if there was a method, to spill it fast.Roan looked at Gale and smiled dimly.\u201cDo you remember the battle that happened in Pelan mountain in February in year 200?\u201dThe battle in Pelan mountain was the one that happened just the previous year.Gale obviously nodded, and Mason also did.However, the only one that read what Roan was thinking of was Gale.Gale smiled brightly and clapped.\u201cAh! Attacking with fire!\u201dRoan slowly nodded.\u201cYes. Attacking with fire.\u201dThe Pelan mountain battle occurred in Pelan\u2019s mountain boundaries that was between Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom.The Byron empire from back then moved faster than the Rinse kingdom and occupied the higher grounds, but the Rinse kingdom blocked the entrance and put the mountain on fire.\u201cRight. Back then, the guys from Byron left the burning military camp and fled.\u201d\u201cYes. As those guys fled to the road we opened in purpose, they got annihilated after we ambushed them.At Roan\u2019s words, Gale clapped.Clap. Clap. Clap.\u201cGood, really good! What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Roan.\u201d\u201cGood. Roan. Your merits today are really big. And your knowledge is also outstanding. I will definitely remember your name.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dRoan bowed.He didn\u2019t ask for a big prize from the start.Although he discovered the hiding goblins and proposed a good tactic, he was still a newcomer soldier.\u2018If I accumulate more merits, my rank will go up and I will be able to have my own soldiers.\u2019He wasn\u2019t planning on acting hurriedly.But because of that, he also wasn\u2019t willing to relax.\u2018I will render great merits in this battle.\u2019He put more strength in the hand gripping the spear.Although he didn\u2019t have the same strength and stamina as before, he still had the 20 years of experience.He was confident on facing 4 or 5 goblins at the same time with this condition.Then, he heard Gale\u2019s voice.\u201cPrepare the fire. Make a trap and bait them over there.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAfter Dosen replied loudly, he grabbed the reins.He looked at Mason and Roan and swinged his hand.\u201cThe soldiers that are in charge of guiding also return to your respective squad.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dMason and Roan that replied at the same time.Dosen glared at Roan for a moment and turned back.\u2018Did I get marked by Dosen?\u2019A bitter smile appeared on his face.Originally, he needed to have cold eyes and a crooked attitude to be considered normal.However, Roan that had the experience of 20 years of eating blades as a meal just saw him as someone cute.\u201cWe will be leaving then.\u201dMason bumped Roan and bent down to Gale.Roan too saluted Gale and went back to the 13th squad.Along with the sound of steel, a hot excitement could be felt in the places.\u2018Is it the first battle?\u2019A smile appeared in Roan\u2019s mouth.That was the smile of a man mixed with expectation and excitement.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!

A battle so suddenly.\u2019He thought that there wouldn\u2019t be any battles until they reached Pedian\u2019s plains.Because it was a safe zone with no monsters.\u2018It will be a pain to take care of the guys.\u2019The 13th squad was only composed of newcomers.It wasn\u2019t only a thing or two that he had to pay attention to.\u201cOliver! You take care of the newcomers!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dOliver replied in high spirits and lined the newcomers, including Pierce in front of him.They were in a dumbfounded state because of the sudden battle.Oliver hit the helmets of the newcomers with his big hands.Dong!

It\u2019s you?\u201dHe wanted to reprimand him, but at that instant he saw the face of the soldier.It was Roan that was returning after having completed his duty.\u201cYou too, get a hold of yourself!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRoan replied with strength and then, shut his mouth.A face with shining eyes and a strong will.He was in no way in a state of nervousness or fear.\u2018Look at this guy.\u2019Oliver looked at Roan with a little surprised face.\u2018Also at that time when he was packing his things, it smells like he is experienced.\u2019However, it was impossible.All of the 5 newcomer soldiers including Roan, were all beginners with no battle experience.At that time, the sound of the drums was heard.Boom. Boom. Boom.At the same time, the cavalry and archers charged towards the gorge of Ale.Dududududu.The sound of the earth shaking.The other troops followed them.The cavalry moved from the left side of the gorge to the right to cause tremors in the mountain and take the attention of the goblin army.During that time, the archers prepared to fire.\u201cFire!\u201dAt the orders of the aides, the flame arrows covered the sky.Shoot shoot shoot.The entrance of the gorge became a sea of fire in an instant/Burning!The path of fire devoured the peak of the mountain through the wind.The only place the fire didn\u2019t reach.The west side that the archers didn\u2019t shoot on purpose.The rest of the squads pierced in there.\u201cRo,Roan. Will, will we be fine?\u201dPierce called out Roan with a really scared face.Roan clicked his tongue.\u2018For this kind of guy to become the duke of Rinse kingdom.\u2019This coward became the duke.It meant that the spear skills of Reil Baker were that outstanding.\u2018I also learnt a few tricks.\u2019Although he wasn\u2019t a formal disciple like Pierce, he too had some things taught.And with just that, he could climb all the way to the first spear corps from the 7th.\u2018Although I was only a squad commander.\u2019Spearmanship without the basics was the same as a toothless tiger.Even if he learnt a really strange spearmanship, he wouldn\u2019t be able to show even the tenth of it.\u201cRoan. Are you also scared?\u201dPierce looked at Roan that wasn\u2019t saying anything while blinking.Roan hit Pierce\u2019s chest and smiled.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. You were always first in the spearmanship tests.\u201d\u201cTha, that was only in training.\u201dPierce\u2019s face became to the point of crying.Roan shook his head.\u2018Your talent is a waste. Bastard. Your talent is a waste.\u2019Even the instructors had said that his talent for the spear was the best they had saw in years.However, he was too coward and shy so they didn\u2019t know if he was going to be able to use it in real battles.\u2018I really admire viscount Reil Baker.\u2019He brought up this kind of coward all the way to becoming duke.\u201cJust follow my back.\u201dRoan hit Pierce\u2019s shoulder and glared towards the gorge.Ale gorge that was covered by flames.Dudududu.The ground shook.Break.The trees of the gorge shook roughly and the woods fell.Chwee.

Clash!The sound of metal clashing hit his eardrum.Pierce and the other newcomer warriors followed the back of Oliver and shrinked their body nervously.Compared to him, Roan kept maintaining the ranks in the squad and observed the progress of the battle.\u201cDamn! There a dirty lot!\u201dPete yelled after stabbing the spear in a running goblin and cursed.Roan shook his head.\u2018This isn\u2019t the end of the goblin army.\u2019His eyes directed to the other side of the gorge.\u2018There is also another army hiding. They will come running to help looking at the fire.\u2019Then, the number of the goblin army will increase.\u2018We have to decrease the number of them the most we can.\u2019Roan gripped his spear and glared at the goblins.Then, Tane\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThey are getting through. Newcomers in the back be careful!\u201d\u201cI will take care of them!\u201dOliver replied quickly and cut off the necks of the goblins.A trustable appearance.Certainly, the rose troop was an outstanding one.\u2018I can\u2019t just let a troop like this one to get annihilated.\u2019Then, a goblin appeared in front of Roan.\u201cNo, no!\u201dOliver noticed it too late and wanted to thrust his spear, but it was too late.\u2018Damn! At times like these, the newcomers become stiff!\u2019Preoccupied eyes.However, Roan calmly extended his spear and pierced the throat of the goblin.Grr.A falling goblin.A concise but a cool one.However, Roan\u2019s spear didn\u2019t stop there.Spat.The spear twisted like a snake and passed through Oliver\u2019s hip.His objective was the goblins that were targeting Oliver\u2019s back.Thrust.The tip of his spear pierced the chests of the goblins without stop.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver got surprised at the spear that passed next to him and stammered.Roan pulled out his spear with a calm face.\u201cBe careful.\u201dShort words.At the same time, he passed through Oliver and stood in front of the newcomer soldiers.Swiiiish.The blade of his spear drew a line of light and slashed through the space.\u2018Where are you goblins going!\u2019Roan\u2019s spear danced.Grr. Grr.Three goblins consecutively fell.It was obvious for the newcomer soldiers, but he got caught in the eyes of the other 13 squads too.\u2018What is the identity of that guy?\u2019\u2018A newcomer doesn\u2019t fear at all?\u2019The soldiers of the 13 squads looked at Roan and clicked their tongues.At that time, Tane that was looking at the situation made hand signals to Roan.\u201cRoan! You come to the front! The newcomers will be taken by Oliver!\u201dIt was a waste to use his skills as a defense for the newcomers.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dRoan and Oliver yelled loudly and charged through.Roan that comes to the front of the 13 squads.Pierce that was looking at his back, showed a surprised look.\u2018Roan. What happened to you?\u2019The spear skills he remembered from Roan wasn\u2019t that much.On top of that, he had never acted so bluntly, because he also had a timid side like him.\u2018You are like a completely different person.\u2019In only one day, Roan completely became another person.Grr.During that time, Roan\u2019s spear cut off the neck of another goblin.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Die!\u201d\u201cThe front is getting pierced! Support them from the left and right!\u201d\u201cThe injured ones to the back! The injured ones to the back!\u201dThe goblin army were also in a state of disarray, but the voices that were heard nonstop took out your attention.\u201cUhhhhh.\u201d\u201cI, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201dHalf of the newcomers of each squad were trembling while spacing out.Among them, the only normal one was Roan.Thrust!Roan thrusted the tip of his spear in the head of a goblin.Meanwhile, the other goblins were also charging at him.\u201cHmph!\u201dRoan snorted and hit the chin of the goblin with the end part of his spear.Crush.Chwee.At the same time, he pulled out the spear that was inserted in the head and swung it in an arc, and the goblins that had fallen back had their necks cut off.A natural action, just as flowing water.\u2018Look at this guy.\u2019Tane that was facing the goblins next to him, discovered him and shined his eyes.He was amazed by Roan\u2019s spearmanship.However, Roan felt like dying.\u2018Damn. I feel like dying because the palms of my hands hurt.\u2019His palms were really limp.And because of that, he couldn\u2019t even grip and swing as he pleased.Originally, the beauty in spearmanship was in being able to attack and defend at the same time without stopping.However, right now, the flow was stopping now and then.\u2018After the battle ends, I will have to focus on training my spear skills.\u2019He had thought that in his past life, he had quite excellent spearmanship, but even so, being commander in the first squad of spearmen was the best he could achieve.If he wanted to aim for something higher, he needed better spear skills.\u2018To do that, I have to reach the level I had in my previous life the fastest possible.\u2019Spearmanship he had refined for 20 years in real battles.All of those things were already in his head, anyways.\u2018And then go to the territory of Potter. If I go there\u2026\u2026..\u2019He was planning to go the Potter territory after this subjugation of monsters ended.\u2018There\u2019s future in that place.\u2019A smile appeared in Roan\u2019s face.Even then, his spear moved without stopping.Slice.The heads of the goblins fall consecutively.The situation became more favorable to the rose squad little by little.But then, a dust cloud appeared in the other side of the gorge.\u2018They are coming!\u2019Roan\u2019s shape became sharp.The goblins that were hiding at the other side of the gorge were coming.Now the aspect of the battle will completely change.\u201cCavalry! Cavalry! To the south! To the south!\u201d\u201cArchers! Load!\u201dThe orders of the commanders became desperate.The horse shoe line up crumbled suddenly.\u201cSpearmen hold your positions! Kill the bastards coming down from the mountains!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAn answer filled with determination.Although the number of the goblins coming down were many, it wasn\u2019t to the point they couldn\u2019t handle it.They were in a state where they were largely spread.\u201cNewcomers! Get a hold of yourselves! Now, we don\u2019t have the leisure to take care of you!\u201dOliver\u2019s yell.Behind him, a newcomer soldier that was slightly thrusting his spear was trembling.They were also feeling it.That the strong line was having it more difficult.At that time, Roan came in the eyes of Pierce.The appearance of swinging his spear with soft movements and slashing down the goblins.Each time, the goblins fell in the ground with their throats having been cut off.\u2018Roan.\u2019A guy that was no different to him until a day ago.That guy was making great contributions as if he had become a ghost of war.\u2018Me too\u2026\u2026 Will I be able to do it?\u2019Compliments he heard in the training camps until his ears hurt.And actually, he never failed in placing first in the spear tests.However, if they are placed in front of a monster, your body will get stiff.\u2018I\u2019m, i\u2019m a coward.\u2019Pierce\u2019s face became teary.Then, a goblin charged to him after having pierced the line up.\u201cDamn!\u201dOliver extended his spear late, but it didn\u2019t reach.The goblin that reached Pierce in an instant.Chwee!The guy rushed on to him and made some noise.But that was all.Thrust.The tip of a spear was thrusting the neck of the goblin.\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe owner of the spear was an half absent minded Pierce.As his life got threatened, he instinctively thrust his spear.The speed of the spear was so fast that the goblin charging died without even knowing that he had been thrust by it.Oliver that was looking at him yelled while smiling brightly.\u201cYou do well! Just keep it up!\u201d\u201cYes? Yes\u2026\u2026.\u201dOf course, replying in a bewildered state.\u2018Do, do I need to do it?\u2019The feeling when he thrust the neck of the goblin still remained in the palm of his hand.It wasn\u2019t hard.His heart beat faster and his pressure rose.\u2018I, I also have to do it!\u2019The teary face slowly returned to normal.Pierce charged through and supported the weakened lines.At the same time, he slashed his spear to the goblin that was charging in to him.Slash.The head of the goblin fell to the ground.\u2018Pierce bastard. Finally getting a hold of yourself.\u2019Roan, that was facing the goblins in the front of the 13th corps smirked and shook his head.Right now, he was a newcomer soldier that no one recognized him, but he was the guy that was picked with the best talent in all of history of Rinse kingdom.\u2018I can\u2019t be losing to you.\u2019Pierce was an 18 year old newbie.He too was an 18 year old newbie in the eyes of the others, but he had the experience of the past 20 years and was a 38 year old skilled spear man.Roan\u2019s spear drew a line of light and danced.\u2018But is that bastard still far away?\u2019As he slashed his spear non stop, his eyes were still directed at the mountains.There was a guy he was waiting.\u2018He was certainly the same size as me.\u2019The guy in his memories.He was the leader of the goblin army and was as tall as himself.Originally, goblins didn\u2019t surpass the chest height of humans.\u2018He used dual blades.\u2019The guy held swords in both of his hands and roamed the battlefield ruthlessly.The number of soldiers of the rose troop that fell by his hands would be several tens.Slash.At Roan\u2019s spear, two goblins lost their heads and fell.\u201cGood! Keep going like this!\u201d\u201cWe take care of it the fastest and go to the west!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe soldiers that rode the momentum shouted.At that time, the guy appeared in the east road of the mountain.\u2018He came!\u2019The leader of the goblin army Roan was waiting for.It wasn\u2019t that a commander had appeared.Chweee!It made a rough and angered cry.At that moment, the goblins that were being pushed back charged in more furiously.Just like their hero had finally arrived.\u201cWha, what\u2019s that?!\u201d\u201cIs that a goblin too?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that an orc? Orc?\u201dThe soldiers of the rose troop that discovered the leader of the goblins got perplexed.Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018It would be better if he was an orc. His skills are a level higher than that of the orcs.\u2019He wasn\u2019t the leader in vain.However, the army of the rose troop that had no way to know this each lifted their weapons and charged in.Slash.The neck that fell with that horrible noise wasn\u2019t that of the goblin leader, but of the rose troop soldiers.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHuuh?\u201dAt that moment, he remembered the perplexed faces of the soldiers.\u2018Right. It\u2019s not easy for normal soldiers to confront it!\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and kicked the floor.His body moved towards the goblin leader.\u201cHey! Where are you going!\u201dTane\u2019s voice rang behind him.\u2018I\u2019m going to get his head!\u2019Words he couldn\u2019t say.Roan\u2019s spear shone with the sunlight.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His strength is certainly good.\u2019Roan clenched his teeth because of the strength that was transmitted through his hands.If it was prolonged, a not favorable fight.\u2018With my current state, I can only exchange a few blows.\u2019But even so, the reason he charged in so confidently.\u2018I will show you one deadly attack.\u2019The many spear skills in his memories.However, he couldn\u2019t use them all.The strongest spear skill he could use right now.\u2018The three stances Pierce taught me.\u2019Pierce\u2019s spearmanship originated after he got taught by Reil Baker, and devised for the battles they confronted together.Because they confronted normal soldiers, it was still powerful even if it didn\u2019t use mana.\u2018I have only one chance. More than that is hard for me.\u2019Thinking about the state of his palms, the strength of his grip and his physical strength, he could only execute this stance once.\u2018I have to look for the perfect opportunity.\u2019Roan\u2019s spear shook and sliced off the air.Chwee!The goblin leader showed an annoyed expression at the spear that brandished him without stop.It raised his dual blades so high to try to cut off the spear.The body that was exposed in an instant.\u2018Now!\u2019Roan gripped harder and forcefuly pulled back his spear.Rip.The pain of his palms tearing.However, Roan\u2019s movements didn\u2019t falter.Spat!The spear that was pulled back to his waist, stabbed onto the body of the goblin leader.Chwee!It got momentarily perplexed, but he snorted and quickly struck down with his blades.Swing.Right before the two swords met the spear.Thong!The stiff spear bent like a snake.At the same moment, the spear rose to the skies.Spat!The spear passed by the two swords and rushed into the neck of the goblin.Chwee?The goblin leader opened his eyes roundly at the spear that was bending in an impossible angle.Stab!Roan\u2019s tip of the spear pierced through the neck of the goblin.Grr.Growling sounds and the falling goblin leader.Roan pulled the spear in his throat and frowned.\u201cKugh.\u201dA painful sound was heard.He looked down at his palms.A mess.His skin was peeled off and blood flowed.His limp palms couldn\u2019t stand the fierce and strong spear skills of Pierce.\u2018It\u2019s really a mess.\u2019Of course, in his past life, he couldn\u2019t execute it more than 5 times consecutively.No, even doing it 5 times made his entire body hurt.It was a skill that was hard for your body, but it was that much effective.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan looked at the goblin leader that was collapsed in the floor and smiled.Not a bad harvest for the first battle.Looking at the big hole in his throat, he admired Pierce\u2019s talent more.\u2018For a stance that was created in the middle of resting to be this much.\u2019It was at that moment when he was admiring the difference in abilities.The stance he barely executed after having his palms ripped, Pierce executed it without even shedding a drop of sweat.\u2018In this life I will certainly close that gap.\u2019Roan determined once again and after cutting off the neck of the goblin leader, he extended it up to the skies.\u201cSpearman Roan from the 13th squad! I cut off the neck of the goblin leader!\u201dA loud voice.Even if he didn\u2019t do that, the soldiers that were looking at their fight raised their weapons and yelled.\u201cWaaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cRoan!Roan!Roan!Roan!\u201dThe atmosphere of the battlefield changed in an instant.The goblins that lost their leader, didn\u2019t know what to do.The morale was so low it reached ground, and they just looked to run away.In the other hand, the morale of the soldiers of rose troop was as high as the sky.Slice! Chop!Chwee! Grr!At the attacks of the rose troop, the goblins fell without resisting.After Roan tied the head of the goblin leader in his waist, he returned to the 13th squad.\u201cYou bastard! How can you run away as you please!\u201dTane yelled as if he was waiting for it.However, there was a faint smile in his face.And that was because he had witnessed the scene of Roan piercing the neck of the goblin leader.Roan bent down.\u201cLooking at my allies falling down, I just charged in on my own. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dTane wanted to say one more thing, but shook his head in the end.\u201cBe more careful next time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan bent his head and fell to the back.The battle was already ending.The goblins couldn\u2019t even charge to where the 13th squad were.Roan took out some bandages while looking at the battle.\u201cWant me to help you?\u201dA newcomer soldier just like him, that had white skin and big eyes asked with a preoccupied face.Roan lent him the bandages as if he came just in time.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cWhy, with this much.\u201dThe white skinned and big eyed soldier embraced the spear with his armpit and bandaged him.He bandaged him so meticulously Roan thought that he would be able to hold the spear immediately.\u2018He is quite familiar\u2026\u2026\u2019He was familiar.A feeling he was forgetting of something important.Roan tried to remember who was the man that was in front of him.However, the newcomer soldiers that survived in his past life were only him and Pierce.Because of that, he couldn\u2019t remember the other newcomers.\u2018But why is he so familiar?\u2019Roan that fell in his thoughts.Then, the bandaging ended.At that moment, his big fingers were caught in his eyes.\u201cAh!\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.\u201cHuh? What happened? Is the bandage somewhat discomfortable?\u201dAsking because he was surprised.\u2018He\u2019s identical.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes shook.The silhouette of a person passed by dimly through his eyes.\u2018This guy was the oppa of that person.\u2019The face of a girl that filled his entire head.Roan shook his head and just put on an awkward face.He smiled brightly and lent out his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.

Squad line up!\u201dThe adjutants yell with all of their strength.The battle in the east ended, but the west still remained.The goblins that come pouring from the other side of the mountain.\u2018Well, now that their leader died, that side will also crumble.\u2019The rose troop was going to win without any difficulties.After a while, the battle ended with the overwhelming victory of the rose troop just like Roan had predicted it.The time of retrieving the corpses and healing the wounded.\u201cThe newcomers this time are amazing!\u201d\u201cYeah! You were called Roan and Pierce? You killed it out there.\u201dThe 13th squad was filled with an uproar.Roan\u2019s and Pierce\u2019s outstanding merits were followed up with lines of compliments.It was rough, but Pete, that evaluated skillful people highly hit Roan\u2019s back.Hit!\u201cYou bastard! I completely saw you in a new light! Hahaha!\u201d\u201cKugh.\u201dRoan frowned and bent his back.\u201cAhem. Did I hit you hard?\u201dPete laughed awkwardly and scratched his cheek.Roan raised his hand as if it was okay and nodded.Then, Tane approached him.\u201cThe skill you used to slay the leader of the goblins. Did you also learn that at the training camp?\u201dIt was a skill he had never seen until now.At Tane\u2019s question, obviously the 13th squad and the 12th and 14th squad that were next to them raised their ears.Roan slowly shook his head.\u201cNo. Because of a certain coincidence, I got to learn it from a retired soldier.\u201d\u201cRetired soldier? For the spearmanship of a retired soldier to be that much. And they said that the world was wide and there were as powerful people as sand grains.\u201dTane just looked at him fixedly.\u201cAnyways, you rendered big merits in this battle and saved the lives of many people, so I will let it pass this time but\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet it pass my ass.\u201dA cold voice intruded in.Tane and Roan turned their head and looked at the owner of that voice.\u201cAdjutant Dosen.\u201dTane bent his head.Dosen said with a cold expression.\u201cRoan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLeaving your ranks in the middle of a battle is grave offense.\u201dA cold voice.Actually, he was already in a bad mood because of what happened before the battle.\u2018A newcomer dares to ignore the words of an adjutant?\u2019Because of Roan, only he became a stupid person for Gale.\u201cEven if you had the permission of Mason, leaving your ranks while marching is also a grave offense.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dRoan bent his head.He knew the reason why Dosen was acting like this.\u2018His pride must have gotten hurt.\u2019At times like this, it was better to stay low.If he corrected what happened, only the adversary would feel worse.Dosen continued speaking.\u201cGale squad commander let it pass, but it\u2019s something that I, that organize and command the soldiers can\u2019t forgive.\u201dThe soldiers of the 13th troop that were looking at the situation showed a nervous face.\u201cIf it was like usual, you would have to get whipped 50 times, but taking into account that you discovered the goblins hiding in the gorge and as you have slain the enemy leader, I will deduct your salary for 5 months and add an extra month of training.\u201d\u201cYes. I will follow your orders.\u201dRoan bent down.Dosen glared at him for a moment, and then rode his horse and returned to his original place.Pete looked at Dosen getting farther and asked.\u201cWhat kind of accident did you make in the front for you to get punished instead of receiving a reward after having slain the enemy leader?\u201dRoan just smiled bitterly instead of replying back.Tane looked at his expression and intruded to the conversation.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear adjutant Dosen\u2019s words? He left the ranks in his own twice.\u201dAt those words, Pete shook his head as if he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cNo, but even so, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s enough of a reas\u2026\u2026 Now that I look at it, were you also the one that discovered the hiding goblins?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan slowly nodded.The soldiers of the 13th squad put again a surprised expression.\u201cYou are really a thing. A thing.\u201d\u201cYeah. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we would all have gotten annihilated.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a benefactor in our lives!\u201dA noisy atmosphere.The soldiers of the 13th squad tried to purposely raise up the mood for Roan, that got punished.However, Roan didn\u2019t care much about that.\u2018I won\u2019t be using money much, anyways.\u2019Actually, it wouldn\u2019t be a thing to get big money if he decided to.He remembered all of the big things that would happen for 20 years from now on.And there were cases they discovered mana runes, mineral mines, ore mines, and lost treasures.\u2018If I need them later, I have to make one stop before anyone else and make it mine.\u2019There was no need to gain money immediately.The punishment to get an extra month of training was something Roan wanted to request for.\u2018Stamina, muscles, skin of the palms of my hands and movements. All of these are a mess.\u2019Just like the words, the level of a newbie.He needed training.However, the individual training time was really scarce in group movements.And it that situation, Dosen thankfully commanded him to get extra training.\u2018He gave me time to train my body, so this isn\u2019t a punishment, but a prize.\u2019A smile appeared in Roan\u2019s face.Then, the voices of the adjutants were heard again.\u201cSquad line up! Squad line up!\u201dThe soldiers that were resting all over the place, started to stand up and lined up.Roan too, wanted to line up in the back side of the 13th squad, but a familiar voice rang from behind him.\u201cRoan. You have to go and take your role.\u201dThe owner of the voice was Mason.Roan didn\u2019t move in his own accord and looked at Tane.\u201cGo.\u201dTane swiftly shook his hand.Roan nodded, and then moved his steps.As he stood in the front, he saw the adjutants such as Gale and Dosen.\u2018Cold.\u2019Dosen\u2019s eyes were still cold.As the soldiers that were in charge of guiding gathered together, the rose troop started to march again.Step. Step. Step.Sound of footsteps that shake the earth.Roan, Mason and the other guides, got in the Ale gorge first.The gorge that was originally filled with forests, was now a barren hill.\u2018This place was filled with corpses before.\u2019A miserable scene.However, it was different in this life.\u2018I have just made my first step.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018What comes next is more important.\u2019The moments of choice will keep coming.And each time, he would need to pick the best and different option.But the fortunate thing was that his first option wasn\u2019t bad at all.Behind Roan was following the rose troop that originally should have been annihilated.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Look at his hands.\u201d\u201cIt seems like they only teach you how to set a barrack in the training camp.\u201d\u201cEy. That\u2019s not it. Look at the other newcomers. It\u2019s only that guy who is skilled.\u201dThe soldiers of the 13th squad talked among themselves while looking at Roan that was the only skilled one among the newcomers.\u201cYou have to pull more this way.\u201dRoan helped Pierce and Glenn and taught them how to put on a barrack.\u201cThanks.\u201dThe two of them laughed embarrassedly and scratched their heads.Roan didn\u2019t say anything and just focused on setting the barrack.Bang.With the last hammering, the huge barrack got completed.\u201cRoan! You are the best, the best!\u201d\u201cA really special one entered.\u201d\u201cDid you see the expressions of the other squads? They were really envious. Kukuku.\u201dThe soldiers got in the barracks with their luggage and raised their thumbs.Roan just bent his head without saying anything and grabbed his spear.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dTane approached him and frowned.\u201cI\u2019m going to do the extra training.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe nodded along with a low exclamation.It was a punishment given by the meticulous Dosen, so he could be watching him from somewhere.If he skipped for even a day, he would be given an impetuous order.Tane looked at the spear and shook his head.\u201cYour palm is a mess, will you be fine?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s because Glenn\u2019s bandaging is excellent.\u201dRoan raised both of his hands and smiled.\u201cEven so, focus on training your strength rather than your spear skills, being aware of adjutant Dosen.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201d\u201cAnd give me your luggage.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan bent.Tane hit Roan\u2019s shoulder like that and entered the barrack.\u2018Should I run for now?\u2019Roan stretched softly and started to run while holding his spear.Clank. Clank.The armor makes steel noises.The armor that only covered him the important parts was so low and weared that many parts were oxidized and even had small holes.Roan, that was running the outer parts, saw Dosen.\u2018It seems like I really got marked properly.\u2019Dosen approached him while riding his horse.\u201cYou aren\u2019t just planning on running like that?\u201d\u201cAfter running a few more laps I will train my spear skills and do strength exercises.\u201dRoan replied while running.Dosen nodded and pulled the reins.Wheee.The horse slowly stops.\u201cTrains like that for two hours everyday.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan yelled to Dosen\u2019s back that was getting further.\u201cWhew!\u201dHe ran out of breath because he was talking while running.\u2018My stamina is really a mess.\u2019To run out of breath after running this much.Ruan clenched his teeth.\u2018At least, there won\u2019t be any trouble until Pedian\u2019s plain.\u2019Thinking about his memories, he couldn\u2019t think of anything in particular after the rose troop got annihilated in Ale gorge.Then, this was the right time to raise his strength and stamina.Clank. Clank.Roan\u2019s feet got faster.*****The rose troop rested in Ale village for a day and started to march towards Pedian\u2019s plain.Roan didn\u2019t miss the extra training even while marching.And not only that, he even participated in the group trainings.\u201cYou will fall like that.\u201dSo much that Pete had to persuade him.However Roan, pushed himself to the limits.He knew how much strength and stamina he could raise with the 20 years of experience.\u2018If I get to that point in an even shorter time, I can look for a higher position.\u2019The 20 years from now on will change.Among that was strength training, stamina training, agility training, and skills training.\u2018The training from 20 years from now on is much more effective than in this time.\u2019Roan evaded Dosen\u2019s eyes and trained his strength and stamina with the methods from 20 years from now on.And because of that, in these short 15 days, his arms and legs became a little harder than before.But just because of that, there was no one in the 13th squad that recognized the change.No, there was only one person that noticed this small change.\u201cRoan. I think that your body got better.\u201dThe person that was blinking with an honest expression was Pierce.Roan slowly looked at Pierce\u2019s face and said inwardly.\u2018His sight is really excellent.\u2019One of the many abilities Pierce had.He had a good sight. No, precisely speaking, he had a good ability to see things.And because of that, even if they were in the same situation, place and saw the same people, the information he could obtain was much bigger.The ability to see things others can\u2019t.That was one of the driving force for his ghost like spear skills.\u2018Is there one day until we reach Pedian\u2019s plain?\u2019Today was also the last day he could train to his heart\u2019s content.Roan reported to Dosen and got out of the camp.Because Dosen prohibited him from training inside the camp.If he followed the rumours, it seems like he had heard it from Gale.And because of that, he could only do the extra training outside of the camp and the first days, Dosen came out to check on him.However, as he saw that Roan didn\u2019t show even a trace of disobeying, he left him alone.Roan came outside of the camp and straightened his back.\u201cWhew.\u201dMaybe it was because it was the entrance of Pedian\u2019s plain, but there was a wide plain in front of his eyes.\u2018First, running.\u2019If he didn\u2019t want to get injured, it was important to heat your body.Roan started to run towards the plain.The weeds that were as long as his waist, were moved by the winds coming from the west.The sound of the plants rubbing his skin tickled his ear.Roan was enjoying the strange feeling and ran to a place farther than he had thought.\u201cDid I run too much?\u201dThe entrance of the camp was too far and was seen really small.He changed directions and started to run towards the rose squad camp.The weeds shake because of the wind.Movements and sound that\u2019s no different as before.However, Roan frowned.\u2018Something\u2019s weird.\u2019His eyes became sharper.The movements of the weeds that are in his left are rough.Roan gripped his spear.\u2018There\u2019s something!\u2019He glared at the weed that was shaking roughly.Stab.Then, the the weed separated to the left and to the right.Roan stopped the spear he was going to stab by instinct and frowned.Because the thing that appeared out of the weeds was out of his expectations.\u2018Why are these guys here\u2026\u2026.?\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They, they took away mom and dad. Boohoo.\u201dThe girl couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and started to cry.Roan patted her head and frowned.\u2018Bad guys?\u2019He searched in his memories.But there was no particular case.\u2018Originally, the rose troop gets annihilated and doesn\u2019t pass through here.\u2019It meant that it was completely unrelated to him.Roan looked at the crying girl and asked gently.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cSob. Sob. Lia.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a nice name. Lia. Lia, are you the oldest here?\u201dLia wiped off her tears with both of her hands and nodded.Roan pointed towards the rose troop camp that was far away.\u201cIf you go there, there will be a lot of tough uncles. Will you go there and tell them what happened in your village?\u201d\u201cThen, those uncles will save our mom and dad?\u201dFrom deep within her eyes could be seen a light of hope.Roan couldn\u2019t ignore that hope.\u201cWell. Of course.\u201dOnly then did the crying children stop crying.Roan started to walk towards the camp in the front, while guiding the children.\u201cRoan!\u201dBefore he could get in the camp, a scary yell was heard.It was Dosen.\u2018This bastard dares to come after idling there?\u2019He was outside because he was thinking that perhaps\u2026He was planning on punishing him if he was idling without him knowing.However, he couldn\u2019t discover Roan nearby at all.\u2018Right. You got well caught.\u2019Deserters have the punishment of having to live hiding for life.He thought that he wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to fulfil that punishment, and that he would be hiding somewhere.What kind of punishment should he give, it was at that moment when he was thinking that when he saw Roan coming into the camp.\u201cJust where have you bee\u2026\u2026 Huh?\u201dHe was about to yell at him when he saw the children lined up behind him.Dosen frowned and looked at Roan.\u201cWhat are those kids?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan explained everything that happened in a calm way.Dosen\u2019s face contorted.\u201cSomeone attacked the village and took away their parents?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRoan nodded with his face having darkened.\u2018He wouldn\u2019t be making up an excuse, right?\u2019It was Dosen that didn\u2019t feel good towards him.If he resorted to violence in vain, only the children would be at a loss.Dosen that was thinking for a while, hit Roan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cGood. Take the kids and go to commander Gale.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dRoan asked with a surprised expression.Dosen\u2019s eyes twitched.\u201cIt means that innocent villagers are in danger. So we have to rescue them.\u201d\u201cRi, right.\u201dRoan laughed awkwardly and nodded.Dosen said as if he was just spilling it.\u201cYou thought that I was going to resort to violence?\u201dRoan didn\u2019t talk back.Dosen looked at the children that were about to cry at any moment and continued saying.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I don\u2019t like you. But i\u2019m also a soldier of Rinse kingdom. And it\u2019s my duty to protect the people of the kingdom.\u201dRoan just nodded instead of replying.Dosen smiled at the kids once and went towards the camp.\u201cKids. Let\u2019s go.\u201dRoan took Lia and the other children and followed his back.When they got in the camp, commander Gale approached them with a well disposed smile.\u201cOh dear. These little kids are having it really hard.\u201dHe sat Lia and the children and patted their heads.They being seated just like chicks was really cute.Gale ordered the soldiers to bring hot milk and bread.\u201cEat slowly.\u201dA gentle voice.The kids were looking at their surroundings, and then grabbed the bread.Munch.The children that eat a big bite as if they were really hungry.Gale just looked at them.Lia, that finished her bread, drank some milk and looked at Gale.\u201cIs uncle the leader here?\u201d\u201cRight. Uncle is the leader.\u201dGale nodded along a bright laugh.Lia returned the cup and asked with a begging expression.Then, are you going to save mom and dad?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course.\u201dGale nodded and carefully continued to say.\u201cHowever, you have to tell me what happened in the village. Can you tell me?\u201dAt his words, Lia nodded.\u201cWe were playing hide and seek in the woods when about 20 dangerous and big uncles appeared. And suddenly\u2026\u2026.\u201dTears appear in her big eyes.Gale wiped off her tears with a handkerchief and carefully asked.\u201cDid those uncles kill the townspeople?\u201dLia nodded.\u201cThe chief, uncle James and uncle Michael all died.\u201dThick tears drop.\u2018These small things went through such a thing.\u2019Gale thought that in regret but still asked a question.\u201cThen what happened?\u201d\u201cThe big uncles tied the people with a rope and took them. And we were still hidden in the bushes when that happened.\u201dGale nodded with an admirable expression.\u201cYou did well. Really well. Uncle will ask you two more things. First, what\u2019s the village Lia lived in?\u201d\u201cHotton village.\u201d\u201cHotton village\u2026\u2026.\u201dGale frowned.\u2018It\u2019s not familiar.\u2019A village he had never heard of.Then, that meant that it was a really small village.\u201cThen, the last question. Where did the bad uncles go with the villages people?\u201dLia thought for a while and answered with a confident voice.\u201cTo the east, they went to the east Trum village. They certainly went that way.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dAlso an unfamiliar place.It had a high possibility that it was as small as Hotton village.\u2018Then, even Trum village may be in danger.\u2019Gale frowned and stood up.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dDosen, that was listening next to them, replied in a voice so low as to the children couldn\u2019t hear it.\u201cAren\u2019t they thieves or slave merchants?\u201d\u201cThere is a high possibility.\u201dGale nodded and grabbed Dosen\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAdjutant Dosen.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI will leave this to you. First, find some soldiers that know about Hotton village and Trum village, and take 5 cavalry men and chase them.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dDosen slightly bent his head.At that time, Roan that was observing the situation, slightly raised his right hand.\u201cCommander Gale.\u201dGale looked at him as if what happened.And Dosen was the same.Roan looked at the two of them and continued to say.\u201cI know about Trum village.\u201dAt that moment, Gale and Dosen put on surprised expressions.\u201cYou know about Trum village?\u201dRoan slowly nodded.\u2018Trum village. I can\u2019t not know about it.\u2019A bitter smile appeared on his face.\u2018Because there\u2019s the travias spear.\u2019The travias spear that was going to be discovered in 17 years from now on.\u2018Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, I was planning to go there after the subjugation of the monsters ended and i\u2019m heading to the Potter region.\u2019However, he was unfamiliar about Hotton village.On top of that, there was no case he remembered aside from the travias\u2019s spear one.Then, he heard Gale\u2019s voice.\u201cGood. Then Roan, you will take the role of guide.\u201dA situation that every minute was precious.It was much faster to take Roan rather than asking all of the soldiers.Dosen approached Roan and grabbed his shoulders.\u201cDo you know how to ride a horse?\u201d\u201cYes. I know.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dDosen nodded with a surprised expression.There weren\u2019t many normal soldiers that knew how to ride a horse.However Roan, that dreamt of becoming a great commander, slowly learnt cavalry.\u2018I also rode the horse for 10 years.\u2019He couldn\u2019t say that he rode it outstandingly, but he was on a level he didn\u2019t fall back.\u201cThen, we will be going.\u201dDosen bent towards Gale got out of the camp.Roan quickly followed his back.\u2018It\u2019s something that I haven\u2019t experienced in my past life.\u2019Chills ran down his spine.A completely different feeling compared to when he confronted the goblins in Ale gorge.On top of that, the opponents weren\u2019t monsters, but humans.Roan gritted his teeth and gripped his spear.\u2018Let\u2019s hope that this choice is followed by good results.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems like he rides the horse better than us?\u2019\u2018What kind of spearman rides the horse better than those from the cavalry?\u2019The soldiers from the cavalry truly admired him.They sticked their chests closer to the horse and kicked the horse.Dudududu.A noise that shakes the earth and a rough recoil.A hundred cavalrymen ride across the plain.Roan guessed where the Hotton village should be, based on the Trum village he knew.\u2018She said that Trum village was in the east of Hotton village.\u2019If Ria\u2019s words were true, then there was only one place where Hotton village could be located.A humble zone located near the entrance of Pedian\u2019s plain.\u2018There\u2019s nothing more important than water.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and kicked the horse.The west wind that blew freshly made him feel like it was rubbing his back.\u2018Our destination isn\u2019t Hotton village, but the middle point of Hotton village and Trum village.\u2019If it was according to Gale\u2019s, Dosen\u2019s and his guesses, then the guys that attacked Hotton village would be going to Trum village.\u2018If my memories don\u2019t fail me, there should be a thick forest in the west of trum village.Roan\u2019s eyes shone and asked for light.\u2018To rescue the villages people safely\u2026\u2026..\u2019He bit his lower lips and pulled the reins.The head of the horse turns to the east.Dosen, and the cavalrymen that were following behind him, also pull the reins.And there was no one that put on weird faces.\u2018It seems like in front of here, are those bastards.\u2019They trusted Roan.No, they could only do so.Because they didn\u2019t even know to what kind of place they were going to.The chase continued for a long while.After they passed the bushes that were as tall as their waist, some small hills and a small and big forest appeared.The cavalrymen ran through the thick forest roughly.Then, Roan that was charging in fiercely, pulled the reins and lessened the speed.\u201cAdjutant Dosen.\u201dHe, who completely stopped, turned back to look at Dosen.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dDosen approached him while still being on top of the horse.Roan pointed to a hill that was outside of the forest.\u201cIt seems like we have caught the tail of those guys.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dA low exclamation flows.\u201cWe finally caught them.\u201dThe place Roan pointed to.There were the bastards they wanted to see that much.Dosen made hand signs to the soldiers that were behind him, and dismounted the horse.They tied the horses in the trees behind them and hid on some big bushes.\u201cThere are about 50.\u201dAt Dosen\u2019s words, the first commander Karon frowned.\u201cThere are about 100 caught people. It seems like they are slave merchants.\u201dThe 2nd squad commander Pierson, clenched his fists.\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t seem like the only attacked village was Hotton village.\u201dAt his words, everyone nodded.Dosen\u2019s face became dark.\u201cIf we just attack them like this, the villages people will be in danger.\u201dThere was also some probability that those guys would run leaving the villages people behind. But there also were opposite cases.Where they threaten the lives of the villages people and they can\u2019t do a thing.\u201cIs there a method to rescue the villages people safely?\u201dDosen asked while looking at everyone else.However, among the hundred plus soldiers, no one named a clear plan.In that while, the slave merchants disappeared to the other side of the hill.\u201cAdjutant Dosen.\u201dThen, Roan carefully raised his hand.\u2018It\u2019s you again?\u2019Dosen looked at Roan.Every time they got pushed in a difficult situation, this guy came up.In the investigation of Ale gorge, the battle against the goblin army. And this time too.\u2018The results were good.\u2019Now that the situation turned out like this, he could expect something.\u201cYeah. It seems like you have a good method?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good, but I do have something.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dDosen was prepared to listen.And all the other cavalrymen also listened attentively.Roan took in some breath and continued to say with a calm voice.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge forest in the west of Trum village. It\u2019s a forest with a lot of trees. We reach there before them and ambush them.\u201d\u201cAmbush?\u201dDosen frowned and asked back.Roan nodded.\u201cYes. We hide in the forest and when the slave merchants appear, we make a surprise attack and cut in the middle of the villages people and them.\u201dIt was a good strategy.If it turned out that way, they could save the lives of the villages people and also kill the slave merchants.However, there was a big problem.\u201cIt\u2019s a good strategy. However, will we be able to reach the forest before them?\u201dThere was only one road.To overtake them was impossible.At Dosen\u2019s words, every cavalrymen looked at Roan.Roan drew in the floor with a branch.\u201cLook well.\u201dFirst, he drew two circles.\u201cThe left circle is Hotton village, and the right one is Trum village. Our position is here, and those bastards position is here.\u201dRoan made two points between the two circles.The slave merchants were certainly nearer to Trum village.\u201cIf you look at it this way, it certainly seems like they can reach Trum village in an instant. But actually, they can\u2019t.\u201dRoan drew a horizontal line between Hotton village and Trum village.\u201cIt\u2019s the Abyl stream. Although it is humble, it\u2019s quite wide and deep, so it\u2019s impossible to cross it.\u201dThe made a point in the lower side of the horizontal line.\u201cThere\u2019s a bridge in here. They will cross this bridge and go to Trum village. It\u2019s a road that is quite long.Karon frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s the only road that leads to Trum village?\u201dAt his words, Roan smiled and nodded.\u201cMost only know about that road.\u201dAt that moment, Dosen\u2019s eyes shine.\u201cWhat you are saying right now, sounds like you know of another road.\u201dRoan looked at Dosen\u2019s eyes and replied.\u201cYes. I know of another road. And a much faster one at that.\u201dAt that moment, everyone\u2019s faces brighten.\u201cGood! Then it won\u2019t be a problem to overtake those bastards!\u201d\u201cWe will be able to ambush them.\u201dThe cavalry men clench their fists and like it.\u2018What\u2019s the identity of this guy?\u2019Dosen got surprised once again.This region was one that he, and even commander Gale was unfamiliar with.But for an 18 year old newcomer soldier that just finished his training to know of a shortcut.\u2018As far as I know, this guy isn\u2019t even from this region\u2026\u2026..\u2019The more he knew about him, the more surprises he got.\u2018I will have to properly talk with him.\u2019A feeling he was hiding something from him.He was really curious, but right now, he didn\u2019t have the leisure to ask him that.\u2018First, let\u2019s save the villages people.\u2019They had to take care of the slave merchants first.The thing with Roan came after that.\u201cFine. Take lead.\u201dDosen stood up and grabbed the reins.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan replied and at the same time, all of the cavalrymen got on the horse.Clop. Clop.The horses weren\u2019t heading to the east, but to the north.As soon as they got out of the forest, a big hill appeared.Dudududu.Roan hit the horse and ran towards the hill.The opposite direction to where the slave merchants were heading to.\u2018There\u2019s a shortcut here.\u2019Dosen and the cavalrymen stick their chests closer to the horse.The hundred soldiers run while cutting through the air.After they ran for a while, the scenery changed.The hill disappeared, and a fresh course of a river appeared.Whine.Roan pulled the reins and got in front of the flowing water.\u201cIt\u2019s the Abyl stream.\u201dDosen that approached him said.\u201cI would believe it if it was a river.\u201dHe looked at his surroundings and said.\u201cWhere\u2019s the shortcut?\u201dRoan pointed towards the Abyl stream with a calm face.He said something they didn\u2019t want to hear, nor want to believe.\u201cWe will cross this Abyl stream.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where\u2019s that bridge?\u201dDosen frowned.Roan moved towards the stream.Splash.The water filled up to his waist in an instant.\u201c5 years ago, a bridge used to be here, in the place i\u2019m standing right now.\u201dDosen\u2019s face turned red.\u201cAre you telling me that we should cross a bridge that disappeared?\u201dRoan shook his head.\u201cThe bridge is still here.\u201dA confident voice and an imposing face.Dosen frowned.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dRoan smiled faintly and replied.\u201cThe bridge is still here. Only that the water in this stream rose.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dAt that moment, a low exclamation flowed from the mouths of Dosen and the cavalrymen.Roan continued speaking.\u201cThis bridge is under the water. But fortunately, it\u2019s still fine. If you walk correctly, you will be able to cross this stream.\u201dHe pointed at the calmly flowing Abyl stream.Dosen and the cavalrymen looked at Roan with a surprised expression.\u2018How does he know about this?\u2019\u2018Is it a place he had visited before?\u2019\u2018Even if that is the case, is it possible to know of a bridge that\u2019s under water?\u2019Many questions popped.Roan shrugged his shoulders and urged.\u201cAre you going to keep standing there?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dOnly then did Dosen and the cavalrymen get ahold of themselves and dismounted the horse.They grabbed the reins and stood in front of the riverbank.\u201cThe bridge is really slippery because it\u2019s deep under water. And there may even be some broken parts. You have to tap it with the tip of your spear and cross it slowly.\u201dRoan moved the spear in his right hand.Everyone gulped dry saliva and nodded.\u201cThen, I will take the lead.\u201dRoan took in deep breaths and moved his steps.Ziip.The slippery rock bridge is felt under his feet.He tapped the bridge in front of him with the tip of the spear and slowly moved his feet.And the water soon reached his waist.\u2018It\u2019s fine. That time, it even reached to my chest.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018There\u2019s no need to be nervous. You already crossed it once.\u201917 years from now on, Roan crosses this place with a person he thought to be a friend.\u2018Son of a bitch.\u2019That bastard he thought as a friend.Now that he thought of his face, he started to curse him.\u2018The guy that snatched the travias spear from me.\u2019Roan had made many wrong choices in his past life, but the worst of them was entrusting the spear to the person he thought as friend.\u2018That bastard took this to the Byron kingdom and received a title of count.\u2019That guy roamed the battlefield with the spear and got a nickname called spear ghost.\u2018Even so, he didn\u2019t become a match to Pierce, that was called as spear god.\u2019Thinking about it like this, he once again felt Pierce\u2019s might.Splash.The water that reached his chest made his thoughts go away.\u2018Let\u2019s focus on crossing this stream.\u2019Roan got a hold of himself and moved step by step.Splash. Splash.The west wind that blows freshly raises little waves.Roan and the hundred cavalrymen crossed the Abyl stream with a face full of nervousness.If someone that didn\u2019t know about this saw it, they would think that Abyl stream was really shallow.\u2018The moment I reach ground it ends.\u2019The people that were crossing the stream felt that they were on top of the death rope.The suffocating time flowed slowly.Step.Roan was the first to reach the riverbank.Drain.His body was really wet.Pheew.The war horse shakes his head and body.The water drops that splashes.\u201cKugh.\u201dRoan turned his head and shakes his hand.Meanwhile, Dosen and the cavalrymen slowly reached the riverbank.They were as wet as him.They wanted to clean the water in the clothe, no, in the armor and the weapon but they didn\u2019t have the leisure to do so.Dosen quickly got on the horse and grabbed the reins.\u201cLet\u2019s see the scenery next time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan replied shortly and after he got on the horse, he started to ride in the front.Dudududu.A sound that shakes the earth.The cavalrymen grabbed the reins and bit their lower lips.\u2018It\u2019s done now.\u2019\u2018We caught up with those bastards.\u2019They sticked their chests to the horse and kicked it.Dudududu.The hundred soldiers ride towards Trum village.*****\u201cWow, the trees are really dense.\u201d\u201cYeah. Not even sunlight passes through.\u201dJoey and Luce moved in the narrow forest road and checked their surroundings.It was so quiet that it was even gloomy.They grabbed the reins and looked back.The fifty plus allies follow them with their horses.Joy\u2019s and Luce\u2019s sights are directed beyond their allies.\u201cHehehe.\u201dA laugh comes on itself.The people that were tied just like tied fish.The rope that was tightly tying the wrists and the waists followed up the other person.And like that, the people that were tied walked with their heads low.Even at first glance, the number surpassed the 100\u2019s.\u201cWe should have to come to this region in advance.\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no security nor hunters. Kukuku.\u201dJoey and Luce looked at each other and laughed.They were the heads of the slave merchants that operated in the western parts of mountain zones.\u201cIt was a pain to confront hunters in the western parts of the mountains.\u201dJoey smacked his lips and shook his head.The temperament of the hunters in mountain regions was really fierce and their skills were really good, so it wasn\u2019t easy to confront them.Because of that, every time they hunted people, they got out with a loss.In the end, Joey and Luce left the mountain regions and went to the plains that were in the middle-north of the kingdom.\u201cIf we get this much every time, we will become rich in no time.\u201d\u201cKukuku. Let\u2019s buy a residence in the capital.\u201dThey talked like that and kept guiding the horses.Clop. Clop.Clopping sounds break the silence of the forest.Next to the narrow forest road, the woods opened.The woods shake with the wind.Pheew.One of the horses of a slave merchant shakes its head and makes rough movements.\u201cWhy are the horses like this so suddenly?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dJoey and Luce pass through the woods and pat the head of the horses.Then, a bush that wasn\u2019t shaking with the wind shakes roughly.Paat!Inside the bush, a long spear stretches.Stretch!\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dMany slave merchants that were riding the horses got pierced in the sides and fell.Whine!The horses that got scared raised the front legs and cried roughly.\u201cWha, what is it!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening!\u201dJoey and Luce looked back and yelled.Shang!The remaining slave merchants took out their swords from their waists.A group appeared from the bushes as if they were waiting for it.They got in and took place between the slave merchants and the tied people.\u201cWho, who\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe people that were tied asked with a small voice.The one that was in the front of these people smiled brightly and replied.\u201cWe are the rose troop that belongs to the 7th corps of the Rinse kingdom. We came to rescue.\u201dThe owner of that voice filled with strength was Dosen.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cWe, we are alive!\u201dThe tied people smiled brightly and yelled.In the other hand, Joy\u2019s and Luce\u2019s faces contorted.\u2018Dam! People from the kingdom!\u2019\u2018Where the hell did they come from?\u2019Joy frowned and moved one hand stealthily.He feels the bow that was in the saddle with the tip of his fingers.\u2018I fire an arrow and escape.\u2019The 50 subordinates would buy time for him.Grip.Grip.Joey grabbed an arrow and quickly tensed the bow.At that time, a crushing sound that was heard near his ears.Splutter!A horrible sound.The spear that came flowing by cutting the ear pierced Joey\u2019s head.\u201cHuk!\u201dLuce that was next to him, looked at Joey\u2019s crushed head.Split.At the same time, another group appeared after splitting the bush.\u201cWhew. Fortunately, it hit.\u201dA teen that laughs after letting a short sigh.He looked at the dumbfounded Luce and pulled out the spear in Joey\u2019s head.Crush.Joey\u2019s head that had half of it\u2019s shape, got completely crushed.\u201cResist or surrender?\u201dA voice as if he was secretly asking.\u2018The decision will be taken by adjutant Dosen anyways.\u2019The teen that smashed Joey\u2019s head.It was Roan.EndTranslator\u2019s note: There\u2019s been a change. That\u2019s that Gale is a troop commander, and Tane a squad commander. That being Troop>squad. Although i\u2019m too lazy to change it all, at some time, it will become like that lol.

You take the villages people and go to Trum village.\u201dAn exhausted face could be seen from the villagers.They needed a break first.Ched put on a troubled face.\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact position for Trum village.\u201d\u201cYou can ask that to the vill\u2026\u2026\u201dDosen talked up to there and closed his mouth.The villages people couldn\u2019t take the role of guiding.\u2018I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019Dosen\u2019s eyes look at Roan.\u201cRoan\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan, that was taking care of the condition of the villagers, replied and approached him.\u201cYou move together with the 5th squad.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAt Dosen\u2019s words, Roan bent.A smile appeared in his mouth.\u2018I will be able to go and find the travias spear.\u2019If he was to go to Bason village together with Dosen, he would have to leave the spear for after that.\u2018Well, it wouldn\u2019t matter anyways.\u2019The travias spear would only be found after 17 years, anyways.And of course, the one that had found it back then was himself.Soon, Dosen and the cavalrymen under him took the merchant slaves and went to the north.When they couldn\u2019t be seen anymore because of the dense forest, Ched called Roan.\u201cRoan. You take the front.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan replied shortly and moved his steps.It was obvious for him, but the other cavalrymen also didn\u2019t ride their horses.They had given it to the village people whose condition was bad.Clop. Clop.The sound of the horse steps was heard nicely.They got out of the dense forest, and after they walked out for a bit more, they saw a little village in the borders of a hill.\u201cIt\u2019s Trum village.\u201dRoan said after turning back to look at Ched.\u201cIt\u2019s a smaller village than what I have thought.\u201dChed seemed to be surprised at the village he saw.\u2018And because of that, no one could think that the travias spear would be in a place like this.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and moved his feet.As they approached the village, some guys with big bodies appeared.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThey seemed to be surprised at the soldiers that were armored and with weapons that appeared at the village.\u201cHello. I\u2019m the commander of the 7th squad of rose troop that belongs to the Rinse kingdom.\u201dHe shook his hands and explained everything.\u201cAh! For that to\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe guys got surprised and put on a regrettable face.They guided them inside the village along a bright smile.\u201cWe will prepare you something to eat.\u201dWith the order of the head of the village, some women prepared food and drinks.They knew that if it wasn\u2019t for the rose troop, they would also have been taken by the slave merchants.\u201cWe are really thankful. Really thankful.\u201dThe people that seeked safety after they got in the village sent thanking messages to the soldiers of the rose troop.\u201cNo, no. We only did the obvious thing.\u201dChed shook his hands and smiled brightly.In that time, Roan met Lia\u2019s parents and told them the things Lia had done.\u201cYou say that the reason we were able to get free was because of Lia?\u201d\u201cYes. Lia asked our commander to save the villages people. She is a really intelligent and brave kid.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Lia\u2019s parents put on an expression that seemed to have all of the happiness in the world.Tears gathered in their eyes.Then, Ched\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cAfter one hour of break, return to the squad.\u201dAt his words, Roan stood up.He approached Ched and whispered in a low voice.\u201cI have come to Trum village in a really long while. Can I go to sightsee the village for some time?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dChed nodded.\u2018He should have been bright around this zone because he had already come here.\u2019And there also were the merits Roan had accomplished, so he pleasantly permitted him.\u201cCome after you slowly look at it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan bent his head and moved his feet towards the inner side of the village.\u2018Small villages like this one won\u2019t change much even after a long while.\u2019He had visited Trum village after 17 years.But the Trum village from back then wasn\u2019t that much different to the Trum village he was seeing right now.He pretended to be looking at the place, and moved towards the north.\u2018It\u2019s really amazing.\u2019Roan said after looking at a huge tree that was outside of the fences in the north.The tree was so thick that three men had to surround it by holding hands, and it was twice as tall compared to the other trees.On top of all, every time the wind blew and made the branches and the leaves collide, it tickled his ear.Feeling strange.Roan placed his hand on the strong and huge tree that was in front of him.A rugged feeling.Roan moved around it while still having his hand on it.Touch.In the tips of his fingers, he felt a fine bump.\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes shone.He touched the bum with the tip of his fingers and stuck close to the tree.He scratched the tree with his fingers.At that moment, a piece of wood falls in his palm.A piece of wood that was as long as an adult arm.In the exterior, it seemed to be an ordinary piece of wood, but actually it was a really hard piece of stone.Roan put his hand on the place the piece of wood fell.A secret place inside that huge tree.What came inside of that was a strange shaped oxidized stick.\u2018I found it.\u2019Roan put that stick in his waist and put back the fallen piece of wood in the tree.Along with the grounding noise of the stone, the tree trunk recovered its original shape.Roan evaded the eyes of the other people and sat down the tree.A stick that was smaller than an adult\u2019s arm.It was as thick as a wrist, and although it was originally black in colour, now that it was oxidized, it was seen as a bright red.\u2018The travias spear that was said to be made with a dragon\u2019s magic metallic scale, dionium.\u2019Roan grabbed the end of the stick and squeezed it as if he was squeezing the laundry.\u201cUgh.\u201dHis face turned red and veins pops in his wrists.After he put in all of his strength for a long while, a strange sound was heard.Creeak.The sound of the oxidized parts breaking.The tip of the spears separates in half and turns.Clink.Along with the sound of saw tooths running, the tip of the spear separated.Cheeng.At the same time, the sound of metal was heard and the blade of a sword raised.Excluding a handful of length, sharp blades raised all around the stick.Just like you are looking at a blade without defensive systems.However you saw it, you didn\u2019t see it as a spear.\u2018It\u2019s useless if you don\u2019t know how to use mana for this guy.\u2019Only by inserting mana does this guy show it\u2019s original appearance.Roan smiled bitterly and twisted the tip of the spear in the opposite side.Cheeng.Along with the sound of metal, it became to be a stick that was covered in bright rust.Roan stood up from the place with a satisfied expression.\u2018Wait for a moment. When I learn how to use mana, I will use you without spare.\u2019He put the travias spear in his waist and smiled.Roan\u2019s sights are directed to the south.\u2018Potter region. If I go there, my life will change.\u2019However, now wasn\u2019t it.If he went now, it would be meaningless.\u2018Let\u2019s wait until summer.\u2019Until then, he bulks up his body while subjecting the monsters in Pedian\u2019s plain.It was better to keep accumulating merits and have a stable position.\u2018I still remember the subjugations of the monsters in Pedian\u2019s plain freshly.\u2019A battle that was really good to accumulate merits.At least, he would be able to get promoted to squad commander or sub squad commander.\u2018Good. Step by step, let\u2019s walk it diligently!\u2019Now, he won\u2019t make stupid choices.In his past life, those stupid choices accumulated and he lived a mess of a life.At that time, one thought passed through his head.\u201cAh!

For spearmanship, archery, swordsmanship\u2026\u2026. And if the strategies and tactics are perfect, all the more better.\u2019Many memories filled his head that enabled him to do all of those things.He only needed to work hard.An intense effort and without stop.\u201cWe are moving!\u201dChed yelled after he got up the horse.Roan followed his back and gritted his teeth.\u2018The monster subjugation in Pedian\u2019s plain is a really intense battle.\u2019Surprise attacks, night raids, ambushes and fire attacks mess all of the battlefield.\u2018I render great merits and retire for a while.\u2019If he wanted to go to the region of Potter, it was an unavoidable choice.However, he couldn\u2019t just retire as he pleased.He had to render merits that would catch the eyes of a squad commander or the generals.\u2018Let\u2019s think about that when we return back.\u2019The fortunate thing was that he had left quite a good impression on squad captain Gale.Thinking about many things, he reached the camp of the rose troop.Dosen and the other squads still didn\u2019t come back.\u201cYou have done well.\u201dGale, that received the report, ordered a new order along a satisfied expression.To take the children safely to their parents.\u201cOppa. Are mom and dad really safe?\u201d\u201cOf course. They are resting in Trum village right now.\u201dRoan calmed down the children and got out of the camp.When they reached Trum village again, the sun was almost setting.\u201cLia!\u201d\u201cMom!\u201dA little girl that runs to her mother\u2019s embrace.Many reunions between the parents and their children happen all around.Ched hit Roan\u2019s shoulder while looking at that.\u201cWe are fighting with our lives on the line to protect that. Right?\u201dRoan nodded silently instead of replying.\u201cI\u2019m really thankful. Thank you.\u201d\u201cOppa! Thank you!\u201dThe villages people and the children ran to them and bent their heads.A happy and proud smile appears in the faces of Roan, Ched and the soldiers of the 5th squad.When they started to give them food to express their gratitude, they quickly rode their horses.\u201cEat it with the children.\u201dChed left some cool words and kicked the horse.Roan and the 5th squad followed his back and waved their hands towards the children.\u2018Let\u2019s not forget this feeling. The reason i\u2019m trying to become a great commander and a monarch is not solely for me to eat and live well. It\u2019s for everyone to live happily.\u2019His objective becomes a little hard.Now he wasn\u2019t only planning on becoming a monarch, but a good one.It would be hard, but not impossible.\u2018I will be able to do it if I work hard as hell.\u2019Determined light shines in his eyes.That was confidence and convincement that he could do it.*****Dosen and the other squads returned only after a day had passed.Gale had already organized everything before they came and at the same time, mobilized the army.But of course, he didn\u2019t forget to compliment Dosen and the squads.\u201cRoan.\u201dWhile they were moving, Pierce approached him.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious about something.\u201dRoan looked at Pierce\u2019s big eyes and nodded.Pierce continued talking with a bright face.\u201cPedian\u2019s place is an important place even for our kingdom, so how could monsters frequent there?\u201dPierce\u2019s words were true.More than half of the crops harvested in Rinse kingdom came from Pedian\u2019s plain.So it was difficult to believe that there would be monsters frequenting that important place.\u201cThose things gather in Pedian\u2019s plain to look for things to eat.\u201dThe monsters that suffered hunger in winter in the boundaries of the kingdom, comes to the Pedian\u2019s plain in spring to look for food.A real pain in the ass for the Rinse kingdom.Only by subjugating the monsters would they not miss the season for the crops.And because of that when it becomes spring, every year there would be a large scale monster subjugation in Pedian\u2019s plain.At that time, Pete that was one step in front of them, butted in.\u201cYou know really well.\u201dRoan simply smiled.Pete continued to say with a more serious face.\u201cThis year\u2019s subjugation will specially be much harder. Do you know why?\u201dAt his words, Pierce shook his head.\u2018For a guy that doesn\u2019t even know why monster appear in Pedian\u2019s plain, that\u2019s a much more difficult question.\u2019Roan put on a bitter smile.He looked at Pete\u2019s eyes and replied.\u201cIt\u2019s because two months ago, the Byron kingdom succeeded in subjugating the monsters.\u201d\u201cOho.\u201dPete exclaimed with a surprised expression.Then, Pierce butted in.\u201cAnd why? What does the subjugation of the Byron kingdom have something to do?\u201dThe reply came from Pete\u2019s mouth instead of Roan\u2019s.\u201cThe guys of the Byron kingdom pushed the monsters to the south. To the side of our kingdom.\u201dRoan continued saying.\u201cThe monsters that were pressed back came to our Rinse kingdom. And because of that, the number of the monsters that would gather in Pedian\u2019s plain will be much more.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dPierce frowned and let out a low exclamation.\u201cThe guys from the Byron kingdom are bad guys.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t refute him and just shrugged his shoulders.In the place of Byron kingdom, pushing the monsters away instead of annihilating them was much easier to do so, and they suffered less casualties.However, Roan didn\u2019t say such words.\u2018Even so, it is true that we are at a loss because of them.\u2019At that time, the sound of a drum was heard from far away.Boom!Boom!Boom!Boom!The rose troop had finally reached Pedian\u2019s plain.Big and small camps were extended without end in the plain.\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dPierce, Glenn and the other newcomer soldiers exclaimed.In the other side, Roan\u2019s eyes was still calm.\u2018First, it is important to know on what zone the rose troop is going to be stationed.\u2019Only then will he be able to guess the things that would happen from now on.Roan\u2019s sight fell to the west of the plain.\u2018It would be better if it was the west\u2026\u2026.\u2019He was familiar with that place.He clearly remembered where the nest and the camp of the monsters were, when would those things move to where.\u2018Because in my past life, I fought there.\u2019At that time, the rose troop changed directions.\u2018As expected\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan looked the place to where they were going and bit his lower lip.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Roan. There\u2019s an important thing?\u201dGale, that was working in his table, asked while smiling brightly.In the other side, Roan still put on the urgent face act.\u201cIt\u2019s the monsters. There are monsters in the west side of the plains.\u201dGale immediately stood up.Bang.The wooden chair falls and rolls.Gale looked at Roan while frowning.\u201cMonsters? There really are monsters in the west?\u201dRoan bit his lower lip and nodded.\u201cYes. And it seems to be a large scale one.\u201d\u201cMa, maybe\u2026\u2026.\u201dGale\u2019s face was still frowning.Roan nodded and continued saying.\u201cThey are probably planning to do a surprise attack, aiming the weak middle.\u201d\u201cThey sure will.\u201dGale nodded and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cYou have brought me a really important information. If we were careless, he would have taken a blow.He believed in Roan.Because the past few days, he had held conversations with him and got to know how much of an outstanding soldier was he.And because of that, he couldn\u2019t just ignore him.\u201cFirst, I will have to send the scout team and grasp their exact location. Can you go with them?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRoan nodded.Gale smiled brightly and tapped his shoulders.\u201cGood. Then, make you in charge of the scout team.\u201dHe called the adjutants and made them gather the scouts.\u2018This guy again?\u2019\u2018Is his skill good or his luck is good?\u2019\u2018How can he discover monsters everywhere he goes?\u2019The adjutants stared at Roan with surprise and jealousness.\u2018My face will get pierced.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and hanged down his head.\u201cWe have finished gathering the scout team.\u201dThe rescuing voice.Roan bent towards Gale and the adjutants and went out of the tent.\u2018Is a lucky guy. A lucky guy.\u2019Gale looked at Roan\u2019s back and showed a gratified smile.\u201cThen, I will have to go to the commander of the corps.\u201d\u201cAre you already going to make the report? Why don\u2019t you wait until the scout team returns?\u201dThe detaining of the adjutants.Gale shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2019 a simple report. I just have to tell them that I sent a scout team because there was suspicious movement.\u201dVictory and defeat of a battle could also be determined with these small reports.Gale got out of his camp leaving behind his adjutants.The adjutants that were in the camp let out a sigh and shook their heads.\u201cIsn\u2019t he trusting the words of only one soldier?\u201d\u201cOn top of that, he\u2019s a newcomer.\u201d\u201cHe was just lucky.\u201dPouring complaints and discontent voices.In the middle of that, Dosen was just there with his mouth shut.\u2018That he was lucky? I wonder. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u2019A faint smile appears in his mouth.*****\u201cSh.\u201dRoan hid in the weeds and put his finger on his lips.The scout soldiers that were following him also lower their bodies.As they passed through the forest, they saw the plains that was below the hill.Swhooosh.The weeds that were as tall as their waists get shaken because of the west wind.At first glance, a peaceful scenery.However, Roan saw the monsters while hiding his body in the weeds.\u201cAn amazing number.\u201dThe oldest one among the scout soldiers, Benson, approached.He had also discovered the monsters while hiding in the weeds.\u201cThey will probably also be hiding until the end of the plains.\u201dRoan pointed to where the hill was elevated.Benson nodded and vaguely finished counting.\u201cAt least, there would be 5 thousand.\u201dRoan nodded instead of replying.\u2018It\u2019s true that there were only 5 thousand at the first night raid. But after that, the number increased.\u2019The monsters that were surrounding Pedian\u2019s plain in the shape of a horse foot.As time passes, the numbers of them skyrocket.\u2018It\u2019s because of those bastards from the Byron kingdom.\u2019Benson\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWhen will they attack?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tonight without a doubt.\u201dRoan said with a voice that was full of certainty.Benson frowned.\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cThey are hiding their bodies in the weeds without even having prepared a camp. It\u2019s because there\u2019s no much time left until the attack.\u201d\u201cThen, they can attack immediately?\u201dBenson put on a preoccupied face.Roan shook his head.\u201cThey are too exhausted to do that.\u201d\u201cThey are too exhausted?\u201d\u201cYes. They should have ran here without stop to make a surprise attack to the weakened center.\u201dIt was the truth.Just like the monsters that were making an uproar in the north, these monsters were also located in the north even a few days ago.\u201cOriginally, they should have taken place in the north of the plain in this shape.He brought both of his fingers to face each other and made a horizontal shape.Continued by that, taking the point where each of the fingers touch, he bends his fingers to make a shape of a horse shoe.\u201cHowever, right now, it\u2019s in this shape. The place where my fingers touch is the north that\u2019s facing the main forces of our army, and the rest had surrounded us from west to east in the shape of a horse shoe.Benson let out a low admiring exclamation.\u201cAh! The guys that were in the north rushed to the east and the west.\u201d\u201cYes. Taking into account the time, they should have charged here without even having been able to sleep.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Benson\u2019s voice gets lower.\u201cGood. Then, it\u2019s certain that they will attack tonight. We have to report this to the squad and prepare for the surprise attack.\u201dAt his words, Roan didn\u2019t say anything.\u2018No, that\u2019s not a good method.\u2019His eyes chase the monsters hiding in the weeds.A chilly light can be seen in his eyes.\u2018What we need right now is not defense, but attack.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They will probably make a night raid tonight.\u201dBenson told the story just like he had heard from Roan.And he even made the horse shoe with his fingers.Roan looked at that and smiled bitterly.\u2018There are bastards that try to take away your merits wherever you go.\u2019In his past life, he had always suffered from those guys.But now, it was different.\u2018I am taking my own merits.\u2019Meanwhile, Benson had finished talking and had bent his head.\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to prepare for the night raid.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dGale frowned and fell in his thoughts.Then, Roan stood in the front.\u201cCommander.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cRather than preparing for the night raid, it\u2019s going to be better to attack immediately.\u201d\u201cImmediately?\u201dAs Gale asked back, Roan continued speaking without even a trace of hesitation.\u201cThey are in a really exhausted state. There\u2019s no need to wait for them to recover some stamina. On top of that, if more time passes, the number of the monsters will increase. Because they will also be charging here from the north without stop. On top of all\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe glanced at Benson once and made the horse shoe shape with his fingers.\u201cWe have a camp in this Pedian plain right now. And because of that, the rear part, that is the south is open.\u201dThe horseshoe slowly closes.\u201cIf we just let the monsters like this\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe palms of his hands meet each other.The horseshoe shape now became a round one.Roan showed his hands to Gale and continued speaking.\u201cWe will end up getting surrounded.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dA thinking sound comes from Gale\u2019s mouth.\u2018It\u2019s not only now, but he also saw the things that will happen from now on.\u2019He nodded and stood up from his place.\u201cRoan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe words that you said until now, will you be able to say it in front of the commander of the army corps?\u201dAn opportunity.Roan forcefully gulped down the laughter that was trying to come out.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s go to the corps commander.\u201dAs Gale walked one step ahead of him, Roan followed his back.The face of Benson he had glanced at, was so contorted it seemed like he had chewed shit.\u2018That\u2019s why if you are trying to steal the merits of the others, you have to steal it perfectly.\u2019As Gale and Roan got out of the tent, the adjutants let out a sigh.\u201cFor a newcomer soldier to already meet the corps commander.\u201d\u201cYeah. I still haven\u2019t seen him until now.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that bastard going to be promoted in a fast speed if he keeps it like this?\u201dThey didn\u2019t feel good.Then, they saw Benson that was standing without knowing what to do.\u201cBenson. Are you getting similar to that bastard called Roan?\u201d\u201cWhat bulshit did you say about the monsters attacking us in a horseshoe shape but just having to prepare for their attack?\u201d\u201cWhy is the military discipline like this nowadays?\u201dBenson bent his head at the annoyance and reprimanding of the adjutants.\u2018Damn. I should have just kept my mouth shut.\u2019Even if he regretted it, a useless thing.The result of a choice was the responsibility of one own.The choice of Benson trying to steal the merits of another ended in a huge failure.*****\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable.\u201dAaron Tate, that was from the aristocracy and at the same time the commander of the 7th army corps, rubbed his chin and nodded.\u2018It\u2019s amazing for a novice.\u2019When Gale first brought the newcomer soldier, he was quite disinterested.But the moment he heard the story of that guy, he couldn\u2019t hide the amazement.A novice newcomer soldier was reading the flow of the battle and the war.But just because of that, he couldn\u2019t show his emotions for being from the aristocracy.He continued speaking still with a disinterested face.\u201cIt will certainly be better to sweep them up this time.\u201dAaron gathered the squad commanders.\u201cMonsters appeared in the west of the plain.\u201dHe transmitted to them the story he heard from Roan and revealed the attack tactics.\u201cSend this notice to the other corps and prepare for battle the fastest possible.\u201d\u201cYes!

Understood.\u201dRoan replied and went to his camp along with him.\u201cWhy did you get so late today?\u201dAs soon as he got in the camp, Tane approached.Roan put on a bitter smile and replied.\u201cYou should all prepare for battle.\u201d\u201cPrepare for battle?\u201dTane frowned and asked back.All of the soldiers that were having their relaxing time looked at Roan.Then, a loud voice outside of their camp was heard.\u201cSquad commanders gather!

I will show you the strength of an orc warrior!\u201dA strong yell shakes the battlefield.Hit hit hit hit!The cavalrymen charge through while bouncing off the monsters.\u201cUgh!\u201dTarem swung his war sword towards a cavalryman that was passing next to him.Swish.His blade cuts through the body and passes through.Heeng!The cavalryman that was charging through really well fell to the ground.Tarem scattered the white dust and charged through the cavalrymen that was on the ground.\u201cDie!\u201dThe tip of his war sword cuts through the air.\u201cKugh.\u201dThe cavalryman couldn\u2019t even evade it and just closed his eyes firmly.Then, a spear appeared passing through the dust.Kang!A clear sound of metal.The war sword bounces off after being deflected by the spear.\u201cKugh.\u201dTarem grinded his teeth and turned his head to look at the owner of that spear.A childish face and a short physique.At least, for Tarem, he seemed to be a novice.\u201cA fucking novice dares to!\u201dTarem spun his war sword and slashed it down fiercely.At that moment, the spear that was standing firmly bends like a stream of water and moves crossway.\u201cHup!\u201dTarem gulped some air at the unexpected movements and raised his shield.Tang!The spear collides with the shield and a heavy noise is heard.The spear that bounced off the shield spins and flies directed to Tarem\u2019s back.\u201cDamn.\u201dTarem bent down and evaded the spear.However, the movements of the spear still continued like a stream of water.\u2018His face is that of a new novice but his skills are that of a veteran soldier!\u2019Tarem took some air and charged through.\u2018I just have to get inside his range.\u2019The spear was long.And because of that, it was effective in a long range, but it was difficult to use it in close range.Spat!The spear passes through after slicing the wrist.\u2018Kugh.\u2019He felt a sharp pain, but he grinded his teeth and endured it.\u2018I just have to close the distance!\u2019A bold charge.Because of that, he could close the distance to that he wanted.No, it was even closer to what he wanted.And that was because the novice was charging through along with him.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe guy that suddenly appeared in front of him.Tarem got perplexed at the distance that was even hard to swing his war sword.At that time, a sharp feeling was felt in his chest.He slightly looked down to look at his left chest.And there was a short sword the size of a palm stabbed there.\u201cFu, fuck. Impossible.\u201dCurses flow out.Tarem raised his head and looked at the eyes of that novice spearman fixedly.That novice soldier smiled brightly and turns his short sword angularly.Kugugu.The sound of his bones grinding and his flesh tearing.\u201cKuaaaaaa!\u201dA yell flows out from Tarem\u2019s mouth.Hit.The novice spearman hits Tarem\u2019s abdomen with his right leg.And the short sword that was stabbed in his chest gets pulled out and blood flows.Fall.Tarem that fell to the ground.Light disappears from his eyes and the blue sky becomes darker.\u2018Am I going to die?\u2019Then, a sharp spear flies through his eyes.\u2018Fuck.\u2019The curse he couldn\u2019t spit rolls in his mouth.Stab.The spear pierced Tarem\u2019s face accurately.The owner of that spear, the novice spearman mumbled with casually.\u201cTo call me a fucking novice. To a person that roamed the battlefield for 20 years.\u201dNovice spearman.That was no other than Roan.\u2018We are winning one sidedly.\u2019The flow of the battlefield flowed to the side of the subjugation team.The army of the 5 thousand monsters that was composed by orcs and goblins still couldn\u2019t get ahold of themselves and couldn\u2019t properly resist.\u2018I can\u2019t fall back here.\u2019Just because it was a one sided flow, it didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t accumulate merits.He also had to show something that would stand above the others.\u2018On top of that, this isn\u2019t all of their army.\u2019Grip.Roan gripped his spear and charged through.Tat!He charged through the messy battlefield.Spat!The spear pierces through the air and dances.The spear stabs or hits the monsters without stop.Attack and defense.The beauty of spearmanship that lets you do both of those things at the same time.Roan was moving without stop for his spear to not move unnaturally.Slash! Stab! Spat!\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cKgh!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe blade of the spear slices and the tip of the spear pierces.For those guys that were closing in, he hit them and kicked them and after he made some distance, he pierced their necks with his spear.\u201cWow. Look at that guy.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he the newcomer from the 13th squad?\u201d\u201cWhat spearmanship is like that for a newcomer bastard?\u201dThe soldiers that slashed down the orcs and were taking some breaths looked at Roan and mumbled.Spearmanship that\u2019s concise and flows without stop.It was hard to think that it was spearmanship from a newcomer soldier that has just finished his training.\u201cIsn\u2019t he better than our squad commander?\u201d\u201cLast time, I saw the skills of the commander of the 5th squad, and I think that it resembles just like his.\u201d\u201cWow! Did you see? He hit the chin of a monster that was charging in with the end of his spear and after he spins, he smashes its head!\u201d\u201cI saw. I saw. Those skills aren\u2019t something that a mere newcomer should be able to do.\u201dThe soldiers say.And that was the same for the soldiers of the 13th squad.A proud expression appears in their faces.\u2018A lucky bastard entered our 13th squad.\u2019\u2018Kukuku. Look at how dumbfounded the guys from the other squad are.\u2019\u2018The guy that shows himself the most in this battlefield is Roan.\u2019But of course, there was also Pierce that was confronting the orcs with quite good skills, but that guy gave the feeling of rather than doing battle, he was training.An excessively clean feeling.\u2018If you don\u2019t kill them like Roan, it means that you don\u2019t have that much of a motivation.Squad commander Tane smacked his lips as if it was regretful.But actually, that was because the kinds of orcs were a really easy opponent for him, but there was no one that knew this truth.No, there was just one person that knew it. Roan.\u2018He seems to have come to an excursion.\u2019Roan looked at Pierce that was massacring the orcs in a relaxed way and mumbled.\u2018The kinds of orcs should be really easy opponents for you.\u2019He took in a breath after disposing of two goblins that were charging at him easily.\u2018But where is Glenn?\u2019Roan frowned.Because he couldn\u2019t see Glenn among the 13th squad members.Roan, that was searching for Glenn in that battlefield, frowned.That guy seemed to have swept away to the front lines when the cavalrymen and the infantry charged through.\u2018Damn! Not there!\u2019Roan bit his lower lips and kicked the ground.Tane, that looked at Roan leaving the ranks, shouted to him.\u201cRoan! Where are you going!\u201dRoan replied without even looking back.\u201cI\u2019m going to rescue Glenn!\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Get ahold of yourself! We are going to die like this!\u201dJuuuk.Then, the ogre that hit the empty space raised his club.Roan grabbed his collar and forcefully lifted him up.\u201cRun like you are going to die and only looked in front!\u201dAn action like he was throwing him.Glenn fell back staggeringly and looked at Roan.Roan yelled with all of his strength.\u201cRun!\u201dAt that sound, Glenn nodded and ran towards the rear.Then, a heavy noise rang in his ear.Fuuuush.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Roan instinctively threw himself.Boom!The club smashes the place he was just now.\u2018I also have to es\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan that was about to run towards the rear flinched and gritted his teeth.Because the orcs and the goblins were blocking his path.\u2018Damn.\u2019Strength is applied in his hand by its own.The orc that appeared out of nowhere and had his four canine teeth springing out said with a rough voice.\u201cHuman. Your neck\u2026\u2026. Grr.\u201dStab.The spear pierces through the neck of the orc.He didn\u2019t have the leisure to listen at the words of the orc.Roan forced his path in between the orcs and the goblins.\u2018If I do this, that ogre won\u2019t be able to attack me as it wishes.\u2019But unfortunately, that guess was wrong.Fling!The ogre smashed down his club without caring at all that there were orcs and goblins.\u201cDamn!\u201dRoan hit the goblins with the end of his spear and twisted his body.Boom!The club smashes five goblins to the ground and makes them become a pulp.\u2018Crazy bastard.\u2019Roan gritted his teeth and flung his spear.Spat!The spear slices the wrist of the ogre.\u201cKuoooong!\u201dThat guy grabs his wrist along with a cry.Roan quickly climbed over the club and he ostracized the orcs and the goblins.Then, a shadow appears over his head.As he turned to look, a huge fist approached him while cutting through the air.\u201cKugh.\u201dRoan gritted his teeth and flung his body to the right.Boom!The fist smashes the place he was before.\u201cKuooooooong!\u201dThe ogre cried as if it became enraged for having hit the empty ground and glared at Roan.\u201cBlock them!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThen, the special squad approached him while holding their weapons.However, just because of that he couldn\u2019t get relieved.\u2018Annoying things.\u2019Roan looked at the orcs and goblin that already followed his back and bit his lower lip.Spat!The spear shakes and the tip of it draws a flower in the air.Stab. Slice. Stab.At the blade and the tip of the spear, the orcs and the goblins become a cold corpse and fall to the ground.\u2018Kugh.\u2019As he forcefully made those spear skills continuously, his palm hurt.However, he couldn\u2019t stop the movements.Roan turned his body and cut the wrist of the ogre deeply.Slice.\u201cKuoooooong!\u201dIt let out a cry that was filled with pain.Raise.The ogre was trying to smash Roan with his huge foot.Then, the special squad approached him and cut of it\u2019s skin with blades and spears.\u201cKuooooooong!\u201dIt stepped down along with a cry and made struggling movements.The ogre couldn\u2019t think straight at the attacks of the courageous soldiers.\u2018Now.\u2019Roan gritted his teeth and after he evaded the ogre\u2019s foot, he went below its crotch.He could see the big and precious thing of the ogre between the loose piece of leather.\u2018Die.\u2019Stab.Roan\u2019s spear pierces the important part.\u201cKuaaaaaaaaaa!\u201dA different cry until now.The ogre grabbed his crotch with both of his hands and kneeled down.Boom.A heavy noise was heard and a dust cloud raises.Roan quickly got out of its crotch and after he stabs its side, he raises it pointing the sky.Puck.The spear gets stabbed in the nape of the ogre\u2019s neck.\u201cKuoooooooong!\u201dThe ogre let out a cry and flung its fist.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Roan fell back while dropping the spear but attacked it again.In the middle of that, the other soldiers shot arrows without stop.Shoot shoot shoot shoot!Arrows that get stuck in it\u2019s hard skin.\u201cKuong!\u201dThe strength of the cry becomes weaker.Roan gripped his spear with strength and placed the end of the spear in his chest.At the same time, the forced the spear in with all of his strength.Kugugugu.The spear that was stuck in its nape carves in between the hard flesh and skin.\u201cKuog.\u201dThe ogre didn\u2019t even have the strength to fling his fist and was getting slower.Stab.In the end, Roan\u2019s spear perfectly pierces through the neck of the ogre.\u201cGrr.\u201dA dying sound.The huge body of the ogre falls.Boom.Dust cloud raises along with a heavy sound.Roan gripped the spear slippery blood of the ogre drenches his hands.Suug.As he plucked out the spear, the body of the ogre flinches.As he looked at the battlefield, the remaining ogres were already being dealt with.\u2018I was lucky.\u2019Roan looked at the ogre that was fallen below his feet and took in a deep breath.If the special squad hadn\u2019t come charging through, his life could have been in danger.Then, a glad to hear voice was heard.\u201cRoan!\u201d\u201cWe have come!\u201dThe soldiers of the 13th squad including squad commander Tane and vice squad commander Lander.They came charging through the goblins and the orcs with a fierce vigor.\u201cKuegh!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe bastards that fall without having the chance to resist.\u201cRoan. Are you okay?\u201dPete hit his shoulders and asked.Roan caught his breath and nodded.Tane that came a bit late smirked and hit his chest.\u201cYou were the one that was going to die while saving Glenn.\u201dRoan smiled bitterly and asked.\u201cWhat happened with Glenn?\u201dAt his words, Tane pointed to the back side of the squad with his chin.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Glenn was there.And Oliver was defending the zone so as no one fell behind again.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u2026.\u201dTane spoke after looking at the fallen ogre.\u201cDid you also kill an ogre?\u201dRoan smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u201cNo. I have just finished it when it was already done.\u201dAt his words, Pete slapped his back.Puk!\u201cI saw everything while coming here!

It is right that this ogre was killed by that soldier.\u201dThe owner of the voice was from Richard, the one leading the special 7th squad.

Even though you are from the special squad, isn\u2019t this too much?\u201dThe person that elevated his voice was Gale.\u201cSquad commander Gale. Are you getting angry at me?\u201dA low voice but with strength.Gale coughed and smacked his lips.\u201cAhem. Anyways, we can\u2019t give you Roan.\u201dAt those words, Richard shook his head as if it was stifling him.\u201cIt seems like you don\u2019t know how outstanding Roan\u2019s spearmanship is. Roan\u2019s skills isn\u2019t one to be at a normal squad as a low ranked spearman.\u201dExpectation fills his eyes.\u2018It\u2019s really amazing for it to be skills from an 18 year old novice. If he\u2019s polished well, he may become a powerful person such as Rale Baker.\u2019If you were a commander that lead a troop, it was human nature to want to have a weapon.Then, Gale that was hesitating, abruptly yelled.\u201cWho, who\u2019s a low ranked spearman?\u201dRichard frowned.\u201cI\u2019m talking about Roan. I know that he\u2019s a normal spearman with no assigned positions.\u201dAt his words, Gale grinned and shook his head.\u201cWhen is that story of? There are the merits Roan accumulated, and because he had also rendered great amount of help, I was planning to give him the position of squad commander.\u201dIn that instant, it was obvious for Richard, but Roan and the rose troop army that were also listening put on a surprised expression.\u2018Squad commander? Already?\u2019Roan felt his heart beating.It was true that he had accumulated quite a few merits with the goblin army, slave merchants and also in this surprise attack, but even so he was still an 18 year old novice spearman that has just finished his training.\u201cTro, troop commander!\u201dThe urgent voices of the adjutants.Gale looked at them as if ordering them to shut up.\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201dRichard asked back with a composed voice.Even if he had his merits and his skills were excellent, it was still excessive to appoint an 18 year old novice as a squad commander.\u2018Because leading your underlings isn\u2019t only done with skills.\u2019The squad commanders lead 20 plus soldiers.Because of that, one needed the leadership to be able to lead the squad members in the battle field with experience.So it was difficult to expect that from Roan that had just experienced the battlefield two or three times.But of course, this was Richard\u2019s thought.Actually, Roan was an experienced soldier that had roamed the battlefield for 20 years.\u2018Even if I do say it, no one will believe me. Anyways\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan put on a bitter smile and started to remember.\u2018The first time I became squad commander\u2026\u2026\u2026.Was it 15 years from now on?\u2019Quite a late promotion.His friends at that time were already at least adjutants or troop commanders.Or they had retired soon and returned to their hometown to farm.Roan was the only one that roamed the battlefield as a normal soldier.\u2018But to become a squad commander so soon\u2026\u2026.\u2019A bewildering yet overflowing with joy feeling.Then, Gale\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI am out of my mind. I\u2019m planning to add one more squad with this opportunity.\u201d\u201cAnd how are you going to fill the squad members?\u201d\u201cThere are squads that suffered in a big way in this battle.\u201dAt Gale\u2019s reply, Richard frowned.\u201cAre you saying that you are going to gather squad members from other squads as one?\u201d\u201cYes. You can see that the 42nd squad is a union squad.\u201dAn unobstructed reply.Richard looked at Gale\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u2018It seems like you don\u2019t want him to get taken.\u2019In the end, he let out a sigh and shook his head.\u201cIf you are willing to go up to that point I will fall back.\u201dRichard looked at Roan.\u201cIf you need some help, come and look for me anytime.\u201dRoan bent his head instead of replying.Richard moved his feet and when he looked at the dispirited adjutants, he shook his head.\u201cYou too will have it real hard.\u201dIncomprehensible words.But the adjutants slightly bend their heads as if they had understood enough.As Richard walked out, Kenny, that had the fiercest temperament stood out to try to hold back Gale.\u201cSir commander. I think that the seat of squad commander for an 18 year old novice is too excessive.\u201dThe other adjutants also stand up.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why don\u2019t you give him the seat of vice squad commander of the 13th squad?\u201d\u201cOr raising his salary should also be good.\u201dHowever Gale wasn\u2019t planning on stepping back.\u2018I will certainly keep the words I said.\u2019He looked at the adjutants with fierce eyes.\u201cI have no plans on changing my word. Kenny, Jack and Dosen, go to the other squads and bring in some squad members. The squad commander for the 42nd squad shall be Roan.\u201dGale\u2019s sight is directed to Roan.\u201cRoan. You can do it well right?\u201dAt those words, Roan slightly bent his head.\u201cI can do it well.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say that he would try his best, or will work hard.Will do it well.This situation needed those words right now, and he was also confident.Gale nodded with a satisfied expression.Then, Roan raised his head and after glancing at the cold adjutants, he spoke with a low voice.\u201cUm but\u2026\u2026\u201dAs his words became cloudy, Gale made signs with his eyes as if it was okay.Roan laughed awkwardly and continued speaking.\u201cI have some soldiers that I want to bring to my squad.\u201d*****Austin was a 28 year old hot blooded youth that has been roaming the battlefield for 8 years.Although his spearmanship was shapeless, he had really good strength so he rendered small merits many times.\u2018Good. If I keep this, in one more year I will get promoted to squad commander.\u2019When he was in his break day dreaming.\u201cAustin. It\u2019s a transference order.\u201dThe transference order fell in the rose troop abruptly.\u2018Maybe! Already getting the promotion for squad commander?\u2019If it wasn\u2019t for that, there was no reason for him to transfer squads.Expectation made his chest heave up and down.But the reality that fell was a drainwater.\u2018To serve this novice as my squad commander?\u2019His face kept contorting.And this wasn\u2019t only Austin\u2019s thoughts.\u2018Damn. I stepped on shit.\u2019\u2018To serve a novice that just finished his training as a squad commander.\u2019\u2018Aren\u2019t we only going to die because of this novice squad commander?\u2019In the face of the soldiers, anger, annonyment, rage and disappointment could be seen.\u2018Yea. I understand you.\u2019Roan looked at the faces of the soldiers and put on a smile.Because he would also get annoyed if he was told to serve an 18 year old novice as a squad commander.He took in a deep breath and looked at the eyes of the soldiers fixedly.\u201cYou all should have complaints. And you may not be able to understand.\u201dA childish voice.The faces of the soldiers contort even more.Roan didn\u2019t get disturbed and kept talking.\u201cI won\u2019t talk for long.\u201dHe raised his ten fingers.\u201cJust ten days. Just believe in me for 10 days and follow me. If perhaps, you still don\u2019t like me after 10 days, I will make you return to your original squads.\u201dOnly then did the faces of the soldiers loosen up.\u201810 days\u2026\u2026..\u2019\u2018So I only have to endure it for 10 days, right?\u2019They would have to sloppily act until then.Then, behind the dispirited soldiers a loud reply could be heard.\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe owners of those voices were no other than Pierce and Glenn.They were the soldiers Roan wanted to take in.Roan turned back and let out a laughter.\u2018Rest well tonight. Because you won\u2019t be able to think straight starting from tomorrow.\u2019His corner of the mouth raises with an ill nature.*****A group of people enters the camp.A worn out armor with blood stains.\u201cHuk. Huk.\u201dChests that shake roughly.However their eyes were fierce and their steps imposing.The soldiers that were having their break near them started to whisper.\u201cIt\u2019s the ghost squad.\u201d\u201cThey say that they also did it this time?\u201d\u201cThat squad commander over there is the ghost of the battlefield. Ghost of the battlefield.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really amazing. Amazing.\u201d\u201cThey say that they annihilated three monster dens in just ten days.\u201dThe soldiers of that group received the gazes of the other soldiers and went towards a deep part of the camp.Then, a magnanimous voice was heard.\u201cOho! Ghost of the battlefield!\u201dThe man that approaches while shaking his hand was Pete.The man that was walking in front of the group smiled brightly and bent down.\u201cMister Pete.\u201dA kind salute.At that instant, Pete shakes his body and his hands with big motions.\u201cAigoo. Squad commander Roan, please talk to me relaxedly.\u201dA humorous voice.Roan smirked and shook his head.\u201cStop making fun of me.\u201d\u201cAhem. It\u2019s because it\u2019s funny.\u201dPete laughed brightly and scratched his chin.He looked at the men behind Roan and said in amazement.\u201cSquad commander Roan. You also did one today?\u201dAt those words, Roan looks back.Fierce eyes and imposing attitudes.They were the soldiers that just 10 days ago had faces full of annoyance and rage.The newly established 42nd squad.Now, the 42nd squad was being called as the ghost squad.\u201cYes. We encountered some goblins.\u201d\u201cYou encountered them? You didn\u2019t go to find them?\u201dRoan just smiled brightly instead of replying.Pete put on a humorous expression.\u201cSquad commander Roan, your nickname is ghost of the battlefield, ghost.\u201dHe hit Roan\u2019s shoulder and continued speaking.\u201cBecause you guess where the monsters are and where the den of the monsters is. That\u2019s why you are a ghost.\u201dAt his words, Roan put on a bitter smile.\u2018It\u2019s fortunate that i\u2019m not the divine teller of the battlefield.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So in one word, he was battling while combining all of those blurry memories.And of course, even with just that, the accuracy was so high that he even got the title of ghost of the battlefield.But most of all, there was another big gain.\u201cSquad commander. We finished our training.\u201dThe owner of the valiant voice was Austin.\u2018Their attitudes changed.\u2019The biggest gain.That was the change of the attitude of the soldiers that belong to the 42nd squad that was filled with rage, annoyance, and discomfort.The members of the squad all recognized Roan\u2019s skills in just 10 days.\u2018But of course, not all of them are like that.\u2019A bitter smile appeared in his face.Austin looked at that Roan and took in a deep breath.\u2018His spearmanship is like this, but his reading skills of the battlefield and commanding his soldiers are also outstanding. He just seems like a soldier that roamed the battlefield for 10 years.\u2019Because of that, he felt stuffed.\u2018I do want to return to my original squad\u2026..\u2019If he returned to his original squad and accumulated a bit more merits, he would be able to climb to the squad commander seat.\u2018But I want to be next to him more than that.\u2019Roan was only 18.He was really young.That meant that he had a lot more potential and could grow more than now.\u2018Perhaps he could become a commander whose name is known throughout the kingdom, no, the continent.\u2019A great commander ruling the heaven and earth.\u2018An ally that rules the earth along with the great commander. It\u2019s not a bad future.\u2019Austin puts a smile.Then, he heard Roan\u2019s voice.\u201cToday is the tenth day. How many members want to return to their own squads?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s four.\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t as many as I thought. What is vice squad commander Austin planning to do?\u201dA question thrown casually.Austin looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cI want to serve next to you.\u201dA bright smile appears in Roan\u2019s face.\u201cThen, I will be in your care.\u201d\u201cMe too, I will be in your care.\u201dAustin bends his head.On this day, the four people that still thought of Roan as a greenhorn all returned to their respective squads.\u201cThey are all crazy.\u201d\u201cThey are planning to keep being below that greenhorn?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t regret it later.\u201d\u201cThis is why you have to choose people well.\u201dMockery and ridicule.But they couldn\u2019t know.That the people that will regret this decision for all of their lives would be them.\u201cNow! Let\u2019s do our squad training.\u201dRoan started to train with the remaining squad members.The training they haven\u2019t even missed once for 10 days since he became squad commander.At first, the squad members including Austin all let out discomfort voices, but now they rather expected the time to train.\u2018The training methods of 20 years from now on.\u2019Roan trained the 42nd squad with the training method that was fixed with trials and errors for 20 years.\u2018For now, charging through with a square shape method is all.\u2019A really simple shape.However, the aspect of battle changes from now on.Various formations, tactics and strategies become important.Even in a squad composed of twenty people they needed strategy, tactics and good movement.\u2018If it\u2019s the training methods of 20 years from now on, I can make a powerful squad.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and looked back.The 16 squad members run the plains and expand from right to left.\u201cBear in mind! Simply holding your spear and charging to the front isn\u2019t battling! We need to move taking into account the current position of our squad, and go to the objective!\u201dRoan\u2019s voice flows through the wind.\u201cWe have to know in what situation our allies are so we can grasp on what situation they are and give them help.\u201dA voice with strength.\u201cYou have to be able to decide yourselves on what action is the most appropriate one taking these informations into account.\u201dThen, he extended his thumb and index finger and shook his hand.One of the many signs he taught in this 10 days.The members that were in the right flinched and moved to the left.It was a rather quick movement, but Roan couldn\u2019t get satisfied.\u201cIn training, we don\u2019t only train our physiques. We also have to study signs, movements, formations and tactics even at ordinary times. We have to get accustomed to the point our bodies move by itself and not thinking with our heads.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dA strong reply.Roan slowly nods.It has only been 10 days.\u2018It\u2019s impossible to master everything in just 10 days.\u2019That\u2019s why they needed repeated training and study.Then, Roan hit his right shoulder with his left hand and then clenched it to a fist.Swish.The squad members that were running fast lowered their speed, and completely stopped.A plain appeared in front of their eyes.Roan took in a deep breath and looked at his squad members.A smile that appears in his mouth.\u201cNow that we started it, let\u2019s really become a ghost squad.\u201dThat was a declaration of its kind.The squad members gulp dry saliva and nod.The bright sun sets through the plain.*****The 7th troop acquire successive victories.And even in the middle of that, the rose troops squad activity is to the point it shines.\u201cThat\u2019s because of the ghost of the battlefield.\u201d\u201cThey say he finds monster dens really easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not only that. Nowadays, the skills of the squad of that ghost became good to the point it can clearly be seen with your eyes.\u201d\u201cThey say that they even train separately at break times.\u201d\u201cWell, they are a newly formed squad so they would need to train to coordinate themselves.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not to that point. Listening to the stories of people, they seem to be doing training the have seen for the first time in their lives.\u201dThe newly formed 42nd squad, the squad that was called as ghost squad was also quite famous among the soldiers of the 7th troop.It meant that they were getting that much attention.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!In the middle of the formation of the rose troop, a heavy drum noise is heard.\u201cWe are going to battle! In the west side of Pedian\u2019s plain, goblins have appeared!\u201dIn an instant, soldiers get out of their tents.And in the middle of them, Roan and his 42nd squad was also among them.Gale and the adjutants appeared while riding horses.\u201cThe ramsey squad, ultimate squad and the greyum squad are battling with a goblin army!\u201dA loud voice.\u201cThe numbers of the goblins are vaguely 2thousand!\u201dA number that\u2019s not much but not a lot.\u201cFrom now on, we are going to rescue the three squads!\u201dGale sheats out his blade and points to the west.\u201cRose troop charge!\u201dContinued by that, the yells of the adjutants and squad members rings the earth.\u201cCharge!\u201dDudududu.A noise that shakes the earth.The special squad and the cavalry take the front and the rose troop get out of the camp and charge to the west side of the plain.\u2018Was there a battle like this?\u2019Roan frowned at the sudden battle.He didn\u2019t remember anything recent.\u2018Well, I do not remember all of the battles that happened.\u2019Even so, he couldn\u2019t erase the bad feeling.Then, metal clashing and yells was heard at a long distance.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cThis bastards! We will utterly kill you!\u201dThe situation was such that they didn\u2019t need the extra help.The ramsey squad, absolute squad and the grayum squad had already pushed the goblins to a side and almost achieved victory.\u201cChwee!\u201d\u201cChwee!\u201dThe goblins throw their weapons and flee.\u201cChase them!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lose them!\u201d\u201cChase!\u201dThe three squads chase the escaping goblins.\u201cWe are also speeding up!\u201dGale hit the horse.\u201cWaaaaaaaa!\u201dThe soldiers of the rose troop yell and speed up.The infantry squished all of their strength just to catch up with the cavalrymen getting farther away.A forest located at the end of the plain.The branches shake because of the west wind.The rose troop charged to the deepest part of the forest in an instant.They get covered by shadows because of the dense forest.A chill runs down his spine.\u2018Here is\u2026\u2026..?\u2019Roan frowned.And that was because he didn\u2019t have good memories regarding this forest.Then, a yell was heard from the front that was chasing the goblins.\u201cUaaaaaagh!\u201d\u201cIt, it\u2019s an ambush!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201dAt that moment, Roan\u2019s eyes widen roundly.\u2018Ma, maybe?!\u2019The bad memory related to this forest.That digs up in his mind.\u2018But that battle is supposed to happen in a year?\u2019Roan\u2019s sight follows the dense forest.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!

On top of that\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes looked at the entire forest.\u2018In the front and rear there are goblins and orcs, and in the sides ogres appear.\u2019And then, a familiar cry is heard just like it was waiting for it.\u201cKuoooooooo!\u201dJust like Roan\u2019s expectation, orcs and goblin appear in the front and rear, and in the sides, ogres appear.\u2018I\u2019m certain. This is int\u2019s forest battle. Something that should be happening next year is happening now.\u2019His face freezes.\u2018Did the future change?\u2019Roan\u2019s gaze gets stuck to the orcs, goblins and the ogres that come charging.And then, his eyes shake.\u2018That guy?\u2019The orc that runs in the front.A big build with hard arm muscles.His chest that was covered by a worn out armor had a deep blade scar.\u2018That orc is certainly the one that came charging first in the last int\u2019s forest battle. He came charging really excited\u2026..\u2019His gaze subsides calmly.\u2018He falls because of a tree root.\u2019The orc that was charging in, lost balance and fell.He got caught by the tree root.\u2018It\u2019s the same.\u2019Just that the time was different, but aside of that everything was the same.\u2018But is that a fortunate thing?\u2019A bitter smile appears in Roan\u2019s mouth.Meanwhile, the orcs yelled.\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThey yelled with all their strength and swung their blades.\u2018It\u2019s not the time to be thinking of other things.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and gripped his spear with strength.Spat!The spear cuts through the air and pierces the head of an ork.Then, the sound of the horn trumpets was heard at the sides.Puuuuuu!\u201cWe are charging through!\u201d\u201cWe charge through the orcs and get out of the forest!\u201dThe three troops had chosen to charge through.Their objective was the army of the orcs that were at the sides.Even so, the orcs seemed easier than the ogres.Clang! Claclang! Clang!Along with metal clashing, the three troops collide with the orcs.And the rose troop that were a bit farther than them were in a situation where they had to make a decision.\u201cDamn!\u201dGale gritted his teeth and looked at the battlefield.\u2018Ogres at the sides. And orcs at the front and the rear. On top of that, the number of the orcs is a lot higher.\u2019On top of that, the three troops already chose to charge through.\u2018We are also going to the front.\u2019A quick decision.Gale raised his blade and yelled.\u201cTo the front! We are charging through the front!\u201dRoan\u2019s face, that was facing orcs that were charging to him at that moment froze.\u2018Ah! No!\u2019He remembered the truth he had forgotten momentarily at the unexpected battle.\u2018We can\u2019t go to the front or rear.\u2019In his past life, he analyzed the ambush tactic of the monsters after the battle ended.\u2018And the result of that was that the front and rear were sorrow.\u2019They chose the orcs evading the ogres.However, behind the orcs, there was a huge number of monsters waiting for them.An ambush tactic behind an ambush tactic.\u2018The way to escape is rather the ogres.\u2019They were certainly an existence that were fiercer and scarier than the orcs, but behind them, it was certainly empty.\u2018I have to prevent us from going to the front!\u2019Roan cut off the neck of an orc and charged to the front line.Fortunately, the front was momentarily frozen because of the charging orcs.\u201cTroop commander!\u201dRoan called Gale with all of his strength.\u201cHuh?\u201dGale that was preparing to charge to the front with the cavalrymen turned his head at the familiar voice.\u2018Roan?\u2019He discovered Roan that was running hurriedly and pulled the reins.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAsking with a strict expression.Roan pointed to the front.\u201cWe can\u2019t go to the front. It\u2019s better to pass through the ogres. That\u2019s the way to escape.\u201dAt the urgent words, Gale frowned.\u201cAre you saying that we should face the ogres right now?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRoan replied without hesitating.Gale got perplexed.\u2018The number of the ogres were lower than the orcs, but even so there were more than 200.\u2019It was impossible to just face them with 800 soldiers.Then, Kennis raged at him with an indignant face.\u201cYou bastard, it seems like you can\u2019t see properly because of the merits you have accumulated! A greenhorn like you plans to oppose the orders of a troop commander!\u201dAll the other adjutants nodded with displeased expressions.\u201cOn top of that, you are telling us to face the ogres instead of the orcs? You think that it makes sense?\u201c\u201cYou are telling us to die!\u201d\u201cLook there. The ramsey troop already pierced through the orcs. The path to escape is open!\u201dThe adjutants pointed to the orc army in the front and rebuked him.\u2018That\u2019s all a trap.\u2019Roan looked at Gale\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cAfter you pass int forest, a hill appears over there. And that\u2019s the most adequate place to do an ambush.\u201dGale\u2019s face that freezes.\u201cAre you saying that the orcs are falling back by lying and luring the three troops?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRoan nodded with a solid expression.Gale\u2019s sight is directed to the front.The orcs that were being pushed back were getting scattered.\u201cCharge through!\u201d\u201cCharge!\u201d\u201cWe are getting out of the forest!\u201dThe three troops pierced through the hole they created and ran out of the forest.\u201cTroop commander! We have to catch to them! If we hesitate for even a moment, we will get caught in the forest!\u201dKeniss yelled with an urgent expression.Gale turned to look back at Roan again.An expression that was filled with certain.\u2018Because of Roan, I have accumulated a lot of merits until now.\u2019He found the moving path of the monsters or the dens of them.And didn\u2019t he get the nickname of the ghost of the battlefield?\u2018Should I also believe in Roan\u2019s words this time?\u2019Then, Dosen that was facing the orcs in the rear came running with his horse.\u201cTroop commander! Something\u2019s weird!\u201dHe stopped in front of Gale and pointed to the ogres and orcs in the rear.\u201cLook at those guys. Even when they had succeeded on the ambush they aren\u2019t charging in aggressively. This is just\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan continued the sentence.\u201cThey want us to go to the front.\u201dDosen nods with a serious expression.Gale glared at the sides and the rear and frowned.\u2018Dosen\u2019s words are right.\u2019The chance of victory has already gone to the monsters.But even so, they repeated pretending to attack and falling back.It was a certain thing that they were plotting something.\u201cTroop commander! We don\u2019t have time!\u201d\u201cDecide quickly!\u201dRoan\u2019s and the adjutants voices sound.Gale took a breath and made a decision.\u201cTo the sides! We are charging through the ogres that are at the sides!\u201dAt that moment, Keniss\u2019s face get contorted.\u201cTroop commander! There is already a path to escape at the front! So why do we have to face the ogr\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dGale shook his hand and stopped him.\u201cIf we get any more late, all of the troop will get in danger! The ones in the front, turn the heads of the horses. It\u2019s to the sides! Pierce the sides!\u201d\u201cKugh.\u201dKeniss couldn\u2019t talk back anymore and shut his mouth.A reddened face and a cold sight.He bit his lower lip and glared at Roan.\u2018Whew. I got properly marked.\u2019Roan evaded Keniss\u2019s sight and after bending towards Gale he returned to the 42nd squad.Puuuuuuuuu!The noise of the horn trumpet that means charge hits their ears.\u201cPierce through the ogres that are at the sides!\u201d\u201cWe are charging through the sides!\u201d\u201cRun to the west and east!\u201dThe adjutants transmitted Gale\u2019s order to the soldiers.\u201cDamn! To face the ogres!\u201d\u201cWhy are we leaving the orcs and go to face the ogres?\u201dThe soldiers let out discomforted noises with a contorted face, but they just moved according to the orders.Roan made a request to the members of the 42nd squad that were in the front.\u201cBear in mind. Our objective isn\u2019t killing the ogres.\u201dSharp eyes and an expression filled with resolution.\u201cOur objective is charging through. We just have to pierce the ogres and get out of the forest.\u201dAt his words, all the members of the 42nd squad nod.\u201cThen, let\u2019s see each other after we survive.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dA loud reply.Puuuuuuu!Just in time, the horn trumpet sounds.\u201cCharge!\u201dRoan points his spear to the front and charges through.Behind him, the 42nd squad follows.\u201cWaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cPierce!\u201d\u201cOgre bastards! Die!\u201dAlong with a yell, the charge of the rose troop started.The objective was the ogres.\u201cKuooooong!\u201dThe ogres let out cries towards the charging rose troop.

Kung.Then, the ogres shake and fall on their butts.The infantry raise their respective weapons and stab or slash while advancing.And among them, the 42nd squad was also there.\u201cWhistle!\u201dRoan spun his thumb in a round way along with a whistle and pointed the front and rear.\u2018Make a circuit along the objective and charge out the fastest possible.\u2019Austin and the squad members analyzed the sign and move quickly.Consistent movements.Because of that, they could pass through 5 ogres instantly.If they kept this, the 42nd squad would be able to get out of Int\u2019s forest alive.Then, Roan\u2019s face became contorted.\u2018It\u2019s blocked.\u2019The squad that were at the front got their feet tied and couldn\u2019t move, and the escape route got blocked as well.\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dIn that time, the orcs and goblin army that were at the sides came closer to them.\u2018Damn.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and made hand signs to his back.\u201cPierce! To the front!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dPierce, that was looking at the surroundings with a nervous expression, ran to him with a loud reply.\u2018Originally, you should be able to handle three or four ogres by yourself.\u2019But of course, he was talking about what was supposed to happen next year.\u2018Even if it happened earlier, you shouldn\u2019t have any problems handling with one or two of them. On top of that, if it isn\u2019t killing them\u2026\u2026..\u2019If it was only cutting the leg muscles of the ogres, he wouldn\u2019t have any problem against five of them.If it was Pierce, he had to at least be able to do that much.Roan wanted to believe that.\u201cPierce. You are going to stand at the front with me. We are charging through while slashing the legs of the ogre.\u201d\u201cMe, me? No, I?\u201dPierce talked impolitely and clenched his fist. (Don\u2019t know how to tl this)Roan gripped his spear and nodded.\u201cYeah.

You just have to fix that soft heart of yours.\u2019He took in a deep breath, and after he opened his left hand he tilted it towards the rear and front.The sign of charging.Spat!Roan runs at the front.Pierce followed him with a face that was a bit strange in colour, and the remaining 42nd squad members also followed his back.Spat! Puck!Roan\u2019s and Pierce\u2019s spear slash through the air.The sharp point and blade of the spear slash through the ogre\u2019s leg.The skills of the two people was clearly seen by the eyes.Pierce had a splendid spearmanship polished with outstanding talent and senses.Compared to him, Roan\u2019s spearmanship didn\u2019t have unnecessary movements and had a fierce vigor.Spat!The spear of the both of them slash through the legs of an ogre.\u201cKuoooooong!\u201dBoom.The ogre that kneels down along with a cry.The cavalrymen throw ropes to its neck as if they were waiting for it.Tighten.As the muscled horses pull the ropes, the big body of the ogre falls to the ground.Swiiiiiiish!Pubobobok!Continued by that, the arrows of the archers get stuck in its body.It was quite an excellent combination, but Roan was already looking what was going to happen next.\u201cPierce! Move to the left! Ghost squad! To the center!\u201dThe order he yells with all of his strength.Pierce and the squad members move as if they were one body.Spat!The spear slashes through the air once again.\u201cWow. The guys of the 42nd squad are amazing!\u201d\u201cIf they keep it, they will really become a ghost squad!\u201dAt the actions of the 42nd squad, the members of other squad also say in amazement.And among the squad, they were looking at Roan and Pierce that were facing at the ogres in the front.\u201cDon\u2019t you think that squad commander Roan\u2019s skill is becoming better by the day?\u201d\u201cAnd what about the skills of that greenhorn spearman?\u201d\u201cThey say that those two are acquaintances from the training camp.\u201dVoices of amazement.Then, Roan that was facing the ogres and checking the battlefield yells with all of his strength.\u201cGhost squad! To the back! Scatter!\u201dHis left hand that shakes urgently.Austin and the 42nd squad members quickly fall back and break the formation.Boom!At that moment, two huge clubs get stuck to the ground.The ogres that were at the sides were aiming for the 42nd squad and swirled their clubs.\u2018Was he facing the ogres and checking the situation at our side!\u2019Austin put a surprised expression and looks at Roan.\u201cKuoooooong!\u201dThen, the ogre\u2019s cry hit their ears.Fiung.A sharp and heavy noise that tears the air.A huge club cuts the air and smash the soldiers.Puuk!\u201cGrr!\u201d\u201cKukh!\u201dMany soldiers get bounced off after they get hit by the club.Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have a squad commander like Roan.\u201cDon\u2019t get scared and pierce through!\u201d\u201cCavalrymen! Take the attention of the ogres!\u201dGale and the adjutants stand at the forefront and encourage the soldiers.In this situation, it clearly showed that the rose troop was certainly a good one.Even the adjutants that blamed Roan for getting trapped, when the battle started they started to fight alone to at least save one more soldier.\u201cGet out of their range of attacks!\u201d\u201cThe ones at the front! Don\u2019t stop as you wish! The soldiers at the back will get in danger!\u201d\u201cCharge! Charge!\u201dOrders and repeating the orders, the yells get mixed.\u201cKuoooooong!\u201dThe cry of the ogres shake the battlefield.The battle became fierce like that.******\u201cHuu. Huu. Huu.\u201d\u201cHuk. Huk. Huk.\u201dRough breaths could be heard.The soldiers of the rose troop sit astride on the hill and let out rough breaths.A situation where saying even one word was difficult.Even so, faint delight could be seen in the faces of the soldiers.\u2018We survived!\u2019\u2018We survived!\u2019They shook off the orcs and the goblins after piercing through the ogres.While they did that, 200 soldiers died, but even more survived.The surprising thing was that no one died from the 42nd squad.\u2018Whew.\u2019Roan sat on the dirt ground and looked at the squad members that were resting.They were all drenched in sweat and had many injuries.And among them, Pierce\u2019s appearance was really bad.\u201cPierce.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPierce, that was catching some breath, stood from the place.Roan smiled dimly and grabbed both of his shoulders.\u201cYou did well. Because of you, the squad members could all survive.\u201d\u201cSquad commander has also had it hard.\u2019Pierce smiled faintly and lowered his head.The eyes of the squad members that were looking at the both of them were filled with amazement and adoration.\u2018Amazing.\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t believe that they are only 18.\u2019\u2018These two people will certainly become commanders whose names will get spread on the continent.\u2019Roan, that didn\u2019t know that the squad members were thinking of this, hit Pierce\u2019s shoulders and turned his head.The place his eyes were directed to was the place where Gale and the adjutants were resting.\u2018There\u2019s still something left to do.\u2019In the first place, the reason why he proposed charging through the left and not the front and rear was because there was the road to escape but also because of one more reason.\u2018We have to save the three squads that chose to charge through the front.\u2019The three squad that get out of Int forest meet with a monster army at a hill.\u2018And the number of them are roughly 5 thousand.\u2019The total soldiers of the ramsey troop, absolute troop, and grayum troop were barely 2 thousand.If he left them like this, they would all get annihilated.\u2018Originally, Pierce showed extraordinary skills and made a path to escape\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019But now, Pierce was next to him, and not there.\u2018The current number of soldiers of rose troop right now are 600.\u2019Even if they went to rescue, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do much.\u2018But if it\u2019s that method\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes shine.5 years from now on, a student of Tron academy that was located in the capital of Miller presents one report to the headquarters of the kingdom.In the report, the analysis of the ambush tactic of the monsters, and the incompetent countermeasure of the troops of the 7th corps was written.At the contents of the report, it was obvious for the commander of the 7th corps and the generals all got displeased and opposed to it fiercely.The student that got those reactions because of the report he made, only named one strategy.The commander and the generals that saw that strategy all shut their mouths.The evaluation of the commanders that analyzed the strategy.The king that got to know of this late diffused the report made by the academy student to the armies and the corps that were at the front lines.And Roan too, could read that report.\u2018If it\u2019s the strategy that was written in the reports, we may be able to save the three troops.\u2019A smile that appears in his face.He doesn\u2019t worry if the strategy in the report will fail or not.\u2018Because this strategy is the first piece of art of that person.\u2019The academy student that made the .He was Ian Phillips, that was called as an extraordinary genius strategist.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What happened?\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dAt those words, Gale put down his water sac and sat properly.The adjutants also started to gather.\u2018Right. Let\u2019s listen what he has to say now.\u2019A fierce vigor appears in the eyes of the adjutants.Roan stood firmly and looked at Gale\u2019s eyes fixedly.It was stately but not conceited.\u201cWe have to go to rescue the three troops that chose to charge.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d\u2018It seems like he\u2019s certain that the three troops are in danger.\u2019He slowly turned to look at Roan\u2019s eyes.Eyes that weren\u2019t shaking at the least.\u2018In the first place, he opposed to charging through saying that there would be more monsters over there.\u2019If that was true, the three troops that chose to charge through were like a rabbit in a tigers cave.Then, Kennis\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cSaying that we have to rescue the three troops means that they are in danger, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dA reply without hesitation.\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201dIt was a question pressing for an answer, but he wasn\u2019t talking as if he was ignoring him as before.\u2018Because there\u2019s something he showed us, I can\u2019t just ignore him.\u2019When he first said that they had to pierce through the ogre army, he thought that it was a crazy thing.\u2018But just like he said, there were no monsters behind them.\u2019Although they lost 200 and more soldiers, but many more survived.Not a bad result taking into account that they fell in an almost perfect ambush.It meant that Roan\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t a bluff at all.\u2018Being conceited is one thing, and skills is another thing.\u2019He didn\u2019t like that a greenhorn ignored orders and ranks and acted by his own.But his those actions weren\u2019t bluffs but real skills, he couldn\u2019t just ignore him.He recognized what he had to.Kennis, that roamed the battlefield for many years as an adjutant of rose troop, was that kind of soldier.Roan took in a deep breath.\u201cWe shook off the ogres, orcs and goblins that were chasing us. Then, where would those guys go?\u201dHis finger points to the north.\u201cThey are going to catch the three troops. Because that\u2019s the main force.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dKennis and the other adjutants sigh in amazement.\u2018It\u2019s true that they didn\u2019t look like chasing us that fiercely.\u2019\u2018At one moment, they had fallen back.\u2019\u2018It seemed like they were returning to Int forest.\u2019Then, Gale\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cFine. Let\u2019s take into that all you said is true. Even so, our force is only 600. What will these many soldiers do? I think that it would be better to return quickly to our camp and request for help.\u201dAt those words, many adjutants nod.Roan shook his head with a frozen expression.\u201cMeanwhile, the three troops will be annihilated.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dGale shuts his mouth.Then, one of the adjutants that was at the back said sullen words.\u201cEven so, we can\u2019t die along them.\u201dRescuing the three troops in this situation was the same as suicide.Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.\u201cI have a method.\u201dAnd Ian\u2019s strategy that later on would be called as a genius strategist.He looked at Gale and asked carefully.\u201cMay I look at the military map.\u201d\u201cMilitary map?\u201dGale wondered for a moment and made eye signs to Dosen.Dosen nodded slightly and took out a large paper roll from his chest.Swuush.The rolled piece of paper got unfold and the map showed itself.\u2018I did expect it, but it\u2019s more of a mess than what I thought.\u2019Roan let out a small sigh.It was embarrassing to call map to the thing in front of him.\u2018I have to wait 10 more years for the detailed map of the kingdom to come out.\u2019And of course, that was also one of Ian Philip\u2019s piece of work.Roan held back his regret and pointed to one side of the map with the tip of his finger.\u201cThis is our current location. And\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe finger gets a bit higher.The three troops that chose to charge will be around here. They would probably be receiving the attacks of the monsters.\u201dHis finger gets down again.\u201cAnd this river is Prely river. It\u2019s wide but a shallow river.\u201dGale and the adjutants that were listening to the explanation all nodded.Because they also knew well about Prely river.\u2018And especially now that it\u2019s spring, it\u2019s so shallow that it only reaches to the tigh of a grown man.\u2019Roan looked at Gale and the adjutants and continued saying.\u201cWe have to do an inundation tactic.\u201dAt that moment, everyone frowns.\u201cInundation?\u201dAt the words that were asking back, there were many doubts.\u2018He wants to use an inundation tactic in Prely river right now?\u2019\u2018It seems like he isn\u2019t in his right mind.\u2019Distrusting faces.But Roan\u2019s face was still confident.His finger points Prely river and follows to the right.Point.The tip of his finger stops.\u201cThis place has the answer.\u201d*****Dududududu.Horse steps that shake the earth.Roan hit the horse and took in a deep breath.\u2018The reason Ian Phillips is amazing isn\u2019t only because he makes wondrous tactics.\u2019There were many reasons as to why Ian was called as the outstanding genius strategist, but the biggest reason was on the point that he knew the importance of information better than anyone else.He ran an information organization in Rinse kingdom for the first time.\u2018Before that, you gave money to an information guild or thieves guild. That was all.\u2019Ian took and analyzed even the little bit of informations other wouldn\u2019t hold any regard.Because of that, he could gather a massive amount of information better than anyone else and with this information, he made the most effective and efficient strategies.\u2018It\u2019s also the same for Int\u2019s forest battle.\u2019Ian focused on the information that nobody that analyzed Int forest\u2019s battle knew, or even if they knew they didn\u2019t hold it in any regard.\u2018Temporary reservoir.\u2019The farmers in Pedian\u2019s plain made a temporary reservoir in Prely\u2019s river for when winter ended.They were gathering water in case they lacked water at spring, when it started they yearly farming.Because of that every spring, Prely river was really shallow compared to it\u2019s width.\u2018We are exploding that reservoir.\u2019That was what Ian thought and the tactic Roan was going to do.Roan hit the horse and looks to the west.The place where the temporary reservoir was located.\u2018By now, the squad members may also have reached.\u2019The rose troop were currently divided in two.The squad Gale lead went to the temporary reservoir to explode the bank.And the squad Kennis and Roan were leading were running towards the three troops.\u2018It would be bad if our allies also get swept on the inundation tactic.\u2019Roan calmly gripped the reins.\u201cAdjutant Kennis.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKennis, that was running at the front, looks back.Roan points to the earth with his finger.\u201cWe will have to leave some archers here.\u201dAt those words, Kennis nods and does a hand sign.One of the soldiers left the ranks and protected the place.Roan left archers at moments while running to the west.When they were running without stop and were about to pass a hill.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!Metal clashing could be heard.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get pushed back!\u201d\u201cIf you do, we die!\u201dContinued by the yells.At that moment, Roan\u2019s face contorts.\u2018How so?\u2019A face he couldn\u2019t believe it.Roan quickly hit the horse\u2019s stomach and lowered his posture.The horse runs like a feather and stand at the peak.He saw the battlefield with his eyes.\u201cHow are the three troops here?\u201dAn unexpected situation.Then, Kennis approached him and asked.\u201cAccording to your guess, shouldn\u2019t our allies be at the other side of the river? But\u2026\u2026\u201dThe three troops had already passed the river and were pressed to the south.Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018It\u2019s different.\u2019Originally, the three allied troops should be fighting the monsters at the northern part of the river.An unexpected battle again.\u2018It\u2019s certainly different. But\u2026..\u2019Roan glared at the battlefield with sharp eyes.His head spins so fast noises could be heard.EndTranslator\u2019s note: From now on there will only be 2 to 3 chapters per week as the amount of words per chapter literally doubles from now on\u2026 But well, you can always expect more if there are donations hehe.Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are they joking?\u201dA voice that was filled with displeasure.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cThey are only pretending to attack our troops.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t know the exact reason.However, the certain thing was that Sedek\u2019s army that was at their rear, were only pretending to attack while maintaining a distance.Roan organized his thoughts for a moment and looked back at Kennis.\u201cI have thought of something good.\u201dHe whispered towards Kennis for a little while.Kennis frowned after he heard all the story.\u201cWon\u2019t it be dangerous?\u201dRoan replied with a calm voice.\u201cIt is, but to secure a path to escape, we can only lure Sedek\u2019s troop.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dKennis gulped and looked at Roan.\u2018I thought that he only knew how to use his head, but it seems like he has some courage and determination.\u2019The strategy Roan said.\u2018While we are luring the rear of Sedek\u2019s army, make the three troops retreat by crossing the river.\u2019If only they could lure Sedek\u2019s troop, they would be able to open a path for the three troops to retreat.\u201cAnd are you confident on being able to do it?\u201d\u201cYes. I am.\u201dRoan nodded without even a trace of hesitation.Kennis looked at his two eyes and then made hand signs to his back.Karon, that was in charge of the 1st squad approached.\u201cKaron.\u201d\u201cYes. Tell me.\u201dAt Kennis\u2019s call, Karon bent his head.Kennis pointed towards Sedek\u2019s troop.\u201cGet 10 squads and attack Sedek\u2019s troops rear.\u201d\u201cYou want me to attack the rear of the monsters army?\u201dKaron put a surprised expression and looked at the battlefield.Even at first glance, their numbers were more than 3 thousand.To attack them with only 200 soldiers, they had an overwhelming number of monsters.Kennis nodded slowly and looked at Roan.\u201cRoan will help you.\u201dA voice that contains strength.It was a voice that was filled with trust.Roan slightly bent towards Kennis.\u2018I don\u2019t know if this choice will be a right one or a wrong one.\u2019An unexpected battle.This choice was all on Roan.\u2018But if I can just succeed, I will accomplish a really big merit.\u2019Fire appears on his eyes.*****Sedek got on the war horse and glared at the battlefield.\u201cKukuku.\u201dLaughter kept coming out from between his cuspids.\u2018Was he called Pelt?\u2019The thing Sedek was looking at was at the monster army that were doing a fierce battle that was happening across the river.And between them, it was an orc warrior swinging his halberd.\u2018Hmph. I can\u2019t let a bastard from the Byron kingdom to get all the merits.\u2019His eyes became sharp.The orc warrior that was swinging the halberd was a friend of Tarem, that was from the same Byron kingdom, and proposed to make this ambush tactic for revenge.\u2018That stupid bastard Tarem said that he was going to make a night raid and after he took some warriors from the orcs alliance of our Rinse kingdom, they were the ones that rather suffered a surprise attack and got annihilated.\u2019Even so, the supreme commander of the orcs alliance Rak, kept more trust on the orcs from Byron kingdom.\u2018Damn. I don\u2019t know why he keeps covering for the defeated bastards.\u2019His face contorted.Sedek, that was from Rinse kingdom and even got attention on the northern Rinse orcs alliance, didn\u2019t really like supreme commander Rak\u2019s decision.\u2018Even so, I can\u2019t oppose him\u2026\u2026. I can only hope for that Pelt bastard to die on this battle. Kukuku.\u2019He called his adjutants with some hand sign.\u201cKeep in mind. We are only pretending to attack. We will wait until Pelt\u2019s troop crumbles.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe adjutants nodded and scattered to the sides.They acted as if they were attacking just like Sedek\u2019s order, and didn\u2019t move first.\u2018Kukuku. Even if he survives, if his losses are great you won\u2019t be able to say that it\u2019s an outstanding merit.\u2019Laughter keeps coming out.Then, a yell was heard flowing through the west wind.\u201cSedek!\u201dA loud yell\u2018Who dares to call my name?\u2019Sedek frowned and turned to look at the place where his name was called.Dudududu.He saw soldiers charging to them while climbing the hill.\u201cAmbush?!\u201dSedek got surprised but in the end, burst out of laughter.\u201cWhat is it? That\u2019s all? Kukuku.\u201dThe soldiers charging towards him were barely 200.His numbers were more than 3 thousand.\u201cSedek!\u201dA loud yell was heard once again.The owner of the voice was a youth with a childish face that was at the front of the soldiers.It was Roan.\u2018Certainly, his body is really impressive.\u2019Roan looked at Sedek that was looking at him being on top of the war horse and gasped in amazement.His body that was covered with strong muscles was as thick as a tree.\u2018Even so\u2026\u2026..\u2019The corner of his mouth rises slightly.He knew his fatal weakness.\u201cSedek! You stupid orc!\u201dRoan\u2019s voice cuts through the battlefield.Some orcs got agitated and breathed hard.\u201cWho dares to our troop commander!\u201d\u201cYour heads should really be screwed!\u201dHowever, Sedek himself was calm.\u201cKukuku. Is he provoking me? Leave him. There\u2019s no need to pay them any mind. Just fire some arrows.\u201dAnd then, Roan yelled loudly once more.\u201cSedek! You looking at the battlefield while seating on the horse is really manly!\u201dA sudden praise.Sedek frowned and glared at Roan.\u2018What is he planning?\u2019He started to get uneasy.A faint smile appears on Roan\u2019s face.\u201cThe squad members below Sedek should be really happy! To have that cool and dignified man as your troop commander!\u201dA continued compliment.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIs that human crazy?\u201dEven the orcs get perplexed.And it was also the same for Karon and the squad members.\u201cSquad commander Roan. What are you doing right now?\u201dAs Karon asked, Roan replied with a nervous expression.\u201cNow, that bastard will charge towards us as crazy. And then, we will have to cross Prely river and flee.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to come to us after you compliment him like this?\u201dRoan nodded and looked at Sedek.He yelled with all the strength he had.\u201cBut do you know that? That your troop commander doesn\u2019t have a dick!\u201dIn an instant, the orcs all look towards Sedek.\u2018Troop commander Sedek, that\u2019s a warrior among warriors, is an eunuch?\u2019\u2018No, no. It\u2019s not to the point of being an eunuch, but he directly doesn\u2019t have one?\u2019Sights filled with doubts.Sedek\u2019s face becomes nicely contorted.Roan kept yelling.\u201cThat bastard was having fun with some bitches and in the end, it got cut by his wife! His crotch is really clean!\u201dRoan\u2019s words were all true.These were all things that got revealed when Sedek\u2019s troop got defeated in Huil\u2019s battle, and they got interrogated.\u2018That bastard Sedek kept this truth really well hidden. Because it\u2019s the most disgraceful thing for an orc warrior.\u2019Mumbles of the orcs become harsher.\u201cIf you can\u2019t believe me, send one adjutant and make them put his hand on his crotch! It will slip away! Hahaha!\u201dRoan drenches his throat and laughs hysterically.Karon, that was well aware of his surroundings, laughs together and makes some handsigns.And then, all of the squad members burst out of laughter.\u201cHAHAHAHA! They say that orcs are prestigious warrior, but the one that his lower parts is lose to be the leader!\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to ride the horse!

HAHAHAHA!\u201dLaughter shakes the battlefield.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026This\u2026\u2026This\u2026\u2026\u201dSedek\u2019s body trembled and ground his teeth.Rage surged up.\u201cThis son of a bitches\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn the end, he couldn\u2019t hold it and hit his war horse.Hiiiing!The war horse crise and charges through.Dudududu.Sedek left back the orcs and ran towards Roan.\u201cHuh?! Tro, troop commander!\u201d\u201cChase the troop commander!\u201d\u201cFollow his back!\u201dThe orc adjutants get surprised and hurriedly kicked their horses.At the sudden order, the orcs got started to follow him ack.\u201cThey are really charging like crazy.\u201dKaron looked at Sedek while panicking and pulled the reins.The head of the horse turns south east.\u201cWe are running to the south east and cross Prely\u2019s river! Run with all your strength!\u201dKaron kicked his horse and lowered the posture.The war horse let a long cry and started to charge while cutting through the air.Roan and the squad members followed his back.\u2018They are following really well.\u2019Roan glanced back and put a faint smile.At least half of the 3 thousand orcs were chasing them.Dududududu.They could see Prely\u2019s river.Karon made hand signs to his back and then one soldier grabbed his bow.Tense.As he left go of the tensed bowstring, one arrow flies to the skies.Piiiiiiiik!A sharp sound hits their ears.Signal.That was the signal to explode the reserve, and also the sign of the battle starting.EndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t you know when you see the situation? Sedek\u2019s troop is blocking us on the rear.\u201dAn expression mixed with annoyance.Kennis shook his head and pointed to the rear.Ramsey that looked at the rear without thinking much, widened his eyes.\u201cWha, what is this? What happened?\u201dThe line set up by Sedek got loose.Kennis gripped the reins with strength.\u201cSoon, a big amount of water will pour.\u201dThe calm voice passes through the noise of the battlefield and gets stuck on Ramsey\u2019s ear.The longer the story became, the more surprised Ramsey\u2019s face became.\u201cRetreat! We are crossing Prely\u2019s river!\u201dAnd then, Ramsey\u2019s voice rings throughout the battlefield.At the same time, the three troops turn away.They didn\u2019t keep pointing the spear to the west, but to the south.A path to escape appeared there.******\u2018It seems like adjutant Kennis also did well.\u2019A smile appears on Roan\u2019s face.Because he felt how the shape of the battlefield was breaking.\u2018Anyways, he\u2019s really charging like crazy.\u2019His sight goes to his back.He saw Sedek charging towards him like crazy with a contorted face.\u2018If you come to me without thinking much, then thanks.\u2019He sticked his chest to the horse and looked to the front.The archers that were stationed at places before coming to the battlefield start to fire their signal arrows.\u2018By now, the news should also have been sent to troop commander Gale.\u2019This meant that they would soon explode the reserve.Roan yelled towards Karon that was running in front of him.\u201cSir adjutant Karon!\u201dEven if he didn\u2019t do that, Karon that was in his moment of envy, nodded slightly and pulled the reins.Hiiiiiiing.The head of the horse turns to southeast.Karon and the soldiers start to charge towards Prely river again.\u2018We have to cross before the water comes.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and kicked the horse.Splash. Splash.Karon and the soldiers at the front jumped into the river.Pabababat.Along the rough movements of the war horse, water splashes to the sides.\u201cStop there!\u201dBehind them, Sedek\u2019s shout was heard.He had already lost his reasoning by now.\u201cSquad commander! Squad commander Sedek!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go too in front!\u201dThe orc adjutants and warriors that were following behind him, sweat of anxiety and follow his back.Dudududu.And then, the calm river started to tremble.\u2018It\u2019s coming!\u2019Roan\u2019s expression freezes.Karon and the other soldiers also seemed to have felt the tremor and yelled with a hurried expression.\u201cDamn! Hurry!\u201d\u201cHurry and cross the river!\u201dThe speed of kicking the horse gets faster.Hihihihing!The war horse cries longly and rises its four legs highly.Splash. Splash.Karon, that was at the front, and the soldiers reached the other side of the river.When Roan was the last that remained on the water.Boooooom!A great amount of water came across the hill with a loud noise.\u201cKugh!\u201dRoan grabbed the reins and kicked the horse.Hihihing!The warhorse lets a cry and jumps out of the water.Pat!Water drops splash along the body.A dramatic and elegant look.Step.The soldiers and Roan, as the last, all crossed Prely\u2019s river.\u201cHuk. Huk.\u201dRoan breathed roughly and looked back.\u201cUaaaaa! It, it\u2019s water!\u201d\u201cRun! Run!\u201d\u201cCross the river!\u201d\u201cGo back! Return!\u201dThe orcs and the goblins looked at the water body that was going to clash against them roughly and got perplexed.They, that were at the middle of the river, didn\u2019t know if they had to return or cross the river, and they repeated stumbling onto each other.Even in the middle of that, there was one bastard that was crossing the river with a fierce energy.\u2018Sedek.\u2019Because he ran alone at the front leaving the orcs and goblins, he was almost out of the water.\u201cYou son of a bitch! Receive my blade!\u201dAn evil cry.Sedek got out of the water along with his horse.Spat!The guys blade cuts the air.\u201cHmph!\u201dRoan pulled the reins and fell back.And at the same time, he twisted the wrist he was grabbing the spear.Spat!The spear spun roundly and the blade of it danced.Cheng!Metal clashing was heard and sparks appear\u201cDam! The orcs are coming up!\u201d\u201cBlock them so they can\u2019t do it!\u201dKaron raised his spear highly as he saw the orcs running after Sedek like crazy and shouted.\u201cBlock!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dAt the same time, the soldiers attacked the orcs.\u201cWhere are you going! Push them back!\u201d\u201cWe have to get out of the water!\u201dThe orcs were also desperate.That was because the water was near them.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!Metal clashing continued fiercely.And then, the water came up.Booboobooboom!\u201cUaaak!\u201d\u201cKuugh!\u201d\u201cKgh!\u201dThe noises the orcs and goblins make.The huge amount of water swept the bastards like an angered wave.Psssss.The water splashed and the cold wind passed through their skin.They felt the chill with all their body.\u2018If, if we were even a little bit late it was going to be dangerous.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s an impressive power.\u2019Karon and the soldiers gulped dry saliva.The orcs and goblins that were filling Prely river got wiped off cleanly.If they were even a little bit late, they would also have ended up that way.\u201cThi, this son of a bitches!\u201d\u201cNasty humans!\u201dThe remaining minority of the orcs and goblins let out cries and charge fiercely.However, the one that charged in more fiercely than anyone was Sedek.\u201cHuman! I will cut off your neck and chew you off!\u201dA ferocious spirit.The fierce threat is reflected on his eyes.However Roan\u2019s face was still relaxed.\u2018He\u2019s really messed up.\u2019It was really important to not lose your cool on the battlefield.\u2018One of the things I learnt during the past 20 years.\u2019A faint smile appears on his mouth.Spat.Sedek\u2019s blade passed right in front of his nose.\u2018It\u2019s big.\u2019It was a certainly powerful attack, but his movements were overly big.Even now, as one attack missed his shoulder and sides showed.Paat!His spear cuts through the air and stabs his waist.An attack that was like a flash.\u201cBastard!\u201dSedek cried out and twisted his body.Spat!The blade of the spear cuts his side thinly and passes through.Normally, a situation that would make you shake.However, Sedek that had already lost his reasoning didn\u2019t care more about water and fire.He lifted up his blade over his head while not even caring about his injury.Swuung.The blade that cuts through the air with a roaring sound.Sedek swung down his blade with all of his strength as if he wanted to crush Roan.\u2018I can\u2019t block it.\u2019To block it, the strength under the blade was really strong.Roan pressed the shoulder of the horse with his tigh and moved to the right.At the same time he twisted his body and let the blade pass through.\u201cKugh.\u201dAt that moment, Sedek stumbled to the front.Roan didn\u2019t miss that chance.Spat! Pabababat!The spear cuts through the air and dances.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!Sedek ground his teeth late and swung his blade.However it was impossible to block all of the attacks while he had lost balance.Spat! Pabat!Some parts of the body start to get covered by wounds.\u2018He is amazing.\u2019Roan gasped of amazement at Sedek that attacked and defended even while he had lost balance.\u2018Let\u2019s see if you can also block this one.\u2019He put strength on his hand that was gripping the spear.\u2018Fifth stance of Pierce\u2019s spearmanship.\u2019He had almost never missed individual training after he came back to the past.And because of that, he could raise his skills to where he could execute the fifth stance, when before he could only do the third.\u2018I will cut his neck instantly.\u2019The best skill he could execute without any mana.The muscles of his both arms get swelled up.Spat!The spear cuts the wind.The body of the spear shakes and twists greatly.Tuung!The spear hit the space along a heavy sound.\u201cWhere are you!\u201dSedek pulled his blade and blocked the spearCheng!The sound of metal clashing hit their ears.\u201cKugh.\u201dSedek ground his teeth.The feeling that all of his palm was getting numb.\u2018How is he this stron\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019The moment he was admiring him.The spear that was blocked by the blade surged above his head.\u201cHuh?\u201dReally strange movements.Sedek just blinked at the unexpected spear movements.Spat!And then, the spear that was above his head fell down with a sharp noise.\u201cHuh? Huh!\u201dSedek pulled his blade with a surprised expression, but it was already late.The sharp spear stamps his head.Stamp.Sedek\u2019s head got separated to the sides along a horrible noise.The eyes that were separated at both sides had a trace of disbelief.Roan then twisted his wrist and cut off the head.Drop.The atrocious head rolls down the floor.Stab.Roan stabbed down Sedek\u2019s head.The spear that surges high to the sky.At the same time, Roan\u2019s voice rang on the battlefield.\u201cSquad commander roan from the 42nd squad part of rose troop has slain the enemy Sedek!\u201dThat was a kind of ending.And it was also a declaration of the battle ending.EndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Attack! Kill!\u201dKaron didn\u2019t miss the opportunity.The 200 soldiers pushed the orcs and goblins to one side fiercely.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng! Slash. Stab.Metal clashing and explosive sounds hit the ears.Roan looked at the downstream of Prely river.\u2018It seems like the three troops crossed the river safely.\u2019The three troops had already crossed through it without being late.They didn\u2019t follow Sedek\u2019s back and were pushing back the goblins and orcs that were protecting the place.Fluuush.The rough stream of the water was heard.\u2018Even so, quite many survived.\u2019Even after having been swept by the rough water, there was a number of monsters that wasn\u2019t that small lining up on a battle formation.\u201cDamn! Despicable humans!\u201d\u201cChwee! Chwee!\u201d\u201cKuooong!\u201dThey couldn\u2019t even cross the river because of the rough stream and just let out cries.Meanwhile, the three troops took care of the remaining monsters.\u201cSquad commander Roan. It\u2019s a huge victory. A huge one.\u201dKaron approached and laughed hysterically.Roan tied Sedek\u2019s head on the saddle and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s great that it turned out as it was planned.\u201dA not excessive humility.Karon grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cSquad commander Roan. If it wasn\u2019t for you, the three troops were going to be annihilated. This merit is so big that it can\u2019t even be compared to the slave merchants.\u201dThe voice gets bigger slowly.Roan smiled instead of replying and looked at the three troops that were approaching.\u2018I do know that it is a big merit. That\u2019s why i\u2019m happy but worried at the same time.\u2019The words he gulps down inwardly.It was certain that he was going to climb to the highest seat on the merits awards.And it was obvious that jealousy and envy was going to follow back on that process.\u2018If it\u2019s something like that, I have gone through that plenty of times for the past 20 years.\u2019Because of the stupid choices he made on the past life, even after having rendered some merits there were many cases where he got punished.\u2018This time, it won\u2019t turn out that way.\u2019Roan gripped the spear and shut his mouth tightly.A firm determination shone on his eyes.*****\u201cHuh? It\u2019s the ghost of the battlefield.\u201d\u201cThis time, he was truly excellent.\u201d\u201cBecause of the ghost of the battlefield the three troops could avoid annihilation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not only that. He crushed the monster army that amounted to ten thousand with the inundation tactic.\u201d\u201cAnd recently, the activity of the ghost squad is no joke.\u201d\u201cThey really fight like some ghost.\u201dVoices filled with dread and admiration.The soldiers of the rose troop applauded towards Roan and the 42nd squad that passed in front of them.Clap! Clap! Clap!\u201cBecause of you, we could save our lives!\u201d\u201cOne friend that\u2019s on the ramsey troop told me to send you his gratitude!\u201d\u201cSquad commander Roan! Thank you!\u201dRoan slightly bent and didn\u2019t show that big of a reaction.But rather, the shoulders of Austin and the other members of the 42nd squad rose.\u2018Kugh! I certainly did well on staying on the 42nd squad.\u2019\u2018Those guys that returned back then should be regretting it, right?\u2019\u2018Hua. It really feels good!\u2019A smile kept coming out.Actually, he was betraying his emotions, but one corner of the heart of Roan felt proud.\u2018This life is quite fine.\u2019He was a little bit perplexed when the battle didn\u2019t happen as what he remembered.But the decision he made with his 20 years of experience was followed with good results.\u2018Even if a future different to my memories happen, there\u2019s no need to be scared. Because even if that happens, my memories don\u2019t.\u2019A faint smile appears on his mouth.And then, a familiar voice was heard.\u201cOh! Roan!\u201dThe person that was extending both of his arms and smiling brightly was Gale.Roan moved slowly and made a salute.\u201cI came through your calling.\u201dBehind him, the members of the 42nd squad lined up firmly.Gale walked towards him and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cRoan. You rendered a really big merit. And because of you, it\u2019s obvious for us, but the other three troops could also escape annihilation.\u201d\u201cI just did what I had to.\u201d\u201cHahahaha! You are even humble!\u201dGale laughed hysterically and looked towards Keniss.\u201cKennis. Report the big merits Roan has rendered.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dKennis, that was one of the adjutants lined up next to Gale, made one step to the front and unrolled a big piece of paper.And he slowly started to read down the things he did like investigating Ale gorge, capturing the slave merchants, and the things that happened on Pedian\u2019s plain.\u201cLastly, he has slain the neck of Sedek in the inundation tactic. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cOho. Now that you group it all, it really is amazing.\u201dGale gasped of amazement.He returned to his original place and looked at Roan with a gratified expression.\u201cNow that the merits are this outstanding, I will have to give you a reward according to it. But before that\u2026\u2026..\u201dEyes filled with curiosity.\u201cThey say that the tactic you used to lure Sedek was astonishing\u2026..Roan, how did you know that truth?\u201dRoan slowly lifted his head and looked at Gale\u2019s two eyes.\u2018The question I expected.\u2019He couldn\u2019t actually say that it was something that was discovered a few years later on the process of inquiring Sedek.Roan already had an answer he had thought of.\u201cI\u2019m from a little town on Grain\u2019s mountain range. Because of that, I could hear the rumours about the monster commanders without stop.\u201d\u201cAha!\u201dGale hit his knees after letting out a low sigh of amazement.\u201cSo you also heard that Sedek doesn\u2019t have a dick at your hometown?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and nodded.Gale nodded as if the question he had had been answered and clapped.Clap.\u201cGood. Then, should we genuinely start the conference?\u201dHe made eye signs to Kennis.Kennis slightly nodded and ordered some soldiers to bring small leather bags.\u201cFirst, I will be giving rewards to the members of the 42nd squad that rendered a distinguished merit.\u201dAt those words, Austin and the others glanced at each other with surprised expressions.\u2018We? It\u2019s us?\u2019Expressions as if they are asking themselves that.Kennis coughed as no one moved even after he had finished speaking.\u201cAhem. Vice squad commander Austin, come and get your reward first.\u201d\u201cAh?! Yes.\u201dOnly then did Austin take back that absent minded face and move his step to stand in front of gale.\u201cYou have done well.\u201dGale lent one bag and hit his shoulder.\u201cThank you.\u201dAustin bent down and received the pocket with his two hands.\u2018For not only the squad commander, but for also us to receive prizes.\u2019A really unexpected award.\u2018This is all because of squad commander Roan.\u2019Thankfulness and admiration rushed down their hearts.After that, the soldiers including Pierce and Glenn all received their own rewards.Thankfulness and admiration also show on their faces.\u201cNow! Is it now the turn of Roan?\u201dAt those words, the faces of some adjutants stiffen.Keniss looked at them and luahged bitterly.It\u2019s because he knew the reason they were putting that face.\u201cRoan. First, I will also give you a reward.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan received the bag and bent down.It was a little bigger than the ones the squad members received.However, the rewards didn\u2019t end with that.\u201cAnd I will rearrange the 42nd squad to the 12th one and appoint Roan as a class 5 adjutant.\u201dAt that instant, it was obvious for the 42nd squad, but even Roan put on a surprised expression.\u2018Class 5 adjutant?\u2019Roan turned to look at Gale and Kennis as if he wondered if he had heard wrong.Kennis smiled gratified and slightly nodded.\u2018I\u2019m an adjutant?\u2019He was only an 18 year old greenhorn spearman.He did render some great merits, but he hadn\u2019t thought that he would be able to climb to the seat of adjutant this quickly.Taking into account that Kennis was a grade 2 adjutant, it was a really outstanding promotion.\u201cRoan\u2019s rank will be a class 5 adjutant, and will work below adjutant Jack that leads the current spearmen squad.\u201dKennis\u2019s voice was kind.Gale looked at Roan\u2019s absent minded expression and asked as if he was whispering.\u201cHow is it? Do you think that this much will be enough to what you have done until now?\u201dOnly then did Roan take a hold of himself and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s a prize more than I deserve.\u201dAt those words, Gale shook his head.\u201cThere are still some points lacking for me.\u201dThat was the truth.Roan was about to reply something but he ended up lowering his head.Because the sights of the adjutants next to Gale was really fierce.\u2018The reason why the expressions of the adjutants isn\u2019t good is because of that.\u2019Especially Jack\u2019s face, that had to split the spearmen with him, was a mess.Then, Gale\u2019s voice was heard again.\u201cHow is it that you aren\u2019t saying anything? I\u2019m not saying this for being pretentious.\u201dRoan raised his head and looked at Gale.\u201cIf you have something to ask me, tell me. Because if it\u2019s something beyond my reach, I will grant it to you.\u201dAn unexpected opportunity.\u2018If it was before, I would have just say no and fell back.\u2019But now, he wasn\u2019t like that.And after looking at Jack\u2019s sharp eyes, he became more that way.Roan slightly bent down and replied.\u201cThen, give me one duel right.\u201d\u201cAh! A duel right!\u201dGale smiled brightly and hit his knees.This dueling right was a piece of paper that could challenge someone without caring about ranks.But the limits were also clear.You could only use the duel right given by troop commander Gale inside the rose troop.And of course, excluding Gale.\u201cHahaha! Are you planning to battle with Kennis?\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t get a promotion or some rewards if you won the battle.Only, the victor will get the recognition of the squad members and at the same time, a rather big reputation.Roan saved his words.Gale nodded with a really funny expression and shook his hands.Then, one soldier brought a yellow and stiff piece of paper, the size of a palm.Write.Below the short phrase, a signature is written.\u201cHere, it\u2019s the duel right. Use it wisely.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan received the duel right and after putting it in his chest, he bent down again.Gale clapped his hands with a proud expression.Clap.\u201cWith this, the prizes I will give will come to an end. But\u2026\u2026\u201dHe paused for a moment and continued to say.\u201cIt seems like the commander of the 7th corps Aaron Tate will also be doing a merits award.\u201dAt those words, Roan looked at Gale\u2019s two eyes fixedly.A little surprised expression.Gale smiled and nodded.\u201cRight. It seems like the commander will directly bestow you the rewards.\u201dAgain, an unexpected thing.Kennis continued to say.\u201cThe merits reward by the commander will be done after you go back to your respective head quarters, so keep it in mind.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan replied with the calmest expression possible.However, he was so happy inwardly he wanted to jump.\u2018If it\u2019s the headquarters of the 7th corps, it will be Ipen castle. on that place\u2026\u2026.\u2019His eyes shine with a colour.He thinks up of the shape of the castle in his memories.The military city Ipen located at the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom.\u2018There\u2019s Brant\u2019s library on Ipen\u2019s castle.\u2019Roan unconsciously rolled his fingers.One memory roams in his head.The case that will make the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom noisy.\u2018I have to get in there. But the problem is that only nobles can get inside.\u2019But it didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t have any methods.He still had the merits awards of the commander.\u2018I have to get a permission to get inside Brant library at the merits award.\u2019A faint smile appears on Roan\u2019s mouth.His fingers become itchy.EndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Real congratulations!\u201dCongratulations pour out at the sides.\u201cAdjutant Roan. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cReal congratulations.\u201dA familiar voice.As he turned back to look, he saw the 13th squad commander Tane and vice squad commander Lander.\u201cSquad commander. Why are you acting like that?\u201dRoan laughed awkwardly and shook his hands, but Tane shook his head.\u201cWhen you were a squad commander, I tried to pass the matter because you were younger, but you are now an adjutant. Even if you are younger, a rank is a rank. You have to grab the central focus so we can show our military discipline.\u201dLander added.\u201cOf course. We aren\u2019t a goblin army, so we can\u2019t be comfortable with each other. If you don\u2019t act properly, the guys of the other troops will look down on you.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dAt those words, Roan got silent.Actually, those weren\u2019t wrong words.On top of that.\u2018He was the same as being 38 years old.\u2019There was no need to be caught in the bridle of age.Roan nodded and looked at the two of them.\u201cI look forward to work with you. Squad commander Tane. Vice squad commander Lander.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s us who should be looking forward to it.\u201dTane and Lander slightly bent their heads.Austin, that was looking at the side, nodded with a satisfied expression.\u201cNow it seems like it is spinning properly.\u201dRoan opened his eyes roundly as if implying what did that mean.At those words, Austin said in a low voice as if he was whispering.\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t quite like that the guys in the 13th squad talked to you without any formalities.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cMe too. Me too.\u201dPierce and Glenn butted in.Roan smirked and nodded.\u201cFrom now on, I will take that into account more.And then, a cold voice was heard as if it was breaking the warm atmosphere.\u201cThe bitches really like gossiping all day.\u201dAs he turned to look away, Jack and three other young adjutants were glancing at them.\u2018Is it starting?\u2019Roan smiled bitterly.Actually, Roan\u2019s promotion speed was abnormal.He became squad commander after only one week of having gotten out of the training camp, and again, not even after one month he became an adjutant.\u2018In my last life, squad commander was the end.\u2019But of course, he had many opportunities to climb to become an adjutant of the 7th corps.However, Roan opted to move to the 6th corps, the 5th corps, and the 4th.Because the closer he was to the 1st corps, the more chances he would get caught in the eyes of a noble or a commander.\u2018But in the end, that became a bad choice.\u2019Because of that, he couldn\u2019t even become an adjutant, and kept roaming the battlefield as a squad commander of a spearmen squad and lost his life.\u2018That me climbed to become an adjutant in only two months.\u2019A promotion speed that was so fast that even the envy of Jack and the adjutants wasn\u2019t enough.\u201cWhy are you glaring like that?\u201dJack twitched his brows and approached.A feeling that he would grab his neck at any moment.\u201cRoan.\u201dJack, that stopped right in front of his nose, said as if he was growling.\u201cTell me yourself. For a greenhorn that just got out of the training camp to become an adjutant. Do you think that makes sense?\u201d\u201cI wonder.\u201dRoan shrugged his shoulders.Quite a relaxed expression and attitude.Fire appears in Jack\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat is that attitude? Did you forget that even if we are same adjutants, i\u2019m on a higher rank?\u201dHe was a class 4 adjutant.However, Roan didn\u2019t say anything.Jack continued saying.\u201cListen clearly. This year becomes the 10th one I have roamed the battlefield. I walked a horrible hell road that a greenhorn like you that has only been in the battlefield for two months can\u2019t even imagine.\u201dRoan smiled bitterly.\u2018Look. I walked that road for 20 years. And in the end, even my stomach got pierced.\u2019He forced to gulp down the words that climbed up to his throat.Jack pressed Roan\u2019s forehead with the tip of his finger.\u201cYou have a need to show some respect to me.\u201dRoan looked at Jack\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u2018What is it, this bastard. Those eyes\u2026..\u2019Jack\u2019s eyes contorts.He sensed pity in Roan\u2019s eyes.That was just like he was looking at a child doing something childish.\u201cThi, this bastard!\u201dIn the end, Jack couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and swung his fist.The fist that comes at a close distance.However, Roan\u2019s expression was still calm.\u2018I expected this much.\u2019No, even if he didn\u2019t expect it, Jack wasn\u2019t his opponent.Puk.Roan blocked Jack\u2019s punch with his left arm.\u201cThis bastard.\u201dJack pulled out his arm that got stuck in Roan\u2019s elbow and tried to punch him again.And then, a shout was heard at his back.\u201cWhat are you doing right now!\u201dThe owner of the voice was Keniss.He approached him and separated Roan and Jack.\u2018Spoiled bastards.\u2019The cold sight looks at Jack and the adjutants behind him.\u201cHmph.\u201dJack coughed and fell back.\u201cYou are doing really well for someone who has to trust your backs to your allies.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dRoan bent down first.Keniss looked at Jack.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help it.Keniss clicked his tongue.\u2018Tchtchtch. Jack. it\u2019s too early for you to succeed.\u2019He wanted to say one more thing, but he sighed in the end and shook his head.\u201cWhew. Everyone, return to your tents.\u201dAt those words, Jack and the adjutants moved first.Even while doing that, they didn\u2019t forget to glance at Roan.\u201cRoan.\u201dKeniss called at Roan that was starting to move and stopped him.\u201cYes.\u201dRoan replied and came closer.Keniss let out a sigh and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThe young adjutants will pick a fight with you for quite a while. But you be the one to endure it.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dA short reply.Keniss smiled satisfactorily and nodded.\u201cIf you can\u2019t hold it anymore, use your dueling right.\u201dAt those words, Roan just smiled.\u201cAnyways, just endure it. I will find some solution.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe conversation ended with that.Roan looked at Keniss getting farther and took in a deep breath.\u2018I can take this much of a fight as much as they want.\u2019For him, that had the 20 years of experience, this much was at the level of children\u2019s playing.However, Jack\u2019s expression and attitude was a bit weird.It didn\u2019t seem like he would back down that easily.\u2018In my past life, I was only suffering\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t also want to be like that in this life.And then, the voices of the squad members was heard.\u201cSir adjutant. Don\u2019t worry. If adjutant Jack or the others come to bother you, we will block them.\u201d\u201cWe will protect adjutant Roan.\u201d\u201cJust believe in our 42nd, no, 12th squad.\u201dReliable voices.Roan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cFine. Instead, I will protect you.\u201dThis was the truth.\u2018If I become a monarch, you will become generals.\u2019Roan\u2019s and the squad members eyes burned.******\u201cThat\u2019s not it. This way, you have to do it this way.\u201dA voice that felt really stiffled.The person that was swinging his spear as if he couldn\u2019t understand it at all was Pierce.He followed Roan\u2019s orders and was teaching spearmanship to the 12th squad.However, the process wasn\u2019t quite good.\u201cSo, what\u2019s different from what you are doing to what I am?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same poking.\u201dThe voices that were also stifled.The members of the 12th squad complained towards Pierce.They couldn\u2019t understand the difference between his spearmanship to them at all.\u201cThis is the same? This?\u201dPierce swung his spear again as if he was feeling stuffed.\u201cLook well. I twist my wrist here like this and shake the spear up and down. But the beat you twist your wrists here is half time slow and you can\u2019t even shake the spear proper\u2026..\u201dPierce, that was explaining things earnestly, shut his mouth.Because the expressions of the members of the 12th squad were that of confused faces.\u201cWhew. You don\u2019t understand at all, right?\u201dAt those words, everyone nodded.Pierce let out a sigh as if he couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201cSir adjutant Roan. I\u2019m surrendering. I can\u2019t teach them anymore.\u201dRoan, that was maintaining his spear at the opposite side of the squad members, smiled bitterly.\u2018Is it really impossible?\u2019Roan put into effect the individual training along the squad training.And in this process, he wanted to get help from Pierce.However the result was a great failure.\u2018Well, even in my past life, the ones that could follow Pierce\u2019s instructions amounted to ten.\u2019And unfortunately, even he couldn\u2019t get in that number.Roan\u2019s talent was one problem, but Pierce was also the other factor.\u2018He isn\u2019t useful at all when it comes to teaching.\u2019And the problem is that he is a genius among geniuses.he couldn\u2019t understand why others couldn\u2019t do the things he could.\u2018It\u2019s that guy that made the Pierce spearmanship while being seated in an instant.\u2019Pierce spearmanship, that was picked as the best one among normal soldiers.And Pierce was embarrassed of that spearmanship.To make him teach something normal was the same as something tough.\u2018On top of that, the more he aged, the more peculiar his character became.\u2019The young Pierce was shy and timid.However, as he roamed the battlefield, that character changed mysteriously.\u2018A thoroughly calculative character.\u2019He didn\u2019t give and didn\u2019t receive.He returned what he received.\u2018Because of that, when he became a duke, I couldn\u2019t receive that much help.\u2019And of course, there was a time that he felt disappointed.But he felt more thankful when he treated him as a friend from the same training camp and a fellow soldier rather than boasting about his rank of duke.\u2018Bastard. Would he have cried when I died?\u2019He got curious.\u201cPierce. If perhaps I died, would you\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment he was going to throw the question, he saw Glenn returning.\u201cHuh?\u201dHis brows twitched.Glenn was really beat up.Roan put down the spear and moved towards him.\u201cGlenn. What happened?\u201d\u201cSi, sir.\u201dThe voice that was as down as his looks.Holding his cheek and grabbing his jaw with both of his hands.Roan extended his hands and took off Glenn\u2019s hands.In that instant, he saw the eyes and cheeks that became blue.On top of that, his lips got split up and red blood flowed out.\u201cWho is it?\u201dRoan\u2019s voice lowers.Glenn hesitated and couldn\u2019t reply properly\u201cWho is it? WHo made you like this?\u201dAs he asked again, Glenn lowered his head completely.\u201cAdjutant Jack said that I kept wandering in front of him\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe end of his sentence subsides.Roan stroke Glenn\u2019s head.\u201cDon\u2019t lower your head. You did nothing wrong.\u201dHis face freezes coldly.Roan moved his feet and moved towards Jack\u2019s tent.\u201cWhere is he going?\u201d\u201cIs he perhaps going to adjutant Jack?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it going to become a huge trouble?\u201dThe squad members say extravagantly with a surprised expression.\u201cLet\u2019s follow.\u201d\u201cWe have to stop him.\u201dIn the end, they followed Roan.Meanwhile, Roan crossed rose troop\u2019s camp and arrived in front of the 11th squad, where Jack was.\u201cHuh? That\u2019s Roan over there.\u201dJack discovered Roan first and made invidious remarks.\u2018It should be because of that guy Glenn, or however he was called, right? Even so, what will he be able to do?\u2019He sat on a wooden chair on purpose and acted as if he was relaxed.\u201cOhh! Adjutant Roan. What are you doing he\u2026\u2026\u201dThe words were until there.Roan, that approached right in front of him, kicked Jack\u2019s face.Kick!A heavy sound.Jack rolled on the floor with the chair.\u201cKgh. Thi, this crazy bastard, did he go insan\u2026..\u201dCurses came out by its own.But even so, he couldn\u2019t spit them out clearly.Because Roan was continuing to punch him.Pubuk! Puk!Jack\u2019s face became a face along a thick sound.Pak!The punch lashes through the nose.\u201cKugh.\u201dJack grabs his nose with his two hands and pants.And then, Roan took out a yellow paper from his chest.Duel right.He crumpled the dueling right inside Jack\u2019s mouth.\u201cUuugh! Ugh!\u201dJack tried to spit out the piece of paper but he couldn\u2019t do so.It was because Roan\u2019s left hand was impeding him from doing so.A cold and chilly voice was heard.\u201cSon of a bitch.

Separate them!\u201d\u201cTo resort to violence against someone from a higher rank!\u201d\u201cHis discipline is a mess!\u201dThey seemed to want to hold down Roan immediately.Then, Austin bit his lower lip and blocked them.\u201cFall back!\u201dContinued by Austin, the remaining squad members aligned at the sides.\u201cWhat are you? You aren\u2019t getting away?\u201dVice squad commander Walker, of the 11th squad growled.Austin didn\u2019t get pushed back and talked back.\u201cYou fall back!\u201dCurses came out.\u201cThis fucking!\u201d\u201cFuck, what!\u201dAustin didn\u2019t lose.The 11th squad and the 12th glared at each other.A bloody confrontation.And meanwhile, Roan\u2019s punches continued.Puk! Pubuk! Puk!\u2018If I want to dispirit him, I have to do it certainly.\u2019One of the things he learnt the past 20 years.\u2018If I step on him sloppily, he will climb up again.\u2019Before, he was weak in heart, so he always left things half done.\u2018Because of that, it wasn\u2019t only once or twice that I got backstabbed.\u2019He didn\u2019t want to repeat those mistakes again.Puk! Pubuk!The punches get stuck in Jack\u2019s face continuously.\u201cUuuuuuu.\u201dIt has been long since he already gave up on resisting.He trembled while surrounding his face with his two arms.\u201cFo, fo, forgive me. Fo, forgivemeee.\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be heard clearly because of the dueling right, but he was certainly begging.Only then did Roan stop hitting him.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t apologize to me, but to Glenn.\u201dA cold voice.Jack stood up slowly with a bloody face.\u201cKugh. Kugh.\u201dIt was uncomfortable to breathe because of the completely broken nose.He took out the dueling right that was stuck on his mouth and stood in front of Glenn.\u201cI, i\u2019m sorry. I was, was wrong.\u201dGlenn just nodded slowly at Jack\u2019s miserable face.An adjutant lowered his head to a normal soldier.The 11th squad that was looking the situation bit their lower lips.\u201cKugh! Sir adjutant Jack!\u201d\u201cSir adjutant!\u201dAt the same time, Jack fell as if he collapsed.The 11th squad members hurried and supported Jack with their arms.And then, a rigorous yell was heard.\u201cWhat noise is this!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening!\u201dThe owner of the voices were Gale and Keniss.They walked stomping and frowned after looking at Jack that became a bloody mess.\u201cJust what\u2026\u2026\u201dThey couldn\u2019t finish the sentence.Keniss ordered normal soldiers to move Jack to a tent.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dMeanwhile, Gale asked Roan.\u201cI will tell you the truth as it is.\u201dRoan said the truth without even a trace of lie.\u201cMmm.\u201dKenniss and Gale thought.\u2018So Jack was the first to lay a hand.\u2019\u2018I thought that he was only a naive one.\u2019The sight of the two people lay on Roan.\u201cWhew.\u201dA deep sigh flowed from Gale\u2019s mouth.\u2018He did use a dueling right, but Roan\u2019s action were too severe.\u2019Jack\u2019s face became crushed completely.Roan read Gale\u2019s thoughts and lowered his head.\u201cTroop commander. Although I used a dueling right because of my squad members, I know that my actions were too excessive. I will take responsibility and leave the seat of adjutant.\u201dAt those words, the 12th squad shouted with a surprised expression.\u201cSi, sir adjutant!\u201d\u201cSir adjutant Roan!\u201dAnd they kneeled down towards Gale and Keniss and bent down.\u201cJust take away our reward.\u201d\u201cSir adjutant Roan did that simply because of us.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need no reward. Instead, keep the rank of sir adjutant Roan.\u201dA begging voice and attitude.From the eyes of Gale and Keniss, that were looking at them, shone amazement.\u2018It\u2019s only been one month, but he made the guys from other squads to become one.\u2019\u2018To get the trust of the squad members in this short time.\u2019They got amazed at Roan\u2019s leading abilities.Gale and Keniss looked at each other.\u2018In the end, the fault is Jack\u2019s.\u2019\u2018On top of that, Roan used the dueling right.\u2019Although he exceeded on his actions, it wasn\u2019t that big of a fault to pass a military law.The two looked at each other and slightly nodded.\u201cUhm. Everyone get up.\u201dGale made the members of the 12th squad, that were kneeling, stand up.They shook off the dust in their clothes and smiled.\u201cBecause the meaning of the squad members is really admirable, I won\u2019t pursue this subject anymore.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAustin and the other members sigh out of relief.They ran towards Roan and yelled.\u201cSir adjutant! How good!\u201d\u201cIt turned out really well!\u201d\u201cWhat a relief!\u201dReally happy voices.They were happier than when they received the merits awards.Roan smiled gratified and hugged them all.\u201cIt\u2019s because of you.\u201dAt those words, Glenn lowered his head.\u201cBe, because of me, you were about to receive a big punishment. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and grabbed Glenn\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to feel sorry about.\u201dHe looked at the squad members surrounding him and said.\u201cI told you that I will protect you.\u201dAt those words, Austin broadened his chest as if he couldn\u2019t lose.\u201cInstead we told you that we will protect you.\u201d\u201cRight. We did say that!\u201d\u201cRight. We said that we would protect sir adjutant.\u201dThe squad members said and felt happy.Roan smiled faintly and hugged them once more.Gale and Kennis looked at them satisfiedly.\u201cRoan. He will become a good commander.\u201dGale\u2019s words.Keniss nodded.\u201cYes. If he learns well and grows like this, he will become a general.\u201dAt those words, Gale continued saying.\u201cRight. Perhaps, a great commander that commands the world.\u201dThey felt those things drawing on their eyes.*****After the scandal of Jack\u2019s face having become a mess, Roan\u2019s status became firm.Especially, looking at Jack that finished his treatment trembling whenever he saw Roan, the young adjutants couldn\u2019t think about picking a fight against him.There were some times the 11th squad picked a fight with the 12th, but after they suffered defeat against Pierce, the situation became one that the 11th squad had to be aware of them.For many reasons, the topology of Roan and the 12th squad kept rising inside rose troop.\u201cStarting from now, start organizing your stuff.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dRoan replied loudly and got out of the tent.The smell that was mixed with pieces of metal, blood, horse, and sweat tickled his nose.Breathe.Roan took in a deep breath and looked up the sky.\u2018After 10 days, is it farewell with Pedian\u2019s plain?\u2019The tedious monster subjugation tactic finally ended.After the inundation tactic in Prely river, the 7th corps and Rinse kingsmen kept getting successive victories.The monsters, that were suffering defeat, started to flee towards the boundaries and Grain\u2019s mountain range.The people from Rinse kingdom chose not to chase them.Because having defended Pedian\u2019s plain had achieved their objective.\u2018Now, there\u2019s something I have to do before I leave.\u2019The thing he was postponing because he was hectic.Roan slowly moved and crossed rose troop\u2019s camp.The steps continued outside of it.Step. Step.Roan, that walked for a long while taking in some air, walked towards the troops camp that was located on the border of a hill.\u201cStop!\u201dThe soldiers that were guarding the entrance blocked Roan.\u2018What is this? This greenhorn.\u2019Expressions looking down on him.\u201cThis is thorn troop\u2019s camp. Reveal your name and rank.\u201dAt the words of the big soldier, Roan pointed to his left side of the armor.There were 5 diagonal sticks sticked on it.\u201cI\u2019m adjutant Roan and I belong to rose troop of the 7th corps.\u201dThen, the soldiers that were dispersed, took on firm postures.Looks of taking in military discipline.\u201cSir!\u201d\u2018For this greenhorn to be a class 5 adjutant.\u2019\u2018If I slipped I would have made a big mistake.\u2019Just like they haven\u2019t expected it, the perplexment was also that big.Roan smiled faintly and looked at the soldiers.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Harrison\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven before he finished his sentence, the big soldier replied.\u201cIf you go inside the camp, there will be the 15th squad. He will probably be there.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan nodded and moved.As he got further away, the nervous soldiers let out a sigh.\u201cWhew. What a surprise. I have never thought that that greenhorn was an adjutant.\u201dAnd then, the soldier that was behind him clapped.Clap!\u201cAh! It seems like he is that person!\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dThe soldiers tilted their heads.At those reactions, the soldier that said those things smiled and replied shortly.\u201cGhost of the battlefield.\u201dAt that moment, the soldiers let out exclamations.\u201cAh! Ghost of the battlefield!\u201dAnd then, they turned their heads away and followed Roan\u2019s back.\u201cI did hear that the ghost of the battlefield was a greenhorn that just finished his training camp\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cI thought that he would be well build with big muscles.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really a kid.\u201dVoices filled with surprise.Although they were from another troop, the ghost of the battlefield Roan was also a famous existence for them.Especially after the inundation tactic in Prely river, he became all the more amazing.\u201cI should have shook his hands at least.\u201dOne soldier smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.At those words, the big builded soldier shook his head.\u201cTch tch tch.\u201dClicking the tongue.The soldier that smacked his lips wanted to say something because of the embarrassment, but the big builded soldier hit his shoulder.\u201cYou can do it when he comes out.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dExclamations came out from the mouths of the soldiers.Their sight turns to inside the camp again.*****It wasn\u2019t finding the camp for the 15th squad.Because it was marked outside of it.Roan carefully got on the camp.\u201cWho\u2026\u2026. Huk! Sir!\u201dOne soldier that was doing individual maintenance looked at Roan\u2019s rank and saluted.\u2018The military discipline in thorn troop is really good.\u2019Rose troop was also an excellent troop, but it wasn\u2019t as hard as this.Roan lightly nodded and looked inside the camp.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation.There was a familiar face in the corner of the camp.\u2018Harrison.\u2019The fellow soldier and friend that died 5 years before Roan.The guy that died with a big regret, just like himself.The words he mumbled everyday rang in his ears.Roan moved slowly and stood in front of Harrison.\u201cHarrison.\u201dA low calling voice.\u201cDo, do you know me?\u201dHarrison asked back with a surprised expression.Roan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cI heard the rumors.\u201d\u201cRumors?\u201dHarrison had a confused face.Roan extended his hand.\u201cShall we shake hands?\u201d\u201cYes? Yes.\u201dHarrison hurriedly grabbed his hand.Roan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s a really good hand.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHarrison had an expression he couldn\u2019t understand at all.Roan said in a voice so low it seemed he was whispering.\u201cIt\u2019s a really good hand to shoot an arrow.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, before that, who are you?\u2019The one in front of him was of a similar age with him, no matter how he saw him.If it wasn\u2019t because of the badge of rank that was stuck to the armor, he would have thought that he was a soldier in training.\u2018He should be confused.\u2019Roan had already guessed how Harrison felt.He lightly shook the hand he was grabbing.\u201cI\u2019m a 5 class adjutant from rose troop.\u201d\u201cSir. I\u2019m spearman Harrison from the 15th squad of thorn troop. But\u2026\u2026\u201dHarrison blurred the last part of the sentence and cautiously looked at Roan.\u201cYou heard rumours about me\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dRoan nodded.\u201cRight. They say that there is a really light and clear-eyed soldier among the spearmen of thorn troop.\u201d\u201cDo, do you mean that\u2019s me?\u201dHarrison asked back as if he couldn\u2019t believe it at all.Because even he hadn\u2019t heard those rumours.Roan took a step back instead of replying and nodded.\u201cIf it\u2019s fine with you, should we go outside?\u201d\u201cYes. Yes, i\u2019m fine.\u201dHarrison followed Roan\u2019s back with a half-absent-minded face.And then, one rumour passed by his head.\u2018It\u2019s Roan of Rose troop, he\u2019s that ghost of the battlefield!\u2019A feeling that he got startled awake.\u2018They said that it was a spearman that just finished his training. The rumours were true.\u2019His sight fell on Roan\u2019s back, that was walking in front.\u2018Then that means that he\u2019s the same age as me\u2026\u2026 But to already be an adjutant.\u2019He felt Roan, that was in front of his eyes, to be incredible.Roan, that didn\u2019t even know Harrison was thinking like that, crossed the camp and stopped in front of the tent of one squad.\u2018Here is?\u2019Harrison, that was following him, frowned.\u2018This is the archers tent.\u2019He remembered the words he told him.\u2018Maybe? Was he telling the truth?\u2019When he thought up to there, Roan brought a bow and some arrows.Harrison hurriedly shook his hands.\u201cUm, um sir adjutant Roan. I have never fired an arrow until now.\u201dUrgent voice and expression.Roan just looked at Harrison acting like this.\u2018He was also like this back then.\u2019Harrison was the same in his past life.At the order of an adjutant telling him to fire an arrow, he got surprised and shook his hands.\u2018But everything changed the moment he grabbed the bow.\u2019Roan smiled brightly and after hitting Harrison\u2019s shoulder, he moved his feet.\u201cAh, it\u2019s, it\u2019s true. I have never fired an arrow\u2026\u2026\u201dHarrison frowned and followed his back.They walked out of the camp stood in front of a fence.\u2018There\u2019s a tree at a suitable place.\u2019Roan smiled at the tree that was at the other part of the fence.Give.The arrows and bow given by Roan.Harrison laughed awkwardly and shook his head once more.\u201cSir adjutant Roan. It seems like there\u2019s something wrong you know about me, but i\u2019m a spearman. A spearman. I have never fired an arrow.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dRoan stubbornly lent him the bow and arrows.And grabbed Harrison\u2019s hands once more time.\u201cMy eyesight is good. In my eyes, you have more talent in archery rather than spearmanship.\u201d\u201cEy. Even if it\u2019s good, how can you at the first time\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarrison couldn\u2019t believe it.Roan smiled and shrugged his shoulder.\u201cHarrison. Looking that your eyes are sharp, your chin is small and your neck is long, you are from Owell region, right?\u201d\u201cHow did you\u2026\u2026.?\u201dHarrison grabbed his chin and neck and put a surprised expression.Roan continued saying.\u201cLooking at your hardened skin on your palm and the muscles of your arms, you originally trained with the blade. And it\u2019s only been 5 months since you became a spearman.\u201d\u201cHo!\u201dHarrison opened his eyes roundly and gulped down some air.However, he shook his head and twisted his nose.\u2018It seems like he saw my records.\u2019If that wasn\u2019t the case, he couldn\u2019t guess where he was from and what he trained in with just the sight.And of course, Roan was reading Harrison\u2019s thoughts.\u201cAnd\u2026\u2026\u201dThe sharp sight is directed to Harrison\u2019s left hand.\u201cYou have injured your left hand badly. Your pinky doesn\u2019t bend well, right?\u201d\u201cHuk!\u201dHarrison got surprised in a big way.\u201cTha, how did you know that\u2026\u2026\u2026..?!\u201dHe hurt his left hand immediately after he entered the training camp.He received a blade swung by a comrade while training, and the bone in his hand broke.However he hid it thoroughly from his comrades, squad commander and adjutants, for fear of getting dismissed. And because of that, this truth wasn\u2019t put in any records.\u2018It, it\u2019s true. The eyesight of this person is the real thing.\u2019There was no one that noticed that he had a problem in his left hand.But Roan noticed it the first time he saw it.\u201cBecause of that, it\u2019s difficult to use the spear, right?\u201d\u201cYes? Yes.\u201dHarrison slowly nodded.\u2018This person is a real ghost. A ghost.\u2019A really admiring expression.Roan looked at Harrison and put a bitter smile.\u2018Actually, you were the one that taught me all of this.\u2019It was obvious about his background, but also the injury he was hiding.All of these things were directly told by Harrison.Roan smiled brightly and hit Harrison\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHow is it? You will be able to believe me, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I can believe that\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarrison looked at the bow and arrows and slurred the end of the sentence.Roan pointed at a far away tree with a confident expression.\u201cJust three arrows. If you can\u2019t hit that tree after three arrows, I won\u2019t keep bothering you.\u201d\u201cThree, three arrows?\u201dHarrison put a surprised expression and asked back.\u201cI have really never fired an arrow before.\u201dAn earnest face, as if he was asking to believe him.Roan nodded.\u201cI know. Just at first sight, it seems like that. But if it\u2019s your talent, you will be able to hit that tree.\u201dA voice and expression filled with affirmation.\u2018Even in the past life was like that. You hit the tree with the third arrow. And a tree that was even farther than the one here.\u2019But of course, the time and place was different from then.However, Roan believed.\u2018If it\u2019s that talent that made everyone amazed, you would be able to do it plentily.\u2019He looked at Harrison\u2019s eyes fixedly.Not shaking eyes.\u2018Whew. I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019Harrison couldn\u2019t say anything else and grabbed the bow.\u2018Was it grabbed like this?\u2019He imitated how archers grabbed it.A really awkward shape.Harrison charged an arrow and looked at Roan.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you get disappointed.\u201dRoan just smiled meaningfully instead of replying.\u2018Ey. Whatever.\u2019Harrison pointed the tree and pulled the bowstring.Kiigiiikik.The bow that bend greatly.\u201cKugh.\u201dHarrison gritted his teeth at the bowstring carving at his fingers.Tung!One arrow pierces through the air along a heavy sound.Sueeeee!A sharp sound.Roan and Harrison follow it.Paat!The arrow missed with a big difference.\u2018Well. Right.\u2019Even so, Harrison that was expecting something a little bit, smacked his lips and looked at Roan.\u201cYou saw right? I have never fir\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still two arrows left.\u201dRoan lifted two fingers.\u201cWhew. Understood.\u201dHarrison let out a deep sigh and charged an arrow again.\u2018Damn. Even if I can\u2019t hit it, I would like it if it passes by close.\u2019Even if he was an adjutant, he didn\u2019t want to show an embarrassing sight to Roan, that was the same age as him.A conspicuous colour shines in Harrison\u2019s eyes.\u2018How did the arrow fly again\u2026..\u2019He unconsciously started to change the posture of holding the bow and the posture of pulling the string, little by little.It wasn\u2019t because someone taught him, but he realized it by himself.A smile appears on Roan\u2019s face.\u2018Right. That\u2019s the real appearance of the genius archer Harrison.\u2019And then, a noise was heard.Sueeeeee!The second arrow was fired.Spat!The arrow scratched the tree and passed by.\u201cHuh?!\u201dHarrison looked at Roan with a surprised expression.Roan smiled brightly and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cThere\u2019s still one arrow left.\u201dAt those words, Harrison nodded slowly and charged the last arrow.\u201cWhew.\u201dHe took in a breath and pointed the bow towards the tree.\u2018The last one got bent down towards the right.\u2019Tung.Sueeeeeee!A sharp noise.Gulp.Harrison gulped dry saliva and followed the back of the arrow.\u2018Pl\u2026ease\u2026\u2026.\u2019When the body got twisted on its own.Puuk!The arrow got stuck in the body of the tree with a dull sound.\u201cNice!\u201dHarrison unconsciously clenched his fists and yelled.His chest was beating with strength and his face became bright.The thrilling shudder flowed on all of his body, which he couldn\u2019t feel when he battled as a spearman.\u201cHow is it? You feel good, right?\u201dRoan smiled brightly and approached him.Only then did Harrison release his fist slowly and coughed.\u201cHm. Hm.\u201dHis bright face turned red.Roan grabbed Harrison\u2019s shoulders.\u201cHarrison.\u201dA low voice but with strength, and the hot and transparent eyes that don\u2019t have any lies.\u201cLet\u2019s go together with me.\u201dKung.At that moment, Harrison felt a big rock hitting his head and heart.The breath that gets clogged.They had certainly met today.However, the Roan in front of his eyes showed him a new world.Actually, Harrison was afraid of going to the battlefield as a spearman.Because of the injury in his hand, his spear skills fell compared to that of his comrades.A feeling of becoming a weight to his comrades.Until now, he had endured that oppressive feeling.But if it is the feeling when he fired an arrow.\u2018I think I may be able to enjoy battling.\u2019Harrison\u2019s hand unconsciously moved to his armor.His voice came out as if he was vomiting something hot.\u201cSir! Understood!\u201d*****For now, Roan returned alone to rose troop.\u2018I wanted to bring him immediately\u2026\u2026\u2019But he wasn\u2019t in a situation where he could bring him immediately, as they were in different troops.\u2018On top of that, this isn\u2019t the correct time.\u2019Roan looked at the south sky.\u2018I have to go to Potter region.\u2019A scandal that happened in the past 20 years, and one of the best and biggest scandals that could be picked with your fingers.Roan waited for that huge scandal until now.\u2018There\u2019s two months left until the landslide happens.\u2019Before that, he had to go to Maiel\u2019s mountain that belonged to viscount Potter.\u2018First, I will have to request for a vacation when the merits awards end.\u2019A plan that will last one month, or three months if it takes long.\u2018If I finish what I had planned, I will get back to the squad.\u2019His life will start anew from then.\u2018Until then, it\u2019s obvious for Harrison, but I also have to polish the skills of Pierce, Glenn, and the other members of the 12th squad.\u2019His chest beat.\u2018I will make my own squad, my corps with them as the center.\u2019And as he walks step by step, he will one day surpass being a great general, and become a monarch.Magnificence and heroic temper fills his heart.*****The next day, the soldiers that participated in the monster subjugation in Pedian\u2019s plain, started to withdraw in order.The 7th corps were the very last.After finishing the preparations plentily for 10 days, the genuine withdrawal started.\u2018A lot of things happened in this short time.\u2019Roan\u2019s feelings were new.It was marvelous having returned to the times when he was an 18 year old greenhorn, but most of all, it was more marvelous having become a 5 class adjutant in only some months.\u2018Until now, is it quite a successful life?\u2019He also gained reliable subordinates.\u2018From now on, what kind of things will happen?\u2019He remembered most of the big scandals, but there was no guarantee that those things will happen exactly as his memory.\u2018However, I have the 20 years of experience with me.\u2019If he got a hold of himself and acted calmly, even if some urgent situation came, he would be able to overcome it.His chest kept beating fiercely.\u2018Has life been so fun like this?\u2019A smile appears on his face.The march was certainly exhausted, but his smile became denser.Everything in the world seemed beautiful.EndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Should we go?\u201dRoan slowly moved his feet.As he crossed the camp and arrived at the troop commander\u2019s tent that was in the middle of the camp, Gale was already outside waiting for him.\u201cYour turn finally came. You waited long, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dRoan slightly bent down.Gale took a step and continued saying.\u201cIf it\u2019s the commander of the army corps, you will be able to ask him anything. Then, tell him honestly, without being aware of him.\u201dHe kept explaining Roan about Aaron\u2019s temperament, and the methods about the merits award while moving towards Ipen\u2019s castle.\u2018So he likes direct things rather than hitting around the bush.\u2019Roan put a smile.These little bits of informations become a great strength later on.Meanwhile, Gale and Roan passed through the castle\u2019s door and arrived at the headquarters of the army corps.\u201cSir!\u201dThe soldiers that were guarding the entrance, noticed Gale and saluted.Gale nodded lightly and moved his feet.He was really excited about what price would Roan get on the merits awards.\u201cIt\u2019s troop commander Gale from rose troops, and class 5 adjutant Roan.\u201dAs soon as they informed to the assembly, the huge door opened.\u2018It\u2019s big.\u2019The scale of the assembly was quite big.The ceiling was high and the space was wide.Wooden chairs, that had long backrest, were aligned to the sides and on a slightly higher platform on the center, a huge table was placed.\u2018Corps commander Aaron Tate.\u2019Beyond the table, they could see Aaron.He was in the middle of looking at the many gathered documents.Gale stood in front of the table and saluted.\u201cIt\u2019s troop commander Gale, from rose troop.\u201dRoan also bent down, following him.\u201cIt\u2019s class 5 adjutant Roan, from rose troop.\u201dOnly then did Aaron, that was busy with the documents, raise his head.The 6 middle aged men that were seated next to him put interesting expressions.\u2018So that guy is Roan.\u2019\u2018He is called the ghost of the battlefield.\u2019\u2018The guy with the biggest merits in our 7th corps.\u2019The middle aged men were staff officers that served Aaron.Although their ranks was that of staff officer, it could be said that they were one rank higher than Gale.\u2018So troop commander Richard of the special troop wants him huh?\u2019\u2018Then it really means that he\u2019s a fine guy.\u2019\u2018Should I bring him to our side?\u2019The eyes of the staff all check of Roan\u2019s body.And Roan also didn\u2019t not notice their sights and interest.\u2018I will do what I have to.\u2019Right now, he had to get in Brent\u2019s castle, and after that he would get a vacation and go to Potter\u2019s region.There were no plans at all about moving to another troop or serving another troop commander.\u201cMendel. Read the merits report.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s words, a middle aged man that was next to him and looked modest took out a thick piece of paper and extended it.\u201cI will start from when he discovered the goblin army waiting in ambush at Ale gorge.\u201dMendel started to read the merits Roan achieved minutely from when he returned to the past. Just like the inundation tactic, and what he did on Pedian\u2019s plain.Just by saying that there were more than ten monster commanders he had slain, everybody sighed in amazement.On top of that, at the word of having rescued the allied troops that were about to get annihilated, everybody put surprised expressions.\u2018Didn\u2019t they say that he had just finished his training?\u2019\u2018For an 18 year old guy to render this kind of merits!\u2019\u2018He rendered even more merits than what I have heard.\u2019The staff got astounded and looked at Roan.On the other hand, Aaron\u2019s expression was still calm.He opened his eyes sharply and looked at Roan\u2019s body in detail.\u2018He wouldn\u2019t be hiding his identity, right?\u2019Aaron got up and moved next to Roan.Mendel got surprised for a moment, but he didn\u2019t stop reading the report.Swish.Aaron grabbed Roan\u2019s wrist.\u2018Huh?\u2019Roan hurriedly lowered his head and frowned.\u2018What is it?\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand the sudden actions.And then, a weird feeling entered from the wrist.Just as if he was tickled with a cold feather.It was a feeling that Roan also knew about.\u2018It\u2019s mana.\u2019He had also been through this quite few times because of Pierce, in his past life.And now, Aaron was pouring his mana inside of Roan.Actions to check if Roan had mastered some kind of mana or not.\u2018Is he dubious about me?\u2019Roan bit his lower lips.There was no need to unnecessarily buy suspicion.He softened his stiff expression and lent him his wrist.\u201cWhew.\u201dAfter a moment, Aaron spat a long breath and returned to his place.A difficult smile was on his face, which you wouldn\u2019t be able to discover if you didn\u2019t see his mouth in detail.\u2018He had never learnt mana. Then\u2026\u2026.\u2019It meant that he had slain the monster commanders with simple spear skills.\u2018He slayed an orc troop commander with spear skills that don\u2019t contain mana?\u2019An honestly difficult merit to believe.\u2018Was he lucky? Or were his spear skills that outstanding?\u2019Whatever side it was, it was clear that it was a big strength.\u2018If he was lucky, so be it. If his spear skills are excellent, then there is a need for that.\u2019Soon, happiness could be seen on Aaron\u2019s face.\u201cWIth this, I will finish the report.\u201dMeanwhile, the report about Roan\u2019s merits had finished.\u201cAmazing.\u201dA really amazed voice.\u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing merit.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no flaw in it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s outstanding.\u201dEven the staff officers that were listening to it, raised their thumbs.\u201cI was lucky.\u201dRoan lowered his head.A not excessive humility.He didn\u2019t want to hide the merits.Aaron stared at Roan\u2019s face as if he was going to pierce it, and then asked bluntly.\u201cAs the merit is this big, the reward must also be big. Is there something you want?\u201dIt came.Gale slightly bent down and gave him eye signs.\u2018If there\u2019s anything you want, say it honestly.\u2019He remembered the advice Gale told him when they were coming to the headquarters.Roan slightly bent down and looked at Aaron.\u201cThere is one thing I want.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dAaron let out a slight exclamation.He was thinking maybe, but he hadn\u2019t expected that he really had something he wanted.He continued saying with an interesting expression.\u201cIt\u2019s good because your character is fresh. Right, tell me. If it\u2019s not excessive, I will listen to you.\u201dRoan breathed in.An instinctive choice.A really short silence made Aaron restless.Roan smiled faintly and laughed while replying with a low voice but with strength.\u201cI want to see Brent\u2019s library.\u201dBoom.At that instant, Aaron\u2019s face get clearly contorted.Not only him, the faces of the staff and even Gale\u2019s got nicely contorted.\u2018Brent library?\u2019\u2018He only wants to see Brent\u2019s library for his reward?\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t he out of his mind?\u2019They all seemed prostrated.Aaron got ahold of himself late and forced a laugh.\u201cHo! So you want to see Brent\u2019s library? Is that really the only thing you want?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRoan slightly bent down.He understood how Gale, the staff and Aaron were thinking.\u2018They shouldn\u2019t be able to understand as to why I want to go and see an old library that nobody visits.\u2019Even Roan, if it wasn\u2019t for that object, he wouldn\u2019t even have looked at it.And then, a bald man that was seated next to Aaron frowned and said.\u201cBut wanting to see Brent library means\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe dimmed the last part and put an expression as if it was hard to believe.\u201cDo maybe you know how to read?\u201dAt those words, it was obvious for Aaron, but even Gale put a really surprised expression.\u2018He knows about letters?\u2019\u2018He knows how to read?\u2019Something they hadn\u2019t thought about.\u2018Right. If it\u2019s the guy that developed that appalling strategy and tactic, he may be able to write and read.\u2019Everybody looked at Roan with expressions saying maybe.Roan smiled faintly and replied shortly.\u201cYes. I\u2019m able to read and write.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dAaron let out a loud exclamation.\u2018For a guy that was only a normal soldier until just now knows how to read and write, huh.\u2019Knowing words was an outstanding ability.Excluding the staff officers of the 7th corps, the troops commanders and some adjutants, nobody knew about words.There was no one among normal soldiers that knew how to read and write.And actually, even in Roan\u2019s case, he could barely get the chance to learn after his mid thirties.Because as he became squad commander from the 1st spearmen squad, he became in need to know how to do so.\u2018Well, it\u2019s also partly because of Pierce.\u2019To read the letters Pierce sent him at times, he need to learn the words.\u2018If I learnt a bit earlier, the path to success should have opened much faster.\u2019And that was also one of the regrets in his choices.Anyways, the Roan right now knew how to read and write at the age of 18.\u2018The more I know about him, the more I want him.\u2019\u2018If I can only bring him below me, I will be able to use him well.\u2019The eyes of the staff officers start to shine with a conspicuous color.Rolar felt that he heard noises of his body\u2019s worth rising.Gale bit his lower lip.\u2018Whatever I do, I have to hold him to stay with me. I can\u2019t get this competent person to be stolen by another person.\u2019Regret came flowing late.\u2018It shouldn\u2019t have been 5 class, but I should have at least made him class 3 adjutant.\u2019But it wasn\u2019t late yet.\u2018I will have to reward him once again.\u2019Gale\u2019s eyes shone and emitted light.Then, Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIf you know how to read and write, somewhere like Brent\u2019s library is quite a charming place. Although it is worn out and old, it\u2019s still one of the best libraries in the western parts of Rinse kingdom. But\u2026\u2026\u201dThe last part of his sentence blurs.A weird expression shows on his face.\u201cBecause Brent library hasn\u2019t been taken care of well, it\u2019s no different to ruins. Rather than sight seeing that worn out library, what about receiving another reward?\u201dHe lightly clapped his hands.At the back side of the assembly, one soldier appeared with a cool spear and two fist sized leather bags.\u201cIt\u2019s a spear I bought when I went to the capital of Miller. It was made by one of the blacksmith that\u2019s on the top three of Rinse kingdom, by making tests over and over. I will give you this and silver coins. How is it?\u201dA gently asking voice.Roan looked at the spear and the two leather bags.\u2018It\u2019s certainly a good spear. And there are plenty of silver coins. But\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019He had the travias spear with him, which he couldn\u2019t use yet, and if he got determined on it, he would be able to earn a much higher amount of money.There was only one thing he needed the most right now.It was permission to get in Brent library.\u2018It\u2019s taking a risk.\u2019Roan lowered his head.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I desire aside of seeing Brent library.\u201dA polite yet firm way of talking.At that moment, Mendel frowned.\u201cHow conceited. You dare to our corps commander\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAaron shook his hand and smiled faintly.\u2018How funny. Does it mean that a good spear and two bags of silver is lacking?\u2019He interlocked his fingers and rested his chin on it.\u201cFine. Then I will raise your rank to class 3 adjutant. And if you want, I will also give you a small house near rose troop\u2019s headquarters.\u201dExceptional manners and conditions.\u2018Even so, will you still keep insisting that you want to see Brent library?\u2019An expression as if he was dying to know what kind of answer he will give.Aaron\u2019s corner of eyes and mouth busily raise up and down.\u2018Is he testing me?\u2019Roan slightly turned up his head and looked at Aaron\u2019s two eyes.He remembered the words Gale had said.\u2018The corps commander doesn\u2019t like dressing things up, and likes direct things.\u2019Then, the direct action was the best.Roan lowered his head again and replied.\u201cI have already received many rewards at the merits awards. I received a prize and I also became an adjutant. The spear and prize you have told me about, give that to the ordinary soldiers that risked their lives at the front. It\u2019s because of them that the battle at Ale gorge, inundation tactic at Prely river, and the subjugation of Pedian\u2019s plain turned out to be a victory.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dAaron, the staff and Gale all let out exclamations.\u2018Good.\u2019\u2018He has the qualities of a good commander.\u2019\u2018Excellent.\u2019A satisfied expression.Roan looked at Aaron\u2019s face for a moment and bent his head.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing aside seeing Brent library that I desire.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dA low exclamation flowed from Aaron\u2019s mouth.\u201cSo you say that you will deny the promotion, house, the spear bought from the kingdom and the silver coin bags, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan was still with his head lowered.Aaron just looked at him and shook his head.\u201cBrent library is a place that is only possible to enter by nobles\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe dimmed the last part of the sentence and clapped his hands.Clap!A light sound.\u201cFine. If that\u2019s your wish, I can only listen to it.\u201dAt that instant a bright smile appeared from Roan, that was bending his head.\u2018It\u2019s done.\u2019He hid his expression and replied with a voice filled with strength.\u201cThank you.\u201dHe got the thing he wanted.At least until now, everything was happening as he wanted.EndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you show this, you will be able to get in Brent library.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan bent down deeply and saluted.\u201cAnd also take the spear and the reward.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s words, Roan put a surprised expression.\u201cI can\u2019t end the merits award with just letting you see Brent\u2019s library. Even so, I was planning to give this to you, so take it.\u201dA fresh decision.Roan didn\u2019t decline and humbly received the spear and the bag of silver.\u2018I received more than I thought.\u2019And the merits awards ended like that.Roan saluted towards Aaron and the staff commanders and got out of the assembly.Gale said that he still had things remaining to do, and he remained next to Aaron.\u2018Should I go immediately?\u2019I still had a lot of time before night.\u2018Let\u2019s go right now.\u2019He wanted to find that object even an hour earlier.Roan got out of the troop\u2019s headquarters and went towards Brent\u2019s library located at the middle of Ipen\u2019s castle.A familiar distance.As he walked down the well built road, he saw an antique building far away.The building the magician Louis Brent, that was around this region, built before dying.\u2018The place where Brent\u2019s ring is sleeping.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes twisted softly.*****Louis Brent.A magician that was from the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom, of Ipen\u2019s castle.He became a magician for the royal family of Rinse kingdom after he became a 6 circle master at the age of 57. And after working for 10 years for the royal family, he returned to Ipen\u2019s castle and died after living for 5 more years.Before dying, he built Brent\u2019s library with the permission of Rinse kingdom and left behind his books. After Louis died, many magicians, scholars and nobles found the library to read and study the books he left, but as more time passed, the people going there became scarce.The evaluation of the ones that visited Brent library.As a huge amount of visitors came here, even the rule that only nobles were allowed of entrance appeared.Because of that, this place became a ghost library that no one looked at anymore.\u2018To have built it this well, but to not be able to utilize it properly.\u2019Roan looked at the entrance of the antique building while standing outside of it.\u2018Ian Phillips used the library and academy positively.\u2019Ian, that was an unparalleled strategist, showed his extraordinary skills even with regards to politics and the government.The product of his skills that made the roads maintained and the academy revitalized.\u2018For a competent man, it was important to recruit, but even more so to raise.\u2019Ian believed like that.He thought that just with recruiting, it will end up hitting a dead end.\u2018As the academy got revitalized, many extraordinary commanders, warriors and scholars appeared.\u2019However, that couldn\u2019t end up with a good result.Because a problem that even Ian hadn\u2019t predicted happened.\u2018If that guy just hadn\u2019t made that revolt\u2026\u2026\u2019The guy called as the mad monarch.With the appearance of that guy, Ian\u2019s military enhancing books all became foam and disappeared.\u2018Now that I think about it, he would only be 10 years old now.\u2019He felt bitter.\u2018I will have to meet him before he turns crazy.\u2019For the peace of Rinse kingdom, no, for the precious lives of the civilians.\u201cWhew. But let\u2019s first do what\u2019s in front of me.\u201dRoan covered the stuffy thoughts and moved his feet.He opened the door of the library that was shut tight and as he got in, a bad smell pinched the tip of his nose.\u2018The smell of mold.\u2019The maintenance was more of a mess than what he had thought.On the walls and ceilings that had pretty patterns engraved could be seen it covered with spider webs and black dust.\u201cWho is it?\u201dA young man that was guarding the entrance stood up.Roan opened the paper he received from Aaron.\u201cI want to get in.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s the symbol of Sir Baron Tate.\u201d\u201cThe young man smiled faintly and pointed towards the library.\u201d\u201cYou can go in towards there.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan saluted promptly and opened the door of the library.KigigiWood twisting sounded displeasingly.Boom.As he closed the door and got in, he saw twenty bookshelves turned over.A bigger scale than what he had in mind.\u2018Where was Louis Brent\u2019s biography?\u2019Roan checked the books on the bookshelves meticulously.As he passed the 6th bookshelf, and was on the 7th one.The corner of his mouth rose slightly.\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019The seventh bookshelf.And at the lowest place where he had to kneel down.There was the biography of Louis Brent.In Louis Brent\u2019s biography, that was comprised of 20 books, were recorded the things from when he was born until he died.\u2018Books filled with a lot of useless things.\u2019The evaluation of the world.Because of that, there were almost no people that read all the biography from start to end.\u2018I have to take out the books starting from the 1st one to the 20th one in order.\u2019Roan took out the first book and went towards a table located on a corner.A table of which the upper layer was thicker than the others.Roan placed the book on the upper right part of the table and grabbed it again and went towards the bookshelf.\u2018I have to repeat this until the 20th one.\u2019A really troublesome process.\u2018It\u2019s because of this that no one discovered the hidden ring in the table.\u2019A bitter smile appeared on his face.The reason Brent\u2019s ring got discovered was simply by luck.After 6 years from now on, Brent\u2019s library that was being maintained because of the mess, a fire produced.\u2018Then, all the books that were exposed got lost and even half of the tables got burnt.\u2019And they discovered the ring in the upper layer in the process of organizing the half-burnt tables.\u2018The ring was taken by Baron Aaron Tate.\u2019According to what was told to the world, Brent\u2019s ring was quite an excellent artifact.It was known that according to the amount of mana you had, you would be able to use the sealed magic and properties it had.And of course, these truths were all revealed by the owner of the ring, Aaron Tate.\u2018There\u2019s no way he revealed everything.\u2019But just with the revealed truth, it was certain that it was an extraordinary artifact.\u2018It was really fortunate that they discovered Brent\u2019s ring along with Louis\u2019s letter.\u2019In the letter, the method explaining how to open the upper layer was recorded.And Aaron revealed all of the contents.\u2018Because there was no way to take off the ring before the owner died.\u2019Because of that, even a normal person like Roan could know where Brent\u2019s ring was hidden, and remembered how to find it.He smiled faintly and went towards the table while holding the last 20th book.\u201cWhew.\u201dA nervous face.Roan let out a short sigh and placed the book on the top right part of the table.Pat.At that moment, a faint light started to glow following the corner of the table.\u2018Damn.\u2019At the unexpected situation, he hurriedly turned to look at the entrance.The door was fortunately closed.Anxiousness appeared on Roan\u2019s face.\u2018Disappear quickly. Quickly.\u2019The light seemed to realize how Roan was feeling, and it soon disappeared.OpenAt the same time, a space appeared in the middle of the table and it started to open to the sides.TungFrom the opened space, a square box popped out.A box the size of a book.Roan carefully opened the box.As soon as he opened the lid, he saw a letter the size of a palm.The contents of the letter, that started just like he remembered, was the same. It was written that you had to place the books from the 1st one to the 20th one in order, in the table Louis appreciated, to be able to receive the small gift.A brusque finish.Roan folded the finely and put it on his chest.\u201cSo this is Brent\u2019s ring.\u201dA worn out ring inside the box.It was a coarse ring that didn\u2019t have any patterns, just as if was made roughly with a piece of steel.Roan carefully grabbed the ring.\u201cWhew.\u201dA short breath.He put the ring on the index finger of his left hand.JiiingAt that moment, the ring shrank along a short vibration and transformed to be just the right size of the finger.ShineThe coarse ring that didn\u2019t have any patterns shone brightly and returned to its original shape.An unfailing and cheap ring on the exterior.\u2018I\u2019m rather glad.\u2019There was nothing good in attracting attention.\u2018There are a lot of people among nobles that were attached to jewels.And then, a fresh feeling spread from the ring as the center.\u2018Ah. So this is the temperature regulation.\u2019The actual Roan didn\u2019t know how to handle mana.But even so, he could still use some basic functions it had.And one of those was temperature regulation.\u2018Now, I will be able to keep a suitable temperature on spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\u2019It meant that from now on, he wouldn\u2019t die from the heat or cold.On top of that, you could even control your body heat.Because of that, he wouldn\u2019t sweat from the upcoming training or battles, even if he moved his body.However, there was another feature that Roan really liked.\u2018This much is amazing, but to also have the feature to hide your presence.\u2019A function to hide your presence.It didn\u2019t perfectly hide your presence as outstanding assassins or murderers, but even so, it had an effect of hiding your presence to a certain point.This was a more useful function than what you thought.\u2018It makes my actions difficult to predict.\u2019People gave off a sign before doing an action.And on the battlefield, that point was mostly associated with intent, and indications of the body.There was no bigger advantage than this on the battlefield.\u2018On top of that, when I get to learn how to use mana I will be able to use the hidden abilities and also improve functions such as this one.\u2019The abilities Aaron showed on the past life.\u2018Fireball, magic arrow, blink, shield, healing, etc.\u2019Because of that, he who was a lord of a military castle, got promoted to commander of the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom after he got a hand on Brent\u2019s ring.\u2018I rather feel sorry for Sir Baron Aaron Tate.\u2019Because he took the chance for him to become a commander.\u2019\u2018Anyways, I need to learn mana to be able to use all of the functions this ring has.\u2019His two eyes lit up with fire in them.\u2018I will go to Potter region.\u2019At that place, there was an opportunity, no, a future.Roan organized his thoughts and grabbed the empty box.\u2018First, let\u2019s return to our troop\u2019s camp.\u2019He got what he wanted.He didn\u2019t have any need to keep roaming in Brent\u2019s library anymore.He put the box back on the table.Place. Sushh.The table returned to its original shape after a light sound.Roan moved his feet towards the entrance with a relieved expression.\u2018Ah!\u2019Then, he saw the 20th book of Louis Brent\u2019s biography placed on the table.\u2018Even so, he has given me a big gift\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan returned and after he grabbed the book he walked towards the bookshelf.\u201cI will use it well.\u201dA short greeting.It was when he was planning to go back after he carefully put the book back.Tuk!The book, that was put back firmly, got bounced off.\u201cWhy did this get ou\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan grabbed the book and after looking at the bookshelf without thinking of anything, he froze still.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dThe place that certainly had to be empty.\u2018Box?\u2019There was a box he hadn\u2019t seen there.\u2018Will there maybe be another treasure?\u2019His chest beat.He brought up the memories inside his head.But however he thought, it was something he didn\u2019t remember.Roan carefully grabbed the box.Click.After opening the hand sized box, he saw a strange object inside of it.\u2018This is just like\u2026\u2026.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note:Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Blink.Roan carefully blinked and slowly looked at his surroundings.\u2018There\u2019s nothing different.\u2019The scene in front of him didn\u2019t have anything different.Only, his eyes felt softer and more comfortable.\u2018The functions shouldn\u2019t have disappeared, right?\u2019Roan looked at the far away table with a slightly nervous feeling.His sight got fixed on the side of a thin book that was on the table.At that instant.SwoooooshThe scene before his eyes got bigger as if it was being sucked, and the small and thin book that was far away now looked big.\u2018Hup!\u2019Roan put a surprised face at the unexpected situation.He could see the really small title of the book clearly.\u2018So this is one of the functions Kalian\u2019s tear has.\u2019As he blinked again, the scene returned to the original form.\u2018Amazing. It is indeed amazing, but\u2026..\u2019It was certainly an overwhelming ability, but it was a situation he just couldn\u2019t take casually.\u2018I have to be able to use the abilities and functions skillfully.\u2019Right now, everything was unfamiliar.The moment he amplifies his sight when he is fighting against enemies, his life would get in danger instead.\u2018In the end, it\u2019s training again.\u2019They say that you have to thread the pearls for it to become a treasure.Roan was thinking of doing some training to use Kalian\u2019s tear to its true worth.\u2018In my past life, I have lived solely through effort without even having these sorts of things.\u2019The situation had certainly become better.Based on his efforts, he may really be able to become a monarch.ClickRoan only took out the note out of the box and put it back on the bookshelf.And after he placed back the 20th book of Brent\u2019s biography, it returned to its original shape.\u201cWhew.\u201dHe obtained something he had expected, and something he hadn\u2019t.Roan stood in front of the entrance and organized his clothes.There was only one thing that had changed since when he entered.It was the ring he put on his left thumb.However, there was no need to check cautiously, because it looked like a worn out and old metal ring.\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019Roan carefully opened the door and got out.And then, he heard a childish voice.\u201cAre you Roan?\u201dAn unfamiliar voice.Roan frowned and looked at the place the voice was heard at.A kid that seemed to be on his early 10s.The kid that had white skin, well trimmed brown hair, and clean and high classed clothes, seemed clearly like a noble even at first glance.\u2018The librarian is also really nervous.\u2019The young man that was guarding the entrance also had a really nervous expression.Roan checked on the kid attentively and moved his feet.\u2018Why is he so familiar?\u2019He didn\u2019t know where, but he gave a familiar feeling.Roan stood in front of the kid and slightly bent his head.\u201cYes. I\u2019m Roan.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t reply casually just because he was a kid.Roan was still a commoner, and only a class 5 adjutant of the 7th corps at that.If the kid was a noble, and a son of a prestigious noble family, he had to be careful on even mixing words with him.The kid smiled brightly and extended his hand.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Ian. I\u2019m the eldest son of count Philips.\u201dBoom.At that moment, Roan received a shock similar as getting hit in the back of his head.\u2018Ian Philips? He is that outstanding genius strategist Ian Philips?\u2019He looked at Ian\u2019s face with an absent minded expression.Ian smiled brightly and tilted his head.\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201dA childish voice that shows its childishness.Only then did Roan get a hold of himself and grab Ian\u2019s hands.\u201cAh, that\u2019s not it. If it\u2019s count Philips, he\u2019s from a quite prestigious noble family\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, everything is just an empty name.\u201dIan lightly retorted and shook his hand.The hand of Roan, that became rougher because of the battles through the months, felt strongly different compared to Ian\u2019s soft hands.\u201cYou are more different to what I have thought. I thought that you would look more intelligent.\u201dIan smiled brightly and kept staring at Roan\u2019s face.\u201cI really wanted to meet you.\u201dAt the continued words, Roan\u2019s head became stuffed.\u2018He wanted to meet me?\u2019Even on his past life, they hadn\u2019t met alone even once.Roan didn\u2019t reply hurriedly and just kept looking at Ian\u2019s face.Ian pointed the entrance of the library with his finger.\u201cShall we talk outside?\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan slightly bent his head.Even so as he was a commoner and Ian a noble, and the eldest son of count Philips on top of that, he couldn\u2019t decline.But before that, there was a huge curiosity.\u2018Just why did he want to meet me?\u2019Somehow, his heart throbbed.Ian got out of the library along with Roan, and went to a nearby small tea house.\u2018So these guys are count Philip\u2019s knights.\u2019Roan made some distance with Ian and got astounded when he looked at the guys following them from behind.The flashy armor, the huge blade, and the intent coming out from their bodies was really overwhelming.\u2018I have been conceited until now.\u2019It was obvious for the 7th corps, but the other corps that participated in the monster subjugation also thought that he had some skills.Realistically speaking, there was no one that could follow Roan according toon the merits.\u2018If I just kept it this way, I thought that I would obviously be able to become a great general, and perhaps also a monarch.\u2019Even when he was at Brent\u2019s library just now, he thought of that.However, now that he saw the count\u2019s knights, he got to realize just how much of a frog inside a well he was.\u2018I was at a level where I could boast among normal soldiers.\u2019Even so, he didn\u2019t get depressed or frustrated.\u2018Wait a little. Just a little.\u2019He was confident on being able to become stronger than count Philip\u2019s knights.If he progressed withon his plans steadily and without slacking on putting in effort, he would be able to pass them aton a quite early time.\u2018But of course, everything must happen as I have planned.\u2019It won\u2019t be easy.Even Ian appearing before him was something he hadn\u2019t planned.\u201cDo you want to drink something?\u201d\u201cWater is enough for me.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, I will ask you for a glass of water and a wet tea.\u201dIan skillfully made the order and looked at Roan as if it was interesting.\u201cI don\u2019t like hitting around the bush. The reason I came looking for you is because of the inundation tactic at Prely river.\u201dA smile appears on his mouth.\u201cThey say that it was you that came up with it?\u201dIt was a question Roan hadn\u2019t expected, but he didn\u2019t get perplexed and slightly nodded.\u201cYes. It was me.\u201dOf course, precisely speaking, it would have been the kid Ian in front of him reporting it 5 years from now on.Ian clapped.Clap!\u201cIt was a really outstanding tactic.\u201dHe sticked out his face in front of the table.\u201cI also thought that it would have been good to make an inundation tactic when I looked at the map. However, I judged that there wasn\u2019t the necessary amount of water. Just how did you know that there was a reservoir there?\u201dWords spat out quickly without even breathing once.Roan put on a bitter smile.\u2018It\u2019s also something I got to know after I read your report 5 years from now on.\u2019But of course, he couldn\u2019t say that.Roan replied with a calm expression.\u201cI think that the tactics and strategies are as important as strong weapons and number of soldiers on war and battles. If you have a good strategy, you will be able to defeat thousands, and tens of thousands of enemies with just a few hundreds. So then, how will we be able to make a good strategy?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a question expecting for an answer.Ian looked at Roan with shining eyes and waited for the next words.\u201cI think that a massive amount of information and systematically organized one can make for a good root for strategies.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Ian let out a low exclamation.\u201cThat means that to make a good strategy and tactic, you had already grasped the information in the surroundings of Prely river, right?\u201dWords hitting dead center.Roan slowly nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you collect and analyze even small information that other people don\u2019t even look at, it will become a great help one day.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dIan fell in his thoughts.Roan just sat there and didn\u2019t dare to say anything.\u2018It seems like he realized something.\u2019He realized that Ian was deep his his thoughts organizing things.Meanwhile the water and wet tea came, but no one touched it.After a while, Ian clapped his hands and smiled brightly.Clap!\u201cGood. It became a really good study.\u201dHe, who finished his studies, looked at Roan and raised his thumb.\u201cThanks to you, I became able to draw a picture I like a lot.\u201d\u201cA picture?\u201d\u201cYes. I have a habit of drawing the things I want to do or my dreams inside of my head. And every time, various pictures come out. A cool picture, a roughly drawn picture, a messy picture. And among that, I pick only the cool pictures and draw it myself.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.Ian smiled brightly and took in a deep breath.\u201cThe importance of information\u2026\u2026. A really cool picture has formed. And now, I have to draw it myself.\u201dHe emptied the cup of tea in an instant.\u201cKuha. Sorry. I want to immediately draw the picture, and I can\u2019t hold it in.\u201dIan stood up and extended his hand.Roan lightly grabbed his hand and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Instead, show me that cool picture to me.\u201d\u201cOf course. Half of this picture was drawn by you.\u201dIan lent out a small handkerchief from his chest.\u201cIt\u2019s a handkerchief with symbols of our family. If you come to our place later on, show that. Then, they will treat you as a precious guest.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan carefully received the handkerchief and put it on his chest.\u201cThen, come visit me.\u201dIan shook his hand and hurriedly moved his feet.The knights that were enjoying their teas at nearby tables, hurriedly stood up from their seats.And then, he heard the excited voice of Ian.\u201cIt\u2019s an information organization. First, I will make an information organization inside my territory.\u201d\u201cAn information organization? If it\u2019s information you want, you can buy it at guilds or thieves guilds.\u201dThe knights that were following behind him tilted their heads and said.The last voice of Ian was heard before he got out of the tea house.\u201cThat\u2019s not the picture Roan and I have pictured.\u201dThat was the end.Ian left a bustling atmosphere and left the tea house.Roan got astounded.\u2018So this is how the genius looked ion his childhood.\u2019It was hectic but somewhat pleasant.\u2018By the way, i\u2019m curious as to how the picture he drew with me will look.\u2019Roan placed his hand on his left chest.And there was the handkerchief with count Philip\u2019s symbol.\u2018Did a relation that didn\u2019t exist on my past life happen?\u2019A kind of reliable feeling.\u2018If I can just do it I will take Ian Philips to my side.\u2019If it\u2019s a friend good, and if it\u2019s an ally all the better.Even until now, it was something he hadn\u2019t expected at all.Just how much of an influence did today\u2019s meeting give to Ian.Translator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!I forgot to tell you that coyo started to proof read this novel.

Slow.\u2019Because of Kalian\u2019s tear, his sight-related abilities improved explosively.Even if he saw the same scene, he could grasp a lot more information than before.While he was running over the rocks without stopping, he could clearly see the angle of how the rock was tilted, and how big it was.Tadat!Roan chose a point to land his feet with the sight information as the background and then flew his body.And a small problem appeared right here.He had already finished grasping the information for the other point, but his body still hadn\u2019t reached the first point.In simple words, his body couldn\u2019t follow his sight at all.\u2018In this situation, what\u2019s the meaning of knowing where the spear will come from and where the arrow will fly from?\u2019Because he couldn\u2019t dodge it.\u2018In the end it\u2019s training, training, and more training.\u2019He had to build more strength and stamina than he had now, move a bit faster, and make his body lighter.And it was the same for his spear skills and combat abilities.\u2018So what if I can see the weak points of my enemy? I have to be able to stab my spear into that point.\u2019He needed a lot more effort than before.Tat!Roan once again ran around the rocky zone.Then, a familiar face appeared above one rock.\u201cSir adjutant! Sir adjutant Roan!\u201dA white and soft look.It was Glenn.Roan stopped running and looked at Glenn.At that instant, he saw the face of him that was far away as if it was right in front of his face.\u201cIt\u2019s the withdrawal. The withdrawal has started!\u201dAn excited voice.The withdrawal for rose troop had finally started.\u2018Is it finally withdrawing.\u2019Until Beno castle, where the troop headquarters was located, was 2 days of distance.After two days, the monster subjugation tactic in Pedian\u2019s plain will truly end.\u2018The end of war is always a happy thing.\u2019A faint smile appears on his face.However, his smile turned to a bitter one.\u2018No, it\u2019s not the end of war, but is it resting?\u2019After one more year, the subjugation of Pedian\u2019s plain will start again.Not only that, but more monsters will appear.On top of that, they were in a situation that the other kingdoms and empires could attack anytime.War could never end.\u2018How long will this break last?\u2019He didn\u2019t expect in a big way.Because the first time he grabbed the spear, he decided to live on the battlefield and die there.\u201cEven so, I want to live a long life in this life.\u201dAt least, he wanted to get over 38.Roan smiled faintly and shook his hand towards Glenn.\u201cI will go quickly!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dGlenn yelled back and disappeared below the rock.\u2018Does he like it that much\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan slowly moved his feet and burst out in laughter.It was because of Glenn\u2019s face, was delighted like a child.Then a memory he had forgotten, no, a memory he tried to forget passed through his head.\u2018Ah! His hometown was near Beno castle.\u2019Glenn\u2019s hometown wasDio village, which was near Beno castle.Be was born and raised there.\u2018Meaning that\u2026\u2026.\u2019She, from his memories, also grew up in that place.A faint light shines on his face.He felt a chill, but it wasn\u2019t a displeasing feeling.Only that he felt so nervous he couldn\u2019t hide it.*****At the entrance of the opened Beno castle\u2019s door.The moment Roan got inside the castle, he opened his two eyes roundly and got surprised.\u201cWaaaaaa! Hurray rose troop!\u201d\u201cCongratulations on returning safely!\u201d\u201cRose! Rose!\u201dYells that hit the ears.The people flocked over and an overwhelming crowd was lined up on the streets.\u2018This much cheering\u2026\u2026.\u2019He had roamed the battlefield for 20 years.And during that time, he gained a lot of experiences in returning to a village or a castle, where there was the headquarters.But the cheering he got at those times weren\u2019t comparable to this.\u2018When we won the war against Byron kingdom and returned victorious?\u2019Back then, they also received an amazing cheering.However, that was when the fate of the country was on the line, and they returned victorious from the battle.It wasn\u2019t like returning from a monster subjugation.When Roan looked at the people with a bewildered expression.Among the crowd, cute girls appeared holding one blossom of rose each.Gale and the adjutants got down from the horses as if they were waiting for it and slightly bent down.The girls put the roses on the oxidized armours with shy expressions.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dGentle greetings.\u201cWe are happy because you returned safely.\u201dThe replies of the girls were also pretty and cute.Then, a really small girl walked towards Roan.She had come running after seeing his rank badge.\u201cI\u2019m happy because you returned safely.\u201dThe shy voice of the girl.Roan hesitated for a moment and slightly bent down.The girl moved her little hands and put the rose on one side of the armour.\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan smiled faintly and stroke her head.\u201cHee.\u201dThe girl smiled brightly and then disappeared between the crowd.Even during that, the troop members busily moved their feet.\u201cWaaa!\u201d\u201cRose! Rose!\u201dThe cheers of the people continued.Roan slightly turned his head and looked at the troop members.Everyone were happily shaking their hands with an accustomed attitude.\u2018It seems like they aren\u2019t surprised of this cheer.\u2019It meant that the relationship between the troop and the commoners was good.\u2018He\u2019s a better commander than what I have thought.\u2019He had also felt that Gale was a good commander on his past life.The look of him staying at Ale gorge at the ambush of the goblins to save even one more person.\u2018He should have taken good care of the commoners as his troop members.\u2019So that would be the reason they received this kind of cheering.He saw the headquarters far away.Roan smiled faintly and placed his hand on his left chest.His heart that was excited because of the cheers of the people, got even more excited.Inside his chest there was the small piece of paper Gale had given him before arriving at Beno castle.\u2018The squad members would like it.\u2019The corner of his mouth kept rising.I want to quickly go back to the headquarters and show them the piece of paper.\u2018They will make a fuss.\u2019He was certain of it.Because there was no object like this yellow piece of paper that made him feel more flustered for the past 20 years.Before he knew of it, the entrance of the headquarters was right in front of his eyes.Now, it was the turn for the festival.*****\u201cIs, is it true?!\u201d\u201cReally! Is it really a vacation?\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not 2 nights and 3 days, nor 3 nights and 4 days, but 4 nights and 5 days?!\u201dExpected reactions.No, fiercer reactions than what he had expected.Roan smirked and shook the piece of paper.The piece of paper he had on his chest.The piece of paper Gale gave to Roan before reaching Beno castle was a vacation permit.And it wasn\u2019t a normal one either.\u2018To give the entire squad a vacation.\u2019It was a vacation permit not only for him, but for the entire squad.\u201cSo pack your things already.\u201dAfter he finished saying those things, the squad members scarily packed their things.Scenes of forcefully putting the things they grabbed into the bag.And among them, there was also Austin that used to show a dignified and orderly attitude.\u2018In the face of vacations, their dignity doesn\u2019t have any use.\u2019Roan smiled faintly and just looked at the squad members.It was Roan that lived like an ordinary spearman for more than 10 years on his past life.He knew really well how big of a gift and happiness this vacations were for the normal soldiers.The members of the 12th squad packed their things in an instant.\u201cIt seems to be faster than when you prepare for battle?\u201dRoan put on an ill natured expression.\u201cAhem.\u201dThe squad members laughed awkwardly and coughed.And then Austin, that was nearby him, asked carefully.\u201cSir adjutant. You aren\u2019t going to pack your things?\u201dRoan nodded with a calm expression.\u201cMy hometown is in the mountainsides of Grain, so a vacation of 4 nights and 5 days is meaningless. I\u2019m just planning on resting on the headquarters.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dAustin and the other squad members let out a low exclamation.\u201cThen, I will return earlier.\u201dAustin\u2019s words.Continued by the words of each and everyone of the squad.\u201cI will also return earlier.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cI will also come.\u201dWhen Roan was about to shake his hands while smiling brightly.Austin clapped.Clap.\u201cThen, how about dining together during this opportunity? Let\u2019s drink some beer before we return back to the troop.\u201dAs soon as he ended speaking, the squad members cheered.\u201cOh! That\u2019s good!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dThe cheering sounds filled the room.Austin shrugged his shoulders and looked at Roan.An expression asking \u2018What are you going to do if everyone wants it this much?\u2019Roan smirked and nodded.\u201cEven so, I was planning on drinking together with the squad members. If everyone is fine with it, let\u2019s gather the day before we return to the troop and drink.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dEveryone replied loudly.\u2018They are having so much fun.\u2019Looking at how they are liking it this much, he felt gratified.Clap.Roan clapped and pushed the backs of the squad members.\u201cWell! Now return back to your hometowns! Go and rest well!\u201dThe squad members got pushed as if they were being chased out of the room.Then they saluted while holding their bags.\u201cThen, we will be going.\u201dExcited voices.Roan laughed faintly and shook his hand.\u201cGo.\u201dA short greeting.Austin and the squad members moved their feet towards the entrance of the HQ.Roan just stood still for a long while and just looked at their backs.\u2018They are good guys.\u2019Guys he wanted to be with until the end.A smile appears on Roan\u2019s mouth.And then, a familiar voice was heard.\u201cSir adjutant Roan.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dRoan turned his head and looked at the owner of the voice.\u201cPierce. Why didn\u2019t you leave?\u201dThe owner of the voice was Pierce.He laughed awkwardly and shook his head.\u201cMy hometown is also far. I am just planning on resting at HQ.\u201d\u201cAh. You said that your hometown was in the middle regions, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m from Blei village from the Billington region.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s far.\u201d\u201cYes. It is.\u201dRoan and Pierce looked at each other and smiled bitterly.Even after receiving vacations, they didn\u2019t have anywhere to go.Then, Pierce carefully asked after hesitating for a bit.\u201cShould we have some drinks?\u201d*****It was a strange feeling.Roan took one gulp on the warm beer.\u2018Have I drank with Pierce before\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019He searched his memories.\u2018Ah! It was only once.\u2019After Pierce became a duke.The day before he left to the feudal estate, he returned to the squad\u2019s headquarters and looked for him.\u2018He brought a really expensive wine.\u2019On that day, Pierce just shared the bottle of wine without saying anything and left.Roan also didn\u2019t say a word and just emptied the wine.\u2018Was that our last encounter\u2026.\u2019But of course, they saw each other from far away.However, the difference between the places they were standing was as big as the distance there was between them.Pierce was on a high platform, and Roan was on the lowest place.\u2018It must have been a sort of consideration.\u2019He purposefully distanced himself.And he hadn\u2019t even said that he was a duke, a supreme commander or a noble with his own mouth.Perhaps that could have been some sort of consideration from Pierce.When he was immersed on the old memories.\u201cSir adjutant Roan?\u201dPierce\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWhat are you thinking that much?\u201d\u201cAh, nothing. Only that the past months feel like it passed byas if they were crazy days.\u201d\u201cIt passed by without even knowing what happened and how.\u201dPierce smiled faintly and lifted the cup of beer.Gulp. Gulp.He emptied the cup in an instant and looked at Roan fixedly.\u201cSir adjutant.\u201dRoan just looked at his eyes instead of replying.Pierce\u2019s words continued.\u201cYou know my character really well, right? That i\u2019m shy and timid and don\u2019t even have boldness. I don\u2019t like standing in front of others and i\u2019m sloppy regarding human relationships.\u201dRoan was about to unconsciously nod but stopped.Pierce scratched the table with his finger.Scratch. Scratch.The scratching of the wood was heard.\u201cI have regretted a lot during the training times. Should I just return to my hometown and live off farming? I thought that a lot.\u201dTak.His finger stopped.Pierce looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.A hot eyesight.\u201cBut now, looking at sir adjutant, I felt a lot of things.\u201dRoan waited for the next words.\u201cAmazing tactics, outstanding strategies, amazing spear skills\u2026\u2026. Of course I felt all of these things to be amazing, but there is another thing in which I felt even more amazed.\u201dHe puts strength on his voice.\u201cEffort.\u201dPierce took in a deep breath.\u201cSir adjutant didn\u2019t even miss one day of squad training, troop training, and individual training. And that\u2019s not all.\u201dFire appears on his eyes.\u201cYou put effort on trying to understand the squad members and to comprehend them. You nursed Land all night because he hurt his shoulder, and you searched for a stomach ache medicine all around the troop because of Keep. And\u2026\u2026..\u201dPierce started to talk about the things Roan did for the soldiers of the 12th squad without anyone noticing.Roan smiled faintly.\u201cI just did the things an adjutant has to do.\u201dAt those words Pierce shook his head.\u201cNo. There\u2019s only you that goes to this lengths.\u201dA firm and determined voice and expression.\u201cSir adjutant. You will really become an excellent commander. You will become a great general who will shake Rinse kingdom, no, the whole continent.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cIf I become a great general, you will become the greatest spearman on the continent.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cRight. If it\u2019s your talent, you can do it plentily.\u201dRoan looked at Pierce\u2019s eyes fixedly.Eyes without even a trace of hesitation.\u2018These eyes\u2026\u2026..?\u2019Pierce felt that his heart beat roughly.\u2018It\u2019s the sight he gave me at Int\u2019s forest battle.\u2019Back then Pierce was really afraid while facing the ogres.And Roan just threw a short sentence for that Pierce.\u2018It\u2019s the same eyes.\u2019Eyes that didn\u2019t doubt that he would really be able to become the best spearman on the continent.Pierce bit his lower lip.He looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cIf\u2026\u2026.\u201dHis voice trembles.\u201cIf I get to become the best spearman on the continent, then use me as your adjutant.\u201dAt those words Roan smirked and shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t do that?\u201d\u201cYes? You, you can\u2019t?\u201dPierce asked back with a perplexed expression.Roan slowly nodded.\u201cOf course. I can\u2019t use the best spearman on the continent as only an adjutant. At least, you will have to become a general.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dPierce let out a sigh of relief.And then, looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that promise.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRoan smirked and nodded.And then, he thought of one thing.\u2018If Pierce\u2026\u2026.\u2019The corner of his mouth slightly rises.\u201cPierce.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPierce put down the cup he was holding.Roan asked with a voice so low as if he was whispering.\u201cShould I teach you a spear skill?\u201d\u201cA spear skill?\u201d\u201cYes. There\u2019s one that really fits you.\u201dPierce smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cTeach me!\u201dAnd then, asked with a careful voice.\u201cBut what\u2019s the name of it?\u201dAt those words, Roan laughed a bit awkwardly and replied.\u201cRoan\u2019s spearmanship.\u201dRoan\u2019s spearmanship.Actually, there was no way that existed.\u2018Even so, I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s called Pierce\u2019s spearmanship.\u2019Roan was planning on teaching Pierce Pierce\u2019s spearmanship.Originally, a spearmanship Pierce would make himself 8 years from now on.\u2018If Pierce gets it 8 years earlier, what kind of monster like thing will be born\u2026\u2026.\u2019It can become approach a perfected spearmanship.\u2018If I get to raise a force\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019The new Pierce\u2019s spearmanship, no, Roan\u2019s spearmanship will be of great help.Then, Pierce\u2019s ill-tempered voice was heard.\u201cYes? That\u2019s a name that doesn\u2019t make me want to learn it that much.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201dRoan raised his cup of beer with a calm expression.\u201cAh, no I just\u2026\u2026.\u201dPierce stammered with a perplexed expression.\u201cI know that you were joking.\u201dRoan smirked and shook his hands.Only then did Pierce let out a sigh of relief.\u201cWhew. I got surprised.\u201d\u201cI was also joking. I will teach you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dAs soon as he finished those words, Pierce got up of his seat.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d\u201cHuh? To where?\u201d\u201cYou said that you were going to teach me. Roan\u2019s spearmanship.\u201dAt those words, Roan put on an absent-minded expression.\u201cYou want me to teach you now? We are in the middle of drinking.\u201dAnd as soon as he said that, Pierce grabbed his cup of beer.Gulp. Gulp.His adam\u2019s apple shook up and down.\u201cBurp. We can go now, right?\u201dPierce burped and put down the cup of beer.Roan looked at the emptied cup and smacked his lips.\u201cSir adjutant Roan.\u201dPierce urged with an earnest expression.Roan took in a deep breath and stood up.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go. Go.\u201dHowever, his eyes kept looking at the cup of beer.\u2018It was beer I drank in a long while\u2026\u2026\u2019A feeling of only having wetted his lips.Even so, as he saw the heated up Pierce, he felt a gratified expression.\u2018Then. Shall I teach Pierce\u2019s spearmanship to the genius spearman Pierce, no, Roan\u2019s spearmanship?\u2019A smile appeared on his face.Roan hit Pierce\u2019s shoulder and left the bar one step ahead of him.Pierce hurriedly chased his back.The two people went outside Beno castle.They had consumed alcohol so the soft spring wind made their tongues feel sweet.As they got out of the northern gate and walked for a bit, they saw a wide plain.\u2018This much will be good.\u2019A place better than anywhere to train on the spear.Roan lightly warmed up and looked at the western sky.He saw the bright sunset above the mountains.\u2018Beautiful.\u2019Could leisure have appeared in his heart?It was the first time he thought that the sunset was beautiful since he was born.Then, Pierce\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cSir adjutant Roan. Let\u2019s start immediately.\u201dAn urging sound.Roan smirked and nodded.\u201cOkay. Shall we\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe moment he was about to take off his sight from the sunset.He saw an object running hurriedly on the western plains.\u2018What is it?\u2019Roan concentrated his sight towards the really small and faint object that was far away.At that instant, the scene got sucked in along his sight.The object which he couldn\u2019t see because it was faint now seemed so clear like it was right in front of him.\u201cHuh?\u201dRoan frowned.He hurriedly raised his spear and yelled towards Pierce.\u201cPierce. It seems like we will have to run.\u201d\u201cYes? What are you saying so suddenly?\u201dPierce asked back with a dumbfounded expression.Roan charged to the front instead of replying.Tat!\u201cSomeone is being chased.\u201dAn urgent voice was heard from the place he left.Pierce chased after Roan a bit late.\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201dAt the question being asked in a loud voice, a reply came soon.\u201cA young man.\u201d*****\u201cPant. Pant. Pant.\u201dHis breath rose to his chin.However, he couldn\u2019t stop his feet.\u2018Kugh. Damn. Because I did something I usually didn\u2019t, it seems like I will die alone.\u2019Chris gritted his teeth.His right arm hurt.\u2018Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem deep\u2026\u2026..\u2019Between the sloppily torn clothes, the wound could be seen.Although it wasn\u2019t that deep of an injury, blood still flowed out.\u2018Why did I have to sneeze there, damn it.\u2019Chris looked at the black book he was holding with his left arm.It was the size of a palm and had a thickness of two fingers.\u2018Crazy bastards. To even make an account book while selling people.\u2019Chris slightly glanced back.DudududuTwo people who looked dangerous were riding their horses like crazy.\u2018Damn. It seems like I\u2019ll get caught.\u2019Even if he was fast, he couldn\u2019t be as fast as horses.Chris first chose to run towards the woods in the northeast.It was a decision to lower the speed of the horses by even a little.\u2018I should just have earned money in Miller.\u2019Regret came late.It was a problem of having stepped out because a daughter of a countryside couple had gotten kidnapped.\u2018Although it would be meaningless to regret it now.\u2019The choice was made by him anyways.It was the right thing to do to blame it on him on whatever results happened.It was the right thing to do, he would be blamed for whatever happened as a result.\u2018Good! It\u2019s the woods now!\u2019It was when he was about to get in.A heavy sound was heard.PapapapapangChris didn\u2019t look back.He thought that he could guess the identity of the object.\u2018Bola!\u2019A throwing weapon that was a rope with two weights at the end.Rather than damaging the opponent, it was a weapon used to catch the body or the legs and make them unable to move.Chris gritted his teeth and moved to his right.Tung!The Bola fell right next to him.\u2018Good! I dodg\u2026\u2026.!\u2019When he was busy celebrating\u2026.PapapapapangThe Bola certainly had fallen to the ground but he could still hear a noise.\u2018Damn. There\u2019s one more!\u2019He tried to dodge it, but he was too late and he felt a heavy shock below his knees.The Bola circled the leg and wrapped it.Boom!Chris fell to the ground and rolled.\u201cUghh.\u201dIt was a pain similar to his bones breaking.But even so Chris quickly raised his body.\u2018I have to untie this.\u2019The Bola that tied his legs tightly.His hands urgently tried to untie the rope.And then a black shadow covered him.\u201cWe finally caught you.\u201dA cold voice.Chris gulped dry saliva and raised his head.At that moment he saw a huge foot.Pagak!\u201cKugh.\u201dChris rolled quite a few times with only one kick.\u2018Damn. My handsome face will get messed up.\u2019A useless thought.Then a vicious conversation was heard.\u201cAnd the account book?\u201dA question asked by a man with a pointy chin and thin eyes.The man with a twisted nose pointed at Chris.\u201cFortunately that bastard has it.\u201d\u201cReally? Then take it away from him and kill him quickly.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe man with the twisted nose grabbed Chris\u2019s shoulders with a casual expression.\u2018I can\u2019t die like this.\u2019Chris bit his lower lip and threw away the account book he had in his hand with all of his strength.The account book showed the white pages and disappeared in the grass.\u201cThis crazy bastard!\u201dThe man with the twisted nose cursed and hurriedly ran towards the account book.Then, Chris stood up from the place abruptly.His legs, which were previously tied with the Bola, were cleanly untied.\u2018I thought that I was going to die for untying it without them noticing.\u2019Then, he quickly flung his body to a side.However, he couldn\u2019t make more than three steps.Pagak!The hard and sharp tip of the foot hit his side.\u201cKugh!\u201dHe felt the wind get knocked out of his lungs.Chris grabbed his side and fell.\u201cSon of a bitch. You throw it without even knowing how much it\u2019s worth. Twet!\u201dThe thin eyed man spat and got annoyed.Meanwhile, the man with the twisted nose hurriedly ran and grabbed the account book that was on the ground.\u201cSteve! The account book is fine!\u201dA loud yell.\u201cThen come quickly and cut off the neck of this bastard.\u201dThe man with thin eyes, Steve, talked back annoyedly and got on his horse.SrungThe man with the twisted nose approached slowly and unsheathed his sword.\u201cYou dare to put your hands on an object of our JoyLuce. First I will cut off that bad-mannered hand of yours.\u201dEven Chris realized that the situation had turned out to be quite difficult.\u2018Damn. I couldn\u2019t even fulfill my dream of running a travel agency and will die like this.\u2019He felt that it was kind of unfair.He was only a teen that was on his 22nd year.It was too early for him to die like this.The man with the twisted nose raised his right hand into the air.The sharp blade of the sword shone brightly.\u2018If I knew this was going to happen I would have eaten a lot of meat last night\u2026\u2026\u2019When he was thinking about that.Sweeeee!A sharp noise hit their ears.Everybody\u2019s sight moved to the place the noise was heard.A sharp object came flying over while cutting through the air.That was certainly a spear.The spear precisely separated Chris and Steve.Puk!A heavy noise.The spear that got stuck deep in the earth trembled.\u201cHuk! Wha, what is it!\u201dThe man with the twisted nose was surprised and looked towards the direction the spear came flying from.PshhhThen, the grass started to move roughly and was separated by the sides.\u201cStop right there. Nobody move.\u201dA childish voice but with strength.The person that came out of the grass was Roan.Following him, Pierce appeared.He was looking a bit nervous.Contrary to him, Roan had a really calm expression and moved to pull out the spear stuck in the ground.The tip of the spear was pointed at Steve.\u201cI\u2019m adjutant Roan of Rrose troop from the 7th corps. Reveal your identities.\u201dAt that moment, Steve\u2019s hand was frozen stiff.\u2018Damn. To meet people from the kingdom here.\u2019His eyes rolled to the sides quickly.Then, Chris\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThose bastards are slave merchants!\u201dRight after he finished saying that.\u201cFuck! Norman! Run!\u201dSteve yelled and grabbed the reins.Hihihihing!The horse cried loudly and raised its front legs.\u2018Die!\u2019Steve was planning to stamp down Roan.However, Roan had already read Steve\u2019s intentions.Roan twisted his body and took three steps to the right.He saw the rough movements of the horse slowly and clearly.\u2018He\u2019s full of weak points.\u2019There were tens of places where he could stab the spear.\u2018But my movements don\u2019t follow me.\u2019He tasted bitterness in his mouth.However Pierce, that couldn\u2019t know of this at all, judged that Roan was in an urgent situation.He quickly stabbed out the spear.StabThe spear pierced the body of the horse deeply.Hihihihing!The horse moved its body here and there with rough movements.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cUhhhhhh.\u201dIt was obvious for Steve, but even Pierce couldn\u2019t move properly because he was perplexed.However Roan could see all of these things slowly and clearly.Spat!Roan\u2019s spear slashed through the air.Paat!The spear passed next to Steve\u2019s neck.\u2018It missed!\u2019Steve was happy and once again tried to pull the reins.And then, the spear that was behind him was pulled and hit the back of his head.\u201cUgh!\u201dAmazing strength.His chest got stuck to the horse.\u201cHmph.\u201dRoan snorted and after twisting his wrist, he pulled the spear.Pat!At that moment Steve, that was balancing sloppily, fell down from the horse.\u201cKugh.\u201dA heavy shock felt coursed through his back and waist.Steve frowned and twisted his body.Roan quickly raised his spear upside down and smashed it into the stomach of the man.Puk!\u201cKugh!\u201dA pain that cuts his breath.Steve lost consciousness and fell to the ground.DudududuThen, he heard noisy horse steps.It was Norman.He quickly got out of the forest while Steve was making that fuss.Although Roan tried to chase him, there was a big difference between their speeds.The horse Steve was riding couldn\u2019t move anymore because of Pierce\u2019s attack.Meanwhile, Norman disappeared far away.\u2018Can\u2019t do anything.\u2019He decided to be satisfied on having saved the life of this person.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dAt Roan\u2019s question, Chris nodded.\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine. Thank you for having saved me.\u201dIt seemed unshapely, but he was gentle and respectful.Roan looked at Chris\u2019s face.\u2018I think I have seen him somewhere\u2026\u2026.\u2019He was about to remember but couldn\u2019t.Then, Chris touched his face and tilted his head.\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201dRoan laughed awkwardly and said.\u201cNo. You just seem familiar. Did we meet somewhere else before?\u201dAt those words, Chris shook his head.\u201cNo. Not in my memories. I\u2019m not from over here but from the capital of Miller. I ran errands over there.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dAt that moment, a low exclamation flowed out from Roan\u2019s mouth.Errand runner Chris, from the capital of Miller.There was only one person in his past life that had this characteristics.\u2018Chris. Chris Drain!\u2019He startled awake.Roan looked at Chris with composed eyes.\u2018To meet Chris here\u2026\u2026\u2019Chris.As it was before he got a title of nobility, he still didn\u2019t have the last name of Drain.\u2018The one in charge of Ian Philip\u2019s information agency.\u2019The man that would grasp every piece of information regarding Rinse kingdom 10 years from now on and of course on the continent was standing in front of him.\u2018It wasn\u2019t enough with meeting Ian Phillips, but I even met Chris.\u2019These were all things that didn\u2019t happen in his past life.\u2018On top of that, Chris said that he hadn\u2019t left the capital of Miller until he met Ian Phillips.\u2019That Chris was at the eastern part of the kingdom, and on top of that appeared near the border.Roan asked with a careful voice.\u201cWhat are you doing all the way here when you are from Miller?\u201dAt those words Chris bit his lower lip.\u201cThis is all because of the slave merchants. There is this group called JoyLuce.\u201d\u201cJoyLuce group?\u201dRoan was surprised once more.\u2018If it\u2019s the JoyLuce group\u2026\u2026..\u2019A really familiar name.\u2018The slave merchants we captured while we were moving to Pedian\u2019s plain were certainly called JoyLuce.\u2019\u2018Did the future change because I captured the guys of JoyLuce?\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Previous chapter has been fixed.Translator : SubakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because of that, they could be safe. However they couldn\u2019t stay at Rinse kingdom anymore because they were wanted by the kingdom.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dRoan and Pierce let out low exclamations.This was the first time they got to know that JoyLuce\u2019s group had gotten a bounty.\u201cIn the end, they planned to secretly cross the borders and go to Istel kingdom. But as the main group got caught, they lost a lot of money. And to gain money to escape\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThey would have started to capture slaves again.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris nodded.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. They kidnapped young women or children from countryside villages and sold them at a reasonable price.\u201d\u201cTrash like bastards.\u201dPierce mumbled in a low voice.Roan also nodded while keeping his mouth shut.There was displeasement and rage in his eyes.However, the sins of those guys wasn\u2019t only that.\u201cThat\u2019s not all. They killed people that disturbed them in their work or mutilated their legs and arms and kept them in barns. There were also cases where there were a lot of crazy perverted bastards and personally raped young girls and also made families kill each other.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dRoan and Pierce got a loss for words.The sins of those guys were beyond their imaginations.Chris let out a sigh.\u201cHearing that the daughter of a countryside old couple got kidnapped, I started to chase them.\u201dThe reason why Chris, who originally had to be at Hiller kingdom running errands until he met Ian, appeared on the borders of Rinse kingdom.That was to find the daughter of the old couple.Chris\u2019s expression became dark.\u201cThe results of my investigation state that the daughter was sold somewhere. The moment I was about to give up I found out that they had a sales record.\u201d\u201cSo the thing that crooked nose grabbed and escaped with was the account book.\u201dAs Roan spoke, Chris nodded.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRoan took in a deep breath.\u2018As I caught the main group of JoyLuce, the other slave merchants that were separated started to kidnap young girls and kids to get money to escape. In that process, Chris started to look for a daughter of an old couple that got kidnapped in Miller kingdom. When he coincidentally heard of the situation, he started to chase the slave merchants until the kingdom\u2019s boundaries.\u2019The future he knew clearly changed.\u2018Amazing.\u2019With only a little case, it was followed by completely different results.\u2018Even so, it isn\u2019t that the experience, intelligence and information I gathered for 20 years will disappear. Most of all\u2026\u2026.\u2019A chill appears on his eyes.Roan looked at Chris.\u201cHow many are they?\u201d\u201cTwelve.\u201dChris raised two fingers.Roan asked in a careful voice.\u201cAre you able to move?\u201dChris touched his chin and sides and nodded.\u201cYes, there\u2019s no problem on moving.\u201dAt those words, Roan looked to where Norman fled.\u201cThen, let\u2019s chase them.\u201dAt that moment, his eyes became round wide.Unexpected words.\u201cAre, are you helping me?\u201dSurprise could be felt in his words.Roan nodded.\u201cI can\u2019t just let those trash like bastards cross the boundary. Let\u2019s catch them and take the account book.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to let this be known to the headquarters and ask for help?\u201dChris asked with a worried expression.Even excluding Steve, they were 11.And compared to them, they were only 3.\u201cIf we go there, we will be late.\u201dRoan shook his head.One guy had fled.If this news became known, the slave merchants would try to cross the boundary.\u2018If they cross the boundary, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u2019He had to chase them right now.Chris still had an uneasy expression.\u201cWon\u2019t it be dangerous?\u201dAt those words, Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not important if it\u2019s dangerous or not.\u201dA calm voice but with strength.\u201cThe important thing is to catch them to search for the sold villagers.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dChris lets a low exclamation.\u2018He wasn\u2019t going for the reward?\u2019Actually, he thought that Roan was trying to do the impossible because of the reward.But Roan didn\u2019t think about money, but about the villagers.\u201cLet\u2019s return the kidnapped villagers to their homes.\u201dHe thought that it was something a kingdom\u2019s man had to do.Chris received a big shock.\u2018Was there a kingdom\u2019s man like this?\u2019Was there someone that wasn\u2019t a normal soldier and was above the rank of adjutant that thought like this?There wasn\u2019t.At least, he had never seen one like that.\u2018They are all selfish bastards that worry about filling their bellies.\u2019The old country couple that complained to look for her daughter.The reason why they left their hometown and came all the way to Miller capital was because the kingdom\u2019s men of the region all acted as if it wasn\u2019t their business.\u2018But Miller kingdom was also the same.\u2019In the end he, who was only an errand runner, chased after the slave merchants.The kingdom\u2019s men were that kind of existence.They didn\u2019t show that big of an interest towards normal villagers.At least, the ones he had met until now were like that.However, Roan that was in front of his eyes, was different.\u2018It\u2019s somewhat weird.\u2019A feeling of his heart getting numb.Not a bad feeling.Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cBut for that\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan looked at Chris\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cI need your help. Will you able to chase after them?\u201dAs soon as he finished his sentence, Chris smiled brightly and replied.\u201cOf course. I\u2019m confident on being able to chase them. It\u2019s already been 15 days that I\u2019ve been ontheir tails.\u201dHe spoke with a confident voice and expression.\u2018I want to help. I want to help as much as I can.\u2019He liked Roan.Roan gripped his spear and looked at Pierce.\u201cPierce. There are 11 slave merchants. You are confident, right?\u201dAt those words, Pierce smiled faintly and asked back.\u201cDo you mean with my eyes closed?\u201dHe bragged regardless like usual.That meant that he was that confident.Roan and Pierce tied down Steve on a tree for now.He had completely lost consciousness and wouldn\u2019t get up for a while.\u201cThen, shall we go?\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris nodded and started to run at the front.His chin and sides hurt, but it was endurable.Pababababt.The three people that left the forest started to run on the plains while cutting through the air.Above them, the bright sunset shone on them.A bright scene and the sweet spring wind.A beautiful scenery could be seen.Roan, Pierce and Chris drew a long line on that scenery and ran without stopping.Their relationship started like this.*****\u201cSir commander, we have arrived.\u201dMendel lent a long cylinder.Aaron put aside the documents he was reviewing without ahold of himself and received the cylinder.Click.As he twisted the cylinder, the top part of it separated along with a noise.Aaron put his index finger on the cylinder and took out the rolled piece of paper.As he spread the rolled paper, he saw the words written on it.Aaron kept checking the piece of paper that only had three paragraphs.\u201cMmm.\u201dA satisfied expression.He returned the paper back to Mendel.This time, Mendel was the one to read the contents of the paper.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201dMendel smacked his lips and put back the piece of paper.At those words, Aaron nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s from Grain\u2019s mountainside, and it\u2019s also true that he comes from Peton\u2019s training camp. And the relationship he has with his family is all true. It\u2019s been revealed that everything he has told us is true.\u201dThe corner of his mouth kept rising up and down.It meant that he felt happy.Mendel asked with a dissatisfaction face.\u201cEven so, he\u2019s only a rank 5 adjutant. I think that there\u2019s no need to ask a request to the information guild.\u201d\u201cI wonder. He\u2019s only a class 5 adjutant now\u2026..\u201dAaron paused for a moment and touched his lips with his fingers.A weird light shone on his eyes.\u201cThat guy\u2019s talent won\u2019t end there.\u201dHe looked at Mende\u2019s two eyes fixedly.\u201cRoan certainly has talent to become someone big.\u201dAt those words, Mendel shook his head.\u201cJust because he has talent doesn\u2019t mean that he will succeed. Don\u2019t you also know that well?\u201d\u201cTrue. You also need many things aside of talent.\u201dAaron slowly nodded.His corner of the mouth rose up.A strange smile.\u201cThat\u2019s why i\u2019m going to fill everything excluding talent.\u201dQuite an exceptional declaration.Mendel frowned, having forgotten that Aaron was a commander of an army corps and a noble.\u201cJust what is the reason you are doing that?\u201dIt was quite a provocative way of speaking, but Aaron didn\u2019t show particular reactions.He leaned back on the chair and replied shortly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to end my life with only being a commander of the 7th corps and a baron.\u201dAn extravagant reply.But Mendel didn\u2019t ask anymore.It was because laughter disappeared from Aaron\u2019s face.He covered his face with his two hands.\u2018Anyways, there won\u2019t be a problem unless he is a spy.\u2019Countless plans appeared and crumbled in his head repeatedly.\u2018What I need for now\u2026\u2026\u2019The tip of Aaron\u2019s finger trembled.One of the countless plans was resting on the tip of his finger.******\u2018He is a genius in a completely different meaning.\u2019Roan looked at Chris moving ahead of him and was astounded.He knew that 10 years from now on, Chris would get ahold of all the information on the continent as the person responsible for the agency.But that was 10 years from now on.Most of all, he learned to genuinely gather information after having met Ian.\u2018Now, it would be before even having learnt pursuing skills\u2026\u2026..\u2019Right now, Chris was no different to an errand runner of Miller kingdom.\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201dBut regardless of that, he knew how to instinctively hunt.No, he was learning bit by bit.Faint footsteps, the places where the grass was stepped on, the direction the branch got twisted, and a sense you couldn\u2019t even express with words.Chris chased the slave merchants with much information and used his senses as his guide..Thanks to that, they could catch up to them even before the sun completely set.\u201cFuck. To meet the kingdom\u2019s men in a place like this.\u201d\u201cSo Steve got caught by them?\u201d\u201cYeah. I was watching until he got hit by the spear and lost consciousness.\u201dA really dispirited voice.It was Norman.\u201cDamn. He acted intelligent all alone.\u201d\u201cStupid bastard. I knew it since he always acted great.\u201dThe guys surrounding Norman made cynical remarks.They didn\u2019t think that Roan, Pierce and Chris would chase them.No, they thought that even if they wanted to, they wouldn\u2019t be able to.They moved that fast and tried to leave the least amount of traces.\u201cEven so, we got the account book back. After the sun sets and it gets dark we will cross the boundary.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cFinally, our life of escaping is coming to an end!\u201dA bit excited voices.\u201cWhew. Even so, now that we have some leisure, I\u2019m yearning for some alcohol.\u201d\u201cAlcohol? Kukuku. Women for me.\u201d\u201cWomen? Women are good. Now that I see it, the girl in that country side village really killed it.\u201d\u201cIs it only one or two, the villages we have swept? Kukuku.\u201d\u201cI still remember that 10 year old kid. Kugh!\u201dEvil deeds come flowing out of their mouths.\u2018Trash like bastards.\u2019Roan, Pierce and Chris looked at the slave merchants and bit their lips.\u201cMister Chris, you should wait over here.\u201d\u201cI, I can also help.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris replied back with a low voice but with strength.Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.\u201cIf your role was up to here, from now on we will have to take care of it. Give an opportunity to us too.\u201d\u201cLeave it to us.\u201dPierce stood in front.The blade of the spear, that was pointing at the ground, shone.In the end, Chris slowly nodded and fell back.Roan smiled faintly and made a signal towards Pierce.The signals they had repeated without stop and had memorized.Tat!Roan and Pierce lowered their posture and flung their bodies towards the grass.Quick movements like a flying tiger.Worry appeared on the face of Chris, that was checking on them.\u2018Will they really be able to face 11 people? They seem really young even at first glance.\u2019However you thought of it, 2 vs 11 was a really disadvantageous fight.On top of that, Roan and Pierce looked younger than him.However it didn\u2019t take long until Chris\u2019s worries disappeared.******\u2018What is it?\u2019\u2018What is this greenhorn?\u2019The slave merchants that were waiting for the sun to set glared at Roan and Pierce, who that appeared suddenly from the grass, and frowned.\u201cUoh? Huh?\u201dOnly Norman\u2019s face, that remembered Roan\u2019s and Pierce\u2019s face, turned pale and stammered.The slave merchants were looking at that Norman in a weird way.\u201cTrash like bastards.\u201dRoan\u2019s voice, that was cold and low, rang with strength.At that moment, the faces of the slave merchants contorted.\u201cIs this bastard crazy!\u201d\u201cJust from where did this crazy bastard appear from?\u201dThen, the light of the sunset shined on Roan\u2019s and Pierce\u2019s armor.Only then could their armor, troop badge and rank be seen clearly.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cWha, the kingdom\u2019s men?\u201dOnly then did the slave merchants flinch and fall back.Roan pointed at them with the point of his spear.\u201cI\u2019m class 5 adjutant Roan of rose troop from the 7th corps.\u201dHe looked at the eyes of the slave merchants fixedly.A cold light.Continued by that, the even colder west wind blew.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, simply surrender.\u201dA chilly smile appears on his face.\u201cBut personally\u2026\u2026\u201dHis spear did the talking.\u201cI would like it if you opposed us fiercely.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he picked a place that was good to hide ourselves\u2026\u2026.\u2019They fell in their own trap.They bit their lower lips and exchanged glances.\u2018If we can\u2019t escape, then we can only fight.\u2019\u2018They are 2, and we are 11.\u2019\u2018On top of that, they are real greenhorns!\u2019The class 5 adjutant badge bothered them, but objectively thinking, it wasn\u2019t a situation where they should be afraid.They brought their hands to their waists as if they had all agreed to it beforehand.Srung.A well polished blade appeared along the noise of unsheathing.The slave merchants started to walk towards Roan and Pierce.But only one, Norman, was still standing on his place not knowing what to do.\u2018Tha\u2026. that guy isn\u2019t simply a greenhorn soldier.\u2019He brought up the memories of Steve getting done by helplessly.\u2018His spear skills aren\u2019t normal.\u2019His eyes trembled.Looking at that Norman, the slave merchants clicked their tongues.\u201cThat dumbass. He\u2019s such a scaredy cat.\u201d\u201cFor that bastard to be working as a slave merchant. Tch tch tch.\u201dThey looked at Roan and Pierce and cursed him.\u201cLook greenhorn. What? You said that we were pieces of trash?\u201d\u201cIt seems that you are out of your minds. You are two and we are eleven.\u201dBloodthirst could be sensed on their voices.Roan smiled faintly and grabbed his spear.\u201cHow fortunate.\u201dAt those words, the slave merchants frowned.\u201cWhat? What is fortunate?\u201dRoan just charged to the front instead of replying.Pat!A sharp sound.The spear separated the wind.\u201cHup!\u201dThe slave merchants gulped in some air at the sudden attack.They tried to quickly dodge it, but the spear was much faster.Stab.The spear stabbed the neck just like that.A fast attack without even a hint of hesitation.\u201cFor opposing me roughly just like I wanted.\u201dBang.The slave merchant that had his neck pierced fell down.\u201cThi, this damned!\u201d\u201cThis son of a bitch!\u201dThe other slave merchants charged in late while cursing.The sharp blades came in by the sides.Roan twisted his arms so it got crossed, and after grabbing his spear he turned his body.Pruuuuu!As he twisted his crossed wrists, the spear started to spin quickly.Roan lowered his head at the incoming blades and spinned the spear to the back side of his head.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The blade of the slave merchants got hit by the spear and bounced back.\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cDamn.\u201dCurses spewing out instinctively.But even so, they weren\u2019t on a situation where they could curse freely.Pat!It was because Pierce stabbed his spear to the sides of the bastards.Stab.\u201cKugh!\u201dAnother one fell nully.\u201cSon of bitches!\u201dThe other slave merchants swung their blades while gritting their teeth.\u2018I have to get closer. If I do, I will have a chance.\u2019The spear was a long distance weapon.If they got really close to them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do much.\u201cUaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dThe bastards yelled and jumped in closer to Roan and Pierce.\u201cHmph!\u201dAt that sight, Roan and Pierce snorted and pulled their spears.Spat!The spear slipped smoothly while running through the palm.Roan and Pierce gripped the spear shortly and rose it close to their chests.At the same time, they put the spear on their armpits.Thanks to that, the end part of the spear that should keep shaking because of the weight balance, received a lot of strength.Cheng! Checheng!Roan and Pierce swung the spear on their armpits and the blades of the slave merchants off got bounced off.\u201cIm, impossible!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dExpressions they couldn\u2019t believe and perplexed voices.In the first place, they weren\u2019t even opponents for Roan and Pierce.Then, Roan and Pierce exchanged glances and slightly nodded.At the same time the spun their body to opposite sides.Spat!The long spear that was at the back part cut through the air and hit the sides of the slave merchants.Puk!\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThey got done by helplessly at the sudden attacks.At the pain they felt of cutting their breathing, they held their sides.Roan and Pierce didn\u2019t miss this opportunity.The sharp spear cut through the space and danced.Stab.The spear pierced through the necks of the merchants.In an instant, 8 died and only 2 remained.Even counting Norman that was far away, they were only 3.Pierce\u2019s spear drew an arc and moved softly.Then, the two slave merchants threw their blades away and kneeled down.\u201cUhhhhh. We, we surrender! Surrender!\u201d\u201cWe will give ourselves!\u201dTheir shoulders that trembled pitifully while even lowering their heads.Tuk.Pierce changed the trajectory of the spear and put it up behind him.A soft and perfect finishing touch.\u201cTrash like bastards. You will pay for your sins.\u201dA cold voice.\u201cYes. Yes. We will receive whatever punishment.\u201d\u201cWe are indeed trash. We are trash.\u201dThe slave merchants lowered their heads.A pitiful look whoever saw it.But on the lowered heads, there was a chilly and nasty smile.\u2018Son of a bitch. I can\u2019t end it like this.\u2019His hand that was gripping the earth, slowly moved towards his talon.He grabbed the blade with the tip of his fingers.Pierce smiled towards Roan brightly even without knowing of this situation.\u201cSir adjutant Roan. I\u2019m finishe\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to that point.\u201cDie!\u201dThe guys that were on the ground grabbed their blades and stood up.Even if it was Pierce, that had outstanding talent, it was a difficult situation.Then, a sharp noise hit their ears.Sweeee!Puk!The thing that cut the air and smashed the head of them was Roan\u2019s spear.\u201cHup.\u201dPierce gulped in some air.The blade of the bastards were already touching his side.If it wasn\u2019t for Roan, it would have gotten sliced off.\u2018It was dangerous.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.Thanks to Kalian\u2019s tear, he could see the movements of the slave merchants slowly and clearly.He had thrown his spear even before the blade got unsheathed.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for Kalian\u2019s tear, i would have lost Pierce.\u2019Roan let out a sigh of relief and moved and grabbed his spear.As he put strength on his wrist, the spear that had pierced the heads got pulled out.\u201cPierce.\u201d\u201cYes? Yes. Sir adjutant.\u201dPierce lowered his head with a half absent minded expression.Roan hit his shoulder and smiled faintly.\u201cYou can\u2019t show your back thoughtlessly on a battlefield. And can\u2019t even trust your enemies easily. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I understand.\u201dPierce got ahold of himself late and nodded.He was the best spearman in history but right now he was no different to a greenhorn soldier.He still lacked real experience.\u2018If he keeps roaming the battlefield, it will be something he solves by his own.\u2019There was no way to feel that bothered by it.Roan swung his spear and turned his head.Now, only Roan remained.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe eyes of Roan and Pierce got big.It\u2019s because an unexpected scene had occurred.\u201cI, I really surrender. In the first place, I was planning to give myself in.\u201dNorman pleaded while being on the floor.The surprising thing was his look.The weird thing right now was that he wasn\u2019t putting on any clothes.\u201cI don\u2019t have any blades or weapons on me. Look.\u201dNorman raised his two hands.The reason why he suddenly undressed.It was because he was scared if they would get suspicious for nothing because of the action of the others.Roan smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u2018Even so, I was planning on letting one live.\u2019There may be other slave merchants.\u2018If I inquiry this one and the guy we tied and left on the forest, it will be enough.\u2019Especially on Norman\u2019s case, they felt that he will be really useful as he was a scaredy cat.Then, they saw Chris that was hiding on the grass.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe looked at the corpses of the slave merchants and let out a low exclamation.\u2018They really got rid of 11 people just by themselves?\u2019He viewed Roan and Pierce as amazing.\u2018Well, he would have climbed to be an adjutant at this young age because he has the skills.\u2019Chris sight remained on Roan.\u2018A right nature and outstanding skills. He will certainly become someone big.\u2019Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cShall we look for the account book for now?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dChris got a hold of himself late and moved his feet.Then, Norman that was kneeling down while being undressed, looked on his clothes and took out a black account book.\u201cIt, it\u2019s here.\u201dHe lent it down with his two hands while not being able to raise his head.Chris received the account book and checked the contents of it thoroughly.A surprised look could be seen on Roan\u2019s face.\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201dAt those words, Chris laughed awkwardly and shook his head.\u201cA little bit. There are more words I don\u2019t know about.\u201dRoan still had a surprised expression.\u2018A normal person at this age knows how to read?\u2019It wasn\u2019t an easy thing.And because of that, Aaron and the staff of the 7th corps got surprised big way.Roan asked carefully.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t bother you, may I ask you how you learned to read?\u201dAt those words, Chris replied as if it didn\u2019t bother him.\u201cI bought books while I made money and read it. At first, I didn\u2019t know anything but as I kept on reading, I could see some letters. Well, I also asked to people I had some relation and learned that way.\u201d\u201cIncredible. The cost of the books wouldn\u2019t have been low.\u201d\u201cYes. Because of that, my dream of running a travel agency is getting pushed back.\u201dChris let out a low sigh and shook his head.Then, his finger that was checking on the contents of the books, stopped.\u201cI found it.\u201dA smile appeared on his face.He had discovered the name of the daughter of the countryside couple on the corner of the book.\u201cShe got sold to a millionaire on the region.\u201dRoan checked on the contents and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s the region of Dellon.\u201dAt that instant, Chris put a surprised expression.\u201cHuh? Sir adjutant also knows how to read?\u201d\u201cYes. I also learnt by asking people I had some relation with.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dChris let out a low exclamation again.\u2018He looks even younger than me, but he also knows how to read.\u2019Then, Roan smiled faintly and pointed at the account book.\u201cMay I take this account book with me?\u201d\u201cYes? Why this\u2026..\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the people that got caught and sold off by the slave merchants. I have to return them to their homes, to where they originally were.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dChris shook his head and gave him the account book.Anyways, he couldn\u2019t rescue everyone by himself.\u2018I can\u2019t trust on the kingdoms men but I can trust this person.\u2019Chris looked at Roan with eyes filled trust.Roan looked at the contents of the book for a moment and shrugged his shoulder.\u201cThen, shall we return to our headquarters?\u201dSoon, the sunset had disappeared and darkness fell on the plains.However even on that darkness Roan\u2019s Pierce\u2019s and Chris\u2019s eyes shone brightly.*****First, Roan put Norman and Steve on the prison of the headquarters and went with Gale.Gale listened to the story about JoyLuce\u2019s group and went to the corps headquarters with the account book.And of course, he didn\u2019t forget to congratulate Pierce and Chris before that.Roan and Pierce brought Chris to the infirmary and after healing his injuries they slept for a night.As the day brightened, the three people ate a simple breakfast and went towards the entrance of Beno castle.\u201cYesterday, and today I received a really big help. I will never forget this grace and remember it.\u201dChris bent his head towards Roan and Pierce.\u201cThen, I will be going.\u201dA farewell.Then, Roan took out a pouch that seemed rather heavy from his chest.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dChris didn\u2019t receive it and asked carefully.Roan smiled faintly and replied.\u201cIt\u2019s the reward.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was a not low wanted reward on JoyLuce\u2019s slave merchants.Chris shook his head.\u201cIt was you who caught them.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, it would have been impossible.\u201dRoan forcefully gave him the pocket.\u201cThanks to you we were able to save the innocent people. It\u2019s true that it was thanks to you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dChris hesitated for a moment and lowered his head.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough with having saved my life, but you also give me the reward. I\u2019m really thankful.\u201dA trembling voice.He truly felt thankful towards Roan and Pierce.\u2018Later on, if there\u2019s something I can help with, I will do it.\u2019If he received some grace, he would certainly pay it back.That was Chris\u2019s temperament.\u201cThen, where are you going now?\u201dAs Roan asked, Chris replied while smiling brightly.\u201cFirst, I\u2019m planning on looking for the countryside couple.\u201dIt was decided the daughter of the old couple was going to be rescued by rose troop.Because of that, Chris could lift a weight from his heart.\u201cAnd I will have to return to Miller kingdom.\u201dHe looked at the reward pocket.\u2018The reward was 200 pres.\u2019The salary of a normal person for a year was about exactly 200 pres.It was more amazing than you could think.\u2018If it\u2019s this\u2026\u2026.\u2019It was enough to run a small travelling agency.\u201cWith that much, you will be able to run a small travelling agency.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris smiled shyly and nodded.Roan and Chris had conversed plentifully last night.\u2018He did say that his dream was to run a travel agency. But\u2026\u2026..\u2019He bit his lower lip.Roan knew what talent Chris had and on what field.If it came to this I want to awaken his talent early.\u2018And if I can work with him, all the way better.\u2019He looked at Chris\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cMister Chris. Can I give you a proposal?\u201d\u201cOf course. If it\u2019s a proposal of sir adjutant Roan, it\u2019s always welcomed.\u201dAt those words, Roan said in a voice so low it seemed that he was whispering.\u201cI realized an important truth while working as an adjutant for the kingdom.\u201dA moment\u2019s silence.Chris also gulped dry saliva unconsciously.Roan smiled brightly and continued saying.\u201cAnd that\u2019s the strength information has.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But the reason you are telling this to me\u2026\u2026..?\u201dRoan smiled faintly and pointed to Chris.\u201cI would like it if mister Chris ran an information agency.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dBoom.Chris felt that he had taken a blow from behind.\u201cIn, information agency?\u201dReally unexpected words.\u201cIf it\u2019s handling information you already have the information guild or thieves guilds.\u201dAt those words, Roan shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m not talking about those small scale ones.\u201dThe information guild and thieves guild only gathered information that could make money.And as they only gathered those types of information, it was really limited.On top of that, as they handled things per requests, things were really passive.Chris laughed awkwardly and shook his head.\u201cI have never worked with information and haven\u2019t even thought of it.\u201dOn the other side Roan had a confident expression.\u201cYesterday and today looking at mister Chris, I thought that you had great talent in acquiring information. If my guess is right, you will really be able to run an excellent information agency.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026..\u201dChris couldn\u2019t talk easily.He still felt dumbfounded.\u201cJust because it is an information agency, there\u2019s nothing special about it. You said you will open a travel agency, right? It rather turned out well. If it\u2019s an agency you will of course be able to travel around our Rinse kingdom, and also to kingdoms from other continents. It\u2019s the best job for gathering information.\u201d\u201cYou are telling me to gather information while I run the travel agency?\u201d\u201cYes. A plain one at the eyes of others.\u201dRoan\u2019s words continued.\u201cYou analyze and organize the gathered information and sell it to the ones that need it. If it\u2019s really important information, you cost of it will also be enormous.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dChris fell in his thoughts for a moment.But after a while, he smiled awkwardly and shook his head.\u201cI think that it will be impossible to decide on it immediately. Because it\u2019s a field I have never thought until now.\u201dRoan slowly nodded.\u201cThink plentily and decide then.\u201dA calm expression.But inwardly he felt full of regret.\u2018Is it still not the time.\u2019If it turned out well, he wanted to appoint Chris as the responsible for his information.The effectivity of Chris and his information agency was that excellent.\u201810 years from now on. If it\u2019s early in 5 years. In that time the information era will start.\u2019An era where kingdoms of all continents are swept by calls.An era where small and big kingdoms got scrambled and swept up.\u2018Most of all, a lot of people will die.\u2019Rivers will be created with blood and corpses will create mountains.\u2018If Chris bloomed his skills a bit earlier and ran an information agency it would be of great help.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018I will stop the battles I can, and save the ones I can.\u2019Even if he couldn\u2019t stop the era itself, he wanted to save the most lives he could.\u2018Actually it will be good to become that kind of monarch.\u2019A monarch that doesn\u2019t eat and live well by his own, but one that makes everyone live and eat well.The monarch Roan was dreaming of was that kind of monarch.\u2018Then, I can\u2019t fall back like this.\u2019You couldn\u2019t know how relationships would turn out.He didn\u2019t want to give up here.\u201cWhatever choice you make, I respect your thoughts.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dChris smiled faintly and nodded.Then, Roan took out a rather heavy pouch from his chest.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dChris tilted his head.\u201cIt\u2019s investments.\u201dInvestments?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to invest on you mister Chris.\u201d\u201cHup.\u201dChris gulped in air.An unexpected thing again.Roan\u2019s words continued.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple investment that has nothing to do with you running the information agency or not. I have eyes that can see through people. You will certainly succeed in a big way.\u201d\u201cAh, no anyways\u2026\u2026\u201dChris was still in a perplexed state.Roan didn\u2019t mind and brought his hand to his chest again.\u201cAnd\u2026\u2026\u201dThe thing that came out was Ian\u2019s handkerchief.He smiled faintly and lent him the handkerchief.\u201cIt\u2019s a handkerchief with count Ian Philip\u2019s symbol. If in case you get interested on the information agency, take that handkerchief and go look for him. You can go and look for him. He will be of great help.\u201dAn existence that made you greedy.It wasn\u2019t an easy decision to send that existence away to another person.\u2018However, I can\u2019t ruin Chris\u2019s future because of my greed. Perhaps because of my greed, the information era will become more cruel.\u2019He was planning to give him choices.Himself and Ian.He decided to not mind whether he chose him or Ian.\u2018Even so, I can\u2019t do nothing about the bitterness.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly, and Chris also felt a headache.\u2018Information agency? Investments? Count Philips? Ian Phillips?\u2019The went through many things in a short while.A feeling that his thoughts were getting tied up.But even in the middle of that, there was one certain thing.\u2018Sir adjutant Roan\u2019s feelings are the real deal.\u2019He could clearly feel his will and consideration to help him. Chris took in a deep breath and raised the pocket.\u201cI will use well the investment. I will certainly succeed in a big way and return it back.\u201d\u201cThen you can just buy me a meal.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and shook his hand.Chris\u2019s words continued.\u201cAnd the handkerchief for count Philips.\u201dHe returned it back to Roan.\u201cIt\u2019s something useless for me.\u201dChris looked at Roan\u2019s two eyes fixedly.\u201cIf in case I get interested on the information agency, I won\u2019t go to look for count Philips but to you. Because it\u2019s also been you that taught me about the talent for information I had.\u201dBurning eyes.Roan took in a long breath.\u2018Did it turn out well?\u2019Chris didn\u2019t choose Ian, but him.He was so happy he wanted to jump, but he didn\u2019t show it.Anyways, Chris didn\u2019t find any big meaning in information.\u2018From now on, it will be the important thing.\u2019He had only took a step forward.Roan put back the handkerchief and nodded.\u201cI understand mister Chris\u2019s meaning really well. I will be cheering for you from far away.\u201dAt those words Chris smiled faintly and lowered his head.\u201cI will also be cheering.\u201dNow, they really had to separate.He took back some steps and bent his head.\u201cIf perhaps you visit Miller, come to Lisa street.\u201d\u201cOkay. I will certainly go.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and slightly bent his head.Chris fell back and moved his feet.Because his feet were really quick, soon he couldn\u2019t see his back anymore.\u201cIs his talent really that outstanding?\u201dPierce, that was standing next to him, asked carefully.Roan slowly nodded instead of replying.\u2018He\u2019s one of the young existences that lead Rinse kingdom and also Ian Phillip\u2019s right hand.\u2019Ian chose Chris as the best from even among his men.The talents even an outstanding genius strategist acknowledged.That was right Chris.\u2018Even so, as I talk about young existences\u2026\u2026.\u2019There were some people he remembered.\u2018Rinse kingdom\u2019s four gods.\u2019The four young existences that lead Rinse kingdom from his past life to prosperity.Spear god Pierce, that was called to have the best spear skills and talents from all of history.The outstanding genius strategist Ian.The mad monarch that was perfect in every aspect but one.Goldmaster Sale, that controlled 70% of Rinse kingdom\u2019s commerce rights.\u2018They are guys that will appear 5 years from now on if it\u2019s short, and if it\u2019s long in 10 years.\u2019Fortunately, he knew about them really well.Excluding one.\u2018Goldmaster Sale was the only person that didn\u2019t have his past revealed.\u2019Not only that, but he was a person he didn\u2019t know about his precise age, hometown and of course face.\u2018One day I will meet him. No, perhaps would I already have met him?\u2019He decided not to think about it for long.Anyways, it wasn\u2019t something to be solved just because he thought of it.Roan concentrated on the thing he had to do right now.\u201cPierce.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dPierce tilted his head at the ambiguous words.\u201cWhere\u2026\u2026..?\u201dAt those words Roan shaked his spear.\u201cYou have to learn Roan\u2019s spearmanship.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dPierce let out a low exclamation.And then, he smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cYes! Teach me please!\u201dA loud reply.Just in time, the west wind blowed.*****\u2018I did know that he was a genius\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan looked at Pierce while looking at Pierce.He ran without stop and swung his spear.Pierce took only 4 days on mastering Roan\u2019s spearmanship.Although the place he stepped on was a bit messed up, looking at it overall he got quite familiar to it.\u2018It\u2019s certainly an outstanding spearmanship, but it\u2019s too difficult for normal spearmen to master.\u2019The Pierce of that moment when he had made it, was already high on mana handling.Most of all, he couldn\u2019t comprehend properly about normal people\u2019s talents.\u2018But if it\u2019s now\u2026\u2026\u2019The pierce from now didn\u2019t master mana and lacked battle experience.He was certainly closer to a normal person to when he made it on his past life.\u2018He will be able to develop Roan\u2019s spearmanship to an easier and stronger one.\u2019The reason why Roan taught Pierce.\u2018Because this time he won\u2019t just make it in an instant while being seated, but he will really ponder and investigate to make it.\u2019And he was planning on helping him so he could do so.\u2018If it turns out as planned\u2026..\u2019A smile appeared on his face.\u2018I will be able to make the strongest spearmen squad on the continent.\u2019Roan\u2019s spearmanship that will be born anew.That would certainly become one of the basics for Roan\u2019s strong military force.Then, Pierce put back his spear and approached him with a refreshed expression.\u201cRoan\u2019s spearmanship is really amazing. For a spearmanship to be this strong even without mana.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, train and keep training. Then you will be able to see a new path.\u201d\u201cYes. I will bear it in mind.\u201dThe two person looked at each other and laughed, and then moved their feet.Because the promised time for the 12th squad members to gather had come.As they got in to Karon\u2019s bar, that was the appointed place, they heard a loud voice.\u201cSir adjutant! Here! It\u2019s over here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over here!\u201dThe guys that yell while shaking their arms.They were Austin and the 12th squad.\u201cDid we get a bit late?\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Austin shook his head.\u201cNo. We also got just now.\u201d\u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s someone that\u2019s not even here.\u201dLander said.Roan looked at the squad members and nodded.\u201cGlenn\u2019s missing?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s about to arrive.\u201dAustin laughed awkwardly and replied.Then, Lander shook his hands and butted in.\u201cWell, he will come soon. First, I will order some food and alcohol.\u201d\u201cRight. Do so.\u201dRoan sat on one corner and nodded.Lander ordered various things.\u2018I will also have to take about the vacations today.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.Shortly one month, and if it\u2019s long three months.In that while he had to leave rose troop.He wanted to let this be known to the 12th squad members first.\u2018I will have to say it when it\u2019s about to end.\u2019He didn\u2019t want to break the atmosphere for nothing at the start.Then, big cups of beer filled the table.\u201cIt\u2019s our first squad meeting, so why don\u2019t you say some words sir adjutant?\u201dAustin skillfully set up the atmosphere.Roan didn\u2019t decline and stood up.\u201cYou have done well until now. I ask you to keep doing well.\u201dThere was no need to saw some embarrassing things.Roan raised his cup.\u201cFor the 12th squad!\u201d\u201cHurray!\u201dThe thick wooden cups clashed.\u201cKuh.\u201dA feeling of his insides getting opened.At that sight, Austin and the other squad members also emptied their cups. After the cup of beer got filled a few more times, the ordered food came out.Really various foods.\u201cEat this. It\u2019s good food in the neighbourhoo\u2026..\u201dAustin that was recommending food to Roan looked at the entrance and shook his hand.\u201cGlenn! Over here!\u201dGlenn had arrived.Roan smiled faintly and turned his head towards the entrance.At that instant, every movement turned slow.Just like the world itself had stopped.But this wasn\u2019t because of Kalian\u2019s tear.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan\u2019s sight went past Glenn and directed to the girl that was behind him.Her hair was crisp, but it reached below her shoulders. Thick eyebrows, big and clear eyes, a pointy nose and red lips.White skin unlike a commoner, and slightly bent head as if she was embarrassed.The girl gave out a childish feelign and at the same time a mature feeling coming from a lady.\u2018Seline.\u2019The girl he wanted to forget but couldn\u2019t, and couldn\u2019t forget but he had to.That girl was right in front of him.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m sorry for being late.\u201dGlenn laughed awkwardly and scratched his head.Roan just nodded instead of replying.Glenn pointed towards Seline that was still standing at the entrance.\u201cShe\u2019s my sister Seline. We went to our relative\u2019s house because we had something to do, but the door was locked as if they were outside, so I brought her here. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dGlenn apologized.Roan looked at Seline as if he was barely listening.\u2018Right, she was still a kid at this time.\u2019He was one year older than her.She was stlil a 17 year old girl.Because of that, there was a big difference from Seline from his memories.\u2018We separated on our late twenties.\u2019She was certainly different than then.But the feeling she gave was the same.\u2018How crazy. For my heart to pound while looking at a little girl.\u2019He tried to ignore her, but his heart pounded by it\u2019s own.Then, Glenn\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cSir adjutant Roan.\u201dA really rigid look.\u201cAh.\u201dOnly then did Roan get a hold of himself.\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything if the house is locked. Come along and eat something.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dGlenn lowered his head.Seline, that was near the entrance, smiled shyly and also lowered her head.\u201cThank you.\u201dA soft and nice to hear voice.Glenn and Seline sat at the end of the table.The atmosphere of the meeting changed in an instant.The squad members that were on their early twenties showed great interest towards Seline, that was of the opposite sex.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cYour name is Seline?\u201d\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201dPouring questions.Roan smiled bitterly and raised his cup of beer.\u2018If I decided to forget her, it is right to do so.\u2019He tried not to look towards Seline.However he couldn\u2019t do nothing about the conversations he heard.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have something like a boyfriend. As you see she\u2019s this ugly\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn\u2019s words.\u201cOppa.\u201dSeline called Glenn wit ha low voice, as if she was rebuking him.However Glenn smiled faintly and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cWhat? What about it? You also cook terribl\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOppa.\u201dSeline called Glenn once more time and frowned.\u201cAre you getting angry at me?\u201d\u201cAh, no. That\u2019s not it\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Glenn teased her, Seline\u2019s face turned pink.A shy look.Glenn continued teasing her as if that look of her was cute.Seline got angry at times and pouted her lip.A childish and cute look suitable for a 17 year old girl.Roan sat slantly and listened to the conversation of the brothers.\u2018She missed her brother forever\u2026\u2026\u2019Looking at Glenn teasing her, he thought that it was really fortunate.\u2018Right. I would like it if you were less sad in this life.\u2019Seline\u2019s voice was really sweet and soft.Then, Austin that was next to him, raised a duck meat dish.\u201cEat this.\u201dIt looked like he was giving it to Seline.Roan, that was drinking beer and not paying any attention, raised another dish of meat.\u201cNot the duck.\u201dIn that instant, Austin and the other squad members turned to look at Roan.Only then did Roan realize the situation.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2026.\u2019The words came out unconsciously, and his hands moved first.\u2018Seline can\u2019t eat duck meat.\u2019He still remembered her eating habits and other habits.An awkward silence flowed for a moment.\u201cMm. No, it\u2019s because I like duck meat\u2026\u2026\u201dA poor excuse.\u2018Roan. Do you call that an excuse just now?\u2019When he was rebuking himself.Glenn smiled faintly and received the dish Roan was holding.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give us duck meat. She can\u2019t eat duck meat. Unlike how she looks, she also doesn\u2019t eat a lot of things\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOppa.\u201dSeline pinched Glenn\u2019s side and rolled her eyes.Boom.At that moment, Roan felt a heavy rock sinking in his heart.\u2018Whew. Those eyes\u2026\u2026\u2019Even in his past life, he was weak on her rolling her eyes like that.A feeling that he wants to pinch her cheek right now.Roan raised the cup of beer again.The squad members drank beer for quite a while and talked elatedly.\u201cThen, what\u2019s miss Seline\u2019s dream? You wouldn\u2019t like to become a soldier like Glenn, right?\u201dSeline smiled shyly and shook her head.\u201cThen what do you want to do?\u201dLander asked once more.And Roan also showed interest for this question.\u2018Seline\u2019s dream? What was it? I think that she didn\u2019t want to do anything in particular.\u2019He didn\u2019t remember.He remembered everything about her, but only that part was white like a sheet of paper.Roan gulped down the beer and listened attentively.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeline hesitated for a moment and then continued to say with a bright smile.\u201cI want to become a baker.\u201dBoom.In that moment, Roan felt that someone hit his head really hard.\u2018Baker\u2026\u2026\u2019His face stiffs.\u2018To have forgotten it like a stupid\u2026\u2026..\u2019He couldn\u2019t hold it because he felt pitiful.\u2018Right. She said she wanted to become a baker.\u2019When they first met, and when it hasn\u2019t been while since they started dating, Seline still dreamed of becoming a baker.\u2018But because of me\u2026\u2026\u2019Seline gave up on her dream because of Roan.Fees to buy armour and spears, and also repair fees.The things they had to offer for a promotion.Seline pursued money for Roan instead of her dreams.\u2018But a bastard like me\u2026.\u2019He thought of it as if it was really obvious.That if he just became a great general, he would be able to make her live a good life.The results? The worst of the worst.\u2018Whew.\u2019The sigh surged up until his throat.He couldn\u2019t keep seated anymore.Roan emptied the cup of beer in an instant.\u201cI will get more.\u201dAustin looked at the emptied cup and stood up.Roan shook his hand and raised the cup.\u201cNo. Don\u2019t bother and keep drinking.\u201dA look of smiling brightly.Austin smacked his lips and nodded.Roan lent the cup to the owner of the store and leaned on a wall.\u201cWhat\u2019s your hobby?\u201d\u201cThe food you like?\u201dThe squad members didn\u2019t have any control as they were pouring questions towards Seline.Seline smiled shyly every time and she answered to the question quickly.\u2018Seline.\u2019Roan looked at her bright and cheerful face and bit his lower lip.\u2018The dream you gave up on your past life. I will help you so you can fulfill it.\u2019It still wasn\u2019t a feeling like \u2018I want to meet her again, or love her again.\u2019Now he simply wanted to help her on her dreams.Then, Lander lent a dish.A really spicy pork dish.\u201cEat this too. It\u2019s the most delicious on this store.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah\u2026\u2026..Yes. Thank you.\u201dSeline hesitated for a moment and then nodded.She looked at Lander\u2019s face for a moment and after she smiled faintly she ate a piece of meat.\u201cHow is it?\u201dSeline laughed awkwardly and nodded.\u201cIt, it\u2019s delicious. Really deli\u2026\u2026\u201dThe last part faltered.Her face became red.\u201cWha, what happened?\u201dLander had a really perplexed expression.Then, Glenn that was conversing with the others, looked at Seline\u2019s face.\u201cWhy are you like that?\u201dSeline pointed to a red pork meat instead. Glenn frowned.\u201cYou ate this? You can\u2019t eat spicy stuff.\u201dA rebuking sound.Then, he lent her a cup of water.Seline hurriedly empited the cup of water, but the spiciness still didn\u2019t go away.\u201cHoo. Hoo. Hoo.\u201dShe opened her mouth roundly and let out short breaths.\u201cWha, what do I do? Do, do you want to drink some beer?\u201dThe perplexed Lander lent out a cup of beer.\u201cShe\u2019s still 17.\u201dThe age you could start drinking was 18.Glenn took away the cup of beer and filled it with water again.Then, Roan approached without saying anything and placed down a big wooden cup.\u201cHoo. Hoo. Hoo.\u201dSeline was still breathing out. She looked at the cup and at Roan alternately.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019Her big round eyes asked him that.However Roan returned to his seat without saying anything while drinking beer.Then she felt a really familiar aroma.\u201cHuh?\u201dSeline raised the wooden cup and smelled it.In that moment, a bright smile bloomed.\u2018This is bland tea.\u2019The tea she liked the most.It was a tea which sweet flavor was excellent.She grabbed the wooden cup with both of her hands and drank the tea.A sweet flavor spreading in her mouth.The spicy flavor that even made her teary disappeared.\u201cWhew.\u201dSeline let out a long breath.Her bright face also returned to it\u2019s original colour.Only then did Glenn and Lander seem to calm down.Seline bent her head towards Roan.\u201cThank you.\u201dAt those words Roan smiled faintly and nodded instead of replying.\u2018She really like bland tea. Every time she drank it she said something.\u2019A way of expression used only by Seline.\u2018Does she not use it yet\u2026\u2026\u2019He felt regretful for nothing.Meanwhile, Seline drank one more gulp of the bland tea.\u201cHaa.\u201dA brightly smiling face.It was a face that made everyone who watched her also smile.Roan unconsciously smiled brightly and shook his head.\u2018Every time, after she drank bland tea, she would say dalkang dal\u2026\u2026..\u2019When his thoughts were about there.Seline covered her cheeks with her two hands and mumbled in a low voice.\u201cAh. It\u2019s dalkang dalkang.\u201dHer way of expressing others couldn\u2019t understand.Roan\u2019s corner of the mouth raised.\u2018It\u2019s been a while.\u2019A happy yet dearing feeling.Many scenes popped in his head.Then, Keep\u2019s voice was heard.He had pushed away Lander and sat next to Seline.\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have any boyfriend right? Then, what\u2019s your ideal type?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything like that.\u201dSeline shook her head.But Keep didn\u2019t give up.He pointed towards the others.\u201cThen who do you like the most among them?\u201dSeline looked at the squad members without saying anything.\u201cSir adjutant Roan that\u2019s the similar age as you? Or Pierce?\u201dAt the questions, everyone\u2019s sights were directed to Seline.It seemed like everyone was curious.Even Roan that was sipping some beer acted uninterested, but he was slightly interested actually.Seline hesitated for a moment and carefully said.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen she talked up to then, the door of the store opened abruptly.Boom!At the same time, an urgent voice was heard.\u201cSir adjutant Roan!\u201dRoan, that was concentrating on Seline\u2019s reply, turned his head and looked towards the entrance.\u201cHuh?\u201dHis two eyes that get big.There was a person he hadn\u2019t expected at all standing in the entrance.\u201cSir adjutant Roan. It\u2019s big trouble.\u201dThe man that approaches.Roan stood up with a surprised expression.\u201cMister Chris. Didn\u2019t you leave towards Dellon\u2019s region?\u201dThe owner of the voice.It was Chris that had left Beno\u2019s castle two days ago.*****Roan and Chris got out of the store and entered a secluded alley.\u201cMister Chris. Didn\u2019t you go to Dellon\u2019s region to look for the old couple?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. I tried to.\u201dChris nodded with a serious expression.\u201cBut while I was travelling to Dellon\u2019s region, I heard a weird story.\u201d\u201cA story?\u201dRoan frowned.\u201cYes. It\u2019s a story I heard from the merchants that came from the north, but it seems like they saw a weird scene.\u201dChris continued saying in a voice as if he was whispering.\u201cThat the grass on the plains that had to be grown up were all stepped on it. Just like hundreds of horses ran over.\u201dA weird story.Roan\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cAs it wasn\u2019t barley or wheat, the merchants didn\u2019t report it to the kingdom.\u201dChris\u2019s words continued.\u201cI also thought that it wasn\u2019t important and was about to go to Dellon\u2019s region, but maybe because of my temperament or my uselessly good senses, I wanted to go to check what the problem was on the north. So I went to the place where the merchants saw the weird scene.\u201dHis words became faster.\u201cBut when I was about to cross Kape\u2019s mountain, I discovered a herd moving quickly. Even when they were far away, they moved so fast and roughly that the ground shook. At that moment I got the feeling. That the herd I saw was the one that destroyed the grass.\u201d\u201cCould you also figure out the identity of the pack?\u201dRoan asked carefully.Chris bit his lower lip and nodded.\u201cThe identity of that herd\u2026\u2026.\u201dA voice with a lot of strength.\u201cThey were orcs.\u201dRoan opened his eyes big.\u2018Orcs? An orc troop?\u2019An expression he couldn\u2019t believe it.All the orc troops were pushed away from the boundaries after Pedian\u2019s plain monster subjugation.Because of that, a situation where orcs could move in a troop was impossible.\u2018But there\u2019s no way Chris could have seen wrong.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.Chris\u2019s words continued.\u201cThere are at least 2 thousand orcs in the troop. They were all riding Lopuses.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dRoan forcefully gulped down the exclamation.Lopus.The monster that looked like a monster was smaller than a horse, but it had the characteristic that it was fiercer and attacked you more.\u2018Just what kind of crazy orc, right after the subjugation finishes\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan frowned and looked at Roan.\u201cDid you see the flag of the troop?\u201dAt those words Chris smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cFortunately, I could. The overall of the flag was crimson and was mixed with blue, and in the middle of that a black horizontal line crosses it.\u201dIn that moment, Roan\u2019s face stiffened.\u2018If it\u2019s crimson and blue, it\u2019s the dead Sedek\u2019s troop flag.\u2019A black horizontal line that crosses it.It was a troop flag Roan knew really well.\u2018It\u2019s Violin\u2019s troop.\u2019He looked at Chris and asked carefully.\u201cWasn\u2019t the orc leader leading the troop a female?\u201d\u201cHuh?! That\u2019s right. It was certainly a female orc warrior.\u201dChris put an expression as if how did he know that.Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018Damn. For the wife of Sedek to appear so suddenly.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 40 - Revenge battle (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayViolin.She was an outstanding warrior even among the orcs from Rinse kingdom and she was at the same time the dead Sedek\u2019s wife.Her temperament was especially bloody that she cut off his dick after she realized that her husband Sedek had cheated on her.\u201cThey are moving in a really complicated way evading the kingdom\u2019s men and their territories, but I think that in the end their objective will be Beno castle.\u201d\u201cAnd the reason you think like that?\u201d\u201cLooking at the latest traces discovered and the place I discovered, I realized that they were moving to the southeast. If they keep charging forward like this\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThere will be Beno castle.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris slowly nodded.\u2018He certainly has talent in information.\u2019Roan was slightly amazed.He took out quite a precise guess with Chris\u2019s information.\u2018Even so\u2026..\u2019A faint shadow appeared on Roan\u2019s face.\u2018Is it for her husband\u2019s revenge?\u2019Violin really loved Sedek.Because of that, she couldn\u2019t forgive the cheating Sedek.A love closer to insanity.Her husband that she loved that much died in the hands of a human.\u2018Our rose troop, no, precisely speaking I would be her target.\u2019Seeing that they didn\u2019t raid or attack villages while moving southeast, it was almost certain that they were moving for him.\u2018It\u2019s not a situation to be doing a squad dinner.\u2019Before Violin\u2019s troop arrived, they had to finish preparations.On top of that, their number was 2 thousand.Compared to that, rose troop didn\u2019t even have a thousand men.Roan slightly bent towards Chris.\u201cBecause of you I think that we will be able to prepare for their sudden attack. Thank you.\u201dChris smiled faintly and shook both of his hands.\u201cNo. I\u2019m still far away of repaying your grace. But I was thinking\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe paused for a moment and asked with a little nervous face.\u201cMay I investigate about the orc troop and their route?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dRoan asked back with a surprised face.A really unexpected question.Chris continued saying.\u201cWon\u2019t it be of help just by tracking their route?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201dRoan stopped him with a serious expression.However Chris rather smiled faintly and shook his head.\u201cI think that I will be able to do that much.\u201dA confident voice and attitude.On top of that, he also seemed to have some fun.\u2018He certainly is talented in this.\u2019Roan looked at Chris for a moment and then nodded.\u201cFine. But instead, don\u2019t approach them to the point it gets dangerous.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dChris hit his chest as if implying not to worry.\u2018Even so, you want to run a normal travel agency?\u2019Probably Chris himself wouldn\u2019t be able to hold it because it\u2019s stifling.\u201cThen, I will be going.\u201dChris saluted shortly towards Roan and got out of the alley with fast steps.\u2018Should I also go?\u2019Roan also returned quickly to the store.\u201cSir adjutant.\u201dAustin and the members all stood up.They also felt that the situation wasn\u2019t ordinary.Roan smiled bitterly and looked at them.\u201cI\u2019m sorry but we will have to end this here. Everybody, we are returning to headquarters.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dNobody asked the reason.They only followed Roan\u2019s orders.Roan looked at Glenn.\u201cGlenn. You take your sister. If your familiars still aren\u2019t back, wait and only then return.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Understood.\u201dGlenn nodded with a confused expression.Roan glanced at Seline.It was a short moment, but their eyes met for the first time.Zap.At that moment, a corner of his heart felt numb.\u2018It\u2019s not the time to be like this.\u2019Roan forcefully shook his head and moved his feet.Austin and the 12th squad followed his back.The noisy table became empty in an instant.Seline looked towards the entrance.\u2018Mmm.\u2019She didn\u2019t know why it felt regretful.\u2018WHy is he so familiar?\u2019It was the first time she felt like this in her life.The feeling that she felt something, found it back but lost it again.Her big eyes gleamed with a weird light.******Roan explained the situation to the squad members and went to Gale.\u201cTroop commander.\u201dA sudden visit.Gale, that was enjoying a cup of tea, smiled faintly.\u201cRoan. What happened now? I\u2019m starting to feel scared whenever you come.\u201dWords that he spat jokingly.However, Roan\u2019s face was serious.\u201cThat may really be the case.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dOnly then did Gale realize that the situation wasn\u2019t normal.He put down the cup and looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cAn orc troop is approaching.\u201dA calm voice.But the contents were shocking.\u201cOrc troop?\u201dGale frowned.It was because an orc troop almost didn\u2019t move at this time.Roan moved his feet to the center and pointed a map that was on the table.\u201cThey are moving from the north to the southeast. I guess that their objective is here, at Beno castle.\u201d\u201cJust why\u2026\u2026..\u201dGale frowned and shook his head.Roan told him the story he heard by Chris.Gale\u2019s face stiffened by the time.\u201cDamn. Is it for revenge for his husband\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe let out a sigh and looked at Roan.\u201cYou entrusted that friend with the scouting?\u201d\u201cYes. He wanted to do it himself.\u201d\u201cIs he trustable?\u201d\u201cYes. You can trust in him.\u201dRoan smiled without hesitation.Gale nodded and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cWe will have to go to the troops HQ for now. I will have to report it to the great commander. You can go together, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t decline.Gale soon called Kennis and the adjutants and ordered them to prepare for battle against the orcs.\u201cThen, shall we go?\u201d\u201cYes. I will take the lead.\u201dRoan got on the horse and grabbed the reins.There was 2 days of distance between Beno castle and Ipen castle.If they ran with the horse quickly they would be able to reach within a day.\u2018I wanted to take a vacation, but a battle soon occurs.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and kicked the horse.Hiiiing!The horse let out a long cry and started to run towards the south.Gale also kicked his horse to not fall behind.Dudududu.The horse steps shook the earth.*****\u201cHmm. Mmm.\u201dHumming came out on it\u2019s own.Aaron felt quite happy nowadays.The things he had planned were getting solved well and on top of that he found a guy he really liked.\u2018Roan. He\u2019s only 18 now but he will certainly become big.\u2019His awl in his pocket would show at any moment.If Roan kept accumulating merits, people that desired him would appear.\u2018Before that happens, I have to certainly make him mine.\u2019Countless plans appeared in his head and crumbled. After the pondering, he chose the first card.\u2018Viscount Reil Baker has to show some interest.\u2019Aaron sent a letter to the prodigy spearman Reil. That he discovered a guy worth seeing over.\u2018According to the reports of the adjutants, troop commanders and staff officers, it was standard. But the most amazing point\u2026\u2026..\u2019Was that his skills got noticeably good in just a few months.\u2018According to the report, his skills had changed when he first fought in Ale Gorge and in Prely River. According to Gale\u2019s expression, it was like a newborn became a teenager overnight.\u2019It was certain that he had an amazing talent in the spear.\u2018If he just can learn spearmanship from viscount Reil Baker, becoming the best spearman in the kingdom isn\u2019t impossible.\u2019But of course he had his own worries.If Roan wouldn\u2019t be taken by Reil.But Aaron believed in him.No, he believed in his usual temperament.\u2018Viscount Reil Baker is in a few words, a lone wolf. He doesn\u2019t have interest in power.\u2018Even if he did like Roan, he would only take him as a disciple, he wouldn\u2019t take him fully.\u2019The reason why Aaron could ease himself and send him the letter.\u2018If it just turns out as planned, Roan will be in a big debt with me.\u2019A smile appears on Aaron\u2019s face.He was planning on leaving Roan near him and raise him to become a general.\u2018If Roan grows as my expectations\u2026\u2026..\u2019He won\u2019t\u2019 just become a corps commander from an outer area, but he will be able to get into the center.\u2018But of course, he has to grow according to my expectations.\u2019For that, he had pulled various cards.\u2018If this succeeds, I\u2019m immediately moving to the next one.\u2019His future plans were drawn in his head.\u201cHmm. Mmm.\u201dBecause of that a hum could only come out.On top of that, there was another good notice.\u2018Damn it. Even so, it\u2019s still my birthday\u2026\u2026.\u2019Aaron grabbed a letter that was at a side of the table.A letter his daughter that was studying in Pavor castle sent.It was a letter she sent before leaving towards Ipen castle.\u2018She would be busy studying but she also insists on doing something for my birthday.\u2019For him, Mary Tate was a pretty and commendable daughter.\u2018I should buy some good meat.\u2019The smile on his mouth became denser.Then, the door opened abruptly and Mendel came in.\u201cCorps commander. Troop commander Gale and adjutant Roan came looking for you.\u201dAn urgent voice and expression.\u2018Gale and Roan?\u2019Aaron tilted his head and shook his hands.\u201cTell them to come in.\u201dRight before he said that, Gale and Roan came in.\u201cGreetings to corps commander.\u201dA light salute.\u2018What happened\u2026\u2026..\u2019Aaron frowned.Because Gale\u2019s and Roan\u2019s expression weren\u2019t normal.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAt the short question, Gale gulped down dry saliva and replied.\u201cAn orc troop is charging through.\u201dBoom.In that instant Aaron\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cOrc? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dGale explained the situation he heard from Roan by now.At the same time he spread a map of the eastern parts of the kingdom.\u201cWith the information we have now, we grasped that they came from the north and are charging to the southeast. The number is about 2 thousand. They all are riding lopuses and their objective seems to be Beno Castle.\u201dA heavy silence.Aaron looked at the map with ferocious eyes.\u2018Orcs are charging to the southeast?\u2019A shock like someone hit his head.\u2018It overlaps with the trajectory my daughter makes.\u2019The tip of his hands shake nervously.\u2018It\u2019s been 2 days since Mary departed from Pavor castle. She will soon reach Slan region.\u2019Mary was moving from Pavor castle to Beno castle with a northwest direction.On the other hand, the orc troop was moving southeast.\u2018There\u2019s a high possibility they will meet at Slan region.\u2019Aaron took in a deep breath.\u2018If she gets caught by the orc bastards\u2026\u2026..\u2019Aaron shook his head.A situation he didn\u2019t even want to think of.For Mary\u2019s safety, he had to secure Slan region.\u2018However we can\u2019t face the orc troop in an open field.\u2019Just because of one daughter, he didn\u2019t want to corner his underling soldiers.His pondering deepened.\u2018Is it my daughter, or the soldiers.\u2019Aaron fell in a deep thought between the roles of father or commander.However Gale, that wouldn\u2019t know of this, was burning inwardly.A situation where even a minute was urgent.\u201cCorps commander?\u201dHe called out to Aaron carefully.Aaron looked at Mendel\u2019s, Gale\u2019s and Roan\u2019s faces fixedly.\u2018I am their commander.\u2019Soldiers are no different to his children.\u2018I\u2019m sorry. Mary.\u2019While he was finishing his thoughts, he made a decision.\u201cTheir number aren\u2019t that big, and as all of them are riding lopuses, close the castle gates and battle them as a fortress. I will dispatch troops from the corps headquarters.\u201dHe made the order not as a father but as a commander.\u2018Mary\u2026\u2026\u2019His chest boiled.Then, Mendel opened his mouth with a complex expression.\u201cCorps commander. If you do that, your daughter\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cStop. Don\u2019t talk anymore.\u201dAaron shook his hand.He tightly bit his lower lip.\u201cWe are sending a messenger towards Mary.\u201d\u201cBut we don\u2019t know if the messenger will even\u2026\u2026.\u201dBang!Aaron hit the table.\u201cThen do you want me to drive my soldiers to a corner just to rescue one daughter of mine!\u201dA loud yell.Only then did Mendel shut his mouth and step back.His face was frozen stiff.\u2018Corps commander\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Mendel knew how well Aaron loved and appreciated Mary.\u2018He always lived with boasting and praising.\u2019Even this time, he became so happy he was about to jump when Mary said that she would come to take care of his birthday.\u2018That corps commander chose his underlings instead of his daughter.\u2019A cruel decision.Mendel could feel Aaron\u2019s boiling emotions.Then, Aaron sent the order with such difficulty it seemed that he was vomiting something hot.\u201cSend a messenger to Mary.\u201dGale and Roan grasped the situation late.\u2018His daughter is coming to Ipen\u2019s castle right now!\u2019They could understand why Aaron was pondering for a long while.But just because of that, they couldn\u2019t battle in an open field.\u2018There\u2019s no reason to face the orcs that are riding lopuses.\u2019As they grasped their surprise attack, they would close the castle gates and battle like that.In the current situation, this tactic was the most adequate.Aaron took in breaths and pointed towards the map.\u201cI will send you troops from the headquarters, so close the gates and prepa\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat he said until there Roan, who was silent until now, let out a short sigh.He looked at Aaron, Gale and Mendel.\u201cRoan. Do you have something to say?\u201dAaron frowned and asked back.Roan shook his head with a short sigh.\u201cWe can\u2019t battle that way.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For her to charge straight towards Beno castle without plundering and pillaging means that her rage towards rose troop is really that great.\u201dHe didn\u2019t reveal himself to be her target of revenge.The three others nodded.Roan continued saying.\u201cIn this kind of situation, when Violin arrives and finds that the gates are closed how will she act?\u201dThe three couldn\u2019t answer.Roan drew a line around Beno castle.\u201cIf it\u2019s the hot tempered and violent Violin, she would annihilate every village around Beno castle.\u201dBoom.In that instant, the three faces stiffened.A problem they hadn\u2019t thought about.\u2018We just thought that we only had to block their surprise attack.\u2019We thought that Beno castle shouldn\u2019t fall in danger.\u2019Thoughts that amounted that much.However Roan was thinking what would happen even after that.\u2018Well, there was a similar case in previous battles.\u2019As the situation was urgent, they had even forgotten that there was a precedent.Aaron looked at the map with a serious expression.\u201cCertainly, if it\u2019s the crazy female warrior Violin, there\u2019s a high possibility she will do that.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t make the surroundings of Beno castle a wasteland.Aaron looked at Roan.\u201cThen you think that we have to battle them on an open field?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA short reply but filled with confidence.Aaron looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cThen what region would be suitable?\u201dAt those words, Roan replied without hesitation.\u201cObviously, Slan region.\u201dHe pointed the northwestern part of Beno castle.\u201cThis region is the starting point in the northwest, and there are villages surrounding it. To stop Violin\u2019s troop he have to take Slen region as the starting point and make a blockade towards the northwest.\u201dA voice filled with certainness.The three of them ruminated the words and looked at the map.Just like Roan\u2019s words, there were many villagers living in the northwestern part of Slen region.\u2018We have to defend Slen region to save the villagers.\u2019\u2018We have to build lines in the northwestern part of the region.\u2019They all looked at Roan with surprised looks.\u2018He\u2019s a really amazing guy.\u2019\u2018Compared to others, he has the ability and insight to look through situations.\u2019\u2018Until where does his abilities spread to?\u2019Praises they couldn\u2019t say it out loud.Roan pretended not to notice that and pointed at the map.\u201cBut this region is an open field. It\u2019s an advantageous area for the orc troop that are riding lopuses.\u201d\u201cThen what do we do?\u201dAaron, Mendel and Gale looked at Roan while having forgotten their rank.\u201cI will have to go there myself. I want to check the topography of the region as well.\u201dHe had experienced many things for the past 20 years and remembered a lot of information and knowledge, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t remember much about things related to Slen region.At those words Aaron nodded.\u201cFine. I will go to the corps headquarters and give you the best horse.\u201d\u201cNow that it turned out like this, I would like to go along with the 12th squad.\u201d\u201cDo so.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan lowered his head.Aaron, Gale and Mendel looked at him with a fixed gaze.\u201cIn this situation, it\u2019s almost impossible to bring troops from another region.\u201dThey needed quite a lot of time to prepare preparations and travel all the way to Slen region.Aaron continued saying.\u201cI will dispatch you troops from the headquarters, so drive back Violin.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dGale, Mendel and Roan bent down.Aaron\u2019s eyes calmly sank.\u2018If they can only defend Slen region\u2026\u2026..\u2019The safety of the villagers would be acquired, but he could also get Mary\u2019s safety.killing two birds with one stone.His sight directed to Roan.\u2018Roan. I\u2019m begging you.\u2019Soon, even Aaron was depending on Roan.Roan was now holding a big importance inside the corps, even without him knowing.*****\u201cYes? An open field battle?\u201d\u201cWe are making a line on the northwestern part of Slen region?\u201dExpected reactions.Gale smiled bitterly at the fierce reactions of the adjutants.He explained with a calm voice everything Roan had said.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly then did the adjutants let out a low exclamation and get convinced.\u201cBut even so, to face the orcs that are riding lopuses in an open field\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dA ridiculous situation.Gale pointed Roan with a gesture of his chin.\u201cFor now, I will look how Roan checks Slen region.\u201dAt those words, Kennis and the other adjutants all looked towards Roan.Roan was looking at the map spread on the table.\u2018Does he have something thought?\u2019\u2018If it\u2019s Roan, he will have a mysterious tactic.\u2019Kennis and the adjutants gulped dry saliva.Eyes filled with expectation.However, Roan couldn\u2019t hide his stuffiness while looking at the map.\u2018The map is really a mess.\u2019Compared to the map 20 years from now on, it was a child\u2019s scribble.Only the villages, mountains, forests, and rivers were marked.There were a lot of things that were excluded.Roan\u2019s finger pointed to one side of the map.A white part that didn\u2019t have anything.\u2018Slen region\u2026..\u2019His finger now moved to the northwest.The region where they would have to fight the orc troop.\u2018There\u2019s a short gorge, forest, and river\u2026\u2026..\u2019Just looking at the map, it wasn\u2019t a topography that would be of any help.\u2018Certainly, I will have to go myself.\u2019Roan turned his head and looked at Gale.\u201cTroop commander. Me and the 12th squad will depart right now.\u201dRIght before he said that, Gale nodded.\u201cRight. I already prepared the horses.\u201dThe special 20 war horses Aaron prepared.Roan saluted shortly towards Gale and the adjutants and went towards the abode of the 12th squad.\u201cSir adjutant.\u201dThe 12th squad were already ready for dispatch.Nervousness could be seen on their faces.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nervous. We are just going to check how the territory is.\u201dA soft voice.The squad members nodded unconsciously.\u201cTo shorten the time, we will go riding horses. Who hasn\u2019t rode a horse until now?\u201dAt those words Glenn and Pierce raised their hands.Even so, maybe it was because the other squad members have faced more battles, but they had experience on riding horses.Roan entrusted them to Austin and Lander, that had the most experience.\u2018From now on, to become a general that will lead a troop, they should at least learn cavalry.\u2019There were many things he had to teach them from now on.\u2018But of course, I also have to learn.\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes shone.His objective changed from great general to monarch.Now it was difficult if he simply relied on spearmanship, strategies and tactics.\u2018There isn\u2019t a subject called emperor\u2019s studies for nothing.\u2019Now that he started, he wanted to become a monarch that was like a real monarch.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018I can do it one by one. But first\u2026\u2026\u2019The danger in front of his eyes.He had to concentrate on driving back Violin\u2019s troop.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, the 12th squad replied shortly and saluted.After a while, several war horses rode down through the entrance of the troop\u2019s headquarters.Dudududu.Horse steps that shook the ground.Roan was in the front of the war horses riding quickly towards the northwest.\u2018I need to come up with a good strategy and tactic. What a problem.\u2019His hands were grabbing the reins and his legs kicked the horse without stop.But his head was spinning so fast about finding the adequate strategy and tactic from the many ones he knew, that a sound could be heard coming out of his head.Swiiiiiiish.The west wind blew scarily.*****Roan sat on the saddle and frowned.Slen region was really an empty plain, just like its name.Wherever they went, a wide and empty plain extended.\u2018Even so, the finest place is this one.\u2019The place they found after checking the region thoroughly.The short gorge, small forest and the deep river they have already checked on the map was near Midis village.\u201cThe gorge of Plam mountain is too short, and Riten\u2019s forest is also no good.\u201dAustin approached and let out a sigh.Roan slowly nodded.\u2018It\u2019s difficult to see a big effect even when we ambush them in the gorge or set the forest on fire.\u2019Most of all, if they charged through the gorge and forest, they would be able to see the empty plain.\u2018Even so, because of Slaion river that flows to the north, the size of the plain is narrower than elsewhere.\u2019Roan looked at the surrounding scenery with calm eyes.\u2018Most of all, there\u2019s a high possibility Violin\u2019s troop will pass through this region.\u2019The shortest distance from the starting point to Beno castle.\u2018I have to think of the most adequate tactic for the current situation. Is it certainly ambush? Or attacking with fire? Or if not, an inundation tactic again?\u2019Many thoughts filled his head.Then, he heard Lander\u2019s voice.\u201cSir adjutant! The youth from that time came again!\u201dLander, that was checking on the vicinity topography, appeared with a youth that had a shabby look.\u201cAh!\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation and got off the horse.\u201cMister Chris!\u201d\u201cSir adjutant.\u201dThe youth had a shabby appearance.It was Chris that had left to seize information about Violin\u2019s troop and their trajectory.Roand and Chris held hands.\u201cYou aren\u2019t hurt?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dChris smiled brightly and hit his chest.He did seem exhausted, but an expression that seemed somewhat proud.\u201cViolin\u2019s troop is somewhere located 4 days from here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite a far distance.\u201dRoan frowned.They were moving while riding lopuses.Lopuses were as fast as horses.And they were better when it came to instant changes in movements.Because of that, he expected them to arrive in two days.Chris smiled brightly and replied.\u201cFirst, their trajectory isn\u2019t really effective as they are moving while avoiding the eyes of the region\u2019s troop and residents. To top that off, they are moving in separate squads as they can\u2019t move the 2 thousand together.\u201dViolin\u2019s objective was making a surprise attack.Because of that she didn\u2019t want to face troops from another region and fight for nothing.\u2018Stupid bastards. A true surprise attack is based on swift movements.\u2019The longer their trajectory became, they would be able to evade useless fights, but there was a big chance that the most important thing, being the surprise attack, would fail.Chris\u2019s continued saying.\u201cAnd because they moved without stop, the lopuses and also the orcs are quite exhausted. They are in the middle of resting after a long while.\u201dRoan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cBecause of that, we could earn some time.\u201d\u201cThis is the records of how their troop is composed and their formation.\u201dChris lent out a small piece of paper.Roan carefully received that and asked in a low voice.\u201cBut how did you chase their tails?\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be easy to chase the tails of the orcs that were riding lopuses and gather information.At those words Chris shook his head.\u201cI didn\u2019t chase their tails. I waited in front.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dRoan asked back while opening his eyes big.Chris smiled faintly and continued saying.\u201cAt first, I checked the places they passed by and after that I registered and organized the information. After I did that, I could vaguely see their moving pattern. They were moving towards Beno castle tle while avoiding places where troops were stationed, places where people from the kingdom appeared, and also places where monster appeared.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dIt meant that he had guessed their trajectory beforehand with the basic information as the background.\u2018He\u2019s really a person I want.\u2019\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dIt meant that he had guessed the trajectory beforehand with the basic information as the background.\u2018He\u2019s really an existence I want.\u2019He gave meaningful results with limited information.Roan bit his lower lip and looked at Chris.\u201cThen what\u2019s the expected moving trajectory?\u201dAt those words Chris smiled brightly and pointed below Roan\u2019s feet.\u201cYou chose a really suitable place. They will soon come over here.\u201dA voice filled with confidenceRoan didn\u2019t ask any more.\u2018If Chris says so, it will be it.\u2019A perfect trust.\u201cThen I will have to decorate this place to become a party.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and looked towards the gorge and forest.At those words Chris put a surprised expression.\u2018Does he believe my words?\u2019There wasn\u2019t even a question if it was true or he was certain.\u2018He believes in me, in my abilities.\u2019A corner of his heart became numb with proudness.It was a really nice feeling being recognized by someone.Chris forced himself not to smile and looked at Roan.\u201cBut this isn\u2019t that good of a place to make a party.\u201dAt those words Roan smirked and shook his head.\u201cEven so, it\u2019s the best place on our surroundings.\u201dHe was certainly smiling, but his face was somewhat filled with worry.\u2018For now I will have to make them confused with an ambush or attacking with flames. The problem\u2026\u2026.\u2019Was when Violin\u2019s troop got out of the forest or gorge and entered the plains.The area was narrow because of Sleion river, but a plain was still a plain.It was the best place for lopuses to run on it.Compared to that, the military power they had was closer to something standard.\u2018The composition itself is good, but compared to the orcs our mobility falls behind.\u2019If in case Violin didn\u2019t choose to battle but to charge through, the empty Beno castle would fall in the hands of the enemies.\u2018But although it won\u2019t happen\u2026\u2026..\u2019If he stepped in and revealed his identity, it would end there.Because Violin\u2019s objective would still be revenge for her husband.\u2018Uhm. What method was there to face enemies with great mobility on an open field\u2026\u2026..\u2019The many strategies Ian and the other excellent strategies made appeared in his head.But there was no specific strategy that appeared.Then Lander, that was next to him and listening to the conversation, let out a sigh and grumbled.\u201cTch. If the orc bastards came a bit later we would be able to make a wooden fortress or an earth one.\u201dEven if it wasn\u2019t completed it would still be good.If they raised a long and strong wall on the other side of the river, even the orcs that were riding lopuses wouldn\u2019t be able to act rashly.\u201cStupid. How do we make a fortress in 4 days? If we could set up a formation, that would be fortunate on itself.\u201dAustin clicked his tongue and rebuked.Lander nodded with a sulky expression.\u201cIt was just my thought. My thought. Ahem.\u201dHe cleared his throat and looked at the clear field.\u201cWon\u2019t a cool fortress fall on the skies?\u201dWhen he was thinking about that.Roan\u2019s eyes, that was pondering, started to shine.His sight passed through Lander and looked at the plain.A peaceful scenery.\u2018It\u2019s that.\u2019A faint smile appeared on Roan\u2019s mouth.\u201cLander.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dLander felt intimidated for a second.Roan grabbed his shoulders and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s a really good thought.\u201d\u201cYes? What is?\u201dLander asked back with a confused face.Roan smiled faintly and replied.\u201cLet\u2019s raise a fortress over here.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s over here!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stick them together!\u201d\u201cIt has to look natural!\u201dThe soldiers moved between Midis village and the plains busily.Gale forced a smile and looked at the youth giving the orders between the soldiers.\u201cRight. As the strategy was set up by Roan, there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201dOn the armor the soldier with the childish face was wearing, there was a badge symbolizing a class 5 adjutant. It was Roan.Then, Roan shook off the dirt in his hands and approached.\u201cIt\u2019s time Violin\u2019s troop came.\u201dAt those words, Gale and the other adjutants nodded.\u2018We couldn\u2019t even set up a formation properly.\u2019They couldn\u2019t even set up a common wooden fence.Because they didn\u2019t have the time to do so.\u2018I wondered just what kind of bullshit it was to raise a fortress in this situation.\u2019Gale smiled bitterly.\u2018Even so, we finished the preparations according to Roan\u2019s strategy.\u2019If Violin\u2019s troop fell on their trap, he could ascertain victory.But what if the results weren\u2019t good?\u2018There\u2019s a high possibility they will attack Beno castle.\u2019Gale ground his teeth.\u2018We will certainly win.\u2019When he got a new resolution.\u201cEach troop and squads will have to move to their appointed places.\u201dRoan\u2019s calm voice.Gale nodded and looked to his right.He could see Jefferson leading BlackBird troop that was part of their corps.\u201cThen, we will be moving.\u201dHe slightly nodded and moved.Gale and the rose troop had the commanding rights for this battle.Jefferson could only move according to their strategies and commands.\u201cWe are moving! Everyone to your appointed places!\u201dAt his orders, BlackBird\u2019s adjutants quickly ordered the soldiers.\u201cWe are also moving!\u201dContinued by that, Gale let out the order.Soon the cavalry, archers, swordsmen, etc. started to move towards Riten forest and Flam mountain gorge.Rose troop and BlackBird troop.The combined number of the two troops was 2,500.They had at least 500 more than Violin.\u2018Although it isn\u2019t that we will certainly win because we have more numbers.\u2019Roan smacked his lips and looked back.Only the spearmen remained on the field.Roan raised his spear and yelled.\u201cIt won\u2019t be an easy battle! But\u2026..\u201dA loud voice.\u201cWe will win! Let\u2019s show the orc bastards the power of humans!\u201dRight after he finished saying that, the spearmen raised their spears high and stamped it on the ground.Bang!A tremble and a heavy sound was heard below their feet.The faces of the soldiers turned red.A confidence they could win and that they would certainly win showed on their faces.\u2018We will win. Certainly.\u2019Even for Roan, this battle held quite some meaning.He faced through many battles since he returned to the past. But those were all battles he had been through in his past life.Similar or the same.Even so, they were battles he certainly had experience in or knew about.But this battle was one that didn\u2019t even happen in his past life.Even Roan couldn\u2019t know how the results would turn out.\u2018I tied all the effective strategies in one place.\u2019He mixed all the best strategies according to this situation in one place.\u2018I have to win.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.It wasn\u2019t a battle he knew the future of.The first battle he would face simply with his skills.If he just attained victory on this battle, he would be able to get an incredible amount of experience and confidence.Roan\u2019s eyes shone.\u2018Come you crazy female orc warrior!His chest beat roughly.He clenched his fists tightly.\u2018I will send you next to the husband you love so much.\u2019The west wind blew again.A killing intent was felt in the warm wind.*****A blade made by polishing animal bones.The sharp and gray tip of the blade slashed through the arm.Slash.The flesh split and red blood flowed.\u201cHrm.\u201dThe owner of the arm licked the wound with the long tongue.The blood soon stopped and only a wound remained.A bloody wound.Next to that, various additional wounds could be seen.\u2018Don\u2019t forget this pain. Before getting revenge for my husband, I have to suffer and feel pain.\u2019Eyes filled with madness.Gray skin, rough and crumbly black hair, and the four canine teeth that sprouted over her mouth.She put back the knife on her waist and stood up.A body so big you wouldn\u2019t be able to say that she was a female.Adding to that, the arms and legs that sprout out of the armor were covered in muscles.A look that made you understand how the capable orc soldier Sedek gave her his crotch.Then, a heavy low voice was heard behind her.\u201cTroop commander Violin. We finished preparations to move.\u201dThe owner of the voice was Kurk who served Violin nearby.\u201cYou gave plenty of water to the lopuses, right?\u201d\u201cYes. We also gave them hog meat.\u201dAt those words Violin nodded.\u201cThere are no human troops in Slen region.\u201dMurderous intent could be felt in her voice.\u201cUntil now we moved while evading the eyes of the human bastards. But starting from now, there\u2019s no need to do so. We will charge through without stop. We will crush everything that blocks us and set it on fire. We will make an attack on Beno castle before they can finish their preparations!\u201dA blue fire appeared in her black eyes.\u201cCarve the eyes of rose troop soldiers and after you cut off their tongues rip off their limbs. And\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dViolin clenched her two fists.\u201cI will certainly take care of that bastard called Roan.\u201dAt those words Kurk bent his head.\u201cYes. I will pass it down like that!\u201dA really concentrated look.\u2018After Sedek passed away, her temperament became fiercer.\u2019If you did something wrong, you could have your head cut off in that instant.After a while, Violin\u2019s troop finished preparations and charged towards Beno castle.Kaang! Kaang!The cries of the lopuses hit the skies and the earth.But Violin\u2019s troop that ran without stop, could only stop at the entrance of Slen region.\u201cHuh?\u201dViolin, that was leading the troop in the front, frowned. An unexpected scenery spread before her eyes.\u2018Human?\u2019Starting from Flam mountain\u2019s border and the spread Riten forest.In the entrance of Riten forest, human soldiers were moving hurriedly.\u2018There are human soldiers here?\u2019An unexpected situation.Violin called Kurk with a gesture of her hands.\u201cIt seems like our movements got leaked.\u201d\u201cEven so, there are only tens of them.\u201dKurk glared at Riten forest with fierce eyes.\u201cJust in case, take some guys and go over there.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dKurk hurriedly replied and took 500 orc soldiers and went towards Riten forest.Until then the human soldiers seemed not to have noticed Violin\u2019s troop, but they were still moving logs here and there.Dudududu.As the lopuses charged roughly, the ground trembled.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dThe soldiers looked at the direction the sound was heard while still lifting the logs.And then, their eyes got big.\u201cHuk! Damn! The bastards are already here!\u201d\u201cFlee!\u201d\u201cFlee!\u201dThey got scared and started to run towards the forest while throwing the logs.A look of fearing for their lives.\u201cHmph! Cowards!\u201dKurk looked at that and gripped the reins strongly.He was planning to get in there in an instant and crush their heads.Then, the lopus that Kurk was riding, started to shake its head to the sides roughly and let out a cry.Kuaang! Kuaang!Unpleasant movements and cries.Kurk immediately pulled the reins and stopped the lopus.The 500 orcs that were following from behind also lowered the speed and stood next to kukr.Kng! Kng! Kng!The lopuses all started to smell the ground at the same time as if they had agreed to beforehand.Kurk frowned and made hand signs.\u201cSomething\u2019s not right. Check the logs the humans threw.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSome young orcs replied loudly and ran towards a log.Crash.As they crushed the log with a hand axe, a sickening smell was felt.They frowned and yelled towards Kurk.\u201cThe thing inside the log is oil!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not only on the logs, but there is also a lot on the ground and on the grass!\u201dThe orcs pulled out some grass with their hands.Sticky oil got on their hands.\u2018Nasty human bastards. So they wanted to attack with fire.\u2019Bloodlust appeared in Kurk\u2019s eyes.Meanwhile, Violin arrived while leading the main troop.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAt the short question, Kurk smiled coldly and replied.\u201cIt seems like information got into the hands of the human bastards. They were spreading oil in Riten forest.\u201d\u201cOil?\u201dViolin frowned and looked towards Riten forest.Kurk continued saying.\u201cBut it seems that our speed was faster than what they had thought. They couldn\u2019t finish spreading all the oil and they fled. Hahaha!\u201dA magnanimous laughter.He really seemed like he was having fun.\u2018Looking that the human bastards are trembling I really feel good.\u2019In the other hand, Violin that was known to be hot tempered was rather calm.\u201cIf they couldn\u2019t even finish this they wouldn\u2019t have been able to set up a formation.\u201dKurk slowly nodded.Violin opened her eyes sharply and said.\u201cWe are quickly moving towards Beno castle before the human bastards finish their preparations.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood.\u201dKurk replied in a loud voice and shook his hand towards the orcs.The orcs that were stopped momentarily started to move towards Riten forest.Then, Violin\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWait!\u201dAt that instant, the orcs all stopped moving.Violin glared at Riten forest that was silent and didn\u2019t seem like it had any humans in it.\u2018We have never encountered a human army until now. But\u2026\u2026..\u2019Soldiers appeared on Slen region that originally didn\u2019t have a human troop.\u2018What if they escaping to the forest was a well made act?\u2019There may be some traps on Riten forest.\u2018But it\u2019s true that they still haven\u2019t finished their preparations.\u2019Violin touched her canine tooth and shook her head.There was no need to lower their speed while investigating the forest.She had another choice.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Flam mountain gorge instead of Riten forest.\u201d\u201cYes? The human bastards haven\u2019t even finished spreading oil.\u201dKurk shook his head as if he was complaining.But Violin wasn\u2019t planning on changing her thoughts.\u201cYou don\u2019t know about that. That could have been a trap by itself. Even so, there\u2019s no need to take chances for nothing. We are going to Flam mountain gorge.\u201d\u201cA gorge is a really good place for enemies to hide in ambush.\u201dKurk said with a worried face.But this time also Violin shook her head.\u201cAs the length of the gorge is short, even if they are lying in ambush it isn\u2019t that big of a problem. We will pass through it quickly.\u201dShe raised her large blade to the sky.\u201cLet\u2019s go! Our objective is Beno castle!\u201d\u201cWaaaaaaa!\u201dThe orcs all yelled in one voice and pulled the reins.The heads of the lopuses that was looking at Riten forest turned to Flam mountain gorge.Dudududu.A sound shaking the ground.Violin\u2019s troop only left a dust cloud and disappeared in an instant.Swish.Then, the grass of Riten forest shaked and the soldiers that threw away the wooden logs appeared from it.The guys that were pale and screaming even a while ago.But now they were putting a faint smile.\u201cUntil now, is everything going according to our plans?\u201dAt the words of one soldier, another one nodded.\u201cYes, until now everything is going according to what adjutant Roan said.\u201dAt those words the soldiers all had amazed expressions.\u2018He\u2019s really an incredible person.\u2019\u2018To lead the more than 2000 orc troop with only tens of people to where he wants.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s not someone that would end simply as a spearman.\u2019A surprise look could be seen on them.Then, one soldier clapped his hands.Clap!\u201cNow! There\u2019s no time to be idling like this. Let\u2019s pass to the next thing quickly!\u201d\u201cRight! Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d\u201cHurry up!\u201dThe soldiers nodded and started to move busily.Roan\u2019s plan still didn\u2019t end.No, precisely speaking now was only the start.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Roooooooooll!A sharp sound and the sound of rocks rolling was heard.\u201cDamn!\u201dViolin, that was charging roughly at the front, looked at the falling arrows and rocks and cursed.\u2018They were preparing to attack with fire in the forest and they prepared for an ambush here?\u2019Then it meant that they had been quite prepared for it.\u2018At the slightest slip it gets more difficult.\u2019They may need to make a big battle in Slen region while not being able to get to Beno castle.\u2018Damn!\u2019Curses followed.\u2018Just what troop are you! What are your identities!\u2019Her eyes got red.Her hot temperament slowly showed itself.\u201cKukh!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThen, the cries of the orcs were heard.\u2018Kugh. It\u2019s not the time to be here!\u2019Fortunately, her boiling temperament calmed down.\u201cCharge! Charge while only looking at the front!\u201dViolin yelled towards the orc warriors with all her strength.The distance of Flam mountain gorge was short.If they charged in even a bit faster they would be able to get out of it.Kung! Puk!\u201cKrr!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe orcs that fell behind the troop got hit by the rocks and the arrows and fell.But certainly, even if the gorge was short, it was too short.Among the 2000 orcs, only 200 lost their lives in the ambush.The others got into the plains safely.\u201cWhew.\u201dJefferson looked at the orcs getting out of the gorge and let out a long sigh.At first glance, it seemed like he hadn\u2019t fulfilled his role well.But on his face, a satisfying smile could be seen.\u201cHe really got it right.\u201dWhen he first heard of this strategy, Roan had clearly said.Not that good of words in the position of the troop commander and the soldiers.\u2018Soldiers want to accumulate merits.\u2019Then Roan smiled brightly and said.Then, the words that followed made him hit his knee.\u2018Then, shall we quickly go down?\u2019Jefferson made a hand sign towards the flag man and sent down the order.\u201cDescend! We are going down the mountain path!\u201dStrength could be felt in his voice.\u201cWe will block their road to escape!\u201dThe battle hadn\u2019t even started, but to talk about escaping.A weird order was sent.\u201cWaaaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cQuickly, move quickly!\u201dBut no one had their doubts.The soldiers got down into the gorge quickly and started to sever the mountain path.*****Dududududu.Violin\u2019s troop rode quickly towards the entrance of the gorge.In that moment, a wide plain was seen in front of their eyes.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dViolin pulled the reins along a low exclamation.Her expression stiffened..Her eyes that were filled with bloodlust lost their trajectory.\u2018Just what is\u2026..\u2019She couldn\u2019t believe the scenery in front of her eyes.Violin and all the other orcs stopped.Everyone had perplexed looks.\u201cThi, this looks just like a fortress.\u201dKurk approached and frowned.Violin nodded without saying anything and glared at the front.There were wagons, that had night soil buckets, lined up on the plains.The wagons and the buckets were ordinary ones you could see anywhere.But looking at the hundreds of wagons lined up as if it was surrounding the entrance, the intimidation it gave was incredible.On top of that, the wagons were linked with ropes so you couldn\u2019t try to force your way.\u2018In this situation, we won\u2019t be able to fully use our movement.\u2019They needed space for the lopuses to run however they wanted.\u2018In the end it means that we have to charge through one place\u2026..\u2019Charging through the north was meaningless as they would face Sleion river later.In the end they had to choose between the east and the south.Violin\u2019s eyes moved quickly.\u2018To the south? Or to the east?\u2019The pondering deepened.Then, a heavy sound hit their ears.Boom.At the same time, the many wagons started to move their direction along with the sound of wood tangling.Drrrrrr. Click! Drrrrrr. Click!The wagons started to line up towards one direction.Boom.Once more time, they felt a heavy shock.This time, the wagons started to slowly move.Drrrrrrrrrr.Sound of wheels spinning.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe, the castle is moving.\u201dThe orcs looked at the wagons closing on them with a perplexed expression.\u2018They weren\u2019t just standing still?\u2019Violin was also hugely surprised.Meanwhile, the wagons that were at quite some distance closed the distance.Bang!The wagons took positions along with a heavy sound.Pat!At the same time, the long spears that were inside the buckets and below the wagons showed themselves.The sharp tips of the spears pointed towards the orcs.A moving wagon fortress and the spears that were like spikes.\u201cTroo, troop commander Violin.\u201dKurk gulped down his dry saliva and called out to Violin.But she didn\u2019t reply.She just glared at the wagon fortress with fierce eyes.Then, an orc that was at the rear yelled.\u201cThe gorge is blocked! Humans are approaching from the gorge!\u201dAt that voice, some orcs assented.But Violin didn\u2019t show any reactions.\u2018They should be the ones that ambushed us.\u2019She took in a deep breath.\u2018Damn. To think about making a fortress with wagons and buckets.\u2019She wanted to see the bastard that thought of this at least once.\u2018Although the situation is difficult\u2026\u2026\u2019But in this situation they couldn\u2019t keep idling.If they delayed any longer they would suffer a pincer attack.\u2018We will charge through.\u2019Although they would take some losses, the priority was to charge through and go to Beno castle.Then, one man showed himself over a wagon.He had a childish face but he was a youth that had a rank 5 adjutant badge on his chest.It was Roan.Violin frowned.\u201cSo you are the commander?\u201dRoan just smiled faintly instead of replying.\u2018It should have been perplexing.\u2019They used wagons and buckets to limit their movements, no, made a fortress.There was no strategy like this until now.\u2018A strategy that would be used by a rebel of Estia empire 5 years from now on.\u2019But of course it wasn\u2019t exactly the same.The rebel army used broken carriages instead of wagons and buckets.On top of that there was a big difference in the strategy Roan used.And that was that Roan\u2019s fortress could move.\u2018Lander\u2019s words became the decisive help.\u2019That it would be good if a fortress fell from the skies.Then, the various wagons and buckets that were on the plains came into his view.\u2018This place is narrow because of Sleion river. On top of that, the yielding of the crops is really good so there are plenty of wagons and buckets provided per village. A good condition to make a fortress with wagons as a blockade.A strategy that fit perfectly with the surrounding topography.\u2018Until now, everything happened as planned. Then, let\u2019s also work hard together. Violin.\u2019Roan smiled faintly and pointed at Violin with his spear.\u201cI\u2019m the class 5 adjutant from Rose troop that belongs to the 7th corps of Rinse kingdom.\u201dViolin frowned.\u2018Roan?! If it\u2019s Roan!\u2019Roan read Violin\u2019s thoughts.\u201cRight. I\u2019m the one that slew Sedek.\u201dBoom.Violin\u2019s face instantly stiffened.At the same time, her gray skin started to turn red.Rage.Her two eyes became filled with amazing madness.Srung.She pulled out her wide blade.\u201cI finally meet you.\u201dA voice that was filled with bloodlust.\u201cI won\u2019t have to go to Beno castle.\u201dEven her eyes turned red.\u201cI will skin you and chop you into thin slices. I will make you beg me to kill you.\u201dViolin ground her teeth.A look that she would attack if he replied.Even so, Roan\u2019s expression was relaxed.\u201cYou should have really loved your husband.\u201dHis voice was composed.\u201cIf you want it, I will send you next to your husband.\u201dRoan tilted his finger.\u201cCome.\u201dA short provocation.\u201cI, I will kill you!\u201dViolin couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and exploded in rage.She kicked the lopus and ran towards Roan.\u201cUh? Huh! E, everybody follow troop commander\u2019s back!\u201dKurk was surprised but pulled the reins after he sent the order.\u201cTroop commander! Troop commander Violin! You can\u2019t get agitated!\u201dHe followed Violin\u2019s back closely and yelled.The other orcs also kicked the lopuses and moved quickly.Roan kept standing on top of a wagon with a composed expression.The orcs that were close to 2000 came charging with a ferocious intent and their formation wasn\u2019t messed up at all.\u201cI will chew you down!\u201dViolin that came charging with a ferocious intent.\u201cGuard the Troop commander!\u201d\u201cCharge! Charge!\u201dThe orcs that followed her back.The orcs lowered their bodies and grabbed the reins to catch up with Violin.Then, Violin who was in front, stopped in front of the wagon fortress.\u201cBastard!\u201dViolin shouted towards Roan that was as close as her reach.The lopus seemed to know how its owner was feeling, and it charged through with strength.At that moment!Psk.Its front legs got buried on the ground.Kaang!A cry as if it was perplexed.Kung!The lopus hit its head on the ground and fell forward.Udkkk.It was the sound of its neck breaking.It was an instant death.Violin, who was riding it, also bounced to the front.\u2018Kgh!\u2019She twisted her body and tried to balance herself.Boom!Violin rolled on the ground with a heavy sound.Continued by that, the orcs that followed her back also fell on the same trap.Boom. Booboom!\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cHuk!\u201dOnly after hundreds of orcs fell, Violin stopped the charge.\u201cUhhhhhhhh.\u201dViolin stood up with a cry that seemed to be that of an animal.She grabbed the blade that was rolling on the ground and started to move again.Her objective was Roan.Violin had already lost her nature because of the rage.\u201cUaaaaaa!\u201dShe let out a yell.Tat!She charged to the front and went towards the wagon.\u201cWhere do you!\u201d\u201cGet the head of the orc leader!\u201dThe soldiers stabbed with their spear with all their strength.Spat!The spear passed next to her.\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt!\u201dViolin swung her blade while having the spear in her armpit.Slash!The strong spear got sliced off in an instant.\u201cHuuk!\u201d\u201cHup!\u201dThe spearmen gulped in air and became afraid.However Violin wasn\u2019t interested in them at all.She continued charging towards Roan.\u201cI will face you!\u201dThen, Pierce appeared while saying it with strength.Spat!The spear that moves strangely and cuts the air quickly.Pierce was different from normal spearmen even with the movements.Stab.The spear danced and slashed Violin\u2019s body in a big way.The corner of Pierce\u2019s mouth slowly raised up.\u2018How is it? This is sir adjutant Rian\u2019s spearma\u2026..\u2019His face instantly turned stiff.\u201cKuuuuuu.\u201dViolin gave away her body and snatched Pierce\u2019s spear.\u201cKuk!\u201dPierce pulled the spear with all of his strength but it didn\u2019t even flinch.\u2018Impossible! How is she this\u2026\u2026..\u2019His talent was certainly outstanding, but he still lacked experience.As another situation happened contrary to what he was expecting, he lost his calm.\u201cI\u2019m sure I told you not to interfere.\u201dViolin smiled ill naturedly and raised her blade.\u201cHuh!\u201dPierce was perplexed and his body froze.Slash!At the same time, the wide blade cut through the air.\u2018Ugh!\u2019Pierce ground his teeth as he thought that he would die like this.Then!A strong spear appeared and hit the side of the wide blade.Clang!A clear sound of metal.\u201cKuk!\u201dViolin\u2019s arm and blade bounced off.Meanwhile Pierce was blinking with a surprised look.The owner of the spear showed himself.\u201cPierce. You rest in the back.\u201dIt was Roan.He had a really faint smile on his face.\u201cThis crazy orc is my guest.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My physical abilities can\u2019t follow my sight at all.\u2019In his thoughts, he wanted to lightly dodge the blade that was so slow it made him yawn and after he closed in on her he would punch her five times and then slice her head off.But his hands and feet couldn\u2019t follow his will.Spat!The tip of the blade closely passed by his chest.\u201cHmph!\u201dRoan snorted and swung his spear.The spear drew a line and went towards Violin\u2019s top of the head.Cheng!Violin pulled the blade without much difficulty and after she blocked it she closed in on Roan.As she was also an experienced warrior, she knew how she had to face a spearman.But unfortunately, Roan was much more of an experienced soldier than Violin.Roan spun the spear to block at the stabbing blade and then twisted his wrist.Pabat!The long spear spun like a windmill between Roan and Violin.Checheng!The blade that was trapped on the spear flew off.Roan turned his shoulders and stood slanted.The spear that was spinning like a windmill and drawing a beautiful arc went in to cut off Violin\u2019s neck.\u201cKugh!\u201dViolin ground her teeth and dodged the spear by lowering her head.\u2018I have to counter\u2026\u2026\u2019She wanted to at least stab him in the chest.But she couldn\u2019t even try it.On the place where the blade of the spear passed by, the end of the spear took place.\u201cDamn!\u201dViolin cursed and lowered her head once again.Spat!The end of the spear that passed by closely.Violin thought that this was the opportunity.Because Roan cut off the air twice.Even at first glance, Roan\u2019s upper body was unguarded.Swung!The blade cut through the air and was accompanied by a heavy sound.Just like they say, right before his head got smashed.The spear that passed next to her soon returned and blocked the blade.Tung!A heavy shock.\u201cIkk!\u201dViolin put more strength while grinding her teeth.Kigigi.The blade passed through the spear along a displeasing sound.\u2018Just how is she this strong\u2026\u2026\u2019In this situation, even Roan couldn\u2019t help but get perplexed.Violin showed a more powerful strength than what he had thought about.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the spear Corps Commander Aaron gave me, it would have split in two.\u2019It was a strength that amazing.Even so, it wasn\u2019t the time to feel leisure.Because even right now Violin was eating up the spear with her blade.Roan pulled his right leg back and twisted his body and the spear lightly.Kigigigi.The blade that was gearing with the spear slipped off and fell to the ground.\u201cKugh.\u201dViolin\u2019s body fell to the front as she lost balance.Roan turned around while having his body tilted and hit the back of Violin\u2019s head with his spear.Puk!\u201cUgh!\u201dViolin fell to the ground along with a heavy shock.Roan pointed his spear to her back and tried to stab her.\u2018Where do you dare!\u2019Violin quickly rolled on the floor and went in to cut off Roan\u2019s talon.Roan didn\u2019t get perplexed and jumped while stabbing the spear on the ground.At the same time he was falling down, he kicked Violin\u2019s side.\u201cHmph!\u201dAs it was an attack Violin also expected, she lightly rolled her body and dodged.She stood up from the place and swung the blade fiercely.Roan didn\u2019t fall back either and went in to stab his spear.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The spear and the blade clashed and metal clashing was heard.Violin certainly overwhelmed Roan in strength and stamina.However Roan was so quick to the point it was difficult to believe and showed a good sense.On top of that, his skills in handling the spear was also impressive.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The clash of the two people continued without knowing the end.Meanwhile, around the wagon fortress, quite an ordinary battle was happening.As the lopuses and orcs fell in the trap and got stuck on the ground, the soldiers that were hiding behind the wagons showed themselves while holding their spears.\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill them before they get up!\u201dTens of spears moved while cutting through the air.\u201cKugh.\u201d\u201cDamn. Just what is\u2026\u2026\u201dThe orcs hurriedly brought their hands to their waists.But the movements of the soldiers was faster than theirs.Slash. Stab.The sharp blade pierced the orcs\u2019 bodies.\u201cKugh.\u201d\u201cKek!\u201d\u201cDa, dam\u2026\u2026\u201dTheir last words they couldn\u2019t even finish.Kurk, that was checking on the situation, yelled with all his strength.\u201cAttack! Everybody attack! Rescue your allies!\u201dAt that order, some orcs that had stopped in front of the trap, grabbed the reins of the lopuses.Koong! Koong!The lopuses jumped over the traps along a cry and started to run towards the soldiers.The orcs swung their blades with a bloody intent and yelled.\u201cHuman bastards! Receive the blade of an orc warrior!\u201d\u201cNasty bastards! I will show you what a soldier is!\u201dAn atmosphere that a rough collision would happen anytime.Then, the soldiers that were killing off the orcs on the ground turned back and started to pass the fortresses.A perfect retreat that happened on an instant.The soldiers hid their bodies again behind the wagons and stuck out their spears.The orcs that were charging through became just like a dog chasing a chicken that ended up looking at a roof.\u201cThi, thi, these bastards\u2026\u2026.\u201dKurk\u2019s face became red.He also had a hot tempered side in him, probably because he also served that kind of troop commander.\u201cAttack! Attack! Kill the human bastards! Push over the buckets and break the wagons!\u201dAn order sent down stubbornly.Violin was driven by insanity and was clashing with Roan.The orcs could only follow Kurk\u2019s order.\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201dAn ignorant charge towards the fortresses begun.When they got near the wagons.\u201cBring them down!\u201dThe yells of the adjutants and squad commanders shook the battlefield.The soldiers that were hiding themselves got up in an instant and pushed the buckets.The buckets shook for a moment and started to fall.Boom! Boom!A heavy sound.The bucket fell towards the orcs that were running towards the wagon fortress.\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe orcs couldn\u2019t dodge and got squashed by the buckets.\u201cDodge it!\u201d\u201cStop! Stop!\u201dBut the majority of the orcs succeeded in grabbing the reins and stopping the lopuses.\u2018What is it? Why are they breaking the fortress with their own hands?\u2019\u2018What are you planning now?\u2019The orcs looked at the buckets with uneasiness.Then a loud yell was heard.\u201cRoll it!\u201d\u201cRoll!\u201dAt the same time, a long and huge cylinder shaped bucket started to roll with a heavy sound.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cUh, uh!\u201dThe orcs pulled the reins with a surprised expression.The lopuses started to slowly walk back.Crush.As the bucket was one huge cylinder, it passed the digged ground and traps without trouble.Perhaps, if they moved it along the wagon, the wheels would have fallen in the traps.The speed the bucket\u2019s roll started to increase.The soldiers started to push the bucket with more strength and in unison.\u201cDa, damn! Block it! We also have to stick together and stop it!\u201dKurk swung his blade and yelled.If they just let it be, they would really end up inside their trap.\u2018Damn!\u2019\u2018Can\u2019t do anything about it!\u2019The orcs also knew very well about this truth.They couldn\u2019t do anything about it, and got down the lopuses and started to stick on a side of the bucket.At that moment!Spat! Pabat!Behind the buckets, tens of long spears surged up.That was different from a normal spear.The length of it was almost twice of it.\u2018Bastards, this is a real long spear!\u2019\u2018It\u2019s the provisional long spear adjutant Roan thought of!\u2019These were all pieces of work made by Roan that he made one by one.The soldiers stabbed the long spear between the spaces of the buckets.As the length of the bucket was quite big, if it was an ordinary spear it wouldn\u2019t have reached the orcs.However, with the spear Roan made, it was enough to attack the orcs that closed up on the bucket.Stab. Slash.The sharp blade of the spear pierced the bodies of the orcs.\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cKugh.\u201dThe orcs, that were trying their hardest to stop the rolling buckets, fell at the spears that appeared out of nowhere.Because of that, the morale of the soldiers raised even more.\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t leave even one of them!\u201dThe long spears cut the air along a loud yell.At the same time, the buckets rolled without stop and closed in on the space of the orcs.Stab. Crush.\u201cGrr.\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201dThe orcs were stabbed by the spear or got crushed on the buckets and started to fall back little by little.\u2018Damn. This became difficult.\u2019Only now did Kurk get ahold of himself.The rage that made his head messy, calmed down in an instant.\u2018Like this we will get annihilated! Annihilated!\u2019It was a situation where they may really go to hell to meet with Sedek.The number of the orcs that were close to 2000 lowered to 1000 at the attack of the fortress and the buckets.\u2018For now, we have to survive.Only if we do would we be able to take revenge or do something!\u2019Kurk quickly checked his surroundings.\u2018The east, south and north are blocked by that damned wagon fortress and buckets.\u2019In addition, even if they charged through the east or south, they would get even deeper to enemy territory.In the end, what was left was Flam mountain gorge and Riten forest.But even this wasn\u2019t an easy situation.\u2018The human bastards are blocking the gorge and the entrance for Riten forest\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Riten forest was placed slightly more north than Flam mountain gorge.Because of that, the wagon fortress that was blocking the entrance was at the back of it.Kurk\u2019s sight goes to the north.\u2018If we flee towards the gorge where humans set up defenses, that\u2019s no different to suicide. In the end what\u2019s left is going to Riten forest.\u2019There was the fortress and the buckets, but the feeling the fortress of the east was different.A somewhat sloppy feeling.Even the speed that the buckets come rolling seemed slower.\u2018We will charge through the fortress in the north and we retreat through Riten forest.\u2019In an instant a plan was made.Kurk looked at Violin.She was still battling Roan.It didn\u2019t look like she was being pushed back even while dodging the buckets.\u2018If I tell her to retreat, she will make a scandal.\u2019But he wasn\u2019t in a leisure situation where he could receive her tantrum.\u2018Can\u2019t do anything about it. Even if I get punished later on, surviving comes first.\u2019Kurk got on the lopus and raised his right hand.\u201cAdvance party to the front!\u201dAt those words, the biggest and boldest ones got to the front.Kurk revealed his plans in detail.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cGrr!\u201dMeanwhile, the orcs fell one by one as they couldn\u2019t hold back the charging of the buckets.Kurk\u2019s face became urgent.\u201cYou all understood?\u201d\u201cYes! Understood.\u201dThe advance party all nodded and ground their teeth.They rode their lopuses and started to ride in a high speed.Their objective was Roan and Violin.\u201cHuh?! Sir adjutant is in danger!\u201d\u201cThe orc bastards are coming!\u201dThe soldiers that were pushing the bucket yelled with an urgent expression.Austin, Pierce and the 12th squad members raised their spears and ran towards Roan.However they couldn\u2019t beat the lopuses that had better mobility.They reached in front of Violin and Roan in an instant.Half of the orcs attacked Roan and the other half assaulted Violin.\u201cTch!\u201dRoan, that was pressing Violin fiercely, bit his lower lip at the sudden attack.In the other side, Violin yelled towards the orcs that were grabbing Violin\u2019s arms and legs.\u201cLet go! Let me go!\u201dBut the orcs didn\u2019t react at the orders.They tied down Violin with a rope they had prepared.Kurk, who arrived late, carried her on his lopus.\u201cPardon my negligence.\u201d\u201cKurk! Let this go! Let me go! I have to kill that bastard!\u201dHer eyes and voice were filled with madness.Violin struggled to break free of Kurk.Kurk didn\u2019t mind her and pulled the reins and went towards the north.\u201cTroop commander. Like this we will get annihilated. Annihilated. Don\u2019t we have to be alive to at least be able to take revenge?\u201d\u201cShut up! Untie this, this instant!\u201dViolin didn\u2019t even want to listen to Kurk.But Kurk was also that way.He didn\u2019t react at Violin\u2019s words at all.Rather, he yelled towards the orcs in a loud voice.\u201cRetreat! Retreat! Advance troop, open a path!\u201dRight before he sent down the order, the orcs that were tying down Roan fell back as fast as a current of water.They crossed the plains and rode towards the north that was blocked by the wagon fortress.A well ordered look.Kurk continued to yell.\u201cFollow the advance troop! Follow them!\u201d\u201cWaaa! Pierce through!\u201d\u201cOpen a path to flee!\u201dThe orcs yelled and kicked the lopuses.They also realized that this was the last opportunity for them to survive.Bang!The wagon fortress on the north clashed hardly against the orcs.At first, the fortress seemed to defend well and protect the place.But as the thousand or more orcs kept pushing in, it started to get pushed back little by little.\u201cDamn! Fall back!\u201d\u201cRegroup with your allies on the sides!\u201d\u201cFall back!\u201dIn the end, a retreating order came out of the mouths of the soldiers.And Kurk didn\u2019t miss that chance.He led the advance party and the orc warriors and looked for the blind parts of the fortress.In the end.Bang!The wagon fortress fell.The line that got pierced through.Kurk and the warriors kicked the lopuses with expressions filled with cheer.They wanted to get out of this hell like plain as fast as possible.Dudududu.Violin\u2019s troop entered Riten forest along the steps shaking the ground.Silence fell on the plains in an instant.To the point you wouldn\u2019t be able to believe that a fierce battle happened here.\u201cWhew!\u201dThe soldiers let out a long breath.A somewhat relieved expression.It wasn\u2019t an expression someone that could annihilate their enemy should have.Then, Roan got on a wagon and looked at the orcs entering Riten forest.A faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cFlee\u2026..I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s too late.\u201dA firm voice.\u201cYou already fell in my trap.\u201dThe real trap wasn\u2019t on the gorge nor on the plains, it was in the forest.Roan raised his spear highly and yelled.\u201cBlock Riten forest with the wagons and buckets!\u201dThe soldiers all looked at Roan.They knew.That everything that happened until now was happening according to Roan\u2019s plans and guesses.Respect and fear appeared in their eyes.Roan pretended not to notice that and continued saying.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming time to finish this battle!\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right now!\u201dViolin continued to yell while struggling.Kurk didn\u2019t react at all as if he had become deaf.\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019He let out a sigh and looked backwards.\u2018They really are chasing us.\u2019The spearmen were chasing them while yelling.\u2018Even so it\u2019s impossible to catch up to us who are riding lopuses.\u2019Different than the horses, the lopuses didn\u2019t lose that much mobility in the forest.\u2018Now that I look, I can\u2019t see the enemy\u2019s cavalry?\u2019It was a weird thing.\u2018Are they maybe ambushing us in the forest?\u2019But in the end he shook his head.If it was a normal commander, he wouldn\u2019t do such things as hiding the cavalry to launch an ambush.\u2018The important thing right now isn\u2019t that.\u2019Kurk threw away the complicated thoughts in his head.\u2018Sons of bitches. I will certainly pay you back for today.\u2019He ground his teeth and kicked the lopus.He could see the exit of Riten forest from far away.The white light between the trees seemed like the door to heaven.A faint smile appeared on his face.\u2018If we just get out the\u2026\u2026.\u2019Then, Kurk\u2019s face stiffened.Because an amazing path of fire surged from the entrance of the forest.\u2018Flames?!\u2019Kurk looked at his surroundings with a really nervous expression.Fortunately, there were no more places that were set on fire.\u2018Damn. So they are blocking our escape route?\u2019They lacked oil to set the entire forest on fire.But even so, it wasn\u2019t that the fire stayed still.It was obvious that the fire would spread to the insides of the forest through the west wind.\u201cSir adjutant Kurk!\u201dAll the orcs stopped and looked at Kurk.Kurk\u2019s eyes rolled quickly.\u2018We charge through like this? No. Charging through the path of fire is impossible.\u2019The flames were burning fiercely with the help of the wind.\u2018The south is blocked with the gorge, and the humans are attacking us from the east. The place that\u2019s left is\u2026\u2026.\u2019His sight goes to the north.Sleion river.\u2018Although the riverside is a bit narrow\u2026\u2026.\u2019Even so, it wasn\u2019t so narrow for them to not be able to move.\u2018We follow the riverside and retreat to the west.\u2019It was a much safer route than charging through the flames.Kurk pointed to the north.\u201cWe will follow Sleion river and retreat to the west!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dThe orcs replied in one voice and pulled the reins.The lopuses turned to head towards the north and started to run.Kurk looked at the red flames and clicked his tongue.\u2018We completely fell. We completely fell by the hands of the human bastards.\u2019He ground his teeth.\u2018Everything hadwould have been a plan and strategy since we discovered the humans in the entrance of Riten forest.\u2019They just reacted and moved towards the places the humans wanted them to go into their trap.\u2018Damn.\u2019Anger surged up.\u2018I will certainly pay you back for what happened today.\u2019Kurk ground his teeth and glared his front.It was difficult to see clearly because of the white smoke.\u2018Anyways, it doesn\u2019t seem like they are setting the forest on fire any more.\u2019It seemed like the humans couldn\u2019t plan up to this point.Then, the orcs that were in the front got out of the forest and arrived at the narrow riverside.Flash!The smoke disappeared and a beautiful scene was spread outspread.The golden side and the flashing blue river.The green plains that extends beyond Sleion river.Everything was beautiful.Except for one thing.\u2018Thi, this\u2026\u2026.\u2019Expressions as if they couldn\u2019t believe this at all.\u201cHow can this be!\u201dKurk couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and yelled.He looked at the front and the rear alternating with a stiffened face.The human cavalry were taking place on the west and the east with Violin\u2019s troop at the center.\u2018Damn! Just how far are you seeing things through!\u2019Kurk was curious as to what the man that set up this perfect trap looked like.He didn\u2019t know that Roan was responsible for this strategy.Meanwhile Gale, who was leading the cavalry, glared at the orcs and put on an ill smile.\u2018Everything is like Roan\u2019s plans.\u2019In the first place, Roan thought up a strategy to massacre the orcs that got out of the forest by using flames with the wagon fortress.But there were two big problems in the flame strategy.The first one was that they really lacked oil.The second was that the west wind continued to blow without stop.In the end, Roan had to pluck and fix the strategy to make it perfect.\u2018I send Violin\u2019s troop to the gorge by showing them soldiers spreading oil on purpose. After that, we push them to Riten forest with wagon fortresses.\u2019Because of that, Violin\u2019s troop get to enter Riten forest with a west direction and face the opposite blowing wind.\u2018Even if I don\u2019t have that much oil, the fire can cover the orcs with the help of the wind.\u2019Actually, the orc troop didn\u2019t have any choice.a right for choices.The place that they could run off to escape the fire was only to the north, where the Sleion river was located.When the orc troop gets tired by the continuous attacks, they attack them with the cavalry they hid until now. they would attack them with the cavalry they\u2019ve hidden until now.This was Roan\u2019s ultimate strategy.And for this, Roan sent the order to Gale and the cavalry to wait on Sleion\u2019s riverside.\u2018He certainly said that they would flee towards here.\u2019And those words became true.Gale looked at the orcs with fixed eyes.\u2018It\u2019s became time to end the battle.\u2019He raised his right hand highly.\u201cAttack!\u201dA loud yell.\u201cWaaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let even one of them escape!\u201dThe cavalrymen started to charge forward with a fierce intent along with the yell that shook the earth.\u201cKuk! Damn it!\u201dKurk ground his teeth.He had nowhere else to escape to.The fire was being eaten by the flames, and in front of their eyes the Sleion river was flowing calmly.On top of that, the lopuses were also tired.\u201cDamn!\u201dHe cursed out and cut off the rope that tied up Violin.\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dViolin frowned at Kurk\u2019s words.Kurk gave her his lopus and yelled.\u201cWe are going to die here. If it\u2019s already been decided\u2026\u2026\u201dHis eyes got filled with madness.\u201cTake revenge for Sir Sedek.\u201dAt those words Violin bit her lower lip with strength.Kurk yelled once more.\u201cGo! We will block them here!\u201dViolin looked at Kurk\u2019s two eyes fixedly.And then, she hardly gripped the reins and nodded.\u201cLet\u2019s meet in hell.\u201dAt those words Kurk burst out in laughter.\u201cI will be waiting for you first.\u201dA farewell.Violin quickly kicked the lopus.Her eyes were already tainted with madness.Now, there was no need to hold onto the rope of sanity.Kuong!The lopus let out a cry and started to run towards the forest.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dGale and the cavalrymen looked at her with surprised looks.\u201cCatch her!\u201d\u201cGet her!\u201dAt Gale\u2019s and the adjutants orders, the soldiers grabbed the reins.Then, Kurk and the other orcs blocked their front.\u201cWe can\u2019t send you!\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to go!\u201dThey were already determined to die.In the end, the cavalry ended up losing Violin.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe yells of the orcs that were on the side were heard continuously.Kurk looked at the spears flying towards him and then closed his eyes.\u2018A warrior thinks that dying in the battlefield is glorious.\u2019Stab.\u201cKuk.\u201dA sharp spear stabbed in his chest.Gale looked at Riten forest and let out a sigh.\u2018Did we miss the most important troop commander?\u2019Looking at the situation, it seemed like she went to find Roan.\u2018In the end, it seems like Roan has to end this battle.\u2019This battle was really a battle based on Roan.Gale\u2019s sight followed Violin\u2019s back who couldn\u2019t even be seen.\u2018Nothing has to happen.\u2019Riten forest was filled with white smoke because of the fire.A situation where it was difficult to look in front.\u2018I don\u2019t know why but it feels comfortable.\u2019He tasted bitterness in his mouth.An uneasy feeling flowed back his spine.*****\u2018This much is enough.\u2019Roan looked at the forest that was half gulped down by the flames in an instant and let out a long sigh.The orcs fled to the riverside just like he had thought.\u2018They would get massacred in the ambush.\u2019If they meet with the cavalry Gale was leading, everything would get solved.From Flam mountain gorge, to the wagon fortress and buckets, and finally the flame attack in Riten forest and the ambushing cavalry.The orcs went through many things in a short while.\u2018They will be out of their mind.\u2019Roan\u2019s corner of his mouth slightly raised. The corner of Roan\u2019s mouth slightly rasied.He clapped and yelled with all his strength.\u201cNow! Everyone, we are falling back to outside the forest!\u201dThe orcs had already charged to a deep part of the forest.There was no need to chase their back anymore.On top of that, the smoke was filling the forest entirely.\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dThe soldiers replied in a loud voice and moved quickly.Because their eyes and nose hurt because of the white smoke.\u201cCough. Cough. It seems like sir adjutant is fine. I\u2019m almost dying.\u201dLander looked at Roan while fanning with his hands.Roan just put a faint smile instead of replying.\u2018It\u2019s all because of Kalian\u2019s tear and Brent\u2019s ring.\u2019Actually, the part of his eyes not hurting and not feeling any heat were things he had already expected.But he didn\u2019t know that he would be fine after breathing in smoke.It certainly smelled like smoke, but his nose and mouth weren\u2019t uncomfortable or hurt.\u2018The abilities Brent\u2019s ring has may be more various than what I thought.\u2019On top of that, the white forest that was filling the forest couldn\u2019t obstruct Roan\u2019s sight.It wasn\u2019t that he could see clearly, but even so he could see more clearly than normal people.\u2018Searching for each ability that Kalian\u2019s tear and Brent\u2019s ring haves will also be fun.\u2019Roan smiled brightly and touched his ring.He, and the 12th squad protected the forest until the end.They were looking thoroughly for any orc that got left behind.\u201cIt seems like they all retreated.\u201dAustin approached while fanning with his hand.Roan nodded.\u201cGood. Then we are also getting out of the forest.\u201dAt those words, Lander smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.\u201cIt\u2019s so regrettable that we lost Violin, that crazy orc bitch. This battle that was planned by sir adjutant Roan from start to end will end up in the hands of another person.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care much.\u201dRoan shrugged his shoulders.Lander, that looked that, clenched his fists tightly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, at least I can\u2026..\u201d\u201cStop talking. Please. What are you going to do after you catch Violin?\u201dAustin frowned and rebuked.At those words, Lander hit his armor.\u201cI want to place an adjutant badge on my armor after catching that bitch. Only then will you, vice squad commander, not be able to say anything to me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAustin raised his hand as if he was going to hit him at any moment.Lander acted as if he got really frightened by that and started to run in front.Roan looked at that and smiled.\u2018Even so, it\u2019s fortunate that everyone is safe.\u2019On a battlefield where tens of people, and thousands of people died, no one from the 12th squad died.died from the 12th squad.They did receive big and small wounds, but they keptwere still keeping their lives.\u2018Now that it became like this, I would like it if I can stay with everyone until the end.\u2019Roan looked at the back of the squad members and took in a deep breath.That was because he knew really well that it would be difficult.Then, Lander who was walking in front, looked at his surroundings and yelled.\u201cWhere are you everyone? Come, come quickly please.\u201dMeanwhile, the smoke got denser and it became difficult to differentiate what was in front of you.Roan looked back.Tadak. Tadadak.The sound of the flames eating up the trees was heard.Every now and againonce and then, white and black smoke surged up.\u2018Huh?\u2019Then, a really small and displeasing sound was heard.\u2018A sound that shakes the ground\u2026\u2026\u2019He quickly turned his head towards the place the sound was heard.At that instant, Roan\u2019s two eyes became round.\u201cViolin!\u201dHe could see Violin running through between the smoke.\u201cYes? That was sir adjutant right now, right? You said Violin? Just because I made a joke right now, even you are\u2026..\u201dWhen Lander talked up to then.The white smoke got pushed.Roan looked at the scattering smoke fixedly.The whole world\u2019s movement became slow.Spaaat!The lopus that charged through the smoke really slowly.And Violin that was swinging the blade on top of the lopus.Roan opened his eyes abruptly and yelled.\u201cLander! Dodge!\u201dThe loud yell rang throughout the forest.Lander, who was looking around looking for Roan, lowered his body with a surprised look.Slash!The blade that pierced through the smoke instantly cut off Lander\u2019s neck.\u201cNo!\u201dLander\u2019s face was chopped off in front ofgot hardly stabbed in Roan\u2019s two eyes.The head that fell to the ground really slowly.The light in his eyes still didn\u2019t go off.Roan raised his spear and ran towards Lander.\u201cWha, what happened?!\u201d\u201cSir adjutant?\u201dThe 12th squad members, that had it difficult to look at the front, shook their hands and followed Roan\u2019s back.\u201cLander!\u201dRoan cried out while holding Lander\u2019s head.\u201cUaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because of the smoke\u2026\u2026\u2026 Kuk.\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t hide the crying sound that came out from his voice.\u201cUhhhhhhhh.\u201d\u201cKuhhhh.\u201dKeep and Glenn couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and started to cry loudly.They remembered the sight of Lander who liked to smile and talk.The words he spoke before going to battle.Pierce forcefully gulped down the tears and shook his head.\u201cWhat fun is a meal without Lander\u2026\u2026\u201dSorrow denser than smoke filled the forest.Today, they didn\u2019t lose a comrade, but a piece of their hearts.*****Tadadak. Tadak.The sound of the fire eating the trees was clear.A red flame.In the middle of that, there was Violin.\u201cOnly now can I see well.\u201dShe looked in front of her and smiled ill-naturedly.As she ran while evading the white smoke, she was soon in the middle of the fire.Maybe it was because of the fire, but the smoke that covered her eyes became faintly dispersed.\u201cI will have to cut off your neck.\u201dThe owner of the cold voice was Roan.He slowly breathed out and calmed himself down.\u201cThe one that died right now was your underling?\u201d\u201cLander. That was his name.\u201dRoan spoke coldly and bit his lips.Violin smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cAs I couldn\u2019t see in front, I cut off the neck of the one that talked loudly. I wondered what would I do if it was you. Because you don\u2019t die that easily.\u201dShe pointed at the fire spreading because of the wind.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the best place to die together?\u201dViolin thought up of the death of her husband again and was filled with madness once more.\u201cTogether? It\u2019s certain that you are a crazy bitch.\u201dRoan pointed at Violin with his spear.The fire gulped down the trees at the sides and shook.Even so, Roan and Violin didn\u2019t react at all.\u2018Once again, i\u2019m seeing the effects of Brent ring.\u2019Thanks to one of the ring\u2019s abilities, that was temperature regulation, he felt warm even when he was in the middle of a fire path.\u2018But of course, it\u2019s not that my skin is fine.\u2019Brent\u2019s ring only regulated your temperature, it didn\u2019t block the heat entirely.If the fire became fiercer than now, there was a high possibility that he would get burnt.In the other side, Violin couldn\u2019t feel the heat because of the madness.In one sentence, she became really crazy\u201cKuk! I will kill you first and follow you back.\u201dSrung.Violin laughed strangely and unsheathed her blade.Tadadak. Tadadak.For a while, only the sound of burning trees was heard.Swuk.Then, a spark flew between Roan and Violin.The spark was precisely in between their sights.Tat!The two of them charged forward just like they had agreed beforehand.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The final battle started in the fire along the sound of metal clashing.\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dRoan\u2019s and Violin\u2019s attacks continued without stopping.Once the battle started, the surrounding fire didn\u2019t affect them at all.The two only focused on each other.They lightly ignored the spark that fell on their armour.Spat!Violin\u2019s blade slightly cut off Roan\u2019s shoulder.\u2018She\u2019s a monster.\u2019Roan looked at Violin and ground his teeth.Her body was shining in red because of the attack she suffered from Pierce.She had lost a lot of blood.But even so, her movements were no different from usual.No, rather it seemed like her movements were faster and stronger.When he was facing her, he got the feeling that she resembled a mad warrior.\u2018I can\u2019t get pushed like this.\u2019Roan quickly turned around and stabbed with his spear.\u201cHmph!\u201dViolin snorted and swung her blade.Then, the spear moved faintly like it was dancing, and it\u2019s trajectory changed.\u201cKuk!\u201dViolin ground her teeth and pulled her blade back, but it was too late.Stab.The spear pierced her left shoulder.\u201cKugh!\u201dHowever it wasn\u2019t a complete success.Violin grabbed the spear with her left hand.Roan stabbed the spear with all of his strength, but it didn\u2019t move an inch.Violin\u2019s strength was that amazing.Even after that, Violin\u2019s and Roan\u2019s attacks continued without even one inch of concession.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The sound of metal clashing without stopping.Kugung. Boom.The trees that fell without being able to hold the fire.The heat of the battle became hotter with many meanings.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dThe blade and spear swung with all their strengths.Cheng!Sparks flashed along with the sound of metal.Tat!In the end Roan and Violin distanced themselves.\u201cPant. Pant. Pant.\u201dRoan was almost out of breath.His shoulders, chest, abdomen and thighs were filled with big and small holes.\u201cHaa. Haa.\u201dViolin was also exhausted.It had also been a while since the madness that made her forget her nature disappear.On top of that, her injuries were worse than Roan\u2019s.You could see many deep wounds.They exchanged sights.\u2018Let\u2019s end this now.\u2019\u2018This is the last one.\u2019Even if they didn\u2019t say anything, they understood each other.Boom. Boooom.The flames were already near them.Even if they wanted to keep fighting, they couldn\u2019t.Roan and Violin took in a deep breath and charged forward.Spat!Roan\u2019s spear sliced Violin\u2019s shoulder.\u201cKukh.\u201dViolin\u2019s movements were also dull as she was exhausted.She just confronted him and swung her blade.Roan ground his teeth and twisted his body.Slash.The old armor got cut off cleanly.Not only that, but his clothes and flesh also got cut quite deeply.\u2018Kugh.\u2019Roan ground his teeth.It wasn\u2019t to the point where he couldn\u2019t endure it.He turned around quickly and swung his spear.Violin pulled the blade without even showing that she wanted to dodge and blocked the spear.Cheng!The spear used the rebound and spun to the other side.\u2018Let\u2019s end it with this.\u2019Roan was planning to execute the 7th stance of Pierce\u2019s spearmanship, no, Roan\u2019s spearmanship.It was the strongest one amongst the ones he could execute in his current state.\u2018Hph!\u2019He took in a deep breath.Muscles on both of his arms swelled up.Spat!The spear head cut through the wind.The body of the spear widely shook to the sides.\u2018Damn!\u2019Violin looked at the spear that moved gorgeously to the point it made her dizzy and bit her lips.Because the spear swayed too widely, she couldn\u2019t be certain if it was aiming for her right or for her left.\u201cUaaahap!\u201dViolin cried out loudly and swung her blade.THen.Tung!The spear hit the air with a heavy sound as if it got bounced off.The spear evaded the blade and cut into her left side.\u2018Kuk!\u2019A movement she hadn\u2019t expected at all.Violin twisted her body all she could and swung her blade.But the movement of the spear was much faster than what she expected.Stab.The blade of the spear got stabbed into her side.\u2018It has ended.\u2019Roan felt the heavy feeling transmitted to the end of his hands and let out a long sigh.Then Violin swung her blade widely and cut off the spear.Stab.The strong spear got cut off cleanly.\u2018Damn!\u2019Roan fell back and had a surprised expression.\u2018When we battled on the plains, a crack appeared on the body of the spear.\u2019The part where it was a bit broken when it faced against the blade.Violin looked for that place and broke it in two in an instant.\u201cKuk.\u201dShe grabbed the spear stabbed in her side and staggered.It must certainly feel nasty and painful, but there was a smile on her face.\u201cIt seems like I won this battle. You are empty handed but I have my blade.\u201dViolin swung her blade.Roan threw the short body of the spear and shook his head.\u201cI wonder. We have yet to see that.\u201dHe brought his hand to his waist.He touched the long steel stick with the tip of his hands.\u2018Travias spear.\u2019The spear he couldn\u2019t use in the Pedian\u2019s plain battle because he didn\u2019t have mana.But in this situation, this was the only weapon he could use.Violin looked at that and sneered.\u201cKuk! You will fight with that small piece of metal?\u201dShe shook her head and moved towards Roan.\u201cLet\u2019s go to hell together with me.\u201dViolin bit her lower lips tightly and swung her blade.As she still had the spear stabbed in her side, her movements were really slow and unnatural.Swush.Roan barely dodged her blade and stabbed his Travias spear towards her neck.\u201cHmph!\u201dViolin snorted and grabbed the piece of metal with her left hand.Roan tried to pierce more with all his strength but it didn\u2019t move at all.\u201cDo you think you will be able to kill me with this metal stick?\u201dThe tip of the metal stick touched Violin\u2019s chin.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cIf it\u2019s this much, I can kill you plentily.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dViolin frowned.Just how could this piece of metal, where the end was blunt, be able to kill her!Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cGrab there tightly.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dAt the words she didn\u2019t know the meaning of, Violin frowned.Then, Roan twisted his wrist and turned the tip of the stick hard.Kigigi.A displeasing sound.The end of the spear criss crossed and turned to the sides with the sound of oxidized metal turning.\u201cHuh?\u201dViolin opened her eyes roundly at the stick in her hands that was changing.\u201cGreet Sedek for me.\u201dRoan\u2019s farewell.At the same time.Click.The tip of the spear separated with the sound of sawtooths went in gear.Cheeng.A sharp blade surged up along with a clear sound of metal.Stab.The blade passed through Violin\u2019s chin and pierced her head.\u201cGrrrrrr.\u201dThe expression of Violin as if she couldn\u2019t believe it.She fell to the ground.\u201cWhew\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan also let out a long sigh and staggered for a moment.The feeling of all his strength leaving his body.\u2018She was a strong opponent.\u2019She was one of the strongest opponents he had faced until now.\u2018I have to quickly learn mana.\u2019If he didn\u2019t do so, situations where he will have it hard with only an orc commander will keep repeating.Tadadadak. Boom. Kung.Then, the surrounding trees fell because of the flames.\u2018I will have to get out of here for now.\u2019Roan pulled out the Travias spear and cut off Violin\u2019s head.She still had her eyes open.\u2018I will offer your head to Lander.\u2019Roan ground his teeth.At the same time, he moved his steps while looking at the burning flames.Kugugugung.Then, on the place he left, trees started to fall and flames took its place.*****The battle ended in a complete victory.Violin\u2019s troop got annihilated, and the losses of rose troop and blackbird\u2019s troop were minimal.However on the faces of Gale, the adjutants and the soldiers happiness couldn\u2019t be seen for their victory.They all looked at Riten forest with anxious looks.Boom. Kugung.The trees falling because of the fire.And the amazing smoke that is continued by that.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSir adjutant Roan.\u201d\u201cPlease, you have to be safe\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThey were still waiting for Roan who couldn\u2019t get out of the forest until now.Now, Riten forest was completely enveloped by flames.Then, Pierce walked to the front.\u201cI can\u2019t hold it anymore. I will go in.\u201dAt those words Austin put a surprised expression and grabbed him.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d\u201cThen are you telling me to just stand still and watch! I will go in and bring sir adjutant Roan!\u201dPierce\u2019s yell.At those words the 12th squad ground their teeth.\u201cWon\u2019t it be fine if we pour water on ourselves?\u201d\u201cWe will also go in.\u201dThe members of the 12th squad were taking the lead on each other by saying that they would get inside the fire.At that look Gale, the adjutants and the other soldiers let out a low exclamation.\u2018The comradeship of the 12th squad is amazing.\u2019\u2018He has good subordinates.\u2019Then, Austin that was stopping the others, pointed at Riten forest.\u201cHuh?!\u201dA really surprised expression.Everyone turned their heads and looked at Riten forest.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation came out from the mouth of everyone.The place where their sights gathered.The youth they longed for that much showed himself in front of the entrance.The youth who was releasing hot steam while being covered in blood was Roan.\u201cSir adjutant Roan!\u201d\u201cSir!\u201dThe squad members all ran towards Roan.Roan raised Violin\u2019s head towards them.\u201cI bought a gift for Lander.\u201dHe looked hopeless, but he still had strength in his voice.The squad members looked like they would cry at any moment.They didn\u2019t say anymore.They just hugged themselves with the heat.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s amazing, right?\u201dA good looking middle aged woman smiled brightly and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing? The orc troop must have been stupid.\u201dFrom the other side a fine voice was heard.The owner of the voice was a woman in her early twenties.White skin, quite large facial features, and long black hair. It was quite a cute lady.Only, her face was filled with playfulness so she gave a childish aura.Then, a heavy and a low voice was heard.\u201cNo. Jane\u2019s right. This Slan battle was really amazing.\u201dThe man that was seated next to the young woman was also a handsome man in his early twenties.At those words, the middle aged woman and Jane widely opened their eyes.\u201cRight? It\u2019s true that our 7th corps soldiers are amazing. Sir Owells.\u201d\u201cI told you to just call me Walter.\u201d\u201cYes? Yes. Mister Walter.\u201dJane hesitated and nodded.Walter Owells was a noble and she was no different than a commoner.Because of that it was still awkward to call him by his name and not his surname.\u201cAre the soldiers of our 7th corps really that amazing?\u201dThe young woman leaned her head on Walter\u2019s shoulder.Walter slightly pinched her cheek as if it was cute.\u201cMary. I have never seen the strategy used in Slan region anywhere else. They made a fortress by utilizing wagons and barrels? It\u2019s a strategy I can\u2019t imagine at all.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt those words the young woman, Mary smiled merrily and buried her face on Walter\u2019s chest.A really happy look.She was Mary Tate, the daughter of Aaron Tate.\u2018Walter is praising our 7th corps.\u2019She felt proud.\u201cAs it\u2019s something said by the strongest and most intelligent person, I can believe in you right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dJane butted in.\u201cHmhm.\u201dWalter cleared his throat as if it was embarrassing.However, pride showed on his face which he couldn\u2019t hide.\u201cAnyways, I want to meet the person that thought of that strategy. And\u2026..\u201dWalter gulped the last words.\u2018I also want to meet the soldier that slew the crazy female Orc warrior Violin.\u2019Something hot was felt deep in his chest.Competitiveness.He too, was a man.\u201cThat\u2019s why we are going to the battlefield.\u201dMary pouted her lips.Before she entered Slen region, she met with the messenger Aaron had sent.Because of that they waited for 4 days in the nearest castle until the battle ended.And right two days before, she heard the notices that the battle had ended by travelers and merchants.No, it wasn\u2019t a notice of the battle simply having ended.They told them the stories and the actions of the 7th corps in a detailed fashion.The marvelous strategy and of course an outstanding commanding and strong military.There wasn\u2019t one thing that wasn\u2019t amazing.\u2018I still can\u2019t forget Walter\u2019s surprised expression from back then.\u2019A proud feeling for nothing.Actually, she was feeling a guilty conscience from Walter.She was from the outer areas of the kingdom, from the eastern boundaries, and also didn\u2019t have any family or reputation to show.Compared to her, Walter\u2019s father was a really powerful influential person as he was the leader of the knights of the count.Outstanding looks and amazing skills, on top of that a family whose future seemed really bright.Walter was more outstanding than Mary in every aspect..\u2018That Walter got surprised by the activities of our 7th corps.\u2019Her lips continued to raise.A feeling she wanted to give a kiss to the one that thought of the strategy and the one who slew Violin right now if only they were in front of her.Then, Walter\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIt was a nonsense favor, but thanks for listening to it.\u201dAt those words Mary shook her head.\u201cNo. If Walter wants to see it, we have to go whatever happens.\u201dWalter, who heard of the stories from the merchants and travellers, begged Mary to let him meet the soldiers of the 7th corps.Mary nodded immediately as she felt she could do something for Walter.It wasn\u2019t important if it was possible or impossible.She just wanted to listen to Walter\u2019s favor.In the eyes of Mary, who was looking at Walter, love completely filled it.Jane looked at that and smiled.\u2018The lady also grew up.\u2019It has already been 20 years since she has been with Mary.She had never parted ways with Mary from when she was born until she became 20 years old.\u2018You certainly have to grab mister Walter.\u2019Jane slightly looked at Walter.A really clear appearance and look.Most of all, his mouth and thick chin that seemed to have rostrum made him look more manly.\u2018His family is good, his looks are also good, and as he\u2019s a pupil from the head of Pavor academy his abilities also are good\u2026\u2026 There\u2019s no one better for our lady Mary.\u2019On top of that, Walter also treated Mary really well.It was also him that told her to go and congratulate Aaron\u2019s birthday first.\u2018There are some times where his competitiveness get excessive, but if he\u2019s a man it\u2019s a point he certainly needs.\u2019If he was someone that would become big in the future, he needed that temperament.\u2018Perhaps, he would be able to enter the royal knights. If he does\u2026\u2026..\u2019Mary would also be able to leave this outer region and go to the capital of Miller which they had only dreamt of.\u2018On top of that, the two of them really suit each other.\u2019Jane and Mary looked at Walter alternatingly and shut their mouths.Then, the direction of the carriage turned a little along the cry of the horse.Johnson, who was driving the carriage, yelled in a loud voice.\u201cI see the troop\u2019s camp!\u201dAt those words, the three people gathered in the window.They could see the tents that were spread far away on the plains.It was the camp of Rose troop and BlackBird troop.In that instant, Walter felt his heart beating wildly.\u2018Are we arriving soon?\u2019Over there was the soldier that thought of that amazing strategy and the one that slew Violin\u2019s head.\u2018I will learn what I have to\u2026\u2026.\u2019A smile appeared on his shut mouth.\u2018I will battle with him if I can.\u2019Deep in his heart, competitiveness boiled.*****Although the battle preparations had only lasted for 4 days, the battle itself didn\u2019t last for more than a day.Even so, the soldiers were completely exhausted.They wanted to say down and sleep like that, but there were still many things they had to do.First, they had to catch the fire of Riten forest and gather the corpses of the orcs in one place.And of course, they also carefully gathered the corpses of their fallen allies.They also filled up the traps on the plains and repaired the wagons and barrels or made new ones.Because they couldn\u2019t make the farmers of this region suffer through this battle.Because of that, the soldiers that could move had to sweat like crazy.And that was the same for the 12th squad.Even so, because of Gale\u2019s consideration, they got to take care of organizing the goods of the camp.\u201cNow! Pile it up properly. Properly.\u201d\u201cMove this over there.\u201d\u201cGive me that.\u201dThe members of the 12th squad and some other squads moved busily and piled up the remaining food and equipment in one place.Then, Keep stealthily left the place.But even without Kalian\u2019s tear, Austin caught up with the lazy guy like a ghost.\u201cHey! Keep! Where are you going!\u201dAt those words Keep flinched and grabbed his waist.\u201cI\u2019m going to pee.\u201d\u201cTch! Go quickly!\u201dAt Austin\u2019s words, Keep nodded and moved his feet.Only after he got out of the camp did he loosen his belt.\u201cUo. How refreshing.\u201dKeep closed his eyes and trembled, and then frowned.\u2018What\u2019s this sound?\u2019It was a really small but familiar sound.He roughly adjusted his pants and moved towards the plain.Then, he saw the carriage that was moving quickly.\u201cCarriage?\u201dFor a carriage to appear in a zone where a battle had just ended.Keep rubbed his fingers on his thighs and ran inside the camp.\u201cVice squad commander.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dAustin, that was distributing the goods, asked back with a tired expression.Keep said in a voice so low, it seemed like he was whispering.\u201cA carriage is approaching.\u201d\u201cCarriage?\u201dWords he had never thought of.Austin put down the food bag he was carrying and moved to the entrance of the camp.Keep quickly followed his back.The soldiers on the entrance had already raised the fences and put on a vigilant posture.Austin looked at the carriage coming quickly towards the entrance and frowned.\u2018Why a carriage so suddenly\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019While he was thinking this and that the carriage already got close to the entrance.\u201cHuh? That flag\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the carriage got closer they could see the small flag stuck on the roof.A really familiar flag.Keep, that was looking next to him, frowned.\u201cIsn\u2019t that baron Tate\u2019s symbol? The symbol of corps commander Aaron Tate.\u201d\u201cIt is. I\u2019m certain.\u201dAustin nodded.It was impossible that they didn\u2019t know of the family symbol as a soldier of the 7th corps.\u201cPerhaps, corps commander?\u201dAt Keep\u2019s words Austin shook his head.\u2018Corps commander enjoys riding a horse rather than a carriage. On top of that, there\u2019s no way only one carriage would move when the commander himself is travelling.\u2019Then, only one thing remains.\u2018It means that someone from the Tate family is riding it\u2026..\u2019Whoever it was, it was a situation difficult to understand it.\u2018Is there a reason for the lady or the madam to come?\u2019However he rolled his read he couldn\u2019t find an apparent reason.Meanwhile, the carriage stopped in front of the entrance.Purrrrr.The carriage stopped along the burbling of the horse.Austin and Keep looked at the door of the carriage with quite nervous expressions.Kiig.The door opened along with a wooden sound.The first one that appeared was Jane.She stood in front of the door with a humble posture.Next to that, Walter showed himself.He smiled faintly and looked at the entrance of the camp.\u2018The attitudes and the eyes of the guards are good.\u2019He felt that all the rumours about the battle were true.Then, Mary showed herself through the door of the carriage.Walter quickly grabbed Mary\u2019s hand and gently escorted her.A really elegant and beautiful movement.Austin and Keep, who were looking without a word opened their eyes widely.\u2018Lady!\u2019It\u2019s lady Mary!\u2019Baron Tate\u2019s daughter appeared in their camp.A really uneasy feeling as if something would already happen.Then, Mary smiled brightly and approached.\u201cPleased to meet you. Do you know who am I?\u201d\u201cYes. Milady.\u201dAustin and Keep bent down.Mary smiled even more brightly and shook her hands.\u201cI came to meet Uncle Rose.\u201d\u201cU, Uncle Rose\u2026\u2026:\u201dTheir processing ability stopped for a moment.Mary pouted her lips as if they didn\u2019t even know that.\u201cThe troop commander here. I\u2019m talking about Mister Gale.\u201d\u201cAh! Troop commander.\u201dAustin and Keep understood it only then and nodded.Behind them, a low voice was heard.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe owner of the voice was Roan.While he was distributing the goods inside the camp, he discovered the carriage and had come over.He had taken off his upper clothes and got covered in bandages to get treatment for the wounds he got in the chest by Violin.On top of that, as he vaguely washed himself, the water still didn\u2019t dry off.Because of the endless training, practice and the battles his body was quite built up and the skin had a pleasing colour to look at.Because he trained with the best training methods available 20 years from now on, the bones and muscles took their place well and because of that he beacame a bit taller and his body\u2019s balance became better.In short words, a really well made body the moment you saw it, it would make you speechless.On top of that, the hair that was messy and the water drops that dripped from it emanated a wild charm.\u2018He\u2019s cool.\u2019Even Austin and Keep were hanging with their mouths open.And that was the same for Walter and Mary.\u2018It\u2019s a feeling he overwhelms people.\u2019Walter\u2019s thoughts.\u2018Wh, what is it? He\u2019s wild but at the same time he feels really sad.\u2019Mary\u2019s thoughts.\u2018My god. How cool!\u2019The last one was Jane\u2019s thoughts.Roan was really exhausted in mind and body because of Violin\u2019s battle and Lander\u2019s death.And that also emanated a really strange atmosphere.Sadness and malaise.\u2018It feels like he\u2019s bearing all the weight in the world.\u2019Mary\u2019s eyes shone.But she didn\u2019t know.That Roan was just exhausted and his eyes were giving in.Roan passed Austin and Keep and stood in front of Mary and Walter.\u201cI\u2019m class 5 adjutant from Rose troop. What happened?\u201dOnly then did Mary get a hold of herself and smiled.\u201cI\u2019m Mary Tate. I came to meet Uncle Gale.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dRoan slowly bent down.\u2018So this person is the daughter of Commander Aaron.\u2019He thought he now knew the reason Aaron treasured her so much.\u2018She looks cute.\u2019He made hand signs to the guards.Srr.The wooden fences blocking the entrance were taken off.\u201cI will lead you.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words Mary nodded.\u201cPlease.\u201dA clear and gentle voice.Roan slightly nodded and started to walk one step in front of them.Behind him Walter, Mary and Jane followed.As soon as they got inside the camp all the soldiers put down their things and gathered as soon as they saw a woman.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s the lady.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lady Mary.\u201d\u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201dEveryone recognized Mary and shook their hands or bent down.Walter, who was walking behind, looked at that and smiled.\u2018It seems like she\u2019s popular between the soldiers.\u2019It meant that she didn\u2019t have a bad temperament.\u2018I certainly picked a good person.\u2019While Walter was thinking like that, Roan who was walking in front stopped walking.At the same time a thick voice was heard.\u201cLady!\u201dThe middle aged man that comes smiling brightly.It was Gale, who Mary referred to as uncle.\u201cUncle!\u201dMary also smiled brightly and shook her hand.The two people grabbed their hands and said hello for quite a while.After a while, Mary pointed at Walter late.\u201cHere is Walter, Walter Owells.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m troop commander Gale of rose troop from the 7th corps.\u201dGale bent down deeply.As he had seen Mary since she was a newborn he could talk with her without hesitation, but it was different in the case of Walter.In front of status, age and rank didn\u2019t matter at all.\u201cI\u2019m Walter Owells.\u201dWalter was also skillful in acting disrespectful.After the short introductions ended, Gale looked at Mary.\u201cBut why did you come here?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAt those words Mary looked at Walter for a moment and replied in a low voice.\u201cThey say there\u2019s someone who planned a really amazing strategy in Slen battle. I want to meet that person. Who is it? Is it perhaps Uncle Rose? Or the black bird uncle? Or perhaps one of the adjutants?\u201dShe was referring to troop commander Jefferson when she said black bird uncle.Mary didn\u2019t even breath and after she finished her sentence she looked at Gale\u2019s two eyes fixedly.Eyes implying to answer immediately.Gale smiled brightly and replied.\u201cIf it\u2019s that guy you have already met him.\u201dAt those words Mary and Walter had surprised expressions.\u201cHuh? We met him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGale replied shortly and pointed at Roan who was still next to them.\u201cThis friend here is the one that planned the strategy.\u201dBoom.In that moment, Mary\u2019s and Walter\u2019s eyes became big.They had expressions as if someone had hit the back of their heads.\u201cI\u2019m class 5 adjutant Roan from rose troop.\u201dIn the other side Roan bent down with a calm expression.\u2018This is the person that thought of that amazing and marvelous strategy?\u2019Mary looked at Roan\u2019s face fixedly.However she looked he didn\u2019t look like he used his head.\u2018Oh right! There was one more.\u2019Mary calmed herself down and looked at Gale again.\u201cThere\u2019s someone else I want to meet.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cThey say there\u2019s a soldier that slew that crazy female or warrior Violin. Where\u2019s that person?\u201dGale smiled brightly again and replied.\u201cYou also have already met that person.\u201d\u201cHuh? We also already met that person?\u201dMary put a surprised expression and looked around.It was when Walter also looked at his surroundings.Gale placed his hand on Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThis friend here is the one that slew the head of Violin.\u201dBoom.Once again their eyes became big.No, this time it was even more so.They were all hanging their mouths open unconsciously.In the other side Roan nodded with a calm expression again.\u201cI\u2019m class 5 adjutant Roan from rose troop.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: Vape_LupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 48 - To the south (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cUoo.\u201dMary let out a weird noise.She looked at Roan as if it was difficult to believe.And Walter was also the same.\u2018That the one that thought up of the strategy and the one that slew Violin\u2019s neck were the same person?\u2019She hadn\u2019t heard that rumour.As the battle had ended not too long ago, the detailed and precise information was missing.Roan smiled at the gazes falling upon him.He looked at Gale and shrugged his shoulders.\u2018From now on, things like this will happen a lot.\u2019Gale laughed it off with that kind of meaning.Roan turned to look at Walter and Mary again.He couldn\u2019t speak as he wished so he only looked at their faces alternatingly.After a while, Walter got ahold of himself and extended his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s Walter Owells.\u201dRoan grabbed his hand and bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s Roan.\u201dOnly then did the greetings start.\u201cMary.\u201dMary also got ahold of herself.But on her face, a surprised look still remained.\u2018It\u2019s somewhat unexpected.\u2019There was a personage she had thought of when she heard the rumours.\u2018I thought that the man that thought up of the strategy would have a long beard and was a middle aged uncle, and the one that slew Violin had a big body and looked like a mountain thief.\u2019The guesses of the two people were wrong.No, in the first place she hadn\u2019t even expected that they would be the same person.Then, Gale\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cLet\u2019s not keep standing like this and go inside.\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeah. Right.\u201dMary couldn\u2019t take her sight off from Roan even while nodding.And Walter was also the same.No, Jane who was at the back was also the same.\u2018He\u2019s a really good looking youth.\u2019But of course, only Jane was thinking of different things.*****Gale lead Mary, Walter and Jane to his tent.And of course Roan too, who was the objective of their visit, was with them.As soon as Walter sat down he started to pour questions onto Roan.\u201cFirst, shall we talk about the strategies implemented in the Slen battle?\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan talked about the flow of the battle, the strategies he used and the countermeasures for when things turned out the way he hadn\u2019t expected.Walter nodded with a serious face or exclaimed, but he always showed an honest reaction.\u201cSo you are saying that you had taken countermeasures for when they got out of the forest?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dWalter touched his chin for a moment and fell into his thoughts.After a while, he looked at Roan and said with a careful attitude.\u201cBut you know. I know that your strategy is outstanding, but I have some doubts about it.\u201d\u201cI will listen to them.\u201d\u201cFirst, that region uses Riten forest as the main moving route rather than Flam mountain gorge, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen, if you hadn\u2019t taken oil barrels, Violin\u2019s troop would have passed the forest. Then what about stationing the wagon fortresses you made on the east of Riten forest and made it so they couldn\u2019t get out?\u201dWalter looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cYou did say that you lacked oil, but I think that if you only lit the west entrance of the forest it would have been enough to cover them.\u201dRoan shut his mouth and didn\u2019t talk without permission.Walter smiled faintly and made hand signs.\u201cIt\u2019s fine so tell me what you think about it.\u201dAt those words Roan said in a voice as if he was whispering.\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy that can be thought over plentily. Only, it\u2019s not a big forest to be able to carry 2000 warriors. Following by that, to give Violin\u2019s troop a big blow we have to light the forest on fire the same moment they get inside of it. Because of that, we should have poured oil in the western part of the forest before hand.\u201dA clear voice and with strength.Roan continued saying.\u201cBut the oil we had was really cheap and of bad quality. Because of that, the smell was really bad. If we had poured oil on the west entrance of the forest it was obvious that the lopuses would stop by smelling the oil. And actually, the lopuses showed a big reaction to the oil barrels in this battle.\u201dLopuses were monsters similar to dogs or wolves rather than horses.They were quite sensitive on smell.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dWalter let out a low exclamation.Certainly, if it were lopuses they would be able to detect the smell of the cheap oil.Walter hit the end of the table with his finger.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I was short minded. I\u2019m learning one more thing like this.\u201dA quick and honest admitting.Roan was surprised.\u2018Was there a noble like this?\u2019He had heard that he was a disciple of the knight chief of Pavor academy and his house was also good.On top of that, his looks were obviously good and his temperament was also good.\u2018I obviously know about Owells family, but why can\u2019t I remember anything about Walter?\u2019If he was a person like this, he would remember him with whatever he did, but in Roan\u2019s memories there was no such name of Walter Owells.And there would be two cases for it.\u2018He lived a meaningless life\u2026..\u2019Roan turned to look at Walter.\u2018He died early on even before his abilities could bloom.\u2019Even so, when he looked at Walter right now, there was a high probability for the latter one being the case.\u2018Thinking about it, there would be countless geniuses that died without me knowing\u2026\u2026.\u2019Excluding the ones that succeeded big way, there may also be geniuses that died before they could bloom.\u2018Aside of the geniuses I know from the past, I have to also find the hidden ones.\u2019It was important to use the memories of the future, but it was also important to build a new future with his own effort.When he thought up to that point, Walter\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cAnd one more thing. About the traps in front of the wagon fortress.\u201d\u201cYes. We dug into the ground and filled it with sand and water.\u201d\u201cYeah, that. If it was to the point you precisely guessed the location they would pass to, wouldn\u2019t putting sharp pieces of metal or spears have been more effective than sand or water? What do you think?\u201dAt those words, Roan put a surprised expression instead of replying.And then he smiled bitterly.\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of that. I did think that I should tie down the legs of the lopuses, but I couldn\u2019t think about damaging them with the trap itself.\u201dHe lowered his head.\u201cThis time i\u2019m learning big way.\u201d\u201cReally? This time I was a step ahead? Hahaha.\u201dWalter became happy and laughed loudly.Gale and Mary\u2019s faces, who were looking next to them, changed in a strange way.\u2018I do know about Roan\u2019s abilities well, but Mister Walter is also amazing at such a young age.\u2019Gale\u2019s thoughts.But Mary\u2019s thoughts were really different.\u2018Is this something to be that happy about?\u2019She couldn\u2019t understand anything about strategy or the things they talked about.\u2018If this happens you do this, and if that do that. Is this that funny? Even so\u2026\u2026\u2019Mary looked at Walter\u2019s side.\u2018If Walter likes it, I also like it.\u2019Her mouth raised by itself.Roan and Walter kept talking about strategy and tactics for a long while even after that.It was to the point that Gale, who had roamed the battlefield for tens of years, got tired.Walter clapped.Clap.\u201cToday\u2019s conversation was really useful. I learned this and that and realized many things.\u201d\u201cI also learned many things.\u201dRoan bowed.Walter looked at that Roan and put on a regretful voice.\u201cActually. When the conversation ended I wanted to battle you. I wanted to taste the abilities of the one who slew Violin\u2019s neck myself. But\u2026..\u201dHe pointed at Roan\u2019s chest.Bandages covering the deep wound.\u201cI can\u2019t fight with a wounded person. That\u2019s why.\u201dWalter took off the small badge he had on his clothes.\u201cIf you completely heal, come and find me to Pavor academy. Let\u2019s test our abilities then.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t completely subdue his competitiveness.Mary, who was next to him, put on a surprised face.\u201cThey give that badge to each of the disciples in a class. Can you give it just like that to anyone?\u201dAt those words Walter shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not to anyone, and it\u2019s not giving it away like that. I\u2019m giving it courteously to someone that has the skills.\u201dHe extended the badge towards Roan.Roan looked Walter\u2019s eyes for a moment and then grabbed the badge.\u201cI will be going later.\u201d\u201cI will be waiting for you.\u201dWalter smiled brightly and stood up.He shook his hand towards Gale.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for coming so abruptly when you would still be busy.\u201dGale just smiled instead of replying.Mary stood up and blinked.\u201cYou are finished now?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m finished.\u201d\u201cThen we can go, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAt those words, a blooming smile appeared on Mary\u2019s face.The stories about strategies and tactics were too boring.Then, Gale\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cShall I escort you to Ipen castle?\u201dAt those words Mary rejoiced.\u201cReally? Good for me. Even if you didn\u2019t, I\u2026..\u201dThen, Walter butted in.\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201dHe shook his hand and looked at Gale and Roan alternatingly.\u201cYou still haven\u2019t finished cleaning up. I can\u2019t take off forces as I wish.\u201dReally, looks that fitted a disciple of a head chief knight.Gale slightly bowed.\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dAt the coming and going conversation, Mary pouted.\u201cOnly I feel like a spoiled kid. I also don\u2019t need any guards.\u201dShe sticked her tongue to Gale and got out of the tent with Jane.Walter looked at that and smirked, and then moved his feet.Gale, Roan and the other adjutants followed them back and saw them off.Mary glanced at Walter before leaving and said in a voice only Gale and Roan could hear.\u201cRose uncle. And Roan.\u201dA sweet voice.\u201cYou have done well. And thank you.\u201dShe winked and got in the carriage.Walter shrugged his shoulder as if implying what happened, but Gale and Roan didn\u2019t say anything.Walter smacked his lips as if he couldn\u2019t do anything about it and got in the carriage with Jane.HiiiiingThe carriage started to move along the cry of the horse.Gale, Roan and the adjutants protected the entrance until the carriage couldn\u2019t be seen anymore.\u201cWhew. Even so, it ended without anything happening.\u201dGale\u2019s voice that was a bit relieved.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cAnyways, it seems that you will slowly get more famous seeing that rumours about Slen battle already spread.\u201dRoan only smiled at Gale\u2019s words.\u201cLike this, won\u2019t the count come to find you?\u201dHe said something comical and hit Roan\u2019s shoulder.Then, Roan slightly bowed and said in a low voice.\u201cTroop commander Gale.\u201d\u201cHuh? You have something to say?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA short reply.Gale tilted his head and asked back.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dAt those words Roan took in a breath with difficulty and said.\u201cI would like to have a temporary retirement.\u201d*****\u201cYou really are returning, right?\u201dGale asked again even when he knew he shouldn\u2019t.\u201cOf course.\u201dRoan had repeated this answer tens of times.The two people were standing in front of the 7th corps, Aaron\u2019s office.Gale sighed.\u2018When I first heard that he was temporarily retiring, my heart sunk down.\u2019Because of that, even when he was a troop commander he grabbed Roan in front of the soldiers and made a fuss.\u2018Well, although the fuss the 12th squad made was even more amazing.\u2019They grabbed Roan\u2019s legs and said that they could never let him go.Even Chris sided with the squad members before leaving to Miller.Roan had to convince the squad members for 4 days that he would return after he finished what he had to do.Only after he said that tens, hundreds of time did the 12th squad barely accept Roan\u2019s retirement.Gale also confirmed that he would return and even made a promise, and only then did he send the retirement application to Aaron.\u2018Has it been 7 times that he returned it?\u2019Aaron returned the retirement applications being sent.And when they sent the 8th one, Aaron\u2019s reply came back.Gale and Roan looked at the tightly closed door of the office.\u201cShall we go in?\u201dAt those words Roan nodded.Kiiig.The huge wooden door opened along with a creaking sound.As they got inside the office, Aaron who was checking everywhere, turned his head and looked at Roan.A stiff expression and unusual eyes.He approached Roan.\u2018Ugh. Is he angry?\u2019Gale, who was next to him, fell to the sides.Meanwhile Aaron, who reached in front of Roan, said with a really stiff face.\u201cYou really are returning, right?\u201dRoan replied once more the answer he had said to Gale and the 12th squad.\u201cOf course.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thanks for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fine then.\u201dAaron unexpectedly seemed to consent to it.He turned back and walked towards his table and then he stopped and turned to look at Roan again.\u201cYou really are returning, right?\u201dThe same question.Roan just nodded instead of replying.Aaron let out a long sigh and went towards his table.He spread the vacation petition and raised pen.\u2018If I sign it now Roan will leave.\u2019Aaron bit his lower lip.He wasn\u2019t a staff officer nor a troop commander.A mere class 5 adjutant was asking for a vacation.And the reason for it was also clear.\u2018A relative that is south of the kingdom passed away\u2026..\u2019On top of that, it was a normal case where soldiers that were above the class of adjutant asked for a vacation.It was different in each cases, but a spearman could at most take 1 year off.Even so, it didn\u2019t matter much for the corps as they wouldn\u2019t be getting their salary.Even so, he couldn\u2019t sign it easily.He could change his mind and decide to retire right away, and most of all what he hated to think the most was that Roan got transferred to another corps.But of course, it wasn\u2019t that common.As they had their own relationships within the troops, they couldn\u2019t just take a member of another troop as they wished.\u2018But if it\u2019s a troop that\u2019s on a higher class than us, it will be different.\u2019An upper class troop would even be able to blackmail Roan. No, even in a middle class or a lower class troop, they could utilize a method to newly recruit a retired one.Whatever it was, Aaron was worried about Roan disappearing from him.\u2018Most of all, the western region is noisy because of rumours about Roan.\u2019Half a month had already passed since Slen battle had ended.After the battlefield got cleaned up, the soldiers that returned from blackbird troop and rose troop kept talking about Roan\u2019s prowesses.And even if they didn\u2019t do so, it seemed like a rumour about a soldier that used an amazing strategy and at the same time slew Violin spread through travellers.Meanwhile, the rumours that were vaguely roaming spread properly through the confirmation of the soldiers.\u2018He got out of my pocket quicker than I thought.\u2019He didn\u2019t think that he would be able to hide a fang in his pocket forever.But at least, he wanted to take him to his side even a little more certainly, before it got out.\u2018I couldn\u2019t even get the reply of viscount Reil Baker\u2026\u2026.\u2019Aaron took in a deep breath.\u2018Right. If he only returns, it may be better to be out of this region.\u2019Now that it turned out like this, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to create some distance with the people interested in him.Scribble.The tip of the pen moved over the paper.Aaron finished the signing and let out a long sigh.And then looked at Roan\u2019s two eyes fixedly.\u201cAre you reall\u2026\u2026 No. How long do you think it will take until you return?\u201dThe southern part was far.It was almost the exact opposite of this place to Ipen castle.There was no way it would be short.At those words Roan replied without hesitation.\u201cIf i\u2019m quick one month, and if I get delayed three months.\u201dAaron nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that a promise for a soldier is more important than their own lives.\u201d\u201cYes. I will remember it.\u201dRoan smiled brightly and bowed.Aaron moved his feet and stood in front of Roan.He lent him the retirement permission and hit his shoulder.\u201cHave a safe trip. And certainly return.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dRoan bowed.Aaron returned once more to his seat.\u201cAh! And I have some more presents to give you.\u201d\u201cPresents?\u201dAs Roan asked back Aaron nodded.\u201cYes. But the preparations still aren\u2019t finished. If you come back later, I will give it to you then.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t ask further on and bowed.Aaron looked at the scroll in Roan\u2019s hand and shook his hand.\u201cYou can get out.\u201dEven if he tried not to show it, he put on a rather unwilling expression.Gale and Roan saluted shortly and got out of the office.Aaron, who got left alone, looked a bit more at the pieces of paper and pushed them to the side of the table.\u201cWhew.\u201dHe let out a long sigh.\u2018I did send him away for now\u2026\u2026.\u2019Now he only had to wait for Roan to return.He was a man worth the wait.\u2018Because even the eldest son of the Owell\u2019s family got amazed.\u2019Mary and Walter who arrived for his birthday.The two people, and especially Walter, praised Roan nonstop while they were staying at Ipen castle.\u2018If I make Roan mine and Mary grabs Walter\u2026\u2026\u2019A smile appeared on Aaron\u2019s mouth.\u2018Just imagining it is fun.\u2019He buried his body in the chair and closed his eyes.He wanted to enjoy this happy imagination a little bit longer.*****\u201cI told you there\u2019s no need to send me off.\u201d\u201cNo. Until the entrance of the castle. We will escort you until there.\u201dMany men walked down the street in a pack.The people that came and went recognized him and waved their arms.No, precisely speaking, their interest was pouring on the youth walking at the front of them all.\u201cHuh! Mister Roan! Where are you going?\u201d\u201cSlen battle was really the best!\u201d\u201cTake one fruit!\u201dThe youth that receives all of the people\u2019s interest.He was Roan who was starting the long journey towards the south.And of course, the 12th squad that followed him.\u201cNow really go back.\u201dRoan stood outside of the entrance and waved his arm.Austin and the other members saluted.\u201cWe will wait here from when the first month starts.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t return, we will just stay here and become rocks.\u201d\u201cHave a safe trip!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were hot and fierce.\u2018Don\u2019t worry. I will certainly return. No, I can only do so.\u2019Roan looked at every faces of the members and moved his feet.\u2018If my future is in Potter region, this place has a spring of a foothold.\u2019He had to return here to Beno castle for various reasons.Strength started to be put in Roan\u2019s steps.\u2018I\u2019m finally going to Potter region.\u2019One of the first plans that could be picked in one hand after he realized that he returned to the past.\u2018But before that\u2026\u2026\u2019He had a place to go.In the first place, his destination was a bit to the southwest.As he walked for almost a quarter of a day he saw a small village.Roan passed the entrance of the village and went to a house located under a big tree.Knock. Knock. Knock.\u201cWho are you?\u201dAfter he knocked a shabby wooden door, a really slim middle aged woman appeared after a while.Roan bowed.\u201cI\u2019m class 5 adjutant of rose troop. I was the commander of your son.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThe woman let out a low exclamation.Roan couldn\u2019t even raise his head.\u201cI couldn\u2019t rescue your son because I lack a lot. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dA visit that wasn\u2019t related to his travelling.The place he came to was Lander\u2019s hometown.\u201cSob.\u201dThe woman cried without making any sound and then wiped off the tears with the back of her hand.\u201cI\u2019m the mother of Lander.\u201dThe end of the sentence trembled.\u201cDon\u2019t bow like that.\u201dShe covered Roan\u2019s face with both of her hands and raised his head.\u201cOn the last vacation, Lander talked a lot about you. That you were a really amazing man. I was really curious as to who you were, but we get to meet like this.\u201dRoan couldn\u2019t say anything.He looked at the woman\u2019s face for a moment and then took out a small bag.\u201cThere\u2019s no way this will comfort you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need money. I already received a lot.\u201dThe woman turned back the back to Roan and shook her head.There were tears on her eyes.\u201cEven so it seems like Lander has been with some really good people. Quite a lot of people came and went from Beno castle.\u201d\u201cFrom rose troop?\u201d\u201cYes. The troop commander came, and the soldiers of the 12th squad also came saying that they were Lander\u2019s friends. Especially the soldiers of the 12th squad came every time they had the leisure to do so and helped with the farming. They are really thankful people.\u201dAt those words Roan shut his mouth.\u2018The reason they nowadays cut off the one night of free day was because of that? They really are nice people.\u2019He felt thankful towards Gale and the 12th squad.\u2018If it\u2019s these people I can be together for life.\u2019It was good to have good abilities and talent, but he also needed good people and well mannered ones.Roan grabbed the hands of the woman.\u201cLander was a really great soldier and ally. You raised a truly amazing child.\u201dAt those words the woman forcefully smiled.\u201cAs he was recognized by the adjutant he always admired, Lander will also like it. Sob.\u201dIn the end she buried her face in Roan\u2019s hands.Roan gritted his teeth at the hot tears that were felt on the back of his hand.\u2018I have to get stronger. Only then\u2026\u2026\u2019Resolution formed in his eyes.\u2018I can rescue at least one more person.\u2019The tears of the mother that lost her son hit him.His heart that was a bit scattered at the thought that he was finally going to the south was strengthened.Today at this moment, Roan felt once again.That he had many things to do.*****Roan started his real trip after he received the really kind treatment of Lander\u2019s mother.For now, he went to the fishing village Pierr that was located on Poskein lake and had quite some scale.Poskein lake.As the biggest lake in the continent, the size of it was a bit smaller than Rinse kingdom.Rinse, Istel, Dies, Aimas alliances were gathered around the lake as the center.\u2018But now they aren\u2019t able to utilize this lake properly.\u2019Roan looked at the lake that spread without end and shook his head.\u2018Now, it\u2019s only used as a place to catch fishes in a small village.\u2019It wasn\u2019t only in Rinse kingdom, but even the other kingdoms that were at the boundary left it alone.Because the lake had really big and monsters, which you didn\u2019t know the identity of, which were abundant.In the end, working as fishermen in the fishing village was everything.\u2018But even before 10 years passed, a lot of blood will be shed by the 4 kingdoms to conquer this lake.\u2019A bitter smile appeared on his face.\u2018The one that will conquest this lake is the pirate king Bek that\u2019s called, Bright Shark.\u2019He was originally from the navy of Aimas kingdom, but he made himself independent and became a pirate.He used outstanding navigation skills and strong fighting power as the background to conquer Poskein lake, and not satisfied with that he attacked many villages and towns and plundered.\u2018The navy of the four kingdoms allied themselves later to subjugate it but it was pointless.\u2019Roan let out a long sigh.\u2018I can\u2019t get Poskein lake taken by that violent guy also in this life.\u2019He planned to dominate Poskein lake faster than anyone.\u2018Poskein lake is one of the most important places for my plans.\u2019But there was a big problem.\u2018There\u2019s no proper person.\u2019Not even one person who was skilled in the navy appeared in Rinse kingdom.Even the outstanding genius strategist Ian Philips failed to find and appoint a skilled and strong marine.\u2018In this life, I will do it myself.\u2019Roan was planning to do something even Ian had failed.And his first plan for that was to travel with a ship rather than on the ground.\u2018Until now, it will be something no one had tried.\u2019Getting on a ship and traveling a long distance was something unthinkable yet.Roan was planning on finding someone that would step up and challenge something that no one had done yet.For now, he went to the village of Boodoo that was at the south of Pierr village.Big and small fishing boats and big fishermen were abundant.Roan carefully asked to the one that looked the most manly.\u201cCan you get me to Potter region?\u201dThe reply came immediately.\u201cDon\u2019t say crazy shtuff!\u201d (Not a mistake)The man turned him down and yelled.Roan smiled bitterly and looked another person.But all the fishermen showed the same reaction.\u201cYou crashy?\u201d\u201cIf your not crazy go back to the ground. That\u2019s the safhest place.\u201d\u201cYou will give me a lot of money? Kukuku. This man. If you have that much money why don\u2019t you ride a carriage?\u201d\u201cSay shit about money a bit more finely.\u201dEveryone talked sarcastically and shook their head.In serious cases, there were some that cursed while punching.\u201cYou telling me to die together!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know where a monshter will appear! If you want to die do it alone!\u201dA loud yell that made his ear numb.Even so, Roan didn\u2019t give up.He roamed around Boodoo, the market and the town for 4 days looking for someone that would carry him on their ship.But even after his persistent effort, no one stepped up.\u2018Whew. In the end do I have to go by ground?\u2019Roan sat at the boundary of Boodoo and looked at the blue lake.The lake was calm and silent.Sunlight shone on the lake.Then a small voice was heard.\u201cHey.\u201dRoan turned his head to where the sound was heard.The owner of the voice was a youth that seemed to be the same age as him.Only, his body was so slim he looked really pointy. The youth smiled awkwardly and said.\u201cAbout going to Potter region. May I do that?\u201dAt those words, Roan stood up.\u201cOf course.\u201dA really excited voice.At Roan\u2019s reaction, the expression of the youth became a bit dark.He scratched the back of his head and carefully said.\u201cBut it\u2019s only been a month since I started to sail a ship\u2026.. Do you care?\u201d\u201cOf co\u2026..\u201dThe moment he said that without thinking of anything, he stopped.\u2018One month?\u2019His sight was directed to Poskein lake.It felt that the calm lake became rough.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you donators and also readers!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Editor\u2019s Note: Happy Birthday ComradePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 50 - To the south (4)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPoskein was the biggest lake in the continent.It was obvious that you could see the horizon, and when the wind was too strong the waves were also rough.Daiv, who grew up in Pierr village, followed his fisherman father since little and lived on the lake just like it was his room.He looked at the horizon that was spread ahead of him and raised a dream.\u2018One day I will roam this lake as I wish!\u2019But even after he became a youth, that dream was still a dream.\u2018Money and soldiers. I need a ship that doesn\u2019t break even after meeting a monster and soldiers who can face those monsters.\u2019But two months ago, his father passed away.What he left him was an old and shabby house and some wealth.Daiv spent all of the wealth to repair and remodel the ship.Because of that, it became a ship that was exaggerating to call a fishing ship.\u2018But it\u2019s still lacking.\u2019The ship he was imagining was completely different to what he had right now.He needed a lot more money.\u2018One day\u2026\u2026\u2019As he was suppressing his dream like that, he discovered Roan, who was looking for a ship in a street of Boodoo, in a market.\u2018If I take him to Potter region will he give me a lot of money?\u2019Quite an interesting story.He would gain a lot more money than catching fishes at the shore.For others it would be nonsense, and something they had to put their lives on it, but for him it was an opportunity to realize his dream.On top of that he had a method to go to Potter region.\u2018It\u2019s not that I have to cross the lake.\u2019Daiv, who finished his thoughts, went to Roan.\u201cHey. About going to Potter region. May I do that?\u201d*****\u2018How peculiar.\u2019Roan looked at the ship he was on and put on a weird smile.The shape of Daiv\u2019s ship was different to what he saw until now.\u2018It feels like it\u2019s floating?\u2019What was fortunate was that the crew seemed quite experienced.Then, Daiv approached him and said with a voice with strength.\u201cI only have to take you to Potter region, right?\u201d\u201cYes. The faster it is, the better.\u201dThe reason Roan chose to travel by water wasn\u2019t simply just to conquer Poskein lake faster than anyone.\u2018I became a bit late because of Slen battle.\u2019Because of that, his plans of reaching Potter region were late.\u2018If I travel by ground, I may not be able to reach there before that accident happens.\u2019If he wanted to go there by ground he had to take a detour with an arc like direction.Compared to that, if he was to travel by lake he would be able to at least save 10 days.Roan didn\u2019t have that much time.Then, Daiv\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI\u2019m planning to move following the shore.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan exclaimed lowly.\u2018There certainly was a reason he stepped out confidently. But\u2026\u2026\u2019The method to reach Potter region in the shortest time was to cross it.But this method was too dangerous.Because the farther they got from the shore, the more monsters there would be.On the other side, if they followed the shore it was safer on the point of the attacks of the monsters, but it was difficult to sail.\u2018As the shore is shallow and the winds are too strong, if he\u2019s not a skillful person there\u2019s a high probability to crash.\u2019Roan looked at Daiv\u2019s two eyes fixedly.\u2018But a person that has only sailed a ship for one month chooses to go by the shore?\u2019Something difficult to believe.Roan said his thoughts honestly.\u201cYou sailed a ship for only a month, do you think that will be possible?\u201dAt those words Daiv smiled brightly and shook his head.\u201cIt is indeed one month since I sailed the ship myself, but it\u2019s already my tenth year that I ride one.\u201dHe looked at Roan\u2019s eyes.\u201cAnd just because my experience is short, it doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have the skills.\u201dAn overconfident voice.\u201cOn top of that, I have a secret weapon with me.\u201d\u201cA secret weapon?\u201dAs Roan asked back, Daiv smiled brightly and pointed his ship.\u201cThis guy is different than the others.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan exclaimed lowly.\u2018That\u2019s why I felt that it was floating, but there really is something different.\u2019Then, Daiv turned his head and looked at the crew.\u201cNow! Are you all ready!\u201d\u201cYes! Captain! We are all set!\u201dThe crew yelled in one voice.Daiv stood at the deck and raised his right hand after looking at Pierr village once more.\u201cFlangtek ship! Sail off!\u201d\u201cSail off!\u201dA loud yell.At the same time, the shabby ship started to move along with the sound of creaking wood.Swhooosh.Then the warm west wind blew.The wind hit the sail.Flop!The sail pushed the ship and it raised.The ship split the waters and started to move towards the south.*****Roan was standing at the stern looking at the Poskein river.\u2018Daiv.\u2019He gathered information about Daiv while sailing.\u2018He followed his father since he became 10 and grew up on the ship.\u2019As his head was bright and his body swift, he did the work of an adult person.\u2018The problem was that his thoughts were peculiar.\u2019The guy that boasted about his great number of fishes caught, started to dream of a peculiar thing.\u2018And that is moving on Poskein lake as he wished.\u2019After Daiv\u2019s father died and left him his ship, he started to act earnestly.He ripped off the ship and repaired it.As he couldn\u2019t go somewhere far from the lake immediately, he planned to make a lap following the shore.Because of that the ship became a really strange and shallow one.\u2018Anyways, all of the crew members recognize his brilliance.\u2019Roan smiled faintly.\u2018The courage of not fearing Poskein lake at all, and a dream that others hadn\u2019t thought of. On top of that outstanding skills\u2026\u2026..\u2019He would be a big help in the conquest of his plans.Roan kept looking at Daiv with interesting eyes.*****\u201cAmazing.\u201dRoan was truly amazed.He was now looking at Daiv and the crew while standing at the stren.\u201cGrab the ropes for the sail!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get pushed to the east! It\u2019s dangerous if we get far from the shore!\u201d\u201cWatchmen, don\u2019t ease your nervousness!\u201dDaiv certainly wasn\u2019t an ordinary sailor.Take into account his suitable orders and commanding abilities without flaws, but first his abilities to sail the ship were amazing.His eye to be able to read the current of the water was good and his abilities to utilize the wind was also outstanding.\u2018The words of the crew were true. Daiv is a genius.\u2019Roan, who didn\u2019t know much about ships, could clearly feel it.If it wasn\u2019t for Daiv, the ship would have already turned over or crashed.\u2018Potter region is already in front of me.\u2019While following the shore, there were several crises.The ship could have turned over because of a strong wind, and they could have gotten done in by underwater reefs.But every time, Daiv overcame it all with at the moment\u2019s wits.Most of all, the amazing thing was the ship\u2019s performance.Externally it looked shabby and old, but because of the repairs Daiv did, it showed a greater performance than what he had thought.Especially, spreading and folding the sail was so comfortable they could dexterously act according to the direction of the strength of the wind.\u2018Why couldn\u2019t someone like this show prominence?\u2019In his past life, there was no one like him.Roan pondered for a moment and then shook his head.\u2018With his temperament, there\u2019s a high chance he challenged the lake early on and died.\u2019He bit his lower lip.\u2018In this life, I will take him to the end. If he doesn\u2019t die early and is able to further his abilities, he\u2019s someone i\u2019m expecting to be able to reach the distance.\u2019Then, the yell of the watchman was heard.\u201cI can see Potter region!!\u201dRoan and Daiv had finally reached Potter region.\u201cHow was it?\u201dDaiv approached Roan and asked.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cIt was more amazing than what I had thought.\u201dDaiv just smiled.Roan took out a big bag.When he got on the ship, he had already paid him.\u2018But what is this bag?\u2019Daiv looked at Roan with a weird expression.Roan read that and smiled faintly.\u201cIt\u2019s an investment\u201d\u201cAn inversion?\u201dDaiv still had a weird expression.Roan continued saying.\u201cYes. Mister Daiv. I want to be your patron.\u201d\u201cTo a sailor like me? Just what is the reason\u2026\u2026..?\u201dRoan replied without even a trace of hesitation.\u201cThe reason I want to do it\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe paused for a moment and then smiled brightly.\u201cIt\u2019s because there\u2019s a future in Poskein lake.\u201d\u201cFu\u2026\u2026ture?\u201dDaiv couldn\u2019t understand and frowned.Roan added.\u201cThe country that dominates Poskein lake will be able to posses the water bodies of the four kingdoms.\u201dStrength was put in the voice.\u201cProbably, the commercial rights utilized in this lake will develop widely in a short time. Incredible amounts of goods will come and go with the 4 kingdoms as the center. And if there is perhaps someone that dominates Poskein lake\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe will be able to gain an incredible amount of passing rights. No, is it still lacking? You wouldn\u2019t even be able to sail a ship without permission.\u201dDaiv continued saying and opened his mouth.\u201cBut what are you going to do after I betray you? And if I act as if I don\u2019t know you even after receiving the investment?\u201dQuite a provocative question.But Roan\u2019s expression was still calm.\u201cI wonder. I will have to think of that by then. If I already start thinking about that\u2026\u2026.\u201dHis mouth raised.\u201cI can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dRoan had many things he had to do from now on.And also had many plans.Because of that, if he focused too much on a failure there was a big possibility he would be too late or wouldn\u2019t even be able to accomplish it.\u2018It\u2019s better to do several things at once taking into account the probability of failure.\u2019Even if Daiv failed or betrayed him, it didn\u2019t matter.Anyways, it\u2019s impossible to conquest Poskein lake alone.Roan was planning to find other sailors, invest in them, and make a big organization.\u2018This is no different than the first step.\u2019The light in his eyes dimmed calmly.\u2018I will slowly need a lot of money.\u2019His head spun quickly.As he ran a plan, the other one came immediately.Then, Daiv\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThose are good words. That if you have many worries in your head, you won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201dHe smiled faintly and continued saying.Meanwhile, the ship reached a small fishing port in Potter region called Tig.The west wind kept blowing,*****Spring was ending and summer approaching, but even if that was the case, it was too hot.A heat wave raised on the main road.\u201cUgh. So hot.\u201d\u201cRight? It is indeed hot.\u201dPeople gathered below a tree that was next to the road.They kept fanning with their hands without stop.Then, their sight was directed to the end of the road.\u201cThat person doesn\u2019t seem to be hot at all.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even shed a drop of sweat.\u201d\u201cIs it because he\u2019s young?\u201dThe youth who was walking at the end of the road was walking towards them.A strong body that couldn\u2019t be hidden with clothes and messy hair.The identity of the youth that gave a wild feeling was Roan.He separated with Daiv in Tig village and started to walk towards the south without stop.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t because of Brent\u2019s ring I would also be dying because of the heat.\u2019He touched the ring on his finger and let out a long sigh.Roan could bear the heat because of Brent\u2019s ring.\u201cOy! Youth! The weather is hot, come and rest for a moment! Drink some water!\u201dThe people that were resting in the shade made hand signs towards Roan.Roan moved towards them and then shook his head.\u201cI still have a long way to go.\u201dAt those words, the middle aged man with a hawk nose asked.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dRoan pointed the south.\u201cI\u2019m going to Maiel mountain.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dAt that moment, the people glanced at each other and shook their heads.The hawk nosed man let out a long sigh.\u201cWhew. If it isn\u2019t for something important don\u2019t even be around it.\u201dAt those words Roan frowned.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cRight. There is. Yes.\u201dThe hawk nosed man nodded and then said as if he was whispering.\u201cNowadays peculiar thing are happening on the mountain. Just like beasts coming down the mountain, or bugs crying like crazy and dying, and even birds hiding themselves.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dRoan\u2019s expression became severe.\u201cThat\u2019s why it will be better to be away of the mountain for now.\u201dThe hawk nosed man put a really preoccupied face.Roan slightly bowed.\u201cThanks for worrying.\u201dHe also put on a worried face just like the other people.But he was a bit hurried inwardly.\u2018It\u2019s already starting.\u2019Roan looked towards the south.\u2018I have to hurry a bit more.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Editor\u2019s Note: Happy Birthday ComradePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even so, aren\u2019t we also supposed to be far from it?\u201d\u201cEy. Why take it to that? There\u2019s nothing different aside from the beasts having hidden themselves. People will also return soon.\u201d\u201cAhem. Well, that\u2019s true. But even so I can\u2019t do anything about feeling like this.\u201dAs two old men conversed, they sighed.It has already been 15 days since strange things have happened in the mountain.Meanwhile, most of the villagers momentarily escaped to other regions because of their uneasiness.Because of that, the only restaurant and bar in the village, called Fran Restaurant, has been empty for a couple of days already.Then, an unfamiliar stranger appeared from the open door.It was a youth that emanated a wild aura and had a childish face.It was Roan.\u2018Whew. At least it doesn\u2019t seem like i\u2019m late.\u2019He put down the bag he was carrying and let out a long sigh.He would be able to reach his destination before that thing happened because of his constant walking.He stood in front of the counter and looked for the owner.One of the old men who was conversing approached.\u201cYou lookin fo\u2019 somethin?\u201d (E/N: I\u2019m pretty sure this is on purpose)\u201cYes. Water, bread and dried meat.\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201dRoan made some calculations and then said.\u201cGive me a small barrel of water, two days worth of bread, and ten for the dried meat.\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dThe old man folded his fingers and then went into the inner part of the kitchen.After a while, the old man came out while holding some things.Roan put the additional luggage in his big bag.\u201cYou travellin?\u201dThe man that was looking at the sides asked.Roan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cYes. I\u2019m checking what\u2019s happening on the south.\u201d\u201cWorking so hard when it\u2019s this hot. But\u2026..\u201dThe old man said in a whispering voice.\u201cIf you can, avoid going to Maiel mountain. Some strange things has been happening over there\u2026.. Ahem. Anyways, take care.\u201d\u201cThank you for worrying.\u201dRoan bowed deeply and grabbed his bag again.The heavy feeling was felt on all of his shoulders.\u2018With this much the food will be enough\u2026\u2026Now, should I go to the mountain?\u2019After he greeted the old men, he got out of the restaurant.The sun shone down strongly, but because of Brent\u2019s ring he didn\u2019t feel the heat at all.\u2018The place I remember needs to be exact.\u2019Roan searched through his memories and continued walking.The memory of a person was a really scary thing.You wouldn\u2019t know if you didn\u2019t remember at all, but thinking that he remembered clearly could be gravely mistaken.\u2018If my memories are wrong\u2026\u2026..\u2019Aside from not being able to get what he wanted, he may lose his life.But this was one of the most important things that was in his plans.\u2018The fire monarch Reid. I must obtain his impaired mana technique.\u2019*****Roan set up camp on the entrance of the mountain.He had left some distance while not being too far either.He had placed a piece of cloth as the roof and decided to lodge here.\u2018Is it already the fourth day since I camped here? It should slowly start\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan chewed on the dried meat and looked towards Maiel mountain.A mountain where the sound of birds and insects couldn\u2019t be heard.Because of that, it emanated a gloomy feeling.\u2018It should be time for Viscount Potter to send someone to report that Maiel mountain is strange.\u2019He didn\u2019t remember the exact date, but it was something that had clearly happened in his past life.\u2018Now! Maiel mountain, wide grounds. Tremble quickly. Quickly\u2019He put strength in his eyes.The speed of chewing the dried meat became faster.But nothing happened in the mountain.\u2018Will today also pass like this?\u2019Roan looked at the western sky where the sun was already setting, and let out a long sigh.It was then.Pruu.The sunset slightly shook along the skyline.\u2018Huh?\u2019Roan opened his two eyes widely.The sunset had clearly shaken.\u2018No, I\u2019m the one shaking.\u2019He got down on the floor after he grabbed the ground with his two arms.Kugugugugugu.The earth was crying.And soon, the mountain and the plains trembled like they were dancing.Kugung. Kugugugung. Kugung.The rocks that were on the hillside crumbled down and the trees of the forests trembled to the sides and started to fall.Kugung.The cloth roof fell and the food rolled onto the ground.\u2018It\u2019s here! The earthquake is finally here!\u2019That thing he wanted to happen that much.Roan was waiting just for this earthquake.He looked at Maiel mountain while still lying on the ground.He could see the landslide sweeping the mountain.\u2018My memory isn\u2019t that wrong.\u2019Fortunately, the landslide fell down, avoiding the place where he was at.Kugugugung.The surface of the earth started to split with a weird sound.Some places surged up, and some sunk down, and holes appeared.What was fortunate was that the holes weren\u2019t deep enough to put him in danger.Roan still glared at Maiel mountain while on the ground.\u2018One day for the earthquake to end and for the aftershock to come. Meanwhile, I have to locate the cave where the sleeping fire monarch is.\u2019After the landslide happened because of the earthquake, the hidden caves will appear.And in that place, there is the mana technique of the sleeping fire monarch, Reid.\u2018After the aftershock happens, rocks will cover that place. Because of that, one of the two volumes for the mana technique ends up being destroyed.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip tightly.\u2018In my past life, Viscount Potter obtained quite a fine first volume\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He suffered an attack from Duke Voiza, who got the news before he could learn it or he got taken by the kingdom, and lost his life.\u2018And Duke Voiza gave that mana technique to his son. Although it had only half the volume, that guy\u2026\u2026.\u2019He became one of the strongest guys in Rinse kingdom.\u2018The problem was that he betrayed the kingdom and he escaped to Estia Kingdom.\u2019Roan ground his teeth.Because he remembered the fierce and cruel war that happened because of him.\u2018Anyways, it\u2019s a clear truth that he became incredibly strong just with half of the volume.\u2019Flames appeared in his eyes.\u2018But today, I\u2019m not getting only half of it, but the complete technique.\u2019His chest beat.His eyes were fixed on a mountain hillside.\u2018There, or there. Somewhere should be the fire monarch.\u2019Kugugugung.Maiel mountain trembled roughly just like it was making the last movements.A weird sound was spread far away through the wind.And that was just like the sound of announcing a historical fomentation.As soon as the earthquake stopped, Roan started to climb the mountain.His face was filled with confidence.\u2018For now, everything I remembered is correct.\u2019As a result, there was a high probability for the location of the cave to be the same as his memories.\u2018Right. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s wrong.\u2019The scandal that shook not only Rinse kingdom, but the entire continent.The scandal that made Estia Kingdom, which was the homeland of the fire monarch, increases Rinse kingdom\u2019s status as its first enemy country.It was something impossible for Roan, who was a soldier of Rinse Kingdom.\u2018It certainly was discovered at the southwestern part.\u2019Roan searched through his memories and searched many hillsides.His hands, clothes, face and hair became a mess with dirt.Because of the shape of the ground, it wasn\u2019t even easy to walk.\u201cWhew.\u201dEven so, Roan didn\u2019t rest.No, he rather moved even quicker.Those tenacious steps crossed the mountain.And finally, it was when he reached a valley after he passed a big rock.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.There was a cave on a cliff in the valley.\u2018It\u2019s there. I\u2019m certain it is.\u2019Roan instinctively knew.Although it was a scene that wasn\u2019t in his memories, his entire body reacted strongly.\u2018There\u2019s the mana technique of the fire monarch Reid.\u2019Roan started to climb the valley with a half absent minded face.He jumped off and dirt and rocks fell over his head, but he never stopped.And finally he arrived in front of the cave in the Potter region that he longed for so much.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh and moved inside the cave.His heart was beating fast and his ears went numb.A mana technique he hadn\u2019t even thought of learning in his past life.But in this life he would be able to learn the mana technique of one of the strongest person in the world titledthe fire monarch Reid.That chance was right in front of him.Footsteps filled the entire cave.How long had he walked?Roan, who was walking with strength, abruptly stopped.A skeleton was sitting at a side of the cave while leaning on it.\u2018Fire monarch Reid.\u2019It was certainly him.Between the torn and disintegrated clothes, three books with a red cover were in it.Everything had dust and dirt covering it, but only the three books maintained a perfect state.\u2018Why is it three books?\u2019Reid mana technique was certainly a book divided in two volumes.The truth of a third volume existing was something that wasn\u2019t in his memories.Roan slowly approached and carefully grabbed the books.The big letters engraved in the red cover sharply pierced his eyes.This was the mana technique the fire monarch used.And it was certainly composed of two volumes.\u2018Then this\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan looked at the third and final book.(It says boxing, but a bit weird for the time)\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out.\u2018There was also the art of fighting of the monarch in this place.\u2019He had a thought.\u2018Would the soldiers of Viscount Potter also have discovered this book in my past life? Or did it also get destroyed along the second volume?\u2019He couldn\u2019t know the answer.But even until the day Roan died, no one that mastered the monarch\u2019s art of fighting appeared.\u2018In the end, did this also get buried in the ground?\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018Anyways, it will become of great help to me.\u2019A harvest he hadn\u2019t expected.He calmed down his excited heart and stored away the three books in his bag.\u2018Is this the real start?\u2019Roan tightly bit his lower lip.From now on it was time to experience things he hadn\u2019t in his past life.\u2018Mana training.\u2019He took in a deep breath.\u2018But now I have to leave the mountain before the soldiers of the viscount come.\u2019But he wasn\u2019t planning to move far away.He was planning to study the mana technique in a secluded place.No, precisely speaking.\u2018It would be feeling the mana.\u2019Roan hit his chest.\u2018If Reid was the fire monarch\u2026\u2026.\u2019His mouth rose.\u2018Am I the fire spear king?\u2019But then, he shook his head.His eyes shone.\u2018Fire monarch.\u2019Roan clenched his teeth.\u2018I will become the fire monarch.\u2019Then, he saw the laid down skeleton of Reid.\u2018Ah! When the aftershock ends tomorrow, the soldiers of Viscount Potter will come to investigate.\u2019Then, a really bad thing happens to the skeleton.The soldiers break it to pieces saying that they would take it away.\u2018I can\u2019 let that happen in this life.\u2019Roan took out the cloth used to make a roof and carefully stored away the skeleton.He concentrated to see if he had missed any small pieces.\u201cHuh?\u201dThen, something grabbed his attention.A silver semicircle object the size of a nail.That was below Reid\u2019s right hand.In the end of the pondering, Roan extended his fingers.Tuk.The thing he thought would be hard, was really squishy.\u201cAh!\u201dRoan instinctively yelled with a surprised expression.Because an incredible chill was felt from the tip of his fingers.At the same time the semicircle object that was on the ground disappeared like something washed it away.\u201cHuh?\u201dRoan looked everywhere for it but he couldn\u2019t find it.\u2018It didn\u2019t get absorbed by my finger, right?\u2019He looked at his finger and then frowned.Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with his body.\u2018I feel weird for nothing.\u2019He smacked his lips and after searching the cave once more he shook his head.\u2018Well, it won\u2019t be anything.\u2019He erased his uneasiness and then carefully raised the delicately packed skeleton.Then.Kurururu.His feet trembled.\u201cHuh?\u201dRoan frowned and looked inside the cave.\u2018Aftershock?!\u2019Something he hadn\u2019t expected at all.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t the aftershock start tomorrow?\u2019The source of the calamity was that he had dropped his guard because everything happened just like memories.He looked at the entrance of the cave.Kugugugu.The tremor and the sound worsened.Tududuk. Tuduk. Tuk.Rocks fell on the entrance of the cave.\u201cNo!\u201dIf the entrance got blocked it would be hard to leave.Roan hurriedly charged forward and threw himself.However.Bang! Baaang!An amazing sound exploded.At the same time, the open entrance crumbled.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan stood at the tightly blocked entrance and let out a low exclamation.His memories of his past life.Everything was right until now except for one thing.The time when the aftershock happened.Because of that he ended up being trapped inside the cave.Roan\u2019s mouth twisted.\u201cDamn it!\u201dHe cursed unconsciously.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Editor\u2019s Note: Happy Birthday ComradePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But\u2026\u2026..\u2019By then, soldiers of Viscount Potter would be located at every place on the mountain.\u2018They wouldn\u2019t just send out a person that came out of a cave like that.\u2019If he was unfortunate, not even losing the books would be enough, he would even have his neck cut off to prevent rumours spreading.\u201cDamn.\u201dRoan threw away a pebble that he was holding.He wouldn\u2019t be able to clear the rocks from the entrance like this.\u2018I have to find a method to get out.\u2019That was the way to live.Roan stood up and moved towards the opposite side of the entrance, to the deeper parts of the cave.But as it got more narrow, a completely different space appeared.\u201cIt was completely blocked off.\u201dRoan then returned to the entrance.He saw the worn cloth that had wrapped Reid\u2019s skeleton.\u2018This is all because of you sir. Why are you here from all the many plac\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan, that was grumbling, frowned and tilted his head.\u2018Now that I think of it, what\u2019s the reason for the fire monarch to have come all the way here?\u2019Reid was a duke of the defeated kingdom of Estia and the head of the strong powerhouse \u2018Flame\u2019 50 years ago.But what could be the reason that that kind of person came to die in the southern region of Rinse kingdom and in a small and secluded cave that was on a mountain like Maiel mountain?Roan slowly looked through his memories.He was searching for Reid\u2019s whereabouts from his countless memories.And the most convincing rumour of them.\u2018He battled against the goddess of water Biate and the both of them ended up wounded without gaining anything.\u2019Biate was also one of the strongest that could be counted on one hand who shook the continent.Especially because she was the first human, and the strongest messenger, who made a contract with the water spirit king Elaim.Reid, who used the force of fire, didn\u2019t like Biate who used the force of water at all.\u2018Fire and water. They wanted to see who was stronger through the battle.\u2019But Biate, who distanced herself from battles and wars kept declining the duel request countless times and hid herself.\u2018But if the rumours are true\u2026..\u2019Roan looked at the cave slowly.\u2018This cave may somehow be related to miss Biate.\u2019But there was nothing worth anything here to be called a trace in this small cave.\u2018Maybe\u2026..?\u2019Then, Roan pulled out his bag and took out the three books Reid had left.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t he have left something when he died here?\u2019He carefully spread the first volume of the Flamdor mana book and cautiously checked if there was anything related to Reid\u2019s death.The sound of pages being flipped through filled the cave.And when he passed the last one, Roan\u2019s two eyes turned big.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dA low exclamation.There was something.The content that Roan was looking for was on the last page.His eyes moved sideways quickly.He started by announcing that he didn\u2019t have much to live.His heart beat quickly.\u2018The rumours were true!\u2019The reason the fire monarch Reid and the water Godess Biate who disappeared approximately at the same time 50 years ago was because of their duel, no, because of the life and death battle.Roan hurriedly checked the following content.The handwriting became dimmer and shook.The letter was finally showing its end.Roan moved his sight away with the last sentence.These were words that he didn\u2019t know the meaning of.However, the important thing wasn\u2019t the last sentence.\u2018This place is the entrance to get inside miss Biate\u2019s dwelling place.\u2019His sight moved inside.\u2018But it means that the tight space is the entrance\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018He said that only the fated one would be able to get in.\u2019But he didn\u2019t have any relationships with Biate.But even so, he couldn\u2019t just stand still and waste time.\u2018Anyways, there\u2019s a place beyond that wall for me to hide.\u2019Roan put the book away and held his bag.And he carefully embraced the cloth with the skeleton.Step. Step.Footsteps was heard inside the cave.Roan stood in front of the wall once more.\u2018There has to be some kind of secret device.\u2019He kept checking the wall up and down, and to the sides.However he couldn\u2019t see any special traces even after having checked everywhere.\u2018Then, next\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan extended his right arm and put it on the top right.The tips of his fingers moved to the end of the walls.He wasn\u2019t hurried.He carefully checked the wall while putting all of his concentration at the tip of his fingers.Then, Roan\u2019s finger reached in a middle part.\u201cAh!\u201dA surprised voice and expression came out.Roan moved his hand away from the wall and looked at his finger.\u2018I suddenly feel an incredible chill\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019A familiar feeling.\u2018Ah! The silver semi-circular object that was on the floo\u2026\u2026.\u2019When he was thinking like that.A small change occurred on the stone wall.A silver water drop appeared in the place where he took his fingers off.\u201cHuh?\u201dHis eyes turned big.\u2018This is the same as the silver object from before?\u2019Roan fixed his sight on the wall.Pat.Then, the water drop that surged out took the shape of a wheel.And after that it started to spin.Guguguguk.At the same time, the sound of rock and sand grinding was heard.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.The stone wall that was blocked without even having a bit of space, started to open to the sides little by little.Boom.An entrance appeared along with a heavy sound.Roan didn\u2019t hesitate.He moved inside the door.Guguguguk.The stone wall turned to its original place once again and perfectly blocked the cave.The silver wheel that was spinning once more hid itself in the wall.A perfect darkness and silence.Nothing could be felt inside the cave anymore.******Roan was half absent-minded.He couldn\u2019t believe the scene that was spread out in front of him.A huge space that was spread out in a small cave.\u2018Is Maiel mountain completely empty inside?\u2019To the point he thought that.However, seeing that mines were being developed in many places, this scene was difficult to understand.\u2018Just piercing through a little bit seems like this region would appear.\u2019Roan tilted his head and then went down the stairs.\u2018It certainly is miss Biate\u2019s space, whoever sees it would think this.\u2019It was to the point he thought Biate? Even when he didn\u2019t have previous information.In the huge place, water streams were flowing from east to west and north to south, and in the place the two rivers met, there was quite a large pond.The surprising thing was that on one side of the wall, a huge waterfall was falling.\u2018I certainly can\u2019t hear a thing when this much water is splashing.\u2019It was a feeling that his eyesight and hearing senses turned bad.Roan evaded the many small and big ponds that were at various places and went to the place where many books were piled up.A huge table.And the books that were spread everywhere.\u2018So this is the place where miss Biate battled against sir Reid.\u2019Taking that into account, the place was too neat.The two of them were the strongest in the continent.They wouldn\u2019t have fought like normal soldiers.\u2018There should also be some secret in here.\u2019Roan started to thoroughly check the books that were spread around in a sloppy way.\u2018Sir Reid also left a letter while dying. Miss Biate wouldn\u2019t have left something like that.\u2019They were historical figures even when they were alive.He thought that there would be no way those kind of people left the world without even leaving a last mark.Especially if it was the beautiful and ladylike Biate that was beautiful to the point she was called as a goddess.His hand, that was moving on the table, stopped.A shallow book reached his fingers.Because of the many books covering it he could only see the last words.As Roan pulled that book, the other books tumbled down.\u2018Certainly!\u2019Roan put on a faint smile after checking the contents of the book.It seemed that he had found what he wanted.The following content was just like what Reid had left behind.But the only difference was that it wasn\u2019t Reid, but Biate.However at the end, a completely different story was written.\u2018Huh? The essence of the water?\u2019Roan frowned.He remembered the silver waterdrop that was absorbed by his fingers.\u2018That\u2019s the essence of the water? But why was it on the floor?\u2019He didn\u2019t know.Roan continued to read through the letter.These were difficult words to understand.Different than Reid\u2019s words, that were frank and concise, Biate\u2019s words were entirely gentle and significative.Even so, the last word was quite frank.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh and covered the book.He sat in the chair and fell into his thoughts.\u2018For now I can understand why this place is unbelievably big and strange\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019It has already been 200 years since dragons disappeared.But the stories about them kept being passed along without missing anything.And the dragon lair was the same.A lair was a place humans couldn\u2019t get in as they wished or make a dent with their strength.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018Duke Voisa, who took away the Flamdor mana technique from Viscount Potter couldn\u2019t have not seen the words sir Reid left.\u2019He slowly started to remember.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out.\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened. I wondered why Duke Voisa was interested in developing Poskein lake\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA feeling the puzzles in his head fell into place.\u2018Duke Voisa would have done everything to try to enter this place. But as he couldn\u2019t enter at all, he must have turned his attention to the lake.\u2019He thought that Biate would also have left something like Reid while dying.But even so, if he moved that openly then flies could gather.\u2018That\u2019s why he suddenly came out with developing the lake.\u2019But even so, he wouldn\u2019t have received the results that he wanted.Rather, because of Duke Voisa\u2019s movements, the other three countries jumped in on the development of the lake competitively.\u2018And on that process, the pirate king Beck app\u2026\u2026\u2019When he thought up to that.Bang.Roan abruptly stood up.The chair fell and rolled on the ground but he didn\u2019t care.He yelled in a loud voice as if he was possessed.\u201cBeck! So that bastard found the piece of miss Biate!\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or a bad thing?\u2019He couldn\u2019t know yet.However the really certain thing was that only Roan had this information and the pieces of the puzzle in his hand.\u2018Is it a monopoly for now?\u2019His mouth raised slightly.The Flamdor mana technique, Reid battling skills and continued by the lair of blue dragon Berr and the hidden artifact of Biate.All these things became his.\u201cAnyways\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan looked at the tip of his fingers.The silver waterdrop.\u2018Is that really the essence of water?\u2019He searched on the other books Biate had left but in the end he gave up.The contents were really varied and there were a lot of books, so finding the information he wanted immediately was close to impossible.\u2018I would be able to do it if I do it slowly.\u2019Anyways, he had to stay here for quite a while.\u2018At least one month\u2026\u2026\u2018By then the knight and the soldiers of Viscount Potter, who were searching the mountain, would all have gone back.Roan looked at his bag.\u2018By then, let\u2019s learn the Flamdor mana technique.\u2019He couldn\u2019t waste even a day.He was planning to train in mana in this place.But unfortunately, Roan had overlooked about one truth.That this was the lair of the blue dragon and it was filled with water energy.*****Roan thought seriously.\u2018Aren\u2019t I a genius?\u2019The reason he thought like this.\u2018I felt mana in only one day.\u2019He sat and took a posture just like the book told him to and then he breathed and concentrated.Meaningless repetition of inhaling and exhaling.Even so, his concentration didn\u2019t scatter.\u2018Even Pierce, who was called a genius, took two days to feel mana.\u2019He threw away the uneasy feeling.But exactly one day.Something soft came in along the breath.\u2018Mana!\u2019At the new and surprising feeling, his concentration scattered, and the mana he sensed that was like a thread disappeared instantly.But he was certain that it was the mana he saw in books or dreams.Roan took a posture again and sat.When he repeated breathing twice more.He once again felt something soft.But it was only up to there.\u2018I certainly can feel mana.\u2019The energy that flowed through his skin.The energy that entered his body through the nose and mouth.He clearly felt the thing called mana.\u2018But why doesn\u2019t it pile up on my body?\u2019But this hateful mana just went sightseeing in his body and fled again to the outside world.The mana hole that was the size of a fingernail and was in his lower stomach was still empty.\u2018Let\u2019s concentrate. Concentrate.\u2019Roan fixed his posture and continued to pull mana towards his body.The mana spun around in his chest and abdomen.But that bastard escaped again to the outside world with the exhaling.That thing repeated nine times.\u201cEven if this is wrong it\u2019s seriously wrong\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a long sigh and shook his head.There was exhaustion on his face.He wasn\u2019t tired physically, but mentally.\u2018Am I understanding the technique wrong?\u2019He spread the first volume of the book.But however times he read and reviewed it, he didn\u2019t find any wrong points.No, rather, the wrong point was in the mana.\u2018I just have to pile up the mana itself inside my body. As I only pile up the separated fire essence\u2026\u2026\u2019Originally, the thing called mana was an energy which all the attributes were gathered together.On top of that, they were fiercely free and liked to scatter.Because of that the normal process was that of pulling mana inside your body and accumulating it.But in the Flamdor technique, in the accumulation process, the fire essence was separated from the mana inside the body, and after separating the other essences the remaining energies went outside the body again.And only the remaining fire essence was accumulated in the mana hole.\u2018Normal mana techniques are different in each situation, but most are non attributed. However the Flamdor technique shows a pure fire attribute to the point it\u2019s an extremity.\u2019Reid used this mana technique that utilized only one essence to the extreme and became the strongest human.\u2018But why can\u2019t I separate the mana? It just feels like there was no fire essence from the start\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan, who was shaking his head, stopped and opened his eyes widely.His sight was directed to a side of the wall.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dA low exclamation.He saw the waterfall falling non stop.\u201cYou stupid.\u201dRoan hit his dull head once and then shook his head.\u2018In the last words miss Biate left it was certainly written. That because this place was the lair of blue dragon Berr, it\u2019s filled with water essence.\u2019He tried to accumulate fire essence in a place like this.\u2018The fire essence in this place would be really scarce.\u2019When he thought that, there was another thing that worried him.Roan spread his hand.\u2018If the silver waterdrop that got absorbed in my finger is really the essence of water, won\u2019t I have problems in mastering the Flamdor technique?\u2019However he had never felt any changes in his body or felt weird.He let out a long sigh.\u2018Did I get stuck from the start?\u2019Even so, he didn\u2019t give up.\u2018However much there is the essence of water, there couldn\u2019t not be the essence of fire.\u2019After training and training the technique he would at least be able to separate a grain sized essence.Roan opened the spread book and pushed it to the sides.\u2018Huh? Now that I see\u2026..\u2019Then, the thought that passes through his head suddenly.\u2018Didn\u2019t mister Reid fight in a place like this with miss Biate and reach a stalemate?\u2019This place was really filled with water essence.It was the worst place for Reid, who utilized the essence of fire.But even so the result was a stalemate.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018Mister Reid was certainly a lot stronger than miss Biate.\u2019At least in strength.His affection and interest in the Flamdor mana technique became even bigger.He fixed his posture and closed his eyes.\u2018Let\u2019s concentrate.\u2019Anyways, he didn\u2019t have anything to do for one month.Roan slowly took in a breath and pulled mana in his body.The continued process of separation and accumulation.But the process was of course a failure.However he didn\u2019t give up.And didn\u2019t even falter.Roan kept concentrating on the technique while seated.*****The wide space was sickly quiet.Roan was seated on a place where water splashed without sound.He was firmly seated on the ground.A peaceful face.His chest and abdomen that heaved up.It felt just like time had stopped.Then.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh and slowly opened his eyes.A faint smile appeared.\u201cFinally success.\u201dTrembling voice.\u2018I finally separated the essence of fire and accumulated it in the mana hole.\u2019It has been twenty days since he first sensed mana.Although it was only the size of a grain, he was satisfied.No, he was shuddering.\u2018I, I can also use mana.\u2019He wanted to stand up immediately and yell.However Roan pressed down those feelings.\u2018I don\u2019t want to let go of this feeling.\u2019He realized that it was possible to accumulate fire essence in this place filled with water essence.Roan didn\u2019t want to let go of this feeling of having separated the mana and accumulating fire essence.He closed his eyes once again.\u2018If ten days pass, it becomes one month. It\u2019s time to slowly get out of here.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018If I get outside I will light a fire first. So that it gets filled with fire essence.\u2019Mana moved inside his body along the inhaling.He slowly moved the mana inside his body.Time flowed and kept flowing like that.*****Roan stood up and looked at Brent\u2019s ring.\u2018Although the mana is the size of a coin\u2026\u2026\u2019Even so, he thought that he would be able to use one of the abilities of the ring that were asleep.In his face, expectation he couldn\u2019t hide, appeared.Roan softly clenched his fists and walked to the front.He injected mana into the ring.As the mana road was still narrow and the operation was rough it took quite a long time.Then.Pat.Light shined from the ring and after that a ball of light the size of two fists, no, a light marble appeared.\u2018So this is light magic. It\u2019s still small and\u2026\u2026.\u2019When he thought up to then.Pat.The light marble disappeared without a trace.At the same time, the coin sized mana in his mana hole also disappeared without a trace.He spent all his mana on just calling a light marble.\u2018I still shouldn\u2019t say that I know how to use mana.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and operated the Flamdor mana technique while seated.The mana that was spent didn\u2019t mean that it disappeared.The mana that was outside his body would slowly gather to the original place.Roan utilized the mana technique to gather the mana a little bit faster.He still had one more thing to do.After a while, Roan let out a long sigh and stood up.The coin sized mana was once again filled up.He grabbed the metal stick on his waist.\u2018Travias spear.\u2019The guy that needed mana to show itself.\u2018It will still be difficult to see its real shape\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan grabbed the stick with his right hand and sent mana to it.He didn\u2019t twist it like he was washing clothes with both of his hands anymore.Click.The sound of gears turning.Cheeng.At the same time, a clear sound of metal and a sharp blade surged up.The stick was entirely sharp, excluding a small part.Until now, it was what he had seen several times.Roan kept on inserting his remaining mana.Chang!A pleasing sound.At the same time, the metal stick surged up and the blade started to get a bit longer.The stick that was originally smaller than the arm of an adult now was similar to a long sword.Because of that, the part it that seemed like the blade of a sword also seemed like the blade of a spear.\u201cAh!\u201dThen, a low exclamation came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.The mana had all been spent up.Chang!At the same time, the spear returned to its original length.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan sighed with a regrettable face.\u2018It certainly is difficult to see the real shape of the spear.\u2019Travias spear.According to the amount of mana inserted, the length of the blade and the body and the thickness of it could be controlled as he wished.On top of that, as it was made with refined gold dinyum by a dragon, the consumption of mana wasn\u2019t that big.\u2018Wait a little bit more. I will soon let you smell the battlefield.\u2019Roan smacked his lips and twisted his hands again.Cheng.The blade hid itself and it became a stick again.Roan placed the spear on his waist and moved towards the desks.\u2018Should I get out now?\u2019It had already been a month since he entered here.It was time for the knight and the soldiers to return back.Roan put the books and the skeleton in his bag and chose some gems that were piled up on a place and stored them away.\u2018It\u2019s the lair of dragon\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Just like the words Biate left behind, the amount of the gems or gold wasn\u2019t that much.At least two bags.But of course even with that much was something normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to touch their entire lives, but Roan who had to do many big things from now on was really lacking.Even so, he didn\u2019t feel regret at all.\u2018Anyways, I can earn plenty of money through operating mana crystal mines and gem mines.\u2019Rather, because of this amount, he became able to make an investment in each field a little bit faster.Roan piled up the remaining objects well and raised his bag.Anyways, there was no one in this life that knew of this place.On top of that, even if they did know, they weren\u2019t able to enter as they wished.\u2018There\u2019s nowhere safer than here.\u2019He looked around and then moved towards the entrance.\u2018It\u2019s a bit regrettable that I couldn\u2019t identify the silver waterdrop\u2026\u2026.\u2019He had thoroughly searched the books while training, but he couldn\u2019t discover anything related to it.\u2018Well, it\u2019s not a problem yet.\u2019Regardless of his worries, he could also learn the Flamdor technique.For now he was planning to cover it.Roan stood in the entrance and took in a long breath.\u2018Thank you for the past month. Stay well until I return.\u2019The place that saved him.The place he would be born anew.He couldn\u2019t do anything about the special affection he felt.Roan looked around for a while and then extended his hand towards the door.Just like the last time, as he placed his finger in the middle, a chill was felt.At the same time, the silver waterdrop appeared over the stone wall.It changed to become a wheel and started to spin.Guguguguu.The wall was pushed to the sides along the sound of stone and sand grinding.Roan moved without hesitation just like before.Gugugugu.The stone wall closed back like it had been waiting.In the place Roan left, a heavy silence fell.Then, a strange sound that wasn\u2019t heard until now rang out in the place.Chwaaaa.And that was the sound of the waterfall.At the same time, the waterfall that was flowing on the fall, split to the sides.And from between it, a beautiful lady appeared.Blue hair, transparent skin that made your eyes hurt.She, who was wearing a white dress, was barefoot but it didn\u2019t have any meaning.Because she was floating just like a cloud.The lady looked at the entrance from where Roan left just now and had a weird expression.And that was an expression intersecting expectation, sadness and regret.\u201cFor the kid that absorbed my tear to learn the Flamdor mana technique.\u201dThe voice that melts softly.Around the lady, blue light gathered like a stream of water.She hesitated for a moment and then went back to the waterfall again.\u201cIs this a good thing or a bad thing\u2026 Oh Biate, I still can\u2019t understand your meaning.\u201dThe lady that called Biate, who was dead for tens of years, like a friend.Her last words filled the cave that had no one in it.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is the hottest place in the kingdom.\u2019He thought that being hot was similar to the essence of fire resembling the essence of the sun.Roan dug into the ground in a place that didn\u2019t have many humans and then placed the skeleton in it.After he piled up some dirt over it, he placed wood and grass on it.\u2018This is everything I can do for you.\u2019He used a flint and set it on fire.The dried logs and grass instantly lit on fire.\u2018If my understanding in the Flamdor mana technique was deep I would have been able to create fire with just the flick of my fingers.\u2019Roan looked at the fire and sat down.He was trying to operate the mana technique in a place other than Biate\u2019s place.As he started to breathe, the mana started to flow inside his body.The amount of mana compared to the place of Biate certainly fell behind.But.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019An incredible heat covered his body.\u2018Hot.\u2019In the mana spinning in his body, there was abundant fire essence.An amount of essence that couldn\u2019t be compared until now was separated.The essence of fire violently flowed following the mana road.Roan kept breathing and accumulated the essence of fire in his mana hole.The mana hole that was the size of a coin started to swell up and then it became the size of half a fist.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh and slowly opened his eyes.The fire that was burning had lost strength and was dying.\u2018Is it because I absorbed the fire essence?\u2019Roan smirked and stood up.He wanted to keep training in the mana by setting all of this place on fire.However, operating the mana technique in this empty place was quite a dangerous thing.\u2018Anyways, it\u2019s certainly more effective than the lair of the blue dragon.\u2019He was happy and satisfied with just that.Roan placed some more grass and logs on the dying fire and bowed.\u2018I will write a new history with the mana technique and the brawling techniques you had left.\u2019Roan said his thanks and his last words and then started to move.The bright flame danced like it was saying it\u2019s farewell.******Roan moved towards the north.But this time, he didn\u2019t use a ship but went by ground.His objective was the capital of Miller.\u2018I have to meet with mister Chris.\u2019The reason why he was looking for in the middle of returning to the troop.\u2018My memories about battles, war, strategies and things related to army of the kingdom are clear but\u2026\u2026.\u2019There weren\u2019t many things he could trust in aside of those things.Especially, it was all the more so about merchants and commercial rights.\u2018About when I died, goldmaster Seil was monopolizing everything.\u2019Because of that, he didn\u2019t have many memories about merchants.\u2018I need a safe information importing in for the future.\u2019Because of that he had to raise a young merchant and business.But however he found in his memories, that there was no one suitable for investment.\u2018If there\u2019s none in my memories, I will have to find them myself.\u2019Roan was planning to ask that to Chris.\u2018There\u2019s nowhere like Miller with had an abundance of people.\u2019There would certainly be many young merchants that became discouraged and broken because of the clash with reality.He had to pick the ones with talent and had a future amongst them.\u2018If it\u2019s mister Chris he will be able to do it.\u2019Chris bit his lower lip.His steps started to become faster.Because he walked constantly, he reached to the capital in a shorter time than he thought.Even in his past life, he had only visited the capital 10 times.It was a place that wasn\u2019t that related to him.\u2018But in this life it\u2019s different.\u2019To reach a higher place he could only get closer to the capital.Fortunately, he could pass the inspection at the entrance faster than anyone.Because he was a class 5 adjutant from the kingdom.Roan soon went to Lisa street.The street had Chris told him to come to when he came.\u201cNow! There are fruits imported from the south!\u201d\u201cThere are medicinal herbs taken from Grein mountain! And also medicinal waters taken from Mas river!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s good quality paper! And also good quality ink!\u201d\u201cLook at the wheat of Peidan\u2019s plain!\u201dNoisy sounds.There were hundreds of small and big stalls at the sides, with tens of varieties.\u2018Certainly, rather than a high class shopping district, there\u2019s a more human smell in Lisa district.\u2019There was nowhere like this place in Miller.But of course, this was Roan\u2019s personal taste.He asked about Chris\u2019s whereabouts to the people that came and went.\u2018Oh. He already opened his travel agency.\u2019Roan was truly happy.\u2018I won\u2019t be able to go in empty handed.\u2019He went to a nearby fruit store.\u201cOh! Welcome! What fruit may I give you? Nowadays, the strawberries are really sweet.\u201dRoan ate one strawberry that the owner gave him and nodded.\u201cGive me one basket of it.\u201d\u201cOh! Thank you!\u201dThe owner placed the strawberries on a wide leaf and started to roll it.Roan started to walk after he finished his business.\u201cThey said it was around here\u2026\u2026\u201dHe stopped walking and looked at the sides.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dA low exclamation came out that instant.\u2018However shabby it is, it is too much.\u2019A really worn out building compared to the others.He saw a small signboard in front of him.\u2018This is the right place.\u2019Roan fixed his clothes and then opened the door.\u201cWelcome!\u201dA loud voice.A familiar voice was heard.Chris, who was studying a book in the small place, stood up.\u201cWhat may I help\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe was greeting him while walking towards Roan and then, he froze when he saw him.Roan smiled faintly and slightly bowed.\u201cHello mister Chris. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cSi, sir adjutant Roan?\u201dChris fumbled with a surprised expression.Roan smiled brightly and lent the strawberries he had in his hands.\u201cWant to eat strawberries together?\u201d******Bang!Rock scraps flew along with a loud noise.\u201cSir viscount! I already told you, you can\u2019t break the stone pillars!\u201dThe young soldiers yelled with a surprised expression.On the other hand, the middle aged man that broke the pillar smiled brightly and lightly swung the spear he had in his hand.Tung! Tutung! Tung!The big rocks that were on the ground floated.Grip.He put strength in his hands.Pat!The spear split the air.The trace only left was the tail.Pubuk! Puk! Pubuk!The rocks that were in the air turned to dust even before they fell to the ground.Marvelousness.Just like it implied, it felt like watching the technique of a god. (T/N: Word joke. It can be viewed as Marvelous:god \u2013 ness:technique.)The middle aged man put back his spear and let out a long sigh.\u201cGood. Finished my morning training!\u201dAt those words, the soldier said displeased words.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cThe steward said he couldn\u2019t break the pillars\u2026\u2026\u201dThe middle aged man ignored those words and walked.He walked with his shoes that were filled with dirt and went towards the office.\u201cWhew! Certainly, the morning training is the most refreshing!\u201dThe middle aged man wiped off the sweat with his sleeve and put a satisfied smile.Both of his hands, clothes and shoes were filled with dirt.However he didn\u2019t care at all.Rather, he placed his legs over the table that was filled with piles of paper.Then, the door opened and a middle aged man with clean clothes appeared.He let out a long sigh while standing in front of the man covered in dirt.\u201cWhew. Viscount Baker. You broke the pillars again?\u201dAt those words, a humorous voice was heard.\u201cKevin. I told you to just call me by my name when we were alone. What\u2019s with Viscount Baker? Just call me Viscount Reil.\u201dIt was a really comical expression and hand movements.The middle aged man covered in dirt was the rumoured genius spearman Reil Baker.Next to him was the steward Kevin, who served him for more than 30 years.\u201cWe are nobles that don\u2019t even have a territory, but we have a need to act like one. On top of that, do you know how many things there are as nobles? Even now there are many people that wish to see you and some invita\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to then.Reil raised his right hand.\u201cStop. I understand so stop the lecturing. Just how many things are there to do?\u201dAt those words Kevin took one more step and gathered all the papers and letters that were spread on the table.\u201cExcluding the non important ones, this much remain.\u201dA paper mountain that surged up the table.At that moment, Reil frowned and had a weird expression.\u201cHuh? Why is there this much?\u201d\u201cIt gets piled up as you don\u2019t do any work all day and just focus on training in the spear.\u201dA sulky voice.Kevin was a bit upset.Reil wanted to say something but didn\u2019t.\u2018If I talk wrongly here I have to hear his complaints for 10 days.\u2019He glanced at Kevin and then put his hand among the pile of paper.\u201cAhem.\u201dAn awkward cough.It meant to tell him to get out, but Kevin didn\u2019t move at all.His eyes were telling that.Reil smacked his lips and then looked at the pile of papers.\u201cMmm. This is a request to give a speech in Miller academy. I did it last year so\u2026 declined. This is an invitation to a brat\u2019s party that\u2019s from the family of a duke, obviously declined. I already met this one the past month, so declined. This region, I went the last month\u2026\u2026\u201dSwish. Swish. Swish. Swish.The papers and the letters flew to the sides busily.Reil vaguely looked at the titles and kept yelling decline.Kevin\u2019s body started to tremble.He was right before exploding.There was no way Reil didn\u2019t discover that.\u2018He\u2019s angry. Angry.\u2019Reil, who was about to throw away one more letter, stopped. Then he acted as if he was looking at the letter thoroughly.\u201cMmm. It\u2019s sent by Baron Aaron from the east. If it\u2019s Aaron Tate\u2026..\u201dHe acted like he fell into his thoughts just to cool down Kevin\u2019s anger.\u201cAh! He\u2019s the one I met at Miller kingdom when I went to the forge! His ability to pick a spear was outstanding.\u201dA forge operated by one of the three best blacksmiths in the kingdom.Reil met Aaron at the regular forgery he went to.He thoroughly checked every weapon, unlike a noble, and then bought the spear Reil had picked.\u2018As he was different to the other nobles, I liked him.\u2019Then, they greeted each other and promised to meet each other next time.\u2018Now that I see it, he raised great merits at this Slen battle and Pedian\u2019s monster subjugation.\u2019He also knew about the news about the 7th corps.Suddenly, he felt interested.\u201cWhy would baron Aaron Tate have sent me a letter? Hmm. Hm. Hmmmm. Hm.\u201d Reil hummed and stamped the letter.And then after a while of reading the contents, he burst out of laughter.\u201cHuh! This man, I thought that he was fine but he\u2019s a real bragger.\u201dHe shook his head.Kevin, that was looking at him, and frowned.\u201cWhat\u2019s the contents?\u201dHe was also curious.Reil smirked and looked at the letter.\u201cI will tell you what\u2019s written. He says that there\u2019s an 18 year old class 5 adjutant on one of his troops and he found out about the ambush of a goblin army and slew their leader. Not only that, but he found out about the large scale surprise monster attack of Pedian\u2019s plain and faced the ogres on top of that. This is not the only thing. It wasn\u2019t enough by planning the inundation strategy on Prely river, but he also slew the orc leader Se\u2026..\u201d\u201cHe slew Sedek?\u201dKevin butted in.\u201cHuh?\u201dReid had a bit surprised face.\u201cHow did you know that?\u201dAt the question, Kevin shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to read the battle reports I gave you thoroughly.\u201dA rebuking sound.Rein opened his eyes roundly.\u201cThen all of these things are true?\u201d\u201cYes. If it\u2019s a letter sent by Aaron Tate of the 7th corps.\u201dKevin answered with a rather uninterested expression.In the other hand, Reil had a surprised face.\u201cWow. So all of these things are true, huh?\u201dHis mouth slightly raised.Then, Kevin\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cAfter looking at this Slen battle report, the soldier that slew Violin\u2019s head also seems to be that class 5 soldier.\u201d\u201cOhhhh!\u201d\u2018An 18 year old greenhorn accumulated these kind of merits?\u2019Certainly, there was no way for a person that had good eyes for picking good weapons to not be able to see well.He raised the letter and looked at Kevin.He was glaring at him with sharp eyes.\u2018Anyways, if I stay here I will just keep hearing his nagging\u2026\u2026\u2019He looked at the letter again.\u2018And the contents of the letter are also interesting.\u2019Now he was also curious about the 7th corps that was being a lot nowadays.\u2018I have never gone to the eastern parts of the kingdom\u2026\u2026.\u2019A smile appeared on his face.He shook the letter and looked at Kevin.\u201cKevin. I will go to the east to sight see for a while.\u201dAt those words Kevin shook his head.He pointed to the piled papers, letters and invitations.\u201cThere are still these many things you have to check.\u201dA firm and determined voice and attitude.Reil smiled brightly and nodded.He stood up and then swept up everything on the table with his right arm.Paaat!The papers and letters that scattered in the air.\u201cWh, just what\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen Kevin was fumbling with a surprised expression.Reil\u2019s humorous voice was heard.\u201cAll declined.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was doing it unconsciously.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation and started to look at the contents.For a while, only the sound of paper passing was heard.Chris seemed somewhat uneasy.\u2018I feel like an academy student that\u2019s being evaluated on a subject.\u2019He smirked and shook his head.After a while Roan placed down the papers and looked at Chris.His face was stiffened.Chris gulped dry saliva.\u201cWhy are you like this?

If you make a bad move you may be seen as a spy of an enemy kingdom.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dChris let out a low exclamation.His stiffened face loosened up and his mouth raised.\u2018I got recognized.\u2019Actually, he was pondering in big way about his identity.Travel agency and information group.Although he did start working like this, he felt bigger fun just by collecting information about Miller castle and the surrounding regions.\u2018It\u2019s the first time I felt this much fun since I was born.\u2019Every time he heard small information and unbelievable rumours, he put in more effort to gather more authentic rumours.It wasn\u2019t because he wanted to be treated in some way or because someone asked him to.He just felt too much fun.\u2018If I were to pick the travel agency or the information group\u2026\u2026.\u2019The answer was already set.Then Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cMister Chris. This is really amazing. The height of Miller castle, length, precise location of the gate, structure, the shifts of the guards, and the inner castle. Not only that but the location of the surrounding villages and main roads, and important information of each village is registered.\u201d\u201cYes. I gathered and analyzed all the information I could gather.\u201dChris replied like it was nothing.No, he replied like it truly was nothing.Roan continued saying.\u201cOn top of that there\u2019s also information about important people in this region.\u201d\u201cAfter gathering the rumours, I just picked out the authentic ones.\u201dCertainly, it was a casual voice.No, he tried to make it seem that way.Roan smiled faintly and said in a low voice.\u201cMister Chris. I think that your talent is even more amazing than what I had thought.\u201dBoom.Chris felt a big rock falling on his chest.A joy he couldn\u2019t precisely describe with words surrounded his entire body.Roan just looked at that Chris.Actually, he was much more surprised than what he was showing.\u2018To even guess the things that would happen from now on\u2026..\u2019There were some things written about what would happen in the future, and among them there was information Roan actually knew.\u2018The cases that would really happen.\u2019Chris had precisely guessed the future with limited information.\u2018He certainly is the head of the agency that had all the information on the continent in his hands and made the continent shake.\u2019After looking at the papers, he felt an even greater urge to grab Chris.However he didn\u2019t want to force him.He was planning to wait until he truly wanted to do it himself.Then, Chris that was looking down at the papers, said in a low voice.\u201cIf I get to work in things related to information, what will I be doing?\u201dHe pointed at the papers.Roan felt that the situation was somewhat weird.\u2018The time of choice has come.\u2019He took some breaths and said with a composed voice.\u201cYes. You have to do these things. Only\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOnly\u2026..\u201dChris copied Roan\u2019s words unconsciously.Roan pointed at the pile of papers and continued saying.\u201cYou will be handling information about a wider world and broader information.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation followed.Chris felt that his heart beat quickly and that his blood flowed quickly.This world was much broader and colorful than Miller.\u2018I\u2019m grasping all of those things.\u2019Something that made his chest swell just by thinking of it.Chris slowly calmed his breath.He smiled faintly and looked at Roan.\u2018Mister Chris.\u2019Roan forcefully hid his urgent feeling.He just waited for Chris\u2019s reply.A moment\u2019s silence.Poke.Chris poked the pile of papers with his finger.\u201cMuch broader information and more various than this\u2026..\u201dHis voice was calm but the end slightly shook.He couldn\u2019t know if he was nervous or excited.Chris looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly and continued saying.\u201cI want to handle it.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t show any reaction.He just looked at Chris\u2019s eyes.However Chris didn\u2019t feel stuffed or uneasy.Roan\u2019s hot eyes.That was enough.Chris stood up.\u201cSir adjutant Roan.\u201dHe bowed his head.\u201cTake good care of me from now on.\u201dA voice filled with strength.As it turned out like this, Roan too couldn\u2019t keep still.He stood up and bowed.\u201cAlso take good care of me.\u201dA historical day.Roan and Chris grabbed hands.The people who were looking at different directions now looked at the same one.Then, Roan smiled brightly and said in a low voice.\u201cThen, should I give you the first task?\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201dChris asked back with a surprised expression.Roan smiled faintly.\u201cThe world is wide but time is limited.\u201dAt those words Chris nodded.Roan continued to say.\u201cI\u2019m planning to invest in the merchants in Miller. To the young merchants that are a bit vague right now but have a bright future. I\u2019m talking about people just like you.\u201dThis was the reason he came to Chris in the first place.\u2018Should I listen to Chris\u2019s opinion?\u2019Roan put a strange smile and carefully asked.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone to recommend to me?\u201dAt those words Chris went silent for a moment.But it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t have anything to say.The instincts of an information gatherer in getting the initiative of the conversation.Chris took in a breath and replied in a calm voice.\u201cThere are some. They have talent and their nature is great, so their future is bright.\u201d\u201cHow many are they?\u201dAt the question, Chris extended five fingers.\u201cTio, Lidia, Eska, Lego, Ford. It\u2019s these five people.\u201dConfident voice.Roan didn\u2019t ask anymore and took out the bag containing the gems.\u201cTake this.\u201dChris carefully received the bag.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cInvestment. As I don\u2019t have much time and on top of that I am a soldier, my actions are really limited. So I would like you to invest in those five instead of me.\u201dChris had a surprised expression.\u201cWhat if something goes wrong as I invest as I wish?\u201dRoan answered like it was nothing.\u201cYou can\u2019t always succeed at investing. It doesn\u2019t matter if it fails with everyone. That by itself will become valuable information.\u201dAt those words Chris slowly nodded.\u201cAnd\u2026..\u201dRoan took out one more gem bag.\u201cThis is investment i\u2019m giving to you. You will need quite a lot of money to make a full fledged information agency.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dChris let out a low exclamation.He then nodded.\u201cI understand. I will do my best not to disappoint you.\u201d\u201cYes. I believe in you.\u201dRoan grabbed his bag and stood up.\u201cThen, I will be leaving.\u201d\u201cAlready? Why don\u2019t you eat something?\u201dIt was an urgent voice.However Roan shook his head.\u201cThe path I have to walk is long.\u201dHe extended his right hand.Chris couldn\u2019t talk back anymore and grabbed that hand.\u201cI will find you with good results.\u201d\u201cI will be waiting for you.\u201dRoan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cThen, I will be leaving.\u201dA farewell.Roan shook his hands once and then moved outside the agency.Chris let out a long sigh.\u2018Is it a new start?\u2019He felt his chest beating even more than when he first opened the travel agency.\u2018First, should I go and find those five merchants?\u2019Chris bit his lower lip and slowly moved.This was his first task and road.*****The Lancephil was a weird family for various reasons.He was one of the five counts from Rinse kingdom that didn\u2019t have a residence in the capital of Miller, didn\u2019t even have a territory and was located in a barren land in the south.Because of that Ipen castle, Beno castle, etc. were all inside the territory of Count Lancephil.But the real reason he was special was because of Io Lancephil, who was the head of the family and one of the five counts of the kingdom.This year he turned out 60, but he didn\u2019t have any children.Of course, there were various reasons for that, for a count that was in his sixties to not have any children was a really exceptional case.Because of that, a similar conversation came and went in the castle everyday.\u201cSir Count. You aren\u2019t late yet. If you marry now\u2026..\u201d\u201cJust stop hohoho.\u201dIt was a laughter that made people feel good.The middle aged man who was suggesting with an earnest heart let out a long sigh.\u2018Whew. He\u2019s once again laughing like this.\u2019He looked at the old man and had a regretful face.\u2018To devote all of his youth for the sake of the kingdom and to already become that old. Tch. It\u2019s the frailty of life.\u2019The man seemed to have read the thoughts of the middle aged man and he laughed off once again.\u201cHohoho. Albert. I\u2019m really fine.\u201dAt those words the middle aged man Albert Wein bowed.\u201cYes. I understand sir Count Lancephil.\u201dThe man that seemed good natured was one of the five counts in Rinse kingdom and the lord of the eastern region, Io Lancephil.Io slowly started to move while carrying his baggage.\u201cThen, should we go outside the castle?\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAs Albert shook his left hand, the knights that were lined up to the sides ran outside the castle a step ahead of them.Io and Albert followed them from behind.Albert looked at Io\u2019s white hair and bit his lower lip.\u2018He could have been in possession of the central region but he said he would keep Byron kingdom and Estel kingdom in check and he personally was put in charge of the outer regions as his territory. As the love he feels towards the kingdom is that extreme, his interests would obviously change.\u2019It had already been more than 30 years since he served Io.He was called as the second lieutenant knight guard until now, and he even received a title of viscount.\u2018If my health was good I would have served him a bit more\u2026\u2026.\u2019Retirement was decided for Albert.Then, Io who was walking in front let out a short sigh.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t remain long for you and this scenery.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir count.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so. You are also quite old. Holding onto you until now was also my greed.\u201dAt those words Albert lowered his face.\u201cViscount Kali Owells, who was decided to become my successor is a more outstanding knight than I am.\u201d\u201cReally? Hohoho.\u201dIo burst out in laughter.However it somewhat felt like he didn\u2019t completely like it.After they got out of the castle they entered a long road.Io liked inspecting Pavor castle, from what he had to do, the most.It was the opportunity to check the lifestyle of the residents himself and sympathize with them.And the residents truly liked Io and respected him.Because of that, the day when Io did the inspecting, the road was more noisy and busy.Just like there was a festival.But today it was an exception.The road was dead silent.Io looked at the residents with a strange expression.\u2018The expressions\u2026\u2026.\u2019They had really scared looks.Then, a serious looking middle aged man approached him.He bowed towards Io and Albert.\u201cWe finished the preparations for the investigation.\u201dIn that instant, Io knew the reason as to why the residents were scared.\u2018It seems the knights scare them.\u2019He felt bitter.\u201cHohoho.\u201dA laugher.But this one was filled with displeasure.He looked at Albert and said in a whispering voice.\u201cAlbert. I don\u2019t know why but it seems like I will already miss you. Hohoho.\u201dAt those words Albert glared at the middle aged man in front of him.\u2018Kali Owells. You stupid bastard.\u2019The middle aged man who looked serious.This was the successor for Albert and the one that was leading the knights, Kali Owells.He was the head of the Owells family and was also the father of Walter Owells who was related with Roan.\u2018Kali. Your abilities and talent are outstanding, but that excessive aspiration is the problem of your ambition.\u2019Albert became speechless and looked at Io.He was still laughing.However Albert could know.\u2018He\u2019s really angry.\u2019He wanted to loosen his mood with whatever he could.Then, a young knight passed over the crowd and approached them.\u2018Huh?\u2019While he frowned and tilted his head, the guy approached and whispered.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that instant, Albert\u2019s face brightened.He looked at Io and said as if he was whispering.\u201cSir Count. Even so it seems like he have to leave the inspection for another time.\u201d\u201cIt seems like something has happened?\u201dIo slightly tilted his head and asked back.\u201cIt seems like Viscount Reil Baker has come to visit to Ipen castle.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 56 - To the north (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018I knew that he was a free person\u2026\u2026\u2019Aaron was a bit dumbfounded.Although he was riding a horse, his conscience was half gone.And that was because of the middle aged man riding the horse and having fun in front of him.\u201cHahaha! The taste of riding the plains of the east is good!\u201dA magnanimous laugh.A face full of playfulness.That was the rumoured genius spearman Reil Baker.\u2018To appear early at dawn with only one knight accompanying him.\u2019Aaron was astounded.Even he, who was free and open, wasn\u2019t as much as Reil was.\u201cHahaha! Liam! Your cavalry skills are a mess! Why do you keep falling behind?!\u201dReil, who was riding in front, yelled towards the accompanying knight.The knight, Liam, laughed awkwardly and kicked his horse.\u2018Sir viscount. Please save me some face.\u2019He remembered the entrusting words Kevin told him before leaving their territory.Liam let out a sigh.\u2018In the first place, there\u2019s no dignity to protect.\u2019For now he stuck next to Reil.\u201cUmm sir viscount. I know that you feel good, but even so, at least\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to then.Reil pointed forward and yelled.\u201cI can see Beno castle!\u201dAnd then, he yelled towards Aaron and the following soldiers.\u201cThe person that arrives the latest buys breakfast!\u201dAn absurd story.However Reil stuck his chest towards the horse and started to ride fiercely.When Aaron and the staff officers of the 7th squad were putting an absent minded face, Liam let out a sigh and said.\u201cHe\u2019s truly saying that.\u201dAnd then he also kicked the horse and started to ride quickly.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAaron and the officers.The others laughed awkwardly and looked at each other and then grabbed the reins and started to ride.And they started to kick their horses almost at the same time.Heeeeeng!The rough cry of the horse.The sudden race competition started just like that.*****\u201cWhew. I\u2019m full.\u201dReil patted his stomach and looked at Aaron.\u201cBaron Aaron. I ate really well.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes. I\u2019m glad you did so.\u201dAaron looked at his empty money pocket and shook his head.\u2018For him to really receive food.\u2019Of course, the last one in the race was Aaron.However, normally it wasn\u2019t a custom for a person of a higher rank to be treated from someone by a lower rank.\u2018He really has no ranks in mind.\u2019Aaron looked at Reil, who was riding in front, and had a faint smile.He couldn\u2019t get a grasp of him and he was beyond himself, but he liked him quite much.\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s still regrettable. I wanted to meet adjutant Roan.\u201dReil smacked his lips.Only after he arrived at Ipen castle did he come to know that Roan was in a retired state.At most he said that it would take three months, so the remaining time was one month.Then, Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cHe will return soon, so why don\u2019t you wait some time and meet him?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dReil pondered for a moment and then shook his head.\u2018Even so, I can\u2019t leave my territory for one whole month.\u2019He bitterly smiled.\u201cThat will be a bit difficult.\u201dA negative answer.Regret was shown in Aaron\u2019s face for a moment.\u2018Can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019Actually, for a viscount or a noble to wait one month to meet a mere 5 class adjutant was an absurd thing.Aaron bowed.\u201cThen, I will go and find you the moment he returns.\u201dIt was a really sorry expression.However, it wasn\u2019t his fault.Reil had more of a fault that couldn\u2019t check the letter beforehand for being taken in his spear training.\u201cDo so. For now, I will be satisfied with just meeting rose troop.\u201dIt was the troop Roan belonged to and had a reputation for having taken the biggest role in Slen battle.\u2018Just by looking at the Slen battle report, it was quite an outstanding troop\u2026\u2026.\u2019Meeting an outstanding commander and the soldiers was always a fun thing.Having ridden from Ipen castle to Beno castle without resting was also to experience that fun.\u201cI will lead you.\u201dAaron started to walk one step ahead.They walked the streets of Beno castle and then they arrived at the headquarters of rose troop.Every time he passed a building, a faint sound was heard.\u2018Mmm?\u2019But the only one that heard that among them was Reil.He flinched for a moment and then changed directions.\u201cHuh? Viscount Baker, it\u2019s not over there but here.\u201dAaron called him aloud but Reil started to walk in a weird direction as if he was possessed.\u2018It\u2019s a really sharp noise.\u2019Reil went around the building and stood around a big empty lot.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA low exclamation flowed out.It was quite the large training ground.One youth was training in his spear.But his spear skills were really strange.\u2018It\u2019s not a spearmanship taught by the kingdom.\u2019Reil hid his presence and looked at the youth training his spear for a while.Aaron, Liam and the officers that followed late also hid their presence like him.Paat! Pabat! Paat!A sharp sound hit their ears continuously.The spear drew a line of light as if it was dancing.The spear that drew an elegant line and the movements that followed softly.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026Amazing.\u201dLiam, who was watching him, couldn\u2019t hold it in and let out an exclamation.Aaron and the other officers were the same.A surprised look was seen on their faces.Reil looked at Aaron and asked in a low voice.\u201cWho\u2019s that youth?\u201d\u201cYes? Th, thats\u2026\u2026.\u201dAaron was perplexed for a moment and then looked at the officers.However the officers also laughed awkwardly and shook their heads.\u201cHe has such an amazing spearmanship but you don\u2019t even know who he is? Hahaha.\u201dReil laughed magnanimously and moved his feet.He approached the youth with big steps.\u201cHey!\u201dA loud yell.The youth stopped in the posture that he was swinging the spear in.\u201cWho\u2026\u2026..Huh?!\u201dThe youth who was looking at Reil with a weird expression looked at Aaron. His eyes traces the others around his back and he hurriedly fixed his posture.\u201cSir!\u201dHe had a straight posture.Aaron lightly shook his head.\u201cHe is Viscount Reil Baker. Answer his questions.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe youth answered in a loud voice and looked at Reil.\u201cI\u2019m spearman Pierce from the 12th squad of rose troop belonging to the 7th corps!\u201dThe youth, his identity was Pierce.Reil smiled faintly and grabbed Pierce\u2019s shoulders.\u201cWhat\u2019s the spearmanship you executed just now? It wasn\u2019t a spearmanship from the kingdom.\u201dAt those words Pierce was a bit perplexed.He hesitated and couldn\u2019t reply easily.Aaron frowned.\u201cPierce. The Viscount is asking you.\u201dPierce looked at Aaron and Reil alternatingly and let out a long sigh.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026..It\u2019s a spearmanship I learned separately.\u201d\u201cSeparately? From who?\u201dReil asked.\u2018It\u2019s an amazing spearmanship. It\u2019s a really strong spearmanship that even normal soldiers without mana can execute.\u2019He really wanted to know who was the one who taught him this.Pierce hesitated once more and then answered as if he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201cIt\u2019s adjutant Roan from rose troop.\u201dBoom.At that instant Reil, Aaron, and all the others had surprised expressions.It was because a name they hadn\u2019t expected at all had come out.\u2018I knew that Roan had outstanding talent\u2026\u2026..\u2019He didn\u2019t know that he had learned this strong spearmanship.No, he didn\u2019t know he was so skilled to teach this to others.\u201cHo!\u201dReil feigned a laugh.\u2018An 18 year old adjutant taught this kind of spearmanship?\u2019He looked at Aaron.\u201cBaron Tate.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dAaron replied while confused.Reil continued speaking with a serious expression.\u201cGive me a room to stay for one month.\u201dAnd then, he looked at Pierce.\u201cAnd you. Were you called Pierce?\u201d\u201cYes? Yes!\u201dPierce replied while putting a stiff posture.Reil\u2019s mouth rose.\u201cYou will have to talk with me.\u201d*****Roan, who left the capital of Miller was entering the eastern region of the kingdom.\u2018In two more days is it Slen region\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Meanwhile, the season turned to become summer.The sun shined strongly and the west wind came blowing with a strong heat.But of course Roan couldn\u2019t feel any heat because of Brent\u2019s ring.He looked down at the ring.\u2018However I think of it, this isn\u2019t an artifact a human is capable of manufacturing.\u2019Although Louis was a magician of the 6th circle, he lacked the skills to make this kind of artifact.This meant that Brent\u2019s ring was that amazing.\u2018To even be able to breathe under water.\u2019Although he couldn\u2019t maintain it for long because the mana spent was too severe, he could certainly breathe underwater.Not only that, but he could record the sound of a conversation or memorize a scenery or a sight.\u2018But of course, this also spends a lot of mana.\u2019Anyways, it was a ring that showed more functions, which he hadn\u2019t even thought about, the more his ability to operate mana increased.\u2018Now that I see it, Kalian\u2019s tear is also an amazing artifact.\u2019Roan moved his sight and looked at the end of the plain.A normal scenery that was no different than usual.However, as he inserted mana in the tear, the scenery changed in an instant.A golden wave filled his sight.\u2018So this is mana\u2026\u2026\u2019When he inserted mana into the tear, he could see the mana spread aorund in the world.Although it was a function that didn\u2019t help him at all in normal situations, it was quite a useful ability in battles or emergencies.Because when someone used mana or moved, the golden wave in their surroundings contorted or producesd a slight change.Because of that, Roan could guess the actions of the opponent beforehand and know what it was.\u2018If the level of my mana increases, more functions will appear, right?\u2019An expression filled with expectation.Roan pulled back his mana along with a faint smile.At that moment, the scenery that was filled with golden waves turned to normal.\u2018Huh?\u2019Then, he saw a displeasing movement at the end of his sight.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan glared at the end of the plains.At that instant, the scenery that was far away got expanded.\u2018Goblin?\u2019A small goblin army was running across the plains.On top of that, all of them were holding blades.Although they were far away, he could feel a ferocious intent from their bodies or expressions.Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018Are they planning to attack the village?\u2019It was something that happened frequently in a place that was not inside the safe zone.\u2018Although this village should have a vigilance guard\u2026..\u2019Just by guessing, the number of the goblin army was close to 200.At the slightest slipup, the guards would collapse and the village would be annihilated.\u2018If there are no forces that inspect the territory or they don\u2019t have a region troop\u2026\u2026\u2019It was quite a dangerous situation.Roan didn\u2019t think anymore.Tat!He charged through and started to chase the backs of the goblins.In the worst case, it was to at least help them by himself.Passs.Behind Roan\u2019s back, a hot wind blew******\u201cDamn! Block them! Don\u2019t let them cross the fence!\u201dGut stood at the watch tower and kept firing arrows in succession.Chwee! Chwee!The cries of the goblins hit their ears.Beyond the fence that was built with several layers, 200 goblins were charging through.Sweeeee!Arrows poured from the watch tower.However, the skills of the guards of this village weren\u2019t that outstanding.Pusk. Puk. Puuk.Most of the arrows hit the ground and not the goblins.\u2018Damn! That\u2019s why I told you to practice firing arrows even when you are busy with farming!\u2019Only Gut, who was the head of the guards of Whose village, showed cool skills and fought alone.Puk!Chwee!One arrow pierced the head of a goblin.\u2018I wondered why they were so calm nowadays\u2026\u2026\u2019The goblins of this region normally grouped in tens and attacked big and small villages.However, nowadays those things had stopped.When Gut and the others were slightly relaxing.Suddenly, an amazing number of goblins they hadn\u2019t faced until now appeared.\u2018Damn. Will we be able to block them?\u2019Doubt was seen in his eyes.The number of the guards were 30.And adding the men who had some experience they amounted to 100.Although they were at a disadvantage with numbers, taking into account that their enemies were goblins, it wasn\u2019t that pessimistic of a situation.However.\u2018How do you want us to fight with pickaxes!\u2019Only 30 people were holding things that could be called weapons.The guards and the villagers were originally farmers so they neglected weapon maintenance.Because of that, most had pickaxes, sickles, and hoes.\u2018Damn. It\u2019s kill or die!\u2019They did send the fast guards to the nearest region troop, but they had almost no probability to hold until they arrived.Chwee! Chwee!Meanwhile, the goblins came near the fence.Bang! Babang!They smashed the fence with their bodies or tried to jump over it.Fortunately, as they were short, they couldn\u2019t cross it in one go.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cDirty goblin bastards!\u201dThe guards stuck to the fences and stabbed them with their spears.Stab.\u201cKyaaak!\u201d\u201cChweee!\u201dThe goblins who were trying to get inside the village without any fear were stabbed with the spear and lost their lives.\u201cThrow rocks!\u201d\u201cFire arrows!\u201dThey started to throw rocks and arrows from the watchtower at the goblins that were gathered in the fence.The number of the goblins that started to fall increased.Chwee! Chwee!As it turned out like this, they could have retreated, but they would rather charge more fiercely.The goblins climbed over the corpses of their dead allies and started to cross the fence.Boom.Corpses that piled up over the other corpses.In an instant, a solid foothold was made outside the fence.Chwee!The goblin that seemed to be the leader shook his hand and cried.Chwee! Chwee!The goblins started to run towards the fence while holding their blades.Tok! Todok!They stepped on the corpses of their allies and jumped over.\u201cHuh?! Block them!\u201dGut, who was looking at the situation, yelled.Only then did the guards and the villagers raise their blades, spears, hoes, and sickles.\u201cBlock them!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cIf this gets broken through, our famillies will be in danger!\u201dThey put their lives on the line for their loved ones.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!As the blade of the goblins clashed with the weapon of the farmers, sparks flew off.\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThey guards and the villages men ground their teeth and held on, but because of their lacking experience and weapons, they started to slowly get pushed back.\u2018Damn. We aren\u2019t in a situation to be firing arrows.\u2019Gut tightly bit his lower lip.The 100 plus goblins started to climb the fence in turns.Then.Sweeeee!A sharp sound hit their ears.\u2018What is it?\u2019Gut turned his head to the place where the sound was heard.Puk!The spear trembled while being stuck in the ground.\u201cJust what is\u2026\u2026\u201dThe people that were on the fence and the goblins who were trying to cross over the fence had surprised faces and looked towards the place where the spear came flying from.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cChwee?\u201dTheir eyes grew big.One youth was running along the west wind.He came with a fast speed and fierce intent.His rough hair fluttered with the wind.A youth that was still a child but emanated a wild feeling.It was Roan.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading and for the sponsors!

Chwee!The goblins let out cries.The comrades that died helplessly at the spear suddenly came flying back.Their eyes turned red.Chwee!Four goblins, who still hadn\u2019t crossed over the fence, kicked the ground and charged towards Roan.The distance between Roan and the goblins closed in an instant.Slash! Stab!The four goblins swung their blades consecutively.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201dWhoever saw it, Roan\u2019s life was in danger.The blade of the goblins was about to hack over Roan\u2019s body.The people in the watch tower couldn\u2019t watch anymore as they turned their heads and frowned.However, only Gut fixed his gaze.\u2018That\u2019s not a scared or an urgent expression at all!\u2019Roan\u2019s expression was very calm.On top of that, his mouth was slightly raised.Actually, Roan didn\u2019t feel pressed at all.\u2018Now, things such as goblins are funny.\u2019Roan looked at the blades flying towards him, fixedly.Swaaaa.The scenery turned slowly to the point where he yawned.Roan circulated the mana and nimbly moved his body.Swish.They were soft movements.He slightly twisted his body and dodged the first blade with leisure.Cheng!At the same time, he took out a small and sharp blade from his waist.Stab.The short sword stabbed the back of the first goblin.Paaat!Every blood drop was seen continued by the pulled sword.The scene in front of him was so slow it made you sick and it was seen clearly.\u2018I\u2019m not the me from before.\u2019Although the level of his mana wasn\u2019t high yet, knowing how to utilize it and not knowing was like the difference between heaven and earth.\u2018Now, I can attack the blind spots through the weak spots I can see with Kalian\u2019s tear.\u2019But of course, he was still lacking a lot.It was like he could try something which he hadn\u2019t even been able to before.He was at a level where he could face basic warriors like goblins and orcs, easily.Spat!Roan also dodged the second blade and stabbed the sword into the chin of the second goblin.\u2018Hmph! Where!\u2019At the same time he extended his left hand and grabbed the throat of the third one.Chwee?The goblin broke his posture and was pulled.Right over him, the blade of the fourth goblin fell with a fierce intent.Slash.The head of the third goblin was cut off by the fourth one.Pat!At the same time, the scenery that was so slow it made him yawn, returned to normal.\u2018Kugh. My eyes hurt a lot.\u2019As he saw the scenery in slow motion through Kalian\u2019s tear, his eyes were hurting.Then.Grr. Grrrr. Grr.Three goblins that were standing completely fine, collapsed almost at the same time.Blood started to fall from their neck.Chwee?The fourth goblin that got left alone in an instant, opened his eyes roundly.He had an expression where he couldn\u2019t believe that he killed his ally with his own hands.Roan passed by next to him with a casual expression and swung his sword.Pibit.A thin red line appeared on the neck.Grr.The last and fourth one also fell onto the floor.\u2018Im, impossible!\u2019Gut, who was checking the situation, opened his mouth.\u2018What just happened right now?!\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe the scene that happened before him.\u2018He was closing in the goblins, they were swinging their blades, and he pulled back.\u2019It certainly seemed like that.However the moment Roan made his third step, three goblins fell.And the fourth one also fell while grabbing his neck.\u2018It happened in an instant and I couldn\u2019t see anything.\u2019But there was one certain thing.That Roan perfectly took care of four goblins.\u2018Knight? Soldier? Mercenary?\u2019When Gut was rolling his eyes to try and identify Roan\u2019s identity.Roan walked and stood in front of the spear that was stuck in the ground.Swush.As he stepped on the two goblins that had the spear pierced in them and pulled it, a dark red blood flowed with the spear.Roan walked while holding his spear.\u2018Take care of the goblins at the fastest possible speed.\u2019He needed to hurry a little more to save any unnecessary deaths.Tat!He charged forward and flew into the air.\u201cWha, what is it?\u201dChwee?The people and the goblins looked at Roan and had surprised expressions.At that moment, Roan\u2019s spear drew a line of light.Spat!The spear slashed the goblins.Pibit!Following the spear, a line of dark red blood spread into the air.At the same time.Kyaaaaaak!The cries of the goblins hit his ear.*****Io, who spent most of his young times in the battlefield, couldn\u2019t stand still while looking at the knights and soldiers that had skills and also had a good nature.Not enough with big and small amounts of patronage, he also invited people regardless of their identity and rank and even spent some days with them.However, nowadays it was difficult to find a guy that he liked.No, even so, there was one he liked.\u2018Viscount Reil Baker.\u2019A treasure of Rinse kingdom and the spear genius.He was also a middle aged man that was in his forties, but his skills were amazing to be counted in one hand.And not only his skills.His nature and personality was also great.Rather than obsessing in useless ambitions, he concentrated and focused on his training.\u2018Viscount Baker is the best in Rinse kingdom right now.\u2019Although there were famous knights and captains, but Io picked Reil as the best.\u2018It just seems like watching my young self.\u2019A proud smile.However Io frowned.\u2018I sent him countless invitations\u2026\u2026.\u2019As he appreciated him a lot, he wanted to leave him at his side and check what he did.However Reil had various excuses and didn\u2019t participate in the parties.\u2018But that kind of guy suddenly visited the castle?\u2019Io had a weird expression.It was difficult to believe, but there would be no way the report was wrong.\u2018I don\u2019t know the reason, but it\u2019s certain that it\u2019s a good opportunity.\u2019The distance between Pavor castle and Ipen castle wasn\u2019t that far.An opportunity to meet him and converse for a long while.His mouth slightly raised.\u2018Does he like it that much?\u2019Even Albert, who was looking him at the side, started to smile.\u2018To depart the moment he received the report.\u2019On top of that, he chose a horse rather than a carriage as the means of transport.Io liked and appreciated Reil that much.Dudududu.The sound of horse steps hit their ears.Then, Kali Owells who was riding at the front, turned back and yelled.\u201cSir count!\u201dHe had a stiffened expression.Albert replied in a loud voice instead of Io.\u201cWhat happened?!\u201dKali pointed the end of the plains.\u201cI think that something happened.\u201dAt those words, Io and Albert opened their eyes sharply and looked towards the end of the plain.A village could was seen faintly.Black smoke was seen along with unusual movements on the fence.There certainly was something wrong.\u2018Maybe?\u2019Io\u2019s and Albert\u2019s faces turned hard.\u2018Did monsters raid the village?\u2019A possible story.Io quickly sent the order.\u201cNow, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dKali replied in a loud voice and kicked his horse.The escorting knights followed his back.\u2018They have to be safe.\u2019Io took in a deep breath and grinded his teeth.Dudududu.The sound of horse steps became clearer.*****\u2018Wha, what\u2019s this youth?\u2019\u2018A roaming warrior?\u2019\u2018Is he a mercenary?\u2019The guards and villagers of Whose village were half absentminded.At the end of their sight was Roan.And Roan was slaying the goblins while moving like wind between them.\u2018It\u2019s an amazing spearmanship.\u2019A strong and concise spearmanship even in the eyes of an outsider.Chwee! Chwee!If goblins could talk in human tongue, they would have yelled like this.But unfortunately, the sounds they could make was limited.Chwee!It was a dispirited cry.Kyaaaak!And a sharp last cry.The goblins couldn\u2019t become Roan\u2019s opponent.\u2018Where!\u2019There was leisure in Roan\u2019s movements.On top of that, he even checked the state of the villagers in the middle of the massacre.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201dA short shout.At the same time he pulled the shoulders of the villager.\u201cHut!\u201dHe staggered, and stepped back.At that moment, a blade stabbed into the ground where he originally was.If he made a wrong move, he would have had his neck cut off.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..Tha, thank you.\u201dThe villages man bowed with an absent minded expression.Roan smiled faintly and swung his spear once more.A one sided slaying and massacre occurred.Chwee! Chwee!The cries were spat out faster.Urgency and a bit of fear could be seen in the ugly faces of the goblins.Chwee!In the end the leader raised his right hand.It was the retreat sign.Chwee! Chwee!About 30 goblins crossed to the other side of the fence and fled outside the village.\u201cWhere!\u201dRoan wasn\u2019t planning on leaving them alone.If he did so, other villages would also be attacked.\u2018I can\u2019t miss even one!\u2019It was when Roan was about to charge to the front for a perfect clearing.Sweeeeee!Pubububuk!Suddenly, a rain of arrows fell outside the fence.Kaaaaak! Kyak!The goblins became like porcupines and fell one by one.When Roan turned to look, he had a weird expression.Dudududu.The sound of horse steps shaking the ground was heard.At the same time, tens of soldiers appeared. No, they certainly are\u2026\u2018They are knights.\u2019Flashy armor and a huge long sword.They were the escort knights of Lancephil.The knights massacred the fleeing goblins without missing one.Roan stepped on their corpses and looked at them.\u201cWh, what are they?\u201d\u201cLooking at how their armor shines, they must be knights.\u201dThe villagers gathered behind Roan.Gut, who appeared late, and extended his head over the fence.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation came out.Even so, he had recognized the symbol drawn on their armor.\u201cIt\u2019s the symbol for the Lancephil family.\u201dAt those words, nervousness was seen on the faces of the people.They stuck themselves closely behind Roan.Rather than the flashy knights, Roan who looked kind of simple seemed to be more friendly.Meanwhile, the knights that massacred the goblins approached the entrance of the village.\u201cOpen the doors!\u201dBang! Bang! Bang!Kali hit the tightly closed entrance with the end of his sheath.As Gut made eye signs, the guards hurriedly ran and opened the doors.Clop. Clop.The knights lined up into lines at the sides.After a while, Io and Albert showed themselves between them.Roan was still stepping on the corpses of the goblins.At that instant, Io and Roan made eye contact.\u2018He slew tens of goblins alone. It was an amazing spearmanship.\u2019Amazement could be seen in Io\u2019s face.He stood outside the village and looked at Roan\u2019s actions.\u2018A concise and strong spearmanship for an actual battle. Although he looks childish he is a veteran in spear skills.\u2019His mouth slightly rose up.Roan was stuffed with his own meaning.\u2018I\u2019m finally meeting Count Lancephil\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019A person he had to meet someday, somehow.That meeting occurred the moment he hadn\u2019t expected, and suddenly.When his stifling thoughts continued.Kali yelled in a loud voice.\u201cIt\u2019s Count Io Lancephil!\u201dNot a barone, a baron, nor a viscount, but a count.A noble with only five of its position.The villagers of Whose village who couldn\u2019t see Io as frequently as the residents of Pavor castle hurriedly got onto the floor.And Roan was the same.\u201cHohoho. Don\u2019t do that.\u201dIo frowned and looked at Kali.It was a really displeased look.Kali clapped while having flinched.Clap!\u201cEveryone stand up! There\u2019s no need for that excessive mannerism!\u201dAt those words, Roan and the others slowly stood up and attended politely.Io looked at the goblin corpses in the surrounding area and nodded.\u201cThe number of the goblins wasn\u2019t low, but you blocked them well. Outstanding. Who\u2019s the leader of the guards in this village?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Gut.\u201dA polite posture and voice.Io hit his shoulder himself and laughed.\u201cHohoho. Amazing. You blocked the goblins really well.\u201d\u201cTha, thank you.\u201dGut just put on a confused expression.Then, Io called out Roan with hand signs.\u201cCome here.\u201dAt those words Albert, Kali and the others turned to look at Roan.Sights filled with amazement and curiosity.Roan stood in front of Io with a null expression.\u2018His body is strong and his balance is also good. It\u2019s a really well built body.\u2019Io was amazed.The Roan, when he looked closely, was different to when he saw him from afar.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dA lightly asked question.Roan saluted and bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s class 5 adjutant Roan from Rose troop of the 7th corps.\u201d\u201cRose troop of the 7th corps? Roan?\u201dAt the unexpected answer Io, Albert, the knights and the townspeople had surprised expressions.Although the 7th corps was located on a region inside the territory of Count Lancephil, this village was quite far away.\u2018Roan\u2026\u2026..\u2019On top of that, he didn\u2019t know why this name was so familiar to hear.He slightly looked at Albert.Eyes implying if he had heard of it.\u2018Anyhow, can\u2019t do anything about him.\u2019Albert smiled faintly and approached.And fortunately, he knew a bit about Roan.\u2018He\u2019s someone that is putting his name in battle reports a lot. Although I never expected to meet him here.\u2019Albert slightly looked at Roan and whispered towards Io.\u201cHe\u2019s the one that planned the inundation tactic at Prely river and the soldier that slew Sedek. And recently, he executed a weird strategy and also slew Violin.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dIo let out a low exclamation.Only now did he remember.\u2018Right. Class 5 adjutant Roan of Rose troop. I can remember now.\u2019The strange strategies and outstanding spearmanship he read in the reports; he was amazed every time.Io smiled brightly and looked at Roan.\u201cSo you were Roan. I know about your performances.\u201d\u201cI was just lucky.\u201dHe was not excessively humility.\u201cBut what\u2019s an adjutant of Rose troop doing over here?\u201d\u201cI just finished my temporary retirement and was in the middle of returning.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s answer, Io smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s really good. We were also going to Ipen castle. How about traveling together?\u201dA sudden proposal.Roan slightly raised his head and looked at Io.\u2018Just the thing I wanted.\u2019He bowed once again.\u201cYes. I will follow your wish.\u201dAt those words, Io clapped with a joyful expression.Clap.\u201cGood. Then we will be able to speak while traveling.\u201dHe then called one knight over with a hand sign.\u201cGive one horse to Roan.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dSoon, he came forward with an extra horse.Roan stood up on the saddle with a quite experienced posture.\u2018Oh. His posture is amazing.\u2019Io smiled faintly and nodded.He had a kind look.But contrary to Io, there was someone sending him a displeased look.Kali Owells.\u2018It\u2019s displeasing.\u2019He didn\u2019t like that Roan suddenly accompanied them at all.He was a commoner and on top of that, a normal soldier and not a knight.He wasn\u2019t someone to fit in with him.On top of that, he couldn\u2019t forgive the face that he received all of Io\u2019s interest.His eyes naturally became fierce.Roan felt that gaze and smiled bitterly.\u2018So that person is Kali Owells.\u2019Although he couldn\u2019t remember Walter Owells in the first place, he did remember things about Kali.\u2018He did a really shocking thing in my last life.\u2019The person with the highest probabilities to become his first stepping stone.That was Kali Owells.Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThen, shall we slowly depart?\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAlbert replied quickly and shook his hand.Kali and the other knights reorganized their ranks.Meanwhile, Io grabbed the hands of the villagers himself and consoled their surprised hearts.Roan, who was looking at that, bit his lower lip.\u2018Sir Count Io Lancephil\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019The reason why he returned to the eastern regions even after having acquired the mana technique and the fighting manual.That was related in a big way with Io who was in front of him.Then, Albert\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWe finished the preparations.\u201dAt those words Io shook his hand of the people and got on the saddle.\u201cWe are departing.\u201dA short order.\u201cDepart!\u201dAlbert yelled in a loud voice while grabbing the reins.Dudududu.Then, the sound of horse step was heard clearly.The hot wind became a bit cooler.The heads of the horses were pointing towards the east.A new story, new relations and a new future was over there.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because tomorrow always comes.\u201dA powerful resolution.Reil was astounded.\u2018I heard that the 12th squad was only formed a few months ago, but to have this much trust and loyalty\u2026\u2026\u2019Probably Pierce and the others of the 12th squad would keep waiting until the day Roan returned.\u2018Roan. He\u2019s someone that I want to meet the more I learn about him.\u2019It\u2019s already been 10 days since he stayed at Beno castle.In the meanwhile, he had heard many stories about Roan.And especially about that, the most interesting one was related to Roan\u2019s spear skills.\u2018At first, I thought that he just taught him what he knew.\u2019But while conversing with Pierce, he realized that that wasn\u2019t everything.\u2018Roan spearmanship\u2026..\u2019He would have to ask him the precise things himself, but if it\u2019s true that Roan made it himself\u2026\u2018It means that he\u2019s a genius among geniuses.\u2019Even Reil lasted 10 years until he first made a spearmanship.Even for Reil, it took him almost 10 years until to make his own spearmanship technique.\u2018Is it already time to put down the title of spear genius?\u2019He didn\u2019t have any frustration.Rather, his heart pumped faster because of the expectation.\u2018Roan. I will wait for you here. Be it one day, two days, ten days or a month.\u2019He had that resolution.\u2018Instead, you have to spar with me every time I want to.\u2019His mouth slightly raised up.Perhaps it was because he wanted Roan to return quickly, but his eyes kept staring at the south.Then.\u2018Huh?\u2019Reil sharpened his eyes.Because a dust cloud arose from the end of the plains.\u2018A knight squad?\u2019It was still difficult to identify them precisely because they were still far away.Then, Pierce\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThey seem like knights.\u201dAt those words Reil frowned.\u201cYou, you can see that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPierce nodded with a calm expression.Reil was astounded.\u2018He can see that far at this distance? This guy certainly isn\u2019t a normal one either.\u2019Because of Roan, he was a bit overshadowed by him, but Pierce\u2019s talent was also excellent.\u2018Although I can\u2019t judge Roan\u2019s talent before I personally meet him, the talent of this guy\u2026\u2026\u2019Reil slightly bit his lower lip.\u2018He\u2019s more amazing than me.\u2019He had a kind of proud feeling.He felt like he became rich.\u2018For now, did I at least acquire one?\u2019If perhaps Roan\u2019s talent was not that good, he had to at least acquire Pierce.\u2018It\u2019s slowly time to raise a disciple.\u2019The thing every noble wanted from him.For the spear genius Reil Baker to train a disciple.However Reil put out every kind of excuse until now and pretended not to know about that.But looking at the shining talents Pierce had, he slowly felt that he wanted to raise a disciple.\u2018If on top of this, Roan has a more outstanding talent\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019His mouth slightly rose up.Meanwhile, the knights came quite close.\u201cThey certainly seem like knights.\u201dShining armors.Only then could Reil identify them.Dudududu.Horse steps shaking the ground was heard.Now, the knights were so close you could check their faces.\u201cHuh?!\u201dIt was a surprised expression.Reil let out a low exclamation.\u201cCount Lancephil?!\u201dThe old man leading the knights.He certainly was Io.Only after he arrived at Ipen castle did Io get to know that Reil and Aaron were at Beno castle.He didn\u2019t rest a moment and went towards Beno castle.\u201cHohoho! Viscount Reil Baker!\u201dIo, who arrived at the gates, discovered Reil and laughed.\u201cGreetings to Count Io Lancephil.\u201dReil hurriedly bowed.Pierce was also nervous as he was tenseIo slowly got off the horse and grabbed Reil\u2019s hands.\u201cIt hurt my feelings that you declined all the invitations I sent you until now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. As I concentrated on training, I lacked the time to go to other places.\u201d\u201cRight. Right. There\u2019s nothing more important than focusing on your training.\u201dIo had a satisfied expression and nodded.And then, said as if he was whispering.\u201cBut what did you come all the way to Beno castle for?\u201dAt those words Reil smiled bitterly.\u201cActually, there\u2019s someone I wanted to meet at all cos\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he talked up to that point.\u201cHuh? Huh? Huh?\u201dPierce\u2019s voice was heard.A really perplexed look.\u201cHm?\u201dReil frowned and looked at Pierce.Eyes implying what happened.Pierce pointed at the knights.Precisely, it was at the back of the knights wearing flashy armor.There was a youth wearing a shabby and normal outfit.Pierce yelled with all his voice.\u201cSir Adjutant Roan!\u201dRoan had finally finished his retirement and returned to Beno castle.And with the big shot noble Io Lancephil.*****\u2018Is this really a scene in my office?\u2019Gale was astounded.For the past 10 days, Reil and Aaron had stayed in the headquarters of his troop, but even so there was no instance he felt as short of breath as he did now.\u2018Count Io Lancephil.\u2019The pressure a count gave you was amazing.Reil, who was always free and full of playfulness was also a bit nervous.\u2018There\u2019s Count Io Lancephil, Viscount Reil Baker, and Corps Commander Aaron Tate in this small and shabby office.\u2019The reason why they gathered here.Gale slightly turned his head to look at Roan.\u2018He\u2019s becoming more of a big shot every time.\u2019A proud and uneasy feeling.\u2018It feels like he would leave far away like this.\u2019Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cHohoho. So Viscount Baker has come to meet Roan.\u201dHe looked at Roan and nodded.\u2018He certainly is a kid to have interest in.\u2019Io conversed about many things with Roan while traveling to Beno castle.\u2018His thoughts on strategies and tactics were so deep and clear to the point you wouldn\u2019t believe he\u2019s an 18 year old.\u2019Abilities you had to have to become a good commander.\u2018On top of that, his spear skills are also good.\u2019He remembered the sight of Roan massacring 100 goblins in Whose village by himself.Io, then looked at Reil.\u201cSo, how does it feel after you met him yourself?\u201dAt that moment, a strange silence fell on the office.Reil put a weird smile on and looked at Roan.\u2018His body is really good. He has great balance.\u2019But there was a limit as to what he could see with his eyes.The smile on his mouth became denser.\u201cRoan.\u201dA gently calling sound.Reil moved his feet and faced Roan.Naturally, the sights of everyone gathered on him.Gulp.A nervous feeling to the point where it was weird.Reil hit Roan\u2019s chest.\u201cSpar with me.\u201dA really unshapely and direct battle proposition.\u201cHohoho.\u201dIo laughed.\u2018To abruptly propose for a spar. Although Roan\u2019s skills and talent are outstanding in the end, he\u2019s a normal soldier. For Roan, who\u2019s a normal soldier, to face the best spearman like you\u2026\u2026..\u2019When he thought up to that point.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dHe had a calm and clear attitude.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned wide.Even Reil was a bit surprised.\u2018Look at this guy.\u2019His mouth rose.\u2018He doesn\u2019t have any hesitation?\u2019It was pleasurable.This was the first case.His body moved.\u201cReally? Then let\u2019s go to the training field right now.\u201dReil walked one step ahead with an excited look.Roan followed his back without saying anything.After the two people left, an awkward silence fell in the office.\u201cHohoho.\u201dThe thing that broke the silence was Io\u2019s laughter.\u201cWe will see a good spectacle.\u201dHe smiled faintly and moved.Only then did Aaron, Gale, the knights and the adjutants start to move.\u2018A spar so suddenly?\u2019\u2018Will Roan be able to face him?\u2019Even if Roan\u2019s talent was outstanding, he wasn\u2019t an opponent for Reil.Everyone thought like that.Even so, there was some kind of expectation in Aaron\u2019s and Gale\u2019s hearts.\u2018What if Roan wins\u2026\u2026?\u2019The two looked at each other coincidentally.Aaron and Gale understood their thoughts and laughed awkwardly.And then they shook their heads.\u2018But even so, it\u2019s impossible to beat Viscount Reil Baker.\u2019That was the most normal and correct judgement.The steps of the both of them directed to the training field that was at the back of the troop headquarters.*****Roan and Reil.The two of them were facing each other while holding wooden sticks used for training.The surrounding was filled with the soldiers of rose troop that heard the notices and came running.Swish.Roan and Reil took their stances while being five steps away from each other.\u2018It\u2019s a clear posture without flaws.\u2019Reil looked at Roan\u2019s posture and was amazed.\u2018But the feeling is somewhat strange.\u2019A feeling he couldn\u2019t express with words.To find an exact expression.\u2018It kind of feels like it gets blurry.\u2019The sun that shined, the wind that blew, and the trees that slightly shook.It felt like Roan permeated himself in the scenery and became blurry.It was a state that was easy to lose his presence if you didn\u2019t concentrate.\u2018If I slip, the stick may hit my stomach.\u2019Reil took in a deep breath.His five senses became sharper.Actually, the reason why Roan\u2019s presence and intent became blurry was because of Brent\u2019s ring.\u2018I have Brent\u2019s ring with me but\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan looked at Reil and was astounded.Reil certainly didn\u2019t have any artifacts on him.The casual outfit and a shabby wooden stick was everything.But even so, the intent in his eyes was very strange.The tip of the stick emanated a frightening and sharp intent, but aside from that he couldn\u2019t feel anything from his body.Just like.\u2018It feels like only the stick is floating in the air.\u2019Reil was certainly tens of times stronger than Roan while solely looking at spear skills.But even so, there was a reason in which Roan could accept the sparring petition with a calm and composed attitude.\u2018There was a time when Viscount Reil Baker and Pierce sparred in my past life.\u2019But of course the time and situation were all different.In his past life it occurred exactly after 1 year, when Pierce showed his skills in the battle of Int forest and Reil came to see him.At that time, Roan was training with Pierce and because of that he could check everything next to him.\u2018That day is just like today. There was Count Lancephil and Viscount Baker hit Pierce\u2019s chest and asked him to spar once.\u2019Although the time was pulled and the concerned person was him and not Roan, but the start of the battle was the same.This made him think of the past Int forest battle.\u2018A future that\u2019s different in time and situation but the structure itself is the same.\u2019This battle could be the same kind of future as the battle of Int forest.\u2018If perhaps, my guess is true\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He thought of the battle in his past life.He clearly remembered the conversation and the contents they had just like it was yesterday.The day his and Pierce\u2019s life perfectly split.They were memories he couldn\u2019t forget even if he wanted to.Roan gripped the spear tightly.Grip.He felt the rough texture of the wood.\u2018Last time, everyone expected for an overwhelming victory on part of Viscount Baker.\u2019Then the results?\u2018Just like their expectations, Viscount Reil Baker obtained an overwhelming victory\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Pierce from back then, was a normal spearman and didn\u2019t even know mana, but regardless of that they sparred for fifty blows.\u2018Although Viscount Baker faced him in quite a relaxed manner, it was a really shocking result.\u2019Because of that Pierce could become Reil\u2019s disciple.A duke and supreme commander of Rinse kingdom.The start of that road was the spar against Reil.\u2018On top of that, aside from victory and defeat, I can\u2019t miss the opportunity to spar against the best spearman in the country.\u2019The spar Roan was thinking about could be completely different to the one in his memories.But even so, he really wanted to spar with him.\u2018Because I didn\u2019t even have the chance to do so in my past life.\u2019Roan looked at Reil fixedly.\u2018If perhaps, this spar is the one that will happen the next year just like my guess\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Calmness sank into his eyes.\u2018Viscount Baker will laugh brightly\u2026\u2026\u2019And surprisingly, Reil smiled brightly as if he was waiting.\u2018Then he said, \u2018Shall I check your skills?\u2019When he thought like that.\u201cThen, Shall I check your skills?\u201dReil\u2019s voice was heard.A look that coincided with Roan\u2019s thoughts.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan forcefully gulped down the exclamation.His guess was right.This spar was certainly the one Reil and Pierce did in his past life.\u2018Why are you still? Are you scared? Then, should I move first?\u2019His memory was clear.\u201cWhy are you still? Are you scared? Then, should I move first?\u201dThere wasn\u2019t even one mistake.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018From now on, the spear comes piercing against my body. But that\u2019s a feint. Actually, he\u2019s looking to attack my left foot.\u2019Not differently, Reil bent his left knee slightly and quickly stabbed with his stick.A really strong and quick stabbing.Roan focused on the wooden stick and his wrist.The wrist that slightly twisted in front of his stomach.At the same time, the end of the spear fell towards the ground.\u2018It\u2019s the same as my past life.\u2019Roan hurriedly pulled back his left foot.Tang!Reil\u2019s spear hit the ground.\u201cOho! You are good?\u201dA humorous voice.However, amazement was seen in Reil\u2019s eyes.\u2018You dodged this?\u2019His mouth slightly rose.\u2018Then, should I play earnestly?\u2019Reil smiled brightly once more and swung his spear.Roan fell back and lowered his body.The trace of the spear filled his sight.But he didn\u2019t become astounded.\u2018Although it\u2019s not that I remember all the attacks\u2026\u2026.\u2019He remembered the first and the last 50th attack clearly.\u2018If Pierce from back then could face him, then the me from right now also can.\u2019At least, the Roan from now was stronger than Pierce from back then.On top of that, if his guess was right Reil wouldn\u2019t even have put strength into his attacks.\u2018I just have to endure until the 50th blow.\u2019The last blow Roan was thinking about was the 51st one.It was the next blow which Pierce couldn\u2019t block and was done in.\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tadak! Tadak! Tak!Continued by that, sounds of heavy blows were heard.The hard wooden sticks for practice split the air without stopping.\u2018Is, is it even?\u2019\u2018Roan has equal skills with Viscount Reil Baker?\u2019The soldiers surrounding the practice field opened their eyes roundly.They also knew that Roan\u2019s spear skills were outstanding.But his opponent was the best spearman in Rinse kingdom and the one called spear genius.\u201cEy. Viscount Baker is going easy on him.\u201dThe mumblings of a soldier.The soldiers around him nodded unconsciously.Meanwhile, the battle was facing its conclusion.Reil\u2019s stick twisted like a snake and tried to stab Roan\u2019s side.It was a fast and strange attack.However Roan wasn\u2019t perplexed.He stamped the floor with the stick and twisted his upper body to the side.Spat!Reil\u2019s stick missed its target and stabbed the empty air.Roan hit the stick that was on the ground with the back of his feet as if he was waiting for it.Paat!The stick drew a line along with sharp sound and surged up to attack Reil\u2019s chin.\u2018He\u2019s good.\u2019Reil smiled at Roan\u2019s sharp attack and took one step back.Spat!Roan\u2019s stick passed in front of his nose.A movement just enough to barely dodge the stick.It was the perfect distance.\u2018Amazing.\u2019Roan was astounded.Reil was really relaxed even in the middle of this fierce battle.\u2018Having looked at him from the side and facing him directly is certainly different.\u2019In his past life, the confrontation between Reil and Pierce, where he watched from the sideline, was as beautiful as a dance.The spear drew lines and the both of them repeated closing in and backing up.The sound of the sticks hitting each other and cutting through the air was heard as music.\u2018That was the day I saw Pierce\u2019s real look, which I couldn\u2019t see because I was too close.\u2019In his past life, Roan and Pierce started together from the training camp and spent 2 years together.At first, Roan took care of the shy and timid Pierce.Although all the trainers and the seniors of the troop raised their thumbs saying that Pierce\u2019s talent was the best, at that time Roan was full of confidence.\u2018I also thought that there was nothing I couldn\u2019t do.\u2019However, everything changed after meeting Reil.Pierce, who was shy and timid, became one of the most influential people that would be able to lead the kingdom\u2019s future after the confrontation against Reil.Pierce became Reil\u2019s disciple just like that and left his side.And.\u2018When we met again he became a vice corps commander, and I was still a normal spearman.\u2019Roan and Pierce.The lives of the two people, who were almost equal, started to change after this confrontation.\u2018That\u2019s why I can\u2019t forget it even if I want to.\u2019He had a bitter smile.Roan bit his lower lip.He wasn\u2019t in a situation to be reminiscing about things from the past.The attacks continued without letting him rest.\u2018My breath is getting heavy.\u2019If there seemed to be a weak point, Reil\u2019s stick closed in on it stubbornly.Tak! Tadak! Tak!A light sound.It certainly was a difficult situation, but Roan didn\u2019t get pushed back.No, rather, he was even with Reil.Although he couldn\u2019t use the mana because of the gazes of other people, with Kalian\u2019s tear and his strong body, the tip of the stick moved sharply and elegantly.Spat!Roan\u2019s spear cut through the air and started to make big movements.He was now executing Pierce\u2019s spearmanship, which was now Roan\u2019s spearmanship.\u2018So this is Roan\u2019s spearmanship.\u2019Reil\u2019s mouth slightly rose up.\u2018It certainly is different than what Pierce executed.\u2019Even if Pierce was a genius, it had only been two months since he started training in Roan\u2019s spearmanship.Compared to that, Roan already had more than 10 years.His spear twisted and looked for Reil\u2019s: arms, legs, stomach, private parts and joints.Everything was deadly and vital.\u2018Kugh.\u2019Reil grinded his teeth for the first time.It was because Roan\u2019s attack was much sharper than what he had initially thought.\u2018If I keep being relaxed, I might face an embarrassing situation?\u2019Reil put strength in his grip and charged forward.His defensive attacks changed to become offensive ones.Tang! Tadang!Even the sound of the clashes became different.\u2018Kugh.\u2019Every time the spears clashed, his palm became numb.\u2018He\u2019s planning to end it now.\u2019Roan grinded his teeth.The number of blows had already reached 40.\u2018Whew!\u2019Roan let out a long sigh.Actually for him, this battle had much meaning.\u2018From the many futures, there\u2019s one that always happens, no matter what I do.\u2019Int\u2019s forest battle was like that, and this battle was also the same.\u2018In the battle of Int forest, the time and the troops participating were different than my past life\u2026\u2026..\u2019When the orc that came charging forward but fell because of a branch, it coincided perfectly with his past life.Although it seems like I have the advantage because I know the future, the events are\u2026.Reality wasn\u2019t like that at all.\u2018What if there aren\u2019t changes even in the results?\u2019What if the ones that should die, died, and the ones who should live, lived?What if everything flowed like a preconceived result?What if in the end, he ends up dying in the battlefield just like his past life?\u2018The results of right now has no meaning at all.\u2019But of course, it wasn\u2019t that the future had to happen as he knew it.The slightly different future just like the Prely river battle, and Slen battle that weren\u2019t in the future at all.\u2018If my guess is correct\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019In the future he would face from now on, there would be many of these types of cases.The cases he knew in the future, and the same cases.Slightly different cases.Completely different cases.Cases he didn\u2019t know about, etc.Various different types of the future were mixed together causing uncertainty and were also approaching closer.\u2018Because of that, I don\u2019t know if the situations that I am aware of will happen exactly like in my past life.\u2019That\u2019s why he wanted to check it.When Reil requested a battle after hitting his chest.\u2018I really got my act together.\u2019The battle against Reil and Pierce that he remembered.The start of it was certainly the same.\u2018Will I be able to change the results of this battle?\u2019If he could, there was no need to be afraid of the incoming future.\u2018I can\u2019t keep relying on the future I know.\u2019On top of that, the thing called the future was really uncertain.He was at a point where he could rely on it passively but had to actively take the initiative.Because of that, this battle against Reil was really important.\u2018I will crush all the different futures where the results are already pre-determined.\u2019Then, a sharp sound was heard.Spat!The spear drew a line and flew towards him.Roan took two steps back and twisted his wrist.Tang!The spears collided against each other.\u201cAmazing. I had quite the fun time, sparring.\u201dThis was Reil\u2019s voice.Roan gritted his teeth.\u201cBlock this one too.\u201dThey were some lightly tossed words.The battle was coming to an end.In his past life, Pierce couldn\u2019t block the last attack and lost.\u2018I will block it. I will block it and change the future.\u2019Roan opened his two eyes abruptly.Paat!In that instant, the surrounding scenery and spar became slow in Roan\u2019s eyes.Meanwhile, only Reil showed any fast movements.Spaaaaaat!The spear closed in while it cut through the air.He could see that the tip of the spear vibrated in all directions.At first glance it seemed like it was aiming for his stomach but actually it was a continuous attack followed by the two thighs, sides, and back.Roan glared at the tip of his spear and turned his body.Everything was really slow to the point where he yawned.At the same time, Reil\u2019s spear lowered and aimed for the thigh.\u2018Hph!\u2019Roan took in a breath and charged forward.Spaaaaaat!Reil\u2019s spear slightly grazed Roan\u2019s thigh.But the attack didn\u2019t end there.Tuk.The spear stopped like it was all a lie, surged up, and then twisted.It was a movement aimed at the sides.\u2018Quicker!\u2019Roan felt trapped because of his slow movements.He turned his body and closed in on Reil.A perplexed look could be seen on Reil.Taaaaat!Roan passed by Reil\u2019s body like that and made it to his back. At the same time, he tried to kick Reil\u2019s ankle. The movement was executed perfectly and everything flowed together.\u2018It\u2019s done!\u2019A faint smile appeared on Roan\u2019s face.Then!Reil\u2019s two feet, that were solidly stuck to the ground, started to float in the air.\u2018Impossible!\u2019Roan looked at himself kicking the empty air and frowned.He thought that it was the perfect attack.\u2018What kind of reaction is this fast!\u2019Then, he felt a pain as if someone was poking his eyes with a needle.It was because he had used Kalian\u2019s tear over-excessively.However, Roan endured it and swung his spear.Paaaat!The spear moved through the air very slowly.After a while.Puuuuuk!The tip of the spear hit Reil\u2019s back.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Only then did Roan blink once.Pat!At that moment, the scenery that was slow until now returned to its original speed.Tat!Reil, who jumped to the air, turned his body with the spear.He made some distance with Roan in an instant.\u201cKugh.\u201dPain was felt in his back.\u2018What the hell just happened?\u2019Reil frowned.He executed one of his own spearmanship techniques that he had saved to finish the spar.He thought that with Roan\u2019s skills he would be able to either dodge or block the attack that was aimed for the thigh.\u2018But I thought that he would fall by the following attack.\u2019His guess was wrong in a way that was good to see.But it wasn\u2019t to the point it completely slipped away from him.Roan showed quick movements to the point that it was surprising and then closed in on Reil.At the same time, he turned his body. After that he was at his back he tried to kick him.Reil kicked the ground and jumped away instinctively.However, he couldn\u2019t block the attack that followed.\u2018If this was a real battle, my back would have deep cut into it.\u2019Reil glanced at Roan.\u2018I can\u2019t measure his skills.\u2019He thought that he had measured Roan\u2019s skills to a certain point during the spar.But the moment he thought of the last attack, Roan showed skills beyond his estimation.He was truly amazed.\u201cAre you also able to blo\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe moment that he was planning to compliment him.Pat!Roan charged through and faced him with a fierce intent.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Reil gulped some air and raised his spear.Offense and defense happened again.From now on, it was something Roan also faced for the first time.It was a battle that didn\u2019t happen in his past life.\u2018I\u2019m changing the results!\u2019Just because the situation changed a bit, he couldn\u2019t be relieved.This was because the future was still uncertain.\u2018A blitz warfare!\u2019From now on, he couldn\u2019t use Kalian\u2019s tear for a while.Tak! Tadak! Tak!The clashing sounds filled the training room.The fierce attacks continued.\u201cAmazing.\u201dIo mumbled with a surprised expression.The people around him nodded in agreement.They were surprised at two things.The first, obviously was Reil\u2019s spear skills.\u2018The skills of Viscount Baker is really famous\u2026..\u2019But what was even more surprising was Roan\u2019s spear skills.\u2018For the skills of an 18 year old spearman to be this high.\u2019Io was amazed.A faint expectation appeared in his face.\u2018The one who will continue the legacy of Viscount Baker, no, he may become a commander that surpasses him.\u2019Io\u2019s mouth slightly rose up.\u2018If he teaches him well from now on, he will certainly\u2026\u2026.\u2019The deeper his thoughts grew, the closer the battle approached the climax.Roan put strength into his grip.\u2018Let\u2019s end it with this.\u2019He was planning on executing the 7th stance of Roan\u2019s spearmanship.This was the strong technique that stabbed the spear on Violin\u2019s side.\u2018Hph!\u2019He took in a deep breath.The muscles on both of his arms swelled.Spat!The spear split the wind.At the same time, the entire spear moved to the sides.\u2018Is this also Roan\u2019s spearmanship?\u2019Reil looked at the gorgeously moving spear, to the point that it made him dizzy, and smiled.He wasn\u2019t certain if he was aiming for the left or the right because of the big movements.\u2018Is it the left or the right?\u2019Reil glared at the tip of the spear and then twisted his wrist.The place he tried to block was his left side.Then.Tung!The spear hit the air as if it was flicking along a heavy sound.The tip of the spear suddenly changed trajectory and came carving into Reil\u2019s right side.\u2018Amazing!\u2019It was an extraordinary change.Reil hurriedly pulled back his spear and twisted his body.Then.\u2018Kugh!\u2019He felt a pain in his back.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He was surprised with Roan\u2019s attack.Because of this moment\u2019s discomfort, his movements were slow.\u2018My ribs will be smashed.\u2019Reil bit his lower lip.At this state, he wouldn\u2019t be able to block the spear, nor dodge it.\u2018Roan. I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019He bitterly smiled and took in a deep breath.In that instant, a soft feeling surged up from his stomach.Paaaat!At the same time, the spear split the air at an amazing speed.Reil\u2019s spear hit Roan\u2019s spear.Pagak!A sharp sound.Roan\u2019s spear broke in a way that was easy to see.\u201cKugh!\u201dRoan grinded his teeth at the amazing shock that was felt and quickly spread out from his palms.But even so, he didn\u2019t let go of his spear.\u2018Is it mana\u2026\u2026?\u2019He guessed the identity of the strength that surged up from his body in an instant.\u201cKugh.\u201dHis body trembled.Viscount Baker showed his amazing strength, worthy of being a man of his reputation.\u2018So this is Viscount Reil Baker\u2019s real strength.\u2019The difference in having mana and not having mana was certainly big.\u2018What would have happened if I also used the Flamdor mana technique?\u2019He would have succeeded in that last attack.Regret was left.\u2018But even so, I have to hide my mana.\u2019He had just started training in it.If he made a mistake and rumours spread, he would have his mana technique taken away from him even before he reached the peak.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh.\u2018Does it end like this\u2026\u2026?\u2019Roan looked at his broken spear and shook his head.Then, Reil\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe bitterly smiled and slowly walked up.And surprisingly enough, he slightly bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s my defeat.\u201dThis was a sudden declaration of defeat.The soldiers who were around the training ground had surprised expressions on their faces.\u201cHe lost?\u201d\u201cViscount Reil Baker lost?\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201dThey couldn\u2019t understand.The one with the broken spear was Roan and not Reil.On the other side Io, Aaron, the knights, and etc. nodded at Reil\u2019s declaration of defeat.\u2018He even used mana while facing a normal soldier, so it\u2019s right that it\u2019s his defeat.\u2019Io had a faint smile and nodded his head.Everyone was thinking the same thing.They didn\u2019t know the truth; Roan was currently learning a mana technique.\u2018Even so, he\u2019s the real thing.\u2019Io\u2019s sight moved to Roan.He had the skills to evenly fight against the spear genius Reil, and the outstanding strategies and tactics he showed in the battles.\u2018He said he was only 18. Then\u2026\u2026..\u2019Many plans were being set up in his head.On the other side, Roan was a bit perplexed at Reil\u2019s sudden defeat declaration.\u201cNo. The one that lost is m\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan, who was raising his broken spear, staggered.It seemed like the mana Reil put in his body still remained inside him.Reil hurriedly grabbed Roan\u2019s hand and supported him.\u201cThe internal shock would have been greater.\u201dReil awkwardly smiled and grabbed Roan\u2019s wrist.He was planning to calm his interior when it was a mess.\u201cI\u2019m, i\u2019m fin\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan hurriedly tried to pull away his wrist, but he couldn\u2019t beat Reil\u2019s strength.Then.\u201cHuh?!\u201dReil, who was inserting mana through the tip of his finger, had a surprised expression and looked at Roan.And then, he shook his head as if it was astonishing.\u201cYou were more of an amazing guy than what I initially thought.\u201dHe whispered in a really low voice in Roan\u2019s ear.\u201cI will keep it a secret for now.\u201dRoan bitterly smiled.Because he knew what Reil was talking about.\u201cInstead, you will have to speak with me.\u201dRoan just nodded instead of replying back.Reil was still holding onto his wrist.And then, he was astounded.\u2018A normal soldier is accumulating mana inside his body?\u2019Reil fixedly looked into Roan\u2019s eyes.\u2018He gets funnier the more I know about him.\u2019He had a thought that the things that would happen from now on, they were going to even more fun.And that feeling got it exactly right.\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 60 - A new start (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWaaaa!\u201dThe training field was just like a celebratory party.The soldiers, who were watching at the spar while holding their breaths, couldn\u2019t hold it any more and yelled.Even if Reil was considered a hero in Rinse kingdom, Roan was their fellow soldier and a good friend.That\u2019s why they could only get excited at Reil\u2019s declaration of defeat.\u201cWaaa! Certainly, sir adjutant Roan!\u201d\u201cRoan! Roan! Roan! Roan! \u201c\u201cWaaa! Sir adjutant Roan was my predecessor!\u201d\u201cKuha! He certainly is the pride of our 13th squad!\u201d\u201cI knew that he would become big!\u201dThe people with the biggest voices even in the middle of the cheering, they were the 13th squad that served with Roan before it became the 12th squad.Vice squad commander Austin of the 12th squad and the commander of the 13th squad, Tane, were shaking hands while they were beaming.\u201cWuooooooo! Roan! Roan! Roan! Roan! \u201cThe noisiest one was Pete, of the 13th squad.He cheered Roan with a voice as loud as his body was big.\u201cYou sure are popular.\u201dReil smiled brightly and hit Roan\u2019s shoulder.Roan just smiled awkwardly instead of replying back.Then Aaron, Gale, etc., approached him with Io at the front.\u201cIt was an amazing spar.\u201dIo complemented Reil first and then looked at Roan.It kind of felt like he wasn\u2019t interested in Reil.\u2018For the man that sang the Baker, Baker, Baker song to be like that\u2026\u2026..\u2019Albert, who was looking at the sides, was astounded.\u201cRoan. It really was an amazing fight.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan bowed deeply.\u2018Kugh.\u2019As the internal shock wasn\u2019t completely gone, the state of his body wasn\u2019t that good.\u2018If Viscount Baker showed all of his skills\u2026\u2026..\u2019He knew that Reil had held himself back in this fight.If he didn\u2019t do so, this battle wouldn\u2019t have flowed in a normal way in the first place.\u201cRest for now, and then let\u2019s talk.\u201dIo was very leisurely and benign.\u2018What\u2019s more precious and doesn\u2019t return is time. And rather than that time, he\u2019s someone I don\u2019t want to let go.\u2019Roan was someone he didn\u2019t want to let go.\u2018Perhaps even more so than Viscount Baker.\u2019His mouth slightly rose up.\u201cRoan! Roan! Roan! Roan! \u201c\u201cRose! Rose! Rose! Rose!\u201dThe soldiers surrounding the training field yelled with all of their strength.Now, for them, Roan was a hero as amazing as Reil.But of course he still had many things to do until he became a real hero.*****Roan could stay in a lodging all alone because of Gale\u2019s efforts.When he was still settling down in his imperfect interior, footsteps were heard outside the door.\u2018He came.\u2019Roan put his mana in order and stood up.As he stood in front of the entrance, the sounds of the footsteps stopped.Kiiig.The creaking of the wood was heard when the door opened.\u201cOh! You were waiting for me?\u201dIt was a familiar voice.It was Reil.He closed the door and walked in.\u201cHow\u2019s your body?\u201dAt the question, Roan faintly smiled and nodded.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dAt that instant, Reil checked him with his eyes.\u201cYou are okay? Does that mean that things such as my spearmanship isn\u2019t that much?\u201d\u201cN, no.\u201dAs Roan shook his head with a perplexed expression, Reil burst out in laughter.\u201cHahahaha. It\u2019s a joke. A joke.\u201dAnd then, he sat down in a chair.\u201cThen, shall we talk?\u201dReil had a weird expression.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan sat at the opposite side and nodded.\u201cYou learned mana, right?\u201dReil, went directly to the point.Roan replied with a calm expression.\u201cYes. I did.\u201d\u201cSo I was right.\u201dReil put on a faint smile.He looked at Roan while crossing his arms.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long since you learned it?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s been about a month.\u201d\u201cThen that means that you learned it during your retirement.\u201dThe smile on Reil\u2019s face became even bigger.Roan just looked at Reil\u2019s eyes.\u2018Is it time he asked me how I learned it?\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019He had already prepared an answer in advance.\u2018I learned it from a retired soldier.\u2019It was the answer he used when Tane, the commander of the 13th squad, asked him where he learned his spear skills after he observed Roan.The first time it was about fate helping by giving him a retired soldier who taught him the spear in his childhood. This time it was about him learning mana.But rather because it was too obvious, there was no space to doubt it.\u2018How many retired soldiers, knights, and powerful hidden people are there\u2026\u2026.\u2019But of course, learning spear skills and mana from one of those people was quite a scarce difficult thing to actually do.But even so, it wasn\u2019t impossible.\u2018Now, ask me quickly.\u2019Roan was prepared to answer.However, Reil just spat out strange words.\u201cBut your mana technique is quite peculiar.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know it well but it feels like it\u2019s not stable.\u201dWhen he grabbed Roan\u2019s wrist to calm down the internal shock, Reil could certainly feel it.\u2018It had a feeling like many different natures were mixed into it.\u2019But what was fortunate was that one energy was really rough and active and the other energy was was calm and still.Because of that, the energies weren\u2019t hitting or clashing against each other yet.\u2018Was it originally this kind of mana?\u2019Reil looked at Roan well.And Roan also had a confused face.\u2018It seems like he\u2019s not even conscious of it. Then, that means that it\u2019s not that big of a problem\u2026\u2026.\u2019Reil took in a deep breath.If by chance the energies collided against each other, it may not simply end at him losing his mana.\u2018He may become disabled.\u2019Roan, who has outstanding talent, become disabled?Reil wanted to block at least that much.\u201cHow did you learn the mana technique?\u201dIt was a question thrown out to exactly grasp the situation that doesn\u2019t have any rebellious intent.Roan brought forth the answer that he had prepared.\u201cI learned it from a retired soldier.\u201dFor a while, Roan narrated the story that he had created a while ago.Reil slowly nodded.\u2018I don\u2019t know the skills of that retired soldier, but the mana technique may be unstable by itself.\u2019He bit his lower lip.\u2018I will have to keep checking up on him for now.\u2019There was nothing that he could do right now.Reil forced a laugh and looked at Roan.\u201cThen, Roan\u2019s spearmanship is also\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. I learned it from the retired soldier. As it didn\u2019t have a name, I put in my name.\u201dRoan shyly laughed and bowed.\u2018Pierce, i\u2019m sorry.\u2019But even so it was Roan that had some considerations.\u201cI would also like to meet that retired soldier once.\u201dLooking at the level of Roan\u2019s spearmanship and the fact that he had learned mana from him, he certainly wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary soldier.His warrior\u2019s curiosity surged up.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. He tends to move around quite a bit so I don\u2019t know his precise location.\u201d\u201cHm. Can\u2019t do anything about it then.\u201dReil shook his hand as if it was okay and nodded.It was up to there.Reil didn\u2019t ask anymore about questions related to the mana or the spear.\u2018There\u2019s no need to ask anymore.\u2019In the first place, this was what Reil\u2019s personality was like.The current state was what was important and not who taught him, when, where and how.On top of that.\u201cI will keep it a secret for now.\u201dHe decided to keep his mouth shut about Roan learning mana.\u2018There\u2019s no need for me to spread it when he himself is trying to hide it. On top of that, he has just started to learn it. If rumours were to spread, he may be targeted by people that wanted the mana technique.\u2019But there was only one thing he had to be certain about.\u2018The possibility of being a spy.\u2019But that possibility was really low.\u2018According to the words of Duke Tate, he had already investigated him once.\u2019But even if he was still uneasy, he just had to check the information of the kingdom or ask a request to the thieves guild.Reil looked at Roan.\u2018Whatever it is, it would be good if he grew quickly.\u2019His thoughts were rather fixed in a weird way.\u2018Only then will we be able to spar again.\u2019Reil was a real warrior.He was expecting for Roan\u2019s mana technique and spear skills to grow a lot more compared to now.\u2018I was too bored until now.\u2019There weren\u2019t many opponents for him in Rinse kingdom.The knights and magicians didn\u2019t suit him in temperament or what they did.\u2018Even so\u2026\u2026\u2019He felt regret.\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable.\u201dHis thoughts popped up unconsciously.\u201cWhat is?\u201dAs Roan carefully asked, Reil let out a short sigh.\u201cWhew. Because you learned another mana technique\u2026\u2026\u201dHis last words dimmed a bit.Roan just waited for the next words.\u201cI can\u2019t formally take you in as a disciple.\u201dReil smacked his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s really something to say this right in front of you but I quite like you.\u201dBut of course, that wasn\u2019t the only reason.\u2018If I taught him myself, he would be able to grow more quickly.\u2019Then, he would be able to properly battle a little bit quicker. But he couldn\u2019t formally take in someone who learned another mana technique, as a disciple of the Baker family.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.\u2018Did I get recognized by Viscount Reil Baker?\u2019A corner of his heart became numb with pride.In his past life, he couldn\u2019t even get a glance from Reil.But right now, Reil wanted to take him in as a formal disciple.Reil continued speaking.\u201cBecause formal disciples of the Baker family have to learn the Baker mana technique.\u201dRoan just nodded.Becoming a formal disciple of a family meant that the first thing you had to do was to learn the traditional mana technique of the family.But although not every family was like that, that was the common practice and custom.\u201cBut even if that\u2019s the case, I can\u2019t ask you to forget the mana technique you already learned.\u201dReil smacked his lips.Roan put on a smile.\u2018I can\u2019t give up on the mana technique of the fire monarch Reid. And\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019His eyes became calm.\u2018Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, I can\u2019t become your disciple.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.In the first place, he wasn\u2019t planning on becoming his disciple.No, precisely speaking he couldn\u2019t.\u2018I can\u2019t leave this place for the moment.\u2019Roan had many things he had to do from now on.He had to have a solid start for his future actions.They were very important things.\u2018I don\u2019t know if you would stay here and teach me yourself\u2026\u2026\u2019It was impossible to leave for Reil\u2019s territory.But even so, Reil also couldn\u2019t keep roaming around in the eastern territory of the kingdom while leaving his own territory empty.In the end it became a situation where Roan couldn\u2019t become Reil\u2019s disciple.\u201cRegrettable. Too regrettable.\u201dReil continued to smack his lips and shook his head.Then, Roan\u2019s mouth slightly rose up.\u2018Should I tell him now?\u2019The solid starting point for the future.And it was one of the most important things even amongst them.Roan whispered in a low voice.\u201cIf it is okay with you, may I recommend you a soldier?\u201d\u201cRecommend?\u201dReil had an interested expression.\u2018Mmm. Recommend\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He had already checked his outstanding abilities but he didn\u2019t know about his eyes in judging people.\u2018Well, it isn\u2019t bad to hear you out for now.\u2019Reil slowly nodded.Roan brightly smiled and continued saying.\u201cThe soldier I want to recommend\u2026\u2026..\u201dStrength was put in his voice.\u201cIs spearman Pierce from rose troop of the 7th corps.\u201d*****\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to!\u201dIt was a rough voice and one with a firm attitude.You could see in Pierce\u2019s attitude and expression his absolute intention to decline.\u201cPierce. Do you know just how amazing of an opp\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan said as if he was easing him up but.\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to leave your side.\u201dPierce cut off his words right from the start.Roan had a troubled expression on his face.It was an expression of various mixed emotions.\u2018It\u2019s stifling but at the same time proud.\u2019Looking at Pierce wanting to remain at his side whatever happened, he really felt great.But even so, he couldn\u2019t leave him at his side.\u2018Pierce. You have to become Viscount Baker\u2019s disciple.\u2019Roan was planning to send Pierce towards Reil.\u2018And fortunately, the viscount also sees you in a good light.\u2019It was after Reil had personally checked Pierce\u2019s talent in the 10 days he spent at Beno castle.He was rather surprised and happy as his thoughts coincided with Roan\u2019s.\u2018There\u2019s no way for Viscount Baker to not recognize your skills.\u2019Roan pulled up Pierce who had a cold and hard expression and sat him down in the chair in front of him.\u201cPierce.\u201dHe called out in a low calling voice.Pierce just turned his head away instead of replying back.It meant that he didn\u2019t want to talk.\u2018I also have it more comfortable if you are by my side.\u2019Pierce was picked to be the one with the best talent in all of history.He became a supreme commander after having climbed up to become a duke in his past life.He was one of the existences that lead Rinse kingdom to prominence.That existence was Pierce.He really wanted to leave him by his side and take care of him so that no one could steal him away from Roan.However, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make Pierce\u2019s real talent bloom that way.\u2018You have to learn spear skills from Viscount Baker. Only then will you become the spear genius from my memories.\u2019He looked at Pierce\u2019s face fixedly.He was still dodging his sight with a stiffened expression.\u201cPierce. Do you remember what I told you last time?\u201dA sudden story.Pierce, who was resolved to not converse at all, slightly turned away.An expression implying what he meant.Roan smiled faintly and said.\u201cThe day when the two of us remained when of all the others went on vacation.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dPierce let out a low exclamation.Roan continued saying.\u201cThat time you told me. That I will become a great general that makes the continent tremble.\u201d\u201cYes. I certainly did so.\u201dPierce unconsciously nodded and replied back.Roan brightly smiled and asked in return.\u201cSo what did I tell you then?\u201dAt that instant, Pierce flinched.It was a memory that he couldn\u2019t forget.As he hesitated, Roan continued saying.\u201cThat if I become a great commander, you will become the best spearman in the continent. I certainly said so.\u201dRoan took in a deep breath.\u201cI still haven\u2019t changed my mind about that. Pierce, if it\u2019s your talent you will certainly be able to become the best spearman in the continent.\u201dHe had eyes that don\u2019t even have the slightest movement.Pierce\u2019s heart began to beat faster.Roan started to put in more and more strength in his voice.\u201cPierce. I will work hard to become a great general that makes the continent tremble.\u201dIt was a declaration.It was a really bold one.It wasn\u2019t something a mere class 5 adjutant should be saying.But even so, Roan\u2019s eyes and expression was still serious.\u2018Actually, i\u2019m planning to become a monarch\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019He wasn\u2019t in a situation to be able to say that yet. Roan continued saying.\u201cIf I become a great commander, i\u2019m planning to use you as a general as promised.

The eastern territory is my territory.\u2019The face of the man stiffened.He was a middle aged man with a large build.He was the commander of the eastern region of Rinse kingdom, Viscount Benjamin Doyle.Then from the other side, a cunning voice could be heard.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to step out for things like this\u2026\u2026\u201dThe owner of the voice was Baron Ive Lever, who was a staff officer that had the rank of a corps commander and was close to Benjamin.He was putting on a smile as cunning as his voice.\u201cNo. I have to certainly press him down at this opportunity.\u201d\u201cViscount Baker is only a skilled spearman. He doesn\u2019t even have a force at his side, so why are you this worried?\u201dHe made a stupid sound.Benjamin\u2019s eyes became fierce.\u201cDon\u2019t say such comfortable things. There are countless people that would gather below him if he just raises his flag.\u201dHe clenched his fists.\u201cNow is the only opportunity to press him down.\u201dIf he raised a disciple or obtained a territory, it was obvious that his forces would grow at an amazing speed.\u2018If that happens, it would be dangerous for me.\u2019Benjamin took in a deep breath.\u2018I have to make the corps commander stand by my side at this opportunity.\u2019He needed to have a starting point which Reil wouldn\u2019t even be able to touch.A dense desire appeared in Benjamin\u2019s eyes.******\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it. The position of your foot is wrong.\u201dReil moved around busily and yelled.He was checking on the training of the soldiers of rose troop while they were on the training field.\u201cYou have to twist your wrist there.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dThe soldiers were putting in a lot of effort.\u2018When will we be able to receive teachings from Viscount Baker!\u2019\u2018I have to learn all that I can!\u2019Their gazes were naturally directed to the front.There was a youth with a childish face who trained just like them at the front.\u2018This is all because of sir adjutant Roan.\u2019\u2018Sir adjutant begged Viscount Baker himself.\u2019The reason why the soldiers could receive Reil\u2019s teachings.That was because of Roan.Actually, Reil already planned to teach Roan some important things before he returned to his territory.Although he couldn\u2019t take in him as a formal disciple because of the mana technique, he couldn\u2019t just leave an outstanding talent alone.In Roan\u2019s case, if he fixed his many bad habits he had and altered some sloppy parts, he would be able to raise to a greater level than now.Because of that, he followed Roan all day and taught him this and that.And Roan realized that Reil\u2019s teachings were quite an important thing.At the same time, he thought that he didn\u2019t want to receive the teachings alone. Instead he wanted to do it with the soldiers of rose troop.Roan carefully revealed his thoughts and Reil accepted them with pleasure.Because of that, the soldiers experienced an exciting situation that they normally wouldn\u2019t be able to have even once in their lives.\u201cNow! Let\u2019s do it from the start!\u201dReil clapped and encouraged the soldiers.\u201cGood. You have to do it like that!\u201dWhether he complimented them.\u201cYou have to step a bit more to the left when you do that.\u201dOr he gave them advice.\u201cAgain! It\u2019s all wrong!\u201dOr he became angry.Reil passionately taught the soldiers.\u201cMmm.\u201dHis sight moved towards Roan.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation flowed out.\u2018He certainly became better.\u2019Originally, Roan didn\u2019t have many useless movements in his spear skills.But even so, there were still some lacking points in Reil\u2019s eyes.He showed Roan some postures of himself, and Roan fixed them.And the effects appeared on the spot.\u2018Do I have to say that his eyes are good?\u2019Roan had an ability to not miss even the slightest movements.Actually, Reil didn\u2019t know it, but Roan\u2019s ability was thanks to Kalian\u2019s tear.\u2018I get to see many more things in a short moment because of Kalian\u2019s tear.\u2019Even if Reil made a small movement, he could grasp all of the information like: the position of the wrist, the foot, the twisting of the joints, etc.\u2018Because of that, I get to know how to make a proper and precise stance.\u2019Roan ground his teeth.Spat!The spear cut through the air and moved.\u2018It certainly became more comfortable.\u2019He had only changed some small movements, but swinging and stabbing the spear became much more comfortable.\u2018I have to learn all that I can before Viscount Baker leaves.\u2019Roan was even more passionate than Reil.Although he couldn\u2019t become his formal disciple, he tried extremely hard to properly learn even a single stance.Spat!His spear cut through the air again.*****\u201cBaron Tate, nowadays you would feel full even if you didn\u2019t eat anything.\u201d\u201cHahaha. Honestly speaking, it is a bit assuring.\u201dAaron faintly smiled and nodded.He was facing Io and conversed with him.\u2018To have the opportunity to talk with Count Lancephil for such a long while.\u2019He was noble that had only five such similar nobles in the kingdom.For Aaron, who was only a baron, he was an existence that was really difficult to see.On top of that, it was almost impossible to get closer to him with only conversing.\u2018It\u2019s already been four days since we were together.\u2019This was all for Roan.\u2018It seems like he has fun when he talks about Roan.\u2019Io stayed in the headquarters of rose troop and talked about many things with Roan at his side.Tactics and strategies were obvious, but they also talked about their own lives.\u2018I have to get in his eyes in this opportunity.\u2019Aaron bit his lower lip.If he could do so, he could gain a rock solid background into the kingdom.\u201cHow long is Count Lancephil planning to stay in the kingdom?\u201d\u201cMmm. I wonder\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIo\u2019s last words dimmed.Even if he didn\u2019t do so, he was already worried about that part.\u2018I was planning to return to Pavor castle after meeting with Viscount Baker\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019His first objective was returning to the castle after taking Reil.But now, he was pouring more interest in Roan rather than Reil.But even so, he couldn\u2019t leave his territory empty.\u2018It would be good to move when Viscount Baker also leaves.\u2019He wanted to take Roan with him, but there was something called procedures in the army.\u2018I could also invite Roan later.\u2019Before that, he was planning to raise their intimacy.\u201cProbably ten\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he talked up to then, a knock was heard.Knock. Knock. Knock.\u201cIt\u2019s Mendel.\u201dThe owner of the voice was the closest one to Aaron and the eldest among the staff officers.\u201cCome in.\u201dAaron slightly smiled towards Io and then looked at the entrance.Kiig.The door carefully opened and Mendel showed up with a perplexed expression.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAt the question, Mendel bowed down.\u201cThe gift you asked for has just arrived.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dA low exclamation came out of Aaron\u2019s mouth.He brightly smiled and nodded.\u201cIt came at a suitable time.\u201dHis voice was a bit excited.But Mendel still had a perplexed expression.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t finish his words and hesitated.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u2026.?\u201dAs Aaron asked back, Mendel let out a short sigh.\u201cWhew. The commander of the eastern region, Viscount Benjamin Doyle, has brought the gift himself.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAaron frowned.\u2018Viscount Doyle moved by himself?\u2019Something he had never thought about had just occurred.Benjamin was originally someone with a heavy butt.Aaron\u2019s face stiffened.\u2018It\u2019s because of Viscount Baker.\u2019Benjamin not liking Reil was a fact that was well known.\u2018If I make a mistake, a disorder may hap\u2026\u2026\u2019When he thought up to this part.Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much.\u201dHe also knew a lot about how Benjamin was thinking about Reil.But there was no need to worry.Io brightly smiled and continued saying.\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dAlthough Benjamin was the commander of the eastern region, he wouldn\u2019t be able to act as he wished in front of a count.The smile on his mouth became even more dense.*****Benjamin was really displeased.\u2018I\u2019m here but they don\u2019t even come to greet me?\u2019This was the arrival of a commander.They had just sent a staff officer that was called Mendel.\u2018He wouldn\u2019t already have connoted to that Reil, right?\u2019His face stiffened.Ive, who was looking at the side, shook his head with a cunning expression.\u201cBaron Tate is really bad mannered.\u201dIt was a sound that scratched your insides.Benjamin tightly bit his lower lip.\u2018I will have to properly scold him.\u2019He was planning to show his imposing self.\u2018I will make him realize where the 7th corps is from.\u2019Benjamin and Reil.He was planning to clearly show him who he had to serve between him and Reil.Then, Mendel who was walking in front, stepped aside and bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dIt was quite a shabby and small entrance.This was Gale\u2019s office.\u201cWhew.\u201dBenjamin spat a long breath and kicked the door.Bang!A sound that seemed the door may fly off rang out.Benjamin moved inside through the open door and yelled with all his strength.\u201cBaron Tate! I came to visit myself but you dare\u2026\u2026\u201dBut his intent soon disappeared.\u201cHuh? Huh? Huh? Huh?\u201dBenjamin stammered because he was seriously surprised.He discovered Io too late.Benjamin pointed at Io with a trembling finger.\u201cWhy, why is sir, sir count here\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, Io brightly smiled and shook his head.\u201cViscount Doyle. Did you just point your finger at me?\u201dAt those words, Benjamin was surprised and hid his finger behind his back.And then, he deeply bowed.\u201cGreetings to Count Lancephil.\u201dIve also hurriedly bowed down.But Benjamin slightly turned his head and looked at Ive.\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me that sir count was here?\u2019Those eyes.Ive shook his head with a perplexed expression.\u2018I also didn\u2019t know.\u2019Those eyes.Then, Reil and Roan appeared from the open door.Reil discovered Benjamin who was bowing deeply and burst out in laughter.\u201cHahaha! Viscount Doyle, you have come!\u201dThen, he hit Benjamin\u2019s back and sat next to Io.For Benjamin, this was a really humiliating situation.\u2018Reil, you bastard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Curses surged up to his throat.\u2018Damn. Let\u2019s calm down for now. Calm\u2026\u2026..\u2019He forcefully smiled and stood still.Only then did Aaron stand up.\u201cCome over here.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dBenjamin had a rotten smile and moved towards Aaron\u2019s seat.He bowed once more towards Io.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that sir count Lancephil was here.\u201d\u201cI hurriedly came here after hearing that Viscount Baker was here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..You did.\u201dBenjamin was still putting on an awkward smile.Then, Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cSir commander. Should we start?\u201dA carefully asking look was seen on his face.However Benjamin saw him to be really detestable.\u2018Damn. I can\u2019t even say anything because of Count Lancephil.\u2019He couldn\u2019t do anything and just awkwardly smiled and nodded.Aaron smiled brightly and looked at Roan.\u201cRoan.\u201d\u201cYes. Corps commander.\u201dRoan replied in a low voice.He was feeling stifled right now.\u2018Benjamin Doyle. Why did this Viscount come over here?\u2019His eyes became fierce.\u2018In my past life, because of this viscount\u2026\u2026..\u2019One of the reasons he would stay as an ordinary spearman.That was because of Benjamin.Then, Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cDo you remember what I told you before you left for the temporary retirement?\u201dRoan didn\u2019t reply hurriedly and waited for the next words.Aaron faintly smiled and continued saying.\u201cThat I would give you a gift when you returned to the troop.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.\u2018He did. He said that he had some gifts for me.\u2019As he couldn\u2019t get a hold of himself, he had forgotten that truth.Aaron slightly looked at Reil.\u201cOne of those was an invitation for Viscount Reil Baker\u2026\u2026..\u201dNow, he looked at Benjamin.\u201cThe other one\u2026\u2026..\u201dBenjamin stood up as if he was waiting for it and extended his hand towards Ive.Ive hurriedly approached and gave him a wide wooden box.Click.The lid of the box opened along with a pleasing sound.Benjamin carefully raised the object inside the box with his two hands.A round object that was a bit larger than a coin and had a high class silk band hung from it.Aaron brightly smiled and continued saying.\u201cIt\u2019s a commander class military achievement badge.\u201dAt that instant, Roan\u2019s eyes turned big.\u2018Badge?!\u2019This was a really unexpected gift.\u2018At most, I thought that it would be a good spear or an armor.\u2019Just thinking about it made him satisfied. But to suddenly receive a badge.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re really surprised?\u201dAaron faintly smiled and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a commander class, it\u2019s a military service badge that received permission from the kingdom. Do you know what this means?\u201dRoan shook his head.Aaron said as if he was whispering.\u201cThat however much you accumulate merits, there\u2019s a limit to the rank of a commoner. At most they can become staff officers in their respective troops. Beyond that, you need a title of nobility.\u201dRoan nodded.It was something he knew very well.\u201cBut for a commoner to obtain a title of nobility and become a noble is as difficult as getting a star from the sky. You can see it as being almost impossible.\u201dAaron\u2019s sight moved to the badge.\u201cBut if you have a badge, the situation changes. A commoner that has a badge reaches the minimum condition for enabling you to receive a title of nobility.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.His eyes moved towards the badge on its own.Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cRoan. Now, the path to become a noble has opened up.\u201d\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For a normal soldier to accumulate this many merits.\u2019This was such a surprising thing.On top of that Roan was only 18.\u2018It means that he has more chances to grow from now on\u2026\u2026..\u2019For Benjamin who had big ambitions, he needed someone with skills.\u2018I will have to make him mine in this opportunity.\u2019He was planning to persuade the 7th corps and Aaron to take Roan to his side.He hung the badge on Roan\u2019s chest and hit his shoulder.\u201cYour merits were outstanding. You have done well.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThese were words he forcefully brought out.He didn\u2019t want to say thanks to this bastard.\u2018This situation is really weird.\u2019Although in his past life he certainly was in the worst relationship with him, in this life they didn\u2019t have any problems.But of course, even if that was the case, he wasn\u2019t thinking of getting closer to him.\u2018This bastard has many problems. Be it his temperament or abilities\u2026\u2026..\u2019He was a guy that wouldn\u2019t be of any use even if you left him at your side.No, rather, there was a bigger chance that he would affect you.But Roan erased his displeased feeling for now.\u2018He\u2019s my superior for now.\u2019He was still in the eastern army.If he acted as he wished here, his life would get tangled up just like his past one.Then, Benjamin\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI\u2019m promoting Roan by one rank alongside the badge and naming him a class 4 adjutant.\u201dThe badge and if it was a commander class badge, it was an obvious condition.From here, a good spear and some money was given to him as a reward.\u201cCongratulations.\u201dIo, Reil, Aaron and Gale congratulated him.Roan looked at his badge and the people and took in a deep breath.This was the moment his emotions became immeasurable.\u2018Count Lancephil, Viscount Baker, Baron Aaron and troop commander Gale\u2026\u2026..\u2019They were all people he looked at from far away in his past life.But now, they were all looking at him and applauding.\u2018The path is certainly open.\u2019But he still didn\u2019t know if the path was open for him to become a noble, a great general, or a monarch.But at least, it wasn\u2019t one where he would die without having done much.Grit.Roan ground his teeth.\u2018I\u2019m walking forward without getting arrogant.\u2019He held his resolution.Then, Benjamin\u2019s voice was heard again.\u201cUntil now, it was only the normal reward of the badge. But\u2026\u2026..\u201dA faint smile appeared.\u2018I have to give him a good impression now.\u2019Benjamin wanted to take Roan\u2019s interest.\u201cI will especially give you one more reward. If there\u2019s something you wish, speak. If it\u2019s something I can do, I will listen to it.\u201dIt was an unexpected proposal.And Ive also had a surprised expression.Io, Reil and Aaron just looked at Aaron\u2019s mouth.Especially Aaron and Gale, who had already faced this once, had interested expressions.And Roan also didn\u2019t hesitate this time.\u2018If it\u2019s Benjamin Doyle\u2019s character, the moment I decline it, it becomes as if nothing had happened in an instant.\u2019He knew about Benjamin\u2019s character really well.He was a greedy and selfish bastard.It was more profitable to catch it when he was saying that he would give something.If he declined or hesitated for a moment, it became as if it had never happened.Roan slightly raised his head and looked at Benjamin\u2019s face.\u201cThere\u2019s someone I want to bring to my troop.\u201dAt those words, Benjamin faintly smiled and nodded.\u2018That much is easy.\u2019If it was a soldier from the eastern army, he could move them from troops however much he desired.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201dHe asked confidently in return. .Roan shortly replied back.\u201cIt\u2019s spearman Harrison from the 15th squad of thorn troop of 7th corps.\u201dHarrison.The one that had a genius like talent in the bow.It became time to bring him in.*********Sweeeee!A sharp sound rang out.Puk!At the same time, one arrow pierced a small branch.Pabat!One youth ran through the forest quickly and knocked the bow.Tung!A heavy sound sounded out.Sweeeeee!One more arrow pierced the wind along a sharp sound.The arrow that flew while it had evaded the many trees.Puk!The arrow pierced a small branch.The sharp sounds were heard continuously like that.******\u201cWhere did this bastard go to!\u201dVice squad commander of the 15th squad of thorn troop, Hass, was annoyed.He had already taken a blow from the squad commander since early in the morning.When he was looking where to vent his anger, he couldn\u2019t see a guy.\u201cHe, it seems like he went to Polt forest.\u201dOne squad member replied.Hass kicked the ground and yelled.\u201cAgain?! So he\u2019s firing arrows again inside the forest!\u201dIt was an expression that implied that he was caught.\u201cEven so, I was planning to teach him, it turned out well though. For a spearman to always train in the bow while leaving behind the spear.\u201dHass clenched his teeth and ground his teeth.Then, one youth appeared from the entrance of the camp.He was holding a large bow and quiver on his back.Hass hurriedly ran over and swung his fist.As it was a sudden attack, he should have been hit in his face.But the fist cut the air.\u201cWhy are you like this?\u201dBecause the youth with the bow quickly dodged.\u201cThis bastard dares to dodge my fist?\u201dHass opened his eyes abruptly and clenched his fists one more time.Then, the sound of the door opening was heard.\u201cWhat is it? What are you doing!\u201dThe owner of the voice was one of the adjutants of thorn troop, Pad.He glared at Hass while he held a piece of paper in his hand.\u201cAre you bullying the kids?\u201d\u201cAhem. No, no.\u201dAnd then he loosened his fist stealthily and shook his head.An awkward expression appeared on his face.Pad glared at that Hass for a moment and then turned to look to the youth with the bow.\u201cTake this.\u201d\u201cYes? What\u2019s this?\u201dThe youth received the paper with a confused look.Pad shrugged his shoulders and replied.\u201cIt\u2019s a transfer order. It seems like it was directly laid down by the commander.\u201d\u201cTransfer order?\u201dThe youth looked at the paper with a confused face.However, he couldn\u2019t read the contents of it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but where are they taking me to?\u201dAt those words, Pad shortly replied.\u201c12th squad, rose troop of the 7th corps.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out from the youth\u2019s mouth.\u201cRose troop\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was a sound that rolled from his mouth.How long had he waited for this moment?A deep gratitude was seen in the youth\u2019s face.Then, Pad hit his shoulder.\u201cPack your things immediately and depart now.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dThe youth bowed deeply.Pad left after saying that.Hass approached as if he was waiting for it and growled.\u201cLook at this bastard. He\u2019s dying of happiness. You really didn\u2019t like being he\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up for a moment.\u201dIt was a cold voice.The youth faintly smiled and looked at Hass.It was a completely different attitude and eyes from earlier.\u201cHass, i\u2019m not your underling anymore. Don\u2019t act as you wish.\u201dAt those words, Hass\u2019s face brightened up.\u201cThi, this bastard! Are you crazy you bastard? Do you want to die?!\u201dHe yelled with all his strength.But the expression of the youth was still composed.He looked at Hass fixedly.\u201cHass. I\u2019m not this bastard.

You certainly became better.\u201dReil brightly smiled and clapped.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of Viscount Baker\u2019s teachings.\u201dRoan bowed with an embarrassed expression.\u201cI have only fixed some stances.\u201d\u201cEven so, i\u2019m really thankful for checking up on me this carefully until the day before you leave.\u201dReil who was being modest and Roan who was was truly thankful.The two people looked at each other and smiled brightly.Then, the accompanying knight Liam of Reil appeared from far away.\u201cViscount Baker! It\u2019s time to leave!\u201d\u201cI know! I know!\u201dReil yelled with all his strength.It certainly wasn\u2019t an action that a noble would be do.He was that free and didn\u2019t have a limit.\u201cI wanted to stay for a couple more days but\u2026..\u201dReil had a bitter smile while he was looking at Roan.\u201cI can\u2019t leave my territory for long. A noble has a lot of paperwork and things to do.\u201dHe smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.Even after Roan received his badge, Reil stayed for 10 more days.Because of that, Io and Benjamin were also there because of him.While they were like this, a letter arrived from Kevin two days ago.Although the detailed contents weren\u2019t revealed, Reil\u2019s face stiffened, so it probably meant that Reil should leave immediately.\u2018As Viscount Baker is leaving, all the others would leave too.\u2019It had also been long since Io left his territory, and in the case of Benjamin, he wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a secluded place for long.\u2018Troop commander Gale would like it the most.\u2019When Io, Reil, and Benjamin left today, Aaron would also return to the corps headquarters.\u2018He had suffered for taking care of the upper ranked people until now.\u2019Roan felt a bit sorry towards Gale.Because it was because of him that Io, Reil, Benjamin and Aaron ended up staying in the headquarters of rose troop.Then Reil\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThen, before I leave\u2026..\u201dHe took out a book from his chest.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dRoan received the book with his two hands.Reil brightly smiled and replied.\u201cI wrote down the bad habits, movements, problems, and etc.. As you aren\u2019t a member of my family and can\u2019t be my formal disciple, I can\u2019t teach you spearmanship. But even so I don\u2019t want to leave everything as if I don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.His heart choked because of Reil\u2019s consideration.\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason you are taking care of me this much\u2026\u2026..?\u201dRoan\u2019s voice and attitude were very careful.On the other side, Reil was still bright.\u201cI\u2019m planning to teach Pierce everything I have. If it\u2019s his talent, he would probably even surpass me. In the position of the master, it\u2019s a really proud and happy thing, but looking at it from his point of view\u2026\u2026..\u201dIt was an empty kind of smile.\u201cIt is a really sad and lonely thing. Not having anyone to spar with\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan bit his lower lip.He understood the reason for the empty smile.\u2018He was lonely until now.\u2019He didn\u2019t have any opponents to face.There wouldn\u2019t be something more lonely and sad than that for a warrior.Reil continued saying.\u201cRoan. I want you to become much stronger than now. For you, and for Pierce. And perhaps for me. I made this book with that kind of feeling. I would like it if it helped you in becoming strong.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t only Pierce but he was saying to become an opponent also worthy of him.Roan slowly nodded.\u201cI understand what you are saying.\u201dAt those words Reil smirked and hit Roan\u2019s chest.\u201cTake it into account. If you don\u2019t want to be put to shame the day Pierce finds you again, you will have to train and keep training.\u201d\u201cI understand. At least in effort, i\u2019m confident.\u201dA strong will was felt from the shut mouth.Reil proudly smiled and nodded.\u201cRight. There\u2019s nothing more important than effort.\u201dHe grabbed Roan\u2019s hands.\u201cYou will be able to do well.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan bowed.Reil smirked and looked towards the south.\u201cShould I go now?\u201dEveryone should have finished preparations and was waiting for him.\u201cI will take the lead.\u201dRoan faintly smiled and started to walk one step ahead of him.But Reil started to walk next to him.\u201cNo, not that\u2026\u2026\u201dHe put his arm around his shoulder and brightly smiled.\u201cLet\u2019s walk like this.\u201dRoan and Reil.The two people relied on each other and moved.The relationship had become thicker like that.******\u201cCome to Pavor castle to visit once.\u201d\u201cRemember the words I told you.\u201d\u201cIf you wish, I can transfer you to the headquarters in the east.\u201dIo, Reil and Benjamin all said their farewells and stepped back.Now, the remaining one was only Pierce.\u201cSir adjutant Roan.\u201dPierce bowed in front of Roan.\u201cIf I were to say honestly, I have greater feelings of wanting to stay here.\u201d\u201cPierce\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan said as if trying to ease him up.Then, Pierce raised his head and looked at Roan\u2019s eyes.\u201cBut just like what you have said back then, I will leave for you sir adjutant.\u201dStrength was put into his voice.\u201cI will work hard and return in the fastest time possible.\u201dAt those words Roan faintly smiled and nodded.\u201cRight. I will be waiting for you.\u201dRoan and Pierce.The two people just looked at each other\u2019s faces for a while.After a while, Roan looked at Reil who was waiting at the back and grabbed Pierce\u2019s shoulders.\u201cViscount Baker is waiting. Go, now.\u201d\u201cYes. Then, I will be going.\u201dPierce bowed deeply.His heart was still immature and soft.His shoulders trembled.Roan pretended not to notice it and patted Pierce\u2019s back.\u201cGo quickly.\u201dPierce couldn\u2019t raise his head and started to walk towards Reil.Reil consoled Pierce and got on the horse.Roan just stood still and watched that.\u2018Pierce. Have a safe trip. When you return back\u2026\u2026\u2019Fire appeared in his eyes.\u2018Many things will have changed.\u2019Only if it went according to his plans though.\u2018By then, you will have many things to do.\u2019Pierce was more important than anyone else for Roan.Meanwhile Io, Benjamin, Reil, and Pierce departed and went towards their objectives.Aaron and Gale looked at them for a moment and then returned to their own headquarters.The only one that remained until the end was Roan.It was even after the members of the 12th squad guessed Roan\u2019s feelings.\u2018Now, I can\u2019t even see them with Kalian\u2019s tear.\u2019He couldn\u2019t see Pierce\u2019s back anymore.\u201cWhew.\u201dA long sigh came out.When he was about to look away because of his hurting eyes.He could see one man that was approaching him from the end of the plains.He had quite the nimble steps.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.He had confirmed the face of the man through Kalian\u2019s tear.He stopped his feet and just stood at the gates of the castle for a while.After a while, the man that was like a grain soon arrived in front of the gate.He discovered Roan late and came in a hurried manner.Clack. Clack.The tools in his big bag clashed and made query sounds.\u201cPant. Pant. Pant.\u201dThe man stood in front of Roan and panted.His heaving chest was calmed a bit.Only then did he smile brightly and saluted Roan.\u201cSir! I, spearman Harrison of thorn troop of the 7th corps received a transferral order.\u201dThat man, he was none other than Harrison.\u2018For Harrison to come when Pierce leaves.\u2019This was a strange fate.This was a strange relation.Roan faintly smiled and hit Harrison\u2019s shoulder.His eyes were really gentle.He had a feeling of meeting his longing friend again.\u201cYou came well. Harrison.\u201dHe spoke in a soft voice.Roan grabbed Harrison\u2019s two hands.\u201cI was waiting for you.\u201d\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!

Tadak.Although summer hadn\u2019t ended yet, a strong heat was emanating continuously from the stove.\u201cCertainly, the accumulation of the mana is much faster than when I was at miss Biate\u2019s place.\u201dRoan was now practicing Reid\u2019s Flamdor mana technique.He had turned on the stove to absorb a little bit more of fire essence.He slowly stood up and loosened his wrists and ankles.\u2018I wanted to live together with my squad members but\u2026\u2026.\u2019He had a place to be alone to practice the Flamdor mana technique.And just in time, Aaron and Gale obtained a small and clean house near the headquarters because of the reward.Roan excused himself from the squad members and moved to another house.And after that, he even shortened the time to eat or sleep and concentrated in training in the mana technique.And on top of that, he lit the stove everyday. .\u2018It\u2019s already been three months since Pierce left.\u2019There were many things that happened in that while, but there were two especially important things.One was that Roan started to train in the mana technique and Reid\u2019s battle techniques earnestly.The remaining one was that he had risen to the rank of vice troop commander of rose troop along with Keniss.Roan, who had already reached 1 class adjutant tried to decline, but Gale was adamant.It meant that he couldn\u2019t leave him as a normal adjutant when he had received a badge.At this point Roan convinced him to also add Keniss, and then he ended up agreeing.\u2018Because of that I get to lead the spearmen squad, swordsmen, and archers.\u2019Roan tried to mix these squads and make a new structure but he gave up in the end.\u2018The cavalrymen, defenders, and the strong ones are commanded by vice squad commander Keniss. If I make a mistake, I will only cause a commotion.\u2019In the end he decided to put the squad and formation revisions for another time.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a short sigh and grabbed Travias spear that was in his waist.Cheng!As he put in mana, the blade appeared along with tbe pleasing sound of metal.\u2018Hm.\u2019One thread of mana surged from his mana hole and went towards his right hand.The mana road was quite hard and smoothly cleared because of the long training.Swush.He felt his palm tickle and then mana was put in the spear.Roan just condensed mana into the blade instead of increasing the length or thickness.Oooong.A white light appeared slightly on the blade with a short vibration.Roan concentrated a bit more and poured more mana into it but there were no more changes.\u201cWhew.\u201dIn the end, he let out a long sigh and retracted his mana.Cheng!The Travias spear turned to become a steel stick again accompanied by the sound of metal.\u2018For now, am I able to cover the blade with mana?\u2019Even so, it still wasn\u2019t comparable to things such as normal blades.\u2018Should I say that I just opened my eyes in the operation of mana?\u2019But even so, the encouraging thing was that Reid\u2019s Flamdor mana technique was amazing.Being able to cover the blade with mana with only three months of training was solely because of the mana technique.\u2018This was one of the reasons I didn\u2019t become Viscount Baker\u2019s disciple.\u2019No, the biggest reason Roan didn\u2019t become his disciple.It was that he believed in the strength the mana technique had.Although Reil\u2019s mana technique and spear skills were strong, it wasn\u2019t comparable to the mana technique of the strongest man in history, who was called the fire monarch.\u2018Although it\u2019s regrettable that I can\u2019t learn the spear with Viscount Baker, the mana technique fills in the lacking points and is more than enough.\u2019On top of that, although they weren\u2019t spear skills that utilized mana, Roan had tens and hundreds of real battle spear skills in his head.\u2018Although I can\u2019t make an amazing spearmanship like Pierce in an instant\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019If he gathered the good points of many spear skills and took out the bad ones he was confident in being able to make a powerfully strong spearmanship.Most of all.\u2018I have Reid\u2019s battle technique with me.\u2019Roan was planning to mix up the battle techniques with the real battle spear skills.If it was Reil\u2019s battle techniques that shook the continent, it would be able to seriously complement the weak and strong points that his spearmanship had itself. .\u2018A combination of the spear and the battle technique.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018I will show you a completely new spearmanship.\u2019He took in a deep breath.If it just became like that, he was planning on being able to beat Pierce even after he learned Reil\u2019s spear skills.\u2018First, the level of the mana technique itself is different.\u2019His heart beated loudly.Now, he could really see a different future to his past.\u2018Anyways\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and opened his hand.Although everything was going according to his plans, there was still one thing that worried him.\u2018Why is the mana shining in white light?\u2019When he looked at the rumours, various documents, and the contents written in the mana technique book, the light of the flame monarch\u2019s mana should have been red.But Roan\u2019s mana was rather transparent.\u2018The element the mana has is certainly fire. Only that the colour is different\u2026\u2026.\u2019He still couldn\u2019t discover any more problems aside from the color.Although he felt that the accumulation of the mana was a bit slow, he couldn\u2019t confirm it as he hadn\u2019t compared it with other mana techniques.\u2018Is it because of that silver waterdrop?\u2019If that was the essence of water, wouldn\u2019t it be having some influence on the mana technique?He couldn\u2019t be certain of anything.\u2018I\u2019m not even certain if that was the essence of water in the first place.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.It was a problem that didn\u2019t have answers even if he pondered about it.\u2018If I get to find the pieces miss Biate left, wouldn\u2019t this problem be solved?\u2019He bit his lower lip.He couldn\u2019t run to Poskein lake right now and retrieve Biate\u2019s piece.He decided to leave it for later.\u2018There are no problems right now\u2026\u2026.\u2019No, rather because the color of the mana changed, there was also a good point in it.\u2018Because it\u2019s not of a red light, other people would also never think that this is sir Reid\u2019s mana technique.\u2019In his past life, a war between Rinse kingdom and Estia kingdom happened because of this mana technique.\u2018Because the color of the mana changed, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that war happening.\u2019People wouldn\u2019t be able to know that Roan was learning mana if he didn\u2019t reveal it himself.Ududuk. Duduk.Roan softly loosened the joints in all his body and opened the door.There wasn\u2019t anything better than to train your body when your head got complicated.He took in a breath of the dawn air and ran towards the east gate.The world was still dark.It was still really early before dawn.There was still a lot things to do before the sun rose.Even so, Roan\u2019s steps didn\u2019t hesitant.The darkness wasn\u2019t any problem to him because of Kalian\u2019s tear.He went towards a secluded place near the east gate.The castle gates were still closed because it was still before the sun peeked the horizon.But even so, he couldn\u2019t train in Reid\u2019s battle techniques in the headquarters training grounds.\u2018There\u2019s nowhere as suitable as this.\u2019Roan looked at the place that was covered with dense trees and smiled.He stood off at one side of the secluded place and slightly bent his knees.He clenched his two fists and slightly bent his body towards the side.It was an action that seemed that he would swing his fist at any moment\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan breathed out and kicked the ground.Pabat! Pat!At the same time, the two fists split through the air without stopping.Spat!The two legs moved strangely and quickly.After that, kicks followed up.Reid\u2019s battle techniques was closer to mixed martial arts.There were various techniques such as kicking, throwing, choking, and smashing included into it.And those various strong techniques connected with each other and composed one big technique.\u2018I\u2019m still training in the basic techniques. I have to put in even more effort to master the intermediate and expert techniques.\u2019But of course, he also had to pour time and effort in training his mana technique.\u2018I\u2019m lacking time.\u2019It was Roan that nowadays thought that he would like it if a day was ten times longer.Pabat!It was a dark dawn.Roan moved relentlessly inside that darkness.*****It wasn\u2019t that Roan just focused on individual training.He also poured much time in training the spearmen, swordsmen, and archers as the vice troop commander of rose troop.He taught the 12th squad the newest training methods he knew and several signals, etc. Especially the first.Although he couldn\u2019t touch the formation of the troop, instead, he made it so spearmen could help each other, swordsmen between them, and archers between archers.He had half imitated the formation.Flock!The flagman was shaking two different flag sideways.At that instant, the squad members who were in their formations scattered to the sides and moved with purpose.Flock! Flock!This time, the two flags moved at the same time.The squad members started to return to their original formation as if they were waiting for it.Roan, who was checking the movements of the soldiers while he was standing at the top of the training grounds, nodded with a smile.\u2018They are still at a basic level but they are all adapting at the signs.\u2019Because of that, he would be able to send simple but important orders faster than before.\u201cRetreat.\u201dAs Roan let down the order, the flagman shook the flag widely.In that instant, the soldiers that were running in the training grounds retreated like water.\u2018Good.\u2019While he was being proud.\u201cVice troop commander.\u201dOne soldier hurriedly approached.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAt the question, the soldier pointed towards the entrance.\u201cSomeone visited.\u201dRoan just waited for the next words.\u201cHe says that he\u2019s called Chris.\u201dAt the following words, Roan faintly smiled and nodded.\u2018He finally came.\u2019It had been a month since he sent the visit request to Chris.He had finally arrived at Beno castle.Roan ordered the soldiers to rest and then started to move.As he approached the entrance, he saw Chris around it.\u201cMister Chris.\u201d\u201cAh! Sir adjutant Roan. Ah, no. You became the vice troop commander.\u201dChris faintly smiled and bowed.\u201cThank you for coming such a long way.\u201d\u201cNo. Even so, I wanted to visit you once.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris shook his hands.\u201cLet\u2019s go to my place for now.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan and Chris walked side by side and asked each other about their well being. When they were talking about how they were, Roan\u2019s promotion, the badge, and other things, they arrived at quite the fine house.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dRoan opened the door first and moved inside.Chris looked at his back and hurriedly scanned his surroundings.It was the habit and mannerisms especially from an information agent.\u2018There\u2019s a great amount of books.\u2019The house was quite unshapely.The proper furniture consisted of a table, some chairs, and a bed at most. In the remaining places, there were incredible amount of books everywhere.\u201cDid you read this all?\u201dChris grabbed a book and asked.Roan shook his head with a really composed attitude and expression.\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t even read half of them.\u201dHe had an awkward smile.Those words were true.Even so, it was a possible amount because he had also read in his past life.He gathered books from everywhere because of his greed but he didn\u2019t have much time to read books because of the training.But the reason he didn\u2019t stop buying books.\u2018If it gets a bit more systematized, I will have to teach the soldiers to read.\u2019Roan knew that that was one of the conditions for a strong army.\u201cYou were really surprised after reading my letter, right?\u201dAt those words Chris shook his head.\u201cNo. I was also planning to visit you, vice troop commander.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChris took out a pile of paper while answering.\u201cDo you remember the five merchants I told you last time, in Miller?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course I do.\u201dRoan received the papers and nodded.Chris continued saying.\u201cFor the past few months I have continuously invested in the five young merchants: Tio, Lidia, Eska, Nego, and Ford.\u201dRoan attentively listened.\u201cAmongst them, Lidia, who\u2019s a timber, and Eska who\u2019s a chef, are bringing quite an amazing profit. On the other side Tio, who\u2019s of the transportation industry and Nego, who\u2019s of the loaning industry, don\u2019t have many accomplishments to talk about. Lastly, mister Ford who\u2019s of the mining industry\u2026\u2026.\u201dChris awkwardly smiled and shook his head.\u201cIt seems like we wasted the investment. Precisely speaking, it seems like he even has debt.\u201dRoan just nodded.In the first place, he didn\u2019t think that all of them would succeed.But that wasn\u2019t the important thing.\u201cIn your opinion, what do you think their futures would be?\u201dAt those words Chris hesitated for a moment and then replied.\u201cHonestly speaking, the accomplishments of Tio, Nego, and Ford aren\u2019t that good but\u2026\u2026\u201dHe put in more strength in his voice.\u201cI think that there\u2019s worth in still checking on them.\u201dHis eyes were filled with certainty.Roan nodded.He stood up and after he searched in the wardrobe next to the stove, he took out a big bag.\u201cI believe in your eyes in sizing up people.\u201dRoan took out three jewel bags that were quite heavy.\u201cKeep investing in them.\u201dChris shook his hands with a bit of a surprised face.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do this. As I have the profits from Lidia and Eska, it\u2019s plenty with just one bag.\u201dHe looked at the big bag.\u2018He also gave me a jewel bag back in Miller\u2026\u2026..\u2019He thought that it could be possible when he first received the investment in Beno castle.He thought that it was a reward he received with the wanted reward.But the jewel bag he showed back then and the one right now.\u2018It\u2019s not something that a normal soldier could accumulate.\u2019It was at a level where it could be accumulated in a few years if it was short, or some tens of years it it was long.\u2018Now that I see it, there\u2019s not much I know about vice troop commander Roan.\u2019It was quite an embarrassing situation to boast that he was an information agency.\u2018Even so, I don\u2019t want to forcefully check his background.\u2019At least, he wanted to give the information about Roan to him.\u2018That\u2019s the right thing.\u2019Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cNo. One bag won\u2019t be enough.\u201dHe shook his head and said as if whispering.\u201cYou have new things to do.\u201d\u201cThings\u2026\u2026 to do?\u201dChris asked back.Roan nodded.\u201cThe first thing\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe brightly smiled and looked at Chris\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cYou will have to move your agency to Pavor castle.\u201d\u201cTo Pavor castle?\u201dChris asked back with a surprised expression.Roan slowly nodded.\u2018It\u2019s time to slowly move. No, he must move.\u2019The reason why he returned to Beno castle even after he acquired Reid\u2019s mana technique and battle techniques.That was because he remembered a lot of things that happened in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom, but there was the most important reason.\u2018War will soon appear.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a war between monsters.It would be human vs human.It would be kingdom vs kingdom.It was almost time for the eastern region of Rinse kingdom to increase in heat.Roan looked into Chris\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou will have to grasp all the information in the eastern region into your hands.\u201dThat was the first thing he had to do.His voice was filled with strength.His two eyes fiercely shined.\u201cIt\u2019s time to move earnestly.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When I analyzed their moving pattern and the regions they appeared in\u2026\u2026.\u201dGulp.Chris unconsciously gulped.Roan continued saying.\u201cIt seems like they are crossing over from Istel kingdom. And as if they were being chased away on top of that.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dChris let out a low exclamation.He realized what Roan was thinking in an instant.\u2018The monsters are crossing the boundaries as if they are being chased away\u2026\u2026\u2026If then.\u2019His head spun.Several and various kind of guesses were built and crumbled.And then, he placed down the most possible guess.\u201cIsn\u2019t Istel kingdom doing a massive monster subjugation?\u201dIt was the most standard of guesses.This year, a similar thing happened at the Pedian\u2019s plain monster subjugation.\u2018Because the Byron kingdom did a massive monster subjugation one step ahead, the number of monster at the Pedian\u2019s plain increased explosively.\u2019The stir of the monsters in the eastern region could be seen in the same context.Roan nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest possibility.\u201dHe lightly sighed.\u2018Although precisely speaking, they are preparing for war.\u2019In his past life, it was a war he had never expected.Because of that, the eastern region became a wasteland.\u2018The monsters of Istel kingdom fled to our side because they were frightened by the many soldiers.\u2019But in his past life, he didn\u2019t think about the stir of the monsters too highly.Then, Chris shook his head and said.\u201cBut it\u2019s a bit weird. At this time, Istel kingdom\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe last words dimmed.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Originally, they shouldn\u2019t have power to spare to do a massive monster subjugation.\u201d\u201cYes. Because they should be focused on harvesting at this time.\u201dChris said.It was a time that the army and obviously the citizen should be focused on harvesting.Because of that, nobody in Rinse kingdom could realize that Istel kingdom were preparing for war.\u201cBut even so, they went out for a subjugation? Isn\u2019t it a bit suspicious?\u201dRoan faintly smiled and asked.Chris just nodded with a serious face.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to know a bit more about it in detail. You will have to gather and analyze all the information in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom and of course the western region of Istel kingdom. And I would like it if you did that.\u201dRoan finished speaking and looked at Chris\u2019s eyes fixedly.It wasn\u2019t a meaningless formal act.\u2018A different future than what I know may happen.\u2019Because of that he had a need to gather and analyze information.\u201cMmm.\u201dChris nodded along a low exclamation.\u201cTo do that, Pavor castle would certainly be better than the capital of Miller.\u201dHe pondered for a moment and then looked at Roan while faintly smiling.\u201cI understand. As the situation is like this, I will immediately organize my agency and move to Pavor castle.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dA smile appeared on Roan\u2019s face.But he still had more things to do.\u201cAnd you will have to do one more thing.\u201d\u201cYes. Tell me.\u201dChris opened up his ears while he was fixing his posture.Roan slowly gathered the plans he had in his head.\u201cThere\u2019s a small fishing village called Perr in Poskein lake. There\u2019s a sailor called Daiv in there.\u201d\u201cVillage of Perr, Daiv.\u201dChris took note while mumbling.Roan continued saying.\u201cYou will have to make an organization of sailors with him as the center.\u201d\u201cAn organization?\u201dChris asked back with a bit of a surprised face.Roan slowly nodded.His expression seemed to be having fun.\u201cYes. We can\u2019t just leave that wide lake like that.\u201d*****Hoo. Hoo. Hoo.The breath was rough.But it wasn\u2019t someone breathing.Swush.The warm wind shook the long grass.Roan glared beyond the grass and made a sign.The spearmen, swordsmen, and archers all lowered their bodies.\u2018They came.\u2019A fierce light shined in his eyes.Roan lowered his body and went towards the archer squad.\u201cHarrison.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s call, Harrison replied in a low voice and approached.Adjutant Jones, who was leading the archer squad, raised his ear because he was curious to see what happened.Roan pointed beyond the grass with his finger.\u201cDo you see that goblin leader?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201dHarrison nodded while gulping down dry saliva.What Roan and Harrison, no, the spearmen and swordsmen squad of rose troop, and the archer troop were looking at beyond the grass while hiding, was a troop of goblins and kobolds that amounted to more than a thousand.And among them, the biggest and strongest goblin was present.He was the leader leading the troop.Roan pointed at the goblin leader and asked in a low voice.\u201cCan you hit him?\u201d\u201cYes?! That\u2019s impossible.\u201dThe answer came from a weird place.The owner of the voice was Jones, who was listening to them.The experienced archer frowned and shook his hands.\u201cThe distance between us is far and there are also a lot of obstacles in between. On top of that, he\u2019s continuously moving.\u201dThose were the right words.Currently, the goblin and kobold troops were moving inside Oat forest.Roan and the soldiers were hiding in ambush at a place with high grass and trees.Because of that, between them and the goblin leader, there were a lot of trees.If only there weren\u2019t any trees, the archer troop would already have poured a rain of arrows down on themBut even so Roan, had a really confident expression.He looked at Harrison and waited for his answer.\u201cWhew.\u201dHarrison, who was glaring at the goblin leader and the obstacles, and judging the direction of the wind, put on a faint smile.\u201cI think I can.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201dThis time also, Jones\u2019 reaction was a step faster.He shook his head with an expression full of disbelief.\u2018He took someone I hadn\u2019t even heard of\u2026\u2026\u2019Jones didn\u2019t like Harrison in the first place, who got transferred from nowhere.And he especially disliked that he received a bit interest from Roan.\u2018He can hit the goblin leader from over here? Impossible.\u2019It was a situation where he had to persuade him from not doing it.The moment he fired the arrow, their location would be discovered.As rose troop was at a disadvantage in numbers, if a battle occurred, their lives would be in danger.\u201cHitting the leader from here is im\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen Jones was about to step up.Roan patted Harrison\u2019s shoulders and nodded.\u201cI believe in you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHarrison bowed and then prepared an arrow.\u201cHuh?!\u201dJones was stunned with a surprised expression.Meanwhile, Harrison knocked the arrow and got up.\u201cWhew.\u201dHe closed his eyes and felt the wind.Roan looked at him and killed his breath.\u2018If the leader dies, they will fall in confusion.\u2019If they could only take care of the goblin leader, they would be able to easily win.Swish.The hot wind blew once again.\u2018The wind is a bit strong.\u2019Harrison slowly opened his eyes and pointed his bow towards the goblin leader.The trees filled his sight.They ran against each other and were lined up continuously.\u2018I can see a path.\u2019Harrison held his breath.The goblin leader, who didn\u2019t know of this, was just moving around leisurely.When he made two more steps.Tung.Harrison let go of the arrow.Sweeeeeeee!A sharp sound.One arrow flew between the many trees.Roan and Jones, and of course all the soldiers followed the arrow.Sweee!The arrow couldn\u2019t completely dodge the last tree.Spat!It slightly scratched it and the direction changed.Jones growled in a low voice as if he was waiting for it.\u201cSee? I certainly said that you\u2026\u2026\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t finish his words.\u201cIm, impossible!\u201dThe words were the same but the feelings they gave off were completely different.Because the arrow that had its direction slightly changed flew towards the head of the goblin leader like a lie.\u201cChwee?\u201dThe goblin leader turned his head along the sound that hit his ear and froze like that.The head of the arrow was as big as a rock.The moment he thought he had to dodge it.Puuk!The arrow pierced his forehead and was stuck in his head.Boom!The goblin leader fell down like that and couldn\u2019t move anymore.\u201cChwee?\u201d\u201cKak?\u201dThe goblins and kobolds gathered near the goblin leader at the sudden change in situation.At that sight Roan hit Harrison\u2019s back with some gusto.\u201cYou did well!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHarrison faintly smiled and bowed.Roan nodded and raised his spear highly.\u201cAttack!\u201dIn a loud voice.The order to attack was sent out.\u201cWaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cKill! Kill them!\u201dThe soldiers of the troop charged the ground as if they were waiting for it and ran towards the goblins and kobolds.And Roan also did the same.He was the one who was running in front of all of them.He was holding his spear in his armpit and running.A fierce intent flowed.\u2018Left, right, right again.\u2019Roan could charge through the trees with the shortest distance because of Kalian\u2019s tear.\u201cHe, he\u2019s really fast!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fall back!\u201d\u201cStick to him!\u201dThe soldiers followed his back with a surprised expression.\u201cChwee?\u201d\u201cKak?\u201dOnly then did the kobolds and goblins get a hold of themselves.They looked at Roan who was already in front of them and raised their rough weapons.\u201cHmph.\u201dRoan snorted and pulled up some mana.But he was in a situation where he still had to hide the fact that he was learning mana.He operated his mana road quickly without being able to bring it up to the blade of the spear.But even with just that, it was amazing.\u201cChwee!\u201d\u201cKak!\u201dTheir cries hit his ear.\u201cDie!\u201dRoan let out a shout and then lowered his body and twisted his wrist.Pat!The spear split the air.A sharp and smooth line of light was drawn over the heads of the goblins and kobolds.Sugk.A horrible sound rang out.\u201cChwee?\u201d\u201cKak?\u201dThe goblins and kobolds who were facing him stood stupidly and rolled their big eyes to the sides.At that moment.Sssss.A fine crack appeared in their heads and then blood started to flow.Boom!The bastards fell accompanied by a heavy sound.It showed just how powerful and quick that attack was. .Sugk! Spat! Slash!Roan swept up the front of the battlefield and swung his spear.In the first place, the goblins and kobolds weren\u2019t Roan\u2019s opponents.\u201cGrr.\u201d\u201cKeek.\u201dEvery time the spear cut the air, their heads fell to the ground.Continued by him, the spearmen, archers, and swordsmen attacked.They were in a formation that seemed sloppy but was solid at the same time.They moved just like one unit and massacred the goblins and kobolds.The important thing was that compared to before, the three squads moved according to the situation of each other and helped themselves at the same time.The goblins and kobolds fell down helplessly.Between them, Roan was sweeping up the battlefield and showed an outstanding might.Slash!The spear passed through the neck of a goblin.As the battle happened in a forest and they were confused, the battlefield was limited.The spear, which was a long weapon, was at a disadvantage the more the space became limited.But Roan still acted leisurely.\u2018The combination of spearmanship and battling techniques.\u2019He utilized Reid\u2019s battle techniques at situations where it was difficult to use the spear.No, precisely speaking,they were movements imitating Reid\u2019s battling techniques.Although it wasn\u2019t that he had created a new art by combining the two, but it was still powerful enough.\u2018I fill up the weak points the spear has with the battling techniques.\u2019This was the best he could do with Roan\u2019s ability.\u2018If my understanding of each art increases, I will be able to create a real spearmanship.\u2019As he knew his current abilities and the level he was at, he didn\u2019t think about doing that which was impossible right now.He was planning to do what he could step by step.Roan punched the goblin that got near him.Puk! Pubuk!It was a heavy sound.\u201cKrr!\u201dThe goblins got their heads and ribs crushed to pieces and were flung to the side.\u2018Strong.\u2019Certainly, the power of Reid\u2019s battle techniques were amazing.\u2018For movements that are only imitations to be this much\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019He couldn\u2019t even imagine how it would be when he properly executed it along with the Flamdor mana technique.Puk! Pubuk! Puk!The goblins became sludge at the consecutive punches.\u201cChwee!\u201d\u201cChwee!\u201dIn the end, the goblins that charged up to him became scared and fell back.\u2018That\u2019s just what I was waiting for!\u2019Roan swung his spear as if he was waiting for it.Stab.The spear stabbed the chests of the goblins.If they got close, use Reid\u2019s battle technique. If they were far, use spearmanship techniques.Roan had two powerful weapons with him.\u2018The combination of the spear and battle techniques is better than I thought.\u2019A smile appeared on his face.He swung his spear without stop and punched out.\u201cGrr.\u201dThe last words continued without stop.There were countless corpses of goblins and kobolds near him.The battle was now coming to an end.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan looked at the battlefield and took in a breath.The 12 and 13th squads were pushing back the ones that were fiercely fighting back.\u2018The movements of the 12th squad is certainly the best.\u2019Anyways, you couldn\u2019t do anything about it as they spent more time with Roan than the other squads.Roan\u2019s sight moved towards the archer squad.Tung! Tung!He saw a youth who was firing arrows without stopping.Harrison.Differently than the other archers, he ran across the forest and was sending precise arrows towards the goblins and kobolds.Puk!\u201cGrr.\u201dOne for one arrow.On top of that, there were even times when an arrow killed two kobolds at the same time.\u2018Certainly, Harrison\u2019s talent with the bow is the best.\u2019Roan looked at Harrison\u2019s face and smiled.It was a happy smile.\u2018He never put on that kind of expression in my previous life.\u2019Roan felt proud.It was a feeling like he had made another person\u2019s dream come true and not only his.Then, the sound of the horn was heard that signified the end of the battle.Puuuuuu!A sound that made you flustered any time.\u201cWaaaaaaa! Victory!\u201d\u201cComplete victory! Complete victory! \u201c\u201cRose troop! Hurray! Hurray!\u201dThe soldiers yelled.It had already been two months since monsters started to appear in the eastern region.And now, it was rose troop\u2019s 21st battle and they were all complete victories.Roan waited for a moment so the soldiers could savour the victory.\u201cWaaaaaaaaa!\u201dWhen the yells calmed down a bit.He yelled towards the soldiers while he still had his spear at his side.\u201cAfter we clean up the corpses, we repair the road, and we carve hollows and ditches for defensive purposes!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dThe soldiers replied with excited voices.They quickly moved and started to gather the corpses of the kobolds and goblins in one place.At the same time, they carved ditches and hollows at the sides of the road.Roan looked at that for a moment and then moved outside the forest.He could see the cavalrymen running from far away when he left the entrance.They were the cavalrymen squad of Rose troop that included Gale and Keniss.\u2018It seems like the subjugation of the plain also turned out well.\u2019The expression of Gale, who was running at the front, was bright.Nonetheless, Gale laughed with a big voice and yelled as soon as he arrived.\u201cHahaha. This battle was also a complete victory.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because of troop commander\u2019s amazing commanding skills.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Gale shook his head.\u201cNo. No. Although I said it immediately, the reason we achieved complete victory is all because of you.\u201dA proud smile was on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to notice the stir of the monsters beforehand, but it was even more amazing that you precisely guessed the estimated region and time that the monsters would appear.\u201dAt those words Keniss added.\u201cYou really are worthy of being called the ghost of the battlefield.\u201dThe ghost of the battlefield.Roan thought once again that it was fortunate that he didn\u2019t become a battlefield fortuneteller.\u201cI just guessed from the rumors and the stories of the citizens.\u201dHe spoke in a humble attitude and voice.\u201cAnyways, what\u2019s amazing is amazing.\u201dGale was astounded.Then, Keniss asked with a careful voice.\u201cBut is Istel kingdom really behind the stir of the monsters?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a high possibility.\u201dRoan nodded.\u2018According to the analyzed information, Istel kingdom already finished their preparations for war.\u2019Until now, the situation and the time was similar to his past life.\u2018Should I say that this is fortunate\u2026\u2026.\u2019A bitter smile appeared on his face.Gale let out a sigh with an uneasy look.\u201cWhew. We are setting up defensive lines in the eastern region for now with the monster subjugation as the excuse\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan knew the reason he was being uneasy.\u2018Benjamin Doyle. That stupid bastard saw the report of corps commander Aaron and ignored it.\u2019When he first reported the stir of the monsters and the movement of Istel kingdom to Gale, Gale reported it to Aaron.As he already knew about Roan\u2019s abilities very well, he didn\u2019t have any doubts or hesitation.And Aaron also sent the report to Benjamin, who was the commander of the eastern region, right after he inspected the contents.But.What returned back to them were blame and reproaches.Although Aaron sent the report, it was perfectly ignored.In the end, he also sent the report to some corps commander he was friends with and were pouring all of their strength into making a defensive line.\u2018That Benjamin bastard is making things difficult again.\u2019It was Benjamin that did nothing right even since his past life.But even so, it was fortunate that some corps moved thanks to Aaron\u2019s efforts.\u2018Even if those Istel bastards come charging, we won\u2019t crumble in an instant.\u2019In his past life they lost half of the eastern region because of the sudden attack.At least, they wouldn\u2019t get pushed back that helplessly in this life.\u2018We have to endure until the corps of other regions and that stupid bastard prepares for battle.\u2019That was something he could do plentily.At least, if it went according to Roan\u2019s plans.But when did life flow as you wished?One soldier approached and saluted.\u201cSir. Vice troop commander Roan. Someone called Pens is looking for you?\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dIf it was Pens, it was one of the staff members Chris had.Roan slightly bowed towards Gale and Keniss and then followed the soldier.Pens was roaming a bit far away from the entrance of Oat forest.He bowed towards Roan and then took out a small piece of paper from his chest.\u201cBoss Chris sent me.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dA hint of nervousness showed on Roan\u2019s face. .He didn\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t feel good.He carefully spread the paper and checked the contents.And then his expression stiffened.The letter started with a sentence that would not please anyone. .EndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!

    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 65 - War and more war (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the first sentence, the contents of the letter became worse.The contents of the letter were simple.Roan frowned.\u2018Byron kingdom?\u2019This was something he hadn\u2019t expected at all.\u2018In my past life they didn\u2019t show any movements until next year\u2026\u2026\u2019There was no way something this important would be wrong.Then.\u2018The future changed again.\u2019Also with their movements, this was a really bad position for Roan.He tore the letter and put it into his pocket, and then looked at Pens.\u201cThen, mister Chris\u2026..\u201d\u201cYes. He left four days ago.\u201d\u201cRight. You\u2019re all working hard.\u201dAt those words, Pens hurriedly shook his head.\u201cNo. They\u2019re all working having fun as if it was their thing.\u201dAt those words Roan slightly bowed.\u201cI will ask you to take good care of me.\u201d\u201cI, I will do my best.\u201dPens also bowed.Roan became locked in his thoughts by himself after he separated with Pens.\u2018I really can\u2019t know when the future will change.\u2019The worth of the information agency could be seen because of this matter.\u2018I did well in focusing on gathering information of the eastern region.\u2019The decision of not relying solely on his memories made him see light.\u2018For now, let\u2019s leave the side of Byron kingdom to mister Chris.\u2019There was nothing Roan could do right now.There was also a possibility that the rumor Chris heard was fake.\u2018The thing I should do now\u2026\u2026..\u2019Stop the stir of the monsters and prepare for the attack of Istel kingdom.He shook his head and looked towards the east.There lied Istel kingdom.He felt like the smell of the battlefield passed by his nose.******Roan concentrated on subjugating the monsters while he waited for Chris.When the subjugation ended, they set up camps or fences according to the topography and also dug ditches and holes.People who knew that the movements of Istel kingdom weren\u2019t normal were only soldiers with ranks above adjutant.Normal soldiers still thought that the defensive lines were for the stir of the monsters.\u201cIt slightly resembles the shape of a defensive line for now.\u201dAs Benjamin ignored Aaron\u2019s reports, some holes appeared at places, but even so as they did their best even if Istel kingdom came attacking immediately. They were confident in tying down their opponent\u2019s feet for now.Then one soldier approached.\u201cVice troop commander. Someone called Chris is looking for you.\u201dAt those words, Roan\u2019s face brightened.\u2018You finally came.\u2019It had already been 20 days since Chris left towards Byron kingdom.As there was no news at all, he felt uneasy.Roan hurriedly moved to meet him.He could see Chris who was looking at him while standing still.\u2018It seems like the trouble he went by wasn\u2019t ordinary.\u2019Chris looked kind of haggard.His hair was bushy and he looked dirty.But even so there was a satisfied smile on his mouth.\u2018It seems like he gained some accomplishments to be satisfied about.\u2019Roan ran towards Chris and grabbed his hands.\u201cI was worried because there was no contact.\u201d\u201cAs the atmosphere over there was too solemn, I couldn\u2019t contact you as I wished.\u201dChris shook his head.\u201cYou have done well.\u201d\u201cNo. I just did what I had to.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris shook his head once again.And then looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cI gained some big achievements.\u201dRoan just listened.Chris continued saying.\u201cIf I were to tell you the conclusion first, it is that the people of Byron kingdom are also preparing for war.\u201dHe took out a pile of papers from his bag.It was the information about the southern region of Byron kingdom which he organized.\u201cMmm.\u201dRoan received the papers.\u2018Certainly. Just why did the future change now? In my past life\u2026\u2026..\u2019He suddenly brought up the memories.The reason why Byron kingdom couldn\u2019t move as they wished.But he couldn\u2019t remember the detailed situation of the kingdom.\u2018How stifling.\u2019It certainly would have changed because of one of his choices.Then, Chris\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cAlthough I couldn\u2019t acquire internal information, it isn\u2019t precise. But even so it seems like the two kingdoms have held hands.\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201dRoan said.Historically, Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom were just like cats and dogs.Compared to that, Istel kingdom was on friendly terms with both Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom.But even so, if you had to choose a friendlier side, it would be Byron kingdom.There was plenty of possibilities for the two of them to have held hands.\u2018The objective in this war for Istel kingdom would be to advance on their western territory.\u2019The exact objective was revealed only after the war ended.It certainly was like that in his past life.\u2018The situation is turning difficult.\u2019Roan let out a long sigh.Then, Chris said as if he was whispering.\u201cBut I conjured a hypothesis on why Byron kingdom became able to participate in this war.\u201dHe had a somewhat hesitant look.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026.I think that the reason is because of our kingdom.\u201d\u201cOur kingdom?\u201dRoan frowned at the unexpected conjecture.Chris nodded.\u201cYes. We achieved a complete victory at the Pedian plain\u2019s monster subjugation. Compared to last year, he gave them a loss almost close to annihilation. Especially, the ones with the biggest losses\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan continued speaking.\u201cThe orcs of the north\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dChris nodded.He continued speaking.\u201cThere were many guys that set up attack lines to attack Byron kingdom. But they were all annihilated\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThe southern region of Byron kingdom became inactive.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even Violin ended up dying in the Slen battle. In the position of Byron kingdom, they are at a situation where they shouldn\u2019t even have to worry about the orcs in the south.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dRoan gulped the silence.\u2018I never expected that the results of Pedian plain and slaying Violin\u2019s head would become like this.\u2019But of course, there were still many other orc commanders aside from Rak in the northern region of RInse kingdom.\u2018But they are living in the northern region of our kingdom. Rather, our side is in more danger.\u2019Anyways, different than his past life, he thought he now knew the reason why Byron kingdom could prepare for war.But of course, this was all a hypothesis of Chris\u2019.He couldn\u2019t actually know what kind of black curtain there was.\u2018I will have to report it to corps commander Aaron. However\u2026\u2026\u2019Even if he did that, he didn\u2019t think a sharp response would come back.It was obvious that Benjamin would ignore the report.But even so, he couldn\u2019t just report it to the king\u2019s palace while ignoring the army rules.No, at this time he didn\u2019t even have the means to.His pondering deepened at this large dilemma.Chris looked at that face of his.He also knew much about Roan\u2019s ponderings.\u2018Isn\u2019t there be anything I can be of help with?\u2019Chris mulled over his thoughts over and over again.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u2019Although it wasn\u2019t a clever scheme, he still thought of one method.\u201cVice troop commander Roan.\u201dChris called out to him in a low voice.Roan moved out of his thoughts and looked at Chris.Chris faintly smiled and continued to speak.\u201cShould I spread a rumor?\u201d\u201cA rumor?\u201dAs Roan asked back, Chris nodded.\u201cWe spread a rumor that the movements of Byron kingdom and Istel kingdom aren\u2019t normal around the capital of Miller and the northern region. Wouldn\u2019t a rational commander, who\u2019s not like commander Doyle, pay a bit of attention to it?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dRoan gulped.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be that good of an idea.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not easy to spread a rumor because the time and human power is limited. But most of all\u2026\u2026\u201dHis face stiffened.\u201cIf that kind of rumor roamed around, the citizens would feel uneasy.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dChris let out a low exclamation.He couldn\u2019t move the feelings of the citizens just to make the commanders move.\u201cNormal people fear war a lot. If a rumor about Byron kingdom and Istel kingdom wanting to attack us spreads, an ensuing chaos would occur. Because for them, it would look like we aren\u2019t prepared at all. If we are to spread a rumor, it would have to be after our preparations are solid.\u201d\u201cI was short in my thoughts\u201dChris slightly bowed.He was a bit moved.\u201cI think that you\u2019re really amazing. To think of the safety of the citizens first in this urgent situation.\u201dAt those words Roan sighed.\u201cWhew.\u201dHe looked at the village that was located at the south of the plains.\u201cCan you see that small village?\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes.\u201dChris followed Roan\u2019s sight and turned his head.He could see a small but peaceful village.Different than the soldiers who were setting up fences or digging ditches, the village men were solely focused on taking care of the harvest.It was a scene that made you feel warm when you looked at it.\u201cIt\u2019s really pleasing to watch, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It feels like i\u2019m getting happy.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s question, Chris faintly smiled and nodded.On the other side, Roan\u2019s expression was kind of dark.\u201cIf we can\u2019t perform our roles well, their lives will get stepped on.\u201dEven if his voice was low.It was completely different to his positive and bright look.Roan closed his eyes.The smoke filled the sky.The village that was peaceful and beautiful.The cries and yells heard in his surrounding.The ground wet in blood.A horrible scenery happened in front of his eyes.It wasn\u2019t something he made up with his imagination.These were the memories of his past life.\u2018The things that happened in the war against Istel kingdom\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019No, it wasn\u2019t only during the war against Istel kingdom.Everywhere war happened, a horrible scenery followed behind it.\u2018I can\u2019t let that happen again.\u2019That was what Roan wanted to do.A real monarch didn\u2019t betray his citizens.Roan wanted to become that kind of monarch.He slowly opened his eyes and looked at Chris.\u201cMister Chris.\u201dHe spoke in a low voice but with strength.\u201cHelp me so I can help them.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dChris exclaimed with a deeply moved face.\u2018It certainly is sir Roan. If it\u2019s him, if it\u2019s him\u2026\u2026.\u2019He clenched his fists.\u2018I can spend all my life with him.\u2019Determination.That was an oath of serving.\u2018I have to do what I can even better. Help sir Roan to do what he does.\u2019He started the information agency because it was fun.But now, he started to feel responsibility from those things.He started to feel a sense of duty at what he started because of fun.Today, Chris grew up one more level.Meanwhile, Roan was wondering how to confront the Byron kingdom.\u2018Won\u2019t there be a good strategy\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019His head spun.Many strategies and tactics popped up.But there was nothing good.Chris, who was looking at that Roan, mumbled in a low voice.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I miss the orcs this much. Just gathering the scattered ones would be enough to prevent Byron kingdom from moving as they wished.\u201dAt that instant, Roan\u2019s eyes opened widely.\u2018Right! Orcs!\u2019His mouth raised up.\u201cMister Chris.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEven so, it seems like we will have to talk for quite a while.\u201dThe smile on his mouth became even denser.Roan continued saying in a low voice.\u201cI thought of a good thing.\u201d*****\u201cScatter to the sides!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t separate too much!\u201d\u201cGet a hold of yourselves!\u201dIn the eastern plains of Beno castle, rose troop was training earnestly.Roan was checking the movements of the troop from a bit far away and recording the lacking points.\u2018For now, we have safely evacuated the residents to a safe zone.\u2019Now, there wasn\u2019t much time left until the attack from Istel kingdom.They couldn\u2019t leave the residents alone when they didn\u2019t know when war would break out.They gave the excuse that they couldn\u2019t ensure their safety because the stir of the monsters was too severe.And fortunately, the citizens reacted well to the instructions.Because even for them, monsters frequently appeared in this region.\u2018What\u2019s left now is waiting for the answer from the transcript of the north\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019The preparations were finished.\u2018Whew!\u2019Roan let out a long sigh.Then, the head of a war horse appeared at the end of the plain.\u2018Mm?\u2019The war horse whipped up white dust and ran quickly.As Roan focused on his sight, the warhorse that was far away was seen as if it was right in front of him.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that moment, a low exclamation came out.He had clearly seen it.That the soldier was holding a red flag.\u2018Is it starting?\u2019Roan bit his lower lip and raised his right hand.Flop! Flop!At Roan\u2019s handsign, the flagman shook his hand and the troop stopped their movements.They had lined up while setting up a rectangle formation.When each adjutant and squad commander stood in front of their spot.The warhorse that was running through the plains came closer.Flop! Flop!The red flag that waved around with strength.Roan and the soldiers moved their sight over the warhorse.At the same time, the soldier riding it yelled with strength.\u201cThe people of Istel kingdom have crossed the boundary!\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!

I wanted to make Beno castle fall faster than anyone.\u2019He thought that Rinse kingdom wouldn\u2019t have made any preparations.But that wasn\u2019t only Clark\u2019s thoughts.Everyone thought like that and thought that the battle would flow normally.\u2018Wrong. We were wrong.\u2019Then, he felt a chilly presence when he was stepping back.Clark stopped and turned around.\u201cHuk!\u201dHe saw a spear that was right in front of his nose.Clark couldn\u2019t endure it and fell down.\u201cAre you the troop commander?\u201dThe owner of the voice was someone with a spear.Clark looked up while he was on the ground.It was a childish face but had a somewhat rugged charm.He was none other than Roan.\u201cReveal your name and unit.\u201dRoan brought his spear to Clark\u2019s forehead.\u201cKugh.\u201dClark frowned.He had already resigned everything.\u201cI\u2019m troop commander Clark of Pier troop of the 1st corps of Istel kingdom.\u201dClark honestly revealed his unit.\u2018It certainly was the Pier troop.\u2019The soldiers of rose troop who were surrounding him along with Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cDid you know that we were going to attack?\u201dClark regretted having asked that to Roan.\u2018Someone who\u2019s soon going to die has asked a meaningless question.\u2019He smiled bitterly.\u201cLet me know the name of the bastard who will take my head.\u201dRoan looked at Clark\u2019s eyes fixedly and put strength into his wrist.Swush.The spear soared high to the sky.\u201cMy name is Roan. I\u2019m the vice troop commander of rose troop of the 7th corps.\u201dAt the same time, the spear fell towards Clark\u2019s head.Clark listened to the sharp noise and closed his eyes.Slash.The spear instantly cut off his neck.The body that lost its head slowly fell over.Boom.Roan shook his spear and waved the blood off.The cries and yells in his surrounding had now calmed down.\u2018The first battle is a complete victory.\u2019A smile appeared on his face.The beginning of the war started off on a good foot.\u2018At this point, the news of an infiltration attempt from Istel kingdom would have reached the eastern headquarters.\u2019Now that the situation turned out like this, even the stupid Benjamin wouldn\u2019t be able to just sit still.\u2018Even so, as Count Lancephil moved first, we could cover up some big holes we had in our defensive lines.\u2019Aaron reported this to Io instead of Benjamin, and Io lead the knights himself after confirming the situation and marched.\u2018But it\u2019s still lacking.\u2019To face Istel kingdom, he needed the forces of the eastern region and also an army provided by the palace.\u2018We will hold until then.\u2019He didn\u2019t need a complete victory like this one; to the point of completely massacring their enemies.They just needed to tie their feet to not let them advance deeper in towards the kingdom.But even so, it wasn\u2019t that they had leisure in terms of time.\u2018Byron kingdom would also have started advancing\u2026\u2026.\u2019Although they also crossed the boundaries, they were advancing while riding the eastern boundary.\u2018It would be to join with Istel kingdom.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018The 3rd and 4th corps have to do well\u2026\u2026\u2019He hatched a plan after having a conference with Aaron before the war started.And that was that the 3rd and 4th corps had to face Byron kingdom in the north while the eastern region battled against Istel kingdom.But of course, they didn\u2019t have to battle with putting their lives on the line.Their objective was pulling them into a deep part of the northern region.There were two things he could gain by losing every battle.\u2018I will make them be off guard.\u2019But what was more important.\u2018We have to make the supply line as long as possible.\u2019If they pulled Byron kingdom deep inside their territory, they could only get further away from their provisions.This was because of the speed difference of the troops and the movement speed of the supplies.Because of that, the supply line gets longer and their military forces becomes thinner.That was the point Roan was aiming for.\u2018If the warriors of the north attack them there\u2026\u2026..\u2019Byron kingdom would fall in chaos.No, it wasn\u2019t only chaos.\u2018A troop without supplies can\u2019t continue doing war.\u2019Supplies were that important in a war.But of course, it wasn\u2019t an important plan.The moment one of his small plans deviated, Rinse kingdom would have brought a tiger to their den.\u2018They have to accomplish their respective roles well.\u2019Then, a familiar voice was heard from his back.\u201cRoan. It\u2019s a complete victory. Complete victory.\u201dAs he turned back, he saw Gale and Keniss approaching him.They were slightly inspired at the complete victory.\u201cWhere do we have to move next?\u201dGale asked while looking at the battlefield.Roan replied in a low voice.\u201cWe have to wait until the information squad arrives.\u201d\u201cAh, information squad. Right. Right.\u201dGale let out a low exclamation and nodded.He looked at Roan\u2019s face.\u2018Information squad\u2026.. Was there a person that made that and even used it in a war?\u2019When he first heard that Roan wanted to make an information squad, he couldn\u2019t easily understand it.Because he thought that just using the patrolling guards were enough.On top of that, he thought that it was nonsense to make a non battling squad when they were already at a disadvantage in numbers.But when they made the information squad as per Roan\u2019s opinion, they could only get amazed at their role.\u2018Although they can\u2019t figure out all of the information, they are able to grasp their movements.\u2019Having waited in ambush beforehand at the moving route of Pier troop was also because of the strength of information.He looked at Roan with amazed eyes.\u2018He\u2019s looking at me like that again\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan smiled awkwardly and looked away.Nowadays, whatever happened, he always looked at him with those eyes.Amazement, respect, awareness.But of course there was envy, annoyance, and jealousy mixed in at times, but those were scarce.Roan was receiving an overwhelming support from everyone.\u2018Anyways, it seems like it was a good thing to make an information agency.\u2019In the first place he was planning to utilize Chris and his staff to gather and analyze information.But for a normal person, that wasn\u2019t a soldier, to roam the battlefield was one of the most dangerous things to do.Because of that, he chose soldiers that had good eyesight and were nimble to make an information squad.\u2018Mister Pens is leading them well.\u2019The squad commander wasn\u2019t a soldier, but a staff of Chris\u2019s agency, Pens.\u2018After this, I will have to make Chris\u2019s travel agency a formal information agency.\u2019The significance of information will be seen the more time has passed.Before that, he needed a more systematic organization.\u2018The time to start the agency has come.\u2019The best information group that grabbed all the information in the continent in his past life.The agency.The time came to make the first step.*****Chris was fruitful in gathering information about Istel kingdom because of the use of the agency and information squad.Fortunately, their movements weren\u2019t that different to Roan\u2019s memories.Roan\u2019s memories and the information gathered together.The two things were combined and made a more precise and valuable information.Because of that, the 7th corps and the other three corps could set up a defensive line before hand in Istel Kingdom\u2019s attack line.After four days of having set up wooden fences and strong barricades, did the people of Istel kingdom appear.Their numbers were as much as 80,000.Compared to that, the amount of the four troops were as much as 30,000.\u201cAmazing.\u201dAaron was astounded.Even the other corps commanders gulped down dry saliva.What was fortunate was that the location of their barricade was good.No, precisely speaking, the location of Istel kingdom\u2019s camp was bad.They could only take place somewhere in the empty plain because Rinse kingdom had already set up their barricade.\u201cIt\u2019s just like Roan\u2019s information and the report of the information agency.\u201dAaron glared at the end of the plains with a satisfied expression.He was amazed once again at Roan\u2019s ability and quick eye.Then, Mendel appeared with an urgent expression.\u201cCorps commander.\u201dAaron and several corps commanders had turned their head and looked at Mendel.Mendel continued saying with a stiffened expression.\u201c30.000 soldiers of the eastern army arrived at the Nerf region.\u201dNerf region was one day away from here, Bink region.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe corps commanders exclaimed and put on relieved expressions.But Mendel\u2019s expression was still hard.And Aaron didn\u2019t miss that.\u201cIt seems like something happened.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026..\u201dMendel chewed his lower lip and hesitated.And then, spoke with a slightly agitated expression.\u201cThe eastern army set up a camp in the region of Nerf.\u201dIn that instant, the corps commanders frowned.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThey had expressions as if they couldn\u2019t believe it.For their allies to set up a camp in a region that was a day away from this place, that already had a camp set up.It was something they couldn\u2019t understand at all.\u201cCommander Aaron. If the eastern army set up a camp in the region of Nerf, shouldn\u2019t we also fall back?\u201d\u201cOho. Do you think that makes sense? Will the enemies just sit still while we retreat over to the region of Nerf?\u201dThe commanders discussed among themselves and pondered.And Aaron was also the same.\u2018Benjamin Doyle. You really are a pain in the ass.\u2019Benjamin had big ambitions, but was too frightened.He certainly would have gotten scared at the 80,000 soldiers of Istel kingdom and set up a camp in their rear.\u2018Retreat? Or protect this place? Whatever we do, it isn\u2019t a good situation.\u2019Then, Mendel\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cHow about calling Roan?\u201d\u201cRoan?\u201dAaron turned his head and looked at Mendel.Mendel swallowed down dry saliva and nodded.\u201cYes. If it\u2019s Roan, won\u2019t he have something good?\u201d\u201cMmm. Right. If it\u2019s Roan\u2026\u2026..\u201dAaron touched his chin and nodded.\u201cGood. Call him.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dMendel deeply bowed and left.The commanders that were discussing looked at Aaron.\u201cWho\u2019s Roan?\u201d\u201cI hear that name a lot\u2026..\u201d\u201cAh! Is he the soldier that received a corps commander level badge\u2026\u2026.?\u201dAt those words Aaron nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ale gorge battle, Pedian monster subjugation tactic, Int\u2019s forest battle, Prely river inundation tactic, Slen battle, and the invasion of Istel kingdom and Byron kingdom. These distinguished merits were all accomplished by vice troop commander Roan.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dThe commanders exclaimed out loud.\u2018So he\u2019s outstanding in strategies and tactics?\u2019\u2018They say his spear skills are also amazing.\u2019\u2018There\u2019s a rumour that he went toe to toe with Viscount Baker.\u2019The commanders glanced at each other and had a smile mixed with expectation.After a while, the door opened and Roan appeared.\u2018This childish youth is that Roan?\u2019\u2018He\u2019s much smaller than what I thought.\u2019\u2018I heard that he was young, but he\u2019s a complete greenhorn.\u2019The smiles on their faces disappeared.An uneasy look appeared again.\u2018I was also like that at first.\u2019Aaron looked at them and bitterly smiled.\u2018But they will soon be amazed at Roan\u2019s abilities.\u2019Just like him from the past.\u201cDid you call me?\u201dRoan saluted towards Aaron.After Aaron nodded, he told him the truth that Benjamin set up a camp in the region of Nerf.Roan bowed with a composed expression.\u2018Benjamin Doyle. You are making things really difficult.\u2019However, he had kind of expected that the scaredy cat would have set up a camp at their rear.\u2018The problem is whether Istel kingdom set up a camp in the region of Bink, just like the analysis of the information squad.\u2019The result.\u2018Fortunately, it\u2019s like we guessed.\u2019Then, there was no need to worry.\u201cThe situation isn\u2019t good. Do you have a good method to deal with them?\u201dThis was Aaron\u2019s question.Roan replied as if he was waiting for it.\u201cWe have to prepare for a night raid.\u201dAt that instant, Aaron and the other commanders all frowned.\u201cNight raid?\u201d\u201cDid he say night raid?\u201d\u201cAre you telling me that Istel kingdom will launch a night raid?\u201dThey all laughed.\u2018They say that rumours tend to be excessive\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019\u2018The merits he had accumulated until now would all have been a bluff.\u2019The commanders looked at Roan and shook their heads.Then Philip Hass, who was the commander of the 5th corps and the one with the most experience, clicked his tongue.\u201cTchtchtch. Look. Don\u2019t you know that it has already been nine days since they crossed the boundary?\u201d\u201cYes. I know.\u201dRoan bowed.The person who had reported that Istel kingdom had crossed the boundary was right himself.Philip continued saying as if he was rebuking.\u201cAn army consisting of 80,000 appeared in Bink region nine days ago. It\u2019s quite a fast, no, a movement speed so fast you can\u2019t even imagine it.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThe other commanders all nodded.Phillip looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cThis means that they slept and ate the least amount possible and moved night and day. It means that it\u2019s an amazing forced march. But they attempt a night raid the moment they set up a camp? Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201dHe was making fun of him.The other commanders also laughed.\u201cHahaha. It seems like he doesn\u2019t know about these things as he hasn\u2019t faced a war this big yet.\u201d\u201cNow that I see it, the merits he accumulated were all done while facing the ignorant monsters.\u201dThey were pouring out cynical remarks.But there wasn\u2019t any change in Roan\u2019s expression.He pointed at the end of the plains with his finger.The camp of Istel kingdom.\u201cLook at their camp.\u201dAt those words, they stopped laughing and turned to look at the camp.80,000 soldiers had set up camps while scattered about.\u201cEven if their number is amazing, the structure of their camp is too sloppy. This is just like they set it up however it turned out.\u201dRoan\u2019s words were true.Although it was difficult to set up a camp because the numbers were big, even taking that into account, their camp was excessively unsteady.Aaron mumbled as if he thought of something.\u201cThat feels like they just camped down temporarily.\u201dAt those words Roan nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. They aren\u2019t thinking of staying in that place for long.\u201dThen, Philips said.\u201cHo! Did you judge that they will make a night raid just by looking that? Just with that one reason?\u201dHe clicked his tongue and shook his head.Even the other commanders didn\u2019t falter.However Roan\u2019s expression was still composed.He gave Aaron a pile of papers.\u201cWill you look at this?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cInformation about the generals of Istel kingdom.\u201dAt those words Aaron looked at the paper with a surprised look.\u2018When did he\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019There was information written about important commanders on it.But of course, it wasn\u2019t minute and detailed information.Their outlines, outer appearances, descriptions, and temperaments.There also was information written about what merits they had achieved.\u2018Although I couldn\u2019t gather internal information, it was made up with the stories of the citizens as the background, but just with that, it became amazing information.\u2019It was information Chris and his agency gathered themselves while they were preparing for war.For this they roamed pubs, plazas, slums, brothels, and also markets.The newly made information that squad soldiers roamed these places and received the role of checking how well this information matched with the reports.\u201cCommander Aaron. Why are you that surprised?\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201dThe commanders stuck themselves next to Aaron.\u201cOho!\u201d\u201cThis is really amazing.\u201dThe commanders gulped air.Roan said as if he was waiting for it.\u201cThe commander in charge of leading the army is Looter Beil. You will know if you see the reports but he\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe commanders all turned to look at Roan.\u201cHe has a really strong fighting spirit. Looter Bale has already tried surprise attacks and night raids along the Aimas alliance.\u201dAt those words everyone nodded.The report was certainly written like that.\u2018Even in my past life, Looter Baile decided to go with a night raid when he first met with Rinse kingdom.\u2019Although the time and place were different, Looter was a commander that had that tendency.The tendency of the commander and the structure of the camp.On top of that, Roan\u2019s memories.The possibility for a night raid was plentiful.\u201cHmm.\u201dPhilip smacked his lips and cleared his throat.He had a somewhat uncomfortable look.\u201cThen, you are saying that we have to prepare for a night raid, right?\u201dAnyways, preparing for a night raid wasn\u2019t that big of a thing.On top of that, if they prepared for it but nothing happened, there wasn\u2019t that big of a loss.\u2018If I keep insisting here but they do make a night raid\u2026\u2026..\u2019They would rather face large losses.The commanders all turned to look at Roan.Roan matched their sights and shook his head.\u201cNo. We have to prepare for one more thing.\u201dAt those words, Philip frowned.\u201cWe have to prepare for one more thing?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoan replied shortly and took in a deep breath.He wanted to bring the flow of this battlefield to Rinse kingdom.Roan continued saying while looking at the faces of the commanders.\u201cWe have to prepare for a counter raid.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We have finished preparations for the raid.\u201dAt the soldier\u2019s report, Looter faintly smiled and nodded.\u2018Then, shall we also run a bit today?\u2019He went towards the entrance.5.000 cavalrymen were showing a dignified look.The horses had their mouths covered with a gag and the horse shoes were covered with cloths filled with grass.Looter raised his right arm high.\u201cLet\u2019s show the strength of Istel kingdom to the Rinse bastards.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA low reply came from them.A weird nervousness flowed with the wind.\u201cCharge!\u201dLooter grabbed the reins and walked.He was pulling and walking the horse to not make any sounds.5,000 cavalrymen followed behind his back.5,000 cavalrymen.That was the most suitable number to do a night raid.\u2018We retreat quickly after having messed them up.\u2019Even so, it wasn\u2019t that it ended with just one night raid.When they were confused, he was planning to try raiding it once more.\u2018It wouldn\u2019t even cross their minds.\u2019A smile appeared on Looter\u2019s face.He was the happiest in this moment.Joy covered his body.Soon, he could see the wooden fences that were set up in a solid fashion.\u2018We are charging in one go.\u2019Looter got up on his horse and took in a deep breath.And the others also did the same.He uncovered the gag of the horses and kicked them.Dudududu.The warhorse fiercely charged and then jumped over the fence nimbly.Behind him, 5,000 soldiers followed him.\u201cSet it on fire! Run amok as you wish!\u201d\u201cWaaaaaaaaaa!\u201dThe soldiers, who were holding their breaths, let out cries.They crumbled the bonfires and set the big and small tents on fire.They were really spirited.However, it didn\u2019t last long until they realized that something wasn\u2019t right.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dThe soldiers who were setting things on fire stopped with a perplexed expression.Silence.An uneasy silence roamed inside the camp.They didn\u2019t see guards nor soldiers that got out of the tents.\u2018Damn! Something is wrong!\u2019Looter looked at his surroundings and grinded his teeth.Tens and hundreds of tents were burning, but the people of Rinse kingdom didn\u2019t even stick out their noses.Then, a sharp noise was heard.Sweeeee!\u2018Arrow!\u2019Looter instinctively pulled the reins and moved towards the back of the burning tent.At that same moment.Pubububuk!A rain of arrows poured over the cavalrymen.\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThey became porcupines who were not able to prepare themselves, and collapsed.\u2018Damn! The Rinse bastards were already aware of the night raid!\u2019Looter clenched his fists with a frustrated look.\u201cRetreat! Retreat!\u201dThe raid was a failure.Retreating was the only option left if they wanted to live.\u201cRetreat! Retreat!\u201dThe cavalrymen repeated the command and pulled the reins.They dodged the pouring arrows and ran towards the entrance of the camp.But.\u201cWhen you enter, you can come as you wish. But if you want to leave, you have to receive permission!\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to go?!\u201dThousands of swordsmen and spearmen lined up following the fence.At the same time, cavalrymen appeared inside the camp.It was a perfectly encircled situation.\u2018Damn. I can\u2019t do anything in this situation!\u2019Looter grinded his teeth.There were no methods.No, there was only one order he could lay out.\u201cPierce through!\u201dAnd that was piercing through the blockade and returning to their camp.At Looter\u2019s orders, the cavalrymen started to run towards the swordsmen and spearmen.And Looter also followed his back.\u201cBlock them!\u201d\u201cRaise your spears!\u201d\u201cStab the horses!\u201dThe spearmen of Rinse kingdom raised their spears high, grouped together, and made a root formation.It was to stop them from piercing through.Bang!The people of the two kingdoms clashed.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The sound of metal clanging together was heard along with sparks.An unavoidable battle occurred.The spearmen and swordsmen didn\u2019t get pushed back easily.And they didn\u2019t even let them pierce through.Because of that, Looter and the 5,000 cavalrymen were trapped inside and wavered.Meanwhile, the cavalrymen of Rinse kingdom attacked their backs.\u201cLet\u2019s show the strength of Rinse kingdom to these bastards!\u201d\u201cWe will send you to hell!\u201dA really spirited cry rang out.The cavalrymen of Rinse kingdom pushed the other cavalrymen fiercely.The cavalrymen of Istel kingdom collapsed helplessly at the attack from both sides.\u201cKugh.\u201d\u201cKek.\u201dThese last words were heard everywhere.\u2018Damn! Can\u2019t keep like this!\u2019Looter grinded his teeth and went to the front.\u201cDamn! Get away! Get away!\u201dHe pulled up his mana and massacred the spearmen and swordsmen.Slash! Stab!The power of mana was amazing.Looter faced the normal soldiers who had a big build like he was facing kids.Every time he swung his blade, one or two soldiers lost their heads and collapsed.\u201cThe ones that don\u2019t want to die get away! Get away!\u201dLooter yelled.The soldiers and spearmen hesitated and fell back.They became scared at his overwhelming power.\u2018Normal soldiers can\u2019t face a corps commander that knows how to use mana.\u2019Roan, who was facing the normal soldiers at a place a bit far away grinded his teeth.\u2018If I leave them be, our losses will only increase!\u2019He couldn\u2019t let them just dielike that.He cut off the neck of one cavalryman charging at him and then looked towards Austin and Keep.\u201cAustin! Keep! Make me a foothold!\u201dAustin and Keep, who were facing the cavalrymen, understood Roan\u2019s orders in an instant.The two people put the spears at both of their sides and looked at Roan.Roan slightly nodded and then charged forward.One thread of mana surged up from his mana hole.The muscles of his two legs twitched and were filled with energy.Austin and Keep looked at each other and then rebounded their knees.\u2018One, two, three!\u2019At the same time, Roan stepped on the two spears and jumped.Pat!Roan surged to the air using the rebound strength of the spear and his kicking strength.Roan lightly jumped over the cavalrymen and flew towards Looter.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dThe cavalrymen of Istel kingdom looked at him and had surprised expressions.Looter, who was massacring the soldiers, discovered that Roan was flying towards him too late.\u201cThis imposible\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201dLooter hurriedly tried to pull back the spear to hit Roan, but it was already too late.Roan\u2019s spear pierced the air and stabbed in towards Looter\u2019s chest.\u2018Damn!\u2019Looter twisted his upper body unavoidably and dodged below the horse.Stab!Roan\u2019s spear fell in the place he dodged.The spear was deeply stabbed into the horse.Hiiiiiiing!The horse cried roughly and shook its body.Roan kicked the head of the horse like that and lightly landed while out pulling his spear.Meanwhile, Looter who was rolling on the ground with a perplexed look, glared at Roan and fixed his posture.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m vice troop commander Roan of rose troop from the 7th corps.\u201d\u201cVice troop commander? Not even a general, but a mere adjutant? Hmph!\u201dLooter snorted and raised his longsword.\u201cLooter Bale of the 1st corps of the western forces of Istel kingdom will cut off your neck.\u201dHe thought little of Roan.Although he was at the intermediate-low level, his body had learned mana.He wasn\u2019t at a level where a normal soldier could face him.But of course, this guess of his was completely wrong.Tat!Looter got up from the ground quickly and ran towards Roan.This was because it was dangerous to keep distance while facing someone holding a long distance weapon such as a spear.Roan looked at Looter charging at himself and grinded his teeth.\u2018I\u2019ll get rid of him when he\u2019s careless.\u2019He couldn\u2019t use mana openly.Roan swung his spear with all his strength.It wasn\u2019t a simple spear technique, but Roan\u2019s spearmanship.Spat!A sharp sound was heard along the spear.\u201cHph!\u201dLooter, who was charging in boldly, gulped some air and swung his sword.Cheng!A pleasing sound of metal against metal rang out.The spear was bounced off to the side.\u2018Kugh. Certainly, the strength of mana\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan grinded his teeth as he felt his palms going numb.However, it wasn\u2019t to the point that he couldn\u2019t endure it.He moved his two arms close to his body and pulled the spear that was bounced off with all his strength.The spear that had lost its direction once again turned to attack Looter.\u2018Damn!\u2019Looter grinded his teeth and swung his sword when he looked at the spear that continued softly.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!Sparks appeared alongside the noise of metal sound.At first glance, they were even.But Looter was getting closer to Roan little by little.Tuk.Finally, Looter\u2019s right foot reached Roan\u2019s left foot.\u201cDie!\u201dLooter tried to stab him with his blade.This was the critical moment.However, Roan\u2019s expression was still composed.\u2018I waited for this!\u2019He inserted mana to his eyes.At that instant.Pat!The movements of the people became sickeningly slow and the whole world was dyed in golden light.The golden light that filled his sight was mana.Roan just looked at Looter\u2019s sword that was coming into him.\u2018So mana moves like this.\u2019As the proficiency he currently achieved was low, he couldn\u2019t grasp everything clearly. But, he could guess that the mana was flowing towards the blade from Looter\u2019s mana hole.Most of all, the mana that moved along with Looter\u2019s movement was clearly seen.\u2018I\u2019m ending it here.\u2019Roan already felt his eye getting hot.As he used mana and also Kalian\u2019s tear, his eye was beginning to feel the burden.He quickly twisted his body to dodge Looter\u2019s blade and then he closed in on him.Swuuuuush.A really slow movement.Although Roan was also moving while utilizing mana, the movements he saw by utilizing mana was so slow, it could make him yawn.\u2018Reid\u2019s battling technique.\u2019He grabbed the spear with his right hand and executed the basic stances of Reid\u2019s battle technique.Swush.The fist moved towards Looter\u2019s abdomen.\u201cKuuuuuuugh.\u201dThe sound of Looter gulping down the sound became loud.At the same time, he closed in on the shoulder that was swinging the sword and he twisted his body.Spaaaaaat!Roan\u2019s fist barely missed Looter\u2019s abdomen.At that moment, he felt an expression of relief from Looter.\u2018There\u2019s no need to like it that much. As this isn\u2019t the end.\u2019Roan pressed down the shoulder with the fist that missed.At that instant, the balance crumbled and his whole body twisted to the left.It was a look that seemed like they would fall to the ground.Roan wasn\u2019t perplexed and then pulled his left arm to his right side and turned his body.At the same time he wrapped Looter\u2019s legs with his right leg.Tuuuuuk!Looter\u2019s leg was trapped between his thigh and calf.\u201cUhhhhhhhh!\u201dLooter\u2019s surprised voice became long.Roan just pulled his leg like that.Looter couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and lost his balance.Looter slowly collapsed.Then.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Roan blinked at the pain he felt in his eyes.At that instant, the world that was dyed in golden light turned to its original look.Looter, who was falling so slowly it made you yawn, collapsed in an instant.Boom!\u201cUhh.\u201dLooter couldn\u2019t get a hold of himself.\u2018Damn! To wrap my legs in that situation.\u2019It was an attack he hadn\u2019t expected at all.\u2018It\u2019s dangerous like this!\u2019He tried to turn his body quickly and stand up.At that moment.Puk!He felt a strong shock in his side.\u201cKuhuk!\u201dA feeling like his breath was cut shot through him.Roan had kicked his side.Looter flipped and spread out while looking at the sky.Tuk.Roan aimed at Looter\u2019s throat with his spear.Looter had a helpless expression.\u201cKugh. Damn. To fall by a normal soldier and not even a general.\u201dHe let out a sigh.\u201cWhew. Is the Gale of Istel ending here?\u201dAt those words Roan put strength in his hands.\u201cYou blew somewhere where you shouldn\u2019t have gone in the first place.\u201dAt the same time, the spear moved.Slash.A line appeared on Looter\u2019s neck and then, his head became separated from his body.Roan stabbed the head with his spear and raised it high to the sky.\u201cVice troop commander Roan of rose troop from the 7th corps has slain the neck of the enemy commander!\u201dA loud yell resonated out.\u201cHuh? Corps commander Beil?!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201dEven so, the army of Istel kingdom that was getting pushed back one sidedly, looked at Looter\u2019s head and suffered a setback.The bastards that were struggling until the end threw their weapons and surrendered.\u201cHahaha! Roan! It\u2019s a complete victory. A complete victory!\u201dAaron approached while riding his horse.He also saw the other commanders at his back.They were a bit surprised as the night raid had happened just like Roan had predicted it.Aaron looked at the big and small tents that were on fire.\u201cPut the fires out!\u201dIf they acted later, the whole camp would be covered in fire.Then, Roan stepped up.\u201cIt would be good to put the fire off later.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAaron asked back what he meant.Roan looked at the camp of Istel kingdom that was located at the other side of the plains.\u201cIf we catch the fire quickly, they may realize that the raid had failed. Now, rather than putting it out\u2026\u2026\u201dHe put strength in his voice.\u201cIt\u2019s time to go for a counter raid.\u201d\u201cRight. It may look like we are the ones in chaos.\u201dAaron nodded.After that, he prepared 5,000 cavalrymen with Mendel at the front.Behind them, more than 10,000 infantrymen moved into formation.\u201cThen, we will also depart after we cover the horses with gags.\u201dMendel had a really spirited expression.At that look, Roan shook his head.\u201cNo. It would be good to let the 5,000 cavalrymen advance like this.\u201d\u201cLike this? Are you telling me that we have to advance without covering the horses with gags in a frontal attack?\u201dAt Mendel\u2019s question, Roan nodded.\u201cOur camp is already on fire. And Istel kingdom will also be looking at this. They will be thinking that the raid was a success. Because of that, when 5,000 cavalrymen approach their camp they will think that their allies are returning to the camp after having succeeded in the raid.\u201d\u201cAh! Right. It will be impossible to check if they are friends or foes in this dark night!\u201dRoan nodded.\u201cYes. So don\u2019t advance while covering the horses with gags, but instead approach them as fast as possible and the moment you enter their camp, set it on fire and run amok as you please.\u201dContinued by that, he looked at the 10,000 archers.\u201cFollowed by that, the spearmen and swordsmen will sweep them up.\u201dAt those words Mendel nodded.And Aaron and the other commanders also did the same.\u201cLet\u2019s do as Roan says.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s order, Mendel slightly bowed and moved out of the camp while he was leading the cavalrymen.Dudududu.The sound of horse steps was clearly heard.At the same time, the 10,000 swordsmen and spearmen left the camp without any sound.They had all covered their faces and armour with dirt.Because of that, they became one with the darkness.And of course, the one in front of the 10,000 soldiers was Roan.Sasasasak.They crossed over the long grass.A dense smell of blood was wafting through the air.When they approached the camp of Istel kingdom.Waaaaaa!Flames surged up from the insides of the camp.Roan\u2019s eyes shined.\u2018It\u2019s now our turn.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did this happen?\u2019Prain, who was in charge of guarding of the camp, didn\u2019t have any control.Even until flames surged up in the camp of Rinse kingdom and noises were heard, he thought that the raid was a success.And it was also because the fire wasn\u2019t put out, but it spread even more.After a while, when thousands of cavalrymen were coming back to his camp, he thought that Looter was returning.The reason he had opened the gates with a really happy voice was also because of that.But the cavalrymen that entered the camp wasn\u2019t Looter\u2019s army.\u2018They, they are from Rinse kingdom!\u2019Prain came to realize this too late.He yelled towards the guards.\u201cRi, ring the bell! Ring the bell and hit the jing!\u201dHe had to let the others know of the infiltration by the enemy.He had to let the others know that the raid was a failure and they were the ones getting attacked.\u201cYe, yes!\u201dThe soldiers who were checking the situation with absent-minded expressions ran towards the bell and the jing.Then.Sweeeee!A sharp sound was heard.Pubububuk!\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThen, the soldiers fell by becoming like porcupines.At the same time, the people of Rinse kingdom came pouring in from the open entrance.\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cSet everything on fire and collapse the tents!\u201d\u201cBreak the stables and release the horses!\u201dThe 10,000 soldiers entered the camp recklessly.\u201cHuh?! Uh\u2026\u2026..\u201dPrain stepped back with a perplexed look.\u2018This large scaled surprise attack\u2026\u2026..\u2019He had never thought that they would attack them, they had lower numbers in the first place.\u2018I, I have to let the commanders know of this!\u2019Prain turned back and tried to run towards the camp.At that moment, he felt a chilly presence at his back.Stab.At the same time, the sharp spear pierced the back of his head.\u201cAttack! Everyone attack!\u201dThe owner of the voice yelled out.The one who stabbed the back of Prain was Roan.Stab.He pulled his spear and charged the ground.\u201cUoooooooo! Wha, what\u2019s happening!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise attack!\u201d\u201cDamn! Ar.. armour! Bring me the armour!\u201dThe soldiers of Istel kingdom were really confused by the sudden attack.Because of the forced march that lasted nine days, they were really exhausted.Thanks to that, they just believed in Looter\u2019s night raid and rested without thinking of anything else.As the army of Rinse kingdom appeared in this situation, the soldiers couldn\u2019t even wear their armour and got out of their tents holding their weapons.And that was the same for adjutants and generals.\u201cKuhuk! How, how are the Rinse kingdom\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat happened with corps commander Beil!\u201d\u201cKugh.\u201dThey yelled with a really perplexed expression.\u201cBlock them!\u201d\u201cStop the fire!\u201dThe commanders got a hold of themselves and led the soldiers.But at the unexpected attack, they were in chaos.Stab. Slash.And Rinse kingdom didn\u2019t miss this opportunity.A one sided massacre and annihilation occurred.\u201cBastards of Istel kingdom, fuck off to Istel!\u201d\u201cReturn to your land!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dThe soldiers of Rinse kingdom attacked them with raging bellows.Everyone swung their own weapons.But even amongst them, the most outstanding one was Roan.He was mixing Kalian\u2019s tear, Brent\u2019s ring, and the Flamdor mana technique suitably and showing the prowess of a monster.Swing. Swing.The spear turned roughly by riding the palm.And everytime, several soldiers of Istel kingdom collapsed while shedding blood.\u201cKugh.\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dRoan didn\u2019t show any mercy, even to the fallen ones.\u2018I can\u2019t leave any future trouble.\u2019If it wasn\u2019t a situation where he could completely subdue them, he had to certainly kill them.That was his ethics in battle, battlefields, and war.The battle flowed one sidedly, but even so it wasn\u2019t a situation where he could loosen himself.\u2018If I make a mistake, I can get by legs grabbed.\u2019A raid was a raid.If he became greedy because he was drunk in victory, he could suffer a big blow.They were inside a camp with more than 8,000 soldiers anyways.\u201cStaff officer Mendel! Going deeper than this is dangerous!\u201dAt Roan\u2019s yell, Mendel who was fiercely pushing back the enemies pulled back the reins.\u2018We moved deeper in than what I thought.\u2019As he slew the bastards of Istel kingdom that fell helplessly, he turned up entering to a deep place even without knowing.\u201cFall back! Fall back!\u201dMendel turned the head of his horse and yelled with strength.Likewise, the cavalrymen that were pushing back the enemies started to retreat one by one.\u2018Even so, it\u2019s fortunate that we didn\u2019t fall into a trap or become surrounded.\u2019When he thought until then.A really displeasing sound was heard.Sweeeeee!A sharp sound rang out.But it was heavier and more horrible than when a normal arrow pierced the air.When Mendel thoughtlessly turned to look back.Puuuuk!A long spear pierced three cavalrymen alongside the terrible sound.At the same time, the men of Istel kingdom scattered to the sides.\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dMendel and the cavalrymen had surprised expressions at the sudden situation.Their sight moved to the insides of the camp.From between the split army, a group of people that were wearing flashy armour appeared.Likewise, Roan also opened his eyes roundly.\u2018They are knights!\u2019An existence he didn\u2019t want to face at all.Different than normal soldiers, knights knew how to use mana.But fortunately, their number wasn\u2019t that big.At most, 30 men.But even with just that, it was a number that you couldn\u2019t just ignore them.\u201cRe, retreat! Retreat! We are falling back quickly!\u201dMendel instantly grasped the situation.He looked at the knights that were approaching them fiercely and yelled.Hiiiiing!The cavalrymen that hurriedly kick their horses.But unfortunately the movements of the knights were a bit faster.Stap! Slash! Spat!A sharp long sword slashed the cavalrymen.\u201cKuok!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe cavalrymen fell helplessly.\u2018Damn. For the knights to appear this quickly\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan ground his teeth.In the raid group of Rinse kingdom\u2019s army, there weren\u2019t even ten people who knew how to use mana.\u2018It\u2019s one of the biggest weak points among weak points.\u2019One of the biggest weakness that an army guarding a region had was the presence of knights and mages.Only staff officers and the small minority of troop commanders knew how to use mana.A really small minority at that.Most belonged to the army of a region or a noble family.Because of that Roan, Gale, Aaron, etc. wished for a more active participation from the region\u2019s army.But Benjamin ignored the report and they had set up a camp at their rear.\u2018Are the only ones I can believe in are Count Lancephil\u2019s knights and the region\u2019s army?\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.At Aaron\u2019s report, Io reacted right away.But he was the owner of Lancephil\u2019s territory.He couldn\u2019t just ignorantly step out to defend the boundary.\u2018They have to get rid of Istel kingdom\u2019s army who are sweeping up the territory.\u2019Because of that, they were late in joining.Compared to that, as Istel kingdom was on the invading side, they had some knights in their ranks.Only that as the knights were quite an important force, there was a large possibility they would be staying at the rear of the camp.\u2018I thought that they wouldn\u2019t show themselves until a full scaled battle happened.Roan let out a sigh.\u2018If the mage squad appears like this\u2026\u2026..\u2019This would become a trouble beyond troubles.They had already achieved a great victory in the raid.\u2018We have to hurriedly retreat.\u2019If they suffer a big blow here, then succeeding in the raid became meaningless.Roan gripped the spear tightly.He saw the knights massacring the cavalrymen.\u2018Hmm.\u2019His eyes shone.\u2018I thought that the knights appeared quite fast, but they are all greenhorns.\u2019Although they certainly show great might, their movements were big and unnatural.\u2018They are just guys that are in their apprenticeships.\u2019They were guys that were deployed probably to accumulate real experience.\u2018Then\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019When they were still drunk in the heat of the battlefield.They wouldn\u2019t have any mind of themselves as they were busy slaying the soldiers in front of them.\u2018Hph.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath and pulled some mana.A heat that spread out while flowing into his palm.He threw his spear with strength.Sweeeeek!A sharp sound.The spear showed a chilly intent and split the air.One of the knights who was massacring the soldiers snorted when he looked at the flying spear.\u201cHmph!\u201dHe was confident in being able to block a spear that was thrown by a normal soldier lightly.The young knight didn\u2019t even dodge the spear and lightly swung his blade.Then, the voice of a man that was leading the knights was heard.\u201cDon\u2019t block it and dodge!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dOnly then had the young knight realized that something was wrong and twisted his body, but it was already late.Puk!Roan\u2019s spear pierced the body.\u201cGrr.\u201dHis neck snapped along with the last words.The young knight died with having a spear pierced in his body.\u2018Impossible!\u2019The knights who were looking at the scene, looked at the spear with a surprised look.\u2018A knight couldn\u2019t block a spear thrown by a normal soldier?\u2019\u2018Is it possible to throw the spear from that distance, pierce the body, and stab it into the ground?\u2019Everyone\u2019s eyes shone with doubt.Then, Mendel and the cavalrymen hurriedly ran towards the rear.\u201cHuh?! Catch them!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe knights got a hold of themselves late and tried to kick off the ground.There was a soldier that rushed into the insides of the camp, different than the cavalrymen that were retreating.He had empty hands that didn\u2019t have a spear or a sword.The youth with the childish face was Roan.He charged the ground and jumped to the air.\u2018I have to buy a little time!\u2019He just needed to buy time for his comrades to retreat.He was confident in being able to buy that much time while facing the greenhorn knights.Mana flowed into both of his fists.\u2018Reid\u2019s battle technique.\u2019It wasn\u2019t only at the level of imitating the movements while holding a spear.What Roan tried to execute was the basic technique of Reid\u2019s battle technique.The two fists split the air while moving in a strange fashion.\u201cCrazy bastard!\u201dThe young knights swung their swords with all their strength.They were stiffened by the sudden death of their comrade.They had realized that death was quite a close to them.They had smelled the smell of the battlefield, the smell of death.Swush.Roan dodged the sword by moving his upper body and then turned.At that short moment, his two fists split the air.Pububuk!The body of the young knight was hit by Roan\u2019s fists.The flashy armour became bent and squashed.\u201cKuk!\u201dThe knight staggered at the shock that shook his insides and fell.Roan hurriedly took away the sword of the knight and stabbed it downwards.Stab.The long sword was stabbed into the neck of the young knight like that.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cThis son of a bitch!\u201dThe other knights realized the situation too late and attacked Roan.Roan calmly breathed in, and then threw the blade along with the corpse of the knight.\u201cDamn!\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201dThe knights that were charging in were surprised and dodged.And Roan didn\u2019t miss that moment.He hurriedly threw his body to the ground and grabbed the spear stuck in the ground.Puuk!He kicked the knight that had the spear pierced in his body and put strength in his hand.Spat!The spear rose to the sky.Roan turned his body following the spear and pulled some mana.The allied soldiers were retreating to the entrance of the camp.There was no need to hide his use of mana right now.Paat!The spear that had mana split the air as if it was dancing.Roan executed the strong techniques consecutively.\u201cKugh! This bastard! You weren\u2019t a normal soldier!\u201d\u201cBe careful! The strength behind the spear isn\u2019t normal!\u201dThe knights realized Roan\u2019s true strength too late.In this instance, the one who was in a situation difficult was Roan.Although he was practicing Flamdor mana technique and Reid\u2019s battle technique, the actual training time wasn\u2019t that long.If 30 knights assaulted him at once, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do a thing.\u2018I have to fall back before it becomes even too late for me.\u2019Roan clearly realized when he had to step in and fall back.That was the precious experience and intuition he obtained while roaming the battlefield for 20 years.The spear that had mana behind it, split the air and stabbed towards the body of a knight.\u201cWhere!\u201dBut the knights, who got ahold of themselves late, didn\u2019t face Roan\u2019s spear sloppily.The moment they swung their swords to knock away the spear, they twisted their body to the side.It was a movement to completely dodge the strength behind the spear.But the next movement Roan did, completely missed the knight\u2019s common sense by a lot.Spat!Roan threw away the spear he was holding.Sweeee!It was a sudden javelin throw.The knights looked at the spear thrown in front of them and hurriedly dodged.As they saw that their ally had just died because the body was pierced by the spear, they couldn\u2019t even think of blocking it.\u2018Okay! Now!\u2019Roan didn\u2019t miss that opportunityHe hurriedly charged and threw his body.He was attacking them fiercely but started to fall back.\u201cCa, catch him!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lose him! We have to at least catch him!\u201dAn enemy that used mana was an existence you had to capture or kill.The knights chased Roan\u2019s back a step behind him.\u201cBlock!\u201dThe normal soldiers of Istel kingdom blocked Roan\u2019s fleeing path.This was the moment of life or death.However, Roan\u2019s eyes calmly sank.\u2018Left, right, right again, after that I make him fall by putting my feet\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Because of Kalian\u2019s tear, he could grasp all the information in an instant.Spat!Roan moved his body to the sides and ran while dodging the soldiers.Swong.When a sword or a spear was about to reach him, he grabbed the neck and arm of a soldier and pulled him.\u201cHuh?! Uh!\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201dPerplexed yells came out of their mouths.Slash. Stab.A horrible sound.The soldiers of Istel kingdom stabbed their weapons into their allies, and not Roan.\u201cDamn!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t swing your weapons mindlessly!\u201dAt their spears and swords, an ally died.That truth made the soldiers completely stiff.Because of that, Roan\u2019s movements became even more natural.Pabat!He soon reached the entrance of the camp.Then, a displeasing sound was heard from his back.\u201cKuhk!\u201d\u201cWe, we are allie\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe yells of Istel kingdom\u2019s soldiers.As Roan glanced back, he saw one knight charging at him fiercely.A huge body with a thick lined face.He was the commander of the greenhorn knights.He, who seemed to be in his thirties, was running in a straight line while pushing away the allies in his front.\u201cBastard! Don\u2019t dodge and receive my sword!\u201dHe had a voice that was like thunder.He was Vernon Pollet, who had an outstanding skill in the blade, even amongst the young knights.Although his skills were outstanding, he was quite hot tempered he was called the crazy bear of Istel.Roan fell the soldiers at his side and charged forward.This wasn\u2019t a situation to battle him leisurely.Then, he saw a warhorse roaming in the insides of the camp.\u2018Good!\u2019Roan changed directions and ran towards the warhorse.\u201cHmph!\u201dVernon snorted and followed Roan\u2019s back.As the level of mana operation was in a higher level, the distance between the two of them was closing in bit by bit.Hiiiiing.The cry of the horse was heard close by.It was at a distance that seemed to be right in front of his nose.But rather than the distance between the horse, his distance with Vernon was much closer.\u201cStop!\u201dVernon yelled and raised his sword.He was in a really risky situation.Then, Roan\u2019s eyes shined.\u2018That!\u2019His sight moved to the sides.\u2018Okay!\u2019He was looking at something others couldn\u2019t see.A smile appeared in his face.A faint sound was heard.Sweeeeee!A sharp sound.However, Roan kept running to the horse and didn\u2019t show much of a movement.Meanwhile, the distance between them closed even more.\u201cDie!\u201dVernon tried to hack down the sword he had raised up.Then.Spat!One arrow passed next to Roan\u2019s left ear as if it grazed him.At the same time.Puk!The arrow was stabbed into Vernon\u2019s left eye along with a horrible sound.\u201cUaaaaaaaak!\u201dVernon, who was about to slash Roan in any moment, collapsed with a cry.It was a situation that would make you surprised, but Roan didn\u2019t even look back and just charged forward and then jumped.Hiiiing!The rough cry of the horse that was spread out.He pulled the reins and kicked the horse.Dudududu.The horse ran outside the camp.\u201cUaaaaaaaa! My eye! My eye!\u201dVernon\u2019s yell was heard from his back.Pubububuk.The arrows the soldiers of Istel fired off late fell behind his back.Roan stuck his chest close to the horse.The place he was heading to wasn\u2019t the camp of Rinse kingdom.It was to a place outside the line.One youth was guarding that place alone.Roan didn\u2019t lower the speed of the horse and extended his left arm.\u201cGrab it!\u201dAt the loud yell, the youth also extended his hand.Pat!He grabbed Roan\u2019s arm and then lightly jumped and got on the horse.Roan turned the head of the horse towards Rinse kingdom\u2019s camp.He yelled towards the youth at his back.\u201cHarrison! I was able to keep my life because of you!\u201dThe youth that was guarding the place was none other than Harrison.Harrison let out a long sigh.\u201cHonestly speaking, I wasn\u2019t confident.\u201dAt those words Roan shook his head.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t even an inch of mistake. It barely grazed my ear and it stabbed the left eye of that bastard.\u201dThat one arrow that saved Roan\u2019s life.The person that fired that was none other than Harrison.He had a really excellent ability.Harrison looked at the camp that was already close and yelled.\u201cThe raid was a success!\u201dAt those words Roan brightly smiled and shook his head.\u201cNo, no.\u201dAnd then yelled with all his strength.\u201cIt\u2019s not a normal victory, but a great one!\u201dDifferent to his bright expression, his eyes sunk calmly.Roan mumbled in a low voice.\u201cAlthough the war has just started\u2026\u2026.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!Thank you for reading!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 69 - War and more war (7)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySponsored chapter!The surprise attack was a big success.They almost didn\u2019t have any casualties and the enemy camp became a sea of fire.On top of that, they slew the only capable commander, Looter.This was a real big success.\u201cHow about attacking once more?\u201dAaron carefully asked while looking at the enemy camp that was on fire.Roan shook his head.\u201cNo. Although they wouldn\u2019t have any control because they are putting the fire off\u2026..\u201dRoan looked at Aaron and the commanders and continued talking.\u201cNow, it would be good to retreat.\u201dAt those words, everyone frowned.\u201cRetreat? You want us to retreat after attaining this victory?\u201dRoan nodded with a calm expression.His eyes calmly sank down.\u2018If I get to raise a force, the first thing I have would to do would be changing the commanders.\u2019The actual Rinse kingdom, no, the majority of the kingdoms that were located east of the Grain mountains operated by approximating numbers.Especially in the cases of corps commanders, many were part of a baron\u2019s family but the problem was that they attained their ranks without having any relation to their skills.\u2018Even in this place, excluding corps commander Aaron Tate, and Phillip Hass, the others are all commanders in name.\u2019The others were the ones who spent their lives as corps commanders without having any merits to back them up because of the excuse of being the eldest son of a noble family.\u2018In the selection of a commander, abilities and human nature should come first.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.It was time to convince the commanders who only knew how to fight boldly without any abilities.\u201cThe enemy knights are already outside of their camp. On top of that, the mages would also have finished preparations. Compared to them, we don\u2019t have knights nor mages. If we were attacked in this state, we would suffer big losses. And if it turned out like that, the success of the surprise attack becomes meaningless.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dAt the stipulation about the knights and mages, the commanders shut their mouths.Phillip, who was the eldest, nodded.\u201cIt was also Roan that guessed the surprise attack and proposed counter attacking them. I think that it\u2019d be good to also listen to him this time.\u201dHis attitude had changed a lot from when he first met Roan. He was different than the other commanders who were only greedy without having abilities to back them up. Because he had been in the battlefield for a long period of time, he didn\u2019t have any unnecessary greed or stubbornness.\u2018We can\u2019t keep ignoring him when he has showed such amazing performance.\u2019Although his eyes were dark, he had recognized someone with the abilities.\u201cI think that would be good.\u201dAaron added and came to a conclusion.\u201cThen, let\u2019s retreat immediately.\u201dAs the situation turned out like this, Roan quickly revealed his thoughts.\u201cI think it would be good to first make the infantry retreat while lighting up the torches and leaving the tents intact.\u201dAt this statement, Aaron and Phillips immediately realized his reasoning.\u201cYou want us to seem like we\u2019re protecting this place.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRoan brightly smiled and replied back.Aaron called Mendel and sent out the order of retreat.And then, the whole camp started to move busily.\u201cRoan.\u201dAaron called out Roan separately.Roan slightly bowed and approached.\u201cThe merits you\u2019ve achieved by slaying the enemy commander and succeeding in the surprise attack is really big. I will certainly reward you after the war ends.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dRoan saluted shortly afterwards.A proud smile appeared on Aaron\u2019s face.\u2018He\u2019s someone that I really don\u2019t want to let go of.\u2019He was someone he liked more and more the more time passed.\u2018As he slew a corps commander of Istel kingdom\u2026\u2026..\u2019If he did well, he may be able to give him a title of nobility; a title of at least a baron.This would be his incorporation into the noble\u2019s world.\u2018I\u2019ll have to show my strength at least once.\u2019But to do that, it was important to attain victory in this war.After a while, Mendel approached and bowed.\u201cWe have finished the preparations to retreat.\u201dAaron faintly smiled and looked at the other commanders.\u2018I can\u2019t leave them behind.\u2019Retreating to Nerf region, where the camp of their allies was located, was the safest path.\u201cMy 7th corps will stay behind.\u201dAs soon as Aaron finished speaking, the other commanders had surprised expressions.\u201cOh! Will you really?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve made a really difficult decision.\u201dThey became happy at the truth that they would be able to retreat to a safe zone first.Aaron bitterly smiled as he looked at their expressions.\u2018The person that is suited to be in that position is Roan.\u2019He was talking about the bastards that occupied the seats of a commander just because they were nobles.He felt bitter.\u201cThen, I will leave it to you.\u201dPhillip approached and extended his hand.Aaron grabbed that hand and said the same thing.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201dPhillip, who realized what that meant, smiled bitterly.After a while, the commanders left the camp while leading the infantry with Phillip at the front.As the retreat happened really quietly in the middle of the darkness, Istel kingdom didn\u2019t realize it at all.Aaron looked at the back of the commanders getting farther away and let out a sigh.\u201cWhew. Nothing has to happen.\u201dAt those words, Roan and Mendel bitterly smiled.\u201cDoes something have to happen?\u201dAaron nodded.\u201cRight. As commander Hass is there, would something really happen?\u201dHe awkwardly smiled and looked at Roan.As a result, Roan also faced him and smiled.But they couldn\u2019t expect it at all.That the maybe would catch the person.*****When the sun rose, the 7th corps also started to prepare their retreat.Roan stood in the middle of the empty camp and extended both of his arms.\u201cI think that it would be good to start a fire and make smoke appeared as if we are eating.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a good method.\u201dAaron nodded with a satisfied expression.Soon, they lit up three thousand fires to make it look as if they were boiling soup and heating up bread.They gathered plenty of branches and leaves on purpose and made it smoke.The tents that were also set up on purpose took place along the fence.\u201cWe will place scarecrows at the front of the camp.\u201d\u201cRight. They will be suspicious if there aren\u2019t any guards.\u201dAaron nodded.The soldiers used spears and weeds to make a scarecrow.And they also put armor over it.Although it was a scarecrow without doubt when you looked at it closely, it was enough to trick the Istel\u2019s soldiers that were far away.Aaron looked at the insides of the camp and took in a deep breath.\u201cWe will have to retreat.\u201d\u201cYes. From now on, speed is life.\u201dNow, the camp of Istel kingdom\u2019s disorder was controlled a little.If they were late, they would get their tails caught.Roan looked at Istel kingdom\u2019s camp fixedly.Because of Kalian\u2019s tear, he saw the camp as if it was right in front of him.\u2018They\u2019re already preparing to attack.\u2019The soldiers of Istel kingdom were maintaining their camp and moving around busily.\u2018There\u2019s no more time to waste.\u2019Roan set an eye sign to Aaron.Aaron nodded and climbed his horse.\u201cWe retreat as quietly as possible.\u201dThe hoof of the horses, that were covered with pieces of cloth, stepped on the ground without making any noise.The remaining cavalrymen left the camp in an instant.Three thousand fires and hundreds of scarecrows protected their empty camp.*****\u201cLet\u2019s repay the disgrace we suffered last time!\u201dCorps commander Baron Wett Landel of Istel kingdom raised his sword high and yelled.\u201cWaaaaa!\u201dThe soldiers of Istel brought up their morale even when they were tired.They knew how important morale was in a battle.\u201cCharge!\u201dWett yelled with all his strength and pulled the reins.He was quite excited.\u2018The commander has left his seat.\u2019He planned to grab this opportunity.\u2018Although Looter failed, I will succeed.\u2019If he won this battle, he would raise huge merits.If that was the case, he would receive half of the obtained territory as a reward for his merits.Wett mobilized a large scaled army and crossed the plains.He closely approached the Rinse kingdom\u2019s camp and yelled with strength.\u201cBastards! Cowards of Rinse kingdom! Don\u2019t stay hidden like that and fight!\u201dWhat he wanted was a confrontation in the plains.But even if Wett and the soldiers yelled, the camp was still quiet.Wett frowned.\u2018Something is wrong\u2026\u2026.\u2019Normally, when a side asked for a battle in between the two camps, the opponent had to reply to them.Because of that, Wett led 10,000 soldiers and left his camp.This was to be a battle between 10,000 soldiers.He was confident in achieving victory with just his capabilities.But the camp of Rinse kingdom was as quiet as a dead rat.An uneasy feeling was felt in their backs.Then, the closest person to him and the staff officer of the corps, Arr, approached him.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem weird?\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dWett frowned and asked back.Arr turned his head and pointed at Rinse kingdom\u2019s camp.\u201cEven the guards that were standing guard by the fences didn\u2019t show any movements.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dWett frowned and raised his right hand.\u201cArchers, to the front!\u201dAt those words, the archers came to the front and readied their bows.\u201cFire!\u201dAs soon as the order was sent, thousands of arrows split the sky.Sweeeeeeeeeee!A sharp sound rang out.Pubububuk!A rain of arrows poured over the camp of Rinse kingdom.Even the guards that were on the fences became porcupines.However they didn\u2019t yell or fall; they kept protecting their places.Then, Wett frowned and yelled.\u201cDamn! Even if it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s completely wrong!\u201dHe grabbed the reins and started to ride towards the camp.\u201cCo, corps commander!\u201dArr was surprised and followed his back.Soon, all the remaining soldiers started to charge towards the camp with hurried looks.Bang!The entrance that was seemingly closed, opened up.Wett, who went into a deep part of the camp, clicked his tongue with a hopeless look.\u201cHo! We were completely done in.\u201dThe camp was completely empty.The guards that were guarding the fences were scarecrows made from weeds and spears.On top of that, thousands of braziers were taking place at the back of the camp.Arr, who arrived late, discovered a piece of cloth between the braziers.\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019He grabbed the piece of cloth and then frowned.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dAs Wett asked, Arr brought him the piece of cloth without saying anything.There were letters written in it.\u201cThi\u2026..this! Fucking!\u201dThis was a major insult.They were thoroughly conned.Wett tore up the piece of cloth and ground his teeth.His sight moved to the west.\u201cI will certainly pay back this humiliation.\u201d*****The 7th corps that quickly left the Bink region, soon arrived in Nerf region.\u201cI can see the camp of our allies.\u2019Aaron pointed a huge camp that was placed at the side of a mountain.The placement of the camp showed that it didn\u2019t have any thoughts to attack.\u2018You gave up the whole eastern region starting from Nerf?\u2019Aaron clicked his tongue and shook his head.And Roan also did the same.\u2018The problem is that his ambition is great for someone that frightened.\u2019Because of that, there were many cases where Benjamin spoiled things at important moments.\u2018I can\u2019t just let him be like this.\u2019But he couldn\u2019t do anything right now.Roan was merely a vice troop commander of the army in the region.\u2018I have to grab an opportunity. For Rinse kingdom, no, at least for me I want to chase him away.\u2019And fortunately, Roan was confident in being able to do so.\u2018He\u2019s someone who makes a lot of mistakes.\u2019He was waiting for the opportunity to completely chase him away.While he was thinking about this and that, the front of the 7th corps entered the camp.\u201cIt\u2019s corps commander Aaron Tate of the 7th corps.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s words, the guards saluted and then opened the entrance.As he moved inside the camp, many scattered soldiers approached.\u201cYou achieved victory while facing the Istel kingdom?\u201d\u201cBased on the words that arrived yesterday, they say that the strategy was planned by the 7th corps.\u201d\u201cNowadays I hear a lot about the 7th corps.\u201dThey mumbled while looking at the soldiers of the 7th corps.It seemed like rumors were being spread by the soldiers of the other corps.\u201cUhm.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dThe soldiers of the 7th corps raised their chins up and widened their shoulders at the proud feeling.Then, a group of people showed themselves from a deep part of the camp.The group consisted of Benjamin, the staff officers, and the corps commanders.Aaron and Roan hurriedly got off the horse and bowed.\u201cOh! Corps commander Tate!\u201dBenjamin brightly smiled and faced Aaron.However, he was boiling inwardly.\u2018Damn. If I had known that Istel kingdom was that weak, I would have set up the camp in Bink region.\u2019He missed the opportunity to accumulate merits.Benjamin was angry at that and felt regret.\u201cI received the report from Phillip Hass. You\u2019ve truly achieved an excellent merit.\u201dAaron slightly moved his sight and looked at Phillip.Phillip bitterly smiled and shook his head.His expression was somewhat bad.Benjamin continued speaking.\u201cBut you made one mistake.\u201dHe clicked his tongue as if it was regrettable.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you push back Istel kingdom even further when you had already achieved victory?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Aaron was about to reply with a calm voice.Benjamin shook his hand.\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s regrettable. It was an opportunity to annihilate them. So I was saying\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the first place, he didn\u2019t even want to listen to Aaron\u2019s story.Benjamin continued saying with a chilly expression.\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll lead the soldiers myself and intercept the bastards.\u201dAaron didn\u2019t say anything.\u2018He\u2019s looking down on them.\u2019His heart scattered because they blocked the Istel kingdom\u2019s attack with just three or four corps, and also gave them a big blow.\u2018I now know the reason why Phillip Hass\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good.\u2019Probably some other commander would have been seduced Benjamin with sweet words.\u2018Stupid bastards.\u2019Istel kingdom wasn\u2019t that easy of an opponent.Benjamin grabbed Aaron\u2019s shoulders.\u201cYou should be tired because you raised big merits in this battle and even retreated while protecting the camp until the end.\u201dHis next words felt somewhat weird.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to exclude you from the next battle out of consideration for you.\u201d\u201cYes? But\u2026\u2026\u201dAaron frowned and raised his head.He could see Benjamin\u2019s face right in front of him.He had an expression that was smiling but was somewhat severe.Pressure and overpowering intent was felt from his eyes.\u201cBut what\u2026\u2026.?\u201dBenjamin repeated Aaron\u2019s last words.Aaron tightly bit his lower lip and bowed.\u201cThe 7th corps is to rest and then annihilate Istel kingdom when they get nearby.\u201dIn one sentence, he was leaving the main part for himself and giving him the leftovers.Aaron couldn\u2019t reply easily and ground his teeth.Benjamin looked at that and snorted.\u2018You\u2019ve already raised a big merit. I can\u2019t let you accumulate more merits that catch the eyes of others. On top of that Aaron, you bastard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019He wasn\u2019t even on his side.If he kneeled down and pledged allegiance to him, he was thinking of using him, but now this wasn\u2019t the case.He felt rotten when he saw that he was acting friendly with Reil.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be asking you.\u201dBenjamin didn\u2019t even listen to Aaron\u2019s answer, and disappeared to the insides of the camp.The staff officers and commanders followed his back.Phillip, who stayed still until the end, approached and grabbed Aaron\u2019s shoulders.\u201cCorps commander Tate. It\u2019s useless. Although I tried to express my opinion, as the mouthing of the others was too strong\u2026\u2026\u201dPhillip let out a long sigh.Aaron forcefully smiled and shook his head.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dThe two looked at each other and smiled bitterly.Phillip just nodded instead of replying, and then walked away.Aaron looked at him getting further away and let out a sigh once more time.\u201cWhew. How untrue.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that he was greedy in accumulating merits.However, it felt like he was everything taken away from what he had done.Then, Roan approached.\u201cRoan. It\u2019s useless. Everything was taken away by them.\u201dAaron couldn\u2019t even look into Roan\u2019s eyes properly.However, Roan\u2019s expression was quite composed.No, there was rather a faint smile in it.He whispered in Aaron\u2019s ear.\u201cNo. Rather, it turned out well.\u201dAaron opened his two eyes widely.Roan continued speaking.\u201cThe opportunity for us to end this war has come.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!

    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 70 - Danger inside the danger (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRoan knew the reason as to why this damned war was happening.The war between Istel kingdom and Rinse kingdom.As soon as this war had finished in his past life, Rinse kingdom analyzed and organized the information about the reasons this war started and the process with a fine-toothed comb.\u2018We were about to lose almost all of the eastern region, including the territory of Count Lancephil to Istel kingdom.\u2019In that process, some truths were revealed, and Roan remembered a few of them.One of them was the reason why this war started.\u2018The harvest had slowly started to decrease since last year.\u2019The Istel kingdom, whose land was mostly composed of plains, was one of the best agrarian countries.They exported their harvests and imported the products they lacked, and they made a living like that.The overwhelming amount of harvest productivity was the root and trunk of Istel kingdom.But last year, the harvests suddenly started to decrease with no apparent reason.\u2018Although they barely held on for a year\u2026..\u2019This year\u2019s harvest was even worse than the last year\u2019s.They didn\u2019t even have crops for commerce, and it was to the point it made you worried as to what the citizens had to eat.And the reason was of course, unknown.On top of that, Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom, who neighbored their borders, didn\u2019t show any signs of their harvests having decreased.As the situation turned out like this, the Istel kingdom had to make a decision.However, it was even difficult to ask for help from the neighboring kingdoms.\u2018In the end, they opted for war.\u2019They aimed for the eastern region of Rinse kingdom.It wasn\u2019t as large as the plains, but it was a mountainous region that had minerals and natural resources in it.They judged that if they conquered the eastern region, they\u2019d be able to put out the urgent fire of a situation they were facing.When he thought up to there, Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThe opportunity to finish this war has come?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRoan replied with a calm expression.Aaron gulped and nodded.\u201cGood. Let\u2019s hear the detailed plan in another place.\u201dHe moved away.And Roan followed behind his back with a composed expression.Soon at Aaron\u2019s order, the staff officers and the troop commanders of each region, started to gather ain the tent.\u201cRoan. What did you mean when you said that the opportunity to finish this war has come?\u201dThese were the words that Aaron said aloud.At these words, the troop commanders opened their eyes widely.\u201cThe opportunity to finish this war?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t even confront them directly, so what opportunity has come?\u201dStrange expressions were plastered on their faces.Roan looked at their faces once and then opened his mouth.\u201cFirst off, we have to know the reason as to why Istel kingdom is declaring war.\u201dHe explained the reduction of the harvest in Istel kingdom for a while.\u201cMmm. For that amazing farming kingdom to worry about what to eat\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cNow that I see it, the prices in the markets were overpriced. I thought that it was only temporary\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe staff officers and troop commanders showed various reactions.Aaron certainly touched his chin and shook his head.\u201cMhm. For a sudden decrease in harvest, how did that\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan didn\u2019t show any reaction.\u2018The reason is revealed after two years but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019There was no need to say that right now.Roan looked at their faces and continued talking.\u201cJust like I\u2019ve told you, the situation of their food isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s already to the point that they have barely prepared provisions for this war.\u201dAt those words everyone nodded.\u2018They would have gathered it up by even sweeping through the kitchens of the citizens.\u2019As they heard the situation, even that wasn\u2019t enough.\u2018That\u2019s why they attacked us like that without thinking twice.\u2019This explained the incomprehensible attacks of Istel kingdom.That reason was revealed just now.\u201cFollowing that, Istel kingdom doesn\u2019t have the ability to maintain war for a long time.\u201dRoan put more strength into his voice.\u201cAnd that\u2019s because before the war even started, we moved the citizens to the rear and cleared up the fields.\u201dAt those words, Gale hit his shoulders.\u201cRight! It\u2019s obvious for the food, but as we also moved over the livestock, ironware, and tools to the rear\u2026\u2026..\u201dMendel continued the last part.\u201cThe Istel bastards won\u2019t be able to acquire even an ounce of food.\u201d\u201cEven repairing tools or acquiring tools is impossible.\u201dSeveral troop commanders brightly smiled and nodded.And a smile also appeared on Roan\u2019s face.\u2018In my past life, we weren\u2019t prepared at all for the Istel kingdom\u2019s attack. Because of that\u2026\u2026.\u2019They almost had all of their eastern territory taken away in an instant.The Istel kingdom acquired supplies from the occupied territories and the war was prolonged.\u2018Before the elite troops of the central and southern regions came, we suffered consecutive defeats.\u2019But it was different in this life.The Istel kingdom already had their attack stopped once, and above that, because of the performance of the region\u2019s armies that were preparing just in case, their advance became slower.But even so, it was true that Rinse kingdom was getting pushed back bit by bit.\u2018Even so, the only things they can acquire from the occupied territories are weeds.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.Then the voice of Richard, who was leading the special troop, was heard.\u201cIf the supplies of the enemy aren\u2019t enough, do we have to make the front come to a deadlock and make it a long war?\u201dAt those words Roan shook his head.\u201cIf we were only facing Istel kingdom, that would\u2019ve been the right thing to do. But we have another enemy.\u201dAaron continued.\u201cByron kingdom.\u201dRoan nodded.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. Right now, Byron kingdom is following the eastern boundary to go to the south.\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces stiffened.\u201cIf it becomes a long war and Byron kingdom joins Istel kingdom, the problem becomes serious.\u201d\u201cIt would. Because the supply problem Istel kingdom has, the problem would be greatly diminished.\u201dOn top of that, the combining forces of the two kingdoms.It was a situation that they had to avoid.\u201cSo what do you want us to do?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the opportunity for us to end the war?\u201dThe troop commanders who were short tempered urged Roan on.Roan looked at their eyes fixedly and answered.\u201cTo end this war\u2026\u2026..\u201dHis eyes shone.\u201cWe have to cut off the supply line of the enemy and set the supply storage on fire.\u201dAt those words, the troop commander\u2019s showed various reactions.\u201cOh! That\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cIf we cut them off from their supplies, even they won\u2019t be able to continue this war.\u201dThe people became amazed and surprised.\u201cSetting the supply storage on fire and cutting off the supply line means that we have to get inside an army that amounts to more than 80,000. Will that be possible?\u201d\u201cOn top of that, won\u2019t Istel kingdom know that an amazing number of enemy troops are moving in their conquered territory?\u201d\u201cHow will we find the supply storage?\u201dTheir doubtful questions spewed out one after the other.Roan looked at the various reactions and faintly smiled.He took out a small piece of paper from his chest.\u201cI\u2019m utilizing the information agency to find the supply storage and the supply line of the enemy. Although it was fruitless until now, fortunately before we arrived to the headquarters of the eastern kingdom, I was able to receive a good report.\u201dRoan gave the paper to Aaron.Aaron quickly read the contents of the paper.\u201cYou found one of the supply lines of Istel kingdom!\u201dThe troop commanders opened their eyes widely while having dull expressions, and burst out with cantankerous laughter.\u201cYes?!\u201d\u201cIs that true!?\u201dThey moved next to Aaron and checked the contents of the paper.Aaron\u2019s words were true.Although the piece of paper was quite small, the location of Istel kingdom\u2019s supply line was written in it.\u201cRather than attacking the army that has more than 80,000 soldiers, we attack the supply line and the storage.\u201dRoan continued saying with strength.\u201cThis is the opportunity to finish this war.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dLow exclamations came out from everywhere.\u2018To have found the location of the enemy\u2019s supply line\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan faced Istel kingdom in the 7th corps without rest.On top of that, he blocked the surprise attack and in addition, gave them a big blow through the counter attack.Battles kept happening without control.And Roan had located the supply line and the supply storage while ordering the information agency even when all these other things were happening.The point everyone was amazed at was this last part.\u201cWhat are the probabilities of this information being true?\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s question, Roan replied with a confident expression.\u201cIt\u2019s very high.\u201dIt could only be.It was information that Chris\u2019s agency and the information agency had gathered, and there were also Roan\u2019s memories.He vaguely remembered the location of the supply storage.\u2018As it wasn\u2019t exact, I needed to double-check it.\u2019And the results were that he could find a small scaled supply line.\u2018If they keep searching with this supply line as the center, they\u2019d be able to find the supply storage facility.\u2019A storage appeared in his imagination.\u2018Then, we\u2019ll be able to end this war with our own hands.\u2019But he had something to do before that.\u201cIf you saw the report of the information agency, the supply line of Istel kingdom is in enemy territory. We have to charge through and ride straight to the rear of Istel kingdom.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dEveryone gulped down.Roan continued saying.\u201cA force consisting of 10,000 can\u2019t move in a territory conquered by an enemy.\u201d\u201cYou are saying to divide the army, right?\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s words, Roan nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We have a need to divide the army in the smallest unit.\u201dHis words quickened a bit.\u201cAside from making a small scaled troop to attack the supply lines, we have to patrol on enemy territory while annihilating their tributes and gather information about their supply line and storage.\u201dAt those words, everyone nodded.Aaron stood up after he organized his thoughts.\u201cGood. We will reorganize the army like Roan said.\u201dIt was a dangerous tactic.However, if they succeeded they could end this war.\u201cRose troop will take care of the first supply line the information agency found. The remaining troops will focus on patrolling enemy territory and grasping the location of the supply storage.\u201dAaron looked at the faces of the troop commanders.\u201cEach troop is to hurry and prepare to depart!\u201d\u201cSir!\u201dThe troop commanders saluted and then went out from the tent.Roan also followed Gale\u2019s back and was about to get out.\u201cRoan.\u201dAaron\u2019s voice was heard.Aaron grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cYou also did a big one this time.\u201dHe had a sincerely thankful expression.\u201cWhen this war ends, I will grant you a big reward.\u201dAt those words Roan slightly nodded.\u2018When this war ends\u2026..\u2019His head rolled busily.Autumn was already ending.When winter came and the next year also came, Roan had to walk a new path once again.\u2018That\u2019s why I returned to the eastern region.\u2019But of course, to do that, everything had to flow like he planned.Roan ground his teeth.\u2018For now, I will bring us to victory in this war.\u2019That was the most important thing right now.*****\u201cKek!\u201dOne soldier fell along with that sound.Stab.The spear that had pierced his body returned to place.\u201cWhew.\u201dThe owner of the spear let out a short sigh and checked his surroundings.Several hundred corpses were spread out in the gorge.\u2018This battle is also a complete victory.\u2019Calm eyes.Cool expression.The owner of the childish face was Roan.\u2018It\u2019s already the 13th battle.\u2019Rose troop roamed the eastern territory and battled against Istel kingdom.No, precisely speaking, they were attacking the big and small supply lines.And that had already happened 13 times.\u201cRoan.\u201dA familiar voice was heard.As he turned his head, he saw Aaron, Mendel, and Gale approaching him.\u201cThis battle was also a complete victory.\u201dHappiness could be seen in Aaron\u2019s face.Gale added.\u201cHahaha. Based on the rumors, it seems like Istel kingdom is seriously perplexed.\u201d\u201cThey can only be. The food that has to enter their throat is all next to us. Hahaha!\u201dMendel roared out in laughter.Roan\u2019s tactic was right.\u2018Reform the 10,000 soldiers into smaller troops and dig up the Istel kingdom\u2019s territory. And at the same time, find the supply line and supply storage location.\u2019Istel kingdom was really confused at the performance of the 7th corps.\u2018Because of that, each troop could acquire quite the amount of supplies.\u2019Although they couldn\u2019t find the supply storage yet, they were steadily cutting off the supply lines.With just that, Istel kingdom that was roaming the eastern territory, fell into a troublesome situation.\u201cHahaha! Thinking about the bastards that would be starving makes me feel refreshed.\u201dEveryone laughed while in a happy mood.But Roan was the only one that wasn\u2019t that cheery.\u2018It\u2019s certainly an amazing accomplishment. But we have to find the supply storage now.\u2019Only then will they be able to give them a proper blow.However, none of the troops of the 7th corps could find it.Aaron looked at Roan\u2019s expression and asked in a low voice.\u201cWhy is your expression that stiff? Is it because of the eastern army?\u201dThe army Benjamin was leading was currently suffering consecutive defeats.Because of that, the front line was getting pushed back to the Rinse kingdom\u2019s side.Roan shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen is it because of the storage supply?\u201dAt the repeated question, Roan couldn\u2019t reply.Aaron grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cRoan. There\u2019s no need to feel that urgent. With just this, it\u2019s still an amazing accomplishment. Their advancing speed is slowing down.\u201dAt those words, Mendel and Gale nodded.However, Roan\u2019s expression still couldn\u2019t be cheerful.\u2018If time flows anymore like this, then Istel kingdom will end up joining with Byron kingdom.\u2019He had to block them from joining forces at any cost.Then, a familiar faced man showed himself.\u2018Was he a soldier of the special troops?\u2019He was a young soldier that belonged to Richard\u2019s special troop.The young soldier approached with a bright expression.\u201cSir! Corps commander. It\u2019s a communication from troop commander Richard.\u201dHe took out a note from his chest.Aaron quickly read the contents.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation came out.At the same time, his mouth raised up.\u201cWhat does it say?\u201dMendel carefully asked.Aaron took in a breath for a moment and then said with a calm voice.\u201cThey have finally found it.\u201d\u201cYes? What does\u2026..\u201dGale asked back with a confused face.Aaron looked at Roan properly and brightly smiled.\u201cThey found the supply storage of the enemy.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Guys, I will change the sponsor queue back to 60 dollars, not to take off more money out of you but because the supply can\u2019t keep up with the supply.

    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 71 - Danger inside the danger (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySponsored chapterThe soldiers of the 7th corps were hiding behind a low mountain slope.Their numbers amounted to 4,000.They had moved in small troops until now, but half of them had gathered to attack the supply storage.\u201cThis is their supply storage, right?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s question, Richard nodded with a confident face.\u201cWhile we were patrolling, we discovered five wagons moving in the middle of the night. We followed them because it was a bit weird, and we ended up in this place.\u201dThe empty lot they were peering down at was surrounded by mountains.The empty lot was quite wide and flat, taking into account that it was located in the middle of the mountains.The lot, that had the shape of a gourd, only had one entrance.Only, they couldn\u2019t see the insides of the lot clearly because it was covered by trees.Wooden fences were surrounding the entrance, and a coarse watchtower was placed on the grounds.Right inside of it, there were huge tents and houses built.There were a lot of heavy sacks placed below the tents.When they vaguely guessed the number of wagons, adding the ones they couldn\u2019t see, it amounted to at least 1,000.\u2018There\u2019s some left over even after providing for two corps.\u2019A smile appeared on Aaron\u2019s mouth.Then, Richard pointed the pile of sacks.\u201cThose are the provisions of Istel kingdom.\u201dMendel, who was next to them, mumbled with a surprised expression.\u201cEven so, I didn\u2019t know at all that there was a place like this.\u201dAt those words, Roan, Aaron and Richard who were next to him, nodded.\u2018It\u2019s a place I hadn\u2019t expected at all. It\u2019s the best place to save provisions without getting caught. But\u2026\u2026..\u2019It certainly was one of the best places because of the many advantages it had.But storage facility only had one entrance, and the wide road that followed below the mountain was suitable for an army to cross on it.And there was one bigger problem.\u2018It\u2019s too far with the front line.\u2019Istel kingdom had advanced quite a ways into the west.\u2018Although it\u2019s to protect the provisions safely\u2026\u2026..\u2019There was nothing good in making the supply line longer.Roan glared at the entrance.At that instant, the entrance was zoomed in on.He was looking at the soldier that protected the entrance.Traces that wagons had come and go were seen.There were no weird things going on.\u2018Am I worrying too much?\u2019Then, Aaron\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWhat\u2019s the number of soldiers guarding the supply storage?\u201dRichard and Mendel looked at the entrance and replied.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the exact number as we can only see the entrance and the fences. But from what we can see, it seems like they are 500.\u201dAaron frowned.\u201c500\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d500 only at the entrance.When he also guessed from the size of the interior, there may be three or four times more soldiers.\u201cThey are at least 1500-2000.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s guess, everyone nodded.2000 enemy soldiers.On the other hand, Aaron\u2019s force was 4,000.\u201cYou\u2019ve done well, Richard.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s compliment, Richard brightly smiled and bowed.\u201cI was just lucky.\u201dHis humbleness was not too excessive.However, Richard\u2019s merit was quite big.Also, Istel kingdom had hid themselves because of the repeated blows they had suffered.They seriously lowered the amount of soldiers protecting the storage even after knowing that the advancing speed of the main troop would lessen.They used a method to quickly spread small provisions in the middle of the night.Thanks to that, the 7th corps was taking quite a lot of time to find the supply storage the more time passed.But Richard, of the special troops, had found the supply facility.It was a merit that was complementable enough.Aaron turned to look at the troop commanders and said in a low voice.\u201cWe hit at the fastest speed possible and fall back.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dIt was impossible to seize that amount of provisions, as it was the enemy\u2019s territory.Rather, it was more suitable to burn it all and retreat quickly.Aaron faced everyone and then stood up and shook his right hand.The flagman who was waiting, shook his flag.At the same time, the archers fired off arrows.Sweeeeee!Thousands of arrows split the air alongside a sharp sound.Pubububuk!A rain of arrows poured over the tents and the entrance.\u201cKek!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe soldiers who were guarding, became porcupines and fell down.The 7th corps fired two more rounds of arrows and then charged forward.\u201cTake over the supply storage!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201d4,000 soldiers poured out from the forest.They ran towards the confused soldiers.\u201cUo!\u201d\u201cKok!\u201dThe soldiers of Istel kingdom couldn\u2019t properly fight back and fell by becoming cold corpses on the ground.Puuuuu!The only thing they did was blow a horn trumpet to let their troops know of the infiltration of the enemy.The battle flowed quite one sidedly however.\u201cDon\u2019t let even one alive!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let them go!\u201dThe soldiers of the 7th corps charged through the entrance and were able to get into a deep part of the storage with a violent intent.However, they couldn\u2019t see any more enemies.Roan, who caught up late, frowned.\u2018The number of soldiers protecting it is too low.\u2019The number they had expected was 2,000.However, the only ones guarding it were the 500, the ones from the entrance.The situation in Istel kingdom wasn\u2019t good.To the point that it was difficult to stay in war for long.\u2018But they are maintaining the supply this sloppily?\u2019There was no way.\u2018Something\u2019s not right\u2026\u2026\u2019A feeling that uneasiness took over his heart.\u201cRoan, why is your expression like that? This battle is also a complete victory, a complete victory.\u201dAaron approached while brightly smiling.Then, one sack moved into Roan\u2019s sight.\u2018That!\u2019This was the reason of the uneasiness.He hurriedly tore up the sak.Riip.What fell outside of the sack were weeds covered in oil.Roan looked at Aaron and yelled.\u201cIt\u2019s a trap! We have to get out immedi\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he talked up to that moment.Something moved inside his sight.One arrow that split the blue sky.Roan concentrated on the tip of the arrow.Because of Kalian\u2019s tear, every movement in the world became slow.Sweeeeee!The arrow flewwhile cutting through the air really slowly.There was a flame at the tip of the arrow.Sweeeeeeeeeee!Below the first arrow, hundreds more could be seen.Roan\u2019s face stiffened.He yelled with all his strength.\u201cDodge!\u201dHis voice was heard slowly.The soldiers had confused expressions and looked at the surroundings at Roan\u2019s yell, and then kicked the ground.Roan also grabbed Aaron\u2019s neck and threw him.At the same time, the slow world\u2019s movement turned to the original speed.Pubububuk!Arrows poured over the heads of the 7th corps.The tents and the sacks got caught in the arrow rain and caught on fire.Whooooosh!An amazing heat flew out.The fire surged up to the sky and gulped down the sacks.\u201cUhh. What is this\u2026\u2026..\u201dAaron was thrown by Roan.He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence and shut his mouth.And it was the same for Roan.He looked at the path of fire burning fiercely and ground his teeth.\u2018For it to be a trap.\u2019It was the first time since he had returned to the past.He had achieved consecutive victories because he knew the future until now.Roan\u2019s eyes sunk calmly.\u2018For me to fall in a trap\u2026\u2026\u2019This was really, a really unexpected thing.*****\u201cHahaha!\u201dA magnanimous laughter rang out.The one who was looking at the scene while standing at the top was a big builded middle aged man with quite a pretty face.\u201cWe finally caught those rats.\u201dHe looked at the place where his sight reached.That was none other than the 2nd supply storage which the 7th corps of Istel had broken through.\u2018As the big and small supply lines got cut off, the front troops fell in chaos.\u2019It was a troublesome and angering situation for the one in charge of the provisions.He tried making a separate troop to annihilate the ones attacking the supply lines, but it was fruitless.\u2018The scale of the troop was really small, and on top of that, their movements were quite swift.\u2019But even so, they couldn\u2019t just stand still.In the end, the middle aged man decided to set up a trap.And there was even a suitable place.An empty ground they used as the saving point of supplies at the start of the war.It was a place they didn\u2019t use anymore because of the advancing speed of the main troop.They filled the sacks with weeds and oil.And then set up soldiers and purposely spilled the location of the fake storage.\u2018And they took the bait.\u2019The middle aged man was waiting at the cliff surrounding the storage and fired off arrows the moment the 7th corps broke in.The fake storage, that was filled with weed and oil, was caught up in an amazing fire.On top of that, they threw strong trees to block the entrance.\u2018Although it\u2019s regrettable that it isn\u2019t rocks\u2026\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t easy to find rocks big and strong enough to block the entrance.Instead, they blocked the entrance with trees and set it on fire.\u201cThe entrance has been blocked!\u201d\u201cDamn! Look for an escape route!\u201d\u201cPut out the fire!\u201dThe 7th corps yelled while looking at the spreading fire.\u201cHahaha! How good to see!\u201dThe middle aged man saw that and burst out of laughter.Then, a thick voice was heard.\u201cTroop commander Martin. Won\u2019t it be better to pour more arrows?\u201dHe had a huge body and a thick lined face.The left eye that was covered with a clean cloth.He was Vernon Pollet, who had lost his left eye because of Harrison\u2019s arrow while he was chasing Roan\u2019s back.The middle aged man, Teise Martin shook his head.\u201cEven if we don\u2019t do that, we are lacking goods. And that\u2019s the same for the arrows. They will die by getting caught in the fire, so there\u2019s no need to waste any more arrows.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dVernon smacked his lips and stepped down.\u2018You have to end it when you can.\u2019Actually, he didn\u2019t quite like Teise.If Vernon was a normal military officer, Teise was closer to being a civil officer.Because of that, he liked to use his head to win battles rather than using force.He was the polar opposite to Vernon, who liked to charge to the front without looking back.\u2018If only it wasn\u2019t for the wound\u2026\u2026.\u2019He wouldn\u2019t have fallen back to the rear like this.He remembered the greenhorn spearman that made his eye like this.\u2018I have to catch that bastard and kill him.\u2019Ududuk.The sound of teeth grinding was clearly heard.Then, a familiar guy was heard among the soldiers of Rinse kingdom.\u2018Mmm?\u2019Vernon frowned and inserted mana in his right eye.The guy who was leading the soldiers with a really calm attitude.\u201cThat guy?\u201dVernon opened his eyes widely.His face burned in an instant.\u201cKuhahahaa!\u201dThe laughter that explodes.\u201cWh, why are you suddenly like this?\u201dTeise shrinked down with a surprised expression.A sharp and chilly bloodthirst was felt in Vernon\u2019s eye.\u201cThe bastard that made me like this is over there.\u201d*****Chaos.The storage resembled a chaotic place.Whooooooosh!The flame gulped down the tents and the sacks.Below that, the soldiers of the 7th corps had become porcupines.The red fire gulped down the corpses.\u201cGet away!\u201d\u201cFall back!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t push!\u201dThe soldiers stepped back while dodging the fire.They were pushing their comrades in order to survive.\u201cU,uak!\u201d\u201cF,F,fire!\u201d\u201cSave me!\u201dThe soldiers that couldn\u2019t dodge, got caught up in the fire.\u201cUuk.\u201dThe disgusting smell of skin getting burnt spread out.The roasted skin slowly started to melt.The burnt corpses increased bit by bit.\u2018Damn. There\u2019s no escape.\u2019Roan ground his teeth.He searched his back and his sides but there was no escape.\u2018And we can\u2019t climb the hill.\u2019In the end, they had to get out through the entrance they came in.The problem.\u2018That place is blocked by trees.\u2019On top of that, there was an amazing fire.\u201cThe, there\u2019s no way\u2026\u2026.. For, for it to be a trap\u2026\u2026..\u201dRichard, who brought this information, was half absent minded.And Aaron also didn\u2019t have any solutions.\u201cDon\u2019t run about in confusion!\u201dHe calmed the soldiers and fell back to a place that still hadn\u2019t caught fire.\u201cUooo.\u201d\u201cKuhuk.\u201dCries filled with pain.It was the groan of the wounded that couldn\u2019t dodge the fire.\u201cIt\u2019s too hot! Too hot!\u201d\u201cI, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201dThe ones that received disgusting wounds had their hearts crumble.\u201cDamn! Move the wounded to the inner part!\u201d\u201cTake care of them so the wound doesn\u2019t worsen!\u201dThe troop commanders stepped out and commanded the soldiers.But they were also in a rush.\u2018Damn! To get caught in a trap!\u2019They had lowered their guard at the consecutive victories.Aaron looked at the huge fire and shook his head.\u2018Is this hell\u2026\u2026.\u2019It was even painful to breathe because of the hot heat.Aaron blamed his impatience.The supply storage of Istel kingdom.He had plentily expected the enemy to be prepared.And because of that, he led half of his force.However, as it was enemy territory, it was more suitable to attack quickly and retreat.\u2018I have to check it more carefully\u2026..\u2019Strength was put in his hand.Then, he saw Roan\u2019s back.He had a kind of pondering look.\u2018He\u2019s calm even in this situation.\u2019He thought that it was really Roan like.Then, Roan started to move.And surprisingly enough, the place he was moving to was the burning entrance.\u2018I can\u2019t keep hiding my strength in this situation.\u2019Roan took in a breath.The lives of the soldiers and his life was in danger.This wasn\u2019t the moment to be hiding his strength.\u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019He became determined.For him, and for his comrades.Roan moved towards the entrance.\u2018If I pull all of my mana, I might be able to crush the trees.\u2019You wouldn\u2019t know if it were other people, but if it was Roan, he had plenty of possibilities.For now, he used Brent\u2019s ring to not feel any heat.If it was for a short moment, it was possible to approach the fire.\u2018On top of that, the mana i\u2019m learning is Flamdor. It was the mana technique of the fire monarch Reid.\u2019He could say that fire was the source of his strength.Grip.Roan gripped his spear tightly.\u201cRoan!\u201d\u201cRoan! Where are you going!\u201dAaron , Gale, and etc. called out to Roan to stop him.Roan just turned his head to look at them.A smile was on his face.\u201cDon\u2019t be too surprised.\u201dThey were words you couldn\u2019t understand.Roan started to move again.An amazing path of fire surged up in his surroundings.\u2018Kuk. Even Brent\u2019s ring has a limit.\u2019It was weak, but he could feel the heat.\u2018If I waste more time, my skin will get burnt.\u2019Brent\u2019s ring only made you not to feel any heat, it didn\u2019t make the energy itself powerless.If he slipped up, he could get a wound when he wasn\u2019t paying attention.Then.Sweeee!A sharp sound was heard in his ears.Roan instinctively threw his body even before he saw it.Puk!An arrow was stuck in the place where he was standing.Roan looked at the place where the arrow was fired with a calm expression.Because of Kalian\u2019s tear, he could see the face of the man on the cliff clearly.\u2018He\u2019s the bastard that chased me back then.\u2019Vernon, who was on the cliff, was pointing his bow towards Roan.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I have no time to play with you.\u2019Roan was calm even while looking at the arrow pointing at him.\u201cHarrison!\u201dA loud yell.\u201cYes!\u201dHarrison, who was at the back of the soldiers, replied in a loud voice.Roan made a sign with his left hand and pointed to the hill.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dHarrison, who followed the cliff with his eyes, let out a low exclamation.Although he couldn\u2019t see it as clearly as Roan, he recognized Vernon at one glance.\u2018That bastard dares to!\u2019Harrison shut his mouth and grabbed his bow.He moved between the fire and knocked an arrow.Jiiiiiiiiiiiing.The bowstring became tense.\u2018Hoo. Hoo. Hup.\u2019His breath stopped.At the same time, he let go of the fingers that were pulling the string.Ting!A clear sound.Sweeeeee!A sharp sound rang out.One arrow pierced the fire and surged to the skies.Roan looked at that and moved with a composed expression.He didn\u2019t look at the arrow anymore.Because he trusted in Harrison\u2019s ability.\u2018Damn!\u2019Vernon, who was about to fire an arrow at Roan, fortunately didn\u2019t miss Harrison inside the fire. He hurriedly pulled Teise\u2019s arm and got on the floor.When Vernon lowered half of his body.Pat!One arrow grazed his armour.If he was a bit slower, he would have had his head pierced.\u2018Damn! He\u2019s the bastard that fired the arrow last time!\u2019His face reddened.They were the bastards that made him have only one eye.Those bastards were inside the fire.\u2018I have to kill them with my own hands.\u2019Vernon stepped back.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dTeise frowned.Vernon replied shortly after turning back.\u201cEven in this situation, I will have to receive indemnization for my eye.\u201dHe started to climb down the hill following the back road.Meanwhile, Roan stood in front of the trees.\u201cWhew.\u201dHe let out a long sigh and gripped his spear.The spear shined by receiving bright light.\u2018Hph.\u2019One thread of mana surged up from his mana hole.In that instant.Flaaaaaaaame!The fire that was burning the trees moved towards Roan.It was a situation that may eat him at any moment.\u201cRoan!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous!\u201dAaron and the soldiers, who were looking, yelled.However Roan was rather calm.No, he was actually a bit surprised.\u2018This\u2026\u2026\u2019His respiratory tract had heated up.And it was also the same for his internal organs.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019Vitality surged up.Every time he breathed, an amazing amount of fire essence was sucked into his body.The mana that was just a thread, that was like a raging billow, stirred in his body.An amazing amount of strength was sent to the tip of his hands and feet.\u2018I can do it.\u2019It was a strength he hadn\u2019t felt until now.He gained confidence from this.He looked at the pile of trees in front of him and lowered his stance.The spear was gripped with both of his hands.Mana spouted out through his two palms.Spat.The colour of Roan\u2019s mana was usually close to a transparent white light.But it was different now.This time, it had a red color.Although it was difficult to recognize as it was dim, a red color was certainly seen in the blade of the spear.Roan stepped up with his left leg and twisted both of his wrists.Pat!The spear split the air and crossed over the fire.\u2018Kuk!\u2019An amazing heat was felt.However Roan didn\u2019t stop.He executed the Flamdor mana technique and put strength into his spear.Finally, the spear landed on the tree.Baaaaaaang!An amazing explosion rang out everywhere.At the same time, the flames that were surging up to the skies, covered Roan.\u201cNo!!!\u201d\u201cRoan!!!\u201dA sound close to a scream came out.The screams of Aaron, Gale and the soldiers rang throughout the empty lot.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now!\u201dThese were the words he shouted out loudly for them to wake up.\u201cAh! Ri\u2026 right!\u201dOnly then did Aaron turn to look at the corps and yell.\u201cRetreat! Retreat! Everyone get out!\u201dThe soldiers got a hold of themselves late.\u201cRe, Retreat! Retreat!\u201dThey were still confused.They yelled retreat and started to run while taking care of the wounded.\u201cTh, thank you!\u201d\u201cTruly thank you!\u201dWhile getting out of the entrance, the soldiers bowed and showed gratitude.Roan faintly smiled and then looked at the cliff.He saw Teise\u2019s restless expression.He was also absent minded at Roan\u2019s performance.However he couldn\u2019t keep being like that forever.\u201cFi, fire arrows! Pour arrows over them!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the time to worry about the lacking goods.Archers appeared over the cliff.Sweeeeee!It was a sharp sound.Thousands of arrows split the wind.\u201cRose troop!\u201dRoan yelled with all his strength and sent a sign.The infantry receiving Roan\u2019s command that was at the rear, gathered together and raised up the wooden shields.Pubububuk!Arrow rain poured over them.Roan sent another sign.\u201cTake a shield formation!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t split apart!\u201dAt the orders of each troop commanders, they moved with each other and moved.They guarded the soldiers of the 7th corps with the shields that were over their head.\u2018They do strange training everyday.\u2019\u2018Their movement are well ordered.\u2019The infantry could become valiant soldiers in a short amount time because of Roan\u2019s training.However, it was impossible to protect all of the soldiers of the 7th corps.Pubububuk!\u201cUak!\u201d\u201cKok!\u201dThe soldiers became porcupines.\u2018Damn!\u2019Roan ground his teeth and moved.He twisted his wrist while holding his spear.Hoong. Hoong. Hoong.The spear quickly turned along with a heavy sound.At the same time, Roan operated the Flamdor mana technique.In an instant, the fire started to get sucked in the spear.Flaaaame!The red flame followed the spin of the spear and continued.Pubububuk!Some of the thousands of arrows got blocked in the path of fire and burned up.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dThe soldiers that had already gotten out of the entrance, became absent minded one more time at Roan\u2019s performance.The fire that spun alongside the spinning spear, as if it was covering it.This was just like looking at a god of fire, at a fire king.\u201cFire even more! More! Shoot everything you have!\u201dTeise turned crazy and yelled.Thanks to that, he was standing at the peak of the hill.Harrison walked to the front as if he was waiting for it.A hail of arrows shot out from the cliff.But even so, he didn\u2019t show any movements.\u2018Eat this!\u2019The moment he was about to let go of the bowstring.One arrow that was fired by the soldiers of Istel, grazed by Harrison\u2019s arm.\u201cKuk!\u201dA really small movement was made as a result.Tung!The bowstring was knocked at the same time.The arrow split the air and flew out.\u201cFire! Fire! Fire more\u2026\u2026\u201dTeise\u2019s madness couldn\u2019t continue.Puk!Harrison\u2019s arrow was stuck in his arm.\u201cUaaaak!\u201dTeise frowned at the sickening pain and threw a tantrum.\u201cTro, troop commander!\u201dThe surrounding soldiers approached with urgent expressions.The top of the hill became frenetic.Because of that, the rain of arrows halted for a moment.\u201cHarrison!\u201dAt Roan\u2019s yell, Harrison brightly smiled back and then stepped back.All the soldiers got out of the fake storage with him as the last ones.Boom. Boom.The tents and fences collapsed.And the trees inside the fake storage also couldn\u2019t endure it anymore.The fire gulped down everything.The lot without people resembled a fuel hole.\u201cRoan! Everyone got out!\u201dAaron\u2019s voice was heard outside the entrance.Roan swung his spear to shake off the fire and moved out of the empty ground.He felt a strong heat at his back.Meanwhile, the fire became even more fierce.If he was even a bit late, the entire 7th corps would have been eaten by the fire.\u2018But it\u2019s still too early to relax.\u2019Although they had gotten out, the situation still wasn\u2019t good.\u2018Soon, Istel kingdom will climb down the cliff.\u2019They would have a capable leader aside from Teise.\u2018We have to move as fast as possible.\u2019There was a place in the mountain slope he had seen with Kalian\u2019s tear.\u201cCorps commander! We have to move quickly towards the slope!\u201dAaron realized in an instant where Roan was talking about.Although he had made a mistake this time, he was a soldier that had experience in battles.\u201cI will take care of the back.\u201dAaron hesitated at those words for a moment and then nodded.\u201cPlease.\u201dIt was a short but hot word.Aaron ran to the front while passing by the soldiers.The soldiers received Aaron\u2019s command and quickly retreated.\u201cRose troop\u2019s infantry will take care of the rear!\u201dGale and Aaron had moved to the front together.Actually, Roan was the one leading rose troop.\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dThe soldiers of rose troop replied in a loud voice and stood shoulder by shoulder.The strong shields moved with each other without leaving a space.Pububuk!The arrows flowing from the hill were stuck over it.\u201cTake formations!\u201dAustin\u2019s voice was heard.The soldiers of rose troop protected the others and started to fall back little by little.Roan moved one step ahead of them and acted as a scout.Then.\u201cYou bastards!\u201dA voice rang out that was like thunder.A man with a big body and thick face appeared.A man that covered his left eye with a clean cloth was Vernon.He was in an excited state.\u201cBlock them!\u201dEven before Roan stepped to the front, Austin\u2019s order was sent.Over the shields, long spears surged up.A look that reminded you of a porcupine.\u201cHmph! Ridiculous things!\u201dVernon pulled up mana and charged the ground.The long sword split the air with a scary intent.Bang!The shields and the sword clashed and a sound exploded.The shield was split in half.\u201cKuoK!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe soldiers trembled as if they would collapse by the shock transmitted in their palms.The strong formation crumbled.\u201cMaintain! Maintain!\u201dAustin yelled with strength.Soldiers walked to the front to replace the crumbled place.\u2018Look at them.\u2019Vernon frowned at that quick movement.This kind of movement was only possible in the central army of Istel kingdom.\u2018Even so, they are merely normal soldiers!\u2019He swung his sword once again.At that moment, tens of spears split the air and stabbed in.An attack without flaws from head to toe.But even so, Vernon didn\u2019t get perplexed.He turned his sword and knocked away the spears.Cheng! Chechecheng!Sparks appeared along the sound of metal.\u201cKuk!\u201dThe soldiers lost balance again at the spear that were knocked back too easily.Their palms felt numb.Because of the spears that were knocked to the side, the strong shield formation crumbled.And this time also, Vernon didn\u2019t miss the opportunity.\u201cDie!\u201dHe swung his blade after getting inside the formation.Terrible explosive sounds were heard continuously.The soldiers tried to rise their spears by standing shoulder to shoulder, but it was useless.Vernon resembled a savage beast.\u201cDie! Die! You son of a bitches! I\u2019m from Istel\u2019s kin\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe yell got cut off.It was because of the spear that came in attacking his head.\u201cHph!\u201dIt was completely different to the attacks of a normal soldier.The speed behind the spear, the strength, and the angle; it was all different.Everything was strong, quick and concise.Vernon hurriedly shook his head and charged the ground.However, the spear continued following him just like the head of a snake.\u2018Damn!\u2019Vernon ground his teeth and swung his sword.The spear got knocked aside along with the sound of metal clashing.Because he swung his sword in an unstable stance, the joints in his shoulders and elbow became numb.\u2018Just what bastard dares to!\u2019Vernon glared at the owner of the spear that bothered him.At that instant, the remaining right eye became big.\u201cThis bastard. I finally met you.\u201dHis eye boiled with rage.Vernon was glaring at the owner of the spear, Roan. .Roan, who was patrolling at the front, returned at Vernon\u2019s appearance.\u2018Normal soldiers can\u2019t face a knight utilizing mana.\u2019If he just let him be, his losses would become too severe.Roan sent a sign towards Austin.\u2018Retreat.\u2019Austin, who was making the shield formation again, understood the order and sent the same sign towards the soldiers.The disarmed shields moved together once again.Step. Step.It was a well ordered retreat.But Vernon didn\u2019t think of following them back.His objective was Roan anyways.Vernon smiled fishily and showed his yellow teeth.\u201cI will chew up your flesh piece by peice you bas\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYour tongue is long.\u201dRoan cut his words and attacked him.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!Attack and defense followed and the sound of metal was heard.Sparks appeared.\u201cIt seems like you picked up the mana technique somewhere, but the level is really poor!\u201dVernon teased and pulled up mana.\u2018Kugh.\u2019In that instant, the strength behind the sword changed.Just like he had said, compared to Vernon\u2019s mana, the level of Roan\u2019s mana was still lacking.It clearly showed that the time he had trained was short when he battled a knight 1vs1.\u2018If I just had that great strength from back then\u2026..\u2019No, if he just had fire in his surroundings, the situation could have been better.Pabat! Pat! Cheng! Checheng!Vernon\u2019s sword split the air and pushed Roan into a corner.Shallow wounds of the sword appeared as he got cut on his wrist or thighs.\u2018Kugh.\u2019Roan executed his spearmanship and real battle techniques, but the level of mana proficiency was too different.Every time he blocked an attack, he felt a pain that would rip his palms apart.\u201cNow, give me your eyes!\u201dVernon pulled more mana and swung his blade.Roan, stepped in closer and raised his spear up high.Cheng!His spear and the sword clashed.\u2018Kugh.\u2019An amazing strength was felt in his palm.Gkkkk.The sword was digging into the spear.\u2018I\u2019m dying like this.\u2019Right before his body and his spear was about to get split in half.Brent\u2019s ring moved into his sight.\u2018Ah!\u2019Roan had forgotten it as he only concentrated on the spear, using only Reid\u2019s battle techniques and the Flamdor mana technique, but there were many spells in Brent\u2019s ring.\u2018I just have one opportunity.\u2019Roan inserted mana into his ring.Light shone from his ring.\u201cDie!\u201dVernon, fortunately didn\u2019t seem to realize it, and was still pressing down with his sword.Roan looked at Vernon\u2019s eyes fixedly.At the same time, his mouth lightly moved.\u201cLight.\u201dAt that moment.Paat!A marble of light appeared in front of Vernon\u2019s right eye.It was a small but very bright marble of light.\u201cKugh!\u201dVernon unconsciously shut his right eye and shook his head.He lost his balance in an instant.Roan twisted his body as if he was waiting for it, and after he knocked the sword away he swung his spear.Pushuk!The spear stabbed deeply into Vernon\u2019s side.\u201cKuk!\u201dVernon staggered while still having his eyes closed.Roan pulled out the spear and then twisted his wrist.The spear split the air and flew towards Vernon\u2019s neck.\u201cI will pay your eye later on.\u201dA cold voice came out.At the same time, the sharp spear cut off Vernon\u2019s neck.At that moment, an amazing amount of blood flowed out.Slash. Tuk.The head rolled on the floor.He still had his right eye closed.The body that had lost it\u2019s head staggered for a moment and then fell over.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh and roughly cleaned off the blood on his face and body.\u2018My mana is all spent.\u2019Even so, it was the mana that was almost dry.The moment he executed a skill with Brent\u2019s ring, it ended up finishing up.\u2018The efficiency is too bad.\u2019It wasn\u2019t an item he could use as he wished until after the level of his mana rose to some degree.Roan shook his head and checked his surroundings.The front of the 7th corps entered midway into the slope.\u201cRetreat! We are passing through the forest on the right!\u201dAaron certainly had good eyes in grasping the situation of the battle.He also thought of retreating into the forest instead of the mountains, just like Roan.The soldiers of the 7th corps moved into the forest one by one.And the infantry that was in charge of the rear also arrived at the destination.Roan hurriedly chased their back.\u2018It\u2019s time for the enemy to climb down.\u2019His steps became quicker.Then.Puuuuuuu!The sound of the horn trumpet was spread through the forest.At the same time, dust clouds arose below the cliff.He couldn\u2019t see Teise, but the commanders that were at least adjutants were leading the soldiers.Roan yelled towards Austin.\u201cRetreat! Get inside the forest!\u201dAustin realized that returning back was strange, and he quickly made the soldiers of rose troop enter the forest.\u2018If their force is only that small, we can easily block them in the forest.\u2019It obviously wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u2018The losses will be enormous.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.he roamed the battlefield for 20 long years.He knew how gruesome and miserable it was taking care of the rearguard.\u2018It seems like today will be really long.\u2019The day of bloody color had just started.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Pant. Pant.\u201dThe soldiers were clearly exhausted.Their armor was covered in blood.The soldiers that amounted to 4,000 were now 2,000.Already, half of the soldiers have left the world.\u201cA little bit more.\u201dAaron encouraged the soldiers.He also was in a situation where he could also collapse at any moment, but he ground his teeth and endured.He moved faster than anyone and at everyone\u2019s front.Step. Step.When the back of his foot swept the ground, white dust rose up.When he moved three or four more steps.Puuuuuu.The sound of a horn trumpet was heard.It was the sound they had heard the past few days that made them feel the creeps.The faces of Aaron and the soldiers turned pale.\u201cIs it the end\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, a half giving up sound was also heard from Aaron\u2019s mouth.Roan, who was leading the infantry of rose troop at the back, stood to the front.\u201cWe will stop them.\u201dHe spoke in a daring and composed voice.Roan also had an exhausted look but his situation was better than the other commanders.And that was also the same for the infantry of rose troop.They, who had trained with the latest training methods of 20 years from now on, had more stamina than the other soldiers.On top of that, because of the repeated troop strategy training, the waste of their energy was low.Roan stood at the front and gripped his spear.\u2018There\u2019s not much until we leave the territory.\u2019If they won this skirmish, they\u2019d be able to get into friendly territory.\u2018Let\u2019s endure it one more time.\u2019Roan bit his lower lip.His sight moved over the hill.Puuuu.The sound of horn trumpet rang in his ear.Dudududu.Followed by that, horse clops were heard.Flock!At the same time, a sharp flag appeared over the hill.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that moment, a low exclamation came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.The magnificent troop flag waved in the wind, which the cavalrymen at the front were holding.That flag was familiar for his eyes.Roan turned to look at Aaron and yelled.\u201cThey aren\u2019t of the Istel kingdom. They\u2019re friendlies!\u201dIn that instant, the faces of Aaron and the soldiers turned to become that of relief and surprise.Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIt\u2019s Count Lancephil!\u201d*****It was fate that he met Lancephil\u2019s army.The army was patrolling the eastern region and annihilating Istel kingdom\u2019s army.Meanwhile, they had met with the 7th corps.\u201cBaron Tate. You\u2019ve done well.\u201d\u201cNo, Count Lancephil. We could keep our lives because of you.\u201dAaron bowed.Io looked at that and smiled.\u2018I thought that the movements of the enemy had become more hesitant, but it was that the 7th corps were attacking the supply lines.\u2019They were rendering such great merits they couldn\u2019t even think of.Io was astounded.His sight naturally moved over to the one next to him.\u2018Roan.\u2019Roan was standing next to Aaron.A vice troop commander was next to him instead of the other troop commanders.And that was because of Aaron\u2019s consideration and Io\u2019s petition.Following Aaron\u2019s report, most of the merits they have rendered was because of Roan.\u2018Even at this retreat, they were in charge of the rear and rendered a distinguished merit.\u2019It was a merit that became more surprising the more you heard of it.Only that not him, nor anyone of Lancephil\u2019s territory knew that he was learning mana.And that was because of Aaron\u2019s consideration.He thought that it may somehow affect Roan and sent the order of never revealing it outside before Roan revealed it himself.And the soldiers of the 7th corps, who could keep their lives because of Roan, kept that promise thoroughly.\u201cFor now, rest for a couple days.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAt Io\u2019s words, Aaron bowed once again.And Roan also did the same.Below their heads, a sigh of relief flowed out.Although they had lost half of their forces, thinking about it differently, they had rescued half of their forces.\u2018Although we suffered a big blow because we fell into their trap\u2026\u2026..\u2019They couldn\u2019t stop like this.\u2018In war, it\u2019s normal for there to be mistakes and defeat.\u2019One couldn\u2019t always win a perfect victory.\u2018It\u2019s enough if you learn from the mistakes and defeats.\u2019Looking at it from another point of view, there was also a part where he unconsciously became careless just because he returned to the past.\u2018In the past, in the present, and in the future, war is still war.\u2019It was normal that lives were lost.He always had to think and act prudently.It was the first time Roan experienced a bad thing since he returned to the past.\u2018In the first place, I\u2019m not a strategist.\u2019In his past life he was merely a spearmen squad commander.\u2019Roan clenched his fists.\u2018Istel bastards. Although you would be laughing right now\u2026\u2026\u2019Fire appeared in his eyes.\u2018I will make you shed tears of blood next time.\u2019He returned as much as he received.No, he would certainly return it with interest.That was the rule of a war.After Io left his tent, he went to the camp of the 7th corps that was located at the rear.After he crossed over two entrances and was about to enter the camp.Aaron, who was walking in front of him, abruptly stopped.\u201cMmm.\u201dA low exclamation flowed out of him.Roan stayed close and looked in front.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019He barely gulped down the exclamation that was about to come out.He looked at the ground in front of him.Troop commander Richard of the special troops and his soldiers were over there.They had tied their bodies with a tight rope and were kneeling.It was the look of sinners.They discovered Aaron and then bowed towards the ground.Aaron moved and stood in front of Richard.Soldiers of other troops gathered over to the surroundings.\u201cRichard. What are you doing?\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s words, Richard replied while not being able to raise his head.\u201cBecause of me, more than 2,000 soldiers had died.\u201dHe replied in a serious voice.His shoulders trembled.\u201cCut off my head. Only, save my underlings as they solely acted at my orders.\u201d\u201cRichard\u2026\u2026.\u201dAaron bit his lower lip.If there was a merit reward, there would also be a punishment for when you made a mistake.Especially in this case, you had to punish Richard who had the most responsibility in a public showing.\u201cWhew.\u201dA long sigh flowed from Aaron\u2019s mouth.Then Roan, who was looking at the situation from the back, kneeled down between Aaron and Richard.\u201cThe one that proposed to attack the enemy\u2019s supply line and storage in their territory was me. The cause of all this was me. Rather, punish me and save troop commander Richard\u2019s life.\u201dThey had lost more than 2,000 lives.In this situation, they couldn\u2019t kill the best troop in the 7th corps.On top of that, although Richard had made a mistake in this battle, the merits he had accumulated couldn\u2019t be seen lightly.If you slew a commander for only one mistake, who would stand at the front and face the enemies?Roan bowed towards the ground.Then, a loud voice was heard.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s also difficult for me not to receive the punishment.\u201dThe owner of the voice was Gale.He passed over the soldiers and kneeled down next to Roan.\u201cIt\u2019s also a big sin not having taken care of troop commander well.\u201dKennis and the adjutants of rose troop, followed his back.\u201cWe will also receive the punishment.\u201dThe soldiers of rose troop that were looking, kneeled down next to the special troop\u2019s soldiers.\u201cWe will also receive it.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t fare that much better.\u201dThese were the 2,000 soldiers that had survived.They struggled desperately and became more persistent and firm.Soon, all the adjutants and soldiers kneeled down.The only person standing in the camp was Aaron.He looked at the soldiers of the 7th corps and slowly kneeled down.\u201cI also became careless and made a mistake, so I must also receive a punishment.\u201dAaron bowed.At that look, Richard and the troop commanders yelled in one voice.\u201cCorps commander!\u201dA strong heat flowed out from them.Aaron raised his head once again and looked at everyone.\u201cWe all made a big mistake. And because of that, many of our allies have died.\u201dThere was a strong resonance in his voice.\u201cWe will fight by carrying the names of the friends that left first.\u201dHe stood up and unsheathed his sword.A sharp sound hit their ears.Slash!Aaron sliced the tight rope that was tying Richard.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the place for us to die.\u201dHe raised up the soldiers and yelled.\u201cWe are dying on the battlefield! Raise some merits and be exempt from the punishment!\u201dHis voice became louder.\u201cLet\u2019s tribute the heads of the enemies to the ones that left ahead of us!\u201dRoan and the other soldiers stood up.Chuk!They saluted.\u201cSir!\u201dThey lost half of their force.But they wouldn\u2019t forget.They would carry the names of their comrades and fight.It\u2019s not like they would be fighting alone.The 7th corps was reborn.No, it evolved.******Rarely enough, there was a shaman in the camp of Count Lancephil.The injured ones of the 7th corps could receive treatment from the shaman because of Io\u2019s consideration.The other troops of the 7th corps heard the news that they fell into the ambush of the fake storage and started to regroup one by one.Because of that, the number increased to 6,000 again, and the morale became so high it was about to sunder the sky.Aaron controlled the troops that were annihilated or suffered losses and reorganized them.As this was the middle of a war, they put the formal promotions for later on, but Roan was named as troop commander.They made a 2nd rose troop by gathering the infantry that originally received strategy training and some cavalrymen of other troops.As Gale recently became Aaron\u2019s staff officer, his role was transferred to Roan.\u201cWhen the war ends, I will formally give you a troop.\u201dAfter that, some more good news was heard.And one of them was that the capital of Miller dispatched the elite troops that amounted more than 50,000 to face the Byron kingdom.On top of that, as they had joined hands with the Dies kingdom, the 40,000 soldiers that were in the south were moving towards the east to help them.Because Roan knew the future, the army of the central and southern region could depart before they got their eastern region taken.The situation was becoming better as time passed.Aaron and the commanders of the 7th corps didn\u2019t pass the day negligently.They gathered in the tent of the corps commander everyday and reviewed the battle of the fake storage.Richard, the troop commanders that got attacked, and the ones that weren\u2019t with them were carefully reviewing to see what went wrong that time.\u201cNow that I see it, the movement of the wagons were certainly strange.\u201d\u201cOn top of that, even if we were in a hurry, we had to first grasp the number of the soldiers in the storage.\u201d\u201cRather than going inside, it would have been better to fire arrows and set it on fire.\u201dSeveral opinions came and went.Now the troop commander, no, Roan was being treated as the most senior among troop commanders because of the merits he had accumulated until now, organized the contents and was filling in the lacking points.\u2018I can\u2019t make the same mistake.\u2019Roan\u2019s strongest point and virtue was his endless effort.He recognized the points he lacked in and knew how to fill them.Then, the doors opened up and one soldier showed up.\u201cCorps commander. Count Lancephil is looking for you. He says that troop commander also has to assist.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAaron wasn\u2019t perplexed at the sudden meeting.\u2018Even so, I wanted to go and find him once\u2026\u2026..\u2019He had rested plentily.And had reviewed his mistakes enough.Now was the time to move.Aaron and Roan went to Io\u2019s tent.Excluding Io, you could see Kali Owells, the leader of the mages Tairon Bess, Perry Wison who was the leader of the territory\u2019s army, and other important people.Their expressions were kind of flushed.\u201cCorps commander Tate. Come sit over here.\u201dIo brightly smiled and sat in the empty seat.He also had a flustered face.Aaron slightly tilted his head.On the other side, Roan\u2019s interest was in a weird place.He looked at the youth standing alone at the other side of the table.The youth that seemed to have three or four years over than him seemed quite familiar.\u2018Who was he?\u2019He had a tickling feeling that he was on the tip of his tongue.Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThe name of that youth is Oren. He\u2019s someone sent from the Phillip\u2019s family.\u201dAt that moment, Roan opened his eyes roundly.\u2018Oren Part\u2026\u2026\u2019His tickling feeling was refreshed. .The moment he heard the name, he could remember.\u2018The vice director of the agency.\u2019One of the existences that helped Chris lead the agency was Oren.If Chris was Ian\u2019s right hand, then Oren was Chris\u2019s right hand.Oren bowed deeply and said in a composed voice.\u201cHello. I\u2019m called Oren and i\u2019m serving Sir Ian Phillips. I\u2019m the one responsible for the information agency Sir Phillip\u2019s has established in his plans.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Ian Phillips, he\u2019s an existence shaking the kingdom nowadays.\u201dIo nodded with a gratified expression.Oren continued speaking.\u201cI received Sir Phillip\u2019s order and focused on grasping the movements of Istel kingdom in the eastern region through the agents. And we finally succeeded in obtaining the information you wanted.\u201dIo continued saying.He looked at Aaron and Roan and said.\u201cThey have found the location of the supply storage of Istel kingdom.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAaron let out a low exclamation.And that was the same for Roan.But the meaning of the impression was different.Different from Aaron, who was surprised at the fact that they had found the supply storage, Roan was more impressed at the truth that Ian Phillips made an information agency and operated it more quickly than what he had thought.\u2018On top of that, to have already have found Oren\u2026\u2026..\u2019In his past life Chris discovered Oren while he was gathering information and chose him as his right hand man.It was a famous thing that in that process, Chris found Oren more than 10 times enough to have convinced him.That was the start of the agency.\u2018How did Ian meet Oren and find him? Would he have convinced him more than ten times like Chris?\u2019He had many questions.No, he was amazed one more time at Ian\u2019s abilities ahead of his questions.\u2018To use the information agency running in the capital of Miller and find more information in the territory and faster than us\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019A genius was a genius.But of course, he would have to check if that information was true or not.Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cOriginally, it seems like he went to the eastern army first, but it seems like commander Doyle wasn\u2019t that interested.\u201dHe just said that he wasn\u2019t interested, but it actually meant that he was ignorant.If it wasn\u2019t for the name of Count Phillips, he wouldn\u2019t even have been able to meet him.As Io gave the signal, Oren took out two pieces of paper from his chest and gave it to Aaron and Roan.Quite a well drawn could be seen with a some information.\u201cIn the case of the 7th corps, as they went through the fake storage, I wondered if you would act together with us.\u201d\u201cHhm.\u201dAt those words, the head of the knights, Kali Owells, showed a blatantly displeased look.And Io also knew that, but he just feigned ignorance.He couldn\u2019t refute his retainer in a place like this.\u201cWill we be able to do so?\u201dAaron asked.Io faintly smiled and shook his head.\u201cIn the first place, it was the 7th corps that had attacked the supply lines and was cutting it off. If we see it in another way, it\u2019s just like snatching away the merits of the 7th corps.\u201dAt those words, Aaron looked at Roan.Roan was still checking the contents on the paper.\u2018It\u2019s information that\u2019s organized really well.\u2019He thought that it certainly was Ian.\u2018However, this could also be another trap of the enemy.\u2019He felt Aaron\u2019s gaze late and slightly shook his head.Aaron realized Roan\u2019s meaning in an instant.They had clearly grasped their mistakes while reviewing the attack that they had suffered last time in the fake storage.Whether this information was true or not, they couldn\u2019t just bite it.\u201cFor now, we will have to investigate thoroughly if this information is true or not.\u201d\u201cRight. As there\u2019s also what happened last time\u2026\u2026..\u201dIo nodded.He looked at Aaron\u2019s eyes fixedly and said.\u201cWill the 7th corps take care of that?\u201dAt those words Aaron wasn\u2019t modest anymore.\u201cIf you give us the opportunity, we would like to.\u201dThe decision was set.He grabbed the opportunity to take revenge on the Istel bastards.He wanted the 7th corps to start that.Io brightly smiled and nodded.\u201cGood. I\u2019ll believe in you and entrust it to you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAaron replied shortly afterwards and stood up.Although he felt Kali\u2019s hot gaze, he forcefully ignored it.\u201cThen. We will leave.\u201dAaron and Roan bowed towards Io and then got out of the tent.The moment they did, that stuffy feeling cleared up in a moment.The steps returning to their camp was light.\u201cFor now, we\u2019ll have to gather the troop commanders.\u201dAt Aaron\u2019s words, Roan nodded.\u201cI will send the gathering order.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be troubling you.\u201dAaron hit Roan\u2019s back once and then returned to his own tent.Roan moved inside the camp to gather the troop commanders.Then, a familiar faced man approached quickly.\u2018Pens?\u2019He was the one responsible for the information troop Roan created and was a staff member of Chris\u2019s agency.He ran with a really excited expression.\u201cYou seem really bright.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Pens nodded and took out a piece of paper in his chest.\u201cWe finally found the location of the storage supply.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.He received the paper Pens was giving him.\u2018Chris\u2019s agency doesn\u2019t fall back at all.\u2019He had a proud and satisfied feeling.A smile appeared on his mouth.But the moment he checked the contents of the paper, his smile completely disappeared.He had a stiff face.Perplexed eyes.Roan took in a deep breath and ground his teeth.\u2018The location is different.\u2019EndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are more than 300 active members. It\u2019s a tolerably small squad.\u201dHis eyes moved to Pens.\u201cWe started gathering and analyzing information in the eastern region the moment war started. There are high possibilities for the storage we found, to be the real one.\u201dPens didn\u2019t show any reaction.\u2018We gathered and analyzed information even before war started.\u2019He wanted to say that but he couldn\u2019t.It was better to hide Chris\u2019s agency the more they could and not expose it, while thinking of the future.But Aaron wasn\u2019t planning to just endure it and let it pass.\u201cIt seems like this young friend is ignoring our information squad.\u201dHe continued saying with quite a displeased voice and expression.\u201cJust looking at the staff number, our side certainly has less. However, he had already found several supply lines of Istel kingdom. On top of that, we grasped their surprise attack beforehand and annihilated them by counterattacking. It\u2019s a squad that already has its history.\u201dAt those words, Oren shut his mouth.Even if he was receiving the support of the Phillip\u2019s family, he was still a commoner.He couldn\u2019t say anything back at Aaron yet.Only, there was a displeasing look in his eyes and pride about his organization mixed in it.Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cAnyways, we are in a situation that we have to check the two places.\u201dAt those words everyone nodded.Roan looked at Oren and continued saying.\u201cWe decided to check if the information you brought us was true or not, so how about you go check if our information is real or not?\u201d\u201cWe?\u201dOren had a confused expression at the unexpected proposal.Io, who was listening, hit his knees.\u201cThat would be good.\u201dIf the concerned parties checked it themselves, they would be convinced more easily.Aaron and Oren, who pondered for a moment, nodded at the same time.\u201cCertainly, if we check it with our own eyes, there wouldn\u2019t be useless trouble.\u201dThere wouldn\u2019t be saying such as stealing away the merits, or upturning the truth.They had to block fighting between themselves in front of a big battle.\u201cThen. Go and check the truth with your own eyes.\u201dThese were Io\u2019s order.Aaron, Roan, Oren and Pens bowed at the same time.\u201cYes. We understand.\u201dIt was a short reply, but with strength.The four people were composed and confident, just like one person.Roan left Io\u2019s tent and grabbed Pens\u2019 shoulders.\u201cMister Pens.\u201dPens slightly turned his head and looked at Roan.Roan looked at Pens\u2019 eyes fixedly and continued saying.\u201cI believe in the information you, Chris\u2019s agency, and the information squad has brought me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dPens let out a low exclamation.Roan looked at him and smiled faintly.\u201cLet\u2019s show everyone which information agency is the real one and the best.\u201dHe was confident.But it wasn\u2019t because he remembered things related to the storage.When he first came running to him bringing the paper with the location written in it.The expression from back then.\u2018An expression filled with confidence.\u2019Pens was overly careful and meticulous.Because of that, his words and actions were heavy, and the expression of his face was consistent.But that him was smiling brightly.\u2018If I don\u2019t believe in my people, who will?\u2019Roan trusted Pens.The Pens that smiled more brightly than anyone.*****The next day, the small scaled squad left Lancephil\u2019s territory.As they had the role of just checking the location of the storage, the number of the soldiers was quite low.As they picked the nimblest soldiers and the ones with the best stamina among the 12 squads, that number amounted only to 40.And the one leading them was none other than Roan.He was sent off by Aaron and moved towards Istel kingdom.Roan divided the 40 people again in groups of 5 and only moved when the sun had set or at dawn.The reason he split the already small squad.It wasn\u2019t only to dodge the eyes of the enemy.\u2018If the location of the storage is true, we have to secure a road to approach them secretly while evading their eyes.Roan wasn\u2019t thinking of only checking the location and returning.He was thinking beyond that.Because of that, the movement speed was really slow.However, Roan didn\u2019t rush and that was the same for the soldiers.They obeyed Roan\u2019s orders.And after nine days passed like that, they could arrive at the storage located in a deep place in the enemy territory.It was a storage located between mountains.\u2018They are located in a normal location.\u2019It wasn\u2019t that far from the front lines and was a comfortable location to come and go.On top of that, the main road was well extended from east to west.It was the optimal place to store their supplies.On top of that, different from the last time, there were quite a lot of guards in it.It had an amazing number of tents, sacks, and soldiers.\u2018Is this the real location?\u2019Roan sent the soldiers to the sides of the hill for now and ordered them to check the storage thoroughly.At the same time, he climbed to the peak of the mountain.\u2018Fortunately, there\u2019s nothing covering my sight.\u2019As he climbed to the peak of the mountain, he could see the entire storage in his eyes.If you were a normal person, you\u2019d only be able to see its shape.But Roan was different.He had Kalian\u2019s tear with him.\u2018It\u2019s quite a solid camp.\u2019Roan concentrated his sight on several places of the storage.And every time he did so, the place he looked at seemed as big as if it was in front of him.Quite some time passed by.But he didn\u2019t discover anything wrong.\u2018The abilities of the organization are quite gre\u2026\u2026.\u2019When he thought up to that point, one scene caught his eye.A middle aged soldier, who was circling the surroundings as if he was patrolling, approached a young soldier.At first glance, it was a really natural scene.However, the problem was the thing the young soldier was holding.\u2018Report?\u2019It was a pile of documents made with mixed old paper and rough leather.It obviously was a report.Although he couldn\u2019t see the exact contents, what was filling the side were letters.\u2018A normal soldier can read?\u2019When Roan revealed that he knew how to read and write, Aaron, Gale, Mendel, etc. were really surprised.That\u2019s how much strange it was for a normal soldier, and a normal soldier at that, that had to battle while putting their life on the line, to know how to read.The middle aged man swept through the papers for a moment and then, made a handsign towards the soldiers.The guys that were circling the surroundings started to gather one by one.And then, they started to read the report in turns.\u2018All the soldiers know how to read?\u2019At this point in time, it was almost impossible for more than tens of soldiers to know how to read.\u2018Something\u2019s not right.\u2019The ones that knew how to read and fight.At this point in time, only knights knew how to do it.\u2018If they really are knights\u2026\u2026\u2019He had a method to check it.Roan inserted mana into Kalian\u2019s tear.At that moment, the world was dyed in a golden colour.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.The golden stream was filling the camp, the mana.And the mana of that place moved really roughly compared to other places.On top of that.\u2018Mana flows in the bodies of the patrol guards.\u2019They certainly weren\u2019t normal soldiers.\u2018They were the knights of Istel.\u2019And quite skilled ones on top of that.Their number surpassed 500.\u2018It\u2019s a force that amounts to more than two knight squads.\u2019Even if the storage was important, there was no reason to dispatch 500 knights at the rear like this.On top of that, it was even weird for the knights, who had strong pride, to be wearing the armors of normal soldiers.\u2018It\u2019s a trap.\u2019The thought filled his head.As there were thousands of normal soldiers protecting the outside of the camp, at first glance it seemed a real storage. But there were hidden knights at the center.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for Kalian\u2019s tear, it would have been dangerous.\u2019A sigh of relief flowed.\u2018I\u2019ll have to use Kalian\u2019s tear more earnestly from now on.\u2019He wasn\u2019t using it much because of the pain it inflicted him until now.\u2018But after that day, much of that pain has disappeared.\u2019The moment he escaped the fake storage.After the chill exploded out of his body, it became easy for him to handle mana.It was a feeling that the explosive and rough mana became calm.And maybe it was because of that, that when he inserted mana to the tear, the pain wasn\u2019t that severe.\u2018Although I couldn\u2019t find the cause in the end, it became easier to learn the Flamdor mana technique.\u2019But of course, the speed of accumulating mana was still slow.Roan wrote out the deployment of the soldiers in the storage and climbed down the mountain.Soon, the soldiers were all gathered up.The results of asking their opinions was that most of them couldn\u2019t find strange points.They just replied that the feeling it gave wasn\u2019t good.But Pens was certainly different.\u201cLooking at the location of the camp, the deployment, and the number of soldiers it seems like a real storage. But\u2026\u2026\u201dHe seemed to hesitate for a moment and then, continued saying.\u201cLooking at the armors, weapons, movements, and military discipline, they are an excessively powerful force. Although it\u2019s true that the location of the storage is important, taking into account that the front line is in a deadlock, it doesn\u2019t make sense that they are leaving this strong force in the rear.\u201dAt those words Roan faintly smiled and nodded.Although Pens couldn\u2019t grasp the flow of mana as he didn\u2019t have Kalian\u2019s tear, but instead, made the same conclusion after looking at the equipment and the faces.\u201cYes, I also think like that. They don\u2019t look like soldiers protecting the storage.\u201dRoan replied in a low voice.\u201cThey have an attacking posture that seems like they may be attacked at any moment.\u201dHe took in a deep breath.His sight moved to below the storage.\u201cEven so, this place\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe smiled bitterly towards Pens.\u201cSeems like a trap.\u201dOren and his agency would probably also have analyzed and checked the storage thoroughly.\u2018Even I was about to get tricked.\u2019Roan looked at Pens.\u2018But Pens found weird points even without Kalian\u2019s tear.\u2019He was amazed at his abilities.\u2018Why wasn\u2019t someone like this known in my past life?\u2019The most famous people in the agency were Chris and Oren.He didn\u2019t have any memories about Pens.And Roan also didn\u2019t know until now.That his role was quite big in making Pens bloom an ability he hadn\u2019t even thought about in this life.*****Roan, Pens, and the soldiers safely returned to the camp of Lancephil.And Oren and the others also did.Aaron, Roan, Pens, and Oren found Io\u2019s tent once again.\u2018It\u2019s been decided.\u2019Io could know the results even without asking.Aaron, who was smiling faintly, and the stiff expression of Oren.But even so, he couldn\u2019t make a decision beforehand.\u201cHas the truth and fake been revealed?\u201dAt those words Aaron hid his expression and bowed.\u201cUnfortunately, it was shown that the location Oren\u2019s agency found was a trap.\u201dHe gave the information Roan gathered, analyzed, and organized to Io.Io looked at the pile of papers and asked Oren.\u201cHow was your side?\u201dAt those words Oren smacked his lips for a moment and then replied with a low voice.\u201cThe results of our agency having checked on the storage the 7th corps found\u2026\u2026\u201dHe let out a short sigh and continued saying.\u201cWe speculate that it\u2019s the real deal.\u201dAt those words, Aaron\u2019s expression became even brighter.On the other hand, the expressions of Roan and Pens didn\u2019t have any change.Io checked the pile of paper Oren gave him thoroughly and then nodded.\u201cYou all have done well. Because of that, we could separate the storages between fake and real.\u201dHe looked at the knights, mages, and the captains that were seated at his side and continued saying.\u201cThe opportunity to finally end this war has come.\u201dThey exchanged opinions and talked about tactics and strategies about how to attack the supply storage.\u201cWhew.\u201dIo let out a long sigh with a relieved expression.\u201cThen, each commander is to prepare to depart.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAt the order, everyone replied in one voice.Only then could Aaron, Roan, Pens, and Oren get out of the tent.Even before they could take some steps, Oren blocked Pens.\u201cMister Pens.\u201dHe spoke in a blunt expression and voice.However, his eyes were shining strongly.He extended his right hand.\u201cThis time, we\u2026\u2026\u201dOren hesitated for a moment and then continued saying.\u201cNo, I lost. I realized that I still lack a lot.\u201dPens grabbed the hand Oren extended.\u201cAs I paid too much attention on the number of the soldiers, the location, the formation, and the composition, we were neglectful in observing the people.\u201dRoan, who was listening at the sides, was slightly surprised.\u2018Oren also realized his mistake.\u2019Certainly, someone that was born with it was born with it.Oren looked at Pens\u2019 eyes fixedly.\u201cNext time, I won\u2019t lose.\u201dAt those words, Pens who was absentminded, said with a casual expression.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you win the next time.\u201dAt the unexpected words, Oren frowned.\u2018Is he feeling sympathy for me?\u2019When he thought like that.Pens continued saying.\u201cI just hope for our allies to win.\u201dHe spoke one heavy sentence.Oren\u2019s face stiffened.He looked at Pens\u2019s expression for a moment and after letting go of the hand, he started to walk away.Aaron looked at Oren\u2019s back, who was getting further away, and mumbled in a low voice.\u201cHe took one, no, two blows by Pens.\u201dAt those words, Pens just laughed.Roan hit Pens\u2019s shoulders and smiled.\u201cThe location of the storage you and the information agency found with difficulty\u2026..\u201dHe put strength in his voice.\u201cI will pay you back with victory.\u201dAt those words, Pens replied shortly.\u201cYes. That\u2019s enough for me.\u201dWe\u2019ve become aware that there there is a site that is stealing our novels.

    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 75 - Danger inside the danger (6)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySponsored chapterAfter two days, count Lancephil and the 7th corps organized their camp and fell back to the west.No, precisely speaking, they pretended to fall back.Actually, the army consisting of more than 10.000 divided in small troops and moved towards the supply storage the 7th corps discovered.In this process, the gathered and analyzed information Oren and Pens brought was of great help.The army charged through enemy territory while using the safest and secret route.They didn\u2019t only move.Differently to the main force, a troop consisting of 2.000 soldiers went to the fake storage Oren\u2019s agency found on purpose.They moved to pretend they had fallen in a trap.Lastly Io, that remained at the rear of the camp, sent a report to Benjamin saying that they would attack Istel kingdom\u2019s headquarters.They were precautions to raise the chance of victory even a little bit more.Meanwhile, the 10.000 soldiers that were divided in small troops used the night and dawn and moved to the east little by little.Their destination was the entrance of a plain located near the boundary of the east.Because the location of Istel kingdom\u2019s storage was between mountains, it was difficult for Rinse kingdom to grasp that location.Rinse kingdom\u2019s army made a turn on a mountain at the west and went to a deep part of enemy territory.Based on the reconnaissance of the information troop and Oren\u2019s agency, most of the enemy forces were gathered at the eastern part of the mountain.Because of that, they didn\u2019t face them head on but aimed for their back.Rinse kingdom arrived at their destination only after 10 days had passed.And there were also many cases that the small troops got discovered by the enemies and got killed or fled.The soldiers that arrived at the appointed time was 9.000.They hid themselves and didn\u2019t move until the sun had set and darkness fell.Roan looked at the storage located at the end of the plains.The preparations certainly seemed solid.\u2018However, the number of knights is lower than the fake storage.\u2019Istel kingdom had used too many resources on carving the trap.\u2018The number of soldiers that have mana in their bodies are merely 30.\u2019It was plain night, but because of Kalian\u2019s tear he didn\u2019t have any problems on checking the camp.\u2018Compared to that, the knights of count Lancephil are more than 50.\u2019On top of that, there were also 10 mages.Although Istel kingdom had more normal soldiers, in the side of soldiers quality, they were quite ahead.\u2018But of course, what they show won\u2019t be everything.\u2019They wouldn\u2019t manage a place so important it may determine defeat and victory so sloppily.But even so, Roan was confident.\u2018In their position, it would be a surprise attack at an unexpected direction and one which they wouldn\u2019t even have been able to think of.\u2019On top of that, the morale of Rinse kingdom was as high as the sky.\u2018But even so, we have a need to check if there are other traps or not.\u2019Roan checked the storage thoroughly to not make the same mistakes as before.\u2018Hm?\u2019His sight got fixed in one place.A wooden fence that was at the left of the entrance.\u2018The flow of mana is strange.\u2019Precisely speaking, the air above that was weird.\u2018There\u2019s a fixed flow above the empty air of the fence.\u2019Normally, if it was a place filled with mana, it would move everywhere without any rules.\u2018Maybe?\u2019What he had to be suspicious of in this situation.\u2018Magic array?\u2019Roan frowned.The weakest point that was related to wars and battle.That was the things related to magic.His sight moved once again to the air above the fence.The mana that flows just like a whirlpool.\u2018It seems like the core of the magic array\u2026\u2026\u2019But he couldn\u2019t be certain.He didn\u2019t know anything about that field.Then, he saw the leader of the mages, Tairo Bess, moving busily,Roan pretended to take care of the soldiers and followed his back.Tairo went to find Kali Owells, that was in charge of the supreme commanding.\u201cCommander Owells. In the process of mana scanning, we discovered a magic array.\u201dIt was just like Roan had thought.Kali frowned.\u201cMagic array? What kind of magic?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Grand Shield.\u201dGrand shield.A huge scaled protection magic.It was the specialty of a school that used magic as it\u2019s theme.ALthough they were useless existences in a 1vs1 battle or surprise attacks, but they accomplished quite an outstanding role at defending, just like right now.\u201cMmm. They are more thoroughly prepared than what I thought.\u201dKali exclaimed and shook his head.\u2018If we can\u2019t make the grand shield powerless, this tactic becomes a failure.\u2019There were two methods.\u2018One is to attack the grand shield until it breaks.\u2019ALthough it was a solid shield, it wasn\u2019t that it couldn\u2019t break.However, you needed quite a lot of time and effort in a situation where you didn\u2019t have siege weapons and cavalrymen.\u2018The second method\u2026\u2026..\u2019Is to destroy the core of the array.The core was the center and essence that permitted the magir array to be maintained.\u201cHave you found the core of the array?\u201dAt Kali\u2019s questions, Tairo shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to scan it at this distance.\u201dKali nodded.He also knew about this truth.\u2018For now, we can only approach the most we can.\u2019They couldn\u2019t just wait time by waiting.The moment they discovered that the other party that attacked the fake storage was a bait, the tide would change once again.They had to end the battle before that.A situation where they had to hope for the mages to find the core of the array quickly.\u2018Tch. If the skills of the mages was a bit better\u2026\u2026\u2019He smacked his lips at the regretting feeling.If the abilities of the mages were great, they would be able to use mana scan, dispel, and attack magics to make the grand shield powerless.However, the level of Lancephil\u2019s mages wasn\u2019t that high.No, it wasn\u2019t only them.Right now, it was difficult to find high classed mages.\u2018After all the dragons disappeared, they started to decay little by little.\u2019Even so, as many schools appeared and developed in their own specialties, they became able to preserve their existence.However, it was true that the effectiveness in wars and battles declined even more.\u2018Rather, the shamans are giving treatments.\u2019Kali sighed and shook his head.\u2018If it becomes like this, we can only fire thousands of arrows without stop.\u2019If they were lucky, one of them may pierce through the core.He organized his thoughts and raised his right hand.\u201cWe are getting the closest possible to the storage.\u201dIn the end, they could only clash.The soldiers placed their right fist in their chest instead of replying.Sususu.The wind of the dawn shook the grass.Meanwhile, Rinse kingdom army started to move stealthily.The knights of Lancephil were at the front, behind them the region\u2019s army, and behind them the 7th corps followed. And at the rear, there were the 10 mages taking place.Kali, that stood at the front, soon arrived near the storage.\u201cMages.\u201dAt the lowly calling sound, the mages that were at the rear started to come to the front.The two arms that appeared below the robes.They executed the mana scan in front of the huge storage.Silence.The nasty silence just continued.Rinse kingdom couldn\u2019t even breathe loudly for fear of getting discovered.However, even after quite a lot of time had passed, the mages couldn\u2019t find the core.Tairo\u2019s expression stiffened even more.In the end, Kali couldn\u2019t endure it and asked.\u201cYou still couldn\u2019t find it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dTairo bowed.The size of the storage was too immense.For only 10 mages to scan all that place thoroughly was nearly impossible.Kali took in a deep breath.\u2018We can\u2019t keep wasting time like this.\u2019If it wasn\u2019t the best option, they had to go with the second best one.\u201cThe mages are to keep looking for the core.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dTairo nodded and fell to the sides.Kali pulled his long sword.\u201cPrepare to fire. We are pouring arrows.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe leader of the territory\u2019s army, Perr Wilson, replied shortly and prepared the archers.Chiiik!Fire was put on the tip of the arrows.\u201cFire!\u201dRight before he finished the order, the archers fired off their arrows.Sweeeeee!Thousands of arrows split the wind along a sharp sound.It was an intent that seemed to pierce through the tents, and sacks.However.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!A displeasing sound of metal.The thousands of arrows hit on the empty air above the fences like a lie and fell to the ground.The arrows that fell caught fire.\u201cIt really was grand shield.\u201dKali frowned.Then.Piiiiiii!A sharp sound that carved in their ears.\u201cThey even prepared an alarm magic?\u201dCertainly, there was no way they would protect the storage sloppily.At the sound of the alarm magic, the soldiers of Istel started to gather one by one.Anyways, the surprise attack was now useless. But even so, it wasn\u2019t a hopeless situation.Because the grand shield didn\u2019t differentiate between inside and outside, friend and foe.Just like Rinse kingdom couldn\u2019t get inside the storage, Istel kingdom also couldn\u2019t get outside of it.\u2018We have to finish it before their reinforcements come.\u2019If the day was bright, the enemy troop would come to assist them.They had to break the grand shield before that.Sweeeeeeek!Hundreds, thousands of arrows split the night sky.Then.Tat!One young soldier got out of the ranks and ran towards the storage.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dKali and the knights all frowned.\u201cRoan!\u201dAaron, that discovered the identity of the young soldier late, yelled in a loud voice.At that moment.Roan took a big step with his left leg and threw away his spear.Swaaaaaa!A sound that was different to the arrow.The spear shook like a fish and flew towards the grand shield.\u201cThat stupid bastard.\u201d\u201cHe thinks that a spear may do it because an arrow can\u2019t.\u201dThe knights clicked their tongues and shook their heads.However, Roan\u2019s expression was quite calm.He could see something others couldn\u2019t.\u2018Right. Just go like that!\u2019Roan\u2019s sight moved over the core of the array.He put an earnest desire behind.The spear split the air and precisely pierced the core of the array.Bang!A sound exploded.At the same time.Craaaak.Just like ice was breaking.Poong!The grand shield, that received a dent, got completely destroyed and disappeared.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dAt that moment, an awkward atmosphere fell on the battlefield.It was obvious for Rinse kingdom, but Istel kingdom was also hugely surprised at the sudden situation.The two sides just blinked with their mouths hanging open.Then, Roan yelled towards Kali.\u201cCommander!!!\u201dOnly then did Kali get a hold of himself.\u201cAh, Ah!\u201dStill a confused expression.\u2018Fo, for the grand shield to break!\u2019He raised his long sword high.\u2018I will have to check if he was lucky or if he has something else after the battle.\u2019As soon as he got a hold of himself, suspiciousness came first.But that was something for later.Now was the time to attack the open storage.Kali raised his sword.\u201cCharge!\u201dThe order that got finally sent.The 10.000 soldiers charged towards the storage with a fierce intent.\u201cBlock them!\u201d\u201cFire arrows!\u201dThe counterattack of Istel kingdom also wasn\u2019t light.\u2018If we get this storage taken over, everything ends!\u2019They were desperate.\u2018Damn. For the grand shield to break this quickly.\u2019The grand shield was to protect them in case they got attacked until reinforcements came.But that grand shield got broken by only one spear.What was fortunate was that they could prepare to some degree because of Grand shield and the alarm magic, even if it wasn\u2019t perfect.Bang!The entrance and the fences broke and Rinse kingdom entered above that.\u201cSon of a bitches!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dRinse kingdom ground their teeth.Swords, axes, and spears split the air.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!Sparks flung along with the sound of metal.Sweeeee!Arrows flew without stop from both sides.Flaaaaame!The inside and the outside of the storage started to transform to a sea of fire.\u201cFireball!\u201dHere on, the mages of Lancephil attacked.Following the extended arms, fireballs split the wind.\u2018KuK! Dman. It was our mistake to have sent most of the knights and mages to the fake storage.\u2019The commanders of Istel kingdom clenched their fists.\u2018We certainly, heard that the Rinse bastards were heading to the trap we had prepared, but were we the ones that took the blow?!\u2019Their bodies trembled.At the sides, the voices of Rinse soldiers was heard.\u201cSet it on fire!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s show an example to the Istel bastards!\u201dBonfired crumbled and torches flew over.At the same time, thousands of fire arrows covered the sky.Pung! Pubung!The tents caught fire and started to spread to the insides following the wind.\u201cPut the fire off!\u201d\u201cProtect the supplies!\u201dThe commanders of Istel yelled and urged the soldiers.\u201cHmph! Useless sounds!\u201dKali was a problem because he was narrow minded and fought desperately, but at least his skills were great.He lead the 50 knights and massacred the soldiers of Istel.\u201cWe are the knight guards of Lancephil\u2019s family!\u201dA loud yell.It was a voice filled with proudness.Then, a serious voice was heard at the other side.\u201cBastards! We are the cool breeze knights of Istel kingdom!\u201d30 knights came running with a fierce intent.Bang!Knight against knight.Knight squad against a Knight squad.A confrontation occurred in the middle of the fiery storage.Leaving them in the middle, the soldiers of both sides started to fight in confusion.Flaaaaaaame!The fire burned more fiercely.Finally, it gulped down the tents that had the provision sacks in it.Tadak. Tadak.Fire and sparks flew to the air.A dark smoke blew with the wind.It seemed like a rain of fire was raining inside the storage.\u2018This is a battlefield.\u2019Roan looked at the fire laying down over his armour and took a breath.It was because he felt full of vitality even when he hadn\u2019t operated Flamdor mana technique.The red flames surging up at his sides.The scattering fire.This place was just like heaven for him.A battlefield of fire.Roan gripped his spear.Behind him, rose troop appeared with Austin and Harrison at the front.\u201cTroop commander.\u201dAustin\u2019s voice was slightly trembling.And not only him.THe apple of adam of all the other soldiers was moving roughly up and down.Roan slightly turned his head and looked at the nervous expressions of the troop\u2019s soldier.The eyes that were as hot as the flames.Roan\u2019s mouth slightly moved.A smile that made you feel assured.Soon, a low voice but with strength was heard.\u201cJust trust in me and follow me.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapterThis chapter was once again fully sponsored by L.de Q.

Stab!Every Time the spear split the air, one soldier of Istel fell hopelessly.\u201cWhere!\u201dThe attacks of the enemies aiming for the openings got blocked by the soldiers at the sides.\u201cScatter!\u201dAt Austin\u2019s orders, the soldiers that were gathered like a rock got scattered everywhere.The soldiers of Istel, that were pushing stubbornly, got their feet tied at the sudden change.That short instant.At the moment that was created, the archers at the rear fired arrows.Pubububuk!\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dThe soldiers of Istel became porcupines and collapsed.As Austin clenched his fists again, the soldiers that were scattered gathered once again to become a rock.Their stabbed their spears at the hearts of the confused enemies.There was no mercy in a war.Then.\u201cThen!\u201dOne young knight of Istel came charging in with a high intent.As the performance of rose troop and the 2nd troop was too eye catching, he was planning to cut them off.The sword that had mana behind in came stabbing towards Austin.A situation of life and death.But even so, not even one soldier of rose troop retreated or stepped back.They rather glared at the young knight in front of them.\u201cRidiculous things! Mere normal soldiers dares to a knight\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he talked up to there.A sharp spear appeared from the sides.Kang!A heavy sound of metal.The spear hit the side of the sword of the young knight precisely.\u201cKugh!\u201dThe young knight frowned at the numbness felt in his palms and turned his head.\u2018What kind of bastard dares to!\u2019The man that fended off his sword.He had a childish face, but the moment he saw his face his breath got clogged.\u2018Fi, fire?\u2019The owner of the spear resembled a red flame.\u201cWho, who are you?\u201dThe young knight was asking unconsciously.The owner of the spear swung his spear first, instead of replying.\u201cKugh!\u201dThe young knight stepped back hurriedly and swung his sword.Sparks flew along the sound of metal.The owner of the soldier charged the ground like that and closed the distance.\u201cI\u2019m troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop belonging to the 7th corps of the eastern army of Rinse kingdom.\u201dAt those words the young knight frowned.\u201cTro, troop commander?! Not a knight?\u201dHe stabbed his sword towards Roan that was already in front of him.Roan twisted his body calmly.The sword split the air.At that moment.Roan\u2019s left hand carved in the left armpit of the young knight.\u201cUhh!\u201dThe young knight staggered because he was perplexed.Roan flung his waist while still having his arm in his side.The young knight drew a line and flew to the air.Boom!He rolled in the ground along a heavy sound.\u201cKugh.\u201dHis back and waist felt numb.Roan stepped on his chest with his right left.The young knight struggled to stand up.\u2018Kuk! Just how strong is he\u2026\u2026.\u2019However his body didn\u2019t move as he wished.At this point, curses of wanting to live surged up.\u201cI, i\u2019m a disciple of a noble family of Istel and a knight. If you capture me, you will be able to\u2026\u2026\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t continue his words.Stab.Because Roan\u2019s spear had already pierced his throat.There was no mercy in war.\u2018Especially, even more in battles like this one.\u2019Roan pulled his spear and faced the soldiers charging into him.Every Time his spear danced, three or four soldiers fell.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation came out of Austin\u2019s mouth.It kind of felt that the fire of the surroundings was dancing along with Roan.He mumbled in a half absent minded expression.\u201cPerhaps, perhaps.\u201dKeep, that was right next to him, frowned.\u201cDId you say something?\u201dAustin followed Roan\u2019s back and said.\u201cWe may be looking at a start of a legend.\u201dHowever Keep couldn\u2019t listen properly because of the loud noise of the battlefield.\u201cWhat did you say!\u201dBut Austin didn\u2019t mind.He now mumbled in a voice so low it couldn\u2019t be heard by anyone.\u201cNo, we are being together with the start of a legend.\u201dHe felt his chest heave up.Austin raised his spear high.\u201cFollow troop commander Roan!\u201dAt that order, rose troop took formations once again.Roan had already opened a path.The soldiers aimed for that and massacred the enemy.Austin yelled in a loud voice towards Roan.\u201cTroop commander Roan! We will follow you until the end!\u201dIn this battle, and even after this battle ended.You couldn\u2019t know if Roan knew that meaning or not, but he raised his thumb after he cut off the neck of an enemy.And then, he slightly turned his head and looked at his troop.\u201cI told you before.\u201dThere was a comforting smile still in his mouth.\u201cTo follow me while trusting in me.\u201dThe battle was coming to a close like that.*****The dawn that could be seen from the east.The battle had ended.The supply storage of Istel had been swept up by red flames.Huge flames that seemed to be there forever.However they didn\u2019t have time to rest while extending their limbs.\u201cWe will chase the bastards that escaped to the southwest of our Lancephil\u2019s territory.\u201dThe soldiers that were protecting the storage, fled to the sides when the battle was coming to an end.It didn\u2019t matter for the ones that fled to the east, but they couldn\u2019t just stay still at the ones that fled to the west.At Kali\u2019s words, Aaron nodded.\u201cMy 7th corps will also chase and kill them and after that go to the headquarters of the eastern region.\u201dA short farewell.Kali lead his army first and departed to the southwest.Aaron hurriedly gathered the troop commanders and reformed it.\u201cOur actual number is approximately 4.000. We will divide the army in two.\u201dThe decision was fast.Although they had burnt the supply storage, it was still too early to relax.There was still the main army of Istel kingdom, and there were still many knights and soldiers in the fake storage.\u2018If we stay here any longer, we may get left behind in enemy territory.\u2019They had to chase the ones that fled the quickest possible and regroup with the main army.\u201cI will be leading one, and the other one will do it Roan. I will go to the southwest, so Roan, you go to the west.\u201dSeveral troop commanders had died in battle.Now, even by taking into account the merits, performances, trust, etc. there was no such commander like Roan.Although there also was Gale, he was performing the role of staff officer next to Aaron.So Roan became the provisional vice corps commander.\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dHe didn\u2019t dare to decline.\u2018I receive moderately what needs to be received.\u2019That was Roan\u2019s way of thinking.The reforming of the group was done quickly.\u201chave a good fight.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s meet at the headquarters of the east.\u201dAaron and ROan looked at each other and smiled faintly.Each troop put the burning storage behind and went to the south and the southwest.*****The 2.000 soldiers conforming the 2nd rose troop.They received Roan\u2019s command and annihilated the scattered forces of Istel.In this process, the abilities of Pens and the information agency shone once again.Although it wasn\u2019t systematized properly, they found the feeling route and traces of the enemy and their tracking ability was towering above the rest.\u201cIt seems like we took care of most of them.\u201dAustin\u2019s report.Roan looked at the corpses of Istel\u2019s soldiers and nodded.This was already the 13th subjugation.Meanwhile, they had perfectly annihilated the small and big groups.\u2018The side of corps commander Aaron would already have regrouped with the main army.\u2019Looking at the direction, Aaron\u2019s side was closer to the headquarters.Roan turned his head and looked at the south.\u2018Here on, it would be better to leave the western region to the army of count Lancephil.\u2019It was now time to return to the headquarters.\u2018The main force of Istel won\u2019t be able to last much either.\u2019They were out of supplies, and the supply line got cut off.On top of that, excluding the main army, all the other groups were getting massacred.Although they still had many soldiers left in the headquarters, they didn\u2019t have the leisure or the morale to do so anymore.On top of that, the supreme commander leading Istel kingdom\u2019s forces was Mark Istel.He was a royalty that was quite close to the king of Istel.They wouldn\u2019t leave someone like Mark in the cave of a tiger.Retreating was a clear thing.\u201cWe are going to the south.\u201dA voice with strength.Austin and the soldiers saluted shortly and bowed.They put the battlefield under control and moved towards the south.As most of the soldiers were infantry, the movement speed wasn\u2019t as fast as he had thought.On top of that, most of them were exhausted at the continued battle.Roan rested moderately and moved.\u2018Soon, the last battle will happen.\u2019He needed to save energy for that.The second day of travelling.He could finally see the camp of the eastern army.Roan, that was at the front, frowned.Because the camp seemed kind of weird.\u2018Something\u2019s lacking.\u2019The camp was empty.His footsteps became quicker at the uneasy feeling.\u201cStop!\u201dThe guards that were protecting the entrance crossed spears and yelled.Roan stood at the front and yelled.\u201cIt\u2019s the 7th corps!\u201dThe guards checked the flag and the rank badge.\u201cAh! It\u2019s troop commander Roan of the 7th corps!\u201dOn top of that, Roan\u2019s face was quite famous.The guards hurriedly opened the gates.\u201cSir!\u201dRoan lead the troop and got inside the camp.He ordered the soldiers to rest and moved towards the centre of the camp.A place that had tents for the corps commanders.However, most of the tents were empty.\u2018Ah!\u2019Then, someone got in his eyes.It was corps commander Phillip Hass of the 5th corps.\u201cCommander Hass!\u201d\u201cMmm?\u201dPhillip turned his head at the sound calling out to him and then smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s Roan of the 7th corps.\u201d\u201cSir.\u201dRoan approached even more and saluted.\u201cI heard the notices. You have raised quite a big merit.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAt Phillip\u2019s compliment, Roan bowed and then looked at the camp.\u201cBut the camp feels quite empty.\u201dAt those words, the smile in Phillip\u2019s face became even denser.\u201cEveryone went to chase the main army of Istel.\u201d\u201cThe enemy\u2019s main army? They had already retreated?\u201dAlthough he certainly expected for a retreat, the time was just too fast.As Roan asked back in a surprised face, Phillip\u2019s nodded.\u201cRight. Although it was yesterday that we realized that they had retreated, actually it was way before that since they retreated.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me in detail?\u201dRoan wanted to know where the situation was flowing to.Phillip explained with a composed voice.\u201cCorps commander Aaron regrouped in the camp and a force also regrouped in Istel\u2019s headquarters. They say it was the force waiting in the fake storage.\u201dHe looked at the east.\u201cNot even preparing to retreat, but they had regrouped? We certainly thought that they would be preparing for the last attack. Although small troops of each side has clashed against each other, it didn\u2019t have that big of a meaning. Because we thought that the real battle would happen later on.\u201dPhillip looked at Roan once more.\u201cBut four days ago, the small scaled battles got cut off. They didn\u2019t come out of their camp. Instead, they just hit jings and drums. We thought that it was to raise the morale for the last battle. But that was a completely mistaken thinking.\u201dA hopeless look was in his eyes.\u201cThey didn\u2019t move even after 4 days had passed. So we sent a troop to their camp and provoked them. But even so, they didn\u2019t show any reactions. We fired arrows and threw rocks but it was the same. In the end, we got determined to die and charged in their camp. But\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was empty.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Phillip nodded.\u201cThe sound of the jing and drums was a fake sound made with a recording magic. They had retreated rather early. Just like when we retreated in the region of Bink.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dRoan gulped the exclamation.\u2018It\u2019s earlier than what I thought.\u2019It meant that the situation was that bad.\u2018Or they may have summoned Mark Istel a bit in a hurry.\u2019Although you couldn\u2019t do anything about a defeat, you had to save the life of a royalty.If the supreme commander was a normal soldier instead of a royalty like Mark, they would have continued doing war regardless of dying.\u2018Anyways, even if they returned to their kingdom, there was a high possibility to get beheaded or lose a territory.\u2019Defeat in a war was that much of a sin.\u2018However, a severe punishment isn\u2019t always a good thing. ANyways\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan\u2019s eyes slightly trembled.\u2018Recording magic\u2026\u2026\u2019It certainly was uncommon.But even so, retreating more than 5.000 soldiers without getting caught was quite a difficult thing.\u2018Was there a commander that outstanding in their ranks?\u2019He had perfectly grasped the situation of the commanders of Istel while preparing for war and while the war progressed.However, there wasn\u2019t that kind of dangerous existence among the commanders.\u2018Now that I see, the strategy of the fake storage wasn\u2019t that easy\u2026\u2026\u2019As he reviewed it again, he thought that there were many things he had thought of lightly.A feeling a lightning thundered in his head.Roan rummaged through the memories of his past life.Several battles and wars passed through his head.\u2018Among the outstanding existences in Istel kingdom\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019In the age of great wars, geniuses appeared not only in Rinse kingdom, but in each continent.Precisely because of that was that the age of great wars happened.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for that, a kingdom or empire would have gotten annihilated.\u2019Roan shook his head.\u2018If it\u2019s an existence of Istel kingdom, it would be at most the fox of the battle field count Peid Nail\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019But there wasn\u2019t a name like that among the names of the commanders Chris\u2019s agency and the information troop provided him.\u2018On top of that, he\u2019s merely in his twentie\u2026..\u2019WHen he thought like that.Roan\u2019s eyes opened.\u201cAh!\u201dAn exclamation came out of his mouth.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dPhillip tilted his head and asked.However Roan didn\u2019t even have the mind to reply.He bowed towards Phillips.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. An urgent thing occurred suddenly, so I will have to leave.\u201d\u201cHuh? Right. Then\u2026\u2026..\u201dPhillip couldn\u2019t end saying goodbye.Roan was already showing his back.\u201cCheop.\u201dPhillip smacked his lips with an awkward expression.\u2018Just what\u2019s the urgent thing\u2026\u2026..Hhm.\u2019His sight followed Roan\u2019s back.Roan ran towards the place the soldiers were resting without stop.\u201cMister Pens!\u201dAn urgent yell.Pens, that was resting between the soldiers, stood up.Roan made hand signs with an urgent expression.\u201cGive me the register of Istel kingdom.\u201dPens tilted his head at the sudden request.\u201cRegister? If it\u2019s the register, you would probably have\u2026..\u201dRoan shook his head.\u201cNot commanders above troop commanders, but the registers of adjutants.\u201d\u201cAdjutants? That was too massive so we couldn\u2019t organize it yet.\u201dPens replied with a perplexed expression.Roan nodded as if it was fine.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cWa, wait a moment.\u201dOnly then did Pens realize that something wasn\u2019t right.He rummaged his bag and then took out a pile of papers the size of two palms.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs soon as he received the papers, ROan sat on the ground.Flip. Flip.The sound of flipping paper was heard clearly.Pens and the other soldiers started to gather one by one.However Roan didn\u2019t mind and concentrated on the letters of the paper.\u201cPeid. Peid. Peid\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019For now, it was important to find that na,e.The names that were written in a disorganized way.His finger swept up the letters quickly.How long has it passed.Almost half of the papers were flipped.\u2018Right. Please, don\u2019t appear.\u2019Roan gulped dry saliva and flipped the paper once again.Flip. Tuk.At that moment, the finger stopped like a lie.\u2018Peid.\u2019There was.The name he didn\u2019t want to see was clearly written.The contents written was just that.But it was enough even with that.Roan\u2019s face stiffened.\u2018It\u2019s that bastard. The fox of the battlefield. It is that guy.\u2019He abruptly stood up.He couldn\u2019t think of it.The geniuses that represented each kingdom in the age of great wars.As he concentrated on the battles and the war, he had forgotten the truth of their existence for a moment.\u2018The commanders had to ignore him and neglect him\u2026\u2026\u2019However, if it was him that incentivated the retreat, it meant that his position had risen to a place.\u2018The fox of the battlefield wouldn\u2019t simply retreat.\u2019Even Ian, that was one of the genius strategists and the pride of Rinse, get done in by him 3 times.\u2018I have to chase the army of the eastern region.\u2019He had to stop them so they couldn\u2019t chase them anymore.Roan gave the papers to Pens and called Austin.\u201cGet ready to depart the quickest possible.\u201d\u201cCharging?\u201dAustin asked back with an expression as if what had happened.Roan looked at the east.\u201cWe are going to the east.\u201dAt those words, some soldiers said.\u201cAre we chasing the enemy?\u201d\u201cAre we chasing the main army of Istel?\u201dExpressions and voices that were a bit excited.They had finished the war and were quite excited.However Roan was calm.No, it rather felt like he was kind of low.He said in a voice he seemed to be mumbling.\u201cWe are rescuing our allies.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m vice troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop.\u201d\u201cI heard the notices that your merits were excellent.\u201dHe had a kind of reproachful expression.Roan quickly went to the main topic.\u201cAccording to the analysis of the information troop, the rearguard of the enemy\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he talked up to there, Benjamin shook his hand with a blunt expression.\u201cAgain with that information agency?\u201dHe had already heard of the performance of the information of the 7th corps through the corps commanders, staff officers, and even the soldiers themselves.Benjamin didn\u2019t like that the 7th corps had achieved a more remarkable merit than himself.He said with a brusque voice.\u201cIt\u2019s already after we fell into their trap and ambush.\u201dBenjamin\u2019s sight moved over the injured soldiers.\u2018Certainly\u2026..\u2019The fox of the battlefield was a fox even when he was young.Roan bit his lower lip.\u2018I have to stop him now.\u2019Saying his opinion to a supreme commander.And having to speak back with his opinion was not complying to the military discipline.On top of that, Benjamin was narrow minded and still lacking.He wasn\u2019t someone to receive Roan\u2019s opinion.\u2018Anyways, can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019He couldn\u2019t let their allies suffer a big blow even while knowing that it couldn\u2019t be done.\u201cWe have to stop the chase immediatel\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan couldn\u2019t finish his words once again.Benjamin put on an even sicker smile than before and interrupted him.\u201cAaron Tate already went to the chase while leading the 7th and 6th corps.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dRoan opened his eyes wide at the unexpected words.\u2018The 7th corps went to the chase?\u2019He thought maybe when he didn\u2019t see Aaron, Gale, and the several adjutants and soldiers.\u2018Damn. I thought that if it was Benjamin, he wouldn\u2019t give the chance for the 7th corps to accumulate more merits.\u2019He felt stifled.Benjamin, who was looking at that Roan, had quite fierce eyes.\u2018At first, I stood at the front and gave chase.\u2019It was to accumulate merits.Compared to the 7th corps that had accumulated small and big merits, Benjamin and the eastern army hadn\u2019t done much.However, he\u2019d be able to gain an incredible merit by slaying the supreme commander Mark at the last moment.But of course, it wasn\u2019t simply to accumulate merits.\u2018There\u2019s a rumour of Count Lancephil reporting the merits to the royal palace himself.\u2019If he made a mistake, he could get his territory taken away by Aaron.And not only that.\u2018There\u2019s also movements of the corps commanders of the region gathering around Aaron.\u2019A new force could be made in the eastern region.For Benjamin, who wanted to make his basic force more solid and climb to somewhere higher, the 7th corps became a thorn for him.Benjamin could stand up for the chase for several reasons.However.\u2018For the Istel bastards to install traps, ambushes, and fire tactics even while fleeing.\u2019And it wasn\u2019t at the level where they could block it even if they knew about it.Their attack was that scary.In the end, he just ended up losing soldiers instead of raising merits.Meanwhile, some corps commanders praised the 7th corps and made him feel annoyed.In the end, Benjamin changed his thoughts.\u2018Rather than approaching the eastern boundary that becomes the plains, let\u2019s put the 7th corps at the front of the chase.\u2019He was planning to pass the dangerous places like rivers, mountains, and forests to the 7th corps.\u2018If in that process they get done in by the Istel bastards, the merits they accumulated until now will become foam\u2026.\u2019The commanders that wanted to gather around Aaron would also lose their intent.On top of that, he could lower the retreating speed of Istel kingdom.In Benjamin\u2019s situation, it was three birds with one stone.\u2018If we just get to the plains, they won\u2019t be able to use tactics such as ambushes or surprise attacks.\u2019By then, he was planning to stand at the front and sweep them all up.\u2018I\u2019m finishing the war with my hands.\u2019The fantastical finishing touch was drawn in his head.He put a sickly smile towards Roan.\u201cIf it\u2019s Aaron and he 7th corps, they already have what they showed until now\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut the cynical voice lost it\u2019s direction and dispersed.Tat!Roan charged the ground and grabbed the reins.He didn\u2019t have time to listen to Benjamin\u2019s nonsense.\u2018I have to chase the 7th corps before it gets too late.\u2019They could still be safe.\u2018No, they certainly are.\u2019He didn\u2019t want to think about bad things.The faces of Aaron, Gale, Keniss, Dosen, and several soldiers appeared in front of his eyes.Roan pulled the reins and looked back.He saw the faces of Austin and the soldiers of 2nd rose troop.\u201cI\u2019m going to rescue the 7th corps.\u201dHe spoke in a heated voice.And eyes that were even hotter than that.\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be an easy thing.\u201dThe gazes of Roan and the soldiers interlocked.\u201cThe ones that want to stay, can do so.\u201dAt those words, Austin and the soldiers looked at each other and then burst out in laughter.\u201cTroop commander. What are you talking about?\u201dThere was no hesitation on their faces.\u201cYou said to follow you while trusting in you.\u201dAustin hit his armour with his right fist.\u201cWe\u2019ll only follow troop commander until we die.\u201dAt those words, Roan didn\u2019t say anything.He just nodded and looked towards the east.He yelled loudly before kicking his horse.\u201cWell then. Let\u2019s go and take back the 7th corps!\u201dHiiiiiing!The horse cried roughly and charged the ground.\u201cYap!\u201d\u201cChase them!\u201dAustin and the others followed his back.Horses and soldiers.Although both of them seemed exhausted, the morale was excellent.The 500 soldiers faced the sun with their backs and ran towards the east.*****Two middle aged men looked at the plains while riding their horses.The man with a thick face and clear eyes and nose smiled.\u201cThe one who came up with the rearguard tactic was an adjutant called Peid?\u201dAt those words, the man with small eyes bowed.\u201cYes. He was the senior adjutant of the fort troop Teise Martin was leading.\u201d\u201cDid you say he\u2019s merely 22?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s still a complete greenhorn.\u201d\u201cCan you call someone that could think of that tactic a greenhorn?\u201dThe clear eyed man pointed at the plain and shook his head.It was a sea of fire.The plain was swept up by an amazing fire to the point that you couldn\u2019t know where it started and ended.\u201cUaaaaak!\u201d\u201cSa, save me!\u201dInside of that, horrible yells were heard.However, there wasn\u2019t any change in the expression of the two men.\u201cIf I knew before that there was a guy like that below me\u2026..\u201dThe clear eyed man smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.\u201cThat isn\u2019t your fault. It\u2019s the fault of troop commander Teise who wanted to steal the merits.\u201d\u201cAbel. It was me that made someone like Teise a troop commander.\u201dAt those words, the small eyed man Abel Glishi, shut up.He looked at the man fixedly.\u2018Corps commander Tereise.\u2019The clear eyed man was a viscount named Daniel Tereise, and he was responsible for the rearguard.Daniel, who was also the commander of the 2nd corps of the western army of Istel, was quite calm and prudent and on top of that, didn\u2019t know fear.\u201cEven so, he\u2019s gets more amazing the more I think of it.\u201dDaniel was astounded with a surprising expression.\u201cIt was also like that with the mysterious retreat tactic, and the surprise tactics and ambushes that tied up their feet and the several traps. For a mere 22 year old adjutant to think of all of this by himself\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was also impressive that was defeated three or four times on purpose to bait them into the plains.\u201d\u201cRight. Because of that, we could put them inside the sea of fire.\u201dAt Abe\u2019s words, Daniel nodded with a proud expression.\u201cHe\u2019s a real fox. A fox.\u201dThen, a blue light shined inside the sea of fire.Abel\u2019s light slightly rose.\u201cIt seems like the grand shield was activated.\u201dAt those words Daniel slowly nodded.\u201cPrepare the soldiers at the rearguard. We are annihilating the enemies that got out of the fire.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAbel replied in a loud voice and then fell back.Daniel, who was left alone, looked at the plains that was swept up in fire and smiled faintly.\u2018Friends of Rinse. Don\u2019t chase us anymore. If you make a mistake then\u2026\u2026\u2019His smile became denser.\u2018You will be possessed by the fox.\u2019*****They ran and kept running.Faster than the wind.\u2018Please, don\u2019t let anything happen.\u2019For Roan, the 7th corps wasn\u2019t simply the corps which he belonged in.\u2018They\u2019re nice people.\u2019Corps commander Aaron at the front with the commander of rose troop Gale, the adjutants Keniss, Dosen, Johnson, etc. and the several soldiers he roamed in the battlefield while he put his life on the line.They were all good people.They laughed, cried, got happy and angry together.\u2018Expressing it in one way, they\u2019re like family\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2019On top of that, the 7th corps was the starting point of this life.It had a special meaning for Roan.\u2018That\u2019s why nothing bad has to have happened!\u2019He stuck his chest to the horse and kicked it.Then, Roan\u2019s expression stiffened.\u2018Damn!\u2019Because of Kalian\u2019s tear, he could see the entrance of the gorge that was far away like it was right in front of him.There were many corpses.\u2018It\u2019s not the 7th corps.\u2019They would probably be of the 6th corps.It seemed like they had received a surprise attack before they entered the gorge.Roan kicked his horse once again.Soon, the head of the horse entered the entrance of the gorge.\u2018Mmm.\u2019The entrance was crueler than what he had thought.He saw the hundreds of soldiers that became porcupines.Most of them were soldiers of Istel.Roan didn\u2019t move around in the gorge hurriedly and used Kalian\u2019s tear and to check his surroundings thoroughly.He even checked the flow of mana.\u2018There\u2019s nothing.\u2019What he could see were only corpses.Certainly, most of them are corpses of soldiers of Rinse.\u201cWe are charging through.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood.\u201dThe soldiers didn\u2019t talk back.They believed in Roan.Roan and the 500 soldiers rode towards the gorge.There were several arrows stuck into the sides of the mountain.\u2018Did they pour the remaining things without any care?\u2019Roan ground his teeth.He felt uneasiness increase the more time passed.\u2018Just where is commander Tate\u2026..\u2019Then, a really faint war cry was heard.\u2018Maybe?\u2019Roan looked at the exit of the gorge fixedly.When he used Kalian\u2019s tear again.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2019A low exclamation came out.\u2018It\u2019s Rinse kingdom!\u2019Roan ground his teeth.They were at the scenery that spread outside the gorge.But there was a problem.\u2018What an amazing fire!\u2019The plains was a sea of fire.\u2018Damn. Was it also the fox of the battlefield?!\u2019Roan consecutively hit the horse.Hiiiiiiiiing!The horse brought up all the strength it had and charged forward.Behind him, the 500 soldiers followed his back.Dudududu.Roan left the gorge first alongside the sound of horse clops.At that instant, the huge plain was spread out in front of him.Flaaaaaaame!A hot wave came surging.He could still feel it even when he was using Brent\u2019s ring.\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201dFollowed by him, the normal soldiers that left the gorge ground their teeth at the amazing fire.Everything he saw was a sea of fire.The soldiers of Istel kingdom were inside that hell of a sea.\u201cEvacuate the soldiers to the gorge!\u201d\u201cYe, yes! Understood!\u201dThe 500 soldiers endured the strong heat and moved inside the path of fire.\u2018Fortunately, I can\u2019t see any enemies.\u2019The fire was that strong and rough.Roan sent his horse that was suffering back to the gorge and moved towards the fire.Then.\u201cTroop commander! To, to the east!\u201d\u201cCorps commander got caught at the front!\u201dThe soldiers of the 7th corps yelled with all of their strength.Roan hurriedly moved his sight to the east.Kalian\u2019s tear showed its might once again.\u2018That\u2019s? Grand shield?\u2019It was an unexpected situation.A huge scaled magic barrier was taking place inside the path of fire.\u201cAh!\u201dAt that moment, a yell close to astonishment was heard.\u201cCorps commander! Troop commander!\u201dAaron, Gale, and the other commanders were inside the grand shield.But there was a problem.\u2018Fox of the battlefield. You crazy bastard!\u2019There was an amazing path of fire surging inside the grand shield.It was a situation that Aaron, Gale, and etc. couldn\u2019t even dodge it as they were trapped inside of it.Peid had used the defensive grand shield as a way of attack.Tat!Roan charged the ground.As he pulled mana, an amazing energy overflowed.The fire in his surroundings danced.Pat!As he inserted mana into Kalian\u2019s tears, the whole world was dyed in golden light.\u2018That\u2019s the core!\u2019As the size of the grand shield wasn\u2019t that big, the core was located in a place could be broken with a throw of the spear.However.\u201cNo!\u201dA scream came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.The moment he threw the spear.The fire inside the grand shield covered Aaron, Gale, and etc.Swaaaaaaa!The spear split the air along with an amazing sound.Chung!The spear precisely pierced the core.Chujujujug. Pung!The grand shield broke alongside the loud sound.Whoooosh!The fire that was inside the grand shield exploded to the sides.Roan executed the Flamdor mana technique and ran while piercing through the path of fire.\u2018Kugh!\u2019As the fire touched his skin directly, he felt a disgusting pain.Brent\u2019s ring was also useless at this point.However, he never stopped or fell back.Waaak!He arrived at the place the grand shield was taking place.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA hopeless look.Roan moved his feet as if he was dragging it.There were burnt corpses in the place the grand shield was.There was nothing alive.The place his sigh stayed.Several people turned over themselves and were making a round shape.Roan moved the corpses that were outside one by one.\u201cKugh.\u201dEmotions overflowed.His front was cloudy and something hot surged up.Roan unconsciously clenched his fists.The blackly burnt corpses that you couldn\u2019t even recognize.Even so, the corpses that were inside were maintaining their shape to some degree.Then.\u201cUhh\u2026\u201dA weak groan was heard.Roan opened his eyes wide.The cloudy eyes found their focus again.He carefully moved the corpses and in the quickest possible speed.\u2018Ah! Adjutant Dosen, Adjutant Keniss\u2026\u2026\u2019They were familiar faces.They died while getting half burnt.And a familiar back was seen below them.\u201cTroop commander Gale!\u201dRoan grabbed him carefully and turned him over.\u201cUhh\u2026\u201dA low exclamation came out of Gale\u2019s mouth.He was still alive.Still.\u201cTroop commander Gale!\u201dRoan called out Gale\u2019s name.His face was half melted.Gale breathed out roughly and barely opened one eye.\u201cIt, it\u2019s Roan.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m Roan. I have come!\u201dRoan wiped out the tears that came out and nodded.Gale forced a smile.\u201cI saw you coming in from the outside of the grand shield.\u201dHe kept moving his body.\u201cCorp, corps commander Tate?\u201dThe reason he tried to turn his head.He was curious about Aaron\u2019s state, who he was covered up.And fortunately, Aaron\u2019s state wasn\u2019t that bad.His face and skin were slightly red, but it didn\u2019t seem like he had any wounds.Roan hurriedly extended his hand and he measured his pulse.\u2018It\u2019s beating.\u2019He was alive.It was because Mendel, Gale, Keniss, and the adjutants had covered him.They had sacrificed themselves and saved Aaron.\u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Gale let out a sigh of relief.He extended his still fine right hand and caressed Roan\u2019s face.\u201cRoan. It seems like I\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say such things.\u201dRoan put on an angry face on purpose.Gale shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s a life that already should have been dead. But I could come up to here because of you.\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for Roan, he would have already died at Ale gorge, Pedian\u2019s plain, and Slen region.\u201cI, I wanted to see you soaring to the skies\u2026\u2026Kugh.\u201d\u201cStop speaking. I will bring some soldiers.\u201dGale extended his hand and grabbed Roan\u2019s arm.\u201cJust, just stay by my side like this.\u201dRoan just grabbed Gale\u2019s arm instead of replying.A temperature hotter than the fire was transmitted.\u201cI lived without regrets\u2026\u2026..\u201dGale\u2019s voice lowered.And his roughly heaving chest also seemed to have found comfort.It was a situation where he didn\u2019t have much time left.\u201cThere\u2019s no death more suitable for a commander than dying in the battlefield.\u201dHis mouth slightly rose up.\u201cRoan. Take care of Rose troop\u2026..\u201dThose were his last words.The light in his eyes had disappeared.\u201cKugh.\u201dRoan extended his hands and closed Gale\u2019s eyes.He was dead.He tried to save him but he couldn\u2019t.The mana that was spinning in his body moved roughly.Flaaaaaame!The flames that were gulping down the plain already moved near him.\u2018Troop commander Gale, adjutant Keniss, adjutant Dosen\u2026\u2026.\u2019And the several soldiers.Everyone was dead.\u201cUaaaaaaaaa!\u201dA loud scream came out.A blood boiling rage exploded.\u2018Monarch my ass! I can\u2019t even protect my own people!\u2019Powerlessness and rage.Following Roan\u2019s emotions, the mana moved more roughly.The flames in his surroundings danced towards him.The hot wave entered his body through his nose, mouth, and skin.The mana that lost it\u2019s balance once was like a storm.His entire body trembled.The mana sucked in the heat and became largerA disgusting pain filled him up.Roan stood up and clenched his fists.At that moment, the mana that was spinning roughly inside his body stopped like a lie.\u201cKugh!\u201dHis breath was cut off.At that moment.Bang!The mana inside his body exploded.At the same time, a red light emanated in Roan\u2019s entire body.The fire that was dancing, fell backwards.\u201cUaaaaaa!\u201dRoan screamed at the feeling his body was breaking up.Then.The red light that was being emanated from his body started to get sucked in inside of his body.Flaaaame!The fire that was burning the plain covered Roan following the red light.This was a situation of life and death.The crimson flame started to get absorbed inside Roan\u2019s body like a lie.And that speed and strength was overwhelming.Roan just stood still while he had his eyes closed.An awkward and heavy silence fell.Then.Paat!A red light emanated from Roan\u2019s entire body.At the same time, his hair grew to his waist.The brown hair changed to become bright red.And it was the same for his brows.This was a strange phenomenon.After a while, the red light returned to his body once again.Only then did Roan open his eyes.Open.Even his eyes that were brown turned to become red.He smiled coldly and turned his head.Istel kingdom\u2019s army was over there.They were hiding themselves to annihilate the soldiers of Rinse kingdom that escaped the fire.\u201cWh, just what\u2019s this!\u201dViscount Daniel staggered with a perplexed expression.\u2018For, for a human to absorb fire!\u2019He had never heard or saw something like that.Then, Daniel and Roan looked at each other.Roan took out Travias spear from his waist.Click! Cheng! Swuung!The stick shaped Travias spear became long.It had the shape of a perfect spear.The long spear shone with a red light.Roan looked at Istel\u2019s army and closed his eyes.\u201cKuuuuuuu.\u201dAn unknown sound flowed out of his mouth.And that resembled the cry of a beast.Tat!Roan charged the ground.No, the moment they thought that.He was soon in front of Istel kingdom\u2019s army.\u201cKuaaaaa!\u201dA strange sound came out of Roan\u2019s mouth once again.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 78 - Overflow (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay2,000.The number of Istel kingdom\u2019s army was 2,000.And among them, there were ten knights that knew how to use mana.Because Rinse kingdom received a loss close to annihilation, the number of the force wasn\u2019t bad by itself.However, Daniel fell in a kind of despair the moment he saw the youth in front of him.\u2018We are not his opponents.\u2019He was famous as a commander who didn\u2019t know what fear was.But this time was different.He lost his breath at the nasty fear of Roan.\u201cGrrrrrrrr.\u201dThe youth let out a cry that resembled a beast.He had red hair, red eyebrows, and red eyes.He was Roan.\u201cKuaaaaaa!\u201dA cry exploded out.Daniel stepped back and pulled his sword out.\u201cThe knights are to face that bastard with me.\u201dHe spoke in a calm voice.\u201cThe normal soldiers are to escape without even looking back.\u201d\u201cCorps commander!\u201dThe soldiers yelled with a surprised expression.\u201cIt\u2019s an order! Flee!\u201dIt was an order close to despair.Daniel charged forward and ran towards Roan.Abel and the knights followed his back.\u2018A moment, if we can tie him up for a moment\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019When he thought up to there.Paat!Travias spear split the air.Swush!At the same time, the spear became larger than before.\u201cHup!\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201dDaniel and the knights looked at the spear that became three or four times larger and ground their teeth.They swung their respective weapons and tried to block Roan\u2019s attack.Cheeng!A heavy sound of metal clashing was heard.At the same time.Boom! Booboom!Daniel and the other knights were flung to the sides.\u201cKugh.\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dThey rolled on the ground.\u201cKuhuhuhu!\u201dRoan laughed strangely and then charged the ground.He arrived in front of the knights that were on the ground in an instant.As he held the spear upside down, the long spear shrunk to the size of a long sword.Stab.The spear pierced the chest of the knight like that.\u201cGrr.\u201dThe young knight couldn\u2019t even fight back at all and died.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cGet him!\u201dDaniel and the other knights raised their intent.Roan crushed the head of the dead knight with his right leg and lightly jumped.Swush!At that moment, the spear became larger.Roan then jumped ino the air.Daniel and the knights just blinked while having lost their objective.\u2018That spear is maybe\u2026\u2026.\u2019Daniel looked at the spear that changed length as it wished and frowned.As he remembered, there was only one spear like that in the world.\u2018Travias spear?\u2019Then, the enlarged spear shrank quickly again.It became the size of a normal spear in an instant.Roan twisted his body in the air and balanced himself.It was a soft and fluent movement.He arrived at the back of the knights.The backs of the knights were exposed to Roan in an instant.Roan instinctively swung his spear and tried to cut off their heads.Strength was put behind the wrist and palm by its own.When Travias spear was about to split the air again.\u201cKuhk!\u201dRoan suddenly bent his back and let out a strange sound.Because he felt a sickening pain inside his body.\u201cKuuuuuu.\u201dA groan was heard.The red color of his hair, eyebrows, and eyes became even more dense.On top of that, even his skin started to turn red.\u201cCough!\u201dEvery time he coughed, flames appeared from his body and then disappeared.Roan wasn\u2019t normal right now.The cause was that he had operated the Flamdor mana technique unreasonably to save his allies.Meanwhile, the heat in the plain entered his body and the balance of his mana collapsed.As he saw the 7th corps and rose troop getting massacred in front of his eyes, his emotions stirred.In that really short instance, he lost control over his mana. But that short moment was the problem.The mana started to overflow on its own.And the overflowing of the mana made his emotions shake even more.Thanks to that, the overflowing became more and more severe the more time passed.In the end, Roan lost himself to the mana.Now, there was no way to control the mana that was jumping everywhere.If this state continued even a little bit more, the overflowing mana wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it and then his body would explode or split apart.\u201cCough!\u201dSmall flames appeared as he coughed.Daniel saw that and raised his sword high.\u201cThis is the moment! Kill him right now!\u201dThey realized that Roan\u2019s body wasn\u2019t normal.Daniel and the knights ran towards Roan.A blue light flowed along the sword.\u201cDie!\u201dThe knights yelled with all their strength.Right before the sword was about to tear up Roan.\u201cKua!\u201dRoan swung his spear and let out a strange noise.At that moment, his surroundings were set on fire.Cheng! Checheng!A clear sound of metal clashing rang out.The knights couldn\u2019t pierce through the path of fire.\u201cPress him down!\u201dHowever Daniel didn\u2019t fall back.He thought that this was the last opportunity to kill Roan.Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!The sound of metal was heard continuously.Sparks and fire appeared along the path of fire.Spat!Finally, Daniel\u2019s swords sliced Roan\u2019s wrist.However, it was a really shallow wound.\u201cKuaaaaaa!\u201dRoan let out a cry and held his spear.Stab.At that moment, the thickness of the spear became that of a wrist.Woong. Woong. Woong.A heavy sound sounded out.Travias spear split the air.Puk!The knights were bounced off along with a loud sound.\u201cKugh!\u201dAlthough they had raised their swords and blocked the blow, the strength behind the spear was too amazing.Roan swung the huge spear as if it was nothing.And every time he did that, the knights were flung to the sides.At that moment.\u201cWe will also help!\u201dA group of people appeared alongside the loud yell.They were the veteran soldiers that had been with Daniel the longest.Approximately 200 soldiers raised their weapons and appeared.\u201cI told you to retreat!\u201dDaniel yelled while swinging his sword.The soldiers pushed back Roan without giving him any rest and replied in one voice.\u201cWe are the rearguard army! Originally, the rearguard doesn\u2019t have a life!\u201dThis was their resolution they wouldn\u2019t escape even if that meant death.Daniel clicked his tongue.\u201cStupid bastards.\u201dBut he was quite proud and gratified.\u2018I didn\u2019t teach them wrongly anyways.\u2019He felt that strength was put into his limbs.He yelled with strength.\u201cFight with the resolution to die!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dAnyways, the role of the rearguard army was to block the chasing of the enemy.They just had to buy enough time for their allies to safely retreat.\u2018Even if he seems to be a monster, a human is a human.\u2019He won\u2019t be able to face all these soldiers and knights by himself.No, even if that was possible, he would end up exhausted or get small and big wounds.On top of that, Roan also wasn\u2019t normal.\u2018In the first place, we didn\u2019t even hope for victory.\u2019Daniel was just planning to buy time.That much was enough.He charged the ground and ran towards Roan.A blue light flowed along the sword.Although it was faint and didn\u2019t have a good shape, the strength of it was felt clearly.Cheng!Roan\u2019s spear clashed with Daniel\u2019s sword.Below him, the other knights swung their swords.Roan turned his body and swung his spear.Cheng! Chencheng! Cheng!Sparks appeared along with with the sound of metal.Every time he turned his body, a red light appeared in his spear.However, it was unreasonable to look at that as mana.The red light became even more dense and it transformed to become a path of fire in the end.Travias spear became a line of fire from the blade to its body.\u201cDamn! Is it fire again?!\u201dDaniel yelled and flung his body backwards.And the other knights also did the same.In an instant, only Roan was left alone.Above that, the arrows the rearguard army fired poured down.\u201cKuaaaaa!\u201dRoan let out a cry and spun his spear above his head.No, he spun the line of fire.Pubububung!The rain of arrows exploded the instant it touched the line of fire.\u201cKeep firing! Keep firing!\u201dAbel yelled as if he had fallen in despair.The archers fired arrows without stop.However, not one of the archers could pierce through Roan\u2019s spear wall.Then, Roan lightly rolled his foot and got in between the soldiers.The spear that caught fire split the air and attacked.\u201cMonster like bastard!\u201dDaniel, who had fallen back, attacked while resolving himself to die again.Cheng! Checheng!However, their attacks were too easily blocked.Roan fended off all of their swords with his spear and then swung it once more.\u201cUaaaaak!\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201dThe limbs of the knights were cut off cleanly.The spear kept moving flexibly and then attacked Daniel\u2019s neck.At that moment.\u201cCough!\u201dRoan coughed with a painful expression.He wriggled for a moment and then threw his spear away.\u201cKuaaa!\u201dA scream mixed with pain.An amazing fire surged up from all over his body.\u201cDie!\u201dDaniel and Abel brought all their last strength and stabbed him.The moment the swords were about to touch Roan\u2019s body.\u2018Kug!\u2019An amazing repulsive force was felt at the tip of his hands.Bang!The path of fire exploded along with a loud sound.\u201cKuhuk!\u201dDaniel and Abel couldn\u2019t endure it and were bounced off.Their swords were half melted and there were flames on their elbows and shoulders.\u201cDamn it!\u201dDaniel and Abel fell back and after putting out the fire, they looked at Roan.\u201cKuaaaa!\u201dRoan was still struggling while screaming.The fire that emanated out of his body made a huge pillar of fire.\u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u2019Daniel clenched his fists.Even the sword with mana behind it was useless.He made eye signs to Abel and started to slowly fall back.\u201cWe are retreating.\u201dThe short order was sent to the soldiers.The soldiers just nodded without saying anything.They started to step back really slowly.And fortunately, Roan didn\u2019t show interest in them.No, he wasn\u2019t able to.\u201cKuaak!\u201dBecause the mana that was overflowing in his body had started to reach the peak.\u2018It seems like the mana is overflowing\u2026\u2026.\u2019Daniel looked at the pillar of fire emanating out of Roan\u2019s body.\u2018It would be good if he died like this.\u2019Those were his honest feelingsFor a monster like that to exist in Rinse kingdom was a horrible thing and a disastrous devil for Istel kingdom.When the rearguard army was getting farther from Roan, contrary to them, the 2nd rose troop was running towards Roan.\u201cTroop commander Roan!\u201dThey also saw Roan absorbing fire.And of course, the look of his hair growing and turning red.They felt awe at the look of battling the rearguard alone.However, they realized that Roan\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t normal quite late.\u2018We are saving the troop commander ourselves!\u2019When the 2nd rose troop moved quite close to Roan.\u201cKuhok!\u201dRoan\u2019s screams stopped.At the same time, the fire pillar that was burning fiercely died off.\u2018Di, did it turn fine?\u2019Austin looked at Roan with uneasy eyes.Then, wind blew at his back.But it wasn\u2019t the west wind.\u2018This?\u2019Austin and the soldiers opened their eyes abruptly.Swaaaaaa!The wind blew towards Roan.\u2018Kuk! Dangerous.\u2019Austin realized that something wasn\u2019t right.He made a sign towards the 2nd rose troop.They laid down on the ground as if they had practiced it.At that moment.Baaaaaang!A huge explosion occurred with an amazing sound.The wind that was blowing towards Roan started to spread towards the sides again.Alongside that came the huge fire.\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t raise your heads!\u201dThe members of the 2nd rose troop buried their faces onto the ground.And fortunately, the fire surged over the ground.\u201cKuaaaaa!\u201dRoan cried out one more time.He was burning his mana currently.No, precisely speaking, he was sucking the heat scattered in the atmosphere and burning the mana above his abilities.Because of that, the mana hole and the mana road inside his body ripped and regenerated, and repeated doing that.If this continued, it was obvious that his entire body would explode.But there was nothing that could be done.Roan had lost his sanity and there was no method in which others could approach him.At least, there was nothing a human could do.Then.Spat!The fiercely burning fire was split up.And among that split space, a beautiful woman appeared.She had blue hair and really transparent skin.She, who was wearing a sky dress, was barefoot but that was meaningless.Because she was floating in the air just like a cloud.\u201cIn the end, you became like this.\u201dShe had a beautiful voice.She was the woman that was looking at Roan inside Biate\u2019s place.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t like you, I can\u2019t go against Biate\u2019s will.\u201dThe woman approached Roan who was covered in fire and shook her hand.At that moment, a huge orb of a blue light covered her and Roan.The fire that was spreading out was caught inside that orb.\u201cThe one who has my tear.\u201dThe expression of the woman was kind of stifled.She softly covered Roan\u2019s cheeks with her hands.The red flame escaped her hands and fled.The woman whispered with a clear and pretty voice.\u201cI, the water elemental king Ellaim, have come to rescue you.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

the resting place again after Biate died in Poskein lake.It was because of Biate\u2019s will.Ellaim waited for 50 years to fulfill her will.And if the one that entered the resting place was someone capable to follow Biate\u2019s back, she was planning to make a contract and lead him to the lake.Because the last piece Biate left was over there.But maybe it was fate playing with her, or a god teasing her, but the one that entered Biate\u2019s place was learning Reid\u2019s mana technique.The mana technique of the enemy that killed Biate.If that guy hadn\u2019t absorbed her tear, and wasn\u2019t for Biate\u2019s last will, Ellaim would have returned to the elemental world.\u2018Although it\u2019s displeasing and uncomfortable, this may also be fate.\u2019Ellaim fulfilled Biate\u2019s will.She watched the guy from a close place.And on top of that, she had even wanted to help when his life was in danger.But the guy overcame the difficulties by himself.\u2018But of course, being able to overcome that danger was also because of my tear.\u2019The overflowing of flamdor mana technique.Every dangerous time, Ellaim\u2019s tear calmed down the overflowing mana.\u2018But this time it\u2019s different.\u2019Even before Ellaim\u2019s tear could show it\u2019s strength, the heat in his body and the surrounding heat got mixed and repeated exploding and overflowing.A situation where you wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it with the body of a human.If this situation continued a little bit more, it was obvious that his entire body would explode or tear apart and die.\u2018I also thought about letting him die like this\u2026\u2026..\u2019But she didn\u2019t want the end Biate\u2019s last wish like that.On top of that.\u2018Excluding that he\u2019s learning on Flamdor mana technique, he\u2019s quite a fine guy.\u2019The results of having looked after him until now was that he was a human worth saving.Ellaim showed her hidden body like that.She poured the essence of water over Roan\u2019s head.But it wasn\u2019t at the level of what humans absorbed and felt.The best of the best.It was the cleanest and most perfect essence of water.Swuuuush.The fire that was emanating from Roan\u2019s body shook roughly.It was resisting against Ellaim\u2019s water.\u2018Flamdor mana technique wasn\u2019t made by a human.\u2019Ellaim shook her head at the rough repulsive force she felt at the tip of her hands.Even she couldn\u2019t know the exact identity of Flamdor mana technique.Only, she couldn\u2019t think that a mana technique so strong it was able to oppose the strength of a spirit king was made by a human.\u2018It\u2019s a disgustingly rough and strong force.\u2019Ellaim\u2019s face stiffened.\u2018Even Reid got eaten up by this strength.\u2019The deeper the achievements in the mana technique became, his temperament became more explosive and urgent.The reason he came to find Biate all the way to her cave, regardless of her denial, was also because of this.Ellaim looked at Roan\u2019s face.\u2018My strength and the strength of my tear will calm down your flamdor mana technique.\u2019Just looking at the growth speed of the technique, the speed could get a bit slower.However, the heat inside his body wouldn\u2019t overflow as it wished or made him lose his nature.\u2018On top of that, if you discover the mystery Reid and Biate realized before they died, you would be able to attain an unimaginable strength.\u2019Even Ellaim couldn\u2019t imagine that strength.Because she only controlled one force, that was the essence of water.\u2018One more reason has been added to look after him.\u2019Ellaim bent her fingers and brought up more of the essence of water.Frrrr!The fire that was emanating out of Roan\u2019s body resisted roughly one more time.However, as the understanding of the technique was still shallow, it was still too early to beat the strength of an elemental king.The fire died off even more.Swuuush.The fire that was caught in the blue orb got absorbed inside of ROan\u2019s body.The flames that were moving his body roughly found stability and then returned to the mana hole.Even the red features returned to the original looks.\u2018Because an overwhelming amount of mana overflowed, the mana hole and the mana road became even bigger and solid.\u2019From misfortune to a blessing.Ellaim smiled bitterly and clenched her fists tightly.As she had calmed down the fire, only her tear and the essence remained now.After Ellaim awakened the strength of the tear, she mixed it up with the essence of water.Paat!Roan\u2019s body was filled with the essence of water in an instant.Ellaim gathered the essence roundly and covered Roan\u2019s mana hole softly.Just as if she covered it with a thin cloth.\u2018If I do this, even if the fire essence explodes, it won\u2019t come out of the mana hole.\u2019Ellaim let out a long sigh and took off her hands slowly.Roan\u2019s face seemed much comfortable now.Ellaim looked at that face for a moment and then pressed on Roan\u2019s forehead with her index.She planted what had just happened inside of Roan\u2019s memories.It still wasn\u2019t time for them to meet and converse.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t disappoint Biate\u2026\u2026..\u201dEllaim\u2019s voice softly flowed.Swush.The blue orb disappeared.At the same time, Ellaim also disappeared.Tuk.Roan slowly fell.Just as if he was asleep.\u201cTroop commander!\u201dThe soldiers of the 2nd rose troop yelled in one voice.Ellaim\u2019s appearance and retreat happened in just an instant.Because of that, in the eyes of the soldiers, it was seen as if a blue orb shone for an instant and then the fire disappeared.\u201cTroop commander Roan!\u201dThe soldiers ran towards Roan with weird looks.\u2018What was that just now?\u2019\u2018I feel like there was someone over there.\u2019As it was a really short instant, they couldn\u2019t even see Ellaim properly.Austin and the soldiers kneeled down around Roan.Roan, that was lying down as a dead rat.Gulp.Everyone looked at him with nervous looks.Then.Blink.Roan opened his eyes abruptly and rose his upper body.\u201cHuhuk!\u201dThe soldiers got surprised and gulped in air.However, they got happy at the truth that Roan was alive and yelled.\u201cTroop commander! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t hurt?\u201dExpressions filled with worry.Extravagant voices.But even so, Roan still had an absent minded expression. His eyes had lost focus.He was concentrating on the voice Ellaim had left in his head.\u2018So that silver water drop was Ellaim\u2019s tear.\u2019The moment the identity of the coldness inside his body got revealed.\u2018Although the growth speed of the mana technique slowed down, it rather became stable.\u2019On top of all.\u2018If I can awaken the mysteries\u2026\u2026.\u2019He may be able to attain a strength he couldn\u2019t even imagine.Roan took in a deep breath.\u201cTroop commander!\u201d\u201cCan you hear my voice?\u201dThe soldiers yelled even stronger when they saw that Roan didn\u2019t show any reactions.ONly then did Roan smile brightly and look at everyone\u2019s faces.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dAt that moment, a smile blossomed on the worried faces of the soldiers.\u201cAh! How great! What a relief!\u201dThey let out a long sigh.Roan tried to stand up.Then.Boom.The body rose as if it was flicking and then fell forward.\u201cTroop commander!\u201dThe soldiers supported ROan with surprised looks.Roan had a confused expression.\u2018My body feels light.\u2019It wasn\u2019t that he was full of vitality.A feeling that his muscles and strength got amazingly better.Roan stood up with the help of the soldiers.\u201cAre you really okay?\u201dAustin asked carefully.Roan nodded and moved his body everywhere.\u2018This feels just like I got born again.\u2019A feeling like he just took off a heavy armour.Roan realized what kind of situation he was in.\u2018As the mana overflowed, the wastes in my body got out, and the muscles and bones got stronger.\u2019He had vaguely heard that there were cases like that when the understanding of the technique deepened.But of course, in Roan\u2019s case it wasn\u2019t that his understanding deepened but it was because of the overflowing.\u2018Is it a blessing from a misfortune.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and moved.As he got a hold of himself, what he had to do now was taking care of Aaron.And fortunately, as Aaron was lying flat on the ground, he didn\u2019t receive any injuries at Roan\u2019s explosion.\u201cCorps commander.\u201dRoan carefully shook Aaron and woke him up.\u201cMmm.\u201dA shallow groan came out of his mouth.Aaron\u2019s eyes shook.He frowned and then slowly opened his eyes.Soon, the soldiers that survived gathered around him.\u201cMmm. It\u2019s Roan.\u201dA weak voice.Aaron flinched his shoulders as if he was trying to raise his upper body.Roan extended his two hands and received him.\u201cThank you.\u201dAaron smiled bitterly and raised his upper body.Only then could he see the scenery.The burnt plain and the black smoke.The corpses that were scattered at the surroundings.\u2018Right. We fell on the trap of the Istel bastards.\u2019Aaron frowned.His head hurt as if it would split.The chasing army composed by the 6th and 7th corps quickly chased down the main army of Istel.Although Aaron actually didn\u2019t like the idea of chasing, as it was an order of Benjamin he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.Only, as the war has ended in their victory, he would just pretend to chase them.However.\u2018The rearguard army we actually faced wasn\u2019t really that much.\u2019They suffered defeat and retreated consecutively.\u2018I felt that something was fishy\u2026\u2026..\u2019Even before that, it was the rearguard that has given a big blow to the eastern army through perfect traps, surprise attacks and ambushes.But for that kind of rearguard to suffer consecutive defeats without any reasons was quite a suspicious situation.Aaron wanted to stop the chase by then.However, the thought of the commander of the 6th corps was different.He rather brought up the morale and went off to the chase to annihilate them perfectly.In the end Aaron hid his fishy feeling and could only chase his back.\u2018In that situation, the 6th corps that were in front fell in an ambush\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Aaron and the 7th corps could only charge forward to rescue them.\u2018And in the end, we fell in a trap.\u2019Aaron clenched his fists.\u2018The 6th corps commander died as soon as he fell on the trap.\u2019He felt bitter.Because of a useless commander, several soldiers lost their lives.He took in a deep breath and looked at Roan.\u201cRoan. What happened with the other commanders that were with me?\u201dHe had plentifully guessed what could have happened.But he could only ask just in case.Roan took in a breath and then replied in a calm voice.\u201cThey have all died.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of Aaron\u2019s mouth.The moment they got trapped in the grand shield, Gale, Mendel, the troop commanders and the adjutants ran towards him.They covered him without any empty spaces from the fire.The last words Gale left him rang in his head.Aaron shook his head.\u201cRight. So they have all died\u2026..\u201dHis voice was wet.Something hot surged on his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m the only one alive. This useless piece of body got alive\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWords as if he was rebuking himself.Roan and the others couldn\u2019t say anything while having their heads lowered.\u201cWhew.\u201dAaron let out a long sigh and started to shed hot tears.But those weren\u2019t tears shed by a corps commander.They were tears shed by a fellow comrade.\u201cI lost good allies, excellent friends.\u201dAaron raised his head and looked at Roan and the soldiers.\u201cWe are gathering the corpses of the fellow soldiers. We won\u2019t live this place until it gets perfectly gathered.\u201dThe chase was meaningless now.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dRoan and the others replied in a hot voice.They slowly got up and moved.It was to gather the corpses of their comrades prudently.Roan first supported Aaron.As his body still wasn\u2019t normal, he needed some rest.The sound of a horn trumpet was heard at the side of the gorge.Puuuuuuu!Roan stopped his feet and looked towards the gorge.At that moment, a displeased look appeared in his face.\u2018Benjamin.\u2019The ones that appeared with the horn trumpet was the main army of the eastern territory.They slowly crossed over the plains and then fell after they got on their formations.After a while, they split to the sides and Benjamin appeared with several corps commanders.\u201cCommander Tate.\u201dBenjam\u00edn rode his horse and slowly approached.His expression was quite stifled.Happiness, anger, and annoyance.There were all of those emotions in his expression.\u201cJust what is this look?\u201dA reprimanding sound.\u2018They fell in the trap just like I thought.\u2019Benjamin yelled for delight.\u2018I have to ask his responsibility.\u2019He was planning to cut off the accumulated merits of the 7th corps.Aaron fixed his posture and bowed deeply.\u201cWhile we were chasing the army of Istel, the 6th corps fell in the trap set up by the enem\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to there.\u201cStop! Are you accusing the 6th corps right now! Who did I get the commanding right to?\u201dAt the rebuking sound, Aaron hesitated and then replied.\u201cMe.\u201d\u201cRight. I gave the commanding rights to Aaron Tate of the 7th corps and not to the 6th corps. Then, whose fault is it that the 6th corps fell in a trap and your troop suffered a blow close to annihilation?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026..\u201dAaron couldn\u2019t reply.Looking at it this way, it was his fault as he was leading the chasing troop.However.\u2018The commander of the 6th corps didn\u2019t listen to my order.\u2019The one that didn\u2019t obey the orders was the commander of the 6th corps.Because of that, even the 7th corps suffered a blow close to annihilation.As Aaron couldn\u2019t reply, Benjamin asked in a voice that had mockery mixed in it.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you speak? WHose fault is it?\u201dIn the end, Aaron replied in a suffering voice.\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t endure it and shook his head.Roan, that was observing at the sides, clenched his fists tightly.\u2018Benjamin!\u2019He knew that he was a selfish and powerless bastard.And even knew that he didn\u2019t like the 7th corps.But he didn\u2019t know that he would step out this obstinately.His entire body trembled.Then, Aaron grabbed Roan\u2019s hand.\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019Eyes implying that.Roan forcefully breathed in and calmed down his emotions.\u201cOn top of that, what\u2019s this situation?\u201dBenjamin pointed at the plains.The soldiers gathering the corpses of the allies.Aaron replied in a calm voice.\u201cWe are gathering the corpses of the comrades that died in this battle.\u201d\u201cCorpse gathering? Tch!\u201dBenjamin frowned and clicked his tongue.He was planning to keep pushing Aaron to a corner.\u201cI think I certainly laid the order to chase the enemy army and annihilate them?\u201d\u201cHowever, our losses were quite severe, and I judged as keeping the chase was meaningle\u2026..\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dBenjamin shouted.A stiff expression.His voice lowered down coldly.\u201cJudge? The judging is done by me and not you. You just have to follow my orders!\u201dAaron clenched his fists.He wanted to talk back immediately, but he couldn\u2019t do so.They were still at war, and the place they were standing at was a battlefield.Not obeying to the orders meant that you were committing a sin that could lead to punishments according to the situation.\u2018Come on. Come with all the excuses and bark at me.\u2019Benjamin opened his eyes thinly and glared at Aaron.He waited for Aaron to talk back.\u2018I will confine you immediately.\u2019It was a tactic to make him be able to set a certain punishment perfectly.However, Aaron endured it better than he thought.Benjamin smacked his lips and sent another order.\u201cStop the gathering of the corpses immediately and chase the enemy army.\u201d\u201cCommander.\u201dAaron looked at Benjamin fixedly.Eyes implying to change the order.However there were no changes in Benjamin\u2019s thoughts.\u201cTch. We can\u2019t waste time for the ones that died stupidly.\u201dHe looked at Aaron fixedly and continued saying.\u201cAre you maybe not able to follow my orders?\u201dA perfect threat.But funnily, his expression and eyes was filled with a feeling for him not to follow his orders.\u2018Benjamin\u2026\u2026\u2019Aaron ground his teeth.If he only wasn\u2019t a corps commander, he would already have charged into Benjamin.However.\u2018If I do that here, I also put my underlings in a bad situation.\u2019If it was Benjamin, he was someone that wouldn\u2019t be enough with that.In the end Aaron chose to bow.\u201cYes. I will follow your\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen he talked up to there.Roan, that was looking at the situation by the sides, took one step forward.\u201cCommander.\u201dFierce eyes and a cold voice.Roan looked at Benjamin\u2019s two eyes fixedly.\u201cWe can\u2019t follow that order.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will have to get rid of this thorn first.\u2019He knew that most of the merits done by the 7th corps were thanks to Roan.\u2018If I can\u2019t have him, it will be better to break him.\u2019He opened his two eyes abruptly and put on a threatening expression.However, Roan was quite calm and composed.\u201cI can\u2019t follow your orders on chasing the enemy\u2019s army.\u201dA look without getting dispersed.He continued saying with a calm voice.\u201cOur chasing troop suffered a blow close to annihilation. On top of that, we are already near enemy\u2019s boundary. If we chase them now, it\u2019s difficult to give them a big blow.\u201dIt was quite a reasonable and appropriate words.Aaron and some commanders nodded and then looked at Benjamin and cleared their throats.\u201cThi, thi, this\u2026\u2026.\u201dBenjamin\u2019s face became red.Roan stared at Benjamin for a moment and then turned to look at the 7th corps.And naturally, the sight of everyone followed Roan\u2019s.\u201cMmm.\u201dSome commanders and staff officers exclaimed.The 7th corps wasn\u2019t in their normal state.They were barely alive but the soldiers that suffered severe injuries, the suffering soldiers that were looking at their deceased comrades, soldiers screaming for having their limbs cut off, etc.Roan looked at the soldiers and got a firm resolution.\u2018I will at least save them.\u2019He turned to look at Benjamin again.\u201cThere\u2019s no commander that lays an order to a corps that\u2019s close to annihilation to keep chasing. Lay down your order.\u201dAn earnest voice.Some soldiers started to tremble.\u2018If I make a mistake, the atmosphere will change.\u2019Benjamin felt urgent.He opened his eyes abruptly and yelled.\u201cYou! You dare to disobey the orders of a superior!\u201dThe atmosphere turned serious.Roan clenched his fists.He felt so stifled as if there was a rock in his chest.The fire essence in his mana hole twitched and roamed in his body.Roan looked at Benjamin fixedly.\u201cCommander. It\u2019s not disobeying.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dBenjamin yelled with a red face.In the end, even Roan couldn\u2019t hold it anymore.\u201cCommander!\u201dA voice that shakes the mountain.The mana that was inside his body exploded outside his body through his voice.An amazing spirit emanated with Roan at the center.Hiiiiiiiing!The war horses burbled and the commanders and soldiers put surprised expressions.\u201cThi, what is\u2026..\u201dBenjamin even staggered because he got really surprised.\u2018This bastard even knew how to use mana?\u2019His face turned pale and his eyes trembled.Roan looked at that Benjamin fixedly and slowly moved his feet.Gulp.Everyone gulped dry saliva and looked at that scene.Roan stood in front of Benjamin and continued saying in a calm voice.\u201cLay down a proper order. The war has ended. Commander.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSilence fell in an instant.I silence that clogged your breath.Even when there were tens of thousands of soldiers, you couldn\u2019t even hear a breath.\u2018Da, damn it!\u2019Benjamin got a hold of himself late.\u2018I\u2019m the commander of the eastern region! I\u2019m the superior in the eastern region!\u2019He looked at Roan fixedly.\u201cImpudent bastard!\u201dHe barely managed to yell.\u201cAll the judgements and decisions are done by me. You just have to follow my orders!\u201dHe continued saying.\u201cThe 7th corps will continue to chase the enemy\u2019s army. That\u2019s my decision and order.\u201dBenjamin didn\u2019t back down.Roan shook his head.\u201cCommander. Can you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dBenjamin yelled with all his strength.In the first place, he didn\u2019t think of holding a normal conversation.\u2018Benjamin\u2026\u2026.\u2019Roan ground his teeth.\u2018My past life also got messed up because of you.\u2019But even this life was getting messed up by him.He wanted to kick him in the chin once.But he couldn\u2019t.He was a noble with the title of viscount and the commander representing the eastern region.He wasn\u2019t someone a normal person, and a mere troop commander at that, could do something.\u2018If I face him, I may get imprisoned or get exiled, to say nothing of becoming a monarch.\u2019Because of that, he endured the nonsense orders and kept enduring.\u201cHmph! If you continue not wanting to follow my orders\u2026.\u201dBenjamin snorted lightly and shook his right hand.5 staff officers that were behind him came running quickly.They were the closest people Benjamin had and they all knew how to use mana.\u201cArrest Roan and detain him in the rear of the camp. When the war ends, I will clearly name your sins and lay down a punishment.\u201dThe order has been laid down.Benjamin planned to overthrow the thorn like Roan in this opportunity.\u2018Next is Aaron.\u2019His forehead got carved.\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe officers replied in one voice and moved.Then.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201dThe soldiers of the 2nd rose troop that were behind Roan blocked them.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dBenjamin, Roan and even Roan had surprised expressions.Austin, that was at the forefront of the soldiers, looked at Benjamin fixedly.\u201cYou can\u2019t take away troop commander Roan!\u201dFollowed by him, the other soldiers added.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an unfair treatment!\u201dRoan raised up the clearest merits in the war against Istel kingdom, and more than anyone else.On top of that, disobeying Benjamin\u2019s order this time was because that order was just too unreasonable.As the soldiers of the 2nd rose troop saw it, Roan didn\u2019t make any mistakes.\u2018He may be jealous of troop commander\u2019s merits!\u2019\u2018Benjamin Doyle is originally this kind of person!\u2019The soldiers clenched their fists.Resolution, they wouldn\u2019t step back at all, was felt.\u2018If troop commander Roan gets imprisoned\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u2018Doyle commander will lay down an unreasonable punishment.\u2019In the first place, it was important to prevent him from incarcerating Roan.Austin bent towards Benjamin.\u201cTroop commander Roan has raised outstanding merits in several battles. Take that into account.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dBenjamin immediately snorted.\u201cImpudent things. It\u2019s not a problem mere soldiers can butt in!\u201dHe looked at Roan and the soldiers alternatingly and shook his head.\u201cThat commander and his underlings. Tch tch tch.\u201dThe sound of clicking his tongue was heard clearly.Roan looked at the soldiers blocking his front.\u201cYou fall back.\u201dAt those words, the soldiers shook their heads.\u201cWe can\u2019t do that. We will stay next to you until the very end.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t send you off like this!\u201dThe tension rose up.Then, Benjamin\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWhat are you doing! Are you just going to watch!\u201dAt those words, the officers that were standing confused started to move again.\u201cNo, no!\u201dAustin and the soldiers blocked them once again.\u201cFuck off!\u201dThe officers didn\u2019t endure it anymore.The officer that was standing at the front swung his fist towards Austin.And it even had mana behind it.\u201cKugh!\u201dAustin ground his teeth when he looked at the fist swinging at him.Then.Tuk!One hand appeared abruptly and lightly blocked the flying fist.\u201cUgh.\u201dThe staff that swung the fist ground his teeth.But the fist didn\u2019t move an inch.\u201cA fist that has mana behind it for a normal soldier. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s too much?\u201dThe person that blocked the officer\u2019s fist.He was none other than Roan.\u2018Wh, what kind of strength is this\u2026\u2026\u2019The officer got perplexed.Roan pulled up mana and put strength in his hand.Uduk.The tips of the fingers carved in the fist of the officer.\u201cUhhhhhhhhh.\u201dThe officer groaned with a painful expression.\u201cThis son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201dThe other officers yelled and approached.They suddenly swung their fists.Fists that also had mana behind it.\u2018In the end it turns out like this.\u2019Roan let out a short sight and slightly fell back.At the same time, the fist of the officer he was holding in got pulled in to his chest.\u201cHuh?!\u201dThe guy that loses balance and gets pulled forward.The fists and kicks of the other officers fell on his body.Pubuk! Puk!\u201cKugh!\u201dA heavy hitting sound was heard with the groan.Roan let go of the fist as if he threw it and charged forward.\u201cUh?!\u201d\u201cHup!When the four officers got surprised and fell backwards.Pabat!Roan\u2019s two fists split the air.The attack was so fast you could only see the remnants of it.Pububuk! Puk!The fists landed on their faces and stomachs.\u201cGrr.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t even fight back once and collapsed.Roan raised his head to look at Benjamin.Casual eyes.Benjamin trembled unconsciously.\u2018Dman. I, I am afraid!?\u2019Humiliation surged up.Then, Roan lightly kicked.Pubuk!The officers that were kneeling down on the ground got hit on their chins and fell like that.A perfectly passed out look.Roan let out a long sigh.He wanted to endure it until the end.There were plenty of methods to get out even if he got imprisoned.In the worst of the cases, he was even thinking of leaving the army.\u2018But I can\u2019t endure looking my troop members suffering at all.\u2019He couldn\u2019t stand watching his subordinates getting hit because of something personal.Roan looked at Benjamin fixedly.\u201cI will go to the rear of the camp as you wish. Instead, spare the fault of my troop members.\u201dBenjamin just blinked at the sudden situation.\u201cRoan!\u201d\u201cTroop commander!\u201dAaron and the troop members yelled with a surprised expression.However, ROan\u2019s expression was still calm.\u2018There are plenty of methods to pull down that bastard to the bottom.\u2019Even if he didn\u2019t do so, he was gathering several information through Chris\u2019s agency.But for now protecting his troop members came first.Then, Aaron butted in.\u201cNo, if it\u2019s responsibility we are talking about, I the corps commander\u2026..\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t continue speaking.\u201cCommander.\u201dRoan interrupted him and whispered in his ear with a really low voice.\u201cAre you going to make the deaths of the several troop commanders and adjutants to become useless? You should remain here and lead the soldiers.\u201d\u201cRoan\u2026..\u201dThe end of Aaron\u2019s words dimmed.Why won\u2019t he understand Roan\u2019s words?\u201cIf you start chasing, don\u2019t chase them hurriedly but only pretend to do so.\u201dRoan smiled faintly and then looked at Austin and the soldiers.\u201cYou too, fall back.\u201d\u201cTroop commander\u2026\u2026\u201dThe troop members all clenched their fists and trembled.Expressions they couldn\u2019t endure it because they were angry and felt it unfair.Roan and the troop members exchanged gazes.\u2018Everyone, don\u2019t worry.\u2019Roan was confident.He wanted to dig a deeper hole and lead Benjamin over there.\u2018I will bury you so deep you won\u2019t be able to get out.\u2019Backing down once for the future.Roan raised his head and looked at Benjamin.Benjamin just smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.\u2018It would have been good if I also got Aaron mixed up in it\u2026\u2026\u2019The opportunity just now was regretful.He looked at Roan and nodded.\u201cGood. I will do as you wish.\u201dThere was no need to imprison or arrest a normal soldier.He only needed Aaron and Roan.Right before he finished speaking, some soldiers approached.Roan saluted shortly towards Aaron.\u201cI will see you later.\u201d\u201cI have no honor.\u201dAaron lowered his face.Roan forced a smile and walked.The soldiers of the 2nd rose troop looked at him with stifled expressions.Then, Benjamin\u2019s voice was heard.He looked at the surrounding battlefield and let out a sigh.\u201cWhew. Anyways, this is really a mess. They got charred black. Tch tch tch.\u201dBenjamin clicked his tongue in a big way and continued saying.\u201cThis is what they call a dog death. Because you only do what you are ordered to without thinking ahead, you die in such a way. If you are a person you have to know to think by yourself and lay your own judgements. Tch.\u201dHe spitted out and sent down an order towards the officers.\u201cTake care of the corpses roughly. We lack time to gather them all and\u2026.\u201dA fishy smile appeared on his face.\u201cThey aren\u2019t worth it.\u201dA voice filled with mockery.At that moment, Aaron\u2019s and the soldier\u2019s expressions stiffened.Their entire body trembled.They wanted to cleanly pour over curses.\u2018If we make a fuss over here, Roan\u2019s look will become funny.\u2019\u2018Troop commander Roan chose to get imprisoned for us. We have to endure it.\u2019Aaron and the soldiers clenched their fists.They gulped down the surging rage for of Roan.Then.Paat!Something appeared in front of Benjamin.\u201cHuh?!\u201dEveryone opened their eyes roundly and put surprised expressions.But of course, the most surprised one was Benjamin.\u201cKuk!\u201dA feeling his breath got cut off.He looked at the guy that was grabbing his throat.\u201cRo, kugh. Ro, Roa. Just what is\u2026\u2026\u2026.Kugh.\u201dIt was difficult to even speak.\u201cCo, commander!\u201d\u201cYou crazy bastard!\u201dThe surrounding officers and commanders opened their eyes abruptly and approached.Roan grabbed Travias spear with his left hand while still grabbing on Benjamin\u2019s throat with his right hand.CHeng!The hidden blade of the spear showed itself.At the same time.Swush.The spear became longer and then got stuck in front of the feet of the officers and commanders that were approaching.Puk!The ground was dug and rocks scattered with a loud sound.Roan said in a cold voice while not even looking at them.\u201cUntil there. The moment you cross that I will take Benjamin Doyle\u2019s life.\u201d\u201cKughhhh.\u201dBenjamin struggled as if the strength behind the grip was painful.At that look, the officers and commanders couldn\u2019t approach anymore and fell back.Roan looked at Benjamin\u2019s eyes properly.\u201cBenjamin.\u201dThere were no honorifics anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you lay an unreasonable order. And it\u2019s fine if you badmouth me. I can endure everything else. But\u2026\u2026.\u201d His voice lowered.\u201cI can\u2019t endure you mocking the deaths of my deceased comrades at all.\u201dRoan ground his teeth.He tried to endure it but in the end, he couldn\u2019t.\u2018I can\u2019t turn back anymore.\u2019He took in a deep breath.\u2018Now that I started it, let\u2019s pull the roots.\u2019He got resolved.\u2018I was wondering whether I had to stay on the 7th corps after the war ends or leave\u2026\u2026..\u2019Thanks to Benjamin, he could stop doing so.\u2018Let\u2019s leave. I\u2019m leaving after I clear things up cleanly.\u2019Roan inserted mana in his fists.A look that he would send his chin flying at any moment.Then.Sounds of the jing, drums and horn trumpets was heard far away from the gorge.Roan saw through the smoke and looked towards the entrance.He could see a huge flag with a flashy symbol.The symbol in the flag was familiar.He let out a long sigh.He smacked his lips and a really low voice flowed out.\u201cCount Lancephil\u2026\u2026\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!This chapter and the previous one was completely sponsored by J.G. once again!

Le, let this go. Kugh.\u201dBenjamin smiled fishily and rolled his eyes.\u2018However angry you may be, you won\u2019t be able to do anything to me.\u2019He was a noble and a supreme commander at that.On top of that, even count Lancephil showed himself.At the slip, this problem could become bigger.\u201cKugh. Can\u2019t you let this go!\u201dThe tension turned up.But Roan just looked at that Benjamin fixedly.\u201cDo you think I won\u2019t be able to hit you?\u201dHe put more strength in his grip.\u201cKugh.\u201dHis breath got cut off.\u2018Actually, it is something unreasonable.\u2019Roan put on a bitter smile.This was an exhibition.Resorting to violence to a superior, and a noble at that was something unimaginable.It was a sin that could get you executed at the spot.But regardless of that, Roan wasn\u2019t planning on leaving Benjamin like that.\u2018It\u2019s been revealed that I am learning mana.\u2019There was no way that they would execute a soldier that knew how to use mana.Someone at the level of a knight was quite important even at the center of the kingdom.He may receive some punishment, but he would be safe from execution.On top of that, if Roan only evaded the execution, he had plenty of ways to deal with the following problems.\u2018And also, it\u2019s already spilled water.\u2019Grabbing the throat of a superior was already a big thing.And it wouldn\u2019t change if he hit him some times right now.\u2018Now that I started, I have to clearly end it.\u2019He did his best on what he already started.That was Roan\u2019s temperament.Because of that, he could remain as an ordinary spearman from an army for 20 years.Udk.Strength was put behind the fist.Benjamin opened his eyes roundly.\u2018Thi, this bastard. Really?\u2019When he thought up to that point.Roan\u2019s fist split the air.Pagak!\u201cKuk!\u201dBenjamin\u2019s nose sat down with a dull sound.\u201cThi, this crazy bastard!\u201dThe surrounding corps commanders and staff officers approached with surprised expressions.Roan didn\u2019t even look at them and swung Travias spear.Puk!The spear got stuck ahead of them.\u201cI told you. That if you get any closer, I will snap Benjamin\u2019s neck.\u201d\u201cKugh.\u201dThe commanders and officers couldn\u2019t approach anymore.They didn\u2019t know what to do and just looked at Benjamin\u2019s face.A face covered with blood.\u201cUhhhh.\u201dBenjamin gritted his teeth and trembled.He didn\u2019t know that Roan would actually hit him.\u201cSo, son of a bitch. Do you think you will be safe aft\u2026..\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t continue speaking.Because Roan swung his fist once again.Puk! Pubuk! Puk!Roan punched Benjamin\u2019s face with a casual expression.His teeth broke and his nose completely broke.His eyelids and forehead teared up.\u201cUoooooo.\u201dBenjamin was not himself.He tried to dodge Roan\u2019s fists but it was useless.But because Roan increased Flamdor mana technique to the peak, he couldn\u2019t move his body as he wished.But even so, it wasn\u2019t that Benjamin didn\u2019t use mana.\u2018Ho, how is he this strong!\u2019Despair appeared in his face.\u201cKuhok.\u201dBenjamin breathed in deeply.It was difficult to breath because of his broken nose.\u2018Please, someone stop this bastard.\u2019An earnest look.But there was no one that stopped him.In the end, a regrettable sound came out of Benjamin\u2019s mouth.\u201cKugh. Ple, please sto, stop\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Roan didn\u2019t stop hitting him.\u2018This isn\u2019t simply revenge for what just happened.\u2019His eyes became fierce.\u2018My past life. Revenge for having ruined it.\u2019Pubuk!Consecutive punches landed on his face.\u201cKugh! Kugh!\u201dBenjamin now even shed tears.\u201cPl, please. Please stop\u2026..\u201dHe had thrown away his dignity and pride.Fear of not knowing if he may lose if life if he kept getting hit paralyzed his rationality.\u201cSob. Sob. Sob.\u201dThe sorrowful crying sound rang in the plain.But Roan just ignored it.When he raised his fist once again.\u201cWhat is happening right now!\u201dA yell hit his ear.Roan turned his head while still grabbing on Benjamin\u2019s throat.\u2018Count Lancephil.\u2019The one that had yelled was Io.However, Io\u2019s sight moved behind Io.\u2018Pens.\u2019Pens, that had separated with him after the thing with the fake storage, was standing over there.\u2018Maybe, already?\u2019Roan had a surprised expression.Pens looked at that Roan and slightly winked.A look that was smiling faintly and even nodding.Roan let out a short sigh.\u2018It seems like it was done faster than what I thought.\u2019A smile appeared in his face.Only then did Roan loosen the hand that was choking Benjamin.Tuk.Benjamin fell as if he collapsed and buried his face on the ground.\u201cHuok. Huok. Huok.\u201dHe breathed in coarsely and poured out tears.Roan just looked at that Benjamin and wiped off the blood in his face.Meanwhile, Io walked and stood in front of Roan.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dA blunt voice and expression.Roan just bowed instead of replying.\u201cSi, sir count. What just happened\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen Roan stepped in and tried to explain the situation.\u201cSob. Count Lancephil.\u201dBenjamin stood up.\u201cMm.\u201dIo looked at Benjamin\u2019s face and let out a low exclamation.\u2018He\u2019s completely broken.\u2019He didn\u2019t have even a fine place.Benjamin yelled out.\u201cCount Lancephil! A mere commoner troop commander bastard has insulted me! On top of that, even the soldiers of the 7th corps have disobeyed my orders and rebelled!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t himself.Io frowned and looked at Roan.Then, Aaron walked to the front and bowed.\u201cSir count. Actually\u2026\u2026\u201dThe explanation happened for a while.He explained everything that happened slowly.As Io was here anyways, he didn\u2019t need to be wary of Benjamin.\u201cMm.\u201dBenjamin, that heard everything, glared at Benjamin.\u2018Benjamin. You stupid bastard spilled the plate because of greed of merits.\u2019He could know why there were this many allied corpses even when they had won the war.\u2018On top of that, to badmouth the fallen comrades\u2026\u2026..Trash like bastard.\u2019Io clicked his tongue with a displeased expression.As he was originally a soldier that roamed the battlefield, he thought of comrades and allies quite importantly.Because of that, Benjamin\u2019s doings made him really angry.Benjamin, that didn\u2019t know how Io was feeling, said nonsense.\u201cChasing a retreating enemy army is a basic thing in strategy. The 7th corps commander didn\u2019t have the abilities and is just putting up excuses. On top of that, it\u2019s not that the corpses are going to disappear, so we can do it after we chase them\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to there.\u201cShut up!\u201dIo couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and yelled.\u201cYe, yes?\u201dBenjamin staggered with a surprised expression.Io looked at Benjamin\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cBecause of your useless pride and your greed on merits, more than 10.000 soldiers lost their lives. It\u2019s not enough with apologizing while bowing but you even badmouth them? Trash like bastard.\u201dA cold voice.\u201cCo, count Lancephil. I, it\u2019s not that I\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly then did Benjamin get a hold of himself.He had realized what kind of person Io was late.But even if it was late, it was just too late.\u201cBenjamin Doyle.\u201dIo glared at Benjamin scarily.As he made a handsign to his back, the leader of the knights Kali Owells approached.He took out a scroll from his chest.Swush.Io spread the scroll towards Benjamin.\u201cThis is a dismissal order for you.\u201dAt that moment, Benjamin, Aaron, Roan and the soldiers of the eastern army put surprised expression.\u201cJu, just what is\u2026\u2026\u201dBenjamin received the paper with trembling hands.It was clearly a dismissal order from his seat of the eastern region commander.\u201cJust why\u2026\u2026.?\u201dBenjamin looked at Io.Io\u2019s expression was fierce.\u201cSetting up a formation at the rear Nerf region, instead of Bink region when Istel kingdom first started attacking. Battling against the enemy army more than 20 times and not being able to win. Cutting off assistance to the commanders that were patrolling while searching the eastern region to annihilate the enemy.\u201dThe more he talked, the more Benjamin\u2019s face turned white.He kind of knew that Io was reporting the merits situation of the eastern region and the 7th corps to the royal palace.However, he didn\u2019t know that he would have grasped all these things this accurately.\u2018Count Lancephil wouldn\u2019t have had any mid because he was defending the eastern region. How\u2026\u2026?\u2019It felt like someone had organized the information and gave it to him.\u2018Ah!\u2019At that moment, Benjamin turned his head and looked at Roan.\u2018Maybe, this bastard?\u2019The information squad Roan set up.If it was them, they would be able to urgently take care of the information of the eastern region.Roan\u2019s and Benjamin\u2019s sights interlocked.Roan smiled just as if he read Benjamin\u2019s thoughts.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dBenjamin let out a low exclamation.\u2018It was that bastard.\u2019The puzzle fitted.It wasn\u2019t enough with annihilated the enemy army entering the eastern region and attacking the supply storage, but he even utilized the information troop and was perfectly grasping the situation of the eastern army.\u2018Scary bastard.\u2019Roan was more amazing and scary than what he had thought.Just like Benjamin thought, the one that reported the situation of the eastern army ro Io was Roan.With Io\u2019s temperament, it was obvious that if he got to know Benjamin\u2019s failures he wouldn\u2019t sit still.Roan judged as Io would certainly report it to the royal palace.\u2018It would have been difficult if this bastard still remained as the supreme commander even after this war ended.\u2019Roan glared at Benjamin with calm eyes.\u2018Although the order came faster than what I thought\u2026\u2026\u2019The reason why he was glad to see Pens appearing with Io was precisely because of this.Benjamin wasn\u2019t his superior anymore.Things were untying better than thought.Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cAlthough the orders of the royal palace was to chase you off the army and dismiss you from your seat\u2026..\u201dHe ground his teeth.\u201cI\u2019m not planning to end it with just that. It wasn\u2019t enough to lay an unreasonable order to the chasing troop and suffer an amazing blow, but you even badmouth the deceased allies.\u201dIo made a hand sign to his back.Two knights approached and grabbed Benjamin\u2019s shoulders.I will carefully investigate and grasp your actions and behaviours and ask you your sin. Imprison him at the rear of the camp.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe knights replied in one voice and then moved away.\u201cCou, count Lancephil! I, I feel it to be unfair! I just did my best for Rinse kingdom!\u201dBenjamin got dragged and yelled.However Io didn\u2019t even look at him.And that was the same for the other corps commanders and staff officers.They didn\u2019t need to be wary of Benjamin or flatter him.Because Benjamin wasn\u2019t his superior anymore.No, from now on, it would be better to take some distance.If they made a mistake, they could get the same punishment as Benjamin.\u201cRoan.\u201dAt Io\u2019s call, Roan bowed once again.\u201cYes. Count Lancephil.\u201dRoan was composed even after making Benjamin\u2019s face to become a bloody one.Io let out a long sigh with stifled eyes.\u2018What to do\u2026\u2026\u2019He personally wanted to applaud him at his actions.But military laws were laws.If he let one thing pass, the discipline could crumble.\u201cI know what you were thinking when you did that. However\u2026..\u201dIo let out a short sigh and continued speaking.\u201cResorting to violence against a noble is a sin. I will ask you your sin after this.\u201dWhat was fortunate was that the dismissal order came ahead of this, so the sin of resorting to violence against a superior wasn\u2019t implied.\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dRoan replied with a composed expression.Aaron wanted to step up and tried to defend him, but Io closed his eyes and shook his head.It meant not to step in.\u2018There\u2019s nothing good by arguing in an open place.\u2019Aaron understood Io\u2019s meaning and shut his mouth.Two knights approached and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.Then, Roan that was silent carefully opened his mouth.\u201cCount Lancephil.\u201dIo just looked at him as if implying what happened.Roan hesitated for a moment and then bowed.\u201cI want to retrieve the corpses of my comrades.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dIo gulped in the silence.\u2018Even if he\u2019s different to Benjamin, he\u2019s just too much.\u2019Even the size of the plate was different.The one that suited the position of supreme commander was Roan, and not Benjamin.Io pondered for a moment and then nodded.\u201cFine. Only, I will imprison you at the rear of the camp after the retrieving ends.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dRoan bowed and then moved.He carefully retrieved the corpses of the burnt soldiers.Io looked at that and let out a long sigh.\u2018What to do\u2026\u2026..\u2019He felt stifled.The deeper he thought, the pondering also deepened.*****The retrieval of the corpses was done quickly.And Roan got imprisoned just like the order.\u201cCount Lancephil. Although Roan did something wrong, that\u2019s all because of Benjamin Doyle. Take that into account please.\u201dAaron earnestly defended Roan.Io touched his chin and fell in his thougts.\u2018The reason we could win this war was because of Roan. That\u2019s an irrefutable truth.\u2019Roan made a merit bigger than anymore.If only this didn\u2019t happen, he could even get promoted to corps commander.\u2018On top of that, Roan\u2019s ability is too precious to kill him like this.\u2019Io let out a long sigh once again.Aaron looked at that and couldn\u2019t open his mouth as he wished.Because he also knew how deeply Io was thinking.Then, Kali that was looking at the situation, said with a blunt voice.\u201cViolence against a noble is a sin. If you let this go, they will start talking at our backs even more.\u201dThose were right words.Aaron said with an urgent voice.\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we have to take into account Roan\u2019s merits?\u201dThose also were right words.\u201cThese aren\u2019t merits to just be ignorant of and cover them.\u201dHe fell in his thoughts once again.Kali shook his head.\u201cThen, how about exile him to a dangerous territory and exempt him from the capital punishment?\u201d\u201cExile?\u201dIo showed a reaction.Kali shrugged his shoulders and said.\u201cAs everyone says that his talent is too valuable, can\u2019t we send him to a fortress as a guard or as a slave?\u201dAaron got surprised and shook his hands.\u201cWe can\u2019t make Roan\u2019s talent rot in a place like that.\u201dAt those words, Kali replied with a blunt voice.\u201cLaws are more important than talent. Law. On top of that\u2026\u2026.\u201dKali looked at Aaron\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cIf we exempt him from his sins and he remains here, will the other commanders see in a good way? They may probably try to harm him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026..\u201dAaron couldn\u2019t speak anymore and shut his mouth.He didn\u2019t have the words to refute back.And even if he didn\u2019t get harmed, it was obvious that he may get really handicapped in the merits awards.Then, Io that was in his thoughts, showed a faint smile.\u201cI think that exile him will be good, just like commander Kali says.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAaron let out a low exclamation.He wanted to fight back that he couldn\u2019t do so, but he didn\u2019t have a solution or a reason to do so.Aaron bowed with a half absent minded expression.Then Io stood up and lightly patted Aaron\u2019s shoulders.A faint smile appeared in his mouth.\u201cCorps commander Tate.\u201dA gentle voice.Aaron raised his head and looked at Io.The smile in Io\u2019s face became even denser.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much.\u201dHe put more strength in his hands grabbing his shoulders.\u201cI thought of something good.\u201dEndTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 82 - A new opportunity (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82: A new opportunity (1)With the Istel kingdom\u2019s retreat, the Byron kingdom also started to get cornered down.Thanks to Roan\u2019s plan, in suffering consecutive defeats, they had entered quite a deep region into Rinse kingdom.And the supply line also became quite long.On top of this, the central region of Rinse kingdom also joined up.But a bigger problem than this exploded from the rear.The orcs that were half annihilated last spring, from the huge scaled subjugations, started to suddenly gather up and attacked the supply lines that were in the region.And even if they hadn\u2019t done that, it was a big blow for the Byron kingdom that was working really hard as the supply line enlarged.They could only hurry to retreat and in the meanwhile, they suffered a big blow.Unfortunately, there was no such existence like Peid of the Istel kingdom in the rear guard of the Byron kingdom.Actually, the orcs gathering and attacking the supply lines was all Roan\u2019s plan.Roan sent Chris to the southern region of the Byron kingdom and visited the small and large orc tribes.The orcs, who couldn\u2019t acquire any harvests properly because of the subjugation tactic, showed interest in the information of the supply lines Chris brought.And as they also entered a deep part of Rinse kingdom in this situation, the defenses became quite sloppy.The orcs, who were doubtful at first, saw that the situation was turning favorable and decided to attack the Byron kingdom\u2019s supply line just like Roan and Chris wanted them to.So for the Byron kingdom, they couldn\u2019t continue the war and fled as all these things happened.The only unfortunate thing was that Rinse kingdom wasn\u2019t aware that the attacks of the orcs were all devised by Roan and Chris.And it was because Chris was retreating while evading the Byron kingdom that he still couldn\u2019t send the notices about it.For Roan, committing the sin of violence against a noble was quite an unfortunate situation.If this merit was known, his punishment would have become a bit lighter.\u201cRoan.\u201d\u201cYes. Sir Count.\u201dRoan was kneeling while he was tied up with ropes.He looked like a sinner.Io looked at him with unfortunate eyes.Io let out a short sigh and said.\u201cViolence against a noble is a really big sin. It\u2019s a sin where the last resort of punishment could be applied.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t show any reactions.Io continued speaking.\u201cHowever, bringing victory in this fierce war is also another truth. We can\u2019t kill the hero of the kingdom.\u201dThe corps commanders that were assisting all took in a deep breath.Their expressions were that they couldn\u2019t guess at all how the situation would flow.Io touched his chin with his fingers.\u201cI, Io Lancephil, will lay down the punishment instead of the supreme commander of the eastern region.\u201dHis mouth raised up.\u201cI will demote troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop of the 7th corps to that of a normal soldier and exile him.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation came out of the mouths of the commanders.It was a fiercer punishment than what he had thought.As they originally knew that Io appreciated Roan, they had the suspicions that he would just let it pass.They just thought that the punishment would be a demotion and a cut of his salary.\u2018He\u2019s certainly Count Lancephil.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s someone that has it clearly differentiated.\u2019The commanders applauded at Io\u2019s fair decision.Like this, their shaken discipline would become firm.On the other side, Roan\u2019s expression was excessively calm.\u2018Exile\u2026\u2026..\u2019Actually, the punishment Roan thought of was getting sold as a slave.Compared to that, exile was quite the light punishment.\u2018Although I was just planning to flee in regards to whatever I became.\u2019Roan had many choices.This was something possible as he knew the future.\u2018The first was taking place here in the eastern region\u2026\u2026.\u2019If it was possible, he wanted to stay in Lancephil\u2019s territory.\u2018Because I thought that the big thing that would happen here was a big opportunity.\u2019There was a suitable opportunity to raise up a force.Six years from now on, a big disaster happens in Lancephil\u2019s territory.It was the day that all the territory fell into chaos.\u2018Then, an opportunity would certainly come.\u2019To grab that opportunity, he learned the Flamdor mana technique and returned once again to the eastern region.But now, it wasn\u2019t a situation where he could stay here anymore.\u2018The second is going to the Grain mountains.\u2019It was more difficult than the first one and complicated as well, but it still wasn\u2019t something bad.On top of that, as the Grain mountain ranges were quite steep, it was a region where patrolling was almost impossible if he dedicated to hide himself.\u2018It\u2019s the most suitable place for a castaway.\u2019Although the situation was certainly difficult, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have holes to escape.Roan calmly organized the thoughts in his head.Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThe place you will be exiled to is\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe dimmed his last words.Aaron and the other commanders looked at Io\u2019s mouth.Io took in a breath and said.\u201cIt\u2019s the region of Tale.\u201dAt that moment, the faces of several commanders contorted.On the other side, there was surprise on Aaron\u2019s face.On top of that, his mouth was slightly raised up.Io looked at Aaron and lightly smiled.Just like.\u2018I told you not to worry.\u2019He had a feeling that he was saying that.Roan, who was maintaining a calm expression, also had a surprised expression now.\u2018Tale?\u2019Laughs kept coming out.The countless plans in his head all crumbled.\u2018If it\u2019s Tale\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018I won\u2019t have to go to the Grain mountains.\u2019The need to become a castaway and suffer the dangers had disappeared.The region of Tale.It certainly was a region where monsters appeared frequently and was left behind.But the reason a smile appeared on Roan\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s mouth.That was because the region of Tale was located inside Lancephil\u2019s territory.*****The region of Tale.It was a dangerous region located in the southeast of Lancephil\u2019s territory.It was close to Poskein lake and was surrounded by big and small mountains.Different from the other regions, the soil wasn\u2019t that good and as monsters frequented there a lot, there weren\u2019t as many people living there.It was one of the several exiling places that even the Lancephil family didn\u2019t want to get involved with.Most of the commander agreed that they should send him to an exiling ground to the west or the south instead of the region of Tale.However Io wasn\u2019t planning to back down anymore.He was sending Roan to a place where he could reveal his talent and accumulate merits.Several opinions came for the next four days.In the end, both sides took a step back.They decided that the soldiers of the 2nd troop should also be exiled along with Roan.\u2018I have to send Roan with the army he was together with. So they won\u2019t be able to think of nothing much when they come back.\u2019The commanders were excessively aware against Roan.Most of them got the position of corps commander by inheriting it.They were petty humans that were worried that their seats would be taken away.Roan and Aaron opposed their opinions but they couldn\u2019t go against the majority.In the end, everything gwas decided like this.Roan was exiled to the region of Tale and the soldiers of 2nd rose troop would be following him.Meanwhile, Benjamin\u2019s powerlessness was revealed and he was taken into custody in Miller.He tried to get some commanders by his side while expressing his unfairness.But the commanders weren\u2019t by his side anymore.No, they pushed back Benjamin more fiercely just in case they would also suffer because of him.In that situation, it was revealed that Benjamin laid down an unreasonable order to several corps of the region, including the 7th corps.Io sent his opinion paper to the royal palace that they should take away the title of nobility from Benjamin and that they should exile him.\u2018If my opinion is received, Roan using violence against a noble doesn\u2019t become that big of a problem.\u2019Aaron just hoped for the royal palace to make the right decisions.And the situation became organized like that quite quickly.The commanders all returned to their headquarters to organize the region.They started to leave one by one and the only ones that remained were Io and Aaron.\u201cCommander Tate. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\u201cYes. I will just believe in you.\u201dAaron bowed.He saw Roan, tied up in tight ropes, behind Io.\u2018It\u2019s a region located inside of the count\u2019s territory. If he takes care of him\u2026\u2026\u2019Rather, it could become an opportunity to reverse things.Io patted Aaron\u2019s shoulder and got up on his horse.Hiiiing.Lancephil\u2019s army started to move with the cry of the horse.Their territory was Pavor, the area that had the lord\u2019s castle.Aaron just looked at the march while standing at the entrance.\u201cRoan.\u201dRoan passed in front of his eyes.Roan faintly smiled and nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much.\u201dIt was a farewell like it was nothing.Aaron felt something in his chest and he ground his teeth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThese were words he hardly brought out.Roan just smiled faintly at that.The rope that was tied to the horse kept pulling him.Roan walked and in the meanwhile, saluted Aaron.He had a composed and calm look.Aaron was moved for nothing and turned his head.He didn\u2019t have the courage to look at Roan anymore.Then, his eyes turned round.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe saw a familiar group behind the march of the count.It was Austin and the soldiers of the 2nd rose troop.They had packed their things and were following the march.The soldiers bowed towards Aaron before leaving the camp.\u201cWe have decided to follow troop commander Roan.\u201dThese were Austin\u2019s words.The other soldiers all nodded with resolute expressions.\u201cAre you saying that you will follow him to that dangerous place?\u201d\u201cYes. We were chased out of the army anyways. We don\u2019t have anywhere to go anymore.\u201dAustin turned his head and looked at Roan\u2019s back getting farther away.\u201cThe troop commander became like that while protecting us.\u201dHe took in a deep breath.\u201cAs troop commander protected us, now we should be the ones protecting him.\u201dAt those words, Aaron slowly nodded.\u201cYou are better than me.\u201dPassionate gazes were exchanged.Austin and the others bowed once again and then started to move.Aaron looked at them and clenched his fist.\u201cEveryone, just wait a little bit for me.\u201dFlames appeared in a deep part inside of his eyes.\u201cI will certainly make you return to where you belong.\u201d*****The march stopped earlier than what was thought.As Io couldn\u2019t see the camp of the region, he stopped the march and went to Roan.\u201cLoosen his ropes.\u201dAt the short order, some soldiers gathered and cut off the ropes.Behind Io, Kali shook his head with a displeased expression.Io made a hand sign towards the soldiers of the 2nd rose troop who were looking at themselves at the back of the march.Austin and the others hesitated for a moment and then stood in a line behind Roan.\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason you followed us?\u201dAt those words Austin replied with a slightly nervous expression.\u201cWe decided to be together with troop commander Roan.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you are also following him to the place of exile?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dAustin replied without hesitation.Io smirked and shook his head.\u201cYou can\u2019t enter a place of exile if you aren\u2019t a sinner.\u201dAt those words, Austin and the soldiers hit their chests and said.\u201cThen make us one. Disobeying orders on the battlefield is also a sin.\u201d\u201cSend us to the place of exile too.\u201dHe replied in a voice that was as hot and earnest as his eyes.Roan looked at the expressions of the soldiers with a stifled expression.It was an expression that showed that he was both sorry and thankful.He couldn\u2019t say anything.Then, Io\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do so. I don\u2019t think of Roan as a sinner.\u201dHe faintly smiled and said.\u201cBecause the other commanders were watching and because of the army\u2019s discipline, I did say that he should get exiled but I don\u2019t think of Roan as a sinner. Rather, I think of him as an excellent commander.\u201dIo looked at the faces of Roan andthe soldiers alternately.\u201cI\u2019m planning to send Roan to a territory of a Lancephil\u2019s family territory. I\u2019m going to give him a small troop and make him subjugate the monsters in the region of Tale.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a simple exile.He was planning to entrust Roan with that region.Roan and the soldiers had surprised expressions.Io didn\u2019t mind and continued saying.\u201cRoan. Will you be able to do it?\u201dThe region of Tale was a place that even the family of Lancephil couldn\u2019t lay a hand on it as they wished. Making him subjugate that place was more dangerous and difficult than one could think.However Roan didn\u2019t hesitate.He bowed.\u201cYes. I\u2019m confident.\u201dAs soon as he said that, Austin and the soldiers laid down on the ground.\u201cSir count. Take us into your territory. We will subjugate the monsters in the region of Tale along with troop commander Roan.\u201d\u201cTake us into account.\u201dAt those words, Io faintly smiled and looked at Roan.\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201dAt the question, Roan copied the soldiers and laid down.\u201cI want to be together with them.\u201dHe spoke in an earnest voice.Silence lasted for a moment.Io slowly nodded.\u201cGood. I will take in all these soldiers.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of the mouths of Roan and the soldiers.A bright smile appeared on their faces.Contrary to that, there was displeasure on the face of Kali.\u2018How can he take such good care of him?\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand Io\u2019s treatment.But it seemed like Io didn\u2019t mind it at all.\u201cI will make a completely new troop for you.\u201dIt was the moment that the 2nd rose troop, no, the rose troop became newly reborn.Io looked into Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cTroop commander Roan. Will you use Rose as the name of the troop?\u201dAt those words, Roan fell into his thoughts for a moment.His thoughts of wanting to remain with the dead Gale, the adjutants, and the soldiers rose up like smoke through a chimney.However, the name of rose troop was still that of a troop belonging to the 7th corps.Roan slowly shook his head.\u201cI want to use another name.\u201d\u201cDid you think of something?\u201dAt the question, Roan nodded.He turned his head and looked at Austin and the soldiers.\u201cAmaranth, we will be the Amaranth troop.\u201dHe spoke in a low voice but with strength.An exclamation came out of Io\u2019s mouth.\u201cA flower that doesn\u2019t wither\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s a really good name.\u201dIt meant that although he couldn\u2019t use the name of rose troop, \u00a0he would never forget his dead allies.\u2018And I will never again lose my troop members.\u2019Now, the flower won\u2019t be dying at all.Because the newly born rose troop won\u2019t wither for eternity.\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapter!I\u2019m back bxtches!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of that\u2026\u2026..\u2019There was no guarantee that he would keep getting promoted just because he fled to another kingdom.Especially for Roan, that already rose quite big merits for Rinse kingdom, even more so.\u2018The commanders that fled from another country receive quite the harsh treatment.\u2019You wouldn\u2019t know if you had the force or the abilities to beat that treatment but at least it wasn\u2019t easy for the Roan as now.\u2018Even the trial that\u2019s called to be a tyrant got thrown away after being exiled.\u2019The exile was the last resort.In the end, rising a force inside Rinse kingdom was the most reasonable thing.\u2018But right now, we don\u2019t have the strength necessary to raise an independent force.\u2019He was still a noble and his rank was also a mere troop commander.\u2018For now, I have to build my strength below the shadow of the Lancephil family.\u2019The Lancephil family would suffer a big change in 6 years anyways.\u2018I have to become a person that can lead that change.Roan clenched his fists.He saw the entrance of Tale region from far away.The entrance that was surrounded with loose wooden fences.There was a warning note written that you shouldn\u2019t enter thoughtlessly.\u2018Is it really starting.\u2019A smile appeared in his face.He, that was a mere greenhorn spearman of the 13th squad of rose troop, was now a commander of a troop.On top of that, he also became the responsible of a region.Compared to his past life, it was a commendable growth.\u2018Then, shall we go meet the Sollum troop?\u2019His steps were light.A faint expectation was seen in the faces of the troop members following his back.A cool wind blew.Soon, even autumn was coming to an end.*****A leisure afternoon.It was a leisure he felt in quite a while.A man that wasn\u2019t big but strong was humming below the shade of a tree.\u201cHmm. Hm. Hmm.\u201dA relaxed expression.\u2018I, I would like it if this went on for 4 more days.\u2019He extended his arms while yawning.However, his hopes crumbled because of the youth that was running to him from far away.\u201cTroop commander Semi!\u201dA voice as big as his body.The man, Semi slightly raised his head and looked at the youth.\u201cWhat? Did monsters appear again?\u201dAt those words, the other man shook his head.\u201cNo. Not that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen?\u201dSemi frowned.The youth continued saying.\u201cThe people sent by the Lancephil family has come.\u201d\u201cWhat! Lancephil family?!\u201dSemi stood up abruptly and put a surprised expression.\u2018Ah! Am I finally getting out of this disgusting region!\u2019A smile blossomed in his face.Semi.He was the troop commander in charge of Sollum troop.Semi danced and hugged the youth.\u201cHamon. It was nice unti, bulshit. Anyways, thanks for what you have done until now.\u201d\u201cYes? Um, troop commander\u2026..\u201dThe youth Hamon smiled awkwardly and pushed off Semi.\u201cIt seems like you have thought of the wrong things. The people the Lancephil family sent\u2026\u2026\u201dHis voice became lower.\u201cAre the superior troop that will be leading us.\u201dAt that moment, Semi that was dancing abruptly stopped.\u201cHuh? What did you say? What?\u201dHe frowned and asked back.Hamon let out a sigh instead of replying and pointed to the entrance.Eyes that meant that he would know if he went.\u201cThis fuc\u2026\u2026..\u201dAt that moment, curses came out of Semi\u2019s mouth.\u201cThey put us in here without contacting us at all but what? Superior troop? They are really speaking bullshit.\u201dThe pent up anger surged up.Because of his hot temperament he made small and big accidents and got exiled to Tale region, but his temperament didn\u2019t change easily.\u201cBe it count Lancephil or what, it\u2019s so dirty that I will throw everything. Pth!\u201dSemi spitted and started to walk.\u2018So the guy that would lead us came, right? Good. Let\u2019s see him once.\u2019His anger had already surged up to his head.Hamon, that was looking that, let out a short sigh.\u201cHe\u2019s out of himself again. He will regret it all later. Tch.\u201dMeanwhile, Semi arrived at the entrance.At that moment, his face became even redder.\u2018This fuck. That greenhorn won\u2019t be my superior, right?\u2019The place Semi\u2019s sight was staying at.None other than Roan was standing over there.Semi moved his feet and stood in front of Roan.\u201cWhat are you guys?\u201dA rough talking.It was a rude and conceited attitude.But Roan didn\u2019t say anything.Austin, that was at the back, walked to the front and gave him the order.Semi spread the order roughly and started to curse.\u201cDamn! It\u2019s so dirty I won\u2019t be able to do this!\u201dHe shook the order and snorted.\u201cHmph! So this troop that\u2019s called Amara-what is really a superior troop than ours?\u201dOnly then did Roan slowly open his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the order says.\u201dAt those words Semi looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cAnd you are the troop commander of Amaranth?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRoan\u2019s expression and voice was composed.Semi had an expression that it was absurd.\u2018I have to follow the orders of this greenhorn?\u2019The anger surged up once again.\u2018I would rather go to jail.\u2019Jail and the region of Tale.When they told him to choose one of the two, he chose Tale region.And that was already 2 years ago.From the past 2 years, he subjugated the monsters.\u2018It was dirtily exhausting, and dirtily annoying, but even so I was the king here.\u2019The ones managing Tale region were only the Sollum troop and the one leading that troop was himself.With just that one thing, he could endure the hell like times.However, even that seemed to be taken away.He couldn\u2019t let that happen.He couldn\u2019t let that taken away.\u2018Here the Sollum troop is, I am the king!\u2019He looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cWe have to take your orders? Don\u2019t speak bullshit.\u201dSemi snorted.\u201cEven at first glance you are a greenhorn bastard that just finished his training. I don\u2019t know how you bought count Lancephil\u2019s interest but we have this region grasped tightly.\u201dAt that moment, Austin got angry and stood up.\u201cTroop commander Semi! Your words are too\u2026..\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dHowever Roan raised his hand and stopped him.Roan looked at Semi\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cWhat should you do? You and your amaranth troop just have to shut their mouths and suck your fingers behind us. Why? Do you feel it unfair? If you do\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I do?\u201d\u201cTry to fight back with that childish and soft hand of yours. Kukuku. Instead, I don\u2019t hold any mercy to the ones attacking me, so take that into account.\u201dA voice filled with confidence.Roan just thought of that as funny.\u2018As expected.\u2019When he first heard stories about Sollum troop, he had kind of expected this situation.Troublemakers.The worst of the worst.There was no way those kind of guys would simply follow his orders.\u201cCan\u2019t let you like this. Let\u2019s hit you for now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Semi frowned.Then.Roan\u2019s fist split the air.\u201cHup!\u201dSemi got surprised and fell back.The fist barely stopped in front of Semi\u2019s nose.Huk.Wind pressure was felt in the tip of his nose.\u201cThis son of a bitch!\u201dSemi\u2019s face became red.He ran towards Roan.you could see that his anger was already over his head.His movements were as fast as his hard body.Whong! Woong!His two fists and legs split the air continuously.An intent that seemed to drop Roan on the ground.However, Semi\u2019s attacks all hit the empty air.Roan dodged all of his attacks with the minimum movements.\u201cSo slow.\u201dRoan smirked and moved.He dodged Semi\u2019s fist and closed on him.\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen Semi put a surprised expression.Roan\u2019s fists split the air.Pububuk! Pubuk!He didn\u2019t use mana.But even so, his bones and muscles that got restructured after the overflowing was more outstanding than a normal person.\u201ckuk!\u201dSemi got hit in the chest and abdomen and fell.\u201cTroop commander!\u201dHamon yelled.He glared at Roan and ran towards him.Hamon was enduring it well until now, but actually he was as hot tempered as Semi.Woong.A huge fist split the air.Roan twisted his body and lightly dodged and then hit Hamon on his crotch.Pagak.\u201cKugk! Thi, this bastard!\u201dHamon lost balance and tottered, but he still cursed out.Roan grabbed Hamon\u2019s throat like that.A thread of mana surged up from the mana hole.Uduk.The muscles in his right arm swelled up.\u201cKuk!\u201dHamon struggled when he felt that his breath was getting cut off.His two feet got separated from the ground.\u2018Wha, what kind of strength\u2026\u2026\u2019Hamon and even Semi that was looking by the sides put surprised expressions.Because a small Roan raised up Hamon with one hand.Hamon struggled while being on the air.However he couldn\u2019t free himself from Roan\u2019s grip.\u2018He, he\u2019s a monster.\u2019Semi unconsciously stepped back.The anger that surged up over his head quickly died out.\u2018Did I make a mistake?\u2019He awoke himself late.\u2018Now that I see, even the guys of Amaranth troop\u2026\u2026\u2019Even when a fuss was happening, there was no one among the soldiers that moved.The intent hidden inside the solid formation.\u2018They are elite soldiers. It\u2019s a powerful army.\u2019Dry sweat flowed in his back.Semi inwardly blamed his hot temperament.Gulp.Dry saliva passed by its own.Nervousness could be seen in his face.Roan looked at that Semi and put a smile.\u2018It\u2019s just like count Lancephil said.\u2019Although the Sollum troop was composed by sinners, they weren\u2019t vile people.Rather, they believed in their own abilities or talent and acted as they wished.If he could make Sollum troop to become by his side, it would be of great help for his force.\u2018Anyways, it\u2019s comfortable as I don\u2019t have to hide my mana anymore.\u2019Roan talked with Io about things related to mana technique before separating.You wouldn\u2019t know about other places, but Tale region that was quite a secluded place was the most suitable place to train in his mana.In Roan\u2019s position, there was no need to be aware of other people anymore.\u201cListen well.\u201dHis voice was quite calm.\u201cI\u2019m troop commander Roan of Amaranth troop. Although it was the order of count Lancephil, I have no thoughts of forcefully command you.\u201dRoan turned to look at Semi.\u201cCome find me when you want to be commanded by me. Until then, I won\u2019t butt in in your things.\u201dHe loosened the strength in his grip after saying that.Tuk.\u201cKek. Kek.\u201dHamon started to cough after he fell on the ground.He didn\u2019t think of attacking him again and fell back.Roan looked that and put on a bitter smile.\u2018I didn\u2019t want to use force like this\u2026\u2026..\u2019But there was a need to show a suitable amount of strength to control the troublemaking soldiers.And of course, he wasn\u2019t planning to forcefully make them follow him after pressing them down with strength.\u2018I will make them follow me by their own.\u2019He wanted to make them follow him first with their hearts, and thoughts.Now was the start.Roan turned back.Amaranth troop followed his back while maintaining formations.\u201cWhew. I thought I would die.\u201dHamon let out a long sigh and touched his neck.Semi, that saw Roan and the troop disappearing, frowned.\u2018What to do\u2026\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t make a decision.If Roan used force and tried to forcefully command Sollum troop, they would all have rebelled roughly.\u2018Because the 500 people of Sollum troop are all like that.\u2019But as Roan made one step back, he felt somewhat prostrated.Even if he wanted to rebel, the reason to do so had disappeared.On top of that, the truth that Roan was so strong to the point that he was able to play with him and Hamon made him feel uneasy.\u201cWhat kind of guy could he have been? Even the soldiers that came with him seemed to be above normal.\u201dAt Hamon\u2019s words, Semi\u2019s face contorted.He got hit while not being able to resist properly.As Hamon complimented Roan and the troop in that situation, anger surged up.\u201cHow do I know that! Go and do what you were doing!\u201dAt the sudden rebuking words, Hamon smacked his lips.\u2018He\u2019s taking it out on me.\u2019He hid his thoughts and saluted and then walked towards his headquarters.It was best to hide himself when Semi was angry.Today was quite an eventful day for Semi with many meanings.\u2018Damn. I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t know. I will know if I keep watching them.\u2019This Tale region was different from the others.It wasn\u2019t a place where a troop that popped up out of nowhere could get accustomed to it and endure easily.Even if Roan and the troop were strong, he had a need to check if they could adapt well on this region.\u2018Even Sollum troop lasted 3 years on taking a place.\u2019At least on this place, Sollum troop was like the elite.Roan and Amaranth troop.Semi and Sollum troop.Two completely different troops were taking place on the same region.A flower that never withers and soil.The relationship started like that.*****Although the headquarters was quite old and shabby, it still had quite useful buildings.Amaranth troop checked the buildings thoroughly and made a place for themselves in the opposite side of Sollum troop.Roan remembered the continued forced march and ordered a rest for 2 days.Meanwhile some soldiers of Sollum troop approached their headquarters and made some fuss, but no big trouble occurred.Even Roan started to \u201crest\u201d in his place.He started to inspect his plans and trained on Flamdor mana technique.The current level of Roan\u2019s mana level was like that of a novice knight.And it was all thanks to the the overflowing of his mana that his mana hole, mana road, bones and muscles became reconstructed and strengthened.As he didn\u2019t know much about mana techniques, he was lacking comprehension about it.\u2018When the troop stabilizes, I will have to buy books and accumulate them.\u2019There were many things he had to do.He had to bring books and goods from the house that was in Beno castle, and had to earnestly manage Chris\u2019s agency and the 5 invested people and make them grow.But most of all, what he had to do first.\u2018I have to change the structure of the troop.\u2019A roughly made up troop.\u2018Although I couldn\u2019t touch the formation as I wished until now, but the situation has changed.\u2019Amaranth troop was completely Roan\u2019s.He was planning to apply one of the formations developed after the era of the great wars to Amaranth troop.\u2018To lead a small scaled troop effectively, it\u2019s good to use groups of ten.\u2019He would tie 10 soldiers to become one and give the commanding right one person.\u2018I\u2019m going to make a hundred man squad with the groups of ten as the base.\u2019Actually, the number of soldiers in Amaranth troop amounted to 400.If he reorganized them as groups of ten, 4 squad of 100 and 4 hundred man commander would come out.\u2018I will use the basic strategies of the troop as the hundred man squad.\u2019Although the basic formation was that of ten men groups, what could become the basis of the strategy was a hundred man squad.Roan quickly wrote down his thoughts in a piece of paper.At first glance it felt like nothing, but it was the basics of the basics.However what Roan was thinking about wasn\u2019t only this.The conditions of becoming a strong army wasn\u2019t only composed by the soldiers.\u2018I will have to slowly start some madmen of the small rooms.\u2019Madmen of small rooms.People called them like that and fingered at them.But they called themselves with other names.A faint smile appeared in Roan\u2019s mouth.\u2018Alchemists.\u2019\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s make one step slowly.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath and stood up.The plans he would face were now somewhat organized.His heart beat.The blood in his body circulated quickly.\u2018Let\u2019s make history.\u2019A blue light lit up in his eyes.*****\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat amazing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a formation I hadn\u2019t thought at all.\u201dThe troop members looked at each other and put surprised expressions.Austin, that was pondering, raised his right hand.\u201cIs there a need to change formations? We are all accustomed to the current formation actually.\u201dAt those words, some soldiers nodded.Their sight moved to Roan.\u201cThat formation was filled with weak points.\u201dA composed voice.Roan walked among the troop members and started to make a long explanation about the formation.He also explained how roughly made was the formation used in the squads, troops and corps.As his explanation became longer, a convinced look appeared in the faces of the soldiers.\u201cAh! That\u2019s why until now the troop was operated in several divided sections.\u201d\u201cNow that I see, we moved in more small scaled groups than the other troops.\u201d\u201cCan it be that that was like the ten men group?\u201dSeveral conversations could be heard.\u2018They are all quick to catch.\u2019Roan smiled faintly and nodded.When they still belonged to the 7th corps, the 2nd rose troop invested a lot of time in small group training and operation.And that was all for the pre establishment of the hundred men squad.\u201cIf the entire formation changes then the positions of troop commander, adjutant, squad commander will also be changed.\u201dEspecially, the adjutants that were crudely called as commanders would be clearly differentiated from the ten men leader and hundred men commander.If the size of the troop becomes larger, the thousand men commander and ten thousand commander will also be implemented.Here on, each task will get the role of staff officer.\u201cFor now, I will name the four people that will become hundred men commanders.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, nervousness was seen in the faces of the soldiers.Especially on the faces of the squad commanders, a faint expectation appeared.\u201cI name Austin to become hundred men commander to command and lead the entire troop instead of me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of Austin\u2019s mouth.The manager was a position that basically worked instead of the vice troop commander.\u2018For me to become a manager\u2026\u2026.\u2019Just a few months ago, he was working hard to get promoted to become a squad commander.That Austin became a commander that would lead hundred soldiers.He slowly stood up and moved.Roan lent him the declaration paper he had already prepared few days ago.Although there was no rank badge that suited with the new formation, Austin got deeply moved just with the declaration paper.\u201cI will do my best.\u201dAn earnest voice.Roan patted Austin\u2019s shoulders once and smiled.\u2018If it\u2019s Austin, he will work well.\u2019Followed by that, the naming of the second commander took place.\u201cI name Tane as the 2nd hundred man commander.\u201dTane, that was a squad commander of the 13th squad of rose troop stood up with a half absent minded expression.\u201cSquad commander Tane! Congratulations!\u201dPete whistled and yelled while shaking his right arm.And all the other troop members also clapped.Because they all recognized Tane\u2019s skills and merits he had accumulated during the small and big battles.\u201cLet\u2019s work well from now on.\u201dRoan gave him the declaration paper and smiled.Tane made a short salute.\u201cSir! I will do my best!\u201dA voice with strength.\u2018Relationships are really fun.\u2019Roan smiled.Just before a few weeks he was a newcomer spearman of the 13th squad which Tane lead.But now, he became a commander and a superior that lead an entire troop and named Tane to become his second hundred man commander.\u2018Who would have known that a greenhorn spearman would become a troop commander.\u2019Now that it turned out like this, there was no law that said that he wouldn\u2019t be able to become a monarch.Roan felt the emotions surging up and named the 3rd commander.\u201cI name Pete as the 3rd hundred man commander.\u201dAt that moment, silence fell.Even Pete, that was whistling towards Tane, froze like that.Pete, who threw a fist towards Roan that couldn\u2019t grasp the situation when he first returned to the past.He had passed over several squad commander ranked soldiers and became a hundred man commander.The surrounding soldiers all looked at Pete with surprised expressions.Pete got a hold of himself and pointed at his own face.\u201cDo, do you mean me?\u201dRoan just nodded.At that moment.\u201cWaaa! Pete! You completely succeeded!\u201d\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cPete, no. Commander! Congratulations!\u201dSeveral cheers were heard from everywhere.Amaranth troop was at much 400 people.They had established quite a solid relationship after the battles they faced together.There was no one that felt displeased or were against Roan\u2019s decision.\u201cHuh? Yea. E, everyone thanks.\u201dPete nodded with a shaking face and stood in front of Roan.Roan gave him the decree and patted his shoulders.\u201cLet\u2019s work hard.\u201dThe reason he declared Pete as the third commander.\u2018If Austin and Tane have the ability to command and lead, Pete outstands in the part of strength.\u2019A brave general that could face the enemies at the front.That was Pete.\u201cI, I will do my best.\u201dPete still had a half absent minded expression.He moved his feet and stood next to Tane.Tane smiled brightly and poked Pete\u2019s side.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cTh, thank you.\u201dPete smiled awkwardly and bowed.He didn\u2019t even know how to read but was staring at the decree as if his gaze would pierce through it.\u2018I\u2019m a hundred man commander?\u2019Based on the original formation, he was a mere adjutant.Emotions overflowed.\u2018I can\u2019t disappoint him.\u2019Resolution that he had to act according to Roan\u2019s expectation surged up.Meanwhile, Roan was naming the last commander.Everyone was concentrating on Roan.Although Pete was kind of unexpected, the hundred man commander until now were kind of expected.\u2018Now that Pete was the third, the fourth may be a really unexpected person.\u2019\u2018Who?\u2019Everyone gulped dry saliva.Only then did Roan feel the strange gazes and slowly opened his mouth.\u201cI name Harrison as the fourth commander.\u201dBoom.At that moment, even a worst silence fell than when Pete was declared.The gazes of the soldiers naturally fell in one place.A childish faced soldier.It was Harrison.\u2018M, me?\u2019He couldn\u2019t even bring those words out.Harrison was asking towards Roan while opening and closing his mouth.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.Harrison slowly stood up and carefully moved.The surrounding was still as dead as a rat.\u2018Harrison?\u2019\u2018He surpassed all the other squad commanders?\u2019Everyone had surprised looks.Then.\u201cHarrison certainly has the proper qualifications to become a hundred man commander!\u201dPason, that was one of the basic squad commanders, yelled out.\u201cRight! Just looking at his skills in archery, he was the best of the 7th corps!\u201d\u201cHe even saved the life of troop commander several times!\u201dThe other squad commanders added and yelled.THey knew really well what their role was.Because of that, the heavy silence got blown away like a feather.\u201cRight. Just looking at his merits, he\u2019s the best of the best.\u201d\u201cWell, just looking at skills the one that is the most suitable in the seat of hundred man commander is Harrison.\u201dThe soldiers all started to nod with convinced expressions.CHeers and applauses were heard everywhere.\u2018Everyone\u2026\u2026.\u2019Harrison looked at the troop members with an absent minded expression.Compared to the other soldiers, he wasn\u2019t even from rose troop.He had joined in late because of Roan.\u2018For everyone to recognize me like this.\u2019One corner of his heart became hot.His sight naturally turned to Roan.\u2018Troop commander. I\u2019m really thankful.\u2019Just a few months ago, he was a mere novice spearman.However, because Roan recognized his talent in archery and taught him that, he became able to live a new life.\u2018I won\u2019t forget this grace even when I die.\u2019Harrison bowed towards Roan.Roan lent him the decree and patted his shoulders.\u201cHarrison. Let\u2019s keep working hard from now on.\u201dThe words Roan said when he first met Harrison.Harrison nodded with a moved face.\u201cYes. I will stay with you until I die.\u201dHis voice trembled slightly.Roan smiled faintly.Harrison wiped off the tears and stood next to Pete.Like this, the naming of the four commanders ended.Continued by that, the naming of the 10 men commanders and staff officers followed up.The most important thing was the naming of the commander that would lead the information squad.Pens, that originally lead the information squad, couldn\u2019t enter the exile region of Tale and because of that he had to name a new responsible one.Roan named Keep, that was the nimblest of them all.And like this, the restructure of Amaranth concluded.Roan dissolved the troop and opened up another meeting between commanders.\u201cYou all should know it, but we are no different from sinners.\u201dThe hundred men commanders and the information leader all nodded.Roan kept talking.\u201cWe have to face the monsters of the region of Tale.\u201dA voice with strength.Roan looked at Keep\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cFor now, the information squad will thoroughly investigate the region of Tale. You have to investigate the rivers, nests, mountains and woods really carefully.\u201dHe pointed a wooden desk with his finger.\u201cI\u2019m planning to make a map so you can grasp the region of Tale in one sight.\u201d\u201cYou mean a map?\u201dAustin asked back with a surprised expression.Drawing up a map was quite a dangerous thing in this era.If you slipped, you could even get the misunderstanding that you were a spy.\u201cThis region of Tale is a really secluded place, different from other places. Because of that we are free from even the gazes of the people. There\u2019s no need to worry that much.\u201dAt those words several people nodded.However, they couldn\u2019t do anything that they still felt a bit uneasy.Tane asked back with a careful expression.\u201cBut do you have a need to do that?\u201dAs the appearance of monsters in this region was quite low, there was no need for the troop to act first.They would come attacking first if you just guarded the headquarters.Roan clenched his fists at those words.\u201cI\u2019m not planning to wait the monsters still.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026.?\u201dEveryone looked at Roan\u2019s face.A faint smile appeared in Roan\u2019s mouth.\u201cWe are attacking the monsters first.\u201dHe grabbed the table with both of his hands and then sticked out his head towards the commanders.A voice and expression that overflowed with confidence.However, a low voice but with strength was followed.\u201cI\u2019m planning to dry them up.\u201d\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!Once again completely sponsored by J.G as well as the next 2 chapters!

Fuck.\u2019Semi cursed out his stupidness, no, his rashness late.\u2018I just had to guard the headquarters\u2026.\u2019Originally, there wouldn\u2019t have been any problems if they just subjugated or chased away the monsters that approached the entrance.But as they saw Roan and his troop getting out of the camp from an early morning, he couldn\u2019t endure it.\u2018Not being enough with making an information squad to investigate the region and changing the formation to a strange one they also go out to subjugate monsters.\u2019It was an action he hadn\u2019t thought at all.He kind of felt that he and the entire Sollum troop were cowards.\u2018The owners of Tale region were us.\u2019A feeling that the ownership got passed over in an instant.On top of that, competitiveness he didn\u2019t want to lose to Roan arose.And fortunately, that was the same for the members of Sollum troop.They didn\u2019t want to see Amaranth troop, that were no different from a rock that rolled over, to just act as they pleased.In the end Semi left 100 men to guard the camp and charged out.They charged over to the regions were monsters appeared quite frequently.And the start wasn\u2019t bad.They annihilated the monsters that appeared at times and rose their spirit.They arrived to their destination, that was a hill.It was when he was resting and treating the wounded ones.The forest below the hill started to shake.The dense forest shook roughly and a sound shaking the ground hit their ear.When Semi and the others were looking at the forest with a nervous look.Pat!An amazing number of monsters appeared from the forest.An attack they hadn\u2019t expected.That was what just happened right now.\u201cWh, what do we do?\u201dHamon had a really nervous look.Only then did Semi throw away all the useless thoughts and bit his lower lip.\u201cWhat do you want to do? Of course we have to fight.\u201dThe monsters had already approached near the hill.In this situation, they could only fight against the monsters.\u2018Although its 400 vs 1.000 they are mostly small monsters. On top of that, we are positioned in a high place so it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have chances.\u2019Semi, that was quite hot tempered, got his head cleared up in front of a big fight.Because he knew that if the commander lost his rationality here, the entire troop would get annihilated.\u201cWe are getting the little ogres first.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe adjutants answered in one voice and stood in front of their respective squads.400 soldiers raised their weapons with nervous looks.\u201cKuaaa!\u201d\u201cKiek!\u201dThe monsters cried out.The ground shook and white dust surged up.\u201cCharge!\u201dAnd the order of charging also fell from Semi\u2019s mouth.His eye became red.And a strange heat surged up in his entire face.\u201cKill!\u201dYells that were to raise the morale on purpose poured out.Bang!Finally, Sollum troop clashed against the monsters.Slash! Stab!The limbs of the monsters started to get cut off with horrible sounds.\u201cKiek!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe goblins or kobolts that were a lot smaller than an adult couldn\u2019t resist properly and collapsed.The personal strength of each troop member was that strong.However, their performance was only up to there. The limit for Sollum troop was clear.Because it was the first time they faced a big scaled battle.\u201cLittle ogre! Aim for the little ogres!\u201d\u201cInfantry! To the right! Not there! Right! Right!\u201dSemi yelled with all his strength.But the order couldn\u2019t get executed properly. Each adjutant moved their respective squad as they wished.No, they couldn\u2019t even command the squad members properly.A really sad level to say that it was one troop.The formation that had a rectangle shape was now separated in several pieces.And monsters charged in from those spaces.\u201cKok!\u201d\u201cKuk! Your side got pierced through!\u201d\u201cThe formation of the front crumbled!\u201dThe formation that got turned aside once started to collapse even more.Anyways, if their individual strength wasn\u2019t good, they would already have gotten annihilated.\u2018Damn! We endured well for 2 years but what is this!\u2019Semi swung his blade while grinding his teeth.\u2018Although monsters appear frequently in this region, it\u2019s the first time a troop as big as this has appeared\u2026\u2026On top of that, this isn\u2019t a simple attack.\u2019Just like they were getting chased by someone.\u201cUak!\u201d\u201cKok!\u201dSeveral yells were heard at the surroundings.Semi\u2019s face stiffened.\u2018Because of my powerlessness, my troop members\u2026\u2026\u2019His eye trembled.Although he blamed himself, it was already late.\u2018Am I dying like this\u2026..\u2019A moment of life and death.Then.Sweeee!A sharp sound was heard.\u201cKiek!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe cries of the monsters was heard this time.Puuuuu!THe sound of the horn trumpet that\u2019s heard at the same time.Semi and the troop members looked back.A group of people that were attacking the monsters appeared.A flag that was high.A short letter was written in the flocking flag.At that moment, joy appeared in everyone\u2019s faces.\u2018Amaranth troop!\u2019\u2018They are here to rescue us!\u2019Their sight gathered at one point.Bang!Monsters got pushed back to the sides with a loud sound.The place that was separated.Roan was over there.\u201cAnnihilate!\u201dA short order and the several signals that get transmitted.The flagman that was next to him shook two flags of different colors.Puuuuu! Dung. Dung. Dung. Dung.The sound of horn trumpet and drums was heard.Amaranth troop took a triangle formation as if they were waiting for it.And of course, the one at the peak was Roan.He pulled Travias spear and emanated valor.There was no need to hide his mana anymore.The spear with a transparent light split the air and danced.Slash. Spat!And everytime that happened, a horrible sound was heard.\u201cKiek!\u201dSmall monsters like goblins and kobolts couldn\u2019t be Roan\u2019s opponent.And that was also the same for the little ogres.They got perplexed at the mysterious movements of Roan\u2019s spearmanship and stepped back.The moment their formation crumbled.The troop members of Amaranth ran to the sides.Stab!The weapon that gets stabbed in the sides of the little ogres.\u201cKuang!\u201dA cry exploded out.A look that he was at least trying to struggle.However, followed by that, the troop members swung their spears.Slash!The spears, swords, axes and daggers stabbed the head, neck, chest and abdomen consecutively.A perfect attack.Boom!The little ogre couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and fell.\u201cCharge!\u201dThe cry that shakes the battlefield.The peak of Amaranth troop easily charged over the group of monsters.Roan and the vanguard grouped up with the hopeless looking Sollum troop.\u201cAre you fine?\u201dLightly asking words.\u2018I didn\u2019t know they would copy us and go out to subjugate.\u2019Roan sighed shortly.After Amaranth troop departed, the monsters got subjugated and they executed a big performance.In that process, the small groups of monsters evaded Amaranth troop and fled to the west.But Sollum troop had to be over there.Several small groups gathered and that number amounted to 1.000.Sollum troop was performing the role of anvil between a hammer and an anvil.\u2018Anyways, i\u2019m glad we aren\u2019t late.\u2019Roan smiled faintly and looked at Semi.Semi also got a hold of himself late.\u201cYes. I, i\u2019m fine.\u201dActually, even the members of Sollum troop were half absent minded.And that was because only 300 men were pushing back and massacring the monsters that amounted to 1.000 lightly and pushing them back to the sides.\u2018I, is this the strength a troop has to get?\u2019Semi gulped dry saliva.Roan looked at that Semi once and shook his right hand to the back twice.At that moment, the groups of hundred that were pushing back the monsters started to fall back.The widely spread triangle shape shrank in an instant and then got a rectangle formation.\u201cKiek!?\u201d\u201cKek?\u201dThe monsters tilted their head when they saw the space that suddenly got empty.Then, the flagman shook the flag to the sides.The infantry that were at the front lowered their body and kneeled one leg.The archers that were at the back, poured arrows as if they were waiting for it.Sweee!A sharp sound.Tens of arrows split the air consecutively.Pubububuk!Monsters collapsed after becoming porcupines.And even among the archers, the one showing the most amazing skill was Harrison.Harrison, that was leading the archer squad and some infantry was hitting up the medium sized monsters, compared to the other archers that only hit small monsters.Puk!A look that their forehead got precisely pierced.\u201cIt, it\u2019s an amazing ability.\u2019The members of Sollum troop all opened their mouths.It really was an ability close to marvelous.\u201cKieeek!\u201d\u201cKuaa!\u201dAs the monsters started to get pushed one sidedly they let out cries and tried to rush in without any plans.Roan took out Travias spear as if he was waiting for it and then charged the ground.Amaranth troop followed his back.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dAt that moment, Semin and his troop members let out low exclamations.A shudder passed by their bodies.The scene occurring in front of their eyes.Amaranth troop that was facing hundreds of monsters.Their backs got fixed in their eyes.\u201cKek!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dAmaranth troop clashed with the monsters.The members of the troop moved in an ordered fashion.If one person attacked, another put more strength in that attack, and the remaining ones filled in the flaws after the attack.\u2018So this was what they trained on everyday at the training field!\u2019Semi got amazed and kept getting more amazed.His sight naturally moved towards Roan.The front of the front line.The place you could say that was dangerous had Roan over there.Pabababat!Travias spear moved as if it danced.Pubuk! Puk!The monsters that were close by got hit consecutively by fists and kicks and got bounced off.A feeling that a long line of light was drawn following the spear.Roan\u2019s movements werent only destructive, but beautiful.\u2018They aren\u2019t my opponents.\u2019Semi realized Roan\u2019s and the troop\u2019s skills.They weren\u2019t opponents he or Sollum troop could do anything about.But strangely enough he didn\u2019t feel powerless, rage or despair.\u2018I want to get in there and fight together with them.\u2019He wanted to display more power than what he had, just like the strength Amaranth troop had.His face turned red at the boiling emotions.But that wasn\u2019t only about Semi.\u2018Will we also be able to move like that?\u2019\u2018How good would it be if I also had that kind of allies.\u2019Everyone of Sollum\u2019s troop looked at the battlefield with excited expressions.Desire surged up in their eyes.The opposition and antipathy they felt when they first met Amaranth troop had long since disappeared.\u2018He said that he would wait until we wanted\u2026\u2026\u2019Semi remembered Roan\u2019s words clearly.He turned to look back at his troop members and took in a deep breath.\u2018It seems like that time is now.\u2019He laid the decision.His sight moved over once again to the battlefield.The fight was already coming to an end.Complete victory.It was a complete victory for Amaranth troop.And it was also the first battle of Amaranth troop that one day will let know of its name to the continent.*****\u2018Lost. Completely lost. Even the plate is different.\u2019Semi shook his head.The place his eyes reached.Roan was over there.\u2018Just by rescuing our troop and safely returning us back is thankful enough\u2026..\u2019Roan ordered Amaranth troop, that comparatively had fewer damages, to look after the injuries of Sollum troop.In this situation, Semi got surprised at three things.The first.\u2018The troop members have absolute obedience in the orders of the troop commander.\u2019The second.\u2018The level of treatment is higher than what I thought. Although it\u2019s not at the professional level, they know really well how they have to treat injured ones.\u2019It was all because of the various experiences of the battles they had faced until now, but there was no way Semi could know that.But most of all, the reason he got more surprised than anything was because of the third cause.\u2018It\u2019s been exactly 20 days since Amaranth troop came here. But\u2026\u2026..\u2019Semi\u2019s sight moved over to Roan.Roan was checking on the conditions of Sollum troop\u2019s members.\u201cIf you rest for a while with a splint you will be fine, James.\u201dWords he said calmly.The soldier that was laying on the ground asked back with a surprised expression.\u201cHow did you know my na\u2026\u2026..?\u201dAt those words, Roan just smiled instead of replying.He stood up and checked on the condition of the next soldier.\u201cDarren. Check the condition of Lork. It seems like he\u2019s lacking on bandages.\u201d\u201cBent. You lack water.\u201d\u201cKolp. You can\u2019t move yet.\u201dThe names that come out without stopping.Roan was memorizing the names of Sollum troop members.And they got surprised each time their name was called.\u201cTroop commander. You even memorized the names of Sollum troop soldiers?\u201dAustin, that was treating the injured ones next to him, got astounded.At those words Roan shook his head.\u201cI still couldn\u2019t memorize everyone\u2019s names.\u201dBut even so, there was amazement in the faces of the surrounding soldiers.\u2018There were a lot of things to do during the past 20 days\u2026\u2026\u2019\u2018We changed the troop\u2019s formation, repaired the camp, and even trained on the troop\u2019s strategies.\u2019\u2018Meanwhile, he even memorized the names of Sollum troop\u2019s soldiers that don\u2019t have any relationship with us?\u2019Roan was really moving busily, as if he was really in need of ten extra bodies.\u2018I have to do everything I can, and the best I can.\u2019For a commander to memorize the name of a soldier.Roan thought that was the first thing a good commander had to do.If you kept doing war and battles countless soldiers die and get hurt.Different from the commanders, most of them can\u2019t even leave behind their short name.\u2018At least, I can\u2019t let my soldiers die without a name.\u2019Of course, if the size of his army became the size of a corps, and then he became a supreme commander, he obviously won\u2019t be able to memorize the names of everyone.\u2018By then, I will leave the names of my dead allies in words.\u2019So that people could remember and history also could remember them.When his thoughts continued up to there.A presence was felt at his back.\u201cTroop commander Roan.\u201dA familiar voice.As he turned back, he saw Semi and the adjutants in a line.And their expression was really hard.You could see nervousness in their faces.Roan immediately grasped their intentions.\u2018It\u2019s faster than I thought.\u2019Perhaps, cutting his morale in the first day would have been the most effective thing.The deeply bowed head.The armor that was covered with the blood of monsters was shining.\u201cOur Sollum troop\u2026..\u201dHis voice dimmed.Semi raised his head and looked at Roan.\u201cPlease command us.\u201dAt that moment, silence fell on the entire camp.It was obvious for Sollum troop, but even the members of Amaranth troop were looking at Roan.Roan didn\u2019t hesitate.He smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cFine.\u201dRoan looked at his surroundings and continued saying.\u201cFrom today on, Amaranth troop and Sollum troop are one.\u201d\\nTranslator\u2019s note: Sponsored chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Flock!Two flags of different colors waved.And at the same time, tens of hundred-man squads moved busily.Infantry and archers gathered and separated.Even when there were approximately 800 soldiers, you couldn\u2019t hear anything noisy.They only gave and received orders through the flags and signals.And Roan looked at that from a high place.\u2018They became accustomed to it faster than I thought.\u2019A faint smile appeared on his face.Actually, he was kind of worried when he first received Sollum troop.He was worried about them not being able to catch up with the training.But fortunately enough, the Sollum troop members showed great skill in adaptability.\u2018In this region of Tale, you get weeded out if you can\u2019t adapt, and if you get weeded out, you die.\u2019Roan, who was looking down at the training ground raised his right hand.Flock!The flags that were waving at the sides crossed each other.At that moment, the members of Amaranth troop took formation and organized themselves properly.This was the end of troop training.The movements were smooth and quick to the point you became amazed, but there were no changes in Roan\u2019s expression.\u201cAfter finishing training, study the signals between each ten man groups.\u201d\u201cYes! Understood.\u201dSeveral hundred-man commanders replied in one voice.Roan nodded with a satisfied expression and moved away.\u201cPant. Pant. Pant.\u201dRough breaths were heard in several places, as if they were waiting for it.And most of them were made by the members of Sollum troop.\u2018It\u2019s really an unbelievable training.\u2019They had the feeling that they wanted to lay down immediately.But they couldn\u2019t do so.No, they didn\u2019t want to do so.\u2018Anyways, we\u2019re getting strong.\u2019\u2018We\u2019re starting to coordinate.\u2019They had the feeling that they were getting stronger.Although it was physically exhausting, their mentality at least was clear.\u201cWe finished training with the hundred-man groups.\u201dThe voices of the hundred-man commanders were heard.The nine squads moved busily.The troop members caught their breath and cooled down their muscles when Roan got out of the headquarters.The place the head of the horse was heading to was the north entrance.You could see sloppy wooden fences over there.\u2018Because of Count Lancephil\u2019s consideration, I can properly breath a little better.\u2019Originally, there had to be surveillance soldiers following the boundary of the territory.However Io trusted in Roan and the Amaranth troop.\u2018But even so, I can\u2019t act as I please.\u2019Roan didn\u2019t leave the Tale region as he wished.As he approached the fences, he saw a familiar face.\u201cTroop commander.\u201d\u201cMister Pens.\u201dIt was Pens of Chris\u2019s agency.Roan shook his hand at the welcoming feeling.They exchanged greetings with the fence between them.\u201cIs the establishment going well?\u201dRoan was training the troop, subjugating the monsters, and at the same time, proceeding with the work of Chris\u2019s agency.Pens laughed awkwardly and fell to the sides.\u201cTalk that between you two.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen Roan tilted his head, he saw a familiar face behind Pens.A smile appeared on Roan\u2019s mouth.\u201cMister Chris.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really been a while. Troop commander Roan.\u201dA bright and clear voice.The owner of the bright face was Chris.*****The torch in the walls pushed back the darkness.A disgusting smell pinched the tip of your nose.There were chains in the dirty wall.Prison.It certainly was a prison.\u201cWhat is this look.\u201dA regretful voice and expression rang out.A middle aged man with luxurious clothes put his hand inside the bars.Although there was a guard behind him, he didn\u2019t stop him.\u201cCount Chase. There\u2019s really no face.\u201dThe dirty look of the middle aged man who was bowing.Surprisingly enough, he was Benjamin Doyle.Chulg.Every time Benjamin moved, the chains on his wrists, neck, and ankles shook.\u201cCount Chase. Pl, please don\u2019t throw me away. Ge, get me out of here.\u201dThe expression and voice that couldn\u2019t be earnest and was even mean.The middle aged man with luxurious clothes, Jonathan Chase, patted Benjamin\u2019s hand.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Is our relationship a normal one?\u201dHe pretended to be aware of his surroundings and then lowered his voice.\u201cI\u2019m convincing some nobles myself. In this situation what the seat of supreme commander of the eastern region, that bastard Io Lancephil, took away as he wished, will be yours.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dBenjamin bowed with a moved expression.\u201cThank you. Really thank you. I will certainly pay back this grace.\u201d\u201cOho. How can you use that word in our relationship?\u201dJonathan laughed.\u201cI prepared good food aside, so you just take care of your body.\u201dHe spoke in a warm voice and with consideration.Benjamin was now about to cry.\u201cI will only believe and follow Count Chase until I die.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dJanathan burst out in laughter.\u201cThen, let\u2019s meet outside of the prison next time.\u201d\u201cYes. I will accompany you to a good place then.\u201dBenjamin bowed.Jonathan looked at that sight for a moment and then slowly moved his feet.The guard who was at the back, followed Jonathan.Clunk!The entrances that were closed stiff opened up consecutively.\u201cMm.\u201dJonathan frowned at the bright sunshine.He took out a small glass bottle from his chest.The expression that was warm and that of a good person had disappeared instantly.A fierce and scary eyes.\u201cGet rid of him without any mistakes.\u201dJonathan handed over the bottle to the guard.The guard just bowed without saying anything and moved inside the prison.Clunk!The entrance closed alongside the sound of metal.\u201cBenjamin you stupid bastard.\u201dJonathan started to curse aloud.Then, a long shadow appeared from the sides.\u201cIs there a need to kill him?\u201dThe owner of the voice was an old man starting to age.He was an underling serving Jonathan and the chandler of the Chase family, Hoose.\u201cDon\u2019t speak of what you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not one or two things he\u2019s messed up. If he says that he would keep his hereditary title, even I would be in danger.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s something Count Lancephil is cautious about.\u201dThe chandler slowly nodded.Jonathan\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cIo Lancephil. Who was the bastard that old man got interested in?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s called Roan.\u201dHe replied with a short answer.Jonathan moved his feet and spit on the ground.\u201cRoan. Thoroughly investigate into that bastard.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s merely a commoner and a troop commander.\u201dAt the chandler\u2019s words, Jonathan stopped walking.He turned to look at the chandler and said in a fierce voice.\u201cBenjamin Doyle was done in by that mere troop commander commoner? On top of that, his merits and rumors aren\u2019t normal. I\u2019m also bothered that he\u2019s got the interest of Io Lancephil.\u201dBy then, the chandler could only step back.\u201cI understand. I will thoroughly investigate like you said.\u201dOnly then did Jonathan start to walk again.You could feel his annoyance in each of his steps.\u2018Io Lancephil.\u2019Ududuk.He ground his teeth.\u2018As you cut down one of my men, I\u2019ll also do the same for you.\u2019The adversary was his political enemy and a rival of another family, Io Lancephil.He didn\u2019t think at all to let it pass.The wind that started to blow in the eastern region of the kingdom also blew in the capital of Miller.It was a cooler and sharper wind than the wind of winter.*****Roan and Chris held hands and asked how they had been for quite a while.\u201cI have been a bit late because I was befriending the orcs of the southern region in Byron kingdom.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve really worked hard.\u201dRoan appreciated Chris\u2019s hard work.Because of Chris, he could finish the tedious war faster than what he thought.\u201cFrom now on, I will proceed with the work of the agency.\u201dAt Chris\u2019s words, Roan nodded.They were trustable and relieving words.\u201cFor now, I\u2019m planning to establish a point near the region of Tale.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris shook his head.\u201cI think it would be better to wait a bit more for that.\u201dIt was composed, but had some expectations in his expression.Roan saw Chris\u2019s face and tilted his head.Chris smiled faintly and said.\u201cBy now, the trial of Benjamin Doyle is occurring in the capital of Miller.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dA low exclamation came out of Roan\u2019s mouth.Chris continued saying.\u201cIt seems like with the help of Count Lancephil and corps commander Tate, everything Benjamin messed up is coming out. The chances of his title of nobility being deprived is high.\u201dAt those words, Roan nodded.He had kind of expected that part.\u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s a report saying that the reason Byron kingdom retreated is because of your plan.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dRoan had a surprised expression.He bitterly smiled and shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s something you worked hard to do. It\u2019s not my merits.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201dChris hurriedly shook his hands.\u201cI just did as you ordered me to do so.\u201dHe smiled brightly and continued saying.\u201cAnyways, if Benjamin gets his title deprived and your merits get reevaluated, the exile can become a bit lighter.\u201dLighter.It was only that.Even if it was an unreasonable and stupid order, when he resorted to violence, Benjamin was still a noble.Because of that, it wouldn\u2019t happen that Roan would be completely withdrawn from the exile.But there were high probabilities of his penalty being lowered.Chris\u2019s voice became low.\u201cWith that condition, Count Lancephil has given the opinion of getting you in charge of the region of Tale.\u201dRight now, Io had given the punishment with the authority as a Count.But if it proceeded as Io\u2019s will, Roan would get his punishment decreased by the orders of the royal palace, and formally get appointed to the subjugation of the monsters of the Tale region.Also, he would become free in deciding the entrance and the coming and going of the region of Tale.But of course, he couldn\u2019t do anything about him being labeled as a sinner until it was completely pardoned.\u201cIf only that happens, won\u2019t it be good to move your agency\u2019s headquarters all the way to this region?\u201dThere was no need to put it in a nearby region.\u201cFor now it would be best to check the situation.\u201d\u201cYes. That would be good.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Chris nodded.Roan fell into his thoughts for a moment.\u2018Establishing an alchemist guild, the head office of Chris\u2019s office, and the offices for each branch in the region of Tale is the most beneficial thing\u2026\u2026.\u2019He had already planned to establish a force in the region of Tale anyways.On top of that.\u2018The end of the southern region of Tale meets with Poskein lake.\u2019Although there was quite some distance with the village of Perr, where Daiv was located at, it was the most suitable place to enter Poskein lake after this.Roan ended his thoughts and looked at Chris.\u201cGood. For now, let\u2019s wait until a decision is made in the capital. But before that\u2026.\u201dJust because of that, he couldn\u2019t just wait while sucking his fingers.He calmly told Chris all the plans he had set up until now.Chris hurriedly started to write down notes at the plans that were more complex than what he thought.And among them, there obviously was the investment on the five merchants, the investment in Daiv and the sailors association, and the gathering of alchemists and other skilled people.\u201cOh, how is mister Ford\u2019s progress in the mining industry?\u201dThe only one that kept failing consecutively among the five was Ford.Chris smiled faintly and replied.\u201cFortunately, he did discover a small metal mine. The size isn\u2019t that big but as the abilities and skills are good, there\u2019s more production than the other mines.\u201d\u201cHe certainly was a person with talent.\u201dChris nodded at Roan\u2019s words.\u201cYes. He\u2019s someone that will become big if he only finds a proper and a big mine.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan said as if he was whispering and said.\u201cThere\u2019s a mountain called Montea in the western part of Count Lancephil\u2019s territory. It\u2019s a mountain that no one has put their hands on yet.\u201d\u201cMontea mountain\u2026\u2026\u201dChris noted it down meticulously.\u201cBuy mining rights with the jewels I gave you.\u201d\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s something over there?\u201dChris asked with a nervous expression.\u2018There\u2019s a magic stone mine over there.\u2019It was a mine that would be discovered three years from now .He clearly remembered it as it was news that could make the entire continent tremble.\u2018But of course, I don\u2019t know the exact location\u2026..\u2019Finding the exact location was Ford\u2019s job.Roan forcefully hid his emotions and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cEven I don\u2019t know that. I only heard that several miners wanted to mine in it once.\u201dThis was the truth.But of course, it wasn\u2019t because they were certain or anything.Wanting to try, thinking of maybe, that was the bigger side.\u201cThen, I think that quite a lot of miners should already have tried.\u201dThese were Chris\u2019s words.Roan shook his head.\u201cNo. That\u2019s not true. Because the Lancephil family doesn\u2019t sell mining rights.\u201dAnd it wasn\u2019t only for Montea mountain.Excluding three or four mountains that were in the territory of the Lancephil family, they didn\u2019t sell mining rights at all.Because there was no need to mine anymore and in the first place, they weren\u2019t interested in that part.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dA low exclamation came out of Chris\u2019s mouth.Roan took out a small envelope from his chest.\u201cIt\u2019s a letter i\u2019m sending to Count Lancephil. It\u2019s a kind of recommendation letter. Take that and go find the count.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to go and convince him.\u201d\u201cYes. If it\u2019s you, you will be able to do it.\u201dNo, precisely speaking, the convincing finished with Roan\u2019s letter.If it was Roan who Io appreciated, he would send the mining rights without problems.On top of that, there were also other contents written in it.\u2018There are more reasons as to why we have to develop Montea mountain.\u2019Several things happen in the Lancephil family five years from now on.And one of them is the territory battle with Count Chase, who was located at their west.One year after this battle occurred.A change happens in the Lancephil family.\u2018If it\u2019s Count Lancephil, he would understand the contents very well.\u2019Roan wrote that they should raise a fortress with Montea castle as the center.He also included the reason why they should build a fortress and the things that would happen after that day.Because he didn\u2019t know how the future would change.For now, he could only prepare for that.\u2018If our side is the one to build the fortress\u2026\u2026.\u2019The gathering of skilled people would lighten up.The scale of this was getting bigger.\u2018We are in a time where we slowly need more geniuses.\u2019The geniuses that were still hidden would start to appear.Roan clearly remembered their existences.\u2018If it gets remitted and the entrance to the region is allowed, I have to find the hidden existences.\u2019But that wasn\u2019t all.\u2018What\u2019s as important as that is raising those people myself.\u2019He also had to slowly focus on the education of his troop members.\u201cWhew.\u201dA long sigh came out on its own.There were just too many things he had to do.But because of that, it wasn\u2019t that he was annoyed.Rather, his entire body heated up.He had a feeling that he was accomplishing things.\u2018Let\u2019s work harder.\u2019Now was the time to work more earnestly.Roan looked at Chris and extended his hand.\u201cMister Chris. I will be asking of you.\u201d\u201cYes. I will do my best.\u201dChris grabbed his hand and bowed.The papers he was holding was felt heavily.The notes written down meticulously.Chris was really amazed.\u2018If troop commander Roan\u2019s plans all succeed\u2026\u2026.\u2019He would be able to establish a more solid base than anyone.Chris took in a deep breath.\u2018He\u2019s not someone to just end as a troop commander, or as a corps commander.\u2019His heart beat.\u2018The best thing I did since I was born\u2026\u2026.\u2019Chris raised his head and looked at Roan.The hand he was holding felt hard and warm.\u2018Was grabbing troop commander Roan\u2019s hands.\u2019A smile appeared on his face.He wanted to run to Lancephil\u2019s territory right away.He wanted to do anything for Roan.\u201cThen. I will see you later.\u201dChris bid his farewell and left to the castle.And Roan also returned to his HQ.The two people waited for the judgement to be laid down in the capital of Miller and they did their best in their jobs.And five days flowed by like that.EndTranslator\u2019s note: Regular chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 87 - Establishing a base (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe station was a distinctive spring.Wind blew over the camp.Flock!The high flag fluttered with strength.Amaranth troop was marching below the flag.And the one leading at the front was Roan.His armor was really wore down because of the continuous subjugations and battles that happened during the past 5 days.But the eyes shining below the helmet was clearer and deeper than before.\u201cYou have done well!\u201d\u201cHurray Amaranth troop!\u201dAs they entered the camp, the troop members that were standing guard shouted cheers.The more was as high as if it would poke the sky.\u201cTroop commander.\u201dThe centurion(hundred man commander) Semi, that was guarding the camp while the troop was away, approached.\u2018Huh?\u2019Roan opened his eyes roundly.Because he saw a familiar face behind Semi.\u2018Barone Hape?\u2019A middle aged man with neat and tidy clothes.He was a retainer of the Lancephil family, Jerom Hape.Because he came once per two weeks to provide them with food and provisions, he was familiar with Roan.Semil said in a low voice.\u201cBarone Hape has come. But it\u2019s not because of the supplies.\u201dA little excited voice.Roan slowly nodded and bowed towards Jerom.\u201cBarone Hape.\u201dLight greetings.\u201cTroop commander Roan. You came just now.\u201dJerom smiled brightly and grabbed Roan\u2019s hands.Greetings came and went for a short while.\u201cTroop commander Roan.\u201dJerom\u2019s voice became lower.A faint smile.\u201cReceive this.\u201dHe took out an envelope from his chest.A high class paper.Roan carefully teared the envelope and took out the letter inside of it.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation flowed out.His eyes stopped in one sentence.The letter he had waited for 5 months.It was a letter that informed him of his remission.\u2018It seems like the situation finally concluded.\u2019Roan heard the situation in the capital of Mill through the staff of Chris\u2019s agency.\u2018As Benjamin died in prison, the final judgement got suspended.\u2019No, it wasn\u2019t merely a suspension.But rather, the situation took a great turn.The atmosphere of having to reevaluate Roan\u2019s merits and remit him from his exile turned to a situation of inquiring the conspiracy theory of Benjamin\u2019s death.Even when Io paid attention to laying down the final judgement, the nobles showed more interest in other stories.In the end, it took five months until he received the judgement of remission.Roan breathed out longly.\u2018Anyways, the results are better than what I thought.\u2019In Roan\u2019s situation, there was nothing bad.ALthough he still was a sinner, compared to the exile situation, he became a lot more free.\u2018Is it the real start.\u2019His mouth slightly rose.He bowed towards Jerom for now.\u201cReal thanks.\u201d\u201cHahaha. What did I do? Thanks anyways.\u201d\u201cI will cleanly subjugate the monsters in the region of Tale.\u201dRoan said as if he was determined and then looked towards Semi.The troop members had already gathered behind him.Roan looked at the members with a nervous expression and put a faint smile.Because he thought of another thing that was written in the letter.\u201cCount Lancephil has forgiven the sins of all those soldiers that received the punishment by him.\u201d\u201cRe, really?\u201dSemi and the ex Sollum troop put surprised expressions and asked back.Roan smiled faintly and nodded.\u201cRight. You aren\u2019t sinners anymore.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dSemi and the others let out low exclamations.Originally, they were soldiers that belonged to a troop in the Lancephil territory but got punished because they made small and big mistakes.Originally, there were even sinners that got exiled from other places but the ones that didn\u2019t belong to the camp had already died.\u201cAh! Only now do I feel my chest cleared up!\u201d\u201cDamn! Am I also a common resident now?\u201d\u201cKuk! It feels good!\u201dCheers poured up from everywhere.Roan looked at that for a moment and then cleared his throat.\u201cHm!\u201dThe troop members shut their mouths like a lie.However, they couldn\u2019t hide their happiness.Roan smiled faintly and continued saying.\u201cThe soldiers that want to can return to Pavor castle.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that.\u201cTroop commander!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe expressions of Semi and Sollum\u2019s troop members stiffened.And the happy look also disappeared.They shook their heads with an angry expression.\u201cReturn to Pavor castle?\u201d\u201cDont\u2019 say such things.\u201dTheir voices became bigger every time.Semi took in a deep breath.\u201cTroop commander. We\u2026\u2026\u201dHe continued saying after he looked at the soldiers at his back once.\u201cAre of Amaranth troop.\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions turned red.The soldiers yelled with all their strength.\u201cWe aren\u2019t going anywhere!\u201d\u201cWe will remain here!\u201dComposed voices and expressions.But of course, there were some that stepped back and wanted to return to Pavor castle.But they were the minority.\u2018If we return, we will get treated as returnees anyways.\u2019\u2018Patrolling the castle is tediouis and boring.\u2019\u2018Tch! I don\u2019t want to return to where those helpless bastards are.\u2019In the first place, the members of Sollum troop didn\u2019t have normal temperaments.Because of that, they could keep guarding Tale region even after they got punished.If they were normal people, they would have thrown down everything and become farmers.\u201cMmm.\u201dRoan put a satisfied look at the ex Sollum troop.He got surprised at the reactions that weren\u2019t expected.It has only been 5 months since Sollum troop joined them.Roan thought that they would choose the safe Pavor castle instead of one of the most dangerous places, the region of Tale.But most of them chose to remain here.It felt like Roan\u2019s actions until now were proved to be correct.A feelign that the spirit of the members were poured in his entire body.He smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cI\u2019m glad. I also didn\u2019t want to lose outstanding soldiers.\u201dWhat Roan wanted to see was right this.Pressing down with strength and make them submit through rank, power and honor was an easy thing.However Roan didn\u2019t want to increase his force through that method.\u2018I\u2019m gaining their hearts.\u2019He wanted to make the contents and not the shell to be at his side.\u2018At least I made the feelings of Amaranth troop to be mine.\u2019He felt moved.The wind blew past him.\u2018Then, shall I start earnestly?\u2019He received the commision and the troop members also became one.Only work remained now.\u2018The first is certainly\u2026\u2026.\u2019Many plans were drawn before his eyes.And Chris\u2019s agency was at the top of that.\u2018I have to establish an agency.\u2019It was now turn to become proper eyes and ears for Amaranth troop.Roan clenched his fists tightly.His eyes moved to the north, where Pavor castle was located.*****An earnest change started to occur in the region of Tale.Chris\u2019s agency, the alchemists guild, and the associations of skilled people entered the region.As it started in a low scale, the migration ended only after one month.\u201cWe are finally together.\u201dRoan sat facing Roan and tilted his tea cup.And Chris also smiled while remembering the past.\u201cThere really happened many things.\u201dUntil now, quite many things had happened.In the first place, he who\u2019s dream was running a travel agency opened his eyes on gathering and analyzing information and roamed the entire kingdom.He had also roamed the battlefield and even entered enemy territory.His life had entirely changed after meeting Roan.\u2018He\u2019s my top benefactor.\u2019Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of moving more earnestly from now on.\u201d\u201cEarnestly\u2026..\u201d\u201cI will leave your travel agency separately for international uses and establish another organization that will gather and analyze information.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dChris let out a low exclamation.Even so, it was something he had pondered about.He couldn\u2019t keep running the information agency in a size this small.\u201cI\u2019m planning to call the group agens. What do you think?\u201d\u201cAgens\u2026\u2026.Good.\u201dChris smiled faintly and nodded.Roan kept speaking.\u201cYou be the head of the agens. From now on, you will have to be the ear and eyes for our Amaranth troop.\u201d\u201cYes. I will do my best.\u201dChris clenched his fists with a resolute expression.After that, conversations about the operation of the agens continued for a while.It was decided that the members of the agens would learn basic martial arts and stamina training and get a more organized system.\u201cThe agens will work as an affiliate of Amaranth troop.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dChris took in a deep breath.Magnificence kept surging up.Roan saw that and extended his right hand.\u201cLet\u2019s keep working hard.\u201dChris hesitated for a moment and then said with a careful expression.\u201cTroop commander Roan.\u201dA kind of serious and solemn expression.\u201cThe agens now formally became an affiliate of Amaranth troop. From now on, please speak comfortably.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan nodded with a low exclamation.Because he realized Chris\u2019s intentions.\u2018Right. We can\u2019t maintain this relationship forever.\u2019Chris\u2019s relationship was different with the other members.As they each started in different situations, they got accustomed to speaking formally to each other.However, now that the agens became part of Amaranth troop, there was a need to clearly differentiate the ranks.\u201cFine. From now on, I will speak comfortably.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dChris smiled brightly and bowed.In the first place, Chris received Roan\u2019s help when he established his agency.And after that, most of the inversions were provided by Roan.Chris\u2019s agency was just like Roan\u2019s.There was no displeasure or rejection about the ranks of superiority.\u2018Rather, I feel more secure now that a branch was formed.\u2019Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThen. Let\u2019s work hard from now on.\u201d\u201cI will do my best.\u201dThe two people smiled while looking at each other.Like this, the best information agency in the continent in his past life took its first step.*****Tang! Tang! Tang!Hammering sounds were heard.A wide plain spread at the south of Amaranth troop\u2019s HQ.Tens of houses were being made in the place that didn\u2019t have humans in it because of the frequent appearance of the monsters.\u201cIs there a need to go up to this point?\u201dAustin had an uneasy expression.In the other side, there was a faint smile in Roan\u2019s face, that was watching the houses being built.\u201cTale region becomes more fertile the more we go to the south. We can\u2019t just let this good soil go to waste.\u201d\u201cI do know that. But compared to the north, the south has much more monsters appearing in it. Will people move to this dangerous place?\u201dAustin let out a short sigh.The smile in Roan\u2019s mouth became even denser.\u201cWe have to make it so they do want to move.\u201dA composed voice and with strength.\u2018I have to move the residents in the north migrate to the south.\u2019Although Tale region was one of the most dangerous ones and an exile place, it wasn\u2019t that it didn\u2019t have residents at all.With the permission of the Lancephil family, about 2.000 people were placed to live in a comparatively safe zone located at the north.It was a measure to provide supplies and for the comfort of the ex Sollum troop, that protected the region and subjugated the monsters.\u2018Because there\u2019s a limit with the supplies given my the count\u2019s family.\u2019The residents of this region gave some of the harvested crops to the troop and made a living like that.Even in that situation that life wasn\u2019t easy and you didn\u2019t know where monsters may appear, the residents didn\u2019t leave the region of Tale.\u2018Because the Lancephil family exempted them from taxes.\u2019Tang! Tang! Tang!The sound of hammers became clearer.The ones building the houses were the carpenters belonging to the artisans associations.And they were also really uneasy when they first moved over to the region of Tale.But after they realized that the surroundings were safer than they thought because of the subjugation of Amaranth troop, they got a bit relaxed.On top of that, they started to build tens of houses according to Roan\u2019s plans and gaining quite the good profits.Roan looked at the construction and fell in his thoughts.\u2018I will build the houses first and make the rent to have no compensation to the ones that decide to move over. On top of that, I\u2019m stationing two companies(hundred men squad) over here.\u2019The methods to make the residents of the north migrate to the south.The establishment of houses was one of the main businesses of gold master Sale, in his past life.Normal commoners made their own houses with their own hands.But this was a difficult thing and lasted more time than thought.Because of that, commoners just raised up a wall roughly so it didn\u2019t collapse and covered it with weeds and branches to make a roof so rain didn\u2019t leak in.A really sloppy shaped house.If a strong wind blew, the roofs would get blown up and the walls would crumble.And everytime that happened, they had to repair it or make a new one.In this situation, gold master Sale made tens of units to build houses and started a business that consisted of lending it instead of a certain rent.Roan was planning to use Sale\u2019s house business.\u2018I will provide them with a house a lot better than what they are living right now.\u2019It certainly was a condition they would get charmed by.\u2018On top of that, if they are farmers, they won\u2019t ignore the fertile ground of the south.\u2019If only security was assured to some degree, they would come running immediately and start farming.\u2018For now, I will have to meet the residents of the north.\u2019He was planning to meet them and reveal his plans and convince them.But of course, he didn\u2019t think of forcefully make them move.\u201cAustin. Keep guard thoroughly and protect the carpenters.\u201dAt those words, Austin that was looking at the situation, made a short salute.\u201cSir. Don\u2019t worry about here.\u201dA reliable look.Roan bowed slightly and got up his horse.As he pulled the reins, the horse turned to the north.\u201cHiyat!\u201dAs he kicked the horse, it started to ride with strength.Dudududu.Horsesteps were heard along a white dust.Roan sticked his chest to the saddle and took in a deep breath.Then, he saw black smoke surging up consecutively.At that moment Roan\u2019s face stiffened.He knew what the identity of the smoke was.\u2018Beacon?\u2019EndTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even centurion Harrison, who was patrolling in the north, would have moved after seeing the beacon.\u201d\u201cGood. Then, I\u2019m entrusting the HQ to you!\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry!\u201dAnt made a short salute.Roan hurriedly turned the head of his horse.And soon, the cavalry appeared.Their numbers were merely 50.However, they were the best among the best in Amaranth troop.\u201cWe are moving quickly towards the village in the north! Don\u2019t fall behind!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dAt Roan\u2019s orders, the cavalrymen replied in one voice and kicked their horses.The chest that moved closely to the saddle.The fifty cavalrymen ran while splitting the air with Roan at the front.Their destination was the village in the north.It was the place that still hadn\u2019t fired up the beacon.*****Hans, who was exactly 60 this year, lived a life filled with despair.The stories tell that he was born as a vassal of a wicked and stupid noble family, lived on while being pressured, and exploited and became a vagabond at the age of 49.He was wandering in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom and then became a vassal of the Lancephil family thanks to Io\u2019s consideration.He was placed in a barren land in the northern region with people with similar circumstances as him, but he couldn\u2019t live calmly at all because the people of Byron kingdom invaded without stop.Then, he heard the notices that the Lancephil family was selecting people to immigrate to the region of Tale.On top of that, he even heard that they were going to exempt them from taxes and provide them some money for the settlement.The foreigner Hans, who didn\u2019t even know what kind of place the region of Tale was, applied for it, and got elected.That was when he was 53 years old.Hans migrated to the northern region of Tale along with 3,000 people.Only then did he realize that the region of Tale was heaven for monsters, but he believed in the territory guards that were settled in together with them.But merely after two years that they settled in, thousands of residents and most of the guards lost their lives.The region of Tale was really heaven for monsters and hell for humans.Most of the surviving people trembled in fear and left the region of Tale.However, Hans stayed in place until the end.This was because the support and the tax exemption was too sweet.\u2018Even if I return to where I originally lived, it\u2019s obvious that I will die at the hands of the Byron bastards.\u2019If he was going to die like this and like that, it was more profitable to stay in the region of Tale.Fortunately, the Lancephil family provided soldiers consistently.They even sent knights and soldiers to the north of Tale and subjugated the monsters.Seven years has passed like that.The number of the residents repeatedly increased and decreased and now they maintained a number of 2,000.Although the number of the guards that first amounted to 3,000 was now 800, the north of Tale was quite the safe place.Monsters didn\u2019t appear that often and even if they did, they were close to the troop\u2019s HQ so it didn\u2019t turn into become a dangerous situation.Thanks to that, three big and small villages set place following the boundary of the north.And the village that was created first and had the most number of people was this place, the place was called the village of the north.Hans was now enjoying his old and stable life as the chief of the village.\u201cHuh?\u201dHans, who was taking some air at the high watchtower, frowned.A middle aged man was running towards him in an urgent manner.\u2018Liss the herbman?\u2019Liss was someone that wandered around the safe places of the village and harvested good quality herbs.He shook his arms with an urgent expression and movements.\u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019As he paid more attention, he thought that he was yelling something. However, he couldn\u2019t hear well because of the distance.Only after the distance was closed did Liss\u2019s words become clearly heard.\u201cMonster group! Monsters have appeared!\u201dAt that moment, Hans\u2019s expression stiffened.\u2018Monster?! Why monsters so suddenly\u2026\u2026.\u2019He almost hadn\u2019t seen any monsters recently.He first calmed down his surprised heart and then yelled towards the guards that were at the watch tower.\u201cRing the bell! There are monsters!\u201d\u201cYe, yes! Understood!\u201dThe guards nodded with a surprised expression.Dong! Dong! Dong!Soon, the sounds of the bell were heard clearly.As Liss entered the village, the gates that were open, closed quickly.Soon, Hans got down the watchtower asked with an urgent expression.\u201cYou said monsters? Is that true?\u201d\u201cPant. Pant. It\u2019s true. It is.\u201dLiss calmed down his breath and barely started talking.\u201cI was harvesting some herbs near the village and then saw a dust cloud surging up.\u201dHis voice trembled.\u201cI wondered what was happening and climbed to the peak of a mountain and then saw a group of monsters that were approaching with a black color.\u201d\u201cBlack?\u201dHans asked back after he dry gulped.Liss just nodded several times instead of replying.Meanwhile, the villages people gathered around.\u201cWh, what\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cChief. Did something happen?\u201dEveryone had expressions filled with worry.Hans frowned.\u2018Monsters are coming in a black group?\u2019His sight moved over to the high fences covering the village.\u2018They were called Amaranth troop.\u2019This was the troop that was working instead of the Sollum troop to guard the region and subjugate the monsters.Five months ago, the members of Amaranth troop sought the village and built an even higher fence and a watch tower inside of it.\u2018Will we be able to hold on?\u2019There were about 100 guards inside the village.\u2018No. It\u2019s impossible.\u2019Although they had the newly build fence and the watch tower, it was impossible to handle the black group of monsters approaching them.\u2018To the south, it\u2019s better to escape to the south.\u2019When he thought up to there.\u201cChief!\u201dThe guards in the watchtower yelled in one voice.A yell closer to despair.Hans frowned and then moved up to the watchtower.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA low exclamation came out of his lips.And that was an exclamation mixed with fear and discouragement.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhat is happening!\u201dThe villages people yelled.Hans looked outside the village while gritting his teeth.\u2018There\u2019s at least 2,000 of them.\u2019Just like Liss\u2019s words, the group was pitch black.And moved faster than thought.White dust surged over them.\u2018It\u2019s impossible to escape.\u2019Going out of the village now was tantamount to suicide.\u2018A fortress!\u2019They could only face the monsters inside the village.He remembered the young troop commander of Amaranth troop he had met quite some time ago.\u2018Was he called Roan.\u2019He was a really well mannered and confident youth.\u2018Did he say that the defensive system of the north was perfect\u2026..\u2019Expression and attitude filled with confidence.That look was still fresh.\u2018In the end, we can only wait and believe in the Amaranth troop.\u2019They could only hope for that perfect defense system to be of great strength for them.Hans yelled below the watchtower.\u201cPrepare for battle! Move the women and children to the inner parts of the village and the guards and men all come up to the watchtower!\u201dHe took in a breath for a moment and then continued saying.\u201cMonsters are charging in.\u201dAt that moment, a heavy silence fell onto the villagemen.An unexpected thing came out of his mouth.They were kind of relaxed because monsters hadn\u2019t appeared until now.Then.\u201cKyaa!\u201dThe yell of a young girl broke the silence.\u201cAh! Hu, hurry!\u201d\u201cQuickly!\u201dThat was the start.The residents moved quickly.Although there was no control, they were residents of Tale.Hans also hurriedly sent the order.\u201cGather rocks and prepare hot water.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes!\u201dThe vice chief and the head of the guards, Carl, replied with an urgent expression and got down the watchtower.Hans just stood still and watched the monsters.The bastards were just lining up without any formations.Kuang!A cry was heard following the wind.Although he tried to forcefully act calm, dry saliva was gulped down unconsciously.Meanwhile, the guards and the men took place in the watch tower.They raised the bows and arrows Amaranth troop provided them with and aimed at the monsters.Gulp.Their adam\u2019s apples shook severely.Although they did stand up on the watchtower to protect their families, they couldn\u2019t do anything about feeling nervous.As they saw the 2,000 monsters, their knees shook and became short of breath.But even so, they couldn\u2019t escape.\u2018We protect our village ourselves.\u2019Everyone ground their teeth.Then.Wooooo!The monsters let out cries and started to charge.As 2,000 monsters kicked the ground at the same time, white dust rose up.They closed the distance in an instant.At that moment, several arrows were poured down from the watchtower.Sweeeee!A sharp sound rang out.But they, who didn\u2019t have proper training in the bow, couldn\u2019t put strength behind it.Pubububuk.Most of the arrows were stuck in the ground.Kieek!Monsters charged to the fences along with their cries.\u201cFire arrows! Throw the rocks!\u201dHans yelled with all his strength.The guards used all their strength to throw rocks and fire arrows.However, they couldn\u2019t stop the advance of the monsters.They soon moved closer to the fences.\u2018Ca, can\u2019t we block them?\u2019\u2018Is it the end?\u2019Everyone was thinking with expressions full of despair.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dSweeeeee!Sharp sounds were heard.At the same time, a dense shadow appeared before their eyes.It was a darkness that seemed to cover the clouds.Hans and the villagers raised their heads to look at the sky.\u201cAh!\u201dA low exclamation came out of everyone\u2019s mouths.\u2018Arrows!\u2019At that moment.Pubububuk.A rain of arrows poured over the monsters.\u201cKieeeeek!\u201d\u201cKuek!\u201dThe monsters, who were running towards the village with good spirit, started to fall.They started to become porcupines one by one.At the same time, the sound of the horn trumpet was heard beyond the monsters.Puuuuuuu!It was a sound that made their chests boil.White dust rose up.A troop flag surged up from the back of the monsters.Hans saw that and said with a moved expression.\u201cIt\u2019s Amaranth! The Amaranth troop appeared!\u201dDespair filled with joy.The villagers that were half absent-minded at the sudden situation yelled only then.\u201cWaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cAmaranth troop! Hooray!\u201dAn amazing shout exploded out from them.Hans took in a deep breath and covered his face with his two hands.As his nervousness disappeared, his two legs trembled and tears started to pour out.\u2018Ho, how could they come this fast?\u2019The herbman Liss had discovered the monsters and came running just now.But Amaranth troop, who should be at the HQ, had already appeared.Hans wiped off his tears with the back of his hand and looked at the troop flag.\u2018There really was the perfect defense system troop commander Roan talked about.\u2019He became excited for nothing.Then, a group in the rear started charging in while pushing back the monsters.It was a really fierce charge.It was Roan and the 50 cavalrymen.Behind him, the infantry company followed him.Tung! Tudung! Tung!\u201cKuek!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dAt the charge of the warhorses, the small sized monsters were bounced off to the sides.The cavalrymen and infantry took that opportunity and they made their spears dance.Slash! Spat!Horrible sounds were heard with the heads of the monsters falling to the ground.Paat!Finally, Roan and the troop members perfectly pierced through the monsters and stood at the entrance of the village.Roan was fully covered with the blood of the monsters.He raised his head for a moment and looked at the people on the watch tower.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe villagers let out a low exclamation.They saw the faint smile on Roan\u2019s mouth.The uneasiness that remained in a corner of their hearts completely disappeared.Roan turned the head of the horse again and looked at the monsters.He had a scary look.His lips were shut.Behind him, the soldiers took formation and organized themselves.Roan took in a deep breath.The smell of the fierce battlefield entered deep into the lungs.The lips that were tightly shut started to move.Soon, a rather low and strong order fell out.\u201cAnnihilate.\u201dEndNotes: Sponsored chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Flutter!Followed by that, sounds of the horn trumpet and drums were heard.Puuuuuu! Dun! Dun!

Understood.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s orders, the centurions replied with strength and scattered to the sides.Soon, the troop members started to move quickly according to their orders.Roan looked at that for a moment and then went to the entrance of the village.Kiiiiiik!The closed gates started to open as if it was waiting for him.You could see Hans and the villagers from the opened crack.Everyone had moved expressions.Roan roughly shook off the blood on his armor and stood in front of the villagers.\u201cI\u2019m troop commander Roan of the Amaranth troop.\u201dHe said with his head lightly bowing.At that moment, Hans and the others also bowed.\u201cOh my. Tha, thank you!\u201d\u201cWe were able to keep our lives thanks to you.\u201d\u201cMuch thanks.\u201dAt that look, Roan had a faint smile.It gave off a somewhat lonesome feeling.\u201cI\u2019m glad everyone\u2019s safe.\u201dIt was true.He was glad that the people, the village, was safe.However.\u2018More troop members died and became injured than what I had initially thought.\u2019This was the fate of a soldier.They were the ones that would end up dying while protecting what they had to.\u2018I mustn\u2019t forget their deaths.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.Then, Hans stood to the front and spoke in a low voice; almost as if he was whispering.\u201cHow did you realize so quickly and come here?\u201dRoan faintly smiled and explained about the patrolling system and the beacons in a simple manner.Hans, who was listening to it, nodded with an amazed expression.\u2018He really has a perfect defensive system.\u2019The more he saw him the more he felt reliable and trustworthy.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dThen he saw the soldiers retrieving the corpses of the fallen soldiers behind Roan.At that instant, Hans\u2019s expression turned dark.\u201cIt seems like many soldiers died because of us\u2026\u2026\u2026It seems like you suffered a really big loss for a village that wouldn\u2019t matter if it even existed.\u201dHans looked at the villagers closely.Just how much strength did the Amaranth troop put in protecting the village?They couldn\u2019t forget their pathetic looks.The villagers gathered both of their hands to their chests and slightly bowed.Roan shook his head at that look.\u201cOur role is protecting your life and well being.\u201dThere was strength in his voice.\u201cWe are no different from a family.\u201dRoan looked at the faces of Hans and the villagers.\u201cI, and our Amaranth troop never forget about family.\u201dEven if he was powerful and rich, he wouldn\u2019t be able to live on as a monarch throwing away his citizens.\u2018That\u2019s a real monarch.\u2019This was one of the principles of the monarch he thought that a monarch required and one of the most important things.That was the loving feeling towards his citizens.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dHans and the villagers let out low exclamations.\u2018I knew that he was a fine person\u2026\u2026\u2019When Roan first came to the village while leading Amaranth troop.When they built an even higher and sturdier fence and even built a watchtower.When they subjugated the monsters one step ahead.By then, they had already felt that Roan was different from the ordinary commanders until now.However, they didn\u2019t know that he was a person with such a big plate that he would even put his life on the line to protect the lives of the commoners.Hans knew the reason as to why the troop members moved without any hesitation at Roan\u2019s orders.\u2018If it\u2019s him, they can trust and follow him.\u2019Because it was to the point that even he felt like that.Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cChief. I have something to tell you in private.\u201dHe spoke with a careful expression and words different from before.Hans nodded.\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go to our house.\u201dHe was the benefactor of his life.He was planning to listen to him in whatever he said.Hans walked in front and Roan followed him.As they moved inside the fence, they saw an old and shabby but clean village.The kids were looking at him with eyes filled with curiosity.The ladies pulled those kids into their embrace.It was a really peaceful scenery.\u2018I did well in protecting them while putting my life on the line.\u2019He wanted to protect this small and simple happiness.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018To keep protecting this happiness\u2026\u2026..\u2019There was a need to migrate the villagers to a new place, the south.But now, it wasn\u2019t simply to harvest the rich soil.\u2018The monsters migrating to the north was ahead of the timetable that I thought.\u2019Roan knew the reason why the monsters were moving to the north.\u2018There\u2019s not much left for the exodus of Poskein lake.\u2019The lights in his eyes sank down calmly.The Poskein exodus.It was a strange phenomenon that was revealed only after a really long time even in his past life.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan took a long sigh and shook his head.\u2018I\u2019ll have to hurry up a bit more.\u2019It was now time to whip on the running horse.For Roan, Poskein\u2019s exodus was a danger and an opportunity.\u2018And to turn the danger into an opportunity\u2026\u2026..\u2019Several plans flowed down in his head.A red light shined in his clear and deep eyes.*****The exodus of Poskein lake.After the war between Rinse and Byron kingdom, the continent folded in a period of safety for a moment.The kingdoms that waged war concentrated on cleaning it up, and the ones that didn\u2019t wage war focused on their livings.At that moment.Monsters started to pour out from Poskein lake to the ground.The four kingdoms surrounding Poskein lake couldn\u2019t act properly at the sudden phenomenon and because of that, the region near the lake ended up getting destroyed.The four kingdoms mobilized their forces late and went up to subjugate the monsters, and only after three months of war could they exterminate all of their enemies.The four kingdoms that were each estranged with each other started to work together in this opportunity.At first, the investigation team researched the reason why the monsters started to pour out to the ground so suddenly.However, even after spending eight years on it, they couldn\u2019t reveal any clear reasons.Then Ferb, who was the librarian from the kingdom of Estia\u2019s library, found out one interesting thing.And it was that in a historical book that was in a romero in the library, the \u2018continental movement\u2019 was mentioned several times. Written in it, the \u2018continental movement\u2019 mentioned about the monsters from Poskein Lake pouring out into the land.Although there wasn\u2019t any specific reason written in it, things about the omens were recorded in detail.And one of the omens was that the water of Poskein lake, that was supposed to provide water to the soil of the Istel kingdom\u2019s ground, started to flow out into the sea through a passage; making the harvest decrease. Also, it mentioned that an unknown disease would spread rampantly.The next omen was that the monsters near Poskein lake moved to the sides to get further away from the lake.The romero was recording this phenomenon of Poskein lake as the \u2018Poskin exodus\u2019.Only then did the research teams of the four kingdoms realize that the decrease in harvests of the Istel kingdom and the unknown movements of the monsters were all due to the Poskein exodus.\u2018Even the monsters in the region of Tale started to move to the north, evading Poskein lake in the south.\u2019It meant that there wasn\u2019t much time left until the exodus.\u2018The disturbance of the monsters will become more severe every time.\u2019As a result, the northern Tale region wasn\u2019t a safe place anymore.If the three villages were scattered like this, there was a high probability in giving serious burdens to the defense system.\u2018It\u2019s safer to migrate them to a new village.\u2019The village that was being developed in the south had a proper defense and headquarters where the centurion squads could stay at.In the position of the villagers, rather than entrusting their lives to a sloppy fence, watch tower, and inexperienced guards, it was safer to migrate to a new village.And even if that place was closer to Poskein lake.\u201cChief. What I want to tell you today is related to migration.\u201dRight after he finished saying that, Han\u2019s face became solid.\u201cDo, do you want to kick us out?\u201dHe had an uneasy expression.At those words, Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.\u201cNo. We want to migrate the residents in the north to the south.\u201d\u201cTo the south?\u201dThese were words that he hadn\u2019t thought would come out at all.Roan slowly nodded.\u201cYes. To the south.\u201dHe explained for a long while the reasons why they should migrate to the south in great detail.The fertile ground, houses provided with no compensation, a safe defensive system.And at the end he emphasized that the northern region would stop being a safe zone because of the commotion of the monsters.But of course, he didn\u2019t talk about the Poskein exodus.\u201cMmm\u2026\u2026\u201dHans fell into his thoughts while he shut his mouth.He couldn\u2019t decide this alone.\u201cFor now, I will consult with the villagers.\u201d\u201cYes. Talk and debate the time you need and decide. And if perhaps\u2026\u2026\u201dRoan paused the last words for a moment and continued speaking.\u201cIt would be better to leave the region of Tale momentarily for the ones that don\u2019t want to migrate to the south.\u201d\u201cIs it because of the disturbance of the monsters?\u201dHans asked carefully.And Roan slowly nodded.\u201cYes. The disturbance would probably become fiercer the more time passes. But there\u2019s a limit in the defensive system of our troop. It\u2019s impossible to guard all three villages set up in the northern region.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dHans smiled bitterly.He took in a deep breath and looked at Roan.\u201cFor now, I will speak with the villages.\u201d\u201cYes. Then, I will be waiting for good news.\u201dRoan stood up from his seat.The things he had to do here had ended.\u2018For now, I\u2019ll have to wait for the decision of the people and go subjugate some monsters.\u2019He was planning to sweep up everything he could before the Poskein lake exodus occurred.\u2018For now, I\u2019ll have to go find the alchemists and blacksmiths.\u2019He had many things to do.He had to build and test the several weapons and tools being developed before the exodus.And it was also time to move Daiv and the sailor alliance that was expanding in force in the village of Perr.\u2018I need to do it one by one.\u2019Roan clenched his fists.He already had some kind of a base.And now was time to raise an axis and build a house.And it was time to protect that house.EndTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s like that because that\u2019s not it. We have to put 20 steel pieces more!\u201d\u201cIf we do that, the durability decreases and only the weight increases!\u201d\u201cJust believe in me and do it once.\u201d\u201cDo you think I was deceived by those words once or twice? Hmph.\u201dA hot workshop.Two people that gave completely different impressions were raising their voices.The middle aged man with white skin was Oden.He was an alchemist that specialized in the combination of minerals.The middle aged man facing Oden was another middle aged man with a red face, called Vixx.He was considered to be one of the best blacksmiths.The two people were following Roan\u2019s orders to make a lighter but stronger weapon and were combining forces.The problem was that their thoughts were too different and that the clashing of opinions was too severe.\u201cBut you don\u2019t know, so try it once! You just have to do what I tell you to do so!\u201d\u201cIf you want to do it that much do it yourself!\u201dThe voices became louder.The surrounding blacksmiths clicked their tongues and shook their heads.Then, a shadow appeared in the entrance.\u201cHuh?!\u201dThe surrounding blacksmiths bowed with a surprised expression.\u201cTroop commander Roan!\u201dThe person that entered through the entrance was none other than Roan.After he returned from the village of the north he went to find some blacksmiths.\u2018They are also hard working today.\u2019Roan looked at Oden and Vixx and smiled.Although it seemed like they would hit each other any time, he knew that they were actually sharing their opinions.\u2018I was also taken by them at first.\u2019He sweated cold sweat trying to calm them down.But it didn\u2019t mean that the fierce quarrel disappeared just because he did that.In the end, he just left them be and little by little, results started to show in.\u2018After they fight like they would kill each other, they cleanly order things while drinking alcohol.\u2019The two people were a good match for each other.\u201cOden. Vixx.\u201dRoan moved his feet and called the two of them.\u201cAh! Troop commander.\u201d\u201cTroop commander. Have you come?\u201dAlthough Roan was much younger than them, the ranks were clear.The two people belonged to the alliance of alchemists and skilled people but in the first place, they were an institution belonging to a branch of Amaranth troop.\u201cYou are also fierce today.\u201dAt those words, the two people scratched their heads as if it was embarrassing.Roan looked around the workshop and continued saying.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming time we have to start preparing. What happened with what I asked you last time?\u201dA soft voice but with strength.Vixx opened his two eyes roundly.\u201cAh! The new product is out.\u201dThey hurriedly got to the inner part of the workshop and then took out a shapeless armor and a round shield.The armor was quite ordinary and the shield had a size to barely be able to cover your upper body and it was even thin.The two of them were of a black color and the texture was smooth.\u201cWe did make it as you told us for now, but will the size of this shield of any use?\u201dIt meant that it was too small.If you covered your head, it revealed all your body, and if you curled up to protect your body it revealed your abdomen and the lower parts.Roan made an eye sign as if it was fine.\u201cAhem.\u201dVixx put on the armor and shield while clearing his throat.The shield was well fixed on his left wrist.\u201cNow, look.\u201dVixx moved his body everywhere with a nervous expression.He showed movements of swinging the shield and blocking and then moved his arm behind his back.Then.Click.The shield took place at his back with the sound of metal.Behind him, a hanger in his back interlocked firmly with a hanger at the insides of the shield.Vixx turned back and showed his back.\u201cJust like you said, we made the shield so it could be attachable. Although it\u2019s gonna be quite difficult before getting proficient. Even i\u2019m failing 6 out of 10 times.\u201dHe extended his arm again and moved the shield sideways.Click.The hangers loosened up with the sound of metal and the shield separated.Vixx took posture once more and lowered his stance.\u201cAnd lastly\u2026\u2026..\u201dHis right hand hid behind the shield.Srung!A nice feeling sound of metal.At the same time, a small sword the size of a forearm appeared.\u201cWe hid one small sword.\u201dThe demonstrations ended.Roan nodded and clapped.\u201cAmazing.\u201dHis mouth rose.\u2018It\u2019s a bit different to what Ian Phillips designed but if it\u2019s this much it\u2019s still amazing.\u2019The use of a small shield and the small sword.It was one of the parts the genius strategist Ian focused on experimenting with.\u2018When others were developing a longer spear, heavier sword, an arrow that could be fired longer, Ian rather focused on developing a short weapon that was light and yet strong.\u2019Thanks to that, Rinse kingdom could show an overwhelming strength at close combat.\u2018If on top of this I can also combine the weapons of the other continents and kingdoms\u2026\u2026..\u2019The strongest troop in history may be born.But one unfortunate thing.\u2018I just vaguely know the shape. I don\u2019t know with what principles, ingredients, or methods those things were made.\u2019Those things were parts that the alchemists and blacksmiths had to fill in.And because of that, he had gathered them faster than anyone and wasn\u2019t petty on the inversions.\u201cFirst, you will have to mass produce that shield.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dVixx hit his shield with his right hand as if it was no problem at all.Roan smiled satisfactorily and nodded.\u201cThank you everyone for following an unreasonable order.\u201dRight before he finished saying that, Owen shook both of his hands.\u201cWe are rather thankful for letting us research as much as we want.\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s the first time we got treated like this since we were born.\u201dVixx followed up.Roan slightly bowed towards those people.He wasn\u2019t simply investing on them.Roan and Amaranth troop members treated and respected them in a human way.\u201cLet\u2019s keep working hard.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words Oden and Vixx clenched their fists.\u201cBelieve in us!\u201dA confident expression and voice.Roan of the Amaranth troop, Oden of the alchemists guilds, Vixx of the skilled people association.The three people looked at each other and smiled.*****\u201cThat\u2019s not it. The angle you are stepping in is wrong.\u201dRoan\u2019s voice rang in the training ground.Amaranth troop members were tightly nervous.They swung their spear while standing up in a firm line.Pat!Every time the spear split the air, a sharp sound was heard.\u2018They are certainly having it difficult.\u2019Roan was teaching ROan\u2019s spearmanship to the spearmen.And he even taught the infantry, cavalry men and archers some separate things he knew.Although the level of it was low compared to his spearmanship, even so it was a must to teach to normal soldiers.\u2018I\u2019m selecting new Squad commanders based on the merits until now and their progress on training.\u2019Stuck water rots.Roan wanted to make a system that could promote anyone to a higher rank if they only had the abilities and capabilities to do so.\u2018Reasonable and fair competition develops everyone.\u2019But even so, he didn\u2019t think of throwing away the soldiers that fell behind.He was planning to teach them separately while putting in a little bit more of effort.Using carrots and whips at the same time.\u201cYour spear fell! Put more strength in your arms!\u201dRoan yelled one more time with all his strength.He could kind of see that the entire troop was becoming stronger.Then, one man appeared at the entrance of the training ground.A really familiar face.\u2018Pens.\u2019He was Chris\u2019s right hand and the vice president of the agency.Roan entrusted Austin with the training and moved.\u201cPens.\u201d\u201cTroop commander.\u201dPens lightly saluted and put a smile.Roan patted his shoulders and went towards his office.\u201cIs Chris well?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s really busy right now.\u201dPens smiled brightly and replied.Roan put an awkward smile.\u201cI feel sorry for him.\u201dIt was Roan that asked him things that took too much effort.But Pens shook his head.\u201cNo. He\u2019s having a lot of fun right now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad then.\u201dRoan let out a short sigh and then got inside his office.Pens took out a thick pile of papers as if he was waiting for it.It was the gathered and analyzed information centered in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom.Roan lightly looked at it and then looked at Pens.\u201cAnything in particular?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026..\u201dPens hesitated for a moment and then continued saying.\u201cI\u2019m talking about Montea mountain.\u201dIf it\u2019s Montea mountain, it was the mountain they bought a mining right through the orders of Roan.\u201cEven so, we think it was in vain.\u201dThey had roamed several places of the mountain for 5 months but they didn\u2019t discover any mine or minerals.Roan asked back with a composed expression.\u201cWhat are the thoughts of the others?\u201d\u201cFor now chief Chris and the staff of our agency all judge that it was in vain. But\u2026.\u201dPens paused for a moment and then said in a low voice.\u201cThe responsible one, mister Ford, seems to think in another way. He says he\u2019s getting a feeling. That there certainly is something in Montea mountain\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cSomething?\u201dRoan copied his words.Pens smiled bitterly.\u201cHe\u2019s asking to increase the inversions. To dig deeper\u2026..\u201dJust by looking at the situation, it was no different to a helpless proposal.But Roan, that knew that there was an incredible sized magic stone mine put a proud smile.\u2018Ford. He\u2019s a friend with quite good senses.\u2019Roan hit the end of the table with his fingers.\u201cGood. Tell Chris to increase the inversions.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dPens asked back with a surprised expression.He said in an urgent voice.\u201cWith the current situation, we can\u2019t have that much of a leisure. The jewels you have given us has already been invested in the agency of Amaranth troop, the fishermen association, alchemist guild, blacksmith guild and the five businesses. THe incomes of our side is the income coming in from the four businesses excluding the mining one\u2026\u2026.\u201dJust maintaining the current situation was tight.And Roan also knew about that situation quite well.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We will be lessening the incomes to Amaranth troop momentarily.\u201dStill a composed voice and expression.But his eyes were filled with certainness.\u201cInvest in mister Ford. He will soon show some accomplishments.\u201dThe decision has been made.Pens took in a deep breath and bowed.\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d\u201cAnd tell mr. Daiv of the fishermen association to prepare to move out.\u201d\u201cPrepare to move?\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, Pens tilted his head.\u201cYeah. I\u2019m planning to make a port in the lake after subjugating the monsters of the south.\u201dHis eyes shone.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dPens let out a low exclamation.He knew from way before that Roan showed big interest in Poskein lake.\u201cI will tell him that.\u201dPens wrote down the contents thoroughly.Roan stood up from his seat.Although he wanted to have a meal with Pens, he didn\u2019t have the leisure right now.\u201cNext time, let\u2019s have a drink together.\u201d\u201cYes. I will be waiting for you.\u201dRoan and Pens grabbed their hands.A strong heat was felt.Then.Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!The sound of the bell was heard from the HQ.Jiing! Jiing! Jiing!Followed by that, the heavy sound of the zing was heard.Bell and jing.It was a sign alarming about the appearance of monsters.\u201cI, is it monsters?\u201dPens asked back with a little nervous expression.Roan just nodded and then opened the door.At that moment, wind came in.That was the wind of the boiling spirit.\u201cSir! We finished preparations to charge out!\u201dAustin saluted and bowed.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dPens opened his eyes roundly.He let out an exclamation after seeing the firm and solid formation in front of his eyes.\u2018I heard the sound of the bell just now but they already finished preparations\u2026\u2026..\u2019He had never seen a troop moving this well until now.But the expressions of Roan and Amaranth troop were composed and calm.Roan hurriedly got on his horse and grabbed Travias spear.Cheng!The metal stick transformed to a long spear with the sound of metal.\u201cMonsters from the southeast are moving to the northwest!\u201dAustin\u2019s report.Roan nodded shortly and looked at the troop members.The tightly shut lips and eyes.They were already the strong among the strong.\u201cAmaranth troop!\u201dRoan raised the Travias spear he was holding in his right hand highly.\u201cCharge!\u201dEndTL: Sorry about the irregular releases.

Understood!\u201dAustin, Semi and the other centurions replied in one voice and then they each their own squads and disappeared.Roan just looked at that.\u2018Mm.\u2019He saw the looks of the injured soldiers.A bitter feeling.\u2018If we just had a shaman, it could have been of help in healing them.\u2019But there was no way a shaman would be dispatched in this barren land.\u2018I have to at least set the weight of healing clearly.\u2019It was a problem concerning the lives of the soldiers.Roan thought of several stifling things and then moved.The place he was moving to was the office of the agency.There was something he had to check before the conference.\u2018It would be nice if we had a bit more time before Poskein exodus.\u2019His steps became faster.An earnest flame appeared in his two eyes.*****\u201cThere aren\u2019t as many fallen soldiers as we thought.\u201d\u201cAnd the injuries ones are mostly ordinary.\u201dThe reports of the centurions followed.The battles were certainly complete victory and there were small dead ones.But the expressions of Roan and the centurions were dark.Austin hesitated a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201cWe are certainly winning several battles and the number of dead soldiers and injured ones is low. But at most there are two or three battles occurring in a day. The injuries are getting accumulated while not knowing that they are getting wet by the drizzle.\u201dSemi followed.\u201cAnd the exhaustion of the soldiers is at a dangerous level. If we keep this, the morale will dive down.\u201dRoan just nodded.He also had the same thoughts as them.\u201cIsn\u2019t there a good method?\u201dAt Roan\u2019s question, everyone shut their mouths.However it wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t have any methods to propose.It was because they were all difficult methods so they couldn\u2019t say it.Roan looked at the faces of the centurions and said.\u201cWhat about bringing residents of other regions?\u201dWith no need of going far, there were quite a lot of residents wandering about in the territory of count Chase.On top of that, most of the wandering people moved in families.If they were provided with a land to farm and a house, they would be able to bring at least one adult son to the troop.\u2018After Poskein exodus concludes, we will have to increase the number of residents anyways.\u2019Taking that into account, brining residents of other territories was the most effective.But.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a small scaled one, but a huge scaled one won\u2019t be even worth talking about.\u201d\u201cThe nobles and lords won\u2019t just watch them leave.\u201dSeveral skeptical voices were heard.Even so, as Roan started by saying his thoughts, the other centurions also started to say what they had thought.Semi scratched the tip of the table and said.\u201cHow about buying slaves? If we tell them that they can become normal residents they will fight quite valiantly.\u201dTane, that was listening to it, shook his head.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the leisure to do that right now.\u201dMost of the troop\u2019s income was being invested in Ford\u2019s mining business.Then, Pete said with a rough voice.\u201cHow about making a deal with mercenaries? After war ends, they won\u2019t have a lot of jobs so we will be able to use them with quite the small amount of money.\u201dAt those words several centurions nodded.But Austin had his doubts.\u201cAnyways, we still need quite the money for the mercenaries. On top of that, if we bring them to our troop the morale will drop and there\u2019s a high chance for the balance to become a mess.\u201dIt was the truth.It was frequent for the rough and free mercenaries to make everything messy.\u2018Mercenaries are just like double edged blades.\u2019Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018If you used them well they become a big weapon, but if you make a mistake they can cut your hand.\u2019And really deeply at that.The conference continued but a clear method couldn\u2019t be thought of.And the pondering deepened like that.Then.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe one that talked hardly was Harrison.The youngest centurion and with the least experience.He looked at his surroundings and carefully said.\u201cHow about asking a favor to the Lancephil family?\u201dAt those words, Semi shook his head with a stiff face.\u201cIf the soldiers of count Lancephil come, then the weight of commanding is shifted to him and it rather becomes more comp\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, what I mean\u2026\u2026\u201dHarrison shook his hands and interrupted him.He looked at Roan and said.\u201cHow about bringing residents of count Lancephil\u2019s territory?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe centurions let out low exclamations.And that was the same for Roan.\u2018As it\u2019s a migration inside his territory, there won\u2019t be any problems.\u2019In the territory of Lancephil, there weren\u2019t as many wandering people compared to other places.Because of that, they had to migrate residents taking place in several regions.But even so, it was a much easier method than bringing wandering people of other territories.Only, they needed Io\u2019s permission.\u2018For now, I will have to send him a letter.\u2019If there was even a little bit of success probabilities, they had to try it.\u2018I\u2019m also trying the other methods.\u2019Buying slaves, migration of people from other territories, contract with mercenaries.Although you couldn\u2019t know if it would succeed or not, it was better to try many things.His head spun.\u201cThe centurions are to combine all the opinions and proceed to do it.\u201dRoan looked at the faces of the centurions.\u201cCenturions, take care on the health and the morale of your members.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAustin, Semi and the others all bowed.Roan clenched his fists.\u201cIt will be a difficult time. But our Amaranth troop\u2026\u2026.\u201dStrength was put in his voice.\u201cNever gives up.\u201dThe centurions gulped dry saliva and bowed.There was a resolute look in their faces.\u2018Let\u2019s trust on troop commander.\u2019Their loyalty and the loyalty of the troop members were absolute.\u2018Whatever trial comes, if we have troop commander Roan we will be able to overcome it all.\u2019A strange heat roamed in the conference room.And that was the hot military discipline.*****First, Roan wrote a letter for Io.Contents about the migration of residents and the increase in the number of his troop members was written in it.At the same time he ordered the staff of the agency, working in the eastern region, to buy slaves, form a contract with mercenaries and push forward the migration of other regions the most secretly possible.As they still didn\u2019t have financial leisure, the speed of it wasn\u2019t that fast.But Roan was still satisfied just with that.Because the situation was improving and getting better even if it was by a little bit.Puk!Roan\u2019s fist crushed the trunk of a tree.\u201cWhew.\u201dA long sigh came out.The surrounding was a real mess.The trees composing the wood couldn\u2019t stand the hits and kicks and collapsed.Roan focused on training in Reid\u2019s battling techniques in a forest near the troop.\u2018Troop training is important, but I can\u2019t slack in personal training.\u2019He was taking care of many things at once, so he didn\u2019t have time for personal training.Although he still was training on Flamdor mana technique, Roan\u2019s spearmanship and the several techniques he remembered in his head, he had kind of neglected in the technique that made Reid as the strongest person in earth.It was partly because he had never encountered the technique itself, but also because the level of the technique was too high that with Roan\u2019s current level, there were several parts that were difficult to understand.\u2018Although it\u2019s still impossible to execute a perfect technique\u2026\u2026..\u2019Even when he had just learned the basics of the movements, flow, operation of the mana technique, he had gotten a lot stronger than before.The movements transformed to have no unnecessary movements, and the mana in his body became smoother and he was able to operate it much faster.\u2018The level of the operation is at the level of a knight?\u2019The level of Roan\u2019s mana grew exponentially after the past overflow of mana.He passed the level of an apprentice or a basic knight and became at the level of an intermediate knight.But the strength of his actual mana was at the level of a superior knight.Flamdor mana technique was that amazing.\u2018If I can train a bit more in it, I can emanate an aura.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t just be covering mana in his spear, but he would be able to condense his mana to emanate aura.If he could only do that, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone able to match Roan in level of mana excluding the knights of the royal palace.Only.\u2018There\u2019s no spear technique able to bring the strength of this aura properly.\u2019Roan\u2019s original spear technique was Pierce\u2019s spearmanship used by normal soldiers that didn\u2019t have mana.Because of that, he had a regret that it couldn\u2019t maximize the strength of an aura.\u2018This is the reason why I have to focus on training in Reid\u2019s battle techniques.\u2019It was the only martial art that could let him display the real strength of his mana.Roan took in a deep breath and clenched his fists.Pubububuk!Five fists were followed.Boom!The tree that was holding in finally collapsed.As he shook his hands, pieces of wood fell.Then, something entered Roan\u2019s sight.\u2018Mm?\u2019As he focused on his sight, he saw the scenery that was far away as if it was in front of his eyes.\u2018Troop?\u2019A troop was approaching the HQ.He could see the symbol in the flag that was at the front.A really familiar symbol.\u2018Lancephil family?\u2019It was an unexpected entrance.\u2018It should be before the letter reached him.\u2019Roan tilted his head and moved.The HQ was right in front of him.The guard, that confirmed the flag of the Lancephil family rang the bell.Deng! Deng! Deng!Right before he entered the HQ, Austin and Semi came running.Austin made a short salute and opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s the flag of Lancephil family.\u201dRoan nodded slowly instead of replying.\u201cWhat will it be so suddenly?\u201dSemi asked back with an expression full of curiousness.But even Roan had nothing to say.He took in a deep breath and then laid the order.\u201cLet\u2019s prepare to welcome the guests.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAustin and Semi answered in one voice.The two people moved busily with the soldiers.Thanks to that, the preparations finished faster than thought.The centurions and troop members arrived behind Roan.An overwhelming sight.He saw the flag of Lancephil family through the open gates.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019At that moment, Roan let out a low exclamation.Below the flag.The person at the front leading the group.He was really familiar.Roan let out a short sigh.\u2018Count Lancephil.\u2019A smile appeared in his face.The person appearing with the flag of the Lancephil family.It was none other than Io Lancephil.*****\u201cThe setting sun in the region of Tale has a different feeling.\u201dIo looked at the west sky while holding his luggage in his back.A red sunset was spread following the mountains.He was amazed while looking at the solid and high fences and watchtower surrounding the HQ.\u201cIt\u2019s a really solid and well made camp.\u201dAt those words, Roan that was one step back, bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s an excessive compliment.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s really, really amazing.\u201dIo put strength in his eyes as if it was true.ROan just smiled faintly instead of replying.\u2018To have reached this point in only 7 months\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Io looked at Roan and got amazed.\u2018I did well on sending him here.\u2019He had brought the knights and soldiers and touring the eastern region.Because the movements of the monsters in the region that was close to the lake got fiercer.They had visited the region of Tale after thinking of subjugating the monsters.\u2018I thought that the situation would be worse\u2026\u2026..\u2019Monster heaven.Because of that, he judged that the movement of the monsters would be severe.And even if that didn\u2019t happen, he thought that the impoverished and shallow land would be a mess.But Io\u2019s thoughts completely slipped off the mark.The region of Tale was much safer and peaceful than any other region of the east.When Io entered with his group, he hadn\u2019t seen even one monster in the region of Tale.\u2018I wondered if it was really the region of Tale.\u2019Io smiled.He looked at ROan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u2018This is all thanks to Roan. Roan did something that couldn\u2019t be done for several years in only 7 months.\u2019Io grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cRoan.\u201d\u201cYes. Sir count.\u201d\u201cReally thank you.\u201dAt the sudden words, Roan got a bit perplexed.\u201cWha, what are you thankful of\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the staggering words, Io put a bright smile.\u201cFor confirming me that my eyes of looking at people wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low exclamation.Io hit Roan\u2019s shoulders and continued saying.\u201cWhile I was coming here, I received a letter.\u201dHe took out an envelope from his chest.It was the letter Roan had sent him through the agency.\u2018Ah, they met in the middle.\u2019Roan had a nervous expression.He was worried about the reaction Io would show.But in the other hand, Io\u2019s expression was really bright.He smiled brightly without thinking much and nodded.\u201cI will migrate a group of residents to the region of Tale just like you wanted.\u201dIo looked at his surroundings and said.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a safer place than this, even inside my territory.\u201dOn top of that, the exemption of taxes and providing of houses.In the place of the residents, it was a condition that could pull them in.\u201cReal thanks.\u201dRoan bowed at the clear decision of Io.It was a moment that a big problem was solved.Io looked at that Roan and put a faint smile.\u2018Migrate people to the region of Tale\u2026\u2026..?\u2019His smile became even denser.\u2018That was just what I wanted. And if perhaps Roan perfectly subjugates the monster of this region\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019His eyes shone.\u2018I will take Roan to the royal palace.\u2019Roan wasn\u2019t an existence that could be left as a troop commander anymore.Although he did commit violence against a noble and was a big sin, perfectly subjugating the monsters in the region of Tale was a big merit enough to completely pardon his sins and not be enough with that.\u2018Roan.\u2019Io\u2019s eyes became soft.His eyes stayed in Roan\u2019s face.\u2018I will show you a completely new world. No\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019A feeling that his chest beat and his blood circulated faster.\u2018I will open a completely new world in front of you.\u2019EndTL: Regular chTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Deng! Deng! Jing! Jing! Jing!The sound of drums and the jing was heard.\u201cWhat is this sound?\u201dIo asked back with a strange look.And Roan lightly bowed.\u201cIt seems like a beacon has been triggered. It means that monsters appeared.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dIo let out a low exclamation.Roan saluted like that.\u201cI will prepare to march out.\u201d\u201cAh, right. Go quickly.\u201dIo lately nodded.Roan moved away after that.Quick movements.Io looked at his back and put a proud expression.\u2018He\u2019s reliable.\u2019He felt really secure.Io raised his head and looked at the sky.The sky that was black even until the afternoon, it was soon clear and bright.A feeling that it cleared up your chest.\u201cThe sky is really nice.\u201dIo\u2019s voice flowed with the wind.*****\u201cSo he\u2019s looking for mercenaries, right?\u201d\u201cNot only that. Although it\u2019s small scaled, it seems like he\u2019s also buying slaves.\u201dThe person that was talking like if he was whispering was the chandler of the Chase family, Hoose.\u201cHmph!\u201dA displeased look.The man that snorted was count Jonathan chase.\u201cHe was subjugating the monsters in the region of Tale successfully?\u201d\u201cYes. According to the reports coming up every day, it seems like he has made up some remarkable accomplishments.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really a thorn like bastard.\u201dJonathan chewed his lower lip.Bang!He smacked down on the table and then made a gesture to the chandler.The chandler approached with a nervous expression.\u201cIf we leave him be like this, he will become the main underling of that bastard Io.\u201dAt Jonathan\u2019s words, the chandler just nodded.\u201cOn top of that, looking at how the situation is turning there\u2019s a high possibility his sin gets completely pardoned.\u201dJonathan\u2019s voice became a bit low.A fierce light appeared in his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s good to thoroughly step on a leaf that has the possibilities.\u201dThe chandler still kept on nodding.Jonathan said in a whispering voice.\u201cMake a fake mercenary group with bright guys and send them to that bastard. I will have to plant some spies.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe chandler let out a low exclamation.Jonathan touched his chin with one hand and put on a fishy smile.\u201cMake them perform great and get in his eyes. Make them obtain his trust and get important roles and become the underlings for that bastard. And Roan, if that bastard gets to enter below Io then\u2026\u2026 Kuku.\u201dA strange laugh came out.Several plans got formed in his head.The chandler looked at that look for a moment and then shook his head.\u201cThen, I will go to prepare as you ordered me to.\u201dHe moved his feet and got out of the room.Jonathan, that got left alone, crossed his arms and put a weird smile.\u2018Io. I will make the roots slowly rot.\u2019His chest kept heaving up.That was an excitement he couldn\u2019t control.Bang!Jonathan smacked down on the table once again as if it was a habit.His entire palm became numb.And the smile in his face became even denser.*****The subjugation of the monsters was proceeding as planned.Roan and Amaranth troop started to push back the monsters of the southeast as if hunting them.Although the monsters fled from the lake to the north, they got hopelessly exterminated by the troop that were already waiting for them.Because of that, Amaranth troop could face the monsters more easily than before.\u201cI can see Poskein lake.\u201dAustin pointed at the front and yelled.Roan\u2019s mouth slightly rose.\u2018We finally came up to here.\u2019They still hadn\u2019t completely secured the southern region.However, there was a need to take over the lake a bit faster.\u2018We have to move over the sailor association.\u2019Roan wasn\u2019t thinking of simply waiting the monsters until Poskein exodus occurred.\u2018But rather, we will charge over to the lake.\u2019Poskein lake had several islands in it, deserving of it\u2019s huge size.Roan was glaring at Exos island among them, located at the center of the lake.\u2018I\u2019m going to use Exos island as the port and control the whole central part.\u2019If it happened just like his plans, he would be able to secure a safe port and use it as the base.\u201cAustin.\u201d\u201cYes, commander.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s call, Austin approached and bowed.\u201cWe are going to set up a camp. I\u2019m going to build a village here.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAustin didn\u2019t show a weird look or asked back, he just replied.For him, Roan\u2019s orders were absolute.Soon, Austin and the centurions started to set up a camp near the lake.Roan looked at that for a moment and then turned the head of his horse.\u2018I\u2019m entrusting this place to Austin.\u2019Him and the remaining troop members had something separate to do.\u2018I have to check the villages built south of the HQ.\u2019Fortunately, Hans and the villagesmen all moved to the south with Roan\u2019s offer.But of course, it wasn\u2019t that all the villagesmen had migrated.\u2018Originally, I wanted to evacuate the remaining people outside Tale region\u2026\u2026.\u2019But now, there was no need to.Because thousands of people newly migrated with Io\u2019s order.Roan settled them on a village of the north and established a new troop with the adult men as the selected ones.But there was absolutely no force.If the situation turned difficult he would have to resort to force, but there was no need to do that right now.Because he offered quite an exceptional deal, quite a lot of men volunteered to get in the troop.Roan put on a minimum condition of checking them thoroughly through a test and that only the ones that qualified could enter the troop.And that number was close to 1000.A number that was enough to create a new troop.\u2018But even so, I can\u2019t deploy them to battle.\u2019Roan made up a new training ground near the HQ and trained the newcomers.And surprisingly enough, the one in charge of the training was Glenn.\u2018If it\u2019s Glenn with the meticulous personality, I thought that he was going to be able to teach the newcomers well\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019And Roan\u2019s judgement hit the mark.Glenn performed more outstandingly than he thought.It was seen as if he had talent on teaching others.\u2018When the size of the troop becomes bigger than now, I will have to entrust him with the training grounds altogether.\u2019Roan\u2019s mouth rose.The migration of people and reinforcements for his troop.Establishments of new villages.Everything was getting solved as his plans.\u2018On top of that, I now have some leisure\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019It was thanks to Io migrating the residents and providing with funds.In the position of Io, all the money he was pouring went all to Roan and the troop, so he didn\u2019t have any burdens at all.\u2018Now\u2026\u2026\u2019Roan looked at the ground.The bulky ground that was spread as it wanted.\u2018Is it turn to set up a main road.\u2019Building a road in all of Tale region was impossible.\u2018I\u2019m making a highway with the HQ as the center to all the four cardinal points. We will be able to move quicker only by connecting the villages.\u2019If only that happened, even if Poskein exodus occurred he would be able to respond to it more actively.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018I have to increase the number of alchemists and skilled people.\u2019As constructions were being operated in several places, they lacked in workers.And the more time passed, the more difficult it became.But it wasn\u2019t hard at all.Rather, he felt more of happiness.\u2018And end spearman ended up becoming the chief of a territory.\u2019Although his rank was merely troop commander and on top of that a sinner because of committing violence against a noble, if he just blocked this exodus well he could aim for an even higher place.\u2018I can do it.\u2019Roan clenched his two fists.Red light shone in his eyes.THe sky was still clear without any clouds.It just seemed like it was predicting Roan\u2019s upcoming days.*****\u201cOne! Two! Three!\u201d\u201cHap! Hap!\u201dLoud noises.Hundreds of soldiers were training in the training ground.\u201cAgain! You are doing it again!\u201dThe one yelling in front of them was Glenn.His usual look of being soft and gentle had completely disappeared.His eyes were fierce and his attitude was confident.\u2018He\u2019s a completely different person when teaching newcomers.\u2019Roan, that was looking at him at the back, put a faint smile.Roan had free time in a long while and so came to the training grounds where the newcomers were at.They all had shields at their backs.\u2018Thanks to the blacksmiths working hard, we could fit the numbers.\u2019Amaranth troop was now possible to do a charge with using the shield with a small sword.At first, everyone was awkward with it, but they quickly got accustomed to it thanks to troop training and personal training.\u2018As soon as this training ends, I will dispatch the newcomers to the villages.\u2019He couldn\u2019t bring them to a real battle at the start.Right now, even one troop member was precious.Roan checked on the training of the newcomers for a while and then slowly moved.As he was just looking, his body felt all itchy so he couldn\u2019t endure it anymore.\u2018Do I also have to\u2026\u2026. huh?\u2019His feet moving towards the HQ stopped.\u2018Pens?\u2019A welcoming face.Pens, that was at Pavor castle along with Chris, was walking from far away.His expression was really bright.After a while.\u201cTroop commander Roan.\u201dPens approached and bowed.\u201cPens. Why did you come all the way here?\u201dThere was still 10 days remaining to submit the regular report.Pens smiled brightly and answered.\u201cMister Ford has finally done it.\u201dAn excited voice and expression.\u201cHe has discovered a magic stone mine in Montea mountain!\u201dHis voice became louder.\u2018Ah, he finally discovered it.\u2019Roan was proud, but didn\u2019t show it.He nodded with a calm and composed attitude.\u201cGood. Mister Ford will be able to put down a bit of his burden.\u201d\u201cYes? Is that all?\u201dPens rather asked back with a surprised expression.His usual calm expression had completely disappeared.\u201cIt\u2019s not steel or gold, but magic stones. Magic stones! Do you know how amazing of a discovery is this?\u201dPens even had saliva coming out of his mouth and explained things earnestly.Roan looked at that and smiled.As he always saw his calm side and now saw a really excited look, he felt good.Then.\u201cTroop commander!\u201dA familiar voice was heard from far away.Keep was running from the HQ\u2019s.Keep was in charge of Amaranth troop\u2019s information squad separately from the agency.Differently from the agency that checked on the entire territory, Keep\u2019s information squad only checked on one place.Poskein lake.\u201cPant. Pant. Pant.\u201dKeep caught his breath while grabbing his knees.Roan didn\u2019t hurry him and just waited.\u201cTr, troop commander.\u201dKeep said and looked at Roan.Roan slowly nodded meaning to speak.Keep\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cPo, poskein lake\u2026\u2026..\u201dA slightly trembling voice.\u201cPoskein lake is boiling up. No\u2026\u2026\u201dHe gulped up dry saliva.\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s boiling.\u201dRoan, that was listening to Keep\u2019s words, slowly closed his eyes.His eyes slightly trembled.An expression that was kind of nervous.\u2018Finally\u2026\u2026..\u2019Roan clenched his fists.\u2018Poskein exodus is occurring.\u2019EndTL: Sponsored chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Already more than 10 carriages entered the palace.\u201d\u201cAnd really urgently at that.\u201dTheir eyes following the carriages moved to the high palace.There was a fear they couldn\u2019t hide in their eyes.the capital of Miller was covered up in an uneasy air.Because tens of noble\u2019s carriages entered the royal palace for exactly two days.But this kind of thing had only happened once.The invasion of Istel and Byron kingdom.At that time, the big noble families gathered to the palace to have a meeting.\u201cIs war going to happen again?\u201dWords you didn\u2019t want to hear got out from someone\u2019s mouth.\u201cEi, that can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd a denying sound was heard afterwards.But the nervousness and fear in their eyes became even denser.Gulp.Their apples of adam shook roughly.The citizens looked at the palace in a dead silence.*****Bang!The thick door opened up roughly.The person that appeared was an old man wearing luxurious clothes.He was one of the four dukes of Rinse kingdom and the person with the biggest force in the western region of Rinse kingdom, Bradley Webster.\u201cI got late because I was subjugating the monsters in Grain mountain range.\u201dAn urgent voice and expression.He moved his feet and sat in an empty seat.There were already tens of nobles seated in the huge conference room.Bradley and the other dukes were positioned in the upper seats.\u201cLet\u2019s proceed with the meeting.\u201dA voice and expression that wasn\u2019t satisfactory.The center of the upper seats was for the representing noble and at the top of the rank, and in that place duke Edwin Voisa was seated.Edwin and Bradley didn\u2019t seem to be in good terms.No, precisely speaking, among the four dukes Edwin Voisa, Bradley Webster and Liss Kowan had a relationship of political enemies.Only Francis Wilson maintained a good relationship with the other dukes.And that was because of the stifling situation in the royal palace of Rinse kingdom.The current king, Deni Von Rinse, had 7 wives and he obtained one son from three of them.Three princes.Their grandfathers were Edwin, Bradley and Liss.The actual king Deni III wasn\u2019t interested in politics and power.On top of that, he was an improviser and a fickle.Although he wasn\u2019t that bad of a mess, he still wasn\u2019t an excellent one.Compared to him, the three princes had outstanding abilities and their ambition was also great.As they were all born at the same time, based on the situation everyone could become the king.Because of that, the nobles of Rinse kingdom were currently in a battle of strength with Edwin, Bradley and Liss at the center of it.\u201cJust like I told you, monsters got out to the ground from Poskein lake. It\u2019s known that they are all strange and odd monsters and their battle strength is a bit stronger than the ground monsters.\u201dThe report of a noble.Followed by that, another noble said.\u201cThe monsters on the ground are moving to the inner parts of the country evading the lake. Because of that, the damage caused by the monsters isn\u2019t only occurring in the lake, but in the entire kingdom.\u201dSeveral reports were followed.Edwin, that was listening to it still, asked back with a serious expression.\u201cWas the cause revealed?\u201dTHe answer was quick.\u201cBased on the opinions of the residents near the lake, they said that the lake boiled for four days before the monsters poured out. Aside of that, there\u2019s nothing else revealed.\u201dIt meant that in the end they couldn\u2019t find the cause.Then, Bradley that was silent, turned his head and looked at a noble near the upper seats.\u201cI heard that the damage in that region is insignificant\u2026\u2026.\u201dAn existence even a duke of the palace couldn\u2019t speak freely.\u201cYes. Fortunately, we could react quickly.\u201dTHe noble replying modestly.He was none other than Io Lancephil.\u2018This is all because of Roan.\u2019His mouth slightly rose.Actually, it was also a perplexing thing for him that monsters poured out from the lake.But Roan, that was patrolling the region of Tale moved quickly to set up a defensive line and block their advance.Thanks to that, different from the other regions that became a wasteland, Lancephil\u2019s territory didn\u2019t suffer much damage.\u201cYou said that the one that raised this clear merit was called Roan?\u201dBradley continued to show interest.Io nodded and answered.\u201cYes. He\u2019s the troop commander that got remitted to some conditions and is now in charge of the region of Tale.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dSeveral nobles let out low exclamations.They also knew clearly.The performances of Roan and Amaranth troop.\u2018He\u2019s defending one region without damages with only thousands of soldiers?\u2019\u2018From the subjugation of Pedian plain, the war between Istel and Byron kingdom, and the movement of the monsters in Poskein lake. He\u2019s someone i\u2019m hearing the name a lot recently.\u2019\u2018If he only didn\u2019t commit violence against a noble, by now he would be a noble himself?\u2019\u2018He was someone that had clear abilities.\u2019\u2018He is following count Io Lancephil.\u2019\u2018If he crosses over to another side\u2026..He would have to be removed by then.\u2019They all thought about similar but a bit different things.Bradley\u2019s expression brightened up.\u201cI heard that he is achieving victory alone when all the other territories are suffering damages. Actually, now that we started talking about him, aren\u2019t the merits he has achieved until now, amazing? By now, we will be able to completely pardon his sin and entrust him with leading an army in Poskein lake.\u201dAn exception proposal.Bradley was the one with the most affection for Io among the four dukes.Bradley was thinking of being of strength to Io and Roan with this time\u2019s merit.Io bowed.\u201cAs he has plenty of abilities, if you believe and entrust him, I\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen he spoke up to then.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something to decide that urgently.\u201dA cold voice.The one that interrupted him was Edwin.\u2018You thought I would let you do as you pleased.\u2019A fierce light roamed inside his eyes.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s decide on how to suppress the monsters and subjugate them.\u201dThe change of the topic.\u201cThat would be good.\u201dLiss added on as if he was waiting for it.Bradley was about to say one more thing but he decided to shut up.If he made a mistake he could get pincer attacked and get driven to a corner.\u201cNow, if you have any good ideas say it without hesitating.\u201dAt Edwin\u2019s words, the nobles that were being aware started to say their opinions one by one.But when one side said an opinion, another side butted in.A battle of force had started with the dukes as the center.Io, that was looking at the situation, let out a short sigh.\u2018Whew. It\u2019s like this again.\u2019Now, the conference would become a mess because of the battle of force among the dukes.This was the reason why they couldn\u2019t come to a quick conclusion when Istel and Byron kingdom invaded last time.\u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d\u201cThe opinion you said right now is nonsense!\u201dThe voices became louder.Then.The stiffly closed doors opened up.\u201cThe sun of the kingdom, he\u2019s the representative of the god Crea, His majesty Deni III is entering. The vassals loyal to the kingdom are to show your manners.\u201dThe Grand chamberlain Logan Deil hit the floor three times with a huge staff.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dThe nobles that were arguing just now all stood up and bowed.And that was the same for Edwin, Bradley, Liss, and Francas.An old man moved his feet with a smiling face.He stood at the highest seat that could control all of the conference room.It was a seat that was adorned with gold and only the king could sit in.\u201cHohoho. You are all working hard.\u201dDeni III laughed.\u201cIs the conference proceeding well?\u201dA lightly asking question.\u201cYes. Your majesty.\u201dDuke Edwin replied after stepping up and kissing on the ring of Deni III.The luxurious ring was the seal of the king and a symbol of power.\u201cHohoho.\u201dHe once again laughed.But the laughter didn\u2019t last long.The expression of Deni III turned stiff just like the laugh from just now was fake.\u201cWhen I was listening outside you were all cuacking like fucking gooses, and a proper plan didn\u2019t come out but it\u2019s proceeding well?\u201dAt the rebuke of Deni III all the nobles quieted down.However, this cold rage didn\u2019t last long.Deni III was this type of person.\u201cHohoho, that may also be politics. I understand all your burdens.\u201d\u201cWe are ashamed your majesty.\u201dThe nobles replied in one voice.They were all sweating cold sweat.Then, Deni III closed his eyes and put a funny expression.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I was saying, I have a good method.\u201dHe looked at three young men that were standing at his back.The heads of the nobles moved following Deni III head.\u201cAnd that method is these three princes.\u201dThree young people.They were the three princes of Rinse kingdom.Their eyes were deep and clear and they all looked really beautiful.They were all born in the same year, but the month was different.The one at the right of Deni III was the first, Simon Rinse. The second was the one left to Deni, Tommy Rinse, and the one next to him was Kallum Rinse, the third prince.Simon\u2019s grandfather was Bradley, Edwin for Tommy and Liss for Kallum.Deni III smiled brightly and said.\u201cI\u2019m entrusting the subjugation of Poskein lake to these three princes.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dThe nobles that were listening silently put surprised expressions.Deni III continued speaking.\u201cThe north to Simon, the central region to Tommy and the south to Kallum.\u201d\u201cYo, your majesty. The movements of the monsters are too fierce. At the smallest slip, the three princes can get greatly in\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Edwin stood up and expressed his thoughts.\u201cIt seems like duke Voisa doesn\u2019t find us to be trustworthy.\u201dSimon interrupted him with a comic face.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean it that way\u2026\u2026..\u201dEdwin laughed awkwardly and dimmed his last words.Simon smiled brightly and hit his chest.\u201cTrust us. We are confident on doing well.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes\u2026\u2026\u201dEdwin had a confused expression.Deni III, that was looking at that funnily, stood up.\u201cI know that the nobles split up based on following the three princes and fighting among yourselves. Let\u2019s now stop this enmity and go to the battlefield yourselves. I will be giving a big reward to the prince that has the best merits.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dSeveral nobles let out exclamations.A faint smile appeared on the mouth of Deni III.\u201cThe seat of Grand duke in Grain is still empty. You don\u2019t know. What kind of influence will this subjugation have based on the results\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dAt that moment the nobles looked at Deni III with surprised expressions.Grand duke of Grain.It was the land of the god Crea and the best mountain ranges in the kingdom.A land that the successor for the throne was going to get.Until now, Deni III has never named the takeover of the throne.Because of that, the nobles were more than shocked.They were all absentminded.In the other hand, Deni III had a somewhat enjoying expression.He looked at the faces of the nobles and then yelled towards the escorting knights.\u201cLet\u2019s go! Today we are hunting hawks!\u201dA smooth and confident walking.Deni III and the knights disappeared outside the conference room.It really happened in an instant.\u201cYour majesty.\u201d\u201cYour majesty.\u201dThe nobles started to bow late and showed their manners.A heavy silence fell in the conference room for a moment.Just as if a storm has passed by.The three princes in that remained in the conference room put stifled and strange expressions and looked at their faces.\u2018My brothers. Let\u2019s battle as much as we please.\u2019\u2018I have to raise a merit that\u2019s eye catching enough.\u2019\u2018If I make a mistake, I may drop out of the competition.\u2019Stifling thoughts passed in his head.Edwin, that was looking at the situation, cleared his throat.\u201cHm!\u201dThings have already been spilled anyways.\u201cThen. Just like his majesty has said, the three princes will be participating in this subjugation.\u201dHis eyes trembled.And that wasn\u2019t only for Edwin.Bradley\u2019s and Liss\u2019s head became complicated.\u2018I have to make the situation to be the most favorable.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m pouring all the strength of my family.\u2019\u2018I will even have to gather the nobles that crossed a line with me.\u2019The atmosphere in the conference room changed.The outward appearance was as calm as a lake.But below that, a fierce battle was happening.The conference continued night after night like that.******\u2018He\u2019s someone I can\u2019t grasp.\u2019Io looked sideways to his left.A good looking youth riding a good war horse.It was Simon Rinse.\u2018For the prince that was advised by the king to be prince Simon among the three.\u2019After the conference ended, the nobles had a separate meeting with the princes they were supporting.As Io usually followed the inheritance rule, he went to find Simon.And of course, it was also because of his thick friendship with Bradley.Simon revealed that it was himself that made the subjugation plan.But of course, he had never expected that Deni III would also be providing with Grain mountain ranges.\u2018This subjugation became the most important moment for prince Simon.\u2019Even if he didn\u2019t do so, Simon was the person that was most supported by the nobles following the inheritance rule.If he only raised a big merit in this battle, he would become much advantageous.By then, no one would be able to stop Simon.\u2018Fortunately\u2026\u2026..\u2019Io\u2019s expression changed faintly.\u2018Prince Simon has great interest in Roan.\u2019Roan was a big of subject of speaking even in the royal palace.Their interest and curiousness got activated at the consecutive victories.\u2018It\u2019s also a big opportunity for Roan.\u2019If Roan could enter Simon\u2019s eyes, even if Io didn\u2019t use his hands, he would be able to get pardoned of his sins and climb to an even higher position.\u201cCompared to the other regions, the region of Tale is really peaceful.\u201dSimon\u2019s voice.He had an amazed expression.They had passed several regions while moving from the capital of Miller to the region of Tale.Tranquility. Silence.Several regions were suffering severe damages because of the movement of the monsters that appeared out of Poskein lake.But only the region of Tale was clean.Traces of burnt monster corpses that were everywhere and big and small camps.On top of that, the road made of gravel and sand made it more comfortable for the soldiers to move and much faster.A feeling that he was more impressive the more he saw.\u201cWhat kind of person is this guy called Roan?\u201dSimon asked as if he was really curious.\u201cRoan\u2026\u2026\u201dIo smiled faintly and started to speak stories about Roan.\u201cHa! It seems like all the reports that were submitted were lacking.\u201dSimon got greatly amazed after listening to the stories.he had read the reports about Roan and the region of Tale.\u2018I thought that the merits and the situation of the region were exaggerated.\u2019But after actually looking at the region of Tale, he realized that the reports were really humble.\u201cI want to meet that Roan quickly.\u201dIo just smiled instead of replying.Then.\u201cI can hear some yells.\u201dOne of the escorting knights frowned.The really faint sound heard at the surroundings.Simon tilted his ear for a moment and then nodded.\u201cIt seems like a battle is occurring.\u201dA smile bloomed in his face.He made a gesture with his head towards Io and then pulled the reins.\u201cRoan, I think he\u2019s somewhere close.\u201dA kind of humorous voice.At the same time, he kicked the horse.Dudududu!Soon, horse steps were heard clearly.The escorting knights quickly followed his back.And Io also sticked his chest to the horse.How long have they rode?As they got up a hill, a wide plain was spread below them.Puuuuu!The sound of a horn trumpet was heard.\u201cAh\u2026.!\u201dSimon and the several knights let out low exclamations.A battle was occurring in the plain.No, the battle was now coming to an end.\u201cThe entire troop is moving like one.\u201dAmazement.Simon looked at the soldiers pushing back the monsters fiercely and put a surprised expression.Io, that arrived late, looked down the hill and put a smile.\u201cThey are Amaranth troop.\u201dEndTL: Regular chapterTranslator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I am the MonarchChapter 94 - Poskein Exodus (5)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA sponsored chapter to make your day\u201cMmm.\u201dSimon and the knights nodded with in exclamation.\u2018It\u2019s a more outstanding troop than what I had thought and heard.\u2019Even so, Simon and the several people had never seen a small scaled troop like the Amaranth troop utilize strategies actively.They had a look of scattering, gathering, splitting up, and gathering again.Amaranth troop resembled a huge stream of water.It was a complete victory.The battle ended with victory for the Amaranth troop.Gulp.Simon dry swallowed.\u201cCount Lancephil. the Amaranth troop is really amazing.\u201dHis thoughts came out like that.Io just smiled instead of replying back.Then.Dudududu.One warhorse ran towards Simon with the sound of the horse clops.He had a confident expression and spirit.The troop flag that was on his side, instead of the spear, fluttered with strength.Io, who was looking at that, said in a small voice.\u201cThat\u2019s the troop commander of Amaranth troop, Roan.\u201d\u201cHe looks truly majestic.\u201dSimon nodded with a satisfied expression.Meanwhile, Roan finally reached the front of the group.Hiiiiiing!As he pulled the reins, the war horse softly stopped.Roan dismounted from the horse and quickly stuck the flag into the ground.Puk!The flag of the troop was finely extended and emanated a confident spirit.Roan rose from his kneeling position and saluted.He had a mannered look and at the same time, roughless.\u201cTroop commander Roan of the Amaranth troop greets Prince Simon Rinse.\u201dHe spoke in a voice with strength.Roan bowed and caught his breath.His expression was kind of stifled.\u2018To be able to meet him this quickly.\u2019A strange light appeared in his eyes.\u2018Simon Rinse. The first prince of the kingdom and\u2026..\u2019His heart pounded.\u2018The person that someday becomes the mad monarch.\u2019*****After Roan returned to the past, one of the things he had to do was to stop the mad monarch.\u2018Originally, the one that should have became the next king was him.\u2019But in the end, his seat was taken by his brother.\u2018And he became crazy.\u2019After that, he killed his supporter and grandfather, Bradley Webster, and caused a commotion in the northwestern region of the kingdom.As he lead a force and caused a commotion himself, he was called the mad monarch.And as his original abilities were outstanding, the commotion couldn\u2019t be easily suppressed.With that reasoning, even after the geniuses Pierce and Ian appeared, Rinse Kingdom was unable to rise up in the empire ranking list of the continent due to the internal disturbances that it suffered.\u2018If we only didn\u2019t have the mad monarch, we could have combined the northeastern region of the continent.\u2019Because of that, Roan was planning to stop Simon from going crazy.But he was a prince of the kingdom.He wasn\u2019t someone a mere troop commander, and a sinner on top of that, could easily meet.But of course, he knew that he would get dispatched to the northern region because of the Poskein exodus.But in his past life, he had gone to Pavor castle instead of this place.\u2018Certainly, the future has changed a bit because of me.\u2019He hadn\u2019t expected today\u2019s encounter at all.\u201cThe defenses are really outstanding.\u201dSimon, who was checking out the village\u2019s fences, watchtower, and etc. nodded with an amazed expression.\u201cThat\u2019s an excessive complement.\u201dRoan hurriedly gathered his thoughts and bowed.\u201cNo. It\u2019s really outstanding.\u201dSimon looked at the fences and watchtower once again and had a satisfied expression.The two people inspected the village that had the HQ of the troop located in it for quite a while.\u2018It\u2019s a mere countryside but the road, houses, and etc. are being built really well.\u2019The defenses weren\u2019t the only things that were good.The road crossing over the village was both smooth and hard, and the houses built with wood were clean and well built.Most of all, the expressions of the people were really bright, even when it was a dangerous situation where monsters were going wild.Simon nodded with a satisfied expression.\u201cYou are maintaining the region of Tale really well. The expressions of the people are good.\u201d\u201cI just did as much as i could as it is my job.\u201dRoan humbly replied and bowed.Simon kept checking the houses and the camp after that.\u201cYou said the village still doesn\u2019t have a name?\u201dHe lightly asked a question.\u201cYes. As it was created just recently, everyone is calling it the central village.\u201dAt Roan\u2019s question, Simon pondered for a moment and then had a bright expression.\u201cHow about Mediasis?\u201dIt meant that it was the center and the base.Roan didn\u2019t have a choice anyways.\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent name.\u201dHe faintly smiled and bowed.Simon looked at that Roan and then asked.\u201cRoan. This subjugation is a really important thing for the nobles and for me. It\u2019s something we must raise a big merit in.\u201dHe had a really serious expression.It was obvious. Because this could be a war that would decide the next king of the kingdom.For Simon, it was something that he had to pour everything that he had into.\u201cThe northern region of Tale is no different than the front line. If we completely block this part, the organization of the rear doesn\u2019t become that difficult. Followed by that, our army is planning to subjugate the monsters with this point as the base. But we don\u2019t know much about this region.\u201dSome kind of expectation was behind his voice.\u201cCompared to that, you\u2019ve raised up really incredible achievements as the one responsible for this region. So I\u2026\u2026.\u201dA moment\u2019s silence.Simon caught his breath and continued saying.\u201cDo you have any good thoughts or plans regarding the subjugation?\u201dIt was a question he just threw out, but it was a really impressive thing.The first prince of the kingdom asked the opinion of a mere troop commander.Truly, this was an unprecedented thing.If they were escorting knights or nobles, it was a thing that would cause a commotion.But Simon was really calm.\u2018If have the abilities, you don\u2019t differentiate between slaves or sinners.\u2019This was Simon\u2019s thoughts.He needed an influential person to win in the competition for the throne.Roan organized his thoughts for a moment and then raised his head to look at Simon.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good but I have something prepared.\u201dHe spoke with a calm voice and expression.Roan took out two scrolls of papers from his chest.He spread out one of them and placed it on a wide table.\u201cThis?\u201dAt that moment, Simon had a surprised expression.He eyes widely opened as if it was something he hadn\u2019t expected at all.On the other hand, Roan nodded with a calm expression.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a map of the region of Tale.\u201dThe identity of the map was a map made by the agency.\u2018A map\u2026..\u2019Silence fell between the two people.The designing of a map was labeled as being a really dangerous thing.Because you could suffer great damages if it was leaked to another kingdom.Roan looked at the stiff expression of Simon and said in a low voice.\u201cThe value of a map in battle is really big.\u201dHe spread out the second scroll.Likewise, it was a map of Tale, but the thing that was different with this map was that it had several dots and arrows on it.\u201cThe dots are the places where the subjugations occurred and the arrows are the records of the movements of the monsters.\u201dHis finger moved around busily.\u201cBased on the results of the analysis, the monsters are moving to the north through the mountain ranges spread from the west to east. Aside from that, they tend to move through the road between Mediasis Village and the plains of the west.\u201dSimon nodded unconsciously.The scenery of a battlefield he imagined was done only through senses, and it was felt as if it was spread in front of his eyes.The dots and arrows were of big help in grasping the entire flow of the battle.Roan spread the first map again.\u201cWe set up several traps, obstacles, and camps with the gathered and analyzed information as the background.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.!\u201dAt that moment, a low exclamation came out of Simon\u2019s mouth.It was just like Roan said.On the first map, there were records of camps, traps, and bases for the troop, and those places were on the moving routes of the monsters.\u2018He wasn\u2019t just fighting blindly!\u2019Simon unconsciously swallowed down dry saliva.He was once again amazed at Roan\u2019s abilities.\u2018It\u2019s a waste to just leave him as the commander of a single troop.\u2019He became certain of this.Roan looked at the stifled expression of Simon and bowed.\u201cI know what the prince is worried of. And because of that, we are managing it so that this map isn\u2019t taken outside.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dSimon nodded with a low exclamation.\u201cIf we have this map, it will certainly be of great help.\u201dIt was a positive reaction.Roan nodded.\u201cYes. It will be of great help in the dispatching of troops and grasping movements.\u201dAt those words, the eyes of Simon softly loosened up.\u201cGood. Making a map as you please is a punishable action, but as the situation is like this I will forgive you. No\u2026\u2026..\u201dHis mouth slightly rose.\u201cActually, I think that it is really amazing. Because if we only have this map, we can perfectly control the region of Tale.\u201dSimon patted Roan\u2019s shoulders with a proud expression.\u2018Whew. Did it turn out well?\u2019Roan let out a short sigh.Actually, showing him the map was one of the risks for him.The making of a map was that much of a problem.But he thought that when the Mad Monarch Simon saw this in this situation, it would be of help for him.\u2018He was a really reasonable person and someone that valued personal strength before he became the mad monarch.\u2019Because of that, commoners with great ability could get an important job without the courting of the nobles.\u201cRoan. Shall we return now?\u201dHe had finished observing.\u201cYes. I will take the lead.\u201dRoan quickly took back the maps and after he put it near his chest, he started to walk.Simon had a faint smile and followed his back.The two people arrived in the conference room of the HQ where several nobles were gathered.\u201cDid you finish observing?\u201dIo smiled brightly and asked.Simon glanced at Roan once more and then nodded.\u201cHe was really amazing.\u201dAt those words, several nobles nodded.Just like Simon\u2019s words, they were also greatly surprised at the power of the troop and the defenses of the central village, no, Mediasis Village.Simon sat on a seat that Io had prepared.And Roan humbly stood behind the nobles.\u201cJust like everyone of you knows, I decided to subjugate the monsters of the north with this point as the base.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Simon\u2019s words, several nobles nodded.\u201cBecause of that, this region of Tale became more important than anywhere else. I can\u2019t give the commanding right of this kind of place to anyone.\u201dHe paused for a moment and then a faint smile appeared on his face.Then, Simon\u2019s sight moved to Roan.\u201cRoan. I\u2019m planning to give the commanding right and strategy right to you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan and the several nobles let out low exclamations.Because they knew the weight Simon\u2019s words had.\u2018Prince Simon entrusted Roan with the key of an army!\u2019Io bowed with a grateful expression.But the protests of several nobles was too fierce.\u201cPrince. Roan is a sinner. To entrust the key of an army to someone like that. That can never happen.\u201d\u201cAlthough it\u2019s only limited to the region of Tale, but to give that to a mere commoner\u2026\u2026 Some nobles may have to follow his orders.\u201dThey had expressions where they were almost in tears.Simon had a humorous look on his face.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t only for the competition of the throne, I would have already thrown them away.\u2019They were insect-like bastards that lived by sticking themselves onto the families without having any abilities.But now was a situation that he had to lead even those nobles.\u2018If you are saying that he\u2019s a sinner\u2026\u2026..\u2019Simon shook his hand and made the nobles shut up and then looked at Roan.\u201cIn this moment I, Simon Rinse, act instead of his majesty Deni III to completely pardon Roan\u2019s sins.\u201d\u201cPrince!\u201dThe nobles yelled with surprised expressions.\u201cPrince. You can\u2019t decide to pardon the sin that easi\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dSimon shook his head and stopped them.Strength was shown in his eyes.\u201cSpeak. Is there someone that has raised some clear merits from the Pedian monster subjugation until the subjugation of Poskein lake?\u201d\u201cBut the sin of violence against a noble\u2026..\u201d\u201cNoble? Are you speaking about that rotten guy? After several investigations, his sins were clearly revealed. But you are defending that kind of guy?\u201dHe had a presence like a column.The nobles wavered and in the end, they shut their mouths.In the first place, they were the ones that decided to follow Simon.There was no need to be seen badly here.\u201cEveryone listen closely.\u201dSimon said with a strong voice.\u201cI like people with abilities. If he just has that, I wouldn\u2019t care if that person was a sinner or a slave.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe nobles bowed and replied in one voice.The importance of ability.This was Simon\u2019s philosophy.\u2018Because of that, he couldn\u2019t stand getting his throne taken away by someone that had less abilities than him.\u2019But of course, the decisive case that drove him crazy was another thing.As he thought about that cruel case, his chest became heavy.Roan let out a short sigh.Then.\u201cRoan.\u201dSimon\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cCome here.\u201dAt those words, Roan carefully moved his feet and stood in front of Simon.A heavy silence fell over the conference room.Simon slowly stood up and loosened up the dagger he had on his waist.It was a really luxurious dagger that didn\u2019t look all that useful.He gave the dagger to Roan.\u201cThis dagger was something given by his majesty when I became an adult. It\u2019s something made by famous blacksmiths and lapidaries of the capital of Miller. It\u2019s my symbol I call Regate dagger and it\u2019s an object proving the status of the 1st prince.\u201dSimon\u2019s sight moved to the nobles.\u201cI\u2019m going to give this dagger to Roan. You are to follow Roan\u2019s orders as if they were mine, at least in the region of Tale, and follow him loyally.\u201dAt that moment, a breath taking atmosphere was felt.Several nobles were conflicted with stifled expressions but in the end, they bowed their heads.\u201cYes. We will.\u201dOnly after that did Simon nod with a satisfied expression on his face and gaze at Roan.\u201cRoan. I\u2019m giving this Regate dagger to you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dRoan let out a low cry and hurriedly kneeled down.He slightly bowed as he delicately extended both of his hands.Tuk.The dagger was placed above his palms.\u201cRoan. This Regate dagger\u2026..\u201dHe spoke in a low voice as if he was whispering.\u201cYou have to return it to me along with the victory.\u201dA humorous expression was seen on his face.Roan replied while he was still in the posture to receive the dagger.\u201cYes. I will certainly win.\u201dHis voice slightly trembled.Roan was moved.\u2018I, a mere commoner troop commander, got the commanding rights and strategic rights, that are the core for an army.\u2019He was recognized by the first prince, Simon, and obtained some nobles under his command.Compared to his past life, this life was a really the perfect foil in comparison.Roan placed the dagger on his waist with careful movements.The luxurious shape received light and shined.The sights of the nobles poured onto Roan.Envy, displeasement, jealousy.Their eyes were mixed with several emotions.\u2018Now whether they can act as limbs or not\u2026\u2026\u2019He ground his teeth.\u2018It\u2019s all on me.\u2019His heart beat accelerated.It wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but he was confident.He was planning to show his capabilities to these several nobles.\u2018Not only because of the orders of the prince\u2026\u2026.\u2019Flames appeared in his eyes.\u2018I will make them want to follow me on their own.\u2019Soon, his quick beating heart returned to normal.And even the excitement calmed down.Roan looked at the faces of the nobles with a calm expression.Several plans were set up in his head.Now, Roan wasn\u2019t just a normal troop commander anymore.EndTL: Sponsored chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, let\u2019s end the conference now.\u201dSimon nodded with a satisfied expression.There was no way he didn\u2019t know about the plots and displeasures of the nobles.But he was still satisfied even while taking that into account.\u2018It\u2019s because of Roan.\u2019Because there was already a solid defensive line set up in the entire region of Tale.Simon said while looking at the nobles.\u201cEach of you will perform your roles as the day brightens.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dAll the nobles stood up and bowed.Their expressions were pathetic.They also knew quite well the meaning this subjugation had.\u2018I have to certainly raise a big merig.\u2019That was the method everyone could stay alive.Roan felt the heat of the nobles and smiled bitterly.\u2018I thought that I just had to stop the exodus well to take the upper seat in the competition for the throne.\u2019But the future didn\u2019t flow that easily.Roan took in a deep breath.\u2018The really fierce and cruel competition still didn\u2019t start.\u2019He had to prepare for then.He had met Simon faster than he thought.Because of that, he had to hurry in his remaining preparations.\u2018I am confident.\u2019He had already polished some of his base.Now was the turn to stand up on that base.*****Morning of the next day.As soon as the day brightened up, most of the nobles lead their troops and left Mediasis village.The remaining ones were the five viscounts and barons.Along with Simon\u2019s army and Io\u2019s soldiers.Roan sent the leaving nobles off as the responsible one of the region of Tale and the HQs.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a short sigh when the nobles left with their troops.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, right?\u201dThen, a familiar voice was heard at the back.It was Io.He approached with a proud expression and grabbed Roan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThey are all nobles with useless pride.\u201dIo smiled bitterly and shook his head.He looked at the nobles getting farther away and continued saying.\u201cCongratulations on getting the commanding and strategizing rights for Tale. Now, you will be able to properly do your thing.\u201dAlthough many nobles have left, just by combining the number of Simon\u2019s army and the soldiers of the other nobles, that number amounted to more than 20.000.For Roan that had faced the monsters with only 1.000 soldiers of Amaranth troop, it was a force just like a thousand war horses.The opportunity to execute the several strategies, tactics he couldn\u2019t do it because he lacked numbers was now possible.But of course, it wouldn\u2019t be easy.Io looked at Roan and asked in a low voice.\u201cAlthough the nobles that remained are only viscounts and barons, a noble is still a noble. They won\u2019t be easy to handle, are you confident?\u201dAt those words Roan put a faint smile.A look that was full of confidence and leisure.\u201cNow that I became the responsible\u2026\u2026.\u201dRed light shone in his eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s no differentiation between nobles and commoners. They are all soldiers.\u201dA voice with strength.Io slowly nodded.\u2018I can already see the look of a commander.\u2019A proud expression.Roan and Io smiled faintly and faced themselves.Their sights got interlocked with a strong heat.*****After Roan returned to the HQ\u2019s he ordered Austin to gather all the nobles that remained in Tale.The gathering place was on a secluded building outside the HQ.It was because SImon was using the office and conference room.\u201cTch. Already pretending to be a commander.\u201dAmong the nobles that remained in Tale and had the strongest force, baron George Ant complained with a displeased expression.Because he received Roan\u2019s gathering order while he was setting up a camp and placing down his stuff.\u201cHmph. Even if he\u2019s outstanding, how outstanding can he be\u2026\u2026.\u201dGeorge had also read the several reports and knew how outstanding Roan\u2019s merits were.But his pride hurt to easily recognize him.\u2018Tch. Dare to make a mistake. I will finish you from the seat of region\u2019s responsible one.\u2019He spitted out nice and kept moving.He saw the gathering building from far away.\u201cYou came.\u201dThe guards that were in front of the building saluted once and then opened up the closed doors.The soldiers that belonged to Amaranth troop had manners and dignity in their actions.\u2018Hhm.\u2019George smacked his lips for nothing and entered the building.As he looked the humble posture of the guards, he felt his mood loosening up.He moved a few more steps and opened up the door of the conference room.At that moment.\u2018Damn it.\u2019The loosened up expression became hard again.No, it became flustered.His sight moved to the upper seat of the conference room.\u2018So you are the commander, huh?\u2019Roan was seated on the upper seat of the long table.Next to him, the nobles and knights of Simon\u2019s army and the nobles that remained with George were seated up.They also had bad expressions like George.He knew that he had to take Roan\u2019s orders because of Simon\u2019s orders and agreed because he had no other options, but as he was facing the situation itself, it didn\u2019t feel that good.\u2018Damn.\u2019George cursed out inwardly and then moved.He sat on an empty seat with a heavy thud.A feeling his situation with Roan was being differentiated.\u2018Damn.\u2019Curses came out once again.Then.\u201cWe are all gathered up.\u201dA low but composed voice.Roan stood up and put a faint smile.He looked at the faces of the nobles and then bowed.\u201cI\u2019m Roan that got to command the region of Tale with the orders of the 1st prince.\u201dThere were no applauses.Not even friendly eyes.But Roan didn\u2019t mind.\u201cI know really well that you are all displeased with this situation. But it\u2019s time to concentrate on making the subjugation to be a victory rather than ranks.\u201dIt was a completely true thing.But the expressions of the nobles were still the same.\u2018It\u2019s just like I expected.\u2019Roan smiled bitterly and sat down.He took out a thick roll of paper and grabbed a pen.\u201cShall we grasp the number of the soldiers first? Exactly how many soldiers are in the army of the 1st prince?\u201dRight before he finished saying his sentence, the leader of the knights that was at his side said with a blunt voice.\u201c15.000. 2000 are knights and 500 mages.\u201dIt was a more solid and amazing force than he thought.Roan kept asking the forces of the nobles seated at his side.\u201c3.000.\u201d\u201c2.000.\u201d\u201c3.000.\u201dShort replies.The number of the forces were generally similar.In the case of the nobles that had a territory, they didn\u2019t have much soldiers as they needed some to protect their territory.\u2018Adding up the soldiers of count Lancephil, do I have about 28.000?\u2019An army close to 30.000.Roan\u2019s mouth slightly rose.\u2018This much is enough.\u2019Several strategies and tactics he couldn\u2019t use until now roamed in his head.He took out a scroll from his chest.The map of the region of Tale.Chwaruuk.The map got spread above the table.\u201cMm.\u201dThe nobles let out low exclamations.They had also heard in the conference that Roan had made a map.But as they actually saw it with their eyes, it was kind of perplexing.\u2018He really made one.\u2019\u2018For a map to be this detailed.\u2019Everyone had surprised expressions.But Roan didn\u2019t care.He spread the map and raised up a pointing stick.Tak!The tip of the stick pointed the troop\u2019s HQ.\u201cThis is Mediasis village.\u201dThe nobles unconsciously nodded.Roan smiled faintly and moved his stick.\u201cThis is Poskein lake.\u201dAn outline appeared even when he only pointed to places.Roan continued speaking.\u201cWe are going to set up a defensive line in the south of Mediasis village as the base.\u201dThe stick kept moving sideways on the map.\u201cI\u2019m planning to set up a perfect defensive line that goes from east to west to block the path of the monsters.\u201dRoan pointed the several dots drawn in the map.\u201cThese are camps that are already set up. If you use this camps actively, it will be of big help on setting up your own camps.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dThe nobles unconsciously nodded.Because the camps, traps and obstacles Roan prepared were more solid than they thought.Roan smiled faintly and continued speaking.\u201cThen, I will speak about the dispatchment of the troops.\u201dThe stick moved quickly.\u201cFirst, as the army of the 1st prince is the strongest\u2026\u2026..\u201dRoan calmly spread the plans he had thought up.A solid plan.\u2018He\u2019s amazing just like the prince said.\u2019Viscount T\u00edo Ruin, that ranked among the heads of the nobles, got greatly amazed.But the expressions of the other nobles wasn\u2019t as good.\u201cLastly, I hope sir baron George Ant sets up a formation at the end of the east of Tale.\u201dThe last order.\u201cHmph!\u201dGeorge snorted with a displeased expression.He could endure everything else because it was Simon\u2019s orders.But he couldn\u2019t do so for this one.\u201cHow come I get to set up a formation at the end?\u201dAn upset voice.He stood up from his seat and pointed the a part of the map with his finger.\u201cI will also take place near Mediasis village.\u201dNow that he got to remain near Tale, he would have to stay near Simon.He had to raise merits where his eyes reached.Roan shook his head with a composed expression.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201dAt that moment, George\u2019s face became red.\u2018This bastard!\u2019To ignore the words of a noble.Anger pent up.\u201cAmong the nobles that remained in the region of Tale, I have the most numbers of soldiers. So isn\u2019t it obvious for me to defend the center, that is Mediasis village?\u201dIt was the truth.George had done the unreasonable to bring soldiers from his territory to raise big merits at this opportunity.Thanks to that, he had more numbers than the other nobles.But Roan shook his head once again.\u201cBaron Ant has to guard the eastern region.\u201dA composed voice.\u201cThat\u2019s the moving route of the monsters.\u201dThat\u2019s why he had dispatched George, that had the most numbers, over there.Bang!George smacked down the table with a red face.\u201cIt seems like you became unable to see things properly because you became the commander through the prince\u2019s orders! I am a noble of the kingdom\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he talked up to there.Srung!Roan pulled the dagger in his waist.Regate dagger.That sharp and fierce dagger showed itself.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cUm?\u201dThe nobles got surprised and stood up from their seats.Roan didn\u2019t mind and sticked down the dagger to the table.\u201cPant!\u201dGeorge looked the dagger stabbing towards the back of his hand and gulped in some air.Puk!A heavy sound hitting your ears.The dagger got precisely stuck at the tip of George\u2019s fingers.\u201cUhhhhhhh.\u201dGeorge trembled and looked at Roan.\u201cYou bastard what are you doing right now!\u201dEven his voice was trembling.Roan looked at that George properly and said with a fierce voice.\u201cThis dagger is Regate dagger that the 1st prince granted to me.\u201dThe dagger moved to the sides while being stuck in the table.\u201cThe prince has certainly said to follow my orders like it was his.\u201dHis fierce voice got stuck in the ear of the nobles.\u201cMmm.\u201dA displeased and stiff expression.But now that Roan took out Regate dagger, he had no way to rebuke anymore.Roan looked at George properly.\u201cWill you disobey my orders?\u201d\u201cGrr.\u201dGeorge stepped back.He wanted to grab his throat and raise him up, but he couldn\u2019t do so because of Regate dagger.\u201cDamn it.\u201dGeorge cursed out and sat with a thud.And the expressions of the other nobles also wasn\u2019t good.There were also some nobles that had complaints in their dispatchment location, but Roan\u2019s actions just now was ignoring the title of nobility.Roan read that look but didn\u2019t care.\u201cThen. I believe you will all follow my orders.\u201dThere were no reactions.\u201cWith this, I will end the meet\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to there some nobles stood up and got out of the room.\u201cThe world is spinning backwards!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cDoes this make sense!\u201dSome nobles complained loudly on purpose.At the sudden situation, Roan smiled bitterly and finished speaking.\u201cI will end the meeting here.\u201dThe conference ended like that.Even the other nobles that remained slowly stood up and got out of the room.Roan stayed on the room and sent them off.The conference room that became empty in an instant.Then.\u201cDid the meeting end up well?\u201dAustin appeared with a familiar voice.He had a somewhat worried face.Roan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cMore than I thought.\u201dA short and thick reply.Austin smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u201cWill high nosed nobles follow your orders well?\u201dA really skeptical reaction.Roan smiled brightly and nodded.\u201cThey have to. My orders are the prince\u2019s orders. But\u2026\u2026\u201dHe looked at Austin fixedly.\u201cIt won\u2019t be bad having one or two nobles not following my orders.\u201dAt those words Austin tilted his head.\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026..?\u201dRoan just smiled instead of replying.His mouth rose and his eyes dropped.A soft look.But there was a red flame in his eyes.That was a revelation of a strong determination.EndTL: Sponsored chapter!

I really became a general.\u2019Roan looked at the troops scattering out while he was on top of a watchtower and put on a smile.With this amount of soldiers, he would be able to stop the Poskein Exodus with troops to spare.\u2018It will be different than my past life.\u2019They suffered great losses because they couldn\u2019t properly stop the monsters.But this time, at least on the northern region, they could at least prepare to some degree because of Roan\u2019s performances.Then.\u201cA beacon.\u201dA beacon surged up from the south.After the Poskein Exodus started, the beacons surged up a few times a day.The drums and jings started to ring even before Roan gave the order.Deng! Deng! Deng! Jing! Jing! Jing!The Amaranth troop took formations and prepared themselves as if they had been waiting for it.It gave off a really nimble and quick look.Roan also hurried down from the watchtower and prepared to charge out.\u201cA beacon surged up from the south!\u201dA loud yell rang out.Roan looked at the faces of the troop members.\u201cAmaranth troop! Charge!\u201dThe order was given out.The Amaranth troop charged out of the HQ with Roan at the front.They truly looked majestic.\u201cThis troop is certainly well-trained.\u201dSimon, who was looking at the troop march out, became amazed and spoke in a low voice.Io, who was at his side, had a bright smile at the proud this made him feel.\u201cYes. It\u2019s a strong army that\u2019s quite rare to see nowadays.\u201dAt Io\u2019s words, Simon nodded.\u2018Roan. The Amaranth troop. Perhaps they may be of great strength to me in the future.\u2019His chest became hot.The subjugation was to be one step ahead in the competition for the throne.He thought that perhaps he would be receiving a grand treasure when he hadn\u2019t thought he would.\u2018If Roan decides to follow me\u2026\u2026.\u2019He couldn\u2019t just leave him as a troop commander in this kind of region.\u2018He will have use his power for me.\u2019A strange expression appeared on his face.Simon wasn\u2019t looking at today or tomorrow, but at the distant future.*****The subjugation of the Tale Region was easier than they had initially thought.This was because the Amaranth troop and Simon\u2019s troop left to actively subjugate the monsters after setting up a defensive line that went from the east to the west.It certainly was a really positive situation, but Roan didn\u2019t get careless.\u201cEven if it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s just too easy.\u201dHe looked at the map spread out on the table and frowned.Austin and the other centurions were next to him.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThese words were asked carefully.Roan pointed the southern part of Tale with his stick.\u201cIt feels like the number of monsters has decreased.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just his feeling.Actually, after Simon and the nobles had come to Tale, the number of beacons surging up had decreased.At those words Austin smiled brightly and said.\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for the exodus to slowly end?\u201dSeveral centurions nodded as if they had agreed to the statement.But Roan\u2019s expression was still stiff and didn\u2019t seem like it would loosen up.\u2018No, that\u2019s not it. The Poskein Exodus occurs for twenty more days.\u2019He clearly remembered how long the exodus had lasted.And this was because it was a big case that made memorize it.\u2018In the last three days, about five times the normal amount of monsters poured out.\u2019This was what you would call the final exodus.In his past life, the Rinse Kingdom judged that the exodus was coming to an end because the number of monsters was slowly decreasing.And in the end, because of this carelessness, they suffered great damages during the last three days of the exodus.\u2018It\u2019s not time for the exodus to end yet.\u2019There may be another reason in why the monsters had decreased.\u2018I told the information squad and the agency to search for the cause of this so there will soon be an answer.\u2019He couldn\u2019t continue with the strategies while he felt like this.Then.Knock. Knock. Knock.A knocking sound was heard in the conference room.\u201cCome in.\u201dRight before he said that, a familiar face appeared from the open door.It was Keep and the staff of the agency.\u201cI finished the thing that you ordered us to do.\u201dHe spoke in an urgent voice and the same emotion could be seen on his face.Keep approached and stood next to Roan.He looked at the map spread out on the table and had an expression as if saying that it was nice that it was spread out.\u201cJust as you had told us, the movements of the monsters aren\u2019t normal.\u201dThe tip of his finger moved to a mountainous area ranging from the east to west of Tale.\u201cThe monsters that were moving to the north until now are now moving towards the mountain range.\u201d\u201cAre they planning to cross the mountains?\u201d\u201cYes. We think so.\u201dKeep nodded with a serious expression.The same went for Roan.\u2018To think of crossing the mountains.\u2019The region of Tale was a perfect valley.The mountains blocking the west and the east weren\u2019t that high, but they were harsh.Because of that, there wasn\u2019t a route in the mountains.To go to the other regions, you could only use the plains in the north or the lake that was at the south.\u201cWhat\u2019s the mountain they plan to cross over?\u201dAt the question that was asked shortly after the report, Keep pointed at two mountains.It was a place far from the current defensive lines.\u2018I can\u2019t let them cross over.\u2019They had to exterminate the monsters from the region of Tale inside of the region of Tale.That was Roan\u2019s plans.\u2018I will have to lower the defensive line to the south.\u2019He was planning to completely suppress the monsters so that they couldn\u2019t even ride up the mountain.\u201cI will have to change my plans.\u201dRoan looked at the centurions and opened his mouth.\u201cLower the actual defensive line to the south and then exterminate the monsters that get close.\u201dRoan\u2019s orders continued to come out.\u201cNotify the nobles about the situation and make them move the camps to the south.\u201d\u201cYes. Understood.\u201dThe centurions all nodded and replied in one voice.Roan grabbed the table with his hands and peeked his head towards them.The eyes of Roan and the centurions were fiercely interlocked.\u201cA large battle may occur in these few coming days. Everybody, be prepared for it.\u201d\u201cYes. We will take that into account.\u201dThe centurions ground their teeth and nodded.Heat could be felt in the conference room.*****Bang!George Ant threw the apple that he was holding.\u201cThis fuc\u2026\u2026..\u201dCurses came up to the tip of his tongue.He glared at the soldier that made the report while he was inside a wooden tub filled with water.\u201cSay that once again.\u201d\u201cTh, tha\u2026\u2026\u201dThe soldier stuttered with a really nervous expression on his face.\u201cThe soldiers of the Amaranth troop came from Mediasis Village. Troop Commander Roan said to move the defensive line to the south\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen he talked up to that point.Bang!An apple flew once again.George rose up from the tub.His swollen stomach and stretched leg fat was seen.The maidens that were serving him next to the tub approached and after they wiped off the water, they dressed him in a gown.George grabbed another apple.\u201cRoan. This bastard sure is having his fun. Real fun.\u201dThere was a real displeased expression on his face.George cursed for a while with an annoyed expression.\u201cHow long has it been since we set up the camp and now he tells us to lower it down again?\u201dThe straight house had also been recently built.He was planning to melt his body in warm water and have a hot night with the young maidens that he had brought with him.\u2018Son of a bitch. If I tell him I won\u2019t follow his orders, he will pull out the dagger again.\u2019A fishy smile appeared on his face.George shook his hand towards the soldier.\u201cTell the members of the Amaranth troop that brought the notices that I listened to it well.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes. I understand.\u201dThe soldier nodded with a surprised expression and then left the house.George saw that and snorted.\u201cHmph.\u201dAs the order was given, he was indeed planning to move the camp.But even so, he wasn\u2019t planning to do it immediately.\u2018The soldiers are also really exhausted after setting up the camp. It\u2019s impossible to make them move the camp right now.\u2019It was obviously a good excuse.\u2018What will happen if only I get out of the defense line?\u2019A terrible mistake.George took a bite of the apple and had a strange smile.\u201cHuhuhu. For a commoner to make a noble move here and there. Take a hit at this.\u201dHis eyes became chilly.It was a really stupid decision and thought.Thanks to that, the situation began to flow in an unexpected direction.*****\u201cThey\u2019re all a mess, was it?\u201dRoan checked out the several documents and bitterly smiled.Austin let out a short sigh.\u201cYes. Excluding Viscount Delph Blick and the nobles under his command, they are all the worst.\u201dAt those words, Roan moved the documents to the side and looked at Austin.\u201cThey bring women and clowns to a battlefield and they open up a party everyday?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s all true.\u201dAustin smiled awkwardly and nodded.Roan clicked his tongue with a taut expression on his face.\u201cThey\u2019re all out of their minds.\u201dHe wanted to clearly curse out once.\u201cWhat about the reactions of my orders?\u201d\u201cThey were all displeased, but they said they would follow it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad at least.\u201dRoan stood up and shook his head.\u201cThe monsters will come out more fiercely when they realize that the roads to the mountains are blocked. Make sure everyone gets a hold of themselves.\u201d\u201cYes. I will certainly tell them that.\u201dAustin bowed and then left the conference room.Roan smacked his lips once again and let out a sigh when he was left alone.He felt his mouth turn bitter because of the nobles.\u2018If I someday become a monarch, I will use people based on their abilities rather than ranks.\u2019He was a commoner from birth.And from a really poor mountainside village at that.Because of that, Roan had realized the big disadvantage the titles of nobility had.\u2018I will give everyone a fair opportunity, regardless of ranks and titles.\u2019It would be a world where everyone could realize their dreams.That was the world Roan thought of.*****\u201ckirr.\u201dA nork fell while making that sound.Roan looked at his surroundings while he put away his spear.It was a complete victory.The monsters were exterminated without even leaving one behind.\u201cRetrieve the corpses of the fallen soldiers and treat the injured ones!\u201dA loud yell rang out.The troop members of the Amaranth Troop began to organize the battlefield.Roan looked at the southern sky and let out a long sigh.\u2018Because I lowered the defensive line to the south, the monsters lost their direction and are wandering about.\u2019Because the road to enter the mountains was completely blocked off.\u2018If it\u2019s like this, we will be able to perfectly cut them of\u2026\u2026..\u2019When he thought up to that moment.Roan frowned.\u2018A beacon?\u2019A beacon surged up from the rear of the north.But it wasn\u2019t a normal one.\u2018Two, three?\u2019There wasn\u2019t black smoke, and three surged up consecutively.It meant that it was that urgent of a situation.He chased with Kalian\u2019s Tear and saw that the entire western region was a world of beacons.\u201cTroop commander! A beacon has surged up! And three at the same time at that!\u201dAustin discovered the beacon late and came running over.Roan aimed at the direction of the beacon and ground his teeth.\u2018It\u2019s the west. It\u2019s a beacon surging from the end of the west. Then\u2026\u2026..\u2019At that moment, the face of a person appeared in his head.\u2018Baron George Ant!\u2019George was the one in charge of the defensive line to the west.Roan hurriedly mounted his horse.\u201cIt seems like something happened to the defensive line in the west. Amaranth troop get ready to move!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dAustin replied and then sent a sign to the troop members.Flutter! Flutter!As the flagman shook a small flag, the troop members that were organizing the battlefield took formations and lined up.Roan looked at the beacon burning up black and tightly gripped the reins.\u2018George Ant. Just what the hell did you do?\u2019Flames appeared in his eyes.EndTL: Regular chapter.

I have no face to see troop commander Roan. No face at all.\u2019He was a soldier of the information squad in charge of surveilling the front lines of the east.He had the role of quickly informing Roan in case the nobles didn\u2019t follow his orders.And especially Baron George Ant who had a lot of complaints against Roan.Because of that, he was putting in more effort and checked on him thoroughly.\u2018I was a bit relieved when they moved the camp to the south as troop commander\u2019s orders but\u2026\u2026\u2019He was a bit slower than the other nobles, but George had also moved the camp to the south.It was a settling look in the defensive lines.But after two days of having settled down, they started to show weird movements.\u2018They started to suddenly withdraw the camp.\u2019For now, he sent the soldiers of the information squad to Mediasis village.But as George\u2019s troop kept moving towards the north, he couldn\u2019t stand watching anymore.In the end, he sent an information squad to a close beacon.Meanwhile, George who kept moving towards the north, started to settle down in a mountain range.\u2018Crazy bastard.\u2019It was a shape that he couldn\u2019t understand at all.Dass moved his feet towards George\u2019s camp.\u201cStop!\u201dThe guards, that were at the entrance, raised their spears.Dass took out a piece of cloth that had the symbol of Amaranth troop drawn in it.\u201cI\u2019m a member of the Amaranth troop.\u201dThey were already familiar with each other.The guarded entrance opened up.Dass hurriedly crossed the camp that was starting to take shape.\u2018He\u2019s there.\u2019As he approached the center of the camp, he saw George standing below a big shadow.\u201cSir Baron Ant.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dGeorge, who was lightly casually up a grape, frowned at Dass\u2019s entrance.\u2018He was from Amaranth, right?\u2019It was obvious that he came because he pulled back the camp.George shrugged his shoulders while feigning ignorance.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason you broke the formation and fell back?\u201dDass asked as politely and humbly as possible.\u201cAha. You are talking about that.\u201dGeorge brightly smiled and scratched his belly.\u201cI was looking at the position of the camp. I think that rather than the plains of the south, this mountain range would be much better. The back is blocked by the rough mountains and at the front it\u2019s mere plains, so there was nowhere better than this place.\u201dHe grabbed one more grape and put on a fishy smile.\u201cEven so, it seems like troop commander Roan made a mistake because he lacked in experience. For a general at my level, this is the most suitable place to set up the camp.\u201dDass took in a breath and then carefully spoke.\u201cBut if Baron Ant falls back alone, then all the other defenses will be put in danger.\u201dAt that moment, George burst out of laughter.\u201cHahaha. You worry too much. If that does happen, I will lead my troop myself and rescue them. Even if I look like this, i\u2019m a renowned general. Hahaha.\u201dGeorge was speaking nonsense as if it was nothing.Dass was about to say something else but he didn\u2019t.Because he realized that he wasn\u2019t someone he could hold a conversation with.\u201cI understand. Then, I will go back now.\u201dDass bowed and then turned around to keep walking.\u2018Damn. Stupid bastard.\u2019Curses roamed around in his mouth.\u2018Because of you, the entire defensive line has become fragile! For even a villagers like me had realized it and a bastard that calls himself a noble doesn\u2019t!\u2019He had an urgent expression on his face.\u2018If monsters appear\u2026\u2026..\u2019His face became red.His annoyance and rage surged up.Dass left the camp and went towards the close by mountain with the information squad.It was to monitor the plains in the south.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that moment, a low exclamation came out of Dass\u2019s voice and the other members.Their faces became pale.\u201cMonsters!\u201dA white dust cloud surged up from beyond the plains.It would have been good if it was the Amaranth troop or another allied troop, but unfortunately, what appeared was an amazing number of monsters.The monsters were charging through the south because the defensive line was opened up because of George\u2019s troop falling back.\u2018If I leave it like this, the northeastern region of Tale becomes a wasteland!\u2019Urgency appeared in Dass\u2019s expression.He made someone blow the horn trumpet through a handsign.Puuuuuu!A sound that made your heart beat beat faster while flowing through the wind.But George\u2019s camp didn\u2019t show any movements.\u2018Why! Just what are you doing?! Stupid bastard!\u2019Dass ground his teeth.Rage.A chilly murdering intent appeared in his eyes.\u201cGo to the beacons! Tell them to light the beacons!\u201dAn urgent voice flowed through the wind.*****\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe cries filled up the entire battlefield.Red flames surged up and black smoke covered your field of vision.It was a cruel sight.There were countless corpses that didn\u2019t have their heads on the battlefield.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan stood in the middle of the battlefield and let out a long sigh.He had a stiff expression on his face.He held the Travias Spear upside down and looked towards the north.\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201dCurses came out on it\u2019s own.Then.\u201cFor now, we have cut down the tails of the monsters!\u201dAustin\u2019s voice was heard.He was completely covered in blood.Although they had obtained victory after the fierce battle, his expression wasn\u2019t good.\u201cThe troop of Baron Rael Piad was annihilated.\u201dRael was right next to the west of George\u2019s camp.As George pulled back the camp on his own, the camp that was next to it suffered the attack of the monsters.Because of that, they suffered damages close to annihilation and the strong defensive line crumbled down like a sand castle.\u201cAnd Baron Piad?\u201d\u201cFortunately safe. He has fled towards the camp of Viscount Blick.\u201dAt those words, Roan slowly nodded.Then, a group of people appeared at their north.It was Dass and the information squad.\u201cTroop commander!\u201dThey kneeled down as soon as they approached Roan.\u201cWe are sorry!\u201dAn earnest voice apologized.Their shoulders trembled.But Roan\u2019s expression was composed.\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201dIt gave a short response.At those words, Dass and the others that were about to shed tears, forcefully help them back.Roan looked at them and ground his teeth.\u2018In a battlefield, the role of magicians diminishes\u2026\u2026\u2019After facing today\u2019s scandal, he felt regret at the absence of magicians.\u2018Even if we could use communication magic, we would have been able to move quicker.\u2019The magicians in Tale were the ones in Simon\u2019s troop, and those amounted to a mere 500.\u2018They are all attack purposed magicians, so they don\u2019t even know communication magic\u2026\u2026.\u2019In the current situation, they weren\u2019t of much help at all.\u201cEveryone, stand up.\u201dHe spoke in a soft voice.Dass and the others hesitated and then carefully stood up.Tear marks were seen on their faces.\u201cGeorge Ant. That bastard?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even add the title.Dass pointed to the north.\u201cHe\u2019s not even moving from the mountains.\u201dRoan slowly nodded and then moved.His feet led his forces and went towards Viscount Tio Luin.\u201cViscount Luin.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dThere was complete annoyance in the face of Tio, who was cleaning up the battlefield.Because he realized that this battle occurred because of George.\u201cLead your troop and chase the monsters that went to the north please.\u201d\u201cAnd you?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201dRoan glared at the north and said.\u201cI will have to go and find Baron Ant.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dTio let out a low cry of exclamation and nodded.He didn\u2019t have any words to say anymore.The two people looked at each other for a moment and separated.Roan got on his horse and raised his spear high.\u201cAmaranth troop, we are going to the mountains where George\u2019s troop is at!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dA loud voice rang out .It was a voice that kind of had a chilly murderous intent inside of it.Roan called to Austin with a handsign.\u201cAustin. When we arrive the camp\u2026\u2026\u201dHe gave him orders in a low voice.Austin nodded with a severe expression.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dA short salute followed afterwards.Roan looked at that and nodded, and then pulled the reins.Hiiiiiing!The head of the horse headed towards the north with a cry.\u201cMove!\u201dThe order fell.Roan and the Amaranth troop moved over the corpses of their allies and moved towards the north.Tio, who was looking at that scene, mumbled in a low voice.\u201cGeorge Ant. My stupid friend. It seems like your power only amounts to this much.\u201dHis voice was as lonely as the battlefield.*****The flag covered in blood fluttered at the front.Roan and the troop appeared at George\u2019s camp located in the mountains.The flagman ran a step ahead and then shook the flag.\u201cIt\u2019s the Amaranth troop!\u201dThe soldiers, who were on the watchtower, quickly shook their hands.Kiiiiig!The closed gates opened up.Roan looked at Austin once and then kicked the horse.The Amaranth troop entered the camp with the cavalrymen at the forefront.\u201cIt seems like they had a tough fight.\u2019\u201cBut seems like they won anyways.\u201d\u201cCan we stay like this?\u201dThe soldiers of George\u2019s troop gathered up.They conversed in nervous expressions.But Roan didn\u2019t even glance at them.His objective was fixed.\u2018Austin.\u2019\u2018Yes, commander.\u2019The two of them exchanged glances.Austin shook his hands quickly to the sides and sent a sign.At that moment, the troop members pulled their weapons from their waists.At the same time.Flutter! Flutter!The flagman that was at the front shook his flag.And the troop members charged to the front as if they had been waiting for it.\u201cHuh? Huh?\u201d\u201cWh, what is it?\u201dThe adjutants of George\u2019s troop, that were looking at Amaranth troop, put surprised expressions.They saw the members of Amaranth troop running towards them and opened up their eyes where they were as large as saucers.\u201cCapture them!\u201dAustin\u2019s voice rang through the battlefield.It was a short order, but the troop members moved nimbly.The Amaranth troop was the strongest among the strongest.They weren\u2019t someone a troop like George\u2019s, who enjoyed partying in the middle of the battlefield, could face.Cheng! Checheng!The spears and swords were pointed at the necks of the adjutants.\u201cHik!\u201d\u201cGulp.\u201dGeorge\u2019s troop commanders couldn\u2019t even properly resist and raised their arms.Surrender.The capturing was so easy that it was disappointing.\u201cThi, what is this?\u201d\u201cWhy are you like this?\u201dThe normal soldiers of George\u2019s troop gathered up with half absent-minded expressions.Roan dismounted the horse and pulled out the Regate dagger.\u201cI, Troop Commander Roan of the Amaranth troop, received the commanding and strategizing rights by the 1st prince. But Baron George Ant moved the camp as he pleased while ignoring my orders and broke the defensive lines. This is a severe violation of military discipline. From now on, I will name Baron George Ant as a sinner.\u201dHe had fierce eyes and a cold voice.Gulp.The normal soldiers swallowed dry saliva with nervous expressions.Roan kept talking.\u201cIf there\u2019s someone trying to obstruct my actions, I will also treat them as sinners.\u201dAs soon as he finished talking, the members of the Amaranth troop raised their weapons.Pat!The tips of the sharp weapons were pointed at the soldiers.\u201cUuuu.\u201d\u201cWe, we just did as we were ordered to.\u201dGeorge\u2019s soldiers already lost all will to fight back.This was because the commanders above the rank of adjutant had already been captured.Roan calmly caught his breath and then put back his dagger.His sight naturally moved over to the center of the camp.The remaining one was only George Ant.\u201cAustin.\u201dA low calling voice spoke out and he gave out a signal.\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dSoon, 50 members of the Amaranth troop moved towards the center with Roan at the front.\u201cWh, what are you!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dThe soldiers, who were guarding the center, discovered the Amaranth troop and yelled.\u2018Damn. I thought the camp was noisy. So it was because of them!\u2019Srung.They pulled out their weapons late.But Roan\u2019s and the troop member\u2019s movements were faster.Cheng! Checheng!The spears and swords hit their weapons.\u201cKuk.\u201dThe knights and commanders of George\u2019s troop ground their teeth at the numbness they felt.Roan moved in between them.Pubuk! Pububuk!He executed Reid\u2019s battle technique.\u201cKuk!\u201dThe knights and commanders kneeled down with a painful sound.\u201cTie them up!\u201dThe members of the Amaranth troop quickly came running over and firmly captured them.It was a perfect suppression.But they didn\u2019t have leisure to lower their steps.Roan walked towards a huge and luxurious tent located in the center of the camp.\u2018George Ant.\u2019He unconsciously ground his teeth.Then, the stiffly closed gates opened up and five knights with big bodies appeared.They moved out to check what was happening outside because it was too noisy.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYo, you?\u201dThe knights discovered Roan in front of them and had surprised expressions on their faces.Roan didn\u2019t even talk and extended his hand to grab their throats.His movements were filled with Reid\u2019s battle techniques.Pubuk!At one hand movement, their posture broke, and his fists hit them from the broken stances.\u201cKuk!\u201dFive knights collapsed in just an instant.\u201cUhhhhhh.\u201d\u201cYo, you crazy bastard\u2026\u2026.\u201dTheir grunts were filled with pain.Roan glared at them with a composed expression and then opened up the doors.At that moment, a luxurious place was seen inside the doors.\u201cHuh? Yo, you?\u201dIn a fashionable chair located at the center.George was sitting on that chair eating sweet fruits.He was surprised at Roan\u2019s sudden appearance.\u2018The reason why it was so noisy was because of you?\u2019The knights he sent to check what was happening weren\u2019t here anymore.\u2018Maybe?\u2019Even if he had the commanding and strategic rights, a mere commoner troop commander laid his hands on knights belonging to a noble family?George couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cWas it you making the fuss outside of the tent?\u201d\u2018Even if you placed a hand on the knights, you won\u2019t be able to do anything to me. Kukuku.\u2019He laughed in a strange way and grabbed another grape.He wanted to show Roan a look of leisure.\u201cIt seems like you won\u2019t answer. A noble is asking you but you dare\u2026..\u201dHe couldn\u2019t continue speaking.Because Roan suddenly charged forward.\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201dA sound exploded out where he was yelling with all of his strength.At the same time, his right fist split the air and hit George\u2019s chest.Puk!\u201cKok!\u201dGeorge rolled on the ground with the chair.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dThe coughs were clearly heard.Roan moved his feet like that and stepped on his chest.Kwak.\u201cKugh.\u201dGeorge struggled with a pained expression on his face.But Roan\u2019s foot didn\u2019t move at all.\u201cYou, you bastard. What are you doing right now?!\u201dGeorge yelled.\u201cIt seems like you forgot who I am! I am Rinse kingdom\u2019s\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to that point.Roan\u2019s mouth twisted.\u201cI know too well. You are the trash of Rinse Kingdom.\u201dHe put more strength in the leg, pressing even harder on his chest.George struggled even more at the feeling that his breath was getting cut off.\u201cYou crazy bastard! Do you know what kind of thing you are doing right now! You are committing violence against a noble!\u201d\u201cNoble?\u201dRoan suspiciously smiled and pulled out the Regate Dagger that he had on his waist.\u201cThis is Regate Dagger that the 1st prince gave me while granting me the commanding and strategic rights. My orders are the orders of the prince. George Ant. You haven\u2019t obeyed the orders of the 1st prince.\u201d\u201cTh, that\u2026..\u201dGeorge was at a loss for words.It was true that Roan had received the Regate Dagger.\u2018Even so, for a commoner to place his hands on a noble!\u2019It was something that couldn\u2019t be pardoned or comprehended at all for a noble.Roan pressed down on the chest even harder.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you follow my orders and move the camp as had you pleased?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because this place is more advantageous in setting up a camp!\u201dA confident yell came out of George\u2019s mouth.Roan shook his head with a stiff expression on his face.\u201cStupid bastard.\u201d\u201cWh, what?! This bastard\u2026\u2026.. Kuk!\u201dGeorge shut his mouth in the middle of cursing at the feeling where his rib cage was breaking.Roan glared at him with cold eyes.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you charge out when monsters appeared in the plains after you had set up the camp?\u201d\u201cTh, that\u2026\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say that he had gotten scared after looking at the scale of the monsters that was greater than what he had thought.Naturally, he paused his words.Fire appeared in Roan\u2019s eyes.\u201cTrash like bastard.\u201dRight before he finished saying that, his arm moved.It was a fist with Reid\u2019s battle technique behind it.Pagak!Roan hit George\u2019s face with all that he had.\u201cKuk!\u201dHis nose became bent and all of his teeth broke.\u201cGrr.\u201dGeorge spat bloody foam because of the severe pain.\u201cBecause of you, allies that shouldn\u2019t died, have died. And the ones that shouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt, became injured..\u201dAt Roan\u2019s words, George yelled with abusive language.\u201cSo, son of a bitch\u2026\u2026\u2026. You hit a noble because mere common soldiers died?\u201d\u201cMere common soldiers?\u201dRoan frowned.George laughed as if he had gone half mad and continued saying.\u201cRight! You bastard! You dare to hit me because some of your trash like allies died? Huh? Huhuhu. The life of a noble is worth a lot more than those trash-like bastards! Kuhuhuhu.\u201dAt that moment, Roan\u2019s eyes shined with a red light.That was a terrible killing intent.\u201cGeorge Ant. Don\u2019t badmouth the fallen ones. If you do it one more time\u2026..\u201dAn ice-cold voice replied back.\u201cI won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201dIt was a warning.But George, who was half mad, wasn\u2019t planning on stopping.\u201cTrash-like bastards. As you are also trash, you get\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe couldn\u2019t continue speaking.Spat!The Regate Dagger split the air.Stab!A terrible sound rang out.At the same time, the dagger stabbed George\u2019s right hand.\u201cUaak!\u201dGeorge rose himself up along with his scream.And Roan hit him in the face just like that.Puk!\u201cKuk!\u201dGeorge felt severe pain and his breathing was labored.Roan glared at him with cold eyes.\u201cShut up. Next will be your neck.\u201dEndTL: Regular chapter. A super long chapter.

Pant.\u201dA rough breath.At the end of the rope, one man was walking exhaustively as if he was being dragged while having his two arms and body tightly tied up.George Ant.He looked really bad, but he was certainly baron George Ant.Right now he was a sinner that committed a crime.He had been dragged from the eastern region of Tale to Mediasis village while being tied up.At the back of George, two companies of Amaranth troop were showing hostile looks.Kiiiig!The closed gates opened up.As Roan got in first, the soldiers that were gathered up scattered to the sides.\u201cEven if he has the commanding and strategizing rights, can a commoner troop commander treat a noble like that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak what you don\u2019t know. The damages in our side is really big because of baron Ant.\u201d\u201cEven so, treating a noble like that is a bit\u2026.. Will the other nobles stay still?\u201d\u201cI wonder. We have to check that.\u201dWorried expressions and mumbling sound.Roan didn\u2019t tilt his ear to those words.He had already decided what to do with George.\u2018Because of George Ant, the entire defensive line crumbled.\u2019He had to set up a new defensive line to sweep up the monsters that had gotten through the defensive line.Because of viscount Tio Ruin having moved fast enough, they could stop the charge of the monsters for a bit.And Roan didn\u2019t miss that opportunity.He used the information staff to send a new member to the nobles.And the nobles of the east that suffered great damages because of George reacted quickly at Roan\u2019s orders.Thanks to that, a new defensive line could be set up.\u2018Only, because we set up the defensive line a bit to the south, we ended up losing a most of the north.\u2019It was the same as having to start the subjugation again.\u2018To not admit his mistakes and mock the deaths of our allies in this situation.\u2019Ududuk.Roan ground his teeth.Then, a group of people appeared from a building located at the center.\u2018The aides of the 1st prince and the prince Simon Rinse. On top of that, the nobles that arrived first.\u2019Roan summoned the nobles to the HQ right after they finished setting up the defensive liens.It was because of George\u2019s punishment.Roan got down with soft movements and grabbed the reins.One troop member approached quickly and took it instead of him.\u201cRoan.\u201dSimon\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t that good.Because he also knew the situation really well.Roan saluted towards Simon and then looked at the expressions of the nobles behind him.\u2018Most of them seem to show no interest. They look bothered by it. They only ones that are angry are about the ones that suffered damages like baron Rael Piad and viscount Delph Blick.\u2019He put a bitter smile.They didn\u2019t realize how severe the situation was.\u2018I have to awake them from their rotten thoughts.\u2019Roan looked at Simon fixedly.\u201cI will punish baron George Ant.\u201dAt those words, Simon took a breath and then nodded.\u201cDo so. You have the commanding and strategizing rights for Tale.\u201dHis expression was hard but his voice was soft.\u2018It will be whipping at most.\u2019Even Simon thought like that.You wouldn\u2019t be able to treat a noble, and a noble leading a troop, beyond that.And that wasn\u2019t only Simon\u2019s thoughts.\u2018Even if he does that, what will he be able to do.\u2019\u2018He won\u2019t be able to treat a noble of the kingdom as he pleases.\u2019\u2018He just has to imprison him for a few days.\u2019Most of the nobles thought that nothing would happen.Because Roan wasn\u2019t a noble like them, but a commoner.Roan didn\u2019t know what the nobles were thinking and sent an order to his troop members with a hand sign.Soon, wooden chairs were placed in front of the building.Simon sat at the upper seat and Roan took seat in front of him.The nobles were seated next to him.\u201cWHew. Whew.\u201dGeorge was still breathing roughly.He was kneeling up on the ground.But differently from before, light returned to his eyes and his mouth was slightly rised up.Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cFrom now on, we will proceed with baron George Ant\u2019s punish\u2026..\u201dWhen he talked up to there.\u201cDo you think you will be safe after treating a noble like this!\u201dAn exasperated voice.George, that had his head lowered down until now, looked at Roan fixedly and yelled.At the sudden situation, Simon and the nobles that were seated all put surprised expressions.\u2018There are some nobles that are acquaintances to me.\u2019George had something to trust.Now was a completely different situation to when he was alone in Amaranth troop.There were many nobles that would side up with him.And actually, some nobles mumbled with displeased expressions.\u201cWell, this is too much to do to a noble.\u201d\u201cIs a noble a noble for nothing? Ahem.\u201dThe atmosphere turned strange.But even so, Roan\u2019s expression was composedHe looked at George fixedly.\u201cBaron George Ant. You disregarded my orders as commander and moved the camp as you pleased, and gave great damages to your allies.\u201d\u201cHmph! The place I settled in was the safest!\u201dGeorge spat the words he had said before as an excuse.Roan didn\u2019t talk back and continued speaking.\u201cYou also mocked the deaths of the soldiers.\u201d\u201cMost of them were commoners! You wouldn\u2019t know if you were a noble like me, the death of commoner bastards aren\u2019t that important!\u201dGeorge yelled up.Murderous intent appeared in Roan\u2019s eyes.\u201cTrash like bastard. You still didn\u2019t get a hold of yourself.\u201dHe pulled Regate dagger from his waist.\u201cI, Roan, received the commanding and strategizing rights for the region of Tale by the 1st prince. At the same time, I also received permission about your punishment.\u201dHis voice became colder.\u201cGeorge Ant, I will bring down the punishment for your sins.\u201dAs he glanced, five members of Amaranth troop approached and lined up behind George Ant.The atmosphere wasn\u2019t normal.\u201cWhat, what! What are you planning to do!\u201dGeorge tried to hide that he was scared by yelling.Puk!Roan stabbed the dagger on the armrest of the chair.\u201cGeorge Ant. I\u2019m cutting down your ear because you didn\u2019t follow the orders of the commander even after having heard it.\u201d\u201cWh, what?\u201dGeorge asked back while getting surprised.And Simon and the others all had surprised expressions.\u201cRoan. Even so, cutting off the ear of a noble is a bit\u2026\u2026.\u201dSimon slightly said.He had a perplexed expression.But Roan didn\u2019t even look back and answered.\u201cWe have to cleanse the rotten parts. I am just following military discipline.\u201d\u201cMm. Even so\u2026\u2026\u201dSimon tried to continue speaking.Roan pulled Regate dagger and looked at Simon.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, I can give back the dagger and the commanding and strategizing rights.\u201dThe strongest method.Roan betted everything on himself.\u201cMm.\u201dSimon gulped.He realized how outstanding of a commander Roan was while looking through several battles, strategies, tactics and commands.\u2018I can\u2019t lose this kind of commander for a trash like noble bastard.\u2019To win the competition for the throne, an existence like Roan would be more advantageous than a noble that didn\u2019t have any abilities.\u2018But if the other nobles get shaken because of this\u2026\u2026.\u2019The entire base could shake.Then, the closest people to Simon and the ones leading troops Tio Ruin, Rael Piad and Delph Blick, that suffered damages thanks to George, stood up abruptly.\u201cMy prince! Thanks to George Ant, a thousand soldiers died and more than thousands got injured.\u201d\u201cThe sin George commited can\u2019t be forgiven, putting aside the nobility rank and commoner rank.\u201d\u201cThe soldiers of my territory ended up getting annihilated.\u201dPouring impeachments.Tio kneeled up one knee towards Simon.\u201cMilitary discipline is extremely strict on a battlefield. As you have given the commanding and strategizing rights to troop commander Roan, I think that it\u2019s proper to give him strength.\u201dDelph and Rael followed up.\u201cIf the military crumbles, there is no more victory.\u201dThe atmosphere changed in an instant.Even the nobles that were protesting shut their mouths.\u2018Viscount Tio Ruin.\u2019A faint smile appeared in Simon\u2019s mouth.He had read Tio.\u2018You stood up for me on what I was pondering about.\u2019Thanks to that, the flow had changed.\u2018The bastards that will still say noble this and noble that in this situation\u2026..\u2019His eyes became fierce.\u2018They are useless bastards.\u2019Even if he turned their backs and supported the 2nd or 3rd princes, he would applaud them.\u2018Bastards that don\u2019t have any ability and stick up living on power are rather a big hole and a weak point.\u2019Simon let out a short sigh.\u201cWhew. The words of Tio Ruin, Delph Blick and Rael Piad are right. The most important thing in a battlefield are the orders of a commander and discipline.\u201dHe looked at Roan\u2019s eyes fixedly.\u201cRoan. I was short on my thoughts and got shaken for a bit. Do as you please.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan replied with a short sigh and looked at George.A long sigh flowed out.\u2018I received the prince\u2019s permission.\u2019The gains of having bet everything was also clear.He had received the clear support from Simon and the three nobles.The nobles that were filled with displeasement couldn\u2019t say anything anymore.Roan made a handsign towards his troop members.The troop members that were standing at the back of George, pressed down his shoulders.\u201cHuh? Huh? Huh?\u201dGeorge tried to struggle with a surprised expression, but he couldn\u2019t move at all.He looked at the nobles at the surrounding with an earnest look.\u201cAr, are you all going to watch? We are nobles!\u201dTrembling voice.The nobles just shut their mouths and ignored George\u2019s sight.\u201cGeorge Ant! Shut up and receive your punishment!\u201dTio yelled with all his strength.\u201cTrash like bastard!\u201dRael\u2019s curses followed up.Meanwhile.Srung.One soldier pulled up a dagger.\u201cUak!\u201dGeorge yelled up at the chilly presence he felt behind his ear.At that moment.Uak!Both of George\u2019s ears got cut off cleanly with a terrible sound.\u201cUaaaak!\u201dGeorge let out a scream close to despair.Red blood flowed from both his ears.\u2018He, he really cut it off.\u2019\u2018He cut off the ear of a noble!\u2019The nobles and the surrounding soldiers all put surprised expressions.\u2018There\u2019s no difference in ranks in military discipline.\u2019\u2018If a noble makes a mistake, they also receive the same punishment!\u2019Every gulped dry saliva and looked at Roan.Then.Roan, that had his mouth shut, grabbed Regate dagger once again.\u201cGeorge Ant. I\u2019m carving your two eyes because you, one of the commander in the defensive lines couldn\u2019t read the flow of the battlefield properly and not marching out when monsters attacked the allied troops.\u201d\u201cHuhuk!\u201dEven the surrounding nobles gulped air.Simon also got surprised, but as he had entrusted everything to Roan, he didn\u2019t stand up.\u201cUooooo!\u201dGeorge was half insane.The troop member holding the dagger quickly carved out his two eyes.\u201cUaaaaaak!\u201dDespair followed up longly.However Roan wasn\u2019t planning to stop with this much.\u201cGeorge Ant. I\u2019m cutting up your tongue because of having mocked the deaths of your allies.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dThe nobles now had a pale face.They looked at George, that was covered with blood, with restless looks.\u201cUok! Uk!\u201dGeorge, that got his tongue grabbed, shook his head, but the members of Amaranth troop grabbed his head firmly so that he couldn\u2019t move.Slash.As the dagger moved, the long tongue fell to the ground.\u201cKuk!\u201dHe was now about to get cut from oxygen.George trembled like a person that got infected with malaria.Roan looked at him and stood up.His hands moved over to Travias spear.\u201cGeorge Ant. Lastly, I will behead you for not having respected the military discipline set up by Rinse kingdom.\u201dCheng!The spear showed itself with the sound of metal.The soldiers that were grabbing George firmly fell back.\u201cUoooo.\u201dGeorge trembled and started to get inclined to the front.Roan swung Travias spear as if he was waiting for it.Slash!The spear cleanly cut off the head.A strange silence fell in the surroundings.Meanwhile, Roan stabbed George\u2019s head and raised it high to the sky.A face that had it\u2019s ears, tongue and eyes cut off.George\u2019s head was covered in blood.\u201cEveryone listen attentively. Military discipline applies to everyone in a fair way.\u201dRoan looked at the nobles and soldiers and said.\u201cI\u2019m punishing the ones that committed a sin and lay a prize to the ones that rendered merits.\u201dA declaration.Everyone gulped dry saliva at Roan\u2019s words.Especially the nobles, that were drunk in their power, seemed to have woken up.\u2018A commoner troop commander has cut off the head of a noble but the prince isn\u2019t saying anything.\u2019\u2018No, it won\u2019t be weird for the heads of anyone to be cut off.\u2019\u2018If I make a mistake, my head will also get cut off.\u2019The nobles touched their necks.\u201cThose are right words!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything wrong!\u201dTio, Delph and Rael yelled with strength.They were backing up Roan\u2019s words so they couldn\u2019t think of anything weird.Roan handed over George\u2019s head to the troop members.\u201cPlace it on the entrance of the troop and put it as an example.\u201d\u201cYes. We understand.\u201dA loud yell.Respect was seen in the eyes of Amaranth troop.\u2018Even nobles of the kingdom can\u2019t do anything in front of troop commander.\u2019\u2018At least in the region of Tale, troop commander Roan is the best!\u2019Actually, even they haven\u2019t expected that he would come out this strongly.Roan smiled faintly towards the troop members and then turned hi head to look at Simon.The camp still had the heavy silence.Roan put back Regate dagger and kneeled up.A really courteous attitude.\u201cI finished the punishment for George Ant.\u201dAt those words, Simon got a hold of himself late.\u201cIt was an excellent decision.\u201dGeorge was dead anyways.As he decided to back up Roan, it would be better to be thorough with it.Simon looked at the expressions of the nobles once and then smiled towards Roan.\u201cFrom now on, I will still entrust you with the merit rewards and the punishments for the region of Tale.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRoan didn\u2019t decline.He knew how big of a weapon and what kind of strength this would give him.\u201cThen. Keep working hard from now on.\u201dSimon patted Roan\u2019s shoulders and then returned to the troop building with his vassals.Even the remaining nobles glanced everywhere and then disappeared to their own buildings.Roan, that got left alone, took in a deep breath.\u2018Now even nobles won\u2019t be able to disobey my orders.\u2019He had certainly overpowered their spirit.He thought up of the pale faces of the nobles.\u2018Now that I used the whip once, is it time to give them the carrot?\u2019Roan also knew that the nobles were the biggest support for Simon.He had to stop them from shaking altogether.The next plan was calmly set up in his head.Then, a familiar face appeared among the soldiers surrounding him.\u201cHuh?\u201dRoan, that didn\u2019t get surprised much, opened his eyes roundly.A really welcoming face.\u201cChris.\u201d\u201cTroop commander.\u201dChris, that was working in Pavor castle as his stage, had appeared in Mediasis village.The two people held hands and didn\u2019t speak for a long while.The soft smile and warm eyes worked instead of the conversation.\u201cTroop commander.\u201dAfter a while, Chris said with a low voice.Roan nodded.Chris\u2019s voice became even lower.\u201cThere\u2019s something I must check on.\u201dRoan just looked at CHris\u2019s eyes.Chris started to carefully speak.\u201cEven so, it seems like there\u2019s a spy among the remaining nobles in Tale.\u201d*****\u201cSo you are telling me to hold hands with Kallum?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA short answer.But the expression of the man that answered was gentle.\u201cMm.\u201dThe youth that listened to the answer touched his chin with one hand and frowned.\u2018So I have to hold hands with my younger brother\u2026\u2026..\u2019\u201cCount Chase. Are you saying that the situation in my brother Simon\u2019s side is that good?\u201d\u201cYes. If it goes on like this, the 1st prince will get really ahead of the competition for the throne.\u201dThe man with a serious expression was count Jonathan Chase.He said in a low voice as if he was whispering.\u201cActually, the 1st prince is staying in the region of Tale that\u2019s at the north of the lake. The responsible for that place is someone called Roan, that beheaded viscount Benjamin Doyle. As he has quite the ability, it seems like he is blocking the monsters in Tale really outstandingly.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that precisely?\u201d\u201cWhen the thing of viscount Doyle happened, I sent some commander underlings and made them infiltrate his troop.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..\u201dTommy let out a low exclamation.His eyes shone.\u201cIf we connect them with our own spies\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s much better for them not to know each other.\u201dJonathan quickly shook his head.\u201cBecause then, even if one side gets discovered, the other one will be able to stay alive.\u201d\u201cMm. That\u2019s also right\u2026\u2026..\u201dTommy admitted it in an instant and nodded.Jonathan let out a short sigh.\u201cWhew. For now, we have to concentrate on holding hands with the 3rd prince.\u201d\u201cBut will Kallum want to hold hands with me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201dA smile appeared in Jonathan\u2019s face.He said with a really confident expression.\u201cSend me to the 3rd prince. I will certainly convince him.\u201d\u201cOh! It seems like you are confident.\u201dTommy smiled brightly and nodded.Jonathan kneeled up.\u201cI\u2019m just doing my best for the prince.\u201dA really polite and mannered look.Tommy nodded with a satisfied expression.\u201cFine. I will entrust that to you. If this just turns out well, I will give you a big reward.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dJonathan hurriedly bowed.The smile in his face became denser.\u2018Kuk! Then, shall we start working earnestly?\u2019A kind of cold eyes.That resembled the eyes of a snake.EndTL: Sponsored chapter. Came out late hehe.

darkness.Roan climbed a watchtower in the south alone.Even the stars and the moon were caught in the dim clouds.\u2018A spy\u2026\u2026\u2019The news Chris brought two days ago were quite shocking.\u2018I thought that I could have as much normal soldiers as I wanted.\u2019But he hadn\u2019t expected that there may be a spy among the nobles escorting Simon.\u2018And two nobles leading troops at that.\u2019There were two spies which Chris revealed through the agency.They were baron Elton Coat and baron Luke Aip.Among them, Luke was the spy of Tommy Rinse and Elton of Kallum Rinse.And the two people didn\u2019t know the identity of each other.\u2018On top of that, this isn\u2019t the end.\u2019Chris expected that one of the two spies would have at least 2 more accomplices.\u2018For now, it\u2019s important to discover the spies that didn\u2019t get revealed.\u2019Until then, he was planning to move Luke and Elton to the rear camp.He was planning to examine how they were communicating with their respective princes and find the ones that showed similar actions.\u201cWhew.\u201dRoan let out a long sigh.A feeling that the situation was becoming too complicated so suddenly.His rank was still a troop commander but the things he was doing was the same a noble did.\u2018Here on, after getting rid of George Ant, all the other nobles are checking on me.Actually, just slaying George\u2019s neck was a big provocation.If Simon got swept up in political reasonings, he would have gotten chased out of the army or even lost his life.But Roan trusted in his decision.No, He believed in his eyes on looking at people.He thought that if it was Simon, that viewed personal ability with importance and was an ambitious person, he would take his side.And fortunately, his gamble on betting everything in one side succeeded.Simon had given wings to Roan.Currently, most of the nobles were gulping down their complaints because of the declarations of Simon, Tio and Rael.Thanks to that, a strange atmosphere was flowing in the center of the troop\u2019s HQ.Even while following Simon\u2019s orders and admitting Roan\u2019s abilities, it was difficult to easily recognize Roan that was different from birth.Just like you were walking on thin ice.\u2018Even so, obtaining the support of baron Rael Piad is a great gain.\u2019Roan assigned all of George\u2019s soldiers to Rael.Rael, that lost all of his soldiers he was commanding, got greatly moved at the unexpected treatment.He thanked Roan in a big way and declared his support one more time.\u2018Is it now time to catch the hearts of the other nobles too?\u2019He didn\u2019t want to give them goods such as money or jewels.\u2018I\u2019m showing them my abilities.\u2019An outstanding ability that would make them want to follow him.He was planning to show them that.Roan looked at the plains spread above the watchtower.Although there was darkness, Roan could see everything brightly as if it was midday thanks to Kalian tear.\u2018Now, shall we start enjoying this?\u2019he was planning to sweat a big one.His heart beat faster and blood circulated quickly.*****First, Roan dispatched Luke and Elton to the northern boundary of Tale.They couldn\u2019t understand why they had to move to the rear, but Roan put a convincible excuse and convinced them.That because of George, they lost a lot of ground in the south and that the range of the movements of the monsters spread in the north.At the word that it was a really important task, Luke and Elton moved towards the north without saying anything else.Followed by that, Roan summoned all the nobles and set up a new subjugation plan.For now, there was a need to move the defensive line to the south, now that it was pushed from the north.Roan entrusted this task to Tio Ruin, Delph Blick and Rael Piad.They were a force supporting him strongly.And Roan decided to take the nobles that felt antipathy against him and subjugate the monsters in the south.The nobles didn\u2019t speak back and agreed on Roan\u2019s opinions.They had already seen what happened to George after ignoring his orders.The next day Tio, Delph, and Rael left the HQ\u2019s.Simon, that had the biggest force, lead his troop and went on a personal subjugation around Mediasis village.Roan quickly gathered the remaining nobles and went on a conference.\u201cBased on the reports of the information squad\u2026..\u201dWhen setting up tactics and strategies, they included the analyzed and gathered information of the information squad.This tactic was also a really important one to Roan.He was planning to show his abilities as a commander properly to the nobles that felt antipathy towards him.He even took the night off to have a meeting with the centurions.Roan smiled towards the nobles listening at his words.\u2018I will show you that a battlefield can be designed.\u2019The conference continued like that for a while.After a while, when the conference ended, the nobles started to get out of the meeting room one by one.\u201cHow was it? The conference we just had?\u201d\u201cI wonder. A kind of groundless feeling. Honestly speaking, they are all nonsense words.\u201d\u201cIt seems like he got many things right and got the nickname of ghost of the battlefield, and he got lost in that name.\u201dSeveral nobles thought up of the meeting they just had and laughed ridiculing him.\u201cMonsters will appear in the south plains of Mediasis village before the sun sets, so be prepared beforehand and just scare them?\u201d\u201cI just have to be hidden in the weeds of the northeast. That the scared monsters will certainly flee over there.\u201d\u201cEven so, you are all better than me. I wonder. I just have to take 100 soldiers\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dSeveral words came and went as if they couldn\u2019t understand it at all.\u201cIt seems like he\u2019s trusting that information something too much.\u201d\u201cYeah. For now, let\u2019s just wait until night.\u201d\u201cIf monsters really do appear.\u201dA cynical and fishy smile appeared in the faces of the nobles.They hoped that Roan made a big mistake so he placed down the commanding and strategizing rights.And like that, the sun that was right above them started to move to the west little by little.And just like a lie.Deng! Deng! Deng! Jing! Jing! Jing!The sound notifying the appearance of monsters was heard.\u201cMo, monsters really appeared?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly before the sun set.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dThe nobles gulped the silence with surprised expressions.But they couldn\u2019t stay like that forever.\u201cCharge!\u201d\u201cCharge!\u201dThey quickly charged like Roan\u2019s orders.Each commander that had 2.000 soldiers lead their troop and charged out.Roan stood at the watchtower and saw that.A smile appeared in his face.\u2018Everything will flow just like I want.\u2019*****The battlefield did indeed flow like Roan\u2019s plans and expectations.The monsters that appeared at the south plains got perplexed at the attack of the nobles and fled towards the weeds in the north.But the nobles that received Roan\u2019s orders were already waiting for them in ambush.On top of that, the camps, traps and obstacles they had set up before the exodus started was taking place everywhere.Kiek!The monsters scattered to the sides at the unexpected ambush.\u201cDon\u2019t chase them! Our role is up to here!\u201dThe soldiers that were waiting in ambush protected their place instead of chasing them.A surprised look could be seen in their eyes.\u2018Everything is happening like troop commander Roan said.\u2019The monsters that fled while scattering to the sides had to change direction again while not being able to move much.Roan had precisely read their feeling route.Soldiers that amounted to 100 and 500 were taking place in several roads.Jing! Jing! Jing! Deng! Deng! Deng!The surged flag and the noisy jing and drum.The monsters got surprised and ran towards the east where they couldn\u2019t feel any presence.The monsters that were scattered gathered up once again.And they finally arrived at the end of the east plains.Their front was blocked with the harsh mountains and the surroundings only had long weeds.\u201cIt\u2019s really surprising.\u201d\u201cThe movements of the monsters are exactly the same as troop commander ROan said.\u201d\u201cI, is this possible to guess this precisely?\u201dThey weren\u2019t even humans, but monsters.The monsters that move with their instincts rather than rationality.They were an existence that was that much harder to guess.Then.\u201cThey appeared precisely.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not even an ounce of mistake.\u201dThe noble\u2019s sights moved towards the west.The high troop flag surged above the weeds.Amaranth troop had appeared at the rear of the monsters.At the same time.Sweeeeek!Thousands of arrows split the dark sky.Pubububuk!The dry weeds caught fire.Kiiiek!The monsters got swept up in fire in an instant.And.Tat!Roan charged the ground and entered the path of fire.A valiant and overwhelming look.CHeng!Travias spear became longer with the sound of metal.Mana of a faint light flowed in the spear.Flamdor mana technique exploded his body temperature.Flaaaaame!The fire burning the plains made Roan stronger.Hwak!On top of that the red flames moved following Roan\u2019s movements and spear as if it was dancing.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhh.\u201dThe nobles that were looking at that all opened their mouths with surprised looks.The fire dancing along the spear.That felt just like looking at the owner of fire, at the fire monarch.Gulp.Everyone gulped dry saliva.As they saw Roan performing martial arts right before their eyes, one part of his heart became chilled.\u2018Ri, right. The 1st prince wouldn\u2019t have named an unsophisticated person as the responsible for a region.\u2019\u2018Outstanding insight, strategy, and tactics. On top of that martial arts!\u2019They got goosebumps.Meanwhile, the fire that was covering the monsters was dying out little by little.The sound of the horn trumpet was heard as if it was waiting for it.Puuuu!At the same time, Amaranth troop that was waiting at the rear ran in.A charging look while holding a small shield in front of them!Bang!The clash of Amaranth troop and the monsters.The battle had just started, but it was already coming to an end.The monsters weren\u2019t an opponent for Roan and Amaranth troop.*****The battle already ended with the complete victory for Amaranth troop.The monsters got exterminated without being able to resist properly.Roan and the nobles returned to the HQ while leading their troops.\u201cWaaaa!\u201d\u201cAmaranth! Amaranth! \u201c\u201cRoan! Roan!\u201dThe soldiers guarding the HQ cheered up at the returning troops.Roan went to the building of the troop with a composed expression.And the nobles deployed in this battle followed his back.Their expression was kind of awkward.\u2018We did win, but I don\u2019t know if we have to feel good or not.\u2019\u2018I hoped he slipped.\u2019\u2018It feels like he just did everything alone.\u2019An uncomfortable feeling.Then, Roan that sat up at the upper seat of the conference room, stood up and saluted.\u201cWe could win this battle thanks to you.\u201dA polite and well mannered look.\u201cHuh?\u201dAt the sudden situation, the nobles put confused expressions.One of them said with a bit blunt voice.\u201cIsn\u2019t troop commander Roan that raised the biggest merits anyways?\u201dAt those words Roan shook his head.\u201cIt was thanks to you performing your roles perfectly. I have just taken care of the remaining things. The ones that raised the biggest merits this time\u2026\u2026\u201dHe paused for a moment and bowed once again.\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dAwkward coughs were heard everywhere.They hadn\u2019t expected to hear Roan complimenting them here.\u2018He isn\u2019t that bad of a guy.\u2019They slightly thought like that.\u2018On top of that, his martial arts we saw in the battlefield is also outstanding.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s a guy that has the possibilities to become bigger than this.\u2019\u2018After the subjugation ends, he may be able to become a noble.\u2019Then, Roan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI will record this well and report it when the merits awards happen.\u201d\u201cAhem. This wasn\u2019t that much. Hahaha.\u201dLaugher that seemed they didn\u2019t dislike it was heard.The nobles were satisfied.Currently, Roan was receiving Simon\u2019s support and recognition.If that Roan reported the merits himself, there was a high possibility to get in Simon\u2019s eyes.\u2018It\u2019s a good opportunity.\u2019\u2018Right. If it\u2019s only for this, we can still pretend to be on good terms with Roan.\u2019The nobles smiled satisfiedly and nodded.But of course, not all the nobles were thinking of the same thing.\u2018Hmph! Insignificant bastard.\u2019\u2018Is he using the whip and carrot? Hmph!\u2019Displeasement was seen in some nobles.But they forced not to show it.Because it was still Roan the responsible one for Tale.\u2018Anyways, some are showing goodwill.\u2019Roan looked at the expressions of the nobles and put a smile.He knew really well that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the hearts of the nobles with just this much whipping and carrots.But the relationship of pulling and pushing the nobles had just started.\u2018I will make you not able to get a hold of yourselves.\u2019A faint smile appeared in his face.Roan stood up and slightly bowed.\u201cEveryone, you have done great today.\u201dTHe after battle conference ended like that.The nobles started to get out of the room one by one.And some of them even approached Roan and shook hands.Roan, that got left alone, didn\u2019t rest and took out a thick roll of paper.Even when big and small battles were occurring, he didn\u2019t neglect studying.\u2018There are still a lot of lacking points.\u2019There were many things he couldn\u2019t do just with talent and effort in his past life.Because of that, he lost his life as a squad commander.But in this life, he became responsible for a region and became able to dream of something bigger.\u2018I have to learn more, and put more effort.\u2019He needed to have all the groundings.He didn\u2019t want to become someone that only shone.\u201cWell, shall I organize the situation of the 2nd and 3rd princes for now?\u201dRoan grabbed a pen and took in a deep breath.Scribble. Scribble.For a while, only the sound of the pen rolling was heard in the conference room.*****\u201cHahaha!\u201dSimon laughed in a big way and nodded.He was really satisfied with the current situation.Even until the defensive line was greatly pushed to the south because of George Ant, he thought that the subjugation was going in a wrong way.On top of that, Roan got rid of George the insides became greatly shaken.If this was notified to the political circle, several nobles could have repulsed him.At the slip, he could get this entire base shaken.Simon soon contacted to his supporter, Bradley Webster.Bradley, that was keeping in check the other dukes, moved quickly at Simon\u2019s call.He roamed among the society of Miller and spread George Ant\u2019s self indulgence and incapability.He didn\u2019t only do that, but he also exaggerated Roan\u2019s merits, who he had selected and was supporting and reported it to several nobles of the royal palace.Thanks to that, Simon was rumored to be an insightful person that recognized someone with ability and also as a brave general.But of course, the one getting the most interest was Roan.Roan had started to spread his name even when he didn\u2019t know that was happening.\u2018The only problem left are my two brothers\u2026\u2026.\u2019After the subjugation ends, Tommy and Kallum will probably bet on the case Roan cut off George\u2019s head.\u2018But by then it will already be too late. Huhuhu.\u2019He had a method he had thought of.Simon\u2019s eyes twisted scarily.\u2018For them to grab hands.\u2019He hadn\u2019t expected for his two brothers join forces.Thanks to that, the difference between him and his brothers wasn\u2019t that big.\u2018Even so, it\u2019s clear that i\u2019m far ahead of the subjugation.\u2019Even if he didn\u2019t get immediately named as the successor for the throne, he would be a lot farther in the competition.\u2018I did well on entrusting Roan with Tale.\u2019This was all thanks to Roan.Roan grasped everything that happened in the region of Tale as precisely as if it was happening above his palms and moved according to it.Thanks to that, differently from the other regions, the monsters in Tale couldn\u2019t evenraise their spirits properly.The defensive line that got pushed to the north was set up again in the south, where Poskein lake was, and the monsters that wer stirring fiercely also started to reduce as more time passed.\u2018It\u2019s about time the subjugation ends.\u2019His chest swelled up.\u201cHahaha!\u201dSimon couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and burst out of laughter.The commander of the knights Ralph Tains, that was escorting him at the back, smiled brightly.Then, someone knocked on the door.Knock. Knock. Knock.At the same time, a welcoming voice was heard.\u201cOh! Come in.\u201dRight after he permitted it, Roan entered the room.Although he did seem tired because of the continued battles, his eyes were still shining brightly.\u201cHahaha! Roan. It seems like the subjugation is starting to end! The number of monsters decreased a lot! Hahaha!\u201dHe asked back after he laughed out loud.\u201cRight. What did you come for today?\u201dIf he had a favour, he was planning to listen everything.Simon was that happy and enjoying it.In the other side, Roan\u2019s expression was quite dark.\u201cA strange information has entered us.\u201d\u201cInformation?\u201dSimon frowned.Roan continued saying with a calm voice.\u201cEven so, we will have to make the defenses to be more solid.\u201d\u201cWhy that so suddenl\u2026\u2026..\u201dRecently, the number of monsters had decreased by a lot.And Simon thought that the subjugation was coming to an end.But Roan had rather said that they should strengthen their defenses.He couldn\u2019t understand at all.Roan took in a breath and slowly replied.\u201cIt seems like the monsters are preparing for the last strike.\u201dA low voice.Roan\u2019s eyes shone.He couldn\u2019t say it honestly but it was now time for that to happen.\u2018Now the final exodus will start.\u2019EndTL: Regular chapter!Translator : SubakProofreader: st8_lupe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
