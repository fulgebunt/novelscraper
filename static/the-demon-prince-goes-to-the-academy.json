    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1There was a saying that if you\u2019ve committed a crime, you\u2019d absolutely get punished. It\u2019s a saying that almost never came to fruition.There was another saying.If you were to go to hell you\u2019d have to pay for all your wrongdoings, no matter how small. Of course, I didn\u2019t agree with that one either.This wasn\u2019t really a saying and more of something I experienced myself.If a situation was just too incomprehensible, a person\u2019s thought process would turn rather simple.In a certain office, I was forced to make a certain choice by some sour-faced woman wearing a suit.It was rather complicated, so let\u2019s put it simple.Simply put.This thing called Hell existed and I think I died.The cause of my death was also rather simple.It was \u2018Acute myocardial infarction due to high blood pressure, which caused a cardiac arrest\u2019.My blood pressure suddenly went up like this, because of a malicious comment I was reading. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.My blood pressure went up because of some bad comment? Just for that reason? Really?My eyes grew a bit distant.That\u2019s supposed to be my last memory?\u201cPlease sign this quickly.\u201dShe threw a form in front of me. There was some stuff written on it, with a blank space presumably for my signature below.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, I\u2019m dead? I, I just saw some malicious comments which made my blood pressure rise and then I just died? People can die like this?\u201d\u201cDo people always have to die for great reasons? There are a lot of people who die just by slipping on an icy road. Alright, hurry up and make your choice now.\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t want to believe it, I didn\u2019t have a choice in that matter.\u2026\u2026\u2026Anyway, I was in hell now.It was up to myself if I took the deal or just went right down.I just had to sign.I was forced to make a choice that I never thought I\u2019d ever have to make.There were some lines written on this form that I was more than familiar with.[The City of the Dead][Surviving in the Ruined World][The Hunter became a Manager][The Trash returned][Somehow, the Game became Reality, but I\u2019m just a Janitor][The Demon King is Dead]These were all titles of novels I wrote.My charges were \u2018Being a repeat offender\u2019 and \u2018Having no prospects at all\u2019.For that I was to be sent into the world of one of the novels I wrote.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll get sent into one my novels?\u201d\u201cYes. As to which character or novel you\u2019ll inhabit is up to chance.\u201dShit.I should have written more peaceful novels.* * *This was the explanation I got from this person I presumed to be a Grim Reaper or a Hell\u2019s Employee.Every single person sinned.Except for very rare cases, no one immediately got sent to heaven. That\u2019s why everyone goes through the process of atoning for the petty sins one had accumulated through their life.Additionally, since there were a multitude of different sins, the method for atonement differed from person to person.I was a novelist.A web novel author who somehow managed to make ends meet with novels one could describe as second- or third-rate.My biggest sin was leaving behind a lot of work throughout the years as a commercial writer.I told the readers who were reading my stories well that it was a writer\u2019s biggest sin to leave a story unfinished, before calmly digging up my sub-account to publish other works.\u201cTo be honest, sins committed by individuals are often only on the minor side, but if the number of these small sins accumulate, don\u2019t you think the scale of said sins would increase?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026.\u201dWas it decided by simple arithmetics? Was that really okay?Honestly though, just listening to her voice sent a shiver down my spine.The bitter voice coming out of the Grim Reaper\u2019s mouth seemed to directly pierce through my heart. This was on a completely different scale than normal bitterness.What if my blood pressure rose again? What would happen if I died again after I already died?My sins were just small ones that accumulated throughout my life.Anyway, the punishment I had to endure was being sent into a random character of a novel I wrote and surviving until the \u2018end\u2019.If I manage to do that, I\u2019d get sent to heaven.Apparently there were a lot of people that just got sent straight to hell, so I had it good, that\u2019s how the Grim Reaper tried to console me, though that didn\u2019t really work.\u201cAs it is a novel you wrote, wouldn\u2019t you know everything about it and what would happen in it? This can\u2019t even be called a punishment, now can it? In fact, wouldn\u2019t it be rather easy for you?\u201dThe Grim Reaper didn\u2019t even look at me as she nonchalantly said this to me.\u201cNo, see. That depends on the novel\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, I, uh\u2026\u2026I only wrote novels in which a lot of people die\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell congrats then. Think of it as a trivial punishment for your disregard of life then. It seems you don\u2019t understand the preciousness of life.\u201dYou bastard, it\u2019s not like I killed anyone in reality, now did I?! It\u2019s just fiction!No, if I actually knew I\u2019d one day have to live in one of the worlds I created, I certainly would have written something with a dreamland amusement park as the setting, wouldn\u2019t I?How should I have known that I\u2019d get punished for writing things like that, but who\u2019d write a novel with that in mind in the first place? Who\u2019d write about a master gunsman in their novel and didn\u2019t give him a gun?!This was all just in my head! Just because I wrote down I could punch as fast as lightning, didn\u2019t mean I actually could pull that off.On top of that, I was afflicted with a minor case of pretentiousitis, so I wrote a lot of stories about disastrous situations in which a lot of people died. To add to that, I was addicted to writing bad endings to the point that people said that, if one of my stories had a happy ending, I\u2019d have gone crazy.Maybe my real sin was that I messed with my readers\u2019 feelings with my bad endings all year round.No, wasn\u2019t that actually rather convincing?So what actually were the novels I wrote?What would happen to me if I were transported into one of them?[City of the Dead]A zombie novel.I was quite sure I\u2019d die in a single day.[Surviving in the Ruined World]Post-Apocalypse.I was here in hell because I couldn\u2019t even survive in our peaceful, normal world, you know? Didn\u2019t I just get killed by some malicious comments?[The Demon King is Dead]This novel got the worst ratings, but in my opinion it was the best.Because this was a slice-of-life novel.As I was criticized by my readers for always writing bad ends, I wrote this novel that didn\u2019t have any serious global crisis from beginning to end. I actually didn\u2019t finish it, but the beginning was rose-colored, very refreshing and peaceful.This novel told the story of what happened after the heroes defeated the final boss in the prologue.That\u2019s why its title was \u2018The Demon King is Dead\u2019.This story took place after the death of the Demon King after all.At least it\u2019s not like my other stuff, where one had to fight for one\u2019s survival from start to finish.I must get this one. No matter what.I just had to get this one!Speaking of the results.It worked out just the way I wanted.As a result of a random lottery, I was to become the \u201cDemon King\u2019s son\u201d of [The Demon King is Dead].* * *The Demon King\u2019s son wasn\u2019t a character that even made an appearance in my novel in the first place.She told me that I\u2019d get put into a random character, however I actually got something that couldn\u2019t even be called a character.An unlucky person would break their nose even if they fell backwards, huh.That\u2019s what she told me.Didn\u2019t I just die because I got too mad about some comments which led my blood pressure to rise?Just as I was relieved that I drew the safest novel, I got put into a position in which I\u2019d die right at the start!I wouldn\u2019t even be the Demon King, but just a prince.It would have been much better if I were the Demon King. For example, if I were the Demon King I\u2019d also be the highest-level existence of the Demon realm, so I could have just stayed put, surrendered or ran away.Even though the Demon King dies right at the start, he\u2019s not to be trifled with.However, I was just a prince of the Demon Realm who just turned 17.Valier Jr.Age : 17Status : [Force: 3.4(F)][Agility 4.3(F+)][Dexterity 5.2(D-)][Magic power 9.9(C-)][Strength 5.7(D-)]Race : ArcdemonTalent : NoneAbilities[Demon Domination D](Unique to Arcdemons)Comprehensive Ability Assessment \u2013 Lowest Rank DemonCombat Level Assessment \u2013 FDespite getting deceived by this novel, fortunately I was still able to find out who I actually was. A game-like screen appeared before me.I never put this setting into my novel, so was this something those guys who sent me here gave me out of pity?So, in terms of tropes, I was in a fairly common situation, in which an author somehow ended up in his own novel with a game system.However, no matter how common the trope was, it would never feel like a familiar situation if it suddenly happened to oneself in reality.I didn\u2019t appreciate this convenient ability in the slightest.Shouldn\u2019t the kin of the Demon King be of a different caliber?Arcdemon was a rather simple species, but wasn\u2019t my current condition basically the worst of the worst?This guy had no fighting capabilities.I saw something that seemed like an ability to rule over all demons, but all around me were just dead demons.What a hellish situation.It was the start of the prologue.[Event Quest: Downfall][Description : The defeat of the Demon King\u2019s army is imminent, but you\u2019re powerless to do anything. Do your best to survive.][Goal : Escape the Demon King\u2019s Castle][Reward : 100 achievement points]All I could do was run.I didn\u2019t even pay attention to that mysterious system window that appeared in front of me.-Kabaang! Bababaaang!\u201cCrazy!\u201dThere\u2019s nothing I could do to stop the war.It seemed like the Demon King and the hero\u2019s party were already fiercely fighting inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle.The violent explosions and thunderous roars made me realize that this bloody war was really happening.Outside, there were shouts, screams and cries of monsters as a siege was taking place. They seemed to have already broken through.The hallways were already lined with dead or fallen demons.I couldn\u2019t even imagine a person dying in front of me, but it was even worse seeing monsters that have only existed in my head previously dying right there.Still, maybe because I felt like death was imminent, I kept running.I thought I\u2019d die if I stopped to vomit.Aren\u2019t I such a good prince of the Demon Realm?\u201cDamn iiiiiiiit!\u201dHowever, having this title while the Demon Realm was falling apart was much more dangerous!I\u2019d rather replace it with Human Soldier 1!I\u2019m really confident that I can switch sides and bow down to whoever!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2In this slice-of-life novel I\u2019ve written, I was experiencing the most violent event as an involved party, to be exact, as a victim.Strange letters I didn\u2019t recognize were carved into the walls above each entrance to the numerous rooms of the Demon King\u2019s castle. However, I was able to read them.Although this, too, was a common setting, it still felt uncomfortable, maybe because I was experiencing it myself.You didn\u2019t know how it felt to suddenly be able to read letters you were unfamiliar with, until you experienced it yourself.I passed by numerous rooms, including the dining hall, the kitchen, the armory, the magic item storage, the alchemy lab, the prison and the kennel.Of course, there were no signs pointing to a secret passage\u00a0 or something.I mean, it would have been weird If they put something like that on display, but couldn\u2019t they at least mark it like an emergency exit?I must say, it felt really strange being able to read a language I have never heard of before, but that couldn\u2019t be helped now.Naturally, the layout of the Demon King\u2019s castle, which never appeared again after the Prologue, didn\u2019t magically appear in my head!In those other possession stories, when a writer or an avid reader entered the book\u2019s world, they immediately knew what to look for.That was just ridiculous!I didn\u2019t have a single clue about these things, even though I wrote it!I\u2019ve never thought about stuff like that. Why should I describe or imagine places that weren\u2019t part of the main stage?!Although, I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t have remembered the layout even if I set it up properly!Even the things I was wearing were just those fancy clothes the demonic royal family wore, not a single special magical item.-Kugong! Kugogogong!This place was as complex as a maze\u2026 I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever find an exit, but in this situation I had no other choice, but to just wander around through this castle even though I hold the title of Prince of the Demon Realm.Let\u2019s think.I didn\u2019t really know what I was hoping would happen, but I had to think.There\u2019s no way to find out the structure of the Demon King\u2019s castle no matter how long I thought about it, as I didn\u2019t even know it to begin with.I didn\u2019t even see any of my loyal subordinates that could help me out or tell me where to go.Shouldn\u2019t there be someone like this sticking to my side?They\u2019d provide explanations on this world\u2019s common sense and the current situation without being prompted to.Something like: \u201cOh, this is this and that, but in this and this situation, this is where you\u2019d blah, blah!\u201dThey\u2019d either die right after they fulfilled their role or they became my advisor!Why didn\u2019t I have someone like that?!Just because I was this novel\u2019s writer, did they\u00a0 think I didn\u2019t need someone like that?The Demon King would die in today\u2019s battle.I didn\u2019t know if there was a genre for this, but I tried writing this novel in the style of a Post-ending story.A happy world after the story came to its conclusion.The part where everyone lived happily ever after, after defeating the Demon King.The world after the story of the heroes\u2019 journey to defeat the Demon King came to its conclusion after his death.That\u2019s the stage of [The Demon King is Dead].The hero and his party, who were the protagonists of the imaginary original story, are supposed to die here as well.Like this, the only way they get mentioned in the story is when they get praised as the heroes who saved the world. Except in the Prologue, they didn\u2019t have any other appearances.I had to come up with something.I had to come up with a way for me to survive.It had nothing to do with me that the Demon King, who was only my father, would die in this setting.If I was just a day earlier I could have maybe done something, but things were already set in motion.I needed someone to guide me, anyone who recognized me would do, the Demon King\u2019s attendant, anyone, but I didn\u2019t even catch the glimpse of a single hair of someone like that.They might already be dead or locked in battle with the human forces trying to besiege the castle outside.And the hero party who infiltrated through the castle\u2019s basement should\u2019ve been fighting with the Demon King in the audience hall.I could escape using that underground passage, but I had no idea where it was.The hero knows this Castle better than me, the Demon Prince! That was my situation!-Ruuuumble!Just the sounds coming from the main stage were really terrifying.After the Demon King died, the castle would fall.The strong magic barrier that was supported by the Demon King\u2019s Mana would be lifted, and human soldiers would rush in here like surging waves.I couldn\u2019t look in the mirror, but I could feel a pair of horns on my head.I didn\u2019t know how different I looked from humans, but this alone was enough to reveal that I was a demon.How was I supposed to survive in a situation like this?No matter how much you knew what was going to happen in the future, what\u2019s the point of that if you were born right before a truck drives you over?The Title of Demon Prince and the advantages I actually had were only useful if I was alive!I only found out that I died a few hours ago, but here I was already on the verge of dying again.\u201cHah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dI was already out of breath, because I ran around the Demon King\u2019s castle without knowing where I was.Wasn\u2019t there anything special about the Demon King\u2019s bloodline?Or was it because I was still so young?No, this body was just hella weak.How could I be 17 and have such poor stamina? This body should be in its prime!I have no idea what talents this blood brought with it, but for now it was clearly useless.After running for some time, I finally was able to see my own face reflected in a window.I looked at it, but it didn\u2019t seem much different from a human\u2019s.I had horns on my head though.No.These horns were the only thing that stood out besides\u2026I looked quite handsome.\u201cOh, oh\u2026. Oh!\u201dHandsome.No, now wasn\u2019t the time for this. Absolutely not.It was all over if I died!To think I\u2019d feel even the slightest bit of happiness in this kind of situation\u2026.I felt more miserable about getting happy. I tried to endure not to shout out in fear or joy.If I survive this place, I\u2019ll treat this body preciously. I wish I could show my ex-girlfriend my current body, though I won\u2019t be able to see her ever again\u2026Let\u2019s calm down for now.First, the horns.The horns on my head were a problem.If the human army caught me like this, I should be grateful if they just quietly cut my head off.There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019d do even worse.If I knew how to use magic, maybe I could have changed my appearance with magic.Huh?I suddenly stopped running.\u201cThat place!\u201dI quickly turned around and ran back.That method might be surprisingly simple. So simple, one could call it ridiculous.Although I had no clue about the Demon King\u2019s castle\u2019s layout, I definitely remembered the places I passed by.Although I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s in those rooms or what I could do in them.In the places I passed by, there might be something that could save me somehow.-Rumble\u2026.The quaking was starting to abate.It seemed like the fight had stopped.If the Demon King died, the castle would fall immediately.I had no time to lose.* * *\u201cQuickly\u2026. Quickly\u2026.\u201dThe first place I went into was the magic item storage.I didn\u2019t have a clue what was in there, but there had to be something in there that could help me out.There were a lot of magic items rolling around, but those weren\u2019t things I wanted.I went to the scroll storage where scrolls were piled up to the ceiling. There were some missing, but fortunately they were ordered and had the spells they contained written on them.The thing I was looking for was none other than a teleport scroll.Getting out of this place somehow was my top priority.I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do next, but that was something to think about after I got out of here alive.[Inferno][Glacial Strike][Blizzard][Blazing Storm]...There was a scroll cabinet that was apparently once full of powerful magic scrolls, but now it was empty.As a writer, there were many things I had no idea about, but I did know about this world\u2019s common sense and world view.Scrolls that made it easy to cast spells were sinfully expensive and difficult to make.Scrolls containing such powerful attack magic were being treated as powerful strategic weapons by modern standards.Scrolls could even be used by those who didn\u2019t know how to use magic simply by opening them.So they were worth their price.However, currently, the magic scroll cabinet that contained those powerful magic scrolls was empty.We were in the state of an all out war now after all. They took whatever they could with them.Damn it, what if they took all the teleportation scrolls with them? I don\u2019t know how they were going to use them, but that was definitely a possibility.I searched the huge scroll storage and looked through countless scrolls.I didn\u2019t have much time.Most of the attack magic scrolls got taken out, but the storage was still overflowing with scrolls.There were some so small, I couldn\u2019t even tell what magic they contained.Many subtype scrolls were left behind, such as fascination, delusion, illusion etc.Obviously teleportation was one of the highest leveled magic spells in this world.Teleport scrolls weren\u2019t common, but this was the Demon King\u2019s castle, for crying out loud.And after looking at that highest-level scroll cabinet just now, it was pretty clear that they should have teleport scrolls as well.\u201cFound it!\u201dAmong the pile of countless scrolls, I finally found it.[Teleport]I didn\u2019t really know where to go.I\u2019ll just think about where to go after I cast the magic.As long as it wasn\u2019t this place, I was fine with anywhere.Even somewhere in the human realm was fine.It may have taken me 10 minutes or maybe an hour to find this, but death came closer with each passing second, so I just opened the scroll quickly.And then.Nothing happened.[Teleporting is forbidden in this area.]\u201cOh my god!\u201dThe barrier made it impossible to use space related skills or magic that moved one through space inside of it.Even Though the Demon King was dead, was the barrier that interrupted space travel still active?Well, if that weren\u2019t the case the heroes would\u2019ve just teleported in and wouldn\u2019t have used a secret passage.I tried to justify my thoughtless rough writing.The heroes didn\u2019t have to teleport, they just entered the Demon King\u2019s castle through a secret passage.Wasn\u2019t it obvious? If they could teleport, why would they use a secret passage?There should\u2019ve been that kind of comment.If someone commented something like this while I was still alive, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten punished like this.I didn\u2019t know about warp gates, but teleport scrolls were out of question now.There might be such a gate somewhere, but even if there was, I wouldn\u2019t know where it was.-Waaaaaaah!Shouts began to echo from afar.The human army must be pushing the demon army back, after their morale had fallen to the bottom, like autumn leaves.Should I just die like this?If I just had some offensive magic scrolls here, I\u2019d have bought time with those.However, there were only auxiliary magic scrolls, that had no use in war, here.I was the Prince of the Demon Realm, but I turned out to be some loser dog with no power.The fancy clothes I wore on my body were only to show that I was the main character of the Demon Realm\u2026\u2026A minute later.Fancy clothes.My appearance as a Demon.And.Magic scrolls scattered around the floor.There was still one straw I could grab onto.* * *I didn\u2019t know if this would work, but that was the only thing left I could do now.There might be other methods, but to survive, I had to gamble with my life anyway.In this situation in which I was completely surrounded and didn\u2019t know the location of the secret passage, I had only one goal. To survive.Where I arrived was.\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dThe [Prison]As I descended to this dark, moldy smelling place, I threw away all my clothes and went in naked.It would have been nice to just have a few extra scrolls with me, but I had to gamble and throw everything away.If I had something with me, that would have been too suspicious.The magic spell I wanted to use was a low-level one.However, in my situation it was the most fitting spell. One, my plan wouldn\u2019t work without.[Casting Camouflage Magic.]I changed my appearance.I disguised myself as a human prisoner caught by the Demons.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3The huge confinement facility was in the form of a prison. I couldn\u2019t help but be speechless at the disgusting stench and horrifying sight in front of me.If what I\u2019d seen up until now were the corpses of demons that got attacked by the heroes that infiltrated the castle, then what was found here were\u2026.All corpses of humans.\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201dThere were no guards, but it looked like they had just killed all the prisoners before they went to the battlefield. I felt vomit coming up, but I held it in.Most of them were horribly torn to shreds. They were disastrous corpses. I couldn\u2019t even tell what they were subjected to.I didn\u2019t have any time to hesitate, but my hands and feet just couldn\u2019t stop trembling.There was, of course, a difference between writing something and seeing something in person. The unrecognizable, torn corpses were very hard to look at.There was a mixture of blood and feces everywhere.Someone died right outside an open cell door, perhaps they tried to escape.It looked so bad that I didn\u2019t even want to look at it.I was on the verge of cussing myself out.This was what I was looking for.\u201cGod fucking damn it\u2026. damn it.\u2026.\u201dWere the sins I committed in my previous life so great?To the point that I had to strip off the clothes of corpses whose shapes were unrecognizable just to survive?I put down my fancy clothes to pick up rags and wear them. I stripped the rags from a corpse that should be called pieces of flesh rather than a corpse. I couldn\u2019t afford any unnecessary pride so I took off my underwear as well and rolled around on the dirty floor with the rags on.The feeling of having sticky blood on my face was terrible.I had no opportunity to look in a mirror, but I must have looked terrible. In the end, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and kneeled over.\u201cHuueewek!\u201dI gagged, but nothing came out. I could hear shouts coming from outside that seemed like distant echoes.With this my preparations were completed.I could either go into a prison cell in a corner and lock myself in or I could pretend that I managed to escape.From now on, all I could do was pray that no one could look through my camouflage magic.By the way, who the hell was I supposed to pray to?Shit.I wandered around the prison cell in a miserable mood. The prison cell, which was previously filled with so many people to the point of bursting, now housed nothing but corpses.Did they have to kill them all?Is that what demons are like?And.-Sob. Sob, sob\u2026.I could hear someone crying somewhere.There were survivors.I didn\u2019t know who, but someone was still alive here. I instinctively moved towards that place. Fear rose, but I couldn\u2019t help, but go look. My body moved faster than I thought.Before anything else, I thought I should help whoever was alive in this horrifying place. These sentiments also gave me a sense of relief as it was proof that I was still a normal person.\u201cWh, who\u2026.. Is anyone there\u2026?\u201d\u2013 Urg\u2026. Sob. sob\u2026\u2026.It was a very quiet, powerless, fragmented cry, like the cry of a small animal.I passed by a few gruesome sights showcased in the prison cells.\u201cSob\u2026. uuh\u2026. hnng\u2026.\u201dSoon, I could see a little girl crying in a cracked voice, hugging something shaped like a human.I could roughly guess what kind of situation this was.There was also a mass of bodies and flesh scattered about.I hated to assume this, but judging by the remains, there seemed to have been five of them there. The crying girl not included. She was crying while hugging a corpse with an uncertain form, as if she didn\u2019t even realize I was in front of her.I couldn\u2019t even tell how that corpse died or how this child survived.However, the only thing I could tell was that this corpse the girl was holding was probably someone precious to her.\u201cHey, calm down\u2026.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Urg, sob! Don\u2019t!\u201dOnly after I knocked against the cage did the girl lift her head and look at me.Although she was covered in blood, I could tell that she had blonde hair and golden eyes. She was very skinny.The girl looked at me, got startled and pulled back.\u201cH, huh! Wh, wh\u2026\u2026 Who. Who, how\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, do, don\u2019t worry! I\u2026 I was stuck here too!\u201dThe girl was mumbling gibberish as if she lost all her reason.\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll get you out. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201dThe girl\u2019s eyes were filled with fear and sadness. She seemed to think of something as she looked at me, a person in rags like her.The girl looked at my eyes, arms and legs.She was looking at me who was terrified by these harrowing sights I was never exposed to before. Then the girl nodded slowly and softly.She was shaking, but it felt like she had chosen to believe me. As if she had no other choice but to trust me, when she suddenly encountered me in this incomprehensible environment.Did she believe I was in the same situation as her, because I was affected by these sights? This was only possible because I wasn\u2019t a Demon Prince at my core.\u201cHey, do you know where the keys are? I\u2019ll bring them over.\u201d\u201cM, maybe\u2026\u2026 The, there\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout a word the girl pointed to the other end of the prison.It\u2019s true that I felt compelled to save this child.However, it was also true that I had these calculating thoughts that my chances of survival would increase if other survivors could testify that I was also imprisoned here.* * *I didn\u2019t know which one the right key was, so I brought all the key rings I could find in the warden\u2019s office at the end of the prison cells. While I was trying every key, the girl kept on crying.She was just crying. As if she lost all hope.\u201cCan you hear the sounds outside?\u201d\u201c Yes\u2026.\u201dThe shouts of the humans could be heard. I couldn\u2019t go into detail, but I somehow wanted to tell her that everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201dInevitably, this war had already been won by the humans. At my fearful yet confident words, the girl continued to weep and nodded her head. Finding the right key took a lot of time. I wondered if it was really necessary to open the door, but I wanted to get her out of that miserable place for now.\u201cIt might be dangerous to go out, but\u2026. Let\u2019s open it up for now. Even if you don\u2019t want to go out of there\u201d\u201cYe, yes\u2026\u2026 \u201dThe girl\u2019s voice was shaking violently. Rather, it seemed that she lost control of her emotions after meeting another living human like her.Still, I, as the older of us two, should put her mind at ease.\u201cCalm down\u2026. We\u2019ll live. You\u2019ll be able to live.\u201dThat\u2019s also what I wanted to say to myself.You have to get out of this goddamn place and survive.I had to. I mumbled \u201cLet\u2019s calm down, let\u2019s calm down, we can live\u201d to myself as if I was trying to hypnotise myself.Just looking at her I could tell that she was seriously skinny. I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how hungry she must be.Ah.Come to think of that.\u201cWait, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cH, huh? Huh?\u201dI ran somewhere instead of continuing to try to open the door with one of the keys. The child seemed to be calling me, but I ran like the wind and rummaged through the clothes I had taken off.Then I came back with the stuff I pulled out from there.\u201cSee. I found this in the place the keys were.\u201dI didn\u2019t have to tell her the truth, so I told her a little lie and handed her a biscuit. It was a biscuit I had unnecessarily in my pocket. I just remembered that I threw it away together with my clothes.\u201cYou must be hungry, so eat this.\u201dThe girl suddenly saw a palm-sized biscuit in her hand, which made her open her eyes wide. Yeah, things are sad and depressing, but you should also feel hellishly hungry. The girl was staring blankly at me who gave her the whole biscuit.\u201cY, y\u2026\u2026 You?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. You eat first.\u201dI started fumbling with the keys again. The girl was silently staring, as if she was trying to decide if it was fine for her to eat it or not. Time passed, then-Crunch!Along with that sound, something got pushed against my mouth, while I was still preoccupied with finding the right key.\u201cY, you, too\u2026\u2026 You eat, too.\u201dThe girl wept and offered me half of the biscuit. How much determination did it take her to cut it and give me half of it?I felt emotional for some reason.Are we like this just to atone for some kind of sin we committed? Didn\u2019t I atone enough by dying after reading some malicious comments already?My eyes turned cold, as I started to feel indignant for no apparent reason.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe girl started to cry again after she bit into the biscuit. I didn\u2019t know whether she cried because it was delicious or because she was sad. What does food taste like after having endured such terrible hunger?I didn\u2019t know, but I thought I knew to some extent why she cried.-Clack!As soon as I took a bite out of the biscuit, the iron door opened.* * *The cage was open, but the girl didn\u2019t come out. Perhaps she didn\u2019t want to leave that body she was holding behind. I was about to carry it out as well, however, I knew that it wasn\u2019t such a good idea to go outside. It might still be dangerous.It was for the best to wait here.So rather than opening the prison cell to let someone out I did this bizarre thing of walking into it.\u201cCan \u2026\u2026. the Demon King be killed\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI think he\u2019s already dead.I wasn\u2019t fazed by the death of my unknown biological father. The girl quivered and murmured things while shedding tears, her head buried in her knees.\u201cArtorius said he\u2019d come rescue us\u2026\u2026.\u201dUnfortunately, the Demon King probably dragged Artorius down with him. He wouldn\u2019t be able to save us, but the human side will most probably come here.\u201cYeah. Someone\u2019s coming to save us.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just a speculation, it was the truth. However, whether the army will come to save me or not was the most important thing. I mean, I wasn\u2019t the Demon King after all.\u201cI can\u2019t hear them anymore.\u201dThe girl trembled. The overflowing roars suddenly came to a halt. Thinking that the human army was defeated, the girl grew more and more afraid.I reached out and hugged her by the shoulders.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThe girl seemed surprised that I said that.\u201cYou\u2026. You are so calm\u2026.\u201dThese words seemed kind of eerie and made me stiffen a little\u201cOh, no. I, I\u2019m\u2026\u2026 Also very scared.\u201dI think it was because I was next to a child, so I exaggerated a little, but it\u2019s true that I was scared as all hell. You\u2019d be fine, but I might get my head cut off soon.Still, the girl didn\u2019t seem suspicious of my calmness.\u201cWhat\u2019s your\u2026. Name?\u201dThe girl asked for my name.My name was Valier Jr. here. Since the Demon King Valier was dead, my name must be Valier now. I couldn\u2019t tell her that name. That would be like I was asking to get myself killed. To begin with, even a normal human would get stoned if they named themselves after the Demon King.\u201cThat, see\u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t remember\u2026.\u201dIn the end, I gave her the first excuse that came to my mind.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember anything. Who I am, why I\u2019m here\u2026\u2026 Everything.\u201dThat was the most convenient excuse I could come up with.Amnesia.I decided on going with the setting of having lost my memory after these endless days of merciless torture.I can\u2019t believe the day would come when I had to use this dog-like concept.\u201cSob\u2026\u2026. What should we do\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl hugged me as if she felt sorry for me.I felt a little guilty because she believed it so quickly. The girl held me in her slender arms, but she gave me a bit of strength as well.\u201cI, if I could get out of here\u2026\u2026 If I get out\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely get your memories back\u2026\u2026 I promise.\u201dHmm?How though?-Clack, clackBefore I could finish thinking, I heard someone running from a distance. It wasn\u2019t the only thing I could hear.-This seems to be the prison!-They\u2019re all dead!Those were definitely human voices. People who I couldn\u2019t tell if they were knights or soldiers rushed to check the prison cells and finally met our eyes.\u201cHoly, survivors! We have survivors!\u201dThe emotional exclamation from the one who found us rang through the prison.Tears welled up in the girl\u2019s eyes, and my heart started racing like crazy in a weird mix of fear, excitement and relief.Then a middle-aged knight followed the shouts and finally stepped before us. As soon as he saw the girl, his face horribly contorted.\u201cOh, oooh\u2026\u2026 Oh, woe, Her Majesty the Princess\u2026.\u201dNo\u2026..No, what?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: 4The girl I spoke with was none other than Charlotte de Gardias, the first princess of the Gardias Empire, the largest Empire on the continent.Let\u2019s say this was like these common situations.Let\u2019s say I was really a prisoner in the Demon King\u2019s Castle and I really suffered from amnesia.I then proceeded to try to get a crying girl out of her cell without knowing what happened, comforted her and even got her something to eat because I pitied her for starving like that. However, she turned out to actually be the imperial princess who was captured by the demon king army!Then let\u2019s say I was to be rescued together with the princess.So let\u2019s just say that the princess was to tell them to treat me with their utmost respect.The best expression that would fit this was \u201cwhat a cliche\u201d.However.I was a demon who changed his appearance with low-level camouflage magic.What, wasn\u2019t I kind of screwed if things developed like that?I was led out of the Demon King\u2019s Castle like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse, and arrived at a place close to the barracks of the commander-in-chief of the Demon Conquest Army garrison far away from the battlefield.Countless wizards and priests got close to the princess and immediately jumped into action. They also took some measures on me.To my relief, I didn\u2019t have any undead attributes so the healing magic the priests cast on me didn\u2019t cause damage or something. It sure was fortunate that I didn\u2019t have a constitution that rejected sacred power.Of course, I already knew that that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. If it were, I wouldn\u2019t even have tried to get rescued by the human\u2019s side.Not long after I became a dirty bastard, a lot of people clung to me to wash, wipe and clean me. It was a hot day, but the fear that I might die if I made a mistake made me overcome everything.If a wizard cast a spell to, for example, dispel curses on me, everything would be over. Fortunately, a large number of troops were put into searching the Demon King\u2019s Castle, and it seemed difficult for them to just take care of the Princess as there were a lot of bleeding and injured people among the wizard forces.However, the question was, was Charlotte naturally good-natured or did she somehow take a liking to me?\u201cPlease look after this person. He\u2019s my benefactor after all.\u201dIn the end, the problem was that she cared too much about me.Despite her own lack of energy, she was constantly instructing them to take care of me first. I bowed to the girl I put my arm around not too long ago.\u201cN, no. It\u2019s alright, Your Highness. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m really healthy. Yes.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t even do anything special.\u201cYou said you lost your memory. You must have had a severe curse put on you.\u201d\u201cN, no, that\u2019s not it! I don\u2019t need to remember. Yeah, it\u2019s not such a big deal. Yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201dNo, I know you\u2019re a nice girl, but won\u2019t you leave me some space?You\u2019re giving me much too much for just one biscuit.Eventually, I was allowed to lie in the private room next to the barracks after persuading the nursing staff who couldn\u2019t even catch a break taking care of me and the princess. They were close to collapsing.First of all.I felt like I just escaped a collapsing cave only to jump into the mouth of a tiger.[Event complete \u2013 Downfall][You have earned 100 achievement points.]I somehow broke through the first hurdle..* * *The princess\u2019 consideration for me was persistent.After some essential first aid was over, the princess summoned me back to the barracks.There was a huge amount of food set on a table.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have eaten well. Go ahead and eat.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026. Yes.\u201dHowever, I couldn\u2019t easily touch it. There were too many eyes looking at me right now. The princess stared at me and nodded as if she understood what was going on.She seemed to think that I was someone that couldn\u2019t get even a single corn of rice down my throat if so many people were looking at me.The princess looked at the surrounding guards, wizards and priests.\u201cGo out and wait.\u201d\u201cBu, but Your Highness\u2026.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the Demon King is dead and this place became safe?\u201dAt the princess\u2019 gentle command, everyone left the barracks, leaving only me and the princess behind. She looked at me quietly.\u201cLet\u2019s eat quickly.\u201d\u201cYes, huh? Ah, yes. Yes.\u201dThe princess grabbed the roasted turkey leg with her bare hands and began to bite into it.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like she kicked them out because she wanted to eat comfortably.\u201cE, erm\u2026\u2026 Uh. Wo, won\u2019t we get sick\u2026\u2026?\u201dIf one starved for such a long time and ate something like this, wouldn\u2019t it cause problems in the stomach that may lead to one\u2019s death?Do you trust the priests outside so much?\u201cYou, too. Quickly eat.\u201dThere was no point telling her that.* * *The meal was quite large, so I had time to sort out my thoughts while the princess munched away.In the Prologue, the Demon King Valier died, but there was a situation that happened before that.An all-out war between the humans and the Demon Realm called the Demon World, the Demon World War.Naturally, since there was a war going on, the hero destroyed the Demon King. Although they ended up destroying each other.Although the reason behind the war wasn\u2019t known, it was started under the Demons\u2019 name. Demon King Valier had incredibly powerful forces and tried to make the Human Coalition surrender.Valier used his spies hidden in various parts of the Human Forces to kidnap key figures of the Coalition. He kidnapped politicians, kings, powerful warriors and wizards themselves or their families to prevent them from participating in the war.And the most important hostage was the First Princess of the Gardias Empire and her mother.Valier succeeded in kidnapping the Empress and the Princess. If the Emperor pulled out of the war, it was clear that the other forces would follow one after the other.However, the Emperor knew that giving up on the Demon World War would be a great mistake. If the Empire pulled out, it would\u2019ve been destroyed.In the end, he had no choice but to give up on the hostages and launch an all-out war. All the hostages were killed, but after many twists and turns, the princess survived.Was it something like that.\u2026?No. I don\u2019t think so.Let\u2019s think about it.It\u2019s definitely a novel I wrote, but honestly, I couldn\u2019t remember each and every sentence. The prologue was relatively less memorable. I wrote that part the longest ago after all.The princess, who ate in front of me with a cute face, wasn\u2019t the main character of my novel, which was a school drama.To be honest, I didn\u2019t even know that her name was Charlotte de Gardias. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t remember it, I didn\u2019t know it in the first place. It wasn\u2019t like not remembering the name of someone passing by, but later when seeing the name of said person written down going \u201cOh, right there was someone like that.\u201d.I couldn\u2019t remember the princess\u2019 name at all.Let\u2019s think about this some more.What I wrote had become reality.As a result, all the parts that I hadn\u2019t imagined got filled in.This was the world I knew and at the same time, it was a world filled with things I didn\u2019t recognize at all.The soldiers guarding the door outside each had their own pasts, but I didn\u2019t know them. Even though this is the world I thought up, it was natural that things were like this. This was like virtual settings suddenly becoming reality after all.Therefore, there would always be events in this world happening even though I hadn\u2019t described them and there should also be events that already happened. There were things in the past, present and future I had no clue about.However, the sentences I wrote would definitely come true.The Emperor gave up on the hostages and launched an all-out war. The subjugation of the Demon Realm was successful and if the Emperor pulled out of the war because of the hostages he would have received a lot of backlash by the other participants and the possibility of the Empire falling because of that wasn\u2019t small.This was true.And I never wrote anything about the first princess, which must be quite important for the main narrative. Of course, this was supposed to be just a normal slice-of-life school thing, however the imperial family\u2019s history got mentioned slightly as well.However, the first princess was right in front of me and yet I have never written anything about this girl. Although this might be misguided inference, what if there was a character with the role of princess abducted by the Demon King? Wouldn\u2019t I\u2019ve forced her into the narrative and made her more important?An important character that was sure to appear on the main stage, to deviate from the main narrative isn\u2019t something that should occur.Although the princess should occupy an important role later in the story, she doesn\u2019t even appear in the future.She was the first princess who survived the Demon World War, you know?However, why doesn\u2019t this character appear and why do I as the writer have no clue about her?I had no choice but to regard my own novel as some kind of prophecy. I had to do this strange thing where I had to interpret my own writing.The writer was usually ignorant of the vestiges of the story, however now I was experiencing said vestiges. They would now be and will be filled with things and I have no idea, with what.I had to locate the blanks of the story that were filled as this world became reality and connect them to the future I knew.I had to deduce how this bivalent narrative affected the future I knew. The princess was rescued like this right now, but she didn\u2019t appear in the future in the imperial family\u2019s story at all.I had to figure out the answer using two facts.There were two possible answers.First.My existence somehow made the princess who was supposed to die immediately live.It didn\u2019t seem strange that the princess who was crying all alone could maybe take her own life. Also, she was extremely malnourished. However, could that just be solved with a single biscuit? Anyway, there was a possibility that my existence saved the princess. It was very low, but it was there.Second.This possible answer relied on the assumption that there may have been a huge event happening in my novel of which I wasn\u2019t aware of.For instance, the big events I wrote would still flow as intended. There may be other reasons behind that.So, let\u2019s say event A happened. I did write a description for it, but behind the scenes, there might have been a completely different factor that caused event A to happen.Let\u2019s say I wrote, it just happened out of nowhere. What should I do in that case? Let\u2019s say the reasoning was written irresponsibly like that.However, it wouldn\u2019t be too absurd for there to be a backstory, a reason for this to happen the moment this world became reality. In other words, there might have been some kind of probability correction.That was what happened when I tried to use the teleportation scroll a while ago.So I\u2019d know what incidents were going to happen in this world, but not why. This was a very strange situation. This all happened because I wrote this story so irresponsibly and rough without explaining things properly.Was this my punishment for being imprecise?So, unless I was the reason for the princess\u2019 survival, there was only one more answer.She would be killed or would die soon.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201dThe cute little princess asked me calmly.* * *Even in slice-of-life stories, villains were needed. There may be slice-of-life stories without villains, but these were in the realm of masterpieces. The presence of a villain simplified the narrative process. If one just wrote a bad guy did it, one can explain away a lot of things.Why did he do that? If someone asked something like this, one could just explain it with \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bad guy lol\u201d.So, I wasn\u2019t skilled enough to write a slice-of-life story without a villain.[The Demon King is Dead]\u2019s main villain was Imperial Prince Bertus de Gardias.There were some minor villains, but the prince was a little different. If one would call the villains found at the Academy kind of sloppy and second-rated, the prince would be the real deal. He was the type to conspire to kill people. I gave him the setting that he\u2019d do anything to become the next emperor.From Bertus\u2019 perspective, the existence of the first princess who returned alive after getting abducted by the demons would only be a thorn in his side. Just because she had gone through such hardship, the princess would be in a position that garnered a lot of attention, and seeing as to how she was the First Princess their succession rights to the throne would be similar.Bertus would be embarrassed to know that the first princess was alive and not dead. He would have, of course, thought that she died, but she came back alive.If that were the case, then there was a good chance that Charlotte would soon be killed by Bertus or one of his people.Charlotte would die behind the scenes at the vestiges of the main story. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to join the main story.Charlotte would probably die soon. The possibility that she won\u2019t even make it to the Empire isn\u2019t that low either.Charlotte would be in danger soon. I don\u2019t know how though. While I was thinking about that, the princess was letting out a sigh as she was finally full.Would I be able to save this girl?My life was like a fallen leaf in the wind, so was I even in any position to care about someone else\u2019s life?Wouldn\u2019t it be better for me if Charlotte just died here and the wizards turned their gazes away from me?Just when that thought went through my mind, a sense of horror ran down my spine.I was an ordinary person. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary situation, but I was still just an ordinary person. Just the thought of planning to survive using such a young child\u2019s death already made me feel disgusted with myself.Charlotte was the closest to an ally I had and she was in a situation in which she wouldn\u2019t know when her head might get cut off. Having Charlotte on my side would make her a great force to have though, no matter what unexpected situation might happen in the future.Let\u2019s think like that.The only time we were able to talk was now. After the meal was over, the guards would come back in again. Then we couldn\u2019t talk about any important things.How the hell was I supposed to convey to her that her life was in danger? How was I supposed to explain why I knew that?Charlotte wiped the grease from the corner of her mouth as she looked at me.The look in Charlotte\u2019s eyes, which had been innocent and pure until now, seemed to have suddenly turned cold.Just when I thought that the atmosphere around her suddenly changed, Charlotte talked in a low voice.\u201cNow, listen carefully.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s demeanor was more serious than before.\u201cOur lives are in danger.\u201dCharlotte brought up what I had wanted to say before me.And she told me it\u2019s us who\u2019s in danger, not just her. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s you.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5I had no other choice but to give an evasive answer to Charlotte\u2019s words, that relieved me somewhat.\u201cHu,huh?\u201dThe princess was already aware that her life was in danger.Rather, the way she stared at me so calmly confirmed to me that my guesses were correct. she was looking at me with such serious eyes, as if she was never so preoccupied with the food.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to go into detail, but my half-brother, Bertus, was probably blindly waiting for me to die. For him, knowing that I was still alive, would be like a thorn in his side.\u201dThe girl that was sitting in a prison cell holding her mother\u2019s body and crying was completely gone. Charlotte, who returned to her seat, was calm, as if she realized again that she was a member of the imperial family.However, Bertus actually had a lot of followers. He was a villain, but he sure wasn\u2019t incompetent.\u201cHowever, I don\u2019t know how he plans to kill me. I don\u2019t know who will do it, I just know it will happen soon.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know how she was going to be attacked and Charlotte didn\u2019t know who to trust in this chaotic situation just after the end of a war. Due to most forces searching the Demon King\u2019s Castle and cleaning up the stragglers, almost all the main forces were missing.\u201cAnd the people I turst aren\u2019t here. I think it was intentional.\u201dWhen Charlotte was rescued, she realized that none of her own were around. Then something flashed through my mind like lightning.\u201cHoh, so that\u2019s why you told the people to leave\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, yes.\u201dIn the first place, she kicked everyone out except me because she couldn\u2019t be sure if any of them would end up being her killer except me.Rather, Charlotte was a lot more cautious than I was.She didn\u2019t know who to trust, or when she\u2019d be killed. How could one know if they hadn\u2019t poisoned the food?\u201cHey, the food might gotten poisoned\u2026.\u201dAt my words, the princess laughed.\u201cIf they poisoned the food, I\u2019d just eat it and die then, in this situation.\u201dShe was so hungry she didn\u2019t care anymore.I couldn\u2019t imagine just how hungry the princess was, but it seemed like she was so starved that she\u2019d rather die than not eat the food in front of her. She was so hungry that she\u2019d even eat poisoned food. Fortunately, there wasn\u2019t any poison in it.\u201cMost people stationed in these barracks will be enemies.\u201d\u201cIs\u2026\u2026 that so?\u201dCharlotte was convinced that not just a few but most of them were her enemies.\u201cI tried to leave the barracks a few times before, but they didn\u2019t let me, with the excuse that I should relax. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re trying to lock me up.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s voice was getting lower and lower.\u201cIt\u2019s not known yet that I was rescued. They didn\u2019t want to announce this either.\u201dIs that so?Even when she got rescued, she came out wrapped in something like a thick coat. Charlotte was convinced that there weren\u2019t other survivors inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201cThey\u2019re probably waiting for instructions on how to deal with me. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t want it to be known that I\u2019m alive. After killing me, there\u2019s a high possibility that they\u2019ll just say I died in the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201dThey would make it out that she died in the Demon King\u2019s Castle, but would keep quiet about her getting rescued, so there they could say that they retrieved the corpse from inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle. Charlotte was looking at a number of possibilities.From the outside it seemed like they cared for the First Princess, however, in reality, it was more like hundreds of people holding Charlotte in custody. Just the thought gave me goosebumps all over my body.It didn\u2019t look like that at all. At least to me.However, Charlotte already knew their intentions.\u201cSo I, who was rescued with you, am also in danger.\u201dObviously, Charlotte said \u2018our\u2019 life is in danger and not \u2018my\u2019 life is in danger after all.This wasn\u2019t just a matter of them finding out if I\u2019m a demon or not anymore.Bertus\u2019 followers would remove anyone who knew the first princess was alive, and I wasn\u2019t going to be an exception.In the end, I was in a position in which I had no other choice but to try my hardest to keep Charlotte safe.\u201cListen. We\u2019ll leave the barracks now.\u201dShe was in even greater danger after getting rescued, so she was planning to escape from this non-surveillance.\u201cAre we even able to run away?\u201dBut with so many soldiers patrolling the grounds, was it even possible to escape properly?\u201cOf course we can\u2019t run away, but that\u2019s not the point.\u201dCharlotte laughed.\u201cI want as many people as possible to know that I\u2019m alive.\u201dHer purpose wasn\u2019t to run away, but to inform the ordinary soldiers of her survival.No.But.I was older.So why did she seem so much smarter than me?Charlotte rose from her seat, while I felt a strange sense of defeat.The meal was over.* * *No one even imagined that Charlotte de Gardias could still be alive, so there wasn\u2019t much surveillance in the barracks Charlotte and I were in. They were now waiting for instructions from above and didn\u2019t seem to think that we\u2019d be able to get away.Even if I called it barracks, it was really just a tent.Escaping from it was simple.I slightly cut the tent in the back with a knife provided for the meal and checked their movements outside.After cutting a hole in the tent, we crawled outside. We came out from the back and not its entrance so there were only a few troops walking around. It was quiet, which was understandable, as most of them were gathered in the Demon King\u2019s Castle and not the garrison.No one seemed to have expected that the princess would feel her life in danger and escaped as soon as she was rescued.Yeah, that was normal. I was surprised by her behavior as well.However, we couldn\u2019t walk around for long. They\u2019d soon find out we were gone. Charlotte knew that as well.\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be caught soon.\u201dOne might wonder why she came out when she knew that she\u2019d be caught soon, however, Charlotte\u2019s purpose was to reveal her own survival to everyone so it didn\u2019t matter.Just rumors about it alone would prolong Charlotte\u2019s life a little longer. Like this, the fact that she was still alive would spread among the ordinary soldiers, preventing her death from being made out as something that happened in the Demon King\u2019s Castle.This could keep her alive for a bit until she found an alternative method.That was Charlotte\u2019s purpose.\u201cYou go ahead.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s eyes lit up a little as she looked at me.\u201cYou have to come back as soon as possible.\u201dAt that moment, I was able to catch a glimpse of Charlotte\u2019s fear of having to face death again.Yes.You must live, no matter what.I left Charlotte behind and started running through the grounds.-H, her, her Majesty the Princess?-Her Majesty the Princess is alive!Soon after, the cries of the remaining troops could be heard echoing through the camp.Charlotte would be taken back to the HQ barracks, but that would leave me with greater freedom of movement.\u2018If they find out that you\u2019re gone, they\u2019ll naturally try to find you as well. Run as far as possible. They won\u2019t try to kill you right away, but they will definitely kill you.\u2019\u2018Find Sir Francis and make sure to come back together with him.\u2019\u2018I need you to find him and make him my escort.\u2019Just before we left the tent, Charlotte told me as such.Sir Francis.She said she didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be her enemies and who\u2019d be her allies.However, she said that there was only one person who could never be her enemy.The knight who rescued us, Francis.If he had been Bertus\u2019 minion he would\u2019ve killed us right on the spot, but saved us himself. That was why he couldn\u2019t be one of Bertus\u2019 servants.From the moment she got rescued, Charlotte already had a hunch that she was about to face another crisis before she was even able to be happy about having gotten saved.Originally, Charlotte would eventually get killed even though she was aware of the danger to her life. Charlotte couldn\u2019t do anything on her own to survive even with her wits. Which meant\u2026My success or failure determined Charlotte\u2019s life or death.Charlotte couldn\u2019t find Francis on her own. Perhaps she gave orders to bring him to her, but those orders wouldn\u2019t have been carried out.In the end, I had to find him myself and bring him to Charlotte\u2019s side.The soldiers coming and going from the vast barracks only titled their heads when they saw me running around, but none came directly towards me. While Charlotte\u2019s face was well known, mine was not, hence, making this possible.I approached one of the passing soldiers who looked like an officer and asked him.\u201cDo, do you know where Sir Francis is?\u201dHe looked down at me and nodded.\u201cWell? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI have an urgent message from the Commander-in-chief.\u201dIf I mentioned the princess here, it might take me some time to explain, so I had no choice but to cover this up with lies. He scanned my body and clothes from top to bottom. Fortunately, I changed into luxurious clothes, so I wasn\u2019t just dismissed.If I had worn the rags, he would have told me to get lost.\u201cI don\u2019t know Sir Francis very well, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s searching through the castle. I heard that most of the knights were sent there.\u201dDamn it.After rescuing us, it seemed like he had focused on his original mission, searching the castle, again.No.No, wait a second.Bertus\u2019 minions would kill anyone who knew that Charlotte was alive.It\u2019s clear that Francis\u2019 life would also be in jeopardy. He wasn\u2019t loyal to Bertus, so he wouldn\u2019t keep his silence. Bertus, however, would want to eliminate anyone who knew of Charlotte\u2019s survival.I wasn\u2019t the only one whose life depended on Charlotte\u2019s survival.\u201cWe must go find Sir Francis! His life is in danger!\u201d\u201cWha, what?!\u201dI had no choice but to urgently shout to this unknown officer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Perhaps because of the credibility that came with these clothes I wore or my urgent look, the unknown officer immediately put me on a horse without saying anything.Initially, this was a garrison, so it was far from the Demon King\u2019s Castle.How did it come to this? I had worked so hard to get out of there not too long ago and now I was already rushing back to the castle.I\u2019ve never sat on a horse before, however the officer sitting behind me held my body tightly, so I was able to endure the shaking somehow.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me the details? The castle has already been captured, so why is a knight\u2019s life in danger!?\u201dI didn\u2019t know if this person was one of Bertus\u2019 minions or not, but this guy was pretty young.Did Bertus reach out his grubby fingers even down to the level of junior officers?I thought about that for a little while, but this guy was helping me for now.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we find Sir Francis!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dI didn\u2019t need to persuade him any more, as he was still helping me right now. Maybe because this was my first time riding on a horse, my hip felt like it was about to break, but this wasn\u2019t the time to care about something like that.The Demon King\u2019s Castle was a mess as a result of this war and on the surrounding plains, demons who seemed to have been taken captive were being dragged along looking like\u00a0dried corvinas.Not all of them were dead. Some of the Demons surrendered and became prisoners.I felt relieved that not all of them died, however, at the same time I felt guilty for betraying them in the end despite being their prince.\u201cWhat will happen to those Demons?\u201dDespite the urgency of the situation, I posed such a random question.\u201cIf it were a war between humans, we\u2019d take a ransom for them, but they\u2019re demons.\u201dHe talked as if I asked something strange.\u201cWe\u2019ve taken them prisoner for now, but what else would we do other than kill them?\u201dNegotiations were meaningless as their races were different. This was inevitable, because this was originally a war of annihilation. It was only natural that they were trying to destroy all seeds before they grow.It made my heart heavy. Even though I was an ordinary man who just suddenly entered the body of the demon prince, I couldn\u2019t easily shake off this dirty feeling.The officer and I dashed past the endless procession of prisoners.* * *The wide, open walls were destroyed everywhere and filled with numerous bodies. It felt terrible just seeing the sight of demon and human corpses being lined up next to each other.\u201cIt\u2019s not something a kid should see.\u201dHe showed my kindness by covering my eyes while he rode the horse as he considered me as a child.I couldn\u2019t tell just how many humans and demons had died. We passed through the destroyed gates. Numerous carriages were lined up before it.They continued to load them with materials they found in the Demon King\u2019s Castle.The Demon Realm was destroyed in this Demon World War, and this long-standing conflict was finally resolved by the humans..But the most important was still the material aspect.All countries that participated in the Demon World War would gain enormous wealth from selling the goods of the Demon Realm. So it was set up that a long golden age would start for the land of humans. It\u2019s said that they gained a long peaceful period in exchange for all the blood.However, I would have never imagined I\u2019d get to see this scene from the perspective of the demons. In the end, as if they were treating war as just a simple reason to plunder, numerous military forces swept up all of the Demon King\u2019s Castle\u2019s wealth.Wagons filled to the brim with supplies continued to leave the area and empty wagons kept replacing them. The officer took me to the command post inside the castle where they conducted the transport and search operation.The officer gave a salute to what appeared to be the commander.\u201cLieutenant Dyrus, commander of the 3rd Platoon, 11th Company, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Imperial Corps!\u201dHe shouted his official name with a stiff face. Lieutenant Dyrus. I somehow found out his name. He was in the cavalry, so that\u2019s why he could ride so well even with me being there.The commander opposite of him didn\u2019t seem to have any idea who he was. That\u2019s to be expected. Going by his title he was probably way below the commander.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe officer, who seemed to be a very high-ranking officer, frowned while he looked alternately between me and the junior officer. He seemed like he would severely reprimand him if he couldn\u2019t give a proper explanation why he brought someone who wasn\u2019t even a soldier to this place.\u201cI brought this boy here because he said he had to deliver an urgent message from the Commander-in-chief to Sir Francis. I presumed it to be confidential, so I didn\u2019t ask him what it was.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dSeeing my small lie growing bigger, I felt a chill run down my spine. However, he didn\u2019t ask him why the commander had sent an urgent message through someone like me.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dHis face slightly stiffened. He seemed to know something.\u201cSir Francis\u2026. I just received a report that he was killed in an altercation with one of the demon remnants during the search of the Castle..\u201dBertus was the first to use his hand. Not only my, but also Lieutenant Daryus\u2019 expression hardened.\u201cIs the message something I should know about?\u201d\u201cN, no! I was meant to deliver it to Sir Francis directly!\u201d\u201cWhat a pity. Those damn demons should just curl up and die.\u201dThe commander\u2019s expression was grim, perhaps because he thought that he lost a great knight to the demons.No, well, he was definitely killed by humans and not demons though.\u201cSir, this is not a place for a boy such as him. Hurry back.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dFortunately, the commander didn\u2019t interrogate me about the message or my identity. It seemed like he was too preoccupied with conducting this full-scale search of the castle.After leaving the command post, Lieutenant Dyrus grabbed my shoulder.\u201cHow did this happen? How did the Commander-in-chief know that Sir Francis was in danger?\u201dI said Sir Francis\u2019 life was in danger, and he actually died. I looked at the lieutenant in front of me. It was clear that he had very little authority here.However, now that Sir Francis got already killed, I needed someone else to help me.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Commander-in-chief.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHoping that it wasn\u2019t a mistake to bring this person in.\u201cHer Highness sent me.\u201dI told him the truth.* * *I explained the whole story to him in a secluded area of the castle where soldiers didn\u2019t pass by. I started from the point where the princess was still imprisoned and got rescued.\u201cSo Sir Francis was killed by someone from our army and not the demons?\u201d\u201cYes, maybe\u2026.\u201d\u201cShit. I can\u2019t even imagine how painful it must have been, but they were even trying to harm Her Highness the Princess as soon as she got rescued?\u201dHe clenched his teeth, seeming shocked to hear that there were people who planned such things.\u201cThen you\u2019re trying to rescue the Princess, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAlright, I admire your courage.\u201dHe patted me on the shoulder as if he was proud of me, who tried to save the princess even though I was powerless. Then he seemed amazed by the fact that there were hidden battles going on on their side, just as they claimed victory.\u201cI can\u2019t let that happen. I also want to become the Princess\u2019 power.\u201dEven in this place with so many eyes, somehow an ally got killed by another. That would mean that Bertus\u2019 minions were spread out throughout the whole Imperial Army.\u201cI have to get to her as soon as possible. I\u2019m not as skilled as Sir Francis, but just having one more pair of eyes should be meaningful enough.\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201dFortunately, Dyrus seemed to have a strong sense of justice and couldn\u2019t let this slide. I didn\u2019t tell him anything like he had to risk his life. He seemed to think that it was only natural to give up his life if that meant he could protect her.Just when he was about to leave as fast as he could, I had a thought pass through my head.\u201cLieutenant. Wait.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? I have to go back quickly.\u201dI pointed at the lot of carts.\u201cThere\u2019s a way to protect the princess right now.\u201dYes, I dared to return to the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201cThis is the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201d\u201cRight. What about it?\u201d\u201cI saw that there was a storage room for magic items there when I got rescued.\u201dI\u2019ve come this far, so I couldn\u2019t just go back empty-handed.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we look for a teleport scroll there?\u201dSpaceshifting scrolls couldn\u2019t be used here, but they\u2019d obviously work in the garrison.Using that spell, the princess could be taken out of this dangerous place right away. I hoped that the scroll vault hadn\u2019t been plundered yet.If so, then the teleport scroll I was trying to use was obviously still there.We couldn\u2019t attempt asking a wizard to teleport us. They\u2019d surely trap us.Dyrus seemed hesitant. He looked doubtful whether it was the right choice to go look for some teleport scroll that may or may not exist.However, I knew the location of the teleport scroll. Once I confirmed that it had been stolen, we could leave immediately.\u201cDamn it, alright. It\u2019s clear that I wouldn\u2019t be much help even if I stuck to the princess \u2026.\u201dHe nodded as if he acknowledged the limits of his abilities. I still wasn\u2019t clear on the layout of the Demon King\u2019s Castle, however I had remembered some things when I came out of the prison. There was no one to stop us, as many soldiers were going in and out of the Castle.\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201dSome people seemed puzzled about me walking around unarmed, but I couldn\u2019t explain this to each one of them.Fortunately, I was able to trace my steps back to roughly where it was.The Demon King\u2019s Castle was very spacious and the prison I was in and the magic item storage were located deep inside, so there was a very good chance that it hadn\u2019t been plundered yet.\u201cThis is ridiculously huge!\u201dEventually I got tired and ended up riding his back. I rummaged through my memory and pointed out the directions I remembered. Fortunately, we were able to reach it without getting lost.\u201cIt\u2019s still fine!\u201dFortunately, it was still in good condition. It looked like no one had come here yet.\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t look that fine to me though. I think someone was here already, you know?\u201dOh.That was me.\u201cAh, tha, that\u2026\u2026 I, I meant that the scrolls were still looking fine!\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s look for it.\u201dI immediately picked up the teleport scroll that was spread out on the floor.\u201cI found it!\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cYes, look.\u201dThe name of the magic contained in the scroll was written on it in common language, so he didn\u2019t ask me how I was able to find it right away. If it had been written in the Demon language, he would have suspected me for sure. I already knew two languages I had no previous knowledge of. It was like the staple cheats people get when they get sent to another world.I resealed the scroll that hadn\u2019t been triggered yet. Of course, the teleportation would only work on one person. I didn\u2019t know if there were mass teleportation scrolls, but I had to find more scrolls.Not only Charlotte, I had to get myself out of here as well and maybe Dyrus as well, as he\u2019d also be in danger.\u201cI\u2019ll need a few more. We don\u2019t know what might happen. We should also get some scrolls that might help us as well.\u201d\u201cLittle boy, take this.\u201d\u201cThi, this is\u2026?\u201d\u201cA Scroll Book, is this the first time you\u2019ve seen one? It was over there.\u201dHe handed me an empty book.\u201cN, no, that\u2019s not it. I know what this is.\u201d\u201cGood then. Let\u2019s use it.\u201dI knew what a scroll book was. It wasn\u2019t even a magic item, just a book one could put scrolls into and organize it in a way that one could rip out the pages one needed whenever one wanted.It was an object used by people who weren\u2019t wizards, but still needed to use magic in battle. Since it was an item I came up with, there was no way I wouldn\u2019t know about it. However, it felt really really strange actually holding this item I only imagined in my hands.It was good that I didn\u2019t have to crumble these scrolls into my pocket. I started filling the scroll book with useful magic spells, while Dyrus found another scroll book, filling it with magic as well.\u201cThe Demon King\u2019s Castle sure is amazing. I heard that even low-level scrolls were more expensive than my salary.\u201dHe seemed to genuinely admire the vast stock of scrolls.\u201cI heard they\u2019ve almost used up all the scrolls in this war, but if we\u2019d take all the ones here it would be more than enough to make up for the lower level scrolls we\u2019ve used.\u201dDyrus rummaged through the scrolls while saying things like that.There were no aoe attack spells, but we\u2019ve swept up all the scrolls that might be helpful to us. I couldn\u2019t take them with me earlier because I had to throw everything away, but now I could actually pack them up.Useful Scrolls GET. Go, me.Then I opened my eyes wide at a sudden discovery.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d[Mass Teleportation]Multi-person space movement order.There was no more need to find more teleportation scrolls.\u201cLet\u2019s go Lieutenant!\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201dThen, as soon as we stepped out the door, we couldn\u2019t help but stiffen.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dOur eyes met with a soldier who was carrying some bundles.No, if you think about it, wouldn\u2019t we be seen as people who just arbitrarily took the spoils that should belong to the military? It was, of course, a felony to snatch loot without permission.What if they won\u2019t let us go?Dyrus, I and the soldier were looking at each other in silence.He clenched his teeth. Perhaps he was prepared for this extreme situation.In the face of his new mission to protect the princess, he seemed prepared to do anything. Even if it meant having to subdue his own allies right on the spot.\u201cThat. Lieutenant.\u201dThe soldier cautiously opened his mouth after checking Dyrus rank.\u201cHow about we\u2019ll just turn a blind eye on each other?\u201d\u2026..\u2026 You too?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7I would\u2019ve never imagined that my life would one day be intertwined with a child who wasn\u2019t even a major character of my novel.But I also didn\u2019t expect to see soldiers looting in the Demon World War I described in it. There was no need or reason for me to imagine such things as I wrote the novel.Normally, things like these weren\u2019t woven into the main story in novels such as this, right? This wasn\u2019t related to the main story at all, but this world was on a much larger scale than just the main story, right?While the main character was waiting to enter the Gardias Temple letting his imagination flow, in the prologue section before the main story even started, a princess was about to be assassinated and the Demon Prince was fighting tooth and nail to save her. That was happening right now.This world I described, with all it\u2019s blank spaces filled in, was more realistic than I imagined. That made this whole thing even more scary.Dyrus didn\u2019t stop walking, while he did seem disappointed and angry at being treated the same as those mongrels who acted out of personal greed.While I was rushing to get out of the Demon King\u2019s Castle, Dyrus suddenly grabbed my arm.\u201c!\u201dDyrus suddenly slipped into the hallway next to him, not the way we were going to go, and hid me behind a Gargoyle statue in the hallway. Dyrus\u2019 expression was serious.\u201cThe Knights of Duke Salerian.\u201dI knew what he meant, so I immediately held my breath.Duke Salerian.Bertus\u2019 maternal family and the reason he could have so many followers. If Charlotte had judged Sir Francis to not necessarily be an enemy, Duke Salerian would absolutely be the princess\u2019 enemy. The overarching goal of Duke Salerian was to make Bertus emperor.It was very likely that Sir Francis was killed by them.Dyrus held his breath and tensed up. I didn\u2019t know what kind of status Dyrus had, but he said he was a Lieutenant.In addition, the Knights of Duke Salerian, one of the most powerful noble families in the Empire, would have prestige not comparable to any other noble. Although I\u2019m not really sure, they must be high-ranking knights far more superior compared to normal knights.Not to mention their skills.-Clang, clang, clangThere were a large number of them.\u2013 Are you sure they entered the Castle and haven\u2019t come out?-Yes, I am.\u2013 Can\u2019t say if that\u2019s a good or bad thing\u2026.\u2013 What should we do if we find him?-Do I have to tell you?\u2013 Are we going to do that officer in, too?\u2013 It must have been his fate to end in such an unlucky way.They didn\u2019t mention a concrete person in their conversation, but it was clear who they were looking for.They were looking for me and Dyrus. Dyrus was holding his breath while clenching his teeth.They have to pass by. They can\u2019t notice us.Then.I realized how foolish it was to think that we could fool the senses of high-ranking knights.\u201cI think they\u2019re over there.\u201dOne of the knights said calmly, as if they were in no rush to find us.\u201cThey\u2019re breathing pretty harshly. Looks like they\u2019re nervous. Hey, it\u2019s hard not to notice that.\u201dA series of nearby knights arrived there after hearing the call.There were four knights in total. Dyrus and I stepped out from behind the statue and slowly backed away.Four knights in splendid plate armor came into view and were looking at Dyrus.The knight, wearing a relaxed expression, clicked his tongue slightly. Then the one who seemed the most senior opened his mouth.\u201cThe princess really is a pitiful girl.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the only one, but he keeps making me kill the hardliners \u201dThe knight sighed that he\u2019d have to kill 1 to 10 people. I didn\u2019t even feel like contradicting him.\u201cShame on you. For the Knights of the Empire, laying hands on the imperial family!\u201dDyrus shouted.\u201cIf you thought the whining of some kid I don\u2019t even know the name of would put even a small scratch on my honor\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I don\u2019t really care.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to care at all about the accusations he heard from people who weren\u2019t worth his time.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a pleasant thing. I admit that.\u201dHe smiled bitterly to himself.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that I have to end the day drenched in the blood of demons by spilling human blood.\u201dIt seemed quite unpleasant for him to have to do such a thing. Just because the princess didn\u2019t die, he had to do something like this.Apart from that displeasure, however, there was no hesitation in his actions.-Sching!When that knight drew his sword, all the other knights did the same. We could run back, but we\u2019d surely get caught sooner or later. Their physical abilities should completely transcend not only mine, but even Dyrus\u2019.A Scroll.Could we break through this situation with any of them?However, while I was leafing through the scroll book to choose a magic spell, they would just run up to me and slice my head off before I could even take a single breath.I was finally able to escape the Demon King\u2019s Castle, but did I just come back here to die like this?The thought of dying just like a dog in such an absurd situation made me feel feverish.I had to die again less than a day after I first died. The knights began to slowly approach us, as my breath tightened. Despite being in a huge corridor, the three knights\u2019 presence was enough to fill it.Of course, that was just a figure of speech, they weren\u2019t really filling the corridor, it just felt that way. The presence of those approaching knights\u2019 couldn\u2019t even be compared to that gigantic gargoyle statue Dyrus and I had been hiding behind just a moment ago\u2026.Wait a moment.Gargoyle?I stared blankly at the gargoyle statue.That.Don\u2019t these things usually move in places like this?Though that was a terrifying thought.-Whoosh!-Boom!The Gargoyle\u2019s giant halberd hit the knights approaching us from the front.Explosions.Astonishment.Death.\u201cRun!\u201dAnd judgment.Now was not the time to think.* * *The huge Gargoyle\u2019s merciless surprise completely crushed the knights who were approaching us with raging force. I clearly saw those high-ranking knights were literally shredded to bits even with their armor on. They didn\u2019t even get the chance to scream.They may be strong but this was the Demon King\u2019s Castle.It was the place that held the strongest forces of the Demon World.It wasn\u2019t hard to understand that the gargoyle was a powerful monster compared to high-ranking knights who were monsters among humans.I couldn\u2019t even feel nauseous. I avoided the bodies before I could even think about it.-Thud! Boom! Thud!We were able to escape while the knights pursuing us were responding to the suddenly activated gargoyle.\u201cW, why is it suddenly moving?\u201d\u201cI, I have no idea!\u201dNo, I did know.Obviously, all my physical abilities were close to 0, but I did have the ability to dominate demons. Perhaps my thoughts activated the gargoyle, or it sensed the knights\u2019 killing intent and acted on its own.Anyway, it clearly moved to protect me.I was born with the power to control demons.However, I couldn\u2019t tell him that, so running away was our top priority. No matter how many knights there were, they wouldn\u2019t have the ability to withstand the attacks of such a colossal monster.The castle, which was in the middle of getting searched, was thrown into chaos by the sudden explosions. Dyrus and I used that chance to quickly escape the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201cThere\u2019ll definitely be others following us.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Knights of Duke Salerian were scattered and searched for us. Although there was a skirmish happening, they\u2019d definitely pursue us if they knew we escaped. Dyrus put me on his horse and we rode straight out of the castle.We earned some curious glances as we rushed out, but this wasn\u2019t the time to be concerned about that.-Doo, doo, doo, doo!As soon as we arrived at the garrison, we had to teleport the hell out of here with Charlotte. I almost lost my mind while riding on that horse. It was hard just holding on to it.\u201cShit! They\u2019ve already caught up to us!\u201dTheir command system was in such perfect order, that the Knights of Duke Salerian caught up to us in no time. Despite there being so many eyes around, they wanted to catch us, even while risking there being rumors.That must have meant that even if they killed me and Dyrus right here, they\u2019d be able to take care of the aftermath themselves.It was impossible for them to kill the princess on the main road, but if it was just us they could do so easily. They\u2019d just make up some reason for that later.\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe horses the knights were riding on were far superior to Dyrus\u2019 steed. Even though they rode them while wearing armor they were still that fast.Despite being so far away from us at first, they were getting closer to us.The rapidly increasing number of pursuers was now over 10. The soldiers driving the loot wagons and the ones taking away the prisoners of war stared at this sudden chase blankly.\u201cLieutenant! Hold my waist tightly and secure me!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDyrus grabbed my waist and kept me from falling without asking what I was planning on doing. I opened the scroll book hanging from my waist, then I quickly looked for any magic spell that might help us in our current situation.Anything.Isn\u2019t there anything that we can use?[Haste]I opened the scroll and cast Haste on the horse.\u2013 Doo, doo, doo, doo!In an instant, the horse\u2019s movements became faster. White foam began to form around the horse\u2019s mouth.\u201cDamn it! It\u2019s good that it got faster, but this might kill the horse before we even arrive!\u201dHaste made one\u2019s movements faster, but it also made the target drain it\u2019s stamina rapidly. A horse wasn\u2019t an animal that could sprint for a long time in the first place. In addition to that, I applied acceleration magic, which insanely amplified its metabolism. This was like burning away the horse\u2019s life.It was going to be like that soon anyway.\u201cI\u2019d rather die after three minutes instead of one!\u201d\u201cWhat a nut job!\u201dEven in this situation, he had time to burst out into laughter as he was just that speechless. Dyrus rode like crazy. Despite it being a lot more difficult riding this faster horse, he kept on holding onto me and controlling his horse with one hand.\u201cShit\u2026!\u201dDyrus looked behind and cussed.\u201cThey\u2019re going to shoot arrows!\u201dThe knights weren\u2019t even using swords. They were just firing arrows at us because they couldn\u2019t catch up to us. Fortunately, Dyrus was able to dodge the arrows in an almost acrobatic way, which deflected the arrows.\u201cThe horse seems to get more and more exhausted!\u201dThe condition of their horses and our horse was so different. I mean, as I was in a hurry back then, Dyrus made his horse sprint to the Demon King\u2019s Castle a while ago as well.He made this already exhausted horse sprint and on top of that I cast Haste on it, so it was natural that it\u2019s stamina soon reached its end.I looked through the scroll book to see if there were any spells that could replenish the horse\u2019s stamina, but there wasn\u2019t any magic spell like that. There were only auxiliary type magic spells like Illusion, Fascination and Delusion inside.\u201cDo you think they\u2019d be affected by Fascination spells?!\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t! Knights are required to undergo anti-magic training!\u201dThey were all equipped with anti-magic measures. Low-level auxiliary magic won\u2019t work on them, is what Dyrus told me flat out. Yeah, I kind of expected that it wouldn\u2019t work. It would be a bit ridiculous for melee experts to just die after getting peppered with magic, so they set up some training sessions on how to counter magic.I knew that, because I put the subject \u201cAnti-magic Training\u201d into the academy\u2019s curriculum. Anyway, my set-up was pulling my legs right now.Nevertheless, I had to use a scroll.It was a risky gamble.I used Illusion.\u201cI told you it won\u2019t work!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not aiming for the knights!\u201dI opened the scroll to use its magic spell.The targets weren\u2019t the knights.If you would shoot a general, shoot his horse first.I intended to carry out that old idiom.[Illusion]The spell activated.-Neeeeeeigh!-Clatter!Then, the sounds of Knights falling to the ground and horses neighing could be heard from behind us.Fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like the horses were trained to resist magic.If magic didn\u2019t work on the knights, I\u2019d just cast the spell on their horses. I just showed the horses an illusion of a dragon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8\u201cYou\u2026! Great!\u201dI pulled out the Fascination scroll this time.The type of the spell didn\u2019t even matter. Anyway, any spell that could affect their horses would do. There was no other reason why I was taking on this risky gamble.Just as I was casting spells on their horses, they might cast some on our horse.However, Dyrus said clearly that the Coalition used up almost all their scrolls in this war.And none of them were magicians.I thought that even if they had a scroll book, they wouldn\u2019t have any more spells in them and it turned out to be the truth. The war was over and they couldn\u2019t get replacements for the scrolls they used and they obviously didn\u2019t have any more in stock.Most of them probably had attack spells in their scroll books that would have an intuitive immediate effect and they probably used up all of them. I started this gamble believing that.\u2013 Neeeeeeigh!-Bang!My guess was right.The horses toppled over after being affected by the low-level magic, causing the knights riding on them to come rolling down to the ground. Those that didn\u2019t manage to land properly were highly likely to die by breaking their necks.Some may have died.I didn\u2019t actively think about the fact that I might have killed them, as they were trying to kill me.Guilt, remorse or justifications for my actions didn\u2019t even occur to me at that point.I had to do everything I could. I had no other thoughts but that. The situation was so urgent that all my judgement seemed to have focused on only this single point.All concerns regarding ethics and values were put off until later. Not consciously, but unconsciously.\u201cShit!\u201dHowever, I didn\u2019t have any more mental magic I could use to knock them all downThere were two pursuers still chasing after us with rage filling their eyes.The horse we rode was already far over its limits. It was now slower than it was before I placed Haste on it.\u201cThey\u2019ll catch up to us.\u201dDyrus shouted in a desperate voice. The horse was exhausted and there were two knights, who witnessed their comrades fall down, still chasing after us from afar with killing intent so sharp pointed at us that it really felt like I was getting cut.The horse now started to just trudge, while the knights\u2019 horses followed us at a frightening speed. Dyrus clenched his teeth and pulled out his sword, however it didn\u2019t seem like he thought he could win.Was this the end?And then, I saw a long line of wagons and soldiers watching this chase.And.There was also the procession of those demon prisoners that seemed to go on forever.And I saw the eyes of those demons looking at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFrom Goblins to Trolls and unarmed Ogres, Orcs and countless other unknown types of demons.All these demons were watching this commotion.They were looking at me.Not even a single word was exchanged between us.I didn\u2019t say anything to them.They just looked at me without saying a word.They were demons of the Demon Realm who surrendered after losing their fighting spirit, knowing that their king died.As demons and monsters, they had to pay the price of defeat with their lives. Since no one would pay their ransom, the only thing they could pay with was their lives.They were looking at me.Because the Demon King was dead.And I was sure to be the last one.Seeing how I was betraying them.I didn\u2019t know how they were able to recognize me, but I felt like they knew who I was or were they able to read my feelings just by looking at me in this desperate situation?Or did the power sleeping inside of me \u2018Demon domination\u2019 activate because of this situation?The process and outcome were unknown to me.However, after giving up everything, they looked at me with eyes that seemed to have found their last hope.-Crank!An ogre broke his shackles that bound him and began charging at the knights rushing towards me.-Kuooooooooooooh!With a roar that seemed to shake the heavens and earth, the demons, who were tied up and quietly let themselves get dragged away before, immediately began to resist.\u201cCr, cra, crazy!\u201dIn the end, the two knights who were following us were attacked by the ogre rushing at them.Once again everything got chaotic as the prisoners of war began to riot.This was the last resistance of the remaining demons in order to save their last king.* * *They didn\u2019t use ropes to tie the demons. It was impossible for others to break them except if they were large monsters like an ogre. Most of the demons were just struggling to make a commotion.Therefore, the prisoners began to be subdued and that suppression ultimately just turned out to be bloody slaughter. The only thing that changed was that they got killed here by the troops and not on the execution grounds.Because of the disturbance caused by the demons and the suppression of the last pursuers no one was chasing after us anymore.Dyrus seemed to find this absurd situation hard to accept.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026.\u201dThe gargoyle activated to kill some knights just at the right time and just when we were in a desperate situation the demons decided to riot and attack the knights.Dyrus knew that this was abnormal. He just couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on exactly. However their main goal of escaping with Charlotte was yet unfulfilled.Dyrus seemed to hold back his doubts. He remained silent until we drew near to the garrison.The atmosphere at the garrison was definitely exhilarating.-Is Her Royal Highness really still alive?-Yeah, she just came out and shook hands with the soldiers telling them that she was alright.-She just went back to the barracks to get some rest\u2026.\u2013 What a relief, what a relief.\u2013 That dog-like Demon King died and the princess was still alive. How blessed can we be?-Hey man, the Empress died though, so to call it a blessing is\u2026\u2026-That\u2019s true, I hope that Her Highness will soon get back on her feet\u2026.As Charlotte expected, the news that the princess was still alive had already spread throughout the garrison. It seemed like they hadn\u2019t gotten the report about the rioting prisoners of war yet.There were more eyes and ears here.But it was too early to feel reassured. The Knights of Duke Salerian tried to kill Dyrus and me, despite the presence of all those wagons and convoys. It was just the princess who was difficult to touch.Even if news arrived that Dyrus and I killed their knights, there would be nothing about them trying to kill us, so no one would care.They would have so many reasons ready why they had to immediately execute us.Soon, news of what happened close to the Demon King\u2019s Castle would reach this place. Before that happened, we had to get out of here.Fortunately, the soldiers\u2019 eyes were fixed on the HQ barracks where the princess was said to rest.They seemed to wonder if they\u2019d ever be able to see the princess\u2019 face, who was said to be still alive. However, because of that, the barracks were completely encircled. We had no way to sneak in.There was no way around it.Dyrus and I strode straight towards the barracks.The guard looked at me and shook his head before I could even say anything.\u201cHer Highness is resting. Go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve brought the goods Her Royal Highness asked for.\u201dIt seemed like nothing would make this guardsman budge.\u201cThere was an order from the Commander-in-chief that she needed absolute rest. Come back later.\u201dThe moment we\u2019ll try to go back, you\u2019d just try to kill us secretly.Even if that didn\u2019t happen, it would be over as soon as the news from the Demon King\u2019s Castle arrived here.We had to get in there somehow.\u201cIt\u2019s urgent.\u201dAt those words, the guard\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cEven if you were rescued together with the Imperial Princess, we can\u2019t let someone with an unclear identity like you be by her side. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re having some ideas?\u201dYou guys are more dangerous to her, though?That guard would certainly rather die than let me in. He was staring at me and pointing the end of his spear at me as if telling me that he\u2019d be forced to use violence if we tried to force our way in.I had no idea what Charlotte\u2019s condition was inside, but it seemed like she wasn\u2019t able to come out to me, even if she knew that we arrived.They wouldn\u2019t know what I was trying to do.However, knowing that I had received some instructions from the princess, they tried to prevent me from meeting her subtly.The problem was that I neither had the strength nor justification to break through their vague actions.\u201cBoy.\u201dAt that moment, Dyrus called out to me.\u201cLieutenant.\u201dHe took a deep breath, sighing as if he had no other choice.\u201cIt\u2019s plan B.\u201d-Sigh!\u201cKuek!\u201dAs if it was a sign, he drew his sword and stuck it right in the neck of the guard, before his opponent could do anything.\u201cYou crazy!\u201dThe other guards just spat out swear words, completely in shock that their comrade was suddenly stabbed like this.\u201cGo!\u201dWhile Dyrus cut one attacking guard after the other, I just stopped thinking and ran into the barracks.As I broke through several layers of tents, I could see Charlotte, who quietly sat in her seat inside and countless other people standing around her, not touching her, but they seemed to monitor her.\u201c!\u201dCharlotte looked at me, opening her eyes so wide her eyelids seemed to be about to rip apart.An old man wearing a white priest\u2019s robe shouted in a brusque tone.\u201cI believe I made it clear that you were not to let anyone in\u2026\u2026 !\u201dThere was no time for conversations.[Flash]\u201cKuerk!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s using magic!\u201d\u2013 Flash!In an instant a flash of light exploded inside the tent. While everyone was blinded by the light, I unblocked my eyes and grabbed Charlotte\u2019s hand, who was also affected by the sudden flash.Charlotte was equally perplexed as the others. Charlotte told me to get Sir Francis and not to break in here and shoot out a flare.[Mass teleport][Please specify destination.]I cast mass teleportation.\u201cTo Gardium!\u201dOur destination was the Imperial Capital.We\u2019re going to Imperial Capital Gardium![You have passed the Prologue sequence.][Special Achievement \u2013 Inflection Point of History][A key figure (Charlotte de Gardias) who should not have appeared in the original story line has survived.][The future has changed dramatically.][Acquired 1000 Achievement Points.]I was finally done with that hellish prologue.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9This was called teleportation.It was really unbelievable, experiencing this first-hand.As the flash of light subsided, the scenery was completely different. Unlike the Demon Realm, which was covered by a gray sky, a blue sky and a bustling city spread out before my eyes.The very place where the main story of my novel [The Demon King is Dead] unfolded.The Imperial Capital Gardium.It gave me a strange feeling seeing the place I had only described with words before\u2026Like shit.Where are we?I don\u2019t know this place.No, well, to be fair, I didn\u2019t describe every single corner of the Capital. I mean, if I did I would have been cussed out for making the chapters longer by adding useless descriptions.Perhaps we were in a plaza somewhere in the in the capital. People were looking at me and the princess who suddenly appeared out of nowhere through teleportation with puzzled expressions. Teleportation was a super high-level spell, so it was definitely not commonly seen.So, in the end, I arrived in the Capital Gardium, a city I wrote about, but had no clue about.\u201cHaah\u2026. Wha, what happened? Thi, this is\u2026The Capital?\u201dAnd next to me, Princess Charlotte de Gardias, who had teleported with me, held a puzzled expression on her face as well.I was supposed to bring her an escort, but I ended up kidnapping her using teleportation magic, so it was natural that she was surprised.\u201cSir Francis has already been killed. So I went back into the Demon King\u2019s Castle to find some teleportation scrolls. I thought that the Imperial Capital would be the safest place for the princess.\u201dAfter hearing my explanation, the princess widened her eyes. She was shocked to hear that Sir Francis had already been killed and seemed surprised that I was able to come up with an alternative method so quickly and saved her from a situation like that.Yeah, it\u2019s not like a normal 17-year-old would have that wit.But even considering my original age, this was hard to come by!I almost died again a few timesLater.\u201cYes, well done\u2026. You did a really, really good job.\u201dCharlotte plopped down on a nearby bench, apparently because she felt relieved.She had almost breathed her last.It was pretty scary thinking like that.\u2013 Flash!Dyrus arrived in front of me with a flash of light.\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201dDyrus, who seemed to have been escaping from a rather desperate situation, arrived in front of us while breathing heavily.\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Lieutenant!\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. A little later and they would have blown away an arm or a leg.\u201dDyrus took a deep breath and fell straight to his knees. Not before me, but before Charlotte.\u201cLieutenant Dyrus, commander of the 3rd Platoon, 11th Company, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Imperial Corps. I give my sincerest greetings, Your Imperial Highness the First Princess.\u201dCharlotte didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on.* * *We had two teleportation scrolls.Plan A was rather simple. Just approach the princess and use the Mass Teleport Scroll if the guards let us through the entrance.Plan B was for Dyrus to open up a path for me and take the aggro off of me. Dyrus would escape with a single person Teleport Scroll, while I brought away the princess using the Mass Teleportation Scroll.Dyrus had confirmed that we got away and escaped himself.Of course, Charlotte was astonished seeing a stranger appear out of the blue, so I explained the whole story first. I explained that if it weren\u2019t for Lieutenant Dyrus, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to perform my mission properly.Charlotte nodded her head, still wearing a puzzled expression.\u201cThank you. Lieutenant Dyrus.\u201dCharlotte expressed her gratitude, saying that he greatly helped her.\u201cAs a soldier of the Imperial Family, I shall always put the safety of the Imperial Family first.\u201dDyrus had made a difficult decision. No matter how much a soldier should say these words, putting them actually into practice was a completely different matter. He risked his life throwing himself into the forces who were trying to kill the princess as if it was natural. He had no hesitation or thoughts that he might die.I just did what I did because my life was intertwined with hers, but this dude was the real deal.Charlotte nodded as if she thought so as well.\u201cWouldn\u2019t our enemies be able to come after us using teleportation magic?\u201dThat was our most pressing concern now. There definitely were wizards among our enemies, and I pretty much shouted out that we were teleporting to Gardium. They obviously knew where we were.Dyrus\u2019 expression hardened at my words.\u201cWe must move quickly.\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have to.\u201dCharlotte, however, was calm.\u201cThere should be no wizards among the Coalition Forces who could successfully teleport from the Demon Realm to Gardium. We have moved an unbelievably far distance. This was originally impossible. Obviously, there were no Warp Gates near the Demon King\u2019s Castle either, so no one would be able to pursue us.\u201dInforming us that the Demon\u2019s Scrolls had unbelievably great performances, Charlotte denied the possibility of pursuers coming after us using teleportation.\u201cHowever, They can report this matter using communication magic. Well, it will take a while, so that should be enough for us to reach the Imperial Palace.\u201dCommunication magic wasn\u2019t instantaneous. There would be delays. To be exact, the distance between these two locations was so great that there would be just as great a delay\u00a0 until the magic spell reached the right person.First he heard that the princess was alive, so he gave orders to kill her, this time it had to be reported that the princess had already teleported to Gardium.\u201cCould you explain what happened, Lieutenant Dyrus?\u201d\u201cYes, I shall explain.\u201dSo we didn\u2019t have that much time to spare, but we still took the time to explain what happened to the princess as we walked down the streets of the Capital. When we reached the part about me nearly dying to the Knights of the Duke, the princess seemed sorry while looking at me. I did this to survive, so she didn\u2019t have to feel sorry for me.Of course, I could have used the teleport scroll as soon as I left the Demon King\u2019s Castle if I just wanted to live, but that\u2019s not how I wanted it to be.I don\u2019t know why, but I couldn\u2019t just leave Charlotte behind even when my life was at stake. I knew one didn\u2019t need a reason to save someone, but this was the first time I risked my life for another. I could only say that it was something wholly unfamiliar to me.Anyway, all\u2019s well that ends well. But I\u2019m pretty goddamn sure that I wouldn\u2019t be able to pull something like this off more than once.Anywho, while Dyrus was recounting the incident, I felt a chill running down my spine..Looking back at the story, there were just too many unnatural parts.A Gargoyle suddenly activated and blocked the knights.The demons suddenly rioted and for some reason the captured demons acted as if they were trying to protect us.The first one could be chalked up as a coincidence, but the second situation was just too suspicious. It was just too convenient.Dyrus just seemed to feel lucky to be alive, but I was watching the princess\u2019 expression harden.She was Charlotte, who had lived in the Imperial Castle, that could be said to be the main stage for political battles. She\u2019s been through some things, but she was extraordinarily smart. As soon as she was released from a situation where she was pushed to her limits both physically and mentally, she immediately foresaw her own death.Those strange incidents.A boy who lost his memory.A teleport scroll I found as if I knew exactly where it was.There were ample of reasons to be suspicious of me. I didn\u2019t know what conclusion they\u2019d draw from this, but as far as I could see it wouldn\u2019t be a good one for me.It was clear what conclusion the princess would reach. I didn\u2019t know what choice she\u2019d make, but I couldn\u2019t wait for her to decide on one.I slowed down a bit and walked behind them. Fortunately, Dyrus was close to the princess and was prepared for any unexpected events.That\u2019s good.It would be good if the princess owed me, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay close to her as I\u2019d risk my identity being discovered someday.It was a relationship that couldn\u2019t have lasted long anyway.This was the only time I could pull out.I walked slowly and silently, then I quickly entered an alleyway I passed by.Even if she was willing to give me a thousand gold, I could no longer be associated with the princess.The princess would be safe, but I, on the other hand, had entered another tiger\u2019s den.It was impossible for me to go to a place full of powerful and aristocratic people with my camouflage magic, that could get dissolved just by using weak dispel magic.How come I\u2019ve only ever been able to make short-term goals ever since I entered this world?And why did I alway have to risk my life to reach these short-term goals?Passing the alleyway, I hid so that the princess and Dyrus couldn\u2019t find me.They wouldn\u2019t be looking for me now. Going back to the Imperial Palace held priority.I first left that collapsing cave called the Demon King\u2019s Castle only to end up in the tiger\u2019s den, the garrison of the Coalition Forces, but that was just a stepping stone to enter the dragon\u2019s lair called the Imperial Palace.After walking around for a while, I finally stopped at a quiet spot and sat down on a bench.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dLeaving everything aside, I had to take a rest.\u201cFuck\u2026.\u201dUsing some common saying, my mind was exploding.It seemed that I had faced so many bloody trials, witnessed so many people getting slaughtered and I even caused some people\u2019s death with my own hands.While coming this far, my mind had already crossed its limits several times.Let\u2019s rest for now. Let\u2019s take a break and sort out all these horrible memories somehow.And think about what to do next.* * *This was the first time I could take a break after having met so many desperate situations and being driven into a corner so many times in this unfamiliar world. I felt a subtle sense of relief that I wasn\u2019t forced to go anywhere.I was currently somewhere in the Imperial Capital.As I saw it, the Imperial Capital was somewhat similar to Seoul in Korea. It went without saying that it was an incredibly large city, the largest on the entire continent. In this day and age, a city of that size wasn\u2019t all that common.I was now sitting on a bench on a promenade of some sort, it wasn\u2019t too deserted or too crowded. The Imperial Capital was already a bustling and flourishing city, but the Empire will prosper even more with the victory of the Demon World War.In any case, if I want to survive, I can\u2019t force myself to think about certain things.While trying to put my splintered heart back together, I somehow had to suppress these terrible memories and rationalize my guilt.From this point on I had to think about what I had to and was able to do.I had a few problems.I didn\u2019t have any money.I had no place to live or food to eat. It was even more nonsensical to go back to the princess for that.Working and somehow making money would also be rather difficult. What if my camouflage magic suddenly wore off while I was washing dishes in some restaurant? They also wouldn\u2019t give me any advanced payment and I had an unclear identity.I was now slowly realizing in real time why vagrants fell into crime.Except through criminal ways, I had no other way to make ends meet. Couldn\u2019t I somehow get into some sort of public childcare facility or something? Did places like this even exist here? No matter how crazy one was about creating settings, who\u2019d be so crazy as to set up a public childcare system in their novel\u2026\u2026?Oh.Now that I think of it.I indeed did such a crazy thing.A project to manage the large numbers of orphans caused by the casualties of the Demon World War would be carried out as a post-war measure.I knew this because there were some children from said public childcare facilities in Temple, the main stage of my school drama. I wrote that there were quite a few children of people who were killed in the Demon World War in Temple, among them were also major characters.However, the news of the victory against the demons had just been delivered. Such a large-scale policy wouldn\u2019t have been implemented so quickly.That was highly unlikely.I could try to go to some place similar to an orphanage and ask them to take me in, but regardless of whether they accepted me or not, this was still the Imperial Capital.Even if she didn\u2019t do so right now, there was a high possibility that the princess would try to find me.Whether she wanted to reward me or take action to find out who I was, it was very likely that the princess would try to find me for some kind of reason.And she should be able to infer that I\u2019d eventually go to some public childcare facility. She was smart after all.So, if I went to an orphanage, I\u2019d be able to survive for some days, but I\u2019d alway feel anxious about the princess coming to find me one day.She might not be able to find me if I went to a different city, but I didn\u2019t have the money to travel around. I didn\u2019t have much confidence about surviving in the wilderness either.And although I was a demon, seeing as I was carrying around biscuits, I was sure that I had to eat.Actually, I was hungry right now. I should have put in some convenient setting like \u201cDemons could survive solely through mana\u2019 or something![Used the function \u2018Add Settings\u2019.]\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d[A total of 100000 achievement points are required to add the setting \u2018Race Arcdemon can supplement nutrition by consuming magical power\u2019.]A message suddenly appeared in front of my eyes.\u2026What\u2019s with this?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: 10Then it occured to me that I should probably think more about these occasional message windows appearing in front of me. I never mentioned those in my novel.I wasn\u2019t all that sure about this subject, but what I had to think about the most right now were probably these achievement points.So, the way I understood it was, that the novel I wrote now suddenly had a game system implanted in it, making it some strange chimera..Who the hell would read this shit? Even though I prayed so much on every holiday for some kind of cheat, this just wasn\u2019t right.Anyway, I might have been given some type of cheat skill. Even if this turned into some dog-shit novel, if I could live a comfortable life I\u2019d prefer that over anything else.I kind of understood now why the \u2018isekai\u2019 genre got so popular. I\u2019d have been living comfortably if I had just written more novels of that genre.No, I wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been reincarnated as the main character, so I might have ended up in an even more unfortunate situation. Maybe as just a normal high schooler or something. Moreover, I would have to watch some nerdy high school kid, who was also heir to his family\u2019s\u00a0 secret art of swordsmanship, holding a japanese sword, talking up a big game, wouldn\u2019t I? Aah, if I had to follow that kind of brain dead main character I might die of high blood pressure again.Anyway.I really hope I can become some godsend cheater in this dog-shit I wrote.Hoping that I was the owner of such a cheat, I tried to look through the system. Just by thinking about it, a message appeared before my eyes.[Congratulations, you have been granted the power to interfere with the world of \u2018The Demon King is Dead\u2019, your undisputed masterpiece, which was rated as \u2018Neither this nor that and a typographical crime\u2019 by the office of Atonement, Judgement and Evaluation]Why are you insulting me all of a sudden?I\u2019ve been calling this novel dog shit all this time, but hearing those things from someone else made me feel kind of depressed.[You will have to go through events from time to time. There are various types, from minor to major events. Most of the rewards will be in the form of achievement points.]I couldn\u2019t find anything as convenient as a settings window. I didn\u2019t need something like volume control, but couldn\u2019t you at least give me some kind of interface?It didn\u2019t seem like there was anything like that.[You can change the main story by preventing things that should happen or making things happen that shouldn\u2019t. In case you do such things you might get more achievement points than for normal events.][Additionally, you can also earn some through \u2018Challenges\u2019. If you succeed in overcoming a challenge, you will get achievement points.]What did they mean with Challenges?[Challenges are challenges. If you would like to take on a challenge, please check the \u2018List of currently available Challenges\u2019. The entries are updated periodically. Some challenges may not appear again.]When I checked the Challenge list, I immediately understood what they were.[Slap the Emperor across the face (Full swing only) \u2013 10000 Points][Get imprisoned in the Gardium Prison \u2013 1200 Points][Escape from the prison after getting imprisoned \u2013 2000 Points][Pickpocket a Knight without getting caught \u2013 100 points][Buy an over 1067 m\u00b2 house with money earned from begging \u2013 1000 Points]...Somehow, I felt like there were no normal options on the listSlap the Emperor? You want me to exchange my life for achievement points? I think it\u2019s impossible for me to get an audience with the Emperor in the first place, you know?What\u2019s with this feature that made one feel like crap by just looking at it?So what else was there? I need to know these things first.[As a reward for clearing the Prologue, the privilege of using achievement points has been given.][Achievement points are used for \u2018Revising\u2019 functions such as changing certain settings of this world, forcibly granting you certain talents, making events happen that shouldn\u2019t or prevent events from happening that should. Furthermore, the function \u2018Preview\u2019 can be used limitedly, to check the changes your actions have caused. However, interfering with big events or main characters is impossible or requires a fairly large amount of achievement points.][Be careful not to cause a \u2018Setting Collapse\u2019. If you are not able to recognize the collapse of the setting and try to add new settings or try to \u2018revise\u2019 the event, you will be penalized. If your memory is bad enough to cause a setting collapse in your own novel, I recommend you to add the setting \u2018A cure for Alzheimer\u2019s exists in this world.\u2019]It didn\u2019t seem that serious in the beginning, but are you trying to pick a fight with me? Am I imagining things ?[Keep in mind, you cannot remove settings that have been added or already exist.][For example if the setting \u2018The Dragon can\u2019t be killed\u2019 was already in place you won\u2019t be able to add the setting \u2018The Dragon can be killed\u2019.][Of course, while you were alive you used to paste additional settings to your already existing one\u2019s later on, regretting the choices you made like an idiot, like \u2018Actually, the Dragon couldn\u2019t be killed normally, but it was possible using the Dragon Slayer OO\u2019. Frivolous behavior such as adding \u2018additional settings\u2019 Like \u201cIt\u2019s XX but it was actually OO\u2019 will require more achievement points or will not be tolerated.]I definitely did not imagine things, it was the truth. You were really picking a fight with me.What\u2019s with this? It wasn\u2019t just here to help me. This felt like I was reading malicious comments written by someone who absolutely hated me. Why were these descriptions charged with emotions?There was clearly some malicious intent behind these mysterious messages. Just looking at the mention of what I did when I was still alive, made it obvious. And just hearing about the additional settings made me feel like shit.That seriously broke my heart. I\u2019m not joking. I\u2019m 100% serious.People tend to feel bad if they are faced with the uncomfortable truth. That was a fact.Just who was writing this? Was it in real time?Then a sudden thought went through my mind. Was everything that happened here actually\u00a0 broadcasted to the outside?\u2018Come, watch some asshole newbie writer get punished.\u2019. Maybe it was titled like this?No, well, I wasn\u2019t that bad, you know\u2026. So if this was getting broadcasted, who was doing that? \u2018Cause Frick you.[Achievement point requirements are subject to change. A feature that may have cost you 100 points yesterday might cost 200 points or 50 points the next day. It might not even work anymore.]I wondered if it would respond to my thoughts, but I was a little disappointed as it didn\u2019t address any of them. Were you telling me that my thoughts weren\u2019t even worth dealing with?After that, numerous actions that could be done using Achievement Points were listed.I felt something the moment I saw that.So.It seemed like this was my cheat.It was a cheat, but an oddly uncooperative cheat.It seemed like I, as a writer who was sent into his own novel, had the ability to directly interfere with this world\u2019s common sense. I was pretty sure that was what the functions \u2018Revise\u2019 and \u2018Add Settings\u2019 were for. So my purpose was to rewrite my novel and make it a little more interesting.But.It had clearly stated earlier that it would take 100000 points to add something to race settings.Also, I was being punished, not rewarded here.Based on the developments so far, I don\u2019t think this will help me much. To begin with, the fact that I reincarnated as the Demon King\u2019s son didn\u2019t feel that random anymore. I could feel a lot of malice mixed into all of this.These functions might turn out to be important someday, but I only had 1100 achievement points.What could I do with these?[For example, take this situation: you can trigger the event \u2018The bakery owner gives you, a poor beggar, a piece of bread.\u2019 to satisfy your hunger, which wouldn\u2019t otherwise happen. Of course, if the subject is less altruistic it would require a greater amount of achievement points to trigger this event. This means that it would require a large amount of achievement points to cause something that would seriously violate the \u2018Law of Probability\u2019. You know the Law of Probability, right? the one you repeatedly screwed with? The biggest reason why you gave up on your novels after getting criticized for ruining the story and being unable to fix it, giving only ugly excuses .]What do you mean, a beggar? I\u2019ve got plenty of other opportunities! That\u2019s just too much.Reading that description, it felt like it was written by one of the victims of my bad habits.I didn\u2019t really know who they were, whether it was the will of this world or God, but they must\u2019ve really hated me.And why were there so many restrictions?So, big things, such as interfering with the main characters or causing the death of someone, who was unlikely to die, under the guise of an accident, would, of course, require an insane amount of achievement points or would be entirely impossible.No.But wouldn\u2019t I be able to do \u2018that\u2019 if I had a lot of achievement points? That.That \u2018Half die\u2019 move or something like that.Wasn\u2019t this actually one hell of a cheat?Achievement points could eventually be used to revise and add settings on a larger scale. In the end, it was a matter of scope and scale and it not deviating from those two frameworks.For example, one could understand this as being able to rewrite a novel.However, I wondered if I could break through my current situation with just 1100 achievement points. While looking through the functions that used achievement points, I discovered a peculiar one.[Function \u2013 A Writer\u2019s advice]What\u2019s this? Advice from who now?[Sometimes, you may find yourself before a crossroad or you may not know how to proceed.\u00a0 In that case, you can execute \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019 to receive advice from the writer on what to do next.][This feature is of rather low cost, but usually it\u2019s unknown what consequences said advice will lead to or what purpose it serves.][Sometimes the Writer\u2019s Advice is a trap. Following it could have bad consequences for you. It\u2019s common to receive both good and bad results simultaneously. There\u2019s rarely just a good outcome.][Advice can be divided into \u2018Clear Advice\u2019 and \u2018Vague Advice\u2019. \u2018Clear Advice\u2019 suggests certain actions, but is more likely to lead to bad results, while \u2018Vague Advice\u2019 is more likely to have only good outcomes, although it is hard to guess the intent behind it.][Wish you the best of luck.]You don\u2019t even pretend to be an explanatory text anymore.I felt my heart breaking just by reading that description.* * *There were many things I could do with my current amount of points. If I went to a grocery store with a generous owner and caused an event, I would be able to get food.However, that was just temporary. It would be great if I made a kind, wealthy family accept me as their adopted child, but I didn\u2019t know how many points that would cost. And also, how was I to find out if they were a nice family or not?Also, who is that description person? Why do they hate me so much?If one told me they were a collection of people that hated my guts, I\u2019d believe it.After examining various possibilities, in the end, the only thing I could really try right now was \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019.There was a possibility of the advice being a trap, but its price was low.[A Writer\u2019s Advice \u2013 150 Points]I was told that the achievement point cost was variable. After some time, the prices might suddenly inflate and it might end up costing more than a thousand points.It was also up to me whether I took the advice or not.I executed \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019.[Clear Advice][Vague Advice]There were two options. Clear Advice was easy to understand but was most likely a trap and Vague Advice was the complete opposite.And if one took the advice, most of the time good and bad things would occur simultaneously.I mean, it couldn\u2019t really get any worse than my current situation. Homeless and hungry.No, it could be worse. My life could be in danger.Still, to increase my odds even by a little I chose [Vague Advice].[A Writer\u2019s Vague Advice][How did so many people get kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle?]What.What\u2019s with this?This went beyond vague, and straight up had nothing to do with my situation at all.What\u2019s with that riddle all of a sudden?No, couldn\u2019t you at least tell me something like \u2018Go this way, go that way\u2019? I thought some voice would tell me what to do, but instead this riddle suddenly appeared. I was dumbfounded.Kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle.What was I supposed to do with this? Let myself get kidnapped?This obviously wasn\u2019t a trap, which I thought was good. If this were a trap, they would have made it a lot more clear, otherwise I\u2019d doubt their intelligence.\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dAs I sighed deeply while looking at the ground, a guy passing by looked at me strangely.Do you even know how I feel?If I knew how these people got kidnapped, would my situation be any better? They were just kidnapped. I didn\u2019t know how vague that advice was supposed to be, but this was hella cryptic.I\u2019d rather it gave me some solid advice.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dOh, rightCouldn\u2019t I try it one more time?[A Writer\u2019s Advice \u2013 150 Points]I wasn\u2019t told that I couldn\u2019t use it repeatedly.No, wait, why is it like this?Back when I was alive, I really hated these types of gacha games, so I didn\u2019t even try to play any of these, so why did I have to do something like this after coming to another world.It\u2019s not like I poured a thousand won into buying some gacha crystals or something. However, I did have to put my life on the line to get these points, so I couldn\u2019t help but cry bitter tears.I chose Clear Advice this time.[A Writer\u2019s Clear Advice][Go to the Magic Tool Shop]Yes.That\u2019s the type of advice I was looking for.Who\u2019d have known.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Go to the Magic Tool Shop.It was an intuitive and clear message and I could immediately understand what this advice was about.One of the biggest problems I was facing was:Money.When I saw the word Magic Tool Shop, I couldn\u2019t help but get this idea right away. I didn\u2019t have anything other than the clothes on my body and my labour to offer.And the scrolls remaining in the Scroll book.If I were to sell the scrolls to a magic tool shop, I\u2019d, of course, make lots of money. Scrolls were expensive after all.The intentions I read out of this were to first put out the big fire by selling these to get money.However, I wasn\u2019t that reassured. The Writer\u2019s Advice would have good but also bad effects simultaneously in most cases.It advised me to sell the scrolls to raise money.A bad outcome I could think of would be the possibility of getting ripped off, of course. I didn\u2019t know the market price, so the store owner would probably try to rip me off. I didn\u2019t know the exact value of magic scrolls.But I clearly remember Dyrus saying something like:\u2018The Demon King\u2019s Castle sure is amazing, even lower level scrolls are often more expensive than my salary.\u2019A lower level scroll was worth more or less the salary of a Lieutenant of the Imperial Army\u2019s Cavalry.So how much did a Cavalry Lieutenant earn?As a (Self-proclaimed) Medieval Fantasy Specialist, I knew a thing or two about this.There were always descriptions of how many gold coins one needed to feed a family of four, as well as, how much a regular person with an ordinary job would earn in a month.Of course, I also wrote about those things.In the case of this novel here, I had written that a gold coin was equivalent to a month\u2019s food expenses for a family of four. And a regular person with an ordinary job earned about 2 gold coins a month.So.I thought 1 gold coin = 1 million won. (T/N: ca 730 Euro)It was easier to work with if I converted it like that.How could a family of four live on just a million won a month? Wouldn\u2019t they want to eat out at some point? Our house spends about 400 on food, you know?I got these kinds of comments, but they\u2019ll get by somehow.These weren\u2019t living expenses, they were just food expenses. There were no such things as comprehensive insurance, health insurance or telecommunication costs in this world after all!I, as a (self-proclaimed) Medieval Fantasy Expert say:One who seriously researches about the historical background is but a rookie!There are just some things one wouldn\u2019t be able to see if one didn\u2019t empty their minds.I felt sorry for those who weren\u2019t able to enjoy this beautiful medieval fantasy world of magic, knights and social infrastructure that has virtually no science.I have lived by the following ideals:The focus of Medieval Fantasy isn\u2019t on the Medieval part, but on the Fantasy part!It\u2019s not a \u2018Medieval\u2019 Fantasy, but a medieval Fantasy!Most of them didn\u2019t even have anything to do with the Middle Ages! It was kind of like a buzzword!Anyway, How about we do OO with the setting of XX, lol?The genre Medieval Fantasy was created by such shallow thoughts, however what unfolded in front of our eyes is a fantastical world that had nothing to do with the Middle Ages!\u2026This was fantastical in a different sense.Let\u2019s sell the scrolls and live on to see another day.I was neither a wizard nor was I a knight, although I do have the ability to rule over demons, however as I was a Demon Prince who had fallen to the Imperial Capital, Gardium, there wasn\u2019t even a single demon around here.\u201c\u2026.\u2026Excuse me. Could you give me some directions?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? directions?\u201dI tried to ask a passerby, who felt some silent embarrassment for the way I spoke, for the most important thing right now.\u201cOh! Are you lost?\u201dNo, well, a little.* * *The ones who mainly used magic tool shops were adventurers and wizards. Of course, This wasn\u2019t an adventure novel, so while there were people who were adventurers, that didn\u2019t really describe what they did. They did have a job, but I\u2019ve never really thought about that.\u2026Come to think of it, how did adventurers make a living in this world? Did they get by with quests from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild and monster subjugations? Was there even something like an Adventurer\u2019s Guild?There were adventurers, but I hadn\u2019t set up what they earn or through what means.If one thought about it, that was seriously weird.When I tried thinking of ways adventurer\u2019s earned their money, I could only think of dungeon explorations and monster subjugations.However, if that\u2019s how adventurers earned their money, that would also be a problem.There was a regular army, so why did freelancers like adventurers do things like monster subjugations? If the country outsourced personnel to get rid of security issues, such as monster dens and raids, why did that country even exist? What did the citizens pay taxes for?Although the Warrior Artorius actually killed the Demon King, but the Empire and its Principalities, that had enough military power to take on the Demon Army, solved their monster problems through the Adventurer\u2019s Guild? What were the soldiers good for then?So, if the regular army took care of monster subjugations and there were no such quests coming from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, then how did the adventurers earn their keep?Well, if the whole world was filled with dungeons for adventurers to plunder wouldn\u2019t that be weird as well? Why were rare magical items just rolling around in a dungeon and no country went to claim them for themselves? Wouldn\u2019t they usually do something like nationalizing the dungeons so that adventurers wouldn\u2019t monopolize them?Wasn\u2019t the existence of adventurers in and of itself a setting error judging by this world\u2019s common sense?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf one started to pay attention to historical accuracy, one would lose, but I started to worry a little.It really bothered me.Since I started to think that this was the world I had to live in, I seriously tried to move on from that topic.Let\u2019s not think about this anymore. It\u2019s not like hungry adventurers would just rush up to people asking for a penny. If adventurers didn\u2019t have jobs, they\u2019d just be robbers or even bandits.There was just one thing I really had to care about.To not get ripped off in the Magic Tool Store. I had to get at least 1 gold piece for each scroll. I was planning on keeping constant eye contact, to appear strong. I didn\u2019t think it was too much to ask for a regular price. However, if they were to whine about the quality being not up to par or something, I\u2019d never sell it to them.I planned to go eat somewhere after I got some money.I was so hungry.Afterwards, I should find an inn and take some time to organize my thoughts.There were positive points about the Writer\u2019s advice in that it clearly determined what I should do, regardless of whether the advice was right or not.If the advice was unconditionally good, I\u2019d just empty my brain and follow what it told me.Oh, is that why there were traps in there? They wanted me to stay on my toes?Did they want to see me struggle or something?* * *As the main stage of the story, I had to describe the Capital Gardium in quite detail.No, well, I didn\u2019t go quite as far as describing every single brick. It was just specific areas.However, setting up an imaginary place was quite cumbersome. It was pretty difficult, because there was a strong possibility that I might make mistakes and if it wasn\u2019t properly set up, one would just get confused later on.That said, the Capital Gardium was pretty similar to Seoul.Was it just similar?Well, I must confess, it was just Seoul with a different name.This was my description of the Imperial Capital.\u2018A great Irene river runs through the Imperial Capital Gardium, splitting it in the northern part where the imperial palace was located and the southern part where the temple was located. The river\u2019s huge tributaries serve as its borders.\u2019Could you see it?Gangnam\u00a0and\u00a0Gangbuk.\u2018In the center of the northern part of Gardium lies the Imperial Palace Emperatos.\u2019In other words, the Imperial palace in\u00a0Jongno. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as big as\u00a0Gyeongbokgung Palace, the entire Jongno District was the imperial palace after all.\u2018In the southern Eredian district, one of the Capital\u2019s two greatest landmarks, the Temple, the other one being the Imperial Palace, was located. It was also a gigantic educational facility and the cradle of many talented young people.\u2019In other words, the Temple was in the\u00a0Gwanak District.So Eredian District = Gwanak District.So I ended up setting up the Capital Gardium as a space so similar to Seoul that the only thing different about it was the name. The districts also had medieval sounding names.This was an actual sentence out of the novel.[The main character\u2019s party sprinted all the way from the Gehenna district to the Eredian district. The effect of their physical training was showing.]How the scene actually appeared in my mind:\u2018The main character\u2019s party ran from the\u00a0Dongjak District\u00a0to the Gwanak District.\u2019It was kind of like that. I wouldn\u2019t even need to create a different map. I could just imagine Seoul\u2019s map and change the district names. It was convenient and I felt good about myself. If one just drew up an imaginary map, the readers wouldn\u2019t even be interested in it. I did that when I was in middle school, but there was no one who was even remotely interested in it. That was when it hit me.These maps of imaginary worlds were for the writer and not the readers. The reason Gardium seemed like Seoul was entirely because of my needs.The Temple was in Gwanak and the Imperial Palace in Jongno.The place I got teleported to was the Al Ligar District. Later it would be changed to Artorius District in honor of the hero. They would build a huge statue of him as well.Where was this Al Ligar District and later Artorius District located, you ask?This was\u00a0Yongsan.Of course, it was just the topography and division that were similar, the buildings were completely different, so this was just like a neighborhood I never went to before.I arrived in Yongsan, so I headed towards the shopping district, which was about where the\u00a0Yongsan Electronics Market\u00a0was.Even though this was an imaginary place, maybe because it was that kind of region.\u201cWhat kind of crappy scrolls are these? Dude, where did you get this stuff?\u201dAs if proving that this was Yongsan, I encountered a gangster like bastard in my first try.* * *At the shop owner\u2019s first words, I went back out to the streets thinking that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do some immediate business with that owner, which I had already engraved as a gangster\u00a0 in my memory. He muttered something, but I didn\u2019t even listen to what he was saying.Every building around this area was a shop. Thousands of people were passing by, looking at things. Were all these people adventurers?How was being an adventurer lucrative? Was there some kind of way to earn money that I wasn\u2019t aware of? Actually, it had to be like thatt, otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be so many of them.It felt strange. As if someone filled my plot holes for me.Noise came from every corner of this place.\u201cOh, young adventurer! I just opened up! Hey, since it\u2019s this store\u2019s opening, I\u2019ll sell to you at half the price, how about it?\u201d\u201cOh, so ya looked and touched all these things, but you\u2019re not gonna buy anythin?

Don\u2019t make me angry.\u201d...No.What\u2019s with this?Why did it really turn into Yongsan?What unfolded before me was the medieval version of Yongsan.\u201cWas everyone like this?\u201dI felt like prey.\u201cOh, well, erm. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll just look for some other place\u2026.\u201dI tried my best not to get devoured.\u2013 Hey, don\u2019t make eye contact. Don\u2019t meet their eyes. There are some crazy bastards who won\u2019t even buy stuff and just unpack it and take it.\u2013 They\u2019re all retired adventurers, so they\u2019re good at fighting. If you pick a fight, you\u2019ll get one of your arms or legs broken.Even the people who knew what this place was, came in groups.Just when I was imagining Yongsan, what spread out in front of me was really the Yongsan I had in my mind.And here I was, a 17-year-old push over that tried to sell magic scrolls from the Demon Realm to people who were even worse.Yongsan.Just that one word made me feel like it was an impossible endeavour.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12As I found out later, the Al Ligar district\u2019s shopping district was notorious among adventurers. It was a place filled with unscrupulous merchants who nearly forced people to buy things, never refunded and charged them several tens of times of the market price.Nevertheless, it was the largest shopping district in the Imperial Capital and most items necessary for adventurers could only be purchased there, so it was a notorious place that, alas, couldn\u2019t be avoided.Well, it was the same as the old Yongsan Electronics Market. Just a fantasy version of it.It was a place novice adventurers were more scared of than dungeons. A place where it was common for people who wanted to start out as adventurers to give up on these thoughts.The victims were mostly just teenaged novice adventurers who came here with their saved up pocket money.Was it PTSD? I felt my whole body shaking.That bastard who sold me MP3s. Are you doing well, I wonder?You have to live a good life. If you just continue to live such a bad life, wouldn\u2019t that be sad, huh? Wouldn\u2019t it?Let\u2019s calm down.Among these many gangsters, I had to find a proper magic tool shop to sell these scrolls to. No, well, at first that felt easy enough, but it seemed like the difficulty just rose absurdly high suddenly.Somehow it felt impossible to do.Just by knowing the fact that this was Yongsan.There were many shops such as weapon shops, armor shops, tool shops, etc. however, I was looking for a magic tool shop. A magic tool shop was basically a place where a lot of money changed their owners pretty quickly, different from these other shops.\u201cWhat do you want? Don\u2019t touch anything and get out.\u201dI couldn\u2019t even enter most of the shops because the owners were afraid I might touch a scroll and activate it. I also didn\u2019t look like an adventurer.The first store owner was actually rather kind as he let me in.Even though there were some who strangely let me come in, their reactions weren\u2019t that good.The merchant looked at the scroll that I said I was going to sell and frowned.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this? Were you gonna sell these for money? Look at that brat. Don\u2019t make a fuss and get out. Well, I can give ya two bronze coins for these.\u201dWhat?Did all the gangsters collude or something? How could they slap me in the face like this? I wasn\u2019t sure about 2 gold coins, but you wouldn\u2019t even give me 1? Didn\u2019t that guy have at least that much conscience left in him?I didn\u2019t say anything, grabbed my scrolls and left. They were just a bunch of crooks not worth talking to.However, the response from the next shop was also poor.\u201cHaha, what\u2019s this? It\u2019s my first time seeing someone trying to scam me like this. Ah, what bad luck. Get out of here, bastard!\u201dThere were some who kicked me out as soon as they saw the scrolls.After getting turned down like this three times in a row, I realized that something was odd.What did they mean, scam?The next store treated me the same. I got sent off two consecutive times with the words \u201cWhat\u2019s with this nonsense?!\u201d.\u201cWhat the hell do you think of people doing business here, huh? Do you think we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference?!\u201d..\u201cDon\u2019t just doodle these weird things and actually learn how to draw.\u201dIt was a rather friendly reply, but I still got turned down.They looked at me as if I was some madman trying some weird scam by selling fake scrolls.This bizarre situation was going on instead of the good and bad outcomes I was expecting. Everything that the Writer\u2019s Advice hinted at went wrong.Were they thinking that the scrolls I took out weren\u2019t the real deal just because I looked young? Did they think these were fakes that just looked kind of similar?I had to show them that they actually worked, but if I activated a scroll I\u2019d just waste it. I couldn\u2019t blow my capital like that. If I showed them and then asked for money afterwards, I\u2019m pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t give it to me.The next place I went to was more out-of-the-way.\u201cHo-oh\u2026.\u201dThe shop owner glanced at the scroll and his eyes lit up. I thought he was someone who could finally recognize these scrolls\u2019 true value without being prejudiced.To be honest, I was exhausted, so I just wanted to finally sell them even if he ripped me off badly. The man suddenly fumbled through his drawers and pulled out a scroll.\u201cHey, you shouldn\u2019t draw this, try doing these, these and these.\u201dHe did recognize the value.\u201cIf you can draw the same thing, I\u2019ll give you five silver coins each. How about it?\u201dThe only problem was that he saw value in me and not in the scrolls.It seemed like that guy was misunderstanding something greatly, trying to make me mass-produce fake scrolls to sell.I was almost flabbergasted by this devilish idea that transcended dimensions.The owner kept on raising the remuneration even though I didn\u2019t do anything, and in the end, he offered me 1 gold coin per sheet.I had never seen such a vicious bastard before.\u201cOh, come on! Fine! Let\u2019s go 50/50! Okay? But you\u2019ll have to rake in lots of money for me, got that? So young and already so ferocious\u2026\u2026 Huh.\u201dIt was tempting, but I wasn\u2019t the one who drew these so I really couldn\u2019t do it. However, I did feel in awe, seeing the eyes of that man coveting talent that I didn\u2019t have.He was such a crook that I almost genuinely wanted to punish him. No, well, scrolls were supposed to be used in emergencies. If the scroll turned out to be fake, that person trying to use it would most likely die, right?You were playing with people\u2019s lives here, you know? He was the top bastard among these petty thugs.I ended up sighing and nodded my head.\u201cSure, can I bring you the finished products tomorrow?\u201dJust looking at these complex shapes, it was probably impossible for me to replicate them here.\u201cO, ooh! Yes, yes! Can you bring it in tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI might have to stay up all night.\u201d\u201cOh, good! Yeah! I\u2019ll give you the money as soon as I get it! The profit\u2019s 50/50, so if they get sold, we\u2019ll split the profits! You know there\u2019s no business like this, right, buddy?\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t tell me even if you sold one, you bastard.I left the shop with the scroll the merchant handed to me.\u2013 You\u2019re going to make me a fortune!Hearing the sounds coming from behind me made me involuntarily sigh.What\u2019s with this?Was that guy\u2019s head only filled with greed? Was he the type of person that couldn\u2019t see clearly ahead of him because of his own greed?Anyway.I got a Fireball Scroll for free.* * *I came to sell a scroll and saw the extraordinary profit of earning one scroll. Fireball was an attack spell, and unlike other novels who treated this spell as one of the basics, Fireball was quite a powerful spell in this world.Why was a spell that created an explosion right in front of you only a basic spell?I was a stubborn bastard, that insistent on not caring about historical facts.However, these things bothered me.Honestly though, I didn\u2019t think that much about it.Could anyone just carry a fireball scroll or something? Shouldn\u2019t it be banned by law? Well, wasn\u2019t this like selling rocket launchers like RPG-7s on the street? Weren\u2019t these just fantasy versions of dynamite?Medieval Fantasies were just dreamlands for terrorists.I should have put various restrictions on magic scroll trading when I was writing about this. Back then I had no reason to worry about these laws and regulations, but now that I had to live here, I felt they were much too lax.Of course, I didn\u2019t create an entire set of laws for the Gardias Empire when I was describing it. However Imperial Laws should exist and it\u2019s obviously going to be a huge amount.It\u2019s not like the parts I haven\u2019t described didn\u2019t exist, however this environment where anyone could just use magic scrolls certainly didn\u2019t seem safe to me.This was dangerous\u2026.People seemed to think my scrolls were fake. I had no idea if they thought that because I was just some kid who didn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d be able to get his hands on scrolls at all or if there was some other reason.I walked endlessly and finally found another magic tool shop on this street filled with gangsters. Maybe I should check and see if there was just a problem with my wares.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 Are you a customer?\u201dThere was a disheveled person who seemed to have slept on the table, raising her head in this scroll shop filled with the smell of paper and ink.She looked drowsy, not at all willing to do business.\u201cI\u2019m here to sell magic scrolls.\u201d\u201cHuh? Sell scrolls? You?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI took out the Fireball scroll and put it in front of her. The merchant woman unfolded the scroll and glanced over it, frowned and then hit my head.-Bang!\u201cArgh! Why are you hitting me?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for a kid to carry things like these.\u201dThe woman frowned and shook her head as if she couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cI usually don\u2019t buy stuff like this, but I\u2019d rather buy it off of you, so that you can\u2019t carry this around with you anymore.\u201dShe said something like \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped so I\u2019ll take it off of you\u201d. What a gangster-like expression.\u201c4 gold. It\u2019s useless even if you don\u2019t want to sell it for that. I won\u2019t return it to you.\u201dI got my hands on a lot more money than I planned on getting.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask where you got this from, but if you\u2019re caught carrying these things around, you\u2019ll get scolded. You got that? I\u2019ll remember your face.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t a gangster who made hard sales but one that forcibly bought things.It was at that moment that I changed her name from gangster to kind beautiful shop owner inside my mind.No, actually, scratch that. It should be Great Beauty.Anyway, I sighed heavily.\u201cTch, kids really don\u2019t know how to be afraid of magic.\u201dIt looked like she really bought it because this was something dangerous. Whatever, I got my money.\u201cThank you.\u201dI bowed my head and tried to leave the shop. I had to buy some things with these. I had to be careful not to let it get stolen or to get ripped off. I also had a lot on my mind.\u201cWait.\u201dThe owner called out to me.\u201cYou, come here.\u201dWith a very languid expression on her face, she told me to come to her, then she came out from behind the counter and approached me.\u201cWhy are you wearing a scroll book? Take them all out.\u201dIt felt like I got caught red handed.\u201cUh, I. There\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like she\u2019d take it all away, if I had any more dangerous magic scrolls. She dragged me to a chair and took away my scroll book.\u201cYou picked something up someone lost, didn\u2019t you? You didn\u2019t even try to return it to the owner and thought about selling it, huh? You brat. You must be mad.\u201dShe clicked her tongue while saying \u201cWhat are kids doing these days?\u201d. She seemed convinced that there was absolutely no way that I actually got these on my own. Well, the source was actually pretty questionable.She pulled out a scroll, unfolded it, looked at it and frowned.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201dShe seemed puzzled, then she went to her counter and unfolded the Fireball Scroll I gave to her.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s true.\u201dIt was at that moment, I realized that there must have been a good reason as to why so many merchants thought I was trying to trick and scam them.The merchant unfolded my scrolls one by one, and gradually became speechless.She sat next to me and gently wrapped her arms around my shoulders.\u201cBaby.\u201dNo.No matter how young I was, I absolutely wasn\u2019t like a baby.The woman\u2019s voice was endlessly sweet.\u201c..\u2026\u2026Ye, yes?\u201d\u201cYou have to be honest, okay?\u201dAlso, she bore a sense of ingenuity that seemed to want to peer inside of me.\u201cWhere did you get all these scrolls?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThis is the magic construction method used by demons. Why do you have these?\u201dA Writer\u2019s Advice usually led to both good and bad outcomes.I could definitely see now what they meant with that.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13There was magic.That\u2019s as far as my set up went, so of course I didn\u2019t know \u2018How\u2019 it worked. It wasn\u2019t my role to know how magic worked or how it manifested.How did magic work, what were the magic formula and what was mana\u2026?Who the hell would want to read up on that bullshit in a fantasy novel?To begin with, what\u2019s even the difference between explaining how magic worked or how there was a black flame dragon sleeping in ones right arm? It was just a setup.If one got that, than one could also just move on. Even if you don\u2019t mention all the details of some old, dusty martial technique vault in martial arts novels, the reader would understand what was going on just by reading the line. In other words, that was what one called shared common sense.However, there was a principle and way that overthrew said common sense.The magic system of demons and humans were different. They used the same kind of magic, but in different ways. They were like how steam locomotives and modern trains ran on the same kind of track.Therefore, a scroll inscribed with demonic magic was capable of ultra-long distance teleportation, while a scroll containing human magic wasn\u2019t.It was impossible for me to distinguish between human and demonic magic just by looking at the formula. It was a mistake that stemmed from my ignorance and lack of understanding of just what I was trying to do here.The other merchants couldn\u2019t recognize the magic formulas of demons, probably because they weren\u2019t wizards, so they thought the scrolls were fake. However, this woman who was both the magic tool shop owner and probably a wizard recognized that my scrolls were working with a different systems.\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me? Please?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what that woman would do to me.Could I somehow get through this situation using my achievement points?I had to make this woman think that my scrolls were insignificant.[To trigger this event 3000 achievement points are required.]Again, I needed more points than I actually had. I mean, it was highly unlikely to find demonic scrolls in the middle of the Imperial Capital after all, so that would seriously undermine probability.In the end, I had no other choice but to open my mouth.\u201cTha, that\u2026. Erm\u2026. A, at the\u2026 At the Demon King\u2019s\u2026 Castle\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dI had no other choice but to tell her the truth.\u201cI bought them from the Demon King\u2019s Castle\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe woman frowned after hearing my words.\u201cWhat do you mean? You brought these scrolls from the Demon King\u2019s Castle?\u201dThe woman furrowed her eyebrows as if she couldn\u2019t make sense of my words. However, these demonic scrolls made what I said believable apparently.I recounted the whole story to her. The long story of how I ended up being imprisoned together with the princess in the Demon King\u2019s Castle and how we used teleportation scrolls to escape from there. Then I told her that, after arriving at the Capital, I found myself all alone with no money and somehow had to find a place to live, so I tired selling these scrolls.I even added that I didn\u2019t know who I was because I lost my memory.\u201cOh, my god\u2026. This is so absurd\u2026\u2026 Do you want me to believe that? The princess has been rescued?\u201dDumbfounded she furrowed her brows even more. She looked into my eyes and sighed.\u201cYou\u2019re lying. If you actually rescued the princess, you\u2019d be given a noble title or whatever. Why are you alone, huh?\u201dThat was natural. The price for saving the princess\u2019 life was beyond imagination. To the extent that it would seem absurd to just reject it and wander around alone.The only logical explanation would be that I didn\u2019t save her, of course.However, I was a master of \u2018additional settings\u2019, that is, finding excuses.These settings were actually like that so as to avoid a setting error I\u2019d just rearrange some words.That\u2019s what it meant to be a specialist in making excuses!\u201cThat\u2026. When we escaped, a lot of Duke Salerian\u2019s Knights died. I might get rewarded, but I thought Prince Bertus was going to try and kill me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u2026 Retaliation\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 I guess, that makes sense\u2026\u2026 It would probably be difficult for the princess to protect you\u2026\u2026 Obviously\u2026\u2026\u201dI was able to make use of the excuse I planned on giving the princess if she happened to stumble upon me in a completely different place by any chance. A reward would be good, but it was, of course, not as precious as my own life.Of course, this was just an excuse, albeit an understandable one. I also hoped for Dyrus\u2019 safety. I was sure they\u2019d plan to retaliate against him as well.She stared at me.\u201cYour story is too elaborate to be made up on the spot.\u201dIt seemed like her last doubts had been solved.She seemed to believe my story. With such a ridiculous thing in her hands it seemed like she had no other choice but to believe my exciting story.She sighed again.\u201cSo, that means, the Demon King\u2026\u2026 is dead\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA strange light flashed in her eyes at my words. She seemed relieved, but I couldn\u2019t determine if it was sorrow or joy she actually felt. She had been silent for a long time. Eventually, she looked at me with sad eyes.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a relief. How hard it must have been for the young princess\u2026 How hard it must have been for you.\u201dShe wrapped her arms around me and patted me on the back as if pitying me.No, well, I wasn\u2019t actually tortured.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t actually remember any of that\u2026. So it\u2019s okay.\u201dLet\u2019s moderately circumvent this situation.\u201cYes, I\u2019m glad that you don\u2019t have to suffer from such a bad memory. Thank God.\u201dShe kept patting me on the back, telling me that it would be better to live without these memories and that it would be too painful to remember them. What, why was she being so kind to me? By the way, I was pretty hungry and had some things to sort out mentally, so I kind of wanted to leave, you know?\u201cLet me look at you for a second, kid. Still\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere were definitely a lot of people who had memory problems after suffering sever torture, but you were trapped in a terrifying place such as the Demon King\u2019s Castle. Right?\u201dNo, it was originally my home sweet home, but the problem was that the hero\u2019s party just decided to pay us a visit.\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a curse on your body. So I\u2026.\u201dShe looked at me with warm eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll try to cast a simple spell on you. If you lost your memory because of a curse, your memory might return, but this spell can\u2019t remove curses that are too strong\u2026.\u201dShe formed a sign.\u201cUh, hey, wait a minute!\u201d\u201cDispel.\u201dThe spell had already been cast.\u201c\u2026\u2026.?\u201dShe looked at me as if she had no idea what\u2019s going on. Horns, and a skin color that was slightly different from a humans.It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know what that meant. She just couldn\u2019t accept it.\u201cOh.\u201dA Writer\u2019s Advice.From now on I shall call it a son of a bitch.\u201cYo\u2026. Your Highness\u2026?\u201dHowever, the words that came out of her mouth completely changed my mind.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Your Highness.Naturally I knew that\u2019s what one usually calls a prince.But why was there someone who recognized me in such a random place?Of course, I knew what that meant. It was just hard to accept. The shop owner immediately knelt down in front of me.\u201cI, I\u2026. I, Eleris of the Demon Army\u2019s Gardium Invasion team, greets His Highness the Prince.\u201d\u201cU, uh\u2026.\u201dWas this good? This was a good thing, right? My mind was working on overdrive trying to interpret this situation and how I should treat this woman in front of me, who definitely was a Demon.At least this wasn\u2019t a dangerous situation, right?\u201cI believe, it would be better if you came this way first.\u201dShe alternated looking at me and the store\u2019s entrance, then led me into the warehouse behind her. If a customer came in while we stood in front of the entrance like that, they\u2019d immediately discover that this store housed demons.She cast a spell and soon there was a subtle change to her appearance.\u201cHey, don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201dTwo fangs slightly peeked out from between her red lips.Red eyes and pale skin.I seemed to know what she was.\u201cA, a vampire\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m Eleris Tuesday from the House of Seven Nights.\u201dWhat the hell kind of chuuni setting is the House of Seven Nights? I never wrote anything about those kind of things. Anyway, the other party seemed concerned about me. She carefully put a hand to my face, while I was still dumbfounded.\u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026 Have you really lost your memory\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, uhm\u2026 Oh, I guess\u2026 I don\u2019t remember much. Except for the fact that I was the Prince of the Demon Realm\u2026.\u201dI had no other choice but to be honest, as I thought it would be a hundred times better to just be honest than fake having memories I don\u2019t have.There was a strange light in her eyes again. I had no idea what kinds of emotions she felt.\u201cTo leave the castle and come all the way here all on your own in such a situation\u2026.\u201dShe held my hand carefully, looking like she was about to cry.\u201cWhat a stroke of luck. I don\u2019t know how this came to be, but I feel like I have to give my thanks to the Gods.\u201dThe vampire seemed to think that this was just an absurd coincidence, to the extent that she felt grateful towards God.However, when I thought that this situation came to be because of the Writer\u2019s Advice, it would probably be more fitting to thank the devil. It was a ridiculous coincidence for Eleris, however to me it was an inevitability.Go to the magic tool shop.Eleris might have recognized the demonic scroll because she was a wizard, but it was highly likely that she did because she was a Demon herself.So, going to the magic tool shop to sell scrolls was just a disguise, there were actually hidden intentions behind this advice.The message hidden in it was to find a demon spy who infiltrated Gardium and ask for help.However, if I had been caught by a human wizard who happened to recognized that the scrolls were made by demons, I might have been in a tougher position. The outcome could have been rather dangerous, but in the end I really did meet a Demon spy.After a moment.Come to think of it, the Vague Advice hinted to something similar in the end.[A Writer\u2019s Vague Advice][How could so many people have gotten kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle?]Not \u2018Why\u2019 but \u2018How\u2019.I wrote that those people were kidnapped by spies from the Demon Realm who had infiltrated the Human Realm. The vague advice was a subtle message for me to find the spies, since they would still be in the Human Realm. However, I didn\u2019t even think of that, because I was completely lost and hungry.If I had understood the vague advice, I would have gotten a clue that I had to entrust myself to a demon spy in Gardium. If I had moved carefully, it would have been absolutely safe.The Writer\u2019s Clear Advice was quite risky but intuitive and the Writer\u2019s Vague Advice tried to hint at what I should be doing.Vague Advice was relatively safe and Clear Advice presented some risks.\u201cErm\u2026. Could there have been a human wizard capable of recognizing scrolls of the Demon Realm?\u201dI spoke informally, however Eleris didn\u2019t seem to mind it.\u201cThere are some weridos who study even the magic of demons. I\u2019m glad you came to me before you met any of them.\u201dA chill ran down my spine at the thought what a disaster it would have been if anyone actually recognized these scrolls before I met Eleris. I could have seriously gotten myself killed.She went back outside into her shop again, locked its door and took me upstairs.\u201cI shall do my best to serve you from now on.\u201dSaying so, she sat me down on a sofa.Soon, she began to tidy up her messy room.Wait, she was a vampire.So, why was this room so well lit? It wasn\u2019t a huge apartment, but wasn\u2019t there a lot of sunlight getting in?\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this kind of dangerous for Vampires?\u201dShe looked at me and nodded.\u201cI\u2019m a Vampire Lord. I can handle this level of light. Of course, it isn\u2019t good for my body though.\u201dNo, I could see you flinch a little every time light hit you while you were straightening out the table cloth. Were you really okay?\u201cThis was an annex to the store, so I don\u2019t have to pay rent. I also would have wanted to live in a dream like residential area like a semi-basement where the sun doesn\u2019t shine all year round, but the budget for my actions are rather tight\u2026.\u201d\u2026How sad.I didn\u2019t exactly know what a Vampire Lord was, but wasn\u2019t this just too sad for a high-ranking vampire?I did understand that such an environment would be dreamlike for a vampire, but just hearing her say that she desired to live in a semi-basement was just too sad. A Vampire was worried about rent\u2026.\u201cUh, wouldn\u2019t it be fine if you just made the landlord your kin?\u201dCome to think of it, wouldn\u2019t it be very easy for a vampire to get rich? Wasn\u2019t that common sense?\u201cI had a similar idea, but to create a kin, I would have to take on too many risks. It\u2019s not easy to create a kin while disguised as an ordinary person.\u201dEleris certainly was a strong vampire, but that didn\u2019t mean the ones she created would be just as strong. It was obvious that a normal man who suddenly avoided the sun and stopped eating would be considered suspicious.No.Wasn\u2019t it actually quite difficult for Vampires, who were the Nobles of the Night, to blend in with human society?After cleaning up moderately, Eleris looked at me.\u201cYou must be hungry. Let me prepare some food.\u201d\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026.\u201dDon\u2019t Vampires drink blood? Do you even have any normal ingredients here?As if aware of my concerns, Eleris put on a hooded robe.\u201cI\u2019ll be out for little while.\u201d\u201cN, no. Will you be fine?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be alright.\u201dJust because of me, this vampire went grocery shopping in broad daylight. I was dumbfounded at how easily she just said that.Thank you so much and I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m so ignorant and helpless!After she quickly bought something to eat for me she looked so exhausted. I was close to tears.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14The Demons I saw at the Demon King\u2019s Castle ran rampant to save me. They seemed to recognize me even though I cast Camouflage on myself.However, Eleris, who was also a demon, didn\u2019t recognize me, before my real appearance was revealed.What was the reason for that? I pondered while Eleris was away, but I didn\u2019t come to an answer.My ability to control demons was incomplete. That was the only guess I could make.What Eleris bought were sandwiches and milk. She apologized to me for not having much to offer.\u201cI don\u2019t have that much leeway\u2026. I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness.\u201dAs I ate gratefully, I tilted my head at the sudden thought I had.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you just buy a Fireball Scroll for 4 gold?\u201d\u201cOh. Tha, that was\u2026.\u201dShe told me that it was too dangerous for a kid like me to walk around carrying something like that and just threw a huge chunk of money at me.\u201cI just thought it would be dangerous for a child to carry something like this\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness.\u201dFor a spy she was pretty sympathetic and compassionate. Was it fine to be so good-natured as a vampire? Was that how you spent all your money?I took out the 4 gold coins I had stored and put them on the table.\u201cI don\u2019t think I could spend so much anyway, so I\u2019ll return it to you.\u201d\u201cOh, that, that\u2019s\u2026. Thanks.\u201dAnyway, I got a guardian who happened to be a high-ranking vampire now, so having all that money would seem pretty meaningless.She was watching me eat with a sad expression on her face. What\u2019s good is good. Because of her good natured personality, I gained a vampire protector. She could help me out in emergencies.And.That awkward mood still lingered.There were some unknown emotions swiping over Eleris face when I told her that the Demon King was dead.It clearly wasn\u2019t anger at the loss of her master. It felt like relief.Although I continued to eat casually, I didn\u2019t stop thinking.Eleris seemed happy that the Demon King died and about the fact that the Demon World War ended in the human\u2019s victory.So was this vampire a pacifist or something while still being a spy?Or maybe she was influenced by the humans because she lived in Gardium for too long. Either way, this vampire was the kind of person who couldn\u2019t even overlook a young boy like me carrying around a fireball scroll, even though she didn\u2019t even know who I was.And the emotions she showed while I was talking about the princess also felt like genuine sympathy and compassion.She said, that she must have gone through so much hardship while still being so young.This vampire hated war and felt joyous about its end.I still didn\u2019t know if she was happy about the war\u2019s end or the human\u2019s victory though.She\u2019s taking care of me for now, but her loyalty towards the Demon King had disappeared a long time ago.So what was the surviving Demon Prince to those who hate war?Wouldn\u2019t he just be like the embers of a new war? Than it was obvious what her best choice would be if she wanted to avoid another war.I see.Beneath the hem of her robe, Eleris\u2019 fingertips were trembling violently.Maybe she just felt weak because of her exposure to the sun, but maybe she actually just made up her mind on something, but was too afraid to go through with it?Fear of having to completely end the Demon World, her hometown, with her own hands.Disgust towards herself who was trying to kill the young and helpless me to prevent any more war from happening.I wonder if she was really thinking like that or if this was just my imagination.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cUh, ah\u2026. Yes.\u201d\u201cHave you really, really\u2026. Lost your memories, all of them?\u201dWhen Eleris asked me this with a trembling voice, I was almost certain of what she was trying to do.\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t remember anything but who I was. I don\u2019t even know why this happened and I believe I definitely wasn\u2019t cursed or possessed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, whatever. Not that searching for my memories would change anything.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if these words would reassure her or not.\u201cI\u2019ve only gone through it for one day, but war sure is crazy.\u201dAt these words, an indescribable joy flashed across Eleris\u2019 face.\u201cThe, then, ah, no! You are the master of the Demon Realm and the hope of all demons! You must have a strong heart and rebuild the Demon Realm and raise it up again\u2026!\u201dShe was trying really hard to say things she didn\u2019t mean or stood behind.\u201cThe Demon Realm has already fallen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI neither intend to be the king of a country that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dLet\u2019s drive it home.\u201cNor should you act like the subject of a country that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt these words, tears fell from the vampire\u2019s eyes.She proved her innocence by crying.There was a time when novels like that dominated my childhood.But vampires were able to cry in this world, huh?After saying, that she was sorry for her behavior, Eleris went down to the first floor and didn\u2019t come up for a while. It didn\u2019t seem like what I said had any negative impact on her.* * *That night.I lay in bed. Eleris said she\u2019d watch over me, so she sat down on a chair by my bed, looking out the window from where some moonlight was pouring in.It was said that Vampires were the nobles of the night.She was really pretty.I was looking at Eleris, who shone paley in the moonlight.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\u201c.\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t call you anything else.\u201dEleris said so and kept talking without looking at me.\u201cYou should never tell anyone else what you told me today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to. If I were to say these things, I\u2019d reveal that I\u2019m a demon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dThat\u2019s not why, Eleris said powerfully.\u201cExcluding me, there are two other infiltrators that have infiltrated Gardium.\u201dYes.That\u2019s exactly what I expected, because she told me it was an Infiltration group.\u201cYou will inevitably get to know the other two as well. It would be unacceptable for them if Your Highness continued hiding away from the world.\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cCount Argon Pontheus. And then there\u2019s the one known as Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.\u201d\u201cOne of them is a noble?\u201dWasn\u2019t that way more than a spy?\u201cYes. He was the one who directly carried out the abduction of the princess and the empress.\u201dWhen I heard that it was him who kidnapped the princess, I flinched. Naturally, the demons here must have carried out the abduction themselves.But it felt strange to think that the one who did it was someone like him and that he\u2019d definitely be someone loyal to the Demon Realm.I felt like I was faced with the uncomfortable truth that I was, after all, nothing more than her parents\u2019 enemy to Charlotte.\u201cCount Pontheus\u2019 real name is Sarkegaar. He\u2019s of the Dreadfiend race.\u201dFiends belonged to the demon tribe. Fiends were a sub-species of demons. But I didn\u2019t know what a Dreadfiend was.Why did I get sent into my novel, only to find mostly things I didn\u2019t know about?\u201d\u201cCould you elaborate?\u201d\u201cDreadfiends are basically demons who specialize in transformation magic, including counter magic. That\u2019s why he was able to fool the humans\u2019 eyes and penetrate into the aristocratic society, the heart of Gardias. He wasn\u2019t detected not because of the level of his transformation, but because he changed his race itself. You can think of them as being able to use abilities similar to Polymorph, one of the highest level magic spells, from birth.\u201dThere were many types of transformation magic. There was camouflage, which was a low-level magic spell. It was the one I used. Then there was the method of creating optical illusions with illusion magic, and the method of transforming for a short period.However, polymorph was a highest level spell that could change one\u2019s very body structure. This kind of magic couldn\u2019t be lifted by using Detection or Dispel.Dreadfiends could use abilities similar to that polymorph from birth. All this would have been much easier if I had turned into that kind of demon.\u201cHe\u2019s absolutely loyal to the Demon King. Not only would he go to war, he would be willing to sacrifice even his soul if it meant he could rebuild the Demon Realm.\u201dWeren\u2019t Fiends usually in the position of stealing souls? How loyal was he?\u201cSo if he came to know that I wasn\u2019t interested in rebuilding the Demon Realm\u2026 it\u2019d cause some real problems, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be to that level, but he\u2019d try to make Your Highness want to.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t kill me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the last Arcdemon. Without you, the Demon Realm cannot be rebuilt. So he will try to change your mind somehow.\u201dWere Arcdemons such an important race? Right now, I was just a kid who couldn\u2019t do anything on his own.\u201cWhat if I still don\u2019t change my mind, then what?\u201dEleris looked at me and smiled. Then she put her hand on my head. She had a low body temperature, but it felt good in its own way.\u201cEven if it means destroying everything you love, he will do it.\u201dI had just arrived in this world, but Sarkegaar would do everything except kill me to make me the next Demon King.\u201cFor now, please just go along with him. And it won\u2019t be too late to use your hand when you built up enough strength to overwhelm Sarkegaar.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Yes, well. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s also very competent. He\u2019ll be able to help Your Highness in a lot more ways than I\u2019m capable of.\u201dFirst of all, he was a spy, but he was also a noble. Sarkegaar is, after all, a loyalist. He wouldn\u2019t do anything that could cause me harm.Actually, the most dangerous person to me was Eleris before I told her I wasn\u2019t interested in war. It seemed like Eleris was trying to kill me, though she looked like she wouldn\u2019t want to do that anymore.\u201cWait, just out of curiosity, if I became the actual Demon King after going along with what he said, what would you do?\u201d\u201c..\u2026 I don\u2019t know about that.\u201dEleris sighed with a bitter smile.\u201cWhen that time comes, you\u2019ll have to choose between me or Sarkegaar.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dPerhaps killing me now would be\u00a0her best option to burn the roots of war, but Eleris didn\u2019t seem like she was able to do that.\u201cYou have to grow up to be good, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will try.\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe that I was hearing these things from a Vampire.\u201cSo what is that Irene\u2019s Wild Dog?\u201dWhat was with that creepy nickname? Irene\u2019s Wild Dog?\u00a0 Were they trying to seem cool? She scratched her cheek slightly.\u201cThey\u2026.. There are illegal gangs in Gardium committing crimes in various places\u2026\u2026 Something like that\u2026\u2026 Irene\u2019s Wild Dog is the head of one such gang.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026The demon sent as a spy became a gangster?\u201dWhat kind of dog was he supposed to be again?Eleris wore an awkward smile showing her dumbfoundedness.\u201cStrictly speaking, rather than being a gang\u2026 They are just some people that stuck together. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s inevitable for violence to occur because they are together.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Isn\u2019t that a gang?\u201d\u201cWhat should I call this\u2026.\u201dEleris seemed even more hesitant than when she was talking about Sarkegaar.\u201cThat\u2019s how one turns out if the only thing one\u2019s good at is fighting.\u201dWhatever it is, if the guy who\u2019s going to help me is the head of a big organization, what was the harm in that? Eleris sighed deeply and muttered openly.\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 a beggar.\u201d\u201c..\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThe gang members are usually selling candies or something to people walking along the Irene River\u2026. In fact, that\u2019s how they also earned our funds for our activity\u2026.\u201d\u2026Isn\u2019t this solicitng?So the guy who was sent to Garnium by the demons became the head of an organization. And that\u2019s also what they earned their activity funds? What kind of spy was that guy? Was this the medival version of the Beggars\u2019 Sect?Ah.Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.It wasn\u2019t just a chuuni name, but literally described them.They were the abandoned dogs found at the Han river!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15So they were selling gum to people taking a walk by the Han River, or rather the Irene river. I had never seen a nickname so accurate before.Eleris\u2018 lips were trembling, seeming like she also found this quite ridiculous just thinking about it.\u201cThey\u2019re a Lycanthrope.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026If my memory serves me right, isn\u2019t that the one who peridocally turned into a wolf monster?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dTo be honest, not even Eleris, who was a high-ranking vampire, didn\u2019t seem to be in the right condition to be a spy. Although she\u2019s able to walk under the sun, I could definitely see that she was having a hard time.But even so, Eleris was able to withstand sunlight.A Lycanthrope, who would lose their mind and become a monster as soon as the full moon hung in the sky, should act as a spy in the middle of Gardium? How come they hadn\u2019t been caught so far?Sarkegaar was the only one who was cut out to be a spy!\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that a bit disadvantageous for a spy?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. However, we only had few resources\u2026. It seemed like a dangerous mission so there were not many who volunteered, and\u2026.. We were in a hurry, so\u2026\u2026 Yeah.\u201dWere they the type of person who were pretty slow but fiercely loyal?It was infiltrating into the heart of enemy territory after all, so it was no wonder none of the demons stepped forward. However, that Lycanthrope volunteered.\u201cSo on the night of the full moon, it seems like they hide themselves in the sewers beside the Bronzegate Bridge.\u201dThe Bronzegate Bridge.Well.I did say that this place was practically the same as Seoul.If I remembered correctly, then the Brozegate Bridge should be the\u00a0Banpo Bridge.When the day of their transformation neared, they\u2019d go into the sewers under the Banpo Bridge to hide.\u201cLiving close to the Bronzegate Bridge was rather convenient, so they\u2019d rather not go too far from it\u2026. As a result, thier appearance also became quite \u2026 unkept\u2026 There were quite a few passersby who mistook them for a beggar and gave them money\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo that wasn\u2019t their original goal?\u201d\u201cYes. So, thinking what they were doing was right, they just sat there and kept begging.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dDidn\u2019t they have any dignity? Maybe it\u2019s because of the Emperor but the people here were pretty generous.They were a weirdo who I couldn\u2019t decide if they were living thier life comfortably or recklessly. Eleris hesitated and continued her explanation.\u201cAs a result, there were a lot of fights for that position, but as they were born a Lycanthrope while they themselves were a strong person with good fighting skills, it seems like there was no one who could match their fists\u2026. However, there were a lot of beggars there\u2026 so they would always have a drink with the person they fought against yesterday, and then\u2026 They just been hanging out with them and they go closer\u2026 There were just too many, so\u2026.\u201dHaha.They were begging near Banpo Bridge and got into a fight over the position, defeated that guy and the next day the guy who got beaten up came over with a bottle of soju, saying something like \u201cOh yeah, yeah. Yesterday was my bad, right?\u201d, and with this scenario repeating they made a lot of friends while drinking a glass or two. A rather big friend group.It grew to such proportions that it couldn\u2019t be maintained properly so it turned into an organization.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t really know them, but they seem to be like quite the person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026. We also receive a lot of help from them\u2026.\u201dEleris, who seemed to have no business skills at all, and Sarkegaar, who was sure to need a lot of money while living an aristocratic life.Neither of them seemed like they\u2019d be able to survive without the help of Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.\u201cHuh\u2026. But Irene\u2019s Wild Dog\u2026 That\u2019s quite the fitting name.\u201dThey could actually transform into one.\u201cThey actually wanted to be called Irene\u2019s Wolf, but I can understand why no one would want to call them that.\u201dThat was kind of sad.Anyway, that was quite good. I just can\u2019t let Sarkegaar know that I have given up on the Demon Realm and Irene\u2019s Wild Dog seemed like a complete weirdo, but they also seemed to have a sense of camaraderie. They did help the other two spies after all.Eleris didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions to cause me harm at the moment.\u201cSleep. Your Highness. I will arrange a place for you to meet them in the near future.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Don\u2019t you have to sleep as well?\u201dThis was probably Eleris\u2019 bed. She lay down next to me, saying she\u2019d go to sleep as well. No, isn\u2019t it actually kind of weird that a Vampire was sleeping at night\u2026?\u201cAre you okay? If it\u2019s uncomfortable for you, I could also sleep on the floor.\u201d\u201c.\u2026\u2026Uh, um. It\u2019s fine. Yeah.\u201dIt was fine, but at the same time it wasn\u2019t at all.This was a good outcome, but isn\u2019t it also kind of bad?No matter if I got a cheat or not, I wasn\u2019t happy with this in the least.This is life, huh.Cheat, fuck off. No one needs you.And when morning came.-Niaaarck!I woke up to a Vampire screaming at the touch of sun light instead of an alarm clock.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Waking up from that fuss, I stood up and saw Eleris with her hair all frizzy.\u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t you have blackout curtains or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2026. I sleep a lot\u2026. If I don\u2019t do this I wouldn\u2019t be able to get up\u2026.\u201dExplaining as such with a hoarse and cracked voice she went out of the sunlight. I knew that Eleris was a really unusual Vampire, but using the sun as an alarm clock, that wasn\u2019t something easy to imagine. If she couldn\u2019t wake up fast enough, wouldn\u2019t she die?A Vampire who lived in a sunny and well-ventilated place. I knew she was a high-level vampire who just got by, but this was just too sad.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you\u00a0get Count Pontheus to give you a spare room in his house to live in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inefficient for spies to work in the same area. If one gets caught, wouldn\u2019t the other go down as well?\u201dEleris sighed while she changed her clothes.\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t do this in front of me.I was still a 17 year old teenager!\u201cNo, but have you never felt that it was quite unfair that one of you gets to live as an aristocrat?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really like places with a lot of eyes on me. Rather, I think Sarkegaar is living a much harder life.\u201dAh.If one thought of it like that. Sarkegaar probably didn\u2019t have a single moment in which he could relax, right? While Eleris only had one enemy in this place. The sun.\u201cBut if you feel uncomfortable living like this, I think you\u2019d be better off staying in Sarkegaar\u2019s mansion. We don\u2019t even have enough supplies here to live a decent life.\u201dI really didn\u2019t want to say this but\u2026.\u201cBu, but I still want to continue living here\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect the day would come when I\u2019d throw such a childish tantrum again.No.I was sure that Sarkegaar already had his hands full even if I wasn\u2019t trying to mooch off of him.That wasn\u2019t necessarily the only reason.Uh.* * *Insects had different feeding systems for adults and larvae.For example, mosquito larvae lived in water and adult insects flew, so not only did they eat different things they had completely different ecologies. In that way, adult insects and larvae had completely unrelated prey, so they didn\u2019t compete for food with each other.So, right now I was feeling like an insect.It was because of Eleris, who watched me eating breakfast with a look devoid of any appetite. I was wondering if she just enjoyed watching me eat.I was thinking about useless things.\u201cI\u2019m just curious. Do you drink blood every few days?\u201d\u201cEhem\u2026. Well, once a week is enough.\u201d\u201cDoes it have to be human blood?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily, any lifeform with mana in their blood would do.\u00a0 I could use pigs or chickens as well. However, I would need a greater quantity of it. The blood of lower lifeforms contains relatively small amounts of mana.\u201dBlood was blood, but it had to be blood containing a lot of mana. The ones that had blood with a high concentration of mana would be humanoids.But once a week. That energy efficiency was no joke. They were higher life forms compared to humans to begin with. Put into human terms, that meant that one didn\u2019t have to eat for another week after having a bowl of\u00a0ox blood soup.Of course, the type of blood was important.\u201cBy the way, if one were bitten by a vampire, wouldn\u2019t that make one a vampire as well?\u201d\u201cIn the case of wild vampires, there were often such cases where they weren\u2019t able to control themselves, but I\u2019m not like that. As I said, I don\u2019t have a higher rank for nothing.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026. Will the person you suck blood out of die?\u201d\u201cPiling up corpses is never a good thing, you know? I only take enough for myself so they don\u2019t die. Because of that I had to turn a lot of subjects into vampires, but I\u2019m very good at magic. The condition can be controlled to the extent that it wouldn\u2019t impact their lives.\u201dAs expected, Eleris was a peaceful vampire. It seemed like such things as good demons existed, huh.\u201cThen you do it mostly at night\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be night for me to do it. I take it mostly from customers. Well, take it as a slight punishment for those that went out of line\u2026\u201dEleris smiled.When such customers came around, she would probably use some type of fascination magic and take blood from them, huh.\u2026\u2026It was pretty scary now that I thought about it.\u201cMr. Swinton from the store next door usually comes to mess around, so I get to eat deliciously every time. I\u2019m thankful to him. Of course, I can\u2019t do the things he wants me to do with him. He\u2019s married, you know?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. I, is that right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like men who lack fidelity.\u201dHim, being a human wasn\u2019t the problem, huh?It seemed like the nearby merchants had their blood sucked by Eleris without their knowledge. Additionally, they came to this beautiful vampire on their own two feet.She looked nice, but in the end she had a scary side to her.\u201cTalking with you, it seems like you haven\u2019t only lost your memory but a lot of your knowledge as well.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve heard that one usually only loses one\u2019s memory, but in the case of Your Highness\u2026.\u201dEleris tilted her head. She knew that I had amnesia, but it seemed like she felt weird because I lacked even basic common sense demons should have.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve become a completely different person\u2026\u2026 I can feel it.\u201dAh.Did she notice?But come to think of it, yeah.In most possession stories, the main character tries to never reveal that he was actually possessing the body.Why do I have to do that? Why could I not tell the truth? It\u2019s not like I did that on purpose.Rather, Eleris would probably feel relieved if I told her I was really a completely different person.Still.It\u2019s a bit risky to gamble with this before I reached some level of trust with her.\u201cWhat kind of person was I?\u201dSo I asked a question and didn\u2019t give her an answer. I was the master of excuses and spouting bullshit.If the person in charge asked me when I\u2019d sent in the manuscript I\u2019d answer with: \u201cWhy did that bastard ask me for a drink yesterday? If it wasn\u2019t for him, I would have already sent it, but phew, ah, I\u2019m getting pissed off suddenly.\u201dI would keep on sprouting this kind of nonsense.Eleris was about to answer my question, with her arms crossed.\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dThat attitude.A worrying attitude!I kind of got a feeling.That damn game system\u2026.\u201cYo, you\u2026. You weeere\u2026 A great prince. Yes, of course! An i, i, inspiration for all demons\u2026\u2026 You\u2019ve been a role model\u2026 Yes!\u201dWere you trying to spout bullshit just now?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: 16Looking at Eleris pale expression, I got a sense of what the former prince was like.Following this mixed up development, I figured that this guy was quite the jerk.\u201cBy any chance, did you ever have contact with me?\u201dCome to think of it, Eleris was able to recognize me right away. Of course, she might have seen me a few times, as a high-ranking vampire, but then Eleris muttered quietly.\u201cWell, I was your tutor\u2026. So I did.\u201d\u201c\u2026Were we pretty close then?\u201dWeren\u2019t we supposed to be on pretty friendly terms then?\u201cB, but it was only for a short time. My ability was too low to teach Your Highness properly \u2026.\u201dIt seemed like my personality was just too hard to bear with, so she either got fired or quit shortly after.\u201cWell, the past is the past. You have to life in the present, yes.\u201d\u201dEleris seemed to want me to stop being curious about my past. I\u2019m sure I was a total mess, but just to what extent?\u201cWait, so the other spies also know me personally?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026. Yes, definitely. But\u2026.\u201dEleris grabbed my shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re the last Arcdemon. They\u2019ll know what\u2019s important.\u201dWhat.That\u2019s scary.* * *The Demon King died.The Demon World War ended in the Coalition\u2019s victory.Unfortunately, the warriors also fell in battle after a fierce fight with the Demon King and the Four Heavenly Kings.And, the Princess returned safe and sound.Soon, the news was announced.The street was filled with cheering people. The fact that people didn\u2019t have to die in the war with the demons anymore and the survival of the First Princess who was thought to be dead.Not only the Imperial Capital, but the whole continent must have been filled with cheers.\u201cWow, this is good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re just very generous.\u201dEleris and I were walking down the street. I was just eating some chicken skewers that the overjoyed Stall owner said were for free.Now that Eleris cast some magic on me I just looked like an ordinary boy to others. Eleris herself also used camouflage magic on her body.The Victory of the Demon World War made the people of this Gangster filled neighborhood distribute things for free. Eleris didn\u2019t seem to understand how I, who lost everything in a single day, could enjoy some chicken skewers at my own nation\u2018s defeat party. She was glad that the war was over, but why didn\u2019t she look like it?\u201cIf you can\u2019t avoid it, enjoy it.\u201d\u201cAh, that, yes\u2026.\u201dRather, my tension was much higher.Well, it didn\u2019t really have anything to do with me whether the Demon Realm was destroyed or not, right?I was nothing more than a little kid protected by this beautiful vampire.I wanted to live peacefully until the end just like this. Being cared for by someone like Eleris was rather peaceful and comfortable.Of course, I knew best that this was almost impossible.\u201cAre they all there?\u201d\u201cYes, they are waiting for Your Highness.\u201dWe were moving to meet the other remaining demons in Gardium.-Long live the Empire!-Long live Her Highness the Princess!-Long live Artorius!Everyone drunk on the news of the victory, showed off their joy.\u201cHurray!\u201dI also shouted out a hurray, that\u2019s when Eleris finally pulled on my arm.\u201cYour Highness! Restrain yourself!\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s pretty fun!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u2026.\u201dIt was fun acting a bit immature.Of course, when I thought about my actual mental age, deadly humiliation engulfed me internally.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *There were certain things one could only find in the Imperial Capital.One of them is the mana train.So, a fantasy version of a train. They were implemented on a large scale by the Imperial Government, as they couldn\u2019t handle everyone\u2019s transportation needs with just warp gates, bridges and wagons inside the Capital.They were eco-friendly trains, which were powered by this convenient item called mana stone, a staple of the medieval fantasy genre.The comments I received about this were as followed:Isn\u2019t that just ridiculous? Isn\u2019t that much too convenient?I mean, I\u2019m not the only one who wrote about things like these. Lol. I did it anyway lol.If you could make a train, wouldn\u2019t you also be able to make a cellphone?Dunno lolWell, that train was actually moving right in front of my eyes now.The city division was similar to Seoul\u2019s, and, the route map, of course, also aligned with the Seoul subway route map. We had to head south of the Bronzegate Bridge and to do that we headed towards the station to catch a mana train.We first had to head to the station located in the Al Ligar district and take the train to Bronzegate.Simply put, it went from Yongsan Station to the Express Terminal and then to\u00a0Banpo Han River Park. It was so easy to convert. It would have been difficult for me to put my head around this if I came up with some strange map. If I did that, I would have made my life as a writer harder, not that of the readers. I should be able to write comfortably!I was so proud of my lazy former self. If I hadn\u2019t put in this convenient setting of mana stones, I would have had to take a carriage or walked there. That would have been pretty annoying. I didn\u2019t think of the places I put in the novel as these places, but as places in Seoul, that\u2019s how I\u2019d be able to know exactly where they were.In the moving train, Eleris murmured quietly engulfed her robes.\u201cHumans sure are incredible.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThey know how to make things like this.\u201dWere you actually praising me, because I made this basically, you know? Yeah, I\u2019m pretty good. I can\u2019t believe I made this with just a few lines. Maybe I\u2019m a god?In fact, I might have been this world\u2019s god. A stupid one that died of high blood pressure after reading some malicious comments.\u201cHow great would it have been if we created things like these with our excellent magical power instead of powerful destruction magic and war weapons.\u201dEleris murmured in a self-deprecating voice. Certainly, demons seemed to be superior to humans in terms of magic. However, the demons only used magic for destruction rather than for their daily lives.Therefore, even with their awesome power, the Demon Realm looked rather dull, not prosperous at all. There wasn\u2019t really a city around the Demon King\u2019s Castle. It was just a huge fortress that stood alone.However, there were a lot of people living in this human Capital.She might have seen many magical tools that helped them in their everyday lives and magic being used in ways that were beneficial to humans.Did Eleris constantly comparing the barren Demon Realm with this place, while living here?Maybe that was the reason why she felt that the Demon Realm was wrong and backwards.So that was why she ended up hoping for the humans\u2019 victory and not the demons\u2019.I seemed to know what she as thinking to a certain extent.A world where only weapons to kill enemies were made.A world where people were struggling with all their might to make themselves happy.Although Eleris rejoiced about the end of the war and the human\u2019s victory, she was just blankly staring at the joyful sights in front of her not being able to fully be happy about the fall of the Demon Realm.No matter what kind of place one\u2019s home was, even if one didn\u2019t want to go back to it, it would always feel sad having lost one\u2019s place to return to.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The riverside of Irene was well-maintained. The green grass was trimmed well and there were people walking about the well-paved promenade.For ordinary people who couldn\u2019t afford to travel far, the park built along the Irene River was the best picnic spot in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s a place that always lifts my mood when I come here.\u201dEleris wore a soft smile on her lips despite the strong sunlight. Maybe because she liked the scenery. It certainly seemed like Eleris could tolerate sunlight better than I would have assumed.\u201cYeah, it would be even better if this scenery wasn\u2019t right next to it.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. Yes\u2026.\u201dWoah\u2026. Waah\u2026.\u2013 Guweeeeeeek!\u2013 Hey, you bastard! Huh! That son of a bitch, are ya cheatin right now? How did so many 3s come out?! Huh?!-Who\u2019s cheatin? I\u2019ve been livin an honest life! If it\u2019s 3 then it\u2019s 3!Below the Brozegate Bridge.People don\u2019t even dare to go there.Because of the shade the bridge threw, this place was a lot darker and gloomier than other places.A group of beggars were drunk, vomiting, eating, drinking, playing dice and trembling all while the sun was still hanging high up in the sky. Some beggars approached some passers-bys if they got close enough to sell them candy.\u201cSo the cockroaches infesting this peaceful landscape are our allies and main source of income?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. That\u2019s right\u2026.\u201dWhy were you feeling ashamed, when it\u2019s these guys who should?I didn\u2019t even want to get close to them.\u201cHey, young lady, buy some candy from me.\u201dThen a beggar popped out from nowhere and crept towards us, shoving candy in our faces with his dirty hands. It looked like we were also their targets.Eleris sighed and accepted the candy. She didn\u2019t really want to say no.\u201cFive bronze coins.\u201dOne gold coin was 1 million won and one silver coin was 10000 won.A bronze coin was roughly 100 won.That was how I roughly converted them. So 500 won for a candy of that size wasn\u2019t cheap. But was candy even that common in this world? Weren\u2019t you able to obtain carbohydrates anywhere in modern society?However, there was a beggar selling candy. Anyway, let\u2019s just leave it at that. I\u2019ll lose, if I continue thinking about that.Eleris seemed to be contemplating if she should give me that candy she bought for 5 bronze coins, maybe thinking I wouldn\u2019t eat it.\u201cIt\u2019s too dirty for Your Highness to eat.\u201dAfter agonizing about it, Eleris shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m not so picky about these things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI wasn\u2019t particularly craving candy, but I wasn\u2019t such a fussy eater. However, Eleris looked at me slightly surprised as if she didn\u2019t expect me to say something like that. No, that jerk attribute of that former prince was quite something.Was that jerk born to be criticised or something?Will I end up receiving praise like: \u201cEven though you\u2019re breathing, why aren\u2019t you causing any trouble today?\u201d.To begin with, the restraint placed on my being reborn as this jerk actually had some merit. If I were reincarnated into some rising star of the century with tremendous abilities, that would be a huge advantage, but if one didn\u2019t work hard even for a single day they will be questioned saying things like one changed in a bad way.A bastard that gets complimented just by breathing vs. a genius that gets scolded just by breathing.The former was overwhelmingly good. Being reincarnated into a person who had already been perceived as negative throughout the world would be great for pretending to be weak.If I were the former prince would I have felt offended just by being approached by a beggar?\u201cThen would you like to eat it?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI peeled the wrapper off of the candy I got from Eleris and put it in my mouth. It just tasted sweet with no flavor.\u201cDid I like sweets?\u201d\u201cI remember you did.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI don\u2019t like sweets though.However, it seemed like being young had its advantages. The beggar who approached us was approaching others now. Most of the time, it felt more like people wanted to get rid of the beggar than honestly wanting to buy these candies.It was a disgusting sight, but I was told that that was how they funded their activities.No, I still didn\u2019t like looking at it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17There was a good reason behind why we chose this place to meet up.Count Pontheus had servants who had no idea that he was a demon, there were also influential people coming to his mansion, as he was a noble. Eleris\u2019 shop and it\u2019s second story were a little too small for the four of us.The base of Irene\u2019s wild dog was a place avoided by all and swarming with beggars. I was told there were also quite the number of secret spaces. Eleris passed through the mess of beggars affected by hallucination magic. Even while we were passing right by the beggars they didn\u2019t notice our presence.There was a dark tunnel right under the bridge. This place seemed to be their real base.I was told that it originally served as a type of drainage channel that would lead the city\u2019s rain water to Irene when it rained. As this place wasn\u2019t really visited by people, it also served as Irene\u2019s Wild Dog\u2019s hide out when they turn into a Lycanthrope.There were beggars lying around and sleeping inside. There were blankets, mops and roughly built shacks.It really was a beggar colony.As we went even deeper inside, eventually even the shacks disappeared from our sight. As we entered the endless sewers, we saw a small light in the distance.Someone was sitting in front of a lit bonfire. Even though they were just the leader of some beggars, they still were a king in a way, however, they didn\u2019t seem like they had anything special around him.They were just like a dog basking in the fire\u2019s warmth.There was a person wearing a ripped shirt and tattered trousers, with thick gray hair on their head tied in random ways.Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.\u201cYou\u2019re here, my lord.\u201dCome to think of it, I was never told that the dog was a man..* * *The King of Beggars.Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.The Leader of a Gang.\u201cLoyar greets His Highness the Prince.\u201dShe knelt down in front of me as soon as she saw me. That Wild Dog\u2019s real name was Loyar and as far as I knew she was a wolf-type Lycanthrope.\u201c\u2026Yes, nice to see you. Although it\u2019s in a place like this.\u201dWe were inside Gardium, but here we were meeting up in the sewers.\u201cIs Sarkegaar still over there?\u201dLoyar nodded at Eleris\u2019 words.\u201cAll the nobles must be busy. There\u2019s going to be a victory celebration and stuff. He\u2019ll be here soon, though. This is a lot more important to us.\u201dEleris was a pacifist, however she was still surprised that I was still alive, Loyar on the other hand didn\u2019t really have any big reaction. How should I put it, it felt like she didn\u2019t really care much about all this?\u201cLoyar, I\u2019m telling you in advance, but he lost all his memories. Except for who he was\u2026 He doesn\u2019t remember almost anything.\u201dAt those words, Loyar stared at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026For real?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah\u2026\u2026It somehow turned out like that.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dHer gaze was a bit uncomfortable.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d\u201c..\u2026You\u2019re happy about that?\u201d\u201cYeah, because you\u2019d tell me stuff like I should lie down with my stomach exposed, saying that dogs should behave like dogs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I, I did?\u201d\u201cYeah. You\u2019d even put me on a leash sometimes.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dLoyar opened her mouth as she thought about those times. Oh no, you\u2019re telling me I treated Lycanthropes like some sorts of pets? Eleris\u2019 mouth twitched as she was smiling half-heartedly.\u201cLo, Loyar\u2026. As far as I can remember, you kind of liked that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen did I ever?!\u201dLoyar\u2019s face turned red. What the hell were you talking about? Did I really treat a Lycanthrope who changes into a wolf every full moon as a common dog?Was she like my pet or something?\u201cTha, that\u2026.\u00a0 I can\u2019t really remember, but I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine.\u201dYour expression didn\u2019t look fine at all though. If I were in her shoes I would have really hated being treated like that.Come to think of it, I was told she volunteered for this spy mission even though she was a Lycanthrope.Could it be she was forced to volunteer to get away from me? Come to think of it, that was pretty plausible. I managed to somehow escape and come here alive, but could I trust her?\u201cWe, well\u2026. I can\u2019t erase my past actions, but I\u2019m\u2026. sorry. Let\u2019s try to get along from now on.\u201dI reached out my hand to her, showing her that I meant no harm.-Pat\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI meant to shake her hand.However, she just put her hand on mine. She didn\u2019t grasp it; she just put her hand on top of mine.\u201c!\u201dAs soon as she realized what she did, Loyar was startled and then lowered her hand to hold mine.Wasn\u2019t that\u2026\u2026Did she just do \u2018Give paw\u2019?\u201cGive paw.\u201d\u2013 PatThe moment I put out my palm, Loyar put her hand on my hand. She did it without realizing it and immediately pulled it back.\u201cY, your Highness\u2026. Why am I doing that?\u201dLoyar said so in cold sweat.The speechless Eleris also added some words.\u201cIt\u2019s like the body is reacting on its own without the head telling it to.\u201d\u201cO, oh, no!\u201d\u201cYour Highness. How about you try telling her to lie down and show you her stomach?\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cShe going to flip over. Try it.\u201d\u201cN, no! Why would I do that!\u201dI couldn\u2019t get myself to do that in the end. She\u2019d probably really do it.Why was she trained so well?How often did I bully you like this in the past? Rather, it was already on the level that her body reacted instinctively.I\u2019m afraid she\u2019d really sit if I tell her to sit.\u201cUhm, erm. Sorry, I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026.\u201dEven though her heart doesn\u2019t like me, her body was that of a loyal dog. Thinking that I put my worries about Loyar aside. I sat down besides the fire. When Sarkegaar arrived we could start talking about the details.I felt something approaching from afar. There was a sound echoing through the sewers.\u2013 Uooooooooaaaaah!I couldn\u2019t even see his face yet, but I was already convinced that he\u2019ll be the troublesome type.Just like I expected.When Sarkegaar arrived, he hugged me and began to wail loudly.\u2018Oh my goodness! For those wretched humaaaans to kill His Majesty the Great Demon King! They must have used some cowardly tricks! What are we going to do about this? What are we to doooo? But seeing that Your Highness is still safe, there\u2019s still a ray of hope left for the people of the Demon Realm. What a miracle! Wooaaaah! Please quickly grow up and rebuild the Demon Realm stronger than it was before and erase all traces of these filthy human beiiiiiings!\u2018..He roughly kept on mumbling and crying loudly for about 10 minutes.He started crying even louder when I told him that I had lost my memories. No, I thought I was some kind of super jerk? Why was he so sad?Ah.Seeing how he was acting right now, it seems like even the former prince, who was indeed a jerk, avoided him.His voice was so loud that it made the entire sewer tremble. It was so loud that Eleris was forced to cast noise suppression magic around us.\u201cKuhuk\u2026.Sniff\u2026. Buhuuhuk\u2026.\u201dEven I, who didn\u2019t think much about his crying before, was almost brought to tears. No, well, maybe I was the type that would start crying as well if I saw someone crying in front of me.No, that\u2019s also not it. This guy was crying so sadly.What\u2019s with this?Anyway, Sarkegaar was a loyalist almost to the point of insanity.Sarkegaar continued to sniffle for a while, making snorting noises. I felt like he was going to run out of breath, so I felt like I had to somehow comfort him.\u201cWhy\u2019s such a grown-up Fiend crying like that? Huh? It\u2019s like you lost your country.\u201dCome to think of it, we really lost our country. Looks like that idiom became reality now.Sakegaar looked up at me, at my words.\u201cI see! You\u2019re right! Demons are still alive, so the Demon Realm has yet to die as well! What disloyalty I committed! The Demon Realm is still alive and well! Please punish meeeeeee!\u201dThat guy twisted my words weirdly, making his own determination flare up even more.Loyar and Eleris were looking at me as if they were trying to apologize for being helpless in this situation.They seemed to be tired of Sarkegaar\u2019s antics as well. After barely calming him down, we all sat down around the bonfire.What a perfect meeting place for a prince and servants of a fallen kingdom. Sarkegaar was looking at me with a firm expression.\u201cYou must rebuild the Demon Realm.\u201dEleris stared at me. She seemed to want to remind me about our previous conversation about moderately playing along.\u201cAh, uhm\u2026. Well. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAnd to take revenge for the previous King, we have to build an even stronger and more powerful nation than ever before\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, you bastard! If you keep on sticking to these unfruitful rhetorics I\u2019ll rip out your tongue!\u201dLoyar shouted.Yes, even in novels, if a character keeps on talking about similar things, the author will get cursed out for inflating the length of the chapter. Sarkegaar also fake coughed as if preparing to continue on with the third verse.\u201cEhem. My apologies, Your Highness. It\u2019s just when I heard the news that His Majesty the Demon King had passed away, it seemed like the whole world was coming to an end \u2026.\u201d\u201cAlright. I got it.\u201dIt seemed like he was the type of person who\u2019d finish what he wanted to say no matter what.Hearing the news of the Demon Realm\u2019s defeat must have felt like the sky was collapsing above him. However, since I was still alive, I was his last hope, hence reigniting his fighting spirit.\u201cRebuilding the Demon Realm, huh. That\u2019s good and all, but there are only the four of us and I\u2019m still some useless, incompetent kid.\u201d\u201cCalling yourself as such is an unfair thing to say! Your Highness\u2019 bloodline is the most noble! You are the only Arcdemon left in this world!-\u201d\u201cYeah, so that\u2019s it.\u201dI cut off Sarkegaar\u2019s muffled words.\u201cJust what the hell is an Arcdemon?\u201dJust what was an Arcdemon, for them\u00a0 to not even think of finding a new Demon King and simply clung to me?I had no idea about that yet.Everyone was looking at me with puzzlement apparent on their faces.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: 18Chapter\u00a018e Demon King acted as an\u00a0emulsifier between water and oil.A being that made things that weren\u2019t able to mix together, mix together.\u201c\u2026Then there\u2019s one more question I have.\u201d\u201cYes. go ahead.\u201d\u201cWhy did the Demon World War happen?\u201dI just wrote down that there was a war, but not why the Demon World War happened. Humans tried to vanquish the demons. that\u2019s what I wrote. So this was supposed to be the first invasion from the human\u2019s side.Eleris looked into the bonfire, saying:\u201cThe humans have always been afraid of the unification of the Demon Realm.\u201dThe probability of the event that I hadn\u2019t properly set had been fixed. It was quite bizarre to experience my messed up probabilities getting fixed like that.Humans had invaded the Demon Realm.Since I didn\u2019t state the reason for it, the world supplemented the possibility that humans feared the Demon Realm\u2019s unification and the setting of the Arcdemons. I had that strange feeling of guilt creep up inside of me, as this felt like someone else filled the holes I created while messing around.The demons of the Darkland began to form a society. Even the humans, who had been fighting among themselves had no choice but to be alert of that situation.\u201cThe previous Demon Kings were aware of the fact that the humans would one day start to invade the Demon Realm. That\u2019s why the Demon Realm was continuously preparing for war.\u201dI nodded at Eleris words. Even if they don\u2019t intend to invade each other, if they see the other side increase their arms the other side would do the same.\u2018Don\u2019t get us wrong, we were just increasing our military to defend against a possible attack from you.\u2019Of course, no one would believe that bullshit.It was common for fights to happen because they feared each other.So, even though the Demon Realm and the Human Realm didn\u2019t have any intentions of attacking each other, they were preparing to attack each other, just because the other side existed.It didn\u2019t matter who started it. A war would eventually break out no matter what.The Demon Realm had the Demon King, but the Human Realm also had mighty forces, the Warriors. The warriors succeeded in taking down the Demon King with them.The death of the Demon King was on a completely different level than the death of a human king. So, the mere fact that the Demon King was dead would have completely destroyed the morale of many of the King\u2019s soldiers.In fact, the Demon King was comparable to a God in the Demon Realm.This explanation alone was enough for me to understand the importance of Arcdemons.\u201cYes\u2026. I can see now why Arcdemons are important.\u201dNow I knew why it had to be me.\u201cThen what should I do from now on? Have you thought about that yet?\u201d\u201cYou have to build your strength. Also, Gardium is much too dangerous. We have to return to the Demon Realm, gather the scattered demons and reestablish your power, while you must continue your training.\u201dOf course, if I returned to the Demon Realm, I would be welcomed by the demons who still remembered the Demon King, and it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult to gather some forces.The Darklands were vast, and even if the Demon King died, it was impossible for the humans to devour everything. I shook my head at Sarkegaar\u2019s words.\u201cToo dangerous. The humans can\u2019t occupy all of the Darklands, but they wouldn\u2019t neglect their surveillance. If a new demonic force were to emerge, they would immediately launch another attack.\u201dThey wouldn\u2019t just calmly sit by as we reconstruct the Demon Realm they just destroyed. If they noticed any sign of suspicious behavior, they would make a game of killing us all off.And above all, I just said that to go along with their words, because I had no intentions of rebuilding the Demon Realm and going to war again, you know? I was told that the demons would split up again without me, but, to be honest, that would happen in the distant future. It wasn\u2019t like it was happening now.And\u2026 There was another point that wasn\u2019t as important.\u201cI think going back to the Demon Realm would be a bad idea.\u201dSarkegaar\u2019s eyes lit up at my words, as if he just got an idea. I didn\u2019t want to go back to the Demon Realm in the first place. I sure didn\u2019t like it there.I wanted to stay in Gardium for now. The city was pretty nice.I didn\u2019t want to live in a place without trains!\u201cThis is the heart of the enemy territory. To defeat the enemy, one must know the enemy. Rather, we need to learn the ways of humans here.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard for me to come up with some reason, as I was the master of finding excuses.\u201cOoh, you\u2019re definitely the ideal prince. That boldness and courage to strike right at the enemy\u2019s heart! A King\u2019s virtue worthy of imitatiooooon!\u201dNo, I just wanted to live close to the station, you know?There was also Eleris, so there shouldn\u2019t be chance of being discovered by humans while living here. The probability of getting caught should have been significantly lowered.There was no reason for me to leave Gardium. This was the best city to live in on the entire continent, and I didn\u2019t want to leave even if I were to die, unless there was a chance that I would be discovered to be a demon.I just wanted to while away my time here until the ending. It wasn\u2019t good for me to mess with the story any more, and the ending would come closer and closer as the years passed by while being cared for by Eleris.There weren\u2019t any specific conditions that I had to be active, right? Right?Did my excuses work too well? He almost cried at my kind of plausible excuse, believing that I would really be able to defeat our enemy by learning their ways.He seemed to admire my boldness and courage.\u201cYour Highness. If that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been thinking, then I have an even better idea.\u201d\u201c.\u2026A better idea?\u201dNo, I don\u2019t know what it is, but I\u2019m 100% sure it wouldn\u2019t be any good for me.\u201cOnly by knowing the humans\u2019 way would we be able to bring them down! I admire your wisdom!\u201dNo.What are you going to say?\u201cBy entering \u2018Temple\u2019 you would be able to thoroughly learn the humans\u2019 ways! Defeating them with their own weapons would only be true revenge!\u201d\u201dOh.What\u2019s that nonsense?Loyar nodded her head at Sarkegaar\u2019s words.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a bad idea.\u201d\u201cHu, huh?\u201d\u201cThe Temple is the cradle of not only the Empire\u2019s, but also almost all of the human race\u2019s children. When you grow up, you\u2019d know all the people who hold important positions in human society. If you were to fight the Empire, you\u2019d know better than anyone else who your enemies are and their way of thinking. Or you might be able to subdue them. You would destroy the Empire from within.\u201dNo, wait.What?I had no intentions of interfering with the main story. However, Loyar looked at Sarkegaar seemingly agreeing with him as if what he said was something good for once.Sarkegaar added.\u201cAdditionally, Temple is currently nurturing young talents with great power. They aim to nurture talents like the Warrior Artorius. I\u2019m certain it would be of great help to us, knowing what sprouts they are raising and we might be able to remove the too dangerous talents at their roots before they grow.\u201dYes. Temple was also an institution that nurtured talented people who would eventually become powerful forces. Even in that kind of place, there was a type of special calss that nurtured talented people who could succeed the Hero Artorius and his party, and yes, that was where the main characters were.However, there was no reason for me to go there. What the hell was I supposed to do there?I was going crazy.I started to get shoved into the story just because I said the wrong words.Eleris!Help me!You don\u2019t want me to turn into a war weapon, right?!Eleris just smiled at me when she noticed me looking at her with pleading eyes.\u201cI also think that that\u2019s a good idea, Your Highness.\u201dWhat was she on about? Wouldn\u2019t she normally disagree? It was hard to understand why Eleris, who should be opposed to Sarkegaar\u2019s ideas, agreed.\u201cNow, just wait a second\u2026.\u201dI tried hard to come up with an excuse to avoid this strange development all three agreed to.\u201cNo matter how much we can hide our appearances with magic, there will probably be wizards at Temple, don\u2019t you know what would happen then? It would definitely be dangerous if my identity got revealed.\u201dDid these idiots want to kill me?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness.\u201dWith a smile Sarkegaar took off a ring from his finger.\u201cThis is a ring that gets passed down from generation to generation in my clan.\u201d\u201cWell, what about it?\u201d\u201cJust by wearing this ring, you\u2019d be able to use my clan\u2019s power.\u201dWhat?Why would you have such a thing? Why would such a thing appear so conveniently at a time like this? Huh? This was so unbelievable, honestly. Why the hell would these polymorphic bastards pass down a ring capable of granting the ability to polymorph from generation to generation?That would be completely useless to them!Wasn\u2019t this just some random setup for this moment?![Do you find it weird to find such an improbable development happening in this novel suddenly?][Idiot.]I felt like something just went by my vision. I didn\u2019t see it properly.What was that?\u201cThat, that, how could I accept such an important ring that got passed down for such a long time?\u00a0 It, uh, must be very precious to you. Like a memento of your parents. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dI gradually ran out of excuses.\u201cJust what are mementos in the face of your great mission of rebuilding the Demon Realm! Please take it, Your Highness!\u201dSarkegaar\u00a0 pushed the ring towards me while shouting out his determination.\u201cA strong and prosperous nation is almost in our graaaaasp!\u201dI fell victim to my own excuses.Anyway, it was pretty obvious.That person who sent me here didn\u2019t seem to want me to calmly get to the end.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: 19The plan of my admission to Temple had been decided.Yes, obviously, I absolutely wouldn\u2019t get caught with that ring on. This wasn\u2019t on the level of illusion magic, this completely reconstructed my body.I wondered since Polymorph could reconstruct one\u2019s physical body, woudn\u2019t it be possible to improve one\u2019s physical specs as well?If I were to change my body to look like someone who\u2019d have 99 points in strength, wouldn\u2019t I get stronger as well?When I asked this, Loyar told me, strangely seriously:\u201c\u2026.\u2026Polymorph of that level would only be possible for someone with the same amount of mana a dragon would have.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t Arcdemons kind of like dragons?\u201d\u201cDragons are illusory monsters. Could there ever be a being in this world which could use magic without even properly casting?\u201dWhat a sad excuse of a legend.I didn\u2019t believe in legends, they were on the same level as lies.\u201cWhat you\u2019re using isn\u2019t actually Polymorph. This is just the version our clan makes use of, so you must get stronger yourself. Strength obtained through transformation, wouldn\u2019t be your own strength. You should not rely on such cheap tricks.\u201dI\u2019m oh so glad that you confirmed that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use such a cheat ever. Anyway, because I gained the ability of the Dreadfiend clan, I was able to completely transform, not only disguise myself.\u201cBy the way, I have a question.\u201dOf course, I knew that making myself look muscular by using polymorph wouldn\u2019t really make me muscular.\u201cFor example, is there a limit to how dense I could make my hair?\u201d\u201cYes? What do you mean?\u201dSarkegaar didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was talking about.However, I was serious.\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019ve got hair loss, could I just transform myself into a from with a full head of hair? Well, that\u2019s what I was talking about.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a matter of course? That\u2019s not such a big deal.\u201dAh.\u201cSarkegaar! You\u2019re history\u2019s greatest loyalist. Of course! Of course!\u201dYou\u2019re such a nice guy.I couldn\u2019t hold in my passion and hugged him.I held the Eternal Anti Hair Loss Ring in my hands!\u201cIf you wish I shall even give you my liiiiiife!\u201dLoyar and Eleris stared bankly as\u00a0 Sarkegaar and I hugged fiercely.* * *Gardias Temple.The main stage of the original story.Frankly, there was no reason not to go there. As Sarkegaar helped me concealing my identity, I\u2019d be fine. Even if I didn\u2019t intervene, the story would just proceed on its own, going straight for the set ending.In other words, the less involved I was, the better.However, just by intervening slightly, variables would appear. The story already changed a lot because Charlotte de Gardias survived.I didn\u2019t want to get too involved in a story that already had a predetermined ending.Also.There really was no need for me to go to school with all these kids. So why did I have to do it?However, once Sarkegaar would find out that I had no intentions of rebuilding the Demon Realm, I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. As for Loyar, I wasn\u2019t so sure what she was thinking, but Sarkegaar definitely was loyalist, but in the end, he probably was the most dangerous person to me.In the end, Sarkegaar seemed to want me to grow stronger.Frankly speaking, I was neither suited for fighting nor was it my hobby. Just like everyone doesn\u2019t want to suffer pain, I felt like I wanted to escape to a place where my survival and well-being were guaranteed.However, in the end, whether or not I went to Temple, I had to somehow get stronger myself.In order to someday be able to escape Sarkegaar\u2019s clutches, I needed to have a certain amount of strength. It didn\u2019t matter if I was standing on Eleris\u2019 side or Sarkegaar\u2019s side.I would have to enter the Gardias Temple.\u201cBut how?\u201d\u201cIf I took you as my adopted son, you would be able to enter Temple.\u201dUsing the position of Count Pontheus, he could take me in as his adopted son, enabling me to enter Temple like that.I\u2019d also become the son of a noble, so would I be able to live a more comfortable life then?\u201cThat\u2019s too dangerous.\u201dHowever, Eleris shook her head. As if not understanding, Sarkegaar frowned.\u201cWhat are you saying, Eleris?\u201d\u201cSarkegaar, you were the one who personally kidnapped the princess. Now that she has returned, they will restart the investigation of how the princess\u2019 abduction was carried out. They have the princess as witness after all. There\u2019s a chance that they\u2019ll catch your tail.\u201d\u201cI left no traces.\u201d\u201cThink of it as just a precaution.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201dA second investigation into the princess\u2019 abduction could draw suspicion to Sarkegaar. It was really just a precaution, but Eleris seemed to think that there was no need to take useless risks.That was how I thought it was.\u201cThen, as expected, Eleris would be best to be my guardian\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dI thought she\u2019d obviously take on that role, but Eleris just shook her head.\u201cI am a Vampire. If it\u2019s discovered that I\u2019m a vampire, I\u2019m sure Your Highness of whom I was taking care of would also fall under suspicion. I\u2019m always careful with everything I do, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen.\u201dAlthough Eleris was well integrated into human society, she always kept the possibility of being discovered to be a vampire in mind.\u201cWhat? How could I get into Temple if neither Sarkegaar nor Eleris are able to be my guardians?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201dEleris pointed at the last person present as if it was obvious.\u201c\u2026What? Me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYou want the beggar king to be my guardian?What the hell was this nonsense? Both I and Loyar were dumbfounded, but Eleris shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m just telling you, but it would be most beneficial for you to just be born as an orphan.\u201dI understood what she meant.\u201cIf you were adopted by Sarkegaar, you might be in danger if his deeds were discovered, and if you were to choose me as your guardian, you might be in danger if my true identity were discovered.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know what you mean, even if I\u2019m caught, my gang members don\u2019t know that I\u2019m a Lycanthrope, so he could just say that he didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s it, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe members of Loyar\u2019s pack didn\u2019t know that she was a Lycanthrope. So even if Loyar were to be discovered, even if they were questioned most of them wouldn\u2019t know a thing. There were a lot of members after all.In addition, there was a high possibility that I would not be connected to my collaborators even if they were discovered if I entered Temple as an orphan with no ties.Yeah, Eleris was right.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, you want me to live here from now on?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe Your Highness has to live in such a filthy place! That\u2019s just unreasonableeeeeeee!\u201d\u201cDid you just call my place flithy? Are ya trying to insult me?\u201dA fire blazed in Loyar\u2019s eyes.\u201cYa want to let me know how it feels like to buy some bread from your own money starting today? Huh?\u201d\u201cN, no. I, I , I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026\u2026 The, there\u2019s just a bit of\u2026 You know?\u00a0 I mean, see\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that a little too much, huh? Hey, if I\u2019m gonna sponsor such a great VIP, d\u2019ya have any idea what the fuck my kids are supposed to do?\u201dLoyar was their financier.So, she actually had the greatest say here.Loyar threatened Sarkegaar with overwhelming force, and Sarkegaar\u2019s face turned completely blue as soon as he heard that she would stop giving him money.Eleris sighed watching those two fight.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to live here. If you enter Temple, you\u2019ll be able to live in the dormitories. You just need to spend a few days here.\u201dShe gave me a kind of look that seemed to say: \u201cHow could I let you live in such a dirty place?\u201d.Well, I didn\u2019t really mean to become something as grandiose as a noble\u2019s son, but\u2026.When I went to school, won\u2019t the other kids make fun of me for being a beggar? Mentally I was over 30, but no matter how old I\u2019m on the inside\u2026.No, I was just saying if these little punks find out that I made my living by begging at my age, won\u2019t they hit me or something?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dStill, I couldn\u2019t come up with a safer idea than Eleris\u2019 suggestion.Just a few days, a few days\u2026.I have to live a few days in this place\u2026.When I asked her if I had to stay a few days here, Eleris told me that I had to.I was an orphan and didn\u2019t even have a proper identity. It seemed that in order to obtain a new identity, I had to somehow prove that I\u2019m an orphan, and to prove that, I had to get the testimony of Loyar\u2019s group.I couldn\u2019t believe I had to acquire a new identity through the beggars\u2019 guarantees. What\u2019s with this?\u201cThere are many of my little brothers who don\u2019t really exist on paper, so I know what to do, because some of the guys do end up needing an ID.\u201dIt was natural for her to call them little brothers as she\u2019s the head of this organization, so to speak, but it still was strange hearing it come out of her mouth.I couldn\u2019t believe a Lycanthrope being brothers with humans. Was this a live-action version of\u00a0Tiger Brother? So would this Wild Dog also become my brother? No, rather my sister.Sarkegaar\u2019s words angered Loyar, but she seemed to think that staying in this environment for a long time would be a bad thing for me as well.\u201cEleris will come up with the right excuse, so we can just do it like that.\u201dLoyar seemed carefree. Eleris contemplated how she should get me out of here as soon as possible and admit me to Temple.* * *Sarkegaar and Eleris went back, leaving me and Loyar behind. I had already been told what to do. Loyar told me not to worry as no one would touch me anyway, but that wasn\u2019t really the problem\u2026.There\u2019s nothing that can be solved easily.I don\u2019t really want to go to Temple, but now I had to go while wearing an identity given to me by a beggars\u2019 group. This made me want to go even less. But what could I do? This was the safest way.Loyar dragged me out of the deep parts of the sewers and took me to the shantytown.-Whistle!As Loyar whistled, all the beggars that were scattered all over the place slowly started to gather in one place. Everyone was limping, but they seemed to listen well.This must\u2019ve been the dark side of Gardium.\u201cBig sis, what\u2019s with that kid?\u201dIf it were Eleris or Sarkegaar they would have been furious at his words, but Loyar didn\u2019t show much of a reaction. She wasn\u2019t loyal in mind, but very loyal in body. She was that kind of bizarre being.\u201cHe\u2019s a new member. He\u2019s called Reinhardt.\u201dThis was a new name, not my real name which was Valier.Reinhardt.No, I mean Valier wasn\u2019t actually my real name either, right?Anyway, it was an alias, an alias. Nothing more.Sarkegaar suggested it.He told me I should choose another name, not Valier, as my alias, so he asked me for my opinion.Ooh.I had some in mind.\u2018Gromm Hellscream.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Hellscream? Isn\u2019t that name just too creepy?\u2019The first suggestion got cut down by Eleris.\u201aThen Lich King?\u2018\u2018What perfection! What a fitting name for a great Demon Kiiiiiiiiiiiiing! If it\u2019s Your Highness, you would certainly far surpass the magical capabilities of a lich!\u2019\u2018Your Highness, your real name would be much more inconspicuous compared to that.\u2018Sarkegaar agreed to it, but Loyar refused. She said something like: \u201cif you\u2019ll choose such an ugly name, you\u2019d be better off just using your real name.\u201d.Well this name was the equivalent of Kim Eum Doom in Korean.\u2018Then\u00a0Thrall.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Your Highness, we can\u2019t possible use a weird joke like that.\u2019Eleris quite seriously thought Thrall was a pun on \u2018Damn it\u2019. (T/N: Korean writing for Thrall =ssral, Damn it = jae gi ral or also written as X-ral (ekssral)Don\u2019t you know the Warcraft series?!Eventually, after arguing for a long time, we were able to decide on something.\u2018How about Reinhardt?\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Oddly enough, it\u2019s a very main character-like name, but\u2026..\u2019\u2018I think it\u2019s a better name than Hellscream.\u2019\u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt to add a few more syllables. A King\u2019s name can\u2019t be too simple\u2026.\u2019\u2018If it\u2019s even longer than that it would be a pain to say. I also don\u2019t want to be mistaken as a noble or something.\u2019That\u2019s how it got decided. It wasn\u2019t particularly flashy, nor was it something weird. It was just a name.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20At Loyar\u2019s announcement, a sloppy but strong looking guy, who probably was the second-in-command here, chimed in.\u201cBig sis, where should we put \u2018im?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t make him do anything.\u201dLoyar shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m gonna sent him to Temple.\u201dAt those words, the beggars made rather strange expressions.\u201cDid ya eat something wrong?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dOne of the beggars who said something along those lines slightly shrank back, when Loyar raised one of her eyebrows as if they were talking bullshit.\u201cNo, why didja suddenly accept dis kid when you stubbornly refused to let any in before, cause they dun even know anythin? And Temple?\u201dThere certainly weren\u2019t any children my age in Loyar\u2019s beggar group. Teenagers who derailed and ran away from home definitely were as hard to control as rabid dogs. So, it was quite natural that they asked something like that. Loyar shook her head.\u201cThis guy\u2019s our future.\u201dIt felt weird suddenly becoming a bunch of beggars\u2019 future.Maybe I\u2019ve actually become the future of these guys to a certain extent.Everyone\u2019s expressions showed more and more confusion. Loyar looked at the beggars, who were thoroughly dumbfounded and placed her hands on her hips.The King of Beggars began her speech.\u201cAs y\u2019all know, we have nothing and we don\u2019t know anything. Ain\u2019t that right? Some of ya keep talking about the good old times where y\u2019all were great, but look at ya now? Left to rot in some gutter. That\u2019s why we got together like this. So that the ones who don\u2019t exist can also live their lives.\u201d\u201cBut how long d\u2019ya plan to live like that? I don\u2019t care if it just were me, but you guys don\u2019t want to live like this, right? Ya want to get out of this life, right?\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s too late for us to learn anything new. So through our power\u2026. Our, money. Yes, using our capital, we will nurture talented people who\u2019d be responsible for this gang\u2019s future.\u201dThinking what she said was quite plausible, Loyar seemed content. Somehow, this is the first time I\u2019ve witnessed such charisma in any of my lives.I instructed Loyar to briefly explain this as a strategy to nurture talent for the future of the gang and to first heavily focus their capital into one talent with the goal of optimizing the situation of all the beggars here.One of the beggars titlted their head at Loyar\u2019s proud declaration.\u201cBig sis, I dun think sending some guys to Temple would suddenly make us sleep on feather cushions, though?\u201dA valid concern.Of course, Eleris and I came up with a lot of excuses to deal with this situation.\u201cIf I say it\u2019s like that, then it is like that. You bastards!\u201dHowever, Loyar just shouted at them, not tolerating any protests.\u201cIf that\u2019s what the boss said.\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201dAnd everyone accepted that one sentence rather than millions of excuses.That was a boss for you.However, would it be worse to be found out to be a demon or the heir of a beggar organization?Aren\u2019t they both pretty dog-like existences?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Strictly speaking, Loyar\u2019s words weren\u2019t just cheap excuses. Everyone was just convinced by the feeling that whatever Loyar told them, they had to do. It was that kind of attitude. Perhaps, this wasn\u2019t the first time that Loyar made them do something absurd.Loyar took me to a rather big shack, and brought someone else with her.A man of strong stature. He was the one who looked like the second-in-command from earlier. Loyar introduced me to this man.Since Loyar was the boss around here, he promised me to treat me comfortably.\u201cSay hi to each other. This is our gang\u2019s future. Reinhardt. Reinhardt, this is my most trusted younger brother, so you can trust him, too. His name is Daibun.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Reinhardt, I\u2019m Daibun.\u201dHe was the younger brother favored by a Lycanthrope.Was this a friendship that transcended race? It wasn\u2019t even 1%, it was friendship with a few decimal places between them. (T/N: as in their positions)\u201cI\u2019m Reinhardt.\u201dI shook hands with him. His hand was as large as a pot lid. Rather than a beggar, he looked more like a retired soldier in a slightly shabby outfit. He gave of a rugged impression.Perhaps because he trusted Loyar just that much, but he didn\u2019t question or ask anything about this stranger that appeared out of nowhere she suddenly offered to send to Temple.\u201cTake \u2018im to get an ID tomorrow. If you got time, swing by Temple.\u201d\u201cYes, big sis.\u201dThe three of us just sat around for now. It was messy, but it was worlds apart from that hallway inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle littered with corpses. This place was only dirty, so this was a literal heaven compared to that.I thought about the worst case scenario and affirmed my present situation. Although it was a bit uncomfortable, it could be worse. Then Daibun spoke up hesitantly as he looked at Loyar.\u201cBig sis, what are you gonna do about the tuition? I\u2019m not really sure, but ain\u2019t Temple for noble children? I heard it costs a lot of money.\u201dIt was a problem we were already aware of. We made the decision I\u2019d go, but didn\u2019t even have a way to solve the most important problem. It wasn\u2019t about getting detected, but getting enough money.For that reason, there were doubts whether it would be possible for Loyar to continue paying tuition for Temple.The Gardias Temple was the most famous educational institution on the continent. Not only members of the Empire but also members of leading families from all over the continent often came to study abroad there.Because of that the tuition was extremely high. The Temple itself was an educational institute, but it was also the place that gave the Empire the most revenue. Just by getting admitted to Temple one would be able to build connections with a lot of influential people. Nobles didn\u2019t hesitate to pay a lot of money just to send their children to Temple.However, it was doubtful that this beggars\u2019 organization could admit me to Temple and continue to support me by paying that sinfully high tuition fee. I already had a contingency plan though.Temple\u2019s tuition fee varied depending on the grade and major, however, ordinary students required to pay 50 gold per semester. About 50 million won. That was equivalent to 100 million a year. In addition, tuition wildly varied depending on the major.\u2018First of all, you only have to provide the tuition fee for a certain period of time.\u2019\u2018Are you thinking of going for a scholarship?\u2019Of course, I probably was smarter than the average kid, but honestly, there were definitely plenty of kids smarter than me in that place.However, that wasn\u2019t what was important.\u2018The Empire wants a second and third Artorius. So what if one definitely had the talent, but didn\u2019t have the money to get an education at Temple? In that case, the tuition will be waived!\u2019It sounded like I was guessing, but that\u2019s what would happen. Students with outstanding talents, but with limited financial power, were specially managed within Temple. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t make you pay the huge amount of tuition fees.I was an Arcdemon. There should be something I could do.\u2018Once I enter the school and get some education, I should be able to find something I\u2019m talented in.\u2019After that tuition would be waived. This isn\u2019t just nonsense as well, because I could make a talent bloom with my achievement points. It might not be possible at the moment, but there were plenty of ways to get achievement points if I started sticking close to the main story.Everyone nodded to this as if it was quite plausible.Before I was forced to go to Temple, I did say that I wanted to live a comfortable life, but if I had to go anyway, any thoughts about that went right out of the window. I had to become stronger, whether I liked it or not.So, it was important to gather enough money to attend the first semester. From that point on, I\u2019d get woven inside the main story, collect achievement points and develop my talents.That was my goal now.\u201cCan we even do that with our earnings?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really know, but\u2026\u2026 probably not.\u201dLoyar wasn\u2019t particularly sharp.Daibun hesitated before he opened his mouth.\u201cWell, how \u2018bout if we cut down on what big sis is taking from the gang\u2019s finances\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe money Sarkegaar spend on his aristocratic life. Perhaps Loyar didn\u2019t disclose what she used the money she was taking away for. If we do as Daibun said we\u2019d be able to save up enough money for me to go to Temple.However, Loyar firmly shook her head.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I had to use it to prevent crap from happening?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. You did.\u201dLoyar seemed to have told them that she uses the money to bribe the guards, explaining why her gang wasn\u2019t cracked down on even though they were the way they were. Of course, I didn\u2019t know if she really did that or not.Well, Sarkegaar was a noble after all. He probably used his power to prevent this side from getting affected by anything. Either way, neither Loyar nor I could give up the support given to Sarkegaar.Daibun sighed.\u201cThese days our revenue is decreasing. Big sis, no one is getting close to Bronzegate Bridge anymore.\u201dThere were rumors spreading that this place housed solicitors. For a long time now, people in the know didn\u2019t come close to this place. As such, the revenue was gradually decreasing. That was only natural.\u201cThis is a serious problem\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like Loyar only realized at that moment that things weren\u2019t going as planned. Then she glanced at me, as if telling me to do something.Yes, I was waiting for my turn to speak.\u201cUhm\u2026. How about we think about this a bit differently?\u201d\u201cHuh? Differently?\u201dDaibun furrowed his brows as if what I said was strange.No, these people just didn\u2019t have enough sense to improve themselves. The answer was actually quite simple.\u201cIf the customers are avoiding us, we just have find them ourselves.\u201dThat was only natural. If one didn\u2019t have customers, one had to find some. I got quite restless seeing that they didn\u2019t even try to leave this place. It seemed like they were running around this area trying to sell their candy to people passing by. If one market was blocked, one should just open a new one.Who\u2019d help you if you just stayed on the ground saying you\u2019re screwed?\u201cFind them? Do you mean to expand our power to other regions?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cDo you have something in mind?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ll sent them too far away, the kids might get exhausted too quickly.\u201dDaibun seemed to think it would be difficult to realize because they had to walk long distances to expand our power.\u201cNo, this\u2019ll make things more comfortable.\u201d\u201cComfortable\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, they\u2019d just have to go to one place. It\u2019s a place with a lot of people coming and going with a huge flow of people, you know?\u201dAs if wondering where such a dream-like place was located, Loyar and Daibun looked at me with dumbfounded expressions on their faces.\u201cThe Mana Train.\u201dThat place had the largest flow of people in the whole capital.They\u2019d evolve from simple solicitors to subway vendors.Both Daibun and Loyar were astonished by my idea that could be called revolutionary.That was it.That was how things should be done.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Daibun continued to admire me, saying that he didn\u2019t know how he couldn\u2019t think of selling things in a place like that, and Loyar also seemed to think that that would be a good idea.I\u2019ve only been on that train once, but it didn\u2019t seem like there were any guards positioned on it yet. There might be complaints against the vendors getting filed, resulting in countermeasures, but that would be in the distant future.It didn\u2019t end there.This was my cash cow. Of course, things had to work out here. They had to earn a lot more and be more stable than they had ever been before.In fact, it was difficult for me to believe that either Eleris or Sarkegaar would bring in any income.Hence, this place was my lifeline.\u201cOf course, just selling candy alone like before would be a little weak. So we have to have something that would draw in everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d\u201cAttention?\u201dA place where a large amount of people gathered was overflowing with consumers. Of course, candy alone wouldn\u2019t garner much attention. It had to be a product that was specifically targeted at our customers.\u201cHowever, our financial situation isn\u2019t good enough to sell the good stuff, you know?\u201d\u201cRight\u2026.\u201dOf course, it would have been nice if we could sell good quality stuff that people needed, but if that were possible for us, we\u2019d just start an official business. Simply put, something simple, inexpensive that attracted a lot of attention, something that focused on utility rather than quality.\u201cToys would be the best thing to sell in our situation I believe.\u201d\u201cToys? I don\u2019t know what stuff they\u2019re selling elsewhere, but d\u2019ya think they\u2019ll sell?\u201dLoyar seemed a bit hesitant.I chuckled.\u201cToys are products who are demanded by a different comsumer group than the actual purchasers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dDaibun would probably understand, but Loyar wasn\u2019t the sharpest. Well, yeah, this was optimized for isekai characters. Not bad.An Isekai cliche.Talking about completely normal everyday things as if they were amazing in front of stupid characters.Depending on the level of the things the writer makes the main character say one could tell the writer\u2019s knowledge level.Something along the lines of: \u201cAah, this is soap. Because of the\u00a0surfactant\u00a0in it you can wash your hands really well\u201dThere\u2019s a 100% chance that you\u2019ll feel great about yourself for using the word \u2018surfactant\u2019 and about 98.235% of people will think you\u2019re one smart cookie.Anyway.This time I was talking about toys.\u201cIt\u2019s the kids who will be begging for toys, but it\u2019s the parents who have to pay for them.\u201dToys were something kids demanded, but the actual purchase happened through the parents.\u201cLet\u2019s say a toddler were to cry for that toy on a crowded mana train.\u201dThey were both staring at me talking.\u201cThen the parents would buy that toy, whether it was poor quality or not.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how I should explain knowing this even though I lost my memory, but I was sure they\u2019ll hear me out.If they keep suspecting me, I didn\u2019t think it would be such a bad idea to tell them the truth. I could even tell them I was a writer, however that would probably sound like nonsense to them.I had no intention of acting careless purposefully though.Anyway.Loyar and Daibun were looking at me almost as if I was some kind of devil\u2019s spawn-Well, wasn\u2019t I kind of one?\u201cYou\u2019re terrible\u2026!\u201dWithout realizing it, Loyar\u2019s true intentions slipped out of her mouth. I was surprised myself.Even if you treat me comfortably because I\u2019m a kid. Huh? You want me to be good? Huh? Didn\u2019t you say we should live comfortably together?I was getting a little mad.\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s do our best!\u201dI reached out my palm.-Pat!Loyar, of course, gave me her \u2018paw\u2019 out of reflex. Her face was completely blank.Conclusion.I didn\u2019t have any more plausible bullshit but toys in stock.* * *There were many other conditions I added. For starters they needed some neat clothes and a sales book to keep track of the articles they sold. Like that they wouldn\u2019t be shunned at least. They would at first do it like they did so far,\u00a0 but I\u2019ve been trying to urge them to become more customer-friendly in the future.We also had to think about our products, though.Daibun was very impressed with the measures I had taken. He told me that he now understood why his big sis wanted to send me to Temple. He even generously praised me, saying that I\u2019d deserve being their gang\u2019s brain. He even mentioned that it would be great if I received advanced education there.With just a few words his attitude changed as if he just received a thousand dollars instead of having to pay off a debt of a thousand dollars.I joined amidst the group to get to know them a bit better at least. To be honest, it felt pretty uncomfortable, but I couldn\u2019t avoid them anyway. It seemed like Loyar usually doesn\u2019t do anything but sleep.She apparently did make an appearance when it was time to punch someone.\u201cI heard that Daibun praised that guy.\u201dAlthough Loyar acted as the boss, it seemed like it was actually Daibun\u2019s role to manage the organization. Loyar said she\u2019d send me to Temple, and Daibun didn\u2019t hold back with his complements, claiming that I wasn\u2019t an ordinary person, so the other members seemed to be looking upon me quite favorably, albeit still a bit skeptical.\u201cHey, have a drink.\u201dThey offered alcohol to me without hesitation. Although one could see I was a minor at first glance, it seemed like they didn\u2019t care about that.\u201cHey, all of this.\u201dI, who was in my thirties, also wanted to have a taste, but I was rather surprised.\u201cHey! What\u2019re ya givin alcohol to some kid?!\u201dThere were some who said things like that, but I just giggled slightly and downed the drink in one go, before they could dissuade me.\u201cWoah, awsome.\u201dEveryone burst into laughter seeing me do this.It\u2019s a little bitter, but who cares.Alcohol is alcohol and water is water. So it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.The old man who poured me the drink chuckled. His breath didn\u2019t smell that good, but it didn\u2019t really matter.\u201cThat young and already knows how to drink! Hah!\u201d\u201cIs there a life without alcohol?\u201d\u201cWell said!\u201d\u201cThis is it! Oh, we can become great friends!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been getting drunk ever since I was your age, now look at me! Hahaha!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s get drunk again today! Let\u2019s goooooo! Let\u2019ssss gooooo!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s driiiink!\u201d\u201cHere we goooooo!\u201dWithout them I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to live, so I couldn\u2019t be picky and ungrateful.I drank vigorously with the beggars until far into the night. Surprisingly, these gents knew how to drink the right way. No, well, I actually was an old man, so of course I couldn\u2019t help but match these old men\u2019s pace.They asked me this and that, and I wasn\u2019t that drunk, so I answered them as I planned.\u201cBut how didcha get here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even remember anymore when I was abandoned. I was just drifting from place to place.\u201dToo young to remember when I was abandoned, Loyar found me while I was wandering around the streets, so she took me in.My origins were unknown. Everyone patted me on the shoulder saying that I must have had a hard time while still being so young. I was also told that I should go to Temple and become a great man.\u201cDon\u2019t be like us.\u201d They said. They gave me some advice that almost brought me to tears.\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s the name of this gang\u2026?\u201dIt seemed that Loyar was called by the nickname Irene\u2019s Wild Dog and she repeatedly called this organization a gang.Didn\u2019t they have another name for it? What the hell, the name can\u2019t just be \u2018Gang\u2019 right?\u201cOh, yeah. There\u2019s a big intersection up there.\u201dIntersection? What did that have to do with anything?\u201cWhat, does the newcomer not even know what this gang\u2019s name is?\u201dOne of the middle-aged man burst into laughter.\u201cRotary gang, dude. Remember that.\u201dAh.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After seeing this drunken chaos in the middle of the night, Loyar got mad, saying: \u201cWhat gave ya the idea to make a kid drink alcohol?\u201dIt felt like I got drunk and my elder sister dragged me away to scold me. I actually did get nagged, but it was very different from my old days. Did the former Prince not drink before?Still, probably because I played around with the others at what felt like a welcome party, everyone seemed to see me as a very nice guy.The next day, I made it my goal to somehow sort out the situation of the Rotary Gang.Even though they were on my side, I didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that I knew everything about them. The reason I drank with them yesterday was obviously because I wanted to get to know the Rotary gang as well as its members as much as possible.The Rotary gang had about 200 members. That\u2019s quite the number.I didn\u2019t know what the exact income of the solicitors was, but if it was enough to support the everyday life of a nobleman, then one could assume that it was quite high. However, not only were they able to support a noblemen, but they were also able to cover food costs and received compensation money, you know?Just how many candies did they have to sell a day for that to be possible? Even if every single one of them sold one candy worth 5 bronze coins every day, which would just amount to a thousand bronze coins and 10 silver coins.That would just be a hundred thousand won. Even if everyone sold 10 pieces each, it would just be a million won. Moreover, not everyone is mobilized at once to sell candy. It seemed impossible to even maintain this group with just that.Of course, there were people who begged as well as those who solicited, but I didn\u2019t know if that would be enough to maintain such a huge group.The Rotary gang must have had a different source of income.There was no way that Sarkegaar and Eleris didn\u2019t know about this.It appeared that they didn\u2019t tell me on purpose.Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar kept some secrets from me about the Rotary gang\u2019s source of income.I was wondering what was going on, so I asked Loyar directly.Loyar usually hung around the bon fire deep in the sewers, where no one ever set foot in, whiling away her time or sleeping.I believe you have a different source of income somewhere else, but just what is it?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dLoyar cut me off as if she didn\u2019t want to tell me.\u201cOkay, then just answer me one thing.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAre you hurting people?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, but sometimes that\u2019s what happens as a result of it.\u201dThat was how Loyar answered. It wasn\u2019t something that necessarily hurt people, but in some cases it might happen as a result of it.\u201cI heard that the gang has about 200 members.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHowever, I believe there are only about 50 people living here.\u201d50 was still a large number, but it certainly wasn\u2019t more than 200. This was an indirect question pertaining as to where the rest of the members were. Loyar let out a short sigh.It\u2019s like she understood that I wouldn\u2019t back down so easily.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I thought it would be better if you didn\u2019t know about these kinds of things. I had no intention of deceiving you.\u201d\u201cYeah, it might be a little dangerous if I knew about it, right? That\u2019s what you were thinking.\u201d\u201cSelling candies is just a disguise.\u201dSoliciting wasn\u2019t their main goal.\u201cWe are supported by the Gardium Thieves\u2019 Guild.\u201dTheir main goal was collecting information that organization wanted, when they wanted.That\u2019s how it was possible to maintain a group of this size, Loyar added.So, I was right about this being the Fantasy version of the Beggars\u2019 Sect.The Rotary gang was the information gathering organization the Gardium Thieves\u2019 Guild outsourced. Even if beggars were driven out, they were rarely suspected. Then, at my question of whether my proposed change in soliciting method was meaningless then, Loyar shook her head.\u201cWe are inextricably linked to the Thieves\u2019 Guild, but the more dependent we are on them, the more they will try to control us. If the gang can operate only with the gang\u2019s profit, that alone would be meaningful.\u201dIn the end, the proposal I made yesterday meant a lot to Loyar and Daibun.If the group couldn\u2019t maintain themselves without the support of the Thieves\u2019 Guild, they would try to use the Rotary gang more and more freely. However, if the Rotary gang\u2019s own revenue grew, it could be freed from further interference from the Thieves\u2019 Guild.I did notice that Daibun was unusually excited, so that might have been the reason.It\u2019s complicated in many ways, but in the end it was all about money.I could also understand now what she meant with that it could end up harming someone, as they didn\u2019t know what the Thieves\u2019 Guild would do with their information.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know much about this. You can just go to Temple using the fact that you are from this side and forget about us.\u201dShe told the gang members that I was their future, however what she truly meant was that I should just focus on training myself at Temple. I didn\u2019t have a reason to care about the Rotary gang\u2019s matters.Even if there were problems with the Rotary gang, Eleris suggested that I should just cut ties with them after I got them to pay tuition for me and I entered the school.If I developed some kind of talent, I would be exempted from paying tuition fees and I would no longer have a need to be involved with the Rotary gang.That was why Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar didn\u2019t tell me about the gang\u2019s secret source of income, which I didn\u2019t need to know about.\u201cIf I\u2019ve satisfied you now, go with Daibun. You need to make an ID.\u201dAside from gathering the admission fees, I needed an identity first. Let\u2019s take a single step at a time.Shit.I had chosen a path when I was at the crossroads between just quietly waiting for the ending to pass and setting foot in the main story.I wanted to live comfortably, but in the end, I ended up having to join Temple. If it couldn\u2019t be helped, I would just have to do something about it, just like I did when I saved Charlotte the other day.After entering Temple, I had to clench my teeth.The future would change greatly depending on how strong I became.At that time, Sarkegaar, Eleris and Loyar.They all would find out that the Demon Realm wasn\u2019t that important.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22I was told that Daibun created a lot of identities for people that had no origins. He took me to the Imperial City Bureau, so to speak, to a nearby district office. The person in charge looked tried as if he had seen Daibun many times, maybe even questioning why he had come again.\u201cYou\u2019re looking quite neat today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve brought a child this time.\u201d\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know you actually cared that much.\u201dPerhaps because Daibun played the role of my guardian today, he wore clean clothes and bathed today. I did the same. The person in charge didn\u2019t seem to be all that fussy, as if this had already happened frequently except that we looked rather neat.He didn\u2019t have any suspicions or questions, completing the procedure swiftly.When I received the Dreadfiend\u2019s ring, I thought long and hard as to what to change my appearance to. Naturally I should have a lot of hair.I shouldn\u2019t be too handsome or too ugly.I did want to live as a super handsome man, but I didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention with my looks. That was the first thing Eleris told me.So I tried to make myself look moderately good-looking. Blonde hair, slightly curly, blue eyes. Neither the hair color nor the eye color were especially rare. It was good enough to looks slightly better than average. I was a bit good looking, but not overwhelmingly handsome.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cWhere were you born?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026. You don\u2019t even know from what town you come from?\u201dThe person in charge looked at me rather frustrated.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t really remember, because I was abandoned when I was very young.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask for much more information after that. He told me to put my hand on some mana stone in front of the table. He seemed to check something and then nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely no data on you\u2026 You must have lived a rather righteous life.\u201dHe suddenly spoke some nonsense, but I could roughly understand what that meant. This seemed to be something like a fingerprint reader, so if I were caught by the guards after I committed even a petty crime, my data would\u2019ve already been registered. \u00a0Homeless children like me were more likely to commit crimes, but seeing that I did not have such records, he presumed that I lived a righteous life.After all, my birthplace and address were unknown, but I couldn\u2019t just leave it blank, so I just made up a date of birth with those two. The birthplace was set as a suitable city that disappeared a long time ago and my address was south of the Bronzegate Bridge.It seemed like I owned the bridge, but I actually lived under it.Due to the advanced nature of the empire, they had a magic tool with which I was able to get a photo for my ID card.Daibun and I left the office, sent off with the reminder to periodically come around to renew the ID.So.It really was no different from a modern district office.They were too expedient! To a shocking degree at that!However, that was good!\u201cThat was pretty easy.\u201d\u201cWe gave him some things after all, so of course our stay would have been comfortable.\u201dI assumed that the person in charge was provided with a variety of things. I did feel that he was too easy going. If he got caught doing things like this, the outcome would be pretty clear.I checked my ID that was in the form of a metal card.It showed a picture, my name, date of birth and identification number. It wasn\u2019t much different from a modern ID card. The same went for the registration of biometric data.Only its appearance fit into medieval fantasy, but its convenience wasn\u2019t much different from the modern world.Once again, it was medieval Fantasy .Anyway.To sum it up in a single sentence.It was convenient.The town was still in an excited frenzy as a result of their victory. That atmosphere would last for a very long time. The improvement event when the\u00a0 war veterans returned would be on an even greater scale.A long festival would follow.Now that I had an ID, I decided to smoothly proceed with my admission to Temple.\u201cBy the way, does Temple just admit anyone who has money? Wasn\u2019t there something like\u2026 They won\u2019t accept commoners or something?\u201dWhile we were on the way to Temple, Daibun tilted his head..\u201cWell, I never heard anything like that.\u201dThe tuition fees were just so high that it was almost impossible to enter the school unless one was a noble\u2019s child, had wealthy parents or was part of a merchant\u2019s family.If one had the confidence to pay hundreds of millions of won a year, depending on what major one picked, one was free to go. If one wanted to pursue higher education one would have to expect to pay twice as much.50 gold coins was the average. Depending on ones major, tuition fees could rise to unimaginable amounts. Of course, there was a scholarship system, and there were cases where children were exempted from the tuition depending on how much they contributed to the empire.So, after the end of the war, a huge amount of medals would be handed out, leading the Temple to be crowded with more freshmen than usual starting with the next year.Temple was so expensive because they reinvested that money earned from that huge tuition fee into talented children. Most don\u2019t get that much education.Daibun took me to the Eredian district.That would be where the Gwanak district and Seoul National University were located in Korea.The only difference was that Temple was a much larger educational institution covering the entire Gwanak district. Therefore, it was only natural that the number of students was also astronomically high, meaning the money that went into this school was equally astronomical.Not only that. In order to prevent non-students from wandering around the campus, Temple was equipped with physical barriers as well as large scale magic barriers that block those that weren\u2019t students, faculty or people who had permission to enter. The Temple\u2019s security, crime prevention system and barriers that I set up were exactly the same as the Imperial Castle\u2019s.There were children said to come from each country\u2019s powerful family, so they created an environment in which they could fully focus on their studies without worrying about their safety. That\u2019s why everyone was able to send their children off to a far away place with a peace of mind and it would be a big deal if any of the students were to get harmed or abducted while they were walking around the campus, so they put huge emphasis on the safety measures.Of course, there were loopholes, because an incident had to happen after all.If the defense and countermeasures were too perfect, incidents wouldn\u2019t be able to happen. No one wanted that. Especially me.Anyway, Temple was practically a town\u2019s name, so it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense to say we arrived at Temple to begin with. The mana train couldn\u2019t even go inside of Temple.We arrived at the admission office outside Temple. Daibun couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\u201cThis is my first time coming here, so why are there so many people here?\u201dThe admission counseling center on its own was already huge enough to be called a school, and what was even more surprising was the number of people waiting near the entrance.They were people waiting to get admitted. They all pulled a number ticket, all of whom were children with their parents next to them.Daibun just couldn\u2019t understand that there were so many rich people out there trying to send their children to Temple.I knew what this was about.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what it is?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cChildren with special talents can enter Temple for free. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to confirm here.\u201d\u201cWill there even be cases like that?\u201d\u201cOne could never know.\u201dI put it as if it was just a guess, however it was actually the truth. Even though it was difficult for them to pay the tuition, there were some parents who thought their child had special powers or was a genius.Parents who couldn\u2019t afford to pay the school fees would come here with their children, counting on that possibility.Of course, most of them get sent back disappointed that there was no talent to be found, but they definitely did discover children with special talents, allowing them to enter the school.The probability was just very low.There were four forces in this world as a great whole.Combat, Magic, Divine power.And a power that was completely different from those three, a power that hadn\u2019t been discovered even after a long time. Supernatural power.Combat wasn\u2019t just about being able to run well, but being able to display superhuman powers after one grew up. Such was the case with Artorius. The Knights of Duke Salerian who pursued me must have been those with similar powers. However, even on the side of the Demon Realm, there were monsters a lot stronger. There was a good reason why the Gargoyle was able to crush these veteran knights in a single blow.In any case, those that have the potential to develop superhuman powers will go on to learn martial arts.Children who were unusually smart or were discovered to have magic-related talents would go on to major in magic.Those who show talent in divine power would go down the path of a priest or paladin.And very rarely, children sometimes awakened to bizarre abilities. These powers, dubbed supernatural powers, had not yet been fully elucidated, because it wasn\u2019t an ability that could be learned and used like magic. Some people might not even be able to control them properly.That was why the Empire was taking special care towards these supernatural powers. They weren\u2019t used as resources in the Demon World War, but they could be very dangerous depending on the person. Depending on the level of danger, users with supernatural powers that were thought to be out of control would eventually be disposed of secretly.For children with supernatural powers, Temple served as an institution to socialize as well as learn how to control and develop their abilities.Of course, most of the children gathered here would most likely fall under none of these four classes.Having talent was rare. Really rare.\u201cBy the way, with so many people here, would we even get our turn today?\u201dDaibun seemed to be thinking about a much more realistic problem. I was rather sure that if we were to line up there we would have to wait for a really long time. Perhaps so long until they closed their doors, so we couldn\u2019t know if we would even be able to get in today.Of course, that was an unnecessary worry.\u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0 here to apply for admission, not for consultation, right?\u201dWe didn\u2019t come here to try for the free admission, because we didn\u2019t have enough money or something.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right.\u201dWe proudly entered through the entrance to apply for admission, not into the admission counselation office.Unlike the admission counselation office, the place to apply for admission was quiet. Of course, there were people there, but the place they waited in was decorated very luxuriously.There were some parents who bawled their eyes out at the thought that they had to say goodbye to their children soon, perhaps because they came from afar, and some children who whined that they didn\u2019t want to go.No matter how good Temple was, you could always find people like that. What did they know? Just because they had to part with their parents.\u201cEhm, this is the window for admission applications\u2026.\u201dSeeing me and Daibun, who looked rather neat but also rather penniless, the counter staff tried to gently guide us to the other side.\u201cU, uh\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dDaibun froze by my side, perhaps because that was his first time coming to a place filled with enormously wealthy people. No, why would my guardian be scared, huh?\u201cI came here to pay the admission fee.\u201dOn the contrary, when I spoke up calmly, the staff looked rather embarrassed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23The Admissions counseling center was practically crowded with people, but the admissions application office was quiet and each student had a one-on-one meeting with a counselor to receive counseling. Said counselor said they came because we said we had the money to apply, but they looked at Daibun with a look of disbelief.\u201cUhm\u2026. This may sound rude, but may I tell you something in advance?\u201d\u201cYes. Go ahead.\u201dDaibun was completely frozen, so I just stepped up. The counselor continued with a slightly apologetic expression.\u201cThere are some people who only pay tuition for one semester\u2026 Those who wish to first enter the school\u2026.\u201dIt was true that 50 gold was a huge amount of money, but if they liquidated everything you had, there may be some people who could afford it, so there were some people who only payed for one semester like this. Was this about that?\u201cCan you not do that?\u201dIf we couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t that mean my plans wouldn\u2019t go through? The counselor also spoke respectfully to me.Perhaps it became a habit after meeting so many children of high-ranking people.\u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t have the money to pay the tuition for this semester and the next\u2026 It\u2019s a rule to expel these people after a certain period of time, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, if I don\u2019t have the money for the next semester, I won\u2019t be able to register?\u201d\u201cYes, in principle. However, there is no reason to sanction this just because of that\u2026. As not all the students admitted like that would end up this way\u2026. Sometimes, that is.\u201dWhat?Was there an additional setting or environment created by some probability that I didn\u2019t set up? The counselor hesitated to speak.\u201cThey would first pay the tuition for just a single semester and then, well\u2026 They would try to build up friendships with other more financially stable children during that semester\u2026. They then would ask them to pay the tuition for the next semester\u2026. There were quite a few like that.\u201dOh.I seemed to know what they were talking about.\u201cChildren would whine to their parents that a close friend of theirs had to leave Temple because they lacked money\u2026. There were parents who would listen to them, but\u2026 This is rather damaging towards Temple\u2019s image, in many ways\u2026.\u201dEven if the tuition for Temple was pretty expensive, that was of little importance to those who were very wealthy. In Temple, where nobles, commoners and royalty lived together, friendships transcending their social status sometimes occurred.Therefore, there were children who entered for one semester in the hopes of building such a connection, of course, it was mostly the parents that made them. Even if it wasn\u2019t just to make them pay their tuition fees, they calculated that it would be beneficial just to have an extremely wealthy friend.The children might make a fuss about their friends leaving, but the parents might just go complain to Temple why they would let beggars just casually wander around their grounds.I didn\u2019t even think of that when I set up Temple, but, indeed, short-term admissions could be used like that.It\u2019s ridiculous, sad, and pathetic that I didn\u2019t think of that!\u201cAfter this became a problem, we decided to no longer admit children whose parents cannot financially support them well enough to allow them to study here for a considerable amount of time while at Temple\u2026. The other problem is, that if children just leave after one semester, the other ones who were close to them would also end up very hurt\u2026.\u201dTemple\u2019s stance on this was understandable if anything. Changing classmates to often was also detrimental to the children, even if that student was just trying to mooch off of other kids\u2026. I would also want to implement such a policy if I were in their shoes.However, I was planning on developing my talent after entering the school to become a permanent scholarship student, you know?They probably wouldn\u2019t believe me if I started saying things like that.Wouldn\u2019t my path be immediately blocked if I told them I was the successor of the Bronzegate Rotary gang?Rather, I might have had a better chance if I had come from Sarkegaar\u2019s side.\u201cOnce you have prepared the documents to prove your financial status, we can review them\u2026. You don\u2019t seem to have that much leeway though.\u201dThe counselor was very politely dismissing the two of us, however I wasn\u2019t particularly offended by that.The Demon Prince couldn\u2019t enter Temple because he didn\u2019t have enough money.We came with the confidence that I\u2019d be easily admitted.That soon turned into the feeling of needing to beg to be let in.Daibun lowered his head as if he had committed a crime.No, if you don\u2019t have money, then you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault, dude.What was I supposed to do? I didn\u2019t think I would come across such an obstacle. The Rotary gang had many people, but it was difficult to prove their finances. It may have been possible to borrow money through the Thieves\u2019 Guild, but that was just ridiculous, as that would rather prove that I had connections to a criminal organization.As expected, my only other option would be to change my appearance again, get another ID card and enter as Sarkegaar\u2019s adopted son.\u201cSigh, there\u2019s nothing more I can do\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we do that inspection thing or something?\u201dWhen I was about to get up, Daibun said something out of the blue.An inspection? What inspection?\u201cIf it\u2019s an inspection\u2026.\u201dDaibun had a desperate expression on his face.\u201cHe might be a genius or have supernatural powers. Well, wouldn\u2019t that be possible? Does it cost money to do the inspection?\u201dNo, what\u2019s wrong with this man?The counselor looked puzzled at Daibun\u2019s sudden outburst.\u201cOf course, we conduct inspections at the application consultation center, not at the admittance office\u2026. Inspections alone do not cost money\u2026. However, the chances of a child having a talent are rather slim. Most children don\u2019t have a single talent\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat the counselor said was true. I didn\u2019t have any talent right now. So there was no hope for the thing Daibun suggested with such a desperate expression.\u201cHe, hey. Let\u2019s just get out of here, Daibun.\u201d\u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t know about that if we didn\u2019t try. How long does it take to get tested? Does it take long?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. It doesn\u2019t take that long. You just have to touch the physical scanner\u2026 but you shouldn\u2019t do this here in the admittance office\u2026.\u201dThe counselor seemed troubled by Daibun\u2019s sudden obstinate attitude. They looked between me and Daibun and eventually sighed slightly.\u201cOkay, since you came all the way here already\u2026.\u201dThe counselor rummaged through one of the counseling rooms and took out a magic tool, saying: \u201cIt won\u2019t take that long\u201d. A physical scanner, so to speak, was this world\u2019s talent and status meter. They determined one\u2019s current ability and potential talent with these things.This was the staple among convenient settings. If I didn\u2019t add something like that, wouldn\u2019t that have been too difficult? I would have had to describe it a lot more, and vague at that, so there was a need for a state window. Like that, one could immediately determine how strong a character was!Stat windows would quantify strength in numbers. Without it I would have had to describe the strength through events. I would have to explain it like \u201cBefore I did this and that and I just couldn\u2019t do it, but now I feel like I got stronger\u201d.That was just too annoying and difficult.Attack power increased by 1000!Wasn\u2019t that just too comfortable to write? I love it.But anyway, what Daibun was doing now was pretty much meaningless.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will be worth it, Daibun.\u201d\u201cIf you got nothing to lose by doing this, then just do it. Or is there something wrong with that?\u201dIt seemed like Daibun wanted me to take it as it was free anyway. He seemed to think that I desperately needed to enter Temple. I had another way, but Daibun didn\u2019t know about that.He was just thinking of me.He was such a nice guy. However, that didn\u2019t mean that I suddenly have some talent.\u201cYou just have to keep your hands on the scanner. Wait for about a minute.\u201dTo determine my talent, I will have to put my hands on a crystal ball, my talents will then be printed out on a tablet like magic tool the counselor held.There\u2019s nothing I have talent for.It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be able to see that I\u2019m a demon through this, right? Or see that I have that skill Demon Domination, right?I didn\u2019t think so. I had Sarkegaar\u2019s ring after all.Demon Domination was a unique skill of the Arcdemon race. It was completely sealed after I changed using the ring.Since it was an ability I could only use in the form of Valier, it should be hidden.Of course, it might not be as well.I should just run with the ring.Let\u2019s just go back and think about how to change my looks next.Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hm?\u201dThe counselor suddenly tapped on the tablet. Was it that thing were you continue to tap on an iPad when it\u2019s not working properly?\u201cDid you find something?\u201dAt Daibun\u2019s question, they shook their head.\u201cUrg\u2026. My apologies. It seems that it\u2019s broken. This item is only rarely used here.\u201dThey left the counseling room as if they didn\u2019t even know how that tool worked as they were actually more used to dealing with the wealthy, but didn\u2019t have any experience checking for talent. They said, they\u2019d bring a new tool over.\u201cDidn\u2019t they find something?\u201dI shook my head at the expectant Daibun.\u201cNo way.\u201dI checked my status again, but, of course, I couldn\u2019t find a single talent in it. I knew my condition better than any magic tool could.\u201cI brought a new one. I even checked its functionality, so it should work this time.\u201dIt seemed like the counselor was gradually getting exhausted. It probably was because we caused them extra work just for someone who had no talent at all.I put my hand on the newly arrived crystal ball.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd, the counselor was speechless.\u201cWhat\u2026.Is it malfunctioning again?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThe counselor furrowed their brows.\u201cHow strange. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before.\u201dPerhaps because they were bewildered, but the counselor spoke informally this time.\u201cIs it something that breaks easily?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a very complicated tool after all.\u201dAs if he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on, the counselor showed the corresponding part of the tablet screen to Daibun.Should I even call it a screen? It kept blinking. I kind of wanted to know what characters it displayed and why it just kept blinking. What was this, was that a talent? Do I have the talent to break machines? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I didn\u2019t have that kind of talent?That\u2019s one of the shittiest, most common talents I had ever heard of! It was as bad as that kitchen disaster attribute, it was so common that it wasn\u2019t even used anymore, but now when it gets mentioned, it feels rather novel, but it was still hella old-fashioned, you hear!Don\u2019t give me that!The counselor asked me to put my hands down and put his own on the crystal.\u201c\u2026\u2026Looks like the tool is working normally.\u201dThe counselor then asked Daibun if he had his talents measured before, then told him to put his hands on it this time.\u201cCertainly, the tool has no defects.\u201dThat screen blinked so much, it was apparent that I was the cause. The counselor asked me to put my hand back on the crystal.\u201cJust hold your hands on it for a second this time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhat the hell?I held my hands on the crystal ball for circa a second as I was told. The tablet screen was again blinking wildly. Soon after, the counselor opened their mouth speechlessly.\u201cWhat\u2026. I think I know now. In that case\u2026 There were all sorts of cases before, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dDaibun approached the counselor with an excited expression on his face.\u201cThere are cases where a subject doesn\u2019t show a specific talent, but \u2018aptitude\u2019. For example, it\u2019s not developed enough to be a talent, but if the subject works hard, they would be able to be outstanding it a certain field\u2026. It\u2019s a kind of sub-concept of talent.\u201d\u201cAptitude?\u201dAh, I knew what that was.\u201cFor example, someone with an aptitude for swordsmanship would be better in learning swordsmanship than archery or spearmanship. If a person with an aptitude for swordsmanship continued to study swordsmanship, he or she may become very gifted with the sword, or even excel more than someone who has talent in it, even if it isn\u2019t a talent.\u201d\u201cSo what does all that mean?\u201dDaibun was excited.\u201cThis device can read not only talent, but also what field the subject has an aptitude for. So they have this kind of service at the counseling center\u2026 Even if a child doesn\u2019t have a talent, they will tell them what aptitudes they have. It was rare for a child who doesn\u2019t have talent to not have any aptitude as well\u2026.\u201dIdentifying aptitudes.There were people who came from far away to receive counseling for the Temple admission, so even if the child wasn\u2019t a genius, they will tell them what route would fit the child best.\u2018Your child has no talent.However, since he has aptitudes in these and other areas, please make him study this and this.\u2019Temple seemed to provide that kind of service.The counselor turned the tablet screen and showed it to Daibun. It seemed that this was the first time that for them witnessing such a case.Swordsmanship aptitude, Archery aptitude, Magic aptitude, Magic Sensitivity aptitude, Spiritual aptitude\u2026\u2026.The screen was filled, showing all the aptitudes I had.\u201cIt seems that Reinhardt was born with an aptitude for everything in the world.\u201dThe screen wasn\u2019t blinkin.My aptitudes were almost infinite, so the screen was just constantly updating.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24\u201cI really don\u2019t have any idea what to call this. Were you born with God\u2019s blessing\u2026. Or was this some type of supernatural power\u2026?\u201dThe counselor looked puzzled.However, I knew what caused this.I could certainly force an ability that I originally didn\u2019t have to become my talent using achievement points. Even if I didn\u2019t have enough points to do that, the possibility was still there.Therefore, I was currently in a state where I could have all the talents in the world. I was born possessing every aptitude in existence, so that it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for me to get certain talents.The counselor seemed dumbfounded.\u201cIn this case\u2026. I don\u2019t know if it would be possible. Having an aptitude in both swordsmanship and archery wasn\u2019t really a problem, but if this data is correct, then Reinhardt can use both black magic and divine power.\u201dI could both wield the power of darkness, as well as holy power. Of course, it would be impossible to be able to use both of them at the same time, but it was possible for me.\u201cB, by the way\u2026. There has never been a case\u2026 that a child was granted a special admission only based on their aptitude a, and not on talent\u2026\u2026\u201dThe counselor seemed to think that this wasn\u2019t a problem he could solve with his authority alone.\u201cThen he could be admitted to Temple, right?\u201dDaibun seemed to block out the details and only heard what he wanted to hear.\u201cThi, this is such an unprecedented situation, but as this is such a special case\u2026.\u201dThe counselor blankly nodded their head.\u201cPerhaps, I think.\u201d\u201cGood for you, man!\u201d-Hits!\u201cUrgh!\u201dDaibun slapped me on the back and shouted.That almost killed me!In the end, it seemed it was just a delusion that I knew my condition best.Through Daibun\u2019s useless insistence, I could now see for sure what my condition was like.I didn\u2019t know something like this would happen.* * *\u201cAn aptitude for everything?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what they said.\u201dLoyar\u2019s eyes widened when I told her the inspection\u2019s results.It wasn\u2019t over just with the counselor\u2019s words, after that a professional wizard appeared to precisely check my talents. So after suffering for a while it was confirmed that the judgement on my aptitudes was true.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that a lot more than we expected?\u201dThat\u2019s what she said, but I could feel the tremendous admiration in her words. Even the previous Demon King wouldn\u2019t have been like that. Although I had no talent, I was born with the aptitude to acquire talents in any field.This may just be a correction caused by being able to interfere with my body using this system, but that correction in itself was already a tremendous ability.These aptitudes included even opposing aptitudes.It was possible for a person who had no talent or aptitude for swordsmanship to become a master swordsman by training swordsmanship, however it would be very difficult.One had to overcome this wall with effort.But why would a person who had no aptitude for it train swordsmanship? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just wake up from those delusions?No one could just have strengths. Even those geniuses who had many aptitudes and talents had also a good amount of inadequacies.For example, if a person had an aptitude for divine powers, of course, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use black magic. Conversely, a person who had an aptitude for black magic would not be able to learn divine magic. Some abilities rejected their counterparts.But I didn\u2019t have a single inadequacy.Of course, I didn\u2019t know if it was possible to give myself inadequacies, but like hell that\u2019s going to happen. Am I crazy?I went to Temple with the intention of paying the tuition for a semester, but ended up on a\u00a0completely different path.I\u2019d have to return to the admissions office sometime later, but I\u2019ve been told that they\u2019ll most likely decided on granting special admission. I didn\u2019t think much of it right now, but if there\u2019s some guy capable of being good at anything, it would be rather weird to not let him enroll through special admission.This was an unexpected windfall. Just because they decided to let me enroll through special admission we didn\u2019t have to create a hole in the gang\u2019s funds.There was no more need to to leave traces behind by paying the tuition with their money. Everyone wanted me to have an environment in which I could completely focus on improving myself in Temple. Like this everyone would be satisfied.No matter what happened later with the Rotary gang, it wouldn\u2019t affect me.\u201cBut you don\u2019t look very good, though?\u201dI smiled at Daibun\u2019s words.\u201cN, no, it\u2019s nothing. This is great. Like this I can enter even without being part of the gang.\u201dBut just as Daibun said, I wasn\u2019t in such a good mood.Originally, my plan was to gradually develop my talents over a semester and then I was planning to be exempted from tuition leading me to join the main story through said talent.However, in terms of development, I might have a higher chance to enter the main story like this rather than as a simple scholarship student..Temple had two types of special classes.The Royal Class, which one could enter through talent, and the Orbis Class, which one could enter through skill.Students with exceptional talent entered the Royal Class.Students who lack talent but gained outstanding abilities through hard work entered the Orbis Class.There was a certain rivalry between these two classes, but that would come into play later. It would be only after a long time that the Orbis Class was mentioned.Anyway.Entering the main story meant that I would soon join one of Temple\u2019s special classes, which will probably be the Royal Class.There was a high chance that I would enter the Royal Class, because I was recognized for my potential talent and not my outstanding ability.Originally, I planned to slowly enter the story by building my power for one semester and then climb to that position later.However, I would end up entering the Royal Class right from the beginning.That meant, that I would be together with the main characters right when the main story starts. I would bump into them without thinking much or planning to do so. If the story changed because of my actions, I would receive some achievement points, but the consequence of that would be that the story might bounce into weird directions, all the events would become unpredictable.I would have to use the achievement points I received by changing the future to see how the future changed, I would gain nothing from that. I could get other benefits, but those achievement points are the most important to me right now, so I couldn\u2019t just waste them.That\u2019s why I wanted to take that one semester to plan things out, but that opportunity got stolen from me.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dTherefore, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh deeply thinking about the special admission.Anyway,I was pretty sure this development is happening purposefully.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *What kind of novel was [The Demon King is Dead] you may ask?Although it was a novel I wrote, it was more like part of my dark history though. It got the worst ranking and tons of bad reviews.This was supposed to be a slice-of-life story that took place after the Demon King got defeated. The story took place in [Temple], located in the Imperial Capital Gardium, where people with immense power and wealth gathered.Although they nurtured talents specialized in combat, teaching things like magic and marital arts, Temple, who was recognized as the cradle of all learning, also encompassed elementary, secondary and higher education.The number of students, excluding the faculty, exceeded 100,000.From elementary school onwards, they adopted a similar teaching system as universities. On could apply for classes one wanted to take. Therefore, there were a lot of kids who never ran into each other even though they were in the same class if they don\u2019t take the same courses.Even in a place like that, the main stage was the Royal Class, one of the two most important classes in Temple, the other one being the Orbis Class.Those two classes were filled with the most talented of the Empire, the ones placed the most expectations on. Of course, they all held permanent scholarships. However, let\u2019s keep the Orbis Class out of this talk for now. I won\u2019t run into them anyway, for the time being.Anyway, one of the two flagships of Temple.Royal Class\u2019 Perks.Even if a course is already filled to capacity, one may still apply for said course. Even courses that go beyond one\u2019s grade could be applied for, as consideration for the geniuses. Therefore, the Royal Class was inevitably the object of envy and jealousy of ordinary students.In addition, Temple shoulders the cost to maintain a certain level of dignity as well as a luxurious dormitory exclusive to the students of the Royal Class.There were many who tried to get into the Royal Class using their money and power. However, one could only enter Temple through money, however the Royal Class didn\u2019t know status, rank or wealth. Only talent determined whether one could enter or not.Higher education at Temple started with high school.It didn\u2019t end there.Temple\u2019s higher education, including the Royal Class, consisted of 6 grades just like elementary school.That meant that a 6th\u00a0grade Highschooler wasn\u2019t that uncommon in this world.Simply but, it was like graduating from middle school and then immediately attending collage for six years.In realtiy, it was more like starting from the first year of high school and ending with the third year of college. Of course, it was possible to attend for three years and then graduate, but the education is usually completed after the sixth year. After that, there\u2019s university, but that was more like a graduate school.The Royal Class, that could be said to be the best of the best, divided the classes based on talent. The main character belonged to 1st\u00a0year Class B of the high school section.What was different about this was that the Royal Class, which selected people based on talent, divided the grades based on talents in the early stages of high school.That meant between Class A and Class B of the Royal Class, Class B was the inferior class, which was made up of children with lower ranking talents.Since the class was divided in order of talent, the members of the Royal Class remained the same even when they reached the next grade. Unless someone got eliminated or dropped out in the middle, or a person was added, the number of classmates didn\u2019t change from the first year of high school until graduation.Class B, who was the inferior group of talented elites, is where the main character appeared. He first got confused by his defeat-ridden classmates, endured humiliation and ridicule from the kids of Class A who were more talented and powerful and eventually they were able to overtake Class A with the power of love and friendship. That\u2019s the kind of youth drama I was planning to write.Not interesting at all? Sounds like it was no fun to read?Of course, it was hella boring.Stories about weaker students overcoming stronger students through hard work was rather common and nothing new. The Power of Love and Friendship? People are doing well on their own these days. If you let your classmates suck away your own life like carcinogens, they\u2019ll think their hot shit after you cared for them and helped them grow.I should have stopped writing right away after hearing what the person in charge told me.Anyway.It was now February.The main story would also start with the new semester in the same year as the end of the Demon World War.[You have been admitted to Temple Royal Class 1-A.]And, the Temple Admissions Office judged my \u2018infinite aptitude\u2019 to be an advanced talent.There was nothing really good about that.Class A would be the place I\u2019d receive my education in later.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cAre you worried?\u201dI was currently at Eleris\u2019 scroll shop.\u201cI\u2019d lie if I said no.\u201dI sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that they think I have some crazy talent. Being able to get in through special admission is also good, but it seems difficult to actually meet these expectations as fast as they hope\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have to be around the Bronzegate Bridge all day, so I went to visit Eleris. The Rotary gang was also relieved of its financial pressure thanks to me getting in through special admission.So until the entrance ceremony I was going back and forth between Bronzegate and Eleris\u2019 scroll shop.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do a good job.\u201dEleris gave me reassuring smile. Yeah, I could become anything. I knew that I was just nervous because I was nothing and hadn\u2019t done anything yet.Thanks to my aptitudes, which were judged as an advanced talent, I was able to bypass numerous procedures required for admission. If one had a highest-ranking talent, Temple didn\u2019t simply admit the student, rather they just take them in. That was why all the sloppy parts about my identity and origin were just glossed over.Rather, Temple itself became my guardian.Things worked out incredibly well. However, even if things worked out somehow, there was a definite future, so thinking about my friends from Class A made my head hurt.Above all else, living in the dormitory without Eleris, Loyar or Sarkegaar who were practically my guardians, was one more reason for my nervousness.In general, there\u2019s this widespread opinion that accidents did not happen at Temple.However, as a writer, I mean, I did add in many incidents to happen. I was well aware how sloppy Temple was, or rather than knowing, I made it that way.Eleris grabbed my hand while I was lost in my thoughts. The vampire\u2019s low body temperature felt unfamiliar, but at some point that coldness started to feel like warmth.\u201cWe will support Your Highness with all our heart. And even if you enter Temple, does that mean that you are banned from going out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not, but still\u2026.\u201dThey wouldn\u2019t ban me from going out or something.If I wanted to see them I could come out and visit Sarkegaar, Loyar or Eleris.\u201cAnyway, are there any things you need to take with you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have that many things. I would wear a school uniform most of the time anyway though.\u201dI would have to go to the dormitory tomorrow, so I had to take something there, but I didn\u2019t know what I should bring because I\u2019m literally in a position where I have nothing on me but my clothes.As I filled out various forms before my admission, and was told everything I needed to know, I didn\u2019t really think I need to take much.\u201cBy the way, why did you want me to enter Temple?\u201dI asked the question I couldn\u2019t find the answer to the other day.Eleris didn\u2019t want me to become stronger, but she still encouraged me to go to Temple. Eleris smiled at my question.\u201cBecause I think if you were to stay close to humans, you would come to love them.\u201dThis was a slightly different logic from Sarkegaar, who wanted me to get to know humans to use their knowledge against them.Eleris seemed to want me to get to love them.Well, I mean I didn\u2019t feel any real love towards humanity in the first place.\u201cYou might regret this later.\u201dEleris laughed at my words.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it when the time comes.\u201dThe strangest one of the bunch wasn\u2019t actually Sarkegaar, but Eleris. She brought over a trunk from somewhere.Rather she summoned it here with a snap rather than bringing it over.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThese are plain clothes you can wear. You can\u2019t just wear your uniform all the time.\u201dIt seemed like she didn\u2019t want to send me off empty handed. Eleris then took off her necklace and put it around my neck.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you remember that I called myself Tuesday?\u201d\u201cAh, I do.\u201dI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant, but was it something about that seven nights something?\u201cI believe you have forgotten about this as well, so let me explain. There are seven vampire clans who call themselves the Houses of the Seven Nights.\u201d\u201cMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, like that?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201dThose were pretty simple names.\u201cEach Family specialized in the magic type of the corresponding element.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s elemental magic based on the days of the weak?\u201d\u201cYes, the Monday and Sunday clan disappeared a long time ago, so it didn\u2019t get handed down which type of magic they held, but Tuesday is fire, Wednesday is water, Thursday is wood, Friday is metal and Saturday is earth.\u201d(T/N: To carlify, this is based on the Hanja of the words for the days of the week. Each day except Monday and Sunday have a type of element in their name as mentioned by Eleris here. \u6708\u66dc , \u706b\u66dc , \u6c34\u66dc , \u6728\u66dc , \u571f\u66dc , \u65e5\u66dc )While I still could kind of understand the power of the moon, I couldn\u2019t even imagine how vampires could use something like sun magic. Since Vampire Lords could withstand sunlight, maybe it wasn\u2019t that strange that that clan could use solar magic.\u201cThis is an heirloom of our clan and the symbol of our house, the \u2018Flame of Tuesday\u2019.The necklace Eleris gave me held a small golden pendant studded with a blood drop like ruby.\u201cEleris, then, does that mean\u2026. They call the heads of a clan Vampire Lords?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it would be, but\u2026.\u201dEleris seemed to be one of the most powerful Vampires and yet it still wasn\u2019t easy for her to stay out in the sun, even though it\u2019s not to the point of impossibility.\u201cSo, why did you give me this necklace\u2026.?\u201d\u201cIf this ring harbours the power of the Dreadfiends, what do you think this pendant could do?\u201dA pendant harbouring the power of a clan that specialized in fire magic.\u201cIt will enable me to use fire magic, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, it would only work within the confines of Your Highness amount of mana. It\u2019s a little different from Sarkegaar\u2019s ring. You\u2019d be able to summon flames just by using mana, no need for complicated chants.\u201dI didn\u2019t understand it fully, but just hearing her explanation just made me realize what a ridiculous item this was.Magic was a power only geniuses could use. This thing enabled even an idiot to summon flames if they have enough mana.Scrolls were only one-time use items, but with this I\u2019d be able to permanently use this magic.A great treasure, indeed.\u201cDo you want to try it out?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dBy using the Flame of Tuesday I could use fire magic. My mana level was at 9.9 as far as I could remember. I knew that this was quite high for someone my age.I held the pendant in my hand and imagined flames in my head, just like Eleris told me a second ago.-Flare!Then a Flame appeared in front of my eyes.\u201cThis is how it works.\u201d\u201cBut only this much?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect something of the leven of a fireball to appear, but this was just on the level of a lighter flame. Did I actually have as much mana as a rat maybe?\u201cYour Highness isn\u2019t able to make full use of your mana yet. If you learn powers related to magic sensitivity or magic control, you would be able to create more powerful flames with the same amount of mana.\u201dSo in the end that\u2019s all I could do with this powerful treasure due to my lack of ability.\u201cWhy are you giving me this?\u201d\u201cThere might be some emergencies in which Your Highness wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything, so having this would be advantageous, right?\u201dI didn\u2019t really know what I could do with a lighter flame though.\u201cStill, something like the symbol of your clan\u2026. Can you just give me something like that?\u201d\u201cIf I gave you something of similar value to what Sarkegaar gave you, wouldn\u2019t the chances increase that you\u2019ll stand on my side in the future?\u201dEleris spoke while laughing jokingly. Sarkegaar and Eleris both gave me their family\u2019s heirlooms.It was quite funny.Sarkegaar, the one that wanted war, gave me something that would help me live a peaceful life in the human world.The pacifist Eleris, on the other hand, gave me an item related to destruction.\u201cAlso, it would be rather shameless to proudly wield that place\u2019s items while deciding to betray them.\u201dEleris seemed to want to relinquish all the responsibilities and obligations she held as a Clan Head as well as the last member of the Tuesday Clan with this. It seemed like Demons couldn\u2019t let go of their families even while betraying them.\u201cI just have one thing to ask.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIf I use this, just this little flame comes out, but what would happen if you were to use this?\u201dI was just able to produce a flame the size of a lighter flame. The simplification of the magic chant would be a tremendous thing for a wizard, rather than someone as ignorant as me.So how much power could this little thing exert in the hands of someone like Eleris?\u201cI don\u2019t know, because I\u2019ve never used this before.\u201dOne could tell just by looking into her eyes that she was lying.It seems like there were some painful memories resurfacing in her, but I saw that this pain only briefly passed by her eyes. Eleris told me one last thing, looking straight into my eyes, holding my shoulders.\u201cYour Highness, this is by no means a good item.\u201dEleris didn\u2019t seem to appreciate this heirloom called Flame of Tuesday.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an object that responds to darker emotions. The more malice you hold against someone the greater the flame would be.\u201dThis seemed to be something I should be careful about while using.An object that could sense its owner\u2019s emotions, especially hostility and malice. It was an item that completely fit the preconceived image humans had of demons.\u201cI hope you\u2019ll understand why I offered the Flame of Tuesday to you.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want me to hurt anyone, but she was worried about me so she gave me something like that.If something happened at Temple, I should only use this if I was in a life-threatening situation.That\u2019s what Eleris meant.Eleris was afraid of me, but she valued me just as much.\u201cThank you, I plan to never use this until I graduate.\u201dEleris smiled brightly, as this was what she wanted to hear the most.She really was the weirdest one.* * *The Heirloom of the Dreadfiend clan.The Heirloom of the Tuesday clan, which was part of the Seven Nights.I was the only heir to the Darklands, the Demon Realm that got unified as one nation, so it wasn\u2019t so strange for me to hold these items.Still, a beggar-turned-Temple student was now in possession of two great relics of the imperial level.That definitely was suspicious.The ring, of course, was a camouflage item, so it had transparency and dematerialization magic properties on its own, so it just looked like an ordinary metal ring, and Eleris put an old looking metal case around the exterior of the pendant that otherwise looked precious. It certainly seemed like the better option to put a normal looking casing around it than camouflage magic that might get detected. So in the end all I had was what looked like a worn-out ring and pendant. To be honest, I\u2019d believe it if someone told me these things were picked up by a beggar wandering around.Since I received some amazing items from both Eleris and Sarkegaar, I had the thought that Loyar might give me something as well, but then again how could I expect anything great from someone wearing rags, chilling around a bonfire all day? She should just take good care of herself and eat well.That was what I thought, but\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026What is this?\u201d\u201cPocket money.\u201dLoyar handed me a bag of gold coins to use at Temple.Loyar told me to tell her if I needed any more money, because the issue of the admission fee got solved anyway, and Temple would only pay for some of my living costs.Loyar was the most important instance to me in the long run.It seemed that their progress of spreading their power to the mana trains was going smoothly.Tomorrow, I\u2019d finally move into Temple\u2019s dormitory.Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be good for me to continue living here, but I was exhausted just thinking about moving into an environment I knew nothing much about, filled with major characters.It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad just living at Eleris\u2019 place.I couldn\u2019t fall asleep that night, maybe because I was just thinking about all the trouble this would bring.However, I made a promise.I was going to do the things I set out to do and I would do them well.I felt it in Charlotte\u2019s case.It wasn\u2019t such a bad thing saving someone who was supposed to die.As a result, I could save people who died because of my karma. If you asked me, I believed this to be a good thing.This was a slice-of-life story.But even slice-of-life stories were written by people who were talented in that field.So the biggest reason for this novel\u2019s failure, the reason all the readers who kept going until the middle of it fell away, was\u2026I didn\u2019t have the talent for writing these kinds of stories until the very end. As the events and materials I had planned out were depleted, my writing lost its way and as a result I lost my motivation to move the story forward.Therefore.I just flipped the table.This crazy novel only came into being because of the author\u2019s lack of ability to create any more events.\u2026In the middle of that story\u2026\u2026I made Gates suddenly opened.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25This was called self-satisfaction.Naturally, the readers dropped the novel in disgust of that sudden development. But what should I have done? At the time I thought that would be the best development. Of course, it would have been better if I had just ran away, leaving it unfinished as usual, but then I had a sudden compulsion to complete it somehow.If you do stupid things, one day you will end up paying for them.Because of that crazy development, I now had to eat the shit I produced myself. So whether I liked it or not, that chaotic situation in which gates suddenly opened in this world, sending this world to ruin was approaching with every moment.It was a slice-of-life story for one half and the other was some weird Gate diving story.I now had three options.I could wait for the ending to come in a safe place, ignoring the fact that I had knowledge about these Gates.I could train until I got to a state where I could fight before the Gates opened and jump right into the situation.And lastly.I could eliminate the situation of the Gates opening by using the \u201cRewriting\u201d Function.For the second option I didn\u2019t really have to join Temple, but the third option absolutely required me to be part of the main story to get achievement points.As I had already experienced several life or death situations in the prologue part, I had no confidence whatsoever in fighting or seeing someone die right in front of me, so I had no other choice but to somehow prepare for the Gate situation.If it were up to me I\u2019d choose to hide somewhere and just watch the fire slowly burning out without concerning myself with it.Even though it was cowardly, my life was more precious.However, Sarkegaar, Loyar and Eleris had pushed me away from that. As my excuses were blocked one by one, I had no other choice but to give up.Anyway, if this reality really is the shit I made, I had to take some responsibility. It\u2019s impossible for me to take full responsibility, but if I were able to do something about a given situation, I should absolutely do that.I didn\u2019t know if it were possible to stop the Gates from opening. It was probably impossible.If that didn\u2019t work, then I had to become stronger through achievement points and decimate the monsters coming out of the Gate.So, anyway, part because of my own self-righteousness, I somehow had to do something about this future only I knew about\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI arrived at the first page of the main story.Temple.I had to either become the strongest on the continent, or somehow get rid of that Gate situation. Or I might end up with useless talents, that were neither this nor that.I wasn\u2019t even good at the things I liked, so should I try harder on things I didn\u2019t like then?Cold sweat ran down my face.* * *Temple was divided into three main sections: the elementary, secondary, and higher education facilities. 6 years of elementary school, three years of middle school and 6 years of highschool. There was also a graduate school for further education.Of course, there were numerous subsidiary facilities and special purpose halls scattered here and there. In other words, there were stadiums and other special facilities, including concert halls.As the campus was just too large to traverse by foot, Temple also had a separate tram line that only operated inside of it. Of course, it was free.Entering Temple for the first time, I was able to get inside with my pre-issued student ID including my admission permit.The vast campus of Temple accentuated by the blue sky spread out in front of me. It didn\u2019t really just feel like my imagination came to life.\u201cHuh.\u201dIt was much grander, much bigger and neater than I imagined, so I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. There was no way after all that I could picture this with just those limited written descriptions I gave.Among countless students wearing various uniforms coming and going, I stood blankly at the entrance, not knowing whether I should call this feeling I felt, being astonished or being moved.There were many different school forms in Temple, so I created this set-up of there being diverse uniforms, but seeing that variety right in front of me felt strange.The statues and street lamps placed beside the huge park-like streets, as well as the various educational facilities, seemed more like independent works of art rather than school decorations.The tram was also just running quietly along the tracks built on this huge campus.It was a mix between the Classical and the Modern, and in a way, it was a kind of disorder only I was aware of.Now wasn\u2019t the time for that though. I could admire it later.The place I should be heading to is the Royal Class\u2019 dormitory near the higher education facilities.As there were more than 100000 students, the dormitory facilities were bound to be enormous.The Royal Class of the Department of Higher Education had about 20 students per grade, and the high school segment had six grades, so there were 120 students in the Department of Higher Education in total.That was a fairly small number. This also showed that only very few people actually had talents.So the class I would be entering had on average of 10 students in each class. 20 students would be divided into class A and B. Although I got added in later, so there would probably be 21 students this time.I got off the Temple-owned tram at the place written in the guide.As soon as I got off, I saw a ramp lined with columns leading to the dormitory building.It felt incomprehensible to me how this 7-story dormitory only housed around 120 people.It was unbelievably huge. Although I wrote \u2018They receive great preferential treatment!\u2019, however, seeing this with my own eyes I began questioning if this was really okay. I didn\u2019t think that even a high-ranking lord could live in a place like this, you know?I was both bitter and happy because of the many things I wrote into my novel.I walked between those columns. As their shadows flitted past me at a regular pace I started feeling more and more nervous without realizing it. I felt like I was about to enter a place I wasn\u2019t supposed to enter.I thought it would be rather burdensome if I continued to feel this way everyday. Let\u2019s forget about the Bronzegate Underground Sewers, but Eleris\u2019 scroll shop was much more comfortable compared to this.Upon going through the entrance of the dormitory located at the end of the\u00a0colonnade, I could see a high dome-shaped ceiling, looking up, and a marble staircase leading to the upper floors.The lobby was communal and was connected to the 1st and 2nd floor through the staircase on the left and right. I knew this because I set it up like that..The 1st floor was for the 1st years, the 2nd floor was for the 2nd years, etc.Therefore, as their grade goes up, students become more and more annoyed. Of course, I wrote that there was something similar to an elevator. It worked with floating magic or something like that.\u00a0 The thing in the middle of the dome seemed to be that elevator.Looking at the structure of the building, the rooms for Class A were on the left and those for Class B were on the right. All the students belonging to Class A regardless of grade lived on the left side. The same went for Class B and the right side.I roughly knew what was going to happen from this point on.\u201cYou\u2019re a freshman, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dA senior student, wearing the same uniform as me, approached me with a file folder.A person wearing a female uniform\u2026.\u201cI\u2019m Ceres Van Owen, a 5th grader and the president of the Royal Class Student Council. Hello?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Hello.\u201dYes, that\u2019s how it was. Although the Department of Higher Education had an overall student body president and vice president, each school had their own separate student body president and vice president.Therefore, the Royal Class had its own student council president and vice president.The number of students the student council had to manage was enormous, so they had a lot of authority. To begin with, there were more than 50000 students who were part of the Department of Higher Education.However, the authority of the Royal Class Student Council, which had less than one-hundredth of the High School section\u2019s total number of students, was also quite high. This was the Royal Class after all, one of the the two pillars of Temple, and not some regular school.Of course, due to the relatively smaller number of members, the Royal Class Student Council had no other choice but to help out with certain things.Like guiding new students.No matter how well received they were from outsiders, there was no denying that there was a shortage of manpower within the Royal Class.I handed my Student ID to the senior student who introduced herself as the student council president and she looked through her files looking for my name.\u201cReinhardt, no last name\u2026. Class 1-A. You are assigned room A-11. Let\u2019s get along from now on.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dShe reached out her hand and I grabbed it. Students of the 5th grade of High School were already adults since they were 21 years old.The student council president in front of me would be in her last year next year and would probably be busy, so we probably wouldn\u2019t have many contact points. However, leaving a good impression was never wrong.Regardless of her actual skills, the Royal Class Student Council President was the most powerful person in this dormitory after the faculty. She had a lot of real power. Then she spoke to me with a smile.\u201cPerhaps after everyone arrives, they\u2019ll make you gather in the central lobby to give a brief reception and some warnings. It\u2019s okay to take a short rest after you unpack everything, but don\u2019t fall asleep too deeply if you decide to. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI dragged my suitcase behind me and headed for the hallway on the left. The sunlight trickling through the window intertwined with the shadows formed a complicated net on the floor. I never imagined I\u2019d see a scene like this in my whole life.As soon as I passed the main lobby, a lobby dedicated to Class 1-A appeared before me. Although it was smaller than the other one, it was still a formidable hall equipped with sofas, tables and reading tables where one could sit down at and relax.That was where the kids of Class B got together, ate snacks, chatted and conspired, although that refered to the lobby on the opposite side.Starting from this hall there were corridors leading to the dormitory, the magic lab, the reading room, the indoor gym and many more additional facilities including a restaurant. It kind of served as a hub. The main hub would probably be the main lobby.There were some facilities added as one rose in grade, but they were mostly similar in layout.Now that I came to a place I could properly recognize in this world I felt more comfortable, but in the end, I was still missing the details so there was still some awkwardness left in me.It was a complicated feeling that was difficult to describe.I entered the hallway leading to the dormitory and headed for room A-11. Just by tagging my student ID, the door opened immediately. That wasn\u2019t new to me. Everything was just powered with magic.This room was quite large for a single person. There was a neatly arranged bed, a large wardrobe and windows. There was even an indoor shower facility. The inside of the room wasn\u2019t as fancy as the outside, but was designed with a clean, modern feel to it. Rather, this was much more convenient. If it were too flashy it would just hurt my eyes.Currently only the basics were present in this room, but if a student requested for it other things would be added. Whether it was training equipment for physical training or a magic research lab. As long as it was within Temple\u2019s power anything could be added to this room.This was the best environment in which one could completely focus on developing one\u2019s talents without having to worry about other things.When I opened the closet, I found many uniforms custom made to fit me hanging in it. This was a service ordinary students at Temple could only dream of.I took my things out of the suitcase and put them into the closet one by one. I didn\u2019t even bring that many things because I could get anything I needed just by asking for them.The thing I should always carry with me is the ring of the Dreadfiend clan and the Flame of Tuesday in case for unforeseen emergencies.After unpacking my belongings, I lay down on the bed.I didn\u2019t know how much earlier I arrived, but I was the only one that got off at the Royal Class Dorm station.Once all the students arrived, I had to face both the students of Class A and Class B when the student council summoned us. They said it would just be a simple reception, so more like a greeting and not a party.There I would get to see all the characters I had written.However, there was something that\u2019s been bothering me.My room.Room A-11.Temple was a place that liked to rank people. Of course, the room number wasn\u2019t just randomly given out. Room A-11 meant that the admission office saw my \u201ctalent\u201d as the lowest among the First-Year Class-A talents.Yes, me becoming part of Class-A was a miracle in itself. I had no talent at all after all, although my aptitudes were infinite.I was put into Temple\u2019s Royal Class, which was divided into Class A and B, and there I was, the lowest ranking one in Class A.What the hell?I could already imagine what kinds of disputes I will fall into.Oh, you\u2019re that \u2018infinite aptitude\u2019 guy I\u2019ve heard about? But aren\u2019t you actually all squishy?Hey, hey, aren\u2019t you just weak?You\u2019re in Class A? How the hell did that happen?I thought I\u2019d probably get to hear stuff like that.Haah.I would have rather gone to Class B.Sigh, would I be beaten up by students higher ranking than me?I didn\u2019t want to be first or last. It\u2019s just that this strange situation itself was like dogshit.And I didn\u2019t know if things would go well or not.It seemed that no one fell in rank because of me at least.Obviously, Class A and Class B were set to have 10 people in them, but here I was, number 11. So that meant that I came in as a member outside of the original quota.Wouldn\u2019t it be fine if some hot headed idiot got dropped out? Wasn\u2019t there someone like that, who would get kicked to make place for me?No, wait, they might have ended up going down the list and pushing someone important out. Thank god, it was the way it was.I could see various people getting off the mana train in the distance from my window. It seemed like they were arriving one by one.If my guess was true.There obviously would be things happening that deviated significantly from the first part right at the start.I wondered what would happen.I took out the notebook and writing instrument I had prepared.Let\u2019s get my thoughts in order. It would probably be hard for me to remember every single one and there might also be the possibility that there are some characters who had no presence so I didn\u2019t know them at all. There were some characters who only appeared in my setting notes and were otherwise like air. I set up all 20 students\u2019 personal details, but not all of them played a major part, because if all 20 of them played an important role my writing would have become a mess.Of course, my writing went to shit after the whole Gate opening thing in the middle.Anyway.Class A and B.I should organize the personal data of all the students that come to my mind.One, two, three.\u201c\u2026..\u201dBecause there were more than seven people, I couldn\u2019t seem to remember properly.My memory was just great\u2026.I worked my brain hard to figure out all the names of all the unused characters and organized them. Fortunately, although I couldn\u2019t remember all their names, I still knew what kind of people they were.* * *It was late afternoon or early evening.[All students of the Royal Class, please gather in the lobby. All students of the Royal Class, please gather in the lobby.]Finally, a broadcast calling for all the students of the Royal Class appeared. I came out of my room which was on the far left and was able to see the backs of my classmates walking around as they listened to the broadcast.Elite or whatever.I now had to act as a freshman in high school.As much as I thought, that I had to hurry up, my steps became heavier and heavier. I was already exhausted.The students of Class A and B gathered in the lobby on the first floor. The student council members stood on the high stairs that led up.And there were people on each floor leaning over the railings looking down on us. The 6th graders who were on the top floor, didn\u2019t even come out to look.But why did all the senior students decide to look at the new students coming this time?\u201cCome on, both Class A and Class B, line up in your room order, starting with number 1\u201dEveryone lined up at the student council president\u2019s words. They didn\u2019t have any discipline though. Well, they were kids after all. I was at the back of Class A.Normally the senior students shouldn\u2019t come to see the new students, which was a rare event every year.However, here they were looking at all of us. I already found something that was different right at the start.\u201cWell, shall we start with A-1?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Bertus de Gardias!\u201dJust hearing that name gave me goosebumps. Bertus de Gardias, I heard the voice of the man who almost caused my death serveral times.It was such a lively and bright voice for someone so evil.He didn\u2019t exude any form of authority and seemed like a hard worker.It was strange.Originally, Bertus entered Temple while hiding his identity, but now he was openly introducing himself with his last name. So the entirety of the Royal Class was aware of the fact that he was the Prince.So, originally, the other students shouldn\u2019t have been interested in the new students, but after hearing the news that the Prince entered the school, they became eager to come watch.The introductions continued. I simply said my name.Of course, no one paid any attention to me.\u201cNow then, shall we start the introductions of Class B? Now, B-1, could you introduce yourself to your friends?\u201dIt immediately became clear to me why the direction of this event\u2019s progress was different from the original one..\u201cI am Charlotte de Gardias.\u201dSomeone who shouldn\u2019t have been here.Charlotte was in Temple\u2019s Royal Class.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26The Imperial Prince and the Imperial Princess both entered the Royal Class and joined the same grade. They announced that the princess was alive, but she never appeared in public.But then she suddenly entered Temple.Of course, Bertus was aware of her admission. He was also the main villain of the story. However, Bertus didn\u2019t use his authority to join the Royal Class.As he was a major character, I was, of course, able to give a brief outline of the character.Number A-1.Name: Bertus de Gardias.Talent: Swordsmanship, Magic Sensitivity, Magic Control.Characteristic : Narrow eyes. (T/N: Like those characters that never open their eyes of which a lot are kinda two faced)Remarks : A Bastard.In front of others, he acted kind and got along with everyone, however, he, in fact, was someone who did a lot of bad things when left alone. A bastard who was originally good, but explodes once he got angry. I didn\u2019t even think that he even had naturally narrow eyes.And those three simple talents.Swordsmanship, Magic Sensitivity, Magic Control.Those were talents Duke Salerian forced to bloom by spending a great deal of money on Bertus. Ever since he was young, he had to undergo countless surgeries in order to get these three talents. With money and power, talent could also be made to bloom by force. Although that was only possible if one were the Imperial Prince.So what were these three talents?After a long study conducted by the Empire on why someone wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the master-class even though they trained hard for a long time, they came to the following conclusion.A combat-related talent, magic sensitivity and magic control.It was almost impossible to reach the Master-class if one had no aptitude for any of those three. There were some who had talents in combat related weapon skills, but it was very rare to have an aptitude for magic sensitivity and control at the same time. If having them as aptitudes was rare already, then, of course, it was even rarer to have both as talents.However, Bertus had all three as talents, not as aptitudes. His talent was swordsmanship and magic sensitivity and control were essential requirements.To become a master in swordsmanship, that is.In other words, he would become a Swordmaster.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The Imperial Family was also getting educated at Temple. It was a kind of advertisement and proof of credibility. If one said Temple was the best educational facility in the world and then went and taught the Imperial Family separately, anyone would probably have doubts about the reliability of those words.However, in the Empire, the Imperial Family was also educated here.So it was no wonder that its reliability and safety skyrocketed. Of course, the Imperial Family could just get educated separately , but with them deciding to sned their children to receive their education at Temple, other people couldn\u2019t help but place their trust in its security.Were they also living in the dormitory?Needless to say.That was why so many sent their children to Temple with such confidence. Because they thought their children would be provided with the same level of education and safety as the Imperial Family.Bertus had already known about that.So he was expecting Charlotte to come to Temple to some extent.It was rumored that he would come to this place, so I was a little hesitant to come directly to the Royal Class and not as just another regular student. There was a high chance that I\u2019d be caught by that smart guy.The reason why the Duke forced his talent to bloom was because no one of the Imperial Family ever belonged to the Royal Class. A place that one could only enter through talent and not through power. If the Prince entered the Royal Class and graduated with excellent grades, he\u2019d be able to build enormous authority just by doing that.Naturally.Imperial Princess Charlotte de Gardias could use the same method. What was possible for the Prince wouldn\u2019t be impossible for Charlotte, the Imperial Princess, either.So there was a good chance for Charlotte to also possess a talent, enabling her to enter the Royal Class. However, even if she was first ranked, was her talent inferior as she was in Class B?Or.Did they intentionally separate these two? Both of them were in the position that corresponded to the leaders of Class A and B.No one knew about their circumstances, but I did.Bertus obviously had great talent, but it wasn\u2019t the number one talent. Even though he was fit for Class A, he actually should have been in the third or fourth spot if they really only considered his talent.His power intervened in this decision.Strictly speaking, it was the judgment of the faculty that if the Prince were to enter the Royal Class and ended up in the third or fourth seat, they might end up going against Bertus for nothing.It was difficult for power to influence this place, but there was no place that couldn\u2019t be influenced by it somehow. There were people who knew how to bootlick no matter where one went. In the first place, it was just an implicit rule to line up according to one\u2019s room number, not a written one. So Bertus didn\u2019t really have the number one talent, but just the number one position.So what was going on with Charlotte? I wasn\u2019t sure if she became number one of Class B because of her talent or because some faculty member or even someone higher up. I had no idea if there were instructions behind this.However, the result was presented in front of us.The semester that was about to start would be far from the pleasant school life I had planned.\u201cWelcome to Temple\u2019s Royal Class!\u201d\u2013Clap, clap, clap, clap.All the plans I made for the future had collapsed and the fight between Charlotte de Gardias and Bertus de Gardias was about inevitable.And here I was in Class A.I was on Bertus de Gardias\u2019 side.\u201cDid you say your name was Reinhardt? Let\u2019s do our best together!\u201dThe guy standing next to me spoke to me. Even if I didn\u2019t look at him, I knew exactly who he was. Since we all introduced ourselves already. However, even if he didn\u2019t introduce himself I would have known.B-11, the one that was originally supposed to be number 10.This was the historic moment of the last ranked of Class A and B meeting.\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dYou would do just fine on your own, the problem is me, you shitty main character.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Two people were added that originally weren\u2019t supposed to be here. One was me and the other was Charlotte.The story had already gone awry right at the start. It was like there were actually two writers to this story, the other making every change I made fit the narrative.That was probably how I even ended up having to fight the one I risked my life for at the side of the one who tried to kill me.Except for that short exchange I had, we didn\u2019t have to do something as troublesome as talking with these 100 plus students. The reception ended after everyone introduced themselves and everyone applauded.The student council president then announced the rules of the Royal Class to us.\u201cThose friends who have already received elementary and secondary education at Temple would know these things, but there are some among you who have just transferred here to the higher education division, so I shall explain.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, all students of Temple are equals, the Royal Class isn\u2019t an exception. All your classmates are to be treated the same. There are no ranks in Temple, except the relationship between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen. Wherever you came from, whether you\u2019re a noble, part of a royal family or even the Imperial Family. If we start looking at lineage like that, Temple wouldn\u2019t be able to operate like that, right?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a policy that came into existence because every student no matter where they came from had the right to a fair education and as such should be treated equally or something.It was made because Temple\u2019s system would become ridiculously complicated if they had to look into every student\u2019s lineage. There were kids coming from all over the continent after all.It would be possible to educate commoners, nobles, royalty and the Imperial Family separately, but things wouldn\u2019t end there. The nobles would say things like: \u201cI\u2019m a duke so how could I be placed in the same class as the mere son of a baron?\u201d and the royal families would go on to say: \u201cHow could I be placed in the same class as the prince of such a lowly kingdom?\u201d.There would be no end, if it were decided to separate the students based on lineage. There were just too many people coming here for that. Status brought identity with it, so even among the students of similar status, there would be tens of hundreds of class divisions, to the point students wouldn\u2019t even be able to study properly, grouped together based on their lineages and said things like: \u201cYou and I cannot eat together, your presence alone is insulting.\u201d, to each other.So Temple had this rule of students to not reveal their status in school, not because they cared that much about the students\u2019 rights and interests or tried to prohibit discrimination. If people starting arguing about lineage, Temple wouldn\u2019t even be able to exist in the first place.Of course, this might be a bit difficult for people of very high status.So those guys might not even come here.Or they joined because of the connections, knowledge and recognition they would gain by graduating from Temple.There were still people who would reveal their status at Temple and tried to take advantage of others even after being warned a few times, eventually they would get expelled. Members of the Imperial Family weren\u2019t an exception. It might be a bit shameful for the people of the Imperial Family, who were far up in terms of lineage, to have their children expelled after creating such a mess, but the Empire rather welcomed that. It served as another example of the fairness and greatness of Temple to every single person of the continent.As I mentioned before, Temple was a place that brought in a lot of money, and sometimes money is everything in the world.The student council president, Ceres van Owen, who was in front of me was also the rightful heiress to a Royal Family of a Principality located in the southern part of the Empire, although I couldn\u2019t even remember what the name of her country was anymore. Judging by her name, I thought it must have been called something like Owenia. Now that she was about to graduate from the Royal Class, she was sure to be greatly welcomed back when she returned home.Still, Imperial Family members of the Empire came to Temple, what was more these two were potential candidates to become the next emperor, and she just casually told them not to reveal their true identities and to get along with everyone.That\u2019s the Gardias Temple for you.It wasn\u2019t like there were any cases where someone retaliated later on for what happened at Temple, but these guys would get heavily criticized. Well, put simply, all personal resentments created in Temple should be buried in Temple. That was this school\u2019s rule.Of course, that also included romantic relationships. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a noble or someone of a royal family to fall in love with someone and then pretended not to know them or straight up ran away from their lover after graduating.\u201cThe rank you have outside of Temple is completely useless in here. You can act like a military god outside of Temple as much as you want, but if I ever see any of you do this on campus, I will have to give you a warning using the authority given to me as the student council president. If you have accumulated warnings beyond a certain amount, a faculty meeting will be held, where the disciplinary action taken against you will be decided upon. Don\u2019t even think for a second that everything will end in expulsion. In some cases it might lead to diplomatic problems or jail time. If that is the case, keep in mind that you are to be punished by the special law that Temple students are subjected to, and not according to your original status. Of course, you might have been granted immunity as each country has different laws, but you should keep in mind this won\u2019t apply in these situations. If you force your classmates to call you in a specific way or tell them that just looking in your eyes is seen as an insult would hardly make you seem like the one in the right here.\u201dThe president and vice-president had the authority to interfere with the students.If it was inside Temple, even if they were the heir to the throne, if they did something against the rules, they would be scolded by the president.Of course, they could get revenge against them because they felt offended, however, if the Imperial Family started interfering with the affairs of students at Temple, it would not only be childish, but it would also seriously tarnish Temple\u2019s honor, which was the Empire\u2019s source of enormous income and a landmark.Therefore, these two would faithfully follow Temple\u2019s rules. If they were to brandish their authority and power here, ignoring all the rules, it would just be like spitting in their own faces.Temple was the Empire\u2019s face along with the Imperial Family after all. Throwing insults into one\u2019s own face was pretty inefficient.\u201cAnother important thing. Do not intentionally drag what happened outside of Temple inside of it.\u201d\u201cFor example, using the various privileges that Temple students receive to commit crimes outside and then escape to Temple.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care if any of you were enemies outside of Temple or if there\u2019s some feud going on between your families. Temple is an educational institution, not a political arena. Competitiveness in good faith is permitted, but if you use unfair or unreasonable means or if external powers or forces intervene in these matters, the student concerned will be expelled and will be subject to numerous responsibilities.\u201dIn other words, don\u2019t drag outside powers into Temple. In the end, all these things she was telling us were more or less directed at Charlotte and Bertus.Everyone was secretly guessing that this would definitely play a part in the struggle for imperial power.\u201cAlso, there is a message from the Imperial Family Gardias. Originally, this wasn\u2019t allowed, but this situation is somewhat special in many ways, so I will read it out to you.\u201dYet another thing that hadn\u2019t existed before sprung into existence.The student council president opened a letter and read it out to us.\u201cFrom the moment this letter is read out, if any problems arise with either Charlotte de Gardias or Bertus de Gardias, both inside and outside of Temple, even if it is just a simple accident, the other party\u2019s rights to the throne will be permanently deprived. Emperor Neliod de Gardias, Grand Admiral.\u201dThe student council president turned the letter over and showed us that the seal of the Imperial Family properly stamped on it.The Emperor blocked any future attempts for them to assassinate each other.There was a reason why the two of them were pushed into the same place in Temple just when the conflict over the succession to the throne was expected to intensify.Now that the Emperor\u2019s power seemed to pierce through the sky due to the victory in the Demon World War, his words held more authority than ever. In fact, the Emperor was the most powerful one since the founding of the Empire. That was the price he received in exchange for the hostages\u2019 lives.Now the Emperor could even appoint a completely weak member of the Imperial Family who had no real authority or base as the successor.That\u2019s why he was telling the two most influential successors to not think about hurting each other, but rather protect each other no matter what.They should win the Imperial Power through fair competition.Nelliod de Gardias, the current Emperor, was an unprecedentedly powerful Emperor who could make such ridiculous demands.It was as if he was telling them: \u201cDon\u2019t even think about trying to commit the perfect crime, because even if your opponent dies because of an accident, your right of succession would be void.\u201d. Only this Emperor, who had the most power in the history of mankind due to his victory in the Demon World War, was able to place such an absurd condition.The letter wasn\u2019t only addressed towards Bertus and Charlotte.It was to all the students, faculty and the followers of Charlotte and Bertus who might be among them.From the Emperor\u2019s words, both Bertus and Charlotte should have realized that they should value the life of their opponent as much as their own.I couldn\u2019t see what kind of facial expression those two were wearing.Anyway, I was really grateful.I wasn\u2019t sure about Charlotte, but that Bertus guy would definitely cause bloodshed, in the near future at least.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27There\u2019s the rule that all students had to treat each other equally, and the authority, power and status one had outside was meaningless in Temple.\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Yo, your Grace\u2026?\u201d\u201cCome on, you should talk to me comfortably. It\u2019s the rule here to treat everyone equally.\u201dHowever, this rule was rather tricky to implement for lower ranking people..Could you just talk comfortably to a Prince just because he asked you to?In the past when we went to Temple, you sure were talking casually to me, haha.You were telling me to do so after all, hahaha.Do I look so easy to you?They were afraid to someday hold this kind of conversation.Of course, Bertus wasn\u2019t that kind of character, but rather, it was just the lower class getting intimidated by his presence.After that, the student council president informed us about the general rules and told us to refer to the manual if we had further questions.It was mostly about the curfew, meal time, items that could and could not be brought in and when to wake up. Just some little things. We were warned not to wander around after lights out. Of course, it was possible to go out if necessary, but we were told to prepare for a scolding by the superintendent if they found out.\u2018Since the superintendents have a lifetime contract with Temple, if you don\u2019t have enough power to influence even the Temple staff, you\u2019d better wake up on time.\u2019They even gave us that kind of dreadful warning.Temple was fully prepared to even counter act their teachers being weighed down by their students\u2019 authority and couldn\u2019t do their jobs as teachers properly.In the lobby on the left, the students that met each other for the first time today got together and talked with each other. I sat slightly further away and overheard what they were talking about.Bertus was a hidden villain to begin with. At the start, guys with a hot temper were the ones who started arguing with Class B. Bertus originally appeared as a good guy in Class A. He was amiable, didn\u2019t discriminate against others and was kind to everyone in Class B.He even hid the fact that he was a prince. He hid his identity and just enrolled into Temple\u2019s Royal Class as an outstanding student. He later revealed his true identity and character to the main character! That was how I set it up.But now, because of Charlotte\u2019s admittance his identity was already known. In other words, the development I had previously planned out disappeared like smoke.Even so, it wouldn\u2019t change the bigger framework of this academy setting. Going to classes, studying and training. Although the development would be different, the structure would be the same.\u201cTake it easy, take it easy. If you don\u2019t, I might be the one who gets a warning, you know? Aren\u2019t you worried about that?\u201d\u201cAh, Uh, uhm\u2026 Yes, I am\u2026.\u201dBertus was telling the students who had a hard time dealing with him to treat him comfortably, while teasing them slightly, just like I set him up to be.Class A, which consisted of 11 people, did not use different dormitories for men and women. Temple focused more on dividing the inferior and superior students than on dividing male and female ones.Right now, the person asking the Prince about various things was number 9 Erich de Lafaeri, the son of Count Lafaeri. I couldn\u2019t remember if he had talent in divine power, swordsmanship or something else, but it must be a talent suited for a Paladin.As an aspiring paladin, I set him up to be a shallow guy. Strong against the weak and weak against the strong. Typical.He was the one who despised Class B the most. He was also the prince\u2019s lackey.Ah.I feel like someone spoiled me here, because I already knew these developments in advance. That feeling of knowing someone\u2019s inner thought was both a good one and a bitter one.\u201cHave you ever been to Lafaerie? Oh, of course, you haven\u2019t been there before\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh, Lafaerie, it\u2019s the great territory in the Northwest. I\u2019ve never been to it before, but I know it produces good grapes. I can\u2019t drink yet, but I know because the Emperor likes to drink wine from Lafaerie.\u201d\u201cO, oooh! You know!\u201dErich was almost moved to tears just because the prince knew about his territory.Although I didn\u2019t find that matter all that moving, Bertus\u2019 ability to commit anything he saw to memory and to recall any of these things at will sure was amazing.Bertus smiled innocently.\u201cAs a matter of fact, I had a few sips without the Emperor\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\u201cAh, re, really?\u201d\u201cIt had a good feeling to. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t remember too clearly.\u201d\u201cNo, no! No! Tha, thank you! B, by the way, you did it wi, without\u2026 You did it without the Emperor knowing\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that much different from you, you know? I also do things I want to do secretly behind my parents\u2019 back. Then if I get caught I get scolded.\u201dWhat a ghoulish bastard.It was so absurd watching Bertus make his first slave in real time right in front of me. After talking for a long while, Bertus got up and approached someone. They came down to the lobby, wiping down their hair with a towel as if they just came out of the shower.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201c..\u2026Huh. You got business with me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to get to know your classmates a bit more? I\u2019m Bertus. Nice to meet you. I saw you earlier, you were rank 2, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to introduce myself formally.\u201dA girl with black hair and eyes. Even though this was the first time I saw her, I knew exactly who she was.\u201cEllen.\u201dThe girl tried to walk past Bertus as soon as she said that.\u201cHuh? That\u2019s it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know you.\u201dBertus smiled bashfully and extended his hand to her.\u201cI heard about it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe girl that introduced herself as Ellen looked at Bertus before she held his hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Of course, you were supposed to be number 1. I guess there were some people meddling. I really wanted to apologize to you for taking your place.\u201dBertus spoke as if he knew something about Ellen.\u201c..\u2026I don\u2019t care.\u201dAfter Ellen said that she brushed away her hair and walked towards the restaurant.\u201cHey, did you hear?\u2026 She was supposed to be number 1\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah. Right.\u201dA girl who was supposed to be number 1 got pushed down to number 2 because of Bertus.She introduced herself as just Ellen, but Bertus knew that the girl was hiding something.Of course, I also knew as it was part of the main story.What she hid was her real name. Her last name to be exact.Ellen Artorius.She was the sister of the Warrior Artorius.* * *Ellen Artorius.If Bertus was the villain who had slightly better talents than the main character, then Ellen Artorius was a powerhouse that the main character couldn\u2019t even dare look at.As such, she was the main character\u2019s real rival.Although she fell to Class A\u2019s second rank, she actually possessed such tremendous amounts of talent that just calling her first rank wasn\u2019t enough.She had a lot of talents I couldn\u2019t clearly remember. Things like weapon mastery, magic domination, magic resistance, spiritual sensitivity, psychic resistance, fast-learning and many more.She was a genius and good at everything.She was the beneficiary of that set up.That was why Ellen hid her vast amounts of talents from outsiders. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary number of talents after all.If I had infinite aptitudes, then Ellen was born with every type of combat talent there is, though it wasn\u2019t infinite.If Swordsmanship was a talent for just one type of weapon, then Weapon Mastery would be a type of comprehensive talent. It meant that one had a talent for all types of weapons. Even if she just had a talent for a single weapon and an additional one she would have been able to enter Royal Class, but counting Ellen\u2019s talents was just a meaningless task.She had so many talents that no one could match her in the class of warriors. In addition to her magic resistance she had one more resistance that no one except Ellen had. She had the talent to develop a resistance against supernatural powers.To begin with, I made her as a character that felt like a mountain the main character could never over look, so of course she was a Munchkin. As was etiquette in these types of novels, the main character would eventually rise to a level comparable to Ellen Artorius.Bertus was watching the leaving figure of that Ellen, who didn\u2019t seem to care much about him. Erich watched her with an expression as if he wanted to say something like: \u201cWhat? How dare you ignore His Grace?!\u201dI heard all their names during that self-introduction, however, even though I was the one who set up their names, honestly, I still couldn\u2019t remember all of them.What did that guy do again? What were his abilities?There were so many characters and it wasn\u2019t like this was the last novel I wrote about the Demon King\u2019s death, so I couldn\u2019t help but forget.Bertus greeted each and every one of us in the lobby as if he was trying to get acquainted with us, I was no exception in this.While Bertus was talking, I again tried to recall the faces and names of the remaining people.\u201cI think you were called Reinhardt. Right?\u201d\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do well together, my friend.\u201dIt seemed like we already had too bad of a relationship though to become friends, but, well, that wasn\u2019t a reason to act too unfriendly.The one I had to be on guard the most about wasn\u2019t Bertus after all. I had to be careful not to let Charlotte know who I was. Bertus didn\u2019t know anyway.I had some guesses about Charlotte entering the school, but I was actually pretty surprised that it actually happened.I had to be careful not to stand out too much. Even though Charlotte didn\u2019t know for certain that I was a demon, she did know that I was suspicious. That\u2019s what I noticed before I fled without a word.I was certainly uncomfortable with the idea of having to be in the same class as Bertus, but it was a lot more dangerous to be in Charlotte\u2019s class. I was glad that I got into Class A.It was that\u2026.It was about time for that to happen.\u201cHey, guys! Nice to meet you!\u201dA guy approached Class A\u2019s lobby with a lively expression on his face.\u201cLet\u2019s get along in the future!\u201dThe one ranked last in Class B and the main character, Ludwig, was coming towards the lobby.* * *Technically, the A and B Class dormitories weren\u2019t off limits to the other class.It was more like an unwritten rule, so someone heading to the other class\u2019s dormitory didn\u2019t happen often. Even more so as the grades went up.That was because Class A clearly perceived Class B as inferior and Class B was also uncomfortable with or rather they disliked Class A.In fact, as one went up in grade, there wasn\u2019t even a way for class members to go back and forth between the two. In some cases, Class B was able to overtake Class A by working hard, but that just added to the annoyance of Class A.Of course, this was the first day everyone here joined the Royal Class, but those who have attended Temple since elementary school had heard about these facts.Therefore, it wasn\u2019t that unreasonable for the people in Class A\u2019s lobby to look at Ludwig, who came to Temple for the first time today and proudly introduced himself as Class B\u2019s number 11, with an expression seeming to ask \u2018What\u2019s with that bastard?\u2019.That was the event that took place right after the self-introduction after entering the dormitories.Ludwig just stopped by Class A to say hello, but was met with rather bitter reactions.There were five people in the lobby right now.I, Bertus, No. 9 Erich, No. 10 Cayer Vioden, No. 4 Harriet de Saint-Owan.Except for me and Bertus, everyone was frowning at him. Ludwig then readily reached out his hand to Bertus.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, Prince! Let\u2019s do our best together!\u201d\u201cOkay, Ludwig. Don\u2019t call me Prince. That\u2019s against the rules.\u201d\u201cYes! Bertus!\u201dBertus smiled kindly and took his hand. Everyone looked at that scene with even more astonishment. It\u2019s like witnessing a friendship that only had a 1% chance of happening, happening right in front of their eyes.The prince had a good personality as well.I felt like I could hear voices saying that from everywhere. After shaking hands with Bertus, Ludwig greeted the other children as well.\u201cOh, we meet again, Reinhardt\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do our best!\u201d\u201cOh, you too.\u201dLet\u2019s not stand out. Let\u2019s just show a neutral reaction.Erich shook hands with Ludwig, even though he was quite speechless. No. 10 Cayer just sighed in astonishment and took his hand.\u201c\u2026Hey, get out of here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cGet out of here. This is the Class A dormitory.\u201dHowever, No. 4 Harriet de Saint-Owan was blunt with Ludwig.\u201cAh, so\u2026. I, I can\u2019t come here?\u201dLudwig seemed embarrassed as he said that. Harriet sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t know about you not being allowed here.\u201dHarriet sighed again and pointed at the hallway Ludwig entered through.\u201cBut it feels bad. Some B Class person just wandering in and out of the A Class housing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, ah\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you understand, just go away already.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Ri, right. I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201dLudwig turned back with a puzzled expression.\u201cCome now. Aren\u2019t we all the same friends here?\u201dBertus appeared to rescue Ludwig from trouble. Harriet\u2019s face turned beet-red as she hadn\u2019t expected Bertus would step up.\u201cAh, tha\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026. Ah\u2026.\u201dHer bewilderment, fumbling for words, was a stark contrast to her previous venomous look she sent out before. I guess she never thought the prince would cover for that guy.Harriet de Saint-Owan.Princess of the Duchy Saint-Owan. As the princess of one of the Empire\u2019s duchies she had to make a good impression on the Prince.That guy was a commoner without a surname and he boldly dared to come here as a B Class student, so she got annoyed and lost her temper, however when Bertus stepped in she got very quiet.Bertus, of course, didn\u2019t reveal that he was a prince in the original, but he overwhelmed her with his atmosphere.It was amazing how the initial development was the same, even though some things changed.\u201cLudwig, we have some sensitive friends here, so let\u2019s be more careful in the future. If you have something to say to us, you can use the pager and if you don\u2019t know how to use it, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\u201cO, oh. Ehm\u2026. Thank you.\u201dBertus walked out of the lobby with a grinning, but slightly dazed Ludwig. Harriet\u2019s face was still red and she couldn\u2019t bring out a single word.She usually lived with her nose in the air, so she completely forgot that there was a Prince next to her. She only pretended to be calm, after all she only heard of Temple and this was her first day here.By the way, was it so scary to suddenly see someone from Class B here? Well, anyway even though she was kind of a jerk, she was still ranked fourth.Her main talent was \u2018Magic\u2019.If Weapon Mastery was a comprehensive talent, then \u2018Magic\u2019 was of the same type.There was a person in Class B who had the two magical talents \u2018Alchemy\u2019 and \u2018Enchantment\u2019. In comparison, that girl\u2019s comprehensive talent, Magic, was a huge upgrade to the talent the person from Class B had.In any case, she was gifted with the ability to be able to master all types of magic, regardless of school or field. She wasn\u2019t 4th ranked for nothing. Of course, knowing that there were still 3 more people above her was amazing in itself.\u201cThe Prince has a very good personality\u2026.\u201dErich was admiring him, calling Bertus Prince again without realizing.\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201dErich looked at me as if he was asking me to agree. Originally, he was supposed to ask someone else, wasn\u2019t he?\u201c..\u2026Yeah.\u201dLooking at it like that, no matter how rotten he was on the inside, he did seem to have a good personality on the outside. Even I who knew his true colors couldn\u2019t believe it.He was so good at pretending that he could even deceive me, the creator.That was quite the thing.[You have accomplished the achievement \u2018First day at Temple\u2019.][You have earned 100 achievement points.]I didn\u2019t know if it was because I saw the event with Ludwig or if this was a reward for safely passing the day, but I received some achievement points.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28I was returning to my room.Getting involved in major events, such as just now with Ludwig, seemed to earn me achievement points. Of course, regardless of that, I knew that I could earn some by completing challenges such as \u2018Slap the Emperor in the Face\u2019\u2026.But wasn\u2019t that just a bit unfair?I got 100 points for surviving and overcoming the risk of death, and yet I got 100 points just because Ludwig was getting humiliated in the same place I was at? Wasn\u2019t that completely insane?Were they telling me that my life was on the same level as Ludwig getting called a dog?While I was musing over the amount of achievement points earned, no message popped up. I guessed they must have their own rules. Just thinking about that made me feel tired.Most of the main story took place in Class B and its dormitory or classroom, so Class A could almost be considered a vestige of the main story. That meant, it was mostly filled with things I was unfamiliar with.When I returned to my room, I filled out the blank name spaces based on the names I heard in the self-introduction.Class 1-A.I couldn\u2019t remember all their talents. There were also some people I completely forgot.1 \u2013 Bertus de Gardias (Swordmaster, Villain)2 \u2013 Ellen Artorius (Munchkin)3 \u2013 Marianna de Grantz (Electrokinesis)4 \u2013 Harriet de Saint-Owan (Magic)5 \u2013 Cliffman (Something having to do with close quarter combat.)6 \u2013 Heinrich von Schwarz (Pyrokinesis)7 \u2013 Adelia (Something on the Magic side)8 \u2013 Kono Lint (Teleportation)9 \u2013 Erich de Lafaeri (Lackey 1, somehow will become Paladin?)10 \u2013 Cayer Voiden (Lackey 2, early game villain. Can\u2019t remember more.)11 \u2013 MeAnd Class B.1 \u2013 Charlotte de Gardias (Unknown)2 \u2013 Louis Ancton (Smart. Nerd)3 \u2013 Scarlet (Supernatural power, immune to magic.)4 \u2013 Ashir (Divine power\u2026 Probably?)5 \u2013 Christina (Alchemy, Enchantment.)6 \u2013 Anna de Gerna (Black magic, not a bad girl.)7 \u2013 Ibia (Telepathy)8 \u2013 Destomolian (Witchcraft, Supernatural power, savage bastard.)9 \u2013 Delphine Izadra (Archery)10 \u2013 Lanian Sessor (Music)11 \u2013 Ludwig (Stamina, munchkin pretending to be weak, main character)Although I didn\u2019t have any detailed knowledge about a lot of the talents, I was roughly able to sort things out, as hearing their names kind of made me remember some things.Who I had to remember weren\u2019t the original main characters anyway. Most of the people I would run into were the Class A kids.Anyway, unlike in the original, Charlotte and I were added, so there were 22 students.Among them I had not a single clue what talent Charlotte had. What kind of talent would she have? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the same as Bertus\u2019? Since they were family, there was a good chance that they might have the same talents.However, now wasn\u2019t the time to deal with Charlotte.I got 100 points for escaping the Demon King\u2019s Castle.Then I earned 1000 points for saving Charlotte.After that I used \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019 twice, spending 150 points each, so 300 points.And just then I got 100 points as a reward.I had a total of 900 achievement points available to me.To give myself a talent with achievement points, I needed at least 1000 points.[Swordsmanship \u2013 1000 Points][Archery \u2013 1000 Points][Magic Sensitivity \u2013 1000 Points]...In fact, this was an incredible ability. Bertus had to endure enormous pain undergoing that huge procedure to acquire three talents. However, I could just get talents by using achievement points.Of course, achievement point costs would be subject to change.Maybe after I get my first talent, the second one might be more expensive. It was a pity that I didn\u2019t know how expensive they would get.If I get 100 more points, I would be able to get my first talent, unless the prices suddenly changed.There were obviously some incredibly powerful talents. For example, those comprehensive talents.[Weapon Mastery \u2013 10000 Points][Magic \u2013 20000 Points]One of Ellen\u2019s many talents, Weapon Mastery, required 10000 Points, and Harriet\u2019s Magic required 20000 Points. I could save up my points and then put them into one of those talents, but who knew how many years it would take until I got that many points saved up. I wasn\u2019t even sure if the price would still be the same at that time.When swordsmanship reached its peak, there were some cases where it evolved into Weapon Mastery, but what was with this?And Weapon Mastery and magic, swordsmanship included, could only create enormous synergy if there were other talents supporting them. Most of them had to be backed by magic related talents.In the case of Magic, even if one had that talent, one couldn\u2019t learn any if one didn\u2019t possess magic sensitivity, magic aptitude and, most importantly, a great deal of intelligence.I wanted to become a wizard the most. It was safe and powerful.However, would I be able to master the science of magic filled with technical terms that would make my head spin? Even if my talents for magic were fully developed, there was a strong possibility that I wasn\u2019t able to understand the science behind it.Or could I become a wizard after I upgraded my brain by getting learning-related talents? I\u2019d love to have a talent that would make me smarter, but\u2026.Under the premise that I want to become a wizard, I would need at least four lesser talents to meet the requirements. One talent for the corresponding magic system, magic sensitivity, mana control and brain reinforcement.It would be nice to get all that before I die of old age.In the end, there was only one answer.A Supernatural ability.Supernatural powers could exert their strength with only one talents. A-3 had Electrokinesis and A-6 had Pyrokinesis.However, there was a problem with supernatural abilities.At a lower level, the abilities were either too weak or not controllable. In other words, it was difficult to make use of them whenever one needed them. Therefore, those who used supernatural powers had to develop them through continuous training and control. Just like others had to do swordsmanship training or magic research.But in the end, it would be better to dig the well early than uselessly dream of becoming a wizard by saving hard on my achievement points of which I didn\u2019t know when I would get some.Swordsmanship could evolve into Weapon Mastery and if one studied various schools of magic, those who originally didn\u2019t have the Magic talent could develop it.Some talents evolved. Especially supernatural abilities tended to do so. The reason for that was, as one became able to control one\u2019s ability and one\u2019s understanding of it deepend, one could discover the hidden aspects of the ability.A-3, who utilizes electricity, would later be able to use a power stronger than what she was able to use now, and A-6, who used flames, would later be able to ignite things without combustion..If I were to buy a talent using my achievement points it should be something one wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain through normal means. With all my aptitudes, I could just acquire those normal talents by doing some repetitive training. The problem was that I didn\u2019t know how long it would take though.Supernatural powers couldn\u2019t be obtained through effort, regardless of one\u2019s inadequacies or aptitudes. However, I could buy supernatural powers with my achievement points.It might not be useful right away, but it had a strong potential for growth.So, there was no other option for me other than supernatural powers.So which supernatural power should I choose\u2026.? At the lowest level it wouldn\u2019t be of much help anyway.I had to decide based on future developments.It was quite funny that I was planning away the 100 achievement points I hadn\u2019t even received yet.Let\u2019s go to sleep.* * *On the next day was the entrance ceremony. The entrance ceremony was held for children who had entered the higher education course in Temples gigantic square. The sight of more than 10000 students having their entrance ceremony here was truly breathtaking.Setting up that there was an entrance ceremony itself seemed like a pretty unreasonable move on my part. When one gathered tens of thousands of children in one place, it would naturally create some world chattering noise.However, the Royal Class\u2019 entrance ceremony was held separately.The reason for that seemed to be to make the Royal Class children focus on their work rather than get dragged to some large scale events. I didn\u2019t even bother explaining that bit.Come to think of it. making those other kids uncomfortable while giving us this comfort seemed pretty much like discrimination, didn\u2019t it? They basically put on some frivolous show, making the other students quite exhausted, while they kept the privileged away from it.That\u2019s how it was.I felt my face turn red in embarrassment at how carelessly I wrote these things. It was an entrance ceremony for only 22 students, so the procedure was rather simple. Even with the Prince and Princess there, it didn\u2019t seem much different.The attendance ended with the introduction of the general teachers of the Royal Class, that is, the principal and the people who will be in charge of us in the future.Then we were led to the class building dedicated to the Royal Class close to the dormitories and were told to sit in our classroom. That fast pace wasn\u2019t all that bad.Class A\u2019s homeroom teacher, Epinhauser.Unlike Class B\u2019s homeroom teacher, Mr. Mustrang, he had a very business-like, cold personality.He was looking at us with a stiff expression on his face. He was that type of person that thought he was the only smart guy in the room, so he was treating us no different from ordinary students.\u201cOn Mondays and Thursdays, we will have a common class in this classroom.\u201d\u201cOn Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you can take the classes you requested. The lecture list and their outlines are all written on the document distributed. Students who do not know how to proceed, come to me separately. You might not know which classes to take.\u201d\u201cYou children have great talent, but do not be fooled into thinking that you are geniuses in every field. What I\u2019m meaning to say is, don\u2019t try to take classes you won\u2019t be able to understand yet.\u201d\u201cNo. 1, you shall be the temporary class leader. If you want to replace your class leader, report to me after you do. Most things I have to tell you will be communicated through No. 1.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even call the Prince by his name and some of the students were rather taken aback at how casually he referred to him, but Bertus didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201cAlso, if you believe I might be of help with any grievances, problems or quarrel, please ask for help.\u201d\u201cAnd, if there is a big fight, call me immediately, and while I wish to prevent any student from getting killed as much as possible, I cannot say that it never happened. So that you can be more cautious of each other, you have to know each other\u2019s talents, so we created a list. Check it out later.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was muttering some words with bloody content quite casually, like a narration. Someone raised their hand at that cruel closing remark.\u201cWhat would happen if you page a teacher when there\u2019s a big fight?\u201dNo. 8, Kono Lint. He probably was curious. I knew the reason he asked as well.If we were to fight among ourselves , would that be a problem that could just be resolved by getting a teacher involved?That seemed to be his question. It kind of showed his confidence orrather arrogance.Mr. Epinhauser seemed familiar with that question as well.\u201cYou are under special supervision and valuable talents of the Empire, but you may also hold the power to endanger yourself and others.\u201dMr. Epinhauser explained calmly.\u201cAs a teacher of the Royal Class, I have the authority to take emergency measures in case something like that were to happen.\u201d\u201cEmergency?\u201d\u201cIt means that if the situation is not favorable, the student can be promptly disposed of.\u201dThose words chilled the atmosphere in the classroom.This place only held precious people with great talent.And here someone was, standing right before them, telling them, if something goes wrong, he can kill them. He spoke calmly as if what he just said was a matter of course.\u201cAre you capable of that?\u201dNo. 10, Cayer Vioden remarked rather sarcastically. Mr Epinhauser didn\u2019t react much to that obvious sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years now.\u201dThis time no one dared to say anything sarcastically again.No, well, they probably were scared because they were kids.But why was I also scared? Why? Was I too old? Did I maybe grow soft? Was it because this was just too cruel? Can a teacher even do that?Contrary to that atmosphere.-Wahahahaha!One could hear laughter from the next classroom. It was Class B.\u201cThen I hope you have understood my words and be careful.\u201dHowever, there was no laughter to be found in Class A.\u201cAnd No. 11.\u201dHuh?\u201cYou follow me.\u201dHuh? Me? Why so suddenly?I didn\u2019t really expect that development, you know?Teacher?* * *The classroom building for common education was built right next to the Royal Class\u2019 dormitory, so there was no need to go around the entire Temple on the days of common education.About 100 students were getting educated there, but the building was slightly smaller than other Temple buildings. There, not only teachers, but also faculty and other personnel were second only in number to the students.\u2026However,\u00a0 I just set it up like that, I actually had no idea what they were doing.There were dozens of people in the first year teacher\u2019s office, excluding the homeroom teacher. I wasn\u2019t sure if all of them were teachers, but I was pretty sure that the other year\u2019s teacher\u2019s offices looked the same.Certainly, the number of students and staff should be about equal or even greater.Mr. Epinhauser took me to his private room and instructed me to sit down in front of him.I felt like a patient who just came to the hospital after being diagnosed with a serious illness waiting for some bad news.I wasn\u2019t really sure, but I felt like I was in some sort of trouble.He rummaged through some papers and talked to me without looking at me.\u201cNo. 11, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cYea- Yes.\u201dHe looked at me calmly.\u201cYou have a lot of aptitudes, but no talent, correct?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026. Yes.\u201dWhy was he talking to me as if I was a beggar?He was cruel and cold-hearted, but I didn\u2019t set him up to be human trash, though?\u201cWhat classes are you going to take?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201dSomething completely unexpected came out of Epinhauser\u2019s mouth. He put a document down in front of me. Each student\u2019s profile was organized there.The document he presented to me was the profile of No. 3, Marianna de Grantz.\u201cNo.3, Grantz, a holder of supernatural powers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dWhat about it? He rummaged through the papers and showed me another page.\u201cThis is No. 5.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cCliffman is a Combat talent.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSo what? While I was having such thoughts while looking at him, Mr. Epinhauser was just staring at me silently. His eyes were scary.So there were people in this world that could scold someone with just their eyes.\u201cStudents with supernatural powers usually sign up for special lectures on meditation and psychic control. There aren\u2019t many with supernatural abilities, so they need specialized lectures like that.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take any of those lectures through, now do you, No. 11?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. Well.\u201dI didn\u2019t know about later, but I didn\u2019t think I needed to take them for now.\u201cCliffman is a combat talent. It is rather rare. Hand to Hand Combat, Gladiator, Martial Arts, Archery\u2026 They say it encompasses all kinds of combat talents.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe showed talent in everything to do with the way of battle. Cliffman only had one talent, but in terms of just that one talent, it was a comprehensive talent far superior to Weapon Mastery.\u201cNo. 5 who is a combat talent, will take lectures centered on physical training, weapon skills and sparring. Do you agree?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOh man, I now knew what he was talking about.\u201cYour other classmates have a set direction how they want to specialize. They roughly know what they need to learn and what classes to take.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut No. 11, you have aptitudes in all fields, but nothing you excel in.\u201dI knew he wasn\u2019t trying to scold me, but I sure felt like he was.\u201cYou probably have no idea what you need to learn. Correct?\u201dHe seemed to think that I needed help.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29He was a teacher. Most students had specific aptitudes and talents, so one didn\u2019t have to tell them what they had to study. It was his job to just look over the list of courses the students chose and give a few words.However, from his point of view, it would be the first time having a student like me. A weird student who could do everything but wasn\u2019t specifically good at anything.\u201cYou can do anything within the curriculum supported by Temple. However if you try to do everything, you would gain nothing.\u201dSo, Epinhauser brought me to the teacher\u2019s office in case I would get overly greedy and tried to do something absurd. To prevent a situation like me trying to learn everything but ending up with nothing.What a good teacher.\u201cAptitude and talent did not always determine if it was suitable for one or not. I\u2019ve seen people who had a talent in magic but absolutely hated magic, and there were people who had great talent in swordsmanship, but would immediately faint as soon as a sword got pointed at them.\u201dA talent for swordsmanship didn\u2019t automatically give one fighting spirit, and a talent for magic didn\u2019t automatically give one the desire to research and explore magic.That\u2019s what one might call the blind spot of talent.Mr. Epinhauser was already telling me a problem that would only occur after the beginning part.In the end, what was important was one\u2019s own mentality, one\u2019s interest in it and if one could apply it in practice. If one were forced to train in a certain field because one found a talent in you early on, one might come to loath that talent itself and one might just end up collapsing in a situation where one\u2019s life is at stake.What good would being talented in swordsmanship do, if you were afraid of violence itself?That\u2019s what he meant.\u201cSo, you are better off than those guys at least. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to do anything because you don\u2019t have a talent that\u2019s restricting you. You can do whatever you want.\u201dEventually, he asked me what I wanted to do. I decided on that yesterday.\u201cI want to learn about supernatural powers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFor the first time today, his face showed some emotions.He was clearly pitying me.He looked at my profile and remained silent for a while.\u201cI heard that you have so many aptitudes that it just got shortened to a single line.\u201dThey weren\u2019t able to write all my aptitudes down on paper. That was why they just summed it up in a single line: \u2018Has aptitudes in all fields\u2019. If they actually tried to document all of them, they\u2019d waste a huge amount of paper.\u201cDo you also have aptitude for supernatural abilities?\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201dMaybe I had it or maybe I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t really explain it to him.\u201cSo, let\u2019s just say you do, how do you plan on awakening such supernatural powers?\u201d\u201c\u2026By trying my best?\u201dI couldn\u2019t exactly tell him that I could use achievement points to awaken them, so I said that, but that kind of made him look at me as if I was trying to break a rock with an egg.\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything else you want to focus on other than supernatural powers? Put simply, people who do not have supernatural abilities cannot attend those special lectures.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a bit different for students of Royal Class, but the teacher in charge will find that very strange. There might also be the possibility that they will kick you out.\u201dI nodded and told him that I would bear the full responsibility if I would get kicked out.He agonized for a long time and eventually began to write something down on a paper.\u201cApply for this class, I will inform the teacher separately.\u201dHe seemed to think that I should realize on my own what nonsense I was trying to do.\u201cInstead, we shall keep it at a single lecture.\u201dHe wrote down this and that, saying that he would not introduce any other supernatural power-related lectures to me.After writing some things down in a flash he handed me the paper.\u201cThis is your schedule for the semester. If you put anything else in it, I will not accept it.\u201dApparently he made a schedule for me instead.\u201cWhat lectures are these?\u201d\u201cRather than just focusing on that single subject, I\u2019d like you to do it like this. You\u2019ll be able to find something fitting.\u201dHe told me I could do anything I wanted at first.When he realized that I wanted to focus on something as bizarre as supernatural powers, he asked me to choose something I\u2019d like to do other than that. So rather than spending this semester on just supernatural powers, he told me I should try other lectures as well to find something I liked. It was common sense that it was impossible to awaken supernatural powers just through effort.In other words, that was the right judgement here, so I couldn\u2019t say anything against it.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It went without saying that just joining all the supernatural power classes wasn\u2019t a good idea. In fact, it might not be possible for me to fill the entire semester with just lectures related to supernatural powers, and I also wanted to see how the lectures of each major that I only roughly described in my novel went about things.So I just went back to Class A\u2019s classroom where no teacher was present. There I found nearly all the children, except a few, gathering around a bulletin board.As soon as I went through the door all of their eyes turned to me.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy were they staring at me like that?The gazes from the guys gathered around the bulletin board were lukewarm. Rather than filled with mixed hostility, their gazes held curiosity and incomprehension.\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have any talent, do you?\u201dIt was No. 10 Cayer Vioden who said these words. It was then that I realized why the kids were crowding around the bulletin board like that.Mr. Epinhauser posted each students profile on the bulletin board. They were posted with the intentions of getting to know each other\u2019s talents so that everyone knew what to be careful of.Of course, Ellen\u2019s tremendous talents weren\u2019t all written down, so she didn\u2019t get much attention.There probably were some kids who were curious what talents the others held, so they found out that the bottom ranked No. 11 only had aptitudes and no talents.So they found it weird.\u201cYeah, so what?\u201dIt was true, so I didn\u2019t have anything else to say to him. I just went back to my seat and sat down. My seat was on the far left in the second row near the window, as the tables were arranged by numerical order. The classroom was spacious so there was no need for us to share desks. I had this huge desk all to myself.I tried to get rid of them, but these strange gazes seemed to follow me. Bertus was also looking at me with a strange smile on his face.\u201cNo, hey. How does that make any sense?\u201dCayer came to my seat as if he didn\u2019t understand this at all.\u201cThis is the Royal Class, a place not everyone can enter, even if they have a talent. How did you get into this place, which required one to have exceptional talent? What\u2019s more into Class A? Shouldn\u2019t you be at least in Class B?\u201dI did set him up to be someone with a strong personality, but I didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d come at me like that on the first day of class.Cayer really didn\u2019t understand and to him my existence on its own seemed ridiculous. He seemed very angry. How should I even respond to this? He was ready to grab my collar and no one seemed to want to stop him.Bertus seemed to be just watching the situation.\u201cI seriously don\u2019t understand. Hey. What are you? How could someone like you be here?\u201d\u201cHey you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u2026What?\u201dI wanted to act more mature. To be honest, how old was I to be overreacting over something like a kid badgering me?I didn\u2019t want to stand out.I didn\u2019t mean to.But, so what.\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, go ask the admissions office for all I care.\u201dSeeing this situation happen right in front of my eyes, I snapped back a bit.Seeing me reacting not as he expected, Cayer\u2019s complexion drastically changed.\u201cY, you punk, you, just now\u2026. What\u2026. H, how dare you not have any talent and\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me about the decision the admissions office made? Do you think I came through some back door? Huh? I just came here because they sent me here, like you. Who do you think you are? And what do you mean with \u2018How dare I\u2019? Are you the admissions examiner or the head of the admissions office?\u201d\u201cNo. This\u2026.\u201d\u201cHah, are you the head of the admissions office?\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d\u201cHah, are or aren\u2019t you the head of the admissions office? You bastard! Yes or no?\u201d-Clatter!He was startled as I jumped up from my seat and approached him. He began to retreat step by step.\u201cAre or aren\u2019t you? What\u2019s taking you so long? Huh?\u201d\u201cN, no\u2026. I\u2026 am not.\u201d\u201cSo why are you meddling in this?\u201dHe was definitely so scared that his face turned blue.\u201cHey, Number 10. Number 10 who has this huge magical talent but can\u2019t feel mana for shit.\u201d\u201cA,ah\u2026.\u201dOne didn\u2019t have to be talented to be a jerk. Did you avoid poop because you were afraid of it? No, you avoid it because it\u2019s dirty. I couldn\u2019t become some scary guy right now, so I had to become a dirty bastard so that one wouldn\u2019t want to touch me.That guy in front of me wasn\u2019t even talented in combat anyway.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just treat each other well, huh?\u201d-Thump\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer?\u201dWhen I opened my eyes and stared at him, his complexion turned as white as a sheet of paper, then he slightly nodded.\u201cA, ah\u2026.\u201dI patted that naughty bastard on the cheek and sat back down. The atmosphere around my classmates watching the scene was chilly.I was tired.Like that I would be branded as some dirty bastard, who didn\u2019t even have an ability.But I wasn\u2019t wrong you know? I was sent here by the admissions office, you know?Afterwards.I really didn\u2019t want to stand out, but here I was standing out faster than lightning.I could foresee a dark future for my school days.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Thanks to No. 10 getting things turned on him while he was trying to pick a fight with me, no one else tired. They must have been shocked seeing a crazy person acting like a jerk, not in the least intimidated by his lack of talent.They just heard from the teacher that they might get killed if they use their ability first so only a completely crazy guy would have the guts to do anything. If he wasn\u2019t that than he was just totally ignorant. Well, something like that certainly would happen again in the future.Class B was a very friendly class. Sometimes one could hear laughter drifting over from there, but Class A was deathly silent. Except for the sound of pens moving, the teachers\u2019 lecture and the questions asked from time to time, it was completely devoid of laughter.Originally, this place was supposed to be a gathering of only that kind of people, but I couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the thought that the atmosphere of horror I created for no good reason must have played a part in this.Damn it, I seriously got angry at a kid. I\u2019m the worst kind of human being.I sat in class feeling shame.Common classes were like general classes that everyone had to take.For example, classes such as history, geography, mathematics, literature and ethics. Each teacher was in charge of a different subject, perhaps it was set that the homeroom teacher wasn\u2019t in charge of any classes.During the brief break between classes and the end of them, the children seemed to be chatting with each other, slowly getting to know each other.\u2013 You have aptitude for magic? What classes are you going to take?-Well\u2026. I\u2019m not sure yet.-Then would you like to ask our teacher what to take?-Huh? Ah, that\u2026. Well\u2026. Hm.-Royal Class seems to have exclusive lectures different from other general class kids. \u00a0Maybe we could just get a lecture for just the two of us.-Oh\u2026. Really?Kids with similar talents seemed to want to apply for the same classes. On the day you self-applied for a lecture, you would have to listen to the lecture with general class students, so they wanted to have one more person they knew as psychological crutch.So on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, people talented in combat would join combat classes, people talented in magic would attend magic classes and people with supernatural abilities would join classes for supernatural ability users. In the case of people talented in divine power, they tended to attend combat lectures as they often had another combat talent.And so, everyone was talking about what to apply for, others thought about it on their own. That was how the class time passed.Lunch time.Since there were only about 100 people in the Royal Class, all years ate lunch in a large restaurant. There was no need to stand in line with a plate in hand, and one could just take along whatever one wanted to eat.It was natural that senior students were also mixed in the crowd, but the zones were implicitly divided. Some seats were reserved for first years, others for second years and so on. Of course both classes A and B were mixed together, hence they had to eat in the same place.Class A gathered around Bertus and had a meal. He seemed like a good-natured person, so maybe he already gained some followers.Class B was no different.-Hey, Charlotte, try this. It\u2019s so delicious.-Ah\u2026. Ah, No, thank you. I don\u2019t like oily things.Class B was centered around Charlotte, but the reason seemed to be a different one.-You have to eat a lot to be healthy!-Do you dislike vegetables?She was kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle and entered Temple shortly after returning. So it seemed like everyone was worried about Charlotte\u2019s health. Not only that, but even her seniors were looking at the princess with pity.They were clamoring to take care of Charlotte with Ludwig at the forefront, while Charlotte seemed to struggle dealing with this situation.I set up Class B to have a friendly atmosphere, but even with Charlotte added, the atmosphere remained friendly and the reason for that was Ludwig. He was a typical manga protagonist type character with an optimistic, friendly and energetic personality.I didn\u2019t have much contact with people like that, but I feel like I didn\u2019t really like people like that.Even though there were so many open seats, Class A gathered around Bertus and Class B gathered around Charlotte.And then there were five people eating on their own, as if trying to keep their distance from each other, including myself, who had a bit of an incident this morning.A-2 Ellen Artorius.A-5 Cliffman.A-11 Yours truly.B-2 Louis Ankton.B-3 Scarlett.Were all outsiders, introverts trying to keep their distance?All the outsiders, including me, were eating silently.-I\u2019m going to have an upset stomach\u2026.Charlotte\u2019s melancholic voice sounded strangely sentimental.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Most of the general classes were decent enough. This was supposed to be my first year of high school and I didn\u2019t know this world\u2019s common sense too well, but it was understandable.The Royal Class was a place where people with outstanding talents gathered, but that didn\u2019t mean they were all smart. Rather, there were some guys sleeping in class. Those with good brains were completely focused, even some of the guys with physical talents managed to concentrate. But there were a lot of guys who were just average and some who didn\u2019t even attend, because they were kids. This class\u2019 students were chosen based on talent not on intelligence.However, for me, who had already finished my education before, these classes were usually either boringly easy or just reliant on memorization.By the way.-Run! Don\u2019t stop! Jump!\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201d\u201cI, I ca, can\u2019t anymore\u2026.\u201d\u201cWheeze\u2026. Wheeze\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to do this?!\u201d-Your middle school days are over! \u00a0There\u2019ll be no one consoling you anymore if you\u2019re throw a tantrum!As for the physical training classes, I was literally sweating blood. We had to do this cycle of physical training exercises that were close to corporal punishment.\u2013 Magic, supernatural power, studying and physical training must not be neglected. You are the future of the empire. If you do not meet a certain level of physical fitness by the end of this semester, I will fail you! Keep that in mind!It was an illusion that it was okay for wizards to be weak.If one relies too much on their supernatural power, one would get hurt someday.He who lacks stamina, won\u2019t be able to study properly.It was obviously me who wrote these sentences. Therefore, regardless of major, one had to conduct physical training during the common classes. There was no such thing as a major that would allow one to be weak after all.So it was said that children who had non-combat talents hated this class the most.It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting punished for my own words right now.-Hey, you there! Don\u2019t walk!\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dAs I was receiving that high-intensity physical training now, I almost felt like throwing up the food I had not too long ago.-Run! I\u2019ve never seen anyone die from running! Hey, I can\u2019t see you over there! Look at that!Where the p.e. teacher was pointing was a guy that was running at a constant speed from start to finish.-Tok, tok, tok, tok!He was also sprinting at that, saying some refreshing words as he passed by me.\u201cCheer up, Reinhardt!\u201c\u201cI, I\u2019m going crazy\u2026.\u201dIt was Ludwig.P.E. was one of the classes Class A and B took together.That guy had only one talent.Stamina.All physical abilities were ranked according to a system. I reconfirmed the settings I made in the past by looking at the rank classification criteria written next to the physical data table of my classmates.0~4 (F Rank)5~7 (D Rank)8~13 (C Rank)14~19 (B Rank)20~30 (A Rank)31~35 (S Rank)36~40 (S+ Rank)In addition to that, there was an SS Rank, but having that specification was rather meaningless. Beyond that, would represent a superhuman\u2019s level of strength. Of course there were some who would reach that level.F~D Ranks corresponded to the lower grades.C Rank corresponded to intermediate level.B Rank corresponded to advanced, and beyond that, growth was extremely slow. Unless one was born with a certain type of physique, one might face the limits of one\u2019s growth there. No matter how hard one tried, one might not be able to reach A Rank.In other words, it is said that A Rank would be almost the limit a human being could reach. If one reached something like the A+ Rank that might already be the limit.From S Rank up, it was clearly at the level of a super human. Ordinary training alone wouldn\u2019t get one there.Ludwig\u2019s stamina is 30, which corresponded to A+ Rank.The average stamina someone our age normally had was D Rank, meaning 6~7, while that guy\u2019s stamina was already at 30. He was a nutcase who had the physical strength of humanity\u2019s top athletes. That was Ludwig.That was his only talent and specialty.\u201cWha, what kind of monster is he\u2026.\u201dMy other classmates had their mouths wide open when they saw Ludwig\u2019s crazy stamina. I didn\u2019t feel any jealousy or admiration towards that guy for being faster than me.I think I was just going to die that instant. Should I keep doing this? For the whole semester? Every time we had common classes? Twice a week?I was worried whether it would be okay to choose a supernatural power as my first talent or if I should choose stamina first. After all, that guy was just as fast on his feet as Ellen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-Pak!Ellen Artorius, who also ran at a constant tempo without any disturbance, passed me as well.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The P.E. class that turned people into super humans included not only running but also strength training. There was no distinction made between men and women. There were only five people who were able to stand properly: Class A No. 2 Ellen, No.1 Bertus, No. 5 Cliffman, Class B No. 3 Scarlett and No. 11 Ludwig.Everyone else made noises like zombies. there were some kids even crying.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to cry then you\u2019re still pretty energetic!\u201dHowever, the P.E. teacher, who looked like a demon from hell, was merciless.There was just one person standing beside him.Charlotte de Gardias watched us withering away like that.The P.E. teacher excluded her from training because she was still weak and needed absolute rest. She must have gone through a lot of hardship already in the Demon King\u2019s Castle, so no one objected.Students and teachers were amazed at how well she was taking classes.Even on the verge of death, my eyes were drawn to Charlotte. What kind of talent did she have? It must have been written on Class B\u2019s bulletin board, but I didn\u2019t want to attract more attention by checking it.Charlotte was just watching what we were doing. She faced a life or death crisis once, even though we faced it together that time.I realized again that I had no idea what personality Charlotte de Gardias actually had. It was because the personality she held during the crisis and her personality now seemed distinctly different.\u201cHe, hey! It\u2019s too fast! I can\u2019t count!\u201d\u201cHoo! Hoo! Hoo!\u201dNext to me, Ludwig was doing sit-ups at lightning speed and the child holding his legs and counting across from him was crying. Maybe because he was from Class B but I wasn\u2019t familiar with his face, so I couldn\u2019t remember his name.Now I knew for sure.It was the same with Sarkegaar.I hated these energetic guys.* * *After the two-hours of hellish P.E. classes, everyone washed up in the shower and changed their clothes.\u201cWhy are the showers and changing rooms integrated?\u201dErich de Lafaeri grumbled loudly.The shower facilities themselves were impeccable. Although men and women got divided it was used by both classes. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s changing rooms and shower rooms were shared by Class A and B.He was complaining about that.I didn\u2019t even care about that as I felt like my soul was leaving my body. Except for those who had a certain level of stamina, there were some who collapsed to the floor altogether.A-8 Kono Lint was murmuring blankly.\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem\u2026. We have to do this again on Thursday\u2026.\u201d\u2013 Aaaaarg\u2026.Regardless of class, moans and groans of lamentation flowed out of nearly everyone\u2019s mouth. Everyone had to go through the same hardships again, so who cared about that single detail.Worked to death on Monday, rest two days, then get worked to death again on Thursday. Yes, there certainly was an intention behind that.-Hit!\u201c\u2026.\u2026What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201dWhen I was getting angry at myself for writing such a dog-like novel and hit my head, everyone was looking at me with strange expressions.Anyway, sorry guys.However, I ran into a problem while changing clothes in the changing room.\u201cHey, Number 11.\u201d\u201c.\u2026What?\u201dCayer Vioden spoke to me. I was still in pain and felt like dying, so what problem did that idiot have with me now?\u201cYou\u2019re not in particularly good shape, are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026What about it?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what the hell he was thinking, but he also seemed to be on the verge of dying because of how tired he felt. He wasn\u2019t particularly good physically either.\u201cHey, are you any good at fighting? Huh?\u201dWhat was with that childish quarrel. I guess he acted like that because he got scared after I acted a bit like a jerk.That was why his pride got hurt, so seeing me struggling during P.E., he seemed to think that I wasn\u2019t that much different from him. That was why he gained some confidence and started picking a fight with me in the changing room while I was tired.The men\u2019s only changing room.What a good place to fight for one\u2019s pride.\u201cI\u2019m not good at it.\u201dI couldn\u2019t get mad at this guy again, so I would just put up with his antics for now. To be honest, I regretted my actions earlier.\u201cSo what gives you such confidence then? Huh?\u201dAh, he\u2019s so childish, it felt like goosebumps ran up my neck and back. Was I too old for this? What gives you the confidence? What the hell was with that?I was just speechless and didn\u2019t feel like answering.\u201cFucking with me again\u2026. Hah, what weird nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\u201cFucking with you? Be respectful. Huh? Aren\u2019t you just a bitch?\u201d-Tap!Cayer tapped me on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhy, wanna try me again? Huh? Go ahead. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s ridiculous for a bastard like you to come to Class A. Huh? What kind of trick did you use? Huh? A guy with no talent? Did you bribe them with money?\u201d-TapIt seemed like that guy wouldn\u2019t step down to heal his damaged ego. I hurt his pride more than I thought.I had to admit that I was being pretty impatient at that moment.\u201cArg!\u201d-Thud!I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and threw him down. He was in a pretty weakened state so I could do it easily.The guy who fell over in an instant looked up at me in puzzlement.It was quite funny actually.The students of the Royal Class were chosen by talent.It was completely different from the Orbis Class, which used the exact opposite methode to choose its members.In other words, those guys weren\u2019t that skilled.\u201cThere are children who understand things they are told immediately, and then there are brats who first need a beating to understand.\u201dI had two fights with the same guy on my first day at Temple.\u201cI think you\u2019re a brat.\u201d-Pow!\u201cArg!\u201d\u201cLet me give you that beating.\u201dI kicked the guy who fell to the floor in the stomach.The Royal Class didn\u2019t have anyone who was as skilled as they were proud.There were a lot of students who put a lot of faith in their talent and didn\u2019t bother putting in any effort.That was the weak point of the Royal Class. The students were selected by talent and they wouldn\u2019t fail if they didn\u2019t decide to drop out themselves.Like that guy in front of me, there were people who considered themselves to be part of a very privileged class. In fact they didn\u2019t have anything else to show for themselves.Just some garbage with nothing else to offer but being part of the Royal Class.I trampled on Cayer\u2019s face.-Stop!\u201cUrggg!\u201d-Bang!\u201cCough!\u201dI kicked him in the head.Strong bastards didn\u2019t really have to be strong.-Boom!\u201cArgh!\u201dThere were several types of bullies, but when it came to fighting, there were two types you absolutely shouldn\u2019t touch.One who\u2019s good at fighting.Or one who\u2019s a completely crazy bastard.If you touched someone who was good at fighting, you\u2019d obviously get beat up if you touch them.But it was a bit different in the case of a crazy bastard.People shouldn\u2019t touch someone like that because they wouldn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do. There were guys who\u2019d really hit someone over the head with a chair, you know?I couldn\u2019t fight well, so I chose the latter option to not get trampled over.A person who could act strong was indeed strong. One just had to show some guy, who\u2019s all talk, that you yourself are not.I was going to act like that while everyone was watching.All I had to show them is that if you touch me for no good reason your life might get seriously endangered.I wasn\u2019t strong. I couldn\u2019t even be strong yet.But I could be cruel.Body data and rankings don\u2019t show everything.That\u2019s why I had to show them.-Pow!When I stepped on his face again, someone caught me as if they felt something unusual from me as well.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cWhy, why are you doing this?!\u201dLudwig and Bertus took me away from him.\u201cUh, urgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, if you\u2019re so confident in yourself, try me again, why don\u2019t you?\u201dI spoke to Cayer as I was dragged away by Bertus and Ludwig.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you then.\u201dCayer, who lay collapsed on the floor, couldn\u2019t even look at me.* * *\u201cYou fought?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe hit me first!\u201dIn the end, we were dragged before Mr. Epinhauser due to our fistfight. To be exact, Ludwig and Bertus said something like: \u201cLet\u2019s keep this between us, make up and move on\u201d, but someone went ahead and told the teacher.I didn\u2019t know who tipped him off, but I knew these guys\u2019 attributes. I wrote down certain characteristics and personality traits for them. And I remembered all their names I had forgotten after the introduction ceremony yesterday.Someone who had the attributes of a tattle tale.It had to be B-2 Louis Ankton.Anyway, he must have rushed to tell someone about the fight and Mr. Mustrang was coincidentally in Class A so it got passed on to Mr. Epinhauser, so we were dragged to his private room.\u201cGetting into fights from day one, are we?\u201d\u201cHe hit me first! Oh, and he swore at me this morning!\u201dCayer, who had a stiff, unhappy expression on his face, began to argue that it was all my fault.He seemed to have forgotten how I beat him up in the dressing room.He felt wronged that I hit him, but seemed to have found this to be a great opportunity to get me kicked out. He wanted the teacher to protect him.\u201cIt\u2019s all his fault\u2026.\u201d\u201cSilence.\u201dEpinhauser looked at Cayer with a cool expression.\u201cYou\u2019re noisy No. 10\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk when I haven\u2019t asked you to.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201dCayer, who was very scared, answered in a withered, quiet voice. Epinhauser\u2019s eyes had such a stillness to them that it felt down right creepy when he looked at you.I knew he wasn\u2019t a bad person, but this atmosphere sure made me feel nervous.\u201cNo. 11.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd him calling students by their number rather than their names felt like he was trying to keep a certain distance from them.\u201cDid you hit him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy did you hit him?\u201dHe asked me while wearing a very curious expression on his face.\u201cCayer made statements that undermined Temple\u2019s authority.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about!\u201dEpinhauser and even Cayer were bewildered by my sudden statement. They were surprised because it sounded like nonsense. Epinhauser started to stare at me.\u201cExplain what you mean, No. 11.\u201d\u201cYes. Teacher.\u201dWatch me do this now, you punk.\u201cCayer pointed out to me several times this morning that it was unfair for me to be admitted to the Royal Class with only aptitudes. He said it didn\u2019t make any sense for me to enter Royal Class and Class A at that, based just on my aptitudes without having a talent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dYeah, watch me twist it like that.Mr. Epinhauser seemed to be surprised not by the content of what I was saying, but how I worded it. Yeah, it was a very serious way to put it.\u201cSo I said to Cayer something to the effect of that students shouldn\u2019t question the decisions made by the Temple Admissions Office. Of course, in that process, I also asked Cayer maybe a bit strongly if he were the head of the admissions office, to which Cayer, of course, answered no. I believed the issue to end there, but I guess Caierre must have felt offended that I had dismissed his remarks at that time.\u201dAre you the head of the admissions office, you bastard? That\u2019s what I said roughly.\u201cAnd just after the P.E. class, he asked me if I were good at fighting in the changing room. So I answered him honestly that I wasn\u2019t very good at it. Maybe he planned to physically subdue me to repay me for the humiliation he felt that morning after he saw me struggling with the physical training. He pushed me several times and asked how I could dare to talk to him like that when I wasn\u2019t even good at fighting. Cayer, do you admit that you said these words?\u201dAt my question, Cayer exclaimed with his face reddened.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s true, but I just pushed him! That guy hit me!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hit you because you pushed me.\u201dNoticing that the talk was about to get more tangled up, Mr. Epinhauser raised his hand.\u201cStop, so what did you mean by him undermining Temple\u2019s authority?\u201dHe looked at me, as if warning me to not go on to talk nonsense.\u201cAs Cayer pushed me he said that it would be absurd for a person like me to get into Class A, then asked me what trick I had used to get in. He said that it was clear that I bribed the admissions office and that my admission was fraudulent.\u201dCayer\u2019s face paled with every passing moment. He was probably wondering why I gave a speech like that. Everything happened for a reason.It was true that I was feeling nervous because I was standing in front of Mr. Epinhauser, but, in the end, it was me who set up this character as well.\u201cI can tolerate insults against me,\u00a0 but Cayer\u2019s remarks casted doubt on the credibility of Temple, the pride of the Empire and the world\u2019s best educational institution.\u201dI looked at Mr. Epinhauser.\u201cIn other words, he questioned Temple\u2019s credibility and with it the great Gardias Empire. I couldn\u2019t bear my indignation anymore so I might have lost my temper without realizing it. I apologize for my carelessness. Teacher.\u201dMr. Epinhauser\u2019s characteristic was\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026Is it true that you said that, No. 10?\u201dOverwhelming patriotism.\u201cI asked if it was true that a student of Royal Class even spread groundless rumors about Temple\u2019s system being flawed.\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2026. That\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes or No. Only answer with either of those two.\u201dMr. Epinhauser\u2019s cold anger wasn\u2019t directed at me, but I still felt my throat tingle.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Mr. Epinhauser was a cold-hearted patriot who took great pride in the Empire and Temple. Therefore, he was extremely calm about other things, but about matters that might damage the honor of either of those two, he was extremely sensitive.So it was no wonder that he got angry at a student that openly doubted Temple\u2019s decision not once but twice in a single day.Of course, there were some things that I left out of my recount, as this was a very serious matter.It was easy to make a man out to be the world\u2019s worst killer based on nothing depending how one interpreted his words.A problem doesn\u2019t become a problem until it\u2019s addressed.In other words, most words can be twisted in such a way that they sound problematic.He seemed that he was going to let go of the matter regarding the fight. He told me he would let me off the hook. It seemed to be common for classmates to get into fights in Royal Class.After that Epinhauser told me that I could go, but that Cayer had to stay. He also mentioned that I seem to have a talent that wasn\u2019t treated as one before.What he meant by that was that I didn\u2019t talk like a child my age should. But, so what. It\u2019s not like he\u2019d think I was actually an old man on the inside.Wouldn\u2019t it be strange for a complete incompetent to get into Temple\u2019s Royal Class, where talents gathered?Who\u2019d even doubt that there was some old man inside this bastard that is me? If I force myself to act like a child, I\u2019d just feel uncomfortable and it would only be more awkward. I was just going to roll with this character I build.In the end, Mr. Epinhauser focused more on Cayer but he wouldn\u2019t be severely punished. After all, Teacher knew that I exaggerated the situation a bit, and Cayer was just a kid.It would just be to the extent of a warning.When I came back to the classroom alone, there was a strange atmosphere hanging around everyone. Cayer didn\u2019t come back, only me. I didn\u2019t seem like I got scolded at all, so they were curious.There would be rumors floating around Class A and B about the fight.Even though he has no talent, he has such a bad temper.Ah. What was wrong with them just because of one bad apple? Although that bad apple was me, so I had nothing to say.And then.[Challenge accomplished][Received 100 Achievement Points.]\u2026\u2026What the hell?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s why the teacher told everyone to go back after the fight broke out.So, shortly after Cayer came back, Mr. Epinhauser returned for the closing ceremony.Although Cayer was frustrated for being scolded, he sure wouldn\u2019t want to pick a fight with me anymore. I wanted you to realize that my mouth could hurt you more than my fists, kid.\u201cEveryone, please submit your course application forms.

Please keep in mind that you can\u2019t go outside unless you get permission from me or the headmaster.\u201dMr. Epinhauser left with these words and half of the students got up to leave as well.How each person spent their personal time was widely varied. Some of them were dedicated to self-improvement.\u201cHey, let\u2019s go to Main Street.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired\u2026. I want to go rest\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I know a nice place there! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it there, so want to come with?\u201dSome put there best effort into playing, like for example A-8 Kono Lint. Class B\u2019s lessons also ended.\u201cDo you know any fun places to go to?\u201dLudwig was asking his classmates if they knew any fun places to visit as this was his first time at Temple. Of course, everyone was completely exhausted from the P.E. lesson they had not too long ago today.\u201cWoah, look at these accursed eyes.\u2026.\u201dThen, I suddenly heard some quiet swears coming from somewhere beside me.I knew what they were talking about.They were talking about a girl that just left the classroom of Class B.\u201cWhenever I see her, I immediately feel my luck slipping away from me.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so creepy.\u201dErich de Lafaeri said loudly as if he intended her to hear everything. She must have heard it, but Scarlett just continued walking ahead pretending to not hear a thing.She had red hair and red eyes. They made it hard for her not to stand out.B-3 Scarlett.\u201cSuch an ominous thing can\u2019t possibly be born naturally.\u201dErich gritted his teeth while staring at Scarlett\u2019s back.\u201cI can\u2019t believe such a thing made it to the Royal Class. What bad luck.\u201dWhat do you know, you bastard? You don\u2019t even know that you\u2019re standing right beside a Demon Prince? Idiot.Erich calmly walked over to Scarlett and bumped into the girl as he passed by.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dScarlett began to pick up the items she dropped without saying a word, as if she was already used to that situation. Ludwig tilted his head as he looked at Erich\u2019s leaving figure.\u201cWhat, he bumped into you and didn\u2019t even apologize. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAs if trying to refuse his help, Scarlett quickly picked up her dropped items, turned away from Ludwig and walked away.Erich wasn\u2019t the only one.Most of the Class A and B students were also secretly avoiding Scarlett. There were those who just avoided her and those who didn\u2019t care at all about her. Erich only directly bullied her, but with the exception of Ludwig, everyone treated her the same.Sheesh.It didn\u2019t feel all that good seeing the bullying I set up happening right in front of my eyes.* * *Red was an ominous color.Born with red hair and red eyes, Scarlett was abandoned by her parents at birth. Her setting was that she got picked up by a beggar who took pity on her. My fabricated origin was something similar, but she really was from the streets.She was dragged to the guards a few times for stealing some bread, but one day her talent was discovered by a wizard that happened to pass by coincidentally and was sent to Temple. She had a great talent, so becoming a scholarship student was a given.However, she got bullied by the students in Temple all the time, getting called ominous.Scarlett had no other place to go once she left Temple though, so she just clenched her teeth, endured this humiliation and just went on with her life.\u00a0 Therefore, although she was physically very adept and talented at that, she was still stuck with those children bullying her. If she caused trouble and got expelled, that would be the end.So she got a scholarship and ended up in Royal Class. However, Erich, who had been tormenting Scarlett countless times even in middle school, also entered Royal Class.It obviously was that kind of setting.Anyway, the bloody eyed Scarlett had been famous among her classmates for a long time now. In a negative way.However, I realized how irresponsible I was when I set her as a target for bullying just because she stood out a bit.I didn\u2019t think there was anyone else who would look so good in her red hair and eyes. She stood out even from a distance because she was such a pretty girl.Red = Negative, so she got bullied for it?Flammable trash, that\u2019s what that was. She should have been Temple\u2019s idol, but she got bullied anyway. Actually, Erich should have fallen in love with Scarlett and just teased her, like little boys would harrass the girls they liked.But looking at all the things Erich would do to her, it would definitely not be to the point of simply teasing the girl he liked.\u201cIf I become an inquisitor, I will grab you first and tear you apart\u201d, obviously wasn\u2019t something one would say to a girl one liked. Ah.How could he say such things to such a cute and kind kid?But wasn\u2019t it actually me who wrote this?Aren\u2019t I the piece of trash then?Yes, I am.How could I make characters say such harsh things to a child like that?Yes, I absolutely deserved to die from high blood pressure caused by malicious comments.\u201cHaah\u2026.\u201dWhen I saw Scarlett walking to the dormitory area from a distance, I sighed, feeling guilty about making this strange setting with my own two hands.If I left it as is, Erich\u2019s bullying would intensify, leading Ludwig to become angry and asked Erich for a duel for the sake of Scarlett. So, a fight broke out and after many turns, Scarlett was freed from her bullying and they became friends.However, I had to watch this shit until Ludwig decided to come out\u2026.The rest of the kids also thought that the color red was ominous, so even those kids with a sense of justice would just remain silent.Sigh.* * *Those who returned to the dormitory would spend their time on their own until evening. Class B seemed to have gone to Temple\u2019s Main Street with Ludwig.Dinner time started at 6 pm. Since each dormitory had their own separate cafeteria in their dormitories, I would just eat at the dormitory cafeteria of Class A Year 1. Sometimes the whole student body would eat at the banquet hall, but that was rather unusual.Anyway, there was still time until evening. Class A was rather quiet compared to the noisy Class B.It felt more like complete silence actually.Well, there was no need to worry anymore since I had 1000 achievement points saved up. So I tried to decide which talent I should choose.[Self-suggestion \u2013 1000 Points]Self-suggestion.I acquired that talent without thinking about this any further. This was the most fraudulent supernatural power I could think of.As for how much of a cheat it was. I once wanted to give this power to one of the characters, but after thinking about it a bit more, I removed it entirely for how scammy that power was.So in other words, I had never used that setting. It seemed like data that I originally discarded got recycled. It was similar to the situation of the capital, which I imagined to have the same layout as Seoul, although I never wrote it anywhere, however, it actually turned out to have the same layout. Although, there were some abilities that definitely didn\u2019t appear.It was also great that it had the same point requirement as low level talents, as it was an ability that would evolve over time.I checked my status.ValierAge: 17Current stats: [Strength 3.5(F)] [Agility 4.4(F+)] [Dexterity 5.2(D-)] [Magic 9.9(C-)][Stamina 5.9(D-)]Race: ArcdemonTalent: Supernatural \u2013 Self-suggestion (Locked)Abilities[Demon Domination D](Unique to Arcdemons) (Cannot be used in current state.)[Self-suggestion](Locked)Comprehensive Ability Assessment \u2013 Lowest Level DemonCombat Level Assessment \u2013 FThere was a subtle rise in strength, agility and stamina. That wasn\u2019t just because of the p.e. class today, but also because of my hard work up until now\u2026.However.Wasn\u2019t there something strange?What does that (Locked) written behind the talent mean?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was just lying in bed and I discovered a weird twist. I had that strong permonition that I had been fucked.Yeah, I had a cheat, but it was certainly an uncooperative cheat. I should have looked into that more when I was buying an ability. Supernatural powers could certainly be used with just a single talent, so there must have been a good reason as to why it was sold so cheaply.I had a vague feeling of what was going on.It was wide spread common knowledge that supernatural powers couldn\u2019t be awakened though sheer effort.However, reality was a bit different. All those who have been found to have a talent for supernatural powers had \u201cawakened\u201d their powers. One could say, they were able to raise the level of their ability to such an extent in which it became apparent no matter if one could control it or not.However, there were actually a few people who had latent supernatural abilities. They just hadn\u2019t manifested yet.Such latent supernatural powers might awaken after being traumatized or being under immense psychological pressure. Even the one\u2019s with these abilities around me awakened after a traumatic experience.What?It\u2019s a common development.Awakening one\u2019s powers after exploding into anger.It\u2019s like those chuuni fantasies\u2026.Right\u2026?\u201cShit.\u201dI knew. I kind of expected it, but I still hoped it would be a little different in my case.I got it from my cheat, so I thought I could just use it right away. But I couldn\u2019t.I didn\u2019t buy an activated supernatural power. I bought a latent one.Yeah, I now knew why it was so cheap.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32The only one who naturally awakened was Number B-3, Liana de Grantz. The rest of the supernatural power users awakened unintentionally after experiencing something traumatic.Natural awakenings were extremely rare and shouldn\u2019t be taken as the norm. I didn\u2019t know how long it would take my power to just awaken naturally.Then, it looked like there was no other way than going through a psychologically pressuring situation to forcefully awaken my ability\u2026.I experienced something like that while I was escaping from the Demon King\u2019s Castle and I really didn\u2019t want to be thrown into such a situation again.Couldn\u2019t that experience be counted as a form of traumatic prepayment and just awaken me already?Of course, it couldn\u2019t. I thought I could maybe artificially awaken myself with achievement points, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Damn it, I wasn\u2019t expecting to be able to use it right away because it was still at a low level, but for it to not even be activated.What was even the use of this dog-like supernatural power, if I couldn\u2019t even use it yet?Okay, let\u2019s just think about the future first.I didn\u2019t intend to just settle with one talent. I had to think of a way to awaken my supernatural ability and what talent I should acquire next. I wished I had a talent that could be of help right away.When I confirmed the performance of Ludwig\u2019s talent today, I felt like it was incredible.[Swordsmanship \u2013 2000 Points][Archery \u2013 2000 Points]...The prices doubled. That was what I pretty much expected. I thought it might just multiply by 10, completely shattering my hope, but it, at least, left me with some hope, huh?However, I currently had 0 achievement points. I had invested all of them into buying this inactive supernatural power. At this rate one wouldn\u2019t even be able to detect that I had a supernatural ability.If they could do that, the Empire would sweep all of them up.There are two things I had to do from now on.One, I have to put extreme psychological pressure onto myself to awaken my supernatural ability.Two, I needed to earn achievement points to buy an additional talent.If I were to earn 2000 achievement points through events and challenges that would usually give me about 100 points, I would be able to get a second talent unless the prices changed.Right now, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what to do, so the only thing I could try now were the challenges.However, there were only those strange actions, crimes and things juvenile delinquents would do among them.However.[Write a love letter to one of your classmates and get dumped\u2013 200 Points]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was very easy to achieve, but it was also very easy to see that this challenge wanted me to trample all over my dignity.I mean, that kind of corssed the line.Wouldn\u2019t that mean I had to confess to a highschool kid and then get dumped?But why did this give me twice as much points while other challenges just give me 100?Ah.What if\u2026.Did they want me to humiliate myself?200 Points.Twice as much as usual.If I were just to suffer for a bit, I would receive 200 points.Apparently, that filthy bastard named Reinhardt, some bully who beat up his classmate on the first day, suddenly wrote a love letter to someone?If rumors like that were to spread about me, my image as a jerk with a bad personality doing pervy things would be cemented in everyone\u2019s mind. The risk of that was just too great. These were my classmates whom I had to see for the next 6 years after all.There was even that restriction \u201cclassmate\u201d. So if I sent it to the wrong person everything would be meaningless. Did classmate include Class B or only Class A?No.No wait.Let\u2019s see.Let\u2019s think about this differently.Let\u2019s look at this from a different angle.Rather, I found a much better method.[Receive a love confession from a classmate \u2013 1000 Points]This, I think, this might be possible?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Of course, Temple, which was a huge educational complex, didn\u2019t only have schools. There was no reason for there to not be a commercial district where children of wealthy families gathered endlessly.There weren\u2019t only high-class restaurants, but also cafes, clothing stores and entertainment facilities.So, the kids who liked to play spend most of their time wandering around Main Street, it was also known as an area in which students came to the most.\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d\u201cThis is where I\u2019ve been going to for the past 3 years, and almost everything there tastes good. I can assure you of that.\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019ve been here a few times.\u201dErich nodded at Kono Lint making a fuss. Cayer had his arms crossed and wasn\u2019t even touching the dessert in front of him.On the table the three sat at, were cakes, pretzels and other desserts spread out in front of them. They just bought some hot dogs Kono Lint recommended at a nearby restaurant and came here for desserts.\u201cHey. Just eat and relax.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cJust take a bite. It\u2019s sweet, you know?\u201dKono Lint smiled and pushed the plate towards Cayer. All of them, except Erich, were commoners, but it wasn\u2019t hard for Erich to get along with them, because the Lafaeli family were rural lords.Originally, those three didn\u2019t get along so quickly. However, they united on the first day because of one reason.\u201cYeah, we have to pay attention to that madman.\u201dIt was Number A-11 Reinhardt.He didn\u2019t have any talent, but had a bad temper, so that madman threw punches and swore like a sailor starting the first day of the semester.Because of Reinhardt becoming their common enemy, the three of them became close on the first day. Cayer even got hit by that man without any talent, and got punished by the teacher even though it was he who got wronged.\u201cNo, but why did you end up getting scolded?\u201dKono Lint didn\u2019t seem to understand.\u201cYeah. What happened?\u201d\u201cNo idea. I don\u2019t even know what that bastard meant with what he said. Anyway, something about me insulting Temple.\u201dUnfortunately, Cayer couldn\u2019t remember all the words Reinhardt kept on babbling out. But when Mr. Epinhauser heard Reinhardt\u2019s words, he rebuked Cayer with a serious expression.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Insulting Temple?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. That fucking bastard, I\u2019ll get him later and when I do I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201dAt Erich\u2019s words, Cayer quickly turned his gaze out the window with an irritated expression on his face. Every group needed to have a common enemy in order to form solidarity.Those three made Reinhardt their common enemy.\u201cHey, but aren\u2019t all the girls in our class really pretty?\u201dKono Lint suddenly lowered his voice. Erich nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Still I wouldn\u2019t tell them that face to face.\u00a0 We are classmates in Temple, but they wouldn\u2019t even give me a glance if we were outside.\u201d\u201cBut, hey, aren\u2019t we all in the same class now?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t only good-natured people like the prince among them. You have to be careful. Not to mention the Imperial Princess, there\u2019s the Princess of the Saint-Owan Grand Duchy and the Duke of Grantz is also a high lord. They have more prestige than the Emperor.\u201dErich was clearly drawing a line. They mingled in temple, but outside, they were people of completely different standing. No matter how young they were, they weren\u2019t the type of people he could touch even a single hair of.\u201cBut how about now? Wouldn\u2019t you be able to talk to them?\u201dKono Lint poked at them as if he was really interested in this topic.\u201cWho do you think is the prettiest? Huh?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cAh, I personally think it\u2019s the Imperial Princess.\u201dAs Kono Lint said so, Erich frowned as if he was unwilling to share. Erich and Cayer refused to speak, but after continuous prying on Kono Lint\u2019s part they eventually confessed.\u201cI think\u2026. Number 2.\u201dAt Erich\u2019s words, Kono Lint tilted his head.\u201cHer? What\u2026.? I mean, sure, but isn\u2019t she a little scary? I\u2019m speechless.\u201d\u201cYou asked me who I think looks best.\u201d\u201cAh, well. What about you?\u201d\u201cIf I had to say\u2026.\u201dCayer thought about it and then finally spat it out.\u201cDuke Grantz\u2019 esteemed daughter\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I can get behind that.\u201dThis was what kids and adults alike liked to talk about when they got together. Just when they were in the middle of talking about beauties.\u201cErm\u2026. Excuse me, but\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, all of them turned their heads hearing the voice of a girl coming from somewhere.\u201cCou, could you give me a minute\u2026. Would it be okay to talk for a bit?\u201dThere, a beautiful girl was shyly talking to Kono Lint. He nearly doubted his eyes.\u201cWell, here.\u201dKono Lint, who got dragged out of the dessert shop as if possessed, nearly had his head explode at this unknown girl shyly giving him an envelope.\u201cThi, this. Erm\u2026. What\u2026 Might this be?\u201dHe started speaking formally without realizing it.\u201cPlease read it\u2026.\u201dThe girl\u2019s face was flushed and she wriggled her body, trying not to make eye contact. When he opened the envelope as if possessed by something, there was a single sentence written on a piece of paper.[I fell in love with you at first sight. Please go out with me.]\u201cThi, this\u2026. This is\u2026.\u201dMale, 17 years old.He just experienced a miracle he had never even dreamed of in his life.\u201cEhm\u2026. What do you think\u2026?\u201dTo the girl\u2019s quiet question.\u201cI fell in love at first sight with you too!\u201dKono Lint nearly stumbled over his words.What the boy, however, didn\u2019t see was the corners of the girl\u2019s mouth slowly creeping up.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I sold my soul for points.[Achievement points: 1000 Points]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI thought about it, but when I actually put it to praxis I felt my heart break.Scared of confirming if the confession challenge was completed, I pretended I was busy and ran off.Then, I changed my clothes in a dark alleyway as to not get found out, turned back into Reinhardt and returned to the dormitory.It didn\u2019t say I had to \u2018Get the confession in the form of Reinhardt\u2019 in the challenge information after all.I noticed that blind spot and tried to exploit it right away, and it worked. It seemed like a good idea in my head, but when I actually did it, I felt like dying during every single second of it.I had preserved my dignity as Reinhardt, but I seriously tarnished my dignity as a human being and played with an innocent 17-year-old boy\u2019s heart, no matter how much I set him up to be a playboy.Kono Lint was a bit lacking, but by no means a bad guy.And here I trampled all over his heart.I feel like I\u2019ve become less then human feces\u2026.[Challenge list has been updated.]A message appeared in front of me. The remaining ones stayed the same, but there were some changes.[From now on, unless stated otherwise, the condition that all challenges have to be completed as \u2018Reinhardt\u2019 has been added.][Receive a love confession from a classmate \u2013 1000 Points](Clear)[Write a love letter to a classmate and get dumped \u2013 200 Points][Get punished by your teacher \u2013 100 Points][Leave some graffiti on Temple\u2019s Main Street after curfew \u2013 100 Points]Look at this bastard.Did you not expect me to take advantage of this weak spot? You added that condition immediately after I finished the challenge, didn\u2019t you?How annoying, fixing it right away, pah.The challenges were definitely only there to fuck me over. You didn\u2019t expect me to make use of an exploit, but I did, so you added that condition.You want me to write a love letter and get dumped so bad?Then,An unexpected challenge had been added.[Date Kono Lint as a pretty girl (Idiot) \u2013 1000 Points]Ah.Ah.Ah!That guy\u2019s watching me in real time! I don\u2019t really know how he\u2019s doing it but I bet he laughed his guts out while he watched me talk!My desire to disappear from the surface of this world grew ten times stronger.Even if the world were to collapse, I won\u2019t ever do that.* * *I sold my soul for 1000 points.I never thought I\u2019d manage to get that much in a single day. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I believe this wasn\u2019t the direction that voyeuristic ass wanted this to go.If I collect 1000 more points, I would be able to buy another talent. I wasn\u2019t even considering going on a date with Kono Lint.I returned to the dormitory thinking about how I should get the remaining 1000 points. Naturally, I threw the sweatshirt I wore while I met Kono Lint outside the shop, away and returned in another outfit. I didn\u2019t plan on leaving any traces behind.Evening.-Hehe\u2026. Hehehe\u2026.The sight of Kono Lint and the other two fiddling with their food looking at him with envious eyes made my stomach ache.I felt like I was about to throw up all my food because of this complex mix of guilt, shame and humiliation I felt.I felt so nauseous I couldn\u2019t get myself to eat the dinner. In the end, I wasn\u2019t even able to eat half of the prepared menu. I could certainly feel that the chef was really skilled though.However, I didn\u2019t think I could appreciate those skills today.Kono Lint seemed to be living in his happy delusions for a while. However, what will happen after that condition fades?Would he get depressed?No.Let\u2019s not care about him.As soon as I start to caring, I\u2019ll lose.Even though my supernatural ability hadn\u2019t even awakened yet.I left the restaurant while continuing to self-suggest myself.One might say this was a type of extreme psychological pressure in its own way.It had no effect though.* * *I\u2019d say I did a pretty impressive job for my first day. Although it was still inactive, I managed to get the supernatural ability I was aiming for and got a great amount of achievement points.If I somehow got 1000 more points, I would be able to get my second talent or I could use it for other purposes.It seemed I could, not only buy talents, but also randomly raise my stats, but I hadn\u2019t put that under consideration yet. My stats rose just by training normally. If I were to receive physical training similar to the one I had today, my stats would continue to rise.Unless it was a special case like the magic stat.And there was something I was worried about.If one saw profit once, one would crave for more. I earned 1000 points, but I was still hungry for more.You could never know when those challenges would disappear. I had no idea when that mysterious bastard changed his mind, right?The newly updated challenges probably wouldn\u2019t have any more weak spots and it seemed likely that their content would be more difficult or humiliating than before.Things, including skipping class, would lead to disciplinary actions. I didn\u2019t get into much trouble, but Epinhauser seemed to already have a certain picture of me because of the fight, and if I caused any more problems, I, of course, wouldn\u2019t get away with it.[Write a love letter to a classmate and get dumped \u2013 200 Points]It seemed to encourage me to write a love letter. I wrote a love letter earlier but I didn\u2019t get dumped, so I wasn\u2019t able to finish it.The condition was to get dumped after all.It was rather sad knowing that fulfilling that condition was just too easy. Under my current circumstances the probability of getting dumped was 100%..If I just endured that humiliation for a bit, I would be able to get 200 points, but then I still had to get 800 more.Actually, if that idea of using the Dreadfiend\u2019s ring to get a confession didn\u2019t cross my mind, I wanted to try something else. The problem of all this was that I might get bullied after rumors about this came out, however what would happen if the person I gave the letter to would not gossip about it? They would just treat me as werido.So it had to be a person that wouldn\u2019t start gossiping about me and also wouldn\u2019t care that much about me after the act.Ellen Artorius.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShould I or shouldn\u2019t I?Should I or shouldn\u2019t I?Ah.First I sold my soul for points.Was I now going to trample all over my dignity for points this time?* * *There wasn\u2019t any need for us to talk for long.Class A dormitory\u2019s gym.It was obvious where I would be able to find her, so I headed to the gym after everyone was gone.Ellen Artorius, who received my letter stating my desire to date her, looked at the plain text, then looked at me and spoke briefly.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAh, oh\u2026.

So she didn\u2019t try to approach anyone because she thought the other person would just push her away.She had tremendous talent, but she had no sense of superiority around her that usually came with it. She also didn\u2019t feel inferior that one would usually feel when faced with someone stronger than oneself.She wasn\u2019t acting all sweet, but she had a gentle heart.Of course, I set up a past for her, but that wasn\u2019t important now.Anyway, it didn\u2019t really matter whether I confessed to her or not. I wrote a love letter to Ellen because she wouldn\u2019t really care about this.I mean, I actually only did this for the points after all.However.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was bothering me.It was really bothering me.It wasn\u2019t because I liked her or something, but because I had now become very conscious of her!I felt so embarrassed and ashamed that I couldn\u2019t stand it. That bastard obviously wanted me to be in that state. This was just straight up bullying.-Now, move from this posture to this and\u2026.Tuesday.Ellen was sitting next to me in the swordsmanship theory class and I nearly went completely mad about it.Of course, Ellen and I were the only Royal Class students taking this class. All the other students were regular class students.Students wearing various types of school uniforms gathered here. And among those, who could recognize the Royal Class uniforms we were wearing, kept glancing at us.I could read their thoughts just by looking at their eyes.Wow, they\u2019re from Royal Class, aren\u2019t they?That was the look they gave us.Although they sure were an object of envy, these school uniforms attracted way too much attention..Bertus, Ludwig, Cliffman and Erich also should have taken lectures on swordsmanship, but they probably chose other lectures for this time slot.So, did she sit next to me because I was a classmate from Royal Class? Was it like that? You\u2019re usually not the type to care about these things though, now aren\u2019t you?Seriously, why did she decide to sit next to me?Sigh, was she not talking to me because of the sudden confession yesterday? Did she become conscious of me? That can\u2019t be. She wasn\u2019t like that. Then why did she sit next to me?What\u2019s this? Why was I fussing about this like some teenager?I\u2019ve become conscious of a kid like that just because I was trying to earn some points? Ridiculous!-Tok\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI dropped my pen because I couldn\u2019t stop fidgeting. Ellen picked it up silently and handed it to me.\u201cAh, uhm. Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWas this a positive sign?Didn\u2019t she usually not help people pick up their things? Based on her personality, she wouldn\u2019t care about these things, now would she?Of course, she wouldn\u2019t care about me after picking it up and just listened to the lecture. Ah. no, it\u2019s definitely not normal for her to pick up pens for others.No, but what should I do? I\u2019m not interested in her at all. What if she suddenly told me that she liked me? I couldn\u2019t accept that at all.\u2026\u2026.I had a problem.I started to imagine all sorts of delusional, ridiculous scenarios.Of course.At the end of the lecture, Ellen left the lecture hall without sparing me a single glance.Did she even recognize my face to begin with? She didn\u2019t even know who I was, did she? No, but we were wearing the same uniforms.My face was getting hot for no reason.* * *This was my class schedule, excluding common classes.Tuesday I would have swordsmanship theory, swordsmanship practice and magic theory.Wednesday was Magic Sensitization Training, Mediation and Supernatural Power Control.On Friday I had Divine Power Training, Alchemy and Integrated Martial Arts Training.Now, as someone of a lower grade, I only had to listen to three lectures a day, but as I got older I would have to listen to sometimes up to five or six lectures a day. The first three years were like high school courses, and the second half was like university courses.So, since I didn\u2019t have anything I specialized in, I was taking swordsmanship, magic, supernatural powers and divine power classes.Swordsmanship Theory and Swordsmanship Practice were combined lectures taught by the same teacher so it was a pretty long lecture in which one first learned about the theory in a classroom and then put it to practice in the gym.A class where one had to put to practice what one learned on the same day and even learn further things while practicing.Of course, as this was a general class as well, it wasn\u2019t a total mess, but there were a bunch of clumsy people among the students.\u201cGet your posture right! Put power into your hands!\u201dThe problem was, I was included in the category of clumsy people. Of course, I was constantly criticized by the teaching assistants for my poor basic strength as well as my poor posture.There were even a lot of general students who were so excellent that comparing them to me was completely meaningless, as they learned swordsmanship ever since their middle school days.\u201cPerfect. As expected from the Royal Class. She\u2019s on a completely different level.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen passed almost every task in one try because she had the physical constitution to imitate what she learned immediately, so her teacher praised her.The other students were also looking at Ellen, witnessing the skills of someone from the Royal Class.I didn\u2019t really know what the teacher was thinking, but she suddenly clapped her hands.\u201cAs far as I was informed there was one more student of the Royal Class here. Ellen and Reinhardt is what I heard. Is your name Ellen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cReinhardt!\u201dI looked over to them as I heard the teacher call my name. It seemed like she came up with a good idea.\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s have the first practice match between the Royal Class students!\u201dNo.I don\u2019t think that was a good idea at all.* * *They shoved a training sword into my hands all of a sudden, while I was still not done practicing my basic posture. Everyone gathered around, wanting to watch the battle between the Royal Class students. Everyone\u2019s eyes were sparkling.What kind of public execution was this?You want me to have a practice battle with the strongest person of my class?The teaching assistant who was training me just now, seemed like he wanted to say \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a good idea.\u201d but couldn\u2019t bear to tell the teacher.What if I die here, huh?Ellen looked at me indifferently and held her training sword.\u201cI\u2019ll stop it when it\u2019s going too far, so feel free to fight as much as you want.\u201dThat teacher said some dangerous words without blinking an eye. No, I didn\u2019t want to do this though?Before I was able to come up with a solution to somehow deal with this situation\u2026.\u201cNow, start!!\u201dI.-Tak!I didn\u2019t even notice Ellen Artorius approaching me.* * *An unfamiliar ceiling.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMy head was buzzing.Wha, what happened?I thought that I was probably lying in some sort of bed.Seeing as to how my head hurt, I had probably been hit by something.At that moment, the situation that happened shortly before I passed out appeared in my mind.Ellen Artorius rushed at me as soon as the start signal was given, and then struck my head with her sword.And then I passed out, I guess?No, but where was I\u2026.\u201cUrg!\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re awake.\u201dWhen I looked to my right, a calm, cold-looking girl with dark hair and black eyes was looking at me.\u201cThis is the infirmary, classes are over.\u201dI probably got taken to the infirmary after I passed out. The teacher, who seemed to be in charge, checked up on me.\u201cThe pain will subside soon. It\u2019s nothing serious, you don\u2019t have to worry, okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded at the teacher\u2019s words with a bewildered expression on my face.That damn swordsmanship teacher! Why did they do some practice match out of nowhere? You made someone faint! Can\u2019t you take your nose out of your ass?! Aren\u2019t you a teacher?!\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dEllen grabbed my shoulder as I was struggling to get up.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWere you trying to cheer me up?\u201cI didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t know swordsmanship.\u201dEllen lifted me up and helped me put on my shoes, while she was talking in a sullen voice.Wha, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201cOriginally, I planned to aim for your neck after you blocked my sword and let my sword flow down your sword to finish it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I, see.\u201dHer original plan was to force me to block with a straight strike then let her sword follow the flow down my blade and aim for my neck.However, I couldn\u2019t even react to the first hit, so she accidentally hit my head with her sword.In other words, this was an unexpected accident. An accident that occured because I was unexpectedly weak, that is.So.Was she doing this because she felt sorry?\u201cAh, Look. I think I can walk on my own now\u2026.\u201dAt my words, she lowered her arm supporting me. I had a headache, but I wasn\u2019t badly hurt. Anyway, how long had I been out?\u201cAh, don\u2019t we have to go to our next lecture?\u201dEllen shook her head at my words.\u201cIt\u2019s lunch time now.\u201dAfter the two lectures in the morning, it was usually lunch time. The second lecture was already over, and it was lunch time now so there was still plenty of time.No.Did that mean we were going to eat together?Probably not. She was just answering the questions I asked. I mean, I confessed to her yesterday, got dumped and today she one hitted me.That wasn\u2019t even a fight, it was a one sided beating actually.I couldn\u2019t feel any more shame. However, the other person didn\u2019t seem to care much, making me feel even more embarrassed.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Do you want to have lunch?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-NodWhat I had come to realize is that after you pass a certain level of shame, it just didn\u2019t matter that much anymore.* * *At first, she seemed like a quiet kid indifferent to most things.Yesterday, I confessed to her and she refused me, but right now I felt conflicted, because I asked that same kid to have lunch together with me now. I wasn\u2019t that kind of person usually.The kind of person that didn\u2019t give meaning to anything.She ate when she was hungry and didn\u2019t care who she ate with. Thinking like that made my worries go away..I just had to treat her however I wanted to as well. Unless I did something rude enough for her to slap me, that was just it.Because that was how she was.Thinking like that made my head clear. She was the type of person who would react the same no matter what happened, so it should be alright for me to treat her a bit more comfortably than the other kids, right?Because she didn\u2019t misunderstand me and didn\u2019t have any preconceived notions about me, she just judged me as I was.\u201cIs there anything you want to eat?\u201d\u201cAnything\u2019s fine.\u201dEh?\u201cAre you really fine with anything?\u201d\u201cYeah, anything\u2019s fine.\u201dNo matter how much I thought about it, this wasn\u2019t your fault, but you dumped me and hit me.I started to feel like teasing you a bit.Be prepared.* * *Since this place was similar to Seoul, there were places similar to the one\u2019s found in Seoul in the Imperial Capital Gardium.Maybe that\u2019s why there were so many familiar things. For example, the beggars found in the Han River Park or\u00a0the shopping street that was so reminiscent of the Yongsan District.And yesterday, when I went out to this street to meet Kono Lint, I found something I was shocked to see here.Wasn\u2019t that almost enough to make my whole worldview collapse? It was what I truly wanted.Ellen tilted her head at the sight of this food.\u201cIt smells strange.\u201dCheonggukjang.Ellen was unable to take her hands from her nose when she saw the cheonggukjang in an earthen pot.A musty, savory smell permeated the entire store.I had no idea why, but it existed.Why did you exist? Well, it was what I wanted the most right now.Anyway, It was the food of my hometown! I was so happy to get to eat it again, no matter what!And that\u2019s how I brought her here.What\u2019s the matter? You said you\u2019d eat anything, you know? Huh?If you\u2019re scared just run away then.\u201cThis smells like something I shouldn\u2019t eat.\u201dI shook my head at Ellen\u2019s words and pointed at the people who filled the store.\u201cThe people here eat it normally, you know?\u201dOf course, all of them were adults as well as faculty members. Ellen tilted her head as she looked at the people eating.\u2013 Temple sure is good. They even have eastern dishes here.-There are people from all over the world coming here. So yeah.Apparently, this was described as eastern food, although I had no idea about that setting. However, because Temple attracted students from all over the world, they had to prepare a lot of traditional food that one would usually not find anywhere but it\u2019s place of origin. If there there was demand, there would be supply. It was more expensive than somewhere else maybe, but where else would one go to get this kind of food?Well, that was pretty plausible.It was comparable to a New York food alley. As there were people from all over the world coming they sold a lot of international food.Anyway, cheonggukjang is one thing, but this was probably the first time that I felt happy that\u00a0jjamppong\u00a0and\u00a0kimchi\u00a0existed in this world.So did they also have\u00a0kimchi stew\u00a0and\u00a0army stew?No, wouldn\u2019t it be weird for there to be army stew? There were no American soldiers in this world, so how could there be food introduced by the US army?No, if one thought about it, cheonggukjang also had its origin somewhere else, right?What the hell was going on with this place?Where was I even?\u201cCome on, look.\u201dI started mixing the rice with the cheonggukjang, which I took out of the earthenware pot, sprinkled seaweed powder and sesame oil on it and then began to eat.Ellen watched me eat with a weary expression on her face.Are you discriminating against another culture right now? Do you want to get into trouble?To be honest, this wasn\u2019t really my favorite food, but it was something I kind of needed from time to time. She just continued to watch me eat in delight.Although it had a strong smell, I finally got to experience the taste of my hometown again after a long time.I was kind of touched by it, although not to the point of tears.What?This place actually made some great kimchi.That was it. The meaning of life.As expected, I was still an old man at my core.Did they have soju?\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t sell it to kids, huh?Ellen was staring blankly at me with a long, thoughtful look in her eyes.\u201cHey, Give that to me. I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201dI took her bowl of cheonggukjang, mixed everything in her bowl, scooped up a spoonful and carried it towards her mouth.\u201cOpen up. Try it.\u201d\u201cAh, uhm. Erm.\u201dEllen repeatedly opened her small lips, perhaps because of the stinging smell rising up into her nose. Her eyebrows and lips twitched, seeming as if she even doubted whether this was really human food.Looking at her reaction she seemed like a fish opening and closing its mouth. pretty cute, wasn\u2019t it?\u201cAh, my arm\u2019s gonna fall off, man!\u201d\u201cAh, ah\u2026.\u201dWhen I complained, Ellen finally opened her mouth and I put the spoonful of cheonggukjang into it.That was revenge for her hitting me.Ellen chewed a bit of it with an uncertain look on her face.\u201cHe,hehe. How\u2019s that? Feeling limp already?\u201d\u201c!\u201dEllen squeezed her eyes shut as she put it in her mouth whole with a frown on her face.It seemed like her feelings of rejection maximized after she put it in her mouth.Unable to spit or swallow, Ellen started stamping her feet.A blunt, chic and beautiful 17-year-old girl?Hah, there\u2019s no such thing as a permanent concept!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Eventually, Ellen swallowed it by pressing hard on her mouth, too afraid to make a fool out of herself by spitting it out. Perhaps because of the savory taste of the cheonggukjang, Ellen drank from her water several times.\u201cWhy\u2026. Does it smell so much\u2026.\u201dEllen continued to drink her water, while I continued to eat without being fazed. Ellen looked at me strangely as well as the other people eating it.You would end up like that as well if you ate it a few more times.Seeing me and the other people eat it with such fresh expressions, Ellen scooped up another spoonful and took it to her mouth with a slightly puzzled expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen, with a regretful expression on her face, she was unable to spit it out again, forcibly chewed it and swallowed it.\u201cAm\u2026 I the strange one\u2026?\u201dEllen muttered blankly to herself, her lips trembling slightly.She couldn\u2019t eat it, but other people around her were eating it normally, so she was wondering if something was wrong with her.It\u2019s fine.That was just the type of food it was to begin with! I hated it as well as a kid!It tasted like shit, but then one day I suddenly\u2026Ah. Cheonggukjang.Do I want that? I do!Everyone around my age is eating it after all!That was how it started, man.Ellen wasn\u2019t exactly normal either.Even though she ate it and greatly regretted it, she still went on to eat half of her portion though she couldn\u2019t finish all of it after one or two sips of water, as if she was confused as to how people could eat it so easily.\u2018Wow. This is so incomprehensible.\u2019\u2018Argh! Maybe like this? Will it taste delicious this time? Do I have to eat it again?\u2019\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201d\u2018Every time I put it in my mouth, urgh!\u2019That\u2019s how her thought process probably looked like. The face she pulled was just too funny.What. Did she have a child\u2019s palate?It was a bonus that the humble owner of this shop halved the price for us, impressed that children were eating choenggukjang so well.* * *\u201cI\u2019m not eating that again.\u201dAfter we left the restaurant, Ellen returned to her usual chic expression.Oh my.\u201cYou ate well for that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a strange smell\u2026. coming from my mouth\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoes it smell like shit?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEllen glared at me for a moment at my shameless remark.Ellen narrowed her eyes as if she could smell her own breath. Yes, and one day, this moment would suddenly flash past her as part of her black history, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201cWhy does it smell like that?\u201dEllen was deep in thought, as she couldn\u2019t understand why people would eat something that smelled like that, but what came out of her mouth was a more basic question.\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to eat this, right?\u201d\u201cHey, why would they sell something one isn\u2019t supposed to eat and actually have a lot of people pay for it?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u2026Right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s edible, so I ate it.\u201dDid I look like such a perverted bastard? My novels were all innocent, you know?No.If one thought about it, the genre already changed after I took a beautiful 17-year-old girl to eat cheonggukjang which she had never tried before. That in itself made me seem like a crazy perv, didn\u2019t it?If someone caught me do this, wouldn\u2019t they call this torture? No, but I didn\u2019t force her to eat it. She ate it willingly. She later even ate more and did this to herself.Not caring about me suddenly scaring myself like that, Ellen nodded blankly. She didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Maybe her curiosity had been sated. I was starting to worry that her character maybe collapsed\u2026.No, what would happen if something like that collapsed? Wouldn\u2019t the entire main story get completely destroyed?\u201cI\u2019ll go that way.\u201dAfter walking for a while Ellen pointed to the tram route she had to take to get to her next lecture. I had to go somewhere else.\u201cAh.\u201dThen Ellen turned around and pointed her finger at me.\u201cBe careful with your head.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dSaid the culprit who whacked my head.As such, the 17-year-old beautiful girl disappeared from my view, leaving behind the savory smell of cheonggukjang.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *My next class was Magic Theory. There were 4 students of Royal Class present in that lecture. A-10 Cayer, B-2 Louis Ancton, B-5 Christina and B-6 Anna de Gerna.As soon as Cayer saw me, he turned his head away as if he hadn\u2019t even noticed me and I wasn\u2019t acquainted with any of the students from Class B.That B-2 Louis Ancton guy, was a jerk who had a knack for being a snitch, so he probably told the teacher about that fight yesterday.I just let it go. I wasn\u2019t really that fond of fighting and he wasn\u2019t that bad of a guy, now was he?Currently five of my classmates were majoring in magic. Three of them of them were attending this class. Three of them were here right now, so why were there four people listening to this lecture?B-2 Louis Ancton had no talent for magic. He was an unusual guy who studied magic even though he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to become a wizard.I did mention that there were people like that.People who couldn\u2019t use magic but studied the science behind it.Those people were called magic researchers.Louis had the talent \u2018Academic\u2019 which was the highest talent in the field of research. He wasn\u2019t that physically capable, but he was smarter than no other.So he couldn\u2019t become a wizard, but he still pursued the study of magic.The magic class was quite different from what I expected.I first thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to understand a thing, but it wasn\u2019t that difficult to understand the proper terms, including jargon, because my knowledge seemed to be on the middle school level.The formulas were a bit difficult for me, but it wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t keep up at all.What? Were there maybe still hopes for me to become a wizard?Magic was said to be the study meant for geniuses, but did it maybe feel easier for me because there was already an intelligence correction applied to me?Come to think of it, that might actually be the case.Would I have been able to grasp this with my original level of intelligence?Or did Ellen\u2019s hit to my head have some effect on me? Surprisingly, I had no idea what happened. Maybe it would be a bad idea to aim to become a wizard if I already had intelligence correction applied to me while only barely being able to understand magic\u2026.\u201cOf course, this is only the basic level, but keep in mind that moving from theory to praxis will be much harder than just grasping the concept. You have to think carefully if you want to join the magic major. Also keep in mind the other students before you that have chosen this major. The Magic major brings forth a lot of failures as well.\u201dAh.That\u2019s right.I guess this was comparable to me thinking that Seoul National University would be a piece of cake while solving some elementary school tests.So, I was taking notes with the mindset that I would try as best as I could for the time being. It was better to use my head here, then do physical training at least.Then after a while.The teacher started explaining the existence of other types of magic systems.\u201c\u2026As a typical example, demons implement magic in a completely different way from us because their mana system is completely different from ours. \u00a0We still have to do more research on the subject of the demon\u2019s magic. However, even if we were able to learn how to use magic like them, we cannot be sure that we would be able to use it exactly like them.\u201dHearing that, my mind went blank.What was I even doing up until now?Come to think of it, even if I were to learn magic here, I wouldn\u2019t be able to use it at all, right? I had to go to Eleris to learn magic, and not to this place, didn\u2019t I?Why was I even staying here knowing it would be fruitless?\u201cOh, student? Where are you going?\u201dLet\u2019s make a clean cut.\u201cAh, I don\u2019t think magic\u2019ll work out for me. Teacher!\u201dI decided to drop it!*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The next day.The first lecture.Magic Sensitivity Training.\u201cGather the consciousness all over your body\u2026. Clear the mind\u2026.\u201dI was lying on a mat with my eyes closed. I could faintly hear the teacher\u2019s voice reaching my ears.-Now\u2026. Imagine the Universe is you.\u2026.What?-Take a deep breath\u2026. Breath in\u2026. Breath out\u2026.Spirit treatment?-Put your mind at ease\u2026.Wasn\u2019t this yoga?\u2013 Your body is becoming one with the univeeeeerse\u2026.Wasn\u2019t that similar to the first line? Huh? No matter how I looked at it, that guy was just some charlatan.-Feel iiiiit\u2026.The teacher\u2019s languid voice, sounding as if he drank alcohol starting this morning, made my whole body feel tired and relaxed, as if he was using hypnosis.-Now\u2026. The world is you\u2026. And yooou are the woooorld\u2026.Oh.-Feel it\u2026.The origin of this world\u2026. Maaaaagic\u2026. Ahh\u2026.-With your whole body\u2026. Accept it\u2026. You feel so comfortable\u2026. Your mind\u2026 feels heavy\u2026 It\u2019s going to siiiiink\u2026.Oh\u2026 Like this\u2026.\u2013 Your consciousness\u2026. Is gradually\u2026. Getting further away\u2026. You feel sleepy\u2026.After the Magic Sensitivity Training, conducted by this teacher that looked exactly like the head of a yoga class, was over, everyone looked like they had just woken up.\u201cThat would be all for today. I hope you all have a magical day.\u201dHowever, the teacher didn\u2019t really say much to us after we woke up and just told us to go out as the class was over.This Magic Sensitivity Training was an exclusive class for the Royal Class. Wednesday\u2019s lectures were usually only classes exclusive to the Royal Class. They were classes effectively taught in smaller groups.Except for supernatural power and divinity majors, it was normal for everyone to receive Magic Sensitivity Training. So with the exception of a few, every student of Class A and B were gathered here.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI know\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuh, what the-?\u201dEveryone looked as if they just were possessed by a ghost. I was just listening to what he said, but everyone seemed to have fallen asleep.\u201cI heard that this class was very satisfying. I bet something will happen.\u201dBertus also yawned as if he had just woken up, and then laughed.I didn\u2019t think that a class that only required one to sleep would have a low satisfaction rating, but\u2026.I didn\u2019t really know if this had anything to do with magic sensitivity.Anyway, it was an easy class, so it was fine.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The next class was Meditation, it wasn\u2019t a class exclusive to supernatural power users, but many with supernatural powers attended it. It was important for anyone to be able to keep one\u2019s composure. So, of course, it wasn\u2019t just for supernatural power users.Four of my classmates had supernatural powers.A-3, Liana de Grantz, Electrokinesis.A-6, Heinrich von Schwarz, Pyrokinesis.A-8, Kono Lint, Teleportation.B-7, Ibia Telepathy.There was one more person who took the meditation class even though they didn\u2019t have supernatural powers.He had white skin as dry as anchovies, which made one feel bad for him.However the look in his eyes seemed a bit dangerous.B-8, Dettomolian.His talents were witchcraft and spirituality.He came from a primitive tribe calling the northern snowfields their home. A guy who got admitted with a talent for an ancient form of magic called witchcraft.However, there was no way for Temple to have a curriculum on something like witchcraft only few practiced. However, Dettomolian wanted to enter Temple under the pretext of studying witchcraft on his own. He said he wanted to study in a safe and well-maintained environment.He looked insidious and was actually shunned just like Scarlett.He could also see ghosts.He was currently doing meditation not to control his mind, but to communicate with the spiritual world.There should have been only five people in total\u2026.\u201cCharlotte de Gardias.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte also signed up for the meditation class. They called us for attendance, which was rather fast as there were only few attending this class in the first place.This suggested the possibility that Charlotte had a supernatural power. I had no contact with Class B, so I still didn\u2019t know what talent Charlotte had.Of course, her taking mediation classes didn\u2019t mean that she absolutely had supernatural powers.I wasn\u2019t exactly a supernatural power user yet either.But Trauma.Awakening supernatural powers under extreme psychological pressure.Obviously, if Charlotte had a latent supernatural ability, she definitely would have awakened it in the Demon Realm.However, if she had supernatural powers, why didn\u2019t Charlotte use them then? She was in immediate danger, so wouldn\u2019t she have used it in that situation, even if it was on accident?Or did she awaken, but didn\u2019t know how to use it or couldn\u2019t control it?No, maybe she really didn\u2019t have supernatural powers to begin with?The meditation class went on, and I went into meditation with such questions spinning in my mind.-Tak!\u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cFocus.\u201dOf course, I couldn\u2019t properly meditate with such things floating around my mind.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35My next class was Psychic Control.With this I couldn\u2019t help but be sure.\u201cCharlotte de Gardias.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte had a supernatural power. What kind of ability did she possess?\u201c..\u2026 Reinhardt. \u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs they called my attendance, the supernatural power teacher looked at me confused.\u201cThis was Mr. Epinhauser\u2019s request, so I accepted it, but\u2026. You don\u2019t have any supernatural abilities, do you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard that your aptitudes were very multi-faceted\u2026. I don\u2019t know how I could teach you\u2026. How to awaken a supernatural ability\u2026.\u201dThe teacher looked perplexed and the other students also looked at me strangely. It was as if an herbivore came to an all-you-can-eat meat buffet.\u201cIt\u2019ll work out somehow.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dIncluding the Teacher and Charlotte\u2026Everyone was looking at me, dumbfounded.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *-Bzzzt! Crackle!\u201cExcellent, Miss Grantz. You have the best control out of everyone in class.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cTry to increase your power output in that state little by little.\u201dLiana de Grantz sighed in relief as she succeeded to let sparks bounce between the index fingers of both her hands.Unpredictable things could happen in the supernatural power control class so the teachers were teaching the students one on one.-Flaaare!\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s see how long you can maintain it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHeinrich von Schwartz, who succeeded in lighting a fire on sand, was sweating profusely trying to maintain his concentration.-Wo, woah! Don\u2019t look!-I\u2019m not seeing anything. Anything at all. Lint. Get dressed.And I could hear Kono Lint\u2019s screams coming not from the classroom, but the containment room, followed by the teacher\u2019s fed up voice.Kono Lint.Although he was a total playboy, he had a pretty fraudulent ability, that is, the ability to teleport his body.But his biggest problem was that he couldn\u2019t teleport his clothes as well. So the biggest side effect of his power was that every time he used it, he\u2019d end up naked.He was often teased that his ability could only be used in public baths.Naked Teleportation. I kind of wanted it, but on the other hand, not at all.It wasn\u2019t a bad ability to have.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go to Main Street to have crepe for lunch today. Is that correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go outside now. Try it again then.\u201d\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd B-7 Ibia was using her telepathic abilities. The ability to send her own thoughts into the mind of an opponent. They seemed to be doing a range test at the moment.\u201cReinhardt\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Teacher.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dMy teacher had a perplexed look on his face as if he didn\u2019t know what to do with me who didn\u2019t have a supernatural power at all.I would find it weird as well if I were in his shoes. This was a place where supernatural ability users were trying to control and improve their abilities, not to awaken them. So my teacher was at a loss.\u201cPlease put me under extreme psychological pressure.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cOne might awaken a supernatural power in an emergency, right?\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cSo, you don\u2019t have to actually try to kill me, just push me to the brink of death and\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask for something so strange!\u201dThe teacher freaked out, as if I was saying something completely outlandish.That teacher straight up refused, saying that he couldn\u2019t torture a student like that. He also added that there were times when one awakened to a supernatural power in such situations, but that wasn\u2019t always the case. If that were the case, the world would be full of supernatural power users.No.I know that.Actually, I did have a supernatural power.No matter how hard I tried to persuade them, they didn\u2019t seem to want to listen to me, so I just observed the class.And.Charlotte.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dCharlotte was taken somewhere by her dedicated teacher after the class started. Were they doing an ability check in the containment room like they did with Kono Lint? Was it a type of ability that should not be seen by others? I looked at the teacher and asked.\u201cWhat type of supernatural ability does the Princess have?\u201dI was just asking. Casually. You could ask such things out of curiosity, right? That\u2019s what I thought anyway.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHowever, the teacher just shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret or something\u2026.\u201dConfidential.It was then that I understood why no one was talking about Charlotte\u2019s ability.Charlotte had awakened to a supernatural ability.And no one knew what type it was, except a few teachers.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I had no other option but to silently wait until the class was over. Charlotte, who went somewhere and returned shortly before the class ended, looked tired.The Princess\u2019 ability was confidential. Maybe her classmates didn\u2019t know either. For some reason they treated her abilities like some state secret\u2026.Mr. Mustrang and the teacher in charge of her ability training were probably in the know.Did Mr. Epinhauser know?Charlotte was a supernatural ability user, and any talk about her abilities was under lock and key.If so, I should also consider the possibility that she didn\u2019t actually have one.There was also the possibility that she may have faked powers she didn\u2019t have in order to get into Temple as a member of the Royal Class. Well, whether that was possible or not is another question.So, did Bertus know what ability the Princess held? It was getting more and more troublesome. If the Princess didn\u2019t have any abilities and Bertus knew, then he wouldn\u2019t have a reason to stay silent about that. So, by that we can conclude that Bertus either also knew the Princess\u2019 supernatural power or he didn\u2019t know yet, no matter if the Princess had one or not.As the class was over, the teacher called me over.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI will allow you to join the class for now, but keep in mind that you will receive failing marks if you decide to continue.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\u201dThere was no way a person without a supernatural ability could be given any kind of grade in a class focused on supernatural abilities.When I nodded my head gently, everyone was looking at me as if I was crazy. No, well, I did get that they wouldn\u2019t have any other choice but to fail me like this.I had no intentions of failing though.After class everyone left the classroom.\u201cHey, No. 11.\u201dAnd then, someone called out to me.\u201cHuh, what?\u201dIt was A-6 Heinrich von Schwarz who called me. I could see at first glance that he wore a bad kind of expression on his face and everyone started to stand by and decided to watch what was going on. Charlotte was already gone though. She seemed tired after all.\u201cIs Temple a joke to you?\u201dHe looked pretty uncomfortable, even if I pretended not to notice. It was the same for the others who gave me dirty looks.\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cThen why does a person who doesn\u2019t have supernatural abilities worm their way into classes for supernatural ability users?\u201dWhy was that bastard asking something so obvious right now?\u201cBecause I want to awaken one.\u201dAt those words, the expressions of the other kids, including Heinrich\u2019s, changed drastically as if they just heard something absurd.\u201cDo you seriously think that\u2019s possible?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? You never know if you don\u2019t try.\u201dHeinrich frowned as if he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\u201cI heard you\u2019re attending all major\u2019s lectures, right?\u201d\u201cThat I do.\u201d\u201cDo you seriously think you could do anything just because of your infinite aptitudes? You really believe that? Huh? You want to be a supernatural power user. Hah! Do you think you can be a Swordmaster or Wizard just because you want to?\u201dThe other students looked uncomfortable as well. Yeah, it did look somewhat bad, huh?\u201cI\u2019m just doing this because I think I might get something out of it.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026.\u201dHe looked exasperated.\u201cNever mind, just don\u2019t come to the supernatural power lectures anymore. If you come again, I\u2019ll grill you, you know?\u201dIt seemed like he didn\u2019t like the fact that I was taking the supernatural power classes. It looked like Heinrich tried to intimidate me by telling me he\u2019d grill me.\u201cGrill what? You wouldn\u2019t even be able to grill a potato.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my estimate after watching the size of your flame. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dHe did make some fire burn in the sand, but it was definitely not as good as a bonfire.Heinrich turned red at my words.\u201cWhat a great ability you have. If all you can do is make your eye color change and make a somewhat big fire with your arms trembling, wouldn\u2019t a flint be much more useful than you?\u201d\u201cWha, wha\u2026. What? Thi, this\u2026.\u201d\u201cWould you like to compete with it? You or a flint? Which one would be better? I expect a landslide victory for the flint. Flints don\u2019t run their smelly mouths like you do.\u201dHeinrich, whom I compared to a flint, was stammering, probably never having imagined to get insulted like that.\u201cN, n, now\u2026. D, do\u2026. Do you, even\u2026 know who you are in, insulting right now?\u201dThat guy eventually said some words that should never be said in here after getting pushed a little.\u201cThe one I\u2019m insulting is A-6 Heinrich von Schwarz. No matter how much you are of some fucking noble family, who\u2019d care about that in Temple?\u201d\u201cHow dare you insult the royalty of the First Principality, subject to the Heave-\u2026.\u201dI raised my hand as I watched him chatter on.\u201cAh, you should apologize to me.\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to mention your status in Temple. Did you forget that rule?\u201dI looked around at the spectators watching us with stunned expressions.Everyone who took the class, except Charlotte, were here. Kono Lint, Liana de Grantz, and even Ibia, were watching from afar.\u201cWe have witnesses here. Did you hear everything?\u201dHeinrich\u2019s face turned blue as he realized that he had just broken that rule in his excitement. Everyone suddenly looked away and frowned, when I was asking for witnesses.\u201cIf you don\u2019t apologize to me in three seconds, I\u2019ll report it to the student council.\u201d\u201cOoone.\u201d\u201cTwooo.\u201d\u201cThreeee.\u201dI turned around with that momentum. One more rule violated.\u201cSorry.\u2026I was acting too reckless.\u201dHe was a little late, but I smiled at him as he did give me an answer straight out.Why would you start an argument if you can\u2019t even finish it?\u201cWatch your mouth next time, buddy.\u201dI tapped his shoulder and whispered.\u201cThis is a place where royals wouldn\u2019t be able to complain, even if they get beat up by a commoner.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cThat means, if you do, things will be turned right back at you regardless of your status.\u201dNo matter what status he held, he wasn\u2019t even good enough to be a portable lighter here. Just when I was about to go past him, I heard him hitting the back of my head.\u201cHow dare you, you cheeky bastard!\u201d\u201cAh, what now?\u201dThe color in his eyes was getting more saturated.He looked like he was turning on a faucet. It seemed like he was trying to use his power.\u201cFrickin hell.\u201d-Slap!\u201cUgh!\u201dI casually walked over to him and hit his forehead with my palm. Of course, he staggered and was unable to use his ability like he intended to. I disturbed his concentration after all.\u201cAh\u2026? Huh?\u201dHe looked like he didn\u2019t understand what happened just now. It was like something that shouldn\u2019t have happened, had happened and he couldn\u2019t even articulate properly.It almost looked like he had question marks in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m gonna give it to you, you fucktard.\u201dDidn\u2019t these kids know that a fist would be way faster? Everyone was watching me blackly as I casually smacked the Prince of the First Principality. He seemed astonished beyond absurdity.\u201cHo, how\u2026 How dare that bastard touch my body!\u201d\u201cIt was legitimate self-defence. Weren\u2019t you trying to burn me just now?\u201dHe stared at me trembling while I just stood there nonchalantly.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you want to grill me? Huh? Go ahead. Try.\u201d\u201cI will kill you!\u201dThe color in his eyes got more saturated again.-Smack!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201cDid you think I would wait for you to charge up, you idiot?\u201dWas he stupid?\u201cEvery time you try to use your ability, you\u2019ll get a smack in the face. Okay? I\u2019m nice, so I\u2019ll keep it a secret that my dear classmate tried to attack me with his ability. Huh? You do know what a pain it\u2019ll be if I report this, right?\u201d\u201cI, I, Iiiiiiirrrrrk!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Didn\u2019t you want to kill me? Come on.\u201d\u201cHuup!\u201dAs soon as I raised my hand, he started holding his breath and pulled his head back.\u201cWhat a little coward.\u201d\u201cY, yo\u2026. You dog-like bastard\u2026.\u201dHeinrich\u2019s face was flushed red. It seemed like he was terribly embarrassed by the fact that he got scared.Eventually, he couldn\u2019t endure his anger anymore and rushed at me.-Crash!\u201cUgh!\u201dI smoothly took that childish rush of his and threw him off.There was no way that a well-bred royal knew how to fight. He was also a supernatural power user.\u201cWell, you think you can manage with your body alone?\u201d\u2013 Stomp!\u201cHey, hey! How about trying to get rid of these dirty feet of mine, huh?\u201dI turned to the spectators who didn\u2019t even have time to close their mouths as I stepped on Heinrich\u2019s head.\u201cYou guys clearly saw him trying to use his power on me, didn\u2019t you? Huh?\u201dLiana de Grantz was staring blankly. Kono Lint was almost trembling.They never imagined seeing such a scoundrel in this place.Anyway, that was that, but having a fight with a classmate and using their powers on a classmate were two crimes of very different magnitudes.\u201cI know you have a lot of pride, but do it in moderation, you hear?\u201dI mumbled coldly as I stepped on his head.\u201cWas I hurting you? I was just quietly taking this class. So why did you have to pick a fight with someone who was just staying quiet? The way I see it, shouldn\u2019t you be grateful to me? As I don\u2019t have any supernatural powers, aren\u2019t I laying the groundwork here?\u201dI squatted down, grabbed Heinrich\u2019s hair and whispered into his ear.\u201cYour ability\u2019s range currently is 5 meters across, it takes 10 seconds of preparation time and its firepower is less than a bonfire.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI observed today\u2019s class. So, as Heinrich and Liana continued to learn how to use their abilities, I practically had no other choice but to figure out the extent of their abilities.As I accurately gasped the extent of his powers, he opened his eyes wide, almost tearing them apart.\u201cIf you try to use your powers on me one more time in the future\u2026\u201dHow could I stay still when I had nothing. If someone would stand completely still in front of someone who clearly despised you while not possessing anything, that would be asking to get yourself killed.\u201cAt that time, if I don\u2019t suddenly change my mind in those 10 second, I might as well rip out your eyeballs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Mr. Epinhauser say it before? Huh? Let\u2019s be careful of each other.\u201dIf you didn\u2019t do anything and just endured it, you will be looked down upon.Being a fool was acceptable, but one should never be a pushover.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36On the first day I had to beat up Cayer.And on the third day I had to beat up Heinrich von Schwarz. This time, I wasn\u2019t called to see the teacher. If I were called in, I would just testify that he tried to use his ability on his classmate, although it would be a pain.However, this was different from the time with Cayer.Cayer was a commoner, Heinrich von Schwarz was the prince of Kernstadt, the first Principality of the Empire. Although he wasn\u2019t its successor, he was still a descendant.In other words, he was a descendant of the royal family, who had the second highest authority after the Imperial Family.\u00a0 This would be seen a shocking event by anyone, no matter how much they enforced the principle of equality and treated everyone fairly regardless of class.Rather than criticizing me, it seemed like everyone was avoiding me. They seemed to perceive me as a madman, someone actually crazy. At this point they didn\u2019t see me as just something dirty, rather I turned into a scary existence in their eyes.No, I mean, should I have let go of that guy who suddenly started arguing with me and tried to use his ability on me just because he couldn\u2019t stand the sight of me sitting still? Should I have actually gotten grilled, huh?After that, Heinrich would leave his seat as soon as he saw me, as if he saw something dirty. It seemed like he turned around in fury and anger, but he couldn\u2019t raise his hand against me in Temple.I didn\u2019t want to be seen as a pushover, so I became a nut job.Because if I didn\u2019t do this, some genuinely strong person might want to pick a fight with me. It would only be a matter of time before that would turn into a bloodbath, right? If that were to happen, I should absolutely get an ability I could actually use.Would my slow attacks even do anything against someone with a combat talent?My quiet life had been ruined, by none other than myself. So I had no other choice but take this route. It would be completely useless to pretend to be nice and kind to these people.And thinking back about it.I didn\u2019t think that I was ever really nice before. I mean, someone who gets actually mad at some kids in their thirties definitely had some problem with their head, right?The atmosphere of Class A, which had always been quiet, became even worse because of me.Did I actually become a type of villain in the story I wrote? I didn\u2019t do this on purpose, you know?No matter how one looked at it, I was the bad guy here.An initial villain who had no real power but a bad temper, right?After Thursday\u2019s common classes, evening.\u201cReinhardt, could I talk with you for a second?\u201dAfter dinner, Bertus finally called out to me.* * *After dinner, Bertus took me to a patio tea table. He still had a friendly smile on his lips. On the table was a teapot filled with black tea. He probably prepared this beforehand.\u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d\u201cWell, sure.\u201dBertus poured the tea gently into my cup. He put milk into his tea, while I just drank it as is. The Prince didn\u2019t seem to have any hostility towards me.I couldn\u2019t figure out what he thought about me being so casual with him by his expression alone.I didn\u2019t let my guard down because his expression didn\u2019t tell me anything.He was an aspiring Swordmaster. Those who picked a fight with me were mostly physically weaker than me. However, the Prince was someone who could step all over me if he so wanted. Both physically and politically.I wasn\u2019t his match in either of those aspects.If Bertus tried to impose physical sanctions on me\u2026How should I respond?It was the right decision to just become one of those typical strong against the weak and weak against the strong types.Bertus looked at me with a soft smile.A friendly attitude that seemed devoid of hostility.Ludwig was deceived by that attitude. Countless other people were, too.It was a soft smile that could even deceive me, who shouldn\u2019t be deceived by it.\u201cThey were all asking me to do something about this matter, so I\u2019ve decided to speak on their behalf with you.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cThey are afraid of you.\u201dHe euphemistically said they were scared of me, but in the end they simply didn\u2019t like me.\u201cOf course, I can understand your behavior to a certain extent. On the first day, Cayer was rather aggressive towards you. Even in the changing room.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it was also Cayer\u2019s fault for saying that your admission was of fraudulent nature.\u201dThe Imperial Prince.It wasn\u2019t me, but the Prince who was upset by Cayer\u2019s remarks that undermined Temple\u2019s authority. Did you feel refreshed inwardly after you came to stop the fight?\u201cI heard that you acted because you were indignant about him insulting Temple, not you personally.\u201dWhether he heard it from Mr. Epinhauser or through other channels, he knew about my appeal. That\u2019s why Bertus knew I pretended to be a patriot.\u201cAs a student of Temple I have to look at every person fairly. I have no choice but to. Although it is true that my heart is drawn towards such patriotic people.\u201dWhat?What\u2019s with that weird development?\u201cReinhardt, I like you very much.\u201dThis.The storyline got really weird!My hands would tremble less if he told me that he was going to kill me.What\u2019s with this? What direction is this going to? Huh?Bertus heard what I said to Mr. Epinhauser, and was now admiring my patriotism? No, well, it was a matter of course that the Imperial Prince holds strong patriotism.So he was looking favorably upon me? Because he thought that I was enduring all these insults towards my person, but would punch out as soon as Temple was insulted because I was that much of a patriot?Bertus was fiddling with his teacup while still wearing a soft smile.\u201cStill, I think this time you have gone too far. Of course, touching someone of a royal family is far more dangerous than a commoner. I\u2019m not talking about that point though.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI believe our dear classmates\u2019 imagination is running a bit wild.\u201d\u201cImagination?\u201dWhat did he mean?Bertus smiled as he looked at the nightly landscape of Temple as if he could see something beyond the horizon.\u201cThere is no way that a man with no talent whatsoever would ever touch the House of Schwarz with nothing to rely on\u2026. That is what they are spreading.\u201dI began to understand what he meant. \u2018Even if he was crazy, he\u2019s so crazy that there has to be something behind him\u2018, that\u2019s what they thought.\u201cSo\u2026. They think I\u2019m hiding something huge?\u201d\u201cCorrect. It could be a talent or it could be the power of your family\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dIf I were them I wouldn\u2019t be able to understand my behavior either, if there wasn\u2019t something like that behind me. They thought there couldn\u2019t be someone out there, not even a madman, who would beat up someone of a royal family out of rage.\u201cIt\u2019s not common, but there are people like that. People who hide their own status and enter Temple as commoners.\u201dI knew about that. There were students who couldn\u2019t live under their family name or those who had to hide their background for various other reasons, for example they don\u2019t want to get noticed. There were even such cases where they send a young nobleman here as a commoner, hiding his family background, and what he was met with was utter contempt, as such receiving true education.I was mistaken as someone like that.\u201cWhat\u2019s worse, even Heinrich is starting to believe it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hah?\u201dRecently, Heinrich had been avoiding me, pretending to sleep as soon as he saw me. It wasn\u2019t because he thought I was dirty, but because he truly thought I was scary?\u201cBy the way, how many families are there that aren\u2019t afraid of the Schwarz family?\u201dThings were going into a completely different direction I expected it to. They thought I had some background that would enable me to punch someone of the Schwarz Royal Family without a care.If so, wouldn\u2019t there be only one option then?\u201cI believe the others think you are the hidden son of a Royal Family.\u201dA child\u2019s imagination was sometimes even beyond an adults understanding. No, what stupid idiot would send their hidden son into an environment with two members of the Imperial Family?\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know that\u2019s not true.\u201dBertus looked at me as if he wasn\u2019t such a fool to believe in the trivial imaginations of children.Then he tilted his cup, still having that gentle smile float on his lips.\u201cSo, Reinhardt, let me ask you a question.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs there something you can place your trust in?\u201dBertus knew that me being from a Royal Family was nonsense. However he still was curious. About my true background. Even Bertus didn\u2019t seem to believe that I was just some ruthless guy in the end.However, the nature of my background could never be revealed. As it was on the level of turning the entire human race against me.\u201cAs if.\u201dI sighed and folded my arms.\u201cI don\u2019t need some crazy background to punch some fucker who\u2019s trying to walk all over me, now do I?\u201dI\u2019ll just go with that route.It was already too late to fix this anyway. I\u2019m sticking with the nut job route. So what if I hung some dog-bastard out to dry?I also had the Dreadfiend ring, so I could disappear any time I wanted.Bertus looked at me blankly with a slightly dumbfounded expression.\u201cHuh\u2026. You mean\u2026. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2026. So, you don\u2019t have something like that?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou just did that because you were in a bad mood?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Hah.\u201dBertus, who had been smiling all this time, slightly licked his lips.\u201cHaha, ha. Hahaha. Hahahaha. Haha!\u201dThen he suddenly burst into laughter. Bertus laughed for a long time, like a man who lost his mind.After laughing for a while, Bertus looked at me.That look chilled my spine. His eyes felt like those of a snake.This was Bertus true face. Just by looking at him one could feel goosebumps run up one\u2019s back.He looked at me with those eyes and quietly tilted his teacup.\u201cIn a situation like that, one would usually lie.\u201dIt was a lie.No, it could be seen as a lie, kind of, right? I did have a certain background. Ah.It might be a background that exceeded anyone\u2019s imagination though.\u201cIf you told me you had some great background or something, I would have have ignored you in the future.\u201dBertus was showing himself to me completely raw. It was completely different from those guys who had been yelling and swearing at me before.It was indeed a young man\u2019s gaze, but it seemed frozen.\u201cIt was wise of you to answer honestly. Reinhardt.\u201dHe seemed to have expected me to bluff my way out of this situation. I was just pretending to be that kind of person to not get beat up. Did he do a background check on me? Did he already know that I wasn\u2019t actually some big shot, and by saying these things was he trying to find out what kind of person I was?I shrugged my shoulders.\u201cI could have lied that there was nothing, though?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if there really is nothing about you, but you aren\u2019t a nobleman at least.\u201dBertus set down his teacup and stroked the rim with his fingers.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that a nobleman wouldn\u2019t know how to hold a teacup.\u201dThe tea wasn\u2019t prepared for no reason.He looked through me just by observing how I held a teacup and drank the tea.When I realized that my unconscious actions gave away information about my background, I got goosebumps all over my body.I was the one who set up this character, but it was hard for me to put into words how this guy was scaring me.If I bragged about my background he would have just ignored me. But I told him that I wasn\u2019t much. So what?\u201cYou should have bluffed, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought about what Heinrich von Schwarz could do to you?\u201dI kind of thought about it. Of course, I rushed in with my body first, but I did organize my thoughts later. The price I would have to pay for touching someone of the Royal Family of Kernstadt, the First Principality of the Empire.However, I knew about Heinrich von Schwarz\u2019s background. I was pretty confident that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt me.\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cThe moment you step out of Temple, you might disappear without any trace for hitting someone from the House of Schwarz. Don\u2019t you worry about that?\u201d\u201cSure do.\u201dNo, I didn\u2019t really. Because something like that would never happen in the first place.\u201cThen when I told you that Heinrich was afraid of your unknown background, wouldn\u2019t it have been good if you kept these fears alive?\u201d\u201cSure would have been.\u201d\u201cThen why did you tell me the truth? Heinrich is very likely to harm you, and you should feel afraid of that.\u201dHeinrich was of a Royal Family, rather hostile and joined the Royal Class.However he was currently more or less in exile.No one in the Schwarz family looked favorably upon Heinrich. That was why Heinrich\u2019s status was just a shell. In reality, he was just some guy with no power or status.Therefore, I already knew that there would be no retaliation against me from that family he was practically abandoned by far in the distance.However, to tell him that I knew about these things would obviously be suspicious.So why did I deny this misunderstanding that would have kept me safe?\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been any good to tell such shallow lies in front of the Imperial Prince.\u201dIt would be better to say that I had foreseen this situation. I judged it to be more dangerous to deceive Bertus in order to keep myself safe from that guy called Heinrich.That was what I was going for.At my word, Bertus began to stare at me.\u201cI could tell Heinrich about this, you know? Wouldn\u2019t that be problematic for you?\u201dI felt like walking on a thin sheet of ice. Turning Bertus against me would put my life at risk. I decided to use the nut job route, but he wasn\u2019t really picking a fight with me, so there was no reason for me to snap at him.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\u201cYou said that when I lied, you would have just ignored me in the future. Then wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019d do something if I didn\u2019t?\u201dMy hand was just a dog\u2019s paw after all.Then, in this situation, Bertus wouldn\u2019t ignore me, but would try to do something.Maybe he\u2019d offer me a solution.Maybe he thought something like I wasn\u2019t someone he should ignore.\u201cAnd I do think Heinrich wouldn\u2019t be able to touch me, whatever my background, assuming he\u2019s not completely braindead.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cNo matter inside or outside of Temple, it wouldn\u2019t be normal for a Temple student, and a Royal Class student at that, to suddenly die in the Imperial Capital Gardium.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd if I actually were to die, the culprit would be all too clear. A Royal Class student from a commoner background fought with a member of the First Principality\u2019s Royal Family. If someone like that were to die suddenly, it would be very obvious whose knife stabbed him.\u201dIf I died with that timing, it would be obvious who killed me, so, of course, Heinrich would be the prime suspect. Bertus was smiling more and more.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be possible for the Schwarz Royal Family to use their power to cover up this case?\u201d\u201cOf course, that might happen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201dI looked at Bertus and smiled.I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but I couldn\u2019t stop now.\u201cI don\u2019t think our homeland, the Empire, would be swayed just by a Principality. Rather, wouldn\u2019t they be asked to pay for tarnishing Temple\u2019s honor?\u201dBertus\u2019 lips began to curl up at the expression \u2018homeland\u2019. Was he more patriotic than even Mr. Epinhauser?Now that I thought about it, my death would be a much bigger deal than I thought. I knew it wouldn\u2019t happen, but I decided to use my confidence in Temple and the Empire as the reason for that belief. Bertus seemed to admire my judgment.Bertus liked smart guys. He certainly picked up something about me, but it was different from our other classmate\u2019s judgement. Of course, it was because I knew a thing or two about this place\u2019s common sense.\u201cGreat.\u201dBertus was grinning as if there was no more need to talk.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I came to like a cheeky guy like you so much.\u201dWhat? What was with this situation?\u201cReinhardt, let\u2019s enjoy our life at Temple together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dWhy was the first person I got close at Temple the villain?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Why do you think that the first friend you made at Temple would make a good friend?Talented Villain.1. Nice to his subordinates.2. Would be able to hide me,So, becoming Bertus\u2019 subordinate wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing, but I was still scared. It did have advantages, but wouldn\u2019t it look like I\u2019m a double agent? Was he going to treat me like a subordinate in the first place? It would be hard to keep that going for a long time.If he were to place me under his wing, wouldn\u2019t he be the first and only member of the Imperial Family to ever make a Demon Prince their subordinate?Anyway, Bertus seemed to want to maintain a close relationship with me in our future Temple life.Of course, I knew Bertus.He was a talented guy. Whether they were commoners, nobles or royalty, if they had the ability, he would have serious interest in them.It didn\u2019t matter what kind of person they were, as long as they proved to be useful. That was the type of person he was.Bertus sat on the terrace railing this time. It was on the first floor, so one could go outside from it.He talked with his back to me.\u201cDo you love the Empire?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t a lie. I really did love it. This was the best place to live on the whole continent after all.\u201cWhy do you love it?\u201dHe didn\u2019t like obvious answers.\u201cBecause of money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What? Money?\u201dBertus turned his head to look at me. He\u2019d find out if we continued to be like this anyway, but I had to be a little more honest here.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to love a place that allows a helpless beggar to live in a palace like this just because there\u2019s something strange about him.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Beggar?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even on the level of not having any background, kid.\u201cI\u2019m from the streets.\u201dI was a beggar!Bertus opened his mouth slightly as if he had never imagined something like that. That made it clear that this guy didn\u2019t run a background check on me. Bertus didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, perhaps bewildered or perplexed, he nodded blankly as if he came back to his senses.\u201cAh, right\u2026.Yes\u2026. I know what you mean.\u201dI had been wandering around the streets.\u201cIf you dislike me for being a beggar, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dHe was fine with commoners, but what about beggars? We weren\u2019t just a Prince and a Pauper, we were the Imperial Prince and a Beggar.\u201cNo. I prefer it that way.\u201dHowever, Bertus gave me an unexpected answer. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He preferred it?\u201cBecause there\u2019s a strong basis for loyalty.\u201dNot only did I get to live in this place just because I had some form of talent, but it was also possible for me to hold a conversation with the Prince like this.He seemed to think that one could take my loyalty to the Empire for granted then. Yeah, that certainly was a convincing statement. As if he found it funny that I put it as being loyal because of money, Bertus chuckled.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of light hanging out with a beggar would shine on you. Well, my origins aren\u2019t exactly a secret or anything.\u201dI told Bertus another point I thought might be a problem. Surely it wouldn\u2019t paint a good picture and my origins would spread someday.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dHowever, Bertus cut me off.\u201cReinhardt, do you know about ants?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d\u201cDid you know that they have a hierarchy in ant society?\u201d\u201cLike queen ant, worker ant and so on?\u201d\u201cYes. Like that.\u201dBertus was staring outside, as if he was peering through the darkness. Why was he talking about ants out of nowhere?\u201cQueen ants, worker ants, soldier ants and so on, there might be even more complicated systems, or none at all, but I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201dWere you proud of not knowing that?\u201cWhat do I know about classes among ants.\u201dBertus said coldly.\u201cBeggars, commoners, nobles, princes, dukes, counts, barons. Why would I care about that?\u201dThat was the type of guy Bertus was.\u201cThey look all the same below me, Reinhardt.\u201dBertus laughed grimly.\u201cSo, whether Heinrich von Schwarz criticized me or you criticized me.\u201dHe had pretty intuitive logic.\u201cIt would be all the same to me.\u201dAll were equal below him.Whether it was a soldier ant or the lowest of those ants trying to criticize him, he wouldn\u2019t care either way. He put it in quite the dog-like way, but in the end it meant he didn\u2019t care what I was.He told me not to worry about that and not to be too nervous about these things.\u201cThe core message is great, but the way you put was quite intense.\u201dLook at that twisted bastard.\u201cThat\u2019s what power is, Reinhardt.\u201dBertus giggled.\u201cThose who have it, have the freedom to be snobbish.\u201dHis choice of words were rather radical. Isn\u2019t it nice being treated comfortably?The powerful have the freedom to be snobbish.\u201cHowever you don\u2019t have that kind of power and yet you are the way you are\u201dAs for Bertus, he seemed interested in me because I was acting frivolous even though I didn\u2019t have any power at all. Because of that, some people judged me to be some mysterious person in the end.\u201cYou\u2019re a beggar and yet you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. Your eloquence isn\u2019t normally found in someone born in poverty.\u201d\u201cThere are all sorts of people in this world.\u201dBertus looked at me. It was as if he was trying to peer through me.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s find out what you are really hiding.\u201dHe seemed convinced that a beggar wouldn\u2019t be capable of that. He\u2019d treat me as a friend, but Bertus was obviously suspicious of me. However, one couldn\u2019t just manipulate my origins.That said, I didn\u2019t even try acting like a stupid beggar.I wasn\u2019t all that disappointed, as it was an inevitable result.In the end, Bertus wouldn\u2019t fully trust my background or rather the lack thereof.He didn\u2019t tell me to come under him, nor did I say that I would go under him.\u201cBut it is true that I don\u2019t have any abilities. So is there anything about me that you\u2019re interested in so much that you want to get closer to me?\u201d\u201cThose talents as meager as a rat are useless as of now. That\u2019s not to say that a physical scanner could explain everything about a human being.\u201dAfter Bertus revealed his true face, he didn\u2019t pretend to be kind in front of me anymore. Talents as meager as little rats. Bertus was criticizing the Royal Class students for being useless.He seemed to think that it was foolish to only believe in what that physical scanner showed. He was focused on indicators that that thing couldn\u2019t show.\u201cI\u2019d prefer someone who could use his head a little better a hundred times over some measly talent. Of course, someone with a good head on their shoulders punching people left and right is rather problematic. Well, as that was how you used to live, I can understand your behavior to some extent.\u201dBertus chuckled. \u00a0It seemed like he judged me as someone who was smart and had good judgement, but as soon as someone started to argue with me I would use my fist first. Since I was a beggar, he seemed to think that that was why I acted like that.No, but\u2026.I wasn\u2019t actually a beggar\u2026.\u201cWell, what I wanted to say stays the same, in the end. Try to hold in your temper.\u201dWe came back to the beginning and he ended up saying the same thing.\u201cI\u2019ll try, but only if those brats can be communicated with.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. That\u2019s all for now.\u201dBertus came down form the terrace railing and stood in front of me.\u201cWhen I\u2019m sure you\u2019re mine, let\u2019s talk about some more important things then.\u201dThe time for Bertus to trust me.The time for me to trust Bertus.That time hadn\u2019t come yet.But Bertus did recognize my worth, which is why he threw out the bait first. Something like \u201cDon\u2019t forget who recognized your value first\u201d.I knew without even thinking about it who came first.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I became friends with Bertus. No, we weren\u2019t quite friends yet. Anyway, even if I hadn\u2019t quite gained the Imperial Prince\u2019s favor yet, it did seem like he saw me in a positive light. I seemed to have been judged as a useful guy.There weren\u2019t any visible effects of that. He wasn\u2019t acting too friendly. Of course, we would talk casually, regardless of whether other people saw us or not. There were probably some rumors floating about by now, that the Imperial Prince was kind even so some crazy asshole.Classes on Friday included Divinity, Alchemy and Synthesis.Divinity studies were for those gifted with divine powers, so the only ones taking the class were Erich and Ashir from Class B. The rest were all regular class students who wanted to be priest or paladins.Of course, I understood what they were trying to teach, but I couldn\u2019t sense divine power at all. Using divine power as a Demon, would seem pretty funny, wouldn\u2019t it?Everyone who majored in Magic would study Alchemy as well. Unlike magic classes, Alchemy seemed quite doable. It was a fun class because it was a practical one.General Martial Arts.I almost fell behind while trying to understand it.In the end, this was close to P.E. Part 2.Fortunately no one, except Ludwig, even dared to make eye contact with me. It seemed like the rumor that I was a total nut job went around the Class A and B kids.When Erich saw me today in Divinity Studies, he seemed to avoid me and that man named Ashir who was also majoring in Divinity from Class B, immediately turned his head as fast as lightening after he made eye contact with me once.Well.I wasn\u2019t a bully, just some psycho they wanted to avoid.And the truth behind that rumor of me having some mysterious background still didn\u2019t seem to have spread yet.Did Bertus want the misunderstandings to be resolved on their own?It was true that I was an ill-tempered person, but I was also talentless. So if a strong guy came along, I was confident that that person, beating me up would set things right, but it seemed like those types of people were avoiding me because of that misunderstanding.Hidden royalty?Children and their imagination\u2026.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *As a rule, Royal Class students had to live in the dormitory. Of course, since most of the Temple students came from far away countries, most of them lived in Temple, but there were also some Temple students that lived in Gardium, so there were some cases of students commuting to school.Of course, Temple was huge, so one had to get up very early to leave the school and go outside.Among the members of the Royal Class, those who had a mansion in Gardium often went home on the weekends. There were no compulsory activities during the weekend. Everyone was free to study, play or do whatever they wanted.I could stay in the dormitory, but I\u2019d just be alone anyway. I had no clue how to awaken my ability.Well, I\u2019d better let them know how my first week went.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Where would I go?Of course to the Rotary Gang, the sewer area under the Bronzgate Bridge.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, you\u2019ve been beating up the kids, is what you mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026so to speak, erm, that\u2019s how it was.\u201dWhen I told Loyar about my Temple life, she looked at me. She seemed to think I hadn\u2019t gotten rid of old habits or something. After all, the way I acted kind of felt the same as the original prince, huh?\u201cNo, but it was them who picked the fight. Would I hit the back of the head of someone who was just minding their own business?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dAt my plea, Loyar looked at me as if I would do that.What\u2019s with that guy?\u201cPaw.\u201d-Pat\u201cDo, don\u2019t do this, Your Highness\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you keep looking at me like that, I\u2019ll tell you to show me your stomach.\u201d\u201cI, I really don\u2019t want to do that, Your Highness\u2026.\u201dShe was more straightforward than anyone I knew.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Naturally, Sarkegaar and Eleris weren\u2019t here. It was only Loyar. The gang members I met on the way asked me if I was doing fine in Temple, so I answered appropriately.Of course, I didn\u2019t tell them that I was beating up kids.\u201cI heard the Imperial Prince and Princess entered Temple as well.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?

In a way, just entering Temple was quite the dangerous endeavor, but now two of my classmates were of the Imperial Family.\u201cSo far, everything\u2019s fine, but I think the Prince is trying to lure me to his side.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.

Loyar seemed to be worried that my life would be in danger at Temple.And I didn\u2019t only come here to report my life at Temple to her.\u201cAnd, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like you to look into if you could.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s something Sarkegaar should do, to be exact, not you personally.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how far the reach of Count Argon Pontheus was, but Sarkegaar had the ability to transform, so it would be relatively easy for him to gather some information.\u201cIt seems like the Princess has a supernatural ability, and that power is considered to be confidential.\u201d\u201c\u2026The Princess. You\u2019re telling me she has a supernatural ability?\u201d\u201cYeah. I want you to look into that. Of course, there\u2019s no rush. I just feel a bit queasy having something in front of me that\u2019s kept a secret.\u201dI had a feeling that I needed to know what Charlotte was capable of. Perhaps Loyar hadn\u2019t even thought of that as she furrowed her eyebrows.I wanted to confirm if that confidential supernatural ability the Princess was said to have, was real, or if it was just a lie fabricated so that she could enter the Royal Class.If she held a dangerous ability, I had to be careful.\u201cI will relay the message to Sarkegaar.\u201d\u201cHow is it going with the train vendor strategy, by the way?\u201dA smile spread across Loyar\u2019s face, hearing my words.The Rotary Gang had changed their strategy from selling candies to passers-bys to selling goods on trains.\u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cOh, how good exactly?\u201dLoyar explained to me that their sales had risen to an unprecedented level.The items they sold also seemed to get good responses as they also sold simple snacks along with candy.Anyway, it felt rather weird for them to become general merchandisers.\u201cI was thinking about what toys to choose to sell, but I don\u2019t think things are running so badly as is.\u201d\u201cStrictly instruct them not to fight with the passengers, tell them to just get off or go to another compartment if they seem about to get into one. If they start hurting the passagers, sanctions will be imposed at the Imperial level. Then our business would be over.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dThis was an unlicensed business. If the vendors started to be shunned and caused the passengers inconveniences, there might be a possibility that the city guards would be dispatched to drive them away, or they might even permanently place guards on the trains.It would be nice if their income was stable enough to cut ties with the Thieves\u2019 Guild. It didn\u2019t feel particularly good for my group to potentially get controlled by someone else.I was about to go back after telling her those things, but Loyar called out to me.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t visit Eleris or Sarkegaar in person.\u201dNo, I was actually planning to stop by Eleris\u2019 shop though.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSince you are supposed to come from this place, it\u2019s alright to visit, but places like the mansion of Count Pontheus or Eleris\u2019 shop might be considered unnatural.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Yeah, that\u2019s true. But do we have to implement that already?\u201d\u201cYeah, there was a tail on you already.\u201dWhat? No, how did you detect that in the first place?\u201cI didn\u2019t take any actions because they seemed like Your Highness\u2019 classmates, but you will have to be careful with your actions in the future.\u201dI never thought that there would be people tracking my actions for some reason.I was careless.Dropping by the Rotary Gang was a good thing, because I was supposed to come from this place. However, things would have gotten dangerous if I went anywhere unusual like Eleris\u2019 Shop or the mansion of Count Pontheus.However, I couldn\u2019t believe I got followed.I wasn\u2019t some super human, so I couldn\u2019t just suddenly stop in some alley and go: \u201cHey. Come out\u201d. That was just impossible.I didn\u2019t have to think much about the reason why they followed me, because I could roughly guess. They probably went after me, because they were curious about how great I really was.I should refrain from going to the Rotary Gang from now on. Loyar told me that she would send me a message from her side if necessary.There was the possibility that the Prince might put tails on me, so if I came into contact I seriously had to check my back. I was really very glad that I first stopped by the Rotary Gang. If I decided to go anywhere else first things might have gotten pretty troublesome.And.\u2013 Here comes the beggar.I was now facing a less cumbersome situation compared to being caught.* * *Upon hearing Loyar\u2019s warning I immediately returned to Temple. I also went to talk to the guys I believed might have followed me.However as soon as I entered the lobby of the Class A dormitory, all the students who stayed behind were staring at me with a look of contempt. Apparently, the rumor had already been swept away. They knew I was a beggar.And the guys standing on the forefront, Cayer and Erich, were staring at me.\u201cHey, why were you hanging out with the beggars under the bridge? Are you a beggar?\u201dI nodded at Erich\u2019s words.\u201cHuh. You\u2019re just a bum from the streets?\u201dWhen I readily agreed, the expressions of the people looking at me became spectacular.I guessed they were expecting me to deny having hung out with beggars. However, when I just came out as a beggar, they were dumbfounded.I stared at Erich and Cayer.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re trying to tease me for being a beggar and making a fuss about it. But, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t heard this crap once or twice before. It\u2019s annoying.\u201dI sighed with my arms crossed.\u201cIf I were you guys, I would rather not touch me if I knew that I was from the streets.\u201dAs I took one step closer, Cayer as well as Erich stumbled a step back..\u201cWha, what? You\u2019re just a beggar\u2026.\u201d\u201cYo, you dirty bastard rolling around with beggars\u2026. Stay away from me\u2026..\u201dIt was kind of funny how they were running their mouths while feeling scared shitless.\u201cWhat do you think would happen if someone who lived a rough life on the streets suddenly came here and some bastards were staring down at them?\u201dI took yet another step towards them while they took another step back.\u201cHuh? Your eyes are spinning suddenly. Yeah, you\u2019re supposed to be scared of this, right?\u201dAs I approached them with gleaming eyes, they tried to retreat. Eventually they reached the couch and fell on top of it. They looked white as a sheet as if they were intimidated by my words.\u201cI don\u2019t think you know this because you\u2019re still kids, but you don\u2019t mess with people who have nothing to lose.\u201dYou\u2019re glad that I was just a beggar? I don\u2019t have anything like a powerful background, so you think you can handle me?Adults, you see, are more afraid of people like that.People who had nothing to lose wouldn\u2019t think about what they could lose by doing certain things.\u201cIf some crazy guy down on their luck feels threatened, huh. I don\u2019t know. Like this. They\u2019ll hit you. You want to feel that? Huh? If you want me to show you, just say so. Ah, don\u2019t you want to know? You do want to see it, don\u2019t you? So, do you want me to show you or not?\u201d\u201cTha, tha\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuh, should I show you or not!?\u201dI shouted at Cayer.\u201cN, no\u2026. No\u2026.\u201d\u201cNext. You, you bastard. Erich. Should I show you? Tell me.\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2026. Show me what\u2026. What do you want to show me!?\u201dErich frantically shouted.\u201cHow about showing your right eye what your left eye looks like, huh? Do you think I won\u2019t be able to harm you even with a knife because you\u2019re stronger than me and you have decent stamina?\u201dWhile I explained with a dirty look, Erich shook his head violently, his face blanched, perhaps imagining it.\u201cI see. If you ever feel like wanting me to show you that, you just have to follow me again.\u201dWhen I smiled at them like a psycho, those kids looked like they were about to pee their pants.Those who were watching this scene weren\u2019t any different.They seemed to wonder what was wrong with a beggar bastard like me.In fact, they seemed to have realized that I was an even crazier psycho than they first thought.\u201cIf you\u2019re so full of energy on the weekend, just play some ball. How could kids not know how to play like kids\u2026. Tsk.\u201dI patted the cheeks of those two who had just lost their face.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It seemed that it was Erich and Cayer who followed me. I also wondered if Heinrich would come at me all excited after he heard that I was just a beggar, but he didn\u2019t.The fact that I was a beggar would probably spread around rather quickly, but thanks to that scene I just showed them, the rumor that I was just some maniac who didn\u2019t know how precious life was would spread much faster.I was sure they would become even more reluctant to touch me, although it would probably be better for me if I didn\u2019t directly saw these kids giving me ugly looks. Well, right now I was just keeping them at bay with my crazy gangster bluff, but depending on the results of my training I would become a real hard hitter.I mean, what else could I do?Even if I got into a fight and acted tough, what was most important were my abilities after all, so it was important to unlock that damn locked ability.In the end, I couldn\u2019t think of anything even after the sun went down, so I was kind of worried.Just when I was thinking about my future.-Knock, knock.Someone knocked on my door.What?Is it finally time for me to show them something nice? Were they coming to pick another fight with me? Did they forget already?\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dWhen I opened the door, I saw a totally unexpected person standing there.It was a pretty girl who was wearing a track suit even though it was the weekend. My apprentice in the studies of Cheonggukjang.It was Ellen Artorius.\u201cGo to the gym.\u201dNot \u201cWould you like to come to the gym\u201d but \u201cGo\u201d? What was she talking about? Who told her to bring me to the gym?\u201cWho wants me to come?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think she\u2019s a senior.\u201dSenior?What nonsense was that?\u201cThe others went, too.\u201dWhat was the meaning of this?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Somebody had to go call me, but no one wanted to do it, so it seemed like Ellen went. But why the hell did a senior call us?The gym was in the form of a very large hall. All the Year 1 Class A students present in the dormitory were gathered here, except those that were away over the weekend.Everyone was there except Bertus and Liana de Grantz, who had a mansion in the Capital.So there were 9 people in total\u2026.Why were they doing that?\u201cIs he the last one?\u201dEllen nodded her head. I could see my classmates in prone position and a little kid trying to keep as grim of an expression on her face as possible.That little brat spoke.\u201cWhat are you doing? Lie down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you get down already?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform, but she was indeed a kid. I mean, I was a child as well, but she was more of a child than I was.Wasn\u2019t she just a middle schooler?But that brat was supposed to be our senior?Ellen lay face down next to the other children. The little one then looked at the lying children and started to talk.\u201cGuys. I think your friend has rather bad ears.\u201dThe children were staring at me and seemed to cuss me out very hardly with their eyes. They were telling me to quickly lie down. No, but why were these prideful bastards doing this just because of one little brat?\u201cDon\u2019t you understand words?!\u201dThe little brat screamed.\u201cWhat kind of senior are you?\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2026?\u201dAs soon as I said that, the little brat\u2019s expression turned into bewilderment.\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2018re a senior? Someone as tiny as you? What\u2019s so crazy about this little thing that everyone is lying on their bellies?\u201dThe faces of my classmates who were lying down turned bizarre.\u201cYo, yo\u2026. You don\u2019t know who I am\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, get out of here before I flick you. So annoying.\u201d\u201cEeek!\u201dWhen I raised my hand suddenly, the little brat stepped back in confusion. Her face turned blue.How could this girl be like that? That look.She seemed confused.\u201cY, you\u2026. You are done here.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dThe blue faced little brat gnashed her teeth at me and strode out of the gym. Everyone was looking at me blankly, doubting their own eyes at this crazy thing I did again.Although, this time, my mad act seemed more welcome than before.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you getting up?\u201dEveryone slowly began to get up with puzzled expressions on their faces. I looked towards Cayer, not the others.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dHe was a pushover after all.\u201cAh\u2026. No, this.\u201dCayer hesitated to explain as it might hurt his pride.\u201cAh, hey!\u201dWhen I came towards him with a harsh look in my eyes, he hesitated first but then opened his mouth.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39\u201cWhat a sight.\u201dWhen I heard the explanation from Cayer, I was dumbfounded and burst into laughter.What transpired just now was a tradition passed down from generation to generation in Class A.They called this \u2018Draining\u2019. They did this to prevent the nobles and royalty, who were said to be narrow-minded, from acting up. It seemed that this absurdity came into being as a means to show everyone that they were equal.As a result the 2nd graders would come and knock down the 1st graders. They would also tell them at the same time that they should never lose to Class B and that they would kill them if they ever lost to them. They were trying to do that today, the first weekend after the start of the school year.That\u2019s why they were making people lie down regardless of their status, telling them that there were only the seniors who were superior to them regardless of their status. So it was rather ridiculous for me to act like that towards her, so that brat was dumbfounded.I had no idea something so absurd was a tradition in Class A. This was mainly due to my focus on the Class B dormitory. That unwillingness to lose to Class B of Class A was also coerced by their seniors. Something like that?The students of Class B would have fun, eating good food with some nice seniors\u2026Students from Class A sure had a lot of personality, regardless of grade, huh?Well, I was sure to be the one who had the biggest personality of them all though\u2026\u201cSo a commoner upperclassmen would come here to teach the freshmen of Class A like this every year?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard\u2026.\u201d\u201cWho was that brat just now?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a sophomore and her name is\u2026 Her name is\u2026\u201d\u201cRedina, she didn\u2019t tell us her talent.\u201dKono Lint who was next to him told me in his stead. So originally, this was an important event of a commoner completely crushing the sense of authority of the royalty and nobility. This year, that little brat was the one in charge.Anyway, they probably felt it was ridiculous for everyone to be treated like that, but as it was a tradition they were clenching their teeth. Even if it hurt their pride a little, it would hurt a lot more having to leave Royal Class.They must have thought that all the other nobles and royals of the Royal Class had received that treatment.Anyway, the royals and nobles swallowed their pride and were quietly undergoing the process of de-authorization, to find out what it\u2019s like to be a beggar.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was focusing their attention on me for some reason. Everyone was just staying in the gym wondering if it would be alright to leave like this.\u201cHey.\u201dNo. 4, Harriet de Saint-Owan, called out to me worriedly. That Harriet with the Magic talent.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWill you take responsibility if this goes wrong?\u201dIt was like she was asking me why I didn\u2019t just leave that pride that had already been bent, bent. She had a pretty face, but was ferocious, and a total jerk.\u201cAnd what would happen if it went wrong?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d look bad to our seniors.\u201dI thought she was talking about what image the seniors had of us.\u201cAnd what would happen if they see us in a bad light? What then?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat will happen if the seniors see us in a bad light?\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2019s it\u2026.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you be able to go to class or won\u2019t you be able to sleep? If they beat us up, we should report it to the teachers. Why did you flop on your belly if that\u2019s all there is to it? Do you guys have no guts? How could you have even less pride than me who came from the streets? Tsk.\u201dSigh. When I looked at everyone disdainfully and tsked, everyone, except Ellen and Cliff, had red hot faces.They probably thought that if they didn\u2019t listen they would get into trouble, so they clenched their teeth, thinking about the honor and social recognition they would receive after graduating from the Royal Class.They felt like shit, but they tried to bear with it, but that\u2019s when I waltzed in and flipped the table.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s your responsibility! We did what we were told! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that! Okay?\u201dHarriet yelled at me, thinking that she had just lost all her pride and face.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if this will mess up my life at Temple.\u201dIt seemed that Harriet thought that I would be no harm to her because I kept still and didn\u2019t touch her before.What a joke.\u201cKill me? Were you just saying whatever came to your mind? Do you think I can\u2019t beat you?\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cWhere could status and rank, as well as the difference between man and woman be found in\u00a0 the Royal Class, which views everyone equal before talent? If you act big, you\u2019re gonna have my handprint imprinted on your cheek for the next few weeks. You hear?\u201dI\u2019m quite experienced when it came to death. I had already died once after all.None of you have died before, right? Well, I have!As I took a step closer, Harriet slipped back in surprise.\u201cThe only thing you got going for you is a hard head. So how are you gonna kill me?\u201d\u201cHe, he\u2026. H, Head?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWhen I treated the Princess of the Saint-Owan Grand-Duchy as someone whose only strength was her hard head, everyone\u2019s expressions became strange.\u201cHu, huh\u2026. Huh! Huh!\u201dHarriet felt more insulted and humiliated then when she had to lie on her stomach, so her face turned apple red and she couldn\u2019t bring out a single coherent word.-Bang!\u201cCome forward, you bastard!\u201dAnd.This time a group of people stormed into the gym.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *There were a total of five people who stormed in. They were probably in their second year of high school, so they were 18 years old. Of course the kid from earlier was among them as well.\u201cIs it him?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe little brat called Redina hid behind a male classmate and pointed at me. What, you were just some cute little brat with your classmates, huh? This looked like a little sister calling her big brother after a fight. That guy looked like he was about to shout \u201cHow dare you mess with our child with that attitude of yours?\u201d.The senior who seemed to be the leader of the group, was looking at me with a twisted expression. Wow, it was so bizarre to see a high school student do this in real life.\u201cHey, junior. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cHuh. You\u2019re probably from some great noble family and don\u2019t know how the Royal Class operates\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a noble though?\u201dIt seemed like I was mistaken for some kind of aristocrat, and despite the circumstances, laughter erupted among my first-year classmates.\u201cWhy are you laughing? What\u2019s so funny?\u201dThe atmosphere behind me became chilly again due to this senior\u2019s criticism.\u201cSo what? Are you a royal?\u201d\u201cNope?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dThen the boy\u2019s expression turned strange. I was neither a noble nor a royal. So there was only one conclusion.\u201cWhat are you saying? The only one from the Imperial Family here is supposed to be Bertus? You\u2019re Reinhardt, right?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s from the Imperial Family?\u201dI laughed and then said:\u201cI\u2019m not a noble, nor am I a royal, nor a part of the Imperial family, but just a beggar from the streets, what about it?\u201dEveryone was stunned by my bold declaration.\u201c\u2026. A beggar? You are a beggar?\u201d\u201cYeah, a beggar.\u201dEveryone seemed shocked at how casually I was saying that. The one that seemed like their representative looked at me with his arms crossed, completely speechless.\u201cNo, then why are you acting so high and mighty like the nobles and royals do?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do something, you don\u2019t. What\u2019s the big deal? Can\u2019t a beggar have pride?\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dHe clenched his fist and began to approach me.\u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to beat it out of you. Let me give you a good beating.\u201d-Pow!I felt it as soon as I got hit.That guy was the real deal.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The atmosphere was even chillier than before.\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201dIt hurt like hell. That was all I could think off. His fist hit really hard, no joke.\u201cAnd haven\u2019t you been really silent since earlier?\u201dWhen I stepped back holding onto my stomach, he started approaching me slowly.I\u2019ve been acting like I was mad up until now, and I thought I would be able to get this guy like that.However, this was unexpected. This guy was a senior after all, not one of my classmates. It seemed clear that our physical abilities couldn\u2019t even be compared with. That was the difference a year could make.\u201cIf you are part of Royal Class.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrg!\u201d\u201cFollow the Royal Class\u2019 traditions.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cIf it were up to me, you would be long dead. Got that?\u201dI was getting helplessly beat up by an 18 year old kid while he was casually talking. I couldn\u2019t stand getting beat up like that, so I ran towards him.\u201cHeh.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrrg!\u201d\u201cDid you just try to hit a senior, huh?\u201dAlthough he was startled by the fact that I tried to punch him, that guy avoided my fist just by moving his head a bit. He then laughed and grabbed my hair.\u201cThis bastard is for real.\u201d-Pow!He beat my chest.\u201cReally.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrgh!\u201dHe hit me in the abdomen.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d-Pow!\u201cHeup!\u201dI got hit in my face. My classmates and seniors were watching me get beat up blankly.What was surprising, was\u2026The look on their faces wasn\u2019t a refreshed one. They were obviously looking scared.I realized it as I got hit in the head.Even though I couldn\u2019t fight.I felt like I had won.\u201cYou\u2019re just a little bit-\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d-Kak!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201cGot you now, you fucking bitch.\u201d\u201cKuaaaaarg!\u201dI grabbed that man\u2019s crotch with all my strength. It slapped me right in the face, so I just grabbed it like a crown of victory.Well.It was average for a high schooler.\u201cSay \u201cSpare me\u201d. Go for it.\u201d\u201cArggghhgghgh! Hey. Hey. Let go. Let go, while I\u2019m still being niiiiaargh! Please!\u201d\u201dThat guy was now being tested on the limits of his vocal cords and his balls.The other seniors who witnessed that astonishing scene now approached to stop me.\u201cI won\u2019t stop!\u201d\u201cAh, no! You, you crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer, you bastards!\u201d\u201cYaaaarggghghghg! Urrrgggggghhhhaaaah!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s twisting. Huh? Ain\u2019t it twisting nicely? Huh? If you come any closer, I\u2019ll twist it all the way around! Oh, looks like he\u2019ll have to live as a seedless watermelon for all his life then. Ah. Dunno how long it will take, but if you come any closer, then this guy can say his descendants goodbye! Huh!\u201dHearing my threats everyone was unable to rush to his aid, as I put even more strength into my grasp.\u201cLe! Le! Let goooOOoOOOOoooh!\u201d\u201cSay, please spare me.\u201dThe male students all cringed unconsciously at that scene of horror.\u201cS, sp, Spare! Spare me!\u201d\u201cYou have to add the please. Mind your language! Please! Do it!\u201d\u2013 Clennnch!\u201cPlease spaaaaaheaaaare meeeiiiiik! Eerk!\u201dBoy, you\u2019re starting to sound like a girl.\u201cLetting go now? Not a chance.\u201d-Clennnch!\u201cUwaaaarrrrrrrrkkkkkkk! Krrrrk! Aeeeek!\u201dHe just let out some really weird voice.I was getting goosebumps now too.\u201cTake your friends and get out.\u201dI muttered grimly.\u201cYou can come beat me up whenever, but if you do it, I\u2019ll really break your stuff here until it can\u2019t be fixed, so be prepared. Oh, and next time I\u2019ll really twist it all the way around.\u201dI let go of him and then looked down at the man now collapsed on the ground.\u2013 Kick!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201cTake this thing away, you bastards.\u201dAs the finishing touch, I peppered a kick into his face.* * *Two of the seniors rushed to take him and then disappeared, perhaps because getting that bubble blowing bastard treated was more urgent.\u201cYou crazy psycho pervert!\u201d\u201cKeep the praise coming.\u201dThat little girl named Redina followed behind that kid who got taken away while crying. She seemed incredibly shocked. However, there was still one senior left in the gym. Although she looked like she had just seen something absurd and terrible, she was a relatively calm-looking woman.\u201cAren\u2019t you going?\u201d\u201cJunior, don\u2019t make the situation worse.\u201d\u201cThen do you want to beat me up? Will you twist my thing off?\u201d\u201cJunior, I just want to have a good conversation. Since there is no one else here, why don\u2019t you show me the least bit of respect?\u201dI felt a certain sense of crisis from that invitation in this kind of situation.I don\u2019t know what it was about her, but she seemed strange. She looked like an adult, and I guess she just told me to stop this.I\u2019d talk nice to the people who talked nice to me, and the others seemed to have given up on thinking about this development.\u201cYes, well. Sure. So what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Adriana, a sophomore at Royal Class, A-2. You said you were Reinhardt, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dShe gave me her name. Did she really only want to have a good conversation with me?\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this either. It\u2019s been done for generations, so the upperclassmen put pressure on us, too. To do it quickly.\u201dIt was the classic hereditary system. How absurd.They forced them to do it, even if they didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201cRedina is a weak-hearted girl. She wouldn\u2019t be able to harm anyone, she would rather hurt herself than having to talk harshly to you guys. Her seniors nominated her and forced her to do it.\u201d\u201cYou could just not do it. Why do it, if you\u2019ll only get hurt in the process?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s been done like this for so long. I know it sounds weird. But if one would want to just stop a tradition that had been going on for such a long time for no good reason, things would become troublesome.\u201dAdriana certainly didn\u2019t seem like she enjoyed doing this. However, with pressure coming from the higher grades, it was eventually decided for the small Redina to do it and she wasn\u2019t even that type of person.\u201cIf we say that we didn\u2019t do it, maybe the third graders will come. At that time\u2026. Will you be able to manage?\u201dShe asked me if I would kick out the third graders by doing some unspeakable, shameful thing again like just now.\u201cThe higher the grade, the harder it is for them to hold back. You. You might actually get hurt.\u201dYeah, the more time one spent at Temple, the stronger one would get. I was beaten like a dog by a second grader, but I took advantage of his carelessness and got hold of his weak spot. There wouldn\u2019t be such a chance if the older students started coming.\u201cDo the teachers just watch this stuff?\u201d\u201cThey acquiesce to it\u201dIt would actually be quite comfortable for the teachers, if the troublesome guys got straightened out like this. They could use the seniors to rail in the ones that danced out of line and rehabilitate them.\u201cLet\u2019s just do things in moderation, Junior. If things get blown even bigger, we\u2019d get scolded by our seniors, but you would be in even greater trouble.\u201dIn conclusion, \u201cCan\u2019t you just bow down like it usually goes?\u201d. She certainly seemed like a communicative person as she was even trying to gently advice me. Still, she didn\u2019t seem to want to take on the hassle to break this circle of absurdity.Don\u2019t make a fuss and be nice.Can\u2019t you just endure it for a bit and pretend that you\u2019ve been convinced?That\u2019s what she had been suggesting and requesting.Well, that was possible. I could see that she really was a communicative person.\u201cTell the third years to come. Weren\u2019t they the ones who made you seniors do this? If those bastards want it to be done, they should do it themselves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.What?\u201dAdriana expressed her astonishment as she didn\u2019t expect me to go down that route.Second years, third years!Just come at me!\u201cInstead, they shouldn\u2019t come today or tomorrow.\u201dI chuckled.\u201cTell them to come on Monday. Monday night, to be exact.\u201dI knew why they chose the weekend. Adriana bit her lips as she immediately understood what I was saying.\u201cLet\u2019s see whether those third years can tell Imperial Prince Bertus de Gardias to bend down. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have all of us present? I really can\u2019t quite understand why you have to do it at this time. We should do it together. I promise that I\u2019ll accept this stuff when they come over on Monday.\u201dI could see why they would do this on the weekend.They must have confirmed that the Prince returned to the Imperial Court over the weekend.No matter how much he was part of the Royal Class, they didn\u2019t want to touch the Prince. They could do these things to other nobles or royals, but I didn\u2019t think they would dare to actually touch the Prince.\u201cIf those third years won\u2019t come on Monday, I believe something like this would never happen again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was astonished that I dared to mention the Prince. Adriana just sighed briefly with her eyes closed.\u201cYou\u2019re really one great kid.\u201dThe senior with the calm demeanor left the gym with these words.She didn\u2019t think I was crazy enough to mention the Prince.I turned around and talked to Harriet de Saint-Owan.\u201cI took responsibility, alright, you idiot.\u201d\u201c.\u2026\u2026Hey, don\u2019t call me an idiot! I, I\u2019m smarter than you!\u201d\u201cYeah, a high quality idiot.\u201d\u201cThi, this! This!\u201dShe shouted with her face red, but she seemed relieved that this situation had been resolved somehow.The looks they gave me seemed a bit different from before as they slowly dispersed one by one.They felt like they just found a bizarre use for this psycho, a beast that should be avoided.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40At first, I obviously didn\u2019t want to stand out much, but that had become a thing of the past. I\u2019ve already caused too many incidents, to just get rid of this attention.Yeah, well, it would work out somehow. It was true that the looks my classmates gave me changed after I fought with the seniors. Of course, it wasn\u2019t even close to goodwill.I mean, the fact that I was still a wild animal in their eyes didn\u2019t change. I just told those guys that they should come back when the Prince is around after all.I somehow got into the position of a madman who was a bit better than they expected, I guess?\u201c\u2026You sold my name?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI told Bertus, who returned to the dormitory on Sunday, the truth. I thought it would be better if I told him with my own mouth rather than him, finding out in a different way later. I talked to Bertus on the terrace from last time. There were few people around so it was easy to have a good talk.Bertus seemed speechless when he heard that I sold his name and forced our seniors to step down.\u201cI knew there was such a tradition in the Royal Class, but when I was wondering why they didn\u2019t come, they just looked at me\u2026\u201dBertus didn\u2019t have to pretend to be friendly or talk nicely in front of me.Bertus knew that there were such traditions, but he seemed to have been more curious as to why they hadn\u2019t come.\u201cSo, what if the seniors come on Monday? Knowing what you told me just now, wouldn\u2019t it be you who made me lie down rather than the seniors?\u201dBertus smiled insidiously, asking me with his eyes if I wanted to die.\u201cThere\u2019s a very high probability that they won\u2019t come, but even if they do, it would be quite the funny sight.\u201d\u201cFunny?\u201d\u201cI mean, whether you do it or not, wouldn\u2019t they become quite restless?\u201dIt would be funny if he did end up doing it, but even funnier if he didn\u2019t. They\u2019d think things like: \u201cDo we beat up the Prince now?\u201d. And even if he did lay down on his stomach, the guy who ordered would probably die from a heart attack. No matter how simple the system of Temple was, with the only type of status being senior and junior, the Imperial Prince and Princess were the second most noble aristocrats of this world as the Imperial authority was piercing the skies now.Reality was very different from rules.The son of a great noble could be worked with, but the Imperial Prince was just too high up in class.Bertus was smiling at the bastard who dared to sell his name.\u201cFine, but still, selling the name of the Imperial Prince is a serious crime. You didn\u2019t refer to your classmate Bertus, but to Prince Bertus de Gardias. You obviously didn\u2019t refer to me as a friend, now did you?\u201d\u201cI suppose that is what I did?\u201dHe was right though, as I didn\u2019t refer to him as my friend Bertus, but as the Prince. Was this guy mad?Should I use the ring to run away?\u201cUsually, it would make sense to kill your whole family for that sin. But I don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019ve used me once, so wouldn\u2019t it be fair if I got to use you once as well?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dWould there even be anything I could do for him? In any case, Bertus did offer me a rather fair deal. Speaking the Prince\u2019s name was certainly possible within the walls of Temple, but it would be a rather shocking thing to do on the outside.\u201cI know you take some classes with my half-sister.\u201dHe probably meant Charlotte.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much I\u2019m asking of you. Just let me know if you notice anything unusual.\u201dI should keep an eye on Charlotte and report to him if I see anything unusual. He didn\u2019t want me to be friends with him or do anything behind the scenes.But in the end, wasn\u2019t I gradually becoming Bertus\u2019 pawn?It felt rather annoying.\u201cSure thing.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThere was nothing special about it. We didn\u2019t talk much in the first place. In my current state I didn\u2019t have any leverage at all.He didn\u2019t seem to care much about me. Did he even know who I really was?\u201cAnd, uhm, get along with the other kids.\u201dBertus sighed, pretending to be angry.\u201cBy my standard, I\u2019m trying to get along quite well here though? What. Didn\u2019t I save the kids from being harassed today, in a way?\u201dAt my absurd remark, Bertus burst out laughing.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s considered nice to call Princess Saint-Owan an idiot though?\u201dDid she whine to you about that?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It wasn\u2019t really a secret that Bertus and I were speaking to each other. As a result, the way my classmates looked at me became quite strange.I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever get along, but we did talk to each other for a bit, and from a distance, it would seem that we were quite friendly with each other.I revealed myself to be a beggar, but Bertus didn\u2019t seem to be particularly mad with me, who actually dared to sell his name.My classmates didn\u2019t seem to quite understand this.\u201cBe, Bertus!\u201dErich seemed to have contemplated for a while and then ran to Bertus from across the terrace.\u201cYes, do you have something to say to me?\u201d\u201cB, be careful of that guy\u2026.\u201d\u201cAah, Reinhardt? Don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s just a bit clumsy.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026.\u201dWell, no matter how one looked at it, even I would think that I wasn\u2019t like that just because I was a little clumsy.It looked like he had that nonsensical thought that I might end up harming the Prince because I was just some lowly bastard. I couldn\u2019t hear them that well as they were getting further away from me.Come to think of it, I was definitely more useful than Erich.At the moment, at least.That image that the Prince seemed to be closer to me than the other kids was spreading around, mystifying the other kids.About my job?I also didn\u2019t know what I was going to do about it.Bertus definitely was the type of person that would treat me well if I had proven myself to be useful.Even if I decided to leave after I made my profit later, it would be better to cooperate with Bertus for now. Unless he asked me to do something bad to Charlotte.As I was leaving the lobby and heading towards the dormitory, I saw Harriet sitting at a table, drinking tea and reading a book.When she made eye contact with me she frowned.\u201cHmpf!\u201dShe turned her head sharply with a \u201cHmpf!\u201d as soon as she saw me. What\u2019s with that? She did it so obviously. Wasn\u2019t this rather cute?What the hell was she supposed to be? A noble high school girl?Hmpf! She said. When was that fashionable again?\u201cIdiot.\u201d\u201cWha, what?!\u201dHer face turned red again, while I just shrugged.\u201cI was just saying a random word. What? Is your name Idiot?\u201d\u201cU,uh\u2026. Uuung\u2026.\u201dWhat\u2019s this? Had she already gotten used to getting called \u201cIdiot\u201d? Would she turn her head now every time someone said \u201cIdiot\u201d?\u201cYou said, you were smart, right? This isn\u2019t good, you know?\u201d\u201cThis!\u201dShe sprang up and strode towards me.\u201cYou just keep provoking me, so that I\u2019ll bring up my identity and when I do you\u2019d just run to the teacher to tell on me so that I get punished! Huh!\u201dIt seemed like she had a pretty vivid imagination. She seemed to think that I would go around provoking people so that they\u2019d say something like: \u201cHow dare you, I\u2019m the son of XXX\u201d, ultimately violating the school rules.Well, she might think that I\u2019d do that, because I was supposed to be a nut job.\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really thought of doing that\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen why are you doing this to me?! I\u2019m not an idiot! I\u2019m not right? So why are you doing this, you bastard?!\u201d\u201cNo, well. The payout is just too great. All kinds of reactions come out with every single word I say. Wouldn\u2019t you do this as well?\u201d\u201cWhat? Pay\u2026. Pay, what?\u201dWith every single word I told her all kinds of dramatic reactions came out, so I really just did this because it was fun. I walked past her who was looking to say something with a flushed red head.\u201cCute.\u201d\u201cWha, what? What did you say\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re cute, you\u2019re a genius but also silly and childish.\u00a0 It\u2019s to my taste. I like that you\u2019re so childish. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026. What do you mean?\u201dShe seemed confused whether I complimented or insulted her.It was so much fun teasing a beautiful noble young lady.\u2018Huh, how am I supposed to react to this? Is this for real? This can\u2019t be happening\u2019The look on her face as she was trying to make sense of the situation, but just couldn\u2019t come to terms with it was really funny.I giggled to myself as I went back to the dorm.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Monday\u2019s common classes. There were a lot of things going on, on Monday.First.\u201cReinhardt.\u201dThe second-year senior whom I caused a lot of trouble for came to the classroom. He didn\u2019t come alone. He arrived with the other seniors he was with last time. Four people, with the exception of Adriana, the calm senior, appeared.That little brat from last time stared at me as if she was going to eat me. It was also true that the atmosphere in the classroom suddenly froze over with the appearance of the seniors.He suddenly threw something at me before I could say anything.-FlopIt fell on my desk, not my face or anywhere else.A glove.I knew what this was.\u201cYou have seriously defamed me, Art de Gartis, the heir to the Gartis family.\u201dHe didn\u2019t look as excited as he did before.\u201cTherefore, I challenge you to a duel to restore my damaged honor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026A duel?\u201d\u201cYes, a duel.\u201dWhat kind of horse shit was this?\u201cChoose a time and place. There, observers will overlook our duel.\u201dEveryone reacted with disbelief when he applied for a duel against his own junior.\u201cSo, let me get this straight. You\u2019re applying for a duel, because your junior, whom you tried to beat up, grabbed you down there making you scream, leading to you feeling embarrassed?\u201dAt those words, everyone who witnessed this scene tried to hold back their laughter. The seniors looked around and told everyone not to laugh, but I could see the corners of their mouths\u2019 trembling.It was funny, regardless on which side one stood.\u201cThat was foul! Bad! Pervert!\u201dLittle Redina only pointed at me and shouted.\u201cYou look like a mess.\u00a0 You have to use everything you can, you know? Should I\u2019ve just quietly gotten beat up? Is that it? If I can break your head, I\u2019ll break your head and if I can grab onto something, I sure as hell will grab it. Is that wrong? Should the weak only get beat up? Huh?\u201d\u201cHow longwinded. If you intend to refuse the duel and embrace that dishonor, then do it. That would mean that you\u2019re a just a man of such caliber. That\u2019s all. Admit that you would only be able to win a fight through dirty methods.\u201dArt de Gartis seemed unmoved by my words. I knew, because he beat me up the other day. If I fought that guy, I\u2019d definitely get crushed. No, not only crushed, I would probably get seriously injured.A duel.I did include some duel scenes. Duels within the Temple can take place on the premise that the students do not use real swords.One might get hurt badly.However, one won\u2019t die.\u201cYes, I accept.\u201dMaybe because they didn\u2019t expect me to accept it, not only the person who applied for the duel, but also the other seniors and my classmates seemed to be astonished.\u201cKeep in mind, I won\u2019t fall for the same dirty trick as last time.\u201dI required extreme psychological pressure.That was the reason why I accepted it even though I knew it would be too much for me.I didn\u2019t know if that duel would do it for me, but I had to try.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41It was only natural that the atmosphere in the classroom became strange after the seniors left.\u201cHey, you. Could I talk to you for a second?\u201d\u201cWhat is there to talk about?\u201dEven though everyone went back, the little senior, Redina, stayed behind and called out to me.She wasn\u2019t aggressive in the least when she asked to talk with me. She actually looked very scared even though she had been sending me death glares to up until now.She took me out and dragged me to the stair landing so that no one could hear us.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, crazy?\u201d\u201cArt is Second Aear Class A\u2019s Number 3. Don\u2019t you know what that means? Do you want to die?\u201dThey naturally thought I\u2019d just embrace the disgrace and refuse the duel. I only won by taking advantage of his weak spot last time, so that guy knew I wasn\u2019t good at fighting.\u201cHe won\u2019t kill me.\u201d\u201cYou said you don\u2019t have any skill or talent. So what makes you so confident? Are you an idiot?\u201dAdriana told me yesterday that this little brat was actually forced to do this and that she was a really weak-hearted girl.She actually looked pretty fidgety now. She was excited at the thought of throwing insults at me if I were to refuse the duel, but when I chose the other option, which was crazy, she was rather frightened.\u201cDuels aren\u2019t a joke. There were kids who got really badly injured in them. Go to Art quickly, apologize and beg him for forgiveness. Things are just getting too weird, you idiot! Art would have let you go if you sincerely apologized!\u201dShe also told me how embarrassed he was.Knowing that I wasn\u2019t good at fighting, he applied for a duel and tried to get an apology out of me if I didn\u2019t agree to it.After Adriana told me that she was a good kid yesterday, I was wondering what kind of person she actually was, but she really seemed like a nice girl.\u201cWhat is life?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cIf I get beaten to death, than that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen, I guess.\u201dRedina seemed totally dumbfounded by my nonchalant response.The duel was decided to take place two weeks later in the First Year Class A\u2019s dormitory.During that week, what kind of miraculous talent could I get that would help me win against a second year student of the Royal Class in a duel?I just hope that this was psychologically pressuring enough.I really hoped that I didn\u2019t have to prepare a situation similar to when I was escaping from the Demon King\u2019s Castle and almost died. I hoped with all my heart that this would be enough.It was true that I was scared because I was sure to get beaten up badly, but I couldn\u2019t keep doing this with my ability locked.[Event Quest: Duel with Art de Gartis][Description : Art asked for a duel for defaming him. The probability of you winning is very low.][Goal : Go through with the duel.][Completion Reward : 600 Points][Consolation Reward : 200 Points]An event quest appeared as if it was natural.And in this case, even losing would pay off.I would be rewarded just for having the duel. The probability of me winning this duel was so low, there probably was a way to avoid it. So even if I wouldn\u2019t be able to make my talent awaken through this psychologically pressuring situation, I would get rewarded.Why was it giving me pity prizes now?Even though I did this to myself, I still felt a bit depressed.* * *Duels were allowed within Temple, but a teacher must watch over them. Otherwise, they might actually kill someone in that duel.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was staring at me silently. Since Mr. Epinhauser had previously stated that he would be the observer if a duel were to ever occur, so I reported this matter to him.\u201cIf the duel has been agreed upon by both parties there is no problem. Write down the location, date and time.\u201dThe teacher didn\u2019t ask me if I was crazy. He was a good and interesting guy in that he worried rarely or wouldn\u2019t meddle unnecessarily.A-11 Reinhardt would duel with a sophomore.Naturally, that rumor was coursing through Class A and then spread to Class B. To be precise it was during the P.E. lesson which was joint.\u201cReinhardt? What the hell happened? A duel? With a second grader?\u201dLudwig asked me after the short break between running exercises and strength training.I guess he became worried because he heard about this all of a sudden.\u201cThis and that happened. I\u2019m too lazy to explain all that.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if we could end this all with an apology? Won\u2019t you get seriously hurt?\u201dLudwig was stubborn and insisted on what If I were to get hurt, and how it would be better if I just ended this all with an apology. Although the classes were divided into A and B, maybe because we were still in the same grade, the Class B kids were also looking at me worriedly.And the kids who seemed to have heard the details were shocked.But for some reason, Charlotte was just staring at me. Her gaze somehow felt different from the other children.I was definitely not mistaken about that.Shortly after PE, Charlotte called out to me from behind as I was exhaustedly walking towards the changing room.\u201cYou said you were Reinhardt, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah, so.\u201dCharlotte walked over to me slowly and put something into my hand.\u201cCheck it.\u201dAfter leaving those cold commanding words behind, Charlotte walked her way towards her classroom.[Stay in the classroom after class]There was only one sentence written on the slip of paper.What?I was told by Bertus to keep an eye on Charlotte, but it seemed like Charlotte also had some business with me.* * *The common classes ended with the P.E. class. Mr. Epinhauser gave a closing speech, and then the students all exited the classroom.After our life-threatening escape and coming to Temple, Charlotte and I had never spoken with each other.Did she notice who I was? If that was the case, I had to immediately leave Temple.No. If she actually did, how did she know? After all the students left, I was the only one left in the classroom.-KatchakThen, the door opened and Charlotte entered Class A\u2019s classroom. This personality and the personality she showed me in that critical situation were bound to be different. Her being completely aware that her life was in danger, and Charlotte crying while hugging the body of her presumed mother in that dark prison cell.This Charlotte de Gardias, who gave off a cold impression, was like a completely different person. Was this Charlotte\u2019s original personality?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dCharlotte approached me while looking at me, then she sat obliquely in front of the desk next to me.\u201cI usually don\u2019t want to converse with people like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dWhat was she doing all of a sudden?\u201cI heard you were all over the place? You like to stand out, you have a bad temper and even got asked to duel by a senior today\u2026.\u201dCharlotte had a very bad impression of me, probably because she heard the rumors about me. There certainly wasn\u2019t anything good about my actions, so it couldn\u2019t be helped if Charlotte viewed me in a negative light.Still, I felt a bit heart broken.\u201cIs it because you are from a humble background that you treat people more strongly, so you won\u2019t be ignored?\u201dCharlotte\u2019s blunt words somewhat hit the nail on the head. I didn\u2019t want to seem like a pushover so I acted like a dog. As she continued to talk, it didn\u2019t seem that she noticed who I was.So what is that she wanted?\u201cI heard you\u2019re a beggar. I did some research.\u201dResearch?If I\u2019m a beggar, then I\u2019m just a beggar. Why did she do research? It must have been on Saturday that this rumor reached her ears, but she had been researching me?\u201cI know who you are.\u201dShe did?\u201cWhere you\u2019re from, what kind of members your gang has, and what kind of organization stands behind them.\u201dI had goosebumps all over my body.Charlotte didn\u2019t seem like she knew I was a demon, but she found out about something else.She knew about the Rotary Gang and that it was supported by the Thieves\u2019 Guild.\u201cKeep in mind that it is uncommon for me to deal with pests like you.\u201dShe was saying that she didn\u2019t only dislike me because of the kind of person I was.She didn\u2019t like me because she thought I was associated with a criminal organisation.Although Bertus\u2019 power was enormous, it seemed clear that Charlotte, who returned to the Emperor\u2019s side, could also wield formidable forces. How else could she find out all these facts in that short amount of time?She found out about the Rotary Gang just by finding out where I came from. and even gathered clues about the Thieves\u2019 Guild who supported them.They were tightly entangled after all.\u201cWa, wait\u2026. I\u2026. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026. I don\u2019t know\u2026. What is this about?\u201d\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m naive enough to believe that excuse that they sent you here simply to get educated at Temple?\u201dCharlotte leaned against the desk in exasperation, then came up to me and looked down at me with sad eyes.She started looking at me deeply.\u201cStop acting like that. If you keep pretending you don\u2019t know, I\u2019m going to mobilize the city guards right this instant to clean up those dirty sewers.\u201dThere was no point in denying my link to them.Like Bertus, Charlotte wasn\u2019t someone I could control. This was even more serious than that time with Bertus though. Bertus didn\u2019t seem to have made a background check on me, but Charlotte could even connect me and Loyar at this moment.Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have dealt with someone like me.But right now it wasn\u2019t a normal situation.In the end, Charlotte said that she had some business with me. Denial would only put the Rotary Gang at risk.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dAdmitting it in the end, I waited for her answer. Charlotte took something out of her arms.A portrait was on the paper Charlotte gave me.\u201cThis kid.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOf course, I knew who that was.It was me, who tried to use camouflage magic to hide my horns.\u201cFind this kid. If he\u2019s alive, tell me where he is. If he died, tell me where and why he died. And also who killed him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou must find him.\u201dShe stared at me coldly as if she would destroy everything before her if I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201cWait, what should I do if I can\u2019t\u2026. Are you asking me to find a kid whose name even you don\u2019t know? Rather, isn\u2019t your side more\u2026\u2026.\u201dCharlotte frowned when I said something like \u201cWhat can I even do? I just belong to a Beggars\u2019 Organization.\u201d and \u201cThere must be a lot of other people available\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that. It\u2019s important that you have to find his whereabouts faster than Bertus.\u201dI killed the Knights of Duke Salerian. I didn\u2019t know what happened to Dyrus, but it was clear that both me and Dyrus were targeted by Duke Salerian..Just as Charlotte was looking for me, Bertus was as well.Charlotte seemed to be looking for me with all the manpower she could mobilize. That was why she was trying to even mobilize this kind of organisation, she usually wouldn\u2019t even spare a single look.\u201cI\u2026. Could end up handing him over to Bertus though?\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201dTo begin with, I was in Class A which meant a lot closer to Bertus. However, Charlotte\u2019s eyes then lit up in cold anger.\u201cHowever, if that were to happen, I will surely kill you with my own hands as well as that organization of yours.\u201dDamn it.I never thought Charlotte would be looking for me so desperately, because the man she wanted me to find was right in front of her. I just wanted her to forget about me, but it seemed like she couldn\u2019t.She thought that I\u2019d get killed if Bertus found me first.\u201cHey, that kid\u2026. Why is he so important?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know. You have someone to find, so that\u2019s all you have to do.\u201dCharlotte didn\u2019t seem to want to provide an explanation for me. She just pressed the portrait against my chest.\u201cReport to me regularly about the status of the investigation. It\u2019s not like your grades in Temple are your top priority. Right?\u201dMy life and the lives of the gang members relied on this.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42A boy who saved her but then suddenly disappeared.Charlotte seemed to think that he became a beggar. That was why she asked me who also was a beggar to find the boy, because a beggar would know a beggar best.A student from a beggar organization that entered Temple. To Charlotte, I seemed to be the best option to look for that boy for her.But while Charlotte seemed rational, she wasn\u2019t. The emotions that flashed in her eyes when she told me to find him showed that Charlotte wasn\u2019t calm at all.She looked like she was about to lose her reason. Charlotte, who threatened me and insisted on me finding myself somehow, seemed unable to control her emotions.Charlotte carried out a meticulous background check on me in mere days, however she seemed unable to think rationally.I thought she\u2019d obviously think I was suspicious while listening to Dyrus recount, but she didn\u2019t seem like that at all right at that moment. She only felt desperate to find someone who was very dear to her.In some cases, there were people who never doubted anyone.Charlotte didn\u2019t seem to think that I was suspicious at all. Maybe she thought that I simply ran away or was kidnapped and killed.That was what I believed went through her mind.If she had even the slightest inkling that I was a demon in disguise, Charlotte should have doubted me.If she checked my origin as a beggar, the date my ID was issued, and interrogated the beggars personally, Charlotte would have noticed that I just appeared out of nowhere one day.However, Charlotte was so obsessed with finding Valier, that she just wanted to use me as a tool to find him for her, but didn\u2019t go around asking about me herself.I felt a little good, but on the other hand I didn\u2019t. I was now in a position where I had to deceive this kid who was looking for me so desperately.I had been given this bizarre order of finding and bringing myself to Charlotte. Appearing in front of her with the appearance of Valier would solve everything, but she wouldn\u2019t let me go. She\u2019d somehow try to keep me by her side.What should I do?One of my assistants, Sarkegaar, was the one who kidnapped the Imperial Princess. It would be absurd to reveal my true identity to her and standing in front of her in the form of Valier would be very dangerous.This was never a matter I could simply decide on my own.I had to discuss this matter with Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar.Anyway, I was now completely trapped between Bertus and Charlotte.Depending on my actions, it would be decided if the decision to come to Temple was the worst possible one we could have made.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The one closest to my body was Bertus, and the one closest to my heart was Charlotte.To be honest, I felt very sorry. I wasn\u2019t in a situation where I could just show up in front of her who was so desperately looking for me, and I actually had to help Charlotte\u2019s sworn enemy.And the gang was now on the Princess\u2019 radar. I didn\u2019t know about Bertus, but the princess would absolutely wipe out the Rotary Gang if I were to pull some crap. She\u2019d probably bring up my connection to the Thieves\u2019 Guild to the teachers and might even get me kicked out of Temple.It was useless feigning ignorance as well. Charlotte had everything figured out already.She didn\u2019t know the most important details, but she did know all the facts that would be bothersome to me.I couldn\u2019t tell Bertus what Charlotte instructed me to do. Just telling him would leave me with a servered head. If he asked me later, what I talked about with Charlotte, what should I tell him?Both Bertus and Charlotte were looking for me. Bertus for retaliation and Charlotte for protection.Things had become twisted.Anyway, what happened to Dyrus? I couldn\u2019t even ask Charlotte, but I was curious. If Duke Salerian retaliated against him, he wouldn\u2019t be in this world anymore. I could only hope that Charlotte was protecting him well.Who was I worried about now?Both heirs to the Imperial Throne wanted me to do something for them. It would have been better if I only had something to do with one side, but I was vaguely intertwined with both of them. What a dog like situation.That\u2019s what it was.Charlotte\u2019s matter needed to be discussed separately. And it wasn\u2019t just that.I also had to prepare for the duel with Art later this week. It was clear that he would beat me into a bloody pulp when that time came, but after that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it so easily anymore.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I went back to the dorm, when someone called out to me.\u201cHey, you beggar.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was Harriet de Saint-Owan. When I reacted she covered her mouth and laughed.\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t call you though? I just said a word. Are you a beggar?\u201dWas she trying to get back at me using the same method I used on her?\u201cHuh, I am, right?\u201d\u201cHu, huh?\u201dWhen I said yes, that girl\u2019s expression turned into a puzzled one as if this wasn\u2019t the reaction she was looking for. I never set her up as that kind of character, so why was she so cute?She was like a little kid that thought she was smart. She was so damn cute, I couldn\u2019t even get mad at her.\u201cI\u2019m a beggar, you\u2019re right. So what is it?\u201d\u201cHuh, uhm\u2026. Ah\u2026.\u201dWhat she expected me to say was: \u201cDon\u2019t call me a beggar!\u201d, however what she got was a: \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d. So, when I asked her what she wanted she seemed flustered, as she probably didn\u2019t have anything to say to me.\u201cI heard. That. I heard, you\u2019re going to have a duel?\u201dWhy was she pretending to have heard it from somewhere when she was right there when it happened? No matter how one looked at it, this was just a question she came up with on the spot.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThat senior is a very scary person. You\u2019re going to be beaten up pretty badly, you know?\u201d\u201cWhere you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I wonder if he\u2019ll kill me.\u201dShe seemed taken aback by my nonchalant response.\u201c\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t you scared?\u201d\u201cAm I scared? To the point where I\u2019m about to pee myself.\u201dShe seemed even more confused when I casually told her that I was, in fact, scared. She knew I was a troublemaker, but it seemed like my evaluation was being revised as a completely incomprehensible person.\u201cThen why did you accept the challenge if you\u2019re scared?\u201d\u201cI know, right? Maybe I\u2019ll just happen to turn it around somehow.\u201dI didn\u2019t say anything like: \u201cI\u2019m trying to awaken my supernatural abilities by putting myself into extremely psychologically pressuring situations\u201d.Harriet stared at me as if I was crazy. Eventually, she shook her head.She even had a wicked smile on her lips.\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have to watch if you really get beat up.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmpf!\u201dI headed to the gymAnd it seemed like our conversation was surprisingly calm just now.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *My physical abilities weren\u2019t that far behind my classmates, they weren\u2019t comparable to those with combat talents, obviously.Of course, people like Erich Lafaeri who had a combat talent but didn\u2019t put in any effort was out of that equation.The Class A dormitory\u2019s gym, there were two students holding training swords and beating scarecrows alone or practicing their posture.A-2, Ellen Artorius and A-5 Cliffman, only those two. Those two practiced every day according to their own routine. They didn\u2019t go out to play on the weekends and just practiced all day long.However, the two of them were training separately while still being in the same space and there was a 100% chance that they haven\u2019t even held a single conversation with each other up until now.For now I just picked up a training sword.But how was I supposed to practice swordsmanship? They were just swinging around their sword by themselves.I usually described it as \u201cThey did swordsmanship training\u201d in my novel without going into detail. Leveling up was roughly the same, I\u2019d just say they ranked up or leveled up. Or it would just be as blunt as saying, they\u2019ve gotten better at this or that.I asked neither of them to teach me, so they didn\u2019t. I just started swinging my sword.Of course, it wasn\u2019t all random. I tried recalling the swordsmanship moves I learned last week and traced it while replaying that memory in my mind. I trained techniques and swordsmanship moves while looking at the provided manual. There was just too much work to be done to condense it in just a single word.I realized that the strength of my wrist and forearm muscles had to be supported, the foot work was important as well.I couldn\u2019t believe those two were doing this on their own every day.The two silently wielding their sword started to look incredible to me again.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cHuff\u2026. Huff\u2026.\u201dAfter dinner, Ellen continued to wield her sword, and even after Cliffman returned to the dormitory, she continued to train alone.Of course, she didn\u2019t just swing her sword, she seemed to be doing other things like going somewhere and coming back after. Eventually, after some time passed, I was the only one left training and wielding the sword.Would this even make a difference?I only did this for one day, but I already felt exhausted and tired. I had to get used to training in itself, not just because of the duel next week. I can\u2019t believe in my mad dog act forever.That\u2019s what I realized.The third graders didn\u2019t come even after it grew dark. In the end, as I expected, they didn\u2019t want to touch the Prince directly. And those guys forced the second graders to do such a thing for them.The third graders didn\u2019t come. However, an unexpected person entered the gym.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cJunior. I heard you were here.\u201dIt was Adriana, the second year senior with a calm demeanor.She furrowed her brows as she looked at me sprawled out with the training sword beside me, sweating profusely.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Redina requested me to come.\u201d\u201cThat kid?\u201dWhat did she ask her that for?\u201cYes, Art seems to be looking forward to this a lot, so he might beat you half to death. She tried to stop him.\u201dShe was such a good girl, to the point that I felt really sorry for being so harsh to her. Adriana sighed when she saw how exhausted I was.\u201cBut looking at you now, it seems that you\u2019re trying to do something at least.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. More or less.\u201d\u201cJust because you do this for around 2 weeks doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be able to beat Art. You know that much, right?\u201dAdriana didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was doing.\u2018Why the hell are you accepting a duel that you\u2019re obviously going to lose and wield your sword in the training hall until the point of nearly killing yourself? There\u2019s no chance of winning.\u2019That\u2019s what she was trying to tell me.\u201cI have to do something.\u201d\u201cYou will lose. Miserably at that.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just apologize now, before you have to suffer through greater humiliation. You certainly realize that you\u2019re going a bit too far. Art isn\u2019t as bad a kid as you think.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad guy.\u201dI could fully understand why he threw the glove after being subjected to something like that. He was humiliated by his junior. Adriana slightly bit her lip.\u201cYou know you will lose and you also don\u2019t think that Art is a bad person, so why do you want to go on with this duel and not apologize?\u201d\u201cJust because.\u201dI got up again with my training sword and started practicing my posture.\u201cI, have to get hit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dIt\u2019s not that I want to get hit, just to get hit.-Whoosh! Swish!I had to get hit to overcome this difficult situation. Adriana stared at me for a long time, then sighed.\u201cJunior.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAdriana slowly approached me as if she wanted to stop me and took the sword from my hand.Then she lightly performed the moves I had been trying to do up until now. Looking in the mirror, it was not comparable to the clumsy moves I displayed. They were nearly perfect moves, like a sword dance.\u201c\u2026Why are you showing me things I can\u2019t even imitate\u2026.\u201dAdriana sighed as if she herself couldn\u2019t understand what she was doing and returned the training sword to me.\u201cTry.\u201dI then tried to demonstrate the exact same movements Adriana just showed me using the scarecrow.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWe both looked at each other silently. She approached me, grabbed my arm and shook it around. It was definitely limp because I felt rather exhausted at the moment.\u201cIt won\u2019t do you any good if you try to do this while you\u2019re all out of energy. You\u2019ll just hurt your wrist.\u201dAdriana looked at me with pity, and then suddenly closed her eyes. A bunch of white lights appeared from her hands and began to tickle my body.\u201cThi, this is\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, you don\u2019t know.\u201dThen Adriana opened her eyes again.\u201cI want to be a Paladin.\u201dShe seemed to have talents in both divine power and swordsmanship. Second year, A-2, Adriana. If she was Class A\u2019s number 2, I was assuming that she had even more talents.She certainly was incredible, as she was able to use divine spells at her age.She restored my vitality with a divine spell just now. All my muscle aches and fatigue certainly had been completely relieved.\u201cNow, try again.\u201d\u201cYes, thanks.\u201dMy strength should have been restored. While carrying gratitude in my heart, I tried to trace Adriana\u2019s movements again.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNothing had changed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Your basic fitness level is too low. Junior, you should do physical training, not holding a sword.\u2019Adriana let out a deep sigh when she said that.\u2018Why do I even care about this kid?\u2019\u2018Wake up 2 hours earlier than the standard wake-up time and wait in the main lobby.\u201dWhether she was concerned or just plain annoyed, Adriana didn\u2019t seem like she could leave me alone.Anyway, I did feel grateful for her help.I wondered why she was helping a rowdy junior who was about to duel with her classmate.The next day.I was in the lobby at 6 o\u2019clock, well before the standard wake-up time, wearing a track suit. As it was 6 o\u2019clock it was still dark out, but there were still some people here.This was because the students who wanted to train their physical strength in the morning gradually came out.Ludwig and Ellen were also there.\u201cReinhardt? What\u2019s going on? So you want to exercise?\u201d\u201cYeah, well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good! So you want to do it together then?\u201dIt was good that he was so energetic, but I didn\u2019t think I could keep up with him.\u201cNo, I think my heart would burst if I were to try to follow you.\u201d\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m pretty sure it is. Go alone.\u201dRunning beside him would mean committing suicide. Even Ellen couldn\u2019t keep up with that. That\u2019s what it meant to have A+ Rank stamina.\u201cEllen! Do you want to run with me today?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dEllen answered curtly and went out of the dormitory lobby. Ludwig looked at Ellen who gave him the cold shoulder like always and smiled at me.\u201cDoes Ellen hate me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dShe just doesn\u2019t care about any of us.After sending him off for his morning workout, Adriana, with her shoulder-length bob tied in a ponytail, came down from the second floor, after a while.This senior of mine was very calm and had a modern style beauty to her. She looked like a modern high school girl.I bowed my head slightly and Adriana nodded her head towards me to answer my greeting. Adriana was probably the most polite person I had dealt with up until now.\u201cWouldn\u2019t this make you look bad in front of your classmates?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHelping me with physical training.\u201d\u201cWell, you need to be a little more physically fit if you want to have a duel\u2026 Ung.\u201dShe started warming up by stretching.\u201cThat way, rumors about Art bullying a weak freshmen kid because of his own stubbornness won\u2019t circulate.\u201dSo, to protect Art\u2019s honor was enough justification to help me out. That was what she meant. Anyway, I was pretty sure I would lose, but I was grateful anyway.She seemed to be good at swordsmanship and aimed to become a paladin, and seeing her waking up at this time, she really was sincere and calm.What the hell. Was she the perfect human being? Was she really a high schooler? It made me feel even shabbier for swearing at younger kids.\u201cLet\u2019s go, junior.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAdriana ran ahead and I followed behind her.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cThis is serious.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026. Huff\u2026.\u201dI ran to the point that I had a sweet taste in my mouth, but Adriana wasn\u2019t tired at all.She restored my strength by injecting divine power into me. My wildly beating heart gradually calmed down and my breathing stabilized.What\u2019s this?I felt like I was running while taking a doping potion. My mind was exhausted but my body felt fine. This was a really strange feeling.\u201cRun faster. I\u2019m also training myself, so it\u2019s hard for me to also look after you, junior.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201dMy body and mind were driven to the extreme, but due to Adriana\u2019s divine power, my body would always be restored to its original state. Rather, this almost drove me mad. My mind was worn out, but my body continued to be active.This was the first time in my life that I ever felt that way. I could continue to run, but my mind was in an even more extreme state.\u201cI, I feel really strange!\u201d\u201cI mean, technically this is against the rules, but it would actually be stranger to not feel strange you know?\u201dI shouted while running and Adriana answered me. Normally, I shouldn\u2019t be able to run anymore, but I kept running, so it was natural for me to feel strange.\u201cHuff\u2026. Huff\u2026. If Paladin candidates were to, huff, run a marathon\u2026 Huff\u2026 I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll all win\u2026 Huff\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf this method was actually allowed, then yes! And you\u2019ll run out of breath if you keep talking while running.\u201dAdriana ran easily, even finding the time to rebuke me. There were quite a few people in Temple who trained themselves in the morning.\u201cThe first year junior called Ludwig . He was the one sprinting around Temple, right?\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026. How he was originally\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, junior. He can do it, because he worked hard. Don\u2019t just work hard today, keep doing this in the future. The Orbis Class kids do this every morning as a group. Our Royal Class\u2019 lazy kids could learn a thing or two from them.\u201dAdriana was talking about one of Temple\u2019s two pillars, the Orbis Class. It seemed like they would get up early in the morning and train together as a group. Regardless of major.Were they part of the army?\u201cHey, you told me not to talk\u2026. Huff\u2026 Why do you keep talking to me\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes. Sorry.\u201dI ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran and ran. I almost lost my mind every time she healed me. It wasn\u2019t just running I had to do. Adriana headed to the gym and let me do strength training.At that moment, I could truly feel how demonic her divine power was. When my muscles started to ache, she would heal them with her divine power, then send me to do more training and when the pain grew worse again, she\u2019d heal me.However, if she went on like that my muscle growth would be no joke. What would one call these kinds of steroids? Divine steroids?\u201cI\u2019m doing this because you just lack too much strength. You should do some strength training on your own, but don\u2019t overdo it or you could ruin your body.\u201dAdriana told me that I should think about carefully growing my strength and kept on checking on me even though she had her own training to do.\u201cIf you exercise while forcibly recovering using divine powers, there\u2019s one thing you have to do no matter what.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEat a lot.\u201dI was more or less forced to maintain my physical abilities even after I completely exhausted my energy. That was why Adriana advised me to eat a lot more and more often than usual because I would suffer serious nutritional losses. Especial protein.\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m confident of doing today\u2026.\u201d\u201cHah, I suppose so.\u201dAdriana smirked as if I said something funny.I had never seen her smile before.* * *Even while completing her strength training she poured divine power into me and went back to it. She didn\u2019t use it on herself. Somehow, this seriously felt like I had a heal-pack stuck next to me, when she started her work out.If she were to travel to modern times, I was sure she would have great success as a personal trainer. People who would sell their souls for muscle growth would absolutely love her.Though my body was fine, my mind was completely exhausted when I returned to the dormitory. I took a shower, changed my clothes and headed straight to the dining room. It wasn\u2019t meal time yet, but I was so hungry that the world felt like it was spinning around me.No, I didn\u2019t think I really had that big of an appetite because the workout was just too intense, but I felt this strong compulsion to eat something, a feeling much stronger than just feeling hungry.When it was time, the chefs would bring the food they prepared into the hall, but that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a kitchen here. It didn\u2019t only include simple meals, but also late-night snacks that could be eaten at any time one wanted, as well as a kitchen equipped with all kinds of ingredients.One could call upon the chefs to prepare some food for you, and sometimes the students even cooked themselves.But how many of them would even be able to make their own meal? They had to try and maybe grill an egg.And there was this setup I didn\u2019t know about.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen, who had already finished with her physical training, was carrying a bunch of beef jerky.She went out every morning to exercise, so she wanted to have something to eat before having breakfast. That\u2019s understandable.But I remembered that she also ate a lot more at breakfast than others. What kind of metabolism did she have?When I looked into the storage that held the snacks, I saw that it was empty. When I turned around, I saw Ellen eating the beef jerky little by little.\u201cIs that all there is?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWas there only beef jerky in there?\u201d\u201cNo. Originally, there was bread and some other things.\u201dOriginally, they had prepared a lot of things, but it seemed like they didn\u2019t replenish it often as there weren\u2019t many people who ate those snacks. So it seemed like after eating this and that every morning, the only thing left was beef jerky.\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dEllen shook her head. It seemed like she ate it only because it was available, not because she liked it particularly.No, how hungry was she?I didn\u2019t want to steal her food, so I ended up going into the kitchen. Fortunately, there were quite a few ingredients in the storage, so I didn\u2019t have to eat raw meat as is.I had no intentions of making anything amazing. I was about to die from mental exhaustion after all.I just took some eggs and bacon and fried them in a frying pan. The fragrant smell of bacon spread throughout the kitchen. Then I just threw some asparagus in there to fry. Since I was told to eat a lot, I used a lot of bacon and five eggs.I also wanted to eat some carbs, but I didn\u2019t feel like cooking noodles or rice. That was just too much work.After I was done, I placed the mountain of eggs and bacon, accompanied by asparagus on a large plate and brought it to a table in the dining room.Ellen was still chewing on her beef jerky. However, she could apparently not help herself twitching her nose when she saw me coming.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t eat that shabby food. Eat this instead.\u201dI had a bad temper, but I wasn\u2019t a heartless person, you know?When I handed her the fork, Ellen accepted it and sat across from me. I sighed when I saw Ellen eat some of the fried eggs.\u201cHey, the storage is full of meat and eggs, why don\u2019t you fry some instead of eating that tasteless stuff? Is it that hard?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never done that.\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you done this before though? Isn\u2019t that essential?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen stared at me smirking suddenly. I didn\u2019t know why, but she looked somewhat sullen, like : \u201cWhy are you talking to me? Are we in the same situation?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to, you should learn it. Kids these days\u2026. Anyway, eat up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhat am I doing when one doesn\u2019t even touch a dog when it eats? I was going to eat too.-Nom, nom, nomNo, why was she eating so fast?\u201cHey, don\u2019t cross the line. Eat at a human pace. Huh?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like words would get through to her, so I picked up my fork as well. But that punk ate half of it already, even though it was me who made it.\u201cAre you kidding me? You eat more than a beggar who hasn\u2019t eaten for days.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m hungry.\u201dAfter she said that, Ellen curiously avoided my gaze.She ate more than half of what I made in a single bite? This had crossed the line, honestly.\u201cYou know that you have classes with me today, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dToday was Tuesday, I was taking the two consecutive swordsmanship lessons with Ellen. To my words, she nodded. She was quite insensitive, although she wasn\u2019t stupid.\u201cBe prepared for lunch then.\u201d\u201c?\u201dWe were going for 2 rounds of cheonggukjang.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44It was a bit much to expect dramatic changes after just one day.Nevertheless.Current stats: [ Strength 4 (F+) ]\u00a0 [ Agility 4 (F+) ]\u00a0 [ Dexterity 5.2 (D-) ]\u00a0 [Magic 10 (C) ] [ Stamina 6.5 (D) ]My Strength increased by 0.5, Agility by 0.3 and Stamina by 0.6. I didn\u2019t exactly know why but I also confirmed that Magic also increased by 0.1.Of course, as I explained before, the lower the level the quicker one could see developments. Obviously, this might also be the effect of going through Temple\u2019s curriculum in addition to that one day of training, but it was clear to see that the effects of that training while being influenced by divine power were enormous.However, Adriana seemed to think that this wasn\u2019t a very good method, so there had to be a reason why it wasn\u2019t.In addition, the fatigue this caused was actually just as enormous as its effects, as it felt like my body and mind acted separately.Honestly, I wasn\u2019t quite sure if I would continue with swordsmanship in the future, but right now I could only learn things that were related to the body.I tackled the swordsmanship theory and practical training with a different mindset from last week. There were no major improvements.Ellen was an honor student and I was more on the inferior side of things even though I was also part of the Royal Class. I didn\u2019t care about the general class\u2019 people\u2019s looks. If I cared about something like that, I wouldn\u2019t be doing this.In the first place, there were a lot of talents found in the Royal Class! I wasn\u2019t the weird one here! This had nothing to do with hard work! That\u2019s what I wanted to plead, but I couldn\u2019t do that, because they weren\u2019t looking at me anymore.Of course, there were some guys who seemed to gossip about me because even though Ellen and I were both in the Royal Class, we were completely different.However, there were just too many things I had to worry about to even graciously give them True Education. To be honest, I didn\u2019t even know those guys\u2019 names.I had to be strong-minded. There would always be people wanting to pick a fight with me, and those who would want to repay the humiliation they suffered after they realized that I was just a weakass or after their skills had improved.The duel in two weeks was only one incident. I had to continue my physical training. From swordsmanship to martial arts. I couldn\u2019t learn magic properly here to begin with, my supernatural power hadn\u2019t awakened yet, and I didn\u2019t have a talent for divine power yet, so I had to start from a completely bare ground.The only thing I could believe in at this point was my body that would grow as I trained.I couldn\u2019t end up as just a bad tempered guy. I had to have real power and I had to get out of Bertus\u2019 and Charlotte\u2019s hands eventually.I didn\u2019t have any time to waste.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not as strange as last time.\u201dRegardless of how it went last time, Ellen challenged the cheonggukjang again and ate it unexpectedly calmly.As this was her second time eating it, she got used to it, didn\u2019t she?\u201c\u2026That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s delicious.\u201dAs if she tried to avoid any misunderstandings, Ellen added that.But if she didn\u2019t like to eat this, why did she follow me here? Was it because I was buying?Did I set her up to like free meals?Still, she ate more than last time, and even burped.She was quite the legend after all.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you more of a beggar than me for always eating the food I buy?\u201dWhen I took a stab at her after we left the store, Ellen just looked at me. Rather than staring at me, it felt more like she was lost in thought.\u201cThen I\u2019ll pay next time.\u201dWhat\u2019s this?She just smoothly answered with a promise to eat together again next time.Did she maybe think I was actually a pretty good guy?Ellen, of course, left without saying goodbye this time.Such an ungrateful kid.* * *Since I didn\u2019t have a specific skill yet I didn\u2019t have much to learn in class.I dropped the magic classes with the permission of Mr. Epinhauser, and horseback riding was added in its stead. I thought that I might end up having to ride a horse one day.I was so scared, I almost peed myself. I was supposed to ride on some wild beast and entrust my life to it? Were they crazy? I should have made the setting that mana cars or something existed.I also realized once again that the horse riding skills of Dyrus, who let me ride with him when we escaped the Demon King\u2019s Castle, were top class.I had already exhausted all my mental strength in the morning training, but I couldn\u2019t take a break. After class, I reviewed what I had learned today until evening at the gym, as well as some physical training.When I was completely exhausted and couldn\u2019t move anymore, I kind of missed Adriana\u2019s divine power.I wondered if she would also come in the evening, but she didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Honestly though, my conscience wouldn\u2019t allow me, making her help me out more than she already did.However I didn\u2019t forget what Adriana told me, I had a big dinner, and after a short digestive break, I went for a run, followed by some strength training.I thought I was overdoing it, and this would have originally been enough to hurt my body. However, thinking that Adriana would somehow be able to handle this, I kept on pushing myself harder.\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201dThe sweat on my hands made the training sword slip out of my hand.Did I really have to do it like this? I was far from a person who enjoyed exercising after all. I didn\u2019t really have the willpower to do something like that, and I just kept on writing stories in the corner of my room. I neither liked nor had a talent for putting that kind of effort in things.I had that thought a dozen more times when I felt out of breath and my fingers trembled in exhaustion.I was bound to lose that duel anyway. This was something I should worry about in the future.So I should just take it easy.Even if I do my best, I wouldn\u2019t be able to beat a guy who was a year older than me with just two weeks of training.Whenever such complacent thoughts entered my mind, I forced myself to hold my sword tightly.I was sure that I would lose that duel in two weeks. However, I shouldn\u2019t be complacent just because I knew I would lose.I wasn\u2019t doing this shit to beat a senior one year older than me.\u201cHup!\u201d-Pok! Pok! Pok!Because of my carelessly scribbled developments, gates would soon open, leading many people to die. I might die as well.I did this so I wouldn\u2019t die later.I might work myself to death now and it\u2019s still far in the future, but I\u2019d regret it later if I didn\u2019t do something now.I felt regret enough over the development of this novel. I didn\u2019t deserve to be complacent or lazy.Right now I was just some nasty bastard.I might even look like dirty, cruel bastard to some.\u201cHup!\u201d-Pock!There weren\u2019t any manwha-like developments like that scarecrow getting smashed to pieces by my swings.\u201cHah!\u201d-Pock!However, I added countless scratches to it.* * *In some dating simulations, there would be sequences in which you could decide where you would like to spend your free time. If the setting was a school then there were places like the music room, the gym, the science room, the rooftop etc.In the case of such games, one would find a specific character in each location. Girls who liked to play instruments would be in the music room, ones who liked working out were in the gym and those who were really smart were in the science room.So.\u201c.\u2026Those are passable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI felt like I knew all the locations one could encounter Ellen Artorius.She was sitting alone in the dining room eating sausages.She would be in the lobby early in the morning, before she started her training. After that she would go to the dining room, then go to the gym after school was over.And she would be at the dining room again, late at night.I came here to supplement my diet in advance, because I would feel super-dead after training with Adriana tomorrow, but Ellen was already here. She probably came here to eat after training like this every day.I opened the cabinet meant for snacks and saw that it still wasn\u2019t refilled. What? Then what was she eating?\u201cAre you eating that as is?\u201dShe had a tray full of sausages, munching away on them. At my incredulous attitude, Ellen pointed to the sausages she was eating.\u201cYou can eat the sausages just like that.\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe because they were smoked. But why do you just eat cold sausages?\u201dShe ran out of snacks, so she rummaged through the food storage and found those sausages. They were already precooked, so she probably just ate them as is.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have just turned on the stove, put them in a frying pan and rolled them around in there for a bit, before eating them? Is that so difficult to do?\u201dUse some cookware, for pete\u2019s sake!I didn\u2019t put some kitchen disaster or ditz attribute on you! I mean, you were supposed to be smart!Why was this intelligent person acting like a bum?Ellen shook her head at my words.\u201cToo annoying.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how, do you?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t tried.\u201dYou were telling me that you were too lazy to find out how to use them. She had such an annoying attribute. This scene made me angry just by looking at it.\u201cGive them here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEllen looked at me quietly when I took the plate of sausages. What? Were you telling me to give them back to you? If you really were a gluttonous character, that\u2019s what you\u2019d do, huh? However, she didn\u2019t tell me to put the plate back down, she just looked at me.Either way, I took out some more sausages, put them in a frying pan and heated them enough to consume at least. Why was she eating raw food that was of even higher quality than regular sausages made with the finest ingredients?When I took the sausages from the stove, Ellen was still staring at me.I could see now why she stayed still.\u201cDid she think I would make things for her in the future as well?\u201dI felt like she knew for certain that I would fry the sausages. That was why she stayed silent.As I said, I may be an ill tempered person, but I wasn\u2019t completely cold-hearted.So even though I had that kind of temperament, I would still share this meal with this cold person.We started to eat the sausages with a fork.\u201cHow good is this, huh? The juice is practically bursting out of it, and here you were trying to eat it raw like a dog on the street.\u201dEllen continued to eat, ignoring my nagging. It didn\u2019t matter what I said, she wouldn\u2019t particularly care.\u2018I\u2019ll eat it anyway, woof.\u2019Was that it?I ate some sausages for a while, before I put down my fork.Ellen did the same.\u201cSalty.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEllen nodded at my words.Since we only had sausages, it tasted really salty with nothing added to it. Usually it would make sense to have rice as a side dish or maybe even a loaf of bread.I wanted to eat more as I only had water and sausages, but I was too tired to make more. Ellen didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to leave, I didn\u2019t either.There were still fifteen more sausages left.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI thought I was about to die because I felt so tired all over. It would be a waste to just throw these away. That said, we should make something with the leftovers, but seeing that she is only ever made me work, I felt kind of annoyed.\u201cHey. You do exactly what I tell you to do from now on.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI was done volunteering.She had to do something for her food now.* * *\u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re doing good.\u201dSeeing the onions finely chopped, I nodded my head. I didn\u2019t really know how different handling a sword was from handling a cooking knife, but Ellen was able to do exactly as I ordered.I guess it wasn\u2019t a matter of being able to handle swords well, but a matter of having high levels of dexterity.\u201cDo you really not know how to cook?\u201d\u201cNo, this is my first time.\u201dIt seemed like today was the first time that she touched a kitchen knife ever. But seeing the level of her skill, even as a chef she\u2019d do well. Of course, she was too talented in combat to actually become one.\u201cNext are the carrots, same thing.\u201d-KakakakakaWatching the carrots getting chopped up in an instant, I proceeded telling her the next step. It felt like I was controlling a virtual avatar.I could do that as well, but I couldn\u2019t at the moment.I was so exhausted that I was rather confident that I would cut my fingers if I were to take up the kitchen knife.I had no intention of doing anything too complicated. There were a lot of different cooking utensils and ingredients in the kitchen, but it was night time. It was just too annoying.They had rice, but I was too tired to actually cook it. Of course, I didn\u2019t want to make new bread out of the flour as well.So what I was going to do was stir fry vegetables along with rice in a pan with oil, then add water, put the sausages in, and boil it like porridge.\u00a0 It\u2019s visuals didn\u2019t really matter to me. So what if it was a sham version of a honey porridge, as long as it was edible. It could maybe be called a Risotto?It didn\u2019t really matter to me and Ellen , who successfully managed to finish my introductory class to cheonggukjang.To begin with, by my standards she seemed to have the taste buds of a wild dog as she was eating the sausages raw.She\u2019d eat anything as long as it was edible, or so it seemed.Ellen began to stir, adding in the vegetables and rice, including minced garlic, just as I ordered. She seemed to be the type of person who would do what they were asked to do in the right circumstances.She deserved to be called my best midnight snack cooking student.\u201cRemember it, and from now on, cook for yourself. You come here before me after all.\u201d\u201cAnnoying.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to do it, but it\u2019s not like she can keep on getting fed by others. It was interesting though that she did something she thought was annoying when someone ordered her to do it. Of course, it was probably because the sausages tasted just too salty on their own.I put in the sausages and water at the right timing, and soon they began to boil in the pan. I put in some herbs. The sausages were already salty enough, so I didn\u2019t season them separately.After the random sausage porridge was completed, we brought it back into the dining room.Ellen scooped some of it up with her ladle as if there was nothing more to care about.\u201c!\u201dThen she opened her eyes wide.Of course, it wasn\u2019t because it was particularly delicious.\u201cDid you think it wouldn\u2019t be hot, shoving it into your mouth right out of the pan like that?\u201d\u201c!!!!\u201dWhen I gave her a glass of water, she gulped it right down. She was obviously smart and she had a good physique.Was she the type that would get stupid because of her own hunger? Would she turn into an idiot faced with food?\u201cHow is it? Much better, right? Huh? Isn\u2019t it delicious?\u201dAs I looked at her who kept eating after it cooled down, she stared back at me.\u201cI made it.\u201d\u201cWhat? You just moved your arms, it was me who actually taught you how to make this.\u201d\u201cBut it was me who actually made it.\u201dWhat? Was she arguing with me right now? Was she picking a fight?I\u2019m 100% sure that she would overpower me in a 1-on-1. Should I continue this?Ellen scooped up a spoonful and blowed on it this time, then she said:\u201cWe made it together.\u201dSomehow I felt like some petty bastard, so I didn\u2019t say much after that.No, I wasn\u2019t just like a petty bastard, I actually way one.* * *When I returned to my room after having a midnight snack with Ellen, I found that someone was in my room. I thought it was an employee. Since the dormitory employees cleaned the rooms of the Royal Class students.But they would usually clean up the room in the morning when I had classes. It was a little unexpected for them to be here at night like this.I had nothing in my room that shouldn\u2019t be seen. I organized and remembered the student list and then destroyed it. The worker in maid clothes seemed roam around my room, but didn\u2019t seem to pay any close attention to me.However when I entered, the employee came over and closed the door on my behalf.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat?That was weird.The employee looked at me and spoke briefly.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Sarkegaar.\u201dI couldn\u2019t even imagine how they planned on delivering messages to me, but it seemed like they\u2019d actually just bring them to me personally!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Just like I was able to casually enter Temple, Sarkegaar would be able to do the same, even though Temple had many security measures. But coming to my room as a maid in the middle of the night\u2026.Come to think of it, Count Argon Pontheus, Sarkegaar\u2019s cover, was a man.What was Sarkegaar\u2019s actual gender? Were they a species who didn\u2019t have something like that?\u201cHow did you get into my room?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard to do.\u201dSarkegaar had the master key all maids had. Well, there should have been several ways for him to get that thing. I also had to talk to Sarkegaar because there were many events complicating my situation.\u201cIn the future, instead of you coming to see me, I will come directly to you.\u201dSarkegaar was good at transforming himself, so it would be possible for him to contact me without being caught. Perhaps because of the time and place, Sarkegaar didn\u2019t lengthen his words with useless rhetorics.\u201cFirst, about the Princess\u2019 supernatural ability.\u201d\u201cYes, did you find out?\u201dSarkegaar shook his head at my words.\u201cI\u2019m here to report what I found first, although I could directly find it out if I take on some big risks.\u201dAlthough he did not find out what her ability was, he decided that he needed to report to me what he found in the process first.\u201cFirst of all, even within the Imperial Family, the talks about the Princess\u2019 supernatural power are divided. In particular, those who belong to Prince Bertus\u2019 faction seem to be skeptical. They think the reason for the information about the Princess\u2019 supernatural ability not getting revealed is because it was fake to begin with.\u201d\u201cMeaning that even Bertus doesn\u2019t know what ability the Princess has.\u201d\u201cYes. Your Highness.\u201dThe Prince didn\u2019t know what abilities she had. That could mean that Charlotte isn\u2019t really a supernatural power user. In the end, that just increased the possibility that her taking the supernatural power classes itself was just to cover up her lie to belong to the Royal Class.\u201cThat means the Emperor is the only one who knows for certain about the Princess\u2019 abilities\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was possible that the supernatural power teacher who took Charlotte to a seperate room knew, but even then there is a chance that she actually doesn\u2019t do anything in there.Even Bertus couldn\u2019t figure it out with his authority.\u201cThen there were only two other people beside the Emperor who knew about it. The Class B homeroom teacher Mr. Mustrang and the teacher in charge of Charlotte during the supernatural power classes.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dThe authenticity of the Princess\u2019 supernatural power was highly confidential, so neither of them would go anywhere running their mouths about it. Both of them were great people who couldn\u2019t be easily touched.They were teachers at Temple. And they were a teacher in charge of the supernatural power lectures who had to control students with dangerous abilities and a Royal Class homeroom teacher. Neither of them were ordinary people.\u201cSo, what did you mean by taking big risks?\u201d\u201cIf there were people who shared the secret, I could disguise myself as one of them, however it\u2019s difficult to find out a secret that only a few select people know.\u201dMr. Mustrang and the supernatural power teacher both resided in Temple. And they both weren\u2019t people that could be led on so easily. They held important positions among the Temple teachers after all.\u201cHmm\u2026. This certainly is a strange situation. Not knowing whether her powers are real or fake\u2026.\u201dDid she lie that she had supernatural powers as to not fall behind Bertus? If so, how long could that lie even last? That being said, the Emperor approved of her using a fake supernatural power to get in.Was that why only a small number of teachers, including the first-year Class B homeroom teacher, Mr. Mustrang, were aware of the Imperial Familiy\u2019s lie, to keep them in check?What if it was actually real? Why would they hide her ability, if it was real though?I didn\u2019t really have to think much to get the reason behind that.\u201cIf she really has a supernatural ability, then it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be revealed to others easily\u2026. It had to be a very problematic ability.\u201d\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201dImperial honor or Imperial prestige.It was an ability that could probably damage either of these, so what the hell kind of ability did she have?\u201cOkay, if it\u2019s too dangerous, let\u2019s just bury this. The truth will come out one way or another.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. That is a wise decision.\u201dSarkegaar answered as such. We should forget about the Princess\u2019 ability for now.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWas there an accident?\u201dI was going to have a duel next week, but I didn\u2019t think that was something I should tell that guy. He would probably just get angry, asserting his uselessly over-the-top loyalty.\u201cIt\u2019s about the Princess again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe Princess is looking for me.\u201dSarkegaar didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was talking about for a moment.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Hearing my story, Sarkegaar\u2019s expression turned grave.It was true that this was a serious issue that couldn\u2019t even be compared to that duel. If we did one wrong move, not only I but the foundation of our activity, the Rotary Gang, could be blown to smithereens. When I told him that even Bertus started paying attention to me, Sarkegaar\u2019s expression became even more serious.\u201cTemple is a much too dangerous place for Your Highness. You should avoid this place\u2026..\u201d\u201cEven if I get to live, the Gang would definitely get blown up.\u201dIf I were to disappear, Charlotte would wipe out the Rotary Gang. \u00a0Money was very important for us.This kind of just happened by chance, but now the Rotary Gang had become our most important source of money. In my case, I didn\u2019t necessarily need that money anymore, but Sarkegaar needed it a lot.\u201cWhat a funny thing. For the Princess to become a problem like that, even though she should be in your debt\u2026.\u201dThat was something that shouldn\u2019t come out of your mouth, Mr. Kidnapper. If it weren\u2019t for you, I might have been able to actually reveal my identity.Well, what happened, happened.\u201cNow I ended up having to do something as absurd as looking for myself, but I have no idea how to go about this. Should I just tell her that I died somewhere and fabricate some evidence?\u201d\u201cThat answer might satisfy the Princess. It would be the best course of action, but\u2026. We don\u2019t know how the Princess will react afterwards.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dSuppose I would tell Charlotte that Valier was dead and show her some fabricated evidence. Assuming they would just take that manipulated evidence at face value.Wouldn\u2019t there be the possibility that they would just get rid of me and the gang after having exceeded our usefulness? It certainly would seem like a bad connection to have after all.\u201cIf I bring them results, they might just get rid of me, and if I don\u2019t, they\u2019ll just get rid of me for being useless\u2026.\u201dI felt like I was in one hell of a dilemma. Whether I did it or didn\u2019t there would be problems popping up, but when I thought about it a little differently, my head suddenly felt clear.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just do it little by little.\u201d\u201cLittle by little?\u201d\u201cYeah. She won\u2019t touch us if we show that we are making some progress at least.\u201dDamn it, I didn\u2019t want to have Charlotte as my enemy. Just to cover up for a small lie that got bigger and bigger over time, I would end up making up much bigger lies.\u201cRather if they feel like we are seriously working on this, they would have to protect us, far from wanting to get rid of us.\u201dBertus would continue to show interest in me as long as he thought I was useful. He was no different from Charlotte in that regard. I had to make some progress in finding Valier.In the meantime, she would just continue to resent me, but wouldn\u2019t touch me, no matter what I did. Rather, she would try to help me if I or the Gang was in danger.Both Charlotte and Bertus hid their true selves from the ordinary students.That was something they had in common. Charlotte pretended to be a bit of a shy person in Class B, but the way she acted and spoke to me that day wasn\u2019t the least bit kind or shy.It was as if they were made out of the same mold, so it would be the same no matter who of them became Emperor.Anyway.This wasn\u2019t a good situation at all, but let\u2019s think positively.I didn\u2019t have to choose between Bertus and Charlotte anymore.\u201cLike this I\u2019d be in a position where I could use both of them.\u201dSarkegaar smiled at my bold words.\u201cI\u2019m amazed by your insight.\u201dCould you stop smiling so creepily with that elegant face? It\u2019s giving me goosebumps.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *My short-term goal was surviving that duel next week.My long term goal was to prove my usefulness to Charlotte, and keep my activities from Bertus.And my very long term goal..\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to just magically improve after just one day, but this is really serious, junior.\u201dPhysical training.Adriana made me recover my physical strength by injecting me with divine power after I was on the verge of exhaustion. A paladin was training the potential next Demon King with all her heart.Actually, wasn\u2019t Adriana constantly sinning by doing that? If Adriana went to hell, wouldn\u2019t that be entirely my fault?Anyway, we kept to that routine. To some extent, one needed a certain amount of physical fitness to be able to use swordsmanship. In terms of exercises, I was trying bench presses at the moment, but I didn\u2019t even have the strength to do a single one. What was the use of technology if one\u2019s basic abilities wouldn\u2019t be able to support it?So, even if I thought that I was about to lose my mind, I had no choice but to clench my fists again, while feeling that strange sensation of my exhausted body normalizing again.Following the morning training with Adriana and her advising me to eat a lot, I ate something before breakfast. Most of the time, I ate together with Ellen, who was a regular in the dining room. Since she requested for simple snacks, the storage soon got refilled with simple food that could be eaten quickly..After listening to the lectures, I resumed my training until dinner.Then after dinner, I\u2019d train and eat something again before I went to bed.After a bit, I reached the point where I could feel my physical prowess improving little by little, perhaps because I started off with a very low level of physical fitness and the support of divine power.Thursday morning.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you train using divine power?\u201dIt was easy and quick growing with it, so why did she not use it? I asked her if there was a specific reason behind that.\u201cIf one takes stimulants every day, one\u2019s body could end up hurt. That\u2019s the reason. Hunger can\u2019t be restored with divine power. I don\u2019t know if one would call it blasphemous for me to say something like this, but it\u2019s not natural to grow with the support of divine power.\u201dDivine power restored stamina, but it didn\u2019t replenish the nutrients spent. So, one could really call it a form of doping. So that was why she kept reminding me to eat a lot.Was that\u00a0stimpack?\u201cThis is just temporary, you hear? If you want to reach a certain level, you have to do it on your own, junior.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dAs if she wanted to clarify something, Adriana more or less told me that she won\u2019t keep on being my stimpack forever.I knew very little about what was going on on Class B\u2019s and Ludwig\u2019s side, but they should be doing fine..Originally, there would have been a scene where they were conflicting with the students from Class A who were trying to pick a fight over each and every little thing.I attracted all of Class A\u2019s aggro, so they didn\u2019t even have time to care about Class B.I, a big villain, took on all of the early villains\u2019 hatred and malice, so there was no \u201caggro\u201d left for the main character.What the hell? I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.Anyway.I continued to train and train some more.So naturally, I ran into Ellen a lot. Our daily routine was almost identical. We mostly ran into each other in the dining room and the gym.That\u2019s how it was for the most part.When I saw her eating whatever she felt like, I really had the urge to give her some of the food I made. Of course, I took all the credit for that.\u201cYou\u2019re really lucky that you came to Temple.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWith the amount of food you eat daily, you could ruin a whole household.\u201dLooking at Ellen, who had just swallowed a huge amount of pasta that I just made, made me feel like dying. I really wondered if there was perhaps a black hole in her stomach.At my words, Ellen looked at me with a sour look on her face, spitting out:\u201cI didn\u2019t want to come here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cTemple told me to come.\u201d\u201cHuh, ah\u2026. I see.\u201dWas she arguing with me now, because I said that she could destroy a household like that? Wait, she was talking about herself, right?She didn\u2019t tell anyone about herself, so no one knew that she was that Warrior\u2019s sister except the Prince, but here she was telling me that she was told to come here, because I scolded her for eating like a black hole. She didn\u2019t want to come here.That was what she had said.Of course, I knew about her personal matters, but it was surprising that she told me a bit about herself like that.She was right. As soon as they found out that Artorius had a sister, they begged her to come to Temple.\u201cAre you mad?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThat made it clear.I was the first who ever succeeded in making Ellen sulk.* * *The training was harder on the weekends. Rather, it felt like I could rest during the lectures on weekdays. On the contrary, I worked a lot more intensely in my free time, so the weekends were a hell of my own creation to me.Adriana stayed longer than usual on those days, making me remember a lot of theoretical knowledge, trained me and made me eat a lot.Sunday.\u201cAh, that\u2019s not how you do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn the kitchen, I strictly watched Ellen cook. She came into the kitchen, saying that she would like to do it on her own this time, because I kept cooking for her. She probably was tired of me taking credit all the time.The menu was presumed to be beef stew with a lot of tenderloin. When I asked her if she knew how to make that, she said that she ate it a lot at home.\u201cHey\u2026. Huh? J, just do it like that. I just told you.\u201d\u201cIs there any salt in there?\u201d\u201cAh, this is overcooked\u2026. You\u2019re teeth will hurt if you try to eat this, you know? Is this supposed to train your jaw?\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s clearly missing in there\u2026. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cAdd in the herbs with this timing\u2026.\u201d...\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen looked at me quietly as I continued to give her instructions.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think you should look at people like that while holding a cleaver.\u201dShe continued to stare at me anyway.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRather, she seemed angry! She just quietly looked at me while holding a kitchen knife. That was hella scary! Ellen looked at me a moment longer, then continued to concentrate on cooking again.\u201cLook at your temper. Ready to put a knife into me if I just say one more word, huh?\u201dOf course, my mouth never went into silent mode. She had a different kind of flavor from cute little Harriet. She didn\u2019t seem to react at all.Honestly, I felt like I had to admit defeat, because I was the one who got pissed instead.Ellen finished cooking regardless of my extreme critique. She then took the enormous amount of stew and set it down on a table. No matter what you tell me, I thought she really wanted to make me angry.I scooped up a bowl of the finished stew, and we each took a spoonful.I stared at Ellen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was half-joking, but the result was the same as last time.\u201cSalty.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe did say that she ate it often at home, not that she cooked it.Eventually, she went back to cooking according to my instruction, managing to make a decent stew.\u201cWhat do you think? Is it edible now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is. Who do you think I am?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs I poked at her until the very end, I finally saw furrows appearing between Ellen\u2019s brows. I felt thrilled finally having made that stone Buddha angry.Ah, I was quite the sadist, wasn\u2019t I?And then, Monday evening.\u201cThat\u2019s not how you do it.\u201dWatching me wield my sword in the gym, Ellen spoke to me casually.\u201c.\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t do it like that.\u201dEllen began to take revenge for my extreme criticism and rudeness she received from me.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46The price for upsetting the stone Buddha was great.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cEven weirder than before.\u201dEllen pointed out that all the sword techniques I displayed were wrong. Then, she demonstrated the right way to do the technique in front of me.\u201cThis is how you do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh.\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201dDamn it. This was like getting hit by a boomerang. I was paying the price for poking at this kid to make fun of her. It really pissed me off.As I clumsily followed her movements, she shook her head.\u201cNo. That\u2019s completely different.\u201dEllen showed me the correct movements again step-by-step and told me to repeat them again. Of course, whatever I did, my moves were bound to look strange to her. I\u2019m totally unskilled after all.As a result, in exchange for making Ellen Artorius, who was like a stone Buddha, angry, she gave me specific training in swordsmanship.The strongest person in my class was teaching me, so, in the end, this was a good outcome.She was someone that wouldn\u2019t have helped me even if I personally asked her.However, she didn\u2019t do this to help me. Ellen, who got angry after my server criticism and teasing, gave me lessons to do the same to me.The result was good, but the process was strange.I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen, so I got more annoyed.\u201cNot like that.\u201dEllen repeatedly told me \u201cNot like this, not like that.\u201d as if to retaliate for the lesson I gave her.Wha, what\u2026.In fact, I should feel thankful right now, as the girl with the strongest talents in the world who was also busy with her own training went out of her way to help me with my swordsmanship training.That was how I should feel.\u201c\u2026Why not?\u201dI was angry. I was even more angry because I didn\u2019t deserve to be angry. I was so mad, I had to change this up, and get back at her.I.I was the the total incarnation of a hypocrite. I found it funny to tease others, but got annoyed as soon as someone did it to me.A child was a child, so there was no excuse for that.However I was a somewhat screwed up adult, so I was a bit twisted.\u201cHey. I know you\u2019re good at it. Uh. So if you\u2019re giving me lessons, why won\u2019t you teach me properly, huh?\u201dFacing my own ugly nature head-on, I became a little passive.\u201cSo like this.\u201dEllen demonstrated moves that were close to picturesque. When she looked at me with curious eyes, wondering why I couldn\u2019t do it, it felt like she was poking at me thoroughly.Yes, I was the perfect incarnation of a hypocrite.See you later in the dining room.I\u2019ll get you later.* * *After that day, whenever we made something in the kitchen and Ellen cooked I would criticize her and nag while giving her instructions. And when I was in the gym, Ellen would give me extremely strict lessons while I was practicing my swordsmanship.It was like we were instructing each other. If one were just to hear these words, one might think what we shared was a beautiful friendship.However, I didn\u2019t think what grew between us was friendship by instructing each other, but malice.\u201cFrickin hell, why don\u2019t you know something as simple as that? Don\u2019t you know what a measuring cup is? Or how to read a cookbook?\u201d\u201cAnnoying.\u201dIn the kitchen.\u201cYou have to move your arms by this much, to that degree, like this. Why can\u2019t you do it?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m exhausted. It\u2019s been a few hours, if I were able to move like that in this condition, that would be hella weird, man.\u201d\u201cWhat about earlier?\u201d\u201c\u2026O, of course, I did better then! I was in better shape after all!\u201d\u201c\u2026If you thought that was better\u2026. Maybe you need to suffer a bit more.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re oh so great, huh?\u201dIn the gym.Like this we were building up that chain of malice caused by our extreme instructions.By the way, even though she always said it was annoying, she definitely had fun cooking. She seemed tired of snacks. I could see that she was doing what I taught here even though she wasn\u2019t that good at it.Technically, she genuinely seemed to want to learn how to cook for herself even after listening to my instructions, rather than just wanting to show off what she cooked to me.I had to learn swordsmanship to increase my physical abilities anyway, so I did what Ellen told me to.It wasn\u2019t just swordsmanship training.\u201cTry.\u201dI also sparred with Ellen. When I rushed and stabbed my sword towards her, Ellen put her sword against mine and slid it outwards, and hit my solar plexus with her right shoulder.-Puck!\u201cKak!\u201dAs soon as I fell, Ellen put her sword against my neck.\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201dThis couldn\u2019t even be called sword play anymore, it was just a one-sided beating. Whatever I did, she just sent me flying in an instant.\u201cWasn\u2019t that a body blow? That\u2019s a foul, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAt my cheeky words, Ellen just tilted her head.\u201cThere are no such things in a real battle.\u201dThose were some cruel words for a child to say, but she was right, so I couldn\u2019t refute.After that, Ellen taught me various forms of swordsmanship, offensive and submission techniques while practicing like that. Ellen knew a lot of things we hadn\u2019t learned yet from the swordsmanship theory lecture.It was true that it was more beneficial to train with a living partner than just stubbornly training swordsmanship techniques on your own.I looked up her physical data out of curiosity. There weren\u2019t any details, and a lot of her talents were redacted, but it did get announced in the classroom. It was like a simplified form of the status screen, so to speak. This was also used in the original.Royal Class, Year 1, A-2, Ellen.[Strength 16.5(B)] [Agility 18.3(B+)] [Dexterity 20.2(A-)] [Magic 23(A)][Stamina 15.3(B-)]Talents[Weapon Mastery][Magic Control]It was very simplistic, compared to my status that the system displayed to me. Information that the physical scanner wouldn\u2019t be able to grasp would not be displayed on it. For example, the rank of one\u2019s swordsmanship or the skills one had.Ellen had a lot of talent, but the list got reduced a lot by Temple, only leaving Weapon Mastery and Magic Control. Although she already had the comprehensive talent, Weapon Mastery, Magic Control was another one. It included the talents Magic Manipulation, Magic Sensitivity and Magic Growth.Just by having these two talents, she was already far ahead of Bertus, and yet they dared to call her Number 2.She wouldn\u2019t even need a talent to be better.Even when considering her physical abilities, Ellen far exceeded mine which were mostly ranked as F or D.In the combat rank classifications, there is little change in the rank even if one\u2019s numbers increased and one reached a higher rank.In that classification system, Ellen was already at a ridiculously high level.Having a Status of S Rank and higher was at the level of a superhuman. In the first place, that rank could only be reached by someone of master level or higher.I didn\u2019t know what her combat rank would be, but it would probably be above A Rank.None of her classmates, or anyone from the Royal Class for that matter, possessed that level of physical ability.\u201cUrk!\u201d\u201cHuk!\u201d\u201cKerk!\u201d\u201cUwark!\u201d...Didn\u2019t it seem like that bastard was just using this as an excuse to beat me up?However, I also realized a lot of things through that.In the end, swordsmanship wasn\u2019t just about using the sword, but the whole body, including one\u2019s fists and feet. There were even techniques that implemented characteristics of grappling that included performing faints with the sword to grab the opponent\u2019s collar.That was how I came to the realization that the arm that didn\u2019t hold the sword was also very important, whether holding the sword with both hands, to deflect the enemy\u2019s sword, to subdue the enemy empty handed or to catch the enemy\u2019s blade.There were so many applications that I couldn\u2019t memorize all of them.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u2013 Thud!At the time, she flicked away my sword, she almost crushed me, not forgetting that strange action of pointing her sword at my neck\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d\u2026telling me that I was dead after subduing me.\u201cYou\u2019re heavy, man\u2026.\u201dEven if it was part of swordsmanship, don\u2019t ride on me like that. During our spars, Ellen showed me many different ways how one could get beat up with a sword. This time she showed me something dumbfounding.\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you making fun of me right now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you now holding your sword upside down to beat me up?\u201dShe was holding her sword blade and hit me on the head with the cross guard. When I saw that, I felt it was so ridiculous I almost froze. Was she insulting me?Ellen shook her head.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s actually a way to use it. Against heavily armed enemies.\u201d\u201cIs there really such a strange technique in swordsmanship? What if one ended up cutting their hand?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t cut that easily.\u201dEllen said that it wasn\u2019t only possible because this was a training sword, but I didn\u2019t trust her 100% on that. Anyway, as I already knew from first-hand experience, Ellen wasn\u2019t on the level of having to learn swordsmanship like my other classmates.Ellen tried teaching me her swordsmanship, including how to subdue an enemy, and told me to try it as well. In other words, she beat me up so much that my losses couldn\u2019t be counted anymore, so in the end, she had no other choice but to explain it to me slowly.She taught me how to deflect a sword, how to use my left arm without holding the sword, and finally something similar to toppling techniques to make your opponent fall, which seemed like they came straight up out of a martial arts game.Still, I was starting to wonder if I could ever do these kinds of things.\u201cYou\u2019re too slow, and your motions are clumsy.\u201dEven while I was getting crushed under her, Ellen shook her head as if this wasn\u2019t it either. No, well, if I were a real adolescent boy, I would be really excited to be in this kind of situation right now! This is really crossing the line!Couldn\u2019t she see that No. 5 Cliffman, who was standing beside us at the moment, clinging to his sword, was spying on us, wondering what we were doing? Couldn\u2019t she see him swallowing hard?Wait.Wh, why was she?He, hey, hey!She was looking at me as if I was just a little brat!\u201cDo it again.\u201dNot only me, but Ellen was also covered in sweat as she was sparing with me for a long time now.I thought that now was the right timing. My opponent was extremely arrogant and saw me as just a child.As a result.-Kang! Kakang!\u201cMy arm will rip ooout!\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201dWe were both focused on swordsmanship practice and the lessons.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The date of the duel was just after lunch time on Sunday.And since Friday, Ellen was making me practice quit the strange things.\u201cHold it tight.\u201d-Bang!\u201c!\u201d\u2013 Clink!She slammed against the side of the sword I was holding while aiming forward.The training sword, which escaped from my grasp, clattered on the gym floor.\u201cEvery technique in the world is useless if you lose your sword.\u201dIf you lose something that essential, you would end up dead.\u201cYour grip is too weak.\u201dMy grip was so weak that I would lose my sword with just a single hit like that. Ellen tried to test my grip strength on Friday, so she slammed away my sword rather than just suppressing me, demanding that I held onto it tightly.Not only did my hands feel tingly, the more we continued to train the weaker my grip became.And.-Katchin!How long have we been doing that? When Ellen hit the side of my sword once again, the sword shattered.\u201cWha, what\u2026?\u201dAs the sword got broken, my hand didn\u2019t hurt, but did she really hit so hard that she was able to destroy a sword? Ellen looked at the broken training sword and picked up the remaining pieces.\u201cTraining swords aren\u2019t durable usually. They break easily.\u201dIt looked like she already broke a few of them before.\u201cThat\u2019s what Temple uses though?\u201d\u201cIt would be a problem if the training swords had too high a quality.\u201dTraining swords had no edge at all. It would be a big problem, if one were to ever get hurt by using these. And it seemed like they purposefully used poor materials because if it turned out too durable nothing good would come from that. Even if it didn\u2019t have an edge, it could become a blunt weapon if one used enough strength.\u201cDon\u2019t let go of your sword.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, okay?\u201dAfter the sword broke I plopped down on the floor. I couldn\u2019t do anything anymore as my hands felt like they were about to break.Grip strength was important.As such Adriana kept on focusing on grip strength during her physical training. She continued training her grip, saying that a strong grip was essential in fighting with a sword.Today, Ellen kept on testing if I would drop my sword or not by hitting it in different angles.Cliffman also went back to rest, so it was just the two of us in the gym. Of course, there weren\u2019t always just us three here. Bertus and Erich also came by sometimes to train.Bertus had a strange smile on his face when he saw me train with Ellen. He didn\u2019t say much about my planned duel, although he seemed subtly proud seeing what I was trying here.He kind of gave the impression of watching his great subordinate No. 1 doing well even if left alone.In addition, there was little friction between me and the other children as I was completely focused on training for the duel. Well, some of my hindrances had already been cleared up, so the other children probably didn\u2019t dare to touch me.Still, all of the kids were looking forward to Sunday.It was the day when Reinhardt, the psycho bastard, would receive some true education. All those who hated my guts would come to see the duel.\u201cYou will lose.\u201dEllen suddenly told me. This girl hadn\u2019t said anything up until now about my duel.It would be weird for her not to know, why I was focusing on training like that all of a sudden.\u201cI know.\u201dEveryone told me that I was going to lose, and I knew that. Ellen also knew I wasn\u2019t particularly confident about this either, so why was she talking about that so suddenly?\u201cDo you want to win?\u201dShe even asked me things like that. I didn\u2019t know what her intentions were, but seeing Ellen ask these kinds of things, did that mean that we grew a bit closer at least?Do I want to win?\u201cNaturally.\u201dIt would be nice if I were able to win regardless whether it\u2019s possible or not. I would get three times the points as my reward after all, my friend. Ellen didn\u2019t even look at me up to that moment, but then suddenly she turned her gaze directly at me. Her calm dark-blue eyes stared at me.She really was picturesque.\u201cI know a method for you to win.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dWhat did she mean? No matter how much I thought about it, there was practically no way for me to defeat a guy with a high level swordsmanship talent as well as a sophomore. I had no idea what it was, but Ellen seemed to know at least one method for me to win this duel.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Think carefully what a duel is.\u201dThat was all Ellen said.\u201cWait, what are you talking about?\u201dI grumbled besides her, asking what the hell she meant, but she kept her mouth shut as if she didn\u2019t want to tell me any more.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47The day before the duel.On Saturday, I did my strength training with Adriana in the morning as usual.She continued her training, while aiding me with her divine power.Even after breakfast, Adriana called me back and gave me more training.\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dI definitely felt that my stamina improved by a lot in that short amount of time. That rapid growth and this feeling across my whole body gave me some joy, even while I was in extreme physical and mental pain.\u201cJunior, don\u2019t do anything anymore tomorrow morning. Stay in good shape.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAdriana could restore my strength, but if she did that and I did more, it would have adverse effects on tomorrow\u2019s duel. I knew that much, so I was only going to train up to that point.I didn\u2019t really know what difference it would make if I maintained my best condition for this duel that I was going to lose anyway.Adriana trained me in the morning as well as in the afternoon and sat with me on a park bench in front of the dormitory. She handed me a canteen. It was more than usual.Due to the intense training, I couldn\u2019t help but gulp down a ton of water.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dSeeing me exhausted, Adriana looked at me with a strange smile on her lips.\u201cJunior, you are really weird.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI believe you have enough patience and perseverance in you, to the point that you could follow my lead very well so far. Why are you so rude to others?\u201dShe seemed to have noticed that I wasn\u2019t such an impatient, short-tempered guy during this week of training. However, she didn\u2019t understand why I was being so rude to others, in fights and outside of them. To the point that I would disgrace my opponent like that.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be ignored.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cEven if I put up with it once, there would be another guy picking a fight. Should I just endure it twice then? I\u2019d just get hit again and again, that\u2019s when you\u2019re already caught in this vicious circle.\u201dAdriana sighed deeply at my words.\u201cIsn\u2019t that tiring? Getting angry, fighting someone, bumping into them because you felt a little upset.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just like that.\u201dAfter I drank all the water from the canteen, I stared blankly at the lush park.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to get exhausted as a shitty bastard than a pushover.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026. I can\u2019t understand you at all.\u201dAdriana shook her head as if she didn\u2019t understand a thing I said.\u201cBy the way, there\u2019s something I wanted to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAdriana stared at me as if she was willing to answer if it was within her capability.\u201cA classmate of mine said that there was only one way for me to win this duel, do you maybe know what she meant, senior?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAdriana thought for a moment, as if what I said was rather bizarre. The only way I could win. What was it that Ellen thought?\u201cThat\u2026. I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201dAdriana shook her head as if to show that she really didn\u2019t know.Okay.Ellen wouldn\u2019t tell me even if I grabbed her collar and shook her. Rather, I should just give it my best shot.If I lose, I lose.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The time of the decisive battle had come.Thanks to the training I did over this week I was definitely in much better shape than I was before, as I trained while being heavily doped.Current stats: [Strength 4.8(F+)] [Agility 5.0(D-)] [Dexterity 5.9(D-)] [Magic 10.1(C)][Stamina 8.1(C-)]My strength increased by 0.8, my agility by 0.3, my dexterity by 0.7, and my stamina by 1.6. I trained with Adriana to increase my strength and stamina, and I presumed that my dexterity went up because of the spars I had with Ellen.So, why did my magic stat go up again?There were some changes in the sub-menus as well.Skills[Demon Domination \u2013 D](Unique skill of Arcdemons)(Cannot be used in current state.)[Self-suggestion](Locked)[Pseudo Swordsmanship]Comprehensive Ability Assessment \u2013 Lowest level DemonCombat Level Assessment \u2013 F+.\u2026What\u2019s with that?What was pseudo swordsmanship supposed to be? It wasn\u2019t even Rank F. It was just pseudo swordsmanship. What was that? Were they telling me that I couldn\u2019t even do F Rank Swordsmanship yet? Was I even unable to use the lowest level of swordsmanship or something like that?The fact that my combat level went from F to F+ was also truly breathtaking. They should have just left it as F. F+ makes me seem even lamer.That pseudo swordsmanship I barely obtained after such hard work was nearly crushing my heart.In any case, there was a dramatic improvement to my physical fitness. My abilities seemed to have improved evenly, and if I continue to practice, I\u2019d hit my limit someday, anyway. At that time, I would have to use achievement points or something, but first, I had to achieve whatever I could with my own body.Afternoon.First Year Class A\u2019s dormitory gym.There were quite a few people now in this place where Ellen and I clashed swords repeatedly.A lot of people came just to watch me lose.Bertus was absent. It was the weekend, so it seemed likely that he returned to the Imperial Palace and wasn\u2019t particularly curious about my duel\u2019s results.Everyone of Class A, except No.1 Bertus and No. 3 Liana de Grantz, were present. It was rather surprising that Ellen came to watch my duel. All the classmates that were present when I messed with this senior were here.There were also some of Class B present.\u201cReinhardt! Cheer up!\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dOf course, the kind Ludwig came to support me. He seemed to have brought some friends with him with whom he was particularly close with. B-9 Delphine Izadra and B-10 Lanian Sesor. I never even held a conversation with either of them.It didn\u2019t seem like I would ever have anything to do with them in the future. Pretty funny that I didn\u2019t have any connection to the kids I wrote about the most.And she was a bit far from the others, but she also came to watch. Charlotte was watching silently from afar.That was weird. I was sure she didn\u2019t come to cheer me on. Rather, it seemed more like an investigation. Maybe she was curious as to how I would act in a duel, or she wanted to ask me about the progress in Valier\u2019s search.It somehow seemed like she was trying to confirm my usefulness.There were other people, I didn\u2019t expect to see here, for example, B-3, Scarlett. Her red eyes and hair made her stand out.I didn\u2019t have any connection to her either, so why did she come to look? I wouldn\u2019t be very interested in something that had nothing to do with me. Strictly speaking, if I were her I wouldn\u2019t want to go near Class A even more.\u201cWhy did that cursed bitch come here? How unlucky.\u201dScarlett came to watch my duel, even though she had no reason to. Erich, who seemed desperate to bully her, was also here after all. Although I stood far away from Erich, she definitely stared at me.What was this?Since this event never happened in the original, there should have been some motive behind her actions that couldn\u2019t be found in the original.My classmates were made up of these kinds of people, and most of them would love to see me get horribly trampled. Ludwig excluded, I had no idea what Ellen was thinking. She was just squatting at some corner, looking at me.\u201cYou\u2019re going to be in big trouble today, you beggar. Be prepared.\u201dHarriet smirked behind her hands.\u201cOh, Have fun watching.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cHave fun.\u201d\u201cWha, what really\u2026.\u201dHarriet looked dazed again when I told her to have fun while watching me get beat up.Preconceptions seemed to be very important. At first, I snapped at her a bit because I got annoyed, but when I thought it over again I couldn\u2019t see her as anything but a cute little kid, so no matter what she did, it seemed kind of endearing.In other words, when I saw this girl, who I\u00a0 obviously set up as a villain, act like this I couldn\u2019t help but find it cute and she might have unexpectedly become my favorite character.Because she didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on.On the seniors\u2019 side, it seemed like the entire Second Year Class A came. Seeing as there were more than ten people there, did some from Class B come as well? Did they want to see the face of the guy who dared to defy one of the seniors? Was it something like that?The faces I could recognize were the duelist I was going to face, Art de Gartis, Adriana and the little brat named Redina who looked between me and Art with a teary expression.I should really go buy her something later. I couldn\u2019t believe I said something like that to such a nice girl. My neck was going numb from just thinking about that.She was such a good and kind girl!Yeah! I deserve to be hit!And then there was the observer, Mr. Epinhauser.\u201cI think we\u2019re ready, so let\u2019s go ahead with this.\u201dActual duels were actually held with one\u2019s life at stake. However, duels between students shouldn\u2019t be death matches.Therefore, duels were only conducted under the supervision of a teacher who was able to restrain the students at any time.Mr. Epinhauser didn\u2019t question why we were fighting. He was just doing what the regulations stipulated him to do, so he allowed us to do this.If it were Mr. Mustrang, he would have told us not to do this. Their personalities were polar opposites.\u201cArt de Gartis who had his honor sullied by Reinhardt\u2026. I\u2019ll just read it as it was written in the report.\u201dMr. Epinhauser began to read the report done on the circumstances of our duel.\u201cOn Saturday, two weeks ago, First Year A-11 Reinhardt grabbed the crotch of Second Year A-3 Art de Gartis and squeezed it hard\u2026.\u201d-Pffft!-Kufufum!-Oh my god!Mr. Epinhauser read that part so seriously, that everyone around, no matter on what side they stood, began to laugh. Either way, the teacher just read it all to the end.I also found this quite funny and Art\u2019s expression became quite weird. But I gotta say, Mr. Epinhauser was one hell of a guy.\u201cHe claimed that he suffered from extreme mental and physical pain as well as incredible humiliation, which consequently damaged his reputation. Therefore he requested a duel, demanding an apology from Reinhardt, No. A-11, who accepted this duel. Am I correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYees\u2026.\u201dArt didn\u2019t laugh, but I barely managed to answer in a slurred voice, because this was just too funny.\u201cState what you want in return for victory.\u201dArt replied to Epinhauser\u2019s words.\u201cI want Reinhardt to kneel before his seniors and apologize for his disrespect and I want him to swear to always respect his seniors from that point on.\u201dWhat he wanted for his victory was an apology and respect. What he meant was that whatever they decide in the future I should kneel before them and just nod my head. This time Mr. Epinhauser looked at me.My reward for gaining victory in this duel I had a slim chance of winning.\u201cI hope that these absurd acts that the seniors were trying to impose on us so far will not be forced either on me nor my classmates anymore. Of course, they should apologize as well.\u201dAt my words, the children\u2019s expressions became strange.Even if it was obvious that I was going to lose, they didn\u2019t expect me to say that I wanted them to stop bullying my classmates in return for victory.What were they looking at me like that for?It was a reward I wouldn\u2019t even be able to receive anyway.\u201cGood. Ars, the god of war, shall take the side of the righteous.\u201dDueling was, after all, a barbaric act.It was clear that God would only stand on the side of the righteous, so the one who won was always in the right. Whoever was chosen by Ars, God of War, would win. That just sounded like bullshit.And then, right when Mr. Epinhauser was about to announce the start of the duel.\u201cTeacher.\u201dArt, unable to hide his displeasure, raised his hand.\u201cI will nominate a champion as my right as a duelist.\u201dThis.What the hell was he talking about?A champion?\u201cName him.\u201d\u201cMy champion is Third Year A-7, Mayarton.\u201dArt, with a distorted expression on his face, retreated and someone else took his place in front of me, receiving his training sword. The one who accepted it was laughing as if this situation was just too funny to bear.Only then did I realize. Even if all the second years, including people from Class B, were here, the number just wouldn\u2019t add up.That meant the guys from Year Three Class A came here as well.\u201cSo you were the guy who told us to come when the Prince was around, yeah?\u201dThe third years were offended by what I said and took Art\u2019s duel seat. I dared them to try and come at us when the Prince was around, but they couldn\u2019t do it, so their pride was hurt, hence they wanted to take care of me themselves.Art also seemed to have gotten forced into this rather than this actually being his will, and Adriana looked at this scene wide-eyed. I guessed she didn\u2019t know that this would happen.The guy in front of me looked down at me with a fishy smile.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re just as skilled as your dog mouth, Junior.\u201dAt that moment I finally realized what the only way I could win was.Choosing a great warrior as my Champion.A duelist could choose someone to fight on their behalf with their right.Then I looked towards Ellen Artorius, who was squatting in the corner, staring at me quietly.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-NodShe looked at me and nodded her head.That was the only way I could win.At that moment, Ellen signaled to me that she could be my Champion.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Things were going differently from what I expected. I didn\u2019t think I would win this duel to begin with, but I never expected the third years to make their appearance. How cheap could these guys even get? You didn\u2019t want to mess with us when the Prince was around, but now you were trying to bully your juniors like this?The odds of winning, which were already slim, now became slimmer, though this probably wouldn\u2019t change much.However, that guy in front of me, Mayarton, kept staring at me as if he was thinking about how to truly educate me.My classmates were equally surprised by the sudden appearance of this third year Champion.If I named Ellen as my Champion she would be willing to come up. But no matter how good she was, would she be able to beat a third year? He had been at Temple for two years longer than her after all.Maybe, she would win. I had no idea what Mayarton was like, but she should be more than enough to win. If one wanted to beat Ellen, one had to be a superhuman or someone who had reached the limit of what a human is capable of. I didn\u2019t think that this guy was someone like that. Someone as strong as that was very rarely found in Temple, so they wouldn\u2019t do something meaningless like this.Perhaps because of this sudden change in circumstances, there was one more person whose mood changed slightly, besides Ellen.It was Adriana.She seemed angry beyond perplexity, confronted with this situation. That calm senior was looking at me quietly. I could tell just by looking at her eyes.Her eyes seemed to tell me that she would fight for me.Adriana, originally, hated this absurd hereditary tradition anyway. She even told me that she didn\u2019t like her seniors all that much.However, now that there was a third year standing before me, seeing that guy butt in in a duel against a first year, it seemed like she couldn\u2019t stand by anymore.Adriana spoke to me with her eyes.\u00a0\u2018Make me your Champion\u2019.I thought I was going around fucking up my Temple life, but there were actually two people willing to fight for me. Had I actually been doing well?\u201cIf there is no disagreement, the duel will begin immediately. If the outcome seems clear or if one side surrenders, the duel will end.\u201d\u201cTeacher. I have something I would like to suggest.\u201dMayarton looked at Mr Epinhauser and said:\u201cCan\u2019t we just make it a rule that the duel will end if either side surrenders?\u201d\u201cAnd what would be the reason for that?\u201d\u201cThe result is already pretty clear after all. However, I want to teach some manners to this rash junior here.\u201dSo, unless I explicitly said I surrender, the duel wouldn\u2019t end? He would definitely win with the normal rules, but he didn\u2019t want the duel to end as soon as his sword touched me.His purpose wasn\u2019t to defeat me, but ro crush me.\u201cReinhardt, do you agree to these terms?\u201dI\u2019ve been hoping for that, you bastard.\u201cYes, but instead I have a condition.\u201d\u201cWhich would be?\u201dEllen and Adriana would both be willing to fight for me. Circumstances had changed, and I had been caught by a hell of a lot worse bastard than Art. Art probably would have wanted to fight me fairly.However, that guy definitely would treat me a lot worse than him.The situation changed and so did my judgment.\u201cMayarton is a third year, and I\u2019m just a first year. There\u2019s a clear difference in ability in not just a single area.\u201dMr. Epinhauser nodded his head as if agreeing with me.\u201cI want to use my right as a duelist and\u2026.\u201dWho should I call?\u201cAsk the opponent for a handicap.\u201dI didn\u2019t call for anyone.* * *When Ellen talked to me the other day she meant that if one thought about what kind of duel this was, one would think of choosing a champion.However, when Art nominated his champion, I thought of something else.A handicap.If there was just too much strength difference between you and your opponent, you could give the opponent a handicap. That was the kind of situation I was in right now.Neither Ellen nor Adriana seemed to have expected that I would use the handicap instead of nominating a Champion. Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t have thought to use the handicap either if this Champion didn\u2019t suddenly appear.Mayarton burst out in laughter at my words.\u201cJunior, are you seriously planning on beating me?\u201dHe was smiling, but seemed to be really angry. It was like he thought that I believed that I would be able to beat him if I just gave him a handicap. Mr. Epinhauser, the observer of the duel, nodded.\u201cGood. During the duel, Mayarton is forbidden from using his left hand.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Mayarton who gave himself that handicap, but Mr. Epinhauser. Mayarton snorted at him and hid his left arm behind his back, as if that handicap didn\u2019t matter at all.Before I wouldn\u2019t have thought that to be a big handicap either, but I had learned what an important role the hand which didn\u2019t hold the sword played while sparring with Ellen. Having one arm sealed away was a huge handicap.Of course, it would be very unlikely for me to surpass this power difference with just that.Then, before everyone\u2019s eyes, Mr. Epinhauser declared:\u201cStart the duel.\u201dMayarton didn\u2019t immediately rush at me. He held his training sword in his right hand and slowly approached me with his left arm hidden behind his back. I didn\u2019t have a single strategy in my mind. Would the countless skills I learned from Ellen really work on someone like him? If I had some good skills, I might have been able to overcome this gap, but I only learned some things by sparring.I didn\u2019t even know proper swordsmanship yet. It would be arrogant to think that I learned it properly when I only just learned a few techniques.That guy approached me as if he just went out for a walk, he wasn\u2019t feeling wary of me at all.\u201cDid you freeze up?\u201dWhen the man approached me with his sword pointed forward and tried to enter my range, I pushed his sword to the side and tried to push in.-Kang!\u201cKurk!\u201dHowever, as if he saw through all my movements, he powerfully slashed at the sword I was holding with both of my hands, while he held his with one hand.That shock forced me to take a few steps back. Even though I was holding my sword with two hands, it felt like my palms were going to tear apart.\u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201dMayarton stared at me, having been pushed a few steps back.I was very confident that he\u2019d be able to subdue me right at this moment, but he was trying to play with me. He was trying to trample my pride and make me realize that I was nothing in front of him. Mayarton leaned over his body and ran straight at me.-Kang!Then he started attacking me.-Kang!\u201cKuk!\u201d-Kang!He attacked the sword I was holding, to be exact.Intentionally.-Kang!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u2013 Clink!As soon as I let go of my sword, he kicked me in the stomach.-Pow!\u201cCough!\u201dI realized something as soon as I collapsed to the floor together with my sword. Until I surrendered, until I bent my pride and surrendered.That guy would continue this.\u201cWhat are you doing, Junior? Letting go of your sword like that.\u201dHe kicked the sword I dropped towards me.\u201cPick it up.\u201d-Claaang!As soon as I picked up the sword, Mayarton rushed at me and hit the side of my training sword once again.The sword slipped out of my grasp and rolled to the floor again.Mayarton smiled at me.\u201cPick it up.\u201dI could see now why Ellen trained me to properly hold my sword and not let go of it.She knew that they would do this to me.* * *-Kaang!The power of my grip was gradually getting drained away.\u201cI really don\u2019t get it.\u201d-Thud!\u201cUrgh!\u201dEvery time I let go of my sword, he would hit me with his elbow, kick me and knee me as if I was being punished for it.\u201cSomeone like you, who has no skill or credibility.\u201d-Puck!\u201cKrrk!\u201d\u201cWhy did you decide to mess with us?\u201dHe had no intention of subduing me. He saw me on the floor and kicked the training sword towards me.He blew away my sword and gleefully watched me pick it up again.The humiliation given by the act of having one\u2019s sword hit out of one\u2019s hand and made to pick it up over and over again was no joke.I felt miserable and ashamed at the thought that I was only on the level of a toy for my opponent. Nothing had changed about that even if he was just a piece of trash that found joy in beating up his juniors who were two years younger than him.I knew I would lose and I knew I would get humiliated like this. In addition to the humiliation I felt, the pain all over my body was enormous as what he was subjecting me to was more like corporal punishment than an actual fight.I held my sword again, and it got slammed out of my hand yet again.-Kaang!My palms were torn and bleeding.This was no longer a duel. It wasn\u2019t a duel to begin with. He didn\u2019t treat this as a duel from the start.He just casually walked towards me, swung his sword lightly and make my sword bounce off. Then he kicked and slapped me when I was defenseless, treating me like a joke.He looked down at me as if I was pathetic as I was continuously falling down and getting up.\u201cYou\u2019re nothing before a Swordmaster.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrgh\u201d\u201cStay down, you bastard.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cHow good things would have been if you acted nicely.\u201d-Bang!\u201cUggh!\u201d\u201cYou lost. Come on, say you surrender.\u00a0 That would be more comfortable for you, right?\u201d-Pow!\u201cGuh!\u201d\u201cDo it.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d\u2013 Pow!\u201cWell, fine by me.\u201dHe kept insulting me, not showing the slightest bit of sympathy as I kept trying to get up.I was a filthy bastard, but that guy was a little different.That guy wasn\u2019t just dirty, he was cruel.As I was trying to cover up my lack of ability with acting dirty, that guy did it by acting cruel.And he was clearly incomparably stronger than me.The more I got up and tried to resist, the more he seemed to be pleased rather than showing admiration for my endurance. It looked like that guy felt delight at his victim\u2019s futile stuggle.I felt the atmosphere around me as I grabbed my training sword again.There were no emotions in Mr. Epinhauser\u2019s expression and eyes.However, most of my classmates\u2019 expressions were distorted.There were cases like that.In any kind of event, if one side was starting to lose miserably, there would be some who would unwittingly start to cheer for that team.They don\u2019t want the other team to be so helplessly crushed, so they want them to do a little better.Now I was on that miserably losing side.Harriet de Saint-Owan, who showed delight at first at me receiving some true education, was also at a loss. Her complexion was completely white. She looked between me and Mr. Epinhauser. It was as if she was asking with her eyes why he didn\u2019t stop this fight even though it was clear who the winner was.She had been imagining it, but she didn\u2019t think it would be like this.I didn\u2019t know I would end up this miserable either.Some were calm.Ellen was still looking at me and so was Charlotte.Rather, the people who loathed and hated me were the ones who got terrified. It seemed like they thought that I would end up dying like this.Even though duels at Temple could be called child\u2019s play compared to actual duels, it was still a duel after all.It wasn\u2019t at the level of a simple match.The duel wouldn\u2019t end unless someone surrendered. Even Mr. Epinhauser wouldn\u2019t intervene unless my life was at risk.I didn\u2019t even want that kind of intervention. Watching me crawl back up again, the other kids\u2019 faces distorted, not Mayarton\u2019s though.It seemed like he wanted me to surrender.He wanted me to admit defeat and back off.I didn\u2019t know why I was doing this. In a complete mess, I looked at Mayarton with my whole body aching as well as my hands.I wouldn\u2019t be able to win.However, the wind seemed to be picking up.Although I wouldn\u2019t be able to win.That wretched, cruel, fucking bastard.\u201cYou, I\u2019ll get one in.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEven if I got crushed and trampled over, I would definitely get in a single punch.\u201cI\u2019ll fucking get you at least once, you son of a bitch!\u201dI would at least get one hit in.The reality of my coming defeat or any plans I had about developing my supernatural power by putting me in an extreme mental state, all of that was forgotten in my seething anger.I got hit too many times.I was hit so hard, that all the heat rushed up straight to my head.If I didn\u2019t get even a single bite out of that fucking bastard, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep for the next month or so.I rushed at him with all the strength I still had left, and prepared to use something. If I would hesitate, he would either kick me or hit me with his sword.I never planned on using this for something like that.But, I was so fucking annoyed that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.[Used the \u2018Revise\u2019 Function.][20 Achievement Points are required to trigger this event.]I hit the sword that blocked my eyes and made \u2018something that originally shouldn\u2019t happen\u2019 happen right at that moment.His sword.It shattered the moment my sword hit it.\u2013 Kaang!The sword that blocked mine broke, dyeing Mayarton\u2019s expression in surprise.\u2013 Pow!\u201cGah!\u201dAt the same time as my training sword struck his head, I rammed my knee into \u2018the place\u2019 that started this whole duel.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Training swords weren\u2019t made out of durable material.I remembered Ellen telling me that. And the constant use of this particular one made this event possible. The less probable an event, the more achievement points it would require.Conversely, if it was highly probable it would require relatively few points.The event of a training sword breaking after constant collisions, wasn\u2019t that improbable. So, I was able to trigger this event using a very small amount of points.It was definitely more probable than making someone highly trained in close combat suddenly fall over or surrender. In the end, I was able to land a blow using the methods available to me.Knowing this pain, Art put his legs together, and the man in front of me grabbed his thing and stepped back with a painful expression on his face.\u201cU, urgh\u2026. This, this dog\u2026. This dog-like bastard\u2026!\u201dUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t fall down even though he was sweating profusely. If he recovered from his stunned state, there would be more severe consequences for me.His sword was broken, so Mr. Epinhauser took out a new one and threw it to him.I couldn\u2019t give him time to pick it up.If he recovered from his damage, I would be dead.I rushed in while that man, who was shivering after being kicked in the crotch, clumsily tried to pick up the training sword.-Thud!\u201cAah!\u201dI didn\u2019t swing my sword, I hit him with my body. As I looked at Mayarton, who was still in pain, I held my training sword upside down.-Pow!Then, as Ellen showed me the other day, I slapped him in the head using the cross guard.She told me that it was used against heavily armed enemies, but now I was using this to stun that guy.-Bang!\u201cArgh! Y, you son of a bitch!\u201dIf I were able to use my full power, this would have ended in his head splitting open, but because I lost a lot of my strength it only made him feel some pain. I hoped he would at least faint.-Thud! Pow! Pock! Bam!While he still hadn\u2019t recovered yet from the pain, I kicked him, trampled on him and slapped him in the face.However, his body, which had been trained to the limit, didn\u2019t receive any meaningful damage. He squatted and endured all my powerless attacks. It was the same for him. The fight wouldn\u2019t end if he didn\u2019t surrender.He would just wait it out until he recovered.-Thud!\u201cArgh!\u201dAnd that moment came pretty fast. As he pushed me away, he took a step back and got up.I had no time to relax. This senior\u2019s face was flushed red, probably because he got humiliated by a first-year junior.What kind of duel was this?It was just a dog fight.This was just a quarrel between children with no pride, honor or respect. His eyes gleamed with life.The expressions of the onlookers started to get weird.I was helpless, but because I unexpectedly counterattacked, did they start to cheer for me? Did they honestly think I could win this even remotely?\u201cYes, don\u2019t ever surrender. Please.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t gonna happen. The senior was still waiting to recover or he was ready to stop me if I came anywhere close him. Right now, he was just watching.I could surrender now. I paid him back after all. I could give up now. It would be my win in a sense if I surrendered now.Something like: \u201cI\u2019m surrendering now to save your face\u201d.That would be the best way to make him angry.That would be the case.\u201cSurrender? Yeah, won\u2019t happen. I have no intentions of doing that, you bastard.\u201dI wanted to win.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll, win this.\u201dAfter I gave him a kick to his damn jewels. Seeing his face distorted like that.I tasted how sweet revenge was.\u201cYou just managed to get in one cowardly surprise attack, and you think you\u2019re gonna win?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI wanted to win. I wanted to defeat this guy and grant him some behavioral training.I wanted to make that bastard kneel in front of me and apologize.So.I wanted to win.If I were to lose, I would have to kneel before that guy and Art and apologize. Getting beat up was shameful, but having to say that I was wrong when I didn\u2019t even think that what I did was wrong was a lot worse.I didn\u2019t like that at all. I didn\u2019t need some grand reason or convincing probabilities, I just didn\u2019t want to lose. I mean, no one would want that.I had to get beat up by this jerk in this unfair fight and then kneel to him and apologize right after that?I wanted to see that.I wanted to see what that guy, so convinced of his victory, who taunted me, stomped on and kicked me, looked like after he lay defeated in front of me.I wondered what kind of miserable expression he would show me, denying his defeat and showing me an even uglier appearance.I wanted to make this person who made me like this even worse off.Hence.I wanted to win.I desperately wanted to win.The guy came up to me. This raging attack won\u2019t just blow away my sword, it would break everything in my body. If I allowed the next attack to hit, there would be no getting back up from that.There was also a limit to holding out through sheer tenacity.Breaking another training sword would be unlikely, so it would cost more points. Maybe it was impossible even.There would be no way for me to win if I wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand that next blow.\u201cHow the hell do you plan on beating me, huh? Why don\u2019t you show me?\u201dI didn\u2019t have anything like that.Still.I wanted to win anyway. Just because there was no way for me to win, that didn\u2019t mean I was forbidden from wanting to. I couldn\u2019t win, but I still could have the desire to win.I needed to see him lying under my feet no matter what.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThat was when I realized.I thought that I shouldn\u2019t have come because I would lose anyway.I knew I would lose, but I had to fight in the hopes of winning.No, this wasn\u2019t even what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t even close to the thing I wanted.There was no way to win, and yet I wanted to win even in this situation where I had no other choice but to lose, I wanted to grasp victory, and I wanted to be certain of my victory.I now vividly remembered what I had to do.I caught my breath as I watched that guy approaching.\u201cHow the hell are you going to win?\u201dHe was slowly approaching with a sly smile hanging on his lips.How?\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe answer had been decided long ago. I looked at the guy holding his sword.\u201cI\u2019ll win anyway.\u201dI was being stubborn in this situation.I didn\u2019t know how I would win, but I knew that I\u2019d win anyway.This was just a farce.\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201dMayarton seemed to think that I had gone crazy because I was pushed to my limits. That was what the other\u2019s faces also told me.No. That wasn\u2019t it. I realized this by rationally thinking about it, not because I was driven into some extreme state. I just realized how my powers worked.The name of my power was Self-Suggestion, so I had to apply it to myself. I had to believe in it myself.It\u2019s not just about wanting to win.It wasn\u2019t even just a prediction of my own victory.Even with no chance of winning, I had to constantly think that I was going to win.I had to really believe it.That was how it was supposed to be used.That was the power I had. It wasn\u2019t about what one wanted, desired or longed for. There was no reason, cause or basis for it, but you had to blindly believe that it would happen. Whining like a child, insisting like an idiot. Only if I completely and whole-heartedly believed that it was going to happen would my power awaken.If you believed in it well enough, it would happen regardless of the cause or reason. The ability would grant myself power like that.\u201cLook.\u201dThe most powerful supernatural ability that would eventually evolve into\u00a0Word Magic.\u201cI\u2019ll beat you anyway.\u201d[Awakened \u2013 Self-Suggestion]That was my power.\u2013 Boom!After getting closer, as if he couldn\u2019t stand looking at me anymore, he lowered his upper body and rushed towards me.-Bang!\u201cWuark!\u201dI reacted to those movements that I shouldn\u2019t be able to react to and smacked him in the face with my sword.-Thud!Mayarton fell to the same part of the floor where he had started his rush.He was down on the ground.I couldn\u2019t feel the pain and wounds all over my body.I was in an extreme state of exhilaration as I grabbed this shivering bastard\u2019s hair.\u201cKuh\u2026 Urgh\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to get what happened just now. The reactions around us were the same. It would be unbelievable to see the guy who was barely able to move his body properly until just a while ago to suddenly display such power.I grabbed his hair and slammed his head back down on the floor.-Bam!\u201cUrgh!\u201d-Bam!\u201cGaaark!\u201d\u2013 Boom!\u201cKurgh!\u201dMayarton\u2019s body trembled after I hit his head three times against the floor of the gym. Just as Mr. Epinhauser didn\u2019t interfere when I was getting beat up, he didn\u2019t intervene when I was smashing Mayarton\u2019s head against the gym floor. He was just watching. That was some scary level of composure.No one knew what was going on.\u201cSurrender.\u201d\u201cHuh. Hah\u2026. Ho-how\u2026. How\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll lose anyway if you faint. Do you want me to smash in your head until you faint? Fine by me.\u201d-Bang!\u201cKurgh!\u201d-Bang! Bang! Bang!Amidst this complete reversal without rhyme or reason I grabbed Mayarton\u2019s messed up hair again and made him stare straight at me.\u201cI told you.\u201d\u201cUuh\u2026. Urgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cI was going to beat you anyway.\u201dA reality forced to happen.Self-suggestion was that kind of ability. The greater my absurd belief the stronger my power grew.My vague belief in my own victory seemed to be just enough to win against Mayarton. The moment I realized how to use it, I managed to believe in this scenario.Anyway, I was sure I could win.Neither madness, nor cruelty, nor malice, nor joy could be found in his eyes.Those eyes were only filled with fear and incomprehension at this situation.Good.It was good to be an object of fear.It was even better as the one who feared me was the guy who had been holding me down and beating me up until now.\u201cNow, tell me, senior. You\u2019ve been going to Temple two years more than me, you have better physical abilities and your swordsmanship is much better than mine.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help laughing and shouting.\u201cNow how about you try telling the first-year students that you\u2019re a fucking third year, huh!\u201dI could feel the people around me get frightened by my maddened roar.\u201cDon\u2019t want to? Then how about I\u2019ll make you wake up to the infirmary ceiling then?\u201dI lifted his head up high to slam him down against the floor again.\u201cI, I\u2026. I lost.\u201dI was finally able to crush his pride and get him to surrender. Mr. Epinhauser bluntly announced the result.\u201cI declare Reinhardt as the victor.\u201d[Event Quest Complete \u2013 Duel with Art][You have earned 600 achievement points as reward for your victory.]Then.With the announcement of my victory everything went dark before me.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Damn it.I told that guy I would make him see the infirmary\u2019s ceiling, but in the end it was me who woke up to it.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was after Mr. Epinhauser declared my victory, so the results couldn\u2019t have been overturned. This was the infirmary, right? The curtains were drawn so I couldn\u2019t tell if someone was around.Soon, someone opened the curtains and appeared before me.\u201cYou woke up.\u201d\u201cAh, senior.\u201dIt was Adriana. She approached me, put her hand on my forehead and nodded slowly. Did she judge that my condition was okay?\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYou won the duel, junior, but then you suddenly collapsed. This is the dormitory\u2019s recovery room.\u201dRecovery room? Was there such a thing? Was Mayarton also here? As I looked around, Adriana shook her head as if she knew what I was looking for.\u201cThat senior is in another recovery room. I wouldn\u2019t let both of you use the same room.\u201dI did hit his head quite a lot, so he would be in need of recuperation. Adriana sat down on the bed next to me and sighed.\u201cJunior, you knew what I wanted to do, right?\u201dMaybe she was talking about the look she gave me before.\u201cYeah, well\u2026.\u201d\u201cI could have fought for you.\u201dShe was asking me why I still insisted on doing such a reckless thing instead of choosing her.\u201cWere you expecting such nonsense as suddenly awakening your supernatural power at just the right time? Don\u2019t you understand things unless you get beat up?\u201dAdriana seemed angry.By the way, they must have already scanned my body once while I was fainted. So they should already know the reason why I became so strangely powerful was because of my supernatural ability.\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine as long as the results are good?\u201d\u201cNonsense. Of course, I heard about your strange aptitudes, junior, but\u2026. You did something very reckless.\u201dI knew I had a latent supernatural power and realized how to awaken it just then. However, to others this might have seemed like I was hitting my head against the floor to break it.\u201cIf it didn\u2019t go well, wouldn\u2019t it have been even worse than losing?\u201dAdriana didn\u2019t seem to know what to say in response to my reaction as if there was something wrong with that.\u201cJunior, you still have six years to live in Temple. You just started your first year. You were able to awaken a supernatural power through great coincidence this time, but will you continue to do these kinds of reckless things in the future just to turn your other aptitudes into talents?\u201d\u201cNo, not really\u2026.\u201dSupernatural powers were just special cases, and the rest of the talents I wanted I could buy with achievement points, so there wouldn\u2019t be a reason to do these kinds of things anymore.\u2026.\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t do such reckless things anymore. Also don\u2019t be rude to your seniors just because you won that duel.\u201d\u201cIt will probably happen again in the not so far future though\u2026.\u201dI was sure that everyone was wondering if my damn temper would lead me to be cut down this time. Unfortunately for them, I realized how to use my supernatural ability and grabbed the third year senior by his hair and slammed him into the gym floor.So that would mean for them that Reinhardt has only become more insane.\u201cReally now. Then I seriously have to scold this junior of mine. Got that?\u201dAdriana was staring at me terrifyingly. What would happen if this senior scolded me? I didn\u2019t know if that scolding would be in the form of words or in the form of a beating.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try to restrain myself.\u201dAnyway, I didn\u2019t want to be scolded by someone who was so worried about me to the point that she got angry. Just because she got angry with me about something like this didn\u2019t necessarily mean that she hated me.Of course, if I really were to fight the seniors I probably wouldn\u2019t get away with it so easily. Mayarton was off guard as well. If that were a real fight, it would have ended in less than 5 seconds.\u201cBut honestly, I\u2019m grateful.\u201dEven if you\u2019re thought to be crazy by everyone else, you should be nice to the people who would actually stand up for you.Adriana sighed at my words.\u201cI really don\u2019t like juniors who go around fighting all the time. I\u2019d rather have a junior that gets along with everyone.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s that guy in Class B called Ludwig.\u201d\u201cYou know, you\u2019re supposed to be that kind of person, so do you really have to say that?\u201d\u201cI guess I got born into the wrong life then.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so.\u201d-Hits!\u201cOuch!\u201dIn the end, the angry Adriana hit my head.I feel like I could make anyone mad with ease. I think that was my real talent here.***I was treated by the teacher designated to be the nurse in the recovery room. It was only natural that I ended up fainting. I forcibly raised my own strength far exceeding what my original body could handle, so it had reached its limits. Of course, I was able to leave the recovery room pretty quickly as there was no further need for me to recuperate there.Then, to my dismay, I had a consultation with Mr. Epinhauser.\u201c\u2026\u2026Self-Suggestion\u2026.\u201dMr. Epinhauser seemed worried about my supernatural power\u2019s awakening during the duel.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, No. 11. You did say that there had to be an aptitude for supernatural powers among your countless ones, so it should be possible to awaken one. It seems to me that you accepted your senior\u2019s challenge out of necessity\u2026. It\u2019s rather ridiculous, but you turned out to be right.\u201d\u201cActually, I did this because I wanted something else to happen, but it somehow turned out like this.\u201d\u201cLuck is also a talent. Just as the other talented students hadn\u2019t necessarily acquired their power through hard work. I do not know if it was mere luck, but you are not allowed to use your ability to attack someone anymore. Unless it\u2019s in special circumstances like a duel. However your ability isn\u2019t an obvious one. The downside to this is that it is hard to recognize and judge. Of course, it might be advantageous for you though.\u201dDepending on the degree I use my ability at, one might not be able to tell if I strengthened my body or not. It was extremely advantageous for the one who used it, but it was pretty disadvantageous for the teacher who had to make a judgement on it.\u201cI won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\u201cYes, although you seem to be quite violent, I don\u2019t believe you to be an idiot.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was still staring at me with his unflinching gaze.Whenever I met his eyes I always felt like this person\u2019s gaze was utterly terrifying. When he showed me this cold attitude I felt a similar type of fear I felt from Bertus.\u201cMs. Rollendria will be quite surprised to hear about you. You can go.\u201dMs. Rollandira was referring to the teacher in charge of the supernatural power class.She\u2019d definitely be surprised as the one who casually said he\u2019d somehow get a supernatrual ability, actually got one.* * *Reinhardt awakened his supernatural powers during his duel with his senior.That rumor seemed to have already spread throughout the class as well as among the seniors. When a first year and a third year fought against each other in a duel, the first year actually awakened their supernatural ability and beat up his senior.The duel itself probably became the a hot topic around the entire Royal Class before it even started, but now it came out that the first year actually won.It would have been strange if there weren\u2019t any rumors.Still.I didn\u2019t know it would turn out like this..\u201cAre you Reinhardt?\u201d\u201cI heard that duel was no joke?\u201d\u201cMayarton, that bastard, should\u2019ve been beaten some more.\u201d\u201cOh my god. You\u2019re such a little baby! Cute! Can I hug you?\u201dNo, I wasn\u2019t a baby. I was still 17. And no matter how I looked at it, I wasn\u2019t really the cute type, or was I?\u201cShould this sister buy you something delicious? Do you like macaroons?\u201dThe First Year Class A dormitory was currently crowded with seniors who came down after hearing the rumors about me.In a way, this might have been a natural conclusion.In order to defeat a single first year, a third year forced himself into the fight of a second year as his champion.At this point, Mayarton would have already been imprinted as trash in the minds of those who weren\u2019t all that interested in disciplining the juniors. Not all Class A students were strict about traditions and such.As soon as they reached their fourth year, many students turned their attention away from such things. So, many of them were already dissatisfied with Mayarton for trying to beat up a first year.But he even lost.Therefore, those seniors were bound to develop a certain degree of curiosity and favor towards me, to the same degree they disliked Mayarton.Also, although I didn\u2019t make Reinhardt look super handsome, he was still good looking enough.It was understandable that those sisters would go: \u201cYou\u2019re such a cute little baby\u201d.\u201cHow can he be so young and already so righteous? You told your seniors not to bully you and your friends anymore if you won, right?\u201dAs the rumor spread around that I participated in duel I was bound to lose anyway to make the seniors stop harrassing my class, it seemed that I now got known as a righteous guy who fought for his friends.\u201cAh\u2026Uhm\u2026 I did say that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so nice.\u201dOf course, my actual classmates who heard the seniors\u2019 fussing seemed to doubt their ears.The seniors were praising Reinhardt, the crazy dog bastard, as a good and nice guy after all. Their expressions showed that some of them seemed to want to fiercely shout, \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t that kind of guy at all!\u201d\uff0e\u201cIf anyone comes to bother you again after this, tell me. I\u2019ll scold them for you. See? If you have any problem, come straight to the Fifth Year Class A, okay?\u201d-Rumble! Rumble!If she was in the fifth year then she was 21 years old. She was a college student sister.\u2026Of course, I didn\u2019t actually see her as an older sister, she was still just a child as well.She was trying to show off and made a small storm appear in her right hand. What? Why was she doing that?Since they were seniors, their supernatural abilities couldn\u2019t be compared to those of a first year. They told me I should be proud of myself and that there should be more children like me.My classmates, of course, would never agree to anything they said.If there were any more children like me, Temple would get destroyed.Still, if one were to take the rumors at face value, I did seem like just a good little kid.There were also times when some male seniors would pat my head, saying I did a good job, but there were also some female seniors who simply crossed the line.\u201cWhat do I do? I heard you had such a hard life.\u201d\u201cAh, yeah, well\u2026.\u201dShe seemed to have heard about my origins, so a certain senior girl suddenly hugged me tightly, giving me a headache.N, no.Hey!Don\u2019t do this!Although my mind was still the same as it was before, my body was currently a healthy 17 year old!\u201cOh my, good that you were able to get into Temple.\u201dDon\u2019t do this! Th, this wasn\u2019t how this was supposed to go!When they found out that I was actually just a beggar from the streets, they couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how I was able to grow up to be so upright in that kind of environment.The seniors had that huge misunderstanding about me, to the point where I couldn\u2019t do anything about it anymore.Tired.I was really tired.I ended up becoming a star at Temple just because of one duel.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Regardless of the misunderstandings the seniors had about me, the looks the others gave me after they returned were a little different from before.Probably because they knew I awakened my supernatural ability.They might have also felt something from my actions, fighting so hard even though I was put into such a helpless situation by that senior.The people who hated me, Cayer, Erich and Kono Lint, looked at me then went past me with their eyes tightly closed. They felt like they were no match for me, not only in terms of skills, but also in terms of mental strength.It wasn\u2019t because I fought so well, it was because of my mental strength that didn\u2019t allow me to give up no matter how badly I got beaten up. Eventually, they would get more skilled and mentally strong, but right now they were just kids. No wonder I looked weird to them.And.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet de Saint-Owan was looking at me, turned her head and passed by me without giving me a single glance.Well, that certainly wasn\u2019t what I expected\uff0eWouldn\u2019t this have been the perfect time to tell me something like: \u201cYou should have gotten beat up more\u201d?\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cWha, what\uff01\u201dWhen I called out to her, she stopped as if she was waiting for that, and looked at me angrily. I could see that she was blushing.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201dHarriet frowned when I asked her that.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing though? What would I have to say to a bastard like you? Oh, yes, yes. You should have been hit a bunch more, but then you ended up using that supernatural power of yours like a coward just to win.\u201dI got the exact response I wanted to hear.\u201cReally? Weren\u2019t you rather restless when you watched me get beat up though?\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201dHer face got even redder because she didn\u2019t think I was looking at her before.\u201cI saw you stamping your feet with a pale face, you know?\u201dI told her with a grim smile. In fact, she kept looking towards me and Mr. Epinhauser in the hopes that he might stop this fight.I was able to see all that, even while I was getting beat up. To be exact, that was the only thing I could do at that moment.Anyway, I saw her getting more and more restless, wanting Mr. Epinhauser to bring an end to all that, but he didn\u2019t.So there was just one conclusion\uff0e\u201cWere you worried about me? How cute.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not! Never ever, nope! I, I. Wh, why would I, I be wo, wo, worried about the li, likes of you? Hah! Hah! It was so refreshing!\u201dJudging by her red hot face, it seemed like she was absolutely worrying about me. In the end, there was not a single person who wouldn\u2019t feel sympathy if someone got beat up so pitifully.I went up to her and put my hands on her cheeks, squeezing them.The cheeks of that high-and-mighty princess of a Grand Duchy felt like two steamed buns.\u201c!\u201dShe wasn\u2019t even able to scream that was how dumbfounded she was. She didn\u2019t even imagine someone would dare do this to her.\u201cLeeh! Leeh goh! Shto!\u201dIt was really, really cute that she got surprised by me doing something as ridiculous as this. When I let go, this completely red-faced girl started trembling all over her body in total bewilderment.\u201cHo, how dare, dare you touch my body! Someone like you? How absurd. How. How. How could a beggar\u2026. How\u2026.\u201dShe was so angry and embarrassed that she wasn\u2019t even able to scream properly. Her pupils were shaking very strongly, one might think they were affected by an earthquake or something. This time she didn\u2019t seem that angry, she was more dumbfounded and surprised.Not only did I dare touch her precious face, but I even squeezed her cheeks and laughed at her.She was the cutest when she was like this\uff0eIt seemed like she was trying to deny reality. She probably was thinking something like: \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening to me\u201d, or something.\u201cHu, hnnk\u2026\u2026Sobsob\uff01 Sniff\uff01 Knnrk\uff01\u201dHowever\uff0eContrary to my expectations, she started to cry\uff0e\u201cHu, huh\u00b7\u2026\u201dThat wasn\u2019t it.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? You bastard, why are you picking on me? Why do you bully me like this? Stop it! Stop teasing meee!\u201dWha, what do I do\u2026?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Harriet began to cry\uff0eI could deal with bullies, but I came to realize that I had no idea how to handle a crying kid.I brought Harriet, who was crying in the hallway, to the dining hall and handed her some macaroons I had on me.Wha, what\uff0eThe way I try to appease a crying child seemed kind of like something an old man would do, so I felt rather embarrassed.\u201cI won\u2019t eat things you give me! They\u2019re dirty!\u201d\u201cThey aren\u2019t mine, the seniors gave me those, you know?\u201d\u201cYou touched them! So they are dirty! Throw them away, get them away, I won\u2019t eat them!\u201dHarriet was crying bitterly. What should I do, what should I do. This was like a grandfather who teased his grandkids too much because they were just too cute and accidentally made them cry. It was so much fun. Although it is true that I bullied her a bit too much.It was like how old people would pinch a kid\u2019s cheek for just being cute.I was obviously in the wrong. Ah.I was the one at fault here.\u201cCome on\u2026. I\u2019m sorry. Hey? My bad. Okay, I apologized. Don\u2019t cry anymore. Okay?\u201d\u201cShut up! You\u2019re always making fun of me, tease me, and bully me! No one ever did that to me. Not even my father, mother, and older brothers told me things like that, so why are you doing this to me when I didn\u2019t do anything to you?!\u201d-Sobsob!I sighed as I watched Harriet continue to cry.\u201cHey, you made fun of me for being a beggar as well.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a beggar, aren\u2019t you?! So why are you teasing me for calling a beggar, a beggar?!\u201dAh, I shouldn\u2019t poke at her more. If I said something like \u201cI called you an idiot because you\u2019re actually an idiot\u201d it would just make her cry even more, so I kept my mouth shut.Ah, right\uff0eI remembered a different method.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I just teased you for no reason. I told you, you\u2019re cute, right?\u201d\u201cSobsob.\u2026 Sniff\uff1f\u201dI got a reaction from that. She looked at me as if I was talking nonsense\uff0eYes, it was true that she was hard to deal with but she was also pretty cute sometimes.\u201cThink about it. I never called you an asshole or anything, or did I? I just said you were cute. Calling someone cute is a compliment, so how was I teasing you? You called me a beggar, and yet I called you cute. When did I make fun of you? Huh? Wasn\u2019t it you who made fun of me? Is calling you cute, teasing you?\u201d\u201cYou squeezed my cheeks and laughed at me!\u201d\u201cNo, I just thought you\u2019d look cuter if I did that. It was really cute, you know? Huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hiccup!\u201dShe stared at me while hiccupping. She seemed to be deep in thoughts. I wanted to say a few more things as followed:\u201cAren\u2019t you revealing your status just by saying that a low-class kid like me isn\u2019t allow to touch your body? Aren\u2019t we classmates? Huh? I don\u2019t know about after our graduation, but right at this moment we both are simply Temple students. We\u2019re the same, right?\u201dI was about to say that, but that girl was murmuring something. If someone like her told me something like that, she was sure to get into trouble with the teachers.She thought for a while and then stared at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t touch me with those dirty hands again.\u201dThat was what she eventually mumbled quietly. Was she feeling better now?\u201cOkay. My bad. I\u2019m really sorry. Now eat this and let it go. Hm?\u201dHer expression seemed to change a little as I kept the apologies going.A bully who seemed like he\u2019d never apologize for anything, was doing so at the moment, so her attitude seemed to change a little.I mean, if someone like her came out like that, wasn\u2019t apologizing the right thing to do? That\u2019s how I felt at least.\u201cHere, I\u2019ve never tried them, but they should taste good. Eat.\u201dShe seemed to be uncomfortable as I kept pushing the macarons towards her.\u201cAh\u2026. Ah. I don\u2019t\u2026. I don\u2019t want to\u2026. Fine. I\u2019ll eat them! I\u2019m eating them! You are like my grandmother! How annoying!\u201dIn the end, Harriet took the macarons and groaned as if she had no other choice but to eat them.Ah.I really did seem like an old man. What? I wasn\u2019t actually that old, but I really didn\u2019t know any other way to soothe crying children\u2026.So I really was too old!\u201cEarlier\u2026.\u201dAfter eating the macarons, she talked without looking at me.\u201cHuh, earlier?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t it hurt when you got hit?\u201d\u201cIt hurt like hell.\u201dI recovered, but it really hurt horribly. Of course it would hurt if one were to get hit. Why was she asking something like that?\u201cWhy did you continue to fight if it hurt that much? Why didn\u2019t you just surrender? If you weren\u2019t lucky enough to awaken your supernatural powers just then, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to win.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you surrender? You said it hurt.\u201dHarriet didn\u2019t seem to understand why I kept getting up just to get beaten again and again. Of course, I kept fighting because I knew I had supernatural powers.\u201cWell, did you ever feel like you absolutely didn\u2019t want to lose to some kind of bastard even if it killed you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe was that kind of bastard to me.\u201dHe took over someone else\u2019s duel with the excuse of wanting to educate his juniors, and even though his opponent was just a first year, he went on to beat him to a pulp no matter the consequences. It was neither honorable nor admirable.I just didn\u2019t want to lose to that kind of bastard.That was the type of feeling I was going for. It was both similar to the truth and yet slightly different. Harriet pondered for a while, then smirked and spoke up.\u201cYou\u2019re going to die an early death.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not dead yet though.\u201dIt was now time for her to let out a \u201cHmph!\u201d again to my bizarre answer.\u201c\u2026\u2026Actually.\u201dHarriet, who had been munching away on the macarons for some time now, didn\u2019t give me the response I expected.\u201cYou were a litte\u2026.\u201dA little what?\u201cA little\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet, who had been mumbling to herself for a bit, suddenly rose from her seat.\u201cHmph! I don\u2019t know, you idiot!\u201dAnd after adding another \u201cHmph!\u201d to her sentence, she quickly disappeared from my view.Right.Sometimes having such an easy-to-see-through character was good as well.* * *Just because I won that duel, didn\u2019t mean things were over. My supernatural ability was still in its initial stage and I needed to get used to applying it to me. Self-Suggestion was just the starting line, my real goal was Word Magic.So I headed back to the gym. Arriving there, I found the NPCs that usually appeared here. Cliffman and Ellen.I hadn\u2019t spoken to Cliffman yet, but I was familiar with him, because I always met him here in the gym.Ellen was swinging her sword, but stopped when she saw me. I wondered if she had something to say to me, but she just stared at me.Should I brag about my victory? Or should I thank her for offering to be my champion? I was thinking about what I should tell her\u2026.Ellen pointed with her chin to something.It was a basket filled with training swords.\u201cThat\u2019s not how you should fight.\u201dNo.Was she preparing for another lesson?Still, now wasn\u2019t the time to ask to be congratulated on my victory, brag about my supernatural ability or thank her for the training.No matter what happened, she would always stay the same, so my slightly scrambled mind calmed down. I won, but I felt more like I had just reaffirmed that I still had a long way to go.Alright.It was still a long road ahead.I grinned while grabbing a training sword.\u201cHey, it\u2019s going to be different from now on.\u201dLike hell.I got severly beaten up.* * *Monday.I didn\u2019t stop my training.I woke up early and did some strength training with Adriana. She also declared that she would no longer assist me with her divine power anymore as there was no urgency in my strength gain.That was when I realized how nice exercising was with her assistance. I felt like dying.After that, my routine was the same as before. I made some food with Ellen and ate a bit before breakfast, then ate breakfast and went to class.I didn\u2019t get any more divine power recharges, so I didn\u2019t really need to eat that much anymore, but I was exercising quite a bit, so I decided to keep eating a little something in between meals, albeit not as much as before.Ellen was still chasing me around the gym, maybe a bit more than before, while I was a bit more timid in taking my revenge in the dining room.\u201cWow.\u201dBertus, who returned to Temple and went straight to the classroom on Monday, was very surprised when he heard about the duel\u2019s outcome from the other students. The one who explained the whole situation to him was none other than Cayer.\u201cReinhardt, isn\u2019t that incredible?\u201dAs soon as Bertus heard his explanation, he turned to me.\u201cAh, well.\u201d\u201cAlthough it was said that you had infinite aptitudes, for supernatural powers to actually be included in that.\u201dAs if apologizing for underestimating my potential, Bertus smiled softly. Among those who felt rather uncomfortable that I was able to awaken a supernatural power, the one who felt the most uncomfortable was Heinrich von Schwarz, who once threatened to grill me with his power.He was trying hard to not look my way, as if he didn\u2019t acknowledge me, who had awakened a supernatural power in such a ridiculous way.\u201cH, honestly though, he was just quite lucky\u2026.\u201dCayer muttered timidly next to Bertus, but Bertus just dismissed him.\u201cI see? I find it more amazing that he kept on fighting in the state he was in than his supernatural power though.\u201d\u201cI, is that so\u2026.\u201dCayer first told him that I was being crushed thoroughly before suddenly awakening my ability and winning the duel. In the end, he just described me as some lucky guy.However, Bertus seemed to give higher value to the fact that I kept on fighting while being helpless than me winning with my supernatural power.Bertus wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Royal Class\u2019 talents to begin with. Even if they were outstanding, in the end, they were just kids. So, while he was surprised that I managed to awaken my ability, he was actually impressed by the fact that I kept on getting up even though I was completely crushed by that third year again and again.He had more interest in intelligence and mental strength, than talent and brawn.He knew that no matter how great the skill one owned is, it would be useless if one didn\u2019t have the brains to use it, and even if one was intelligent enough, it would be even more useless if one didn\u2019t have the mental fortitude to face the dangers in front of oneself.Wait, wasn\u2019t I getting better and better in his eyes? Erm, one second? Was I getting brainwashed here? Wasn\u2019t it pretty problematic getting this much attention from this two-faced character I made? Wouldn\u2019t I be an actual fool if I got deceived while knowing I he would deceive me?How could I, the creator, get led on by my own creation? Was I that pathetic?Just when I was about to fall into a delirium.-Clatter!Someone opened the door and entered the classroom.It was Art de Gartis, who was the actual other party of the duel.He came to the same place where he applied for this duel, although, this time, as the loser of said duel. Of course, his expression also seemed rather lifeless. Everyone watched the situation in silence as he approached me and bowed his head.\u201cI have lost the duel, so I will admit my faults, Reinhardt. In the future, I will not take any actions that would involve unreasonable demands or verbal abuse towards my juniors. I\u2019m sorry. I deeply regret my wrongdoings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing him apologize, I couldn\u2019t help but feel exasperated.A champion was just a champion after all. The price of losing a duel was not directed at the champion, so there was no need for them to pay said price.That was why Mayarton, who actually trampled on me, didn\u2019t come to apologize to me, because he was just a champion after all.He should have come out of moral reasons, but he didn\u2019t because of his stupid pride. He probably complained to Art about how he had no reason to go. Or maybe he couldn\u2019t even ask him to come.\u201cYeah. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dArt, who raised his head, looked at me and apologized again.His expression held a plethora of very complex emotions.He was forced to choose a champion because he was unable to overcome the pressure of his seniors and then he came here alone without bringing Mayarton with him. He seemed to feel guilty about all these things.Just as Adriana and Redina said, Art wasn\u2019t such a bad guy.From what I could tell, Redina probably was someone who was loved by all her second-year classmates. I could only imagine how hard it must have been for her to be forced by her seniors to go educate the juniors.Obviously, the third years must have ordered her to go alone. They must have chosen Redina on purpose, knowing that she wasn\u2019t able to say any hurtful things to anyone. So this was nothing more than bullying.Eventually, she went to do this alone with sorrow in her heart, having to do something, she absolutely hated, but came back after getting severely insulted by a first year student. I was the one who was so harsh to her.From Art\u2019s point of view, this would have been enough for him to see red. I fully understood. After all, they were just kids. I had already shown plenty of ugly anger and ridicule towards these children, but I didn\u2019t want to stoop to the level of an idiot who would seriously hate those kids. Guys like Mayarton were seriously disgusting, though.Art deserved to be angry.I didn\u2019t really handle this too well, but I wanted to make it up to them somehow. I had done a lot of bad things to them as well after all.\u201cI understand. I\u2019ve done a lot of bad things as well. I\u2019m sorry, senior.\u201dEveryone, including Art, was astonished at my words. Art looked at me for a while, before he opened his mouth with much difficulty.\u201cWhen I saw you persevering like that, I realized how shameful I was.\u201dAn incompetent and ignorant guy like me was able to stand his ground and fought against a senior, while he couldn\u2019t overcome his own senior\u2019s unreasonable demands and had to give up his duel spot to one of them. And in the end, he had to watch me win.Did he realize that it may take power to overcome injustice, but simply standing up to it, didn\u2019t? He seemed to regret not being able to stand up to this injustice in the end.After saying that, Art went back.I felt compelled to apologize to Redina as well later.Not long after, Mr. Epinhauser entered the classroom.\u201cYou all should know that there will be a certain event starting next Monday, right?\u201d-Yes!It had finally come.The main event of the beginning part. The Victory Festival.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52The Victory Festival began after the triumphal army, who returned from their long journey after winning the Demon World War, entered the capital.If they actually marched all the way back from there, it would have taken a lot longer, but the time actually got reduced as they used super-large warp gates located at the outpost on the borders of the Darklands. I was in Temple right now so I wasn\u2019t too sure, but they must be pretty busy preparing for the return of triumphal army.Of course, I didn\u2019t describe every single day of their Academy life in huge detail. If I did, this would be more like a fantasy-style diary. Would that even be a novel then? I roughly wrote down when and what happened, but I mostly just put it as: \u201cEach day passed like a flicker until it was time for the Victory Festival\u201d. That was how I wrote it.Up until now, I lived in these blank times and went through all sorts of events that didn\u2019t happen in my novel, but still existed in this world, so now it was time for the Victory Festival.\u201cOriginally, Temple was supposed to close down for the duration of the Festival, but this is not applicable to you guys. As you know, Temple\u2019s tuition fee is quite high. So, if the school were to close down for more than a month, not only would that disrupt the flow of education, but there would be various complaints from students as well.\u201dDid they think there was a single student who\u2019d hate some vacation time? It was the parents who\u2019d hand their asses to them.If the school, one spent a huge amount of money on, decided to close down for a month, they would have paid that tuition for nothing.And strictly speaking, I was kind of on the side of the parents, so I could sympathize. If Temple just decided to close its doors for a whole month, I\u2019d think they were thieves as well.\u201cSiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh\u2026.\u201dThe kids, especially the ones who liked to play like No. 8 Kono Lint, let out a deep sigh. Regardless whether they were part of Royal Class or not, they were just like any other kid. Everyone would get a little excited when they heard news about the school closing down for a month, so I could see everyone\u2019s mood literally dropping to the floor.Hey, you little bastards. Listen to what people have to say until the end.\u201cNevertheless, the victory in the Demon World War is the most memorable of all events written down in the history of mankind. Therefore, Temple will be closed for about one week, which is already unusual enough.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t give us a month off, but they decided to close Temple for a whole week.\u201cOoooooh!\u201dMr. Epinhauser\u2019s calm words heated up the atmosphere again.Bertus didn\u2019t seem to be so enthused about this. As a member of the Imperial Family, he\u2019d have a lot of work to do during this huge festival serving as a Victory Ceremony. Rather it might be quicker than one might thought though.However, among my classmates, Ellen\u2019s mood seemed rather subdued. She didn\u2019t seem much different from usual, but now after I gained more experience with the stone Buddha, I could somewhat read her current mood.The reason was obvious.To Ellen this Victory Festival would just be something to commemorate the death of her older brother, who eventually died fighting the Demon King.\u201cOoooh, hell yeeeeeaaaaah!\u201dOf course, Kono Lint kicked up a fuss after hearing Mr. Epinhauser\u2019s words. Dismissing that rowdy guy, Mr. Epinhauser delivered an additional message to us.\u201cThat would mean that you have to leave this Friday and come back two weeks later on Monday. If you want to return to your parents\u2019 house, please report to me. I will give you permission.\u201dNo matter how talented they were, there were some among the kids who were actually homesick. Given that it was a nearly 10-day-long break, those that live further away would be able to return home.Some of the children\u2019s eyes lit up at these words.\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. The break will start next week, so please attend class properly.\u201dWhat he meant was: \u201cDon\u2019t think about causing any trouble just because you\u2019re excited\u201d. Everyone would get slightly excited about the prospects of a break. No matter how problematic they were, in the end they were all just children. Looking at them like that, they were all pretty cute.And out of all of them who seemed to be the most problematic?\u201cHe, he, he\u2026.\u201dTen days. I wasn\u2019t going to let anyone keep watching me.I was going to go back to Eleris after such a long time.It had been just too long since I last saw Eleris.I could sympathize with the parents, but right now I was just a student. A break was nice after all.\u201cNumber 11.\u201dThen Mr. Epinhauser called me.\u201cYes?\u201dNow, just by him calling me, I could feel a chill running down my spine. Wha, what else did I do wrong? No, but didn\u2019t he accept my apology?Worrying about what I did wrong before knowing what the teacher actually wanted was a typical problem child\u2019s way of thinking, so I felt pretty pathetic about myself.Yeah well.Wasn\u2019t I more or less already a super-delinquent who even beat his senior in a fight?\u201cYou are excused from class today. Come with me.\u201d\u2026\u2026Did I really cause some trouble?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Fortunately, I didn\u2019t actually cause any trouble.It seemed like I already passed the point of no return when I started worrying about what I might have done wrong without actually remembering having done anything wrong.Mr. Epinhauser took me to the outdoor swimming pool of our class building.\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201dHe sat there with me on a nearby bench and waited, although the teacher didn\u2019t tell me who we were waiting for.There was no water in the outdoor pool. The weather was still too cold after all.Swimming lessons were also part of the P.E. classes, however not until summer.Come to think of it, this set-up was rather weird.If one used a mana stone powered water heating system in an indoor pool, we\u2019d be able to have swimming lessons, even in winter, right? However, here in Temple, which recieved huge amounts of capuital, we still depended on the weather whether we would have swimming lessons or not?This was a set-up hole which stemmed from my weird delusion that swimming lessons were a summer thing in school.\u2026\u2026I should have thought about that a little more. Wouldn\u2019t I end up in a much worse situation, because I set up so many improbable things? I\u2019m an idiot.No, now I got curious again.This was obviously a weird situation. It was clear that mana stone powered water heating systems were a known concept as there were shower facilities in which one could shower with hot water.However, I was stupid and created this bizarre situation of hot showers existing but no indoor pools. This world created some sort of probability for parts I did not include, but this strange part wasn\u2019t corrected. That was because I, the author, explicitly wrote that.I wrote that Temple didn\u2019t have swimming lessons outside of summer, so it was as such.However, this world had the technology to make indoor swimming pools and a way to provide hot water, so one was able to swim in winter.It was already unlikely enough that Temple, which swam in money, didn\u2019t have an indoor swimming pool, but as I, a braindead, second-rate author, wrote it like that, this was now the reality I was confronted with.One could say that it was just a swimming pool so I shouldn\u2019t care, but I was about to go crazy, because I kept on thinking that this unpredictable situation happened because of me. It felt like my dark history was being played out before me in real time.That was what I was curious about.What would otherwise not have been possible had become reality because of my description, but did this situation also get its plausibility supplemented?Did a plausible explanation get added to this highly improbable situation that my setting error created?\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why, but I felt like the teacher might know. Although not enough for the setting to collapse, it was definitely lacking. Was there any convincing reason for this?\u201cIt\u2019s possible to take hot showers in Temple, so wouldn\u2019t it be possible to have swimming lessons in winter if we build an indoor pool and fill it with hot water?\u201dWere there any other writers who\u2019d asked their own characters about their own novel\u2019s settings like this?No matter how hard I thought about it, this was just completely different from your usual \u2018Getting Transported into your own Novel\u2019 kind of deal. Usually, the main characters in these types of stories were the writers of the novel they got transported into and they were able to remember every detail of their own settings or they were readers who read the novel and knew absolutely everything about the book.While I got sent into that novel I only vaguely wrote, and rather than knowing everything, I, the writer, went in with nearly no knowledge. Among the things I should know were even a lot of things I didn\u2019t even remember.Knowing the future in a slice-of-life novel had no merit whatsoever, in the first place! What was the point of knowing what Ludwig and Delphine Izadra chatted about over dinner? Then they got all excited, gathered all their friends and had a snack party. How could I even use that?!There weren\u2019t that many military incidents in a slice-of-life, so even if the writer entered, there wasn\u2019t much he could do\u2026. Of course, I knew about the gates, but that was a rather disgraceful thing to remember.So, for the parts that were not described, rather than the creator just knowing, it would be faster to ask one of their creations about the situation unfolding before them.As soon as I arrived at the main stage, the Capital, I wondered just where the hell I landed. I couldn\u2019t even recognize a lot of things that appeared because of my writing.Phew.If the creation myth was true, God might have watched the humans making airplanes, wondering what they were supposed to be. He might have thought something like: \u201cWhat the hell? You\u2019re not made to fly!\u201d. This was already far beyond the scope of my imagination.Anyway.\u201cI suppose so.\u201dThe teacher answered that the possibility of a heated pool existing was there.\u201cBut why don\u2019t we have one here?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like Temple had no money and having one wouldn\u2019t be disadvantageous. Mr. Epinhauser just stared at me. What was the matter? Why was he staring at me like that?\u201cTemple\u2019s water supply is incomparable even to other cities. However, maintaining a large swimming pool all year round at every single educational facility would be rather costly. There\u2019s also the issue with the water use itself.\u201dSo the reason was made out to be a problem with the water supply, huh? Obviously, installing and maintaining indoor pools in all of Temple\u2019s many schools would cost a lot of money..I wondered if only the Royal Class could maybe have an indoor pool, but it didn\u2019t seem to have been implemented.\u201cSo, Temple\u2019s swimming pools do not draw water from said water supply, but use rainwater collected in summer, a time when it rains frequently. Magic is used to purify the water.\u201dSwimming lessons were held in summer because of the lacking water supply, not because of the weather or temperature. Perhaps there was a water reservoir designated to collect rainwater for the swimming pools. It probably didn\u2019t directly get collected in the outdoor swimming pool.I hadn\u2019t set up where the water supply was supposed to be or from which source it drew water, but I thought it was taken from the Irine river, in other words, from the Han River. It would be possible to maintain a swimming pool with that water.However, I had a feeling that there would be water usage problems. There were several schools at Temple and if they all kept on changing the pools\u2019 water, other places might just get a few drops. It wasn\u2019t about the total amount of water available, but the usage of said water.Anyway, although the Capital was similar to Seoul, it didn\u2019t have its water supply facilities.There would also be huge costs to use that gigantic amount of water. It wasn\u2019t like we could draw the water directly from the river, after all.It was also unreasonable to create water using ice or water magic. The amount they had to summon would be enormous.Anyway, they just used rainwater. To purify it they either used magic tools or purification magic.\u201cThen why don\u2019t we keep on purifying the water even in winter?\u201d\u201cNo matter how much one were to use purification magic on it, if you were to swim in the same water all year round, you wouldn\u2019t want to step into that water anymore.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dYeah, that was true. Regardless of whether it was harmless or not, it would be rather disgusting. So, in the end, it was possible to heat up the water with mana stones, but the reason for not having swimming lessons in winter wasn\u2019t about the fact that it was cold, but that it didn\u2019t rain. And indoor pools didn\u2019t exist, because they could gather a bit more rain water with outdoor ones to save money. If it didn\u2019t rain, the pool couldn\u2019t be filled with water, so we had to use the water from the water supply. Mr. Epinhauser said that process would be expensive, but he didn\u2019t say it was impossible to operate such a swimming pool with the Imperial Capital\u2019s water supply.One way or another, the amount of water used was a problem and Temple was looking to save their money.Anyway.There definitely was a reason for every strange thing I set up.Who was it? Who was the guy who worked his brain instead of me? It made me want to go to that person and bow to them.\u201cWhy are you curious about that?\u201dMr. Epinhauser posed a question back at me, as if he didn\u2019t understand my sudden curiosity.I just wanted to verify how that person cleaned my ass for me.I couldn\u2019t possibly tell him that.\u201cAh, well\u2026. I was just curious. Why was the swimming pool outside? Why couldn\u2019t we have swimming lessons in winter? That kind of stuff.\u201d\u201cDo you want to have swimming lessons in the winter, is that why?\u201d\u201cWhat? Ah, sure\u2026. That would be good.\u201dWhy were you asking me that, dude? Mr Epinhauser looked at me silently, then turned his head.\u201c\u2026Yes, you don\u2019t seem to have any impure intentions.\u201d\u201c\u2026Impure intentions?\u201dWhy would I have impure intentions asking for swimming lessons to be held in the winter?Ah.No way.\u201cTeacher, did you think I was asking something like that because I wanted to see my female classmates in their swimsuits?\u201dYou punk. That was 100% what he thought.When he was staring at me earlier, he probably wanted to check if my eyes held any sort of lust in them. He let it go because that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Mr. Epinhauser avoided my gaze at my straight forward remark.Was that guy flustered right now?\u201cTeacher, I admit that I\u2019m a problem child, but I\u2019m definitely not that kind of guy. I\u2019m as innocent as can be.\u201dOkay!I\u2019m from a completely different race! I like women like Eleris! Yeah!No. Wouldn\u2019t that actually be even more problematic in this worldview. If demons and among them the undead were my preference, wouldn\u2019t I get hanged or something, no matter how much they are similar to humans. Would I be a necrophiliac then? But I was a demon as well, so there was no problem with that, right?Weren\u2019t the undead also demons?Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t even know where the demons originated from.\u201cThe moment I cast such doubt on a student, I as a teacher would be more\u2026. Ehem.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDo you know what your eyes look like, you punk?I was only thinking about a set-up error!\u2026The moment I decided on that setting I probably thought something like\u201cSwimming has to be done in summer\u2605!\u201d Or something like that\u2026. I knew that I wasn\u2019t exactly a clean guy. But I wasn\u2019t thinking about that! At least not now!Mr. Epinhauser didn\u2019t even directly respond to my words, as if he had nothing to say about this.He still had his poker face on, but his internal embarrassment was apparent. Yes, he was human too, after all.He had to be human.\u201cWell, she\u2019s here. Listen well to the class.\u201dAfter seeing someone coming from afar, Mr. Epinhauser fled from this place. It felt like he was actually running away. Did that punk really do that?Still, seeing Mr. Epinhauser panic like that made me feel content. He wasn\u2019t such a scary person after all..\u2026\u2026I knew, because I set up his character like that in the first place, but it was kind of funny poking at that person and see them embarrassed. I also knew that he wasn\u2019t a really bad person.By the way, what did he mean with: \u201clisten well to the class\u201d?What kind of class was this, for me to have to skip all of Monday\u2019s classes?When I saw the person who was approaching me, I instantly knew what kind of class it would be.It was a teacher in charge of the supernatural power classes of the first years in Royal Class.The same person that asked me why I was taking supernatural power classes even though I had no supernatural power.It was Ms. Rollendria.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53At the outdoor pool, Ms. Rollendria couldn\u2019t hide her surprise when she saw me there.\u201cThis is the first time I have ever experienced something like that.\u201d\u201cThis would be my first time as well.\u201dIf not, I would have had to have awakened a supernatural power twice in my life. At my remark, Ms. Rollendria sighed.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the boy that came to my class with no talent at all awakened a supernatural ability in a matter of weeks\u2026.\u201dOf course, considering that such cases were rather rare, this was quite the bizarre situation. The guy who tried to take every lesson actually managed to get something out of it. That teacher probably thought I\u2019d end up failing.\u201cToday is more like an inspection than a lecture, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cInspection?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSupernatural powers were handled with great care. Since it was a type of power that science couldn\u2019t properly grasp yet, I would have to go through a certain process to get my abilities accurately judged. Those whose abilities were too overwhelmingly dangerous or uncontrollable are sometimes secretly disposed of.So, although I figured out how to use this supernatural power that I awakened yesterday, Temple needed to know specifically what kind of power I held, so that they could decide whether they could keep me here or not.They left me alone on Sunday, but as soon as Monday\u2019s regular classes started, they exempt me from them.They urgently needed to judge my abilities. I wouldn\u2019t be able to return to class before it wasn\u2019t fully determined that I could control my supernatural powers and what kind of power it was.My Self-Suggestion wasn\u2019t really a dangerous power at this stage.While I was passed out, they probably checked my physical condition, and as a result, they found out that I awakened a supernatural power.A supernatural power with the name Self-Suggestion.If the name of my ability was something like World Destruction, they probably wouldn\u2019t think twice about what to do with me.Anyway, it wasn\u2019t like I had that supernatural power, so it should be alright.Ms. Rollendria was sitting next to me, reading the report on my ability. She must have already figured out what kind of ability it was.The reason why they decided to use the outdoor swimming pool as the test site was probably because there were few people here and a spacious area was needed.\u201cAccording to the report, in a duel with an upperclassman named Mayarton, your physical abilities seemed to have suddenly risen dramatically after struggling for a while. Correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMr. Epinhauser probably wrote that report. He would have been able to give the most accurate recount of the duel.\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d\u201cAt first I felt completely exhausted and I couldn\u2019t even move properly because of all the pain. Then I suddenly felt like my body was filled with strength again and I was able to see Mayarton\u2019s movements that I shouldn\u2019t be able to see. And with it came the physical abilities to counter his attacks.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. Okay. However, if that\u2019s how it happened, then why is it called \u2018Self-Suggestion\u2019 when what you felt is \u2018Body Strengthening\u2019\u2026\u2026? Maybe what you said during the duel was the trigger.\u201dMr. Epinhauser\u2019s report was very detailed. He must have included the words I said as well.I\u2019m going to beat you anyway.There was no reason to hide my abilities anyway. If my supernatural power was written as Word Magic, maybe, but not at its current stage. It was only similar to body strengthening.\u201cI was placed in a pretty unfair situation, and as it is written there, I was helplessly getting beat up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dMs. Rollendria nodded her head as she had already confirmed my statement by reading through the duel report.\u201cI was really angry and resentful, so I thought I wanted to absolutely win. It even went beyond the level of just wanting to. I suddenly though I\u2019d obviously win.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dMs. Rollendria tilted her head as if wondering what I meant by that. It wasn\u2019t that I simply wanted to win in a situation where I practically already lost, but that I was completely convinced that I was going to win.Of course, I was under extreme psychological pressure, but I even realized how to use my ability. However, the teacher probably wouldn\u2019t understand the meaning of those words.Let\u2019s change the wording a bit.\u201cI thought that I, of course, had to win. I couldn\u2019t just lose to a guy like that. So that piece of trash would never be able to beat me. I would absolutely win. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201dAnyway, I won.I just couldn\u2019t lose to someone like that. That\u2019s what I told her. I simply believed that it just shouldn\u2019t be like that.\u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dTeacher Rollendria didn\u2019t seem to understand.I couldn\u2019t afford to lose to that guy.I believed so strongly that I wouldn\u2019t lose that eventually my ability, Self-Suggestion, awakened. It was an ability that somewhat worked like hypnotizing myself.I would win for sure.It was a power that would only activate if one absolutely believed in something.\u201cYeah, well, no one is too sure why supernatural abilities appear, neither its process nor its reason for awakening, so this might have been the trigger in your case.\u201dSupernatural powers couldn\u2019t be explained. That also gave me an advantage.Because of that one sentence, no matter how one awakened their abilities, it could be explained away. It would be suspicious if I were suddenly able to use high-level magic. I had never learned anything about it, so I shouldn\u2019t have had any knowledge about it.However, it was possible for me to suddenly be able to use supernatural abilities. It was a power with unknown principles after all.That was why, even if Ms. Rollendria found it strange, she wouldn\u2019t find me suspicious. There was also the premise of my \u2018infinite aptitudes\u2019. That was enough to justify most powers I might obtain.\u201cThen\u2026. Self-suggestion could be judged to be a kind of power that strengthens one\u2019s body under the premise that one alludes oneself to have that power. That should be it.\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026. I think so.\u201dI shouldn\u2019t have much knowledge about my own ability yet, so I only answered vaguely.\u201cHowever\u2026. It really is a very unique supernatural power. It\u2019s not intuitive at all.\u201dIt really wasn\u2019t. Supernatural powers like Fire, Electricity, Teleportation and Telepathy were intuitive, because they were abilities that could be described in a single sentence.Self-Suggestion on the other hand was a bizarre ability one couldn\u2019t judge the limits of. That was why I didn\u2019t actually include it in the novel. It was such a pain to have a vague ability like that on someone who wasn\u2019t even the main character.\u201cSo the first manifestation was physical reinforcement, but it might not end there.\u00a0 Let\u2019s say you were to strongly suggest something to yourself and you completely believed in it, your powers would manifest.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s say you strongly believe that your own body becomes water. Would you become water then?\u201dNo, is that woman crazy?Regardless of whether that was possible or not, what if something happened to me in that state?!\u201cTeacher, if I really became water, there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t be able to turn back. In that case, would that count as suicide or murder?\u201dThe teacher jumped at my specific question.\u201cIt was just a hypothetical. I didn\u2019t tell you to actually do, you punk.\u201dMs. Rollendria more or less told me not to misunderstand, and fell back into her thoughts again. Initially, the curriculum of the supernatural power classes included controlling, developing and enhancing supernatural powers. However, because the teacher didn\u2019t exactly know how to test my powers, she was having some difficulties as well.As she pondered, her expression eventually hardened.\u201cReinhardt, your powers might be very dangerous.\u201dWhat?\u201cIf what you absolutely believe in became realtiy, even if it only applied to yourself, wouldn\u2019t it be very dangerous?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026?\u201dIt was true that it would become rather dangerous later, but right now I wouldn\u2019t say this power held that much danger.\u201cIf you believe yourself to be god, you might actually become god, right?\u201dShit.She was damn creative.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna happen though\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026. We don\u2019t know the limits of your ability yet\u2026.\u201dI knew that it wasn\u2019t such a crazy ability.\u201cHmm\u2026. Hmmmm\u2026.\u201dHowever, Ms. Rollendria began to deeply ponder about what could happen if my vague ability were abused.This was a pretty weird situation, but that misunderstanding was actually pretty dangerous for me.Even if it only applied to myself, if all the beliefs I held about myself became true, it might appear that my ability wasn\u2019t any different from World Destruction.Apart from its actual practical use, this line of thinking was indeed pretty logical making my ability seem dangerous.\u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t think that my power would be capable of something as crazy as that. In the first place I\u2019m not that delusional. How could I end up believing that I\u2019m god?\u201dNo.Not believing that would actually be weirder, wouldn\u2019t it?I was this whole world\u2019s creator.I wasn\u2019t a god, but something even above a god.I even named this place\u2019s gods, ya hear?This wasn\u2019t about believing it or not, it was actually true.Before Ms. Rollendria it would be the same though, whether I believed to be a god or the creator. But I actually was the creator! However, this world\u2019s creator was a pathetic one! So even if I used my ability, nothing would change!Creator\u2019s special ability) Dying from too high blood pressure after reading malicious comments.Could one find an even more absurd situation than this?Ms. Rollendria wrinkled her forehead hearing my defense that I wasn\u2019t a megalomaniac.\u201cWe, well, your already past that age, so it should be fine\u2026.\u201dWhat age? What did she mean?\u201cWell, you know? Sometimes there are some second year middle school kids who believe they are gods\u2026. Seriously\u2026.. And if it isn\u2019t gods it\u2019s some great evil beings\u2026.There was one who thought he was a dragon who lost his memories\u2026. It\u2019s surprisingly common.\u201dAh.She was talking about the 8th\u00a0grade syndrome!\u201cThere are some teenagers who have these kinds of believes, but\u2026. If someone with your ability came to really believe in such things\u2026. Maybe that would cause a different set of problems\u2026. Something like that.\u201dMs. Rollendria was imagning that the world might collapse if I were to ever be affected by the 8th\u00a0grade syndrome.Actually, when I was in my second year of middle school, I had a pretty bad case of it, but not anymore! Seriously!I did give myself nicknames like envoy of something, something, but that was in the past! I didn\u2019t do these kinds of things anymore!From your point of view, I might just have graduated from middle school, but it\u2019s been more than 20 years since I sat foot in it!I suddenly remembered part of my black history, which made me cringe.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *So even in this world, in this place so similar to Seoul, existed this thing called 8th\u00a0grade syndrome. Ms. Rollendria said that there were kids like that, but they were different from me.No, but I was actually a god. Even if I \u201cbelieved\u201d to be a god, nothing would happen. I would just stay the same as before.Eventually, she started the actual testing. About the limits of my ability.We climbed down the ladder to the pool. The pool was about 2.5 meters deep.-Tak!As soon as Ms. Rollendria moved her finger, a stone the size of a baseball was summoned out of thin air. It was only natural that Ms. Rollendira, who had to be able to stop supernatural power users when their power went out of control, was a high-ranking wizard.\u201cNow, this is a stone.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a stone.\u201dWhat was she trying to achieve by showing me that big stone?\u201cTry to self-suggest yourself that you\u2019re able to crush this stone with your hand.\u201dWell.Crushing a stone with my hand.\u201cAt times like these wouldn\u2019t we start with something like an apple and then slowly up the difficulty?\u201dRight. One should first start with something easy before moving on to something harder.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t play with your food, you know?\u201dThe teacher just bluntly cut me off and that she wouldn\u2019t accept any excuses. Anyway, I just grabbed the stone.Believe it.My grip is strong enough to crush rocks.I sincerely believe that I can do that.Ms. Rollendria looked at me with intrigue.\u201cHuup!\u201dNothing happened.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Supernatural powers didn\u2019t have that good of a performance in its lower levels. That was why Heinrich\u2019s Pyrokinesis was the way it is.When it just awakened it was in a type of berserk state, so it exerted a lot of power, but now that it was in a stable state, it didn\u2019t really do much.\u201cDid you feel your grip becoming stronger?\u201d\u201cI think so. My palms are tingling.\u201dIn fact, I clearly felt that my grip strength itself increased. If I just tried to crush it with my will power alone, my palms wouldn\u2019t hurt to the point that I was about to faint.\u201cWell, then try to run to the other end of the swimming pool. Run at full speed.\u201d\u201cEh.\u201dPerhaps because it was determined that my power could enhance my physical capabilities, we ended up doing something that wasn\u2019t that different from physical training. Because I did a lot of training anyway, my reluctance to do these kinds of exercises was seriously reduced.I sprinted from one end of the pool to the other. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t really get tired by this much anymore.The teacher seemed to check something, then shouted towards me.\u201cNow! This time, sprint back here. But use your power this time! Try to convince yourself that you\u2019re the fastest runner there is!\u201dShe was measuring my running speed.Once without me using my ability and then once more with me using my ability.After I got ready, I tried to convince myself.I\u2019m Usain Bolt.After I finished sprinting about 50 meters again, the teacher slowly nodded her head.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Reinhardt.\u201dDid something change? I felt like my grip power got stronger, but I had no idea about my speed.\u201cBefore using your ability, you took 8.3 second, after using it, it took you\u00a0exactly 8 seconds.\u201d\u201c\u2026I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201dI knew it was a little quicker, but did this actually have any meaningful effect? That might have been within the margin of error.After that, the teacher gave me various other tests. They were mainly tests pertaining to my physical strength, endurance and agility.And as I went through these, my mental state seemed to get more and more strange.Self-Suggestion made the suggestions you had made to yourself become reality.If I said that I was Usain Bolt while running, I\u2019d actually be able to use his speed or more if my ability was at a certain level.\u00a0 On the premise that I absolutely believed in my words.So, in the end, I had to keep thinking \u201cI\u2019m XX, I\u2019m XX\u201d.Yes, I felt like I was transported back to my childhood.This supernatural power which made childish stubborn persistence reality, and the more stubborn I was the better my ability would work.So\u2026.Rather than Self-Suggestion wasn\u2019t this more like a winning mentality or something?In fact, it did become true that I would have won anyway in the duel with Mayarton.So did that mean that I\u2019d win as long as I held a winning mentality?Regardless of my ability\u2019s efficiency, I was still pathetic.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Reinhardt?\u201d\u201cWell, I was seriously thinking that I could break this tree if I punched it, so I\u2019m a little\u2026 How should I put it? It\u2019s getting a little hard to bear.\u201dLolol My fists can break down trees lolol look, look.That\u2019s how it should be! But it\u2019s not happening! How could that be!Perhaps because I discarded this setting, I didn\u2019t really think about what kind of mental damage the person who actually used this ability would receive.I actually used that kind of skill.It was really pathetic.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of ability you have. Come on, try it.\u201dAnyway.I can crush this tree with my fists!-Bam!\u201cUwaark!\u201dI made a mistake.I should have believed that I wouldn\u2019t break my wrist if I were to hit a tree like that full swing.* * *Ms. Rollendria tested my ability all day long. In addition to testing my physical strength and athletic abilities, she also conducted other tests.For example, we tested if I could derive other abilities from my ability.If I believed that I could use elemental supernatural powers, including Pyrokinesis, she wondered if I could really use them. We also tried Telepathy.Of course, it didn\u2019t work at all. I didn\u2019t know if I could do it later, but as of now, the level of my ability was very low, so other than strengthening my body I couldn\u2019t do anything else.Of course, since I always carried the Flame of Tuesday around with me, fire might actually come out, so I did the Pyrokinesis test a bit sloppily.After all the tests were done, Ms. Rollendria slowly nodded her head as she took notes. We took until lunch, so this skill test really lasted throughout nearly all the classes.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that great\u2026.\u201dObviously, it wasn\u2019t actually as strong as I thought it would be, but Ms. Rollendria shook her head.\u201cObviously, the power displayed in its current state isn\u2019t very significant. But what is important is another aspect.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? What other aspect?\u201d\u201cThe degree of body reinforcement is rather weak, but you\u2019re actually pretty proficient in using your supernatural ability. From my point of view, although the level of your enhancement is still rather low, you are able to use your ability successfully multiple times in a row. Almost instantly.\u201dIt seemed like Ms. Rollendria was more focused on my control on the ability rather than the ability itself. Even if the strengthening effect was pretty insignificant, it seemed that I still succeeded in activating it continuously.\u201cThat means that you are quite familiar with activating your ability before you had it.\u201dThat surely would be considered great. Ability control was sometimes considered more important than the ability itself. I was already very good at using this ability of mine.I should like that, but I didn\u2019t feel so good about that.\u201cIn other words, you are very gifted in self-suggestion.\u201dSo all she was saying was that I had a great winning mentality!Yeah, that\u2019s it, anyway. As I wrote shitty novels like this, of course, I would have a great winning mentality to keep being a writer.I got this ability because it was basically a cheat, but also because it suited me well.The level of my ability wasn\u2019t that high. However, activating it was quite easy for me.I already had the mentality fitting for that flimsy ability called Self-Suggestion, because I lived my life completely reliant on that type of mentality.It was like it was custom made for me\u2026. That didn\u2019t make me happy.Anyway, I was almost able to convince myself that, if it was someone else who had this ability, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use it as skillfully as I did.Of course, since this is a fantasy world, I had an easier time believing that something would definitely happen. If I were in my old world, I\u2019d probably be like \u201eSupernatural powers? You crazy?\u201d. So, as it was that kind of world, I could readily believe in certain things.Ms. Rollendria said that we were done with the tests and that I could go back to my regular classes the next day, as she realized that my abilities weren\u2019t capable of anything more than simple body strengthening for now. Of course, since its potential was tremendous, she would periodically check on my condition.After class, I stayed in the dormitory for today. I was going to skip my evening training and focus on developing my ability.At this stage, Self-Suggestion mainly had effects related to body strengthening. However, as I scrapped it after vaguely setting it up in the novel, I didn\u2019t really describe what difficulties the person using it would go through.In other words, there were a lot of things I didn\u2019t know about this ability. For example, the mental damage one had to suffer for always keeping up that winning mentality. I\u2019d feel pathetic all on my own for seriously believing that some nonsensical situation would actually happen just because of the ability\u2019s effect.There was one more thing.If I believed that my punches were strong, they would be strong, however what if I get into a fight while believing my punches were strong, but I had to actually kick someone?I would have to convince myself again that my kicks were the strongest.I was proficient in activating it, but it was rather cumbersome. It would be more versatile to believe that my whole body became strengthened.So, for example, I needed to generalize the way I used my ability a bit more to make it useful in a fight. Rather than focusing on punches and kicks separately, I needed to believe that my overall fighting capabilities were greatly improved.Hearing that faith made me stronger, would make one believe that I was a paladin, but that wasn\u2019t it, okay?The god and religion I believed in was myself after all.It was an unorthodox religion were the object of worship and the worshipper happened to be one and the same.That was the religion I had to believe in.I think I\u2019m going crazy.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *For now I could only strengthen my physical abilities a bit, but later, other actions going beyond that would become possible for me. It would be such a waste of time to apply the skill in such detail for each and every part.Therefore, I should use it in a more comprehensive way and not just strengthen my punches or speed up my legs etc.This required selection and focus however. If I used my ability to strengthen my whole body, it would become less effective than just strengthening my punches. So, rather than being too broad in what to strengthen, it would be better to be a little more specific, such as my body being familiar with hand-to-hand combat.After my ability became stronger, it would be possible for my body to become proficient in anti-magic warfare or close quarter combat.Ultimately, this ability was well suited for me.I was a web novel author, and this action was no different from writing up character sheets in the end.I wrote something down in my notebook at the moment.Type ASetting: Overall muscle strength improvement, swordsmanship level improvement. Improve cognitive ability, improve reaction speed.I knew best that this was a necessary step. After setting up a Type A I also set up a Type B according to my own standards. So now if I thought about becoming Type A, not about which part to strengthen, my whole body would get strengthened as I should be able to remember the settings I set up myself. Self-Suggestion was literally the ability to become what I thought I was. If I memorized all the physical capabilities Type A should have, I would have these capabilities if I thought that I became Type A. That was the easiest way to use my ability.Later, I\u2019d obviously add Type Z: Can summon a Black Flame Dragon from right hand.I was going crazy!I didn\u2019t even use that kind of setting when I was in middle school! However, after I grew older and left school, I actually ended up making that kind of setting lol.I felt like dying.I should think that things were good, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Even though I should be the most mature among all the kids, I turned into the most problematic one, and now I locked myself in my dorm room writing up weird settings.There was also my personality, but this ability gave me the final hit.Just\u2026. What is life?.While I was immersed in my self-reflection, the pager in my room suddenly rang.-Brrring!A pager.One could think of it as some sort of magic intercom. Someone was calling me. Who\u2019d be calling me? I first thought it was Ellen, but Ellen wouldn\u2019t call me just because I wasn\u2019t in the gym today.I turned on the pager. The voice was familiar and yet its tone felt wildly unfamiliar.[Come to the main lobby]It was Charlotte.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55When I came to the main lobby, Charlotte was beckoning me to follow her, then we headed somewhere. Evening had already passed, so it was night. There were no students on the streets of Temple. There were no other dormitories around the Royal Class\u2019, so it was quiet.What would Bertus say if he saw me with Charlotte, I wondered. Nothing good, that was for sure. However, I had to be more wary of Charlotte, at the moment, so I couldn\u2019t ignore her words.Perhaps having understood my worries, Charlotte sat down on a dimly lit bench between two street lamps.It was obvious what this was going to be about. She was going to ask me how the search for Valier was progressing.I looked at Charlotte sitting on the bench. She didn\u2019t look at me and was just blankly staring towards the lamp post. I couldn\u2019t see her face well as it was pretty dark, but as always she gave off a calm and cold aura.It was completely different from Adriana. She was calm but gentle.Charlotte was calm but extremely cold. Her classmates would have a hard time with her, although she probably didn\u2019t show them this side of her.Both Bertus and Charlotte had one thing in common: They hid their true selves.\u201cHow does it feel to suddenly have a supernatural ability?\u201dAs if beating around the bush, Charlotte asked me that, out of the blue.\u201cGood\u2026. I guess?\u201dBecause I started with nothing after all.\u201c\u2026\u2026Really?\u201dCharlotte was speaking in an uncertain manner. What kind of power did Charlotte hold? If it was true that Charlotte held some supernatural ability, it seemed like she didn\u2019t like her own power that much.\u201cI heard, it\u2019s called Self-Suggestion.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of ability that activates when you strongly believe in something.\u201dShe was different from the ordinary students. Charlotte already knew how my supernatural ability operated. Well the abilities of the students, except for Charlotte\u2019s, weren\u2019t kept secret. It might just be something anyone had access to.\u201cIs it safe to assume that there was no progress in the search for the boy?\u201dFinding a Mr. Kim in Seoul is extremely difficult even if that Mr. Kim actually existed. It was a bit hasty to ask if there was any progress when she commissioned for this search not too long ago.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m trying.\u201dOf course, I wasn\u2019t trying at all. There was no reason for me to.\u201cYes, it would be impatient of me to assume there was already some progress. However, do keep in mind that if you don\u2019t produce any results, there is no reason for me to leave a useless criminal organization who would only bring harm to the Empire alone.\u201dCharlotte said that as if she was trying to remind me that the countdown had already begun.My plan was to slowly report on my progress to extend my life.However, there were a lot of problems with that.In fact, no matter how hard we were trying to look for the Valier she was looking for, we wouldn\u2019t get any results, but if we were to \u201cfind\u201d a trace, what would it be and how should we answer the question of how we found it? It was the Prince and Princess who were looking for Valier after all.If they couldn\u2019t find him with the traces I gave them, they would be suspicious of me, no doubt. Even if beggars knew beggars best, they would still carry out their own search in secret.So it was best to do just a little bit of work, but I hadn\u2019t yet decided how to display it to her.Charlotte hadn\u2019t gotten to the point where she would urge me yet. That should have given me some time.Well, it seemed like Charlotte had some more business with me other than checking for progress.\u201cYou, try it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you believe that you know where the child is, you might find out where he is.\u201dOh, that was what she was going for.Charlotte seemed to put some hope into my vague supernatural ability. Actually, my Self-Suggestion didn\u2019t have this kind of function. At its present level, I could strengthen my body, at best. There was no way I could acquire some unknown knowledge with it.That would be absurd. If one were absolutely sure to know what one\u2019s neighbor was doing next door, that wouldn\u2019t mean it would pop into one\u2019s mind like a vision.Of course, there were some parts of Self-Suggestion that even I didn\u2019t know about yet, so it might be possible at a later stage.I obviously should say no to her request.However, seeing Charlotte trying to grab at straws, I changed my mind.This.If I play my cards right, I might be able to extend mine and the gang\u2019s life. Rather, if I use my power as an excuse this just might be possible. Clues found by the gang or the Thieves\u2019 Guild might not be able to convince them, but if they were actually found through my supernatural power, they should have no doubt about them.And I was that Valier person Charlotte was looking for.Also, my power is quite the ridiculous one.It was something that made the impossible possible..\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. It probably won\u2019t work, but\u2026. I can try.\u201dCharlotte didn\u2019t look too expectant either.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you, need this?\u201dHowever, as if she wanted to do this properly at least, she took out the portrait of Valier and handed it over to me.\u2026\u2026I couldn\u2019t believe that she would carry around that painting with her. Guilt crept into my mind. The thought that running away would be the best option here never left my head. Every time I saw Charlotte valuing me so much, I felt depressed.Damn it.But I had to deceive this kid again. No matter how difficult the lives of the gang members and Loyar were.I had to deceive this kid again.I intently stared at my portrait. This was absolutely useless, actually.To activate Self-Suggestion I had to absolutely believe that I knew where that boy was.But I didn\u2019t really have to believe that, I knew he was right next to her.It wasn\u2019t a matter of belief. If I didn\u2019t know where I was located, that would be a problem on its own!Anyway.It was impossible for me to track someone else\u2019s location with my skill, but I somehow had to act as if I knew where Valier was. I thought about what excuse I should make up.\u201cHmmm\u2026. Well, I can see a castle.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI began to explain what I went through with Charlotte.\u201cCastle. What castle?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s desolate\u2026. There\u2019s this huge castle and the scene in front of it is\u2026 someone Riding a horse\u2026 I think\u2026.\u201dInstead of exactly knowing where the kid was, I tried to explain it similar to someone with psychometry.Charlotte didn\u2019t explain to me who the child she was looking for was. However, if I explained Valier\u2019s and Dyrus\u2019 escape from the Demon King\u2019s Castle, she\u2019d be able to see that my ability had potential.If I continued to prove my worth to Charlotte like this, she\u2019d leave me alone.Charlotte opened her mouth blankly, astonished that I knew about facts I shouldn\u2019t know about.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Men on horses were chasing after them. They were running away. there also seemed to be demons\u2026. That\u2019s all I know for now.\u201dI really wanted to bite down hard on my tongue as I was acting like that. Charlotte\u2019s lips trembled as she looked at me blankly.\u201cM, more\u2026. More. Do it more. Look more. More. More\u2026. A bit more\u2026.\u201dCharlotte suddenly got up from the bench, and told me to do it more. I wasn\u2019t confident that I was able to meet her desperate eyes.I felt like I was doing something incredibly bad, and it was actually a pretty bad thing to do. No matter how much I wanted to live, I was still playing with this girl\u2019s heart.I had to do it even though I knew that these small lies would eventually give birth to even bigger lies.\u201cI, I can\u2019t see more\u2026. I\u2019d see the same scene again\u2026. That\u2019s all. I don\u2019t know any more. We didn\u2019t do these kinds of things during the supernatural power test\u2026. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t see more\u2026. Maybe my ability is still too weak \u2026.\u201dEven though I didn\u2019t give her the location of the kid she was looking for, just knowing these things I shouldn\u2019t know seemed to be enough for Charlotte to find hope.\u201cCan\u2019t you figure out\u2026 Whether he\u2019s dead or alive? Even just that\u2026. Even just knowing that fact\u2026 Just that\u2026. Please\u2026.\u201dCharlotte, who had been threatening me, pleaded with me now. Before she saw me as something lower than a bug because I was a lowly person who was part of a criminal organization.\u201cPlease\u2026. Please\u2026. Find it out for me\u2026. Please\u2025\u2026.\u201dNow she was about to kneel before me. Her cold and stiff expression had completely distorted and before I knew it Charlotte was crying before me.Charlotte had to suffer through horrific events after she got abducted, and she knew that I was supposed to be the only survivor beside her who went through that suffering. And I eventually saved her life. Perhaps to Charlotte, I was the only one left in her world.Even that course of events was filled with lies, and now I had to do the same thing again. The only reason I had to do this was because my life was at stake. Then and now.I said to Charlotte who was begging me to find out if he was dead or alive:\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s located.\u201dI had a premonition that I would have to continue tell a lot more lies from now on.\u201cBut I\u2019m sure he\u2019s alive.\u201dI had no other choice but to give Charlotte at least a bit of the truth.\u201cHng\u2026. Sob, sob!\u201dCharlotte grabbed my collar and let out a violent cry.\u201cReally\u2026. Really\u2026? He\u2019s alive\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Yes. I can\u2026. Feel at least that much\u2026.\u201d\u201cTha, thank\u2026. Thank you\u2026. Thank you\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t do anything but bite my lips as I watched Charlotte sobbing, looking as if she was about to collapse at any moment.It was alright being called a plot destroyer and getting criticized by many people.However, having to deceive a person like this was something hard to accept.\u201cThanks\u2026.\u201dThe word \u201cThanks\u201d felt like it stabbed through my heart multiple times.* * *Among all the supernatural powers, my supernatural power was especially vague.\u201cThis was the first time I have ever tried this. Really. I couldn\u2019t feel anything like that before, only in this case.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why it worked\u2026. but, I\u2019m relieved.\u201dCharlotte had no other choice but to accept this strange excuse, that it didn\u2019t work in any other instance, as I knew these things that no one else should know. The scenes I described were ones that I wouldn\u2019t know unless I was Valier.She didn\u2019t even suspect in the least that I was Valier. Of course, it might have been that my vague supernatural power had that much persuasive power.Charlotte told me not to tell anyone what I saw and asked me to never mention that I could do things like that. Unlike the orders she directed towards me up until now, these seemed more like favors she asked of me.\u201cYou know why I\u2019m asking this of you\u2026. Please, Reinhardt.\u201dNow she even used my name.\u201cYeah, I know.\u201dIf Bertus found out about this, he might want to use me in that way as well. As it\u2019s an ability I didn\u2019t even have, I\u2019d rather have Charlotte be silent about this. If someone were to ask me why I was able to know these kinds of things, but not other things, I\u2019d be the only one in trouble here.Charlotte seemed to have become as desperate towards me as to my other self.At this point, I was the only clue she had towards finding Valier. Charlotte, after she calmed down a bit, had a reddened face.She now seemed to realize that she was begging and pleading in front of this guy she completely disregarded not too long ago.\u201cUh, ah\u2026 That\u2026 Hn\u2026.\u201dFrom her point of view, she showed me one of her ugly sides. Charlotte seemed to have calmed down, but she fell into a more complicated mood.\u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t know who he is to you, but he must be an important person. Then this is a reasonable reaction.\u201dWhen I told her that it was possible even for the Imperial Princess to lose her composure, as she was human, she bowed her head towards me.\u201cTo think that\u2026. The day would come for me to receive that kind of consolation.\u201dWas it because you were being comforted by a commoner, or by a criminal, or was it because you felt pathetic getting comforted by another person like this? Charlotte looked blankly into the night sky, before she started to speak again.\u201cHe\u2019s the one who saved me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Is that so?\u201d\u201cIf not for him, I\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to return.\u201dThere was no one in the Imperial Capital who didn\u2019t know that the Princess was kidnapped by the Demon King. However, no one knew what happened to her while she was there and how she got out.Both Charlotte and Bertus seemed to want to bury this matter.Charlotte didn\u2019t have any real proof as she didn\u2019t actually suffer from an assassination and was able to escape.Dyrus\u2019 case was different. He faced direct death threats and even fought, but his link was too weak to the Princess for it to be connected to her nearly dying.All of this could have been made as the Princess running away on her own accord because she got surprised.Therefore, the assassination attempt on the Princess simply got buried without a problem. So, information on Dyrus or some kid who supposedly saved the Princess didn\u2019t come to light.So Charlotte wouldn\u2019t have come out with the truth if I didn\u2019t get that lead just now. Telling someone this truth was really dangerous.He was the one who saved her life.Hence, why she was looking for him. It seemed like a good enough reason to look for someone like that, but was it enough to lose one\u2019s rationale over?\u201cHonestly\u2026. If he was just someone who saved your life than it\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that simple. \u201cCharlotte looked at me.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him, I would have gone crazy.\u201dEven if she hadn\u2019t died, she would have gone crazy. Charlotte was weeping bitterly in that prison cell, cradling her mother\u2019s corpse in her arms.She certainly looked like she was in a dangerous state. She didn\u2019t even notice that there was someone in the hallway before I called out to her.\u201cWe were in a place filled with corpses and the smell of blood. Anyone would have gone crazy in there.\u201dCharlotte seemed to recall the time we met.\u201cIn a place like that, he said that everything will be fine, that we\u2019ll win. He kept on trying to reassure me, trying to comfort me somehow.\u201dThe calm Charlotte started to tremble. At that time I had no idea who Charlotte really was.\u201cHe told me that he had lost all his memories. He didn\u2019t know who he was. Even why he was in that place. In the midst of all that, even though it should have been scary for him as well, he tried to sooth me. He didn\u2019t even know who I was, so I was just trembling and crying in that disgusting place, while he tried to comfort me somehow.\u201dI didn\u2019t take care of her, because she was Charlotte de Gardias. I just took care of her because she was a trembling, scared, little kid and about to give up on everything, even though I should have felt terrified for not having any memories.It was a lie that I had lost my memories, but it was true that I had no knowledge of her identity, my situation or the state of this world. It seemed like Charlotte wasn\u2019t just trying to find me because I saved her life.\u201cI made a promise.\u201dYeah. Charlotte definitely made one with me.\u201cI would definitely bring back his memory. I promised that\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like she wanted to find me to keep her promise. Of course, I didn\u2019t actually have amnesia. I had the body of the Demon Prince Valier, but I wasn\u2019t that Valier.It seemed that my lies had become firmly engraved in Charlotte\u2019s mind. It was like she imprinted on me. Something that couldn\u2019t be erased easily.\u201cWould he really want that? Getting back his memory?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t he have suffered quite a lot in the Demon King\u2019s Castle, to lose his memory? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if he didn\u2019t remember? Of course, it\u2019s important to remember who you are, but there are some memories that are better left forgotten.\u201dI was saying this in the hope that she would feel less pressured to keep her promise. I didn\u2019t really have any memories that I lost, but I would feel insanely guilty if she kept on trying to retrieve something that I actually never lost.Listening to my words, Charlotte looked at me with widened eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s possible\u2026. Yeah. That could be\u2026. Yes.\u201dIf one experienced something so terrible, wouldn\u2019t it be better to just forget everything? Charlotte seemed to agree with me to some extent.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not too late to talk it over after you found him.\u201dIn all my guilt I felt slightly relieved. Charlotte\u2019s expression, which seemed so infinitely sad ready to give up everything if she heard that I was dead, lightened up a little. She seemed to feel a lot of guilt that she lost me and couldn\u2019t keep the promise.She looked a little more energetic and even smiled at me for the first time.\u201cFind him.\u201dCharlotte looked me straight in the eyes.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t that quite the risky promise to make to a lowly and dangerous bastard like me?\u201dCharlotte believed that I was the only string that connected her and Valier, so that would explain her sudden attitude change.\u201cYou were quite reckless in that duel. You didn\u2019t seem to be stupid, but you went ahead and did something like that because of your pride. Although you have a strange personality, you didn\u2019t strike me as an idiot, and yet you acted like one at that moment\u2026. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\u201cYou talk quite well in front of the subject you\u2019re badmouthing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I could see at that moment.\u201dIt seemed Charlotte had a different opinion on this than Bertus. Bertus admired my tenacity, getting up even after getting beaten over and over. However, Charlotte seemed to evaluate me as someone who would use force even in situations in which it would be better to yield, because of my pride.\u201cHowever, even though you should have lost, you won in such a nonsensical way.\u201dIf I had lost in that state, Charlotte\u2019s evaluation of me wouldn\u2019t have changed, but in the end, I was able to emerge victorious because of something as ridiculous as suddenly awakening a supernatural ability mid-fight.Seeing that outcome, Charlotte seemed to change her mind a bit.Returning to her usual calm and cold demeanor, Charlotte spoke quietly.\u201cThere are times when one has to do something reckless, as it seems.\u201dShe wanted something so bad that she even came to a fellow classmate who was part of a criminal organization.That was why Charlotte went beyond just asking for cooperation with someone, with whom she usually wouldn\u2019t want to have been involved with. She even made such a dangerous promise with me.She was lucky, that I was actually Valier. What if I were some perverted weirdo? Huh?\u201cI feel like a shrimp caught in a whale\u2019s fight.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Bertus?\u201d\u201cYeah, you both might not realize it, but while you may be fine, I\u2019m completely exhausted. I have to watch my back every time I go out at night.\u201dNo matter how one might look at it, I seemed like a total opportunist..Man\u2026 The situation turned out like this even with Charlotte there. Later when I meet Bertus he\u2019ll probably ask things like: \u201cYou\u2019re pretty close with Charlotte, aren\u2019t you?\u201d How should I answer him?\u00a0 Or what if someone from Charlotte\u2019s side saw me with Bertus. They\u2019d probably complain saying something like: \u201cYou\u2019re getting along quite well with Bertus, don\u2019t you? Huh?\u201d That might actually happen.Honestly, I didn\u2019t want to have trouble with anyone, these two included, at this point. It would be near impossible for me to remain neutral between them.Charlotte smiled, the corners of her mouth slightly raised, after hearing what I said. It felt smiliar to Bertus\u2019 smile when he revealed his more insidious nature to me.\u201cI believe you know how to take care of yourself quite well. Reinhardt.\u201dEven if their factions were different, they were still the same.Why did they act so similarily?In fact, if she appeared in the original novel, wouldn\u2019t she actually take Bertus\u2019 position?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56My tightrope act between Charlotte and Bertus seemed to have started for real now. Charlotte actually needed me more at the moment, but I didn\u2019t know what Bertus would do if he found out that I was on Charlotte\u2019s side.I had no idea how to tackle this issue either. Charlotte would grow stronger with each passing day and she wouldn\u2019t touch me until I found Valier.So, now to Bertus. How should I deal with him? I decided to come clean, as I would be exposed anyway sooner or later.I clearly told Charlotte, that I didn\u2019t want to get on Bertus\u2019 bad side as I was part of Class A. I also told her that I was told to watch her to some extent.Charlotte also didn\u2019t want me to get harmed by Bertus as I still had to find Valier, so she said that I could give him some information on her.I really turned into a complete opportunist.In the end, I really became someone weak against the strong. Aren\u2019t I totally like those hyenas from my first life?\u201cSeems like she\u2019s looking for someone.\u201dThe next day, I talked with Bertus on the terrace of the dormitory.\u2026\u2026In terms of dating simulations, if Ellen\u2019s fixed encounter place was the dining room and the gym, then Bertus\u2019 would be the terrace. Bertus listened to what I had to say and nodded slowly.He made it seem like this was the first time he heard about that, but Bertus actually already knew this. Therefore, even though it was nothing new to him, I still provided him with information that ordinary students shouldn\u2019t know.\u201cHmm\u2026. Did Charlotte tell you herself?\u201dIn the end, I had no other choice but to tell Bertus part of the truth. There was no way that Bertus wouldn\u2019t find out.\u201cShe told me to find him.\u201d\u201cTo you\u2026? Hm\u2026. Ah. Yeah, that would be possible.\u201dBertus nodded, perhaps remembering my origins.\u201cSeems like you already know who she\u2019s looking for?\u201dBertus nodded at my question.\u201cYeah, I knew that much\u2026. Good. So she hasn\u2019t found him yet.\u201dJust by hearing that she instructed me to find him, he inferred that Charlotte hadn\u2019t found me yet, so the information wasn\u2019t completely useless to Bertus.\u201cShe probably told you to find him using the Rotary Gang, not you personally\u2026. How is it? Any progress?\u201dI felt goosebumps all over my body at Bertus\u2019 causal tone.I never told Bertus about the gang. I planned on telling him today, but he already knew. His attitude, as if it was only natural for him to know, was rather creepy.Bertus did a background check on me, and didn\u2019t even give any signs that he knew about those things. Just because he didn\u2019t say it outright didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t know. By saying this directly to me, Bertus wanted to show me that I was well within his own range of effect.It wasn\u2019t just the Rotary Gang. He should have also found out about its connection with the Thieves\u2019 guild. I knew he was probably aware of it, but I didn\u2019t think he would mention it like that in my presence.As I froze up slightly, Bertus grinned.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get so nervous just because of something like that.\u201d\u201cIf you know, just tell me in advance please. You\u2019re giving me a heart attack.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit too much to say you\u2019re just from the streets, is it not? So I just looked into you a little. Did you make any progress?\u201dFortunately, Bertus didn\u2019t think I was Valier himself, like Charlotte. It probably was hard to accept that the thing they were searching for was right next to them.However, unlike Charlotte, he didn\u2019t show any malice towards me even after knowing that I was related to a criminal organisation. I had no idea what he was thinking.Anyway, regarding progress.\u201cHow could there be any? I only have one portrait and not even a name.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. I guess so.\u201dHe seemed to have already expected that I made no progress. If I actually did, that would undermine the efficiency of his own forces.\u201cDid she tell you who he is?\u201d\u201cNo. She didn\u2019t tell me.\u201dEven though I told him that, it didn\u2019t seem like I was expected to know. Bertus looked at Temple\u2019s scenery while enjoying his milk tea.\u201cOkay\u2026. Good. The important thing is that I\u2019m also looking for him, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I figured.\u201d\u201cIf you come across any clues, please let me know if possible.\u201d\u201cI think it would be best if I don\u2019t find any clues in this situation though.\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dIf I chose either of their sides, I would become the enemy of the other side, so it would be best for me to not discover anything. As if agreeing to me, Bertus nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. After leaving her like this for a bit more she\u2019ll end up self-destructing anyway. Well, seeing that she even reached out to you, maybe she already did.\u201dSelf-destruction.Bertus seemed to think that if Charlotte didn\u2019t find me, she would become increasingly more self-destructive. It made me even more depressed knowing what that meant.Charlotte was focusing all her attention on finding me, so it seemed like she was rather negligent in regards to the fight for the throne. That was the reason why he told me I could just leave her alone and why he was rather relaxed about the situation.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be to that extent though\u2026.\u201dBertus smacked his lips as if he was disappointed.Bertus was so wary of Charlotte that he made plans for her to never come back alive, but she ended up coming back. Therefore, he was wholeheartedly preparing to confront her, but the enemy of whom he was so wary of just kept on looking for some boy as if she was obsessed.Betus seemed regretful. Could he be sad seeing his biggest enemy falling apart like that? It was important to win, but it was also important how one won.\u201cOkay, if you can\u2019t find him at all, that\u2019s just how it is. By the way, speaking of which.\u201dAs if he was done talking about Charlotte, Bertus turned to look at me. He didn\u2019t seem to be wary of her any longer at this point. Did he not see her as a worthy rival anymore, because she was just focusing on finding some kid? He seemed to think that it was okay, now that he knew where Charlotte\u2019s priorities lay.\u201cAre you the next master of the Thieves\u2019 Guild or something?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Huh? Ah\u2026. I know it\u2019s quite easy to misunderstand in this situation, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve never even been to the Thieves\u2019 Guild.\u201dAlthough I said I had connections to it, I didn\u2019t even know where the Thieves\u2019 Guild was. That was the truth. Bertus was already aware that I was a beggar, but he seemed to think that there were some things about me that weren\u2019t normal for a kid from the streets.He seemed to be under the impression that it was because I was the next guild master being trained by the Thieves\u2019 Guild. So, I would have already received sufficient training before my enrollment.I sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll believe me or not, but I honestly want to cut my ties with them.\u201dMy original plan was to cut my ties with the Rotary Gang after awakening a talent. Somehow, I ended up in this situation where both the Prince and Princess found out about my background after doing thorough background checks on me.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to make a living by doing dirty work. I don\u2019t want to end up dead in a ditch.\u201dThat was also my honest wish. Who would want to spend their life fighting nonstop? My values weren\u2019t much different from ordinary people.I wanted to idle around and eat comfortably. I didn\u2019t think that was possible for now, so I chose the next best option.\u201cHmm\u2026. Really? Are you saying these things that you don\u2019t actually mean because you\u2019re in front of me?\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, wouldn\u2019t that mean that you already failed to find out my true background then?\u201dThe person who was aiming to become the next Emperor failed to find out the identity of the Guild Master of the Thieves\u2019 Guild? He\u2019d already be unqualified for that position if that were the case. As if my words were plausible, Bertus burst into laughter.\u201cHmm\u2026. So you\u2019re closer to the Rotary Gang than the Thieves\u2019 Guild\u2026. I must say, it\u2019s a bit disappointing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, disappointing?\u201dWhat was so disappointing about me not being the heir to the Thieves\u2019 Guild? I thought there was a good reason why Bertus stayed calm even after finding out about my background.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cYeah .\u201d\u201cI tend to believe that the empowerment of crime is inevitable.\u201d\u201cInevitable, you say?\u201dWhy was he talking about that all of a sudden?\u201cEven if the Thieves\u2019 Guild was to be uprooted, I believe that another group would take its place.\u201dEven if one were to dismantle one criminal group, as time goes by, just like weed, new criminals would gather together and obtain power again, spontaneously. Therefore, eradicating criminal organisations resulted in others filling their places, so completely eradicating crime was impossible.Look at this kid.\u201cIn that case, if one couldn\u2019t get rid of it, wouldn\u2019t it be good to take control of that shady power, to completely own it? If it\u2019s impossible to completely get rid of it, it would be the best option to get rid of the old power and monitor the new criminal power that would fill its place. Being able to handle things that could only be solved by the dark side would be a bonus, of course\u201dI slowly got an inkling of what he was talking about.He looked at me with a creepy smile.\u201cSo, won\u2019t you become the guild master?\u201dI could see now why Bertus said Charlotte would end up self-destructing.Charlotte only thought of finding Valier through me. She ended up so nerve wrecking just to find Valier.However, Bertus was thinking of dominating the Capital\u2019s dark side through me.* * *In the past, the United States enforced the prohibition of alcohol, which consequently led to the tremendous growth of mafia organizations in America. This happened because if one were to ban easily producible goods, they would be continued to be made illegally, leading to organizations distributing these goods to emerge. If there was demand there would always be supply, and if the production and distribution of said product was illegal, there would be a number of criminal organizations producing and distributing them.The empowerment of crime was therefore inevitable, because there are always people who covet things they shouldn\u2019t, and someone supplying them.To facilitate the supply, crime got organized, and thus the concept of organized crime appeared. It wasn\u2019t something that could be stopped.Bertus judged that such a development was inevitable. Even if he were to uproot them, someone else would just take their place, so he thought it would be better to take control of it. That way, even if a new organization were to appear, he would be able to tighten his grip on it much faster.So, Bertus wanted me to become the next guild master.To take control of the whole underworld in the future by first taking control of the Thieves\u2019 Guild.He could also make use of it for personal purposes other than controlling and monitoring criminal organizations, so Bertus seemed to think that this was a pretty good plan.So, he proposed to me, who was a Temple student as well as a member of the Rotary Gang, if I had any intentions of becoming the King of the Imperial Capital\u2019s underworld. That was why he thought it was rather disappointing that I didn\u2019t have much connection to the Thieves\u2019 Guild.The size of our visions were completely different. No matter if this was the right thing to do or not, our way of thinking was just completely different.Bertus said there was no rush to come to a decision yet, and this plan was far too big to immediately implement anyway.This was just too big to just decide on the fly, and to be honest, this wasn\u2019t really appealing to me at all. If I were to get involved in a criminal organization like that and absorb it, I\u2019d be forced to do various things. I didn\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be able to do something like that and if my mind would be able to endure it.So, Bertus ended our conversation after he offered me this.The guild master of the Thieves\u2019 Guild\u2026.It was true, that there was nothing bad about having power. Actually rather than bad things, weren\u2019t there many good things about it? Besides, Bertus, who was in the line of succession to the throne, said he\u2019d look after me.I was already part of something that was almost an illegal organization.And one could do a lot more with an illegal organization than with a legitimate one.However, I was actually someone with no ambition at all. I never had anything to do with organizational management, so I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d have to do. Would I really be able to do something like that? My goal was to just eat and live well, nothing more. If it weren\u2019t for the gates, I wouldn\u2019t even have come to Temple in the first place.In any case, the Prince gave me something to think about, but it didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to push me to become the guild master though.Of course, he had no reason to actually use me for that. If he really wanted to have the Thieves\u2019 Guild\u2019s guild master in his hands, he could just do it himself.In the first place, both Charlotte and Bertus knew the whereabouts of the Thieves\u2019 Guild, they just didn\u2019t want to get their hands dirty by interacting with them.He maybe just wanted to test my usefulness and my abilities.If that were the reasons, then that would mean that the Prince didn\u2019t have much interest in controlling the underworld yet. If it was really necessary for him, he wouldn\u2019t do it through me. In the end, it was more likely that he wanted to see how ambitious I was and whether my abilities were up to par.Anyway, there was no rush. It was a decision I had to slowly and carefully think about.* * *One could feel the atmosphere of the Victory Festival even inside of Temple. The training routine itself didn\u2019t change much, but one could feel this overall excitement floating about Temple.Some students packed their bags in advance in preparation to return home for the period the school was closed. So, while there were a lot of kids looking forward to the Festival there were also some who just looked forward to returning back to their home.Everyone had different plans.\u201cThe Knights Templar?\u201d\u201cYeah, after watching the return of the Knights Templar I\u2019ll go back to the monastery. It\u2019s been a while.\u201dAdriana was smiling brightly imagining the majestic appearance of the Knights Templar, who would soon return after accomplishing their great mission.The Five Great Bishops united their forces in an army for the Demon World War. Priests and Paladins of all religions gathered together and played a pivotal role in the Allied Forces, and now came back after leading the church to victory.Of course, I knew that part well. The Knights Templar would continue to exist even after that, and it\u2019s the place all Paladins and Priests dream to enter. Adriana also seemed to want to join them.\u201cAnd then you\u2019re going back to the monastery?\u201d\u201cYes, I grew up in the Towan Monastery of the Saint-Owan Grand Duchy.\u201dAdriana said she grew up in a monastery dedicated to Towan, the god of purity. She was an orphan, but thanks to her outstanding talent, she was able to enter Temple\u2019s Royal Class easily. So, it seemed like she joined Temple starting high school.By the way, speaking of the divine power of Towan, the god of purity. It would be especially strong against undead. Of course, I wasn\u2019t an undead, but I really wouldn\u2019t get along well with that order.Towan\u2019s doctrine was fundamentally based on hatred towards Demons after all.Honestly, I couldn\u2019t remember all the settings in detail, but after living and studying in Temple for some time I was able to relearn quite some knowledge I had forgotten. For me, as this world\u2019s writer, it felt quite strange to have to study the content I just randomly pieced together to set up the Churches and their doctrine.\u201cBy the way, weren\u2019t the paladins and priests of Towan not allowed to get married?\u201d\u201cYeah, what of it?\u201dAdriana tilted her head as if asking me why I asked her something so obvious.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t decide something like that at such a young age.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be too late if you made that decision after you grew up, you punk. You could still become a priest after seeing what the world had to offer, you know? Adriana smirked at this young old man\u2019s whining.\u201cIf you were to worship a god and attend masses, you\u2019d change your mind, Junior. There are people in this world who can live on faith alone. It\u2019s a full life in its own way.\u201dI felt like she was trying to convert me, to the point where I started to get scared. Adriana slowly brought up this topic and she seemed to think that now was the right time.Adriana suddenly grabbed my hands and wouldn\u2019t budge at all.It was rather scary.\u201cSo, do you want to go to a mass together with me after the school closes?\u201d\u201cP, please don\u2019t do this\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to accurately follow the doctrine of Towan. Everyone deserves his grace, Junior. I\u2019m sure they will be able to fix your twisted personality as well. They are all good people.\u201dAt some point, Adriana started preaching to me. No, I was very grateful to her and I knew she was kind, but this was just pressuring!\u201cBathed under the Saint\u2019s light, we can all find happiness, Junior.\u201dAdriana suddenly turned into a church sister even though she wasn\u2019t part of the church yet.Honestly, I couldn\u2019t agree to that even out of gratitude. She probably prepared various methods to get me to come, both physical and psychological.Yes, I absolutely knew it would be like that!She\u2019d use a trick of first gently approaching me and when I was about to refuse she would make me feel sorry and naturally lead me to her church! This would happen once, twice, thrice until I can\u2019t leave anymore\u2026.I thought you liked it\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026 I was just happy to share my happiness with you, I didn\u2019t want to drag you with me\u2026 Sorry for misunderstanding\u2026 Although, please do come to the next mass! If you won\u2019t come, I\u2019d be very sad\u2026..That was what this felt like!Ah.Sister.Are you doing well.I heard you got married\u2026.I was curious about how things were in my old world suddenly\u2026.\u201cI, I\u2019m already part of a different belief!\u201dAdriana tilted her head as I shouted, appearing like I was about to be dragged to hell.\u201cHuh? You already have a god you follow?\u201d\u201cWell. I wouldn\u2019t call him a god or something\u2026 But there\u2019s something I believe in.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026? Who?\u201dI looked at Adriana with a determined expression.Yes, I was already part of a religion.\u201cMe.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI, I believe in myself.\u201dA religion where I was both the only worshipper and object of worship.In other words, I was the head of the Winning Mentality Church and its object of faith itself!I believed in myself.That was my source of strength.It was even more amazing because it was actually true.\u201cEh\u2026. Huuh?\u201dAdriana didn\u2019t understand a word I said, so she looked dumbfounded for a while.After listening to my detailed explanation she slapped my back and told me not to say strange things anymore.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Friday.After classes were over, everyone got excited and started running wild, and the most annoying one among them was No. 8 Kono Lint.\u201dIt\u2019s closing todaaaaay!\u201dThose who planned on returning to their homes hurried back to the dormitory to pack their things, and the ones who would remain went on to do their own thing because a long break was about to begin.I would stay in the dormitory for today and leave tomorrow when things have gotten calmer. I was going to meet up with Eleris after all. As I was taking the mana train multiple times, to shake off any possible tails I might have, I planned on transforming to a different appearance using Sarkegaar\u2019s ring before going to Eleris\u2019 store.I could go to the Rotary Gang, but I was reluctant to go there because of various reasons. It seemed like the Prince and the Princess had already begun to look into that place.This might be an honor in its own way. When would higher ranked people pay so much attention to a beggar\u2019s organization after all?It wasn\u2019t intentional, but the outcome was moderately good.Charlotte would try to protect the Rotary Gang because it held the only clue to find Valier, while Bertus would try to use the Rotary Gang as a stepping stone to take over the Capital\u2019s underworld, so he wouldn\u2019t do anything to it.Depending on my actions, they might actually help me, far from trying to harm me.Eventually, by proving my usefulness to both of them, I seemed to have turned into one hell of an opportunist. Someone needed by both the Prince and the Princess.I might actually be quite the popular guy, huh?Everyone was excited. Both the ones who would return and the ones who would stay behind.Of course, there were three exceptions.Ellen Artorius, who\u2019d eventually become a hero never before seen, would continue to think about her brother\u2019s death. Perhaps this festival wasn\u2019t something Ellen could be excited about.The other two were Bertus and Charlotte.The two of them were going to be very busy during this festival, having to rush from one place to another. They tried not to show any exhaustion, but they seemed to be struggling.\u201cCharlotte.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Yeah.\u201dTherefore, I was able to wittness a rare scene. I saw the two of them holding a conversation. No one said anything superficially, but the two of them tried to pretend not to know each other in Temple. Of course, they didn\u2019t get along at all.So, even though it had been a while since they entered the school, that would have been the first time seeing them hold a conversation in Temple for everyone.The two of them were talking as they walked side by side.-So, the order of protocol is\u2026.-I already memorized everything. I don\u2019t have to hear it again.-As expected, you\u2019re smart.-No, you\u2019re the only oh-so-smart one.-Why does it sound like you\u2019re being sarcastic even though it\u2019s supposed to be a compliment?-Because I was being sarcastic.Bertus, who pretended to be kind, and Charlotte, who was being overtly blunt.They seemed to be talking about things related to the festival. Since it was an official imperial event, both Bertus and Charlotte would have to make an appearance.Everyone was staring blankly at the half-siblings holding their conversation, as if they couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.And, as if not in the least interested in this scene, I watched Ellen Artorius carelessly walking out of the classroom building.\u201cGet out of my way, you bastard.\u201d-Pang!\u201cUrg!\u201dThen everyone turned to the scene of A-9 Erich hitting B-3 Scarlett in the head while passing by.\u201cHow unlucky.\u201dErich could be seen passing by, and A-10 Cayer briefly sweared at her before following behind Erich. I wondered where Ludwig was. I wasn\u2019t sure if he had already left.Scarlett kept her head down and didn\u2019t say a word. All the other students left, pretending they didn\u2019t see her at all.For just how long did I have to watch this? According to the original story, Ludwig would end up requesting a duel with Erich. However, this had already gone terribly wrong, just because I intervened once.Of course, Ludwig\u2019s personality itself hadn\u2019t changed, so Ludwig would end up saving Scarlett one day. So if I intervened now, the future would change again and it might become even more unpredictable.Fiery red hair and red eyes.Scarlett raised her head and met my eyes.Everyone had already left, so Scarlett and I were the only ones left in the hallway.Scarlett lowered her gaze again in fear after our eyes met.There were numerous sins I committed in this world, this grievous situation definitely was one of them.She\u2019ll get saved.Ludwig will be the one to save her.Those settings were made with such simple, careless thoughts. Both the reason for her bullying and the solution. However, I eventually got confronted with this reality I created with my own hands.This strange reality, it was me who created it.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with red?.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dI looked at Scarlett as if I was talking to her.\u201cWhat\u2019s so important about hair color? Isn\u2019t it more important being the best in Temple?\u201dScarlett raised her head and looked at me again. She was treated like a bad omen by everyone, because of her red eyes and hair, so she got bullied because of it for a long time. I approached her. She backed off against the wall, as if trying to escape from me.I wasn\u2019t trying to threaten her.\u201cYou saw it. The winner\u2019s always right.\u201dScarlett came to see my duel.\u201cDidn\u2019t you come to see that?\u201dWhy did Scarlett come to see my duel?She wasn\u2019t from the same class, but she came to see my duel with the senior. I accepted this duel with that senior without even having a talent.It was clear what the outcome would be. I didn\u2019t know why she came.However, she saw it clearly. I was able to emerge victorious against that senior in the end.She must have seen me stand back up again and again, despite our difference in origin and strength.\u201cDon\u2019t doze off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen I whispered to Scarlett, whose eyes seemed like those of a frightened rabbit. It was just like the sweet temptation of a devil.\u201cShould I tell you something?\u201d\u201cWha,t\u2026. is it?\u201dRight.Scarlett talked to me quite politely. Come to think of it, this was our first time talking.Anyway, I told her Erich Lafaeri\u2019s secret.It wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal.\u201cThat guy\u2019s a pushover.\u201dYou were in the same year. How long did you want to get pushed around by that weakling?You already knew that much.\u2018The trouble maker Reinhardt went beyond just starting fights on his own and now egged others on to fight. He\u2019s said to be a devil\u2019s seed born to instill conflict, destroy friendships and disrupt other\u2019s peaceful life at Temple.\u2019That was right.Objectively speaking, I was no longer just a villain, I was slowly transitioning into a supervillain.Put in Batman terms, I wouldn\u2019t be the Joker, but rather the Penguin.I even had the unprecedented luck to awaken a supernatural ability in the middle of a fight even though I was completely incompetent.It was even common for me to swear at nobles while being a beggar, and even laying hands on them.Not only was I able to beat up my senior, but I even got the college level seniors of the Royal Class, who didn\u2019t know about my true personality, to believe I was good and righteous. They even promised to take care of me if I ever got into trouble.Currently, I received support from both Bertus and Charlotte who were Number 1 of their respective class and were virtually the most powerful.\u00a0 In other words, I was rather free from their power which transcended Temple. They both had no intention of directly controlling me.I strangely didn\u2019t even have any problems with the ones that could subdue me. Ellen, who was pretty much the strongest among the first years and had no close friends, even taught me swordsmanship.Of course, that was because I only clashed with people who had seriously flawed personalities and picked a fight with me first.And now, no matter how big a problem the bullying was, I was even urging the victim to fight the perpetrator.The man who was behind every incident that took place in Temple and only thought about messing around.That was who I became.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dScarlett remained frozen for a long time after telling her that Erich was actually a total pushover. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t know that or that she didn\u2019t know how to fight. She didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble. She thought that her life would be over if she were kicked out of Temple.Strictly speaking, she didn\u2019t really need my help.I mean, she was a better fighter than me anyways.Objectively speaking, in the current first-year combat ranking, Scarlett would be among the Top 5. Of course, Ellen would take first place with a wide gap between the first and second place. She might jump between the 2nd and 5th place, but Scarlett would definitely keep being among the best.She wasn\u2019t able to do it because of her trauma caused by being bullied for all her life by a person, who she could defeat in a duel quite easily.* * *I was staying in the dormitory for today, as I was thinking of paying Eleris a visit tomorrow.So I just started doing my usual training. Adriana said she\u2019d leave today, so she only came by to train in the morning.Everyone was excited for this holiday, so there were many students who were rushing to leave Temple.Ludwig, who was still quite inexperienced, ran around Temple once a day every morning without fail. Of course, that was only possible for him. I still had a long way to go.Originally, I didn\u2019t have any interest or talent in exercising. Now that I thought about it, I wasn\u2019t really enjoying it either. I just clenched my teeth and powered through because I felt a certain guilt. I wasn\u2019t allowed to rest. I had something to do, so I had to work hard.That strong compulsion was the only thing that kept me going.\u201cWhew\u2026.\u201dHowever, after running for a while, at the place where Temple\u2019s Higher Education Department was located, I sat down on a bench on a hillside where one of the running tracks was. I was trying to catch my breath.I could overlook the vast landscape of Temple from there. Even if I wasn\u2019t as strong as Ludwig, my stamina definitely improved by leaps and bounds. I was even able to climb these hills without much problems, even though I was still slightly out of breath.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t any event like a sudden explosive growth in stats or my overall performance. My supernatural ability awakened, but that didn\u2019t mean I suddenly had the power to flip the world upside down.However, a short while ago, I wasn\u2019t even able to run properly without Adriana\u2019s support, but now I had enough stamina to run up a hillside and look down on all of Temple. It wasn\u2019t at the speed of an airplane or a car, but enough to feel my growth and the results of my training.I was growing little by little. Obviously, this wasn\u2019t the fantasy life I was dreaming of.My growth was rather slow, and even if the crisis was still far away, it was still definitely approaching.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dThis felt more like a slice-of-life story than the one I actually wrote.This was completely different from casually describing that a character suddenly became stronger after years or decades of training.I had to fill these weeks, months and years with my own body.It was up to me to work hard in these months I described in the novel.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m thirsty.\u201dBut let\u2019s first drink some water and continue to run.* * *I\u2019m Type A.\u201cCome.\u201dType A was a preset setting specialized in close combat, namely swordsmanship and body strengthening.-Kaang!\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dI sighed as I watched the sword slip out of my grasp.\u201cTrain your grip strength.\u201d\u201cI am. I\u2019m doing it to the point where I can\u2019t feel my hands anymore.\u201dEven if I used my supernatural power, I keep losing grip of my weapon after taking a hit from her.\u201cThen use your ability .\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve been using it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dShe was a master in making me feel small. I slumped on the floor as I picked up my training sword. My hands felt numb and I had a hard time holding my sword properly.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it strange?\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201dEllen tilted her head at my words.\u201cI know because I felt it, but aren\u2019t you a lot stronger than the 3rd year I was barely able to defeat by luck?\u201dIt was actually like that. I ended up like this even while she was going extremely easy on me. I could guarantee that if she had gone up against Mayarton that day, the duel would have been over in under 5 seconds. I wasn\u2019t exaggerating. That was Artorius, the greatest warrior of all mankind, for you. To be exact, she was even better in terms of talent than Ragan Artorius.If nurtured properly Ellen Artorius would become even more of a monster than him.\u201cWhat of it?\u201cIf you\u2019re strong, you\u2019re strong.\u201cI can understand that you don\u2019t gain much weight even after eating so much. There are people like that after all.\u201dPeople with a super high metabolism or people with poor digestive efficiency. There were definitely people who wouldn\u2019t gain that much weight by eating a lot. I got up and pointed at Ellen\u2019s arms and wrist.\u201cWhat I mean is, how can you have that much strength when your body looks like this?\u201dYes.Mayarton was big. Ellen, however, wasn\u2019t muscular and, technically speaking, she had quite the slender build.It was totally mysterious how she was able to generate such power from such a thin body. It was just so strange, physically speaking!I disliked it even more, because I thought I knew the reason for that.Of course, it was because of me.Obviously\u2026. She was supposed to have the best talents in the world, ahd excellent skills and was a total munchkin, but I described her as a \u201cBeautiful girl\u201d, which was why she looked the way she looked. There might be 188cm tall muscular beauties out there, but they wouldn\u2019t look like young girls, now would they? So that was why there was a kid in front of me with a height of 163cm and a weight of 40 kg with the strength of a human tank. This physical discrepancy was purely caused by my unrealistic standards.She seemed soft everywhere as if she had no muscles. In fact, the skin on her arms looked as smooth as a baby\u2019s, when they were supposed to be weathered and packed with muscles. She wasn\u2019t even toned. Actually, we had some body contact while we were training so I found out that she was all soft.Of course, if one were to enter the superhuman stage, it was possible to have power that went far beyond what a normal human was capable of,\u00a0 using magic body enhancement..However, she didn\u2019t know how to use that yet, so she was only using her body\u2019s strength.Right.I was god.I broke the laws of physics of this world with just a few lines of text. Ellen frowned slightly at my grumbling.\u201cOur family is strong.\u201dAh.Was the probability of that part just supplemented to that degree? Were your family\u2019s muscle fibers made out of adamantium wire or something?Seriously, even if they were the strongest family in the world, this didn\u2019t make much sense.I was born like that. What are you going to do about it?In three words, it was blunt. Well, I had never made that kind of setting, but her family might be descendants of dragons or something. This was a world where the probability which I flipped on its head got supplemented.In the end, it was me who violated the rules here, so I had no right to complain. I could just accept it. There was a limit to how much growth one could achieve through training alone, so one would supplement one\u2019s body using talents or skills.If one were able to do this long term, one entered the superhuman stage through magic body enhancement.\u201cHold it again.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201d-Kaang!\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you playing baseball?Seeing my training sword fly towards the other end of the gym, I felt dejected.It wasn\u2019t a homerun, but a\u00a0hit.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58After my extreme training and sparring, Ellen left me alone and focused on her own training. Cliffman had returned home, so he wasn\u2019t at the gym today.Cliffman was that type of guy to me.An unknown guy I\u2019ve encountered at the gym quite often.When we met, he\u2019d slightly greet me, but he didn\u2019t say a word. It was to the point where I\u2019d notice when he wasn\u2019t there, but we weren\u2019t on talking terms yet.-Hup!Ellen was busy, beating up scarecrows and honing her techniques. Actually, there was no reason for her to spar with me. To be that girl\u2019s training partner one had to have a certain level of skill. To her, I was only a little kid just starting out.I continued to cook dinner, but that wasn\u2019t such a big deal. I always ended up making too much for myself. That was all. Somehow, I kind of stopped being so strict in our cooking lessons and focused more on swordsmanship. She still looked after me, even after the duel was over though.I mean, wasn\u2019t that strange?I mean, I just wrote that letter for the sake of writing it, but still, she super dumped me. I was really curious what she was thinking about me, now that she was right in front of me.In fact, I only wrote that love letter to get dumped and get some achievement points.After that, we somehow ended up eating lunch together, then practiced swordsmanship and then ate dinner together.However, Ellen didn\u2019t act particularly close to me, and neither did I act close to her.To the extent that she would probably even ignore me even if we were to run into each other on the street.No, well, even the classmates who hated me like Erich, Cayer or even Harriet, would show some sort of disgruntled reaction when they\u2019d see me, but she wouldn\u2019t even look at me?We had late-night snacks and early morning snacks together almost every day. We\u2019d meet each other every morning when we did our morning training and we even stuck around at the gym after school.But we didn\u2019t really have any private conversations.We seemed to be close, but we weren\u2019t really.If we were to ever meet outside, I bet she would even ask me who I was.However, she did try to be my champion in the duel.She was always calm\u2026. I don\u2019t know\u2026.However, when I meet up with her, I can\u2019t read her well\u2026.It wouldn\u2019t kill me. I just would have to ask her right? I wasn\u2019t some dense main character from some novel nor was I expecting anything.If one doesn\u2019t know something, one should ask.It was that simple, right?\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEllen looked at me.\u201cDo you like me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt didn\u2019t really hurt because I expected her to answer like that.I really didn\u2019t care that much.Really!However, Ellen had a different reaction compared to last time. Ellen had a grim look on her face, turned towards me and asked me.\u201cDo you like me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSeeing as she didn\u2019t say something like \u201cYou told me you liked me some time ago though\u201d, she might have forgotten about that incident.Anyway, seemed like we became close enough to ask about these things casually. I knew it would just be better to answer no to these kinds of things.I didn\u2019t even mean to ask about that in the first place.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen are we friends?\u201dAt my words, Ellen stopped swinging her sword and silently contemplated.She took a minute or so.Ellen opened her mouth again as she pointed her sword towards the scarecrow.\u201cI think so.\u201dThat was her answer.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *So, it seemed like Ellen Artorius just recently seriously thought about whether we were friends or not for the first time. Hence, why it took some time for her to think about the answer.That being said, calling Bertus my friend was a little strange, as it felt more like a hierarchical relationship. So, Ellen could be said to be the first friend I made in Temple. If you thought about it, it was rather funny. She was extremely taciturn, so it should have been the hardest to get closer to her. In fact, it would have taken her a long time before she made some friends in the original story.However, knowing that Ellen didn\u2019t care about my reputation and didn\u2019t have any preconceived notions about me, was rather comfortable. As a result, we became like this.After my stamina recovered I went back to my usual routine, namely posture and strength training.Standard bedtime was at 11 o\u2019clock. I would train at the gym until 9, then I would come out and have a late night-snack at the dining room, usually with Ellen.So, Ellen and I both only trained until 9 so that we would still get to eat some food. We didn\u2019t decide on that, it just naturally happened like this.It was now 9 o\u2019clock.It was time to stop the training.\u201cAren\u2019t you overdoing it today?\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dToday, Ellen was a bit different from usual. Even if she didn\u2019t have the same amount of stamina as Ludwig, she still had almost as much. She had been beating the scarecrow without even taking time to catch her breath.She was breathing roughly, and I could see that her whole body was covered in sweat. I noticed that she was training harder than usual.I didn\u2019t want to be a cat that cared about tigers, but her condition was certainly a bit strange.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop and take a rest?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll train a bit longer.\u201dEllen said that without even looking at me. Well, she said that we probably were friends, but sticking my nose in anymore would be weird. She might tell me not to pretend to be close or something.\u201cThen hurry up and go rest. I\u2019m leaving.\u201dEllen didn\u2019t answer me as I left the gym.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Obviously, there were hardly any students left in the dormitory, and the ones that were still there probably went to sleep because it was close to curfew.Come to think of it, Temple sure provided dream like living conditions.They do the laundry, provide meals, give out pocket money, prepare whatever you might need and even give you a fully stocked kitchen you could use at your own convenience.They also give you four gold coins as pocket money per month. Of course, it was just small change to kids from good houses, but it was a lot of money for me. If it was for personal training or research, they\u2019d even give you additional support depending on its content. In other words, it was kind of like a research grant.In fact, it wasn\u2019t really important to graduate from Temple to live a good life. Actually, wasn\u2019t one able to live a comfy and cozy life just by being a Temple student?Wasn\u2019t this a dream school no one would want to graduate from? Wouldn\u2019t one want to live on as a Temple student until one died? This would lead to an infinite loop of procrastination.Wasn\u2019t this another setting error? One would want to continue attending Temple, and Royal Class, just for these benefits alone.I went to the kitchen while having these weird thoughts.Even though I didn\u2019t receive any more support in the form of divine power, I was still exercising a whole lot, even if it wasn\u2019t to the degree of Ludwig or Ellen. Hence I still had to eat a lot. I also felt like what I ate didn\u2019t really turn into fat.I originally cooked for myself, but I definitely improved ever since I started living in Temple. There were a lot of ingredients, and if one needed anything specific, one could just ask for it and they would provide it right away.I\u2019d get tired of always eating the same thing, so I made this and that. I didn\u2019t want to live off of snacks like Ellen, so I tended to make my own food.Someone who only lived from hamburgers and pizza would get tired of those one day.Living life routinely was fine, but I didn\u2019t want my diet to follow a routine as well.I looked through the ingredients kept in the kitchen pantry and thought about what I should make.Well, this didn\u2019t really fit my concept, but\u2026.Still, I was indeed grateful. Besides, this was a sensitive time for her as well.I took out a bag of bread.I was thinking of making some sandwiches.There were two people in Temple I felt grateful to.Adriana, who recently turned to the dark side and became like a church nun. No, calling a nun part of the dark side was a bit much, wasn\u2019t it? Well, that was how it felt to me anyways.And Ellen Artorius.To be honest, I often told Adriana that I was grateful to her, I didn\u2019t do the same with Ellen because of the nature of our relationship. It wasn\u2019t like she was doing anything unusual anyway, she just ate what I made and trained in the gym.Ah. No matter how I tired to make it out to be, I was like nothing more than a high schooler who was happy about having made his first friend.A, actually\u2026. I think I felt a little touched\u2026.I had to admit that.I was kind of touched hearing that we were friends! How silly! Ah! I know!I made some club sandwiches. I didn\u2019t have to put as much effort into those. I thought it would probably be better to make a lot because she\u2019d probably end up eating a lot.I put in a moderate amount of vegetables, plenty of cheese and ham. This could probably be called a calorie bomb, but neither I nor Ellen cared about these kinds of things. We exercised too much to die of\u00a0hyperlipidemia.I also found a food basket in the kitchen, so I packed the freshly made sandwiches in there and headed to the gym.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dAnd I couldn\u2019t help but be a little surprised by the sight before my eyes.Ellen was lying in front of the scarecrow, the remnants of a broken training sword lying next to her.\u201cAh! You\u2019ll catch death if you sleep here!\u201dAlthough that was what I had said, I was running towards her.* * *Temple\u2019s Royal Class was one of the most intensive educational institutions of the Empire. Besides the ones I already mentioned there were numerous services provided for VIPs.So, that kind of meant that I didn\u2019t know what they were specifically.I just wrote something like: The service is great!Of course, I knew some of the services. One of them was a priest dedicated to us, who could use recovery spells and was stationed in a specific place 24/7. It was like the nurse office teacher. The only difference from an infirmary teacher was that they could also heal severe injuries, and not just perform first aid.I couldn\u2019t really remember, but I probably received that priest\u2019s help after that duel last time. I carried Ellen on my back and called for a priest.I went to the recovery room, where I once lay, and laid Ellen down on the priestess\u2019 instructions. While casting some divine spells, the she asked me about the situation.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cShe looked exhausted or something like that. She was lying on the gym floor.\u201dOther than the forehead being slightly wounded, she didn\u2019t seem to be seriously hurt. But she smashed her training sword, you know? Anyway, she didn\u2019t seem to have serious injuries.\u201cBut I\u2019m glad you were able to find her so quickly. Well done.\u201dEven if she just passed out because of exhaustion, it might have gotten dangerous if she was found too late, so the priestess praised me.She asked for my and Ellen\u2019s name and grade, so I answered.\u201cFirst year Reinhardt and Ellen. Mr. Epinhauser is your homeroom teacher, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGood job, Reinhardt. I\u2019ll write down a merit for you.\u201dWhat.I didn\u2019t think that would happen. The uniformed teacher looked at me with a kind smile. It was a benevolent smile that showed that she was a genuinely religious person.Ooh, it really does feel divine. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, I forgot about my roots\u2026.\u201cI heard you were a mess, but it seems you are very different from the rumors.\u201dOh, my reputation had even reached the teachers. Anyway, she seemed to be quite impressed that I would carry my classmate on my back, contrary to the preconceived notions everyone had.But there were things like merits? I didn\u2019t even know those existed here.The priestess checked on Ellen\u2019s condition and said she would get up soon. She told me that I could go back, but I stayed by her side.The teacher looked at me with a mischievous smile, as if she knew what I was thinking.No, it wasn\u2019t like that.Just like the teacher told me, Ellen slowly opened her eyes after about 10 minutes.\u201cUrg\u2026\u201dEllen raised her eyelids, let out a low groan and turned to look at me and the priestess, then opened her eyes wide.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dShe seemed bewildered.That stone Buddha looked flustered.It was such a precious scene, so I tried to immediately burn it into my memory.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dEllen thought for a moment, before she seemed to realize what was going on.\u201cHey, if you sleep in places like that, you might end up dead . You\u2019re so young. Do you want to be reincarnated so badly? Tch.\u201d\u201cPffft!\u201dAt my persistent words, the priestess burst into laughter and Ellen turned her head away from me. She clearly was very embarrassed right now. However, it wasn\u2019t just the two of us here. That teacher doubling as a priestess was also present.\u201cEllen, even if he says that, Reinhardt still carried you on his back. He came in here with a totally pale face and said \u201cTeacher, do something!\u201d Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cTe, teacher\u2026.\u00a0 Why did you say that\u2026. \u201dNo, you idiot! How could you tell her? Ellen was glancing at me when she heard what the teacher said. You didn\u2019t think, I\u2019d do that, huh?\u201cIt seems like you practiced too hard. Don\u2019t overexert yourself. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWith these words, the priestess left the recovery room, telling us that she would report this after the school closure.\u201cWhy were you sleeping there on the floor?\u201dAt my question, Ellen stared blankly at the ceiling.\u201cWhile I was practicing my techniques and beating the scarecrow, my training sword suddenly broke\u2026. I think I fell forward and hit my head because my balance was broken.\u201dEllen seemed to remember clearly how she fainted.Exhaustion wasn\u2019t the problem, it was because she head-butted the scarecrow. It seemed like an acute concussion.Come to think of it, wasn\u2019t that quite serious? No, that\u2019s not it. The reason probably was both exhaustion and the concussion.I didn\u2019t know if someone would have carried her out if I wasn\u2019t there. Well, it was fine now, seeing that she was okay.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t I save you then?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201dI did say that I\u2019d let it go seeing that she was alright and all, but what if I didn\u2019t come back to share the sandwiches I made with her? She might have been found dead the next day.The girl with the best talents this world could offer nearly ended up dying after head-butting a scarecrow\u2026.How could there be such an absurd situation. Ellen lay down and looked at me quietly, before she nodded her head slightly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t her usual voice, it was a little more subdued. How cute. Well, the charm of taciturn characters would appear when their concept collapsed.Ellen definitely overdid it today. She continued to swing her sword without resting, on the contrary, she trained even more intensely.Someone with usually good self-control went over her limits, and, in the end, after she tried to swing her training sword even after exhausting all her strength, she ended up hitting her head on the scarecrow.No one else knew the reason why she would do something like that, but I knew.This girl was in a more mentally shaken up state, completely different from her normal self.So, I didn\u2019t ask her why she overdid it.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stand up?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSince she was treated with divine power, she should have completely recovered. There was no reason for her to continue to lie down.\u201cLet\u2019s just eat some sandwiches. I made a lot.\u201d\u201cAh. Okay.\u201dEllen jumped up. Look at her react right away when I mentioned food. I bet she would inhale all the food again.\u201cI made it for you, so you better be thankful.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t forget to brag as per usualPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59\u201cI want to shower.\u201dEllen sniffed her body and said she wanted to go shower.\u201cIf you go wash up, it\u2019ll be past bed time, won\u2019t it?\u201dThere were a lot of things going on and before we knew it, it was almost 11 o\u2019clock. Of course, not keeping the curfew wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but if a superintendent found us while on their patrol, it would be a slight pain in the ass. Well, it wouldn\u2019t be very likely, of course.I wrote a lot of scenes where Ludwig wandered about past the curfew, after all.\u201cI hate this smell.\u201dEllen was sweating profusely and seemed to hate that sticky feeling. She must have sweat more than usual. I felt how sticky she was when I was carrying her.Even if I put the food in front of her now, she probably wouldn\u2019t have the appetite to actually eat it because of the smell.I decided to make a bit more than usual today. I thought Ellen would be rather depressed.That was why I ended up making sandwiches, so that I could bring them to her.\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay. Then let\u2019s go down to the dining hall.\u201dI was planning on going to the dining hall, but Ellen shook her head.\u201cYou might get caught by the teacher.\u201dHm? What should we do then? You want to eat, but then we would end up going past the curfew and we\u2019d be at risk getting caught by the superintendent, but she still wanted to eat after being so exhausted. What kind of greed was this?\u201cCan\u2019t we eat in my room?\u201dAh.Did I hear that right?* * *Temple didn\u2019t separate girls and boys into different dormitories, they just divided by class, so the boys could visit the girls\u2019 rooms and the girls could visit the boys\u2019 rooms. In Class B, they did it often to get together and hang out.In Class A there seemed to be only a few cases of students visiting each other\u2019s rooms.How could they put men and women in the same dormitory, when they were very different? What if they made trouble?The class parts were important, but the dormitory parts were also responsible for a huge amount of the narrative progression. If the dormitory were divided into male and female, I would have only been able to describe the male characters, as Ludwig, the main character, would live in the male dormitory.I, as the writer, was responsible for this merge of male and female dormitories, so that I could induce certain incidents and spur on relationships to form. It would have been safer to just divide them, but that would have been pretty boring probably.Just how could anything interesting happen in a dormitory full of guys? At best, they might wake up early in the morning and decide to play soccer or something.Therefore, there weren\u2019t any seperate dormitories for narrative purposes, not practical ones. I didn\u2019t have to come up with realistic settings, just one\u2019s I could use easily. So it became an integrated dormitory for this writer\u2019s convenience.Anyway.I didn\u2019t feel much when I entered the room of my classmate who was only a little kid from my point of view.There was a 100% chance that this girl didn\u2019t even think about the implications.I might have gotten kind of nervous if she was a college student. If that were the case, I probably would be stiff and stuttering.But even that wouldn\u2019t really work for me.All the Temple students only felt like little kids to me!I retrieved the basket of sandwiches from the gym and entered Ellen\u2019s room.As soon as we entered her room, she went straight to the shower room.-Shaaaaa\u2026.I heard the sound of water coming from the shower, as I put the sandwiches on a table and sat down on a chair.It wasn\u2019t much different from my room. Although the room smelled a bit different. Of course, it wasn\u2019t the smell of cosmetics or something.The room was clean, as she didn\u2019t really spend much time here anyway.There didn\u2019t seem to be many of her personal belongings in here. My room also was fairly empty, but not to that extent. Although, they might be on a similar level. I didn\u2019t have any personal belongings other than clothes and textbooks in my room either.Rather than personal belongings, this room was filled with training equipment, probably intended for strength training, installed on Ellen\u2019s request. Our private rooms were spacious, so there was enough space for various training equipments. I had something similar in my room. The detailed composition was slightly different, but the larger framework seemed to be the same.Overall, it was a nice room. The only thing that made one think that this is a girl\u2019s room was the slightly different smell.However, although Ellen only had few belongings, she did have some.In one corner of the room, the place where others might have their magic research table or something of that sort, there was a trunk. It was a rather long truck quite different from a normal one.However, that trunk, painted black, was tightly sealed. It wasn\u2019t that big, so it seemed easy to carry around. It was a long rectangular case.Although I shouldn\u2019t, I knew what was in there.This was the only thing Ellen Artorius brought to Temple.After waiting a little longer, Ellen came out of the shower room. She shook her wet hair and shivered slightly.She wore a training suit and slippers.Come to think of it, she always opted to wear either of those, so did I.Either the school uniform or a training suit.She sat on the other side of the table, facing me.\u201cLet\u2019s eat and then go sleep. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dWe started eating and stayed quiet as if everything had already been said. To be honest, the time I slept was the happiest time I spent these days, as my daily routine involved torturing my whole body.There wouldn\u2019t be something happening, like a teacher suddenly bursting in. If anyone came in here, they might misunderstand why the two of us were in the same room and strange rumors might pop up. However, Royal Class and Temple were almost devoid of students and teachers at the moment, so nothing should happen.We just silently ate our sandwiches.It took quite a while to eat all of them though, because I made a lot.-Craaash!Thunder echoed outside the window followed by the sound of rain falling. Ellen stopped eating her sandwich and looked out the window.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dEllen stared blankly out the window and continued to munch on her sandwich.Seeing her so different from usual was slightly disturbing. I wrote the festival period only from Ludwig\u2019s point of view, never from Ellen\u2019s.Therefore, I never described in detail what Ellen was feeling at the moment.So I didn\u2019t know how sad she must feel. Ellen stared at the pouring rain and the occasional flashes of lightning. Was she afraid of thunderstorms or did she like them? I didn\u2019t even know that much. However, I didn\u2019t think she was afraid.Ellen wasn\u2019t good with talking about herself.Only if the object hidden away in the trunk got revealed would Ellen\u2019s identity, which was only known to Bertus and a few teachers, be known.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah?\u201dI was a little startled at her suddenly talking to me.Ellen looked at me.That was also the first time she called me by my name.\u201cThanks.\u201dThat was all she said to me, while her eyes rested on me. She wasn\u2019t smiling at all, she also didn\u2019t seem particularly blunt either. She wore an expression that seemed to be between those two.I also felt like I was gradually becoming more proficient in reading her expressions.I still wasn\u2019t certain, but my proficiency would rise more and more.\u201cPeople sometimes feel like shit. There may or may not be a reason. That\u2019s just how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201dEllen stared at me sharply.\u201cStill, if you don\u2019t talk about it, it will eat you up from the inside.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t good to suffer in silence. Although Ellen had a blunt personality, she also had her own thoughts and feelings. Just like how she appeared rather easy going at first, but eventually got mad and ended up teaching me swordsmanship.Even the slightest bit of anger would sent me to a frenzy, while Ellen was able to maintain her composure no matter what.In retrospect, Ellen and I were direct opposites. And in my experience, people who were the opposite of each other would get along better than people who were similar.I talked too much and had a hot temper.Ellen spoke very little and had a calm temperament.In my opinion, that combination fit surprisingly well together. If two talkative people met each other, they\u2019d just talk each other to death, if two silent people met, they\u2019d just stay silent.She might feel like shit, but I wondered what Ellen was thinking when I told her that it would be okay to talk.Was she surprised I noticed that she felt depressed?Ellen, who had been silent for a long time, slowly opened her mouth while blankly staring at the thunderstorm.\u201cIf you could save the world in exchange for your life, do you think you should?\u201dIt sounded nonsensical.However, I knew the meaning behind that question.Ellen thought that death was death no matter what one died for. Her brother saved the world but in the end she was the only one left behind. People adored Warrior Artorius, but in the end all Ellen could do was mourn her brother\u2019s death.So, while Ellen did miss her brother, she also resented him.Knowing that, I also knew what to say.\u201cWell\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t know until the time came, I guess.\u201dAs long as I wasn\u2019t confronted with such a situation head on, no matter what I said would be meaningless.A person who said he\u2019d never do something like that, might end up actually doing it, and a person who said one had to make that choice, might not necessarily choose to do it.\u201cI\u2019d never die like that.\u201dEven if she had the option to save the whole world in exchange for her own life, Ellen said, she would never make that choice.She only had one life, and she said she\u2019d never give it up, even if that would mean the end of the world as we know it. I looked at Ellen and nodded my head.\u201cPossibly so.\u201dI knew that Ellen Artorius would risk her life for the world in the future though.* * *Ellen got up and walked towards the trunk. Without a word, Ellen removed the basket that contained the sandwiches before and placed the trunk on the table.-Click, clickEllen, who unlocked its lock, showed me the contents without saying a single word.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a sword. It looks quite unusual at that.\u201dInside was a long-sword type sword. It wasn\u2019t a too flashy color. It was simply black. Although that didn\u2019t mean it was just a simple sword.In addition to smooth lines seeming like blood vessels, there were also ancient characters engraved upon it.It was a language I shouldn\u2019t know, but I knew what was written on it. Just as I could read and speak this world\u2019s language, I could read even this language. I would even be able to pronounce it.I actually never described what characters were engraved on the sword, so it was actually my first time seeing them.[ Forged through tears. ]I didn\u2019t know what that meant, but I knew well what kind of sword this was.Ellen Artorius\u2019 Sword.And prior to that, Warrior Ragan Artorius\u2019 Sword.\u201cThis sword is called Lament.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis was a memento left behind by Ragan Artorius for Ellen before he participated in the Demon World War.The Warrior Artorius was known to carry two divine swords.The sword of Als, God of War, Alsbringer, and the sword of Mensis, the God of the Moon, Lament.Alsbringer, which Ragan Artorius used to defeat the Demon King, became the Empire\u2019s national treasure. However, no one knew where Lament was, except for those that knew about Ellen Artorius\u2019 existence. Later, when Ellen\u2019s identity was revealed in the novel, Lament\u2019s whereabouts were also made clear.Now Ellen revealed her true identity to me. Although it would be hard for someone to recognize the sword just by looking at it, everyone knew its name. Lament was one of the two symbols representing Warrior Artorius after all.\u201cNo wonder you were so strong.\u201dI, in fact, already knew about her real identity, so I was forced to act surprised. Ellen was satisfied enough with my reaction. She raised the corners of her lips slightly, creating a smile.She hardly smiled properly. My heart felt like it was being swept away.[Ellen Artorius has revealed her identity sooner than expected.][Achievement \u2013 Ellen\u2019s Truth][You have earned 500 achievement points.]In addition to that, I unexpectedly got some achievement points.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Ellen didn\u2019t tell me to keep her identity secret. It seemed she thought that it wouldn\u2019t matter anymore now that she told me. Maybe she also thought I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else.Of course, if Ellen\u2019s identity were to be revealed there would be a huge commotion in Temple. I wouldn\u2019t want that to happen, so I didn\u2019t intend on spreading this info around. Still, Ellen did seem to feel a little better in the end.Did she feel comforted knowing that she had someone who understood her feelings?The next day.-Aah, hello, dear citizens of the Imperial Capital.-I\u2019m here to introduce to you a fantastical item while you are all busy returning home.-Please have a look at this. We carved this wood and inserted a metal core. Yes, in technical terms, this would be called a spinning top.-But it isn\u2019t just any ordinary spinning top. It\u2019s a magic spinning top.-I shall show you all a wonderful magic trick now.I was on my way to the Al Ligar district taking the mana train. I saw some vendors from the Rotary Gang appearing on every train. The gang members seemed to safely evolve into vandors, showing great skills in marketing their products and saying a lot without much substance.Parents who came to look holding their children\u2019s hands reluctantly bought them toys.They did say their income was pretty good. However, this business wouldn\u2019t last long. The mana train was a public facility, but they couldn\u2019t just do as they pleased in here. There were quite a few passengers who seemed rather annoyed by all this even though they didn\u2019t dare to speak up yet.This business\u2019 purpose was to create a different profit structure to resolve the gang\u2019s dependency on the Thieves\u2019 Guild. However, Bertus suggested that it would be better for us to just absorb the Thieves\u2019 Guild. That plan was on hold for now though.\u201cHeey.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Yes?\u201d\u201cWho gave you permission to do business here?\u201dOne of the passengers finally started complaining, perhaps finally having reached the limit of his patience.It was a rather tense situation. I strongly advised Loyar to tell the vendors to avoid getting into fights in these types of situations. Fights should never ever break out.The man approaching the vendor looked rather disgusting.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that if I see you on this line again, I\u2019d whoop your ass?\u201dHowever, as I listened closer, the context of the situation seemed to be a little different from what I thought.\u201cTha, that\u2026. But we were here first\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh, when would that have been? We said we\u2019d do this place. Huh?\u201dWhat kind of situation was this?\u201cYe, yes. I\u2019ll get off at the next station\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t show your ugly mug in front of me again. Ya hear?\u201dI roughly grasped the situation.The flies started swarming after smelling some honey.\u201cSo there were bastards with no sense of morality like this, huh? No matter how illegitimate this business is, you just go ahead and steal someone else\u2019s way to make a living?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Wha, what?\u201dEven though I wasn\u2019t one of the vendors, I stood up and confronted him.\u201cYou, what? Who are you? What do you want, little brat\u2026.\u201dI approached that disgusting looking man. The passengers were staring blankly at this bizarre situation that seemed to be about to get out of hand.There actually was a passenger who clashed with this gangster without any hesitation.\u201cHey, jerk. If you enter a business late, shouldn\u2019t you do it quietly in your own little corner? Huh? If you enter such a business, d\u2019ya think you can just take your seniors\u2019 know-how and then piss all over their livelihood? You wanna fucking die?\u201d\u201cY,y,you\u2026. You punk, wha, what\u2019s wrong with you\u2026. Who the hell are you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m a student of Temple\u2019s Royal Class who happened to be an ally of justice.\u201dWhile attending school a student of Temple\u2019s Royal Class is treated as someone with a special identity, no matter if they were a commoner or not. If you were to touch one of them carelessly, there would be no end to the trouble you would find yourself in.The vendor, one of the gang members, flinched after realizing my identity.He didn\u2019t know me personally, but he seemed to have remembered that one of the gang members went to Temple.\u201cSure, you\u2019re from Temple. I don\u2019t give a fuck, you shitty brat.\u201dHe didn\u2019t believe me when I told him I was a Temple student.Thinking I was bluffing, that bastard immediately decided to give me some true education.He raised his right hand up high and swung it towards my head.-Woosh!I avoided the punch by slightly tilting my head.\u201cHave you gone deaf, you old bastard?\u201dI was strong.Stronger than that slimy bastard.\u201cHow dare you try to beat up a minor without any reason, huh?\u201d-Pang!\u201cUrk!\u201dI kicked him hard against his shin. I didn\u2019t kick him so hard that his leg would break, but it certainly pointed in a weird direction.\u201cMotherfucker, you think, just because I\u2019m a shrimp at Temple, I\u2019d also be a shrimp here?\u201dEven if one were the lowest ranked athlete in the Olympics, one was still a top athlete, you bastard!I was someone that sparred with the ace of the national team every day, you know!While I didn\u2019t have any skills, I won using brutal methods.However, now I could beat someone coming at me with brutality using my skills.These were the results of Ellen\u2019s accelerated education.The passengers were initially nervous when they saw a gangster arguing with a vandor.And then suddenly, a young kid stood up against that gangster, which confused them, and when they actually saw that young lad beat that gangster up, they seemed to doubt their eyes.My physical strength and reaction speed certainly had improved through the training I did so far. If I threw my supernatural ability into the mix, even clumsy movements would be effective in beating someone like that.Since he let his guard down, it was quite possible for me to make him to land on his ass with just a single kick.Since I didn\u2019t want to do something as risky as brawling more with an adult, I threw him out at the next station.\u201cOoh!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you off for now, consider yourself lucky. If you were unlucky, you might end up eating food through a straw, you get me?\u201dHis eyes were as big as saucers as I threw him out. That situation just seemed ridiculous to him.The passengers were staring at me as if I was a monster.\u201cSigh.\u201dI didn\u2019t mean to interfere.However when I saw that guy trying to take away our business, I changed my mind.I thought I\u2019d only ever beat up some guys in Temple.I was becoming more and more like some sort of bastard, now that I had the grounded confidence provided by my supernatural power. The gang member was puzzled seeing me here.\u201cPlease, tell big sis that I\u2019ll stop by later.\u201d\u201cA,ah\u2026.Ye, yeah.\u201dBring it on, you bastards.Who were they to try and take away our livelihood?My temper had been triggered, and I kept on growing more angry. People avoided me that day.* * *After getting off the train, I changed into clothes I had prepared beforehand and changed my appearance with Sarkegaar\u2019s ring. It seemed that no one was tailing me, but I should be getting tailed a lot in the future, so I tried making this a habit. My identity as a demon was problematic, but my identity as a Rotary Gang member wasn\u2019t without problems either.That ruckus on the train just now was still acceptable. Those two who actually knew my affiliation with the Rotary gang were actually the most dangerous to me, as they would keep an eye on me.Let\u2019s just live like water. I was already famous for being a delinquent in Temple, that wouldn\u2019t make me famous for that outside though, right?After passing through various alleys and side streets, I headed to the Al Ligar Shopping District. That Cutthroat\u2019s Paradise was still filled with the sound of breathtaking price negotiations.The battle of nerves between those that didn\u2019t want to be ripped off and those that wanted to rip them off went on like background music.When I entered Eleris\u2019 shop, I saw her sitting in the same position as when I first met her.She still had no customers.\u201cEleris.\u201d\u201cHuh? How do you\u2026.\u201dEleris was using a pseudonym in this shop, so she couldn\u2019t help but panic when someone suddenly called her by her real name.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cYour Highness?\u201dShe first wanted to question me, a stranger who knew her real name, but she soon realized who I was and jumped up from behind the counter. Then she came towards me, and locked the store behind me.\u201cHey, it\u2019s dangerous coming to see me.\u201dEleris spoke reproachfully towards me while I stood there frozen for a bit.\u201cI was really careful, so it\u2019s fine.\u201dI didn\u2019t get off at this district\u2019s station, disguised myself and came here using lots of detours. If someone found me even after all that, that person would have my praise.Eleris told me that she still didn\u2019t feel at ease and chanted something. Only after that she slowly nodded her head.\u201cYeah, it should be fine.\u201dThen she smiled brightly, as if that put her heart at ease.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I last saw you, Your Highness. How have you been?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. This and that happened.\u201dEleris went up to me and pulled my hand, saying we should slowly talk over tea.The vampire\u2019s low body temperature felt reassuring somehow.* * *\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dAfter hearing all of my recounts, Eleris\u2019 complexion, which was already quite pale, became even paler.\u201cOh, should I say it\u2019s like you were before\u2026. No, you\u2019re still doing better than back then, but\u2026.\u201dEven if I wasn\u2019t as bad as the original owner of this body, It still seemed to be very shocking.Well, of course it would be. I entered Temple with no backing whatsoever and ended up chasing around the other kids. Not only that, I even had a duel with my senior, which resulted in the other seniors taking note of meWell. For the Prince of the Demon Realm to infiltrate the Royal Class and actually turn into a star in a matter of weeks, sure was a headache, huh?\u201cI\u2019m not really into getting beat up without even putting up a fight, so I didn\u2019t just pick fights for no reason.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026. Just what should we do about that temper of yours?\u201dEleris sighed heavily as if all the world\u2019s problems were riding on her shoulders.\u201cStill, I haven\u2019t used this yet.\u201dI took out the relic Eleris gave me, the Flame of Tuesday.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief, but\u2026.\u201dI seriously wondered what would happen if I were to use this properly, but there had yet to be an emergency, so I couldn\u2019t use it yet. Eleris rummaged through something and asked me if I was hungry before she took out some food.\u201cWhat? You have food here?\u201d\u201cYes, I stored up some frozen food, in case you might come by.\u201dOh.She was so nice.Eleris heated the frozen pasta with her magic and presented it to me. It wasn\u2019t that delicious, but she told me that she prepared it herself, so this was something that went beyond just taste.Watching me slurp up the pasta, Eleris smiled faintly.\u201cBy the way, I could have never imagined you getting a supernatural power.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it is. It\u2019s like it was meant to be.\u201dEleris seemed rather confused about the fact that I had awakened a supernatural ability, then I explained more about my ability. I had a lot to explain as it was a rather ambiguous ability.\u201c\u201cIt\u2026. Seems to be a very powerful ability\u2026. Quite, uhm\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe mechanism of my ability to actually end up winning if I just kept a winning mentality seemed rather strange to Eleris.That wasn\u2019t all.I now had 2280 achievement points. I used up 20 achievement points during the duel to use the Revise Function. I got 600 points for winning the duel and after Ellen told me her secret I got 500 more points.Therefore, I could get a new talent. I couldn\u2019t have more than 1 supernatural power, so I was pondering about what talent to get next.Although I was growing quite slowly, objectively speaking, what I did was quite nonsensical.After entering the first year of Temple, I would be able to awaken two talents in less than a semester. People might feel suspicious of the existence of my infinite aptitudes, but it certainly wasn\u2019t impossible.At this point, it was rather hard for me to decide whether I should get a combat-related or a magic-related talent.Talking about Temple like that made me seem like a son coming home from a boarding school and telling his mother about everything he experienced there. Actually, Eleris\u2019 expression seemed rather similar to that of a mother\u2019s. Especially her sighs when she heard about the fights I was in.\u201cThat\u2019s all I got to say for now. Is everything okay on your end?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. There had been a few things going on.\u201dIt seemed like something had happened while Eleris was guarding the store.\u201cFirst of all, coming here was very dangerous.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201dThat was why I did such conspicuous movements by going around town in weird circles to shake off any possible tail I might have had.\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dHowever, at my words, Eleris just shook her head.\u201cIt has been determined that this was the last place Your Highness had been seen.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Really?\u201dI didn\u2019t know if it was Bertus or Charlotte, but my pursuers knew that I had come to this place. It was inevitable for me to come to this district to wander around here and sell my scrolls. A kid was wandering around here trying to sell scrolls, but most merchants just thought they were fakes. It certainly wasn\u2019t a common occurrence, so there should have been some merchants who remembered that incident.I originally planned to get some money and then go into hiding. Meeting Eleris was a pure coincidence after all.\u201cDid they come in here as well?\u201d\u201cYes. They didn\u2019t seem suspicious of me, but they do keep an eye on this place as this is the only place where they were able to find some clues.\u201dThe only place I was spotted at was the Al Ligar District\u2019s shopping street. That was the reason why the one\u2019s searching for me kept an eye on this place.It wasn\u2019t someone tailing me who was the problem, but the fact that the Al Ligar shopping street itself was already under surveillance, so that was why Eleris told me that it was dangerous coming to visit her.\u201cAnd then I heard about it.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cI heard that you stole a fireball scroll from a store\u2026. I heard it was from Mr. Borton\u2019s scroll store. I believe they got specific clues from there. Was it perhaps that scroll Your Highness was going to sell me?\u201dAh. I thought I knew what she was talking about.\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it, he gave it to me.\u201d\u201cWhat? Mr. Borton was so furious, saying it was you who stole the fireball scroll.\u201d\u201cThat bastard is really a gangster among gangsters.\u201dEleris didn\u2019t seem to know what I was talking about.\u201cNo, see, I was trying to sell Demon Scrolls, right? So everyone I was trying to sell it to thought they were pretty realistic fakes. That\u2019s what a normal person would think, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAll the others just told me to shut up and get lost, but do you want to know what that guy told me?\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201dEleris tilted her head.\u201cHe told me to copy real scrolls and that he\u2019ll pay me a lot of money. There would be no one as bad as that guy. I felt like I was stuck in a weird dream. so I asked him to give me a sample. That was that fireball scroll.\u201dEleris frowned a little after listening to my explanation.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026I never really thought of him like that, but he certainly seemes like a bad person. He even lied about that scroll being stolen\u2026.\u201dAs if genuinely disappointed in him, Eleris shook her head. No, I didn\u2019t think there were any decent people doing business in this shopping street, though? What was there to be disappointed about?\u201cPeople who buy these fake scrolls thinking they would save their lives might actually die. Just how did he think of that\u2026?\u201cMagic Scrolls were expensive. I still didn\u2019t know how much adventurers earned, but an Adventurer Party, which didn\u2019t have a wizard among them, bought scrolls like these in case of an emergency. So what if that scroll simply didn\u2019t work if such a crisis occured? They\u2019d die 9 out of 10 times.So that Borton guy was actually like an MVP among all the evil bastards of this shopping street. Eleris looked at me and smiled.\u201cWell done, Your Highness. Someone like that should be subject to a bit of suffering.\u201d\u201cNeedless to say, he just got overly excited and gave me that thing on his own.\u201dBlinded by greed, he couldn\u2019t see the forest for all the trees and gave me a fireball scroll. It was a real shame that his greed and intelligence weren\u2019t quite proportional. He was a scammer, stupid and would never amount to anything big.Anyway, since this was the last place I was seen in, I could understand Eleris\u2019 concerns.\u201cTch, I was planning on staying here while the school was closed.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Temple much more comfortable?\u201dEleris didn\u2019t seem to understand why I wanted to come to a place like this. I had this ring so I didn\u2019t have to worry about getting caught.\u201cIt\u2019s because you are here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. I, is that so? Thank you, Your Highness:\u201dEleris smiled and nodded her head.\u201cI confirmed that there were no people watching this place at the moment. So I think it would be fine for you to spend some days here, if you want.\u201dI didn\u2019t absolutely need to become a swordmaster or have supernatural abilities, or something.After all, the most convenient thing in this world was magic. I was trying to work out a plan before on how to convince Eleris to let me stay here for a bit, and I didn\u2019t want to just play around while Temple was closed.\u201cBy the way, about the Rotary Gang. Looking at that situation earlier, it seemed like there\u2019s a similar organization making their rounds. Do you know about this?\u201d\u201cIs that so? Loyar doesn\u2019t really tell us about the gang\u2019s internal affairs, unless it\u2019s very serious.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an organization they planned on creating anyway. It was just created naturally as they lived their lives on the street, so, although Loyar was in charge of this group\u2019s finances, she didn\u2019t seem to discuss the operation of the organization with the others.\u201cIt seemed like it\u2019s time for us to gather again.\u201dWe didn\u2019t hold something like regular meetings, but as I had similar thoughts I nodded my head.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61That night.\u201cYour Highness. Are you sleeping?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dI was lying on the bed and Eleris was sitting on a chair by the bedside. I felt rather complicated about falling asleep like that, but it wasn\u2019t like I hated that subtle feeling.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, do you have something to say to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEleris said neither yes nor no to my question. After being silent for a while, Eleris quietly opened her mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t think humans are better than demons.\u201dWhat was she talking about? Eleris was staring at me. The vampire\u2019s red eyes were filled with sorrow.\u201cIn the first place, Demons were a mix of many different races while humans had always been one singular race.\u201dI didn\u2019t know who was inferior or worse of. There were many demons with superior racial characteristics. However, while they were physically superior to humans, they might lack intelligence, and there might even be races that lack both. There would also be races that were superior in both these aspects.At my musings, Eleris shook her head.\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I mean.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI told you that I do not believe that humans are better than demons.\u201d\u201cOh. That\u2019s what you meant.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEleris seemed to think that it was more fortunate that the demon side lost, but in fact, she just didn\u2019t like war in general. Eleris was a traitor to the demons.\u201cHumans are a race that knows the meaning of prosperity.\u201dEleris must have watched the Demon Realm continuously increasing their arms, only thinking about war. However, humans were a race that was able to focus on life itself. When Eleris came to the Capital and saw this scene, it seemed that she didn\u2019t want this world to be destroyed.The Demon Realm was a world driven by just a single goal: A war with the humans, and Eleris simply didn\u2019t like that mindset.\u201cBut humans also fight and kill each other.\u201dHowever, humans also engaged in wars and slaughter among themselves. Eleris hated the Demon Realm, but she knew that even the Human Realm had such sides to it. In the end, did Eleris think that human society was the lesser of two evils?She didn\u2019t think humans were better than demons.\u201cSo sometimes there are moments when I get fed up with the human\u2019s wickedness.\u201d\u201cLike with that swindler?\u201d\u201cYou could use that as an example, yes.\u201dSomeone who played with someone else\u2019s life just for money. That could also be regarded as a great example for the wickedness of human beings. But Eleris didn\u2019t seem to talk about that.Eleris was silent for a while.What was she thinking about? Eleris was still trembling.\u201cYour Highness\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cTomorrow\u2026. You\u2019ll find out tomorrow\u2026.\u201dWas she unable to tell me herself? She didn\u2019t say anything more to me.* * *The next day.I went to the Rotary Gang with Eleris. The meeting place was the same as before. A large cavity inside the drainage channel.It had rained a while ago, so the sound of running water was noisily echoing around the cavity.Loyar was silently staring at the bonfire. I contacted her in advance. Sarkegaar had also arrived. While Eleris was busy applying sound proofing magic, Sarkegaar approached me and hugged me fiercely.\u201cI always believed it! I always believed Your Highness would awaken a powerful ability! You have inherited the bloodline that possesses every quality found in this world! I hope that you will dedicate yourself to training, grow as fast as possible and rain the wrath of the Demon Realm on those cowardly humans\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so loud. I think my ears are going to bleed.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dHe was always such a talkative guy. I thought it would have been more effective if that guy had that winning mentality supernatural power. He still believed that I would become the great overlord of the Demon Realm. Well, for now I\u2019d just stay still.I didn\u2019t have to say twice that I had awakened a supernatural ability, because Eleris convened a short meeting yesterday and delivered the rough details to them.\u201cDon\u2019t you think, you stand out too much? I heard you were going around, beating up students and you even went ahead and had a duel?\u201dI was dumbfounded by Loyar\u2019s words.\u201cIf one sows wind one shall reap a tempest, you know? He was such a cowardly bastard. \u00a0So I just had to stomp his face into the ground.\u201dWhen I described how I made that guy surrender, Loyar\u2019s and Eleris\u2018 expressions were quite a sight.\u201cYou were also born with the wonderful qualities of a monarch. That ruthlessness! Such pride! Such a strong fighting spirit! All of them are virtues of a great monaaaaaarch!\u201d\u201cOh! That\u2019s the stuff!\u201d\u201cYour Highneeeeeeess!\u201dWhen I responded to his rhetorics this time, Sarkegaar decided to express his admiration with his whole body.\u201cI\u2019m just worried that you\u2019re relying on violence too much\u2026.\u201dAs Eleris said so, Loyar also let out a sigh.\u201cAnd I head you beat up a gangster on the mana train yesterday.\u201d\u201cA gangster?\u201dEleris\u2019 eyes widened as if that was the first time she was hearing that. I didn\u2019t tell her because I thought she\u2019d just nag me. It seemed like Loyar wanted to nag me for what I did outside as well.However, I also had something to say about that.\u201cNo, if one wants to get into someone else\u2019s business, wouldn\u2019t it be up to them to find a different area to start? But there that bastard was, trying to sit down in an already made bed. No matter how immoral the business, if someone tried to take away someone else\u2019s business, they still had to pay the price.\u201dThat idiot just came and said: \u201cFrom now on we\u2019ll do this here, so shut up and get lost!\u201d No fucking way would I let that happen.Loyar stared at me with wide open eyes.\u201cEven though you do have a supernatural ability, but I have to say, Temple\u2019s education\u2019s pretty great. You\u2019ve been there for only some time and you\u2019re already able to defeat a grown man.\u201dWas she being sarcastic right now? Did she mean I only learned how to fight at school? Huh? Right?\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dTo put it bluntly, there\u2019d be no way for someone who studied at the best mixed martial arts center of the world to get beat up by a simple street fighter, you know? Of course, I also had my supernatural ability and my opponent was really careless.Of course, they\u2019d still be pretty young, but those Royal Class\u2019 5th\u00a0and 6th\u00a0years with combat talents would be able to beat up anyone that came at them when they entered society. Even if the reason was part because of their talent, Temple wouldn\u2019t raise them sloppily either.\u201cAnyway, how come you tell us not to fight those guys, but you end up fighting them?\u201dI told them to not fight on the train because we\u2019d have to stop doing business if they were to come up with sanctions.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that you should leave those robbers alone. Who told you to hold it in while someone was casually trying to steal your business?\u201dIf someone were to be about to steal something from you, you should properly defend yourself.\u201cSo, does this happen a lot?\u201dWhen I sat down next to her and asked, Loyar nodded.\u201cOur gang started a new business and it seemed like there were rumors circulating that it was going pretty well. So there were either those who didn\u2019t care or those who started to copy it.Mana trains were public spaces, so it was unavoidable that a certain group of people saw our guys sell things there. So, seeing that, it was only natural that they\u2019d start thinking: \u201cHuh? Should I try doing that as well?\u201d.Hence, there were some who started doing it individually and some who started doing it on an organizational level.\u201cSo those who are part of organizations usually plant some people on\u00a0 the train to drive other vendors away.\u201d\u201cBrilliant bastards\u2026. Like that they shut down this business altogether.\u201dIn fact, it was already bad enough that there were people placed on the trains who purposefully try to scare away others. If the other passengers started to file complaints, it would only be a matter of time before security guards were deployed. Then no one would be able to do business there anymore.Those who tried ruining their competition would eventually end up ruining the whole business. I told Loyar before that they shouldn\u2019t fight, so it seemed like she was just observing the situation.She was always complaining, but didn\u2019t she actually follow my orders quite well? Was she a real dog?\u201cIs it possible to track down their organizations and destroy them?\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe that the various vendors on the mana train would have some sort of power fight. Only these types of absurd situations were happening around me recently.\u201cIt won\u2019t work\u2026. To begin with the gang members aren\u2019t any good in a fight.\u201dHomeless people and beggars gathered here and even if they were capable to do bad things in order to stay alive, they weren\u2019t a match for organizations that gathered actually powerful people.\u201cIn the end, I would have to make a move , but as you know, it\u2019s already pretty well known that I\u2019m form this place. If I were to destroy every single one, that might cause some friction with the guards, and if I were to be taken in that might have negative consequences for you as well.\u201dLoyar was a Lycanthrope after all. If she were to be caught by the guards, chances were high that that would cause problems, and if it did, those problems would eventually lead to me. Bertus said he\u2019d look after me, but if Loyar was found out to be a demon, this situation would certainly turn rather strange.\u201cHmm\u2026. This is difficult.\u201dEventually, those violent gangs will try to monopolize this business to the point where they catch the attention of the guards, which would lead the entry of vendors to be completely blocked.If we continued to sit on our hands, we\u2019d find ourselves out of business soon, but if we took action, that would involve a huge risk.\u201cCan\u2019t you do something with magic?\u201dI asked Eleris if she couldn\u2019t do something with magic, that universal cheat. She answered immediately.\u201c\u2026First of all, I don\u2019t particularly like violence. Furthermore, if violent incidents using magic occurred, they would get investigated more intensely and the sanctions would also be much higher compared to just a simple gang war. Another method would be to make them my kin, but as I said before, that would be rather dangerous.\u201dIf someone were to commit assault or murder using magic, the Empire would obviously conduct intensive investigations. Magic was a dangerous force that could lead to massacre if left in the wrong hands after all. Likewise, turning them into Eleris\u2019 kin would be even more risky.\u201cYour Higness. If you plan on killing all of them, you can leave it to me.\u201dSarkegaar stared at me with sinister smile on his lips. Certainly, he had the ability to completely transform, so he\u2019d be able to attack the gangsters without leaving a single trace.Of course, Eleris\u2019 face immediately turned blue.\u201cAre you going to cause a genocide in the middle of the Empire? Regardless of whether that would actually work or not, I\u2019ll never allow that.\u201dMoreover, hearing that guy use the word \u201ckilling\u201d so casually was seriously eerie. At times like these I felt like he was a real bastard, giving me goosebumps.Even if they were sickening, that didn\u2019t mean they deserved to be killed. Still, we needed to do something\u2026.\u201cHm.\u201dWhile we were thinking about this problem, Loyar suddenly stood up. Then she started heading out of the cavern.\u201cWhat? Where are you going?\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a commotion outside. I\u2019ll go take a look real quick.\u201dA commotion?* * *Sarkegaar and Eleris stayed behind in the cavern, while Loyar and I, who was part of the Rotary Gang, went out. Eleris told me to just stay with her, but I felt like I had to check what was going on outside.Going outside, I could see all the gang members gathered together. As I pushed through the crowd, I found myself in front of Daibun.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cBig sis? Oh, Reinhardt? When did you get here?\u201d\u201cJust now.\u201d\u201cNever mind. Who are they?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201dAcross our gang members, stood dozens of men staring at us.\u201cThat\u2019s him, bro!\u201dAnd, a guy that seemed quite familiar to me pointed at me. Obviously, he was that asshole that wanted to touch one of our gang members on the train, but then got beat up by me. The guy whom he called \u2018bro\u2019 hit that idiot\u2019s head and shouted at him.-Pa!\u201cUrk!\u201d\u201cYou frickin bastard. You were beaten by a kid like that?!\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2026. Even though he looks weak, he\u2019s actually hella strong!\u201dIt seemed like he guessed I was a member of the Rotary Gang and came all the way here to get revenge. Loyar looked at me with a reproachful look as if I caused some exceptional mess.The one they called bro looked at me and then at Loyar.\u201cAre you the famous Irene\u2019s Wild Dog? This is our first time meeting, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. What\u2019s your business?\u201d\u201cI heard that your young friend over there hit my brother in front of everyone. Is that right?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s what I heard.\u201dLoyar was staring at him intently as if she wanted to say: \u201cSo what?\u201d.\u201cAlthough I do believe that this idiot who ended up getting beat up by a young kid is at fault here\u2026. We also have something called a face.\u201d\u201cWho are you supposed to be anyway?\u201dAt Loyar\u2019s question, he clapped in an excessive manner. What a bad guy.\u201cAh, sorry about the late introductions. Have you heard of Seven Stars?\u201dWasn\u2019t\u00a0Seven Stars\u00a0a cigarette brand?No.\u201cI\u2019m Argent, the commander of Seven Stars\u2019 Assault Squad.\u201dNot that Seven Stars. Were they supposed to be the Chilsung-pa?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Looking at that guy who introduced himself as Argent, commander of the Seven Stars\u2019 Assault Squad, Loyar sighed slightly.\u201cThe Seven Stars Gang based in the Al Ligar district? Yeah, I\u2019ve heard of them.\u201dThe Rotary Gang was an information-gathering group. Therefore, it seemed that they already knew about that organization called the Seven Stars.So, I beat up a member of the Chilsungpa, who are active in the Yongsan District, on the train.\u201cThen you should know what would happen to someone who assaulted a member of the Seven Stars, right?\u201d\u201cWell, it sure is a shame though. This all happened because the Seven Stars\u2019 members are just too weak that they even get beat up by a kid.\u201dHaving no intentions to apologize to them, Loyar spoke quite sarcastically. Hearing her words, Argent\u2019s as well as his other members\u2019 expressions distorted into an ugly grimace.\u201cAh, he was so weak that he tumbled right out of the train.\u201dOf course, I couldn\u2019t stand that guy either, so I butted in a bit. He\u2019ll regret it if he was going for a deal here.\u201cHah\u2026. I guess you don\u2019t quite understand the situation here. Don\u2019t you take the Seven Stars\u2019 members too lightly? I came here to talk it out to give you some face, but I guess\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t quite get the situation, you bitch.\u201dWhen I suddenly swore at that guy without hesitation, not only the gangsters\u2019 across from me, but Loyar\u2019s pupils slightly shook.\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cDid you come here knowing that I was a student of Temple\u2019s Royal Class fully supported by the Empire?\u201dAs I kept on rambling, my thoughts jumped into a completely different direction.\u201cTemple?\u201dHe might not know about the Royal Class, but there was no one in the Imperial Capital that didn\u2019t know what the word \u201cTemple\u201d meant.\u201cOh, yeah. You might not believe it. but yeah, I\u2019m a student with supernatural abilities, so I entered the Royal Class.\u201dI smiled looking at them with my arms crossed.\u201cDid you know that you\u2019d get locked up for touching even ordinary Temple students for no reason? But I\u2019m actually part of an Elite Class.\u201dTemple students were basically from very wealthy families or families of high status. Therefore, Temple students weren\u2019t only guaranteed certain special treatment inside of Temple but even outside of it, and their absolute safety inside of the Capital was taken very seriously.The Empire was most careful about the students\u2019 safety, as them coming to harm or being murdered would put major scratches on Temple\u2019s reputation and reliability.So what would they do if a student of Royal Class, who they nurtured with all their might, came to harm?I walked towards them and held out my cheek.\u201cHey, hit me.\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re curious about what the guards would do with that organization called Seven Stars or whatever, after you dared to slap a Royal Class student, go ahead, hit me, bitch.\u201dI had no intention of fighting.Rather, I asked him to hit me. I even had the intention of holding out my right cheek after he slapped my left. More than ten of them faltered as I stepped closer and approached them.\u201cThe, these bastards don\u2019t have the means to send a child to Temple\u2026.\u201dArgent muttered in disbelief as I pulled out a metal card from my pocket.\u201cThis is a Temple Student ID card. Would you like to take a closer look?\u201dOf course, I had my Student ID with me. When they saw it, they seemed to be certain that I was a Temple Student even though they didn\u2019t know what the Royal Class was.Those guys would know well enough that they\u2019d shoot themselves in the foot if they harmed a Temple student.\u201cWhat sort of bastard are you?\u201dThinking he was angry, I saw him lifting up his hand to perhaps slap me.His judgement was flawed.The bastards who would never make it in life were the ones who threw their fists using their instinct rather than their heads. If one were level-headed, one wouldn\u2019t live like that.-Whoosh!I quickly lowered myself to avoid the incoming hand while quickly jumping up to hit his crotch with my knee.I used my trademark technique, Nut Cracker.\u201cKuh \u2026. Kuaaaark!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d seriously hit me just because I told you to?\u201dHe grabbed his crotch and collapsed to the ground.Was it because I got used to Ellen\u2019s attacks? His attack was very slow, so I didn\u2019t have to use my supernatural power to avoid it. Everyone was so dumbfounded they froze up for a while.\u201cLet\u2019s beat up that bastard!\u201dThe guys behind him ran up to me.-Pang!Suddenly, Loyar blocked their way and punched those guys running towards me square in the face.* * *There was no need for the other gang members to interfere.Loyar literally beat up ten sturdy men with her short figure. It took less than ten seconds for the situation to be sorted out.-Uh, uurg\u2026.\u201cUwah\u2026.\u201dNot only me, but the other gang members who were watching the situation were staring at Loyar, who was wiping her palms with a blank look on her face, as if they rarely got to witness something like that.She was so cool! Brilliant! Before I knew it, all the gangsters were already defeated.\u201cIf you think I can\u2019t take care of you guys, then you\u2019re mistaken. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t, I just didn\u2019t want to.\u201dLoyar trampled on that babbling bastard\u2019s, Argent\u2019s head and spoke cooly. Her saying that after having proven herself in this one-vs-many fight was hella thrilling.\u201cDrag them all inside. People are watching.\u201dLoyar thought those dazed bastards were a bad sight for those passersby, so she headed towards the sewers, telling us to bring them with us.The gang members picked them up from the ground and took them in one by one. Those that struggled got beat and tied up by the members. Daibun aside, the other gang members seemed like they couldn\u2019t believe that I overpowered the assault squad leader with a single hit, even if I hit a vital spot.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dLoyar seemed to ask me for my opinion. Though what she meant was: \u201cIf you start something, take responsibility for it\u201d.Yeah, no problem.I\u2019ll take responsibility, alright.\u201cHey.\u201dI looked at Argent, who was still writhing in pain even while tied up.\u201cUrg\u2026. How dare you, you brat\u2026. Do you think you\u2019ll get away with this\u2026?\u201dIt seemed like he still didn\u2019t understand the situation. They were probably planning to take further revenge.\u201cJust take it easy, okay? You\u2019re pretty ignorant, aren\u2019t you? You were trying to beat up a noble just now.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to know what it meant to touch a Temple student, so I tried to explain it in a way even idiots would understand. Even if our status was a little different from actual nobles, Temple guaranteed their students the same level of safety a nobleman of the Empire would enjoy.So he basically tried to hit a noble. Hearing those words, his expression turned weird. He didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was trying to tell him.\u201cHow about I just go up to the guards patrolling around the streets and testify that some group called Seven Stars from the Al Ligar District tried to attack me? I have no idea what you guys have been up to up until now, but I doubt you did anything you could be proud of. So, do you have any idea what would happen next?\u201dI wasn\u2019t completely sure where that organization Seven Stars was located in the Yongsan District, but Loyar or Daibun should know. This was an information collection group after all.Then the dude seemed to realize that trying to beat up this naughty bastard, which was me, was meaningless, even if he tore apart this whole organization.Presumably, there was the possibility that the guards would launch an investigation into Seven Stars just by my request. I wasn\u2019t just a regular student, I was part of the Royal Class. The mere fact that I encountered danger in the Capital would have the guards on high alert.If I died, that would literally be a disaster.And they were an illegal gang to begin with, right? So the guards would try their hardest to catch these guys no matter what. Partly to improve their performance evaluation.That guy just wore a bitter smile, not knowing what to say. I didn\u2019t know if this was a matter of pride or something.I just put my hand on the tied up man\u2019s shoulder.\u201cStill, bro, it\u2019s a society we live in after all. Right?\u201dNot only that guy, but Loyar as well, seemed sullen after hearing me say that it was a society we had to live in together. It seemed like they wanted me to quit spouting bullshit and get to the point.\u201cWhat benefit would it have for me to ruin your organization using such extreme measures other than being able to do our business in peace, bro? I get it. I really get it. It\u2019s only natural that you\u2019d get angry if some young guy comes out of nowhere and swears at you while you\u2019re only trying to make a living. Now, I don\u2019t know how many people I can mobilize with my words alone, but if I told you it would be enough for dozens of people to mysteriously die, wouldn\u2019t that be rather scary?\u201dSuddenly, his expression started to twist strangely, while I was acting like an adult. No wasn\u2019t that even more annoying? Some high schooler patting his shoulder after kicking him in the balls and saying that he understands everything?However, the important thing was the part where I could send everyone to jail or get them killed with just a single word.\u201cIf you agree to this simple thing, I could just let this go. Let\u2019s just forget about each other, huh? Let\u2019s just live in peace, in peace. We just want to do business without anyone\u2019s interference. Look over there.\u201dI pointed to the water flowing down the drain. The water running in this water way flowed back into the Irine river.\u201cHonestly, if we just hang a big rock on your legs and throw you in there, no one would ever find you until the end of time.\u201dWhen I told him that it was an easy thing to just kill him with a smile, his expression became quite a sight.\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do that. It\u2019s rather inhumane, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThen I softly whispered, my hand not leaving his shoulder.\u201cSo. If you put your hands on our business again, it\u2019ll be the guards that will come visit you, not the Rotary Gang. Even if the guards didn\u2019t make a move, that wouldn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019ll be enough if our big sis came over, right? You saw it earlier, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m 100% sure that she\u2019ll be able to beat you all to a pulp, whether it\u2019s 10 or 100 people coming at her. But don\u2019t feel too disappointed. If we have the chance later, we might be able to talk about something more constructive. We started on a bad foot, but why can\u2019t we use this opportunity to turn this a beneficial relationship? Huh?\u201dHe ignored me at first because I was a young boy, but now he seemed to pay attention to what I had to say.After I threatened him with murder and the destruction of his organization, he instantly nodded at my words with a bizarre expression decorating his face.He might have thought that I bluffed about the guards, but he just witnessed Loyar\u2019s overwhelming fighting skills.\u201cO\u2026.Okay\u2026.\u201dI got up from my crouching position and patted him on the shoulder.Loyar and Daibun looked at me, seeming like they heard my rambling.\u201cLet them go. He probably learned his lesson.\u201dAt my commanding words, Loyar and Daibun just blankly nodded their heads.* * *After solving this commotion, we returned to the bonfire, when a dumbfounded Loyar suddenly asked me something.\u201cYour Highness, do they teach you eloquence at Temple?\u201d\u201cHuh? Not really.\u201dLoyar, who just saw me bewitch someone with words alone, seemed to doubt my words. I wonder if I was just some run of the mill bully in the past.\u201cSometimes I feel like you are a completely different person.\u201d\u201cWell, I might as well be. I don\u2019t even know what the old me was like.\u201dLoyar smiled bitterly at my calm response. So what if I became like a different person? I was still an Arcdemon, after all.\u201cBy the way, you do understand, right? If you were able to move the guards, wouldn\u2019t it be better to do so? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s no possibility of them retaliating.\u201dLoyar was right. There was a good chance that they might come again to seek revenge or something else entirely.\u201cIf they really were that stupid, that would be rather scary. Tell me if you see any signs of them making a move.\u201dThere might be some people who just didn\u2019t understand simple words. I thought that guy would not try to hit me after I told him the facts, but he actually went for it. This was a good learning opportunity. I was able to realize that there might be some people among the powerful who just wouldn\u2019t be able to think calmly. Well, I didn\u2019t actually get hit, but ripped that guy a new one instead though.However, if they were able to understand what I tried to convey to them, there wouldn\u2019t be a need to call the guards on them. There was some reason for taking this risk.\u201cI don\u2019t know what might happen in the future, but they might become part of a bigger picture later on. That\u2019s why I left them be. How should I describe them? They are just a sketch for now, so to speak.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that bigger picture you\u2019re talking about?\u201dI grinned at Loyar\u2019s question. The bonfire came into our view..\u201cI haven\u2019t made a decision on that yet, but I might have to absorb all the dark forces of the Imperial Capital in the future.\u201dI haven\u2019t made a decision yet, but I might have to do it one day.I wouldn\u2019t be on the level of the Thieves\u2019 Guild master. But If I do it, I would have to show Bertus a performance that would make him fall off of his chair.\u201cN, no\u2026. Your Highness, aren\u2019t your dreams a little strange?\u201dLoyar seemed to be shaken by my declaration to become the King of the humans\u2019 dark side, while being the Demon Prince. He said he wanted to be the King of the Capital\u2019s underworld, when he should dream of becoming a great Demon King.\u201cWho was it again who created an organization instead of doing actual spy work?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dLoyar\u2019s face turned red, as she reflected on herself.She didn\u2019t have any right to say that to me since she didn\u2019t even practiced what she preached herself.* * *We were away for a while, so Eleris and Sarkegaar were waiting in front of the bonfire. The two didn\u2019t need to come out. Eleris probably thought that Loyar would protect me no matter what.Loyar explained to the two what just had happened.\u201cYour Highneeess! A decisive and confident move! I can\u2019t help but admire your conviction, Your Highneeeeess!\u201dI somewhat expected Sarkegaar\u2019s reaction.\u201c\u2026\u2026Your Highness. Aren\u2019t you enjoying violence a bit too much? Still\u2026. I think you did a good job, letting them go\u2026. I think you need to learn how to be more respectful.\u201dNaturally, Eleris\u2019 reaction was also within my expectations. Eleris sighed and shook her head again as if she didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\u201cBesides that, he said that he let them go because he wants to take over the dark side of the Empire.\u201dAt that, both Eleris and Sarkegaar looked somewhat sullen.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say I\u2019m going to do it, it\u2019s just a possibility. I haven\u2019t decided on anything yet.\u201dIf there was a need for me to do it later, or when I feel myself mentally ready to do it, I would continue the conversation with Bertus, but for now nothing had been set in stone yet.Still, just thinking about these things was rather strange, no matter if I wanted to go through with it or not. Anyway, I didn\u2019t plan on doing anything like that for now.For now, we sorted out the gangsters of the Al Ligar District, but the other districts were still crawling with them, so this matter wasn\u2019t over yet.\u201cFor now, catching those acting individually would be difficult. Inform me about those acting systematically. Try to figure out how big their organizations are. After that\u2019s figured out we\u2019ll take action, no matter if it\u2019s me or Loyar coming forward.\u201dIt sure would have been nice if this could be resolved peacefully and not through a power struggle between organizations.\u201cWe can\u2019t be active on every train line anyway. Don\u2019t try to fight with newcomers, instead try to negotiate for a territory. That would be a good way to see if they are able to understand normal words or not.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dWe couldn\u2019t cover every place anyway. It might just be better to communicate and pass on our own knowledge to the newcomers so that we can do our business in a symbiotic way. However, we should never give up on the best routes.It sure was funny.Forcibly creating rights that we didn\u2019t even have and negotiate on territories we just claimed as our own without actually owning them. I feel somewhat weird doing those bizarre gangster-like things.I sometimes feel like I was actually managing an illegal organization.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about that for now. Do you have anything else to report?\u201dI looked at Eleris. Eleris somewhat made it apparent that she wanted to tell me something yesterday. It seemed like it was about human wickedness.She didn\u2019t tell me anything, only that I would find out today.At my words, all of their faces seemed to change.But all their expressions seemed to convey different emotions.Sarkegaar\u2019s showed hatred.Loyar\u2019s showed anger.And as for Eleris, I could feel sadness emanating from her expression.It was Sarkegaar who opened his mouth first.\u201cThere is talk about the demons who have been taken as prisoners of war getting sold on the Empire\u2019s black market.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What did you say?\u201dIt was something completely unexpected.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63A quest appeared as if it was natural.[Quest \u2013 Rescue the Demon Prisoners][Description: During the Victory Festival, Demon prisoners are to be sold on the black market somewhere in the Capital. As the Prince of the Demons, decide whether you want to rescue them or not.][Reward: 50 Achievement Points per rescued prisoner]However, to my surprise that quest was pretty good.The source of that information was Sarkegaar, not Loyar. Everyone couldn\u2019t hide their sadness.\u201cIt seems like there are auction tickets secretly traded among the nobility. Of course, the prisoners will arrive here through the Warpgate in time for the Victory Festival, so the auction hasn\u2019t started yet\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t quite understand why people would want to buy demon slaves, but it seemed like Sarkegaar caught some rumors about the black market auction tickets passed around among the wealthy.\u201cWhy would they sell demon prisoners on the black market? What are they going to use them for?\u201dLoyar answered my questions..\u201c\u2026\u2026It could be out of a desire to collect\u2026. Aren\u2019t those usually the reasons for people buying things in auctions?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, usually\u2026.\u201dThey would buy demons like Goblins and Orcs because they want to have them in their collection? Saying that these were usually the reasons\u2026.\u201cNo way.\u201dIt was then that I realized why they were making these faces. Eleris nodded at my absentmindedly spoken words.\u201cThe demons with the highest price are, of course, succubi.\u201dThe most sought after item was, of course, a succubus, and the reason why was really obvious. It was then that I understood why Eleris was talking to me about the wickedness of humans yesterday.\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m not quite sure, but succubi\u2026. wouldn\u2019t that be quite dangerous?\u201dIf my common knowledge was correct, weren\u2019t succubi the ones that stole a human\u2019s life force through their desires? But they want to buy a succubus exactly for that purpose? Did they want to die?\u201cSuccubi obviously take away life force, but there must be a way to indoctrinate them to prevent them from doing that or even surgical procedures, perhaps.\u201dThey were able to eliminate the aspect that made a succubus dangerous and turn them into slaves. So, they would sell completely harmless succubi, with their only means of defense removed.\u201cThe prisoners may not have arrived yet, but we estimated there to be a huge number of them. There aren\u2019t only succubi, but incubi and many other races that would make hot commodities for others as well.\u201dI nodded with a firm expression on my face at Sarkegaar\u2019s words.Dyrus thought that most of the captured demons would be killed and so did I. But there was no end to human greed. They were literally trying to sell humanoid demons that were almost indistinguishable from humans like that.They were only of a different race, and yet they got sold on a slave market.In the original, I wrote that there weren\u2019t things like demon zoos. Considering this, that meant there might have been people who raised monster-type demons in some dark place I had no idea about. These things never reached the surface world at least.And it was clear that the ones who got sold would be used for sexual purposes.Loyar, Sarkegaar and Eleris all wore different expressions, but they all held similar emotions.\u201cSo, do you want to rescue them?\u201dAs I asked them that, all three had sombre expressions on their faces.Sarkegaar shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s excruciating to watch those human bastards\u2019 behavior, my lord. But I know the weight of our situation. It\u2019s saddening, but if we go out to save them and we fail, not only will their anger fall onto us, Your Highness would also be at risk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I think the same. Of course, they might not harm Your Highness, but we are the only three demons who can support you. If we lose even one of us, we\u2019d suffer a lot more by having a weakend foundation.\u201dLoyar didn\u2019t want to admit that what Sarkegaar said was right, but she had no other choice but to agree.\u201c\u2026\u2026I agree.\u201dEleris also nodded her head while slightly biting her lip.All three of them wanted to save the captured demons, but they had a much more important goal than that. My safety.If it weren\u2019t for me they would have jumped in to rescue the demons like moths flying into open flames, as the Demon Realm had collapsed anyway, and they just couldn\u2019t stand seeing the humans\u2019 shameless behavior.They were three demons that didn\u2019t even appear in the original.That said, if I wasn\u2019t around they would have lived in a place completely unrelated to the main story. If I hadn\u2019t interfered, they would have lived their lives in places that had nearly no connection to the main plotline. Of course, there was also the possibility that they ended up dead somewhere along the line.I didn\u2019t know everything about this world. I knew the rough framework, but I had no idea about the details. I didn\u2019t describe passerby 1\u2019s life story, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t have one.They probably would have somehow entered the black market where the prisoners were being auctioned off and tried to rescue them.The plot of the original was just in it\u2019s very early stages. If these three demons actually infiltrated the black market held in a secret place in the Imperial Capital, were caught and ultimately killed while engaging with the humans to retake their comrades, the main character and his party wouldn\u2019t have necessarily known about these happenings. The beginning parts of the novel only dealt with the main character\u2019s daily life at Temple, which had absolutely nothing to do with events happening outside of Temple.The most that could happen right now was Delphine Izadra getting kidnapped while Ludwig was out playing with his friends and Ludwig somehow ending up rescuing her. Although it was said that the safety of the Temple students was the guards\u2019 highest priority, this was just too harmless an incident\u2026. I believed that the probability of such an incident happening was quite high. I didn\u2019t interfere much with Ludwig and his party, and Charlotte, B Class\u2019 anomaly, was at the Imperial Palace.Ludwig would have to run around to find his kidnapped classmate, while I had to find a way to save my people who had been taken prisoner.No matter how I looked at it, I felt like I was getting caught up in a more protagonistic plot line.The only problem was that this incident felt far from something out of a slice-of-life novel. Well, a kidnapping case couldn\u2019t be called the epitome of that genre either.I was just a high school student, you know?Anyway.Without me, those three would have tried rescuing the demons, and they probably would have failed. If they were successful, there would have been a huge commotion within the Imperial Capital about the demon captives having escaped.Now, I was their highest priority, so they were probably only carrying their resentment in their hearts, being unable to even try.How should I go about this?To be honest, I wasn\u2019t even an actual demon, so I didn\u2019t really know why I had to do this. I had no intentions of actually rebuilding the Demon Realm. However, I didn\u2019t believe that only humans could be counted as \u201chuman\u201d. Those three in front of me weren\u2019t humans, but in my opinion, they were no different from humans. And in the end, they were bound to be much more important to me than others simply because they were absolutely on my side.Demons possessing intelligence, who were essentially my people, would be sold into slavery in the Capital and would end up leading miserable lives.Regardless of those various concerns, it was true that I would like to do something if I were able to. If I rescued them, they would also be absolutely on my side.However, the risks were just too great. If these three got arrested or their identities were revealed, there would be a high probability that they would all die.I sincerely wanted to save them, but it was also true that I was hesitant about risking my life for them. Because I knew best that I wasn\u2019t that great of a person after all.That was why this uncle who was able to return back to high school was nothing more than a common delinquent who had a bit more guts than others, but overall just ended up being a rude brat.Just thinking about infiltrating that black market, where numerous millionaires and nobles were sure to be gathered, to rescue those prisoners, I couldn\u2019t even imagine a way to get out of there unscathed. Security would be tight, and we might not even be able to enter in the first place.Even those three, who were much stronger than me, would have failed.Everyone had gloomy expressions on their faces as they had to accept that they couldn\u2019t do anything. Because protecting me was their highest priority. They didn\u2019t want me to make a decision on this, they were merely reporting to me what happened in the Capital.\u201cStill can\u2019t we think about it a little more? Whether we should rescue them or not.\u201dNo matter what I thought, I only had those three who absolutely trusted and followed me. And now those exact three wanted to do something so desperately, I couldn\u2019t just tell them not to do it outright.At my words, I could feel a rush of emotions rise in everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201cNo, Your Highness. The safety of the supreme ruler should be our absolute priority. It certainly is heartbreaking and excruciating, but the weight of it is completely different.\u201dSarkegaar was still against it, regardless of his emotions. He was someone who put my safety and the future first, so it made perfect sense that he would say something like that.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I haven\u2019t decided yet whether we should do it or not, let\u2019s just see if we have any good ideas.\u201dI didn\u2019t even ask for Loyar\u2019s or Eleris\u2019 opinion and just said that we should talk about it at least. I certainly wouldn\u2019t even consider trying if only risky ideas would come up. If it\u2019s something that just can\u2019t succeed, that would be suicide.Eleris opened her mouth first.\u201cAssuming that you want to do something, there are three things you have to know beforehand. The location of the black market, the number of prisoners and their security.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIf we didn\u2019t even know that, we would just poke at bare ground. First, we had to know where the black market would open. At Eleris\u2019 words, Loyar nodded her head.\u201cAlthough we might be able to somehow find out, information related to the black market is high-level information that is spread secretly, even among nobility.\u201dThat was right. There was no way that information about the black market, which was only supposed to reach the ears of nobility, would float around the streets so it was highly unlikely that the Rotary Gang could gather that kind of information.\u201cI think it would only be right for me to find out these things, as it was me who brought this information in the first place, but we need a ticket to enter the black market first.\u201dAs it was a fairly covert market, one could only obtain information by getting a ticket. Sarkegaar could obtain information that only floated around the aristocratic circles. That was why he took on such risks to play the role of an imperial noble.\u201cHow much is a ticket?\u201d\u201c40 gold coins, as far as I know, Your Highness.\u201dThe entrance fee alone was already 40 million won. If one were to just go there to take a look, that would be a great loss, so they would try to bid fiercely to get at least something out of it. It was a psychological trick to make people want to spend huge amounts of money to not have wasted that entrance fee.\u201cOf course, currently we don\u2019t even know who exactly is selling the tickets, but I believe we can figure that out. Also, if you are fine with a bit of risk, we could steal the ticket from someone else and enter the auction in disguise. Of course, we first have to determine from whom we would take the ticket and what to do with that person after\u2026.\u201dIt was possible to get a ticket, but the problem was the money, and if we enter using someone else\u2019s ticket, there would be the problem of what we\u2019d do with the person we stole the ticket from. No matter if we use deception magic or hypnotic magic, we\u2019d still create a situation where a person who can\u2019t remember ever attending the auction actually attended.We still wouldn\u2019t know where the black market was, and we didn\u2019t know the number of prisoners either.So, who were those great people who opened that black market anyway?\u201cWhat about those who opened the black market?\u201dThat was my next question. At that, Eleris answered me.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing too difficult about that, Your Highness. It can be deduced that if a person was able to siphon off prisoners of war like this they\u2019d have a close relationship with the Allied Forces, because only then they\u2019d be able to take away prisoners to sell on the black market.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cIf information about prisoners, who haven\u2019t even entered the city yet, getting sold on the black market is already spreading, that would mean that this plan had already been made long before the Demon World Conquest Army returned.\u201dThe prisoners hadn\u2019t even entered the city or had been siphoned off yet.\u00a0 However, there were already rumors about the black market opening, albeit not far spread yet. Among those who have such shady desires\u2026.I nodded at Eleris words.\u201cThat means that there had already been talk with the side managing the Empire\u2019s prisoners. The soldiers part of the unit managing the prisoners probably have something to do with some sort of organization, correct?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even if not all soldiers at the commander level knew about this, any soldier with a rank capable of making decisions would surely know.\u201dIt would be impossible to siphon off prisoners of war without the permission of a commander or the leader of the prisoner management unit.\u201cDamn it, this is so high profile\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Although the Prisoner management unit may have some status different from the conquest forces, it was almost certain that someone close to the top was involved in this.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain possibility that it might even be related to the Imperial Family.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t rule out that possibility.\u201dLoyar nodded her head at my words.If left alone, they would be destined to be beheaded anyway. I couldn\u2019t deny that it was rather common to think of selling them on the black market and sweeping away the money of some rich deviants. Therefore, there was a certain chance that the Imperial Family itself was already planning to sell some on the black market. It was obvious that a lot of money would flow into their pockets after all.They might think that selling demons, who had their fangs pulled and weren\u2019t dangerous anymore, would be a much more viable business than just killing them.This black market might be an underground event to commemorate this festival held by the Imperial Family. Taking away prisoners of war was certainly possible for someone of commander rank, but it was still quite risky.So it was very unlikely that the Imperial Family was unaware of the matter of that black market. One could come to that conclusion simply by knowing that such rumors were floating about noble circles.In fact, Bertus and Charlotte might already be aware of this.\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure, but the people involved in this are just too high up.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t something so simple mere gangs could touch, including the Thieves\u2018 Guild. This was something planned by the Imperial Family, or a huge group with massive power.If so, then we\u2019d also be able to estimate the level of the security forces, the last thing we needed to know. I was sure it would have an incredibly high level of security.\u201cWe would have to circumvent extremely tight security, rescue the demon prisoners of whom we don\u2019t know the number of, and then hide them somewhere\u2026.\u201dNone of those three steps seemed feasible.\u201cWould that be possible with magic?\u201dIn the end, I had to fall back on that cheat again. Eleris shook her head as I gazed at her.\u201cAs it should be a place were a lot of important guest are expected to come to, they would have a lot of security measures. There probably will be wizards among the security personal.\u201d\u201cWould they be on the same level as you?\u201dEleris seemed like a pretty high-level wizard to me.\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure. All the forces of the Demon World Conquest Army, including the forces of the Empire, should have been seriously weakened, and there shouldn\u2019t be too many elite forces left. But their wizards could be of similar level to me, and even if they aren\u2019t mixed in with the security personal, I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t not expect that someone might want to interfere with the auction using magic. They might use an Anti-Magic Barrier. After all, they wouldn\u2019t just be concerned about someone rescuing the prisoners. They might be more concerned about someone moving the auction to their favor using magic.\u201dThere might be someone trying to use a large-scale hypnosis or hallucination spell or similar mental magic to make their bid go through. Magic was rather flexible, so it was quite ambiguous what one might try using it for. They should have installed some countermeasure against it at least. No matter if it was because of the prisoners or some other reason.What would those three even have done in a situation like this? It might seem that they tried to do something in the original, but they might have just recklessly attacked the venue as they weren\u2019t able to bear their anger anymore.However, even after thinking about it, it was still really reckless. There were only the three of them and things wouldn\u2019t really change much even if I was added into the mix.Did those three really jump right into something that was logically impossible to achieve? Did they go through with their reckless attempt even though they knew they would most likely die?If it was Sarkegaar, he would have immediately rushed in out of flaming rage, not having any hope of reconstructing the Demon Realm, and Loyar would have thought that something like that just shouldn\u2019t happen. I didn\u2019t know what would have happened in Eleris\u2019 mind that she decided to go along with them in the end. Although it did seem that she felt a certain sense of guilt towards the Demons.However, because of me, they didn\u2019t decide to immediately jump into the fire.It was almost impossible to infiltrate the auction house and rescue the prisoners, and even if we somehow managed to do it, where should we take them? Even if we succeeded there\u2019d only be problems, because we didn\u2019t even know how many prisoners there were.However Eleris, who had been immersed in her thoughts for some time, tilted her head.\u201cDo we have to do it while the black market was opened?\u201dHuh? What did she mean?\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be the worst time to rescue the prisoners while the black market was open, Your Highness?\u201dI then realized what Eleris was talking about.The moment the auction started would be when the security would be the strongest. So, we were more or less talking about jumping in recklessly while it was the most dangerous for us.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to start our operation before the auction started or after the sales were over and the demons got handed over to their buyers? There would still be some precautions taken before the sale, but after the ownership was transferred to another individual, they had to manage their slaves on their own, so I think it would be easier to get them at that moment.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. You\u2019re right.\u201dLoyar nodded her head slowly as if she hadn\u2019t thought of that before.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64\u201cThe auction participants will definitely pay quite the high prices for them, so even if they might treat the slaves poorly, they probably won\u2019t kill them. So I thought it would be better to steal them like that, rather than break into the auction house or raid it.\u201d\u201cSure enough\u2026. That seems to be more feasible.\u201dAfter all the prisoners were sold, they would be placed under the control of the individual who bought them. Like that, it could be possible to rescue them one by one using Sarkegaar\u2019s transformative ability and Eleris\u2019 magic.\u201cAs long as we know who bought which demon, we\u2019d be able to rescue them, although it would take some time.\u201dI was too focused on the black market and how to save them all in one go.It feels a bit uncomfortable thinking about the unspeakable suffering the demons who have been sold would have to suffer through, but\u2026. \u00a0Like that we\u2019d be able to eventually rescue them. The only difficulty would be to note down who bought which demon in a presumably anonymous auction.Eleris\u2019 method seemed very reasonable and less risky.\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to rescue all of them that way, but it sure seems a lot safer.\u201dSarkegaar nodded.\u201cHowever, rumors about the enslaved demons having disappeared or having gotten stolen would start spreading. In that case, the others would significantly tighten their security or hide them away.\u201dSarkegaar\u2019s objection also had some reason to it. According to Eleris\u2019 words, we would be able to rescue some of them with certainty. However, there would be rumors circulating about the demon slaves disappearing or getting stolen among the ones who attended the auction, so they would obviously place them under much stricter surveillance.In the end, there was no way of saving all of them. Of course, we didn\u2019t have to necessarily rescue all of them.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I think that would be the only safe method we can choose at this point\u2026.\u201dI also thought that among all the ideas we had Eleris\u2019 method was our best option. It was pretty safe and the risk was low. Even though Sarkegaar\u2019s, Loyar\u2019s and Eleris\u2019 plan had their shortcomings, they seemed to think this was their best shot at rescuing some prisoners as well.However, my opinion was slightly different. Whatever the outcome, the disappearance of the demon slaves was a completely different matter than just some black market auction items disappearing.If Eleris\u2019 method succeeded, that would lead them to think that a type of criminal organization stole the demon slaves, which would cause a huge uproar in the Empire. Just knowing that some demons were hiding inside the Imperial Capital was a huge security threat. That would lead to a huge amount of guards sifting through the city. News about that incident would probably reach Temple as well.However, I never wrote anything about the students being blocked from going outside because some demons disappeared in the Capital and one could never know when and where they would reappear.In other words, that method of rescuing the demon prisoners by stealing them would have little effect, judging by the future I know.Eleris would have come up with that method even without me around. Sarkegaar\u2019s and Loyar\u2019s reactions seemed like they couldn\u2019t think of any other method, so they obviously would have gone with that if they took action at all.That meant that Eleris\u2019 method failed or they got caught soon after they succeeded.The trading of prisoners of war on the black market would have happened whether I was there or not.Their rescue attempt would have happened no matter if I was present as well.Therefore, there was a high chance that Eleris\u2019 method would not yield any great results or would completely fail.I knew these three facts.I didn\u2019t know how that empty causality was filled, I only knew the end result.In the end, every method those three could come up with or perform would fail. Unless my presence inspired them to think of a new method.The only variable in all this was my presence.I could only come up with an answer on my own.I thought about using A Writer\u2019s Advice, but I didn\u2019t really want to use it because if I followed it I might end up in an even worse situation.\u201cDo you have any other ideas?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. I\u2019m thinking.\u201dEleris posed that question. She must have noticed that I wasn\u2019t much of a fan of that method because I was just listening without giving any input.Eleris\u2019 solution wasn\u2019t something I could have imagined. I could only think of the obvious, namely raiding or infiltrating the black market. Hence Eleris came up with the idea to carry out the rescue operation after the auction was over, and it also felt right to me.No matter how much I thought about it, I really thought Eleris\u2019 method was the best, but I knew that it wouldn\u2019t end well.It didn\u2019t matter why it failed. It was only right not to go down a path that would only lead to failure anyway. Of course, knowing why it failed would enable me to make some changes to it, but let\u2019s try to come up with some other methods first.First, I needed to check how far our reach would be.\u201cEleris, can you use the mass teleportation spell?\u201dThat was a large-scale transportation spell which I once used to leave the Darklands together with Charlotte.\u201cI can use it, but it takes some time to cast.\u201dSeeing that Eleris was already at the level where she could use this spell that would make her a highly skilled magician. Even teleport was already considered a super high-level spell, and she could even use it on a large scale.\u201cHow long?\u201d\u201cAbout thirty minutes.\u201d\u201cDo you have any Mass Teleportation Scrolls?\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201dThirty minutes.That was pretty long.Mass Teleportation scrolls were, of course, even rarer, so Eleris obviously didn\u2019t have any. I once again felt how rare those two scrolls I used in the prologue were.\u201cIt would be impossible for us to buy enough time to cast Mass Teleport on all of them after we reached the place where the prisoners are held. There probably are countermeasures against that inside the auction house.\u201dI nodded at Sarkegaar\u2019s words. They probably were the most concerned about theft, especially using magic.\u201cYeah, I guess so. But is it really that easy to prepare such extensive defense measures like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Your Highness. In the case of Temple and the Imperial Castle, such security measures were always in operation, but it was actually quite difficult to temporarily put them up and maintain them.\u201d\u201cSo I would be right in my assumption that places with barriers or defensive measures of a level where they could suppress spatial movement magic or the use of magic in general weren\u2019t a common sight?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dI found out another fact.Anti-magic measures would be temporarily applied to the auction house itself.The only places where such measures were permanently applied were the Imperial Castle and Temple. Of course, magic could be used inside of Temple, so they didn\u2019t use a barrier that would block every type of magic.That said, it was rare to find a place that had magic-related or anti magic measures applied to them.\u201cSo if the prisoners were kept somewhere else other than the auction house, you would be able to move them with a Mass Teleport spell, right? Even given the 30 minutes of casting time. So, how many people can you teleport at once?\u201d\u201cTwenty is my limit. If it\u2019s at night, I might be able to do fifty though \u2026.\u201dAlthough she was able to withstand the sunlight, it seemed that she couldn\u2019t access her whole power during the day. Twenty people\u2026.Just how many prisoners were there? It was so frustrating not knowing that. There should have been a huge number of them who got taken prisoner, but most of them would have already been executed.I hated to say this, but the demons that would get sold on the black market were usually individuals that had some commercial value to them.Succubi, incubi, and other humanoid demons I didn\u2019t know the race name of. I didn\u2019t think it would be such a huge number. I saw the prisoner procession when I escaped from the Demon King\u2019s Castle.Most of them were monsters.Loyar looked at me.\u201cAre you thinking of a different way?\u201d\u201cI know it might be a stupid idea, but I think the best time to do our operation is when the black market opens\u2026.\u201dStealing them would fail or have very little effect. I didn\u2019t have any eloquent method to convince those three why I thought like that.We couldn\u2019t use Mass Teleport inside the auction house where the prisoners were held. We somehow had to get them out of there so that we could teleport them away.Twenty by day and fifty by night.If we could get them out to teleport them, we wouldn\u2019t need to teleport in the first place. With such a huge guard force we would have to teleport them away as soon as we could.It was simply impossible for us with our current power.We wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201cIsn\u2019t the black market in itself illegal?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just a normal market, it was a black market, so it was a secret auction. Secret transactions between bastards backed by wealth and authority. It was completely different from the normal underworld.Eleris answered my question.\u201cThinking about whether this was legal or illegal would lead nowhere, because I doubt there are any concret laws relating to this situation. The sale of demon slaves isn\u2019t a common thing after all.\u201dSelling Demons was neither illegal nor legal. Loyar added.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s clear that the Imperial nobles who decided to buy or sell demons, who had been declared as enemies to be killed, would be heavily frowned upon, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cThere might not be any problems legally, but there were some moral problems with this, so there was enough room to criticize them.\u201dThat\u2019s why the trade of demon prisoners wasn\u2019t happening in a public place.Raiding the auction house was impossible for us. If we couldn\u2019t do it, how about we made someone else do it for us.\u201cWhat if rumors were to come out that a black market would open for trafficking prisoners of war in the private sector?\u201dAt my words, the expressions of those three changed. They seemed to ask me why I would do something like that.\u201cWouldn\u2019t enslaving and trading demons who were supposed to be destroyed undermine the prestige of the Empire and be worthy of the citizen\u2019s wrath?\u201dIt was rather self-evident that the citizens would be extremely angry if they knew that what the upper-class was doing wasn\u2019t in line with the justice they preached about.\u201cYou mean the citizens would be so angry that they might even go so far as to raid the black market?\u201d\u201cIf they were to find out where the black market was located, there would certainly be one hell of a commotion at least.\u201dThose who would attend the auction were by no means great men in fancy positions, even though they might be of higher standing. If citizens were to flood the black market and start hitting them, they would hurry and try to escape.Even though that wasn\u2019t a place the general public should know about, like this they would end up finding out about it. If they were trying to use the Imperial Family\u2019s authority as their shield to control the citizen\u2019s riot, they would be admitting that the government was supporting the sale of demon prisoners for money.\u201cBut if the citizens were to do that, wouldn\u2019t that mean that the Empire\u2019s forces would come out to suppress them? They might even just disguise themselves as military forces, so that they can use violent methods to do something about the citizens.\u201dAt Eleris\u2019 words, I nodded. If one found a clue, one\u2019s thoughts would unravel like a thread.I found a different solution from Eleris\u2019 for this complicated puzzle.\u201cIt\u2019s true that the Empire\u2019s power is piercing the sky. However, trade of the prisoners of war wouldn\u2019t only enrage the citizens, but would also go against the intentions of a certain powerful force. So I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s why they decided to sell them on a black market.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s that powerful force\u2026?\u201dI smiled and gave my answer.\u201cReligious forces.\u201dThey dispatched religious forces for the pure purpose of destroying evil. They were a very important pillar of the Allied Forces.At the moment, the forces that participated in the Demon World War of all churches were currently gathering here. And even after the Demon World War they would remain the most powerful group of Paladins and Priests regardless of their beliefs.They were called the Knights Templar.\u201cThe trade of demons in itself was already a great insult to the Knights Templar. So, there would be a huge backlash from all the religious factions from all over the continent.\u201dThe citizens weren\u2019t my main target. And since the Knights Templar were a religious group they wielded a separate power that wasn\u2019t under the control of the Empire.If those rumors were to spread, the Knights Templar themselves would come to destroy that black market.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65The Knights Templar were religious armed forces not under the control of the Empire. Therefore, the reason for their actions had nothing to do with the national interest of the Empire and was only based on their religious beliefs.The fact that we were dealing with demons that were supposed to get completely destroyed would cause a huge conflict between those two groups. And the citizens would be on the same side as the Knights Templar.\u201cIf the Knights Templar started to interfere, there would be a huge commotion, and eventually, the black market, the forces behind it and the auction\u2019s participants would have no means to object against them. In the end, they would have no choice but to hand the prisoners over to the Knights Templar.\u201dThe Empire would have to take a step back. They wouldn\u2019t oppose the Knights Templar just to make some money by selling demons.There was no justification for the Empire to intervene with the Knights Templar, so it would naturally result in that, no matter what actual power they wielded.It wasn\u2019t enough for them to just capture and kill them, no, they had to go ahead and actually sell the demons secretly. For the Knights Templar, who considered the Demon World War a sacred war, the actions of the Empire were already seen as an enormous betrayal. Religion was, of course, spreading throughout the Empire and its Principalities. Religion was, after all, a power that controlled people\u2019s minds. Antagonizing them was an option the Empire would never choose.Eventually, they would admit to their mistake or cut off their tail. Then the prisoners of war would be taken by the Knights Templar.In other words, my proposal was to destroy the whole black market in and of itself. Not using our own power, but somebody else\u2019s.Eleris nodded at my words.\u201cYour Highness, that will certainly deter the selling of demon prisoners on the black market. However, if we do it like that\u2026. All the prisoners would get executed without exception.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThis operation would just make the demons change hands from those who want to enslave them to the ones who want to kill them.\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re trying to get the Knights Templar to come, who\u2019d block any way for us to take the prisoners away?\u201dI slowly began to explain my plan. In the end, this was just another type of gambling.\u201cObviously, the Knights Templar would take the prisoners, \u00a0and they will surely be used as a tool for coercion. However, they would never expect someone trying to mass teleport the prisoners away. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be very angry. Of course, they may come in and slaughter the prisoners held in the auction house on the spot. However, as long as the prisoners are alive, they themselves were the living proof of the Empire\u2019s betrayal. They won\u2019t try to deal with them right away. They would use them as evidence to force an apology out of the Imperial Family.\u201dEven if they would eventually kill them, they wouldn\u2019t want to deal with the prisoners immediately. At the very least, they will keep them alive for a few days, while they had some talks with the Empire. Although it might be more like a type of crusade than a regular chat though.\u201cOf course, you might be concerned that the market organizers decide to change their location after they heard rumors about the Knights Templar planning on raiding the place. Actually, that would be even better. The substitute venue would probably just be a hurriedly built place. They wouldn\u2019t have had time to apply anti magic measures. The substitute venue would most definitely get announced to the auction participants. So, we really need a ticket.\u201dThere would be a high possibility that they wouldn\u2019t be able to prepare countermeasures against magic as they had to change venues as fast as possible. In that case, it would be easier to infiltrate the auction and Eleris would be able to use Mass Teleport to get everyone out.\u201cIf the Knights Templar take the prisoners, they will insist on holding on to them themselves, not the Empire. It wouldn\u2019t be any different in that case. We would have to infiltrate their place.\u201dIn the end, it was Eleris who had to use the Mass Teleport Spell.\u201cOr, well, there\u2019s another method. After figuring out the prisoner transport routes, Eleris could use her Mass Teleport Spell in a place we have surveyed before. So when the prisoner\u2019s convoy passes by, we could teleport them away and then run.\u201dWe could prepare the spell at a fixed place where the prisoners are supposed to pass by and wait, then intercept the convoy by teleporting the prisoners away. In the end, it all depended on Eleris\u2019 Mass Teleport Spell.There was a precondition to all this. Namely that the Knights Templar will take over the prisoners, but I believed that there was quite the high chance of that happening.\u201cRegarding the second option, it would be rather difficult to infiltrate the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters. Other than possessing anti-magic barriers, they probably would realize that I\u2019m an undead right after I set foot in their building.\u201d\u201cAs I thought.\u201d\u201cThe third option seems more feasible at the moment.\u201dThe black market changing venue would be beyond our control, so we could only react as things were happening.For now, it would be best to find out the location of the black market, predict the route which the Knights Templar would take to escort the prisoners away and wait for Eleris to finish casting the spell while on the move.\u201cBut in the end, we would only be able to rescue 20 people. The rest of the prisoners would die\u2026.\u201dIf there were less than 20 demons getting auctioned off at the black market, we\u2019d be able to rescue all of them, but if there were more, we\u2019d end up leaving the rest to die. Loyar, who had been silent up until now, opened her mouth.\u201cYour Highness, how about we use Warp Gates instead of Mass Teleport?\u201d\u201cWarp Gates?\u201d\u201cYes, it would seem that we\u2019d just have to somehow make the Knights Templar lose control of the prisoners for a bit after they took them from the black market. Like that we could save everyone by using Warp Gates, not just a few by using Mass Teleport.\u201d\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t that only be possible if there was a Warp Gate in the transportation route of the Knights Templar?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t think of that either. However, Warp Gates were only located in fixed places, so, as we didn\u2019t know the black market\u2019s accurate location at this stage, we wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with a detailed strategy.\u201cThere are a great many Warp Gates in the Capital, Your Highness.\u201dSince Loyar was running an intelligence organization, she couldn\u2019t help but know a lot more about the Capital than the three of us.\u201cEven in front of the Knights Templar headquarters, one of the major facilities of the Capital, was a Warp Gate.\u201dNo matter which way they went, they\u2019d eventually pass one of these fixed places with the convoy. There\u2019d inevitably be some Warp Gate on their route.\u201cYes, I see, that\u2019s plausible.\u201dIf we used a Warp Gate, we could save as many prisoners as we needed.\u201cSo when the convoy arrives before the Knights Templar headquarters we\u2019d just have to make a commotion and make the prisoners somehow run over to the Warp Gates. We wouldn\u2019t have to worry about them chasing after us through the gate. Eleris could just destroy the gate after we went through it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Good.\u201dEleris nodded while seeming slightly nervous.Warp Gates were two-way. If one of the gates were broken one couldn\u2019t warp to either of those places anymore.\u201cOkay. But we need to make a very thorough plan well in advance. Not everything would go as we think. First, we need to make sure the Knights Templar know exactly where the black market is so that they can find it. We can only hope that they don\u2019t immediately slaughter all the prisoners. We also would have to neutralize the troops stationed at the Warp Gates. We should also think of a way to distract the Knights Templar long enough for the prisoners to escape.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the disturbance.\u201dIt seemed like Loyar would take on that role.\u201cWill you be fine? You could die.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t have to fight against them, I just have to cause a disturbance. I might get hurt, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll also help cause a disturbance with my magic.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Loyar, Eleris would support her with her magic.\u201cI will disguise myself as a soldier stationed by the Gate.\u201dIn a way, Sarkegaar played the most important role. Completely taking over the Warp Gate.After sending the prisoners away through the Warp Gate, Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar would all jump into the gate and proceed to destroy the other gate to prevent pursuers to come after them. To return they could just use the Mass Teleport Spell.If we were able to pull that off, it would be perfect. However, since there were so many prerequisites, we couldn\u2019t know if some variable would occur to mess everything up.I didn\u2019t really have a part in this, but I\u2019d keep an eye on the situation and how everything was unfolding.Getting ready to use \u2018Revise\u2019 in the event of a crisis.* * *The three of them, except for me, tried not to do anything dangerous because of me, but, in the end, they would carry out that operation to rescue the demons under my instructions.It would cause a great commotion in the Capital. This was never a secret and safe task. Even if they succeeded, the Empire would be on high alert for some time after. I mean, there would be powerful high ranking demons having a fight with a someone in the middle of the Capital after all.Even if things went as planned, we would have to live in danger for a while, but if things didn\u2019t go as planned, one of the three of them had to be sacrificed. Everyone agreed.If any of the three were to get caught or it failed, they had to expect to die, and if my identity was in danger of being discovered they told me to use Sarkegaar\u2019s ring to escape.I didn\u2019t know if the captured demons were even worth this much or not.However, those three just couldn\u2019t bear seeing the prisoners, who were from the same country as them, live such miserable lives without even being able to die properly. So those three risked their lives for them. Even if I wasn\u2019t directly risking my life, as the prince of that ruined country, I was trying my hardest for them.It was something I shouldn\u2019t even have considered.However, just by deciding that we should rescue them and giving them detailed instructions, it seemed like Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar had already gained unbreakable trust in me.I had no idea if it was just because they were demons or because they were directly in the service of the country that they respected me as their monarch.They already acknowledged my absoluteness only because I was an Arcdemon, but from the moment I decided to rescue the prisoners they seemed to give me even more respect than before.\u201cYour Highness, thank you.\u201dSo that night, while I was lying in bed, Eleris thanked me over and over.\u201cIt\u2019s you guys who\u2019ll do most of the work, so why are you thanking me?\u201dThat was the truth. All I had to do was to use the Revise function to stop certain events from happening and realize events that shouldn\u2019t have happened in case of danger.\u201cI\u2019m thanking you for allowing us to do something as dangerous as that.\u201dIn the end, even if I wouldn\u2019t actually do much, I still allowed them to take action.Perhaps compassion wasn\u2019t something that belonged to the qualities of a king. If one viewed it as such, Eleris seemed to appreciate what I tried to do for them. If I cold-heartedly told them to just leave the prisoners alone, they would have understood, but they would have also been very sad about this.The funny thing was, seeing me allowing them to take such reckless actions and even coming up with a plan for them, seemed to have impressed even Sarkegaar who had a completely different stance from Eleris. Perhaps Sarkegaar viewed my actions as part of my attitude as a monarch who cherished all the demons of the Demon Realm.I still didn\u2019t know what stance Loyar had, but, in the end, she also desired to save the other demons. And there I was, coming up with a detailed plan, so it seemed like she was also impressed by that.\u201cAnyway, are you really okay with this? No matter what we do, someone might get hurt.\u201dEleris didn\u2019t like violence. However, she had no other choice but to use her magic to distract the Knights Templar. Just as those three were risking their lives to make this plan successful, of course, there was also the possibility that someone, whether they or the Knights Templar, would die or get injured.She might hesitate or make a mistake. That was my concern.\u201c\u2026\u2026I have taken away the lives of so many people already.\u201dEleris seemed dazed, her eyes closed. She looked endlessly sad.\u201cI\u2019m so used to it, that I\u2019m sick and tired of it.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t do it, she did it too often and much too well.I couldn\u2019t say anything to this sad Eleris, who told me that I had no need to worry.* * *The Festival started on Monday and Sarkegaar would also get the tickets for the auction then. That way we could pinpoint the location of the black market. They cost a huge amount, 40 gold coins, but it wasn\u2019t an impossible amount for us. I mean, we didn\u2019t even use the money we prepared for Temple\u2019s entrance fee yet. In addition to that, as Sarkegaar lived the life of a noble, he should have kept some emergency funds so that it wouldn\u2019t be completely impossible for him to maintain his lifestyle without the organization.That long Festival, which started on Monday, would run for an entire month.Monday.We were facing the streets of the Imperial Capital, already buzzing with a festive atmosphere.-Waaaaaaah!-Long live the Allied Forces!-Hurray for Atorius!-Hurraaaaaaaay!People cheered as the soldiers arrived from the large Warp Gate located in the Temtoan District, north of the Al Ligar District. An endless procession of soldiers kept on coming out of the Gate.A steady stream of them left the blue Portal and were marching towards the Imperial Castle.If we were to use the map of Seoul, then they started in the\u00a0Jung District\u00a0and went on to the\u00a0Jongno District\u00a0and people stood close to them cheering the endless parade of soldiers.The Knights and Cavalry on horseback arrived first, followed by the Infantry and other soldiers. They were all cheered for equally.Everyone sent endless cheers towards the Allied Forces, which achieved this miraculous victory in the Demon World War.Ludwig must be watching this scene from somewhere. There was also a high chance that Delphine Izadra was getting kidnapped by someone while watching the festive people celebrating everywhere and eating good food.If it didn\u2019t happen, well, that would be good then.A huge number of soldiers were walking at the same pace. A huge number of countries and groups participated in this War as the Allied Forces.They each carried a flag symbolizing their origin.The procession of this triumphal army would go on for an incredibly long time. They would be able to enjoy the honor of entering the Imperial Palace accompanied by the cheers of the citizens, as well as being treated with utmost respect inside of it. Those who earned merit would receive their due rewards.Among the cheers of this huge crowd, we chatted while keeping our distance from them.\u201cThe prisoners of war might arrive through a different Gate than the Victory Procession.\u201d\u201cMaybe so.\u201dWe weren\u2019t just here to watch this spectacle. It was a sight that made me lose my appetite anyway.The reason for me coming all the way here was to check whether the prisoners of war would be led through the same gate as the triumphal army. If they did, we could try taking them away at that moment.Even if we didn\u2019t do that, we could at least ascertain the amount of prisoners that got transported here. However, no matter how long we kept on watching, there was no convoy or procession that seemed to contain the prisoners of war.Since this was where the triumphal army passed through there might be a high chance that they would make the prisoners, who would cause people to frown, enter through a different Gate.\u201cEven if we succeeded, the only ones we\u2019d be able to safe were the ones getting taken to the black market, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe only ones we could save were the demons who had a certain market value and got sent to that black market.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66The other prisoners who wouldn\u2019t be put on the black market would probably be managed by the Empire, and no form of trickery could help us rescue them. I wasn\u2019t sure if the Empire would kill those prisoners or do something else with them. It was possible that they would conduct experiments on them for research purposes.No matter what, we couldn\u2019t save them. It would be absurd to even try to save them. Even the operation we were going to carry out this time was extremely dangerous.\u201cDid you say it was on Thursday?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSarkegaar had already bought the tickets.Today was Monday, and the black market would open starting Thursday. It would stay open for a total of four days, from Thursday to Sunday.The question was, were all those prisoners put on the black market? If they planned on replenishing the prisoners every day, we could only save a quarter of the demons that were planned to get auctioned off.\u201cI think they will probably have all of them there, but\u2026.\u201dThere probably were prisoners of war who\u2019d enter the Imperial Castle to be detained. It would be far more efficient to siphon off the ones they want to sell from the beginning, than take them out of there every day. So the auction would be held for four days, but the black market would keep all the prisoners they were planning to sell in the auction house.The best way they could go about this was to find out through which Gate the prisoners would get led and siphon them of immediately at that moment before detaining them in the auction house.There were dozens of Warp Gates in the Capital alone. It was impossible to monitor all of them.We didn\u2019t use the Rotary Gang to gather information for this operation. Only Loyar, Sarkegaar and Eleris would take action. Later, this incident might be seen as a terrorist incident caused by the demons, but if we used the Rotary Gang to gather information beforehand, that would just cause unnecessary suspicion.\u201cAs we expected, they\u2019ll come from the Badelz Gate, won\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I think.\u201dThe location of the black market was in the Badelz District, which was the\u00a0Mapo District\u00a0in my mind. It would open in the basement of the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters. In other words, the Merchant Guild had a solid relationship with the black market owners. That fact was a nice bonus.When I learned the location of the black market, I wondered why I didn\u2019t think of that sooner. That was quite the obvious place for it to be.The Merchant Guild must have big storage units for all the expensive goods they had to store, so it would be enough to temporarily accommodate the prisoners in these units equipped with enough security, safety and scale. Of course, it would be easier to proceed with the auction like that as well.I didn\u2019t know how deep the Merchant Guild was involved in this. However, they would have had to agree to this drastic move of opening a black market in their headquarters. They probably judged that they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop this business, which was supposedly linked with many people with great authority. Of course, they might have been coerced, but we wouldn\u2019t be able to find out that much.The venue was the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters. Even in my opinion, there wasn\u2019t a more suitable place to proceed with the black market auction. In addition, as many merchants were rather rich, they were likely to directly participate in the auction.Even if there were rumors about a black market opening soon, the chances that they would change the venue were remarkably low. Even after I thought about it quite thoroughly, I couldn\u2019t come up with an auction venue that would be more optimized than the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters.Since Sarkegaar was a noble, he wouldn\u2019t be able to come out of the Imperial Palace for a while because he had to attend the Victory Ceremony and Party.He decided to only attend on Monday for now, and would find some excuses to join our side from Tuesday onwards.The prisoners would most likely arrive through the Gate in the Badelz District, where Loyar was stationed.However, I and Eleris were keeping watch on the side where the Victory Procession was continuing on endlessly, just in case.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Monday evening.The vicinity around the Imperial Palace was rather crowded with people, and one could hear the sound of magic used as fireworks bursting from afar. It seemed like some wizards were putting on a fireworks display.As alcohol and food were distributed free of charge, the streets were full of people drunk on alcohol and euphoria. There were many people who didn\u2019t even know each other before, sitting together at tables placed on the streets, talking while hugging and dancing.Of course, the miraculous survival of Princess Charlotte de Gardias was also one of the hot topics. Although it\u2019s been some time now since the Princess returned, Artorius\u2019 bravery, The Allied Force\u2019s greatness and the miraculous survival of the Princess were still in everybody\u2019s mouths.There were also talks about the Princess becoming a supernatural power user.Charlotte was so preoccupied with finding Valier at the moment, that she didn\u2019t seem to concentrate much on improving her power though. In fact, Bertus said that Charlotte was on the verge of self-destructing, and I agreed to that to some extent.-The Princess has to obviously become the Empress!-Ooh! True that!-After surviving through such hardships, she absolutely has to be blessed by God!However, the public didn\u2019t hesitate to say that the Princess should become the Empress, and there was no one refuting with that.\u00a0 The Public overwhelmingly supported the Princess.A princess who was rescued dramatically after being kidnapped by the Demon King. She was also the sole survivor.That was one hell of a story. Bertus didn\u2019t have anything he could beat that story with. Although he had the possibility of becoming a Sword Master that was still in the far off future. Also, becoming a Sword Master itself was great and all, but the Demon King was already dead. He had nothing to accomplish after becoming a Sword Master.That story alone wouldn\u2019t make her Empress, but it was only natural that huge conflicts would arise if Charlotte, who was supported by the public, didn\u2019t ascend the throne.In my personal opinion, the one who displayed superior abilities at the moment was Bertus. However, the public supported the Princess, and she wasn\u2019t that hugely inferior to the Prince. Therefore, Charlotte was still in a more favorable position in regards to the succession of the throne.Now that the Victory Festival was taking place, it seemed obvious that the citizens of the Empire would like to see Charlotte become the next Empress.Of course, regardless of that, at the end of the Victory Procession, we confirmed that no convoy with prisoners was among them, so we were about to go over to the Mapo District. At the confluence point, we were mixed up among a group of drunk passersby.-It\u2019s free! Free, I say! Eat and drink to your heart\u2019s content!There were quite a few stores that offered free food and alcohol to share the joys of victory separated from the Festival. For that purpose there were many tables placed before inns and restaurants.The Demon Realm had been a long time enemy of the humans. The mere fact that they were now forever freed from the fear they spread was enough to make everyone euphoric even handing out free food.If they had lived their whole life in the Imperial Capital, then they should have never even seen a single hair of a demon for their entire lives, and now they wouldn\u2019t ever see one in the future as well. However, where did their fear and hatred against demons come from?People were afraid of the unknown after all. In fact, the Demon Realm probably made plans to conquer the Human Realm as well.We sat at an empty table. Loyar was wearing a robe, Eleris cast a bit of disguise magic on herself, while I didn\u2019t wear any disguise at all. I had already transformed into a completely different form not comparable to Reinhardt after all.Loyar opened her mouth.\u201cI saw a lot of wagons covered in black sheets coming through the Badelz Gate.\u201d\u201cDid you check what was inside of them?\u201dLoyar shook her head in answer to my question. Our surroundings were very noisy, and Eleris cast some soundproofing magic so that no one would hear what we would be discussing now.Since this had nothing to do with the Rotary Gang we decided to hold our meeting here.\u201cI didn\u2019t see them, but I could tell just by smell and sound alone. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s them.\u201dLoyar\u2019s sense of hearing and smell were particularly developed.\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you actually a dog?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, I mean\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026 just very much like a dog.\u201dI mean, she had a good sense of smell and hearing, she listened well to orders and when she slept she seemed no different from a wild dog as well. She was completely like a dog in human form. What was with this?Even in your human for you were like a dog, huh?Loyar seemed shocked by my words and Eleris covered her mouth and laughed.\u201cShe\u2019s not a dog. She\u2019s just a very dog-like person.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201dAt Eleris\u2019 words, Loyar\u2019s face turned red. Eleris also seemed to be having fun teasing Loyar.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll trust what you said. You\u2019re sure, right?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAlthough the convoy\u2019s content was hidden, Loyar could tell by the sound and smell that the numerous wagons that came through Badelz Gate were filled with the demon prisoners.Loyar continued to recount what she saw.\u201cI don\u2019t know about the Victory Procession\u2019s side, but all the wagons were under strict escort. People seemed to be interested in them, but no one seemed to know what was in them.\u201dSome might have contained things like spoils form the Demon Realm. They probably got transported through the same Gate. Some of the wagons also contained some of the prisoners.\u201cMost of the wagons seemed to be moving towards the Imperial Palace, but some were also heading towards the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters.\u201dLoyar probably went up to a high place to watch the wagon procession. Some of the wagons that were supposed to go to the Imperial Palace actually went to the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters.\u201cThere were a total of 30 wagons. Judging by their sizes and the sounds and smells coming from them, I\u2019d estimate there to be about 5 per wagon.\u201d\u201cSo about 150 people\u2026.\u201dThanks to knowing the location of the black market in advance, it was rather easy to infer which gate the prisoners would get escorted from.\u00a0 30 wagons, so about 150 prisoners of war were to be sold on the black market.\u201cNo, Your Highness, I estimate them to be half that amount.\u201dHowever, Loyar shook her head at my estimate.\u201cWhy is the actual number smaller?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it, Your Highness. There were about a dozen wagons loaded with things other than prisoners.\u201d\u201cWhat other things?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the prisoners of war aren\u2019t the only merchandise sold on the black market.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Right. That might be the case.\u201dOther than the prisoners they took from the Demon Realm, they also loaded the wagons with loot they wanted to take to the Merchant Guild. Twenty wagons were filled with prisoners and the other ten with loot.They would also sell the items they stole from the Demon King\u2019s Castle on the black market, not only the prisoners.\u201cHmm\u2026. I\u2019m not sure about the prisoners, but if it\u2019s stolen loot, there might be a possibility that this wasn\u2019t approved by the Imperial Family\u2026. Or was that loot designated to be sold?\u201dThe chances that the Imperial Family had nothing to do with this slightly increased. There might also be the possibility that the loot that was to be sold were things the Imperial Family had no interest in. After all, there was little chance that the Imperial Family didn\u2019t know about this black market.Most of the wagons with prisoners made their way to the Imperial Palace. There was nothing we could do about that.However, about 100 prisoners would make their appearance on the Merchant Guild\u2019s black market.They could be rescued or slaughtered depending on how well we do.\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that we were able to get some information in advance. Like that we were able to ascertain the amount of prisoners. How about security?\u201d\u201cI have confirmed that it\u2019s tighter than usual. There were more than 10 guards at every entrance of the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters, and they were all disguised as mercenaries, but the atmosphere they gave off and their appearance were by no means ordinary.\u201dHigh-level armed forces disguised as guards were stationed at the Guild headquarters. I didn\u2019t know if they were Knights or something, but leaving them unattended would be rather difficult.Of course, there\u2019d also be wizards inside.\u201cOkay\u2026. Now we have to somehow force the Knights Templar to raid that place\u2026.\u201dAs slaves, they might be able to save their lives, but they\u2019d stay demons no matter what.I wasn\u2019t sure if it was worth risking their lives to give them their freedom.However, as the last leader of the Demon Realm, I made a decision. I had no intention of rebuilding the Demon Realm, but I had decided to rescue them.Gradually I started to realize that a leader had to be a person that made a certain judgement before even discussing the rights and wrongs of that decision and perfectly carry out said judgment.If all of them were slaughtered by the Knights Templar because of the failure of our operation, would I be able to withstand that? Hundreds of lives could be lost due to my negligence, could my mind handle that?Some might want to sacrifice their freedom to keep their lives.I could never know.So, I decided to take it easy.\u201cI\u2019ll have to think of a way to pass on this information to the Knights Templar without getting caught.\u201dI\u2019ll definitely succeed.My ability would make that belief reality.My power couldn\u2019t actually do that yet, but it helped me calm down at least.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67The Knights Templar also returned together with the triumphal army. Their Victory Event was different from the Allied Forces Victory Event under the control of the Emperor.Although the Knights Templar were a huge pillar of the Allied Forces, it was originally an army of the Five Churches and if the Emperor were to praise them for their achievements, it would be the Emperor doing god\u2019s work.Therefore, the Knights Templar would return to their headquarters and receive a congratulatory and blessed speech from the Popes of the Five Churches. All of them, as distinguished guests, had come to the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters in person, coinciding with the Imperial Victory Ceremony.The headquarters of the Five Churches were located in different places, and among them, only the Great Hall of the mighty Als was located in the Imperial Capital Gardium.All the leaders of the Five Churches, the Church of the God of War Als, the God of the Sun Salaam, the God of the Moon Mensis, the God of Purity Towan and the God of Courage Litel, were in the Capital. After all of them finished congratulating and blessing the Knights Templar, they would join the Emperor to commemorate this Victory.So, on the first day the Victory Ceremony is held separately for religious reasons, not because of any personal conflict.Originally, the Knights Templar also just returned from such a long and hard war, so after commemorating their victory they would take a long rest. And the religious leaders would also be happy to exchange some words with the Emperor about their victory.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dIn that peaceful, friendly and festive atmosphere, I was about to cause a huge conflict between those two groups: The Knights Templar and the Imperial Family.Trying to sell and use the demons as sex slaves was a huge religious heresy, regardless of whether it was legal or not. Even the wealthy and nobles of the Empire wanted to buy them. you know? It would be strange for the Knights Templar and the religious leaders to not get enraged.There was no need to wait for the auction to start. As long as they knew that the prisoners were already in the Merchant Guild, there would be no problem at all for the Knights Templar to attack right no. I had no interest in arresting all the immoral Imperial nobles as they attended the auction.We were still sitting at the table placed on this bustling street, chatting.\u201cThere are two ways to go about this. Give the information directly to the Knights Templar or create rumors.\u201dEleris and Loyar nodded their heads at my words.To leak the information to the Knights Templar directly, or spread rumors among the public so that it will reach their ears. We had these two methods.\u201cIn the former case, a certain reaction can be expected, but they might have doubts about the individual that transmitted the information per letter or something. If they just thought about it for a bit, the Knights Templar would probably be able to guess that the ones who leaked the information were demons.\u201dThat was what Eleris said, and Loyar nodded to her words. It didn\u2019t particularly matter if the informant was a demon or whatever because what we were doing was already dangerous as is, but it wasn\u2019t hard to see that leaving traces was not a good choice.\u201cThe method of spreading rumors to leak the information wouldn\u2019t leave behind any suspicious traces, but, we can\u2019t be sure that the Knights Templar will pick up these rumors and act on them.\u201c\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAlso, if the rumors start to spread further, there might be a chance that the black market\u2019s organizers will take action before the Knights Templar. Those who\u2019d be most sensitive about these kinds of rumors were them, so they might change the black market\u2019s venue or cancel it all together.\u201dI also agreed to Loyar\u2019s opinion.The latter option had the disadvantage of not knowing when the Knights Templar would take action. By the time the rumors reached their ears and they decided to take action, the auction might already be canceled.\u201cThe former would have a definite effect, but it would leave a tail behind and the latter would make it difficult to predict the flow of events\u2026.\u201dBoth methods had their advantages and disadvantages. If I used my Preview Function, I would be able to check what would happen in the future, but I couldn\u2019t use it right now.[You are unable to make use of this function at the moment.]When I tried using it, I only recevied this message.Damn it, I had cheats, but I wasn\u2019t even able to use them however I wanted. They should have just kept silent about this useless function.An uncertain but safe method and a certain but slightly more dangerous method.\u201cLet\u2019s go with the direct method. If the black market or the Imperial Family got wind of this, we might not even get to try saving them.\u201dI judged that way, the chances would be lower for them to predict our moves.\u201cUnderstood..\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll do that.\u201dThey both nodded, agreeing to my judgment.* * *Passing on information to the Knights Templar.Just that wasn\u2019t that hard to do. I just had to send them an anonymous letter. On Tuesday, we met up with Sarkegaar after the Victory Event and sent a letter to the Knights Templar.The black market located in the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters where the demon prisoners were said to be sold would open on Thursday.We observed the Knights Templar\u2019s movements all Tuesday. Eleris and I were positioned in a place where we could easily overwatch the huge temple that was the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters, and Sarkegaar and Loyar decided to keep an eye on the Merchant Guild, because there might be certain movements visible over there as well.The Knights Templar were located at the Rosenak District, or the\u00a0Yangcheon District\u00a0in Seoul. If they wanted to head from the Mapo District to the Yangcheon District, they would have to cross the bridge first, as one had to do if one were to come from\u00a0Gangbuk\u00a0to\u00a0Gangnam.Eleris seemed particularly uncomfortable, because we were close to the headquarters of those who held a power most dangerous to her, divine power.\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to make any special movements.\u201dIt had been over six hours now since I sent them the letter. I sent over a second worry-filled letter to not get ignored, so there was no way that it didn\u2019t reach them.\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that they are questioning the information presented in these two letters. They might be discussing that internally at the moment.\u201dSending armed forces to the Merchant Guild was something that had to be discussed, and it was understandable enough that they wouldn\u2019t immediately believe an anonymous letter sent by an unknown source, telling them to dispatch forces.It seemed like they were still discussing at this stage.Since we didn\u2019t know when they would make their move, Eleris and I kept on from one inconspicuous place to another. As there were many people on the streets it was easy to mix in with the masses.The night was problematic though. One by one, the people would leave except a few drunkards.When night fell and the streets were covered in darkness, Eleris and I hid in a discreet place at the side of an alley.\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ll make their move today\u2026.\u201dIt was already very deep into the night. It was probably too late for them to take action today.\u201cI think we\u2019d better go back.\u201dEven if I stayed here, there would be nothing I could do, and if the situation worsened I\u2019d just put myself in unnecessary danger. Eleris\u2019 words were true, but I couldn\u2019t do as she said.If I didn\u2019t know how this situation would unfold when a crisis strikes, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to \u2018Revise\u2019 it.\u201cNo, my duty is to observe the situation.\u201dThat\u2019s what I softly mumbled, expressing my intentions of staying here, even if it was a little coercive towards Eleris.\u201cAnd the mana train won\u2019t run at this hour, so getting back would be more troublesome.\u201dIt was deep into the night, so it would be much more difficult to get back, whether to Temple or any other place. As if she knew what I meant, Eleris hid me and herself in the shadows.Even while a grand festival was going on, night was still night.The streets that were so busy by day, now only had some drunken husks of people passing by from now and then. But then--Stomp, stompFrom afar, sounds of heavy footsteps echoed through the street. Eleris poked her head out of the alley, then looked towards me and nodded.Midnight.That was when the Knights Templar began to move.* * *It was night so we couldn\u2019t mix in with the crowd. After casting Invisibility on me and herself, Eleris and I followed them for a while.\u2018They might be able to see through magic. Don\u2019t get too close.\u2019Eleris whispered to me as quietly as she could, and I nodded.Those Paladins were obviously veterans. A total of nearly 200 Knights of the Knights Templar were marching in front of us fully armed. Each of the knights held great divine power, so if they were to get hurt, they could simply heal themselves and continue to fight. Since I was on the receiving end of Adriana\u2019s recovery spells once, I could tell how mighty divine power could be.200 such monsters were marching through the streets.They could be called elites.200 weapon and divine power experts who engaged in battle after buffing themselves and could even heal any injury they might receive in battle.Monsters that were more like zombies than actual zombies. A Paladin.They were something that exceeded the Undead.200 Elite Paladins who deserved to be called human tanks were now on their way to the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters. If they would engage in battle with the Merchant Guild\u2019s forces, that would create chaos.\u2018What about Sarkegaar and Loyar?\u2019\u2018I sent a familiar over.\u2019Since there was no tool capable of establishing two-way communication, Eleris seemed to communicate with them using her familiars.She passed on the information that the Knights Templar were on their way and would soon arrive to those two who were keeping an eye on the Merchant Guild\u2019s side.Soon, they reached the bridge leading across the Irene River. We continued to follow behind them.It was good that everything was going as planned up until now.But why were they taking action at night\u2026?I had a bad feeling about that somehow.\u2018Why did they decide to move at night?\u2019\u2018Wasn\u2019t it because they took so long to discuss this matter?\u2019\u2018If it\u2019s like this\u2026. They must have judged that this was an urgent matter.\u2019It was good that they decided to take action at night. During night time, when Eleris\u2019 powers grow stronger, the success rate of our operation would increase even more.Obviously, if the Knights Templar were dispatched during the day that would cause a big commotion. If there were many people up on the streets while such a fight were to occur in the Merchant Guild, the citizens would come to know its circumstances. They would find out that people tried to sell demons on a black market.Naturally, that would lead to the prestige of the Empire to get tarnished.Did they move out during night time out of some form of consideration to save the Empire\u2019s face? They planned on getting rid of this disturbance silently and quickly at night.However, this case would seriously raise the Knights Templar\u2019s prestige. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for them to let the public know of this?Though, considering the big picture, it couldn\u2019t be denied that the Knights Templar should take care of this incident quietly though\u2026.Without questioning their actions further, I followed those 200+ Paladins marching forward.\u2018This, I\u2019ll give it back to you for now.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Yes.\u2019I didn\u2019t forget to return the Flame of Tuesday back to Eleris for a while.* * *Fortunately, this midnight march continued until they reached the Merchant Guild\u2019s headquarters. I was wondering if they were headed somewhere else, but so far everything was flowing as intended.We were in a place from where we could observe the building from a distance. Eleris used floating magic while hugging me to get us on the roof of a building.Loyar and Sarkegaar were hid in the place that they chose as an observation spot, reading the flow of the situation. Loyar looked at us and nodded seeming like she knew we were present even though we had invisibility magic cast on us. That showed that our location could be predicted by smell and sound.Because we had Loyar, we didn\u2019t need to look at the scene with our own eyes..However, there was one thing we could notice even if we didn\u2019t have ears as good as Loyar.\u2018They aren\u2019t very loud.\u2019The other two, including myself, nodded at Eleris\u2019 words. They were supposed to loudly shout something like: \u201cYou blasphemed the Gods!\u201d but they didn\u2019t do something like that.Loyar shook her head.\u2018Even though their voices are low, it seems like there\u2019s an argument going on in there.\u2019Loyar told us that, although they try to not make as little noise as possible, they were still arguing.\u2018We got information that a black market was supposed to open here and that demon prisoners were to be auctioned of there. In the name of God, I demand you cooperate and let us search this place. If these allegations are not true, the Knights Templar shall promise to make a formal and respectful apology to the Merchant Guild.\u2019Loyar seemed to be able to hear their conversations from this distance.\u2018The guards don\u2019t seem to make it easy for them.\u2019However, even if the Knights Templar came to visit, the other party wouldn\u2019t just let them search the place so easily. That was to be expected. Loyar seemed to concentrate on the following conversation as she fully focused on her ears. The three of us remained silent and only looked at Loyar, trying not to get in her way.I was wondering how the conversation would continue.-Rooar!We could clearly hear the sound of many people pulling out their weapons and going at each others. I didn\u2019t expect this battle to actually take place.\u2018The guards eventually made way.\u2019They didn\u2019t want to open the way, but when the Knights Templar drew their weapons, they had no other choice but to open their doors in the end.They had no good reason to block the Knights Templar\u2019s way. They were disguised as Merchant Guild guards. If they started a conflict with them Knights Templar, they would have justification to call them blasphemers, giving the Empire a lot to explain. For example, why regular soldiers were disguised as Merchant Guild guards.They probably thought everything would be over once they started a fight with the Knights Templar. Of course, the moment they opened the doors for them and released the prisoners, things would be over for them as well.Anyway, the Knights Templar had entered, meaning I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do anymore from now on, although my job wasn\u2019t over yet.There was still a possibility that the Knights Templar would immediately execute the prisoners on the spot without escorting them to their headquarters. That was what everyone was most worried about.[The \u2018Revise\u2019 Function has been used.]The function that would make things happen that wouldn\u2019t normally and would prevent things from happening that should.The Knights Templar would escort the demon prisoners from the Merchant Guild to their headquarters without killing or harming them.[The \u2018Revise\u2019 function cannot be used.]\u2026\u2026What?My heart froze over when I saw that message appear in front of me.If I couldn\u2019t even use the function it wouldn\u2019t even matter how many achievement points I had at my disposal.Seeing that message made me stop for a moment. I knew that an event that was too improbable would require a huge amount of achievement points or wouldn\u2019t be able to be revised at all.Was it something like that?Did that mean that the Knights Templar didn\u2019t even consider anything else but killing all of them out of resentment for those guys trying to auction off demons?\u2018Hey, why are you like this?\u2019When Eleris noticed that I was acting a little strange, she asked worriedly.\u2018Ah, no\u2026. It\u2019s just\u2026 What if\u2026 Those guys decide to kill all the prisoners\u2026.\u2019They didn\u2019t make this a public appearance, but it wasn\u2019t a cover-up either. I tried to make sure that they would escort the prisoners back to their headquarters using the Revise function.The prisoners that were supposed to be auctioned off could be used as evidence to force an apology out of the Empire. So, they could only use the living prisoners to put pressure on the Empire.I sincerely thought that was the most probable situation, but it seemed like I was wrong, wasn\u2019t I? If so, I had made a huge mistake, as all the prisoners that could have survived as slaves would now get collectively killed because of the choices I made.My heart was completely frozen and there was a chill running down my spine. What should I do? Should I save them by using Revise in a different way? But in what way should I use it then?I could only imagine the ground suddenly collapsing enabling all the prisoners to escape through a type of tunnel. Of course, I couldn\u2019t make that happen.After a while Loyar grabbed my hand.\u2018Your Highness, don\u2019t worry.\u2019Loyar whispered to me.\u2018The Knights Templar are taking the prisoners out.\u2019With those words, I felt like my brain was freezing over again.I then realized why I couldn\u2019t use the Revise function just then.I could make things happen that wouldn\u2019t happen.However, how could I use Revise to create a situation that would happen anyway?The situation I was trying to create with Revise was the exact same happening at the moment.They had no intentions of killing the prisoners in the first place. So I couldn\u2019t Revise this scene.I was freaking out because I simply misunderstood the Revise function.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68It seemed that the Knights Templar were taking out the prisoners one after the other with the guards watching, probably wearing some really strange expressions. They had no way to prevent this from happening faced with the clear justification the Knights Templar held.There should have been someone in command of these people at the scene but it seemed like he wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything. It would be pointless to say anything against the blasphemy charges or that there weren\u2019t any demon prisoners here when they were able to lead them out like a row of bound corvina.The Empire would wash their hands of this because they didn\u2019t want this case to get any more complicated than it already was.Even if they weren\u2019t able to catch the Empire, the Knights Templar were able to capture the greatest weaknesses of those involved in this case. It wasn\u2019t known if this case would pose a real problem for them or if they\u2019d be able to escape using secret deals.The most important thing, however, was that the day where the Knights Templar got to use the prisoners as evidence would never come.\u2018Looks like they found everyone.\u2019Loyar said so and glanced at Sarkegaar.\u2018Okay Sarkegaar. Start to take over the Warp Gate as planned.\u2019\u2018Yes, Your Highness.\u2019-Slide!Sarkegaar slowly slid down from the rooftop and suddenly turned into a black bird taking to the skys.What\u2019s this?A bird?He could do something like that as well?\u2018What? Didn\u2019t you know he could do something like that?\u2019Seeing my stupefied expression, Eleris smiled a little.\u2018He can\u2019t only transform into humanoid forms.\u2019\u2018\u2026Then could I do something like that as well?\u2019I had this ring that enabled me to make use of his clan\u2019s powers, so I should be able to do that as well, right?\u2018I don\u2019t recommend it. It would probably be very uncomfortable and awkward. You also wouldn\u2019t be able to move as you want as well.\u2019It might be hard for me to adapt to a completely new body structure, is what Eleris meant. Dreadfiends most likely had to undergo a lot of training to be proficient in using any type of transformation. I wouldn\u2019t be able to move properly, but just knowing that the possibility was there was enough for me. I didn\u2019t know when I might have to make use of that.\u2018About 100 people in total. Looks like they\u2019ll be leaving now.\u2019\u2018Great. Let\u2019s move as well.\u2019Their destination was the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters. I was sure of that. I wasn\u2019t able to use Revise after all, so this was something that would definitely happen.That was the Revise function\u2019s loophole. Revise wouldn\u2019t be able to be used unless it was something that wouldn\u2019t 100% happen. Using that information, I could check future developments without having to spend any achievement points.Of course, that system bastard didn\u2019t like me exploiting loopholes, so if I try to use this too often, they might take some action again.Anyway, we didn\u2019t have to follow the Knights Templar.Before we left, Loyar suddenly stopped trying to get up.\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019Loyar didn\u2019t respond to me and stayed focused as if she was still trying hard to listen to something.After being quiet for a while, she wrinkled her brows.\u201cThe Knights Templar seem to be a slightly different group than we thought.\u201dAfter saying that, Loyar stood up and jumped from roof to roof.* * *Eleris took me with her using her magic and Loyar moved as if sweeping through the darkness, quickly heading towards the Templar\u2019s headquarters. They passed the Warp Gate.Sarkegaar should be disguised as one of the soldiers guarding the Warp Gate. I didn\u2019t know with whom he swapped, but he did say he wouldn\u2019t kill that guy, so he must have done something else, like stunning or hypnotizing him.\u201cYour Highness, now you have to hide by yourself.\u201dAfter arriving at the location they would launch their attack at, Eleris spoke to me, looking at me as if I shouldn\u2019t be here anymore.\u201cI know. But what did you mean earlier?\u201dI looked towards Loyar. Her expression crumpled up as if she heard something very disgusting.\u201cAs they started to escort the prisoners, they started to laugh to themselves after they left the Merchant Guild.\u201dWhat did that mean?\u201cThey laughed?\u201d\u201cThey have a lot to share, they said\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t figure out what that meant. Sharing?\u201c\u2018We just got even more\u2019\u2026. It seems like they had some to begin with, right?\u201d\u201cThat seems to be the case\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just the black market that took some of the prisoners.Even the Knights Templar took some of the humanoid demons like succubi in.\u201cThe guy that seemed to be the leader of that group responded to his subordinate\u2019s question, if this was going to be a problem\u2026. That they could just say it\u2019s in the name of research, that\u2019s what the other members of the Empire\u2019s Allied Forces used as an excuse as well\u2026. But selling them like this is a problem\u2026 is what they said\u2026.\u201dLoyar seemed to feel aversion towards the Knights Templar.It wasn\u2019t just the Imperial Family, or the Merchant Guild.Even the Knights Templar kept demon prisoners. Judging by what they said, it was clear that all of the Allied Forces took away demon prisoners. If they were discovered, they\u2019d just say they would keep them for research purposes.However, the auction had no such excuse, because it was clear that they wanted to sell them. That gave the Knights Templar the right to take the prisoners away.That was the moment where I understood why the Knights Templar came out at night.If this information became known to the public, not only would it tarnish the prestige of the Empire, but also showcase that every faction of the Allied Forces kept demon prisoners for themselves. And among them, the Knights Templar were a group that no one expected to do something like that.Of course, if this were revealed, they would make it seem like they took them to do research on them, but everyone would know that that wasn\u2019t the actual reason. It\u2019s not like people wouldn\u2019t find out about this, just because they had some excuses prepared.Therefore, the Knights Templar were dispatched in the middle of the night to take the prisoners with them. That way only a few people would witness this.In the end, it turned out exactly like I predicted it would. They weren\u2019t going to execute the prisoners, they were going to take them to their headquarters.Seeing what they were doing, all other excuses were useless.Now that they had some form of justification, they were trying to take away the slaves from the black market on blasphemy charges. They had some as well, but still took the black market\u2019s prisoners with the excuse that their purpose was impure.\u201cThe result is the same\u2026. Their intentions are dirty though.\u201dIn conculsion.I overestimated their piety.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Even if we were to save them, it would only be a drop of water on a hot stone. There were so many demons taken prisoner. Each camp of the Allied forces, including the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters held demon prisoners of war.The number of prisoners we\u2019d be able to save from the black market was incredibly small. It was impossible to save them all. I mean, we had to plan out this whole operation just to save 100 of them.After splitting up from everyone, I went up a hill far away from the site. It was pretty far away, but it was still at a distance where I could see any big commotion happening.That was when I finally was able to use the Revise function.[You have used the \u2018Revise\u2019 function.]Today, all demon prisoners, Sarkegaar, Eleris and Loyar will safely escape through the Warp Gate.[To trigger this event 2000 achievement points are required.]There was a high probability that a significant number of them would be able to escape safely, but it was less likely that all of them would.Although it required a huge amount, I used the function without hesitation. There was no reason for me not to use it.[You have spent 2000 achievement points.]With that I felt at ease.I didn\u2019t know what would happen exactly, but I knew that tonight\u2019s operation would definitely be successful.-Bang!Then I saw it.Huge flames erupted from the square located before the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters.Now I knew what Eleris could do with the Flame of Tuesday.Fierce flames began to whirl towards the sky.A magnificent Firestorm ran havoc.-Ruuuuuumble!Bright light accompanied the storm raging through the air.\u201cN, no\u2026.\u201dThis was supposed to be a spell to just distract them, wasn\u2019t it?Huh? Wasn\u2019t the strategy to minimize our damages and create chaos so that they could escape using that gap?You weren\u2019t trying to blow away both the Knights Templar and the prisoners of war, were you?\u201cThi, this is kind of crossing the line, isn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201dWere you trying to kill everyone because how the Knights Templar were acting?That was when I firmly vowed that I would never try to get on Eleris\u2019 bad side.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Hell was let loose.-Roooaaar!Only after a gigantic firestorm erupted did the Knights Templar realize that they were caught up in a strange situation.\u201cWe\u2019re under attack!\u201d\u201cA wizard!\u201d\u201cDefend!\u201d\u201cCra\u2026zy! How could they\u2026 Magic of such scale\u2026\u201dAbout 200 members of the Knights Templar as well as 100 prisoners of war seemed to have been left unscathed by this huge firestorm.At the center of these raging flames was a single woman.Wearing a robe that covered everything, they witnessed this unidentified wizard controlling these huge flames while holding a type of pendant in one hand. Her whole body seemed to have been covered in a magic veil.A wizard who could perform magic of this scale without chanting, most Paladins wanted to deny the reality that played before their eyes.-Kuoooooooooah!\u201cIt\u2019s not just one!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a demon!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a Werewolf!\u201dThen, a silver furred monster appeared from behind that storm and roared loud enough to even absorb the flame storm\u2019s sound.This demonic beast\u2019s roar made every person who heard it stiffen up.It was a skill called \u2018Roar\u2019.\u201cCalm down! There are at least two enemies!\u201dThe Lycanthrope moved like lightning and rushed into the Paladins. Then a Warp Gate activated in the middle of that gigantic fire storm.The wizard pointed to the Gate while looking at the frightened prisoners. She didn\u2019t give them a detailed explanation nor did she call out to them desperately.Run away.This simple gesture made these prisoners immediately understand. They were puzzled by the appearance of that wizard, but seeing the Lycanthrope made it clear to them.They knew that they wanted to save them.-Bang! Bobooom! Bang!They were veteran Paladin. The Lycanthrope used its strong and agile body to fight off the Paladin who were escorting the prisoners, but some of them quickly strengthened their bodies using divine power to counterattack.All of them held the awe-inspiring titles of Survivors of the Demon World War.-Boom! Boom!However, the fire storm that surrounded them struck those that blocked the Lycanthrope\u2019s onslaught as if it were alive. The Paladin that got swallowed by the fire wouldn\u2019t die as they had protection spells cast on them, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of there without help.There was a Lycanthrope strong enough to be able to destroy everything in its path with just a single charge and a highly skilled magician.But they were 200 veteran Paladin part of the Knights Templar.\u201cLet Als\u2019 protection descent on our swords and bodies!\u201d-Flash!The Paladin, their swords and bodies wrapped in divine power giving of a tremendous amount of light, began to charge towards the wizard.There were only two of them.Even though they might have been somewhat surprised before, now they were enveloped in enormous protection magic. There was no way they would be defeated by only these two enemies.However.-Ruumble, rumble. Ruuuuumble!Suddenly something seemed to be growing larger and larger near the activated Gate. It grew bigger and bigger, slowly changing its form.-Rumble! Rumble!Something bizarrely inflated like a bubble about to burst, then it began to take the shape of a lizard with black scales.There was slight disbelief in the eyes of all Paladin who were rushing into battle.In the midst of this humongous Fire Storm, a winged lizard that was only supposed to exist in legends appeared.\u201cD, D\u2026. Dragon?\u201d-Rooooooaaaaaaaaar!The Lycanthrope\u2019s roar just now was nothing against this.A Dragon Roar, loud enough to blow one\u2019s ears away, paralyzed the Paladin.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69At the southern end of the Empire, the border of the Kingdom of Kernstadt. Dyratanis Forest.I was facing a destroyed Warp Gate along with three demons and a total of 107 demon prisoners.Our rescue mission was successful.The destroyed Warp Gate was surrounded by a lush forest and there were no guards or back up to be found.This was an abandoned Warp Gate that didn\u2019t get maintained anymore to begin with. If we set our escape location as some large city, that would have been quite the headache, so we tried to escape to a Warp Gate that wasn\u2019t manned anymore.The Gate in front of the Knights Templar\u2019s headquarters wasn\u2019t an Extra-large Gate, so it couldn\u2019t sent us that far away. Normal Gates, Large Gates and Extra-large Gates each had limitations in their movement distance. We had luck that the Gate in front of the headquarters was a Large Gate.Still, this was quite a distance away.After the operation ended successfully, Eleris broke the gate and teleported me here.\u201cEveryone has survived, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cGreat. Everyone did an excellent job.\u201dBoth Sarkegaar and Loyar were unharmed. The battle itself didn\u2019t actually last that long. The moment a dragon suddenly appeared, all the Knights Templar froze, overwhelmed with this absurd situation, while the prisoners ran through the Warp Gate with everything they got.If the battle had been prolonged, it was clear that all three of them would have been in grave danger.The prisoners who didn\u2019t quite understand this situation, held expressions switching between relief and fear.But it sure was strange.As a demon, I had horns and such, but neither the succubi nor the incubi had tails or horns.They didn\u2019t seem much different from humans.Well, that was that.[Quest completed \u2013 Rescue the Demon Prisoners][Number of rescued prisoners \u2013 107][You have earned 5350 achievement points.]I used 2000 points to end up earning more than 5000 points.Sarkegaar, Loyar and Eleris began to untie the prisoners.First, I should introduce myself.\u201cI am Valier Jr. Although, since the previous king has departed from this world, you should refer to me as Valier now.\u201dAt those words, all the demon prisoners who seemed unsure at first, began to get on their knees one after the other.-Your Highness!-Your Highness!Numerous people began to bow down to me while shedding tears.It was as if they had found a single ray of hope at the moment where they thought everything was over.As such, everyone got on their knees, but there was one person who stayed upright.\u201cValier\u2026? You\u2019re Valier?\u201dThe woman who looked at me blankly seemed as if she doubted her own eyes.\u201cCo, could it be? Princess?\u201dSeeing Sarkegaar\u2019s exceedingly shocked reaction surprised me even more.Princess?Didn\u2019t he say I was the only Arcdemon left in the world?* * *It soon became clear why Sarkegaar called her princess.\u201cShe is the daughter of one of the former Four Heavenly Kings, Reina, the Succubus Queen.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Is that so?\u201dThe Succubus Queen.The Four Heavenly Kings.I had no idea about the Demon King\u2019s side because I hadn\u2019t properly set it up, so I didn\u2019t even think about who the Four Heavenly Kings were supposed to be, of course. One of them seemed to be the Succubus Queen, and now her daughter somehow recognized me.On a surface level, it appeared like the Four Heavenly Kings\u2019 relatives were treated like royalty.This succubus, who didn\u2019t seem any different from a human, appeared to be of the same age as me.\u2026She also had pink hair.Pink hair? Seeing that in real life was hella weird. It\u2019s no like it didn\u2019t look good on her. It just felt\u2026. Out of place?The succubus approached me while pulling at her clothes that seemed closer to rags and came to a hold in front of me. There was a mix of bewilderment and hesitation visible on her face. Was she nervous?\u201c\u2026. Do you not recognize me? I\u2019m Airi. Don\u2019t you remember me?\u201dThe next Succubus Queen, who introduced herself as Airi, was stunned at me not recognizing her.\u201cHis Highness almost lost all of his memories of the Demon Realm, Princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know either.\u201dThe pink-haired Princess seemed to be at a loss for words.The succubus, who called herself Airi, seemed very perplexed by Sarkegaar\u2019s answer.\u201cDid you know me? Although I do not know what kinds of memories you had with me, I\u2019m really sorry. I can\u2019t remember anything.\u201dAt those words, Airi, who was in front of me, as well as the numerours other succubi behind her held some weird expressions on their faces. What? What did I do to them? Were they glad I lost my memory?Airi rolled her eyes in confusion, but eventually nodded hesitantly.\u201cWhatever may have happened before\u2026. Thank you for saving me. I didn\u2019t expect you to be alive, but\u2026. I\u2019m glad\u2026. That you\u2019re alive\u2026.\u201dAiri seemed to have thought that I died immediately on that day. Certainly, the way I ended up surviving was very pathetic. However, if it was the original Valier he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything, but miserably shout \u201cDo you even know who I am?!\u201d while getting his head chopped off.\u201cGood. Everything\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s go over there and have a talk.\u201dI took Airi to another part of the forest. I could feel her shyly following behind me. I didn\u2019t know what relationship she had with me before, but it certainly didn\u2019t seem like a good one. I felt like she was staring holes in my head.\u201cLike Sarkegaar said, I have lost all my memories of my time in the Demon Realm, and, to be honest, I don\u2019t feel like recovering them again. I apologize if I did anything to you.\u201dI slowly got used to apologizing for things I don\u2019t even remember doing. However, Airi\u2019s eyes simply widened at my words.\u201cN, no\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026. You don\u2019t have to apologize to me. Ra, rather, I\u2026.\u201dAiri seemed very startled and quickly covered her mouth with her hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cAh, tha, that\u2026. A, about that\u2026.\u201dWhat?Wasn\u2019t this flow different from the other times? Looking at it like this, she seemed very surprised that I actually saved her, right?She didn\u2019t keep staring at me because she was afraid of me, huh?Was it because she was sure that I would never come to save her?\u201cDid you bully me?\u201d\u201cAh, ah, that! That\u2019s! That!\u201dThat was right.I didn\u2019t know about the other guys, but I didn\u2019t think I bullied her. It was the exact opposite.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry!\u201dAiri was so out of her mind, because she got saved by the kid she bullied in the past.* * *According to what Airi told me while trembling, we were something like childhood friends before the Demon World War broke out.To precise, she wasn\u2019t really my friend, but the kid in charge of me. It seemed like Airi would educate me through beating every time I acted like a bastard somewhere. Actually, this was only possible because we were both treated as royalty, even though we were of different races.So, whenever I saw Airi when I was on my own it seemed like I\u2019d book it or when I was next to the Demon King I\u2019d start trembling terribly.So we hated each other. Actually, I got beaten up by her all day long.Like I treated Loyar like a dog, it seemed like I got bullied a lot by the succubi. Every time Airi saw me she would beat me up.She probably was that strong because she was, different from the normal succubi, the descendant of the Succubus Queen.The Succubus Queen seemed to have been the number 2 of the Four Heavenly Kings.So, Airi was the daughter of the Demon Realm\u2019s Number 3. That meant that she was able to educate the Demon King\u2019s son when he was messing around.She had a very high status in the Demon Realm. Seeing as these titles were hereditary, I\u2019d become the Demon King and she\u2019d become the demon with the third highest rank.All of the Four Heavenly Kings died and Airi was taken prisoner after our defeat.And then she was saved by the Demon King\u2019s son, whom she thought would have already died, and had a bad relationship with since their childhood.So she seemed to find this situation hard to believe. Of course, she seemed to be convinced that I lost my memories to some extent.\u201cLet\u2019s leave what happened in the past behind us. I wouldn\u2019t want to take revenge on you anyway. Even if I don\u2019t quite remember how I was, I heard that I was someone who deserved to get beaten up.\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2026.\u201dAiri couldn\u2019t say anything to that. This sure made me wonder just how crazy I actually was.Still, seeing that she was the one in charge of me, it didn\u2019t seem to be that serious.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about this. Do you know the detailed composition of the prisoners here?\u201d\u201cThere are 85 Succubi, 15 Incubi, 2 Lycanthropes, 2 Doppelgangers and 2 Nightwalkers.\u201dMost of them were succubi and incubi. I didn\u2019t quite know what Nightwalkers were, but all of them were humanoid demons.\u201cHow about your strength? I heard that the humans have done something to you, but what did they do exactly?\u201dAt that, Airi closed her eyes. Just imagining it made her remember the pain.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. You said that you lost your memories, so could it be\u2026.\u201dAiri looked at me in disbelief that I couldn\u2019t tell just by looking at her. She eventually lifted her pink hair a bit after she recalled that I lost all my memories.I couldn\u2019t see it before because she was covering it with her long hair.There were hideous wounds at her temples as if something got ripped out from there.\u201cThe humans\u2026. Removed all of our horns and tails\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like they simply didn\u2019t have any horns.In order to neutralize the succubi\u2019s and incubi\u2019s power, the humans forcibly removed their tails and horns.Tears were dripping down Airi\u2019s face when she remembered the disgrace she felt that day.Airi told me that the horns were usually the source of magical power for horned demons.That said, now that her horns were gone, Airi lost all her magical powers and all her growth potential.As a result, she also lost her racial skill. She lost all her abilities, such as absorbing spirit and entering other people\u2019s dreams.\u201cWi, will they grow back\u2026. Or are they gone for good?\u201d\u201cThey can grow back, but it takes a long time\u2026 It would be the same as if I didn\u2019t have any to begin with. Not only that, the humans also took other actions.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHuman wizards destroyed all our magic management facilities in our bodies. Even if our horns were to grow back, we wouldn\u2019t be able to use magic ever again\u2026. That\u2019s how it is.\u201dThey were trying to sell absolutely safe toys to the wealthy and powerful. Therefore, while destroying their source of magical power they also made it impossible for them to ever manipulate magical power again. The wizards succeeded in completely neutralizing these prisoners.Although she was a high-ranking demon with the title of Succubus Queen, Airi lost all her strength and growth potential.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Valier\u2026. We can\u2019t even fathom fully paying you back for saving us\u2026. I\u2019m so grateful and I really want to help you in any way possible, but\u2026. We\u2019ve all become useless\u2026.\u201dAiri looked down and started to cry. They all must have been demons with enormous powers. And among them, Airi, the Succubus Queen, had, or was very likely to have, the most power of them all.However, they had lost all their potential. So Airi seemed to feel guilty, knowing that she couldn\u2019t repay me for my help in any way.\u201c\u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t save you because of that though.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dAt my words, Airi looked at me with a tear smeared face.\u201cI didn\u2019t save you because I planned on using you. I did it because I thought I could.\u201dThat was the truth. There was also the possibility to earn a ton of achievement points but that was only secondary. I had no interest in rebuilding the Demon Realm to begin with, but Eleris, Sarkegaar and Loyar wanted to save them so desperately, so I just told them how to do it.I wasn\u2019t interested in their powers enough to cause a riot in the middle of the Imperial Capital for just about 100 prisoners in the first place.It would be rather sad for them to have lost all their powers, but there was no reason for me to be disappointed about that.\u201cSo, you guys can go back to the Darklands or whatever. My goal was to save you, so you don\u2019t have to be at my beck and call or something after this.\u201dIf they wanted to go back to the Darklands, Eleris would send them there using mass teleport. Airi was staring at me blankly for a long time. She never imagined she\u2019d ever hear me say something like that.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70You don\u2019t have to be at my beck and call, so if you want to go back to the Darklands you can do that.After instructing Airi to deliver my message to all of the prisoners, I held a meeting with Sarkegaar, Eleris and Loyar in a secluded place.\u201cEveryone worked hard. No one got hurt, so we achieved the best result.\u201d\u201cIt is all thanks to your brilliant wit and bravery.\u201dSarkegaar sprinkled me with flattery again, while Eleris smiled.\u201cTo be honest, we were lucky. They were frozen for quite a bit after they saw a dragon appearing in the middle of the raid.\u201d\u201cThat sure was surprising.\u201dSarkegaar took the form of a dragon, so it wasn\u2019t a real dragon that showed up.Dragons were legendary creatures to begin with, so there were no eyewitness accounts. He simply took the form of what people thought a dragon would look like. Dragons didn\u2019t exist, and even if they did exist, no one knew whether they\u2019d look the same as people imagined them to look like.If the Paladin awakened from their stupor a bit faster, some of the prisoners might not have been able to be rescued, or either Loyar or Eleris might have gotten seriously hurt or killed.I was terrified of what would have happened if I didn\u2019t use the Revise function to make sure everyone would be safe. Anyway, I was glad that it turned out the way it did.\u201cI heard you told the prisoners that they could decide where they would like to go themselves?\u201dI nodded at Loyar\u2019s question.\u201cIf they could go back to the Darklands and live in peace, that would be better. There\u2019s no need to overdo it.\u201dSecretly infiltrating 100 people into the Capital wasn\u2019t something I could do at my level in the first place. They also lost their magic abilities. It was already difficult enough to protect myself, so it was impossible for me to protect them as well.Therefore, it would be best if they were to return to the Darklands, which was still relatively untouched by the humans.* * *After a while.After Airi told me that they were done talking among themselves, I returned to the place where the prisoners gathered.They all looked sad. They probably heard from Eleris and Sarkegaar what I was doing here. That I infiltrated the Imperial Capital and attended Temple to rebuild the Demon Realm.The Prince was plotting such a great thing in the middle of the enemy camp and they felt so pathetic that they couldn\u2019t help in the least. They felt like they were only a burden in their present state.\u201cHas everyone decided?\u201dAiri nodded at my question.\u201cAlmost everyone has decided to go back to the Darklands\u2026.\u201dWe took the risk to save Airi and the rest, so they seemed apologetic that they couldn\u2019t do anything for us. She probably hated me a lot in the past, but she genuinely seemed sorry for having teased and bullied me.\u201cNo need to be sorry. Forget about fighting and war. Just live peacefully.\u201dAs if they were touched by my consideration, they began to tear up. They would be sent deep into the Darklands where no human could touch them.Their pride as high-ranking demons disappeared along with their horns. There were other races here as well, but they seemed to have judged that they wouldn\u2019t be of any help to us either.It certainly seemed to be the much better option for them to live their lives freely in the Darklands than to live as slaves for humans.\u201cI shall prepare the spell then.\u201dEleris began preparing the mass teleport spell. It was night time and they were just that many. If she cast it twice, she should be able to teleport all of them to the Darklands. After about an hour or so, Eleris was able to send most of the prisoners to the Darklands.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was staring blankly at those who were still left here.\u201cAren\u2019t you guys returning as well?\u201dAbout 11 succubi, including Airi, remained here. They kept looking at me.No.She did tell me that almost all of them would return. Then that would mean that there were some who didn\u2019t want to return, huh?\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t want to go back.\u201dAiri spoke as their representative.\u201c\u2026No, what do you want to do then, if you don\u2019t want to go back?\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t able to do much and we wouldn\u2019t be much help in a fight, but I\u2019m still a Royal of the Demon Realm. You\u2019re working so hard as well, Valier, so I can\u2019t just go back to the Darklands, forget about everything that happened and live comfortably.\u201dAiri seemed to think that I, who had a dog-like personality before, was completely helpless hiding in the heart of the Empire, so she wanted to be of some help to me as a Royal of the Demon Realm. The other ten thought similarly.No, it seemed like they made up their mind.I knew that they really wanted to be loyal to me, and repay their debt to me, but what were they even going to do staying here?\u201cWe have lost all our strength. I know we won\u2019t be of much help, but these bodies are the only weapons we have left to offer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026So what are you going to do?\u201dAiri looked at me with determination radiating from her face.\u201cYou need money to live in the Human Realm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAnd I know that sometimes huge amounts of money could pose a great threat to the Human Realm itself.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if there would be a financial crisis in the Empire some time in the future, but there was no law that it wouldn\u2019t happen. So what was it she wanted to say?\u201cDoing business, Valier.\u201dWhat did she mean by that?\u201cIf we could achieve great commercial success and hold the Empire\u2019s gold coins in our hands, it would be of great help in restoring the Demon Realm.\u201d\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a great plan. As expected of Her Highness the Princess. I can\u2019t help but admire your wisdom.\u201dI mean, she isn\u2019t wrong. Sarkegaar was nodding and responding as if her words were plausible enough.\u201cAfter re-establishing enough power, if we had a firm grasp on the Human Realm\u2019s money, we could win against the humans without fighting in a war. We could also divide the Empire and send it spiraling down into chaos. We have only used force up until now to fight wars, but this time we shall use any means available to us.\u201dListening to Airi\u2019s words, Eleris\u2018 expression became more and more complicated.It was an expression that seemed to shout\u00a0\u201cNo, what is that little brat saying to my kid?\u201d.The Succubus Queen, a high-ranking demon, was advising me to first seize the monetary strength of the Empire to lead it to its demise. I get that she was trying to overthrow the Empire but wasn\u2019t that a rather unconventional advice? Rather than saying \u201cLet\u2019s destroy them with strength and magic!\u201d she went \u201cLet\u2019s cause a great economic depression in the Empire!\u201d instead.But in the end, she was right.However, what did that have to do with them not wanting to go back?\u201cErm\u2026 You\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be any good with commerce and finances. I\u2019m still attending Temple as well\u2026 And as far as I know, commerce requires a huge amount of capital. We don\u2019t have that much money though.\u201dThere was nothing we could do but turn to crime or exploit Eleris\u2019 magic. I had no desire to do that though.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201dAiri pointed at herself and the remaining succubi, as if she had already thought about the capital issue.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s with you?\u201d\u201cIf you sell us as slaves to humans, you\u2019d be able to make a lot of money. That money should be enough if you use it as capital\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuh? What kind of bullshit is this?!\u201dI just saved you from becoming slaves, so why the hell are you telling me to sell you as slaves to get money?When I shouted at her, Airi cried out.\u201cStill, this is the best we can do for you! This is the only way we can be of use to you in this situation. Otherwise we are completely useless! If I can take revenge on the humans by throwing away my petty pride, I can do it hundred times over!\u201d\u201cFrickin hell!\u201dPerhaps because I told her that I forgot all about what I had done, Airi seemed willing to even die for this cause.\u201cValier, we have made our decision. You don\u2019t have to worry. If it\u2019s for rebuilding the Demon Realm, tis but a cheap price to pay. So\u2026.\u201d-Your Highness!-Your Highness!Behind her, the succubi were calling out to me as if chanting.\u201cShut up, you guys!\u201dThere was a limit to how much bullshit I could deal with.Regardless of whether I shouted at them or not, the succubi cried and begged me to sell them.This was driving me crazy.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After rescuing the succubi from the black market to the best of our abilities, they decided to become slaves again in the hopes of rebuilding the Demon Realm.Some of them returned, but there were 11, including Airi, who remained, trying to repay the kindness they received even if they had to do something like this, to become my starting point in seizing the Empire\u2019s finances for the reconstruction of the Demon Realm.Wasn\u2019t this just too weird, even if this story line was already crazy enough? They said that they want to sell themselves at a high price, raise capital for me, enabling me to seize the Empire\u2019s commercial sphere and create total chaos when we decide to go to war again.Of course, this was absolutely unacceptable. Sarkegaar did say that it would be a good idea, already moving the abacus in his head, but quickly shut his mouth when he saw that I was being serious.Apparently, they felt very desperate after having lost all their power, and seemed to have thought that this would be the only way they could be of any use to us.Considering Airi\u2019s words that we should have a firm grasp on the Empire\u2019s money, being able to shake their economy, this was certainly a very plausible scenario. Given that I was extremely gifted in commerce. Of course, I wasn\u2019t.I mean, I didn\u2019t even spare the stock market a single glance in my past life. I didn\u2019t have a single clue about all this.When I grew furious and told her that this would never ever happen, Airi began thinking of other ways.\u201cThen how about we all join a brothel and send you a certain amount of money every month? It won\u2019t be a huge sum, but still\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why does your mind always wander into that direction?\u201dWhy was it like this? Was it because she was succubus? I thought I\u2019d rather die than get them to send me the money they earned after they sold themselves like this.Rather than accepting it, I\u2019d sent it right back to them.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you lost your horns and tails, but like this you wouldn\u2019t have much trouble fitting into human society. If you really want to help me, don\u2019t do things like that. The Capital is dangerous, so you have to keep your distance from it. For now you will need an identity.\u201dOf course, I knew that succubi absorbed spirit to grow stronger through such actions, but weren\u2019t they made incapable of that? In that case, there would be no reason for me to earn money through these kind of things.\u201cAre we\u2026. No good?\u201dI sighed at her question.\u201cHey, I don\u2019t know if that might come off as rude, considering you are succubi, but I really don\u2019t want you guys to do that kind of work, okay? And I don\u2019t even want to touch money earned like that. Being loyal and wanting to reconstruct the Demon Realm is good and all, but how could there be a Demon Realm without demons? There can be demons without the Demon Realm though. I really don\u2019t care if you leave and find your own way to live. You hear?\u201d\u201cWell, Your Highness! If there is no Demon Realm, the demons as a\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness\u2026.\u201dSarkegaar tried to interrupted, but after I shouted at him he kept his silence, albeit appearing slightly crushed.The succubi began to shed tears again when I told them to find their own way to live happily, but they still wanted to remain loyal to me.Whatever I did was counterproductive.They just saw me as nothing more than a benevolent monarch, so no matter what I said it would only strengthen their loyalty towards me.No! I wasn\u2019t some benevolent monarch, I sincerely just wanted you guys to go on with your life! This was just too annoying!\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what you can do, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something you can do well enough. How about driving wagons or carrying bricks?\u201dI imagined a scene were the Succubus Queen was doing manual labor. Wasn\u2019t that even worse actually? No, I mean, it\u2019s true, right?\u201cBut it would be very difficult to raise enough capital to take over the Imperial Financial World through such means\u2026.\u201dI had nothing to say to that.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to do whatever you want as long as it\u2019s not these kinds of things. You could work in a bar, in an inn or start a transportation business, everything\u2019s fine.\u201dEven just imagining the succubi becoming a continental transportation conglomerate made me almost laugh out loud, but there was nothing I could do about that.Airi kept her mouth shut and didn\u2019t open it again for a while, as if she was thinking about this.She said that she wanted to be useful to the best of her abilities, even at the risk of putting herself in harm\u2019s way, but she seemed really sad when I refused her like that.\u201c\u2026Hmm\u2026. Okay, Valier. I don\u2019t know how to do much else, but I\u2019d never do something you wouldn\u2019t like.\u201dIf I was the real Valier, I would feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment hearing my former bully say something like that in front of me.I, however, just felt really burdened by what Airi was doing.\u201cI will make sure to become someone who\u2019ll be able to help you in any way possible.\u201dSeeing that expression on her face, saying that she would do anything I wanted her to do, made me feel insanely burdened because I felt like she would really do anything I asked her to do.Of course, I wouldn\u2019t be able to change her mind by force, so I had to find another way. I clearly knew that.But well.She\u2019s a succubus\u2026.And a Queen at that\u2026.That\u2019s.We\u2019re both something like royalty, so we would be of the same status\u2026.Well\u2026.Ah, I can\u2019t do that.I mean, I\u2019m still underage in this life!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71I made Airi promise some things to me.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t do anything dangerous until I tell you otherwise, and don\u2019t even think about starting anything without having a proper method to hide your identity from the humans\u201d.The most important thing was getting an identity. Not in the Capital of the Empire or one of its Principalities, or any other large city, but in a rural place at the outskirts of some country.This part was provided by Loyar and Eleris.I didn\u2019t know what Airi would do from now on, but I was sure that she understood what I meant. Since Eleris was by my side, I was also able to go see her periodically using teleportation.\u201cYou absolutely have to dye your hair.\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah\u2026, Yes.\u201dPink hair was just too much. She was at the black market, but there were surely some people who saw Airi. It was fortunate enough that she wasn\u2019t identified as the Succubus Queen\u2019s daughter. If she were, she wouldn\u2019t have appeared on the black market.Of course, only a few actually had seen a succubus before. Frankly speaking, even if she went to a city on the outskirts of the Empire, her identity wouldn\u2019t be revealed. No one would notice the marks left behind by the removal of her horns and tail unless she deliberately showed them to someone, and even if they were to see them, they\u2019d only appear like some severe wounds. No one would think that these were wounds left behind by removing horns and tails.\u201cFirst we have to decide where you should go\u2026.\u201dAiri was planning on raising money to seize the Financial World of the Empire. I honestly thought that this was quite impossible, but Airi seemed to need a goal for now.She needed something she could focus on to overcome her despair. That was why I was trying to think of something for her even though I didn\u2019t believe it was possible.Where could I send Airi to do business and her identity wouldn\u2019t be revealed?Let\u2019s think about that.\u201cFirst of all, it should be a place that housed a lot of travelers. If there are many people coming and going it wouldn\u2019t be considered weird if you guys suddenly appeared there.\u201dLoyar nodded her head at my words.\u201cYes, if they went to a small village where everyone knew each other, that might be rather suspicious. If we\u2019re talking about a place with a lot of travelers, that would probably be a trading hub.\u201dEveryone agreed with Loyar. If it were city that served as a trading hub, it would be easy to do business there and it had a large floating population.Additionally, a trading city would be an important transportation hub as well.All cities with Extra-Large Warp Gates were playing that role. People who used Large Gates or Normal Gates usually flocked to these places.If we were to compare it to subway stations, an Extra Large Warp Gate was like a transfer station, so it naturally was crowded.In a nutshell, any place that held Extra Large Warp Gates would be a transportation hub.\u201cA place with an Extra Large Warp Gate would be very convenient. Places like that could be reached immediately after a person of the Empire passed through two or three other gates.\u201dSo I had to consider one possibility.\u201cAre there any maritime trading hubs that don\u2019t have any gates? Even a regular trading hub would be fine as long as they don\u2019t have any gates.\u201dIn the Empire, there was a huge number of Warp Gates, but that was only possible for the Empire. In the outskirts, there were many towns that didn\u2019t have any Warp Gates, and there still must be trade that depended on regular transportation using wagons. Of course, if there were no gates, the amount of money flowing around the city would be relatively small, but safety was our number one priority here.Right now we didn\u2019t have something like a Map of the Empire, so we couldn\u2019t make any judgements by looking at one.\u201cHow about the Edina Archipelago?\u201dWas there a place like that? I never wrote anything about it. There were many places like that so I wasn\u2019t actually surprised. It went without saying that I didn\u2019t know much about it.However, if it was an archipelago, it definitely was an island area.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an island country beyond the southern waters of Kernstadt. I heard that their trade is only dependent on sea trade with Kernstadt, because it\u2019s too far away and there are no gates connecting them to the continent. I remember that there are gates connecting the islands together, but there are no gates connecting them to the main land.\u201d\u201cIt is an island\u2026.\u201dIf so, even if her identity got discovered, it would take a long time until the Empire could begin their pursuit. It was a very distant country, so it was clear that they didn\u2019t have much interest in the Empire\u2019s internal affairs.The actual size of their economy might not be that large, but I didn\u2019t really want her to become a big player anyway, she just needed to have this awareness that she did something at least.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dAs I was looking at her, Airi nodded.\u201cIf the gates only connect to the other islands and foreign trade is conducted through ships, goods would be concentrated at the most prosperous port city on the islands. I\u2019m sure there would be a lot of people as well\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how big their population was, but if there were only a few people living there, it wouldn\u2019t be called a country. Airi nodded, saying that she could be at ease if we sent her there.However, I was still slightly worried.\u201cWill it really be okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe boldly said that she was willing to do anything. She looked about my age, so she was still a kid. I felt so bad for her that I felt like dying.And that wasn\u2019t why I asked if it would be okay.\u201cPeople in port cities tend to be rough, that\u2019s why I asked you.\u201dA sailor would die if they weren\u2019t quick on their feet. So there were a lot of quick-tempered and rough people among them. It was basically a fact that there were a lot of gangsters near the shores where the goods gathered, but that affected the people living there as well, giving them no other choice but to adopt that rough behavior.I had no idea what kind of business they planned on opening there, but I believed they were very likely to go into the maritime trade. So the succubi would work as employees then?Just imagining it would make me think of many troublesome things coming their way.\u201cAah\u2026. We are only physically weakened for now. Although we won\u2019t be able to use magic anymore as our mana management facilities have been broken, our physical abilities will return soon.\u201dIt seemed like they were only weak for now, soon their strength would be restored. The other succubi also didn\u2019t seem to worry about that.\u201cCan you handle those people?\u201d\u201cYour Highness.\u201dAs if she knew what I was worried about, Loyar called out to me.\u201cHuh. What is it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. Put in different terms, Her Highness the Princess would be Your Highness\u2019 senior martial sister.\u201d\u201cSenior martial sister?\u201dMasters, disciples, senior martial brother, junior martial sister, senior martial sister. Was it that type of deal? Why did such a martial arts setting suddenly pop up?So did that mean she was older than me? Was I supposed to call her big sister or something?\u201cYes. Your Highness and Her Highness both learned swordsmanship from Sir Larkan Simonstite, who was the first of the Four Heavenly Kings.\u201dWho now?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Did we? But why can\u2019t I perform any type of swordsmanship at all? Is it because I lost my memory?\u201dThere was no sign of my body remembering any of that swordsmanship though? It was still called pseudo-swordsmanship in my status window.Of course it would be seriously weird for me to know any of that stuff because I didn\u2019t even have the original Valier\u2019s memory, but shouldn\u2019t there be at least something that had been ingrained into this body?Loyar shook her head with a firm look hearing my remarks.\u201cEven if you were to remember these days, you probably wouldn\u2019t gain any of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026So I was just loafing around and getting beat up all day?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSince I hadn\u2019t learned it properly to begin with, saying that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use swordsmanship even if I remembered those days was kind of harsh. Airi wore a vague expression on her face, hearing Loyar\u2019s words. It seemed like she had trouble overlapping the person she knew with the one I am today.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThe Princess was an honor student on the other hand.\u201dYou\u2019re not even at a level where you could worry about her because she\u2019s on a completely different level.\u00a0That was what Loyar was trying to tell me politely.\u201cSo, even if you can\u2019t use your magic, you\u2019d still have enough power to give those bastards a beating?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026. That\u2019s how it is\u2026.\u201dAlthough she was weakened at the moment, she was still the Succubus Queen\u2019s daughter and seemed to have been training her body all this time. I see. In fact, she was really good at fighting, so she must have beaten up this damn Valier a lot.Although we were taught by the same person, I just slacked off while Airi studied hard.So, even in this situation where she almost lost all her power she had at least one thing she could rely on.\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s do it like this, although it\u2019s a bit unfortunate that we don\u2019t have the means to contact each other in case of an emergency, but that\u2019s a small price to pay to avoid the Empire pulling anything.\u201dI had no idea what they were capable of doing, but I hoped that they just would be able to live happily without getting caught.Considering my conduct at Temple, that\u2019s definitely not a path I could take anymore.For the time being, I decided to let Eleris take care of the ten succubi and the Succubus Queen. We would need some basic capital as well so Loyar also decided to send Eleris.Eleris started casting mass teleport to send me, Sarkegaar and Loyar back.\u201cThe atmosphere of the Capital will soon tense up. You\u2019d better return to Temple right away.\u201dI nodded at Eleris words. Eleris, who could do so many things with her magic, was also leaving for a bit to help out Airi.It would be best to just return to Temple and lay low. Airi looked at me with an expression displaying a complicated mix of emotions. Then she carefully opened her mouth.\u201cIt is said that people show their true face when they are in a crisis.\u201d\u2018People\u2019 refered to all humanoid intelligent beings, so it was not wrong to refer to me as \u201aPeople\u2018.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYou said that you lost your memory\u2026. That would mean that this is your true face.\u201dAiri looked at me with a smile on her face, and placing a hand on my shoulder.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then you absolutely deserve to be our King.\u201dPerhaps she just finished her re-evaluation of me in her mind, so Airi seemed to trust me. Someone I didn\u2019t even know who bullied and hated me ended up trusting me.Perhaps because the end result was the only thing that mattered to me, I felt quite good about that. Airi was the Succubus Queen, so depending on her growth, she could become a strong ally.However, she did say that she lost all her growth potential.I got one more ally, but I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m happy about that or not.\u201cI was told you were my senior martial sister.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Yeah. Although we didn\u2019t really have that many lessons together.\u201dWe shared the same teacher and we were both part of the Demon Realm\u2019s Royalty as well.\u201cTake good care of yourself. If anything happens, tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201cWe didn\u2019t actually come from the same place, and she wasn\u2019t actually my childhood friend, but just knowing that she shared some memories with this body\u2019s former owner made me want to get along with her.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After hearing rumors about demons getting sold on the black market, we tried rescuing them and finally managed to save 107 demons.Among them was the daughter of the Succubus Queen who was Royalty same as me. Without my intervention, Airi would have ended up leading a miserable life. However, in the end, Airi couldn\u2019t be of any help to me so she tried doing something on her own.As such, Airi took off to do business in the port city of the Edina Archipelago south of Kernstadt, unknown to even me, the writer.The ending of this incident ended up being slightly boring. If I were to get my hands on an Elixir with which I could restore Airi\u2019s condition, things would be slightly different.Of course, I didn\u2019t know if I would ever get one of these.I had no clue what kind of existence the Succubus Queen was, but she was one of the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon Realm.Even Eleris, who had overwhelming magical power, wasn\u2019t part of the Four Heavenly Kings. That might have meant that Airi\u2019s potential was far greater than Eleris\u2019. Of course, Airi seriously seemed to want to rebuild the Demon Realm, but I just really hoped to get one more strong person under me before the Gates eventually appeared. When that happened, it wouldn\u2019t matter whether one was a demon or a human.In the end, I got the Succubus Queen as my ally after this whole ordeal. She would travel to a place with no Gate connecting to the mainland in sight, so I could only meet her through Eleris, however, I felt more relieved that she would be in a safe place rather than feeling inconvenienced.The next day.I was listening to the superintendent\u2019s instructions along with the others who decided to stay behind.\u201cAs for now, all students are prohibited from going out of Temple until instructed otherwise. If there are any people returning from outside, let them know as well.\u201dIn this chaotic situation, Temple issued a ban on going out. Shortly after the Victory Festival started, a terrorist incident presumed to be caused by demons occurred within the Imperial Capital.There were no fatalities, but the Knights Templar were attacked in the middle of the night and many saw a huge firestorm illuminating the night sky.Those who had already returned to their home didn\u2019t know about this piece of news, however, if they were to return they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave Temple until this case was settled.Therefore, there weren\u2019t many remaining inside of Temple.What I caused was rather abnormal, and I fully knew that. I pretty much expected what would happen next.\u201cThe whole festival has been canceled.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is just too abnormal.\u201dKayer nodded his head at Kono Lint\u2019s words.The Victory Festival should have lasted for the whole month, according to the original.However, it ended now after only a few days. It was only natural that the people who gathered here were overcome with a sense of fear by this sudden act of terrorism.During this grand festival celebrating the annihilation of the demons, something like that happened in the middle of the Imperial Capital. This was worse than smearing shit all over the Emperor\u2019s face. The Empire would do everything to track down those demons that had fled through a Warp Gate.This would lead to information about the black market coming to light.The truth that there were people trying to open up a secret auction with some prisoners of war they stole as merchandise, and some other demons tried to rescue their captured brethren.The Empire, that only mentioned that demons were able to infiltrate the Capital and that they should get destroyed, tried to sell them as sex slaves.I was the one who smashed the honor of the Empire to pieces.The atmosphere in the Empire would quickly turn into a grievous one, and it would stay that way for quite some time.[Achievement earned \u2013 Deviation from the Original][Due to your actions the main story has been changed][You have earned 500 Achievement Points.]Along with those changes came some achievement points.The main story had been changed.I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what that meant. The grand festival that took place in the Imperial Capital was more like a background setting, not really part of the main story.The main storyline was what Ludwig experienced and went through during the Festival, as I mentioned before.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that there were demons inside of the Imperial Capital\u2026.\u201dI could hear that Ludwig\u2019s nervous voice.\u201cI\u2019m scared\u2026.\u201dAnd B-9, Delphine Izadra, was muttering in fear.My actions caused the Temple students to get locked up in here, so the \u2018Delphine Izadra Kidnapping\u2019 event completely disappeared.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Originally, right now was supposed to be the Festival period, so Ludwig should have been so excited that he and his best friends, Number 9 and 10, Delphine Izadra and Lanian Sesor, decided to roam around the whole Festival area.Then they would have eventually lost Delphine in the crowd. Later they would find out that Delphine, who they thought just got separated from them, actually got kidnapped by a powerful gang. Ludwig would report this to the guards, however completely disregarded their order to wait at Temple, and would go around looking for Delphine together with Lenian Sesor.Ludwig would find the bad guys after some time and fought them to save his friend.And he somehow ended up dishing out a huge blow loaded with spirit that sent all of them flying.Ludwig, who was last ranked, didn\u2019t have that much confidence in himself, even though he was part of the Royal Class. However, this beginning part, after he studied a bit at Temple, was supposed to display that he was incomparably strong, completely different from ordinary people. In fact, Ludwig had a great physical talent, so he was quite athletic and strong.The kidnapping of a Temple student was still equal to a disaster, but I wrote this improbable development to showcase that Ludwig was really strong.Anyway, I thought it was quite fortunate that one of those stupid developments I created disappeared because of my actions.I really didn\u2019t want Delphine to go through this horrible experience. Of course, Delphine was already pretty close to Ludwig, but this event made them grow even closer.Anyway.That was a pretty bizarre experience.Delphine had no idea that she was actually about to be abducted, nor did she know that she was spared from that because of a different outlandish incident.She was just afraid that some demons caused a massive terrorist attack on the Imperial Capital.I didn\u2019t want to sound condescending, but wasn\u2019t it actually me who saved her? However, I was the only one who knew that. It was quite the subtle feeling.Anyway, Temple was drenched in a somber atmosphere because that huge incident happened in the Capital. The scenery outside would be in an even more grievous state. It was also clear as day that the Emperor was probably more than furious as well.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cThis means the Demons weren\u2019t completely destroyed.\u201d\u201cCould it be that an even stronger Demon King is hiding somewhere? Nothing like that ever happened during the war.\u201dThe next morning.The children were competing who had the wildest imagination.They were only children, but for the adults this had other implications. It was obvious that they hadn\u2019t completely annihilated the Demon Realm, and just this level of terrorism was enough to throw the Capital into great chaos.This action of rescuing some prisoners consequently made the humans aware that now wasn\u2019t the time to celebrate a victory, but to be wary of the Demon Realm\u2019s remnants. Was this a good thing or did this doom the Demon Realm completely?However, this was the choice Sarkegaar, Eleris, Loyar, and I made.Although we were able to rescue 107 demons, as a result we greatly stimulated the humans\u2019 vigilance.There were a total of 6 people left in the Class A dormitory.Number 2, Ellen ArtoriusNumber 3, Liana de GrantzNumber 7, AdeliaNumber 8, Kono LintNumber 10, Cayer ViodenAnd me. Everyone except Number 3 were commoners, who didn\u2019t have a reason to go back home. In Number 3\u2019s case, her family had a mansion in the Imperial Capital, as such she returned home every Friday. So, despite this long break, she came back to Temple yesterday.Since there was a terrorist attack on the Capital, the Grantz Family probably thought that it would be better for her to return to Temple, which would be much safer than staying in the mansion. That was why this girl didn\u2019t seem to be in such a good mood. She was supposed to be resting in her mansion, but was forced to go back to school.Of course, the vacation would continue, so there would be nothing to do at Temple.Ellen was training as per usual, no matter if a terrorist attack broke out in the Capital or not, and I joined her.After sparing for quite some time, with my sword ending up clattering on the gym floor again, I flopped down on the ground exhausted. As Ellen quietly looked at me, she asked me something.\u201cWhy did they do that?\u201dI tilted my head at her question.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe demons. Why did they do that?\u201dEllen didn\u2019t really talk about this matter before, but she seemed to have some doubts. Just why would the demons attack the Imperial Capital? She held such curiosity. Our usually insensitive Ellen wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to such events, but she seemed to be curious on the inside.\u201cH, how should I know?\u201dThe fact that the demons were doing this to rescue their brethren who were about to be traded away on an auction wasn\u2019t known by many people. If that truth were to be revealed later, that would cause some serious waves.Come to think of it, that would be the case.It\u2019s highly likely that the truth would never come to light.\u201cI just don\u2019t know why they would fight the Knights Templar.\u201dThe Knights Templar were like a natural enemy to demons. Of course, not all demons would be affected by their powers, but all undead type demons were insanely vulnerable to divine power. In fact, Eleris, a vampire, was fighting her most powerful natural enemy.\u201cIf they wanted to take revenge, shouldn\u2019t they have attacked a different place if they were able to infiltrate the Capital?\u201dEllen had quite many doubts.She didn\u2019t understand why the demons decided to attack the Knights Templar, because Ellen didn\u2019t know about the demon prisoners. As such, her question was valid. Most people, however, wouldn\u2019t even think about that.Because in their eyes, demons were simply evil.Just by believing in that single sentence most people gave up thinking about such matters. However, Ellen was putting herself in the demon\u2019s shoes, treating them as intelligent beings the same as humans.Ellen was raising a valid question. If they wanted revenge, it probably would have been better if they attacked the Emperor instead of the Knights Templar.\u201cI think they know something we don\u2019t.\u201dEllen believed that the demons had some purpose rather than just being angry at their actions. They had no reason to attack the Knights Templar. She was convinced that they had a hidden reason why they did something like that. In the end Ellen, who didn\u2019t seem to hate the demons nor choose to simply dismiss these events, inferred that they must have had a reason for all this.If I really were a Demon Prince dreaming of rebuilding the Demon Realm, this would have been the moment where I realized that Ellen had to be eliminated. She was dangerous. She wasn\u2019t an enemy that feared us or despised us, but an enemy that tried to understand our actions.\u201cIf they had something like that, it would be revealed soon.\u201dBut honestly, the only thing I thought was that she was pretty smart.Come to think of it, I was quite weird.I was disqualified as a human being because I led the demons to terrorize the Imperial Capital.And I was also disqualified as a demon because the only thing going through my head while watching humanity\u2019s strongest hero growing more and more dangerous was that she was really smart.I couldn\u2019t believe that I wasn\u2019t qualified to stand on any of these sides.Just what am I even doing?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *As there were still vacations and the school banned its students from going out, my routine like daily life continued. I did nothing but train with Ellen constantly. I ate breakfast after doing my early morning training, I ate lunch after my morning training, I trained more after lunch and even more after dinner before having some late night snacks.I didn\u2019t conduct my supernatural power training separately. The more one used a supernatural power, the more familiar one got with it, and I was training with Ellen, who could blow me away even if I used my power to its fullest.In other words, sparing with Ellen was already more than enough, so I didn\u2019t have to train my supernatural ability separately.Strictly speaking, I was somewhat familiar with these self-made voluntary routines. Most people had to continue this involuntary routine of going to work and returning home. It was somewhat passive, and yet compulsory.However, as a writer, I had to continue writing even though no one was forcing me to. The result was, well\u2026 We see the result here. Even though it was like that, I still wrote it voluntarily though.So, I had the mental fortitude to continue this, even if no one asked me to do it.Writing just got replaced with daily physical training.However.Although I was fine with this routine, I sometimes felt like I was about to go crazy. Even though the outside world was thrown into chaos, destruction and despair because of the terrorist attack by the demons, inside Temple everything was calm and silent, as if we were in a different world.So even I, who caused this incident, almost forgot about it.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you bored?\u201dSo, the day before our regular school life would start again, on Sunday morning, I muttred as I looked at Ellen.I thought of myself as pretty patient, but she trained everyday as if it was the most natural thing in the world. I was doing it for quite some time as well, but didn\u2019t people need a break from time to time?\u201c?\u201dEllen, who was stretching in the lobby in preparation for her early morning training, tilted her head. Of course, there were many people in Royal Class besides us who would do some early morning training, but the majority of students weren\u2019t here, and there were only a few around as it was still vacation time.Ellen was one of those few people who were exercising every morning.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything you like to do on your days off? Is it working out? I hit the nail on the head, didn\u2019t I?.\u201d\u201cWhich nails?\u201dI frowned at her counter question that had almost nothing to do with what I was asking.\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\u201cIf you want to do it, follow me, otherwise don\u2019t.\u201dEllen started running as if she wasn\u2019t going to take part in this useless conversation, so I just followed Ellen.\u201cHey!\u201dOriginally, I did my early morning training with Adriana, but that church sister had returned to the monastery of the Saint-Owan Principality. She\u2019d probably be back sometime this evening. Hence why I followed behind Ellen right now.Actually, I was just testing myself to see if I could keep up with that girl\u2019s pace. I made myself believe that I was a monster with insane stamina, activating my supernatural power.I certainly wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep up with her if it was a few months back, but we weren\u2019t sprinting, so I was able to run alongside her for quite some time. My physical strength had improved quite a lot, and it had improved even more thanks to my supernatural ability.That was some remarkable growth.\u201cGuys! Good luck today as well!\u201d-Whoosh!Then Ludwig passed by me and Ellen in a flash.I knew that he wasn\u2019t trying to tease us, I knew better than anyone else that he was just a guy full of energy. You couldn\u2019t find anyone as genuine as him in either of the classes!\u201c\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t that guy a bit too bubbly?\u201d\u2026\u2026It was bitter. I knew that he didn\u2019t mean anything by this, but it still felt uncomfortable.The writer was talking behind his main character\u2019s back. What kind of situation was this? The character I set up was the generic protagonist type: Kind, brave and unable to ignore injustice. What\u2019s more, he was right in front of me.\u201c\u2026\u2026A little.\u201dI clearly heard Ellen mutter this as softly as she could.Right? I wasn\u2019t the weird one, right?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Quite frankly, I believe that we should play around just for today. It\u2019s the last day of our vacation, you know? Even if you\u2019re finished growing, you\u2019ll end up losing hair with each passing day if you keep this up, you know? Do you know how scary that is?\u2019\u2018Losing hair?\u2019\u2018Yeah, man. If you exercise too hard they will fall off. Your hair roots are more important than your life. Just go along with me before you end up regretting it.\u2019\u2018Are you losing hair?\u2019\u2018No, I\u2019m not! Absolutely not! Never in my life I shall suffer from that! This is called preemptive measures! You\u2019ll thank me later on.\u2019After our Sunday morning training, I dragged Ellen out to Main Street. It didn\u2019t seem like she believed my talk about losing hair and all that. It just felt like she simply gave up.Still, in the past, she wouldn\u2019t let me grab her like this and would\u2019ve just flat out rejected me, but seeing her reluctantly following me, I felt like we got a little closer.Anyway, people needed a change of scenery from time to time.No matter how I looked at it, I was much worse than\u00a0Baron Ashura.Looking back on the week, I caused a terrorist incident in the Capital and just a few days after I was whining to my classmate in Temple that I wanted to go out to play on the weekend.Just what am I doing?\u201cWhat do you want to eat? My treat.\u201dSince we had skipped our lunch at Temple, we decided to go eat something first. We were forbidden from going out of Temple, so we could only move in the proximity of it.\u201cNot Cheonggukjang.\u201dEllen answered right away, because she knew, if she didn\u2019t say anything, I\u2019d drag her to eat that hellish thing again.No, did she hate it that much?\u201cI thought you liked cheonggukjang though?\u201d\u201cI only ate it because it was in front of me.\u201d\u201cHow shocking\u2026.\u201dIt looked like she didn\u2019t actually like it. How strange. I could have sworn that she did. Of course, that might also be, because she hadn\u2019t eaten it enough yet.Sheesh.It seemed like it would still take some time to turn this girl into an enthusiast.\u201cThen, do you mean to say that anything would be fine if it isn\u2019t choenggukjang?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like eating weird things.\u201dEllen cut me off again while looking straight at me.On Tuesday, I took swordsmanship classes along with Ellen, so we tended to have lunch together. So, every time she made me recommend something, I\u2019d pick something strange, causing her to go through some hardships while eating.A typical example would be durian. I didn\u2019t know why, but they had it here. After eating a bit of it, Ellen dumped it on the street, which was unlike her.Then she held onto a wall and slapped it.\u201cWhy, these are all important experiences.\u201dThere should be some stinky tofu around here, so I really wanted to feed it to her.\u201cNo. You only like weird things.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that I especially liked eating weird things, I just enjoyed watching your reaction while eating these things.Seriously, if I were to eat this stuff continuously, I think I would get nauseous.\u201cI just want to eat some meat.\u201dIn the end, Ellen decided that she couldn\u2019t leave this to me, so she chose what she wanted to eat.\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve finally managed to get over your problem of deciding for yourself for once.\u201dI acted as if I was actually trying to teach her a lesson on making choices for herself. Ellen eventually took the lead without acknowledging my words, probably thinking they were nonsense.* * *\u201cI\u2019m satisfied.\u201d\u201cThen eat more\u2026.No, no. You can\u2019t.\u201dWhen I reflexively told Ellen to eat more 400-gram sirloin steak, I quickly denied it again. If she ate any more, I feared that my pocket money would run out.\u201cEating more than ten plates is seriously crossing the line.\u201dThis store was one with a fairly high price range among the stores on Main Street. Even if we got quite a decent amount of pocket money, to feed that girl you would have to be ready to rob a bank or something.Ellen seemed mildly sullen. Of course, she seemed the same in other people\u2019s eyes though.In fact, she was actually surprisingly easy to read.\u201cAh, fine! But just one more!\u201d\u201cThen, a\u00a0Porterhouse Steak.\u201d\u201c\u2026There sure are a variety of dishes.\u201dIt was a mistake to invite her to eat out.* * *\u201cGoing by the consensus, dessert is on you. That\u2019s an unwritten rule.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dEllen, who absolutely destroyed those steaks I bought for her so that she wouldn\u2019t get grumpy, nodded gently at my words as we were on our way to get dessert. On Main Street, there were not only restaurants but also cafes and various entertainment facilities.Even though I set it up like this, I never described what kind of stores there were in detail, except a select few. There were a lot of them though.-Klang!And for some reason there were some places from which I could hear sounds one would expect coming from batting grounds. No, were they actually batting grounds? What did they replace the pitching machine with?Was it maybe a type of pitching machine that ran on magic stones, the explanation for everything? Ah, well, then it would be understandable enough.It wasn\u2019t just that.-Pang!At first I wondered what that sound was, but it actually came from bows.-Bullseye!It seemed like\u00a0shooting games\u00a0except that they used bows instead of guns. There also seemed to be some that used darts. Ah, just what was the difference between these stores and the ones in modern times? I guess it ended up like this because of my lack of imagination.Ah, this was all on me.Every time I remembered that I was stuck in a world of the bizarre modern Fantasy medieval times genre, I felt a tingling in the back of my head.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find any here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201dWe were looking for a dessert shop, not for an entertainment facility. As I was about to retrace my steps, I heard a voice that seemed somewhat familiar.-N, no! Ah. That\u2019s not right! Why!One could hear a hoarse voice of someone very angry coming from a nearby store. I could only see her back, so I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what she was doing, but she seemed to be struggling to pull back a bowstring, shaking pretty badly.-Peck!\u201cAh! I missed!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t all that easy to pull back a bowstring without properly knowing how to use a bow. This just seemed like she was wasting her money.When I got closer and saw her face, I immediately felt like I knew her.\u201cHey, senior.\u201d\u201cU, urgh!\u201dThe little girl was startled when someone suddenly called out to her, immediately missing her target.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cY, you\u2026. You?\u201dIt was Redina, a small senior I had some history with.\u201cDid you come here to play all on your own? What about your older brothers and sisters?\u201dShe seemed to be wandering around all alone. If someone were with her, they wouldn\u2019t have let this little girl struggle with this bow like that. It really seemed quite pitiful. At my words, Redina exclaimed.\u201cThey aren\u2019t my older siblings, they are my friends!\u201d\u201cAh, why are you shouting like that?\u201dAnyway, I felt sorry towards her for various things. Adriana told me that she was actually a very soft-hearted person and that she was really worried about me getting hurt during that duel.I really wanted to apologize to her, but I just didn\u2019t get the chance to do that up until now. I never imagined I\u2019d meet her in a place like this.When I got closer to find out what she was doing, she seemed to be at a shooting game that seemed more like an archery range than anything. Simply put, to get a prize one had to gather points by hitting targets. That part was the same.However, the targets were pretty far away, so I thought that that little kid would not be able to hit these. Maybe after 2 years.\u201c\u2026No, I mean, you knew this was going to happen, so why did you get mad?\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dShe knew that she wasn\u2019t able to do this, but this girl still clenched her teeth. However, the owner who let her do it without blinking an eye also seemed rather problematic.Looking at the prizes, they all seemed to be dolls. What was up with this?\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say, so don\u2019t bother me and go away.\u201dRedina pushed me away, telling me to not annoy her.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what you actually want, I could try helping you out, you know?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHearing these words, Redina\u2019s expression changed slightly.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry for what I did last time. Honestly, I also heard a lot about you from Adriana. I tried to apologize to you, but I hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to do that yet. So, to apologize for what I said to you, I want to help you out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you good at archery?\u201dI wasn\u2019t all that good, but I was confident that I was more skilled than her. Redina sighed and handed me the bow.\u201cWhich one do you want?\u201d\u201cThat one.\u201dRedina was pointing towards a bear-shaped stuffed toy. When I asked her what prize she was aiming for she immediately pointed to it, like a real child.Anyway, it was pretty big, but\u2026.\u2026\u2026It was the 1st prize.\u201cAh. Well.\u201dI bought a ticket and pulled the bowstring.I am an archery genius.-Peng!Of course, it didn\u2019t go like I wanted it to.* * *One had to shoot 10 arrows and hit the 100-point target 10 times to get the maximum points of 1000. So, what Redina was aiming for was an item that could only be obtained with said maximum score.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026How are you different from me?\u201dI scored 120 points in total for which one could only get the most basic prize. It wasn\u2019t much different from 0 points. Redina couldn\u2019t pull the bowstring properly. At least I knew how to do that, but the score was just too high a hurdle.If I didn\u2019t have my ability, I wouldn\u2019t even have hit any of the targets. This was my first time ever using a bow, so I\u2019d like to think that just hitting some targets was a great accomplishment.\u201cEhem! Well\u2026. Seems like it didn\u2019t go so well, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat? Were you showing off?\u201dRedina held an attitude as if she were better than me, saying I was just showing off.\u201cThis was just the warm up, I\u2019ll get serious now, okay?\u201dI bought a ticket from the owner again.\u201cI said I\u2019d get it for you, but I never said I\u2019d be the one to shoot.\u201dI never thought I\u2019d be able to get enough points for the 1st place prize to begin with, no matter how many times I tried.\u201cHey. Show it to us.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI boldly passed the bow over to Ellen.* * *-Puk!\u201c\u2026\u2026Wow.\u201dRedina opened her eyes wide, staring blankly at the tenth arrow to hit the 100-point target.\u201c\u2026\u2026Woah.\u201dI had a similar reaction.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh.\u201dEven the boss was perplexed.She only sloppily looked at the targets and lightly pulled the bowstring a few times, but every time she let go, the arrow would always strike the 100-point-target without fail.\u201cHave you used a bow before?\u201d\u201cNot that much.\u201dHer talent included the mastery of all weapons. How could she just say that she didn\u2019t use a bow that often while getting a perfect score here? Wasn\u2019t this just a scam? The targets weren\u2019t even that close.The boss handed Ellen a large teddy bear, which was the first place prize, while looking slightly disheartened.\u201cHey, student. Pros shouldn\u2019t do something like this. I\u2019ll give you the first place prize this time, but there won\u2019t be a next time, understood?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes .\u201dI could understand the boss\u2019 remark, because if someone with an archery talent would come here every day, that would ruin this stand. Of course, Ellen didn\u2019t actually have an archery talent.Ellen took the teddy bear that was almost as big as herself and stood there. Redina was staring at the teddy bear and Ellen who was holding it. She seemed extremely envious.Ellen silently handed the large teddy bear to Redina.\u201cH, huh? You\u2019re giving it to me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cW, woah! Thank you! You\u2019re a good kid!\u201dEllen was respectful to Redina, as she was still our senior. Redina seemed very moved, holding that teddy bear larger than her own body. She had to waddle around to carry it, but she seemed delighted.\u201cHey, I was the one who paid for this, so shouldn\u2019t you pay me back?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Right.\u201dRedina looked at me with something close to contempt. She seemed ready to throw the toy away because of my arrogant words.\u201cYou have all sorts of problems, but the biggest problem about you is that you don\u2019t know when to shut up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my biggest problem? Only that? Well, thank you for that compliment.\u201dRedina was happy that she finally received this gift, but her face turned red again as I teased her a bit. Only for a moment though.Redina looked at Ellen with twinkling eyes.\u201cThat! Hey, junior, aren\u2019t you good at that as well?\u201d\u201c?\u201dWhat Redina was pointing at was a dart stand on the other side. I didn\u2019t know what the first prize was, but it probably was something similar to this stuffed toy. Ellen nodded her head slightly as if she had no other choice.No, these brats.\u201cNow, how are you going to carry another teddy bear of that size?\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dJust holding one of them made her look extremely pathetic, but if she added one more, how was she supposed to get them back to her dormitory room? Of course, I could carry it for her, but that would be rather annoying.\u201cNever mind that, let\u2019s go get some sweets.\u201d\u201cOh! My stuffed toy!\u201dI grabbed the teddy bear Redina was holding and tied it to her side.* * *We sat down at a nearby cafe. We each chose a drink and a dessert. The table was filled with sweets, from cakes to macarons to ice cream.Ellen was originally supposed to treat me, but I decided to pay, because Redina was now with us.I ordered black tea.Redina trembled after eating a little cake. Ellen didn\u2019t really react much, but as always, she diligently began to devour everything.I didn\u2019t really touch the desserts, only sipping on my black tea. Redina looked at me as if I did something weird.\u201cDo you like that?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s so-so.\u201dI didn\u2019t know much about the taste of tea, but I still ordered some black tea. They also had coffee, but I didn\u2019t want to drink that. Redina opened her mouth slightly, tasting a bit of the tea, saying it didn\u2019t taste good at all.\u201cIf that tea is just so-so, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d\u201cBlack tea is fine, but I really don\u2019t like sweets.\u201dI hated sweets, but I was fine with black tea, hence I only ordered black tea. Redina looked at me as if I was some weird animal.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like sweets, why did you come to this place for desserts?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m treating you two. You seem to really like these sweet things after all.\u201dRedina narrowed her eyes a bit. She seemed to be a little touched by the fact that I bought them what they liked even though I absolutely hated sweets.\u201cI don\u2019t really like sweet things either.\u201dI snorted at Ellen\u2019s words.\u201cWelp, even if you don\u2019t really like sweet things, it wouldn\u2019t matter to you anyway. You just love eating too much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t refute because I\u2019m right?\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t like sweets all that much, she ate the most out of all of us. Redina was also eating some with little bites, but she could only stare blankly at Ellen who was eating without resting.\u201cJunior. You\u2019ll gain a lot of weight like that.\u201dEllen responded plainly to Redina\u2019s slightly worried comment.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dAt this answer that would make anyone angry, Redina stared at her with a firm expression on her face.Is it because she was still young?She seemed like she was thinking something like that.\u201cI have no idea what kind of constitution she has, but she\u2019s a crazy person that does nothing but work out all day, so she wouldn\u2019t gain any weight.\u201d\u201cAah\u2026. She has a combat talent. I thought so. And why do you keep pushing back\u2026. No. Never mind.\u201dRedina shook her head as if she had to admit that she wouldn\u2019t get a straight answer out of me.\u201cI just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen she brought up the main point, Redina sighed as if she was about to bow.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I won the duel anyway, so what\u2019s there to apologize?\u201dAfter I won that ridiculous duel I already put everything past me, and Redina also didn\u2019t seem to want an apology. Then she started to laugh bashfully.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t like you either, but I like him even less.\u201dMayarton, the one who dueled with me, certainly didn\u2019t seem to have a good reputation. So it seemed that Redina was extremely exhilarated at my victory.\u201cWas he that bad?\u201d\u201cIt was that senior who forced me to go educate you guys. I don\u2019t even want to say anything more about him. I really don\u2019t.\u201dHe forced Redina, who was soft-hearted and the youngest, because she skipped a few grades, to go discipline her juniors.No, I was told that she wasn\u2019t able to even utter a single bad word to anyone, but she asked me if I was a pervert or something with great ease. Wasn\u2019t that too much?Of course, I couldn\u2019t complain, because I did do some pretty dirty things.\u201cBy the way, how old are you?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019m 15.\u201dOf course, there was a huge age gap between her and her classmates as she skipped a few grades, but she was even 2 years younger than her juniors.She was 15.I\u2019m living among these children.I once again realized that I was living among children a lot younger than my previous self.\u201cWhat\u2019s your major?\u201c\u201cOh\u2026. You don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cI would know if you told me before.\u201dJust what the heck made it possible for her to skip 3 grades?\u201cMy major is magic.\u201dHer major was magic. Saying that, Redina held out her hand.And then, a small flame rose from her palm. Suddenly, the flame jumped from her hand with no further warning.\u201c\u2026\u2026You have a supernatural power, don\u2019t you?\u201dLike Pyrokinesis?\u201cNo. It\u2019s magic.\u201d-Crackle! Crackle!The small flame disappeared making way for small sparks splashing from her palms. Ellen was also staring blankly at Redina\u2019s palm.\u201cWhat is\u2026. this?\u201dWithout any warning, flames and electric sparks rose from her palms, and this time, she lifted the spoon in front of her without touching it.What was that? Multiple supernatural powers? Was there something like that?\u201cThis is all magic, as I said.\u201dRedina smiled as she took the spoon out of the air, scooped up a bit of her cake with it and put it in her mouth.A magic-related talent.\u201cThey say it\u2019s called \u2018No casting\u2019.\u201dIt was then that I realized why it seemed like she was using multiple supernatural powers at once.She didn\u2019t cast to use that magic. Of course, this was only the lowest level of magic, and any high ranking wizard could activate such spells without casting, but she would be able to even use highest level magic without casting later on.What\u2019s with that? I never set up something like that.\u201cI\u2019m A-1 of the second grade.\u201dAdriana, who had a tremendous talent for divine powers and had excellent physical skills, was only Number 2.The one who was deemed to have even more talent than her among the second years was none other than this child in front of us.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Skipping grades was basically only possible for those smart ones. So, I could guess that she held a magic-related talent. Her ability to use magic immediately without having to cast was certainly a praiseworthy one.She had to have a high level of intelligence to be able to understand magic and hold a talent related to magic control to begin with, so her talent to immediately use magic was probably her most outstanding talent, not the only one.She was someone worthy of the number 1 spot.\u201cIt is a magic-related talent, but it seems similar to a supernatural power. I\u2019m not completely sure about the details. It\u2019s both a support ability as well as a magic-related talent.\u201dAt Redina\u2019s words, I and Ellen nodded our heads. There was no law that a supernatural power related to magic couldn\u2019t exist after all. Of course, it was quite surprising that she had a supernatural ability I had never set up though.\u2026\u2026I mean, supernatural abilities would randomly appear in this world from time to time, so there was no real need for me to actually set up a limited few, so it wasn\u2019t all that strange that an extra had an ability I had no idea about.Still, this ability \u201cno casting\u201d was actually a pretty powerful one in practice. Depending on how she grew, she had the potential to become someone hella strong.Redina sighed as she ate her ice cream.\u201cBut what use has it? If I don\u2019t get a larger magic pool, it wouldn\u2019t even matter.\u201dIf one\u2019s magic power wasn\u2019t able to support such a fraudulent ability, it was worth even less than a pebble on the streets.Magic was the most convenient and powerful ability to have. Right now, there were only very few things the high-ranked wizard Eleris couldn\u2019t do, that included teleportation, camouflage and offence. Wizards were almost omnipotent.So there were a lot of conditions.The basic condition to become a wizard was being smart, having an enormous amount of magical power, also having a talent for controlling mana and one must have a talent for one of the corresponding fields of magic.These were, of course, the conditions to become a success. If even one of these aspects were less developed, it would be hard for one to actually succeed.The best example of the importance of the size of one\u2019s magic pool was Eleris. She had so much magical power that she could cast Mass Teleport in succession. If I used the Flame of Tuesday, which she returned to me, I\u2019d also be able to use \u201cNo casting\u201d to summon flames. However, I could only use it as long as I have magical power left.Redina seemed to have a strong talent for magic and she also seemed smart enough to easily skip grades, but it looked like her magic pool was quite small.Even if she knew how to use magic, if she didn\u2019t have enough mana, she wouldn\u2019t be able to use her knowledge.\u201cIt\u2019ll grow larger with time. You\u2019re still young.\u201dShe was only 15 years old. Why was she already whining about having a small mana pool?\u201cThat\u2019s what everyone says\u2026.\u201dRedina sighed as if she didn\u2019t know what to do. Saying that while eating those macarons only made her seem cute though.What if a 15-year-old kid had that much power in their hands? Looking at the lengths I have to go, I felt slightly ridiculous.\u201cWant me to tell you about who\u2019s much worse off than you? It\u2019ll make you feel better about yourself, you know?\u201d\u201cHuh? What? Why would that make anyone feel better?\u201dShe looked at me and shook her head as if she had no idea why I suddenly told her that this would make her feel better.\u201cWe\u2019re just normal people, you know? Hearing others being worse off than oneself makes one feel good about oneself. I\u2019m not that well off either, see? That\u2019s how it is.\u201dIt was a similar concept to what one would call catharsis.\u201c\u2026\u2026If that makes you feel good, then you\u2019re a garbage person.\u201d\u201cNo, I mean people are generally like that, you know?\u201dI\u2019m someone who grew up being taught to always look at those worse off than myself and think \u201eAh, I\u2019m still better than them\u201c. They\u2019d tell us things like: \u201eThere are countries where kids can\u2019t even go to school! You\u2019re better off than them, right? Huh? So be thankful and don\u2019t complain! Got it?\u201d.\u201cIn this world, there are people who have a gigantic mana pool, but lack an aptitude for using it.\u201d\u201cWha, what?!\u201dWhen she heard my words, Redina\u2019s face turned pale and she even lost grip on the macaron she was holding.\u201cHow could someone born with a huge amount of magical power be bad at controlling it? You\u2019re lying! There can\u2019t be someone like that!\u201dIt certainly sounded absurd. It was like telling someone that there was someone born with a huge amount of strong muscles, but they weren\u2019t able to make use of them because they didn\u2019t have tendons. Redina frowned, scolding me not to lie.\u201cHe\u2019s talking about Cayer Vioden from our class.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer her, but Ellen, who kept silent up until then.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt sure was surprising that Ellen answered in my stead when she kept quiet all this time, but it was even more surprising that she remembered the information about Cayer\u2019s talent.\u201cDid you memorize his info?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You told me before.\u201dAh.On my first day in Temple, she heard me say that Cayer had huge amounts of magical power but was unable to control it properly. It seemed like she remembered that.When Redina heard about Cayer\u2019s circumstanced of being cursed with having a lot of magical power but no way to use it, she was speechless for some time.That was the truth.Because Cayer was blessed with a naturally big mana pool he held a tremendous amount of magical power as well as an extreme magical power growth rate, but he wasn\u2019t able to use it because he had no aptitude for magic control. That was why he was in Class A, but ended up as Number 10, that was why he had such flaming hatred for Class B. That was the only way he could bolster his low self-esteem.He was like a dam without a floodgate.\u201cWha\u2026. What will happen to him?\u201dRedina\u2019s face turned as white as a sheet. It seemed that she started to worry about her junior, who was bestowed with such a cursed blessing.\u201cAnyway, senior has it much better, right? How is it? Did your worries fly away after hearing that? Hm? Did you think something like \u2018I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not me\u2019?\u201d\u201c!\u201dAfter hearing about someone much worse off, Redina started to worry about Cayer, realizing that her situation wasn\u2019t that bad at least. She must have immediately felt relieved hearing that he was worse off than herself and felt guilty about that.Redina blankly opened her mouth, her face turning red, then she shouted at me.\u201cYou evil bastard! You\u2019re such a bad guy!\u201dSeeing me talk trash about my classmates while teasing my senior at the same time, Redina seemed to have had enough.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It seemed like Redina wandered around Temple on her own, because almost all of her classmates returned home for their vacation. It also looked like she was bored of being on her own, as she kept going around with us even after we finished eating the desserts.\u201cIt\u2019s very quiet.\u201dTo Redina, who was always surrounded by people, Temple seemed like a completely unfamiliar place at the moment.\u201cMust be because of that incident.\u201dThe one I caused, to be precise.\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dThere were some people going around Main Street, but there were only very few students around.We were the only ones at that cafe.\u201cDid the Demon King resurrect to take revenge on us?\u201dOf course, there were various rumors floating around and everyone had their own interpretation of the situation.The theory that the Demon King might have resurrected to take revenge on humanity was something not only Redina deemed as a possibility.\u201cWho knows?\u201dAt my words, Redina looked up at me. Her big eyes were filled with fear. That fear was completely understandable. This case just proved that the Imperial Capital was also within the demon remnants\u2019 scope.\u201cWhat if it\u2019s really like that? Artorius is dead. Who will kill the Demon King now?\u201dThe only Temple students who knew that Ellen was Artorius\u2019 younger sister were me, Bertus and probably Charlotte. So Redina was saying this without any ill intentions. Artorius went beyond just being a representative of humanity and was about to reach the level of a deity.And this representative who was close to getting deified wasn\u2019t held up to normal human standards. At this stage, they all treated him like some non-human.Redina was referring to Artorius, the hero of mankind, but Ellen would think of him as her precious brother and family member.Would Ellen think that they thought of her brother as just a tool to bring down the Demon King? I tried to meet Ellen\u2019s eyes.I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what kind of emotions were lurking behind those calm eyes, but she certainly didn\u2019t look happy.I took the teddy bear to my side to balance out the weight.\u201cThen we should all just perish together.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201dRedina continued to babble on about what we should do if the Demon King really resurrected and tried to invade the Empire. Ellen kept completely quiet.How ironic.The Demon King was dead.However, there was still a Demon Prince who didn\u2019t want to become the Demon King.Artorius was dead.However, there was that hero\u2019s little sister who didn\u2019t want to become a hero.It all seemed like I\u2019d end up becoming Charlotte\u2019s enemy eventually.In any case, I again realized that I was Ellen\u2019s enemy as well.They were two of my closest friends in Temple.The fact that these two would be the people who\u2019d have the hardest time dealing with my truth suddenly made my heart feel cold.\u201cThank you, junior! I\u2019ll cherish the Teddy Bear!\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dAs we returned to the Royal Class\u2019 dormitories, Redina gave Ellen a tight hug, saying that she was grateful for the teddy bear.-Pat, patOf course, she probably imagined this was a senior hugging her junior, but no matter how one looked at it, it looked like she was the one getting hugged. After hugging Ellen, Redina looked at me with a blank gaze.\u201cReinhardt, you need to fix that habit of yours to behave so harshly on purpose.\u201dAs if she realized once more that I was some outspoken, weird bastard, she admonished me.\u201cI\u2019ll try that. In my next life.\u201d\u201cOh, come on!\u201d-Bzzzt!\u201cAh, that stings!\u201dRedina eventually snapped and hit me with an electricity spell using her no-casting. Because of that tingling feeling, I jumped.\u201cDid you just use magic on your junior?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, you brat?! You\u2019re lucky!\u201dIf Redina was serious she could give me a real shock. She smiled mischievously at me.\u201cAnyway, thanks to you too. I\u2019ll buy you some desserts some time!\u201dThen Redina stumbled up the stairs while holding that huge teddy bear.I actually made someone who couldn\u2019t bear insulting others to attack me with magic.\u201cWell, looks like I really have a talent for angering those who usually wouldn\u2019t get angry, huh?\u201dEllen, Adriana, and Redina too.I really felt like I was slowly accumulating some kinds of achievements by angering and teasing people. However, I didn\u2019t actually get achievement points for it.\u201c\u2026Did you only realize that now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dEllen looked at me as if I was crazy. We returned to the first-year Class A dormitory. In the hallway on our way back, Ellen quietly called out to me.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIf the Demon King really had resurrected\u2026\u201dThat girl still seemed to think about this. Ellen stopped and looked at me.\u201cDo you think I absolutely have to take up arms to fight him?\u201dRedina was whining earlier, but she didn\u2019t think about a situation where she had to fight the Demon King all on her own. However, Ellen seemed to think exactly that.Redina thought that Artorius absolutely had to fight the Demon King. No doubt. Other people were also thinking like that.However, Ellen knew that she was much more capable than Artorius.So, if the Demon King were to resurrect and war would break out again\u2026If it was known that Ellen was Artorius\u2019 sister\u2026People would obviously think that Ellen had to fight the Demon King as well. They would think that there was no one else who could fight him other than her.Of course, she wasn\u2019t quite ready yet, but I firmly believed that Ellen would end up defeating the Demon King someday.Ellen had no intention of risking her life for the world. However, she knew she would be forced to do so. That was why she asked me if I thought the same as Redina.In a way, Ellen\u2019s question was quite arrogant. She was convinced that she was more than capable of defeating the Demon King after all. Of course, because it was the truth, it couldn\u2019t be called arrogant or overconfident.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to do that.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dEllen seemed curious about my reason.\u201cIf you were gone, I\u2019d have to eat all alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m serious.\u201dEllen slightly furrowed her eyebrows, as if she had no patience for my bullshit.\u201cI\u2019m serious, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI sighed and looked at the scenery stretching out before Temple, the sun almost set. My arms were crossed.\u201cI\u2019m not planning on eating with you for the rest of my life, but I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life not being able to share a meal with you.\u201dI didn\u2019t want her to die.That was what I meant to say. Ellen was facing me with her back to the setting sun. I couldn\u2019t see what kind of expression she was making, because of that.\u201cSo you mean to say that you don\u2019t want me to die because of your own needs?\u201d\u201cThere are plenty of people that demand others to die for them, so can\u2019t there also be people who ask others not to die for their sake?\u201dI couldn\u2019t see Ellen\u2019s expression clearly.Perhaps she was smiling.\u201cAlso, please think about the poor Demon King that has to fight you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You overestimate me.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty damn sure that you\u2019d beat the crap out of him.\u201dI mean, wasn\u2019t that already happening?The Reinhardt she was kicking around every day was actually the next Demon King after all!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Since the festival was cancelled, all other official schedules must have been canceled as well. So Charlotte and Bertus, who returned to Temple on Monday, didn\u2019t look particularly exhausted.Monday, the day our normal school life started again.The atmosphere around the entire Temple seemed to be very much subdued. It wasn\u2019t just the Royal Class that was like that, but the expressions of those passing by us seemed sullen and tense as well.The mood around Temple was so low that it practically hit the ground. Until yesterday there weren\u2019t any people around, so now it was more than obvious.The pressure sure was heavy.And the places in Temple that were the most subdued and depressed were probably none other than the first year Class A and B of the Royal Class.\u201cAll of you must be aware that the security of Temple is equivalent to that of the Imperial Castle. As long as you do not go out of Temple recklessly, your safety is definitely guaranteed.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was delivering us this message.\u201cHowever, Temple is fully aware about the concerns your parents might hold because of the incident that took place in the Imperial Capital. We shall put your security first. However, if you believe it to be too dangerous here, I would ask you to apply for a leave of absence.\u201dSince almost all the children here were part of some influential family, there was a possibility that the Emperor deemed it too dangerous to keep them here and sent them home. That was why Temple offered them to take a leave of absence during this semester, which was highly unusual. However, unprecedented situations required unprecedented measures.Wait, wasn\u2019t that another vacation, essentially?\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Number 4?\u201dHarriet de Saint-Owan suddenly raised her hand.\u201cWhat happens if I take a leave of absence? Can I just come back next semester?\u201d\u201cNo, if you take a leave of absence now, you have to repeat the semester. We cannot allow students who have not yet taken all the common classes of the first semester to take the common classes of the second semester.\u201dHe basically said that he\u2019d allow us to take a leave of absence, but we had to be aware that we had to repeat the semester. Even though we individually took courses with other professors, common classes were held on Mondays and Thursdays. If one could just skip a semester by taking a leave of absence and immediately get into the second semester, they would have allowed us to just attend one semester a year then.I never actually introduced that leave of absence system properly, to begin with. It was like the system one had in college, but not really.However, now an unprecedented terrorist attack had occurred, so settings that I never even set up started to pop out here and there. The system of being allowed to take a leave of absence if one had to, only got implemented after graduating from Higher Education. Basically in graduate school. Now, they did allow it even in the Higher Education Department, although there was a price to pay for it.Seeing the future get tangled up like this in real time made my brain freeze over.Anyway, if one took a leave of absence it was guaranteed that one would be left behind. They were forced to repeat a year. There was no one who\u2019d actually want to repeat a year, but if it were judged to be too dangerous here, there was nothing that could be done about it.In other words, those who took a leave of absence would drop out from this class.Each member of this class was part of the main story, and if even one of them left, the story would definitely deviate from what I knew. Although it already got twisted beyond recognition, I wouldn\u2019t want it to get twisted even further.Right now it was just a slice-of-life story, but all of them would play important parts in the future, so what would happen if one of them just disappeared for a year?I was in quite the pickle.Moreover, it was Harriet who asked this.\u201cNumber 4, do you want to take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2018s.\u201dHarriet seemed to take in her surroundings, then nearly burst into tears.\u201cMy parents said it was too dangerous\u2026.\u201dNumber A-4. Harriet de Saint-Owan, someone with a magic related talent.Someone I teased regularly because she was quite innocent and cute.She was the youngest and most beloved daughter of the Saint-Owan family. So it was quite plausible for them to get their daughter out of this dangerous city, even if she had to repeat a year.\u201cFollow me after this class.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\u201cTeacher, I would like to receive some counseling as well.\u201d\u201cNumber 3, same goes for you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNot only Harriet, but even Liana de Grantz, a girl with electrokinetic powers who usually stayed silent, raised her hand.If this were to go on, this unprecedented situation of having two people less in class might actually occur.Damn it.My karma was flowing back to me in real time.This karma called Butterfly effect.\u201cAnd Number 11.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201dWhile a lot of complicated thoughts were going through my head, Mr. Epinhauser called out to me. Most of the gazes landing on me all seemed to say the same thing. \u2018What did you do this time?\u2019No, why was I getting treated like someone who\u2019d always create some sort of trouble?\u201cYou were given 1 merit point. You\u2019ll understand even if I don\u2019t tell you why, right?\u201d\u201cHuh. Ah. Yes.\u201dThen I remembered that the nurse teacher told me that I\u2019d get 1 merit point for saving Ellen.Everyone was astonished that this troublemaker actually received a merit point.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Even if they had to repeat a year, their parents wouldn\u2019t allow their children to encounter any danger, but those guys were part of the main story in the end. Of course, this wouldn\u2019t matter so much if this story would only end with the peaceful Temple life section, but after the gates open, each one of them was an important, powerful player.Each one of them had their own sequence in which they grow and become stronger, but it was impossible to predict what would happen if they were to leave this class. They seemed like surplus fighting power, but each one of them had their place.While I was thinking what to do, Harriet and Liana, who seemed to have gone to counseling, silently took the classes.Regardless of whether those two decided to take that leave of absence or not, the atmosphere in the classroom was similar to all of us standing on a thin sheet of ice over a lake.It seemed like most of my classmates were wondering why I received a merit point, but that wasn\u2019t the reason.\u201cSo, if we substitute this formula like this\u2026.\u201dI could even notice that the teacher was all flustered. The teachers should have educated a lot of precious children of noble families, but now they were acutely aware of a certain thing.It was Bertus\u2019 gaze.Last week, there had been a terrorist attack on the Imperial Capital, and demons were suspected to be the perpetrators. As a result, all festival activities in the Capital were cancelled and the honor and prestige of the Imperial Family as well as the Empire fell to the ground.There probably were rumors that their Victory in the Demon World War was actually a lie.Therefore, it was clear that Bertus was under a lot of pressure, so no one was willing to enter the Prince\u2019s line of sight. That was how uncomfortable they felt.I was in the last row, so I couldn\u2019t see what Bertus, who sat in the front row, looked like. However, everyone was just listening to the class in silence as if they were walking on very thin ice.Likewise, the teacher showed his desire to end this class quickly by only diligently going by the book.* * *Our Lunch break went on for an hour.And even then it still felt like everyone was walking on very thin ice. It was an incredibly bizarre view.It was true that the atmosphere of the Imperial Capital was quite bad, but even inside of Temple it wasn\u2019t any better. However, at lunchtime, when all grades were in the same room eating together, it was downright chilly. Only the sound of the tableware moving quietly could be heard. No one was talking loudly.Of course, Bertus was here, but there was also Charlotte.Although they were only first years, but because they were the Prince and Princess, who obviously were in a very bad mood, even the seniors only ate quietly. It could be felt once again that they had quite the big presence even if they did nothing special in the Royal Class.However, there were some people who had no awareness at all.-Munch, munchEllen Artorius, who just started eating together with me at some point, was someone like that.Of course, she was normally the silent type, so it wasn\u2019t really all that noticeable that she didn\u2019t care. She would just eat, get seconds, and eat some more.But she seemed to be a little noisier than usual.There were about a hundred people sitting in this dining hall, so it felt really creepy just hearing the sound of tableware.Neither Bertus nor Charlotte looked particularly sullen, however, they didn\u2019t look particularly happy either. They were quietly eating. None of those two spoke even a single word.I couldn\u2019t take this either. To be honest, I was quite conscious of these young kids as well.How pathetic is that, someone in their 30s being so conscious of 17-year-old kids?\u201cJust looking around, there\u2019s no one as thick-skinned as you.\u201d\u201c?\u201dEllen was pretty eager to eat without answering back to me.And in this silence, numerous eyes now moved towards me, who opened his mouth.No, I\u2019m just speaking with my own mouth. What\u2019s wrong with that?* * *I was now on a level on which I could somewhat follow the PE class. Of course, I still couldn\u2019t be compared with those stamina monsters though.Perhaps thanks to my steady training, I felt like my physical strength improved tremendously compared to those majoring in magic or other non-combat classes.\u201cReinhardt, don\u2019t use your supernatural power. This is a warning.\u201dJust when I thought I was doing the exercises quite well, the PE teacher called me over. He seemed to think that this sudden jump in strength was only possible if I cheated with my supernatural power.\u201cI didn\u2019t use it though?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you can physically strengthen yourself with your supernatural power. Isn\u2019t that the case?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but\u2026. I didn\u2019t use it just now.\u201dThat was the truth, okay?Of course, when I was sparing with Ellen or training on my own, I kept using it to get used to activating it in real life situations. However, during class, I deliberately did not use it because I was afraid I\u2019d get to hear exactly what I was told just now.The teacher furrowed his brows at my plea.\u201c\u2026Someone who wasn\u2019t even able to run properly just recently had his stamina improved to such a degree? Tell me, who\u2019d believe that?\u201dEven if we had different teachers for each subject, all of them were aware of the kids\u2019 profiles. So even this teacher was aware of the fact that I awakened a supernatural power.This person who was just barely able to kind of run had a sudden jump in stamina, so it seemed like he was convinced that I was using my supernatural power.\u201cNo, but I\u2019m really not using it though?\u201dHowever, it was almost impossible to really prove whether I used it or not. The teacher\u2019s expression wrinkled at my protesting remarks. The atmosphere of the training grounds grew chilly.Everyone was watching me and the teacher while they continued to run.\u201cAre you protesting right now?\u201dThe PE teacher was even able to thoroughly torture the precious children of noblemen like this, so he was quite the stubborn and rough person. If one didn\u2019t have that kind of courage, one wouldn\u2019t be able to make those noble children roll down in the mud.However, when I suddenly confronted him like this, it seemed like a faucet had been turned open.\u201cI\u2019m simply stating the truth, so this can\u2019t be categorized as protesting. I didn\u2019t use my supernatural power.\u201dI\u2019m telling you, I didn\u2019t do it, so that\u2019s the truth, alright?The teacher was opening his eyes wide and was about to say something.\u201cTe, teacher!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What is it, Ludwig?\u201dLudwig, who was running a bit further away, called out to the PE teacher.\u201cReinhardt had been waking up very early every morning and exercised from dawn for some time now! I\u2019ve seen him do it!\u201dLudwig didn\u2019t even ask if I actually needed help and immediately jumped in to defend me. He was basically saying: \u201cReinhardt is training a lot in the morning, so it was only natural for his strength to improve\u201d.Wow, come here, you. Ain\u2019t that just touching, Ludwig? As expected of my main character!After hearing Ludwig\u2019s words, the PE teacher looked down at me.\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen him train alone and with Ellen several times.\u201dEllen, who was running at the same tempo no matter what was happening around her, nodded slowly when she noticed the PE teacher looking at her.\u201cOh, so you were trying hard, huh. Reinhardt, sorry for the misunderstanding.\u201dThe PE teacher meekly admitted his mistake. He seemed to have held prejudice against me. He probably saw me as a troublemaker who\u2019d just pick fights here and there.\u201cYeah, well\u2026. One can\u2019t be suspicious enough, I guess?\u201dThere was no reason for me to say anything more, because the misunderstanding got resolved. I could feel the other students concentrating on their stuff while pretending not to see me.\u201cGood going, Reinhardt!\u201d\u201cAh, thanks.\u201dMeeting this guy every time when I did my morning training helped me out in a pretty weird way.* * *After that hellish training disguised as PE, the kids, with the exception of a few, were still writhing in the shower, letting out deathly groans.And before I knew it, I belonged to the side opposite of the death howl faction. At this point, I, Bertus, Ludwig and Cliffman belonged to it.As soon as they saw my body everyone started to gossip, and even those who didn\u2019t start to gossip seemed surprised by my appearance.When Ludwig saw my body while we were washing up, he winded his eyes in surprise.\u201cReinhardt\u2026. Why is your body like this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like I was super muscular or something.\u201cYour whole body is covered in that. What happened?\u201dIt was my whole body being covered with black bruises.\u201cI sometimes get hit by training swords, fall over or have to roll away to dodge, so I ended up like this.\u201d\u201cAt this rate you might get some internal problems. You should really go see a priest.\u201d\u201cWhy should I do that?\u201dThese throbbing bruises would disappear when I go rest tonight. When I spar with Ellen, ending up like this was actually quite fortunate.Actually, there were people who wouldn\u2019t go get treatment to get used to this kind of pain, you know?I might get seriously hurt sometime in the future, but I wouldn\u2019t want to end up writhing on the ground crying because of the pain, leaving me incapacitated and unable to do my job.Everyone seemed to think that I really was some punk when they saw my body in that state.\u201cSeems like you\u2019re really working hard, Reinhardt. Good.\u201d\u2013 Tap, tapSuddenly, Bertus passed by me and tapped my shoulder.No, you bastard, did you think I\u2019d be happy hearing something like that while we were naked? Everyone seemed to be astonished hearing what Bertus told me.Those seemingly insignificant words were the first Bertus uttered today.Wasn\u2019t that even worse?It seemed like he said this without much thought, which made it seem even more mysterious.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After our PE class, it was time for the closing ceremony. After Mr. Epinhauser finished, the other children began to get ready to go back.Was it because of the stress caused by having to spend this day in total silence? Everyone rushed out of the classroom as if they were escaping from hell. Among them was No. 9, Erich de Lafaeri, who was the most affected.And, as always, he seemed to have this deep-seated compulsion to bully Scarlett, who was about to leave her classroom.As always, seeing Scarlett who was leaving, he hit the back of Scarlett\u2019s head as if on instinct. He seemed to have forgotten the chilly atmosphere from before.\u201cHey. Cursed Eyes.\u201d-Bang!\u201cAck!\u201dAs the sound of the slap to the back of her head reverberated, Scarlett crouched down with a low scream.\u201cI told you not to stand out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe\u2019d always pass her by, leaving some words of contempt like that. It had always been like that, and, as always, everyone just looked the other way, pretending not to see it.It seemed my words to just close her eyes and give him a good smack weren\u2019t effective enough. At this rate, Scarlett would get bullied for a much longer time.However, something happened today.Not to Scarlett, but to Erich.\u201cYou, stand still.\u201dA cold voice that made one\u2019s blood freeze, called out to Erich who was about to pass by.\u201cHuh\u2026. Huh?\u201dNot only Erich stopped in his tracks, but all the students that were about to leave halted their steps as well.It was as if time had stopped for this hallway. Just with a few words from this person, everything came to a halt.That person only told Erich to stand still, but her voice was so cold that everyone just froze in place.\u201cI was trying to stand back and watch just how far you would go, but I just can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201c\u201cHuh, Wha\u2026. What\u2026?\u201dSomeone with a slightly cold gaze stared at Erich and got closer.Ludwig was the one who was supposed to save Scarlett.The only person who could change such a predetermined scenario was someone who wasn\u2019t part of the main story.One of them was me.\u201cWho are you to keep harassing someone under me?\u201dAnd the other was Charlotte de Gardias.\u201cTha, that\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dScarlett came from a humble background, so he messed with her. Even if she was part of Class B, Erich had no intentions of picking a fight with the princess.\u201cWhat is it? Tell me.\u201d\u201cI, I just\u2026. \u00a0She just made me feel bad\u2026.\u201d\u201cFrom my point of view, you make me feel even worse for hitting my classmate who was just standing there. And for what reason? Because of her eyes and hair?\u201dErich was doing what he normally did, but he happened to enrage Charlotte by doing that. Usually, she might have let this go because she didn\u2019t want to attract attention, but Charlotte wasn\u2019t in her usual state at the moment.Seeing this situation with how she currently was, probably was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201cHey, what\u2019s the matter? Okay. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201dBertus intervened as the atmosphere was becoming more and more tense. Charlotte glanced at Bertus.\u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to him?\u201d\u201cOf course, he\u2019s done something horrible, so I\u2019ll make sure he won\u2019t do it again in the future\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay, please do so. Take care of your people.\u201dBertus\u2019 face, who was trying to mediate the situation with a smile, froze at those cold words. Charlotte looked at Bertus and smiled, which was close to a sneer.\u201cDon\u2019t let your people do anything that would besmirch the Empire\u2019s honor. Do your best.\u201dAfter Charlotte said that, she had a grin on her lips.\u201cAh, you know I\u2019m talking about Class A, right?\u201dClass B was hers and Class A was his. It seemed like she was talking about that, but I could read the hidden meaning behind her words.It was obvious after looking at Bertus\u2019 expression, which had practically hardened.Bertus was behind the ones who were running the black market.That was why she said that he should take good care of his people.It was an insult to Bertus, telling him to manage his powers and information network better. Charlotte turned around, grabbed Scarlett\u2019s hand, making her stand up and left the classroom together with her.Bertus was stunned for a moment, as if he had never expected to hear such words from her. Of course, it didn\u2019t take that long for him to regain his composure.\u201cErich.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what the exact cause was, but Erich looked extremely pale, maybe because he caused Bertus to be humiliated.\u201cAh, ah\u2026\u2025.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re quite unlucky. My sister is in a very bad mood today.\u201d\u201cAh, uh\u2026. Ah. Yes.\u201dBertus smiled softly and gently patted him on the shoulder. He looked towards the leaving Charlotte\u2019s back and smiled even more.\u201cI really hope that those two become good friends.\u201dI thought I knew what that guy was thinking.He, rather than feeling insulted, now paid attention to the fact that Charlotte was treating Scarlett as her own.He knew that just by knowing that someone was important to you was some major information.So, it seemed like Bertus wanted Charlotte and Scarlett to become closer.He was one scary guy no matter how one looked at it.And that Bertus now suddenly turned towards me.\u201cBy the way, Reinhardt, would you like to go back and talk with me for a moment?\u201dWhy me?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76After school.Bertus called me to his room, not the terrace where we usually talked.Bertus\u2019 room wasn\u2019t much different from mine. It wasn\u2019t more glamorous or anything else one might associate with a room belonging to a prince.However, for a guy with the talents to become a Sword Master, there were quite a lot of books here. He also had some training equipment, of course, but there were even more completely filled bookshelves in here.What a hard-working villain. It wasn\u2019t all that bad, but it still was scary, as I was now seeing yet another side of him.\u201cLet us drink a cup of tea.\u201d\u201cAh, what? Sure.\u201dBertus brewed a cup of tea for me and himself. Rather than getting served by various people, like in the Imperial Palace, Bertus seemed to like doing things on his own.He didn\u2019t show any sort of overwhelming superiority towards anyone. That made him seem like a good person to others.\u201cSo, did you have a good rest during the holidays?\u201d\u201cNo, things were actually more exhausting than usual.\u201dIn fact, during that terrorist incident, I felt like my head was about to explode, and after that, I was only focusing on training with Ellen. I worked myself to the extreme.Rather, it seemed like my days off were cut extremely short. Bertus laughed loudly.\u201cLooking at your body, it sure seems like it.\u201dHe probably reacted like that because he saw the bruises all over my body, not because of the muscles I build up. It seemed that me gritting my teeth and actually training hard left a good impression on Bertus.If he valued strength, he wouldn\u2019t have gone for me, but Ludwig, who would have been the perfect subordinate for Bertus. He was someone who could go up against Ellen in terms of stamina after all.But why did he call me over? I didn\u2019t think he called me here just to have some tea.\u201cCompared to how you were the first time we had PE, you sure are remarkable. Still, while training yourself is good, you shouldn\u2019t overdo it. You might end up hurting your body. We\u2019re still growing after all, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be.\u201dBertus warned me several times that excessive training wasn\u2019t good while one was still in their growing period. I was of the same opinion. I didn\u2019t ask him anything. I didn\u2019t want to appear too on guard after all.\u201cHonestly, I only called you over because I was curious about something, nothing more.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow did you and Ellen become friends?\u201dWasn\u2019t it enough for him to focus on his own situation? Why was he asking me something like this all of a sudden? Bertus shook his head and laughed.\u201cNo, well, I tried talking to her a few times to get closer to her, but no matter what I did she\u2019d always just give me some curt answers\u2026. But you actually trained with her. You two talk a lot, right? I wonder if there\u2019s a trick behind it.\u201dObviously, Ellen didn\u2019t speak to any other classmate other than me. If they knew about her background there probably would be many, who would try to forcefully get close to her, however, Bertus knew.Ellen\u2019s image in class at the moment was that she was extremely talented, but also really blunt, so she was a bit hard to approach. It probably was something like that.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to put it into words.\u201dCome to think of it, it kind of just happened, so I couldn\u2019t really tell him how I got closer to her when he asked.\u201cHuh\u2026. To be honest, I feel like I never actually had the intentions of getting closer to her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You really have no idea.\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dBertus sighed at my silly reply.I wasn\u2019t actually that nice to her. Strictly speaking, after I teased and poked at her, we suddenly became like this. Sometimes we would eat together, sometimes we would have some snacks together, and sometimes we would walk home together, then we suddenly just became friends.Of course, even though we did become friends, nothing much had changed.\u201cAnyway, Reinhardt, aren\u2019t you strangely capable? You\u2019re saying it was an accident more or less, but you did end up getting close to Ellen, who is the hardest to get close to, right?\u201dAnd even Bertus, who said that talents at this level were worthless, seemed to severely overestimate Ellen\u2019s ability. Of course, he was probably more focused on her background though.\u201cI\u2019m asking just in case, but do you like her?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No, not at all.\u201dWe got along, but not like that. Why was Bertus asking me these things all of a sudden? He was staring at me as if he was trying to read my true intentions.\u201cHmm\u2026. Well. Yeah. What\u2019s strange about you is that you don\u2019t seem to have any interest in any of the girls at all. Didn\u2019t you tease Saint-Owan quite severely?\u201dBertus giggled, wondering if I just treated all girls that way.\u201cI guess I\u2019m not old enough to be interested in them yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you at the age in which one usually gets really interested in girls though?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe I am though.\u201dI spoke as if I wasn\u2019t the one we were talking about. To me, they were just cute little brats. How nice it would have been if they were just a bit older.\u201cBut why are you asking if I like her?\u201d\u201cHmm, why indeed?\u201dBertus smiled, but didn\u2019t give me an answer. He seemed to have some kind of intention, but I just couldn\u2019t fathom what it was. Well, I didn\u2019t see how this guy would ever tell me anything honestly.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit late, but about this incident.\u201dAs if he didn\u2019t want to talk about this subject anymore he tried to change it.Still, considering what I knew about his setting, he probably was very interested in Ellen\u2019s power, not in her as a person. This wouldn\u2019t change, even in the future.So there wasn\u2019t any reason for him to be interested in whether I liked Ellen or not. Why did he ask\u2026?\u201cSo, what do you think about this incident?\u201dBertus brought up a topic that was much too large for just a simple subject change.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dHence, I doubted my ears when I heard him mention it.\u201cThis incident. You heard about it, didn\u2019t you?\u201dNo matter how favorably he looked upon me, why would he ask someone from the streets for their opinion on something like that? Obviously, because I was someone from the streets, so he might think there weren\u2019t any clear boundaries that bound me\u2026.\u201cErm\u2026. I heard about it\u2026. I think it wasn\u2019t that big a deal though.\u201dI tried to give a very vague answer that an ordinary person would give. The demons caused a terrorist attack in the Imperial Capital, but it wasn\u2019t actually that big an incident, right?Bertus nodded his head slowly while letting out a low hum.\u201cIs that all?\u201dBertus looked at me and asked me again, seeming as if there was an answer he was hoping for me to give. Of course, if I seriously thought about it, I didn\u2019t know if I could actually give him a satisfactory answer that was different from the perspective the perpetrator of the case had. It was already dangerous enough for me to comment on this. I might end up talking about things that I shouldn\u2019t know after all.Bertus didn\u2019t seem to doubt me though. He wasn\u2019t really interrogating me.However, he did seem to want me to give him an unusual answer.It felt like he was testing my insight.Then an answer I could give him appeared in my mind.\u201cWell\u2026. I\u2019m wondering how this could happen just after the Demon World War ended. Why did they do it\u2026.? Did they have some sort of conflict with the Knights Templar? Maybe they had a reason that wasn\u2019t generally known\u2026. Something like that? I\u2019m still in Temple, so I don\u2019t really know the details.\u201dThat was the thing Ellen once told me. There might have been other reasons that were left unseen. Otherwise, there would be no need for the demons to fight the Knights Templar without any bigger goal.As if he found my words valid, Bertus nodded his head.\u201cThe cause of this incident, huh?\u2026. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell you the details, but yeah, those are valid questions.\u201dGoing by the analogy Charlotte used, it seemed that the one\u2019s behind the black market were part of Bertus\u2019 camp. No matter if Bertus took the initiative in this or not, they eventually tried to open an illegal auction, and information about that was leaked to the demons.That was why she sarcastically told him to manage his people better. It was the first time in history that there was a terrorist attack in the Imperial Capital, as well as this slaughter of hordes of demons.But Bertus didn\u2019t actually look all too bothered. Assuming that he actually showed how he felt right now.\u201cAs you know, there is no one else in Temple to whom I could talk to normally, except you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Yes.\u201dSomeone who knew his true self, he could talk to, to some extent. Even though he was part of the Imperial Family, Bertus actually didn\u2019t have anyone to really talk to in Temple.Everyone wasn\u2019t that strong yet, and Bertus held a gentle image at the moment. He folded his arms and furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cIt\u2019s a mess. However, even though everything ended up like this, I\u2019m wondering if this really is such a bad thing.\u201dThis was quite the shocking remark for the Imperial Prince to make.Bertus didn\u2019t even bother to warn me that I\u2019d be dead if I told this to anyone. He probably thought, I\u2019d be smart enough to know that I shouldn\u2019t spread this around.But how could this not be a bad thing?The black market he planned on opening got destroyed. The prestige and honor of the Imperial Family got smeared, and they gave their political opponents a gap to attack. So how was this not a bad thing?\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDo you think the system of a single Empire dominating the entire human continent could have been possible without the demons?\u201dMy eyes twitched at Bertus\u2019 words.\u201cWithout a common enemy, humans wouldn\u2019t be able to unite.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, shall I put it differently? Humans create enemies so that they can unite. That\u2019s how targets like Scarlett are created.\u201dHumans needed a common enemy to unite. In order to unite, they deliberately made someone an enemy who wasn\u2019t actually one.In small groups this would be called bullying.On a bigger scale, it was the state announcing a country their enemy and inducing the people to unite under one banner.Humans only united when they had a common enemy. And those who wanted to induce such unity created artificial enemies.That was what Bertus was talking about.Examples for that were the Nazis and the Allied Forces, the communists and the capitalists and those other numerous conflicting factions.In the end, Bertus was saying that this concept wasn\u2019t much different from bullying.Creating enemies to unite.\u201cNow that the Demon World War was over, the Empire\u2019s situation would gradually become more unstable. The enemy we as a species faced together is now gone, so now would be the time to sate one\u2019s own greed again.\u201dThe existence of this gigantic adversary called the Demon Realm became a great cause for the humans to unite.That was how this Empire could exist. It was thanks to no one else but the Demon Realm, but now that the War ended in the humans\u2019 victory, they didn\u2019t have an enemy left to defeat now. So Bertus was predicting that the Empire would end up divided in the future.Actually, I once thought about proceeding with such a storyline after I ran out of slice-of-life material.I was planning on creating a scenario in which the Empire fell apart, leading to a war between the different nations.However, in the end, I decided on that Gate opening thing, not that scenario.Bertus, of course, didn\u2019t know about the Gates yet, so he was predicting the most likely scenario to happen with his current knowledge.Humans who lost their common enemy would end up dividing again, so although the Empire had entered its golden age at the moment, humans would start wars among themselves again because of various reasons.If the Gates didn\u2019t appear, history would certainly flow into that direction.\u201cBut at a time like this, the demons did something like that in the middle of the Imperial Capital.\u201dThe power of the Demon Realm, which was thought to have died down completely, led a team to the Imperial Capital.Therefore, the people\u2019s fear of the Demon Realm got reignited, and the Empire would be able to maintain this solidarity just like before as long as this fear existed.\u201cFear is very effective for governing a country as well as uniting its people.\u201dTherefore, even though Bertus suffered a considerable loss, and the people were absolutely terrified because of this incident, he evaluated that this event was something necessary for the Empire.It was true that he took some damage, but Bertus was looking even further ahead. The demons\u2019 terrorist attack actually helped maintain the Empire.In fact, Bertus already knew that the Darklands wouldn\u2019t be able to pose a threat to the humans. So, he wasn\u2019t bothered about those demons, who were only remnants. They wouldn\u2019t be able to destroy the Empire or inflict any significant damage. In the end, their existence was beneficial for the Empire.I had to agree to a certain extent to Bertus\u2019 bold opinion.Looking at how he was at thinking, it actually seemed like he\u2019d be rather happy to know that a Demon King candidate was still alive. If the existence of an enemy nation helped keep the humans\u2019 unity, he probably would want the Demon Prince to rebuild his power.Of course, that was just another reason for me not to reveal my identity. Bertus seemed to try to see if I was able to think so far ahead. Or, maybe he just wanted to see if I agreed to him.I didn\u2019t know what reaction would be good. I also didn\u2019t know what Charlotte thought about this matter.It was quite the strange feeling, seeing the mastermind of it all analyzing this incident.I wondered if Airi and Eleris were doing well.That was it.I had more important things to worry about.Harriet de Saint-Owan and Liana de Grantz.I had to somehow stop these two from taking their leave of absence. I wasn\u2019t really a close friend to Harriet no matter how one looked at it, and I never even spoke a word with Liana de Grantz.What should I do? I could say something to Harriet, but in Liana\u2019s case, if someone she didn\u2019t even talk to usually told her to not take a leave of absence, she probably wouldn\u2019t even pretend to listen to me.* * *After dinner.Putting all my worries aside, I went to look for Harriet in the dormitories.And that was where the problem lay.\u201c\u2026\u2026Where did she go?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t in the magic lab, not in her private room, not in the lobby and not in the dining room.Come to think of it, I only knew Ellen\u2019s encounter spots. If Harriet wasn\u2019t in the dorm, she was somewhere outside\u2026Fortunately, there was still someone I could ask. Although Harriet wasn\u2019t in the magic lab, there was another person.I went back to the magic lab and opened the door abruptly.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHu, huh?\u201dThe girl who answered back seemed slightly frightened.This person was the only one beside Harriet who majored in magic in Class A. So, they should know each other well.Number A-7, Adelia.Her talents were summoning magic and magic crafting.So her specialty lay in creating things with her magic. Her talent for magic crafting was very crucial.She could create things like Magic Lanterns on a small scale with her magic crafting, but later on, on a large scale, she\u2019d be able to design things like magic trains.I had never talked to her, but I thought she was quite scared of me because of the things I did.\u201cWhere did the idiot go?\u201d\u201cI, idi\u2026. Idiot?\u201dJust me calling Harriet an idiot made her feel terrified.\u201cCome on. Where did she go? I can\u2019t find her.\u201dI visibly saw the gears moving in her head. If she told me where Harriet was in this situation, she\u2019d admit that her friend\u2019s nickname was Idiot. Her lips quivered while she quietly mumbled something.\u201cFricking hell. Did I do anything to you? I\u2019m just asking you where she is.\u201dWhy was she trying to make me out to be the bad guy here? Honestly, I\u2019ve never kicked someone\u2019s ass who hadn\u2019t tried something with me, okay? Why was she like this?\u2026When I thought about it, that might actually be useful.When I went towards her, she nervously shook her head.\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026. She went to the communicator\u2026.\u201dIn the end, she had to admit that Harriet\u2019s nickname was Idiot, so her guilt was evident on her face.\u201cOh, she\u2019s there?\u201dAlthough, the disadvantage of communicators was that the person one wanted to reach needed one as well, there were some places in the Royal Class\u2019 dormitory in which one could use magic devices for communication. I didn\u2019t really have a use for that, but if one\u2019s parents were powerful and rich enough to have such communication tools, one would be able to keep in touch with their parents regularly.Anyway, it seemed like Harriet was there at the moment.Adelia kept looking at me as if she wanted me to leave if my business with her was over.Harriet didn\u2019t go that far away, so this probably meant that she\u2019d go back to the dormitory pretty soon. Adelia kept looking at me as if she couldn\u2019t do anything else because of my presence.\u201cHey, talk with me.\u201d\u201cHu, huh? Y, you and me?\u201d\u201cWho else is here besides us?\u201dAdelia was shaking hard. It seemed like she was about to die of fear.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: 77If the regular encounter spot of the ones with combat talents was the training room, the encounter spot of the ones with magical talents was the magic lab. Although it was possible to set up a research area in one\u2019s private rooms, this facility was obviously better equipped.There were only two people with magical talents in Class A, so both of them used this place regularly. No one else but those two came into this room, so there were a lot of things that seemed like personal items scattered around the place.No one knew what of these things were actually important, so this place wouldn\u2019t get cleaned unless they requested it.Therefore, this place was a mess.\u201cYou sure party in here quite a bit, huh?\u201dI had no idea why there were plates that seemed like they were eaten from piled on one side. Why were there clothes scattered everywhere as well? I sat down on a sofa located next to a really messy table.Adelia also sat down across from me, with her face pale.\u201cHey, ask someone to clean up here. Seriously. What\u2019s all this? Is it so hard to ask someone, when you don\u2019t even try cleaning this shit up yourself?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026. okay\u2026.\u201dLooking like a kid being scolded for something, Adelia lowered her head and answered in a teeny tiny voice. I didn\u2019t know a lot about these pieces of research equipment, but I was pretty sure this mess wasn\u2019t necessary to use them.\u201cBy the way, do you think she\u2019ll\u00a0take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201cI think so\u2026.\u201dAdelia muttered in a sullen voice. Harriet and Adelia were in the same major, so they probably were pretty close. Harriet originally despised the lower class and had a strong sense of superiority, so she really hated commoners. But Adelia was a commoner. It looked like even Harriet couldn\u2019t stand being all alone, so she treated her well as an exception. That was how it ended up.\u201cWhat will you do if she quits?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t want her to do that\u2026.\u201dIt seemed that Adelia didn\u2019t like that Harriet would take a leave of absence from school. As I was in front of her, she kept wiggling her hands and feet like a small animal.It was true that I was putting her on the spot here, but this was really uncomfortable. It felt like I was harassing her.Anyway, Adelia hated the idea of Harriet leaving Temple.\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t it be good to try to convince her to stay here?\u201dIt sure would be nice if she did the work for me. At my words, Adelia raised her head and looked at me.She seemed astonished.\u201cH, how could I\u2026.? Harriet is a very, very powerful noble, how could I ask something like that of her\u2026?\u201dSince both of them were still part of Temple, Adelia was able to be friendly with Harriet, but she would probably have a hard time communicating with her. The gap of their social status was very large, so Adelia was probably always thinking about what she could and couldn\u2019t say to her, or if she was even allowed to be friendly with a girl like Harriet.\u201cFricking hell. If you wanna do something, do it. Why do you have to put so much thought into that?\u201dFirst of all, students were to follow the principle of equality inside of Temple, meaning their status was not to be mentioned. Of course, there were people like me who took it literally as is, and there were people like Mayarton, who abused this system, however, there were also a lot of people who couldn\u2019t let go of their status.Most of them were royals and nobles, but there were also a lot of commoners with that problem. Commoners like Adelia. At my words, her eyes shook.\u201cI, I can\u2019t\u2026. I\u2019m too scared\u2026.\u201dAdelia didn\u2019t seem to understand me, who was casually bullying all the kids.\u201cWho am I to say something against the Grand Duke of Saint-Owan\u2019s decision\u2026?\u201dShe felt like she didn\u2019t deserve to say anything about this matter. Rather, she seemed to think that saying something would be rude towards Harriet as well as disrespectful towards her father, the Grand Duke of Saint-Owan.Woah. That was bringing negative thinking to a new level. Some of the kids in Class A were so self-confident that I could hurl, but someone with such low self-esteem also was a pain in the ass, albeit for slightly different reasons.\u201cJeez, someone like you would end up suffering through hardship for her entire life.\u201d\u201cWh, why are you saying something like that to me\u2026.\u201dAdelia, who seemed quite restless, whined slightly to my harsh words and quickly covered her mouth in surprise. She thought I\u2019d get angry because she talked back to me.If Harriet was an idiot, then she would be a scaredy-cat.A cute little scaredy-cat.Harriet was difficult to deal with for her because she was an aristocrat, and she was afraid of me because I was a bully even though I was a commoner, same as her.She was someone who was scared easily like that. Adelia\u2019s eyes shook slightly again before she asked me in a quiet voice.\u201cB, but you\u2026. You also don\u2019t want Harriet to take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t.\u201dHer eyes widened at my simple answer. That reaction had a lot of meaning behind it.Weren\u2019t you guys on bad terms?I thought you would like it if Harriet took the semester off.Did that mean\u2026.Do you like her?Oh, so that was why you\u2019ve been harrassing Harriet up until now\u2026.Wow.This was the first time I held a conversation with this kid, but I could read her mind just by looking at her eyes.And then.-Katchak\u201cAdelia? Here you a\u2026.\u201dHarriet opened the bulky door to the magic lab and entered. When she saw me she immediately froze up.Harriet\u2019s face turned pale as she saw me placed in front of Adelia, talking with her.\u201cY, you\u2026. W, why. Why\u2026. are you here?\u201d\u201cWhat? Is there a reason why I shouldn\u2019t be here?\u201dWas there some sort of rule that only magic majors could enter the magic lab? Harriet\u2019s face turned even paler, then it suddenly started to grow redder and redder.She was staring at me and this messy lab alternately.In fact, there weren\u2019t only dirty plates scattered about, but also various pieces of clothes.These guys totally used this shared space as a two-person studio. It probably felt like some guy just entered their room.She looked like the person she least wanted to see this just randomly strolled in here.\u201cGet. G, get ooooooooooooooooooout!\u201dSoon, that girl let out a shout that was close to a scream.Of course, I wouldn\u2019t get out of here.No way in hell.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re paying rent for this place or something, so you can\u2019t just tell me to leave, you know?\u201d\u201cGet out! Get out! Get out! Hurry and get out!\u201dShe turned so red that one might mistake her for a tomato, then she grabbed my arm and tried to drag me away. Look at that kid, who was so afraid of me even touching her cheeks, grabbing me directly like that.\u201cHey man, you\u2019re wearing out my clothes! Do you have any idea how much these cost?\u201dThey were probably really cheap, right?It wasn\u2019t anything high quality, but they were still the casual clothes Eleris bought for me!\u201cGetoutgetoutgetoutgetout!\u201d\u201cHey, did I curse at you or was I mean? What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d\u201cAaaaaaaaaarg! Ag! Arg!\u201dHarriet, who repeated \u201cGet out\u201d like some broken record, eventually managed to drag me out of the magic lab.No, I mean, it wasn\u2019t like this was something you couldn\u2019t show anyone. It\u2019s normal for kids to be a little messy, so why were you doing this?After some time, she slightly opened the door to the magic lab and only poked her head out. The redness on her face indicated that she still felt quite embarrassed.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dThat girl was asking me with such a vigilant look on her face, as if she was asking me what the hell I was doing in her magic lab.\u201cI was looking for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Me?\u201dSomehow, her face managed to become even redder.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I thought she would shout something like \u201cWhy would I even talk to someone like you?!\u201d, but after staying quiet for a bit, she quietly came out of the lab.\u201cCan\u2019t we talk inside?\u201d\u201cNo! Only over my dead body!\u201dHarriet screamed. I wasn\u2019t there to steal their research results or something, and I already saw how messy that place was. Nothing would change if I looked at it more than I already did, you know?Kids are just so\u2026.In the end, I took her to the dining hall. Dinner time was still far away, so there wasn\u2019t anyone in the dining hall.Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t have to make her follow me at all. She didn\u2019t say much, but she did follow me there quite obediently. We sat down across from each other.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dIt was the attitude of someone who graciously decided to listen to whatever bullshit I had to say. She was surprisingly cooperative. Without much further ado, I went straight to the point.\u201cAre you going to take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What is it to you? How nice. I don\u2019t have to see your ugly visage for a whole year, you bastard.\u201dHarriet seemed kind of intimidated. It seemed like she wanted to tell me how nice it would be to live without having to see my face, and that it was none of my business.\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take a leave of absence.\u201dHarriet\u2019s face contorted strangely hearing this request that sounded more like a command.Her face was growing even redder though. Suddenly, steam seemed to rise from her head, she was even fanning herself.She looked like she hit her face on a wall.\u201cHuh! H, huh! W, what\u2026? What?! H, hah! Oh. Yeah, what\u2026 What?!\u201dA, aren\u2019t you making it a bit too obvious?Then she stared at me with her arms folded after she cooled down her face by fanning it with her hands.\u201cWhy should I listen to you?\u201dNo, I only told you not to take a leave of absence. I didn\u2019t say that because I like you or something. Why are you looking at me with such anticipation? If I say it\u2019s because I like you, you\u2019d just go \u201cHmph! But of course, it is such a great honor to talk to someone as angelic as me after all!\u201d. I could clearly see that she was ready to say these types of things.\u201cWell\u2026.I don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re imagining right now, but wouldn\u2019t this mean that you can only return to school next year if you take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet\u2019s expression hardened when she heard my words.It seemed like she had an idea what I was talking about. I smiled as I looked at Harriet.\u201cThen you\u2019d become my junior. Are you fine with that?\u201d\u201cSo, something like that won\u2019t ha, ha, happen! First-graders are just first-graders!\u201dHey, she seemed hella worried about that. Even if I always teased her by calling her an idiot, she really wasn\u2019t one.She must have clearly simulated what would happen after she came back from her one-year absence.She was obviously shivering in fear of what Reinhardt, who loved to torment her, would do.\u201cNext year, it will be my turn to educate our cute juniors, you know? Do you think you can afford that?\u201d\u201cNonsense! You said you didn\u2019t like this stuff! You said these kinds of traditions were bad!\u201dSo, in the end Harriet got all excited about the stuff I babbled during the duel.\u201cI don\u2019t really like being on the receiving end of it, but maybe I\u2019ll enjoy being on the other side though?\u201dHarriet\u2019s mouth gaped wide open as I displayed my crazy hypocrisy.\u201cYou\u2019re the worst! You\u2019re actually crazy!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see, how about 100 push-ups followed by\u00a0goosesteps, fifty rounds around the training field.\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dHarriet began to tremble and her face turned red again.Ah.It was so funny seeing her immediately react to my teasing compared to Ellen, who didn\u2019t have much of a reaction to most things.\u201cSo if you don\u2019t want to be teased to death by me as your senior, wouldn\u2019t it be better not to take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201cYooou! This! You! You really! Really\u2026. Really\u2026.\u201dEventually, Harriet started to tremble.\u2026You see this shit?Following this narrative, I knew what would happen next.\u201cUuuuuuurg! You\u2026 You bad apple\u2026. You garbage person\u2026. Sob, sob!\u201dHarriet suddenly burst into tears.\u201cI don\u2019t want to take off a semester either! I really don\u2019t want to\u2026. Sob, sob! Booohooohoo! I\u2019d rather die than become the junior of a beggar like you! I\u2019ll never go bahaahack to Temple!\u201dEven while we were classmates, she seemed to want to quit Temple just by imagining that I\u2019d become her senior.I got to know one thing though.Harriet de Saint-Owan had no intention of taking a leave of absence from Temple.Adelia was right.Judging by both of their words, her parents, the Grand Duke of Saint-Owan to be precise, were forcing her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Harriet cried endlessly, so I eventually tried to pat her back.Obviously, she started to cry even more, telling me not to touch her.Not knowing how to soothe a crying kid, I took out some candy from the dining room\u2019s storage and gave it to her.She said that she didn\u2019t want to eat it, and when I forcibly pushed it into her mouth, she pretended like she wasn\u2019t going to eat it, while actually eating it.It was so fatally cute, seeing her eating it while crying and denying she would, just because I teased her a bit.10 out of 10\u2026.Seeing her bite and suck on the candy, there was nothing cuter in this world.\u201cJust because I was joking around a bit, you end up trembling and crying like a three-year-old brat. Are you a little brat? Do you actually think I\u2019d do that?\u201dWhile that girl stopped crying and slowly sucked at her candy with her eyes closed, I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and just shut my mouth. Then she suddenly opened her eyes and stared at me.\u201cYou would! Even if you won\u2019t do it to other kids, you\u2019d definitely do it to me!\u201dHuh. I thought she was being surprisingly straightforward.Even if I wouldn\u2019t do it to other kids, if she took a leave of absence and returned a year later, she thought I\u2019d absolutely tease her to death.She originally was a kid much smarter than me, after all. She accurately predicted a behavioral pattern I didn\u2019t even know I had. At first, she took my telling her not to take a leave of absence as a type of confession, then I teased her for that.That was how I was acting around her.If I had a daughter, I thought that I would absolutely tease her the same way I do to her. Gaaah! The more she cried, the more excited I would get, leading to more teasing.There was a 100% chance that I\u2019d treat her that way.Harriet seemed confident that if she took a leave of absence, she would end up leading a hellish Temple life as Reinhardt\u2019s junior.\u201cNo, well\u2026. Honestly, after listening to you, I can\u2019t deny that I would do it. So why are you even taking a semester off, then? Is there some sort of problem?\u201d\u201cAnd what are you going to do with that information?\u201dAfter asking me what I would do with that information, Harriet turned her head with a \u201cHmpf\u201d.No matter how much you ignored me, despised me and teased me for being a beggar, it was no use.You had already lost as soon as you followed me here and talked to me.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of telling you? You don\u2019t seriously think that you can do anything for me, right?\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t really have any good ideas, but we might come up with something as we talked. And if we couldn\u2019t come up with something, and she still wants to absolutely stay in this class, I could always use \u201cRevise\u201d. I wasn\u2019t sure how many points it would take to make the Grand Duke of Saint-Owan say that Harriet didn\u2019t have to take a leave of absence, though.Harriet seemed to stare at me, narrowing her eyes. She certainly didn\u2019t seem to trust me. This probably was similar to grabbing at straws for her.\u201cWon\u2019t it be good for you if I take a leave of absence? You\u2019ll get to bully me as much as you want then.\u201dHarriet seemed to be thinking about this completely differently. She thought I\u2019d be happy, because I\u2019d be able to bully her to my heart\u2019s content, so she was wondering why I didn\u2019t want her to take that leave.\u201cAh, that was a joke. I don\u2019t want you to take a leave of absence.\u201dThere were some very complicated reasons behind this, but it would be hard for me to explain them to her.\u201cWhy\u2026. do you not want me to leave?\u201dFrickin hell.Why do I have to keep playing along with this girl?\u2026She was so excited.God damn it.\u201cIt\u2019s fun just being with you.\u201dAh.Honestly, it really was kind of fun. Harriet wrinkled her brows, giving an impression as if she thought that she was an idiot for even expecting anything from me.\u201cHey! You just want me not to take a leave of absence to keep teasing me after all!\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s important are the results! You don\u2019t want to take the semester off! I don\u2019t want you to take a leave of absence! Regardless of my reasons, our purpose is the same, right?\u201dHarriet seemed to cuss me out with her eyes. No, I mean, if our goals are the same, what did it matter what my reasons were?Just looking at her, her attitude was rather ambiguous as to whether she liked me or not. Now she had a really disgusted expression on her face. Well, people can like some parts and hate other parts that make up a person.In other words, people were like cheonggukjang.At first it might have smelled like \u201cEw!\u201d but at some point, one might start thinking differently like:Ah.This.Maybe I didn\u2019t actually hate it that much.I kind of want to taste it again after such a long time\u2026.Was it something like this?Anyway, Harriet was really annoyed right now, but she eventually opened her mouth after probably thinking that it couldn\u2019t get any worse anyway.\u201cDad\u2026. told me to take a leave of absence. Repeatedly.\u201dAs was expected.* * *Harriet began to explain her situation.When the news of the terrorist attack on the Imperial Capital first got spread, the Grand Duke wasn\u2019t outside of the Saint-Owan Grand Duchy. He actually was in the Imperial Capital. As the Empire\u2019s victory celebrations were underway, almost all the powerful nobles should have been in the Imperial Capital at the time.Harriet didn\u2019t return to the Grand Duchy to meet him, she was still in the Capital. In that case, she could have just returned to Temple immediately, but she didn\u2019t.\u201cI was told that even Temple was too dangerous, because something like that happened in the middle of the Imperial Capital. That\u2019s why I stayed with Dad all the time\u2026.\u201dAfter the terrorist attack, the festival as well as all official events connected to it were canceled. Grand Duke Saint-Owan probably kept Harriet somewhere in the vicinity of the Palace or outside the Imperial Capital to protect her. He probably thought it was only natural for him to protect his own daughter with his own hands, at a time when the Capital\u2019s security was already compromised.The Saint-Owan Grand Duchy was incredibly advanced in the field of magic, and the Grand Duke\u2019s family was originally a wizard family. Therefore, it was more or less already set in stone that Harriet de Saint-Owan was born with the most outstanding talent out of all the wizard bloodlines.She was gifted with the tremendous talent to wield all kinds of magic, including summoning, offensive magic, support magic, magic crafting, mind spells, alchemy and even black magic. Harriet possessed a completely broken talent to masterfully comprehend and acquire any magic in existence.In other words, as the Saint-Owan family was a family with its roots in magic, the Grand Duke would already be a grand wizard of a high level. He actually participated in the Demon World War after all.Grand Duke Saint-Owan was currently one of the most powerful wizards the Empire had to offer.He was more than capable to look after his own daughter, as such he couldn\u2019t allow her to continue to attend Temple now that the Imperial Capital\u2019s security was compromised. He\u2019d rather have her attend a magic school in their territory or teach her directly, even if the education wouldn\u2019t be as good as what Temple could offer.Quite frankly, if that wasn\u2019t the case, she wouldn\u2019t have the need to attend Temple in the first place.\u201cHearing that, wouldn\u2019t he just kept you at his side then?\u2026. How did you manage to return to Temple?\u201dIt seemed like Harriet was only able to temporarily return after she whined, cried and made a huge fuss in front of her father who tried to stop her from going back to Temple.However, he probably heard that it was possible for her to take a leave of absence, so she could continue attending Temple, but only after a year. That was perhaps the compromise Grand Duke Saint-Owan acquiesced to.A year should be enough for them to catch the culprit and stabilize the Imperial Capital.The Grand Duke\u2019s words were rather reasonable, actually. Rather, Harriet, who insisted on not taking a leave of absence, was the unreasonable one here.However, the most important thing was that I was pretty damn sure that no more terrorist attacks by demons would occur from this point on. Of course, I couldn\u2019t actually predict the future clearly, but the possibility of Harriet being involved in acts of violence by demons was practically nonexistent.Although, she already was heavily involved in acts of bullying caused by a certain demon.Anyway, I was the only one who knew that the Grand Duke\u2019s worries were completely unwarranted at this point.\u201cTry crying and whining that you don\u2019t want to take a leave of absence.\u201d\u201cI already di\u2026!\u201dOf course, what she tried to say was that she already did that, but that girl suddenly got startled and quickly covered her mouth. She thought that I might make fun of her again if she told me that she cried while whining to her parents.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine for kids to whine and cry. That\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, you know?\u201dIt would be shameful for me to do something like that, but her doing that was fine. At my words, Harriet\u2019s expression turned into a gloomy one. Her face turned beet red again and she let her head hang down slightly.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work\u2026.\u201dIn the end, she confessed that she was crying and whining desperately. From the Grand Duke\u2019s point of view, he wouldn\u2019t just let his daughter go just because she was screaming and shouting. Her life was on the line, after all.\u201cHmm\u2026. What should we do?\u201dI couldn\u2019t come up with any logical reason for the Grand Duke to let his daughter continue to attend Temple this year. At my vague musings, Harriet opened her closed eyes and stared at me.\u201cWhat? So you can\u2019t come up with anything as well after all.\u201d\u201cNo, I just said that we should think about this together. Did I say that I knew how to solve this?\u201d\u201cHmpf!\u201d\u201cShit needs some pushing force to get out as well, right? So, let\u2019s be that force together.\u201d\u201cEeeeew! You\u2019re so dirty! I feel like throwing up!\u201d\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you shit?\u201d\u201cEww! Urg! Aah!\u201dAs if she was pretending that she couldn\u2019t hear me, Harriet was covering her ears and screamed. It seemed that the more she talked with me, the worse she felt instead of coming to an answer.It wouldn\u2019t make any sense to tell him that she\u2019d lag behind if she were to take a leave of absence now. This kid was special in more ways than one, so the Grand Duke might just hire numerous wizards from his territory to personally train her.How about a childish reason like she doesn\u2019t want to be separated from her friends? Grand Duke Saint-Owan might just tell her she\u2019d see them again in a year anyway.There was little reason to let Harriet continue to attend Temple.Justification.I wondered whether it was really necessary for a kid to take such a long break from school, but we didn\u2019t have any justification. I was completely sure that it would be safe, but I doubted the Grand Duke would believe that\u2026.No, I mean, even the Prince and the Princess were calmly attending Temple, so how come the Grand Duke was acting this way even though he\u2019s just some little fart compared to them?I suddenly got mad.Ah. Come to think of it, that\u2019s right.How about using that line of reasoning?\u201cThe Prince and the Princess are just calmly attending Temple. Right?\u201dBoth of them didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions of taking a leave of absence. The Imperial Palace and Temple were both in the Imperial Capital to begin with, so taking a leave of absence was pretty much meaningless.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh.\u201d\u201cBut if you suddenly take a leave of absence in this situation, wouldn\u2019t the two of them think slightly badly of the Saint-Owan Family?\u201d\u201cH, huh? Tha, that\u2019s\u2026. What are you talking about?\u201dHarriet paled when I suddenly mentioned the prince and princess.\u201cNo, that would work. Both of these precious people still went to Temple even after this incident took place in the Capital, you, on the other hand, who\u2019s just from a Grand Duchy, are taking a leave of absence because the Capital is too dangerous. If we just expand on this a little more, couldn\u2019t we make it out to be the Grand Duke ignoring the security Temple has to offer and thus completely ignoring the Prince and Princess\u2019 security?\u201d\u201cHuuh\u2026?\u201dOf course, everything depended on how one said something. In fact, if one had to decide whether those two would or wouldn\u2019t care about this matter, it was safe to say that they probably didn\u2019t care. However, there was a possibility that it could turn into an issue as long as we brought it up like this.And these were quite sensitive times.The Royal Class also was on edge because of the Prince and Princess. So the atmosphere inside the Imperial Palace would be even more tense.To say something like \u201cI\u2019m making her take a leave of absence because it\u2019s to dangerous here!\u201d would be quite the thing during these sensitive times.Besides, she was classmates with the Prince of all people, not just any ordinary Temple student.Depending on how one interpreted this situation, it could be possible to infer that this was quite offending towards the Prince. While the Prince was still devastated by this terrorist attack, the little princess of the Saint-Owan Grand Duchy decided to take a leave of absence, because she thought Temple was much too dangerous.This could be read as the act of throwing boulders at a very thin sheet of ice.\u201cBertus and you are even in the same class. And even though it might not be intentional, you might end up hurting the Prince with these actions. Additionally, though the Capital might have experienced this type of incident, the Imperial Family still held the most authority since its foundation right now. If you lose favor of either of them, you might face a lot of problems later on. It\u2019s also very important to note that this isn\u2019t even a matter of choosing a side, as you might end up offending both with your actions.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a matter of abandoning one side and switching over to another. One might end up losing both of their favor.Harriet\u2019s face had gone completely pale as she heard my words. No matter how strong her sense of superiority and nobility was, she tended to cower before those of higher rank than her.\u201cS, so\u2026. So, what should I do? Isn\u2019t this really bad?\u201d\u2026\u2026No, why was she like this?\u201c\u2026Hey, you idiot. I\u2019m telling you to persuade your father with these words. Why are you the one getting persuaded here?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Huh?\u201dHarriet was so surprised by this that she couldn\u2019t even respond properly to me.If we really stretched it like this, it would certainly seem like a pretty serious problem, but in reality it most likely wasn\u2019t one. That was why I tried to tell her to use this reason that they might offend certain people in these sensitive times by making her take a leave of absence, which would cause a lot of problems.However, this girl thought this was a real situation happening right now, so she was shaking in her boots.\u201cDo you seriously think they\u2019d get that offended if you just took a leave of absence?\u201dIt was true that the family of the Grand Duke Saint-Owan were very powerful. They were a family that wouldn\u2019t even flinch by something like that, even if they might offend someone a little.In other words, the only ones who were of a comparable rank, except the Prince and Princess, were A-3 Liana de Grantz, the daughter of Duke Grantz, and A-6 Heinrich, who was part of Kernstadt\u2019s royalty.\u201cIt\u2019s just something I fabricated. In reality, there\u2019s a high chance that they wouldn\u2019t care, but it\u2019s important for your father to take this seriously. So let\u2019s just put it this way. If it was really that dangerous in Temple, why were they still staying there? So this would actually mean it\u2019s safe. Also tell your father that you won\u2019t bend.\u201d\u201cO, ooh\u2026.\u201dHarriet nodded her head, showing her understanding. I wasn\u2019t sure if this would work or not, but it was worth trying at least.\u201cNow, there are two reasons. The first is that the current situation was quite sensitive, so taking a leave of absence might make a very bad impression on the Prince and Princess. The second\u00a0is that they both continue to attend Temple because they are confident that it was safe there, and even if it wasn\u2019t before, right now Temple\u2019s security is even higher than before, so it should be even safer than before as well. Put it like that.\u201d\u201cAh, ye\u2026. yes.\u201dHarriet nodded at my stormy words. Well, I really couldn\u2019t vouch for its success, but it was better than nothing. I mean, Harriet kind of reached out to me, so if she had a better idea later on she could just use that as well.It would have been even better if it was Bertus who told her not to take a leave of absence.If Bertus requested her not to take one, the effect of my reasoning would have been maximized. Wouldn\u2019t it be even better if he put it a bit more round about, as well? It would be sufficient if he just expressed that desire indirectly.That way, the listener could interpret the message however they wanted. Even if Bertus only told her that because he didn\u2019t want his classmate to repeat a year.Should I ask Bertus to say something to Harriet pertaining to the leave of absence story?This would make things clear, but I was extremely reluctant to owe him something. I thought I should push that thought back for now.Anyway, after having listened to everything I had to say, Harriet was staring at me blankly.\u201cWha\u2026. What\u2019s with you?\u201dIf one were to carefully listen to this, one would realize that it was a lie, maybe that was why she was looking at me like that. However, it could also be that she was surprised that I actually came up with something like that.\u201cIn the end, something will come out after squeezing hard enough.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHerriet\u2019s expression grew even weirder, as if she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. After that, Harriet and I continued to talk about the specifics.\u201cNo, you can just say whatever comes to mind\u2026. Well, we could also write a script if you want, you know?.\u201d\u201cI would get nervous and forget all the lines!\u201d\u201cFricking Hell. Are you really a magic major student?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot!\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t even call you an idiot just now, you know? Are you really some kind of idiot, though?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t say it right now, but you did before! You idiot!\u201dAs such, we kept on bickering and talking in the dining hall. Before I noticed it, night had already fallen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh. You\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAnd that was when Ellen Artorius appeared, like always.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79She was staring intently at us while we were scrambling to come up with solutions. Tonight, I wasn\u2019t able to take even a single step into the training room, because I was brainstorming with this girl the whole time. Ellen was wearing her towel, which she always took with her after she ended her training, over her shoulder.Harriet looked at her and stiffened slightly.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dEllen didn\u2019t talk to anyone but me. Although Harriet was openly dismissive of commoners, the atmosphere around Ellen was slightly different even though she was a commoner as well.Even if she pretended to be otherwise, she was still the type that was hard to deal with. In fact, just by looking at the power datasheet posted on our class bulletin board, one could see that Ellen had physical abilities incomparable to those of her classmates.She was special.Everyone recognized her as such.So Harriet seemed to freeze up when she looked at Ellen, although for different reasons than when she was in front of Bertus.Harriet was weak in front of the strong.She despised people who she could afford to despise, but she had difficulties with those who had more power than her, making her turn completely shy.In the original, I didn\u2019t really set her up as such a character, but as I was constantly around her, I could observe that aspect of her very clearly.Anyway, it seemed that it was now time for Ellen to come here to eat her late night snack. Come to think of it, I got so used to eating at this time that I got hungry even if I didn\u2019t train at all.\u201cHey, what do you wanna eat?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026. Eating?\u201d\u201cNo, well, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dHarriet seemed confused when I suddenly posed such a question. Ellen was still standing there, so I beckoned her to sit down next to me.It was always just the two of us, so it was a first that we had a third person eating with us.\u201cWait.\u201dBefore I knew it, Ellen had gotten quite used to eating the things I made. She also made something from time to time, but in terms of ratio it would be four to one. For every four times I could, she would do it once.I glanced at Harriet and Ellen sitting across from each other.Ellen just sat there blankly with her chin propped up on her palm, not thinking about a thing, but Harriet\u2019s face was slightly red again, perhaps because of this extreme awkwardness.It sure was a funny sight.*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *I made some simple chop steaks. Usually I only made simple things for late night snacks. I was almost always completely exhausted, so I couldn\u2019t really afford to make anything complicated.Because the meat was of such a high quality, one could honestly just grill it with a bit of salt and it would be good to go. I tended to make some side dishes as well.However, I didn\u2019t train today, so I had plenty of stamina left, as such I decided to put some work into this. Of course, it still wouldn\u2019t be anything difficult to make, though.\u201cAh, if someone\u2019s cooking for you, doesn\u2019t politeness dictate that one should set the table?\u201d\u201cH, huh?\u201dHarriet suddenly showed me a bewildered expression. Ellen, however, got up as if she was already familiar with this, took out the utensils and dishes, and placed them one by one on the table. Harriet looked even more bewildered when she saw Ellen listening to me obediently.She was just staring at this scene of Ellen moving about as if she was familiar with this motion, as if she didn\u2019t understand what was going on.And also\u2026\u201cWhy\u2026. Why are there so many?\u201dLooking at that plate filled with an enormous amount of Chop steaks, Harriet had her mouth slightly open.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see what happens next.\u201dWatching Ellen take the food, I wondered what kind of expression Harriet would make next.Munch, munch, munchEllen was eating at an abnormal speed right from the start. Harriet, wearing a surprised expression, stabbed a chop steak with her fork, a mystified look in her eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026You knew how to cook?\u201d\u201cRather than calling it cooking, it\u2019s just enough to make stuff edible. Don\u2019t look down on life on the streets.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look very delicious, but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t edible at all. Compared to the food her professional chefs made, this is probably far below in quality.However, she seemed surprised that I made something that was actually edible.\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself to eat it.\u201dThat was what I told her while I stabbed my fork into the chop steaks in front of me. She didn\u2019t have to force herself to eat this stuff, because we had a certain someone sitting right across from her that would absorb anything that was left. Harriet ate slowly while playing with her fork.To be honest, I imagined her spitting it out after eating a bit of it, saying it was tasteless. In fact, she probably only ever ate high-quality food.However, even though she was only eating at a slow pace, she was still eating quite well.* * *\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dHarriet couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut when she saw that the pan was already completely empty. Ellen ate everything like nothing, and only took a sip of water with a calm expression on her face.Yeah, although I saw this phenomenon all the time, it even surprised me all the time. Sometimes I felt like punching her for being so shameless to eat almost everything by herself and then looking like she ate nothing at all.It felt like she\u2019d act all \u2018coy\u2019 after eating everything on her own like a pig.After eating, Ellen put all the utensils in the pan and started clearing and cleaning the table. If I made the food, she\u2019d clean up, and when she made the food, I\u2019d clean up.Harriet was staring blankly at Ellen\u2019s practiced behavior.\u201c\u2026\u2026You seem to be very close. Do you eat like this every night?\u201dHarriet asked with her voice lowered.\u201cYeah. We\u2019d usually have a meal around this time after I got beaten up enough.\u201d\u201cWhat? You get beaten?\u201dHarriet had a startled expression plastered on her face when she heard me talk about fighting. Well, she had no reason to visit the training room, so she wouldn\u2019t have any idea what was going on in there every day.She probably thought I wasn\u2019t the type to be beaten up even if someone were to hit me, but now she heard that I got beat up by Ellen every day. Her eyes oozed disbelief.Well, she wasn\u2019t in the changing room, so she didn\u2019t see.I smiled slightly and lifted my shirt, revealing my bruised abdomen and flanks.\u201cWha, what are you doing\u2026.! Y, you, what happened? What\u2019s wrong with your body?\u201dWhen I suddenly lifted my shirt, she was slightly startled and freaked out, but when she saw my bare skin full of bruises, her complexion immediately blanched.\u201cMy pseudo-swordsmanship is so terrible, that I\u2019m always in her care.\u201d\u201cP, pseudo-swordsmanship?\u201dYes, pseudo-swordsmanship.It still hasn\u2019t evolved yet!\u201cAnd, hey.\u201dI looked at Harriet, who was staring at my wounds in a daze, and called out to her.\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cYa know? If someone cooks for you, you should at least clean up the table. Don\u2019t you think you have to get a move on if you take the hint?\u201dYou have to follow the rules of the restaurant as well.\u201cWhat are you doing? Haven\u2019t you started making some coffee or tea yet?\u201d\u201cWha, what\u201dWhen I ordered the great princess to make some coffee, she looked absolutely shocked.* * *\u201cW, why\u2026. Why do I have to do this\u2026?\u201dHarriet brought a can of black tea to the table, even while her face was blushing hot red as if her pride got damaged. Even though she grumbled and asked why she had to do something like that, followed by my reply that she had to do something at least. However, she never threw a complete tantrum or said that she would absolutely never do it.Well, it was probably her attendants who did these things for her back at home.However, this was Temple. Although there were some personnel, they weren\u2019t present around this time.\u201cWha, what the hell is this\u2026?\u201dHer expression, contorted by contempt while pouring tea into Ellen\u2019s and my teacup, was excellent.She was probably thinking something like: \u201cWhy, why me? Why do I have to be treated like that? This just doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201dAll of that could be easily read from that expression of hers, still, she obediently did what was asked of her.So cute.You\u2019re really the best, idiot.\u201cJeez, did you ever try Bertus\u2019 tea before?\u201dActually, Bertus treated me to black tea earlier today. In fact, every time we talked on that terrace, he tended to brew me some tea.Of course, he didn\u2019t do that out of respect for me, but because he knew that I was a complete stranger to tea and all that in the first place, so he\u2019d rather do it himself than let me do this.If it were me who brewed the tea, he wouldn\u2019t even touch it.\u201cBertus\u2026? Brewed you tea?\u201dHowever, it seemed like Harriet was only astonished to hear that Bertus brewed tea for someone like me.\u201cSo if we were to compare your tea with his, it wouldn\u2019t even deserve to be on the same table.\u201c\u201cH, huh! Hah! Wha, what\u2026. What\u2026.\u201dMe bragging about this, even though it was the Prince who brewed the tea, managed to make Harriet\u2019s face red again.We usually didn\u2019t have something like a tea time after our late night snack, but I still made Harriet brew some tea just to make her do something. I mean, ingesting caffeine before going to bed wasn\u2019t good after all.Ellen began to dismiss that tea and focused on the cookies she took out.\u201cAre you only drinking tea right now so that you can eat these cookies?\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAs if to emphasize her answer, Ellen kept on shoving cookies into her mouth. Harriet was staring blankly at that scene, seemingly exhausted. I quietly nodded after noticing her gaze that seemed to ask if Ellen was always like that.\u201c\u2026If you eat that much,\u2026. won\u2019t you get fat?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dHarriet looked at me blankly.I felt like I had a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Redina asked something similar recently. Did they share the same brain cell? They even had the same expression.I didn\u2019t explain this time, because I was too tired to even start.Ellen left some cookies for me and Harriet to eat and then quietly drank her tea. Thanks to having told her not to cross the line myriads of times, she didn\u2019t eat everything on her own.Harriet seemed restless. Well, even though she despised me for being a beggar, she seemed to have difficulties, being in Ellen\u2019s presence, even though she was a commoner. I mean, the atmosphere around Ellen did kind of make it hard to approach her. Harriet seemed especially unfamiliar with her silence.Even when she was with me, she didn\u2019t talk all that much.\u201cHow did you two\u2026. become friends?\u201dNo matter how one looked at it, there seemed to be no reason for Ellen to befriend the mad dog Reinhardt. Ellen looked between me and Harriet alternately, sipping her tea, before she put down her cup.She looked at me limpidly.It felt like she was debating whether she should say it or not. What the hell was she trying to say\u2026.No way.\u201cAt first, he gave me a letter\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say it!\u201dWhy did she start from there!When I suddenly jumped up like that, Ellen closed her mouth and Harriet stared at me.No, well, I thought she forgot about it, because she never mentioned that incident again, but she actually didn\u2019t! Of course, it was only natural for one to remember something like that, but I thought she didn\u2019t give it any meaning, so why?Of course, it was usually something quite meaningful, but that wasn\u2019t the point right now.\u201cTha, that\u2019s right. W, we take swordsmanship classes together, and because of that duel the other day, erm, I asked her to help me with my training, so she did. Yeah, that\u2019s how it went!\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dEllen nodded her head quietly at my fierce stare, asking her to agree. I mean, it wasn\u2019t wrong after all.Perhaps because I was just too flustered, what came out of my mouth was this stuttered explanation. Harriet just nodded her head, seeming slightly surprised by my fussy explanation. After I was done, I felt a sudden embarrassment come over me for moving so abruptly like that.\u201cA, anyway. L, let\u2019s talk tomorrow. Make sure to tell me how it went. Got it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know why I should do that, but fine.\u201dAfter saying that, Harriet told us that she was tired and got up from her seat, returning to her dormitory room. It was almost past curfew.\u201cHey\u2026. What were you going to say\u2026?\u201dEllen tilted her head at my whining.\u201cThat you wrote to me, you fell in love at first sight with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry. Please spare me.\u201dEllen held the attitude of someone not involved in this matter. What she said was obviously true though.I wrote a love letter to a classmate and then got dumped.There were 200 Points on the line at that time. If I had known that I would receive over 6000 points later on, I wouldn\u2019t have done this!I was blinded by the allure of 200 Points!\u201cWas it a lie?\u201dAt the sound of Ellen\u2019s subdued voice, I looked straight at her.It was a lie. I was sure that she wouldn\u2019t spread any rumors about this, even if she ended up rejecting me.Ellen didn\u2019t say anything other than her refusal at the time. However, now she admitted that this was how we got to know each other and asked me if my confession was a lie.If I tell her the truth, would she be hurt?Wouldn\u2019t it be even weirder for me to lie about this kind of stuff?\u201c\u2026\u2026Ehm.\u201dIn the end, I had no other choice but to tell her that I lied to her in exchange for 200 Points.Ellen took a sip from her tea again, then nodded.\u201cI thought so.\u201dEllen was already aware that I was lying the moment I gave her that letter.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI had no excuses to tell or grounds to give a rational explanation.I could only apologize.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAfter she said that, Ellen just continued to quietly drink her tea.She didn\u2019t even ask me why I lied to her like that.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80The next morning.I went down to the lobby to prepare for my morning workout as usual.\u201cHey, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Hello.\u201dThe usual members of the early morning exercise squad began to appear one after the other. They were all part of the high school section, but I didn\u2019t know most of them. The seniors that I got to know because of that duel greeted me warmly.\u2026\u2026What might this be? This uncomfortable yet pleasant feeling.Among the first years there were three members of the early morning exercise squad: Me, Ludwig, and Ellen. The ones that only appear occasionally were Bertus, Cliffman and Scarlett.Ellen went ahead first while I was waiting for Adriana. We didn\u2019t make any plans, but I was sure that she would show up.\u201cHeya, Reinhardt. Out early again today?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dLudwig, who was in sportswear, greeted me brightly, to which I nodded.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dIn addition to him, two other people in sportswear were walking out of the first year dormitory.\u201cIf you feel tired, you have to rest. Don\u2019t overdo it.\u201dB-3, Scarlett.\u201cYes, yes. I got it. And talk comfortably to me. We\u2019re in the same grade.\u201dAnd Number B-1 Charlotte de Gardias.\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026. I can\u2019t help it. It became a habit\u2026.\u201d\u201cFufu. You\u2019ll get used to it bit by bit.\u201dThe two of them came out to do their morning workout together.\u201cIf I\u2019m disturbing you, you can just leave me behind. I don\u2019t want to force myself on you. Your training is more important after all, right?\u201d\u201cNo, no. You still have to look after your health\u2026. I\u2019ll just watch.\u201dYesterday, when Charlotte saw Scarlett getting bullied by Erich, she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I had no idea what happened in the dorms after that, but Charlotte seemed to have decided to work out with Scarlett in the morning.It seemed like Charlotte made it clear that she wanted to make Scarlett her own.The two of them made eye contact with me, as I was standing around in the lobby.\u201cErm, Hello? Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Hello.\u201dCharlotte smiled slightly at me as she greeted me. Since she came to know that my power would help her find Valier, she wasn\u2019t so harsh on me anymore.She was slightly different from Bertus in that sense. Scarlett just looked at me and slightly bowed her head towards me. We weren\u2019t really close, but it seemed like she held a certain sense of unity towards me. In the end, she didn\u2019t move according to my advice, but Scarlett\u2019s suffering would come to an end now that she is under Charlotte\u2019s protection.All her problems would be solved, albeit in a different way.The kidnapping of Delphine Izadra never happened, and Scarlett\u2019s bullying was taken care of by Charlotte.\u2026\u2026It felt like Ludwig\u2019s existence was becoming more and more redundant.The one who was supposed to be the main character was gradually become just the guy in the last place of Class B! Nothing more nor less!Was it really fine for the main character\u2019s influence to become less and less?However, wasn\u2019t it kind of prejudiced that the main character had to hog the attention of all the other characters around him?Was this really so bad? Wouldn\u2019t his future destination still be the same, even if he took a different way? Ludwig was a crazy hard worker, so he would thrive in any kind of environment. He\u2019d end up overpowered no matter what happened.In the midst of my contemplation whether the story was heading towards a really strange direction or whether it was still okay\u2026.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, junior. I kept you waiting.\u201dThe always calm and kind church sister was walking down the stairs.* * *Adriana praised me for my increase in stamina while we were working out together after a while.\u201cYou worked hard, junior. It isn\u2019t that big a change, but your stamina has certainly increased.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s keep it up.\u201dIn the week Adriana was gone, it was clear that my physical abilities had improved a little. I definitely felt less tired than before.\u201cSo shall we pick up the pace a bit then?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dOf course, I was still far below Adriana\u2019s standard.\u201cPant\u2026.Huff\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dIt was good and all that my stamina increased, but Adriana increased the difficulty just as much as I improved, so I was exhausted again.So what would happen when I improved even more? That monster would work me until I was completely drained, no matter what. My future still seemed bleak.\u201cStill, you did great for being able to follow me up to this point.\u201dAfter running a lap, doing some muscle training and some aerobic exercises, Adriana and I sat down on a bench to rest.\u201cBy the way, I heard that Demons attacked the Knights Templar.\u201dEven though Adriana had\u00a0just returned from the monastery located in the Saint-Owan Grand Duchy, she, of course, heard about this piece of news.\u201cThat\u2019s what they said.\u201dI could see slight anger in Adriana\u2019s calm eyes.\u201cThese demons have not yet been exterminated.\u201dThis sentence was loaded with her will to participate in the hunt immediately. Even Adriana, who was always gentle, hated the demons with all her being. I was kind of curious about what kind of expression she would make if she ever found out that I was actually a Demon Prince. Would she look at me superficially, or would she take my inner self into consideration?It would probably be hard for her to see me as someone on the good side, though.\u201cThey say there were no fatalities.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m honestly glad about that. They were surely under God\u2019s protection.\u201dSure, God\u2019s protection. It was me who took care that no one would end up dying. Of course, I managed to do that using the Revise Function, but it was still fortunate that none of the Knights Templar ended up dying.Well, I was kind of this world\u2019s God of Creation, so me using the Revise Function to ensure no one died could be called God\u2019s protection, right?What? So she was wrong, but actually right.\u201cThere might be a second Demon World War happening soon.\u201dThat was what Sarkegaar hoped for, but it wasn\u2019t something I wanted to happen. Come to think of it, Adriana seemed to have longed to join the Knights Templar.\u201cAre you going to join the Knights Templar?\u201dAdriana was already able to use her divine power very well. She was even using them right now. With that level of talent, the Knights Templar would probably let her join with no questions asked.Adriana nodded to answer my question.\u201cOriginally, I was planning on attending Graduate School, but now I want to go join them as soon as I graduate from Royal Class.\u201dAdriana originally wanted to go to Graduate School. However, because of this incident, she seemed to want to join the Knights Templar immediately after she finished her 6 years in Royal Class. Because Demons ran rampant inside the Imperial Capital, Adriana decided to change her course of action.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, junior?\u201dAdriana looked at me, wondering if there was something wrong.From what I had seen before, the Knights Templar seemed to be a corrupt organization. The reason why they took the succubi from that black market was because they had similar intentions. If that were to be discovered, they\u2019d just say they took them for research purposes or something. They would just give some reasonable excuses to appease the masses.It wasn\u2019t known to me from where that corruption originated from or how obvious it was, but the Knights Templar were already one of the most powerful armed forces, so it was pretty hard to simply believe that they were completely innocent.I can\u2019t deny that I was a little worried about Adriana joining a group like that. If Adriana were to join that place, would she get disillusioned and leave the group? Or would she become an equally corrupt Paladin?\u201cNo. It\u2019s just\u2026.\u201dAdriana\u2019s eyes were so pure.I had no right to tell Adriana to not join the Knights Templar. In fact, this was still quite far off in the future at the moment.Anyway.It felt really strange seeing the incident I caused making such big waves everywhere around me. For me, this was just a simple incident I caused to rescue some demons.However, it ended up becoming a reason for the unity of the Empire to become stronger.For some it was the reason to take a leave of absence from Temple.For others it became the reason to quickly join the military.Witnessing with my own eyes how a single event triggered hundreds and thousands of connected events, it honestly felt unreal. I knew that everything in the world was somehow connected, but because this connection was now pushed right in front of my eyes, I was experiencing this new feeling.It wasn\u2019t in the least predictable what my actions would cause.-Shall we take a rest?-Haah\u2026. Haah\u2026. No\u2026. W, we can still do some more.-I think you should rest for a bit, Charlotte.-No\u2026. No\u2026. I\u2019m fine\u2026.I could see Scarlett and Charlotte running in the distance. Anyone could see that her stamina was already exhausted, but it seemed like Charlotte was trying to continue with her teeth clenched.In a way, this scene wasn\u2019t that much different from my training. The silent pressure Charlotte put on Erich stopped his bullying behavior. That was probably also why Charlotte was talking with Scarlett like that.Everything in this world had a cause and effect.But it was giving me a serious headache, thinking about how a single cause would lead to hundreds of events, and those events would lead to hundreds of different effects.There just had been too many consequences for my actions. Hundreds of thousands of them.If that were the case, causal reasoning would become completely meaningless. Because these vast amounts of causal effects could only be called chaos.In the end, there was only one conclusion.\u201cThe Princess sure is enthusiastic.\u201d\u201cI know, right?\u201dI couldn\u2019t smooth out all the consequences my actions brought.* * *In Harriet\u2019s case, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how her situation would conclude. There was also Liana de Grantz left. If she were to decide to take a leave of absence, I wouldn\u2019t know how to stop her from doing that. We didn\u2019t even exchange a single word yet. In Harriet\u2019s case, we had this bad relationship connecting us. Even a bad relationship was still a kind of relationship after all. So I could talk things over with her\u2026.The solution to that problem came from a rather strange place.After breakfast, I could see Bertus having a conversation with Liana de Grantz.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cAs I was saying. I believe it would be better to avoid taking a leave of absence if possible.\u201dLiana tilted her head at Bertus\u2019 straight words.\u201cI\u2019m not forcing you. It is your choice, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to stay together in the same class than changing our relationship into a vague one like senior and junior after already having paid tuition for this year?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dBertus was speaking very kindly. He wasn\u2019t forcing her, he was just telling her that he would feel sad if the class fell apart. However, the intention behind that smile of his was very obvious.\u2018If you quit the class, prepare yourself for the consequences.\u2019That was what he actually meant. Liana slightly nodded her head with a firm expression, not clear if she understood his intentions or not.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll let them know.\u201dAfter all, a Prince was still a Prince.In fact, a request from Bertus was no different from an order. Rather, it was even more compelling because he worded it as just a request.\u2018Look, I\u2019m honoring you so much, I\u2019m even asking you favors.\u2019That was how this was to be understood.What?Obviously, Bertus was the best choice if I wanted to dissuade them from taking a leave of absence. Actually, asking him to persuade the children to not take a leave of absence was my ace in the hole, even if I would be in Bertus\u2019 debt.However, even though I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, Bertus was dissuading them of his own accord.* * *It was only natural.\u201cWha, what should I do!\u201dHarriet came to me with her face completely pale.Tuesday was the day I had the lectures I personally signed up for, so I wouldn\u2019t really run into Harriet. She dragged me to the front door of the Royal Class dorm when I was on my way to my morning lectures.I could guess why she was doing this.\u201cWhat? Did Bertus tell you not to take a leave of absence?\u201d\u201cH, how did you know?\u201d\u201cI saw him telling that to de Grantz earlier.\u201dHe told Liana de Grantz, so, of course, he would also tell Harriet the same thing. That was why she got very confused and immediately came to find me and ask me what to do in that situation.\u201cWhat do I do? I don\u2019t want to get on his bad side.\u201dHarriet was in tears, thinking that she would end up dying if she went against the Prince\u2019s wishes. She didn\u2019t know how he was on the inside, only his facade, but if what he said was enough to make her come whine to me, he seemed to let a bit of his intentions slip.\u201cWhat do you mean, what should you do? This is a good thing.\u201d\u201cA good thing\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, wasn\u2019t that what we planned your excuse to be. Now it actually became true. It would be easier for you to convince your parents now, so how is this something difficult to deal with?\u201dHer primary excuse was that Bertus didn\u2019t want her to take a leave of absence, so she shouldn\u2019t, to save the Prince\u2019s face. However, Bertus actually told her just that. So this would make it the truth and not an excuse.Rather, Bertus prepared the best stage one could hope for. I couldn\u2019t thank him enough, but here she was trembling like a newborn calf because she thought she really annoyed Bertus.\u201cBut still\u2026. Even if I convince them that I shouldn\u2019t take a leave of absence\u2026. Doesn\u2019t Bertus hate me now?\u201dOf course, the chances that she wouldn\u2019t get forced to take a leave of absence rose pretty steeply, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that she tried to take one, so she wasn\u2019t exactly erased from Bertus\u2019 black list. Rather, he might have some plans for the future.\u201cIdiot. Can you hear me? I think it would be more rude to just write him off like that.\u201d\u201cHuh? Wha, what\u2026.what?\u201dI found out one more characteristic that that girl had. If she was in a state of heightened stress or fear, she wouldn\u2019t even retort when I called her an idiot. She had already accepted Idiot as a word that was used to address her. That acceptance even reached her subconscious.\u201cMaybe he just told you that with completely pure intentions. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want our class to get split like that, you know?\u201d\u201cI, I see\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe fact that you think Bertus is being stubborn or annoyed by you already means that you treat him like some kind of jerk.\u201dWorrying like this, if the Prince got annoyed or angry, was the same as thinking that the Prince was a total jerk to begin with. That was the moment Harriet realized what she was doing, her face turning even paler than usual.\u201cN, No! It\u2019s not like that! I\u2026. I didn\u2019t think that at all.\u201d\u201cThen just relax. Because that guy\u2019s much more broadminded than you think.\u201dHe was so broadminded, in fact, that he didn\u2019t give a damn if nobles, commoners or beggars spoke informally to him, because to him, they were all the same.Harriet\u2019s eyes widened as I spoke about Bertus as if I knew him very well. She seemed to ask me with her eyes how I knew these things.\u201cTha, that\u2019s right\u2026. You said he brewed you some tea as well\u2026.\u201dShe might have thought something like \u2018Are you telling me that you two are close enough to drink tea together?\u2019\u00a0or\u00a0\u2018Bertus is so generous to brew a lowly beggar like him some tea?\u2019I\u2019d put my money on the latter, knowing this punk.Harriet\u2019s face, that had been very pale up until now, seemed to return to its usual color, her expression seeming more reassured.\u201cWhat a relief\u2026. A, anyway, tha, tha\u2026. thanks\u2026.\u201dNo, no matter how relieved she felt, she even managed to thank me? Of course, it wasn\u2019t something easy for her to do, so her face seemed a little red again.That girl began to stumble as if she lost the strength in her legs and walked towards the tram stop.\u201cWhere are you going? I have to ride the next one as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201dIt was quite the cringy situation, having to take the same bus as a friend one just said goodbye to.\u201cWhat exactly were you thankful for? Tell me in detail.\u201dAs I spoke, her face turned cherry red again.\u201cGo away! I\u2019ll just walk!\u201dHarriet huffed and distanced herself from the station.Then she began to realize that she would have to go quite far, so she returned with an even redder face.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81On Tuesdays, I had swordsmanship classes with Ellen and learned horseback riding in the afternoon. Perhaps my pseudo-swordsmanship skill was still a type of swordsmanship, my dedicated swordsmanship teacher praised me, saying that my skills seemed to have improved quite a bit.\u201cYou seem to practice a lot, right?\u201d\u201cThis is much better than before.\u201dThe teaching assistants told me that they could see that I had been working hard even while there weren\u2019t any lectures, so they complimented me quite a lot.On the other hand.-Hmm\u2026. I don\u2019t think this is enough yet, Ellen.-Yes.-Let\u2019s try a little more. It was a little disappointing, you know? You need to lower your center of gravity.-Yes.Ellen was directly learning from the swordsmanship teacher not one of the assistants, but she was getting scolded a lot more, rather than receiving praise. Actually, it was Ellen who received the most criticism here.That was only natural.I started from 0 after all. So even a little bit of progress got praised excessively.However, Ellen\u2019s starting point was at 100. She did extremely well to begin with, meaning no real improvement, so there was nothing to really praise. These were classes, not some sort of competition, and the teachers, no matter how perfect a student was, had to somehow teach them something.So, Ellen, who had swordsmanship skills incomparable to her other classmates, got subjected to incredibly high standards.It\u2019s like someone who previously got 0 points for a test getting 10 points, so they get praised. On the other hand, someone who had 90 points on their test and would continue to just get 90 points. They would be questioned why they didn\u2019t improve even a bit.That was the advantage of being a trash character.What would have happened if I entered into that sword genius, Ellen\u2019s body?-It\u2019s still not enough. Your sense of distance between the swords is still lacking.They probably would have questioned why this gifted kid suddenly became so sloppy.\u201cHup!\u201d\u201cOkay, Reinhardt! Let\u2019s do that one more time! You\u2019re doing great!\u201dI was actually pretty fortunate that I entered that incompetent Valier\u2019s body.However.\u201cReinhardt? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAh, no. I just got a little discouraged\u2026.\u201dI got slightly disappointed in myself for thinking that I was lucky for having entered such a loafer\u2019s body.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *As always, I had lunch with Ellen after our lessons, then I went to my horseback riding class. Harriet probably hadn\u2019t talked with the Grand Duke yet. I wondered how things would go.In Liana\u2019s case, Bertus talked to her, but I didn\u2019t actually know how things would go on her end. Anyway, it would be nice if none of the children took a leave of absence based on Bertus\u2019 sudden action.With these thoughts occupying my mind, I returned to the dormitory. Arriving there, I found someone quite unexpected waiting for me.\u201cAh, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Charlotte?\u201d\u201cDo you have some time?\u201dIt was Charlotte who was waiting for me there.She then made quite a weird request of me, without an inkling of hesitation.\u201cHow about we go outside for a bit?\u201d\u201cHuh. Will that be alright?\u201dShe only asked me to go outside with her. No, but at this time?\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to go out yet, though\u2026. The ban hasn\u2019t been lifted yet, right?\u201dThe investigation into that demonic terrorist incident shouldn\u2019t have been completed yet. So the ban on Temple Students shouldn\u2019t have been lifted yet, either. Hearing my words, Charlotte looked slightly sullen.\u201cThere are some exceptions.\u201dI couldn\u2019t refute that the Prince and Princess were pretty much treated like a special existence even in Temple.\u201cBut without any escorts? Is that really okay?\u201d\u201cIt should be fine.\u201dIt seemed clear that Charlotte was just trying to leave Temple with me alone.What? Is that what one called denseness? Charlotte covered her mouth and laughed, seeing the look on my face.\u201cAt the moment, there are only three people inside the Empire who are probably the safest at the moment.\u201dCharlotte pointed a finger somewhere. She roughly pointed in the direction of the Imperial Palace.\u201cI\u2019m sure, you know who one of them is.\u201dThen she pointed towards the dormitory.\u201cThen there\u2019s Bertus.\u201dAfter that, she pointed at herself.\u201cAnd me.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what the basis for this theory was, but she seemed convinced that she wouldn\u2019t be harmed in the least.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Charlotte would only be with me, but she wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous.No one was allowed to go outside at the moment, Charlotte, on the other hand, was able to go out and even take me with her just by talking to the people positioned at the entrance of Temple. They didn\u2019t even ask why we wanted to go out.Classes ended at 3 pm, so there was still a long time until the sun set. Charlotte slipped over a robe that seemed to have been prepared in advance. Charlotte\u2019s face was much more well known than Bertus\u2019 at the moment.As I kept feeling anxious, Charlotte just faintly smiled at me from inside her robe.\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to worry. No matter what might happen, there are defensive measures in place.\u201dCharlotte walked ahead as if she had no worries at all.\u201cBut where are we going?\u201d\u201cThe Aligar district\u2019s shopping street.\u201dThat was the moment I realized why she wanted to go out today.The wanted to go to the place Valier was last seen. Charlotte planned on investigating herself.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Charlotte in her robe and me wearing my casual clothes boarded a mana train.\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just use Warp Gates?\u201dOf course, there were only a few people who actually used warp gates to travel between districts.The Warp Gates weren\u2019t something one could use for free usually, but if it was the Imperial Princess, I was pretty sure that we would get a free pass.While we were shaken around by the train, Charlotte froze at my words.\u201cSince the incident last time, the Warp Gate management procedures have been strengthened a lot more. I don\u2019t want to leave a record.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThe demon prisoners escaped via the Warp Gates. Although that fact wasn\u2019t known by the public, because of that, the forces guarding the Warp Gates increased and the security checks done on the Warp Gate\u2019s users seemed to have gotten considerably stricter.I should also have been among the ones not in the know why the security measures around the Warp Gates had been strengthened.\u201cWhat do the Warp Gates have to do with that incident?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. I\u2019ll tell you when we get off.\u201dCharlotte gestured to me to wait. She probably didn\u2019t want to talk about these things in such a crowded area.We went out like that because we wanted to visit that place with just the two of us, but wasn\u2019t there a possibility that Bertus or one of his subordinates was following us? Could we be sure that we didn\u2019t have a tail on us? Or did Charlotte not care about that?She might be one of the people safest in the Empire, but I wasn\u2019t, you know? Bertus was already treating me like someone firmly attached to him, or at least he had his eyes pretty strongly focused on me. So what excuse should I give him, if he caught me doing this?Anyway.I was riding a mana train with the Princess who suddenly asked me out.This sure was a unique experience one wouldn\u2019t encounter every day.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *We got off at the Aligar District station and headed towards the shopping street.\u201cThe suspects who caused that incident escaped via the Warp Gates. That\u2019s why.\u201dCharlotte didn\u2019t tell me about the demon prisoners black market trade.\u201cDidn\u2019t they follow them through the Gate?\u201d\u201cThey were cautious. They activated the Gate by force, went through it, and destroyed the Warp Gate on the other side after they came out.\u201dIt was quite arduous to ask her questions like someone who had no idea about this incident as someone who knew all about it. Charlotte calmly told me what she could.\u201cAnyway, why are you taking me to the Aligar District shopping street. Can\u2019t you see that I feel like I\u2019m walking on an extremely narrow tightrope right now?\u201dIf I got stuck between Bertus and Charlotte like that, I\u2019d lose a lot of my freedom of movement. Rather than having to escape because my true identity got discovered, I might actually have to escape because those two got wind that I\u2019m a sort of double agent.Bertus should already know that Charlotte and I have a certain connection. He just didn\u2019t tell me yet that he knew. The same should go for Charlotte.\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about.\u201dStill, it was true that I leaned more towards Charlotte because of the guilt I felt towards her, so I could speak more frankly to Charlotte than to Bertus.\u201cI need you for my own reasons, I don\u2019t know about Bertus, but in the end, it should be the same for him. Right?\u201dCharlotte probably saw me or even heard me speak to Bertus herself.\u201cI don\u2019t really know what Bertus is thinking, but it\u2019s not a bad relationship we\u2019re having.\u201d\u201cAs long as you are in Temple\u2019s Royal Class, Bertus won\u2019t do anything to you. You can relax. Strictly speaking, the one you should be careful of would be me, but you know I need you.\u201dCharlotte was a bit different from Bertus in that she spoke to me directly like that.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine as long as I\u2019m in the Royal Class? Why?\u201dJust because we were classmates?\u201cAs you know, Temple gives us exams and corresponding grades, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah?\u201d\u201cAnd you also know that there are not only individual exams, but also group exams. There are also classes and activities that require teamwork, which also count in one\u2019s evaluation, right?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dOf course, I knew.Class A and Class B would compete against each other, and that was pretty much reflected in these grades. Of course, there had to be fields in which the classes could compete directly with each other. That way the main character\u2019s class, the inferior one, would later on have the pleasure of winning over the superior class.Although the rationality behind grading everyone as a group was pretty much non-existent, it was a setting I deliberately put in so that there could be a direct competition between the two classes.\u201cWith that in mind, wouldn\u2019t it be disadvantageous for him to harm his classmates, badger them or treat some more preferentially when there are such group activities, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 guess so.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t on the same level as someone missing from a sports team, but just by having too few people on one\u2019s side would certainly carry a lot of disadvantages.I made a lot of weird group activities for Class A and B\u2019s competition, after all.In other words, if one were to lose, all our grades would drop.\u201cSo, Bertus won\u2019t do anything to me because he doesn\u2019t want his grades to drop?\u201d\u201cYes. So, unless you go too far over the line, he will most likely leave you alone.\u201dBertus was smart, but was he really the type to obsess over grades to such a degree?\u201cThis sounds a bit unconvincing\u2026. Are grades so important to him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if they were in the past, but now they are very important to him.\u201dSaying that, Charlotte turned her eyes to me.Their performance at Temple might not have been that important in the past, but right now it was something incredibly important to both of them. That was why Bertus wouldn\u2019t try to kick me down if I didn\u2019t do anything beyond reason.\u201cDo you remember? The Emperor\u2019s message that we would be deprived of our right to the throne if something were to happen to either of us?\u201d\u201cI remember\u2026.\u201dOn our first day after entering Temple, the Emperor sent a decree to Temple\u2019s Royal Class. It was a message directed to both Charlotte and Bertus, as well as their followers inside the Royal Class, to warn them not to try anything.Clearly, those two would be unable to harm each other until it was fully settled who would succeed the throne.The Emperor knew full well how Bertus tried to kill Charlotte. I didn\u2019t really know what exactly happened, but the Emperor didn\u2019t seem to hold Bertus accountable for this.However, he wanted to prevent future bloodshed between family members.He now created a situation in which both Charlotte and Bertus were now desperately trying to keep each other alive, far from trying to kill each other. The current Emperor held so much power that, even if they got harmed unintentionally, he could make some completely unrelated person the Emperor.That was the situation they were in.\u201cThen, taking this situation into consideration, do you think our evaluation at Temple would matter now, or not?\u201d\u201c!\u201dEven if Temple was the best educational institution on the continent, it was completely absurd to assume that the one who graduated with better grades would become the Emperor. This wasn\u2019t a matter one could decide using their grades.However, even if it wouldn\u2019t be the only factor leading to a decision, it would most certainly still play a big part.Bertus and Charlotte were even in the same grade.So this would be a type of indicator who between those two would be superior.And Temple didn\u2019t only give grades for individual strength as well.In many cases, one had to achieve certain feats through teamwork. Whether it was group tasks or group activities.The grades in Temple were bound to have some impact on the throne succession. There was no doubt that they had a significant, if not absolute, effect on that decision.\u201cMeaning, if even one person was missing, it would be a huge loss.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dIf they were even one person short in a group activity, it would be a great disadvantage. Therefore, Bertus wouldn\u2019t do any direct harm to me. That was what Charlotte was getting at.Only then did I understand why Bertus took the initiative in discouraging the others from taking leaves of absence. If two kids decided to leave we would be down to only 9. Two less than Class B. Appealing, that evaluating the group activities like this was unfair, would be useless as well. Bertus had to somehow outperform Class B.In usual times, his performance at Temple wouldn\u2019t be so important to him, but now it was very important.That being said, it was, of course, just as important to Charlotte.\u201cWas it intentional then? That the two of you got put into Class A and B respectively?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. I can\u2019t say that it wasn\u2019t now, can I?\u201dI still didn\u2019t know what kind of supernatural power Charlotte held, but it was pretty clear that the two of them got put into different Classes and placed as Number 1. Both were in the class leader position. They were ultimately put into such a position to test their leadership skills on their classmates.In the end, what Charlotte wanted to convey was that I didn\u2019t have to fear Bertus too much.And it also made sense that I didn\u2019t have to be afraid of Charlotte as well, because she needed me for her own reasons.Then there was a different matter that bothered me.\u201cBy the way, wasn\u2019t it a bit harsh\u2026. putting you in Class B?\u201dThe Classes were divided by talent. Class B corresponded to the inferior Class. Wasn\u2019t Charlotte dissatisfied with that treatment?Charlotte shrugged her shoulders.\u201cI think this was better for me, though?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. I know what you mean.\u201dThe honor student\u2019s dilemma also applied here.It went without saying that Class A far outperformed Class B.However, if Class B were to surpass Class A even once, then it would seem like Class B created a miracle.Charlotte seemed to think that Class B was currently in a pretty low position but could rise higher. However, although the story won\u2019t play out like in the original, in the story I wrote, Class B would end up outperforming Class A.\u201cAnyway, aren\u2019t you telling me a bit too much. I\u2019m still a member of Class A.\u201d\u201cDo you think? Even Bertus knows this much, though.\u201dCharlotte smiled, as if her telling me this much wouldn\u2019t pose a big problem to her.\u201cOkay. No more chit-chat.\u201dWe arrived at the Aligar District shopping street. A place where many adventurers met their financial end even today.\u201cThe last place the boy I was looking for was seen was in this shopping street.\u201dCharlotte came here to look for traces of Valier.\u201cHuh\u2026. Really?\u201dWith Valier standing right next to her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82There was a reason why Charlotte had to take me with her.\u201cTell me if you feel something.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. I don\u2019t really know if anything like that will happen though.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what kind of miracles my supernatural power could work, so she brought me here on a whim. Maybe I would be able to give her a clue about Valier\u2019s whereabouts if I visit the place he was last seen. That was probably what she was thinking.Charlotte probably already had all the information she could get out of this place.However, there still seemed things she wanted to check out personally, and she thought, if she brought me, things might change, so that led to this situation.\u201cHave you ever seen someone that looks like this?\u201dCharlotte wandered around, carrying Valier\u2019s portrait, and began questioning people. I was pretty sure that she already went around the scroll shops, but Charlotte still went ahead and wandered around the shopping street asking passers-by.Have you seen him? If you have, do you know where he went?Of course, this was still the Aligar District shopping street. A place where you\u2019d earn hatred if you didn\u2019t spend any money.\u201cWhat are you brats doing here? You can\u2019t look around. Scram.\u201dCharlotte was wearing a robe, but she was still very small, so one could see her as anything but a minor. I couldn\u2019t see her as an adventurer either.Neither did the person in front of her. He didn\u2019t even allow us to take a look.How very gangster-like.He let some choice words fly our way, saying stuff about some kids just wandering in willy-nilly without even buying anything. He even asked us if we were crazy.He sure had some fragrant words to offer. So fragrant that he\u2019d immediately bite his tongue off if he knew he was directing them to the First Imperial Princess.In that case, we should have just worn our Temple Uniforms, not our casual clothes. That way they\u2019d think there was big money to earn from us.\u201c\u2026I knew it was going to be tough, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t even want to listen to what I have to say.\u201dAfter walking around the place for quite some time and getting pushed out of store doors, she was obviously tired. Charlotte let out a sigh.\u201c\u2026\u2026I feel like the point you\u2019re focusing on is kind of wrong. Aren\u2019t you supposed to get pissed off by commoners treating you like that?\u201dCharlotte did grumble a bit after she got kicked out and treated the way she was, but she didn\u2019t seem angry. Hearing my words, Charlotte laughed helplessly.\u201cHe swore at me while I was in disguise. Wouldn\u2019t it be really weird if I suddenly said something like \u2018You peasant! Do you know who you are talking to\u2019?\u201dShe was intentionally hiding her identity, so Charlotte seemed fully prepared for what kind of treatment she\u2019d receive when no one was able to recognize her as the Princess. It seemed like what was important for her at the moment wasn\u2019t her honor or pride.When I witnessed Charlotte getting back up on her own feet, I could feel just how desperate she was.\u201cCan you sense anything?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201d\u201cAs I thought\u2026.\u201dAs if she didn\u2019t expect much from this, Charlotte didn\u2019t seem very disappointed.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHowever, she didn\u2019t seem to have any intention to give up just yet.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The only place one could get any information was at the scroll shops. Fortunately, not everyone was slamming their doors in our faces.\u201cJust who is that brat that everyone\u2019s looking for \u2018im? Did that brat cause some incident with those fake scrolls of his?\u201dThe Scroll Store owners who remembered me generally reacted like that. A boy who came to them to sell some fake scrolls, and that group of people who were rushing about looking for him ever since then.They seemed to think that I got involved in some huge crime.\u201cPeople who looked like Guards just came around askin bout \u2018im, and now some kids like you are after \u2018im as well.\u201dThe store owner seemed to find this situation very strange, saying that everyone suddenly started looking for that boy.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you why we are looking for him, but it\u2019s very important. Could you tell me everything you know about him?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 much to it. A few months ago, a young boy came here tryin to sell some scrolls. Although they were very well-made, they were very shoddy. So I thought he was tryin to sell me fake scrolls. In the end I kicked him out. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026. Thank you.\u201d\u201cSigh, that brat must have gotten into some serious trouble. That\u2019s why people should earn their money through honest means. You should be mindful of that as well.\u201dThe shopkeeper came forward and gave Charlotte a warning, then we left the store without saying a word.\u201cSigh\u2026. In the end, they only told me things I already knew. Nothing changed.\u201dEven if one went to investigate and question the same witnesses personally, it was only natural that their testimony wouldn\u2019t be any different from what was written in the reports.\u201cWhat did they mean by fake scrolls?\u201dOf course, I wouldn\u2019t know why Charlotte was wandering around in this place and why Valier even came here with my current presumed level of knowledge. Charlotte looked at me from inside her robe and opened her mouth slightly.\u201cI told you that this boy escaped with me from the Demon King\u2019s Castle, right?\u201d\u201cYou said, he saved your life\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you everything, but this boy had his reasons for separating from me.\u201dBecause of the possible retaliation from Bertus, Valier fled. That\u2019s what Charlotte believed to be the reason. Of course, she didn\u2019t know that I actually ran from her because I was a demon.\u201cBut what can a kid with amnesia and no proper knowledge do? He ran away recklessly, so the future seemed rather bleak at first. But he had some magic scrolls from the Demon King\u2019s Castle. Perhaps that\u2019s why he tried to raise some funds by selling them to the Scroll Shop owners on the Aligar District\u2019s shopping street.\u201dCharlotte deduced the truth from only these bits of information. A boy who sold fake scrolls. From that, Charlotte might have concluded that those fake scrolls were actually demon scrolls, and that boy would be Valier without a doubt.\u201cHowever, the structure of demonic scrolls are vastly different from the scrolls we use. Merchants who have no magician-background would probably think he was trying to mess with them, trying to sell them fake scrolls.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Is that so?\u201dDemon scrolls and the one\u2019s humans used had structural differences. Without that knowledge I ignorantly wandered in every scroll shop and tried to sell them before I finally met Eleris.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he felt like something was wrong and realized that he wouldn\u2019t be able to sell the demonic scrolls, but I heard he took a Fireball scroll from one of the stores to sell. That isn\u2019t the weird part however. There were eyewitness testimonies that stated that he took a Fireball scroll, but no one ever bought one around that time.\u201dEleris falsified her testimony, so that was where the trace got cut off.\u201cMaybe he stole it, got scared and simply ran away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible. Then I would have to investigate shopping streets located in different places\u2026.\u201dCharlotte nodded her head after listening to my intentionally misleading comment.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the store from where he stole the Fireball scroll.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t actually steal it. That guy handed it over willingly, but I couldn\u2019t correct her on this point.Charlotte walked ahead to lead the way. That must have been information she had already been aware of, so did she really think that she would get any different results just because she decided to investigate herself?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Like that we arrived at the shop of this guy who gave me that Fireball scroll, blinded by greed.-SqueakI never thought I\u2019d ever return to this place.\u201c\u2026\u2026What? What do you kids want?\u201dEleris told me this shop owner\u2019s name, but I couldn\u2019t remember it. He still looked as grumpy and greedy as before though. Charlotte took the lead and walked towards the counter.\u201cAre you Mr. Borton?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah, so what?\u201dWhen she called out the guy\u2019s name, he seemed slightly surprised. Charlotte seemed to have compiled almost every piece of information about him prior to this.\u201cYou reported that someone stole a Fireball scroll from you the other day, is that correct?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What? You\u2019re asking about this again? I told those Guards everything I had to say. Are they even having kids look into this now?\u201dIt seemed like he was sick and tired of talking about this incident, as if he constantly had to repeat the story.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask about this again. Still, this is very important to us, so we\u2019re still looking into it. Could you tell me what happened back then one more time?\u201dRather than pushing her point in an authoritarian way, Charlotte asked him politely.\u201cIf I were to catch the guy, I was told that I would get lots of money in addition to my Fireball scroll, but I haven\u2019t even found a single hair of him, so what does it matter? Just what kind of incident did that brat cause?\u201dThat scammy merchant seemed almost convinced that the reason for so many people digging up information on me was that I got involved in some big incident.\u201cI can\u2019t divulge such information. It\u2019s classified.\u201d\u201cYou want me to tell you everything, while not giving me even a bit of information?\u201dBorton smiled as if what we asked for was absurd.\u201cFine. I won\u2019t get any rest anyway before I get that brat in my fingers.\u201dHe was talking as if he held a deep grudge against the one who stole his precious Fireball scroll. Watching that greedy bastard getting angry in front of me made my blood pressure rise through the roof.Normally I would have flipped the table right that moment, but I would get into some pretty serious trouble if I were to step up now, so I just clenched my fists and tried to endure it. He explained the situation, his face contorted by anger as he thought back to that time.\u201cSo a couple of months ago or so, some well-young brat came to me with a scroll book and tried to sell it to me. However, they were all just really well-drawn fake scrolls. So I asked him, \u201cWhy are you trying to sell that shit? Get out of here!\u201d, but when I kicked him out, he swiped a Fireball scroll. I was so angry when I found out later on. I tried to sniff him out, but it was useless. That\u2019s it. Then there were a ton of people rushing around to catch that bastard. Who knows what kind of accident he caused.\u201dIt was quite an arbitrary explanation. And the part where he handed me the scroll himself was drastically changed to me having swindled him.\u201cBut what leads would you even gain from this? That guy might as well have disappeared into thin air or burrowed deep into the ground. I don\u2019t even know his name.\u201dBorton sighed, thinking that no one would be able to find someone just based on such an eyewitness account. It seemed like he still spent restless nights thinking about the money he lost. Charlotte looked at Borton and smiled from within her robe.\u201cWe definitely gained some leads from this.\u201d\u201cFrom this?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dCharlotte looked around the store, not at Borton himself.\u201cI\u2019ve already found one, you know?\u201dCharlotte already noticed something that wasn\u2019t in the report.\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201dBorton\u2019s expression turned sickly pale when Charlotte suddenly said that she already found a lead.As if not noticing his state of mind at all, she pulled out a scroll from under her robe.\u201cI\u2019ll give you this scroll for a quarter of the regular price.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fake. Please confirm.\u201dWhen that little girl suddenly took out a magic scroll and showed it to him, Borton laid it out on the counter and looked at it, a smirk evident on his lips.\u201c\u2026\u2026Lightning Scroll\u2026. It\u2019s genuine. The market price for this scroll is 1 gold, so a quarter of it would be 25 silver.\u201d\u201cYou can buy it or not, it\u2019s up to you.\u201dCharlotte mentioned that 1 gold was the correct price, so she didn\u2019t have anything to complain about, so Borton handed her 25 silver as if they were candy. It wasn\u2019t exactly a lead, but we could see that he was extremely elated having been handed something basically for free.After receiving the silver coins, Charlotte smiled.\u201cNow then, during this whole process, when would I have had the opportunity to steal your scrolls?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have an appraising machine somewhere in the back, and it seems like you\u2019re able to directly appraise if the scroll is fake or not at the counter. You said as soon as you noticed that the scroll the boy handed to you was fake you kicked him out. Please remind me. Just how did he manage to steal a Fireball scroll from the scroll cabinet behind you?\u201dCharlotte pointed to the big cabinet behind Borton. It was placed in a way that guests wouldn\u2019t be able to access it.If Valier showed him the scroll and Borton had to take it to the back to appraise it, he would have had the opportunity to secretly steal a Fireball scroll.However, to stop the shop owner from sprouting such excuses Charlotte deliberately sold him a scroll at a very low price and watched how that transaction would proceed.From the start, Charlotte was trying to see if it was even possible for someone to steal a scroll or not, taking the store\u2019s structure into consideration.Charlotte laughed, with her head slightly tilted.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely impossible that he took a Fireball scroll like that. You\u2019re hiding something. Out with it.\u201dCharlotte saw through Borton\u2019s lie and completely cut off any form of excuse.\u201cWha, what are you saying?! If I tell you he swiped it, he swiped it, you little bitch\u2026.\u201dHis face swelled, confronted with this absurdity and he tried to step out from behind the counter.\u201cHey, you idiot, watch what you say.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was me who spoke up, not Charlotte, who was still wearing a robe. The fact that she didn\u2019t reveal her identity seemed to mean that she didn\u2019t want to pressure him using her authority.\u201cI\u2019m a student of Temple\u2019s Royal Class. If you don\u2019t want this to get bloody, keep talking, you hear?\u201dSince Charlotte didn\u2019t want to reveal her identity, I just revealed mine. Be thankful, you bastard. If I hadn\u2019t stepped up you might have gotten exiled or worse.\u201cTe, Temple\u2026?\u201dI waved my student ID right in front of his face, and I could see that he was slightly pissed off by being talked to like this by some young bastard.\u201cYeah, Temple. You\u2019d lose no matter what you\u2019d do anyway, but are you sure you\u2019re even capable of beating me up? Well, I\u2019m pretty dang sure that I can hand your ass to you in a fight, no matter what. So, how about it? If you have the confidence to put a scratch on me, come at me.\u201dAs I muttered these words with a threatening force behind them, the store owner seemed to struggle between his feelings of indignation after being looked down on by a young boy and not wanting to get into trouble by laying hand on a Temple student. Charlotte seemed a little surprised. She didn\u2019t seem to have expected that I would interfere like this.Anyway, Charlotte already saw through Borton\u2019s lies. She would have found out the truth sooner or later. Assuming that to be the case, I\u2019d rather get myself involved and show Charlotte my good side.\u201cIf he stole it, you\u2019d surely know how he did it, right? If you can\u2019t even do that, just spit out what you\u2019re hiding.\u201dI would most certainly appear much more intimidating than Charlotte, who covered her face. When I stepped up, Charlotte fell into silence as if she planned on just watching from the sidelines.More than anything, I just couldn\u2019t stand that bastard talk for even a second longer.\u201cDon\u2019t you get that this isn\u2019t just your run-of-the-mill case? You\u2019re gonna be accused of obstruction of justice by spreading misleading information, you know? Are you gonna tell the truth now, or would you rather have someone you don\u2019t know drag you to some dank basement and beat the shit out of you?\u201dI had no idea what kind of expression Charlotte made, hearing these ridiculous, threatening statements I made. It wasn\u2019t like I could control Charlotte\u2019s and Bertus\u2019 forces.These were just a list of scary words meant to get a reaction out of someone.Misleading information. Obstruction of justice. Getting kidnapped.If people hear these types of words lined up in a sentence, they\u2019d rather swallow swords than gambling on the option that these were just empty threats.I mean, it\u2019s just simple blackmail backed by empty threats. I didn\u2019t have a shred of authority to do anything like that after all.\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026. That is\u2026.\u201dHowever, it was difficult to think of this as just simple blackmail from Borton\u2019s standpoint.I had no intention of backing down either.When I saw him like that, I really wanted to see this bastard getting severely punished.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Borton eventually confessed.\u201c\u2026So you gave it to him?\u201d\u201cYe, yes\u2026.\u201dHowever, he didn\u2019t confess completely, but as defensively as possible. He said that he wasn\u2019t robbed, in fact, he just gave it to him.\u201cWhy would you just give him a Fireball scroll?\u201d\u201cWe, well, the guy tried to sell fake scrolls like that, so I just gave him a real one out of pity!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you telling us such a nonsensical lie? Didn\u2019t you call him a thief first? But now you\u2019re telling us you gave him the scroll because you felt sorry for him?\u201d\u201cY, yes! I just gave it to him!\u201dCharlotte had an incredulous look in her eyes, as if questioning that dude\u2019s intelligence. Although I had similar thoughts the moment he gave me the Fireball scroll, but that guy sure was seriously stupid and shameless.In the end, I got annoyed.It wasn\u2019t difficult for someone like Charlotte to completely break this guy\u2019s lies, but he just kept on sprouting new lies.\u201cHey, you bastard, do you think we\u2019re stupid? You probably just thought the guy was great at drawing fake scrolls, so you planned on making him draw more fake scrolls for you! You probably gave him the scroll and told him to copy that one. However, a few days after you gave it to him, you realized he took off with it. That\u2019s what happened, right?!\u201dIn the end, I couldn\u2019t bear with it anymore, and blurted out the truth I knew.\u201cIndeed. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking as well.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem too surprised by my reasoning, as if Charlotte already guessed as much. Borton\u2019s complexion grew perplexed when he was completely exposed.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it! D, do you have evidence? Are you just making people out to be scammers without proper evidence?! What did I even do!? I\u2019m the one who lost a Fireball scroll here! I lost money!\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dCharlotte sighed.\u201cHey, Mr. Borton. The Imperial Law does not punish those with the intent to commit a crime. You\u2019re not scamming anyone because you didn\u2019t actually sell fake scrolls yet, even if you were planning on doing that, although this is quite the moral issue it\u2019s not a legal one. I just want to know the truth. So this kid didn\u2019t steal the Fireball scroll. That\u2019s it, right?\u201dAfter Charlotte spoke to him in a very mature way, Borton started to regain his composure again.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. Fine. You\u2019re right. He didn\u2019t steal it. Well\u2026. Anyway, I gave it to him myself. That\u2019s the truth.\u201dIn the end, he still refused to admit that he was trying to scam people by selling mass-produced fake scrolls. Although I wasn\u2019t able to see Charlotte\u2019s expression, it was quite obvious that she disliked the person in front of her to a great extent.Then, as if her business with this place was over, Charlotte turned on her heels and left the store.\u201cI, I\u2019m telling the truth! I just gave it to him!\u201dHe pleaded his innocence until the very end, but Charlotte didn\u2019t respond to him anymore.The two of us went back out, standing on the Aligar shopping street, illuminated by the setting sun. Charlotte let out a deep sigh while covering her face with her hands.\u201cSiiiigh\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you angry?\u201d\u201cJust what was wrong with that person\u2019s head?\u201dCharlotte was so angry that her face was completely red.\u201cUurg\u2026. Uuuuurrg!\u201dCharlotte trembled, seeming like she was trying to contain her anger.She seemed so mad, however, I felt a little apologetic to her, because I thought she looked pretty cute like that. Charlotte got so angry. So angry, in fact, that she grabbed me, looked me straight in the eyes and started to talk.\u201cSeriously. How could he tell such a stupid lie without even flinching? Did he think I\u2019m dumb? Huh? Did he really think I\u2019d believe that? Just what\u2019s with this?\u201dIt seemed like Charlotte was most angry at that brazenness to just go with such a stupid lie, rather than Borton\u2019s lack of morality.\u201cHow can a person be so stupid? That\u2019s why the Empire needs to start a public education system as soon as possible! That way, there won\u2019t be any more stupid people like that idiot, right?\u201dWhat? Hey, wasn\u2019t she throwing a fit over something pretty weird?The reason idiots like that exist is because there\u2019s no public education.Was that it? So, in the end, did she feel like it was the responsibility of the Empire to educate people, so she blew her top? Was that why she seemed to feel ashamed and angry every time she saw people like that?\u201cY, you really have a unique point of view, in many ways, yeah\u2026.\u201dShe was the Imperial Princess. Her way of thinking was completely different from that of a criminal\u2019s.Even if public education was properly implemented, I couldn\u2019t agree with her opinion, because the world I lived in, which had such public education, was filled with similar idiots.\u201cB, by the way\u2026. How bout trying to calm down?\u201d\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah\u2026.. Ah. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe was so excited and spoke with such enthusiasm that she didn\u2019t notice that she was only inches away from my face. It almost seemed like she was attacking me. It was rather difficult for me to understand someone who got angry at people for not being too bright instead of doing something morally wrong.After a while, Charlotte calmed down, taking a few deep breaths.\u201cOkay\u2026. I did find it a little strange that he would steal something. So that is one problem solved.\u201dCharlotte seemed to have held some suspicions after reading in the report that I stole the Fireball scroll. So in the end, she seemed quite satisfied by finding out the truth behind this matter.\u201cBy the way, Reinhardt, you are quite amazing as well.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cWhen you were pressuring him.\u201dIt seemed like she was talking about the part where I tried to blackmail him to get him to tell the truth. Charlotte smiled at me.\u201cYou must have a lot of experience, right?\u201dI sighed at that sinister smile.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t done this kind of thing before, but not that often, you hear?\u201dMore than anything, I only stepped up and sprouted some nonsensical bullshit because I got extremely annoyed by that bastard.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with knowing how to do something like that. I enjoyed it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should take you telling me I\u2019m good at blackmailing as a compliment or criticism. Thanks, I guess.\u201dIt seemed like Charlotte revised her evaluation of me once again. Then she pointed to one of the stalls lining the streets.\u201cLet\u2019s eat something to cleanse our minds.\u201dShe jingled the bag of silver coins she received for that Lighting scroll she just sold while saying that.\u201cFor the day to have come where the Imperial Princess would actually treat me to street food. I feel so honored.\u201dAt my expression of gratitude, Charlotte gave me a slight look. Although I was taller than her, I could clearly see Charlotte\u2019s face hidden by her robe.\u201c\u2026I heard that you are quite disrespectful towards Bertus.\u201d\u201cTo be exact, what you should have heard is that I\u2019m extremely rude.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s quite the sight.\u201dCharlotte said that I was quite the strange person. On one hand, I was someone very wary of both the Prince and Princess, on the other hand, however, not in the slightest.\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t come to Temple, wouldn\u2019t you have died several times already?\u201dCharlotte told me that I would have had quite the early death if I lived as a normal commoner. They did have the principle of treating every student as equals, but no matter how one looked at it, I was going far beyond just being blunt.\u201cThat\u2019s why I think you\u2019d get into serious trouble the day you graduate from Temple. Have you considered being held back indefinitely?\u201d\u201cIf I want to live even a day longer, I might have to do that.\u201dCharlotte burst into laughter, saying that that might be the case.* * *Charlotte and I bought food similar to churros from a stall near the shopping street and ate them. It was a long piece of bread dipped into sugar. It looked like churros, but it tasted like\u00a0twisted breadsticks.No matter how one thought about it, sugar was quite the rare commodity in medieval times. What the hell? Although, I gave up thinking about that when I saw the other vendors selling candy.Right.A medieval Fantasy has nothing to do with the medieval times!Anyway, that\u2019s just how it is! Yeah!\u201cBy the way\u2026. Me saying that might be quite useless, but you\u2019re a princess, so why are you eating stuff sold on the street?\u201dThese types of food had very little nutritional value and were often undercooked. It wasn\u2019t like I really wanted to eat this, but I was really surprised at how casually she just bought and ate this. She even asked to eat this herself.Charlotte smiled strangely at my words.\u201cActually, I was a really picky eater in the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Really?\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, and I was exactly like you are imaging.\u201dThe type who\u2019d absolutely hate street food or any kind of low-quality food. It was even more interesting because Charlotte said that she WAS like that in the past, but not anymore. She didn\u2019t look like that type at all.In situations such as these, I realized how prejudiced I was.No matter how kind he looked, Bertus was still a type of villain.Charlotte didn\u2019t seem like a bad or mean person at all. She probably only acted that way because she had some reasons. I was like that as well.That is what one would call the law of the first impression.In that regard, I was probably the strangest person here.\u201cIf a person was close to dying of thirst with no water anywhere near them, they would even lick up the stagnant dirty water gathering on the floor. Not to mention when someone is close to dying of starvation. They would even eat a leather shoe.\u201dCharlotte looked at me and smiled. It wasn\u2019t a happy smile, but a grimace she pulled because she was unable to cry.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t find the right words to say to Charlotte, whose face was pulled into such a grimace.\u201cAfter humans are about to reach their end, all of us become the same. Noble or commoner, in the end we all are just the same.\u201dFaced with the absolute desire for survival, she found the mask she had worn all her life and that pride she had about her completely insignificant. She also realized that she wasn\u2019t any different from other people, either.\u201cDo you know what the scariest part was? It wasn\u2019t the torture, the threats and curses they hurled at me or having to look at their backs.\u201dI watched Charlotte, who was wearing an exceedingly dark expression on her face, as she stared at the churros she was eating a while ago.\u201cThere were people who ate each other because they couldn\u2019t take it anymore. And after they ate, they went crazy, shocked at the very fact that they did something so terrible.\u201dCharlotte looked at me.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the demons. The humans were the scariest.\u201dWhat she feared most were the humans.\u201cThe fact that the people around me became like that also meant that I could turn out like that as well. That was the most terrifying thing to me.\u201dBecause she might become like them, Charlotte didn\u2019t fear the demons as much as she did these broken humans. She wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d turn out when she was completely at her wits end.\u201cThat\u2026. was so terrifying and frightening that I thought I was going crazy\u2026. No, I probably already went crazy\u2026.\u201dI could clearly remember it.At the time I found her, Charlotte was crying while holding a certain someone\u2019s body.Charlotte didn\u2019t go into any more detail. However, since I could remember what Charlotte was like back then, I could tell what Charlotte meant.She was cradling that body.She seemed to be in excruciating pain.\u201cAt that time, a certain boy came to me. Other than me, there was one more child that survived\u2026. I couldn\u2019t believe it, but he appeared right in front of my eyes.\u201dWhen Charlotte\u2019s tears were just rolling down from her dead eyes, unable to even cry properly anymore, I appeared in front of her.The only other survivor besides her.\u201cHe gave me the only food he was able to find. He didn\u2019t even think of taking it for himself.\u201dIt was only a biscuit.It was much too little to fill one\u2019s stomach.\u201cThanks to that boy, I was able to remain as a human\u2026 No, I had already gone half-crazy at that point\u2026 I was finally able to let my sanity resurface\u2026.\u201dHe was a boy who freely handed over the food he should have been so desperate for as well.He was the only other survivor except herself.At that time, Charlotte seemed relieved by my very existence. It seemed like she was touched just by knowing that she wasn\u2019t the only one left.Knowing that all of this was nothing more than a dirty lie, I was hardly able to look Charlotte in the eyes.Charlotte said some heavy things, so she ended up laughing somewhat exaggeratedly.\u201cAfter that, I never complained about food again.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. After that, whatever you ate tasted delicious\u2026. Something like that?\u201dCharlotte shook her head.\u201cAfter that, I just realized that nothing would be more delicious than that biscuit I had back then. Whatever I put into my mouth, it just tastes so-so.\u201dShe didn\u2019t become grateful for the food that she could eat freely after that.Knowing that nothing she would eat for the rest of her life would taste as divinely as that biscuit she had eaten after almost starving to death. That was why Charlotte stopped being a fussy eater.No matter what she ate, it just tasted bland, so it didn\u2019t matter what she ate.\u201c\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t that kinda pessimistic?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it much better that I became a pessimistic person instead of a crazy one?\u201dCharlotte frowned slightly while smiling. It was a bit sad to hear that it was already good enough that she hadn\u2019t gone completely crazy in that situation.However, Charlotte\u2019s smile was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe for a short while.\u201cWhy do you keep telling me things, I shouldn\u2019t hear? Let\u2019s just keep it at that. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you suddenly told me something like: \u201cNow that I told you this, you have to die\u201d.\u201dTo be honest, we weren\u2019t actually that close right now! Of course, it certainly seemed like she opened her heart to me to some extent, but wasn\u2019t she rushing a bit here?Did she want to talk to someone about this, but didn\u2019t have anyone she could actually turn to? So what was the point of grabbing me of all people and complaining to me?Charlotte laughed at my words.\u201cAren\u2019t you smart? Yeah, I need you to die now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going now. Bye. Sorry for being rude.\u201dI jumped up from my seat without hesitation, but Charlotte grabbed the hem of my clothes.\u201cHey, it was just a joke!\u201dCharlotte seemed to be having fun teasing me like that.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84\u201c\u2026By the way, you didn\u2019t even eat half of those, you know?\u201dCharlotte muttered as if she found it incredulous that I barely touched my churros.\u201cI don\u2019t like sweet things.\u201dRefined carbs fried in oil and sugar added to it on top? I felt my heart burn just thinking about it.Why were we eating this?Of course, I did eat the candy Eleris gave me, but that was it.At my words, Charlotte opened her mouth slightly as if what I said was ridiculous.It was as if she was telling me that I was seriously missing out.\u201cYou think it\u2019s weirder for a beggar from the streets to not like sweets, than a Princess that eats anything regardless of quality? Am I really that weird?\u201dA princess who would eat anything, no matter what it is.And a beggar who stopped eating after a single bite simply because he didn\u2019t like sweets.Both of us were pretty rare sights.To be honest, the Princess had a reason for her behavior. It was a bit harder to explain why I was like this, though.\u201cWell, I\u2019m different from you, Princess. I always had to eat cheap stuff, but now that I get to eat the highest quality food, I realized what it really means to eat. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I apologize for asking, but are you truly satisfied?\u201d\u201cOf course. How could I not be? I get to study in the world\u2019s best education institution and eat the highest quality food.\u201d\u201c\u2026I have no words.\u201dCharlotte was completely speechless, looking at me as if I was a weirdo.\u201cWhat do you like to eat then?\u201d\u201cSomething like hot meat stew.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s expression grew more and more bewildered when I told her what I liked.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s with this? When I talk to you, I sometimes feel like I\u2019m sitting in front of some stubborn minister. The way you talk, your tastes\u2026.\u201dDid she mean I act like a geezer?Well, to be fair, looking at my mental age and the Princess\u2019, it might feel that way.\u201cWhy thank you. I take it as appearing mature then.\u201d\u201cMaturity isn\u2019t always a good thing, though.\u201dI clearly understood that what she meant wasn\u2019t that I was actually mature. She was being sarcastic. After that, I forcibly stuffed the rest of the churros into my mouth.\u201c\u2026What? Didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t like sweets? Why are you eating it all of a sudden now?\u201dAfter forcing down that terribly sweet thing, I mumbled something.\u201cThrowing away the gift the Princess gave me, would be a waste though, right?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what Charlotte would think of me if I threw away the thing she gifted me. Well, there was nothing good about wasting food anyway.Of course, it wasn\u2019t that important to me that a Princess bought it for me, but that Charlotte bought it for me.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s truly ridiculous that you care about these types of things.\u201dIt seemed like Charlotte was on the verge of giving up trying to understand me. It looked like she doubted whether I was conscious of my actions or not.Our brief break was over.We sat on a bench and kept on watching people passing by.\u201cIt seems like there are some things you have to experience yourself to come to a proper conclusion.\u201d\u201cUhm, Well\u2026. Seems to be the case today.\u201dCharlotte sighed heavily.Apparently, Charlotte had someone search through the Aligar District\u2019s shopping street. However, he failed to uncover the truth behind the scroll robbery.\u201cI knew my people were only capable of doing what I told them to do, so this could be called a harvest in its own way.\u201dThey only do what they are told to do.I didn\u2019t think she meant that in a good way, but in the end, just by getting to know that her people lacked a certain something, Charlotte seemed to judge this as a big harvest.It wasn\u2019t anything difficult to find out, but they took that testimony at face value and only reported its contents to Charlotte. They never even questioned the credibility of this information.Of course, we were only able to come to this conclusion because I knew the truth, and Charlotte thought fiercely about this incident because she was just that desperate.If I didn\u2019t actually know the truth, I might have dismissed this as well.\u201cIf I asked someone to dig a well, they should know that my intention was to look for water\u2026.\u201dCharlotte seemed disappointed by her subordinates, but she remained firm.She asked them to investigate Valier\u2019s actions on Aligar District\u2019s shopping street.This instruction contained the intention of finding Valier, and here they were just returning with some testimonies. So, they even brought information that lacked credibility to her.\u201cI was able to find out a lot more just by checking myself.\u201d\u201cWhat else is there?\u201dCharlotte stared at me. No, her gaze seemed to ask if I didn\u2019t even know that much, either.\u201cIn the report I received, the testimonies of the owners and their store names were written down. All testimonies were arranged in a neat document\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. yeah?\u201d\u201cHowever, by coming here myself, I\u2019m able to see everything. The location of the stores, for example\u2026. Like this, it would only be natural for me to find something.\u201dCharlotte pointed to the other side of the shopping street.That was where we came from.\u201cHis path.\u201dThose words sent a chill down my spine.\u201cHe came in from over there and went into every scroll shop he saw at least once. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to enter the stores we were kicked out of today, either. Only the ones that gave testimonies.\u201dThen Charlotte pointed towards the other end of the shopping street.\u201cAnd, after that Fireball scroll shop, there were no further eyewitness reports. We don\u2019t have to visit these places in person. His movement suddenly ended there.\u201dShe found out these things right away.I knew Charlotte was smart. A lot smarter than I could ever be.The location of the stores weren\u2019t written down in their report.However, if one were to visit this place themselves, one would find out rather quickly.If one were to connect the store\u2019s positions, one could read his movements quite clearly.\u201cIf he stole that Fireball scroll, it would make sense that he stopped. He might have run away with it to not get caught after all.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I guess.\u201d\u201cBut we just found out that this scroll wasn\u2019t actually something he stole. So, he wouldn\u2019t have had any reason to run away like that.\u201dIf he had stolen it, he would have tried to sell the scroll elsewhere outside the shopping street. Then, it would make complete sense that the trace cut off there.However, the truth was that he hadn\u2019t stolen the scroll. The shop owner actually gave it to him. So, there was no reason for him to run away, making his disappearance not as plausible.\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t able to sell the demonic scrolls, then he would probably have tried to sell that Fireball scroll he got from that shop owner. Either way, he was pressed for money. This leaves us two possibilities. The Fireball scroll store owner lied again\u2026. There\u2019s the possibility that he hurt the kid himself and is now pretending not to know anything more than he said, but it\u2019s probably not possible for that idiot to come up with something like that taking his lacking brain into consideration\u2026.\u201dI felt like my whole body was getting colder and colder.\u201cOr he went over there. The next store.\u201dCharlotte pointed somewhere.\u201cThere\u2019s a very high possibility that his movement ended at the Fireball store or that place.\u201dIt was Eleris\u2019 Scroll shop.Charlotte was able to reach the truth only with her extremely limited amount of information.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I couldn\u2019t let Charlotte enter Eleris\u2019 shop.\u201cErm\u2026. It might not necessarily be that place, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible. Maybe they actually kicked him out, but didn\u2019t remember it.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to be that suspicious of Eleris at the moment.\u201cBut the fact that we didn\u2019t have any eyewitness accounts from this part of the street means that there were some people among the shop owners that lied. It\u2019s very likely that one of them did something to the boy.\u201dDamn it, I didn\u2019t have any good justification. Charlotte was having reasonable doubts, so it was impossible for me to keep her away.Even if it was somehow possible, Charlotte wouldn\u2019t want to leave a single stone unturned. Even if there was only a small chance that she might find traces of Valier, she would try to investigate no matter what.\u201cHe didn\u2019t necessarily have to visit another scroll store\u2026. Isn\u2019t there a possibility that he left because of another reason?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. You\u2019re right. As soon as you walk around openly carrying a scroll book, you\u2019re already a prime target for pickpockets or other criminals.\u201dCharlotte nodded at my suggestion to not focus too much on the scroll stores. There was still the possibility that he might have gotten pickpocketed or targeted by some criminals after walking around the shopping street with his scroll book for quite a while.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to consider this possibility after we\u2019ve secured the testimonies of the next few scroll shops.\u201dThe more information, the better.So, she was willing to keep that possibility in the back of her mind. She planned on checking that option after visiting these scroll shops and finding out if someone among the store owners lied.In the end, there was absolutely no reason for Charlotte to not go into Eleris\u2019 store.And more importantly.At the moment, Eleris went to the Edina islands to take care of Airi and the others. It was obvious that she hadn\u2019t come back yet.It was unclear to me whether Eleris\u2019 absence was a good or bad thing, however, this situation was just too unpredictable.I\u2019m pretty sure Charlotte wouldn\u2019t find out my identity by doing this, but if she were to suspect Eleris in any way, there was a high chance that her identity as a vampire could be brought to light.I couldn\u2019t let that happen.So, I tried using the Revise function.Charlotte thinks it\u2019s not worth examining Eleris\u2019 shop.[10.000 achievement points are needed to perform this Revision.]Damn it.Charlotte\u2019s determination to find just a single clue was so strong that it was almost impossible for her to even consider not investigating every nook and cranny of this place. So, the probability of her ignoring this place was abysmally low.-Rattle! Rattle!\u201cHmm\u2026. It\u2019s locked.\u201dCharlotte tilted her head after she found out that the door to Eleris\u2019 store was locked. Eleris hadn\u2019t returned yet.\u201c\u2026\u2026It could be their day off today.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t we take a look at other places? They have to return to this place some day, right?\u201dI talked as calmly as possible, pretending nothing was wrong. However, Charlotte was still fixated on this locked door.It seemed like she was starting to get some doubts, realizing a certain possibility. I could clearly see subtle joy radiating from her face.Her expression seemed to express that she was finally able to come across a clue she never thought she would ever find.It was surprising.Charlotte was able to find out at what place my traces really ceased, with only these insignificant eyewitness testimonies.Charlotte went straight to the next store, which was a weaponry store, not a scroll store. I thought we would go to the next scroll shop. There was no way this person would have any information.\u201c\u2026\u2026What business do you little kids have here?\u201d\u201cDoes the scroll store next door have a day off today?\u201dThe middle-aged owner with a shaggy beard shook his head and smiled.Charlotte asked him about the owner next door, not Valier.\u201cNo? Miss Elena seemed to have gone quite far away. She doesn\u2019t open her shop these days.\u201dI now knew that Eleris\u2019 pseudonym was Elena.It had been a while since Eleris closed up shop. Of course, it was like that, because she was in a situation in which she couldn\u2019t be here after all. This was unexpectedly getting worse and worse.\u201cSince when has the shop been closed?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. Since last Monday. So right when the Festival started. She might have gone somewhere far away to relax. That\u2019s what young people do.\u201dHearing that, Charlotte had a slightly sullen expression on her face. The owner\u2019s reasoning that she might have left for somewhere further away in time of the Festival was quite plausible.The Festival was now over, but she may have just extended her vacation.\u201cIs that owner young?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s young and very beautiful. There are a lot of guys gathering around her\u2026 No. What am I saying?\u201dHe shook his head, wondering why he even said this. The thing he talked about was obviously something Eleris was greatly troubled by.\u201cWhy are you looking for Elena? If it\u2019s a scroll shop, even if I feel sorry for sending Miss Elena\u2019s potential customers away, there are quite a few of those around here.\u201dHe was talking quite gently, because he thought we were her guests. Obviously, he seemed a lot kinder than the other shopkeepers around here.\u201cI have my reasons. Do you know when that person named Elena will come back?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. Not really. I don\u2019t even know where she went. I mean, she just left without a word.\u201d\u201cDo you know anyone who knows?\u201dI want them to stop, but I wasn\u2019t able to just put a hold to this conversation.\u201cWell\u2026. Miss Elena doesn\u2019t even attend the merchants\u2019 meetings, and although she does get along with everyone, she isn\u2019t particularly close with anyone or anything like that. She doesn\u2019t even go out with others to eat lunch together. However, people say she has a very kind heart. That\u2019s why it\u2019s said that she doesn\u2019t have the right constitution to be a merchant or do business\u2026.\u201dShe got along well with everyone, but never got really close to anyone. Although she makes a living as a merchant, she wasn\u2019t like the other Aligar merchants, who could only survive by scamming others.Slight doubts turned into suspicion, and that suspicion would soon turn into complete certainty.She hadn\u2019t yet grasped all the details, but it seemed like she got a feeling that this person was very strange.\u201cHmhm\u2026.\u201dAs if she had made up her mind, Charlotte started to laugh.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Huh?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dCharlotte, leaving the wide-eyed owner behind, dragged me outside and went back to Eleris\u2019 store.\u201cWe have to force our way in.\u201dAs her suspicions grew closer to certainties, it seemed that Charlotte was ready to make use of any method possible.From inside her robe, blue light emanated from the earring Charlotte was wearing.There was a reason after all why she was able to go around all alone.Charlotte wore some kind of artifact, similar to my Flame of Tuesday. I was pretty sure that this wasn\u2019t the only one either.\u201cBreak it.\u201d-Kruuaaak!With just a short phrase, an explosion rang out from Eleris\u2019 shop\u2019s door. An invisible shock wave smashed through it.-W-What!-What\u2019s going on!\u201cYou! What are you guys doing!\u201dThe street was drowning in a huge commotion caused by this sudden explosion.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dCharlotte, however, didn\u2019t seem to care about anything else going on around her, and walked through the smashed door without hesitation.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Eleris didn\u2019t put any protective magic on her door, so it was easily broken.However, if she had put some protective magic on it, that in itself could be seen as a piece of evidence. That locked door would have caused trouble no matter if it was able to be broken or not.The moment this place caught Charlotte\u2019s eye, it was already over.This situation was no longer stoppable. I couldn\u2019t do something crazy like smacking Charlotte in the back of her head, either. Leaving the commotion brewing outside behind, Charlotte entered the shop.\u201cHmm\u2026. The cabinet is locked\u201dThe scroll cabinets everywhere in this shop were now literally shuttered down. Charlotte went over to the counter and carefully checked over every scroll cabinet.\u201cThere are magic locks installed. Still, everyone uses these, though\u2026.\u201dThe property of scroll shops were the scrolls themselves. So it was only natural for the cabinets to have magic locks to prevent theft on them. Charlotte tapped on one of the shuttered cabinets that occupied one of the walls.\u201cReinhardt, if there were any Fireball scrolls in there, what do you think is the probability of it being the one from that other shop?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. Pretty low, right?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026. Right? Although it\u2019s quite expensive, it isn\u2019t a rare type of scroll. Even if there were any in there, they could simply be up for sale\u2026\u201dCharlotte knew that even if there was a Fireball scroll in there, it certainly wouldn\u2019t make good evidence.She took a book out of her pocket. It was a scroll book. After flipping through the pages, she immediately pulled out a single scroll.\u201cStill, it wouldn\u2019t be a waste to check. It might contain the demonic scrolls he had with him.\u201dEleris might have taken the scrolls and killed me. There was a good possibility that she was thinking like that.It was obvious what kind of magic scroll Charlotte took out. I didn\u2019t even have to look at it.It was probably a scroll of type Unlock or Dispel. The moment Charlotte was about to rip apart the scroll to cast the spell.\u201cHuh\u2026? No, what is this mess?\u201dEleris, who should not be here, appeared on the stairs leading to the upper floor.\u201cY-You! Who are you\u2026?\u201dShe was looking at me and Charlotte, who was about to cast Dispel, alternately with a startled look.She simply asked who we were.Thanks to these words, I realized that she completely knew what was going on here. I didn\u2019t exactly know what happened, but Eleris was back in her shop, and she knew what was going on.She was pretending not to know me. That was the proof.\u201cAh\u2026. You were there?\u201dAfter some confusion, Charlotte took off her robe.\u201cMy name is Charlotte de Gardias. As the Imperial Princess, there are a few questions I would like to ask you.\u201dCharlotte judged that now wasn\u2019t the time for her to continue to hide her identity.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Ignoring the commotion outside, Eleris appeared quite flustered and immediately bowed her head in front of the Princess.\u201cF-For her Highness the Imperial Princess to come to such a shabby place like this\u2026.\u201c\u201cI have no intentions of dragging this out any longer than necessary. I would like you to answer some questions.\u201dAfter revealing her identity, Charlotte began to speak in a coercive and cold manner. Eleris was certainly acting like a normal commoner of the Empire.I had no idea in what direction this would lead, but I prayed that this would resolve all this. I fiercely hoped that Eleris prepared a plausible excuse. There was nothing I could do to help at this point.I didn\u2019t even imagine I\u2019d ever enter this place with Charlotte and even meet Eleris, so my mind was in total chaos at the moment.\u201cYou should know that there are many people looking for a single boy around this area.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m aware of that, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cI heard you said you never saw that child. Are you sure of that?\u201dCharlotte, who completely revealed her identity, still remained somewhat respectful, but as a member of the Imperial Family, she had an attitude that it was only a matter of course that her questions would be answered.\u201cYes, Your Highness. I am sure. I\u2019ve never seen a child like that anywhere around here before.\u201d\u201cLook into my eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cLook into my eyes and tell me.\u201dAs if she was trying to see if Eleris was lying, Charlotte stared into Eleris eyes with a completely blank look. Eleris also struggled to move her head facing Charlotte away.\u201cHave you really never seen him?\u201d\u201cYes. Definitely.\u201dI wondered what she saw in Eleris eyes, as she was clearly lying. Charlotte looked like that at her for a long time, then pointed her chin to a specific place.\u201cUnlock the scroll cabinet.\u201dThe Fireball scroll.Charlotte was trying to see if she had any.I didn\u2019t even know where she placed it. Only Eleris knew. She trembled in fear and soon unlocked the magic lock.\u201cPlease show me your ID.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026. Here you go.\u201dCharlotte checked the ID Eleris had given her, and soon lost interest, then she went to open the scroll cabinet and began to rummage through it.While rummaging, Charlotte asked a few more questions.\u201cIs Count Pergia a decent lord?\u201dIt was a pretty meaningless question. What the hell did she want to achieve by asking something like that?\u201cTh-That\u2026. Count Pergia\u2026. The one in charge of the region is Bishop Rendry. Count Pergia isn\u2019t actually a lord\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, is that how it is?\u201dAnd, as I heard Eleris\u2019 sudden response, I felt a chill running down my spine.Charlotte was questioning Eleris about her origins.I didn\u2019t know where it was located, but it seemed like Eleris set up Pergia County as her place of origin.If Eleris said that Count Pergia was a pretty decent lord, Charlotte would have mentioned that it was actually ruled by Bishop Rendry. It was a trap. If one wasn\u2019t from that place, one wouldn\u2019t actually know that it was ruled by someone of the church.If she wasn\u2019t actually from that place, there was no way for her to have known such a tidbit. However, Eleris answered correctly.Charlotte was, of course, aware of such issues within the Empire. Eleris did some preliminary research about that place as well, to be able to answer questions about her supposed place of origin.Both were rather creepy in my opinion.As she continued to rummage through the cabinets, Charlotte didn\u2019t stop asking questions.\u201cAre you a wizard?\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness. But there are tools that I can handle using magic power.\u201d\u201cHmm, wizards wouldn\u2019t have a reason to run a scroll store. However, it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t any such cases.\u201dAfter she was done going through that cabinet, Charlotte looked at it with crossed arms.\u201cThere aren\u2019t any Fireball scrolls\u2026\u201dAnyway, it seemed like the Fireball scroll was already disposed of.\u201cThis seems to be quite the unique store. They don\u2019t sell any attack magic scrolls whatsoever.\u201dCharlotte noticed a peculiarity that made Eleris\u2019 store different from other stores.\u201cBring the ledger.\u201dIt seemed like Charlotte wouldn\u2019t leave this place until all her suspicions had been answered.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I realized again how meticulous Eleris was. Regardless of whether the business was going well or not, Eleris thoroughly managed her books.She was placed into the Imperial Capital as a spy of the Demon Realm, but one would never know when she might get discovered. So, it seemed like everything was meticulously prepared so that she wouldn\u2019t leave anything suspicious behind.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you selling attack magic scrolls?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026. Because attack magic can be easily abused for violent crimes. It would be fine if they were just used against monsters, but I know there are quite a few cases where they aren\u2019t used as intended\u2026\u201dEleris kept in mind that the scrolls she sold could be used for crimes. That was why she didn\u2019t sell attack magic scrolls.That was absolutely something Eleris would do.However, in the end, this aspect turned into a weakness in a way. Eleris wasn\u2019t as meticulous in that area.\u201cBut aren\u2019t attack magic scrolls in high demand?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dThat was why her business wasn\u2019t doing all that well. It was impossible to find fault with the fact that the merchant herself refused to sell certain things, though.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dAfter Charlotte looked through the whole ledger, she closed the book.\u201cIt seems like you have nothing to do with the boy I\u2019m looking for.\u201dCharlotte predicted that the one who recognized the true worth of these demonic scrolls probably took it from the boy and did him in. However, Eleris didn\u2019t deal in attack magic scrolls, and according to the people around her, she didn\u2019t really have any business sense or drive.It goes without saying that she wouldn\u2019t even consider stealing something from someone else.So, this made it seem like all doubts had been cleared on that side. However, Charlotte still pointed at the ledger.\u201cBut it seems like you didn\u2019t write down the store\u2019s maintenance fees here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter having taken a look at Eleris\u2019 shop, Charlotte seemed to have some more doubts. Having taken a look at Eleris\u2019 sales, she must have noticed that they were really little.\u201cWhere do you take the means to maintain this shop? Refusing to sell attack magic scrolls, which are in high demand. It seems that you don\u2019t have the smallest intentions of making money\u2026.\u201dThe maintenance fees are covered by the Rotary gang. However, if Charlotte managed to figure out things up to that point, it was very likely that she\u2019d come to the conclusion that I was entangled in this as well.I was getting goosebumps.Would she really manage to do that?\u201cThat\u2026. I\u2019m actually losing money\u2026.\u201dOf course, Eleris told her that she was doing business while gnawing away at her own capital. In the end, she chose this simple excuse that was just incapable of doing business. She jumped into the business world half-heartedly, but she was stubborn, so ended up bleeding herself dry.\u201cAnd yet you went on vacation during the Victory Festival?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\u201cI just\u2026 went camping near the Capital\u2026. Then I heard that there was a terrorist attack, so I decided to stay there a little longer and only came back today\u2026.\u201dIf she said that she went somewhere using the Warp Gates, one could easily check that by going through the gate usage history, so she probably tried to avoid saying anything about that for that reason.\u201cCamping\u2026. Camping, is it\u2026.?\u201d\u2018You had a good time, huh?\u2019, was what Charlotte\u2019s expression seemed to express.Why?It seemed like Charlotte\u2019s feelings towards her were slowly changing, didn\u2019t they?She seemed to find her truly pitiful.\u201cI heard that all the Aligar district merchants were filthy savages. I now believe, that not all of them are like that.\u201dAs if she never heard of anyone who was willing to go bankrupt for their principles, Charlotte seemed happy in many different ways. It seemed like all her doubts had finally been cleared.That was what I thought until she pointed towards the stairs.\u201cCould I go up there?\u201dCharlotte pointed towards the stairs leading up to the second floor.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The upper floor was where Eleris lived.There was only a living room and another room.\u201c\u2026\u2026It doesn\u2019t seem like much of a living room.\u201dCharlotte said so after seeing this minimally furnished room. There was only a single table and some chairs in the room, and a bed with a blanket in the other room.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. because I can\u2019t afford more\u2026.\u201dIt was true that she lived in great poverty.It seemed like Charlotte didn\u2019t find anything but the reality of someone living in poverty in this barren room. Eleris squeezed herself in and showed Charlotte around while my heart was about to burst from tension.Actually, these types of rooms were found in many households, but there were some that were actually worse off.In her kitchen there was just a simple fridge and some cookware.-Rattle\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dCharlotte was now looking through Eleris\u2019 fridge, took account of the frozen snacks she had in there and nodded slowly.Eleris started preparing some food in case she had to give me some. I wasn\u2019t sure if fridges were expensive in this world or not, but having it justified her having bought this food, but not having eaten any of it.At the moment Charlotte thought Eleris to be the prime suspect of causing Valier\u2019s disappearance, so she looked through her place, but she was actually investigating the living space of a vampire who infiltrated the Imperial Capital.If Charlotte was actually suspecting her to be a demon, then she\u2019d be able to find many suspicious things in this place, but she was only looking for traces that could lead to Valier.Then Charlotte went into the bedroom. All it held was a window near the bed, a blanket draped over the bed, and a wardrobe.Occasionally, Eleris\u2019 and my eyes met to avoid Charlotte\u2019s gaze.\u2018Are you alright?\u2019\u2018I think so!\u2019We held such conversations with our eyes. Charlotte kept looking at the bed and then grabbed something.\u201cElena.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cThis hair. Whose is it?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dThere, on her bed, was a hair that was clearly blonde. Completely different from Eleris\u2019 red-brown hair.When I hid my horns and took on my human form, my hair turned blonde. And the hair Charlotte picked up was exactly the same blonde tone.That was obviously my hair. I was here at the start of the Festival for a few days.Charlotte probably would mistake that hair for Valier\u2019s hair.That\u2019s right! My hair was my hair. That much was obvious!However, would it still be my hair if it fell from the head of another me? Not Valier\u2019s hair, but Reinhardt\u2019s hair?I, in the first place, why did that hair even fall out? No, well, one usually loses one or two hairs, right? It just naturally happened when one slept.It was fine as long as it wasn\u2019t black! No, how could it even turn black? I was blonde like this, after all.I clenched my fists and held back the desire to immediately check how many hairs were missing from my head.\u201cI asked whose hair this is.\u201dOf course, Charlotte, who had a view completely different from me on this, began to question Eleris again.Eleris\u2019 face was already getting red. For the day to come where I got to see a vampire\u2019s face turning completely red. Did vampires actually have that much blood in them?Charlotte was questioning her on this hair that was obviously from someone else.\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026. m-my\u2026. My b-boyfriend\u2019s\u2026. It\u2026. It seems\u2026.\u201dWhat else could Eleris say to that other than this?\u201cGasp!\u201dCharlotte freaked out and immediately let go of that piece of hair.\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026. I see\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. Your Highness\u2026.\u201dAs Charlotte was still rather young, she seemed to have pretty low tolerance to these kinds of things. Both Eleris and Charlotte had tomato red heads for varying reasons. Charlotte couldn\u2019t even look at Eleris\u2019 bed again, as if she just saw something she shouldn\u2019t have.That little kid. What was she imagining, that she couldn\u2019t even lift her head because it turned so red? Huh?\u201cTh-That\u2026. boyfriend\u2026. What\u2019s his name?\u201dOf course, Charlotte still continued her interrogation even though she felt such shame.At that moment, I thought that she was pretty great in many different ways.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Eleris quickly came up with her \u2018boyfriend\u2019s\u2019 personal information in detail. She came up with something so fast that I almost thought that fake boyfriend was actually a real person.No, this might be the personal information of an actual person. There was a high possibility that Charlotte would run a background check on him after all.Finally.She was indeed a bit strange, but Eleris seemed to have been cleared of all her charges.That was how Charlotte seemed to judge her, at least. There was no evidence after all. She only had a suspicion, but there was no physical evidence to support said suspicion.What would have happened if Eleris wasn\u2019t here?There was no evidence in the scroll cabinets, but there was this blonde hair she could presume to have fallen off Valier\u2019s head on her bed.Charlotte would have persistently dug up information on Eleris just by finding some circumstantial evidence alone.\u201c\u2026\u2026For the door repair fee.\u201dCharlotte handed two gold coins to Eleris.\u201cT-Thank you, Your Highness\u2026.\u201dIt was probably a much larger amount than required to repair the door.\u201cThen excuse us, Miss Elena.\u201dCharlotte decided to leave the shop, probably because she didn\u2019t have anything more to ask Eleris. Before leaving, Eleris\u2019 and my eyes met.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWe spoke no words with each other, but it felt like we conveyed a lot of things.* * *After we went back onto the street and walked for some time, she suddenly stopped.\u201cNo matter how much I think about it, it\u2019s very suspicious.\u201dIt seemed like Charlotte still hadn\u2019t put her doubts aside. She dragged me into an alley and stared at me.\u201cThen\u2026 do you think that her testimony was all a lie?\u201d\u201cEven if she has nothing to do with his disappearance, she, as a person, is just too suspicious.\u201dAt these words, I felt like my head completely froze over. I thought Charlotte didn\u2019t care about anything else but Valier. I was wrong.\u201cAttack magic scrolls are the most sought after among a scroll shop\u2019s products. However, she doesn\u2019t sell any, because there\u2019s a possibility that they could be used to commit a crime? Meaning that she never had the intention of running a proper business in the first place, right? More like, she has no interest at all. I looked at her ledgers and she wouldn\u2019t be able to even pay the rent with the measly amount she makes. And yet, judging by her records, she\u2019s been running this store for about 2 years now. That would mean that she was able to continue her business without making any proper sales for these 2 years.\u201dThat was suspicious.A scroll store that didn\u2019t sell attack magic scrolls.Even though she made nearly no sales at all, she was somehow able to maintain her store. Doing business didn\u2019t seem to be her purpose at all.\u201cAnd the rooms upstairs. Putting the thing with the hair aside, there were only a few household items.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 right.\u201dRegardless whether she was involved in Valier\u2019s disappearance or not, Charlotte had already marked Eleris as a very suspicious person.\u201cNo matter if the owner is there or not, what did she even do in these rooms? One can\u2019t even see that someone actually lived there.\u201dAnother suspicious point.The rooms seemed rather sterile. One couldn\u2019t tell at all what type of life she lived in there. It wasn\u2019t strange to call Eleris\u2019 apartment, which was completely void of a sense of being lived in, totally empty.Leaving the problem with Valier aside, it seemed like Charlotte came to the conclusion that the shop owner called Elena should be thoroughly investigated as she was highly suspicious.What should I do if the thought that Eleris might be a demon spy came across her mind? Of course, Eleris would be able to escape on her own, but that would mean that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see her in the Capital ever again.I had to do something.Whether I muddy the water or not, I wasn\u2019t the one who was in immediate danger, but Eleris.She already became convinced that the store was just a front and that she actually had a different goal.And, in order to prove that conviction, Charlotte would absolutely investigate every aspect of Eleris using all her might.It was only a matter of time before she realized that Eleris was a demon.\u201cCharlotte, don\u2019t get me wrong here. Just listen.\u201dIf that was the case, then it might be the better course of action to stop Charlotte\u2019s train of thoughts by telling her some of the truth on my part.\u201cI think we should stop here.\u201dThis became too big a deal.* * *We should stop here.Charlotte furrowed her eyebrows hearing these words, as if I was talking nonsense.\u201cStop? What do you mean?\u201dShe finally was able to find a clue, so she, quite understandably, wore an expression as if she couldn\u2019t understand why we should stop now.It wasn\u2019t the most conclusive evidence, but anyone could see that this situation was suspicious. Charlotte thought, if she dug up anything about Eleris, she would be able to find Valier.\u201cAs you said, this person is running this shop for some other reason, right? But she\u2019s deliberately shooting herself in the foot by doing something as strange as not selling attack magic scrolls, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte listened quietly, showing me her willingness to listen to what I had to say.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for her to act like that, so couldn\u2019t that mean that this person is just so kind bordering on stupidity? I wouldn\u2019t know for what other purpose she\u2019d do something like that.\u201dShe had this strange principle of not selling attack magic scrolls because she was afraid that they\u2019d be used to commit crimes. There was nothing else to it, but her being simply that kind. Hearing that, Charlotte nodded subtly, although she didn\u2019t seem conceived yet.\u201cI guess so. But what does that have to do with us having to stop here?\u201d\u201cThe boy you\u2019re looking for must have entered that store, just as you guessed. That\u2019s certain.\u201dI was trying to stop Charlotte from thinking any deeper into this by telling her the truth backed by plausible reasoning.\u201cAnd that kid obviously realized that there was something wrong with the demonic scrolls he was trying to sell. He\u2019d try to sell the fireball scroll in the next store, right? That\u2019s only logical.\u201d\u201cIt must have been like that.\u201d\u201cWhat would you have thought seeing a kid carry around something as dangerous as that if you were someone like that shopkeeper?\u201dWhat would the shop owner, who is so wary of crimes to the point of not selling attack magic scrolls, do, faced with a kid running around with a fireball scroll?\u201cI would have taken it\u2026\u2026. Something like that, right?\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have let the kid carry around that thing with him, no matter the price, right?\u201dIn fact, Eleris was trying to buy that fireball scroll off of me without even knowing who I was. It was also true that she became angry with me for carrying something so dangerous with me.\u201cAdditionally, she must have seen the scroll book he was wearing when he sold the fireball scroll, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 could be the case.\u201dEleris thought I was someone who stole and sold scroll books. So she almost took away my scroll book as well, saying that I probably had more dangerous scrolls in there, too.Then she found the demonic scrolls.It seemed like Charlotte wasn\u2019t able to understand what I was trying to express with this lengthy explanation.\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to say now is pure speculation.\u201dI wasn\u2019t actually guessing, these were hard facts, but I had no choice but to sell it to Charlotte like that.\u201cThat person probably checked the contents of the scroll book, so I\u2019m guessing she was able to recognize them as demon scrolls. Going by that, we could assume that she probably is a wizard.\u201dAlthough she was actually a vampire who happened to be a wizard, I only told her the second half of that truth. If she asked me how I could know that, I would have nothing to say to her.\u201cAssuming she recognized that they were demon scrolls. She must have questioned him about where he got them, right?\u201d\u201cI guess so. What are you trying to say?\u201dCharlotte asked me, as if she still didn\u2019t get what I was talking about. Charlotte always lost her composure when it involved Valier.Of course, now was the right time to hit her with a sudden revelation.\u201cI think she\u2019s somehow trying to protect that child in some way.\u201dBefore landing in a much more dangerous situation, I opted to tell Charlotte some half-truths.\u201cIf it\u2019s true that this person is a wizard, is able to recognize a demonic scroll, and is indeed a good person, she must have tried to help him once she found out that he was in danger.\u201dHiding him or sending him far away. I didn\u2019t tell her the specific method of how she was protecting him, but she seemed to think of various possibilities already.\u201cIf we\u2019re so sure we can find him through her, we should dig even deeper. And how do you even know that this person is actually protecting him? Your conclusions are only based on guesswork. Yes, your guesses could be true. Then why do we have to stop here? According to what you said, there are no other clues than what that person knows.\u201d\u201cIt might be more dangerous for him if we found out his whereabouts.\u201d\u201c!\u201dCharlotte opened her eyes wide at my words.\u201cIf we find out, so could Bertus.\u201dCharlotte thought it would be good if she were able to find the boy, but she didn\u2019t think that far ahead, apparently.\u201cWe\u2019ve already caused quite the commotion on this street. I don\u2019t know how far this news will spread. But if we were to actually find a meaningful clue, Bertus would be able to find out. If you start moving people to dig further into the shopkeeper, of course Bertus would know.\u201dCharlotte might be able to find out his whereabouts that way, but there was a chance that this information could reach Bertus\u2019 ears. Then he\u2019d also move to find the boy, throwing him into a very dangerous situation.\u201cI confirmed that the boy is safe with my supernatural ability. I don\u2019t exactly know how he\u2019s doing, but if we were to forcibly find out the information that person is hiding, things would become even more dangerous for him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t have enough evidence to prove my speculations.The assumptions of Eleris being a wizard, recognizing the demon scroll and being a very kind person that would do everything to protect a single child, should all be true.However, I told her just now that we shouldn\u2019t touch Eleris, especially because she might hold important clues.If she knew nothing, then it wouldn\u2019t be right to dig deeper, and even if she did know something, we shouldn\u2019t touch her further.That\u2019s what I told her, basically.\u201cWe can\u2019t be sure of that. Of course\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s not like I doubt your ability, but we can\u2019t know if that person is really protecting him or not\u2026. We just can\u2019t be sure.\u201dIn the end, it was all just speculation, right? It was true that Eleris might hold a clue, but she might have nothing to do with this as well. The boy might have disappeared somewhere else, but she seemed unsatisfied to stop like that.\u201cFine. Then let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cAgain?\u201d\u201cYeah, if we give her the impression that we aren\u2019t going to step down so easily, she might tell us the truth even if it\u2019s just a bit, right?\u201dOf course, this was all bullshit.All I had to do is give Eleris a sign that it was okay to talk a bit about this.* * *We returned to Eleris\u2019 shop. We had no problem seeing into the store as the door was open. Eleris was sitting idle in a place we could clearly see, and when we returned, she jumped up from her seat.\u201cY-You returned\u2026. Your Highness.\u201dSome time had now passed, and the number of people passing by was getting smaller and smaller. People directed their gaze towards the shop while passing by, but none seemed to have any intention of eavesdropping.Charlotte regarded the open door and pointed towards the stairs.\u201cHow about we go upstairs?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dEleris hesitated slightly, then led us upstairs again. She wore a very nervous expression.\u201cI won\u2019t take much of your time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dCharlotte wasn\u2019t here to interrogate her.\u201cI think you have a clear connection to the disappearance of this boy.\u201dWhen she voiced her convictions, Eleris clearly revealed a look of perplexity.\u201cBut I also know that he is in a lot of danger. So I have this hypothesis, that you are hiding or protecting him, because you think he might get harmed, and that it would be just as dangerous to leak information about his whereabouts to me, so you lied\u2026.\u201dCharlotte thought this was too much of an exaggeration. Even I wouldn\u2019t agree to something like that.Charlotte was only presenting this reasoning because of my conjecture, thinking that she should do everything she could.\u201cI will investigate you in any way I can, whether you tell me something or not. If there\u2019s anything you are hiding from me, you should tell me now. If it is true that the boy will be in more danger if the truth is revealed, I was thinking of stopping here for now.\u201dAfter taking a few deep breaths, Charlotte was looking at Eleris.\u201cElena, do you think it would be dangerous for him if I were to find out where he is? Is that why you are hiding information from me?\u201dI looked at Eleris from behind Charlotte. I gave her a sign by slightly nodding my head.And, Eleris clearly understood what I meant.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c!\u201dCharlotte was so surprised, she froze up and just blankly stared ahead.* * *On the way back to Temple.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dCharlotte was walking as if her soul had been drained out of her body.\u201cLook where you walk. You might fall down.\u201d\u201cHuh, ah. Yes\u2026.\u201dEventually, Charlotte collapsed onto a nearby bench after we left the shopping district, saying that she felt too exhausted to walk any further.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dCharlotte sobbed quietly, covering her face with her hands. People would do these things, no matter if they were happy or sad.Charlotte was crying out of happiness.\u2018Yes, I\u2019m protecting the boy.\u2019\u2018I already know from what the kid told me that Your Highness does not intend to harm him.\u2019\u2018But there are just too many people after him.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t tell you the truth. Please forgive me for this.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m telling you this because Your Highness said that you\u2019d use all powers available to you to find out everything, no matter what.\u2019\u2018He is doing well. I think it would be better for Your Highness to not know where he is located or what he is doing at the moment.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m a wizard. Although I\u2019m not the strongest, I\u2019m good enough to protect him. It may be difficult for you to believe in me, but I hope you\u2019ll find it in your heart to place some of your trust in me.\u2019In the end, Charlotte saw my conjecture become true right in front of her eyes.After being frozen for some time, Charlotte\u2019s knees buckled and she sat down where she was, seeming like she was about to collapse. Then she cried until she was out of breath. In order to protect Eleris, I had her expose this much.Charlotte was protecting me for being her only connection to Valier.Therefore, she would also protect Eleris, who was protecting Valier.\u201cHe\u2019s okay\u2026. He\u2019s safe, so everything is okay\u2026. He\u2019s fine\u2026.\u201dAlthough she wasn\u2019t able to see him directly, she did find someone who said she was taking care and protecting Valier. Charlotte was so moved by her findings.\u2018It seems that it\u2019s possible to exchange information through a more inconspicuous method. Through letters, for example.\u2019\u2018However, meeting in person is too dangerous for me and the boy. So, I think it would be better if you send someone else to send and receive information.\u2019Eleris was going far beyond what I signed her to do.\u2018For example, this boy who came with you today\u2026.\u201dEleris even created an excuse for me to visit her store as Reinhardt.We didn\u2019t know what this revelation of some of the truth would lead to in the future, but if we had stayed still, the fact that Eleris was a vampire would have come to light.It might not be ideal, but that was the best I could think of at that moment.Still, Charlotte learned that the boy was safe, and although she wasn\u2019t able to meet him, she was able to send him letters as well as receive some from him.After regaining her composure, Charlotte looked at me and took a deep breath.\u201cThis must never reach Bertus\u2019 ears.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dWhat she meant to tell me was that I had to watch my mouth, as well as that this couldn\u2019t reach Bertus any other way either.My absurd speculation was nothing more than just that. The reason Eleris suddenly decided to open her mouth was because I ordered her to. Charlotte might find it strange that Eleris\u2019 revelation came so suddenly, even though she was so adamant before.However, she wasn\u2019t able to deny that she was able to find the boy because of me, so after some time Charlotte turned to me.\u201cThanks, Reinhardt.\u201dCharlotte carefully grabbed my hand as she thanked me.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dI couldn\u2019t bear to meet Charlotte\u2019s gaze. She was smiling. Her smile even reached her eyes. Her hands were a bit cold though.\u201cLet\u2019s get going. It\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOf course, this wasn\u2019t the end.Charlotte would now do everything to protect Eleris.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87We were inside the mana train to go back to Temple. Since it was night already, there weren\u2019t many people on the train.Charlotte seemed to calmly organize her thoughts, trying to calm her beating heart.\u201cAnyway, what is that store\u2019s true purpose?\u201dShe was so surprised that Eleris knew the boy\u2019s whereabouts that she forgot that line of thought. It looked like she successfully managed to organize her thoughts.\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know much about this topic, but don\u2019t wizards usually have a lot of secrets?\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 It\u2019s hard to accept, though. Wizards are usually pretty much weirdos, but\u2026.\u201dAmong wizards, being weird was rather common. Even if harmless, there are a lot of people with strange personalities among them.So, even if one didn\u2019t really understand why they did certain things, since there were a lot of weirdos among the wizards, there might not even be a reason for them to do something as nonsensical as that.\u201cI should think more about this after I fully confirm that she is indeed protecting him.\u201dIt was still just an oral testimony. No matter if she could send letters or not, as long as she was sure that Eleris was protecting the boy, Charlotte would do her best to protect her.In Charlotte\u2019s current state, as long as Valier\u2019s safety was confirmed, she would be able to let this matter go, even if she found out that Eleris was a vampire.\u201cI hope she isn\u2019t some member of a magic association\u2026.\u201d\u201cMagic association?\u201dCharlotte let out a mournful voice and tilted her head.\u201cSigh\u2026. There are organizations that focus on magic research. They often try to evade the public\u2019s eye.\u201dOf course, I knew these things. Secret magic associations. It sounded pretty chuuni and I took a liking to it, so I just shoved it into the novel.Underground magic organizations focusing on magic research and experimentation, or simply advocating the freedom of advancing in the field of magic. There weren\u2019t just one or two of these associations, and their tendencies were widely different. Some were conducting experiments going against any moral code in existence, while others were moving to prevent threats caused by magic from the shadows.As for Charlotte, she still seemed to have some doubts about Eleris, wondering if she was actually part of one of these organizations.It was a lot tamer than wondering whether she was a demon spy or not.\u201cBut looking at how she\u2019s running the store\u2026. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be part of something like the Black Order\u2026.\u201dCuriosity is like a disease.That would probably fit Charlotte to a T at this moment.* * *It had been a long day.Running around different places and leaving Temple even though it was prohibited. Charlotte found Eleris through simple interrogation. It was truly thrilling to see how she reached the truth by taking such simple actions.Just randomly asking the shop owners about a boy that was trying to sell scrolls led to the creation of a clear movement pattern, and finally setting her sights on Eleris\u2019 shop simply because it was slightly suspicious.After walking a few more laps outside, we decided to return to Temple. I didn\u2019t actually do any evening training after all.It didn\u2019t seem like Bertus had tracked Charlotte and me, so he shouldn\u2019t know where we went.To be honest, Bertus probably didn\u2019t have any time to care about me and Charlotte. It turned out that his people were behind the black market, so he probably had to focus on solving this incident amicably. His head was probably about to explode.Anyway, Sarkegaar\u2019s trail shouldn\u2019t get exposed.As soon as I returned to the Royal Class dormitory after exercising, there was a single person waiting for me.\u201c\u2026Where have you been all day?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been training.\u201dHarriet de Saint-Owan.She looked a bit annoyed for having to wait quite a long time for me.I hadn\u2019t really thought about that \u201cpreventing Harriet\u2019s leave of absence\u201d matter, because I was following around Charlotte all day.\u201cHow did it go?\u201dWell, if the matter got resolved, she probably wouldn\u2019t want to meet me. Why was she waiting for me like this?There was also Betus who objected to her leave of absence, so it should have been resolved well. Harriet was just\u2026 crossing her arms and not saying anything.\u201cWhat? Are you actually going to take the semester off?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, that\u2019s not it. They told me I don\u2019t have to take a leave of absence. They can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s something Bertus requested after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, isn\u2019t everything well?\u201dThat was what she wanted, so she could have just told me directly. Why did she seem so restless?\u201cWhat? Are there any problems? If there are, out with it already. I\u2019m losing it here.\u201dWhen I put my hand next to my ear, Harriet\u2019s expression changed subtly.I felt something very ominous about the way she acted.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 My father wants to meet you.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dWhat kind of nonsense was that?Harriet was just a kid, but Grand Duke Saint-Owan wasn\u2019t someone I could handle at my current level, you know?\u201cNo, why is your high and mighty father looking for me?\u201dHarriet\u2019s eyebrows twitched a little at my remark, but it seemed like she gave up getting angry over every little thing I did.Rather, Harriet fidgeted around with her fingers. It was incredibly cute how she looked at me with upturned eyes.But why was she looking at me like that?\u201cI-It\u2019s just\u2026. He didn\u2019t believe his daughter would come up with something like this. So\u2026 after I told him what you told me to say, that I can\u2019t take a leave of absence because of this and that,\u2026 he asked me\u2026 who came up with this,\u2026 so\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dNo matter how talented and smart she might be, Harriet was still just the cute little daughter of the Grand Duke of Saint-Owan.She probably only said cute things like \u201cI love you forever, dad! Dad is the best! I wooove you!\u201d to him. Well, she was set up as a character that grew up being loved by her entire family.So she probably was the world\u2019s nicest, cutest, and most adorable daughter to him. She probably was the kind of girl that would only say things like \u201cI hate you\u201d as a form of rebellion.Something like \u201cBuy me that! No, I hate that!\u201dThen his little girl suddenly started saying things like: \u2018Father, I believe that it would seriously offend Prince Bertus if I were to take a leave of absence. The Prince even talked to me directly about this matter, requesting me not to take the semester off. If I were to be forced to go against his wishes, I fear for my family\u2019s safety\u2026\u2019From Grand Duke Saint-Owan\u2019s point of view, this had to be quite the bizarre situation.So naturally, he must have thought that she was saying something, someone told her to say or made her read from a script, because Harriet was doing something she had never done before. Actually, Harriet did say that she might forget what she had to say, so we did prepare something close to a script.\u201c\u2026Anyway, I told him it was me who wrote the script.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh god. He didn\u2019t believe you now, did he? You aren\u2019t someone that could talk like that.\u201dEven if she had a good head on her shoulders, she was still too young, so no one would believe bullshit like that.The child who wasn\u2019t able to even put her opinions into logical sentences suddenly matured, so he thought that there was some force (?) pulling the strings from behind, and that was the correct answer.So, for some reason, the Grand Duke now wished to see me. Harriet eventually couldn\u2019t resist her dad\u2019s coercion, so she mentioned me to him. That\u2019s why she seemed so apologetic.You little brat, that was why you\u2019ve been waiting for me until this late at night, looking all fidgety?\u201cIt\u2019s fine, what happened, happened. So, how did you introduce me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dHarriet looked into my eyes again, unable to properly open her mouth.\u201cSurely, you didn\u2019t say something like I\u2019m a beggar with a very dirty personality that beats up people left and right, right?\u201d\u201c!\u201dHarriet\u2019s complexion grew paler. It seemed like that was the correct answer.\u201cCome here, you little punk. Seems like you really want to get beaten up.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sooorry!\u201dAs I slowly approached, Harriet wept bitterly while retreating. So the day came when this brat actually let the words \u2018I\u2019m\u2019 and \u2018sorry\u2019 leave her mouth, huh?\u201cI\u2019m really surprised that you actually apologized, but you threw me into some deep shit right now, so I\u2019m going to hit you even more now, you know?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it!\u201dEven if she was acting cute, it won\u2019t help that punk in the least right now.\u201cCome here, let me give you a finger flick.\u201d-Tack!\u201cOuch! Y-You\u2026 really hit me! You actually hit me!\u201d\u201cDid you think I\u2019d fake it?\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe it\u2026 How preposterous\u2026 You really hit me\u2026.\u201dHarriet looked at me with a bewildered expression plastered on her face, rubbing her forehead. It seemed like her last doubts about my willingness to hit her had finally crumbled.\u2018H-How dare you? You didn\u2019t just say you\u2019d flick my forehead? You actually did it!\u2019That was what kind of expression she was showing me.Also, she really was the cutest.\u201cWelp. I\u2019ll keep it at that for now.\u201dHer face reddened again at my words.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that look? You hit me! You bad guy! You bastard!\u201dHarriet eventually ran back to her room, huffing angrily.* * *Wednesday, the next day.I had magic sensitivity training and supernatural power classes on that day. The magic sensitivity training was filled with only the first-years of the Royal Class.Students majoring in divine powers and supernatural powers didn\u2019t usually have to take these classes.Of course, I majored in supernatural powers, but I was still taking this class. I planned on sitting through it later.As magic had its own uses different from supernatural powers.-Uaaaaaah\u2026. Feeeeeel iiiiiiiiiit\u2026.This class had a teacher that was more like a yoga instructor who made all the students lay down and mumbled some suggestions to them. When I listened to him, I felt somewhat strange and fell asleep. Weren\u2019t we actually getting hypnotized by this yoga master?Of course, I never mentioned anything about falling asleep, but every time I woke up I felt really refreshed, so I actually liked that class. Actually, the only thing I had to do in that class was standing up on time after being idle all throughout it.-Feeeel the universe\u2026. Receeeeive\u2026 its streeeeength\u2026.Woah.It was coming.The god of sleep\u2026.When I woke up from my slumber, everyone had serene expressions on their faces. It felt weird. If I had to describe it, it felt like waking up after being dead for a bit.By the way, was that Yoga Master dude actually a wizard? He looked more like a swordsman than a wizard at first glance, though.\u201cThere will be a midterm evaluation next week.\u201dAt those words, all the kids were rather dumbfounded. I was also confused.Of course, the exam period which would be corresponding to the midterm exams would start next week according to the schedule.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve learned anything though, so how will we get evaluated?\u201dCayer Vioden from Class A posed the question that everyone seemed to have.How could one evaluate a class in which one only slept? What did he even teach us?\u201cThis course won\u2019t have any exams. We are just checking your performance up to this point.\u201d\u201cPerformance?\u201dEveryone was almost shouting these words. I could understand that we weren\u2019t taking any exams in this class, but what the hell did performance mean? We were never taught anything, but we somehow were supposed to achieve something? That was what everyone seemed to want to say.\u201cI will check if your magic power has increased. You will be given points the more it has increased, understood?\u201dMagic power increases. That was the measure of our evaluation.\u201cAs you all should know, during this class, you have been continuously trained to increase your magic power as well as your sensitivity to it. Of course, we should use your magic power increase as the evaluation criterion.\u201dWe weren\u2019t just sleeping.We were somehow still training while sleeping.Actually, I didn\u2019t really know why, but the amount of my mana had continuously increased regardless of what I trained in. I started with 9.9, but now it has risen to 11.It didn\u2019t just randomly rise, the class was helping us increase our magic power.\u201cNow then, I hope you\u2019ll have a magical time until next week.\u201dEveryone was just staring blankly at him, as if they just realized how great this yoga master in front of them was.* * *I could now properly participate in the supernatural power control training as well. The power of my supernatural power was more on the lower side, but the speed at which I could activate my supernatural power could not be replicated by almost anyone in the class.Of course, there was just one other person who had an even faster activation speed than me. I still needed time to convince myself, after all. However, that person could use their power as soon as they thought about it.That was Kono Lint\u2019s teleportation. Of course, it was still rather useless, because he\u2019d be naked the moment he used it. He really was a poor guy in that regard.Anyway, next in line would be Liana de Grantz.As the King of the winning mentality, that was just too much.\u201cIt\u2019s all good, but it\u2019s just very subtle, to the point where one can\u2019t tell if you became stronger because you are using your supernatural ability or because you\u2019ve been training hard. I heard you\u2019ve been working yourself quite hard.\u201dDuring my training, my teacher didn\u2019t seem to be able to tell if I was properly using my supernatural power or not.Of course, that didn\u2019t really matter much to me, because I could clearly figure out whether my power was activated or not.I could even feel that the power was developing to some extent.But in the end, it was still that kind of supernatural power\u2026.This type of ability was like a chuuni\u2019s dream. An ability that developed when one was under extreme psychological pressure. Actually, I already knew that it would be like that.The power\u2019s development wasn\u2019t that apparent. Then in a crisis it would suddenly evolve and destroy everything around me\u2026. Something like that\u2026.Anyway, it seemed pretty cool and convenient, so that was why I put in that setting. However, I was now feeling the pain, because I was now in a position where I had to practice such a ridiculous power.In the end, it was more efficient to just get pushed into an extremely dangerous situation to quickly raise it instead of doing this.That said, I didn\u2019t really want to do something as stupid as actively seeking out dangerous situations, either\u2026.-Prrrzt! Brzzzzzt!\u201cOh, Grantz. Your control has definitely improved. Your output has also gotten stronger.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLiana de Grantz. She was a perfect example of a genius supernatural power user.It sure would have been nice if I was someone like that as well, whose ability grows quickly even if I just stand still. Of course, it wasn\u2019t like its growth rate was especially slow, I\u2019d say.In the end, it was my fault for setting up the condition of having to be in a crisis to level it up after all.* * *There was someone among the supernatural ability class students whose expression grew worse and worse every time he saw me showing off the use of my supernatural power.A-6 Heinrich von Schwarz.I gave him some true education after he questioned my presence in this class when I didn\u2019t even have a supernatural power. Now I could see the guy, who wanted me to get a talent the least, freak out over me actually awakening a supernatural power.Of course, after he found out that I was quite similar to a mad dog, he didn\u2019t openly argue with me again.\u201cTch.\u201dHowever, every time he saw me, he would turn away his head in disgust.Harriet was cute, but that guy wasn\u2019t cute at all. I didn\u2019t really intend to play around with him, so I just let him be.On my way back from class, my eyes met with Charlotte\u2019s, who came out of her private room.She and I shared a lot of secrets with each other, so it was dangerous if we acted like we knew each other in the open.I didn\u2019t really greet her, but Charlotte looked at me and slightly smiled instead.Unlike before, Charlotte seemed to be in a good mood. It looked like she was finally relieved of a heavy burden that weighed her down.The other guys thought Charlotte was smiling at me, so they seemed a little dumbfounded.Hmm.Come to think of it, I had to go to Eleris\u2019 store to pick up some letters.Of course, I\u2019d only pretend that I went there to pick them up. I\u2019d actually had to write them myself.* * *I decided that I\u2019d go pick up the letters after the ban on leaving the campus of Temple had been lifted. It was impossible for me to leave without Charlotte, and it would be highly suspicious for us to go out together again.So, I was back training my swordsmanship with Ellen. Ellen didn\u2019t really seem to care whether I came by or not. When I was around, she\u2019d look after my sword training, and when I wasn\u2019t there, she\u2019d do her own thing.\u201cDon\u2019t you need to study for the midterm exams?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dNext week, we\u2019d have to take the integrated midterm exams and do our given midterm assignments for each lecture. I didn\u2019t pay that much attention to it, but everyone was studying on their own during the midterm exam period.It was more than obvious that Bertus and Charlotte were still studying even while they were busy with many other things.Ellen, on the other hand, was still acting the same as before.\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you lucky that you actually still get to be the top student of the whole school while acting like that?\u201d\u201c?\u201dI\u2019m 100 % sure that I set her up as a character like that. If it was just brains, then B-2 Louis Ankton would be more superior. However, since that guy was a weakass, he wasn\u2019t able to get any good grades in sports-related subjects. So, Louis Ankton would only rank first for the integrated subjects, that is, written exams, while Ellen would always rank first going by total score, including the grades given by the subjects of individual professors.Even though I had no intentions on studying a single bit, I still felt weird talking so casually to the person who would snatch the school\u2019s number 1 rank like nothing.Didn\u2019t I have to study?Why?No, I think it would feel a bit degrading to realize how much worse my brain would be compared to these kids.Ellen looked at me standing still and shook her head slightly.\u201cAren\u2019t you studying?\u201dOf course, she was simply asking.But what I heard was: \u201cYou\u2019re not as smart as me, so don\u2019t you have to study really hard?\u201dThat was what that sounded like.That made me angry for some reason.\u201cSince you don\u2019t need to study, I don\u2019t either!\u201d\u201cHow does that correlate?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! Anyway, I won\u2019t do it!\u201dI went into crazy mode.Grades?Let us happily throw them out the window.The moment the Gates open, Temple grades and such would become completely useless after all.I just had to study hard in my own way!-ClackThen the gym door opened suddenly and someone came in.\u201cNumber 11, you have a visitation request.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dIt was Mr. Epinhauser.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88I already knew who came to see me.Harriet\u2019s father, Grand Duke Saint-Owan.Was that gentleman so impatient as to come to Temple immediately the next day?Mr. Epinhauser said that I could decide whether I agreed to meet that person or not, as they weren\u2019t my parents, but I wasn\u2019t someone brave enough to actually refuse to meet someone like the Grand Duke.I\u2019m weak against the strong, after all.I went to the main lobby of Temple\u2019s Royal Class\u2019 dormitory. Mr. Epinhauser took me to a visitation room and disappeared. He said that this was a visitation room, but it was completely unlike what I knew from my time in the army. It was just a colorful reception room.\u201cAre you Reinhardt?\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dHe was a middle-aged gentleman wearing a black suit, a black fedora, a gray cane, and a stylish beard. Rather than a wizard, he just looked like an ordinary, neat aristocrat.\u201cIt is an honor to meet you, Grand Duke.\u201dI didn\u2019t know the proper etiquette used for greeting nobles, so I just went with that.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI sat across from the Grand Duke. He didn\u2019t even have to make a single gesture for a tea cup to float towards me, and it was slowly filling up with black tea as well.No matter how I looked at it, magic sure was convenient.He didn\u2019t say anything else to me, so I was just sitting there while he stared at me. Was he thinking that he was gracious enough to even let me sit across from him like that?\u201cI heard it was you who instructed Harriet. Is that correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe was blunt and came right to the point. It was rather rude, but it was a good thing for me.Because he was such a powerful person, I didn\u2019t want to deal with him for an extended amount of time. He was rather dry but not overly aggressive.I thought he\u2019d absolutely hate me, but he didn\u2019t show any signs of that. Till now, that is.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cShe said that she didn\u2019t want to take a leave of absence, so I just gave her my opinion on what would be the best course of action to take to achieve just that.\u201d\u201cHarriet asked you to help her herself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOf course, I did tell Harriet that I didn\u2019t want her to take a leave of absence either, but in the end, it was her who asked me how she would be able to avoid taking one, so I didn\u2019t lie.\u201cHmm\u2026 I see. This case has been concluded without any further damage as well, so it wouldn\u2019t be harmful to keep Harriet in Temple, is what I\u2019m thinking.\u201dThere was Bertus\u2019 request as well, so this couldn\u2019t be easily ignored. Grand Duke Saint-Owan seemed to have given up on forcing Harriet to take a leave of absence.But why did he want to see me? Was he just curious about the person\u2019s identity who dared to manipulate his daughter?\u201cBut Harriet wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201dAt my question, the Grand Duke just looked at me.\u201cHarriet would never ask a child of such a lowly background like you for their opinion.\u201dGrand Duke Saint-Owan stared at me after he finished what he wanted to say.Why was he acting up all of a sudden?\u201cThat might be true, but she did ask me.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Reinhardt, I\u2019m not trying to insult you for your humble origins.\u201dGrand Duke Saint-Owan placed his cane on his thighs and clasped both of his hands.\u201cHarriet wouldn\u2019t want to talk to someone of a humble background. So, of course, Harriet wouldn\u2019t have wanted to speak to you, based on your origins\u2026 Alas\u2026 She actually asked for your advice, and even accepted it.\u201dHarriet was someone that didn\u2019t want to mingle with commoners, because she thought they were dirty. She came to have such an opinion because she lived intoxicated by some sense of superiority she felt. So she tended to despise anyone that she didn\u2019t seem fit to be around her.\u201cSo, does Harriet like you or something? Or do you like her?\u201d\u201cI-I don\u2019t know about her, but that wouldn\u2019t be the case for me!\u201dWhat was he doing now?!\u201cYou don\u2019t like her? How does that make sense? Do you perhaps have some problems with your eyesight\u2026?\u201d\u2018How could you not take a liking to my daughter!\u2019, that was how the Grand Duke was looking at me. He sure was startled.What was with that guy\u2019s sudden change?He was just someone completely crazy for his daughter, after all!.And then-Bang!\u201cD-Dad! W-What are you talking abooooout!\u201dHarriet, whose face was tomato red, barged into the reception room.Having obviously eavesdropped from outside, her face was completely shriveled up. She then pointed towards the door.\u201cG-Get out! You, get out! Wait there!\u201d\u201cWait! Wait just a moment! Please wait, Reinhardt! Let\u2019s talk more!\u201d\u201cY-You\u2019re loud! Dad, please be quiet!\u201dI left the reception room, leaving behind the Grand Duke, the continent\u2019s strongest wizard, and his daughter.-I\u2019m so embarrassed! Why did you have to come here?! Why did you ask him that?!-N-No\u2026 Sweetie. What I meant was\u2026-I don\u2019t care! Get out! Don\u2019t stay here any longer! I told you not to come!-I just wanted to know who you like as your father\u2026!-Aaaaaaaah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Don\u2019t say anything anymore! Just don\u2019t! Ah! Ah!I could hear Harriet\u2019s screaming from inside the room and Grand Duke Saint-Owan just stuttering, not knowing what to do.\u2026I was quite the fool worrying about getting harmed, I guess.She grew up under such a father, so it was no wonder that she turned out the way she did.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d-I hate you, dad! I absolutely hate you! You\u2019re so annoying!-N-No! I just did this all for your\u2026!-I don\u2019t caaaaare!Like that, I also got to know how Harriet was usually talking with her father.If she was behaving like that, it was quite obvious that she read from a script, huh?I didn\u2019t want to be involved with either of these two anymore, so I ran away.Fortunately, the Grand Duke didn\u2019t look for me afterward, thanks to Harriet\u2019s admonishment.* * *Of course, I wasn\u2019t actually sure if Harriet kicked out the Grand Duke or not, but after some time, she came knocking on my door, her face completely red.\u201cI-It wasn\u2019t me! You know, right?\u201dAs soon as she saw me, she shouted that.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cDad misunderstood!\u201dI believed she was talking about the thing her father asked me. Whether I liked her or not. That was why her face was so red, and she was all fidgety.It made me want to tease her even more, you know?\u201cHuh\u2026? You don\u2019t like me?\u201d\u201cWha, what?!\u201dWhen I threw a fastball, that girl\u2019s face went even redder.\u201cI-I! W-Why would I like you\u2026? I don\u2019t even like your looks! D-Don\u2019t talk any nonsense! Why would I like a lowly beggar like you? Don\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201dHarriet was stomping her feet as if she didn\u2019t even want to imagine something like that.\u201cOr not. Why are you getting so angry? You seem like a person that\u2019s about to stab someone.\u201dAfter I said that, I closed the door with a smile.-Hey! Hey! Reinhardt! Open the door!-Clang, Clang, Clang, Clang!-I won\u2019t stab you! I really won\u2019t stab you! Open the door, you jerk!No way.I didn\u2019t open the door, fearing for my own life.* * *After Harriet went away, exhausted from her rampaging, I sat down in front of my desk.I currently had 6130 achievement points. If I made one more talent bloom I would have 4000 points remaining. If my assumption that the points required to get talents doubled every time I bought one was right, then I had enough to add 2 more talents at the moment.However, going by my past experiences, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to leave some points in case of an emergency. If I used the Revise function in such cases, I might get myself out of a crisis. Spending too much at the moment, seemed to be a bad choice.After thinking about what kind of talent I should develop next, I narrowed it down.This decision would also decide my future path.[Magic Sensitivity \u2013 2000 Points][Magic Manipulation \u2013 2000 Points]These two talents were required to become a master in the field of combat, and were also necessary talents for a wizard.They were the basis for everything having to do with magic power.In the wizard\u2019s case, they were necessary to evoke magic and move magic power, and in the case of combat masters, they were necessary to strengthen their body using magic power.Anyway, both were talents with multiple uses, so it would be far better to have them than not. Since I had Ellen training me in swordsmanship, I didn\u2019t think it was necessary for me to buy a talent in that area.Both were necessary talents, but I needed Magic Sensitivity first. It was a type of talent that contributed to the growth of one\u2019s magic power, and at my current level, it was more important to increase my magic power pool than being able to manipulate it.[You have spent 2000 Achievement Points.]With that, I had two talents.Self-Suggestion and Magic Sensitivity.My remaining points were 4130. As I expected, it would take me 4000 points to get my third talent.I refrained from hastily spending my remaining points. In the first place, Magic Manipulation wasn\u2019t something that they taught yet, so acquiring it beforehand would be useless.I decided to postpone the decision whether I should get a third talent or not until after the midterm exams.Of course, I had no reason at all to do well in the exams.However, there was no reason for me to get bad results in most classes either.If I really were to focus on the midterm exams, I\u2019d only do so for achievement points, not to get good grades.[Reach the Top 10 in the midterm exams \u2013 3000 Points]The challenge related to the midterm exams that I saw when I last checked was still there. This wasn\u2019t talking about just within my class, no, it meant that I had to reach the Top 10 of the whole first grade of Temple\u2019s high school section, which had about 10.000 students. Even if I was smarter than most of the kids, this was obviously something very difficult to do.In addition, two more midterm exam related challenges had been added after the challenges were updated.[Cheat during the midterm exams and get caught \u2013 500 Points][Get the lowest rank in the midterm exam \u2013 1000 Points]\u201c\u2026\u201dIf I were to rank last among 10.000 people, I\u2019d get a thousand points.I\u2019d automatically get the lowest rank after I got caught cheating, so I\u2019d get 1.500 Points.Both were very easy to do. If I were to purposely try to get 0 points, there was literally nothing that could go wrong. It was overwhelmingly easier than getting into the Top 10.That punk was doing this on purpose, wasn\u2019t he?I\u2019ll show you.I\u2019ll get to 10th place.* * *That evening. In the dining room.My evening training had ended, but I was still eating some late-night snacks with Ellen as always.Today\u2019s menu was fried rice.Ellen made it.Kids like her were supposed to be good at cooking after all, right? She didn\u2019t even need my advice anymore and can pretty much make everything on her own, right?After some time, my cooking won\u2019t even be able to compare to hers anymore, right?\u201c\u2026You said, you wouldn\u2019t study.\u201d\u201cThere are some things people just ought to do.\u201dWhen I told her that I would study until the midterm exams and would take a break from training, Ellen just nodded while shoving some fried rice into her mouth. My goal was to get into the Top 10 of the integrated exams. The individual professor\u2019s subjects didn\u2019t count to that particular ranking.So, the only things I needed to study were what we learned during the common classes.\u201cI think you\u2019ll do well in your studies.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s with that so suddenly?\u201dDid she just give me a compliment without a shred of hesitation? That caught me off guard.Then Ellen told me calmly something pretty surprising.\u201cYes, you are smart.\u201dI really didn\u2019t know what was going through that girl\u2019s head. What was with this? Of course, I might think that way because of the words she was usually using with me.\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you.\u201dWell, yeah. It did feel pretty good.I also felt like I already lost after getting happy by being praised by a high schooler for being smart.Also, she was probably a lot smarter than me as well.\u201cHey, would you like studying with me then?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dOf course, Ellen would refuse my request of mooching off her intelligence.Anyway, I had a new short-term goal.Cramming, that is.Even if they were just first year high school students, was it even possible for me to beat 10.000 students and make it to the Top 10?I\u2019d see the answer to that question next Monday and Thursday during our common classes. The other professor\u2019s classes would also hold their midterm evaluation next week, but I didn\u2019t pay that much attention to those.I could study on my own, and was pretty confident that I would reach a high rank. However, I had to get the best results, not just pretty good ones.How did the midterm exams go in the original again?It was one of the parts that were supposed to showcase Ludwig\u2019s tremendous improvement.Wasn\u2019t there that common old-fashioned main character trope? The energetic protagonist with a strong sense of justice, who was pretty much an idiot.So even though Ludwig studied really hard, he would still end up at the bottom of the rankings. Of course, after he studied together with a certain guy named Louis Ankton of Class B, his grades gradually improved.As far as brains goes, Louis Ankton was the smartest one of the Royal Class\u2019 first years.Of course, that guy was highly selfish on Top of being a nerd. He also was someone quick to run away. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy, but he was the type of guy I would have loved to give 100 finger flicks to, because he was just so annoying. In fact, it was probably that same Louis Ankton who went to tattle to the teacher about Cayer\u2019s and my fight in the changing room on my first day in Temple.Only after Ludwig helped and took care of that guy would he open his heart to others and help out. It should have been right when they got into 2nd grade.Ellen had no intention of studying at all, while I was trying my hardest to get myself to rank 10 if possible.That was the conclusion.* * *\u201cHey.\u201dThursday evening.\u201cHuh?\u2026Uhm? Me?\u201dI called out to Louis Ankton, who was on his way back after the common classes.\u201cWho else is there other than you, huh?\u201dI approached Louis, who was shivering out of some form of fear, and placed my arm on his shoulder.\u201cI have a question for you.\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 Huuh? W-What do you want to ask?\u201dIf I were to study with that punk, my chances of getting into the Top 10 would be very high. The fact that I, who was pretty much infamous among the first years, spoke to him made Louis\u2019 complexion grow very pale.\u201cHey, am I hitting you? Why are you acting like that?\u201dAs I laughed loudly, his complexion grew even paler.The delinquent route was actually surprisingly good.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89In the original novel, Louis Ankton openly ignored Ludwig for his stupidity and he looked down on anyone who wasn\u2019t smarter than him. Even in Class B, that got along well with each other, he was an outsider. He looked down on everyone in class as lowly humans with no influence, and lived intoxicated in his belief to be intellectually superior.So, after receiving some true education a few times, he would later turn into someone open-minded who cared for his fellow classmates.That was Louis Ankton, the annoying guy.\u201cW-Why are you in our dorm\u2026?\u201dHowever, notoriety was also a type of fame, right?Louis knew that I was quite crazy, so he just crawled before me.I entered Class B\u2019s dormitory with Louis Ankton, who just came back from his classes, with my arm forcibly placed around his shoulders.That was actually my first time entering Class B\u2019s dormitory. Of course, there were quite a few instances of me running into students from Class B during classes, but I never held much of a conversation with any of them.Charlotte, Ludwig and Scarlett.These were the only people I knew there.When Reinhardt, the first year\u2019s super villain, suddenly appeared here, people felt like they were about to get swept away as soon as they made eye contact with me. I was even dragging around Louis Ankton like a prisoner.\u201cOh, Reinhardt? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dCharlotte smiled when I ran into her in the hallway. It seemed like she didn\u2019t find it strange for me to be here.My heart tightened as she smiled at me. On one hand I felt guilty and on the other I felt quite happy as it seemed that we finally managed to get along. It was complicated.\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to study.\u201d\u201cAah\u2026. With Ankton?\u201d\u201cYeah. I heard he\u2019s smart. Right?\u201dSo she thought I came with him. That was why she smiled.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dCharlotte nodded her head and moved her gaze to Louis Ankton.\u201cWould you mind, if I joined you?\u201dI had to get some good grades in the coming exams, but so did Charlotte. When I said that I was going to study with that guy, she seemed to want to come along.If this were the original, he would have said something rude like \u201cWhy should I help you with something like that?\u201d and coolly passed by us.However, these developments were quite different from the original.Super Villain Reinhardt and the Princess were standing before Louis Ankton and asking him to study together.\u201cHuh, no. Not at all!\u201dI didn\u2019t know what he was thinking on the inside, but that was the answer he gave us.On top of that, something that I didn\u2019t expect happened.\u201cHuh? Reinhardt? Why are you in our dorm?\u201dLudwig, the empty head, appeared.\u201cOh, Ludwig. We are going to study together. How about you come along?\u201dAnd then the cute, pretty, lovely and kind Princess\u2019 proposal reached our ears.\u201cSure!\u201dNo!That guy\u2019s a black hole!* * *Ludwig was unable to study, that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t, though. He studied hard because he was a very hardworking person. However, his grades were still disastrous.My original plan was to get private tutoring from Louis Ankton. However, I was fine with having Charlotte around. She was smart.\u201cUhmmm\u2026.\u201d\u201cUrgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cAah\u2026.\u201dHowever, all my plans were thwarted by that destructive idiot, Ludwig.We were now sitting around a table in Class B\u2019s common reading room with textbooks piled up next to us.\u201cAh\u2026. That. Ludwig.\u201d\u201cOh, Charlotte. I\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201cSo. Going by the context, you can see that the speaker is denying his or her own fault, right?\u201dWhile solving some literary problems, Ludwig asked if we could explain that part to him, saying that he didn\u2019t understand it.\u201cThat. I don\u2019t know what you mean with denial. They said that they were wrong, right?\u201d\u201cRight. That\u2019s what they say, but they\u2019re trying to change the subject, saying it was actually someone else\u2019s fault, right?\u201d\u201cUhmm\u2026. Is that so? Even though they said that they were wrong\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, no. So you see\u2026.\u201dThat void headed idiot was bad in all subjects, but he was worst in literature. He was unable to read between the lines and could follow context even less. He was a madman who just read a single line and only continued reading after he supposedly solved a problem.Charlotte was patiently trying to teach Ludwig little by little, while Louis just watched them mouth agape.How could such an idiot even exist?That was what his expression seemed to say.\u201cNo, you gorilla. How can you pretend not to know that, huh? What do I even need to explain?! How the hell did you even learn how to write with that shit brain of yours?\u201dIn the end, when I actually said something, Ludwig just shook his head and laughed.\u201cSorry, seems like I can\u2019t study that well\u2026.\u201d\u201cReinhardt! Don\u2019t be too harsh.\u201dCharlotte looked at me with her brows slightly furrowed, asking me why I was talking so harshly to him. I didn\u2019t want to go against Charlotte, so I tried to calm my anger and just remained quiet.Wow.So that was what my main character was like.This was all my fault, everything.Anyway, with the appearance of that black hole called Ludwig, we were not just studying, we were working on a miraculous salvation project out of nowhere.\u201cNow, what is the name of the largest and first vassal state in the southern part of the Empire?\u201dLudwig\u2019s expression seriously hardened at Charlotte\u2019s cheerfully conveyed question.\u201cKe\u2026. Ke something. Kern? Kernheight?\u201d\u201cKernstadt! It\u2019s Kernstadt, you idiot! How can you get the same question wrong 10 times in a row?! Huh? Even 10-year-olds know this! It\u2019s so easy that it probably won\u2019t even appear in a test! You can\u2019t even memorize that?!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t me this time, but Louis Ankton who jumped up with zeal. Louis, who had begun to go beyond simple astonishment to straight up disgust, jumped up in fury, however when he saw Charlotte and me looking at him he paled and slowly sat back down.He did mock some kids, but he wasn\u2019t someone that was easily angered, however he got so angry at that moment that he completely forgot us two and jumped up.Charlotte didn\u2019t say anything to Louis, seeming to understand what he was feeling at the moment.However, Charlotte only looked a little sad and carefully placed her hand on Ludwig\u2019s shoulder.\u201cLudwig\u2026. When I was young, I had a very serious head injury. Has anything like that ever happened to you?\u201dShe seemed to think that Ludwig was that way because of some type of injury or disease.Wow, the nicest person in this room actually said the worst thing.\u201cHuh? Nothing like that ever happened to me, though\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Huh?\u201dNothing like that ever happened to him, so why is he like that?Charlotte had her mouth slightly open. It seemed like she sincerely wanted to ask that question.\u201cAs I thought, the Empire should really start implementing a public education system\u2026.\u201dCharlotte, who expressed similar sentiments before, seemed to seriously contemplate the implementation of public education while staring blankly.Temple wasn\u2019t part of a public education system, but an elite system. And Ludwig somehow got into the high school department of Temple the same way I did.He did say that he never received proper education before.Neither of us were supposed to have any chance to get an education, and yet there were two dramatically different cases sitting at the same table, Ludwig and Reinhardt.It was no wonder that I got some strange looks.Charlotte began to talk to the innocent looking Ludwig with firm eyes.\u201cLudwig. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s the Empire\u2019s fault for not providing free basic education to its people. Yeah, you\u2019re not the problem.\u201dCharlotte, did she actually hate Ludwig?Her choice of words was the worst at the moment.\u201cR-Really? That\u2019s a relief then!\u201d\u201cYes! In the future, the average intellectual level of the common people must absolutely increase. There should never again be a case as sad as this!\u201d\u201cThank you, Charlotte!\u201dAs such chaos unfolded, in which Charlotte was shooting out one venomous remark after the other without actually realizing it, Ludwig actually thanked her for that. That moment was enough to showcase Ludwig\u2019s level of intelligence.I shouldn\u2019t get distracted by this.\u201cHey, what do you think would be good to study for this exam?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Huh?\u201d\u201cQuickly, tell me.\u201dIn that chaos, I somehow had to fulfill my original goal.* * *It was impossible to study quietly as I wanted because of that void headed idiot, Ludwig, but I at least succeeded in getting some exam question predictions from Louis Ankton.Evening.I casually ate in Class B\u2019s dining room.\u201cY-You\u2026. Aren\u2019t you supposed to eat with Class A?\u201dLouis Ankton asked me, while his eyes were questioning why I would even eat here.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any rule stating that, though?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like we weren\u2019t allowed to go in and out of each other\u2019s dorm, we just didn\u2019t. Everyone else was staring at me with strange expressions on their faces as I entered Class B\u2019s dining room and casually ate there.I really wanted to say something like \u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d, but I just decided to eat quietly, because I was afraid that I\u2019d hear something unpleasant from Charlotte.Charlotte was my suppressor.\u201cPhew. Thank you, everyone. This made me realize just how bad my brain actually was.\u201dLudwig smiled as he said so, while Louis and Charlotte\u2019s expressions became a sight to behold.\u201cThe fact that you realized how stupid you are is actually quite something already.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dLudwig only laughed after hearing my words, as if I praised him. The guy wouldn\u2019t get angry no matter what one said to him, after all. Was it because he was dumb that he didn\u2019t understand when someone was criticizing him?Still, I\u2019m pretty sure he was just a good-natured guy. There was this awkward atmosphere floating in the room because of my presence. As soon as I started to talk casually with Ludwig, everyone started to eat and talk loudly.Obviously, Class B had a completely different atmosphere than Class A. Everyone seemed to be friendly. Someone even suddenly began to play an instrument.It seemed to be an instrument similar to an ukulele.As if it was a common thing, everyone was just listening to the exciting and fast melody getting played while they were eating.\u201cThe performance is good, right?\u201dLudwig asked as if asking for my approval.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s good.\u201dAlthough, it made the dormitory suddenly seem like a medieval tavern.The one playing the ukulele or something similar was B-10 Lanion Sessor.His talent was music. He along with Delphine Izadra was one of Ludwig\u2019s best friends. The guy was the mood maker of Class B. He was someone who\u2019d play some kind of instrument at any time while he was at the dormitory, and if someone requested a song from him, he\u2019d practice it and tried his best to make his listeners happy.He seemed oddly useless, but without him, everyone in Class B would quickly get bored. So, that guy held a surprisingly important role.\u201cHow is it?\u201dCharlotte asked me again.\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201dI felt like I should hold a beer in my hand instead of this fork, faced with such an exciting performance.It was definitely much more exciting than Class A\u2019s dinners, where one could only hear the sounds of cutlery clinking on plates. Charlotte was still smiling at me.Putting everything aside, Charlotte apparently seemed to like the kids from Class B quite a bit.I felt like it was pretty good here as well.While listening to that rhythmical performance going dongdididang dongdududangdang\u2026I honestly\u2026Craved for a drink.Class B was seen as the inferior class, but everyone was having fun in there. It hit very differently seeing that with my own eyes.It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t like my life in Class A, but everyone was just focusing on improving themselves and training over and over. To be honest, Ellen did nothing but train, ignoring all the fun things this world had to offer.\u201cOne more time!\u201dLanion Sessor, drunk on his own performance, shouted for an encore himself.Watching that scene, I realized that I had long forgotten the concept of enjoying life.It was a night that made me want to go to sleep with no worries and no thoughts.* * *Even after dinner, I continued to study in Class B\u2019s reading room. Ludwig excused himself and went off to do strength training. It seemed like he felt really sorry about that. It really wasn\u2019t something he had to feel sorry about though. No, really.There were only three people left in the reading room: Me, Charlotte and Louis.Louis Ankton checked over the list of expected exam questions, and memorized them. To be honest, I didn\u2019t really need any help from these brainy people except for memorization.\u201cReinhardt. Just asking, but since when were you the type to care about grades?\u201dI was kind of caught off guard by Charlotte\u2019s question.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s no reason not to, right?\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t want to care about them, but I had to do this for achievement points. Charlotte seemed to think that it was very unexpected for me to even study for exams.\u201cHmm\u2026. I thought you\u2019d have more of a\u00a0\u201cWhy should I care?\u201d attitude about it.\u201dCharlotte smiled to herself.She was correct.She knew me so well!Charlotte was smart, and my brain wasn\u2019t that bad either, so, unlike when Ludwig was still around, we managed to get a lot of work done. I managed to answer almost all the problems I practiced.At this level, literature and mathematics weren\u2019t that difficult, and as my job required me to memorize a lot of things that that action almost became an occupational disease, I had no problem in that department either.I couldn\u2019t write while checking the story settings every few seconds after all, so I had to memorize huge chunks of the story.So, memorization was actually my forte.Louis Ankton was staring at me strangely.\u201c\u2026\u2026What? You got a problem?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah. No\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat are you so surprised about?\u201d\u201cNo, well\u2026. You actually were smart\u2026.\u201dHe must have thought that I was an idiot comparable to Ludwig due to my role as a bully, but as he continued to watch me, he seemed to realize that I was able to quickly memorize things and replicate them without hardly making any mistakes. That seemed to surprise him.\u201cJust what the hell did you think of me before?\u201dWhen I asked him that with a dangerous glint in my eyes, he audibly flinched.\u201cHah, no! That\u2019s not wh-what I meant\u2026.\u201d\u201cI knew you were smart, but I also didn\u2019t know that you were good at studying as well.\u201dCharlotte seemed to smile because she didn\u2019t expect me to do so well either. Both Ellen and Charlotte seemed to think that I was smart.Yes, of course, I had to be. That was only natural. If I was dumber than you guys, that would be rather shameful.However, actually, compared to these four people, Charlotte, Bertus, Louis, and Ellen, I really had a much worse brain.How shameful\u2026.Ellen in particular. I\u2019d lose against her in both studies and a fight.I was getting so tremendously overwhelmed in every aspect by a single high schooler.\u201cOh well. Let\u2019s just quickly move on. The exams are just around the corner.\u201dLet\u2019s just study.Following that, after all our classes were over, I would study with Louis Ankton and Charlotte in the Class B dorms. I was a little worried what Bertus would say if he found out that I was studying in Class B,\u00a0but I realized that I didn\u2019t have to be that careful because of what Charlotte told me before.By the way, although both of these two were smart, they had different approaches on how to study.Charlotte usually took notes on the things she had already grasped and memorized them.Louis Ankton\u2019s approach was slightly different.\u201cThis is going to be a problem.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis is the only question I could ask about this.\u201dThis guy studied while thinking about how he\u2019d pose the questions if he were to make the exam. Of course, he memorized the whole thing, and studied by checking the parts that were likely to be asked.He was even preparing for the midterm evaluations of the professor\u2019s individual subjects, seeing as he was already quite confident in his preparations for the common classes. He was studying magic formulas. Something I wasn\u2019t really familiar with.Since my goal was to only get high marks in the common subjects, I wasn\u2019t really that well prepared for the professor\u2019s individual evaluations. Almost all the exams were written, so the only subjects that actually had practical exams were alchemy and divine studies.Anyway, Louis Ankton was trying to figure out what problems he might create for this subject, which was the most necessary for him.\u201cPhew\u2026. They should really hurry up and lift that ban on leaving.\u201dCharlotte muttered in a daze, completely spacing out.\u201cYeah.\u201dI was the only one who knew what she meant by saying that.Charlotte had to be more careful from now on, so she wouldn\u2019t be able to directly go to Eleris\u2019 shop.Only when the ban had been lifted would I be able to go outside and quickly run to Eleris\u2019 store.That seemed to be the only thing that occupied her mind at the moment.* * *All weekend, except for my morning training, I didn\u2019t do any physical work out, and only studied. Even though I was pretty sure I memorized everything, I felt exhausted in a different sense than before because I studied so hard.So, in the end, I stopped working on the common subjects and studied for the professor\u2019s individual subjects. I felt like I was going to go crazy if I continued to stare at the same thing over and over.It was pretty much certain that I would do pretty well, but considering the outcome, I thought it would be okay to get a single question wrong. However, If there were more than 100 people who got a perfect score in all the subjects, one might not even reach the top 100 if one got even a single question wrong.Anyway.I really got only one question wrong on the midterm exam.Therefore, my ranking for the integrated midterm exam was 784th place.I only got a single one wrong, and that was what happened.Everything went to crap.However, there was something even more troublesome.\u201cThis is the overall ranking after combining the grades of the professors\u2019 individual midterm evaluations and the integrated exam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMr. Epinhauser compiled the results of the professors\u2019 midterm evaluation and posted the overall ranking of the Royal Class\u2019 first years.Everyone was shocked to see the results.[1st Place \u2013 Reinhardt][2nd Place \u2013 Ellen][3rd Place \u2013 Bertus de Gardias][4th Place \u2013 Louis Ankton]I got 1st place on the wrong ranking.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90In the integrated exam I reached rank 784, however my overall score got me to 1st rank among all the first years of Royal Class.The reason was very simple.Simply put, I got an A+ in all midterm evaluations of the professor\u2019s individual subjects.Thanks to my training with Ellen, my knowledge about swordsmanship theory as well as my swordsmanship skills improved, so I won against all my opponents in the midterm students\u2019 tournament competition until I encountered Ellen.Did that mean that these guys weren\u2019t even as good as my pseudo swordsmanship?Or perhaps the requirements for turning swordsmanship into a talent were just that strict.I didn\u2019t even have to use my supernatural ability except when I was fighting Ellen. Of course, when I faced her I was beaten down in less than 5 seconds as usual.Anyway, Ellen obviously got an A+ for the swordsmanship classes, and I, who showed tremendous improvements, also got one. The regular class students, with whom I took the classes together with, initially ignored me for being nothing special, even though I was also part of the Royal Class. However, that day when they witnessed the tremendous improvement my skills underwent in just a few months, they also seemed to acknowledge me as someone from the Royal Class.I also wasn\u2019t very good at Horseback Riding at first, but I now knew how to ride a horse better than anyone else in that class, so I got an A+.The evaluation for the Magic Sensitivity class was done by checking the total amount my magic power increased, and that yoga master told me that mine had increased abnormally fast. My score was only surpassed by Cayer Vioden, who had a huge magic pool, so I got an A+ there as well.As for the Supernatural power classes, it was inevitable that I would get the highest score in them, because I had enormous control over my power after all, and it seems like I received the highest score in Meditation because apparently my concentration was just as tremendous as my control. I was just pretty patient though.And since Divine studies and Alchemy were reliant on memorization, I simply got the highest score by studying normally. As for comprehensive physical education, with the assistance of my supernatural power, I was able to clear all the physical tests, also giving me the highest score.Ellen and I were the only ones who received the highest score in all of the professor\u2019s individual subjects.However, Ellen got 2 questions wrong in the integrated exam.So I ranked first.I was only aiming to be among the top 10 of the integrated exam, but I ended up reaching 1st place on the wrong ranking and because of subjects I didn\u2019t even properly prepare for.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAll the students except Ellen, even Bertus, were looking at me somewhat strangely.Just what is that bastard?Their expressions showed a complex mix of surprise and doubt.* * *Apart from me, Bertus also seemed to have been victorious in his competition against Charlotte. Charlotte\u2019s total ranking was 6th. She did well on her written exams, but she couldn\u2019t get a grade for the physical classes because of her weak constitution, so this result was only natural.\u201cWhat the\u2026. How are you ranked first? How does that make sense?\u201dHarriet asked me something like that, ready to fight the results. It seemed like she didn\u2019t understand how this could have happened.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it makes sense or not. It\u2019s reality after all, you know?\u201d\u201cLies! I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cSure, by the way, good work reaching 8th place.\u201dHarriet was placed 8th. At my slight provocation, her face turned bright red.\u201cI-I\u2019m majoring in magic, so my magic subjects are all that matters! I don\u2019t have to do well on something like some lowly integrated exam!\u201dOf course, Harriet was only interested in magic, so she didn\u2019t even spare a glance on any other subject that didn\u2019t have anything to do with her major.\u201cI see, so what? You still lost.\u201dHer face turned even redder when she heard me say that she \u2018lost\u2019. All our classmates were watching what was happening here, so I stood up and tapped Harriet on her shoulder.\u201cHey, 8th place. Someone ranked 8th should just live like someone ranked 8th. Just stay quiet.\u201d\u201cW-What!\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you jealous? That you can only admire the life of someone ranked 1st from afar? Hahahahahahahahahaha!\u201dNow Harriet\u2019s face turned bluish as I showed her a deliberate and malicious smile, teasing her to the limit. Bertus covered his mouth and was quietly chuckling at this rather funny scene, and the others seemed to suffer from cognitive dissonance, because they just witnessed me teasing Harriet so openly.They knew I was rather blunt with Harriet, but they didn\u2019t know that it was to such an extent.\u201cY-You! You! You dirty beggar!\u201dHarriet, calling me a dirty beggar, hurt me as much as an ant\u2019s kick.\u201cAnd you\u2019re the young lady of a Grand Duchy who lost against a dirty beggar\u2026. No! You didn\u2019t even barely lose! You\u2019re 8th place! You lost to me by miles! Hehehehe! Our Grand Princess truly is great and sublime.\u201d\u201cAaaaah! You! You! You\u2019re deeeeeead!\u201dHarriet couldn\u2019t stand my teasing any longer and charged towards me, so I just opened the classroom door and left.\u201cHeeeeeey! Stop!\u201d\u201cJust chase me! Try following me at the speed of someone ranked 8th!\u201d\u201cAaaaaarg!\u201dI didn\u2019t mean to place 1st, but now that I did, it kind of felt good.* * *At lunchtime, Bertus sat down next to me.\u201cAren\u2019t you amazing, Reinhardt?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, it just somehow ended up like this.\u201dBertus was satisfied as long as he got to win over Charlotte. In fact, Ellen kept on outperforming him in the original novel, but he didn\u2019t really care. Rather, he\u2019d appreciate that person even more as a talent he needed to acquire.I didn\u2019t really know if I was treating that whole being 1st thing too lightly, but I just didn\u2019t care all that much.\u201cI knew you were rather hard-working, but it\u2019s still surprising.\u201dApparently, Bertus decided to rate me even higher. Then he looked towards Ellen, who was sitting across from me.\u201cI truly thought that it was rather strange for a troublemaker to get Royal Class\u2019 1st place, over a certain someone, right?\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that a bit harsh?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the truth though, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t deny that.\u201dIt seemed like Bertus thought that Ellen would be the undisputed number 1.However, I was ranked 1st, not Ellen.Bertus found that quite amusing. Ellen didn\u2019t respond to his words. She was the type of person that wouldn\u2019t care whether she placed 1st or not.And then there was Ludwig who stopped as he passed by the table Class A was sitting at.\u201cReinhardt! You got to first place, right? Congratulations!\u201dThat guy got an A+ in everything that involved moving his body, but he was just awful in any written exam, so his rank would never change.\u201cAh, yes. Thank you.\u201dIt was Ludwig who landed in last place without a doubt. Charlotte also passed by my table, giving me a slight smile. I knew what it meant without having her to tell me.Whenever she smiled while looking at me, I thought I might die, not in the literal sense. It was always that complex mix of joy and guilt that bubbled up in me.She got pushed back by Bertus this time. Did she not care at all about that?\u201cBy the way, Reinhardt, you seem to have become quite close with my sister, right?\u201dThese words sent a soul numbing tingle down my spine.I didn\u2019t know if that was all he knew, or if he found out anything more. However, even the other guys in my class knew that Charlotte and I had a pretty good relationship.\u201cWell\u2026. Kind of.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. No need to be so nervous.\u201dBertus told me that he didn\u2019t really care about that, so I didn\u2019t need to worry. If anyone else told me that, I wouldn\u2019t have minded, but this was Bertus, so I couldn\u2019t just believe that.When he told me to not be nervous, I got even more nervous.\u201cSince the midterm exams have come to a conclusion, the group missions will start soon.\u201dHearing Bertus\u2019 words, I now felt that the next event was inching closer.\u201cAre they going to follow the normal schedule?\u201d\u201cSince nothing has happened ever since that incident, the ban on going out will be lifted soon, so the schedule won\u2019t be changed.\u201dGroup missions.They were exams disguised as a trip.They were fast approaching.* * *It was May. The weather was getting warmer during that month.During the monthly physical scan, it was revealed that I had developed a new talent called Magic Sensitivity, so there was quite the uproar.A lot of people were skeptical about my infinite aptitudes, so it was quite surprising that I actually awakened two talents already.It caused such an uproar that I decided to postpone the awakening of my third talent. If talents just popped up one after the other, that would be suspicious in itself.Also, there was no further reason to ban us from going out.As Bertus said, after our common classes on Monday, Mr. Epinhauser announced the start of the group missions.Even if it was called a mission, it was still ultimately an exam.\u201cOnce per semester we shall conduct group missions starting with the first year of Temple\u2019s high school department.\u201d\u201cThe group missions are a competition between Class A and B, but it is also a strict exam that tests your cooperative spirit and your unity as a class. Keep in mind that the more one cooperates with the group and contributes, the more points said individual will receive.\u201d\u201cThe grades given for group missions are reflected in your grades for the whole semester. Of course, the winning class will receive better grades.\u201d\u201cGroup missions can take place inside or outside of Temple.\u201d\u201cThis is the Royal Class, much different from the regular classes. Therefore, the tasks will be more difficult than what is given to the general classes. Be aware that very dangerous situations may arise. In fact, a lot of people might get hurt or incapacitated.\u201d\u201cOf course, you are allowed to not participate in the group missions on your own judgement. In that case, the group\u2019s score will be reduced.\u201dThis was the biggest reason why Bertus needed competent class members and dissuaded the other kids from taking a leave of absence.Because the group missions held every semester were an important factor when calculating one\u2019s final grades. If even one person was missing, there was a very high possibility that we would be at a disadvantage.For example, even if Bertus surpassed Charlotte during the midterm exam, if Class B won in the group mission, Bertus might get pushed back by Charlotte in the end.I also put in that setting to cause some real sparks to fly between Class A and B by introducing something similar to a competition. Anyway, the genre was still slice-of-life, so they mostly just went on a picnic, but things wouldn\u2019t be fun like that, if all they did was go out to play. Without any action, there would only be occasional small fights and maybe some battle of nerves, but that was it.Of course, as with every event I planned out, not all the missions would go as the teachers planned. There would be unexpected accidents, completely bizarre things happening, and sometimes they would even face real threats or emergencies.Group missions. The best recurring event for convenient plot development.If one thought a bit more about this, making such precious children do such dangerous things in itself was quite daunting. Who\u2019d even do that?Well, it was me who wrote it, so it would just happen like that.If I wanted to shout at someone, then that would be at me from the past! I really had a lot of questions for past me!Anyway, this would be the first group mission.\u201cThe theme of this group mission is \u2018Survival\u2019.\u201dWe would go to a deserted island.There was no real reason why I chose an uninhabited island as the mission\u2019s venue.I was just watching an episode of\u00a0Law of the Jungle\u00a0while I wrote that arc.* * *The theme of the group mission was survival, but Mr. Epinhauser didn\u2019t even tell us that we would be going to a deserted island. That was because they would only tell you the theme of a group mission, but only after arriving at the venue would one realize what it actually meant.Of course, I knew exactly where we were going. I thought it might get canceled because of the terrorist incident, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.It was only natural that everyone was somewhat confused by this absurd sounding theme. There was also one piece of good news.The ban on going out was lifted, and the group mission would run for about five days, from next Monday to Friday. The other high schools would also conduct their group missions during that period of time, so all lectures would be stopped around that time.\u201cHave you noticed anyone keeping an eye on this place ever since that day?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been more careful since then, so I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cIt seems like Bertus is definitely convinced that I\u2019m absolutely gone\u2026. So I guess he didn\u2019t even see the need to look for me any further.\u201dAs the ban had been lifted, I immediately left Temple and headed to Eleris shop. Now I was able to come to this place even while I took the form of Reinhardt, however I didn\u2019t want to take any unnecessary risks, so I took several detours then changed my appearance before I dared to enter the store.As always, Eleris and I went upstairs to talk.\u201cAre you really fine with this? No matter how much Charlotte has become our ally in some capacity, this situation would put you in quite a lot of danger. You might get exposed.\u201d\u201cI thought a lot about it as well, but if there were to be an emergency, I would be able to make myself disappear quite effectively. Sarkegaar and Loyar also decided to only watch the situation for now.\u201dEleris had already discussed this matter with the other two.\u201cBy the way, weren\u2019t you somewhere else at the time we entered the store?\u201dEleris had obviously locked the shop door when we arrived here, but when Charlotte came in, she suddenly appeared from upstairs.\u201cI haven\u2019t cast any protection magic on the door, but I did set up a type of alarm magic on it. I sensed that the door had been destroyed, so I came back as fast as I could.\u201dUntil that moment, Eleris had been with Airi on the Edina Islands. However, she sensed her alarm magic installed on her door going off, so she returned using teleport. She was improvising at tremendous speed.If she hadn\u2019t returned in time, Charlotte might have been unaware of the truth, but she might have lost her whole store as a result, because Charlotte might have found something suspicious.\u201cWhat about Airi?\u201d\u201cThey are located in Rajak, the main port city of Edina. I\u2019m occasionally checking if things are progressing without any major problems, so you don\u2019t need to worry about them too much.\u201dEleris could check on Airi and co at any time using her Teleportation spell. So she told me that there was no need to worry and that I could leave everything to her.For now, we had decided to keep maintaining the status quo. If there were any problems on Eleris\u2019 side, she\u2019d be able to manage on her own. Until then, maintaining this relationship with Charlotte would be of help to us.\u201cAnyway.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dI still had a small thing to brag about, albeit a little childish.\u201cI got ranked 1st.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI said I got ranked 1st.\u201dIf it was Sarkegaar he\u2019d react quite violently, going \u201cUwoooooooooaaah!\u201d, but Eleris reacted a bit differently.\u201cThat\u2019s incredible, Your Highness.\u201dShe just smiled and complimented me, which made me feel quite good.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91I left as soon as the ban was lifted to get Eleris\u2019 progress report and tell her about my current situation; however there were even more important things I had to take care of.\u201c\u2026\u2026This?\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d be waiting, so I went there right away.\u201dSince I frequented Class B occasionally, the others didn\u2019t really care whether I came in or didn\u2019t. So, as soon as I returned to Temple, I dropped by Class B\u2019s dorm and gave Charlotte a letter when no one was watching.Knowing what kind of letter this was, Charlotte quickly embraced it.Charlotte\u2019s pupils were shaking violently.\u201cThank you, Reinhardt\u2026. Thank you.\u201dI knew she was waiting for this letter ever since the ban had been lifted, so she was deeply impressed that I would run out right away to get the letter. She continued to express her gratitude to me. Whenever the words \u201cThank you\u201d left her mouth, I felt like my heart was getting stabbed with needles.In the end, all of this was just a lie, so I had to keep lying.The contents of the letter were basically as follows.I\u2019m sorry for leaving without a word. I\u2019m fine. This person is protecting me well. I hope you are safe.I only elongated it a bit, but that was all I wrote. I also mentioned some things that only Valier would know, so that Charlotte wouldn\u2019t question its authenticity.\u201cWell, that was all. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dI couldn\u2019t stand seeing Charlotte\u2019s face while she was in this state any longer, so I just turned around to leave.\u201cCongratulations on reaching 1st rank, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Thanks.\u201dLeaving behind Charlotte, who congratulated me, I exited their dormitory.It would be best if my lies weren\u2019t exposed.I was getting more and more scared of how Charlotte would look at me if my lies were to be revealed.* * *The midterm exams were over. In the end, I wasn\u2019t able to accomplish that challenge. Well, people would just fail sometimes.However, it sure was funny how I aimed to reach 10th place, but ended up being ranked 1st somewhere else. Although, it didn\u2019t really give me any benefits.Anyway.Everything went back to normal.-Kang!\u201cSigh, really now.\u201dI picked up the sword that got hit out of my hand again. Ellen, as always, was just standing there looking at me.We did this almost every day. She\u2019d always work me to the bone until I started losing grip of my sword like this. Unless she served as a demonstration target, I was never able to land a single attack on her.\u201cI think I got a bit rusty after taking a break from training.\u201dIt was only about a week, but it seems like I got rusty over that period of time, because I was doing even worse than before I took that break.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not?\u201dWhat did she mean by \u201cNo\u201d? I felt like I was more sloppy than before.\u201cI raised the difficulty a bit.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Really?\u201dI didn\u2019t get rusty. Ellen, who had only been using 1% of her actual skill and power, was now using 1,5% of her strength. That would probably mean that I had become that much stronger.\u201cI feel a bit happy about that, but I\u2019m a little curious. Just how easy are you going on me?\u201dEllen looked a little troubled at first, but then she pointed her training sword towards the ceiling.\u201cMe.\u201dThen Ellen looked at the floor.\u201cYou.\u201d\u201cAre you pointing at the ceiling? You didn\u2019t mean the sky, right?\u201dI\u2019d even believe it if she meant the difference between us is like heaven and earth, not just the ceiling and the floor. Ellen shook her head, saying that she wasn\u2019t that good.\u201cIf you use your supernatural power, it\u2019s around this much.\u201dEllen was now pointing at a place located at approximately the height of her knees. Without using my supernatural powers, the difference between us was as wide as the distance between the floor and the ceiling, so about 5 meters; and when I used my powers, I would reach the height of her knees.That was a huge difference. If the gap in skill between me and Ellen had already closed to such an extent, I should have gotten quite a lot stronger.\u201cYou\u2019ve practiced so much with me, to the point that you couldn\u2019t tell how much you have improved.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I know that you\u2019re not actually that conceited and that you\u2019re only pretending to be. But don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit too much?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201dShe naturally was just that much stronger than me, so I had nothing left to respond to her. In fact, Ellen was constantly improving, at a much faster rate than me.Ellen was a wall that I would never be able to overcome.\u201cWell, I did feel it during the last swordsmanship evaluation.\u201dI meant the swordsmanship tournament held between students.\u201cEveryone else was moving so slow, I could see their every move.\u201dIf I strengthened my body using the swordsmanship-focused preset through Self-Suggestion, I felt like my physical abilities underwent a correction of about 2-3 points.My current stats were as follows.[Strength 5.9 (D-)][Agility 6.5 (D)][Dexterity 7.4 (D+)][Magic 11.1 (C)][Stamina 10 (C)]If the correction values were applied, the rank of my physical abilities would be slightly different.Compared to when I first came here, my stats had almost doubled except for my magical power.Now I would slowly enter a period where my growth would slow down, but anyway, the fruits of my efforts were clearly visible. If the correction offered by my supernatural powers were added to that, I already had quite the considerable level of physical strength, surpassing some of my classmates.Therefore, even though I didn\u2019t have the proper swordsmanship talent yet, I was able to defeat all of my classmates majoring in combat using just my reflexes and physical abilities. Even if they weren\u2019t actually part of the Royal Class, they were still first year high school students who majored in combat.As I was only ever training with Ellen, I felt a bit disheartened, but when I tried fighting my other classmates, it just felt too bland.In fact, I didn\u2019t even use my supernatural power until I had to face Ellen. I didn\u2019t really try that much. I won nearly every duel anyway.Did they ever realize that my swordsmanship was only on the level of Pseudo Swordsmanship? It didn\u2019t seem to be the case.The displayed information wasn\u2019t everything after all.I\u2019ve faced a certain high-level opponent so many times, that I knew how to deal with those guys who\u2019ve only learned some swordsmanship. This wasn\u2019t even considering my swordsmanship level.As I continued to train together with this overwhelming training partner of mine, my level increased tremendously without me realizing. This was a value that wouldn\u2019t show up on any measurement.Of course, it seemed like some of the more skillful students actually didn\u2019t join the class. So the results might look very different the next time I took another lecture on swordsmanship.\u201cCome.\u201d\u201cHere I come.\u201dAfter I fixed my stance, I stabbed my training sword towards Ellen.-Kaklang!Ellen tried to hit her own sword against my sword that was approaching her. She hit it from up top, pressing it down.As she pushed down my sword, she grabbed me by the collar with her left hand and threw me down, then dug into my solar plexus with her right elbow, making me drop my sword, and then with a flowing motion she hit me with the hilt of her sword.She then placed her sword against my neck.She had subdued me so overwhelmingly with dozens of derivative movements linked into a single flowing move.I then copied her moves. I guided Ellen\u2019s sword, which stabbed forward with my own, and proceeded to push my elbow into her solar plexus.I tried to make the methods she showed me my own bit by bit.Then, as soon as she caught me trying to hit her solar plexus, she leaned to my left, turned sideways, making me fall forward slightly.Damn it.I shifted my center of gravity so far forward that she was able to take my back.For that brief moment, while I wasn\u2019t able to react, Ellen had already pointed her training sword towards the back of my head.\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201dKnowing how to count to one didn\u2019t mean I could count to ten.This kid who knew how to count to ten, would show me how to count to two when I could barely say one, and when I managed to somehow count to two, she\u2019d demand I count to three. Then, when I could count to 10 one day, she\u2019d probably demand me to count to 50.Learning sure\u2026is hard.* * *Morning training.Adriana stared blankly at me, with her mouth slightly open, when I told her that I ranked 1st on the first-year midterm evaluation ranking.\u201cI already know that I don\u2019t have the best image, but ain\u2019t it a bit sad that everyone\u2019s reacting like that?\u201dWhen I said that I felt a little sad about this, Adriana\u2019s expression immediately turned into a frown.\u201cAh\u2026. I-I\u2019m sorry, junior. I knew you were pretty hard-working\u2026.\u201dAdriana patted her cheeks a little.\u201cBut you really don\u2019t have a smart image, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Can\u2019t deny that.\u201dSmart troublemakers were quite the rare breed. Everyone, no matter where I went, just held that prejudice that I was a bastard.Well, it\u2019s not really prejudice, though.\u201cThe more I get to know you, the more I get surprised by you, junior.\u201dAt first, she must have thought of me as nothing but a mad dog who\u2019d openly swear at his senior, so no matter what I did, I\u2019d end up surprising her. On top of that, I even apologized to the 2nd year\u2019s A-1 Redina.I was now in good enough shape that I was able to talk with Adriana while we were running. My classmate\u2019s average stamina scores were about 6-7, D rank, however my score was at 10, C rank. It was definitely above average, and it would be even higher if I applied my supernatural power. Of course, I wasn\u2019t talking about the average score of the guys with combat talents.I didn\u2019t think I could sprint around Temple at full speed like Ludwig. He had a stamina score of 30. That would be A+ rank. In that regard, he was an even more monstrous kid than Ellen.\u201cBy the way, your first group mission will start soon, right junior?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe first mission\u2019s theme is survival, right?\u201d\u201cIs the theme supposed to be fixed?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. It\u2019s usually something like that.\u201dThe first group mission usually had something to do with survival. I didn\u2019t actually know this.\u201cWhat is your theme this year, senior?\u201d\u201cScramble.\u201dScramble.In some cases, it was a capture-the-flag kind of battle; in other cases, it had to do with a team acquiring an object at a specific location, and who got it first won. Of course, since it was quite a large scale mission, it wasn\u2019t only a battle that lasted for a long time, but it was also something close to an actual battle between classes.We wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do something like that right now, because we weren\u2019t able to control our powers properly yet.However, the survival mission also came with many risks.\u201cIf it\u2019s survival, I think you\u2019ll do well, junior.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You think I\u2019ll do well because I\u2019m from the streets, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny that.\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019m from the streets. I didn\u2019t say I grew up in a jungle.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026. It\u2019s not really about that, though.\u201dAdriana smiled as she ran next to me at a constant tempo.\u201cThe survival mission is the one the kids from noble families give up on the most.\u201dThey suddenly told the precious children of noble families to live in some damp and humid environment filled with bugs.Of course, there would be a lot of kids who wouldn\u2019t be able to accept that.* * *It was May at the moment.In this world, May was a rather pleasant month. Honestly, with weather like that, it was best to just leave everything behind and lie down on the grassy riverside of the Han-River. There were actually people who did just that.The festival was cancelled, but people seemed to have returned to their daily routine. The terrorist incident ended up concluding with its perpetrator still at large.Anxiety about the Demon Realm\u2019s revival still remained, but the people regained their original vitality. The Empire secured a lot of loot from the Demon Realm, and all the nations that participated in the war came to great wealth.Eventually, the Golden Age would begin with the wealth obtained from the Demon Realm.May was the beginning of said Golden Age.The weather was perfect for camping.\u201cUrg\u2026. Why is it so hot?\u201d\u201cRather than hot\u2026. It feels so sticky.\u201dAll the first years of Temple\u2019s Royal Class went through a large gate and were teleported somewhere by some Temple officials, who seemed to be high-ranking wizards, and that somewhere was an uninhabited tropical island.[Event Quest \u2013 Group Mission][Description: The theme of the group mission is survival. Please survive until the end of the mission.][Goal: Don\u2019t get eliminated before the mission is over][Reward: 1000 Achievement Points]And, of course, an Event Quest appeared.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 9222 students, me included, were standing on a white sandy beach from which the clear water of the sea could be seen.Everyone was instructed to wear comfortable clothes, not the school uniforms. We were also told to wear long sleeved shirts and long pants if possible, so we were all dressed in similar things.Of course, Class A and B were located far apart from each other.Mr. Epinhauser stood before Class A.The students seemed confused by their sudden arrival at a place like this. The only one who wasn\u2019t flustered was Ellen, who was ready to do anything no matter what happened. Even Bertus seemed a little puzzled.Mr. Epinhauser started briefing us.\u201cWe are currently on an uninhabited island located within the Empire\u2019s Kamsencha Archipelago. The island is about three times the size of Temple.\u201dAlthough it was an uninhabited island, it was rather big. The island was covered in a rainforest and the beach was filled with white sand.\u201cYou have to survive on this island for about five days starting today, meaning from Monday to Friday evening. We will provide you with a box with supplies. Whether you hunt or gather common supplies found in this place, no matter what, you will have to survive until Friday.\u201dWe have to survive here for 5 days. That might seem like a daunting task, but it wasn\u2019t impossible.As they heard these words, everyone just stared blankly with their mouths open. The nobles in particular were astonished, as if it didn\u2019t make sense to them why they had to survive in such a harsh environment..\u201cI-Isn\u2019t this dangerous? W-We don\u2019t know what might happen\u2026. If we get hurt or something, what should we do\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t this too irresponsible to just throw us here, leaving us to fend for ourselves\u2026?\u201dAs Harriet was mumbling about how unreasonable this situation was, Heinrich von Schwarz started to complain as well.\u201cIt\u2019s not compulsory. If you want to give up, you can at any point. You would just fail.\u201dOf course, it was crazy to ask children to just survive on their own on some deserted island for five days, whether they were from noble families or not.However, the people gathered here were the best talents the Empire had to offer, only in terms of talent though, not in skills. That was why they received special treatment. And those who receive special treatment would also be given special trials.Going by such logic, they\u2019d give us more difficult tasks like this.\u201cYou will be given a button shaped artifact.\u201dMr. Epinhauser pulled out something that looked like a button.\u201cUse this if an emergency has occurred or if you want to give up. After activating it, you will be sent to a safe place immediately. However, keep in mind that if you use it, you\u2019ll be eliminated.\u201dWe could give up whenever we wanted, and in the event of an accident, actions could be taken immediately.I could already see some people ready to press the button as soon as we were to get them. However, if one were to continue to fail in group missions, there was a possibility that one had to repeat a year if their results were especially bad. Of course, there was no one who had to repeat a year in the original novel. However, the development had changed, so I didn\u2019t know what might happen.Mr. Epinhauser only explained the facts in an indifferent and cool manner, as always.-Don\u2019t overdo it, guys. Good grades are one thing, but your safety comes first. This place is safer than you guys think, but if you really can\u2019t take it anymore, you have to use this artifact. Understood?And I could hear Mr. Mustrang, the opposite of Mr. Epinhauser, briefing his class. However, wasn\u2019t it even more unsettling putting it like that?\u201cLet me know if you have any questions.\u201dAt Mr. Epinhauser\u2019s words, Bertus raised his hand.\u201cAre there any dangerous monsters on this island?\u201dBertus\u2019 question was to see if they sent us here without even checking\u00a0that.\u201cIt is one of the rules to not provide you with any information about the island. However, I can tell you one thing.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was speaking calmly.\u201cThis mission is designed to test your crisis management skills and how you\u2019d act in real emergencies.\u201dNothing could be guaranteed.They already determined that we had abilities. Now they were trying to see how we would make use of these abilities. Would we act selfish, hateful, cold-hearted, or irrational?\u201cYou guys are part of the Royal Class. Even within Temple, you are a privileged class, so you have to prove that you are better than the general class.\u201dThere are people who possessed great power but flatter and become dispirited, faced with hurdles; and then there are those who\u2019d struggle with all their might to overcome all difficulties on their way, even though their power wasn\u2019t all that strong.The group mission was to confirm exactly that.Being a student of the Royal Class brought a lot of privileges with it. Therefore, it was only natural that we had to overcome even harder trials.The teacher wasn\u2019t even allowed to tell us if it was dangerous or not.\u201cI won\u2019t give you a lengthy explanation. If you want to give up, press the button. If you don\u2019t think that you are able to survive until Friday, giving up in advance is also fine.\u201dHowever, if we did that, we would lose.Everyone could fully guess what Mr. Epinhauser was trying to say.\u201cAnd one more thing.\u201dIt was now time for Mr. Epinhauser to tell us the most important thing.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to meet certain conditions, you might be able to complete the mission sooner than the expected time. Additionally, the class that satisfied said conditions would receive additional points.\u201dSpecial missions.If certain conditions were fulfilled, the mission could end earlier, and the class that managed to do that would receive more points.\u201cOf course, this is only an optional mission. It won\u2019t cause any problems if you aren\u2019t able to fulfill it. With this, I have conveyed all the information I can give.\u201dMr. Epinhauser took out one more button-shaped artifact similar to ours, from his bosom pocket and disappeared.He probably was still watching us from somewhere, but he really wasn\u2019t anywhere close to us.\u201cD-Did\u2026he really leave?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. How\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dThe kids were really shocked that their teacher had left.Actually, strictly speaking, wasn\u2019t this abuse?It was at that moment that I realized what kind of thing I actually made them do by writing up this development.-Shaaa\u2026Clear water was constantly crashing against the shore from afar.We were literally children who had been abandoned by the sea.* * *The far-off Class B was also soon left behind by Mr. Mustrang.It seemed like both Class A and B had lost their spirits. Bertus was deep in thoughts with his arms folded. He probably knew beforehand, but only after seeing this with his own eyes, did he realize just how ridiculous this situation was.It was rather useless to count on those, who were at the time out of their minds.Except for me, Ellen, and Bertus, who were seriously thinking about what to do, everyone else seemed to be out of their minds or speechless.\u201cWhat\u2019s with this? Why do we have to do something like this? How would that help us?\u201dKono Lint was complaining.\u201cSo\u2026\u2026 What now? What do they want us to do after leaving us here so suddenly\u2026\u2026\u201dThat was Cayer Vioden speaking.Just because they were commoners didn\u2019t mean that they were happy with this situation. It was humid and hot. No one would be accustomed to something like that.The guys from noble families already seemed to have their heads filled with thoughts of giving up. They thought this situation was so ridiculous that they couldn\u2019t even put it into words.Even the commoners couldn\u2019t stand the situation. The only fortunate thing was that the noble kids, who only knew how to wear good clothes, eat good food, and sleep in soft beds, didn\u2019t start crying.In the original, Class A, which had a lot of nobles in it, somehow managed to survive the first day, but then most of them gave up voluntarily. Everyone gave up one by one until only Ellen remained.Class B would be able to complete the mission led by Ludwig\u2019s initiative.As the development had greatly deviated from the original already, I didn\u2019t know what would happen in Class B\u2019s camp. So, I had no intention of letting the current Class A follow that development either.First of all, I needed those achievement points, so I had to be patient; furthermore it would be impossible for me to survive alone, so I had to drag these guys along no matter what.I opened the communal supply box left behind where Mr. Epinhauser stood before.Everyone stared at me as I moved. In this situation, it was more normal to whine and complain. It was more unusual for a 17-year-old to be so calm.I took out the contents of the box and organized them. Everyone was just staring at me blankly.Two machetes.Ten arrows and one shortbow.A bundle of rope.Three types of pots, one large, one medium, and one small.Three throwing javelins with barbs.One axe.Three small knives.One firestarter.Eleven canteens of water.And eleven button shaped artifacts.I thought that was a decent amount of supplies. They were just the basics, but they provided enough tools to leave us alone here.Everyone was just staring at what I was doing. I just ignored the other guys and looked at Ellen.\u201cHey, you won\u2019t give up, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEllen nodded.\u201cBertus, you\u2019re not going to give up as well, right?\u201dBertus nodded when I called out to him, albeit with a somewhat more serious expression. Unlike in the original, Class B had Charlotte in it, so Bertus wouldn\u2019t give up.There were two more people who wouldn\u2019t give up no matter what, aside from me. I grabbed the machete and handed the short bow and arrows to Ellen.\u201cI\u2019ll go in there. You take care of this side, okay?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. You\u2019re going? In there?\u201d\u201cI have to. I need to find something.\u201d\u201cN-No. Are you going to be okay? We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there, you know?\u201d\u201cWill I die?\u201dWhen I said that I would go inside the jungle without much hesitation, Bertus looked really flustered. It would be a hundred times better to leave the overall leadership of the other kids to Bertus. He seemed a bit perplexed at first, but soon found his composure again.\u201cO-Okay, Reinhardt. I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201dAnyway, this was Bertus we were talking about. He wouldn\u2019t want to do a bad job, either. However, what I asked of him was a pretty simple job, which was taking control of the kids and taking up the leader position.He must have felt some reluctance to this situation as well, as he grew up in an extremely good environment.\u201cCome with me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI took the lead, and Ellen followed me without saying much.Ellen and I were probably the most abnormal in this situation.* * *Ellen was good with bows as well. So, when any beast appeared, I told her to follow it, leaving the hunting to her.-Chk! Chk!Ellen and I slowly moved further in, while sweeping through thick bushes and lush greenery located in the jungle.\u201cIt\u2019s fricking hot.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201dBoth me and Ellen were drenched in sweat. Ellen found her long hair rather cumbersome, so she tied it up with a string. There were sweat drops all over her face, nape and neck.Fortunately, there were no mosquitoes, the worst fiends usually found in a jungle.This was an exam as well as a mission. Even though Epinhauser only gave us next to no information about this island, I knew a lot about it.This island was a controlled environment. Therefore, mosquitoes, which could spread dangerous infectious diseases that could cost our lives, were completely eradicated. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t any bugs.There was an obvious possibility that unexpected accidents might occur, but we wouldn\u2019t be faced with the uncontrolled dangers an uncontrolled environment would house.-Flap, flap, flap!We could hear birds flying away, because of the noise we caused by cutting down the bushes.\u201cCan you shoot down those flying birds?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not that good.\u201dEllen was pretty good at archery, but she wasn\u2019t a professional. She didn\u2019t have such advanced skills yet.I didn\u2019t really intend to go much deeper. I\u2019d soon be able to find what I was looking for.\u201cThere it is.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201dI grinned and pointed to some densely packed trees.\u201cIs this your first time seeing a coconut?\u201dThey were a staple for uninhabited island scenes.There\u2019d definitely be coconuts.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Survival on a tropical island.The most important thing to secure first was water; afterwards came food. One could end up in a pretty dangerous situation because of dehydration. So coconuts were the perfect food for survival as they covered both aspects.I twisted off one coconut after the other. It was my first time ever climbing a tree, but I was able to climb them surprisingly easily because of my increased physical abilities. I felt like I could climb even better than monkeys.Ellen also climbed up a different tree and easily picked some coconuts. I mean, I also climbed up the trees without any hesitation, but just who is so good at climbing trees?After picking some coconuts, I climbed back down and landed on the ground. While carrying five coconuts each in our arms, we returned to the beach.\u201cWha\u2026 What?\u201d-Clack, clack, clack.When we put down the coconuts we were carrying, the others were still looking at us in a daze, but they did seem glad to see us. Even Class B further away from us seemed to do something, while our Class A still seemed undecided.\u201cNo\u2026 Why did you bring all of this here?\u201dBertus looked astonished at my behavior.\u201cOnce we run out of water, we can drink from those.\u201dThere were eleven canisters, but after we ran out of that water, we could drink as much as we wanted from these coconuts. Everyone already held a canteen and an artifact in their hands, making it seem as if the distribution of the supplies had already finished.Everyone was sitting idly in the shade, seeming like they didn\u2019t know what else to do. Even Bertus was like that.Well, it would be even weirder if this Prince actually managed to set up a camp in this situation.First, the most urgent matter of securing a source of drinking water could be put off for a bit. And it didn\u2019t seem like anyone had given up.\u201cReinhardt, let\u2019s talk for a second.\u201d\u201cAh, sure.\u201dBertus led me to a place slightly farther away from our classmates.\u201cHave you done something like this before?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve done something like this before, It\u2019s just that I\u2019d rather do something instead of just sitting on my ass. One has to rest to preserve one\u2019s stamina, but before that, certain things have to be done.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dIt seemed to him like I was familiar or very experienced with situations like this. However, although I had a lot of indirect experience with these things, this was actually the first time I landed in a situation like that myself. I was just like Bertus, who ended up losing his cool in our current situation.It looked like I had to give him some advice.\u201cFirst, we need a place to sleep, no matter how crude it is. A place to avoid the heat of the sun as well as to protect us from rain.\u201dWe needed something like a hut, even if it was just something crude. Bertus nodded his head, seeming to have understood what I meant.\u201cBut how do we make something like that in this situation?\u201dHe had to make something he had never made before. There also weren\u2019t any famous shows depicting the eternal battle between humans and nature in this world. It was only natural that Bertus was stumped.\u201cThere are trees, vines, and palm leaves all over the place. I think we\u2019ll be able to make something that would help by roughly intertwining them.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Can we really make something helpful with only leaves?\u201dEven before the survival mission started, I was already thinking about what we should do. I kind of knew how to make a hut, but I wasn\u2019t really confident that it would turn out good. I mean, if I had no other choice, I probably would have tried at least.\u201cNeither you nor I need to think about that too much. There are others much better at these kinds of things.\u201dHowever, there was no need for me to actually do it when there was someone much better at these kinds of things than me.\u201cNumber 7 Adelia. If we leave it to her, she\u2019ll be able to do a good job.\u201dHer ability was magic tool crafting. Of course, I didn\u2019t really know how related the crafting of magic tools and the building of a hut was, but she was very talented at designing and making things compared to a normal person.If it was her, she\u2019d at least be able to come up with a plausible blueprint. Better than anything I could come up with.It kind of felt like how the military made students paint fences.\u201cHmm\u2026 Is that so?\u201dBertus didn\u2019t seem to have any clue about all this.* * *Bertus returned to the shady area where most of Class A, who were severely mentally exhausted, had gathered, and called Adelia.Then he said to her that he was of the opinion that we should make a hut, and asked if she had any idea how to go about that.\u201cThat\u2026 If you asked me to make something so suddenly\u2026 I don\u2019t even have any equipment or tools here\u2026\u201dShe was someone specialized in magic tool crafting and summoning magic. However, if she was asked to suddenly make a hut like this, it seemed that she was evidently flustered.\u201cThe pillars can be made of wood, and the roof could be tiled with something like palm leaves. Do you have any good ideas?\u201dAt Bertus\u2019 words, Adelia, who was quite cowardly, murmured in a timid, crawling voice.\u201cErmm\u2026 I think, we could structure it like a tripod\u2026 Do we really have to sleep here?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to give up, we have to, right?\u201dBertus was smiling, and there was no one around that would go and say \u201cI really can\u2019t do this.\u201d directly to his face. Of course, after spending a night here, they\u2019d probably want to give up even more than they do now.Harriet didn\u2019t say a thing, her face buried in her legs.She might end up crying. I mean, it was a situation that made one cry, after all.\u201cHmm\u2026 If I were to make this, I\u2019d need\u2026 wood and vines. Really big ones. I think we\u2019d need a lot of leaves as well\u2026\u201dAdelia murmured as if she was already drawing up blueprints in her head.\u201cGreat. Then let\u2019s do it like that.\u201dBertus didn\u2019t feel that great about this situation either, but losing to Class B was even worse. So he forced himself to raise the tension.\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s try doing something, at least. If we really can\u2019t go on, we can always give up, but don\u2019t you think we should try at least? It\u2019s kind of weird just giving up before we even did anything, right?\u201dBertus pointed at Cayer, Erich, and Kono Lint, who were silent.\u201cYou three are in charge of getting us vines and leaves from inside the jungle. As many as possible.\u201dEveryone had their assigned duties. All of them looked a little reluctant, but they didn\u2019t have the guts to refuse Bertus\u2019 instructions. After Bertus decided on actually giving this a try, his thoughts seemed to flow smoothly.\u201cSaint-Owan. Can you use magic right now?\u201dAt Bertus\u2019 call, Harriet raised her head with her eyes wide open. Her expression showed bewilderment.\u201cAh\u2026 Huh? Well\u2026 I can\u2019t do anything of a high level yet\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. It just has to be something of a level that can cut some trees about that size. How is it?\u201dWhat Bertus pointed to was a regular-sized tree.\u201cUhm\u2026 I think I can do that\u2026\u201cHarriet nodded, a little depressed, but it didn\u2019t seem like something she was completely adverse to.\u201cGreat. Cut down as many trees as possible, but it\u2019s pretty dangerous, so be careful not to get hurt.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dHarriet got up from where she sat. It seemed like she would do what was asked of her, even while she felt rather depressed.\u201cEllen and Cliffman. Could you help set up the camp as Adelia requested?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dEllen and Cliffman were the strongest in this class in terms of physical strength. So it was only right for those two to be in charge of the physical labor.There seemed to be a bigger picture gradually coming together in Bertus\u2019 mind. Was he the type that, if told one thing, would realize two? Or maybe it was just his mentality slowly recovering, leading to his sudden motivation. He was someone that would become active as soon as he got someone to order around. Villain or not, he was a born leader.The only ones that were not given a role for now were me, Liana de Grantz, and Heinrich von Schwarz.\u201cBertus, could you leave me in charge of those two?\u201dAt my words, Bertus tilted his head. Additionally, when they heard me ask if I could be in charge of them, both of them had some sullen expressions on their faces. Heinrich hated me, and I haven\u2019t even spoken to Liana yet, so they obviously didn\u2019t have any good reactions to my words.\u201cHmm\u2026 Do you have any plans?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I think the two of them are actually the most important out of all of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Really?\u201dTheir expressions became quite strange after they were subjected to my sudden, uncharacteristic compliment.* * *Heinrich von Schwarz, Pyrokinesis.Liana de Grantz, Electrokinesis.These two supernatural powers were key to survival in this jungle, in my opinion.\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dHeinrich\u2019s eyes were filled with distrust, as if he only ever got lied to.\u201cTill when are you going to stay mad at me? We\u2019re in the same boat here, so let\u2019s cooperate.\u201dHeinrich quickly turned his head, saying that he didn\u2019t want to deal with private things right now, even though we literally had to work together to keep our heads above water.\u201c\u2026\u2026Tch.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why me?\u201d\u201cJust wait. I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201dIt seemed clear that Liana was just as wary of me. I didn\u2019t want to explain everything to them just yet, while they were like this. I didn\u2019t want to get closer to them, either.Since the situation was the way it was, I would make as much use of them as I could. If they didn\u2019t like it, I would make them listen, even if I had to crush them.\u201cFrom now on, we\u2019ll be able to light fires whenever we want to. So, for now, we\u2019ll start making some fresh drinking water.\u201d\u201c\u2026Fresh drinking water?\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019ll need water. You\u2019re the only one here except Harriet who can light fires whenever he wants.\u201dAlthough, I once said that he wasn\u2019t even as good as a flint, of course he was much better to maintain than one, though. As long as he kept his mouth shut.\u201cI asked Adelia to make a vapor condensing device. After that, we can keep making water.\u201d\u201c\u2026A-Are you treating me like a flint? And do you seriously think that you can order me around?\u201dHeinrich frowned as if he had been insulted just now, then I sighed.I\u2019m so fucking annoyed. Should I just hit him?No.Let\u2019s not make the situation worse.\u201cPhew\u2026. Whether you hear it from my mouth or Bertus\u2019, it doesn\u2019t matter, mate. Do you want to get us into trouble? If you don\u2019t do this, the water will run out within two days or so.\u201dIn this tropical environment, dehydration would be a serious threat. I mean, I was indeed treating him like a flint, but if we didn\u2019t do this, we would have to keep hydrate using coconuts only. After we had something like a vapor condensation machine, we could make drinking water from seawater continuously. It was a simple but important role.Even if he told me that he didn\u2019t want to follow my orders, he\u2019d just end up hearing the same order from Bertus shortly after.\u201c\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m doing this for everyone, got it?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, got it. Work hard.\u201dAfter having understood what I was telling him, Heinrich just disappeared as if he didn\u2019t want to speak with me any longer. Heinrich was gone, leaving only Liana de Grantz, who seemed a bit reluctant, behind.\u201cYou have to hunt.\u201d\u201cHunt?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI pointed towards the beach.\u201cFishing might be the more correct term, though.\u201dI was going for something similar to stunning fish by electrifying water with a car battery.* * *If I were to introduce a car battery to a pool of water or a river, all the fish within it would be stunned, floating to the surface. Of course, that was highly illegal.However, there were no such laws in this world, and even if there were, we had to survive on this deserted island no matter what and through any means.I took Liana to the beach.-Shwaaaaa\u2026\u201cYou won\u2019t get electrocuted or something, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLiana, who was full of surprises, was basically immune to electricity. Liana still seemed quite reluctant.\u201cTry using your supernatural power on the water.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I doubt it\u2019ll work.\u201dShe hesitated for a bit, but then began to concentrate. I then backed away, fearing that I might get electrocuted.-Brzzzt! Brrrrzzzzt!Blue electric currents flew from Liana\u2019s hands, and were soon raging among the waves. This girl certainly had excellent control over her supernatural power.-Shwaaa\u2026.And, nothing really happened.Liana clicked her tongue slightly.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to get wet.\u201dSaying so, she slowly walked down to the water, immersing her arms into it this time.Well, she seemed rather picky, but she did what I asked of her.This time, she activated her ability after her hands were fully submerged in the water. Although I couldn\u2019t really see it.Of course, there was nothing different from before. The sea was quite, and there were no stunned fish floating up. Liana looked back at me.\u201cI told you. It won\u2019t work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Right.\u201dI\u2019ve only ever heard of car battery fishing, but I never actually tried it myself. I didn\u2019t know if it was because Liana\u2019s abilities were still lacking, or if there was some other problem. Liana came out of the water and frowned, seeing her wet shoes.It seemed that she was royally pissed, that the only thing my request did, was get her shoes wet.\u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do, but for that to happen, I would have to get close to the fish, whether by diving or swimming. My range isn\u2019t that wide. And I can\u2019t swim.\u201dShe seemed feisty, but she still seemed to properly explain things to me. How very strange.Anyway, I thought with electricity alone, I would be able to cover a fairly wide area, even if it wouldn\u2019t affect the whole ocean. That wasn\u2019t the case.The Korean Department of Education should make a public apology because of this.\u201cYou can\u2019t swim\u2026 So what if I were to carry you on my back while we go in there and you electrocute\u2026 Oh, right, I\u2019d get electrocuted as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Weren\u2019t you first ranked in the exams?\u201dLiana looked at me with a rather strange look. It seemed like she was doubting how someone like me could take first place. It sure was a waste, but if I couldn\u2019t use her, I wouldn\u2019t be able to catch any fish.\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of your ability?\u201d\u201c5 meters.\u201dHer output wasn\u2019t that strong at the moment. Looks like I had to struggle some more. Liana just sighed and started to tie her hair up.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can just walk around the place and electrocute a fish if it gets close enough.\u201dLiana headed towards the sea again, saying that I should go out of her way because I\u2019d just bother her.Liana de Grantz.She only ever said slightly harsh and chilly things, so in the beginning, she was seen as a somewhat harsh person with a bad temper by the class.However, later, after the separation between Class A and B got resolved, it was revealed that she wasn\u2019t actually bad-tempered. It was just the way she spoke, and since the kids from Class B didn\u2019t cross ways with Class A very often, they didn\u2019t know what kind of person she was.That was how I set her up, but it was still strange seeing her act like that right before my eyes.It was a subtle feeling, she being kind of nice, while still speaking pretty harshly.As she entered the water, Liana suddenly turned back and looked at me.\u201cCome to think of it, I can\u2019t even touch fish.\u201dAnother absurd characteristic I gave her was that she was clumsy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Although Liana said that she wasn\u2019t able to even touch fish, she decided that this wasn\u2019t a situation in which she could make such excuses, so she eventually walked back towards the ocean again.I had never been to a tropical resort in any of my lives. So, I never imagined that I would end up witnessing such beautiful scenery on an uninhabited island like this.Of course, this scenery was really breathtaking, but I didn\u2019t have any time to enjoy it at the moment.\u201cGet out of the way! It\u2019s falling!\u201d\u201cUwah!\u201d-Wruuuush!After the tree began to fall into one direction, it made a thunderous sound as it hit the ground.Harriet just felled a tree; however, she seemed to be the most confused about that.\u201cGyaaaa! Bugs! There are buuuuugs!\u201dOr more like she was busy being terrified of the bugs that fell from said tree. She was probably the one most uncomfortable with this situation, in many ways. But we needed her the most as well, as she was the only one that had many different types of magic spells available to her.\u201cI think\u2026this should be enough trees. Now\u2026let\u2019s cut them smaller together.\u201dAt Adelia\u2019s words, Harriet nodded helplessly.She managed to fell 5 trees. Now those trees had to be trimmed down and then turned into either pillars or flooring. Cliffman was cutting down some bushes to create a road in the jungle, and Ellen was cutting the trees with an axe.Palm leaves and vines were still in the process of being procured, and Bertus was directing the workers and helping out when needed.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?\u201dBertus seemed to be curious about Class B\u2019s progress.\u201cLooks like they\u2019re doing the same thing as us.\u201dClass B, located on a distant place along the coast, could be seen bustling about making something as well.\u201cJust what is that special condition\u2026\u201dIf we were able to meet a specific condition, we could end this mission early, and we\u2019d receive additional points. If we didn\u2019t want to stay here for a long time, it would be better if we explored the island a bit more.Even Bertus didn\u2019t want to stay in this place for too long. That was why he\u2019d much rather find a way to fulfill that condition.\u201cReinhardt. Well\u2026\u201dAfter trying to tell me something, Bertus just sighed.\u201cNo. Forget it. We don\u2019t even know what it is, so it would be foolish to just blindly fumble around. Let\u2019s not do anything dangerous for now. Let\u2019s think more about this after we complete our camp.\u201dNo matter how much I went into the jungle without any hesitation just a few minutes ago, it seemed like he didn\u2019t want to burden me with that.After talking for a bit, Bertus and I began to roll away the trees.-Someone catch this!Then an urgent voice could be heard from the beach.* * *\u201cWow\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy is it so big?\u201d\u201cEww! It\u2019s so gross!\u201dLiana caught something, but she wasn\u2019t able to touch it herself, so when they saw me bringing that thing to the camp, everyone just stopped working, standing there in a daze. Harriet and Liana were evidently grossed out by it.It wasn\u2019t a fish.We caught something that looked similar to a crayfish. It was five times bigger than a common lobster.\u201cThis thing is absolutely delicious!\u201dEllen nodded violently when she heard me say that. She seemed to be thinking about devouring it already.It went without saying that the bigger the crustacean was, the better it tasted.\u201c\u2026I think we should first check if this is edible or not.\u201dBertus expressed some concerns and tried to calm me down, who had his eyes completely focused on that delicacy that unexpectedly appeared before me.\u201cWon\u2019t it be fine if we just cook it well?\u201d\u201cUhmm\u2026. Still, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s poisonous or not.\u201dIn fact, Bertus\u2019 concern about what would happen if we were to eat something unknown like that was completely rational in this environment.\u201cI mean, the teachers are probably watching us from somewhere, they\u2019d probably give us a warning, if we were to try to eat something weird.\u201dIf the kids were to try to eat something like a poisonous mushroom because they were just that hungry, they would be stopped immediately. This wasn\u2019t an actual life-or-death situation, but only a mission. Going by that reasoning, Bertus seemed to agree with me.\u201cBut how do we prepare this?\u201dIts taste aside, Liana seemed terrified at how disgusting it looked. She was probably someone with\u00a0Kabourophobia.\u201cWhy are you making this so complicated? We\u2019ll just cook it, simple as that.\u201dThe nobles, especially the girls, grimaced as they imagined grilling something over an open fire in this place.\u201cBut one of these won\u2019t be enough.\u201dWe caught a huge lobster, but this wasn\u2019t enough to feed 11 people. At Bertus\u2019 words, Liana, who had been drinking some water from her canteen, seemed to feel like they were directed at her.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go back.\u201dIt seemed like she was going to a battlefield, having to catch something she couldn\u2019t even touch. By the way, everyone was sweating buckets as all of them had to do their assigned jobs in this extreme heat. So, everyone was guzzling water from their canteens, not knowing that it was quite the waste.\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it, if you don\u2019t conserve your water.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay since you gathered those coconuts?\u201dKono Lint\u2019s nonchalant remarks earned a glare from me.\u201cHey, d\u2019ya think it\u2019s easy climbing trees? You wanna do it?\u201d\u201cH-Huh? N-No, that\u2019s not\u2026.\u201dHe said it so easily, because it wasn\u2019t him who picked those coconuts\u2026.No.Wait a sec.Number 8, Kono Lint.His ability was teleportation.\u201c\u2026Come to think of it, you really should be the one to pick them.\u201dIf he used his ability, he\u2019d get naked as a side effect.So if no one was watching, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem with him using it, right?\u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll be in charge of gathering coconuts.\u201d\u201cH-Huuuuuh?\u201dAs everyone in class knew the side effects of Kono Lint\u2019s ability, everyone started laughing.* * *After making Kono Lint the designated coconut shuttle, I entered the jungle alone.I didn\u2019t know how it would go, but honestly, I wasn\u2019t that interested whether we won or lost in this group mission. The condition of completing my quest was to survive; it didn\u2019t mention anything about winning.As long as we could hold out until Friday, I would receive my achievement points, so Class A didn\u2019t have to win for that.Also, I kind of wanted Charlotte to win.So I didn\u2019t really assert myself to complete these conditions. I didn\u2019t even think that it was possible to begin with.I wasn\u2019t confident in my archery skills, so I was currently carrying around a machete and three javelins.Although I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d actually be able to do some hunting, I still took them with me.However, my current goal wasn\u2019t to hunt for food, but to secure a new freshwater source.The island was quite large and also had some mountains. Therefore, if I were to search carefully, I\u2019d be able to find a water flow. Then, instead of having to bother constantly picking coconuts, we could just fetch water from there.I was trying to find it because I actually knew that it existed somewhere around here. Of course, I didn\u2019t exactly know where it was.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dI had to somehow get through this thick forest, so my stamina consumption was extremely high. In fact, it was highly difficult to even make ten consecutive steps. Of course, my path wasn\u2019t completely covered in vines, so I could navigate myself quite well.After walking for some time, I finally came to a halt.I might end up exhausted and unable to move, so I decided to go back first, after I cleared a significant portion of the path.-Kwiiiiiik!And then the cry of some animal rang out from somewhere.Seeing that it was screaming, it didn\u2019t seem like this was normal. I looked towards the direction the cry came from and saw someone running through the jungle chasing something.-Fling!-Kwiiiik!The scream of the beast was getting louder as someone was chasing after it with a bow, shooting arrows at it, and actually hitting.It was a girl with long braided hair fluttering behind her, who was running through the forest like a squirrel.It was B-9, Delphine Izadra who had an archery talent.-Fllling! Fling!-Kweeeek!Apparently the chased beast had fallen, as the girl holding a bow also stopped her charge.Not only was she able to rush through the jungle as if she was flying, she was also able to shoot down a beast that was running with all its might.She was Ludwig\u2019s best friend as well as one of the main heroines of this novel.\u201c\u2026\u2026How can I take this back?\u201dShe caught something, but it seemed like she didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d take it back.\u201cHey, should I help you?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Huh? Who\u2019s there?\u201dDelphine was startled when she suddenly heard an unfamiliar voice. When she saw it was me, her expression softened slightly.\u201cA-Ah\u2026 Reinhardt\u2026 That was you just now, right?\u201dI frequently came to Class B\u2019s dorm, so even if we didn\u2019t talk directly, she had at least seen my face before.\u201cWhat? Did you catch that big thing?\u201dIt was a pig-like thing, almost the size of a large dog. It had been hit by four arrows, and one of them was lodged in its head.\u201cIf it\u2019s too hard for you to carry alone, I could help you.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. Yes, please! Thank you.\u201dShe caught it, but wasn\u2019t sure how to carry it back, so she felt quite fortunate meeting me here.* * *She and I took a short break while dragging the dead pig behind us.\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s quite heavy\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dHow could it be so difficult to move a dead beast?\u201cYour archery is no joke, you know?\u201dTo be exact, it was amazing how she was able to run around and shoot arrows at the same time. Delphine smiled at my words.\u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYep, I\u2019m from Talprad. Almost everyone there learns how to hunt from a young age.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Is that so?\u201dOf course, this was something I was already aware of.Delphine Izadra came from a long line of hunters, calling the mountainous country, Talprad, located in the northern part of the Empire, their home. Talprad was quite known for every citizen to know how to use a bow, and even among them, Delphine was considered a prodigy.That was why she was able to enter Temple\u2019s Royal Class with only her archery talent.She had been out hunting ever since she was a child, moving through rough terrain, so she took to this situation like a fish to water.Although she only had her archery right now, she\u2019d later become able to use an unusual power called Spirit Magic.In fact, there was this setting that the hunters of Talprad actually inherited the blood of elves, who had been annihilated a long time ago. Delphine inherited their powers the strongest, so she had tremendous talent for archery, as well as an affinity with spirits, which would develop later on.Of course, it would still take a long time for her to awaken that talent.Seeing as she was best friends with Ludwig, she was quite the kind and affable person. It didn\u2019t seem like she was scared of me or anything. I mean, she did see me frequenting Class B\u2019s dorm quite often, after all.\u201cWhat are you guys up to? Is everything going well?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019re doing this and that, but I have no idea how it\u2019ll turn out.\u201d\u201cReally? There are so many outstanding students in Class A, so I\u2019m sure everything will turn out well.\u201dOriginally, Class A and B were supposed to be bitter enemies. However, because I tanked all the aggro since the start of the school year, the students from Class A didn\u2019t hate Class B all that much, even though they still looked down on them a bit. The students of Class B didn\u2019t hate Class A because they were just that good-natured.So, the relationship between the two classes wasn\u2019t as bad as in the original, or actually it wasn\u2019t bad at all, so that was why we were able to casually ask questions like that during this cooperative mission.As Delphine said, Class A was definitely full of bright people. However, they were just as whiny as they were talented, so I was rather uncertain about the outcome.\u201cAfter tonight, I bet there\u2019ll be more than one or two kids that will feel like they\u2019re about to die.\u201d\u201cReally? Well\u2026 You\u2019re right. I\u2019m used to camping, but I\u2019m still worried about the others.\u201dDelphine had hunted a lot in the past, so she was used to sleeping in the open. However, she was worried about the others, who weren\u2019t as experienced. That was why she jumped into the forest right away to secure some food.After taking some breaks in between, we were finally able to drag the pig to the beach where Class B\u2019s camp was located.\u201cPhew\u2026 Good job. Thank you, Reinhardt.\u201dDelphine smiled brightly as she stepped on the beach. If she had been alone, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to bring the pig along.\u201cWha\u2026 Wh-What is this?\u201dAll the Class B kids, who had been struggling to create a camp, were shocked to see that a pig had been caught.\u201cWow\u2026 How did you do this?\u2026Huh? Reinhardt? What brings you here?\u201dAnd just as Bertus was leading Class A, Charlotte was leading Class B. She smiled seeing the pig we dragged here, but she was just as surprised seeing me here.* * *With her wavy, pretty, blonde hair tied up in a ponytail, she walked around with the sleeves of her shirt and the legs of her pants rolled up.Seeing that her palms were also quite dirty, it seemed like she was also actively participating.\u201cAh, we met inside the jungle, and he helped me move that thing. If I had been alone, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to drag it all the way here.\u201dAt Delphine\u2019s words, the expressions on the Class B students\u2019 faces, Charlotte\u2019s included, became strange.He did what now?That was what everyone\u2019s expression was saying.Charlotte just sighed heavily and smiled.\u201cReinhardt\u2026 Although this is a cooperative mission, it\u2019s still a competition. How could you just go and help the other team?\u201dShe rebuked her opponent for helping her. I laughed at Charlotte\u2019s words.\u201cNo way. How could I work without receiving anything in return?\u201dCharlotte burst into laughter when I asked them if I could take one of the pig\u2019s legs as a reward.\u201cWhat do you mean, reward? So you did have ulterior motives after all, huh? Well, Delphine caught it, so the decision is hers to make.\u201dDelphine froze up, hearing Charlotte\u2019s words.\u201cWell\u2026 Sure, we already have enough anyway.\u201dDelphine pointed towards the beach and chuckled.-Woah!-Guuuuuys! I caught another ooooone!\u201cBecause a certain idiot is about to gather enough food for the whole week in just a single day.\u201dI could see Ludwig holding a big fish stuck on a javelin, shouting excitedly.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Delphine did the dismantling herself. Perhaps because she had hunted a lot in the past, she was also good at handling knives. There were some who watched her with interest, and others who couldn\u2019t watch her because the scene was too gory.Even though I\u2019d much rather not watch, I kept my eyes on her, trying to internalize how she was doing it.I mean, there was no one among Class A\u2019s precious kids who could do something like this. I didn\u2019t either, so I watched.\u201cWow\u2026 Is it as difficult as it looks?\u201d\u201cHmm, definitely. I don\u2019t know how to do it properly either. I\u2019m just trying to follow what the adults did before.\u201dAfter removing the pig\u2019s intestines, Delphine hung the pig upside down and slit its neck to remove the blood. She naturally removed the arrow from its skull as well.I felt kind of sick, seeing the blood dripping down its throat. Delphine, who did this by herself, had her hands completely stained in blood.But this was\u2026I knew it would be fine.However, there were no parasites in there, right? Although I set it up as there being \u201cno such problems\u201d, was it really fine? We could just eat it if we cooked it well, right?\u201cIt takes some time to remove the blood and skin. If you come by later, I\u2019ll give you your share.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? Okay then.\u201dAs I was about to go back, Ludwig came over with his shirt off and a javelin with a fish stuck on it in his hand, his eyes wide open in surprise.\u201cWoah\u2026 Delphine! What\u2019s going on here? Urgh! There\u2019s so much blood. Huh? Reinhardt?\u201dHe seemed to be a little surprised to find me here.\u201cWelcome. Do you want some fish? To be honest, I think we got a bit too much.\u201dOf course, our kind-hearted Ludwig just gave me the fish he caught not too long ago.No one even seemed to care that he wanted to give that fish to me.When I looked over to their bonfire, I could see fish stuck on skewers getting grilled. B-2 Louis Ankton was watching over them, with an expression on his face that seemed to say: \u201cWhy do I have to do this?\u201dIt definitely looked like they had a lot.This survival mission was originally intended to show that Class B was stronger in praxis. It was supposed to showcase that even though Class A had a lot of talented students, they were rather reluctant to do tough jobs, while the students of Class B, who were seen as less talented, knew better how to make the best use of what they got.That\u2019s right.There were many practically inclined kids in Class B. There wasn\u2019t anyone among them that would go: \u201cOh my, why should my noble self have to do something like this?\u201d. Hence, it was pretty much inevitable that they would perform better than Class A.\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll eat it well.\u201dLudwig smiled at my words, saying that I should tell him if we didn\u2019t have enough.\u201cJeez. Looks like everyone has forgotten that this is a competition.\u201dSeeing this, Charlotte only shook her head, but I could see that her eyes contained some joy.\u201cCome get the meat later!\u201dDelphine shouted as I was on my way back.It seemed that her preconceived notions about me had been completely erased after I merely helped her move that pig.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201c\u2026\u2026How did you get that?\u201dBertus had a rather sickly expression when I told him that I was given that fish.\u201cUh, they just said that they had too many.\u201d\u201cHow did you get to their camp?\u201d\u201cAh, Delphine caught a pig in the jungle, and I helped her carry it back because it was too heavy for her. So we decided that I would get part of its meat later on.\u201d\u201cThere are normal pet pigs in there?\u201dBertus seemed shocked that there were pigs in the jungle, before he could even process that I helped Class B. It was the same for the others.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that there are dangerous animals in there? What if we get attacked late at night?\u201dIt was Cayer whining around.Hey, buddy, pigs aren\u2019t exactly \u2018dangerous animals\u2019, however, wild boars could be pretty dangerous.\u201cIt seems like we have to keep watch at night then.\u201dEver since he heard that there were pigs inside the jungle, Bertus seemed to have become very vigilant already.\u201cOkay, Reinhardt, well\u2026 Securing that raw meat itself is indeed beneficial.\u201dDeciding not to think about it any further, Bertus seemed to have chosen to think that it was a good thing that I helped Class B secure more food for our class.\u201cBy the way, is it ready?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty much complete.\u201dIt didn\u2019t entirely look like home yet.\u201cIt\u2019s quite surprising that making something like that was much more realistic than I initially thought.\u201dHarriet was sweating profusely, but she still continued to cut logs with her magic.They constructed it by putting the wooden logs they had cut against each other. Like a camera tripod. The main pillar was reinforced by tying vines around it to prevent everything from collapsing, and the sides were bound together by vines as well. Then palm leaves were inserted to create walls.\u201cI think about two people can sleep in there at the same time.\u201dI nodded at Adelia\u2019s words. It was cramped, but it was enough for two people to sleep in there. Since we were eleven people, we had to make either six more or five more, leaving three people to share a single hut.If we tried to construct larger huts, there was a bigger risk of them collapsing, so it seemed like the right choice to make smaller ones. Adelia seemed to have a lot of things to worry about.\u201cRain will probably leak through the roof\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to bear with that.\u201dMaking a completely waterproof cabin in this situation was pretty much impossible. Just knowing that we now had a place to lie down in and rest was good enough. Adelia seemed to be struggling with how to make this place a more bearable environment for us.\u201cStill, if we were able to cut the logs into planks, we might be able to make something similar to flooring.\u201dOf course, the only problem was that Harriet had to do that all alone. I passed the construction site and headed to the beach.There was our person responsible for the fire, Heinrich von Schwarz, keeping the simple distillation device running. In this sweltering heat, he continuously picked up firewood to keep the bonfire running, and lit the fire again if it ever went out.Perhaps it was because of the heat; but his face, that usually had a vain look to it, seemed rather ripe. He just continued to stare on with dissatisfaction, too tired to even argue.The small pot was hanging in the bigger pot and had quite a bit of water in it. It wasn\u2019t enough to drink, but he had to keep it running so that everyone wouldn\u2019t run out of water. He just had to hold on until I found the water source in the jungle.\u201cWhat\u2019s with the fish?\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d\u201cYou got it?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI put the fish on a large palm leaf as a substitute for a chopping board and started to fillet it.I didn\u2019t know how to do it exactly, but I had a rough idea.-Chop!\u201cUrgh!\u201dWhen I chopped off the fish\u2019s head, Heinrich freaked out. Ignoring the last struggles of the flopping fish, I gutted it.I removed the bladder and intestines, then descaled it.I wasn\u2019t sure what kind of fish this was, but it should be edible. It kind of looked like a sea bream.Heinrich looked at me, terrified, as I calmly cut up the fish next to him.I put the fish on a skewer I prepared beforehand, and stuck it into the ground next to the bonfire on which the pot was steaming.\u201cTell me when it\u2019s done. It\u2019s going to take some time. Oh, and if there\u2019s any salt in that pot, collect it. We don\u2019t have any condiments, so we should at least put some salt on it.\u201d\u201cH-Huh\u2026 Okay.\u201dThe one with the knife in his hand was indeed the boss, so Heinrich replied straight away.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Everyone worked as if they were possessed, even if they didn\u2019t have much motivation, so time went by quickly.The water canteens, which everyone received one of, were immediately emptied.However, we still had the distilled water, and since Kono Lint had continued to harvest some coconuts, we had sufficient ways to keep us hydrated.\u201c\u2026\u2026It doesn\u2019t taste as delicious as it looks.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s delicious, though.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only because of the heat, that\u2019s all.\u201dKono Lint and Erich expressed their opinions about the taste of the coconuts. Whether they liked it or not, they had to keep drinking from them until we found a new water source.Fortunately, Liana de Grantz was able to stun a few more fish by electrocuting them, although she still couldn\u2019t touch them. Nevertheless, we were able to get a total of five fish that day.So, on the first day, at sunset, after we finished constructing the camp, we made a big bonfire in the middle of it and started grilling the fish and lobster. I also started grilling the pig legs I obtained from Class B.I sprinkled everything with salt before grilling them.\u201c\u2026There are no\u2026 forks and knives.\u201dHarriet muttered softly with a sullen expression on her face.\u201cWhat do you expect in a place where we have to use leaves as plates?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven though I criticized her like that, Harriet didn\u2019t even answer; that was how depressed she was. Even though she was in that much of a daze, she actually worked the hardest today. Without her magic, it might not have been possible to construct this camp.Harriet just looked towards the distant shore and pouted.\u201cWhat are those guys even doing? What is so fun about this?!\u201dAt Class B\u2019s camp, after their food was ready, most of them jumped right into the sea and played around. No matter what the future might hold for them, they\u2019d do their best to enjoy it.We, on the other hand, were just sitting around the bonfire somberly. Even though everyone was hungry and we actually had some food, they didn\u2019t really look like they looked forward to eating it.\u201cEveryone, I understand that you are having a hard time. I know you find it unpleasant sleeping here and eating things like this.\u201dIn the end, Bertus had to step forward.\u201cHowever, this is our first group mission. We don\u2019t know what other missions we have to face in the future, but we still shouldn\u2019t fail our very first mission, right?\u201dHe was smiling, but everyone knew that Bertus was one of the people who suffered the most under these conditions, so there was no one who dared to make a fuss in front of him.Bertus picked up a skewered fish, ate a little of it to make sure it wasn\u2019t too hot, and began to properly bite into it.Everyone stared blankly at the Imperial Prince, eating a fish like a beggar on a deserted island.\u201cIt\u2019s good to eat.\u201dBertus smiled with fish oil around his mouth.\u201cSo, let\u2019s eat.\u201dBertus chose to take the first step to stop the high-and-mighty nobles of Class A from being fussy.Maybe it was fine, even if he was someone who wore a perfect mask on his face as well as on his heart. Charlotte was someone like that as well, after all.I really didn\u2019t know anymore.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Bertus distributed the cooked food to all the class members. He knew, after all, that they\u2019d have to eat it, if it was something he gave to them.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet took a bite out of the gigantic lobster\u2019s meat, then her eyes widened. She then looked at Adelia, who was seated next to her, and ate the same thing.Both of them looked surprised. They probably felt the same way.I was pretty sure that both of them had eaten lobster before, but they probably had never eaten one of such a monstrous size before.\u201cI feel kind of bad because he was right\u2026\u201dHarriet murmured in a rather desperate tone, feeling a sense of defeat, probably because she found the lobster delicious. Although it was huge, if divided in 11 pieces, it was just a small amount of food. While she ate only half of the fish Bertus gave her, it seemed like she liked the lobster a lot.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt looked like she was slowly regaining her appetite.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cEat it.\u201dI gave Harriet a wooden skewer with bundled lobster meat on it. Her eyes widened.\u201cW-Why are you giving this to me?\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t ask me stupid questions, just eat it. I have no energy to argue with you.\u201dWhen I forcibly shoved it towards her, she accepted it silently.She suffered the most today. She was also the one least used to this kind of environment. She would continue to have a hard time during this mission, so I decided to take care of her a bit.Even if one felt sad and depressed, you should still eat well if one had food sitting before yourself.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet seemed thoroughly exhausted; she simply began to nibble on the lobster meat I gave her.And then.\u201cEllen? Where are you going so suddenly?\u201dEllen Artorius suddenly jumped up from where she sat and walked off somewhere. Bertus, seemingly surprised, called Ellen, but she didn\u2019t answer him. She just picked up a javelin and eventually ran off.\u201cWha\u2026 What is she doing\u2026?`\u201dHarriet looked towards Ellen, who suddenly jumped into the sea, colored red by the sunset.\u201cSomething great.\u201dI kind of knew what she was doing.About 30 minutes later, Ellen Artorius came back with three similar lobsters as the one we just ate on her javelin.\u201cWha\u2026 What is she?\u201dEveryone started to reevaluate the pretty Ellen, looking at her with shocked eyes.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96In the end, thanks to Ellen, who spontaneously went on an evening hunt, everyone was able to stuff themselves with lobster meat.Lobster just tasted better than grilled fish or the chewy pig legs, which irritated those nobles\u2019 picky taste buds.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m full\u2026\u201dAt that moment, everyone felt so blessed, even while they were still stuck on this uninhabited island and undergoing a survival mission.Of course, Ellen was still eating the wild boar meat, slicing it with a knife.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Ellen. We lived thanks to you.\u201dBertus smiled after finishing his food with a satisfied expression on his face, then Ellen pointed towards the beach.\u201cThere were a lot of very big clams as well.\u201d\u201cOh really? That\u2019s good.\u201dIt looked like she was already thinking about what to eat tomorrow.Pigs ate while thinking about what they\u2019d eat next.Everyone probably thought that Ellen was a calm and capable person, but, in reality, they didn\u2019t actually know all that much about Ellen.But today, they got to know Ellen a bit more.They saw her suddenly jumping up after eating, silently, going to the beach to hunt. That was how they found out that she was actually pretty good at hunting. When she was helping chop the wood, they witnessed just how powerful her axe swings were.-MunchThey also got to know her bottomless appetite.Up until now, they might have thought that she ate slightly more than others when we sat together in the dining hall, but today they got to see just how much she could eat.\u201cI\u2026 I did see her eat before, but she sure does eat a lot.\u201dHarriet muttered blankly. She felt strange that Ellen still managed to maintain her monstrous appetite even in this kind of situation.\u201cHey, eat this.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026 What is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s edible. Try it.\u201dHarriet carefully took a bite out of that thing that looked like a white squid leg, then her expression turned bizarre.\u201cW-What is this? Is this coconut?\u201d\u201cYeah. You shouldn\u2019t waste any food.\u201dHarriet, who ate some coconut flesh, swallowed after chewing on it a bit. Everyone just stared at me while I was eating the coconut\u2019s insides.\u201cYou can eat this too, so don\u2019t just throw it away. Use a knife or something to cut it out and eat it.\u201dThen, one by one, they drank some coconut water with rather exhausted and casual expressions, and began to collect the empty shells.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The sun set completely, transitioning to night.\u201cEveryone worked hard today. Don\u2019t go out into the forest at night. It\u2019s dangerous. Let\u2019s just stay around the beach. Those who want to sleep early should go sleep first.\u201dAs soon as we finished eating, Bertus naturally started to take control of his classmates.\u201cAnd we will set up a night patrol. We don\u2019t know what might happen. I think it would be best if we take turns standing guard. We\u2019ll switch after 1 hour has passed. Although I\u2019m not sure how to measure time in this place\u2026\u201dI heard that one can tell the time by watching the night sky, but do we have anyone here who can do that?\u201cI think\u2026it\u2019s about 8pm right now.\u201dAdelia, who had been blankly staring at the sky, piped up.\u201cOh, you\u2019re able to tell the time. That\u2019s a relief. Then, let\u2019s make 10pm our official bedtime. From that time on, every hour, one of us will stand guard in order of our class number. Adelia can\u2019t keep checking the time, so I shall leave the measuring of the time to each of you.\u201dIn other words: \u201cEnd your shift when you think it has been an hour.\u201dThat might seem rather vague, but there was no other way.Going by that, Bertus would be the first to stand guard, and I\u2019d be the last. I mean, being last didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d be standing guard at all.\u201cNow, everyone, just keep in mind that you shouldn\u2019t go into the forest. Those who don\u2019t have to stand guard should try to sleep well, and those that are to stand guard, try to rest.\u201dIn this extreme situation, he had to spend the first night struggling to control and soothe these mentally exhausted children.The most weary one out of all of us would probably be no one else, but Bertus though.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Most of my classmates must have been extremely exhausted, both mentally and physically. Therefore, even the kids who asked how they would be able to even sleep in something like this, or what they\u2019d do if insects got in there, went into that cramped tripod hut, but didn\u2019t come out again.They probably fell asleep as soon as they lay down on the floor. Fatigue could beat anything.As for Heinrich, he was still managing the fire, making distilled water, and filling the emptied canteens.As he spent the day, he realized just how important water was, so that was probably why he came to think that what he was doing was very important.It was a moonless night, so one could see a huge amount of stars. It looked like the Milky Way.I moved closer to the beach and sat down. I watched the clear water and the night sky.This really was a scenery to kill for. Now I was finally able to enjoy this landscape with a little less to worry about.Class B\u2019s camp still looked really lively. It almost seemed like they came here for the sole purpose of playing around.\u201cPhew\u2026 Why are these guys wasting their stamina like that?\u201d-SlumpBertus sat next to me after he saw me sitting here.\u201cLooks like they still have a lot of energy left.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 I envy them.\u201dWhat Bertus said was rather vague. Maybe he was envious of them for being able to enjoy this situation so much, or that they still had so much energy left to play till this late at night.\u201cReinhardt, you did well today.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIf not for you and Ellen suddenly going into the jungle, we all would have given up right then and there.\u201dAs soon as I took some abrupt actions,\u00a0the kids, who had been set on giving up, faltered, and above all, Bertus stopped thinking of giving up.\u201cOne side is constantly crying \u2018Why does my noble self have to do this? How could that make any sense\u2019\u2026I was like that as well\u2026 And then we have the other side, that seems so excited by all this, that it makes it seem as if they came here for vacation and having the time of their life\u2026\u201dClass A, who was uncomfortable with this.Class B, who was thoroughly enjoying this.Even Bertus could feel this gap now.\u201c\u2026This isn\u2019t even a competition anymore.\u201dHe smiled bitterly. We were struggling while they were enjoying this. The result of the mission seemed quite obvious, even if the mission had only just begun.In a way, he looked kind of weak. It seemed like Bertus was so mentally exhausted to the point that he had to say such things. Although it was a fabricated situation, in the end, getting food, clean clothing and shelter were very difficult on this uninhabited island.However, Bertus would never admit that he was stressed out because of this inconvenient situation.If he did, he would admit that he was merely that small of a human being. It would hurt his pride.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to have you here.\u201dThat certainly sounded sincere.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Class A consisted of 7 boys and 4 girls.There were 6 completed huts.So two people had to share one hut, but one of the huts could be inhabited by just one person. That hut went to Bertus. He was playing the role of the leader in this situation; moreover, he was a Prince after all.Of course, everyone knew that this wasn\u2019t the best.It was still early in the morning. Cayer Vioden, the one standing guard before me, woke me up. It was obvious that he had major problems sleeping in a place like this.\u201cKeep filling the pot with water, and if you notice anything dangerous, wake everyone up, also don\u2019t turn out the fire. That\u2019s all you gotta do.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe still hated me, but I didn\u2019t care about that guy anymore. Honestly, from my point of view, he was nothing more than a small fry, so I didn\u2019t really like or hate him.The fire was still burning as the one on guard would keep it running. As I saw Cayer crawling into his hut, I left mine and threw the remaining wood into the fire.I didn\u2019t have to wake anyone else up because I was the last on guard duty. Well, there wasn\u2019t any set wake-up time, so there was no need for me to wake anyone up just because it was bright outside. They\u2019d just have to wake up on their own.The huts were built circularly around the bonfire.The six bell shaped huts had their entrances slightly obscured by palm leaves, but one could still look into them a little.Everyone was sleeping in them as if dead. After pouring some seawater into the pot, and replenishing the firewood, I had nothing more to do.How long has it been?-Rustle.I could hear a rustling sound coming from one of the huts, then I saw someone poking their head out of the entrance.\u201cDid you see anything?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dA disheveled Liana de Grantz appeared from her hut.She crawled out of it and staggered to her feet. Her whole body seemed to creak. Why did she come out, when she evidently hadn\u2019t slept enough?Then she suddenly started walking towards the forest.\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201dShe ignored my words and just walked in silence.\u201cDon\u2019t go into the jungle. It\u2019s still dark outside.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Why are you talking\u2026\u201d-Clasp!I grabbed her arm. Then she violently shook me off and looked at me.Her eyes seemed so cold, as if she could freeze me by just looking at me.What\u2019s going on?Did I do something wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go shit. Are we done?\u201dWith that, she disappeared into the jungle, seeming like she would kill me if I were to speak to her any longer. It was probably very urgent, seeing as she blurted it out like that.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The girl that went on her merry way to shit, didn\u2019t come back.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201dI quietly mumbled to myself in front of the campfire. Did something happen to her? Or was she just constipated?If something happened to her, I would have to go to help her, but what if I just ended up embarrassing her? Wouldn\u2019t that leave a permanent scar on the young lady\u2019s psyche?No, but wasn\u2019t it really strange for her to not come back after more than 20 minutes had passed? I didn\u2019t hear her scream, though. Or was she just too tired and fell asleep right when she did her business?No, that can\u2019t be.Or maybe?Was there really a problem?I got up from where I sat and walked towards the jungle.Maybe she was just too embarrassed to say that she had a problem.\u201cIf you\u2019re alright, spark once! If there\u2019s a problem, spark twice! If you don\u2019t do anything, I\u2019ll just go in!\u201dIt was quiet for a while.And then.-Brzzt! Brzzt!I could see electric sparks flickering in the forest. Did she go in that deep?She was still conscious, but something was wrong.I had a feeling what it was.\u201cOh, erm. Do you need something to clean your\u2026\u201d-Brzzt!As soon as I got there, sparks flashed before me.That idiot just went in without thinking about that matter because she had to go urgently, but now she realized that there was nothing to clean herself with.\u201cHey! Just wipe it off with a nearby leaf! There isn\u2019t much else here!\u201d-Brzzt! Brzzt! Brzzt! Brzzt! Brzzt!I didn\u2019t really know what she meant with that, but what I could read out of it was that I shouldn\u2019t talk nonsense. There wasn\u2019t any toilet paper here, you know?\u00a0She should ask for something more reasonable.\u201cOr do you want me to get you some seawater?\u201d-\u2026\u2026.After some silence.-Brzzt!She sparked once.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I put some seawater in the medium-sized pot, went close to the spot where I believed her to be, and carefully placed it down.\u201c\u2026\u2026You can use it. But be careful\u2026 We still need it to cook and stuff\u2026 Okay?\u201dThere was no reply, but we just tacitly agreed.After some time, Liana emerged with an empty pot.She looked like someone, who had their base dignity as a human being severely trampled on.This must have been an unbearable experience for the young lady, someone who grew up protected and held dear by her family.What the hell did these guys even think, giving them that kind of mission? It should have been her who felt most embarrassed about this, but here I felt even more ashamed on her behalf.As if she walked forward like a marionette controlled by somebody else, she began to sob and went towards the beach, not even looking at me.Then she just silently washed the pot in the sea.Her butt was slightly wet.\u201cI\u2026 want to give up.\u201dThat was what she told me as she put the pot back in its original place.The pot was definitely well-cleaned.But I decided I won\u2019t eat from it anyway.Never.That was the resolution I made.Anyway, after she did something like that, it seemed like she fully realized our current reality.A seventeen-year-old girl who came from a noble family, never worrying about money, had to go through something like this. I couldn\u2019t even ask her to not give up.I mean, even Bertus would feel the same way.\u201cWell\u2026 Erm, wouldn\u2019t it be a waste to give up after you\u2019ve done something like this?\u201dIf you didn\u2019t want to do something like that, you should\u2019ve just given up sooner. At my words, Liana looked at me with a clear expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cY-Yeah. I mean, wouldn\u2019t it be rather unfair if you gave up after suffering like that, making your suffering invalid?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLooking at Liana, I realized that if she felt so ashamed it went even beyond shame, her face wouldn\u2019t blush, she\u2019d just get very quiet.\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve already defiled my body\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dShe suddenly made such a self-deprecating comment and then crept back into her hut.Resignation, conviction, and self-suggestion.I was looking at an unprecedented phenomenon in which someone found conviction out of desperation.I already rolled in shit. I\u2019m already dirty. So what does it matter anymore?What level of self-suggestion even was this?-SniffleAfter a while, I could hear something that sounded like snoring from Liana\u2019s hut, but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was actually snoring or crying.Just what is shit\u2026?I was contemplating such things under the beautiful night sky dotted with brilliant stars.It was a rather thought-provoking night.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Then, after a long time passed.-RustleI heard rustling from another hut. From it someone appeared.\u201cR-Reinhardt\u2026.\u201dIt was none other than Harriet who suddenly called out to me.She was staring at me with a look on her face, as if she was about to cry.\u201cW-What should I do\u2026?\u201cShe looked at me as if this matter was pretty urgent. Even so, it seemed like she thought that I would absolutely help her out after I took care of her for a bit. I didn\u2019t know if it was because of her useless pride, but looking at her face, it seemed like she wanted to ask me to do something. She didn\u2019t say anything at first, however.That look was also quite cute, but in a different way. A bit pitiable.There was nothing more difficult than having to watch Harriet being like that.\u201cTh-This is\u2026?\u201d\u201cGet some water.\u201dI quietly put a medium-sized pot into her hands.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97The Demon Prince goes to the Academy[Translator \u2013 KonnoAren ][Proofreader \u2013 TheDarkBreaker ]Chapter 97That girl was so afraid of going alone into the forest, she just stood there in front of it for a considerable amount of time.And she kept looking back at me.I knew she wanted to ask me if I could go with her, but she also knew that much worse things would happen if we were to go in together.Eventually Harriet went alone into the jungle.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet, who was prone to blushing, returned with a staggering complexion after she finished.She also quietly went to the beach, washed the pot thoroughly, and, seeming as if she gave up on everything, put the pot back in its place.This pot.Shall never be used.\u201c\u2026I-if you tease me with this\u2026. If you make fun of me, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really, really going to kill myself .\u201dI didn\u2019t say anything to her, but Harriet, who felt like she stepped in a trap, just looked at me.Tears pooled in the corner of her eyes while her face was completely white. She seemed exhausted. I could clearly feel her sense of shame just by Harriet saying that she\u2019d kill herself if I were to tease her rather than kill me.If you tease me with this I\u2019m going to kill myself. Do you really want to see me die? Do you hate me that much?That was the type of expression Harriet showed me.I had no intention of teasing her with this. If I were to tease her, I might hurt her for real.I mean I am a bastard, but I\u2019m not that much of a bastard.\u201cHuh? Did something happen? If you have no business here anymore you should go to sleep.\u201dAs she saw me pretending as if nothing happened, Harriet eventually shed some tears.\u201cThank you\u2026.\u201dHarriet wiped at her eyes with her hands.No, you\u2026That hand.Well.I shouldn\u2019t make fun of her even if it was just in my mind.*\u00a0*\u00a0*When people were subjected to extreme stress in an environment they were completely unfamiliar with, there were usually two things that happened.They either get an upset stomach, or get constipated.In general, these things happen a lot in military training centers. It wasn\u2019t all that uncommon for said constipation to last for more than a week.Some guys, who were lactose intolerant, just got an upset stomach because of all the milk they had to drink in the morning. Of course, there were also some that just got a stomach ache.So, at this point, it was only natural that the students with stomach aches would end up in a very embarrassing situation. Having eaten food that\u00a0 they weren\u2019t familiar with, surely upset their stomach even further. The ones that only ended up with constipation felt rather grateful.I was prone to it as well. Strangely enough, that fact hadn\u2019t changed, even after my body changed completely. Of course, I never described any of this while I was writing this novel.However, as soon as this became reality, I came to a realization.The hardest thing in this group mission wasn\u2019t actually survival, but pooping.How gracious it was to have toilet paper.What a blessing it was to have fresh underwear to change into.That morning.Those who had been shamed by having to do their business like that seemed to be mentally exhausted in a different way from yesterday. Their expressions were ash white as if they were completely burned out.The female students seemed to feel particularly embarrassed.Of course, there was also the desperate wish to wash up etched into their faces. I was the same.\u201cWhat? Did something happen last night?\u201dBertus looked at Liana and Harriet, whose expressions were the worst, and asked if they were sick.\u201cHuh? Ah. No\u2026. Sleeping was just uncomfortable. That\u2019s all\u2026.\u201d\u201cNothing happened.\u201dAs they turned around, they didn\u2019t look at Bertus, but me.Harriet looked at me as if she was pleading \u2018Please! Please don\u2019t tell anyone!\u2019.Liana wore a determined expression as if she was trying to tell me that if rumors about this started to float around, either me or her had to give up their life.It was true that I was a bad guy, but I wasn\u2019t that bad.I think, by the time I acknowledged that I was a bad guy I\u2019ve already screwed up.\u201cShould we boil the leftover meat from yesterday for breakfast today? I don\u2019t think we can just eat it. It\u2019s probably too hard.\u201dKono Lint said as such while holding the medium sized pot.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dMe, Liana and Harriet.The three of us shouted towards him at the same time.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Ellen, who swam out into the sea last night and caught three lobsters, and I , who was able to swim, were put in charge of catching fish. Liana\u2019s style of catching fish by waiting for them to come by and electrocute them, took much too long.\u201cAre you going out into the sea?\u201dHarriet called out to me and Ellen when we were about to go into the sea.\u201cYeah, we need to get some food for breakfast.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you good at swimming?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m particularly good at it, but I know how to do it.\u201dHarriet had a slightly reddened face. Apparently, during this group mission, her perception of me was changing rapidly.\u201cDo\u2026. Do you maybe need something like\u2026erm\u201dHarriet looked at me and Ellen alternately as she spoke.\u201cLike underwater breathing magic.\u201dOh.You should\u2019ve told me sooner that you could do that.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Harriet put an underwater breathing spell on me and Ellen. She said it would last about 30 to 40 minutes.It felt strange, being able to breathe underwater. It didn\u2019t feel like water was flowing into my lungs. It was a hard to describe feeling.However, if the magic were to suddenly wear off at an inconvenient moment, wouldn\u2019t I swallow all the water and drown?Let\u2019s plan in some time to resurface.It wasn\u2019t too difficult for me to open my eyes underwater.Both me and Ellen knew how to swim, and we had the underwater breathing magic cast on us, so we could dive in a little deeper.Then, this spectacular underwater scenery filled with coral reefs unfolded before us. For a moment, I felt like I wanted to stop to take in this scene.Ellen gently swam under the sea, letting her limbs and waist run idle, beginning to pick up the abalones attached to rocks.Ellen looked like a mermaid as she moved through the water.It was pretty, but she was also able to move through the water just as freely as one.She really was good at everything no matter what she did.Her swimming prowess went beyond only good, they even felt elegant.-?Ellen looked at me with her head tilted when she noticed that I wasn\u2019t picking up any clams.I shook my head, trying to tell her that it was nothing. I mean, I would just stand around staring blankly sometimes.I picked up some abalone and clams, and then put them into a net Adelia had woven out of vines yesterday. I didn\u2019t bother picking up the ones that were too small, because they obviously would slip out.I hoped we would catch some lobsters as the other kids ate them without complaining, but we didn\u2019t see any at all.Wandering through the jungle required a lot of stamina, but moving underwater wasn\u2019t easy either.If it weren\u2019t for the underwater breathing magic, it would have taken me twice as much stamina. I could feel again that Harriet\u2019s talent, which enabled her to use any type of magic skillfully no matter from which field, was truly amazing.I continued to collect abalone and clams. If I came across a big fish, I\u2019d try to stab it, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any in this area.And.I saw Ellen fumbling around a ledge when suddenly a camouflaged octopus appeared.It tried to get away by shooting out jets of water,\u00a0 but Ellen reflexively stabbed it with her javelin.-?Ellen tilted her head as she looked at the octopus she unwittingly hunted.She showed me the end of her javelin from which it was hanging.-Caught a monster.She mouthed to me underwater. Apparently, that was the first time in her life seeing an octopus.*\u00a0*\u00a0*It was only natural that everyone else was shocked by the giant octopus\u2019 appearance.\u201cHi-hiiiiiiik!\u201d\u201cI feel like throwing up\u2026.\u201dHarriet, her expression completely pale, couldn\u2019t even look at it, and Liana just staggered into the jungle feeling nauseous after seeing it.\u201c\u2026\u2026I know it\u2019s edible, but seeing it now, I don\u2019t feel like I can eat that.\u201dBertus had eaten octopus before, but seeing a live one made him a bit reluctant to eat it.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat it, suit yourself. I\u2019ll just eat it on my own.\u201dAdditionally, we caught a lot of clams, including abalone, so they could just grill those to eat.I picked up the octopus by the head, removed its intestines, and rubbed salt on it. Since we had quite a bit of salt, there was no problem with me using it for something like this.Ellen was watching me wash the octopus with sea water.\u201cIs that delicious?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. I think it is.\u201dIt seemed like Ellen didn\u2019t really care for its appearance, all she needed to know was if it was tasty or not.After cleaning the octopus, I returned to camp. At my request, Adelia and Harriet cut a large stone into a plate shape using their processing magic. It was a stone grill. After fixing it in a suitable position, Heinrich collected some firewood and set fire under the rock.When the clean stone grill gradually dried up due to the heat, I placed the clams, abalone, and octopus on top of it.-Sizzle!\u201cUrg! It\u2019s gross!\u201dEveryone watched the octopus twisting on the grill with terrified expressions on their faces.In the end, it was just me and Ellen who helped themselves to the octopus.*\u00a0*\u00a0*We set up a camp, and finding food wasn\u2019t that difficult using underwater breathing magic.However, we were still busy.Because humans, when their most basic needs are satisfied, crave to reach the next level.-Craack!\u201cSigh\u2026. We barely made one\u2026.\u201dThe camp was completed, but we were now trying to upgrade it. After spending a day here, they all came to the same conclusion. That they felt extremely uncomfortable, because of the floor\u2019s moisture.So, our current goal was to cut some logs in half and stick them together to make flooring and put the tents on top of them. Most of the trees were cut down with magic by our two magic officials Harriet and Adelia, but the others were also busy picking up vines and palm leaves, just like yesterday.I entered the jungle together with Ellen.\u201cIs there really water here?\u201dEllen seemed unsure whether there was any drinking water on this deserted island. She came with me on my search for a water source on Bertus\u2019 behalf.\u201cThe fact that there are wild animals on this island means that they have some place where they hydrate themselves. There must be something like a creek with drinkable water, or a place where rainwater gathers.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dEllen seemed convinced by my words, assuring that there should definitely be a water source somewhere on this island. Ellen and I slowly made our way through the jungle, although not as slow as with Delphine Izadra yesterday, cutting down bushes in our way.I was armed with three javelins and a machete, while Ellen had a short bow and a machete.\u00a0 I even packed a water canteen, so we should be able to push forward for quite some time.We didn\u2019t really have to look for a water source just to get drinking water though.If my predictions were correct, there would be rain tomorrow. According to the original novel, all of Class B\u2019s poorly built tents would be blown away, leaving their body soaked and making their body temperature drop.So if we made enough rainwater collectors, we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about drinking water soon enough.However, what I was looking for now was water for use, not drinking water. One could see that everyone was rather stressed out because they couldn\u2019t change their clothes, but if we knew of a location with fresh water, they could go there to wash themselves or their clothes, even if we didn\u2019t move our camp there.At this rate, it was highly likely that the others would voluntarily give up one by one because they couldn\u2019t endure not being able to wash their clothes. Although I seriously disliked their whining, I did need some of their abilities, so it would be good for me to hang on to them.Although this uninhabited island was mostly covered in jungle terrain, it had something in the form of a mountain rising up in its middle.Although it was difficult to see due to the overgrown trees, there was a chance that there were pools of water in the mountain\u2019s valley and folds. We determined the valley\u2019s location by climbing up a tree.\u201cI feel terribly tired.\u201dI wondered if it was because of this terrible heat. It felt all round unpleasant just wearing these sweat soaked clothes on my body, to the point where I wondered if my whole body had become liquid.\u201cHuff\u2026. Huff\u2026.\u201dEllen was exhausted as well. Her breathing became labored.\u201cShould we go back?\u201dShe might become even more exhausted if we were to go in even further, so I asked Ellen that, but Ellen just shook her head although it seemed to be really tough for her.\u201cI think I can hear the sound of water.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t you just hallucinating?\u201dOf course, I did think she had a much better hearing than me. However, wasn\u2019t it just that thing? You know, that thing that would make one mistake seeing an oasis in the middle of a desert. Something similar to a mirage.\u201cNo\u2026. I really think I can hear it.\u201dEllen just spoke to me as such with a blank expression on her face.No, come to think of it, I could also strengthen my hearing, right?I have super hearing.That was what I was self-suggesting myself with.Certainly, as I focused completely on my hearing, I felt like I could pick up sounds more precisely. I wonder since when I was able to use these kinds of reinforcements.I could hear the sound of leaves rustling in the wind, the cies of some unknown insects, and the chirping of birds.In the midst of all these sounds.Something like splaaash or gurgle.I could clearly hear something similar to sounds water made.\u201cI can hear it. Over there.\u201c\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWhen I finished checking, Ellen took the lead as if there was nothing else to do anymore.*\u00a0*\u00a0*According to my settings, there was supposed to be a stream flowing through the valley. The stream, that I presumed to have its source at the top of that mountain, was flowing down as if descending.It was quite large.Some places of the stream were quite wide and, looking into the deep-blue water, quite deep as well.The flowing water was clear. Not muddy at all.Originally, drinking this kind of water would kill you. It would be infested with parasites and germs.However, this wasn\u2019t an authentic jungle. We could drink this water with unknown origins, because it was under strict quality control. They probably used purification magic or whatever.There were no dangerous beasts around as well.Ellen carefully approached the pool of water and cautiously scooped up some of it with her hands to moisten her throat.It must have been incredibly hard on her. This was my first time seeing this kid act so actively. After she drank some of the cold water, even her body trembled as if she had just come back\u00a0 to life.Of course, I was the same.\u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201d-Splash!I didn\u2019t need anything else and just threw myself into the water.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Since it was a pretty deep stream, there were places where the water was just as stagnant as the water found in a swimming pool. In a fairly wide part of the stream with a maximum depth of about 3 meters I was sitting in a somewhat shallow area.Ellen swam through the water like a seal, diving from time to time.It didn\u2019t show on her face, but she seemed like she was excited. Because of the clear, blue water, I could see all of Ellen\u2019s enthusiastic swimming movements while she was submerged.It was like watching a real seal swimming at a zoo. Although she was more like a mermaid than that.Normally, one had to check first if the water was drinkable, but as I already knew that it was, I just filled the empty canteen and drank as much as I could.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dHowever, would the kids want to come here, even if they knew there was a stream here?Even if they came here to wash themselves or do their laundry, they would get sweaty again on their way back.That said, I think they\u2019d get upset as well if we were to move our camp to this place, because it would just be a repeat of yesterday\u2019s hard labor.Hmm.Let\u2019s leave the decision to Bertus.Ellen came out of the water after she swam for a while.She squeezed her hair, looked at me and pointed down the stream.\u201cGo over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to take all my clothes off.\u201d\u2026\u2026Ah.You\u2019re that excited, huh?Of course, she probably did this, not because she wanted to swim naked, but because she wanted to wash her clothes. I also went down the stream and rubbed my clothes under the running water, shook them out and placed them on some rocks on which the sun was shining.The sunlight was strong, so they would be bone dry pretty soon. No, they might not dry well because of the moisture, right?I didn\u2019t know what it would be.-Splash, splash!I couldn\u2019t see her, but I could hear Ellen swimming upstream. It looked like she took turns washing her clothes and herself again. Well, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to wash myself once.Originally, Delphine was supposed to find this stream. Probably not today though. Of course, the variable Charlotte got thrown into the mix, so I didn\u2019t know what would happen.-Reinhardt!And suddenly, Ellen called for me in a loud voice.*\u00a0*\u00a0*\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dEllen, wearing some clothes that weren\u2019t fully dried yet, had a stiff expression on her face. She felt nervous.\u201cWhy? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cThis place is kind of weird. I don\u2019t think we should stay here.\u201dEllen began to point at certain places up and down stream.\u201cThere are animal bones all over the place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201dIf Charlotte is considered a variable that started to stir the original development into a different direction, me bringing Ellen here would also be considered a variable. Ellen didn\u2019t just enjoy the stream, she also noticed some suspicious things and got some clues.\u201cAnd over there.\u201dEllen pointed to the other side.There were animal bones as well as traces that were a little different from the others.\u201cSomeone made a fire over there. They shouldn\u2019t be traces left by the teachers. I think this is related to those special conditions\u2025\u2026.\u201dEllen carefully concluded something.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a deserted island.\u201dSomeone other than us was living here.Ellen just took one step closer to the secret hiding on this island.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98REAPER SCANSThe Demon Prince goes to the Academy[Translator \u2013 KonnoAren ][Proofreader \u2013 ilafy ]Chapter 98Seeing the traces of a fire and food, Ellen concluded that there were others living on this island separate from Class A and B.\u201cThen is this somehow related to those special conditions?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dEllen was a lot more vigilant on our way back. She knew that nothing life-threatening should happen because we were still within the bounds of the mission.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean there wouldn\u2019t be any emergencies. Ellen vigilantly took the lead while I followed her.Perhaps because she was smart, she was able to find hints regarding the special condition right away.Anyway, we were so nervous that we wore our wet clothes and returned to the camp immediately.This was important information, so Bertus immediately stopped all work and gathered everyone in one place when I reported it to him.The kids became happy when they heard that we had discovered a stream but looked surprised when we told them that there was someone or something else on this island besides us.\u201cWh-what should we do? Are they cannibals?\u201d\u201cWha-what are you even saying?!\u201dAs Kono Lint\u2019s face turned pale, fear began to slowly spread among them. It was only natural that everyone\u2019s faces turned completely white.\u201cThe fact that this island isn\u2019t actually uninhabited is probably part of this mission. This must have been planned by Temple. There\u2019s nothing to be scared about; I think this is related to the special conditions\u2026\u201dOf course, Bertus stayed calm. Since this was only a mission, he came to the natural conclusion that this situation was a controlled one.\u201cThat means if we find that person that isn\u2019t part of our group, we\u2019ll be able to finish this mission right away, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I hope for, but we can\u2019t be sure if that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201cI guess so\u2026\u201dIf the presence of this other person besides us had something to do with those clear conditions, the mission would end if we found that person. At Bertus\u2019 words, the mood changed drastically.\u201cTh-then, do we just have to find that person?\u201dHarriet\u2019s mood suddenly became bright.It was everyone\u2019s dearest wish to quickly get out of this environment. Bertus nodded his head as if he understood the feelings behind Harriet\u2019s words.\u201cI don\u2019t know that much yet. But it\u2019s true that it would probably help us finish the mission early if we were to find that person.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s search the island! If we find that person first, we can go back!\u201d Cayer shouted\u2014and everyone seemed to agree with him. It was only right to quickly find that mysterious person and put an end to this mission.\u201cHmm\u2026 That seems to be the right choice, but\u2026\u201dBertus pondered while looking at me.\u201cReinhardt, what do you think?\u201dAt those words, everyone\u2019s eyes focused on me.I knew that their opinion of me had drastically changed. Those guys\u2014who\u2019d been treating me with indifference before\u2014had become all fussy over whatever I did. They seemed to think I was something like a vending machine that would spit out the right answers.Even those guys who hated my guts felt that it was only right to listen to what I had to say for the time being.But honestly, I didn\u2019t want to give them any more hints; it was true that I wanted Class A to get better results than they did in the original novel, but if I were to give them a hint, Class A would win.To be honest, I wanted Class B to win this mission so that Charlotte\u2019s side gained more strength.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, but how about we all go to the stream first?\u201dI didn\u2019t know about any of those complicated things, but my suggestion about going to play in the water was probably the best answer I could give in that situation.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Ellen was of the opinion that it would be dangerous but failed to convince any of them; the only thing they wanted to focus on was talk of that stream.It took about 30 minutes for all eleven of us to reach the stream through the route Ellen had laid out.Everyone was sweaty and exhausted but, spurred on by the hope that they\u2019d be able to wash up at the end of the journey, they kept on following Ellen without complaining.\u201cUwaah\u2026\u201dAs soon as we arrived at the stream, their eyes widened. The stream was even bigger than they had imagined.After a moment of silence, everyone plunged into the stream all at once.\u201cUrg! It\u2019s so cold!\u201d\u201cBe careful, there are some deep areas in there.\u201dHowever, those guys who threw themselves into the water didn\u2019t seem to hear me.Ellen also threw herself in again and started splashing around.She told them not to go there because it was dangerous, but when she laid her eyes on the water again, she seemed to lose all sense of caution.-Woah!In a situation where they had felt like they were about to turn into puddles of sweat, those kids immediately began to play in the water like the kids they were as soon as they arrived at the stream; Bertus also jumped in without hesitation, smiling unpretentiously.Yes, that was what kids should be like.*\u00a0*\u00a0** * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 KonnoArenProofreader \u2013 ilafyJoin our Discord for updates on releases!https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The water in the stream was quite deep, so there were some guys who ended up thrashing and squealing after they stepped into deeper places. Of course, Ellen, Bertus, and I\u2014those of us who knew how to swim\u2014fished them out.There were also times when things got a bit bizarre.\u201cNuwoah!\u201dKono Lint suddenly appeared outside of the water. Perhaps he had fallen into the deep parts of the stream.\u201dKyaaa!\u201d\u201cY-you! You crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cH-hey!\u201dNaturally, he escaped by teleporting\u2014leaving his clothes in the stream. The female students who saw him screamed, and the male students burst out into laughter when they witnessed that scene.\u201cU-uwaah! D-don\u2019t look!\u201d\u201cClothes! Someone bring him some clothes!\u201d Harriet shouted in agitation while covering her eyes with her hands. Bertus giggled after fishing Kono Lint\u2019s clothes out of the water as he handed them to him.It made sense that he used his teleportation in the face of death, so I put up with it.Everyone was playing in the same pool as the girls started to chatter among themselves.\u201cErm, Bertus.\u201d Harriet called out to Bertus, who was sitting idle in the water as our representative.\u201cAh, Saint-Owan, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d like to\u2026 Erm. Wash up\u2026 further upstream\u2026\u201c Harriet mumbled with her face reddened, too embarrassed to say what she meant directly.Of course, Bertus nodded his head, understanding what she was talking about.\u201cA-aah. I know what you\u2019re trying to say. But are you sure? We don\u2019t know what\u2019s up there\u2026\u201dIt seemed like he fully understood that they wanted to go wash themselves and their clothes. However, Bertus didn\u2019t know what might be up there, so he asked them if it was okay for them to just take their clothes off over there.\u201cEllen said she\u2019ll be on the lookout.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m relieved. Okay. I won\u2019t let any of the other guys go up there.\u201dThe other female students along with Harriet began heading upstream to a place that couldn\u2019t be seen by the boys.\u201cYou roughly know what they are doing, right?\u201d Bertus announced as if he didn\u2019t want to explain it with his own mouth. Everyone nodded quietly, becoming a little shy.Just thinking about their female classmates being naked up there seemed to make their hearts flutter.It wasn\u2019t hard to read that they were imagining things they shouldn\u2019t imagine. Were they all lewd devils? These kids.Kono Lint stared at the female students going up with a sullen expression.He seemed to think about using his teleportation to peep on them.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about doing something so useless. You\u2019d be caught right away.\u201d\u201cW-who said I\u2019d do something?\u201dAt my warning, Kono Lint shook his head violently.Of course, they eventually forgot about these things, washed their clothes, hung them on rocks, and started playing in the water again.It didn\u2019t really matter because the two places were so far apart that one couldn\u2019t see the place upstream from below or the place downstream from up top.The biggest pain in the ass was Kono Lint.\u201cLook!\u201d-Pat!When there were only men around, he started to play around with his teleportation. He suddenly teleported to the water\u2019s surface after diving in and did some bizarre things.\u201cWater Walking!\u201d-Papapapapat!Kono could teleport continuously, the only problem his power had was the fact that his clothes would come off. His activation speed and control were actually top-notch. However, he was a pitiful fellow whose true worth only came to the surface after giving up all his dignity as a human being.Bertus took off his clothes as well. It wasn\u2019t that unusual for us to see each others\u2019 naked bodies because we\u2019d often see them when we used the shower rooms after P.E.\u201cHmm\u2026 There\u2019s definitely something over there.\u201dBertus seemed convinced that the island wasn\u2019t so uninhabited after seeing the traces of meals being eaten\u2014including the hardly visible bones of animals. Bertus looked at me as I was just sitting around idly.\u201cWould it be too risky to move our camp here?\u201d he asked.\u201cWell, it has its merits and demerits. It would be good to find that person, but wild animals might appear quite frequently.\u201dBertus nodded at my explanation. Since the stream was filled with plenty of drinking water, it would be good to set up our camp there\u2014and we might also be able to find that other person.However, we wouldn\u2019t know what kinds of threats would await us at night. We would also have to throw away the camp we\u2019d already built up.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about that with everyone else later.\u201dBertus put this decision off for now.After some time\u2026After we finished washing up and drying our clothes, we regrouped again. The female students, obviously, had a much more cheerful expression adorning their faces.Harriet was smiling for the first time ever since we had arrived at the island.I thought it was good seeing her mood improve some.\u201cEveryone is of the opinion that this would be a good place to set up our camp, right?\u201dEveryone nodded at Bertus\u2019 words.\u201cLet\u2019s think about whether we want to make another camp here or go back to our old camp.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we can make one here.\u201dLiana, who seemed to have something to say about this, shook her head. The other female students did the same. Except for Ellen, all of them looked a bit exhausted.\u201cA snake came out\u2026 Up there.\u201d\u201cThis one.\u201dEllen held up a fairly big, dead snake\u2014stabbed through its head with a javelin.Snake.With the single mention of that word, it was unanimously decided that we\u2019d withdraw from the stream.*\u00a0*\u00a0*After we returned to our camp, everyone let out a sigh again. Still, one couldn\u2019t say that we hadn\u2019t achieved anything that day\u2014we were able to refill our water canteens, after all.Of course, they drank as much as they could from the canteens. However, we filled up the large pot with water so we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it for a while.\u201cShould we rest today?\u201dBertus came to me to speak as the sun was beginning to set. If we were to sweat again, what we had done just then would become useless.\u201cHow about we take a break after we finish the camp?\u201dHowever, I disagreed; we weren\u2019t done making the wooden flooring for the tents yet.At my words, everyone glared at me with daggers in their eyes. They wanted to rest, but I criticized them, asking them to work more.\u201cNo, I just think that it\u2019s only appropriate that we finish what we started first.\u201dYou punks.Get ready to bow down to me tomorrow.*\u00a0*\u00a0*After working on our camp, Harriet cast underwater breathing magic on Ellen and me before we went hunting for our dinner.Just walking underwater with that magic cast on us was amazing, even if we weren\u2019t hunting.Ellen was probably thinking similarly to me, as she stopped sometimes to admire the little fish moving through the coral reefs.Ellen looked at the small yellow fish that were biting her finger as she reached out for them. While I was watching that scene, Ellen met my eyes.-\u2026-\u2026We weren\u2019t able to speak while underwater, but we could tell what we felt at the moment just by looking at each others\u2019 faces.Ellen\u2019s black hair that moved with the flow of water was quite impressive.Our harvest was three lobsters and two large fish that resembled snappers\u2014they were so large that it seemed like we could feed all eleven of us with just those.After leaving the water, completely drenched once again, we stood on the beach and watched the sunset. Ellen didn\u2019t follow me back to the camp.When I looked back, I saw Ellen still staring at the flaming sunset.\u201cWhat are you doing? Aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201cEllen stopped admiring the scenery after I called out to her and walked towards me with her back to the setting sun.I wasn\u2019t able to see what kind of expression she wore with the light shining from behind her.\u201cI think this is fun.\u201dPerhaps she was smiling.____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99REAPER SCANSThe Demon Prince goes to the Academy[Translator \u2013 KonnoAren ][Proofreader \u2013 ilafy ]Chapter 99We cut the logs in half and stuck them together to form rectangular floorings. Next, we put the prepared huts on top of the flooring.We finished another hut that day, so we had as many huts as there were people. The children acquiesced to securing every hut by using vines to tie them to logs in order to prevent them from getting blown away by the wind, as I requested.If we\u2019d left them as is, they\u2019d be carried away and smashed by the rain the next day.Like we had done the previous day, we kept watch at night.Thanks to the wooden flooring, everyone seemed to feel a little better than the day before. Of course, most of them kind of felt ashamed of themselves for feeling good about having a better place to sleep in this situation.All of us were thoroughly exhausted, so no matter what kind of accommodation they had, everyone just fell asleep right away, as did I.*\u00a0*\u00a0*A dark night.-Shaaaaaa\u2026The sound of rain.-Rumble! Ruuumble!Lightning.-Woooosh!Wind.Because of the heavy rainfall and the wind blowing through the hut, I couldn\u2019t help but wake up.It was impossible to build a completely water and wind-proofed hut in the situation we had found ourselves in.\u201cWhat?! Rain!\u201dOne or two people began shouting like that inside their huts. It was impossible for anyone to sleep comfortably in that chaos. Dark clouds covered the sky, the bonfire got extinguished, and our view was completely dyed in darkness.The flashes of lightning that flickered across the sky from time to time was the only thing that allowed us to see our surroundings.A storm was coming.-Don\u2019t go outside! Stay inside for now!It was Bertus who shouted that.It was raining, so it was only natural that one would get wet as soon as they left their hut. It was best to just stay inside where one was slightly more protected from the rain and wind. We probably couldn\u2019t go back to sleep, so our only option was to hold on until the sun rose and the rain let up.If we were to go out now, the only thing that would happen was that our body temperature would drop rapidly due to the cold rain and wind.-I-it\u2019s about to be blown away!However, it seemed like some huts were still about to break\u2014even after we firmly fixed all of them to the ground.-If it gets smashed, go to another one immediately!Even in that situation, Bertus calmly gave instructions to the confused and scared children. If we hadn\u2019t reinforced the floor with the wooden flooring, we\u2019d had have been laying in wet sand by then.-Crack!In the end, the hut couldn\u2019t win against the strong wind. I could hear the sound of someone\u2019s hut breaking.-Kyaa!That was Harriet\u2019s scream.-I-I can\u2019t see anything! What do I do?!In that deep darkness, Harriet seemed to panic. It would be good if she could use something like light magic, but there was no way that she was able to calmly use her magic in her situation.-I-I can\u2019t see anything! What do I do! I feel like I\u2019m about to be blown away!-Saint-Owan! Go into another hut!-I-I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t see anything!-Flash!There was a single flash of lightning. At that moment, I left my hut after I located Harriet through the flashing lightning. I found her lying on the floor, fumbling around.\u201cW-who\u2026?\u201dShe seemed to feel some relief as well as fear when she felt someone grabbing her in the dark. I traced my steps back through the darkness and returned to my hut, all while dragging Harriet with me.\u201cCalm down, idiot.\u201d\u201cR-Reinhardt?\u201dIt was kind of funny and sad that she was able to tell that it was me in the chaos just because I called her an idiot.After I called her \u2018idiot\u2019, she immediately felt relieved.\u201cBertus! I have her!\u201d-Alright, Reinhardt! Good job!\u201cCalm down. It\u2019s just raining.\u201dI slowly patted Harriet\u2019s back. She was drenched in rainwater, trembling in fear.\u201cThe rain will stop. You know that much already, right?\u201dAside from simply feeling scared, she was also trembling because of the cold.\u201cUse heat magic or whatever to maintain your body temperature. If you do that, this\u2019ll be nothing.\u201d\u201cO-okay\u2026\u201dIt seemed like she was trying to calm herself by taking deep breaths as I talked to her.-Ruuuuumble!\u201cHieek!\u201dHowever, it didn\u2019t seem to be easy for her to calm down with strong wind and thunder constantly echoing through the area.Before she could even adapt to the unfamiliar environment, she was faced with the worst possible situation that could occur in that place. She couldn\u2019t calm down easily.The huts creaked, and it seemed like a few more got smashed. Children were screaming, and I could see some trying to fix the huts.\u201cI\u2019m scared\u2026\u201dBecause it was too dark, I couldn\u2019t see what kind of expression Harriet was making, but I could definitely feel that she was shaking. I wondered if my patting on her back had helped because she was soon calm enough to cast magic.Perhaps she cast something like thermal magic, as a shining yellow sphere appeared in the hut that spread warmth around it.\u201cOkay, well done.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe brightness of the sphere\u2019s light was rather weak, but it was enough to barely discern our surroundings. Although there was strong, cold wind blowing outside, the sphere had a similar effect to a small bonfire placed inside the hut.Harriet gradually calmed her heart and began to summon more spheres of light, this time placing them into the other huts.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI didn\u2019t know she\u2019d do something like that, so let\u2019s say I was slightly surprised. Harriet looked at me as if she was doing something wrong.\u201c\u2026Nothing. Continue.\u201dIn times of crisis, we had to help each other.It was a simple concept, but it made me feel quite strange seeing Harriet act on it. Did she think that it was only natural to help out the others, as she also received help? She wasn\u2019t supposed to be that kind of character.Fortunately, the spheres of light Harriet summoned seemed to successfully quell everyone\u2019s anxiety.-Ruuuumble!\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dA storm was raging outside.It would be difficult to fall asleep again, but at least it didn\u2019t feel cold anymore.*\u00a0*\u00a0*The storm that had been raging on throughout the night let up in the morning.Of course, the rain didn\u2019t completely stop. It was still raining cats and dogs. It was close to a torrential downpour. Waves were thrashing about wildly, crashing onto the beach. Looking into the distance one could see overwhelming waves jumping up and crashing down.No matter if we had underwater breathing magic cast on us or not, going out into the sea when it was in such a state would be suicide.It was morning, so our view became a bit clearer. It would be best to avoid going out until the rain stopped, but the rain would continue until nightfall. If we stayed like this, we would not only be unable to act that day, but we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything until the next morning.Securing drinking water wasn\u2019t a problem but securing food was.\u201cW-where are you going?\u201dAs I scrambled to get up, Harriet looked at me, perplexed. She seemed exhausted from summoning heating spheres all night long. She must have been the most exhausted out of all of us.\u201cI have to do something. Go rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I walked out into the pouring rain, Bertus, who had already come out before me, looked at me, a hand raised in greeting.\u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if it was really necessary to come out, but it seemed like Bertus had been checking the three smashed huts all night. He probably tried to make sure that all of us were safe.\u201cReinhardt, there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u201cA problem?\u201dBertus\u2019 expression hardened.\u201cCayer is gone.\u201dOriginally, all of Class A except Ellen should have given up at that point.So the things that normally should have happened to Class B instead started happening to Class A.*\u00a0*\u00a0** * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 KonnoArenProofreader \u2013 ilafyJoin our Discord for updates on releases!https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Cayer Vioden was gone. Bertus was trying to figure out the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s strange. Normally, the one standing guard was supposed to wake up everyone else in case of rain\u2026 Why didn\u2019t he do that?\u201dCayer\u2019s turn was before mine; he was supposed to wake everyone else if he noticed a storm was brewing so that we could prepare for it, but he didn\u2019t.\u201cErich, who was standing watch before Cayer, said that he woke him up, and he said that he went back to sleep as soon as he saw him take up the post\u2026\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t wake me up.\u201dCayer didn\u2019t come to wake me up. We all just got woken up by the storm\u2019s sounds.\u201cSomething happened to Cayer while he was on night watch\u2026 At least that\u2019s what I think.\u201dSo, before he was able to wake me up, something happened to Cayer, and he went missing.\u201cThere\u2019s the possibility that something happened to Cayer and he gave up voluntarily, or maybe this situation in itself is part of the mission, or he might have accidentally run into the jungle and gotten lost\u2026 It\u2019s complicated.\u201dBertus nodded his head at my guesses.\u201cAre you sure that this might be part of the mission?\u201d\u201cI mean, wouldn\u2019t that make the most sense?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dIt seemed like Bertus needed certainty. I wasn\u2019t sure if Cayer gave up, wandered into the jungle, or what really happened. We didn\u2019t know if the situation was controlled or if Cayer\u2019s life was in danger.But the teachers wouldn\u2019t give us any further hints.Everything had to be resolved with our own judgment.Whether we searched for Cayer, gave up, or uncovered the truth, it was our choice.\u201cWe have three strong possibilities at the moment\u2026\u201dBertus continued his calm speech in this heavy rain.\u201cNumber one: Cayer went into the jungle in the middle of the night for some reason. If he went there to do his business, it would make sense. And while he was at it, the storm started\u2014leading him to get lost after wandering around the jungle.\u201d\u201cNumber two: the other people on this island kidnapped or harmed Cayer in some way. If that is the case, there is a high possibility that Cayer gave up or was eliminated. You said that these others were part of the mission, so this situation was under the teacher\u2019s control.\u201d\u201cNumber three: class B kidnapped Cayer or something like that.\u201dBertus considered a possibility I would never have thought of. Bertus suspected Class B.\u201cClass B? Why?\u201d\u201cThe only way to complete this mission is to hold on until Sunday. However, that\u2019s not the only way to win.\u201dSurviving until Sunday was the clear condition for this mission, but that wasn\u2019t the way to win it.After all, this was a cooperative as well as a competitive mission.Bertus considered all possibilities, which involved being suspicious of one\u2019s competitors.\u201cThere are different ways to win this mission other than meeting the special conditions.\u201dI understood what Bertus was trying to say.\u201cIf one made one\u2019s opponents give up, one could win just by holding on until Friday.\u201dBertus already thought of other methods of winning in the mission that even I, the writer, hadn\u2019t thought of.He truly was an incredible kid. Of course, Bertus also knew that it was unlikely. However, he thought that there was no way that Charlotte couldn\u2019t come up with something like that. Although the possibility of her using such a radical method was low, it seemed like he judged that it still was a possibility.Therefore, he asked me to go check on how Class B was doing as a form of reconnaissance. I was the only one among the students of Class A who had frequent contact with Class B, so he said it wouldn\u2019t be all that suspicious.He also told me to take care of issues such as sharing our situation at my own discretion.*\u00a0*\u00a0*After the heavy rain let up a bit more, I went to Class B\u2019s camp\u2014it was a mess.All their huts were destroyed to the point where they couldn\u2019t be salvaged anymore, and everyone had left the camp. If I hadn\u2019t known that there would be a storm of that level and gotten Class A to reinforce their huts, we would have been in a similar state.Class B decided to check the situation as soon as the rain let up and abandoned the camp for the moment. It would have been impossible for them to salvage the situation at the moment, as everything had happened in the middle of the night.They probably gathered under a big tree somewhere in the jungle.\u201cCharlotte! Ludwig! Delphine!\u201dI went into the jungle and randomly called for Charlotte and Ludwig. After walking for a short amount of time, Ludwig appeared from behind a large tree.\u201cReinhardt!\u201d\u201cOh! Are you okay?\u201dAs I approached, Ludwig came over to me through the rain with a welcome expression on his face.\u201cPhew, this sure is one hell of a mess.\u201d\u201cAre you all gathered over there?\u201d\u201cOh. That\u2019s right, but everyone\u2019s condition isn\u2019t all that good.\u201dAs I followed behind Ludwig, I could see Class B\u2019s students all huddled under a large tree, trying to take shelter from the rain.Fortunately, there was a single light sphere floating amongst them\u2014although it was a bit different from the ones Harriet summoned, it still emitted warmth, so they were only barely able to hold on.At that moment, I understood that the guy named Ashir, who had divine powers, had used his divine power to summon that sphere which could give a minimal amount of warmth.\u201cReinhardt.\u201dCharlotte, who had been sitting completely still, got up, pulled at me, and sat me down near the sphere of light.\u201cWhat? Did you come here to spy on us?\u201dAs if doubtful of my intentions, Charlotte continued to smile helplessly even in this dire situation.\u201cI can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not like that. The situation sure doesn\u2019t look very good.\u201d\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t; that storm was like a bolt out of the blue last night.\u201dI could see that everyone in Class B was trembling. Ashir looked overwhelmed just by having to maintain his divine magic.\u201cHow\u2019s the situation over there?\u201d\u201cSome of our camp got destroyed as well, but not as much as yours. Still, things are very bad.\u201dCharlotte just said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d to my words and nodded her head. I counted their members and finished assessing the situation.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like someone is missing?\u201dEveryone\u2019s expression slightly hardened at my words. There weren\u2019t as many people in Class B I really knew, so it was pretty obvious.\u201cLouis Ankton, did he go missing as well?\u201dHearing what I said, Charlotte\u2019s expression changed.\u201cWhat? Is it the same for your side?\u2026 What happened?\u201d\u201cYeah, we lost Cayer.\u201dThose disappearances weren\u2019t restricted to just one side.It happened to both classes. In the original, it was Lanian Sessor who was supposed to disappear. Only, that part changed slightly.And that was how the possibility Bertus suggested, that Class B had something to do with it, disappeared. Class B would go out to search for Louis Ankton as soon as the rain stopped.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you a lot of things in my position,\u201d I said while looking at Charlotte.One student from both Class A and B went missing. With these clues alone, Charlotte should have been able to deduce many things.\u201cBut there\u2019s a stream running from the mountain. You\u2019ll find it if you go in that direction. The water\u2019s drinkable. I found it yesterday.\u201d\u201cDrinkable water?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions changed at those words. It was true water was literally dropping from the sky, but the location of a water source was still very important information. Charlotte\u2019s expression turned a bit complicated when she saw me give out that information for free.\u201cBe careful, Charlotte.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Reinhardt. Be careful as well.\u201dCharlotte watched me for some distance as I returned to Class A\u2019s camp.____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although we had suffered, we had it a lot better.\u201cOkay. So someone attacked us, and we have to catch that person whether we like it or not. Maybe that\u2019s the specific condition the teachers mentioned. That being what it is, we still have to gather food to keep going.\u201dThe first objective was searching for the culprits, and the second was to find food. It was already hard enough to do just one, but suddenly I had to work on both tasks at the same time.\u201cI, Cliffman, Ellen, and Grantz are probably the only ones who are able to fight properly in an emergency situation\u2026\u201dHarriet\u2019s magic required casting time, and Adelia didn\u2019t learn any attack spells.

In Kono Lint\u2019s and Erich\u2019s cases, they weren\u2019t on a level where they could fight properly either.So there were actually only five people who had actual combat abilities; we also had no way of reliably knowing what kind of opponent we\u2019d be facing.\u201cAmong us, Ellen is the only one that can act alone, right?\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d\u201cOkay, fortunately, we have Heinrich, who can light fires even during this rain, so it won\u2019t be difficult to cook whatever we catch. If we don\u2019t find anything, we will have to eat coconuts.\u201dBertus went towards the camp.\u201cOkay! Although it might be a bit hard because it\u2019s raining, please come out, everyone!\u201d he shouted loudly.Everyone started crawling out of their huts like beggars at Bertus\u2019s call.Cayer had disappeared, so there were only 10 people left. Everyone was wet from the rain and\u2014after the storm had hit us\u2014none of us could sleep anymore, so everyone looked extremely tired.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Bertus explained to them what we talked about step by step.Cayer Vioden was missing. There was also someone missing from Class B\u2019s side.It looked like the two of them had been kidnapped by the other inhabitants of the island, who might hunt us every night or target those who entered the jungle alone.We had to find and subdue them before any more of us got caught by the inhabitants. Otherwise, we\u2019d get completely destroyed, and both our classes would fail the mission.\u201cFrom this point on, I, Ellen, Grantz, and Cliffman will be divided into three groups to search through and hunt in the jungle. Those remaining should organize the camp and repair the damaged huts. And, if you could, make some rainwater collectors; make as many as possible so that we can secure enough drinking water, but don\u2019t go too deep into the jungle. I don\u2019t know what might happen.\u201dAfter instructing the remaining people on what to do, Bertus gathered the ones that were selected to go into the jungle.\u201cEllen, I think you should go in alone. Are you okay with that? If you think it\u2019s dangerous, you can move with others as a three-person team.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go alone.\u201dEllen took a shortbow, some arrows, and a knife. That was enough.\u201cOkay, Cliffman, you\u2019ll go with me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGrantz, you\u2019ll move with Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLike that, we managed to organize three groups.\u201cDon\u2019t just try to subdue the inhabitants as you come across them. Please try to first check what type of people they are, if possible, then come back. We\u2019ll make a plan together then. For now, our top priority is securing food.\u201dEveryone nodded at Bertus\u2019s words.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d-Shaaaaaaaaa!Accompanied by the heavy rain, we entered the jungle.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Liana was a bit different from the other Class A students who entered the jungle.She was a supernatural power user. Of course, I was also one, but my talent was actually closer to a combat talent.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201dThat was why Liana had much less stamina than the other guys, and she was really suffering from the drop in her body temperature due to the rain. The sphere Harriet attached to her had also disappeared, so she was struggling to move through the rain.\u201c\u2026Should we go back?\u201d\u201cNo, just keep going.\u201dThis girl was completely exhausted, but she still walked ahead with her eyes squinted, seeming as if she didn\u2019t want to be a burden. I could feel that my stamina had increased tremendously, but I also noticed that this girl had incredibly little stamina.Of course, in a combat situation, her Electrokinesis would be much more useful than my abilities.After walking for a while, we had no other choice but to stop.\u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Get some rest.\u201d\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201dAs if she had no more energy left to speak, she just sat down and leaned her back against a tree. Her lips turned blue, and her body temperature seemed to have dropped drastically.\u201cIs your condition worse? I think we should go back now.\u201dLiana struggled to raise her hand instead of giving me a response.\u201cGive me that.\u201d\u201cThat? Erm, Ah\u2026 You mean this?\u201d\u201cYeah, that.\u201dLiana grabbed the machete I held in my hand and suddenly began to focus her strength in her eyes.-Crackle!Raindrops began to evaporate as soon as they touched the machete. It seemed like she was heating it up by applying electricity to it; she let it cool down slightly using the rain and then hugged it like a hot pack. It looked like she already knew how to attach her power to things.\u201cI want to burn it all down.\u201dLiana was muttering nervously\u2014it seemed like she didn\u2019t like roaming through the jungle in such conditions. Of course, who the hell would?After doing that for some time, Liana\u2019s complexion turned back to normal. She then handed the machete back to me.\u201cYou do it too.\u201dThe machete was heated to a somewhat hot level.\u201cUh, Uhm\u2026 Okay.\u201dThe more time I spent with her, the more she seemed like a kind weirdo\u2014rather than just kind.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Due to Liana having a low level of stamina, our progress was a lot slower compared to the other teams\u2014we had to take a lot of breaks. She would hug the machete hot pack to recover her body temperature; then we\u2019d move forward again.\u201cBut what if we get lost while we\u2019re searching around? No, aren\u2019t we actually already lost?\u201dThe rain was very heavy, so Liana seemed to have already lost her sense of direction. I pointed to the sky.\u201cWe can climb up a tree to check.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIt would be enough to just climb up on a tree, and then we could figure out our approximate location. Like that, we could find our way if we ever got lost. If one still didn\u2019t know where one was, one just had to look towards the ocean to find the direction of the closest beach and go around to our camp. As if she was satisfied with that answer, Liana just hugged the machete like a doll.\u201cBut how are we even supposed to find any animals to hunt in this heavy rain\u2026\u201d Liana grumbled, then her eyes suddenly became wide.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that one?\u201dAs I looked towards the place Liana was pointing at, I could see a roe deer drinking rainwater from a puddle.I made a shushing gesture, to which Liana nodded with a firm expression on her face.It hadn\u2019t noticed us yet.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 KonnoArenProofreader \u2013 ilafyJoin our Discord for updates on releases!https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The distance between us and it was about 15 meters, which was too far for Liana\u2019s ability to reach. I had a javelin, but I wasn\u2019t familiar with using them. Even with the support of my supernatural power, could I even graze it?\u2018Let\u2019s get close to it slowly.\u2019Liana silently nodded her head when she heard my words. Fortunately, the deer didn\u2019t notice the sound of our footsteps because of the heavy rain.After slowly moving five meters closer to it, we were able to reduce the gap to about 10 meters. At this distance, I thought I\u2019d be able to hit it well enough.But if I can\u2019t kill it in a single blow, it would just run away.What should I do?I only had one javelin, only one chance. I took it out and showed it to Liana.Was this possible?-Can you leave electric energy in there?A while ago, I found out that it was possible for her to attach electric energy to metallic objects, but was she able to make electric energy remain in an object? Under normal circumstances, that would be impossible, but she already knew how to attach her ability to objects.To put it simply, I wanted her to put an electric enchantment on my weapon.-Uhm, I think I can do that.Liana concentrated and began to attach her electric energy to my javelin\u2019s tip.And.-Brzzzt!\u201cUgrrrrr!\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201dOf course, Liana and I both forgot that if she were to let electric currents run through a rain-soaked javelin, my hand would also get electrocuted while holding it.*\u00a0*\u00a0*Fortunately, I didn\u2019t die.However, the roe deer naturally ran away, surprised by my loud scream after I got electrocuted.Ditzy and stupid.Both of us just stood there in the rain staring blankly into the distance, ashamed at how we stupidly lost that deer.\u201cHey, even if I asked you to do that, you\u2019re electrokinetic. Shouldn\u2019t you have known what would happen?\u201dLiana glared at me with her eyes wide open.\u201cAnd you won first place with such an empty head.\u201d\u201cDid you just call my head empty?\u201d\u201cBe glad that I didn\u2019t call you stone-headed. Oh, but it would have been better if your head was made of stone, then you wouldn\u2019t have gotten electrocuted. You\u2019re an electricity conducting empty head.\u201dShe was way different from Harriet.She was not one to lose in a fight of words; even beyond that, she didn\u2019t get affected at all and even dealt out quite a bit. If I argued with her anymore, I think we might have ended up at each other\u2019s throats, so I decided to be more lenient.\u201c\u2026Fine, I lost. Let\u2019s stop this.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHunting using Electrokinesis? It seemed like we wanted to die of a heart attack.Anyway, both of us got overly excited about finding prey that we couldn\u2019t think clearly. Thinking back, even I thought that asking for a Lightning enchantment on a rainy day made me seem just as bad as Ludwig.The same goes for lashing out at the kid whom I asked to do it.\u201cSigh. Let\u2019s look for it.\u201d\u201cI think it already ran away.\u201dWe resumed walking in the direction the roe fled to. The ground was muddy because of the continued heavy rainfall, so there weren\u2019t a lot of traces to follow. Neither of us had any tracking talents nor any other related skills. Just because I watched Law of the Jungle or Bear Grylls videos a few times didn\u2019t mean I perfectly knew how to track animals.We had no other choice but to walk around randomly.\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have gone far\u2026\u201d\u201cShh. \u201dFortunately, the roe deer didn\u2019t run that far. After walking around for about 10 minutes, I could see some grass shaking in the distance.-Rustle!The bushes were shaking quite unnaturally. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the roe deer or something else, but there definitely was something over there. Liana and I slowly approached the place while keeping completely silent. I prepared my javelin so that I could react at any time.-Groooowl!Then we heard a clear, low-pitched growl that made our muscles stiffen.It was an animal.What we were able to see when we got closer was a jaguar that had hunted down the roe deer we were chasing, giving us a warning growl.\u201c!\u201dWhen Liana saw the beast, she froze up.I wasn\u2019t much different, though. Just looking at that beast\u2014which wasn\u2019t even an actual monster or something\u2014I felt my whole body growing weak.What was with this? Crazy.This didn\u2019t come up in the original novel.I mean, they did exist in the original, but they shouldn\u2019t be found here.I grabbed the stiffened Liana\u2019s arm and slowly backed away from it.The jaguar that spotted us would run after us at full speed if we were to get even a little closer. I didn\u2019t know if I was able to react to the speed and agility of a wild cat-like predator.Liana looked at me and tried to call out to me by only moving her mouth without letting out a sound.-Why is something like this here?!-Because it is.Questioning how there could be a mission like this out there, Liana seemed to be on the verge of delirium while I was trying to calmly lead her to back up.It caught its prey, so it probably wouldn\u2019t try to chase after us.We had two options.-Let\u2019s choose whether we drive it away, kill it to take away its prey, or retreat as is.-Is that even something we had to consider?It seemed like Liana was swearing me out just with her eyes. Her eyes seemed to ask me if I had gone mad.-It\u2019s possible to chase it away with the javelin like before, using electricity.-\u2026Is your head really made out of stone? Did you forget that you got electrocuted last time?It seemed like Liana was now actually worried if my brain had some serious defects or not.-I\u2019m not throwing it, but you are.Of course, I didn\u2019t forget that I got shocked before when trying to throw an electricity-enchanted javelin.However, I wasn\u2019t the only one able to throw it\u2014that girl was immune to electricity after all\u2026-Me? You want me to throw the javelin and hit that thing? You think that\u2019ll work?-Who told you that you have to hit it?I pointed towards the bush the beast was in.-There\u2019s a puddle over there. You just have to throw it in there.Because of the rain falling, the puddle was almost overflowing, and the place where the jaguar caught the deer was clearly in the water.It was only then that Liana seemed to understand what I was going on about.-What if it dodges? Won\u2019t it attack us?-If that thing comes at us, I\u2019ll do something about it.-What do you mean \u2018you\u2019ll do something\u2019?-Anyway, you\u2019ll be able to do it well, so just do it.My physical abilities might not have been on par with a wild beast, but if it was a jaguar rushing straight at us, it would come into Liana\u2019s range. Rather, if I were to aggro it and kite it for a while, Liana could attack it with her electric shock.This mission wasn\u2019t supposed to be life-threatening, but we were able to do whatever we wanted.Liana seemed worried, but she eventually grabbed the javelin\u2026After I got further away to avoid getting electrocuted, Liana threw the javelin with all her might with an unsure look on her face.And.-Pak!\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201c\u2026How does this even happen?\u201dIt was a fairly large puddle; however, the javelin was horizontally embedded in a tree in the area.She had not only missed it completely, it seemed like she had aimed at a completely different place.-Snaaarl!The jaguar sensed our intent and ran towards us.\u201cWha-what should we do!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean what should we do?!\u201dI picked up my machete and aimed at the rushing jaguar. The speed of the beast\u2019s charge was unbelievably fast. So fast one couldn\u2019t even follow it with one\u2019s naked eyes.If I tried to stab it, it would just evade it\u2014so I grabbed the blade of the machete and held it horizontally.It was the\u00a0half-swording\u00a0style Ellen had occasionally shown me.Rather than attacking it, it would be better to block it; my purpose wasn\u2019t to kill it but to stop its charge.\u201cJust shoot at it!\u201dSelf-suggestion.I didn\u2019t use it to enhance my physical strength that time.I told myself that my body had become an insulator!-Kakang!Just as the jaguar bit into my horizontally held machete, ice blue sparks flew around Liana\u2019s eyes.-Snaaarl!\u201cUurrg!\u201dI felt a throbbing pain run through my body as if the electric current was forcing my muscles to continuously relax and contract.The jaguar that pounced at me staggered. I didn\u2019t miss that chance.I forced my stunned body to move and rushed towards the jaguar.-Crack!I slammed the machete right into its head. Rather than the sensation of cutting something, the sensation of crushing something got transmitted to my hands.\u201cGasp\u2026 Gasp\u2026\u201dThe battle didn\u2019t even last 5 seconds.However, Liana sure could activate her ability quickly.If we both weren\u2019t able to activate our abilities so fast, the situation would have ended very differently.\u201cAre\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dI looked at Liana and grinned.\u201cSometimes, you just gotta get electrocuted a bit to get rid of all the parasites on your body.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026 What are you even saying?\u201dHearing my ridiculous bullshit, Liana was genuinely worried that I had lost my mind after getting electrocuted twice in a row.Damn.I was amazed that I was able to react properly when that beast had rushed towards me.Had I made a mistake, I would have gotten eliminated.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
