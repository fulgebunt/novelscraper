    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1There was a saying that if you\u2019ve committed a crime, you\u2019d absolutely get punished. It\u2019s a saying that almost never came to fruition.There was another saying.If you were to go to hell you\u2019d have to pay for all your wrongdoings, no matter how small. Of course, I didn\u2019t agree with that one either.This wasn\u2019t really a saying and more of something I experienced myself.If a situation was just too incomprehensible, a person\u2019s thought process would turn rather simple.In a certain office, I was forced to make a certain choice by some sour-faced woman wearing a suit.It was rather complicated, so let\u2019s put it simple.Simply put.This thing called Hell existed and I think I died.The cause of my death was also rather simple.It was \u2018Acute myocardial infarction due to high blood pressure, which caused a cardiac arrest\u2019.My blood pressure suddenly went up like this, because of a malicious comment I was reading. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.My blood pressure went up because of some bad comment? Just for that reason? Really?My eyes grew a bit distant.That\u2019s supposed to be my last memory?\u201cPlease sign this quickly.\u201dShe threw a form in front of me. There was some stuff written on it, with a blank space presumably for my signature below.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, I\u2019m dead? I, I just saw some malicious comments which made my blood pressure rise and then I just died? People can die like this?\u201d\u201cDo people always have to die for great reasons? There are a lot of people who die just by slipping on an icy road. Alright, hurry up and make your choice now.\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t want to believe it, I didn\u2019t have a choice in that matter.\u2026\u2026\u2026Anyway, I was in hell now.It was up to myself if I took the deal or just went right down.I just had to sign.I was forced to make a choice that I never thought I\u2019d ever have to make.There were some lines written on this form that I was more than familiar with.[The City of the Dead][Surviving in the Ruined World][The Hunter became a Manager][The Trash returned][Somehow, the Game became Reality, but I\u2019m just a Janitor][The Demon King is Dead]These were all titles of novels I wrote.My charges were \u2018Being a repeat offender\u2019 and \u2018Having no prospects at all\u2019.For that I was to be sent into the world of one of the novels I wrote.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll get sent into one my novels?\u201d\u201cYes. As to which character or novel you\u2019ll inhabit is up to chance.\u201dShit.I should have written more peaceful novels.* * *This was the explanation I got from this person I presumed to be a Grim Reaper or a Hell\u2019s Employee.Every single person sinned.Except for very rare cases, no one immediately got sent to heaven. That\u2019s why everyone goes through the process of atoning for the petty sins one had accumulated through their life.Additionally, since there were a multitude of different sins, the method for atonement differed from person to person.I was a novelist.A web novel author who somehow managed to make ends meet with novels one could describe as second- or third-rate.My biggest sin was leaving behind a lot of work throughout the years as a commercial writer.I told the readers who were reading my stories well that it was a writer\u2019s biggest sin to leave a story unfinished, before calmly digging up my sub-account to publish other works.\u201cTo be honest, sins committed by individuals are often only on the minor side, but if the number of these small sins accumulate, don\u2019t you think the scale of said sins would increase?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026.\u201dWas it decided by simple arithmetics? Was that really okay?Honestly though, just listening to her voice sent a shiver down my spine.The bitter voice coming out of the Grim Reaper\u2019s mouth seemed to directly pierce through my heart. This was on a completely different scale than normal bitterness.What if my blood pressure rose again? What would happen if I died again after I already died?My sins were just small ones that accumulated throughout my life.Anyway, the punishment I had to endure was being sent into a random character of a novel I wrote and surviving until the \u2018end\u2019.If I manage to do that, I\u2019d get sent to heaven.Apparently there were a lot of people that just got sent straight to hell, so I had it good, that\u2019s how the Grim Reaper tried to console me, though that didn\u2019t really work.\u201cAs it is a novel you wrote, wouldn\u2019t you know everything about it and what would happen in it? This can\u2019t even be called a punishment, now can it? In fact, wouldn\u2019t it be rather easy for you?\u201dThe Grim Reaper didn\u2019t even look at me as she nonchalantly said this to me.\u201cNo, see. That depends on the novel\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, I, uh\u2026\u2026I only wrote novels in which a lot of people die\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell congrats then. Think of it as a trivial punishment for your disregard of life then. It seems you don\u2019t understand the preciousness of life.\u201dYou bastard, it\u2019s not like I killed anyone in reality, now did I?! It\u2019s just fiction!No, if I actually knew I\u2019d one day have to live in one of the worlds I created, I certainly would have written something with a dreamland amusement park as the setting, wouldn\u2019t I?How should I have known that I\u2019d get punished for writing things like that, but who\u2019d write a novel with that in mind in the first place? Who\u2019d write about a master gunsman in their novel and didn\u2019t give him a gun?!This was all just in my head! Just because I wrote down I could punch as fast as lightning, didn\u2019t mean I actually could pull that off.On top of that, I was afflicted with a minor case of pretentiousitis, so I wrote a lot of stories about disastrous situations in which a lot of people died. To add to that, I was addicted to writing bad endings to the point that people said that, if one of my stories had a happy ending, I\u2019d have gone crazy.Maybe my real sin was that I messed with my readers\u2019 feelings with my bad endings all year round.No, wasn\u2019t that actually rather convincing?So what actually were the novels I wrote?What would happen to me if I were transported into one of them?[City of the Dead]A zombie novel.I was quite sure I\u2019d die in a single day.[Surviving in the Ruined World]Post-Apocalypse.I was here in hell because I couldn\u2019t even survive in our peaceful, normal world, you know? Didn\u2019t I just get killed by some malicious comments?[The Demon King is Dead]This novel got the worst ratings, but in my opinion it was the best.Because this was a slice-of-life novel.As I was criticized by my readers for always writing bad ends, I wrote this novel that didn\u2019t have any serious global crisis from beginning to end. I actually didn\u2019t finish it, but the beginning was rose-colored, very refreshing and peaceful.This novel told the story of what happened after the heroes defeated the final boss in the prologue.That\u2019s why its title was \u2018The Demon King is Dead\u2019.This story took place after the death of the Demon King after all.At least it\u2019s not like my other stuff, where one had to fight for one\u2019s survival from start to finish.I must get this one. No matter what.I just had to get this one!Speaking of the results.It worked out just the way I wanted.As a result of a random lottery, I was to become the \u201cDemon King\u2019s son\u201d of [The Demon King is Dead].* * *The Demon King\u2019s son wasn\u2019t a character that even made an appearance in my novel in the first place.She told me that I\u2019d get put into a random character, however I actually got something that couldn\u2019t even be called a character.An unlucky person would break their nose even if they fell backwards, huh.That\u2019s what she told me.Didn\u2019t I just die because I got too mad about some comments which led my blood pressure to rise?Just as I was relieved that I drew the safest novel, I got put into a position in which I\u2019d die right at the start!I wouldn\u2019t even be the Demon King, but just a prince.It would have been much better if I were the Demon King. For example, if I were the Demon King I\u2019d also be the highest-level existence of the Demon realm, so I could have just stayed put, surrendered or ran away.Even though the Demon King dies right at the start, he\u2019s not to be trifled with.However, I was just a prince of the Demon Realm who just turned 17.Valier Jr.Age : 17Status : [Force: 3.4(F)][Agility 4.3(F+)][Dexterity 5.2(D-)][Magic power 9.9(C-)][Strength 5.7(D-)]Race : ArcdemonTalent : NoneAbilities[Demon Domination D](Unique to Arcdemons)Comprehensive Ability Assessment \u2013 Lowest Rank DemonCombat Level Assessment \u2013 FDespite getting deceived by this novel, fortunately I was still able to find out who I actually was. A game-like screen appeared before me.I never put this setting into my novel, so was this something those guys who sent me here gave me out of pity?So, in terms of tropes, I was in a fairly common situation, in which an author somehow ended up in his own novel with a game system.However, no matter how common the trope was, it would never feel like a familiar situation if it suddenly happened to oneself in reality.I didn\u2019t appreciate this convenient ability in the slightest.Shouldn\u2019t the kin of the Demon King be of a different caliber?Arcdemon was a rather simple species, but wasn\u2019t my current condition basically the worst of the worst?This guy had no fighting capabilities.I saw something that seemed like an ability to rule over all demons, but all around me were just dead demons.What a hellish situation.It was the start of the prologue.[Event Quest: Downfall][Description : The defeat of the Demon King\u2019s army is imminent, but you\u2019re powerless to do anything. Do your best to survive.][Goal : Escape the Demon King\u2019s Castle][Reward : 100 achievement points]All I could do was run.I didn\u2019t even pay attention to that mysterious system window that appeared in front of me.-Kabaang! Bababaaang!\u201cCrazy!\u201dThere\u2019s nothing I could do to stop the war.It seemed like the Demon King and the hero\u2019s party were already fiercely fighting inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle.The violent explosions and thunderous roars made me realize that this bloody war was really happening.Outside, there were shouts, screams and cries of monsters as a siege was taking place. They seemed to have already broken through.The hallways were already lined with dead or fallen demons.I couldn\u2019t even imagine a person dying in front of me, but it was even worse seeing monsters that have only existed in my head previously dying right there.Still, maybe because I felt like death was imminent, I kept running.I thought I\u2019d die if I stopped to vomit.Aren\u2019t I such a good prince of the Demon Realm?\u201cDamn iiiiiiiit!\u201dHowever, having this title while the Demon Realm was falling apart was much more dangerous!I\u2019d rather replace it with Human Soldier 1!I\u2019m really confident that I can switch sides and bow down to whoever!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2In this slice-of-life novel I\u2019ve written, I was experiencing the most violent event as an involved party, to be exact, as a victim.Strange letters I didn\u2019t recognize were carved into the walls above each entrance to the numerous rooms of the Demon King\u2019s castle. However, I was able to read them.Although this, too, was a common setting, it still felt uncomfortable, maybe because I was experiencing it myself.You didn\u2019t know how it felt to suddenly be able to read letters you were unfamiliar with, until you experienced it yourself.I passed by numerous rooms, including the dining hall, the kitchen, the armory, the magic item storage, the alchemy lab, the prison and the kennel.Of course, there were no signs pointing to a secret passage\u00a0 or something.I mean, it would have been weird If they put something like that on display, but couldn\u2019t they at least mark it like an emergency exit?I must say, it felt really strange being able to read a language I have never heard of before, but that couldn\u2019t be helped now.Naturally, the layout of the Demon King\u2019s castle, which never appeared again after the Prologue, didn\u2019t magically appear in my head!In those other possession stories, when a writer or an avid reader entered the book\u2019s world, they immediately knew what to look for.That was just ridiculous!I didn\u2019t have a single clue about these things, even though I wrote it!I\u2019ve never thought about stuff like that. Why should I describe or imagine places that weren\u2019t part of the main stage?!Although, I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t have remembered the layout even if I set it up properly!Even the things I was wearing were just those fancy clothes the demonic royal family wore, not a single special magical item.-Kugong! Kugogogong!This place was as complex as a maze\u2026 I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever find an exit, but in this situation I had no other choice, but to just wander around through this castle even though I hold the title of Prince of the Demon Realm.Let\u2019s think.I didn\u2019t really know what I was hoping would happen, but I had to think.There\u2019s no way to find out the structure of the Demon King\u2019s castle no matter how long I thought about it, as I didn\u2019t even know it to begin with.I didn\u2019t even see any of my loyal subordinates that could help me out or tell me where to go.Shouldn\u2019t there be someone like this sticking to my side?They\u2019d provide explanations on this world\u2019s common sense and the current situation without being prompted to.Something like: \u201cOh, this is this and that, but in this and this situation, this is where you\u2019d blah, blah!\u201dThey\u2019d either die right after they fulfilled their role or they became my advisor!Why didn\u2019t I have someone like that?!Just because I was this novel\u2019s writer, did they\u00a0 think I didn\u2019t need someone like that?The Demon King would die in today\u2019s battle.I didn\u2019t know if there was a genre for this, but I tried writing this novel in the style of a Post-ending story.A happy world after the story came to its conclusion.The part where everyone lived happily ever after, after defeating the Demon King.The world after the story of the heroes\u2019 journey to defeat the Demon King came to its conclusion after his death.That\u2019s the stage of [The Demon King is Dead].The hero and his party, who were the protagonists of the imaginary original story, are supposed to die here as well.Like this, the only way they get mentioned in the story is when they get praised as the heroes who saved the world. Except in the Prologue, they didn\u2019t have any other appearances.I had to come up with something.I had to come up with a way for me to survive.It had nothing to do with me that the Demon King, who was only my father, would die in this setting.If I was just a day earlier I could have maybe done something, but things were already set in motion.I needed someone to guide me, anyone who recognized me would do, the Demon King\u2019s attendant, anyone, but I didn\u2019t even catch the glimpse of a single hair of someone like that.They might already be dead or locked in battle with the human forces trying to besiege the castle outside.And the hero party who infiltrated through the castle\u2019s basement should\u2019ve been fighting with the Demon King in the audience hall.I could escape using that underground passage, but I had no idea where it was.The hero knows this Castle better than me, the Demon Prince! That was my situation!-Ruuuumble!Just the sounds coming from the main stage were really terrifying.After the Demon King died, the castle would fall.The strong magic barrier that was supported by the Demon King\u2019s Mana would be lifted, and human soldiers would rush in here like surging waves.I couldn\u2019t look in the mirror, but I could feel a pair of horns on my head.I didn\u2019t know how different I looked from humans, but this alone was enough to reveal that I was a demon.How was I supposed to survive in a situation like this?No matter how much you knew what was going to happen in the future, what\u2019s the point of that if you were born right before a truck drives you over?The Title of Demon Prince and the advantages I actually had were only useful if I was alive!I only found out that I died a few hours ago, but here I was already on the verge of dying again.\u201cHah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dI was already out of breath, because I ran around the Demon King\u2019s castle without knowing where I was.Wasn\u2019t there anything special about the Demon King\u2019s bloodline?Or was it because I was still so young?No, this body was just hella weak.How could I be 17 and have such poor stamina? This body should be in its prime!I have no idea what talents this blood brought with it, but for now it was clearly useless.After running for some time, I finally was able to see my own face reflected in a window.I looked at it, but it didn\u2019t seem much different from a human\u2019s.I had horns on my head though.No.These horns were the only thing that stood out besides\u2026I looked quite handsome.\u201cOh, oh\u2026. Oh!\u201dHandsome.No, now wasn\u2019t the time for this. Absolutely not.It was all over if I died!To think I\u2019d feel even the slightest bit of happiness in this kind of situation\u2026.I felt more miserable about getting happy. I tried to endure not to shout out in fear or joy.If I survive this place, I\u2019ll treat this body preciously. I wish I could show my ex-girlfriend my current body, though I won\u2019t be able to see her ever again\u2026Let\u2019s calm down for now.First, the horns.The horns on my head were a problem.If the human army caught me like this, I should be grateful if they just quietly cut my head off.There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019d do even worse.If I knew how to use magic, maybe I could have changed my appearance with magic.Huh?I suddenly stopped running.\u201cThat place!\u201dI quickly turned around and ran back.That method might be surprisingly simple. So simple, one could call it ridiculous.Although I had no clue about the Demon King\u2019s castle\u2019s layout, I definitely remembered the places I passed by.Although I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s in those rooms or what I could do in them.In the places I passed by, there might be something that could save me somehow.-Rumble\u2026.The quaking was starting to abate.It seemed like the fight had stopped.If the Demon King died, the castle would fall immediately.I had no time to lose.* * *\u201cQuickly\u2026. Quickly\u2026.\u201dThe first place I went into was the magic item storage.I didn\u2019t have a clue what was in there, but there had to be something in there that could help me out.There were a lot of magic items rolling around, but those weren\u2019t things I wanted.I went to the scroll storage where scrolls were piled up to the ceiling. There were some missing, but fortunately they were ordered and had the spells they contained written on them.The thing I was looking for was none other than a teleport scroll.Getting out of this place somehow was my top priority.I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do next, but that was something to think about after I got out of here alive.[Inferno][Glacial Strike][Blizzard][Blazing Storm]...There was a scroll cabinet that was apparently once full of powerful magic scrolls, but now it was empty.As a writer, there were many things I had no idea about, but I did know about this world\u2019s common sense and world view.Scrolls that made it easy to cast spells were sinfully expensive and difficult to make.Scrolls containing such powerful attack magic were being treated as powerful strategic weapons by modern standards.Scrolls could even be used by those who didn\u2019t know how to use magic simply by opening them.So they were worth their price.However, currently, the magic scroll cabinet that contained those powerful magic scrolls was empty.We were in the state of an all out war now after all. They took whatever they could with them.Damn it, what if they took all the teleportation scrolls with them? I don\u2019t know how they were going to use them, but that was definitely a possibility.I searched the huge scroll storage and looked through countless scrolls.I didn\u2019t have much time.Most of the attack magic scrolls got taken out, but the storage was still overflowing with scrolls.There were some so small, I couldn\u2019t even tell what magic they contained.Many subtype scrolls were left behind, such as fascination, delusion, illusion etc.Obviously teleportation was one of the highest leveled magic spells in this world.Teleport scrolls weren\u2019t common, but this was the Demon King\u2019s castle, for crying out loud.And after looking at that highest-level scroll cabinet just now, it was pretty clear that they should have teleport scrolls as well.\u201cFound it!\u201dAmong the pile of countless scrolls, I finally found it.[Teleport]I didn\u2019t really know where to go.I\u2019ll just think about where to go after I cast the magic.As long as it wasn\u2019t this place, I was fine with anywhere.Even somewhere in the human realm was fine.It may have taken me 10 minutes or maybe an hour to find this, but death came closer with each passing second, so I just opened the scroll quickly.And then.Nothing happened.[Teleporting is forbidden in this area.]\u201cOh my god!\u201dThe barrier made it impossible to use space related skills or magic that moved one through space inside of it.Even Though the Demon King was dead, was the barrier that interrupted space travel still active?Well, if that weren\u2019t the case the heroes would\u2019ve just teleported in and wouldn\u2019t have used a secret passage.I tried to justify my thoughtless rough writing.The heroes didn\u2019t have to teleport, they just entered the Demon King\u2019s castle through a secret passage.Wasn\u2019t it obvious? If they could teleport, why would they use a secret passage?There should\u2019ve been that kind of comment.If someone commented something like this while I was still alive, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten punished like this.I didn\u2019t know about warp gates, but teleport scrolls were out of question now.There might be such a gate somewhere, but even if there was, I wouldn\u2019t know where it was.-Waaaaaaah!Shouts began to echo from afar.The human army must be pushing the demon army back, after their morale had fallen to the bottom, like autumn leaves.Should I just die like this?If I just had some offensive magic scrolls here, I\u2019d have bought time with those.However, there were only auxiliary magic scrolls, that had no use in war, here.I was the Prince of the Demon Realm, but I turned out to be some loser dog with no power.The fancy clothes I wore on my body were only to show that I was the main character of the Demon Realm\u2026\u2026A minute later.Fancy clothes.My appearance as a Demon.And.Magic scrolls scattered around the floor.There was still one straw I could grab onto.* * *I didn\u2019t know if this would work, but that was the only thing left I could do now.There might be other methods, but to survive, I had to gamble with my life anyway.In this situation in which I was completely surrounded and didn\u2019t know the location of the secret passage, I had only one goal. To survive.Where I arrived was.\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dThe [Prison]As I descended to this dark, moldy smelling place, I threw away all my clothes and went in naked.It would have been nice to just have a few extra scrolls with me, but I had to gamble and throw everything away.If I had something with me, that would have been too suspicious.The magic spell I wanted to use was a low-level one.However, in my situation it was the most fitting spell. One, my plan wouldn\u2019t work without.[Casting Camouflage Magic.]I changed my appearance.I disguised myself as a human prisoner caught by the Demons.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3The huge confinement facility was in the form of a prison. I couldn\u2019t help but be speechless at the disgusting stench and horrifying sight in front of me.If what I\u2019d seen up until now were the corpses of demons that got attacked by the heroes that infiltrated the castle, then what was found here were\u2026.All corpses of humans.\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201dThere were no guards, but it looked like they had just killed all the prisoners before they went to the battlefield. I felt vomit coming up, but I held it in.Most of them were horribly torn to shreds. They were disastrous corpses. I couldn\u2019t even tell what they were subjected to.I didn\u2019t have any time to hesitate, but my hands and feet just couldn\u2019t stop trembling.There was, of course, a difference between writing something and seeing something in person. The unrecognizable, torn corpses were very hard to look at.There was a mixture of blood and feces everywhere.Someone died right outside an open cell door, perhaps they tried to escape.It looked so bad that I didn\u2019t even want to look at it.I was on the verge of cussing myself out.This was what I was looking for.\u201cGod fucking damn it\u2026. damn it.\u2026.\u201dWere the sins I committed in my previous life so great?To the point that I had to strip off the clothes of corpses whose shapes were unrecognizable just to survive?I put down my fancy clothes to pick up rags and wear them. I stripped the rags from a corpse that should be called pieces of flesh rather than a corpse. I couldn\u2019t afford any unnecessary pride so I took off my underwear as well and rolled around on the dirty floor with the rags on.The feeling of having sticky blood on my face was terrible.I had no opportunity to look in a mirror, but I must have looked terrible. In the end, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and kneeled over.\u201cHuueewek!\u201dI gagged, but nothing came out. I could hear shouts coming from outside that seemed like distant echoes.With this my preparations were completed.I could either go into a prison cell in a corner and lock myself in or I could pretend that I managed to escape.From now on, all I could do was pray that no one could look through my camouflage magic.By the way, who the hell was I supposed to pray to?Shit.I wandered around the prison cell in a miserable mood. The prison cell, which was previously filled with so many people to the point of bursting, now housed nothing but corpses.Did they have to kill them all?Is that what demons are like?And.-Sob. Sob, sob\u2026.I could hear someone crying somewhere.There were survivors.I didn\u2019t know who, but someone was still alive here. I instinctively moved towards that place. Fear rose, but I couldn\u2019t help, but go look. My body moved faster than I thought.Before anything else, I thought I should help whoever was alive in this horrifying place. These sentiments also gave me a sense of relief as it was proof that I was still a normal person.\u201cWh, who\u2026.. Is anyone there\u2026?\u201d\u2013 Urg\u2026. Sob. sob\u2026\u2026.It was a very quiet, powerless, fragmented cry, like the cry of a small animal.I passed by a few gruesome sights showcased in the prison cells.\u201cSob\u2026. uuh\u2026. hnng\u2026.\u201dSoon, I could see a little girl crying in a cracked voice, hugging something shaped like a human.I could roughly guess what kind of situation this was.There was also a mass of bodies and flesh scattered about.I hated to assume this, but judging by the remains, there seemed to have been five of them there. The crying girl not included. She was crying while hugging a corpse with an uncertain form, as if she didn\u2019t even realize I was in front of her.I couldn\u2019t even tell how that corpse died or how this child survived.However, the only thing I could tell was that this corpse the girl was holding was probably someone precious to her.\u201cHey, calm down\u2026.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Urg, sob! Don\u2019t!\u201dOnly after I knocked against the cage did the girl lift her head and look at me.Although she was covered in blood, I could tell that she had blonde hair and golden eyes. She was very skinny.The girl looked at me, got startled and pulled back.\u201cH, huh! Wh, wh\u2026\u2026 Who. Who, how\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, do, don\u2019t worry! I\u2026 I was stuck here too!\u201dThe girl was mumbling gibberish as if she lost all her reason.\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll get you out. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201dThe girl\u2019s eyes were filled with fear and sadness. She seemed to think of something as she looked at me, a person in rags like her.The girl looked at my eyes, arms and legs.She was looking at me who was terrified by these harrowing sights I was never exposed to before. Then the girl nodded slowly and softly.She was shaking, but it felt like she had chosen to believe me. As if she had no other choice but to trust me, when she suddenly encountered me in this incomprehensible environment.Did she believe I was in the same situation as her, because I was affected by these sights? This was only possible because I wasn\u2019t a Demon Prince at my core.\u201cHey, do you know where the keys are? I\u2019ll bring them over.\u201d\u201cM, maybe\u2026\u2026 The, there\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout a word the girl pointed to the other end of the prison.It\u2019s true that I felt compelled to save this child.However, it was also true that I had these calculating thoughts that my chances of survival would increase if other survivors could testify that I was also imprisoned here.* * *I didn\u2019t know which one the right key was, so I brought all the key rings I could find in the warden\u2019s office at the end of the prison cells. While I was trying every key, the girl kept on crying.She was just crying. As if she lost all hope.\u201cCan you hear the sounds outside?\u201d\u201c Yes\u2026.\u201dThe shouts of the humans could be heard. I couldn\u2019t go into detail, but I somehow wanted to tell her that everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201dInevitably, this war had already been won by the humans. At my fearful yet confident words, the girl continued to weep and nodded her head. Finding the right key took a lot of time. I wondered if it was really necessary to open the door, but I wanted to get her out of that miserable place for now.\u201cIt might be dangerous to go out, but\u2026. Let\u2019s open it up for now. Even if you don\u2019t want to go out of there\u201d\u201cYe, yes\u2026\u2026 \u201dThe girl\u2019s voice was shaking violently. Rather, it seemed that she lost control of her emotions after meeting another living human like her.Still, I, as the older of us two, should put her mind at ease.\u201cCalm down\u2026. We\u2019ll live. You\u2019ll be able to live.\u201dThat\u2019s also what I wanted to say to myself.You have to get out of this goddamn place and survive.I had to. I mumbled \u201cLet\u2019s calm down, let\u2019s calm down, we can live\u201d to myself as if I was trying to hypnotise myself.Just looking at her I could tell that she was seriously skinny. I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how hungry she must be.Ah.Come to think of that.\u201cWait, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cH, huh? Huh?\u201dI ran somewhere instead of continuing to try to open the door with one of the keys. The child seemed to be calling me, but I ran like the wind and rummaged through the clothes I had taken off.Then I came back with the stuff I pulled out from there.\u201cSee. I found this in the place the keys were.\u201dI didn\u2019t have to tell her the truth, so I told her a little lie and handed her a biscuit. It was a biscuit I had unnecessarily in my pocket. I just remembered that I threw it away together with my clothes.\u201cYou must be hungry, so eat this.\u201dThe girl suddenly saw a palm-sized biscuit in her hand, which made her open her eyes wide. Yeah, things are sad and depressing, but you should also feel hellishly hungry. The girl was staring blankly at me who gave her the whole biscuit.\u201cY, y\u2026\u2026 You?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. You eat first.\u201dI started fumbling with the keys again. The girl was silently staring, as if she was trying to decide if it was fine for her to eat it or not. Time passed, then-Crunch!Along with that sound, something got pushed against my mouth, while I was still preoccupied with finding the right key.\u201cY, you, too\u2026\u2026 You eat, too.\u201dThe girl wept and offered me half of the biscuit. How much determination did it take her to cut it and give me half of it?I felt emotional for some reason.Are we like this just to atone for some kind of sin we committed? Didn\u2019t I atone enough by dying after reading some malicious comments already?My eyes turned cold, as I started to feel indignant for no apparent reason.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe girl started to cry again after she bit into the biscuit. I didn\u2019t know whether she cried because it was delicious or because she was sad. What does food taste like after having endured such terrible hunger?I didn\u2019t know, but I thought I knew to some extent why she cried.-Clack!As soon as I took a bite out of the biscuit, the iron door opened.* * *The cage was open, but the girl didn\u2019t come out. Perhaps she didn\u2019t want to leave that body she was holding behind. I was about to carry it out as well, however, I knew that it wasn\u2019t such a good idea to go outside. It might still be dangerous.It was for the best to wait here.So rather than opening the prison cell to let someone out I did this bizarre thing of walking into it.\u201cCan \u2026\u2026. the Demon King be killed\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI think he\u2019s already dead.I wasn\u2019t fazed by the death of my unknown biological father. The girl quivered and murmured things while shedding tears, her head buried in her knees.\u201cArtorius said he\u2019d come rescue us\u2026\u2026.\u201dUnfortunately, the Demon King probably dragged Artorius down with him. He wouldn\u2019t be able to save us, but the human side will most probably come here.\u201cYeah. Someone\u2019s coming to save us.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just a speculation, it was the truth. However, whether the army will come to save me or not was the most important thing. I mean, I wasn\u2019t the Demon King after all.\u201cI can\u2019t hear them anymore.\u201dThe girl trembled. The overflowing roars suddenly came to a halt. Thinking that the human army was defeated, the girl grew more and more afraid.I reached out and hugged her by the shoulders.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThe girl seemed surprised that I said that.\u201cYou\u2026. You are so calm\u2026.\u201dThese words seemed kind of eerie and made me stiffen a little\u201cOh, no. I, I\u2019m\u2026\u2026 Also very scared.\u201dI think it was because I was next to a child, so I exaggerated a little, but it\u2019s true that I was scared as all hell. You\u2019d be fine, but I might get my head cut off soon.Still, the girl didn\u2019t seem suspicious of my calmness.\u201cWhat\u2019s your\u2026. Name?\u201dThe girl asked for my name.My name was Valier Jr. here. Since the Demon King Valier was dead, my name must be Valier now. I couldn\u2019t tell her that name. That would be like I was asking to get myself killed. To begin with, even a normal human would get stoned if they named themselves after the Demon King.\u201cThat, see\u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t remember\u2026.\u201dIn the end, I gave her the first excuse that came to my mind.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember anything. Who I am, why I\u2019m here\u2026\u2026 Everything.\u201dThat was the most convenient excuse I could come up with.Amnesia.I decided on going with the setting of having lost my memory after these endless days of merciless torture.I can\u2019t believe the day would come when I had to use this dog-like concept.\u201cSob\u2026\u2026. What should we do\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl hugged me as if she felt sorry for me.I felt a little guilty because she believed it so quickly. The girl held me in her slender arms, but she gave me a bit of strength as well.\u201cI, if I could get out of here\u2026\u2026 If I get out\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely get your memories back\u2026\u2026 I promise.\u201dHmm?How though?-Clack, clackBefore I could finish thinking, I heard someone running from a distance. It wasn\u2019t the only thing I could hear.-This seems to be the prison!-They\u2019re all dead!Those were definitely human voices. People who I couldn\u2019t tell if they were knights or soldiers rushed to check the prison cells and finally met our eyes.\u201cHoly, survivors! We have survivors!\u201dThe emotional exclamation from the one who found us rang through the prison.Tears welled up in the girl\u2019s eyes, and my heart started racing like crazy in a weird mix of fear, excitement and relief.Then a middle-aged knight followed the shouts and finally stepped before us. As soon as he saw the girl, his face horribly contorted.\u201cOh, oooh\u2026\u2026 Oh, woe, Her Majesty the Princess\u2026.\u201dNo\u2026..No, what?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: 4The girl I spoke with was none other than Charlotte de Gardias, the first princess of the Gardias Empire, the largest Empire on the continent.Let\u2019s say this was like these common situations.Let\u2019s say I was really a prisoner in the Demon King\u2019s Castle and I really suffered from amnesia.I then proceeded to try to get a crying girl out of her cell without knowing what happened, comforted her and even got her something to eat because I pitied her for starving like that. However, she turned out to actually be the imperial princess who was captured by the demon king army!Then let\u2019s say I was to be rescued together with the princess.So let\u2019s just say that the princess was to tell them to treat me with their utmost respect.The best expression that would fit this was \u201cwhat a cliche\u201d.However.I was a demon who changed his appearance with low-level camouflage magic.What, wasn\u2019t I kind of screwed if things developed like that?I was led out of the Demon King\u2019s Castle like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse, and arrived at a place close to the barracks of the commander-in-chief of the Demon Conquest Army garrison far away from the battlefield.Countless wizards and priests got close to the princess and immediately jumped into action. They also took some measures on me.To my relief, I didn\u2019t have any undead attributes so the healing magic the priests cast on me didn\u2019t cause damage or something. It sure was fortunate that I didn\u2019t have a constitution that rejected sacred power.Of course, I already knew that that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. If it were, I wouldn\u2019t even have tried to get rescued by the human\u2019s side.Not long after I became a dirty bastard, a lot of people clung to me to wash, wipe and clean me. It was a hot day, but the fear that I might die if I made a mistake made me overcome everything.If a wizard cast a spell to, for example, dispel curses on me, everything would be over. Fortunately, a large number of troops were put into searching the Demon King\u2019s Castle, and it seemed difficult for them to just take care of the Princess as there were a lot of bleeding and injured people among the wizard forces.However, the question was, was Charlotte naturally good-natured or did she somehow take a liking to me?\u201cPlease look after this person. He\u2019s my benefactor after all.\u201dIn the end, the problem was that she cared too much about me.Despite her own lack of energy, she was constantly instructing them to take care of me first. I bowed to the girl I put my arm around not too long ago.\u201cN, no. It\u2019s alright, Your Highness. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m really healthy. Yes.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t even do anything special.\u201cYou said you lost your memory. You must have had a severe curse put on you.\u201d\u201cN, no, that\u2019s not it! I don\u2019t need to remember. Yeah, it\u2019s not such a big deal. Yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201dNo, I know you\u2019re a nice girl, but won\u2019t you leave me some space?You\u2019re giving me much too much for just one biscuit.Eventually, I was allowed to lie in the private room next to the barracks after persuading the nursing staff who couldn\u2019t even catch a break taking care of me and the princess. They were close to collapsing.First of all.I felt like I just escaped a collapsing cave only to jump into the mouth of a tiger.[Event complete \u2013 Downfall][You have earned 100 achievement points.]I somehow broke through the first hurdle..* * *The princess\u2019 consideration for me was persistent.After some essential first aid was over, the princess summoned me back to the barracks.There was a huge amount of food set on a table.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have eaten well. Go ahead and eat.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026. Yes.\u201dHowever, I couldn\u2019t easily touch it. There were too many eyes looking at me right now. The princess stared at me and nodded as if she understood what was going on.She seemed to think that I was someone that couldn\u2019t get even a single corn of rice down my throat if so many people were looking at me.The princess looked at the surrounding guards, wizards and priests.\u201cGo out and wait.\u201d\u201cBu, but Your Highness\u2026.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the Demon King is dead and this place became safe?\u201dAt the princess\u2019 gentle command, everyone left the barracks, leaving only me and the princess behind. She looked at me quietly.\u201cLet\u2019s eat quickly.\u201d\u201cYes, huh? Ah, yes. Yes.\u201dThe princess grabbed the roasted turkey leg with her bare hands and began to bite into it.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like she kicked them out because she wanted to eat comfortably.\u201cE, erm\u2026\u2026 Uh. Wo, won\u2019t we get sick\u2026\u2026?\u201dIf one starved for such a long time and ate something like this, wouldn\u2019t it cause problems in the stomach that may lead to one\u2019s death?Do you trust the priests outside so much?\u201cYou, too. Quickly eat.\u201dThere was no point telling her that.* * *The meal was quite large, so I had time to sort out my thoughts while the princess munched away.In the Prologue, the Demon King Valier died, but there was a situation that happened before that.An all-out war between the humans and the Demon Realm called the Demon World, the Demon World War.Naturally, since there was a war going on, the hero destroyed the Demon King. Although they ended up destroying each other.Although the reason behind the war wasn\u2019t known, it was started under the Demons\u2019 name. Demon King Valier had incredibly powerful forces and tried to make the Human Coalition surrender.Valier used his spies hidden in various parts of the Human Forces to kidnap key figures of the Coalition. He kidnapped politicians, kings, powerful warriors and wizards themselves or their families to prevent them from participating in the war.And the most important hostage was the First Princess of the Gardias Empire and her mother.Valier succeeded in kidnapping the Empress and the Princess. If the Emperor pulled out of the war, it was clear that the other forces would follow one after the other.However, the Emperor knew that giving up on the Demon World War would be a great mistake. If the Empire pulled out, it would\u2019ve been destroyed.In the end, he had no choice but to give up on the hostages and launch an all-out war. All the hostages were killed, but after many twists and turns, the princess survived.Was it something like that.\u2026?No. I don\u2019t think so.Let\u2019s think about it.It\u2019s definitely a novel I wrote, but honestly, I couldn\u2019t remember each and every sentence. The prologue was relatively less memorable. I wrote that part the longest ago after all.The princess, who ate in front of me with a cute face, wasn\u2019t the main character of my novel, which was a school drama.To be honest, I didn\u2019t even know that her name was Charlotte de Gardias. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t remember it, I didn\u2019t know it in the first place. It wasn\u2019t like not remembering the name of someone passing by, but later when seeing the name of said person written down going \u201cOh, right there was someone like that.\u201d.I couldn\u2019t remember the princess\u2019 name at all.Let\u2019s think about this some more.What I wrote had become reality.As a result, all the parts that I hadn\u2019t imagined got filled in.This was the world I knew and at the same time, it was a world filled with things I didn\u2019t recognize at all.The soldiers guarding the door outside each had their own pasts, but I didn\u2019t know them. Even though this is the world I thought up, it was natural that things were like this. This was like virtual settings suddenly becoming reality after all.Therefore, there would always be events in this world happening even though I hadn\u2019t described them and there should also be events that already happened. There were things in the past, present and future I had no clue about.However, the sentences I wrote would definitely come true.The Emperor gave up on the hostages and launched an all-out war. The subjugation of the Demon Realm was successful and if the Emperor pulled out of the war because of the hostages he would have received a lot of backlash by the other participants and the possibility of the Empire falling because of that wasn\u2019t small.This was true.And I never wrote anything about the first princess, which must be quite important for the main narrative. Of course, this was supposed to be just a normal slice-of-life school thing, however the imperial family\u2019s history got mentioned slightly as well.However, the first princess was right in front of me and yet I have never written anything about this girl. Although this might be misguided inference, what if there was a character with the role of princess abducted by the Demon King? Wouldn\u2019t I\u2019ve forced her into the narrative and made her more important?An important character that was sure to appear on the main stage, to deviate from the main narrative isn\u2019t something that should occur.Although the princess should occupy an important role later in the story, she doesn\u2019t even appear in the future.She was the first princess who survived the Demon World War, you know?However, why doesn\u2019t this character appear and why do I as the writer have no clue about her?I had no choice but to regard my own novel as some kind of prophecy. I had to do this strange thing where I had to interpret my own writing.The writer was usually ignorant of the vestiges of the story, however now I was experiencing said vestiges. They would now be and will be filled with things and I have no idea, with what.I had to locate the blanks of the story that were filled as this world became reality and connect them to the future I knew.I had to deduce how this bivalent narrative affected the future I knew. The princess was rescued like this right now, but she didn\u2019t appear in the future in the imperial family\u2019s story at all.I had to figure out the answer using two facts.There were two possible answers.First.My existence somehow made the princess who was supposed to die immediately live.It didn\u2019t seem strange that the princess who was crying all alone could maybe take her own life. Also, she was extremely malnourished. However, could that just be solved with a single biscuit? Anyway, there was a possibility that my existence saved the princess. It was very low, but it was there.Second.This possible answer relied on the assumption that there may have been a huge event happening in my novel of which I wasn\u2019t aware of.For instance, the big events I wrote would still flow as intended. There may be other reasons behind that.So, let\u2019s say event A happened. I did write a description for it, but behind the scenes, there might have been a completely different factor that caused event A to happen.Let\u2019s say I wrote, it just happened out of nowhere. What should I do in that case? Let\u2019s say the reasoning was written irresponsibly like that.However, it wouldn\u2019t be too absurd for there to be a backstory, a reason for this to happen the moment this world became reality. In other words, there might have been some kind of probability correction.That was what happened when I tried to use the teleportation scroll a while ago.So I\u2019d know what incidents were going to happen in this world, but not why. This was a very strange situation. This all happened because I wrote this story so irresponsibly and rough without explaining things properly.Was this my punishment for being imprecise?So, unless I was the reason for the princess\u2019 survival, there was only one more answer.She would be killed or would die soon.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201dThe cute little princess asked me calmly.* * *Even in slice-of-life stories, villains were needed. There may be slice-of-life stories without villains, but these were in the realm of masterpieces. The presence of a villain simplified the narrative process. If one just wrote a bad guy did it, one can explain away a lot of things.Why did he do that? If someone asked something like this, one could just explain it with \u201cBecause he\u2019s a bad guy lol\u201d.So, I wasn\u2019t skilled enough to write a slice-of-life story without a villain.[The Demon King is Dead]\u2019s main villain was Imperial Prince Bertus de Gardias.There were some minor villains, but the prince was a little different. If one would call the villains found at the Academy kind of sloppy and second-rated, the prince would be the real deal. He was the type to conspire to kill people. I gave him the setting that he\u2019d do anything to become the next emperor.From Bertus\u2019 perspective, the existence of the first princess who returned alive after getting abducted by the demons would only be a thorn in his side. Just because she had gone through such hardship, the princess would be in a position that garnered a lot of attention, and seeing as to how she was the First Princess their succession rights to the throne would be similar.Bertus would be embarrassed to know that the first princess was alive and not dead. He would have, of course, thought that she died, but she came back alive.If that were the case, then there was a good chance that Charlotte would soon be killed by Bertus or one of his people.Charlotte would die behind the scenes at the vestiges of the main story. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to join the main story.Charlotte would probably die soon. The possibility that she won\u2019t even make it to the Empire isn\u2019t that low either.Charlotte would be in danger soon. I don\u2019t know how though. While I was thinking about that, the princess was letting out a sigh as she was finally full.Would I be able to save this girl?My life was like a fallen leaf in the wind, so was I even in any position to care about someone else\u2019s life?Wouldn\u2019t it be better for me if Charlotte just died here and the wizards turned their gazes away from me?Just when that thought went through my mind, a sense of horror ran down my spine.I was an ordinary person. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary situation, but I was still just an ordinary person. Just the thought of planning to survive using such a young child\u2019s death already made me feel disgusted with myself.Charlotte was the closest to an ally I had and she was in a situation in which she wouldn\u2019t know when her head might get cut off. Having Charlotte on my side would make her a great force to have though, no matter what unexpected situation might happen in the future.Let\u2019s think like that.The only time we were able to talk was now. After the meal was over, the guards would come back in again. Then we couldn\u2019t talk about any important things.How the hell was I supposed to convey to her that her life was in danger? How was I supposed to explain why I knew that?Charlotte wiped the grease from the corner of her mouth as she looked at me.The look in Charlotte\u2019s eyes, which had been innocent and pure until now, seemed to have suddenly turned cold.Just when I thought that the atmosphere around her suddenly changed, Charlotte talked in a low voice.\u201cNow, listen carefully.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s demeanor was more serious than before.\u201cOur lives are in danger.\u201dCharlotte brought up what I had wanted to say before me.And she told me it\u2019s us who\u2019s in danger, not just her. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s you.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5I had no other choice but to give an evasive answer to Charlotte\u2019s words, that relieved me somewhat.\u201cHu,huh?\u201dThe princess was already aware that her life was in danger.Rather, the way she stared at me so calmly confirmed to me that my guesses were correct. she was looking at me with such serious eyes, as if she was never so preoccupied with the food.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to go into detail, but my half-brother, Bertus, was probably blindly waiting for me to die. For him, knowing that I was still alive, would be like a thorn in his side.\u201dThe girl that was sitting in a prison cell holding her mother\u2019s body and crying was completely gone. Charlotte, who returned to her seat, was calm, as if she realized again that she was a member of the imperial family.However, Bertus actually had a lot of followers. He was a villain, but he sure wasn\u2019t incompetent.\u201cHowever, I don\u2019t know how he plans to kill me. I don\u2019t know who will do it, I just know it will happen soon.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know how she was going to be attacked and Charlotte didn\u2019t know who to trust in this chaotic situation just after the end of a war. Due to most forces searching the Demon King\u2019s Castle and cleaning up the stragglers, almost all the main forces were missing.\u201cAnd the people I turst aren\u2019t here. I think it was intentional.\u201dWhen Charlotte was rescued, she realized that none of her own were around. Then something flashed through my mind like lightning.\u201cHoh, so that\u2019s why you told the people to leave\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, yes.\u201dIn the first place, she kicked everyone out except me because she couldn\u2019t be sure if any of them would end up being her killer except me.Rather, Charlotte was a lot more cautious than I was.She didn\u2019t know who to trust, or when she\u2019d be killed. How could one know if they hadn\u2019t poisoned the food?\u201cHey, the food might gotten poisoned\u2026.\u201dAt my words, the princess laughed.\u201cIf they poisoned the food, I\u2019d just eat it and die then, in this situation.\u201dShe was so hungry she didn\u2019t care anymore.I couldn\u2019t imagine just how hungry the princess was, but it seemed like she was so starved that she\u2019d rather die than not eat the food in front of her. She was so hungry that she\u2019d even eat poisoned food. Fortunately, there wasn\u2019t any poison in it.\u201cMost people stationed in these barracks will be enemies.\u201d\u201cIs\u2026\u2026 that so?\u201dCharlotte was convinced that not just a few but most of them were her enemies.\u201cI tried to leave the barracks a few times before, but they didn\u2019t let me, with the excuse that I should relax. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re trying to lock me up.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s voice was getting lower and lower.\u201cIt\u2019s not known yet that I was rescued. They didn\u2019t want to announce this either.\u201dIs that so?Even when she got rescued, she came out wrapped in something like a thick coat. Charlotte was convinced that there weren\u2019t other survivors inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201cThey\u2019re probably waiting for instructions on how to deal with me. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t want it to be known that I\u2019m alive. After killing me, there\u2019s a high possibility that they\u2019ll just say I died in the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201dThey would make it out that she died in the Demon King\u2019s Castle, but would keep quiet about her getting rescued, so there they could say that they retrieved the corpse from inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle. Charlotte was looking at a number of possibilities.From the outside it seemed like they cared for the First Princess, however, in reality, it was more like hundreds of people holding Charlotte in custody. Just the thought gave me goosebumps all over my body.It didn\u2019t look like that at all. At least to me.However, Charlotte already knew their intentions.\u201cSo I, who was rescued with you, am also in danger.\u201dObviously, Charlotte said \u2018our\u2019 life is in danger and not \u2018my\u2019 life is in danger after all.This wasn\u2019t just a matter of them finding out if I\u2019m a demon or not anymore.Bertus\u2019 followers would remove anyone who knew the first princess was alive, and I wasn\u2019t going to be an exception.In the end, I was in a position in which I had no other choice but to try my hardest to keep Charlotte safe.\u201cListen. We\u2019ll leave the barracks now.\u201dShe was in even greater danger after getting rescued, so she was planning to escape from this non-surveillance.\u201cAre we even able to run away?\u201dBut with so many soldiers patrolling the grounds, was it even possible to escape properly?\u201cOf course we can\u2019t run away, but that\u2019s not the point.\u201dCharlotte laughed.\u201cI want as many people as possible to know that I\u2019m alive.\u201dHer purpose wasn\u2019t to run away, but to inform the ordinary soldiers of her survival.No.But.I was older.So why did she seem so much smarter than me?Charlotte rose from her seat, while I felt a strange sense of defeat.The meal was over.* * *No one even imagined that Charlotte de Gardias could still be alive, so there wasn\u2019t much surveillance in the barracks Charlotte and I were in. They were now waiting for instructions from above and didn\u2019t seem to think that we\u2019d be able to get away.Even if I called it barracks, it was really just a tent.Escaping from it was simple.I slightly cut the tent in the back with a knife provided for the meal and checked their movements outside.After cutting a hole in the tent, we crawled outside. We came out from the back and not its entrance so there were only a few troops walking around. It was quiet, which was understandable, as most of them were gathered in the Demon King\u2019s Castle and not the garrison.No one seemed to have expected that the princess would feel her life in danger and escaped as soon as she was rescued.Yeah, that was normal. I was surprised by her behavior as well.However, we couldn\u2019t walk around for long. They\u2019d soon find out we were gone. Charlotte knew that as well.\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be caught soon.\u201dOne might wonder why she came out when she knew that she\u2019d be caught soon, however, Charlotte\u2019s purpose was to reveal her own survival to everyone so it didn\u2019t matter.Just rumors about it alone would prolong Charlotte\u2019s life a little longer. Like this, the fact that she was still alive would spread among the ordinary soldiers, preventing her death from being made out as something that happened in the Demon King\u2019s Castle.This could keep her alive for a bit until she found an alternative method.That was Charlotte\u2019s purpose.\u201cYou go ahead.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte\u2019s eyes lit up a little as she looked at me.\u201cYou have to come back as soon as possible.\u201dAt that moment, I was able to catch a glimpse of Charlotte\u2019s fear of having to face death again.Yes.You must live, no matter what.I left Charlotte behind and started running through the grounds.-H, her, her Majesty the Princess?-Her Majesty the Princess is alive!Soon after, the cries of the remaining troops could be heard echoing through the camp.Charlotte would be taken back to the HQ barracks, but that would leave me with greater freedom of movement.\u2018If they find out that you\u2019re gone, they\u2019ll naturally try to find you as well. Run as far as possible. They won\u2019t try to kill you right away, but they will definitely kill you.\u2019\u2018Find Sir Francis and make sure to come back together with him.\u2019\u2018I need you to find him and make him my escort.\u2019Just before we left the tent, Charlotte told me as such.Sir Francis.She said she didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be her enemies and who\u2019d be her allies.However, she said that there was only one person who could never be her enemy.The knight who rescued us, Francis.If he had been Bertus\u2019 minion he would\u2019ve killed us right on the spot, but saved us himself. That was why he couldn\u2019t be one of Bertus\u2019 servants.From the moment she got rescued, Charlotte already had a hunch that she was about to face another crisis before she was even able to be happy about having gotten saved.Originally, Charlotte would eventually get killed even though she was aware of the danger to her life. Charlotte couldn\u2019t do anything on her own to survive even with her wits. Which meant\u2026My success or failure determined Charlotte\u2019s life or death.Charlotte couldn\u2019t find Francis on her own. Perhaps she gave orders to bring him to her, but those orders wouldn\u2019t have been carried out.In the end, I had to find him myself and bring him to Charlotte\u2019s side.The soldiers coming and going from the vast barracks only titled their heads when they saw me running around, but none came directly towards me. While Charlotte\u2019s face was well known, mine was not, hence, making this possible.I approached one of the passing soldiers who looked like an officer and asked him.\u201cDo, do you know where Sir Francis is?\u201dHe looked down at me and nodded.\u201cWell? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI have an urgent message from the Commander-in-chief.\u201dIf I mentioned the princess here, it might take me some time to explain, so I had no choice but to cover this up with lies. He scanned my body and clothes from top to bottom. Fortunately, I changed into luxurious clothes, so I wasn\u2019t just dismissed.If I had worn the rags, he would have told me to get lost.\u201cI don\u2019t know Sir Francis very well, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s searching through the castle. I heard that most of the knights were sent there.\u201dDamn it.After rescuing us, it seemed like he had focused on his original mission, searching the castle, again.No.No, wait a second.Bertus\u2019 minions would kill anyone who knew that Charlotte was alive.It\u2019s clear that Francis\u2019 life would also be in jeopardy. He wasn\u2019t loyal to Bertus, so he wouldn\u2019t keep his silence. Bertus, however, would want to eliminate anyone who knew of Charlotte\u2019s survival.I wasn\u2019t the only one whose life depended on Charlotte\u2019s survival.\u201cWe must go find Sir Francis! His life is in danger!\u201d\u201cWha, what?!\u201dI had no choice but to urgently shout to this unknown officer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Perhaps because of the credibility that came with these clothes I wore or my urgent look, the unknown officer immediately put me on a horse without saying anything.Initially, this was a garrison, so it was far from the Demon King\u2019s Castle.How did it come to this? I had worked so hard to get out of there not too long ago and now I was already rushing back to the castle.I\u2019ve never sat on a horse before, however the officer sitting behind me held my body tightly, so I was able to endure the shaking somehow.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me the details? The castle has already been captured, so why is a knight\u2019s life in danger!?\u201dI didn\u2019t know if this person was one of Bertus\u2019 minions or not, but this guy was pretty young.Did Bertus reach out his grubby fingers even down to the level of junior officers?I thought about that for a little while, but this guy was helping me for now.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we find Sir Francis!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dI didn\u2019t need to persuade him any more, as he was still helping me right now. Maybe because this was my first time riding on a horse, my hip felt like it was about to break, but this wasn\u2019t the time to care about something like that.The Demon King\u2019s Castle was a mess as a result of this war and on the surrounding plains, demons who seemed to have been taken captive were being dragged along looking like\u00a0dried corvinas.Not all of them were dead. Some of the Demons surrendered and became prisoners.I felt relieved that not all of them died, however, at the same time I felt guilty for betraying them in the end despite being their prince.\u201cWhat will happen to those Demons?\u201dDespite the urgency of the situation, I posed such a random question.\u201cIf it were a war between humans, we\u2019d take a ransom for them, but they\u2019re demons.\u201dHe talked as if I asked something strange.\u201cWe\u2019ve taken them prisoner for now, but what else would we do other than kill them?\u201dNegotiations were meaningless as their races were different. This was inevitable, because this was originally a war of annihilation. It was only natural that they were trying to destroy all seeds before they grow.It made my heart heavy. Even though I was an ordinary man who just suddenly entered the body of the demon prince, I couldn\u2019t easily shake off this dirty feeling.The officer and I dashed past the endless procession of prisoners.* * *The wide, open walls were destroyed everywhere and filled with numerous bodies. It felt terrible just seeing the sight of demon and human corpses being lined up next to each other.\u201cIt\u2019s not something a kid should see.\u201dHe showed my kindness by covering my eyes while he rode the horse as he considered me as a child.I couldn\u2019t tell just how many humans and demons had died. We passed through the destroyed gates. Numerous carriages were lined up before it.They continued to load them with materials they found in the Demon King\u2019s Castle.The Demon Realm was destroyed in this Demon World War, and this long-standing conflict was finally resolved by the humans..But the most important was still the material aspect.All countries that participated in the Demon World War would gain enormous wealth from selling the goods of the Demon Realm. So it was set up that a long golden age would start for the land of humans. It\u2019s said that they gained a long peaceful period in exchange for all the blood.However, I would have never imagined I\u2019d get to see this scene from the perspective of the demons. In the end, as if they were treating war as just a simple reason to plunder, numerous military forces swept up all of the Demon King\u2019s Castle\u2019s wealth.Wagons filled to the brim with supplies continued to leave the area and empty wagons kept replacing them. The officer took me to the command post inside the castle where they conducted the transport and search operation.The officer gave a salute to what appeared to be the commander.\u201cLieutenant Dyrus, commander of the 3rd Platoon, 11th Company, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Imperial Corps!\u201dHe shouted his official name with a stiff face. Lieutenant Dyrus. I somehow found out his name. He was in the cavalry, so that\u2019s why he could ride so well even with me being there.The commander opposite of him didn\u2019t seem to have any idea who he was. That\u2019s to be expected. Going by his title he was probably way below the commander.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe officer, who seemed to be a very high-ranking officer, frowned while he looked alternately between me and the junior officer. He seemed like he would severely reprimand him if he couldn\u2019t give a proper explanation why he brought someone who wasn\u2019t even a soldier to this place.\u201cI brought this boy here because he said he had to deliver an urgent message from the Commander-in-chief to Sir Francis. I presumed it to be confidential, so I didn\u2019t ask him what it was.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dSeeing my small lie growing bigger, I felt a chill run down my spine. However, he didn\u2019t ask him why the commander had sent an urgent message through someone like me.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dHis face slightly stiffened. He seemed to know something.\u201cSir Francis\u2026. I just received a report that he was killed in an altercation with one of the demon remnants during the search of the Castle..\u201dBertus was the first to use his hand. Not only my, but also Lieutenant Daryus\u2019 expression hardened.\u201cIs the message something I should know about?\u201d\u201cN, no! I was meant to deliver it to Sir Francis directly!\u201d\u201cWhat a pity. Those damn demons should just curl up and die.\u201dThe commander\u2019s expression was grim, perhaps because he thought that he lost a great knight to the demons.No, well, he was definitely killed by humans and not demons though.\u201cSir, this is not a place for a boy such as him. Hurry back.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dFortunately, the commander didn\u2019t interrogate me about the message or my identity. It seemed like he was too preoccupied with conducting this full-scale search of the castle.After leaving the command post, Lieutenant Dyrus grabbed my shoulder.\u201cHow did this happen? How did the Commander-in-chief know that Sir Francis was in danger?\u201dI said Sir Francis\u2019 life was in danger, and he actually died. I looked at the lieutenant in front of me. It was clear that he had very little authority here.However, now that Sir Francis got already killed, I needed someone else to help me.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Commander-in-chief.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHoping that it wasn\u2019t a mistake to bring this person in.\u201cHer Highness sent me.\u201dI told him the truth.* * *I explained the whole story to him in a secluded area of the castle where soldiers didn\u2019t pass by. I started from the point where the princess was still imprisoned and got rescued.\u201cSo Sir Francis was killed by someone from our army and not the demons?\u201d\u201cYes, maybe\u2026.\u201d\u201cShit. I can\u2019t even imagine how painful it must have been, but they were even trying to harm Her Highness the Princess as soon as she got rescued?\u201dHe clenched his teeth, seeming shocked to hear that there were people who planned such things.\u201cThen you\u2019re trying to rescue the Princess, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAlright, I admire your courage.\u201dHe patted me on the shoulder as if he was proud of me, who tried to save the princess even though I was powerless. Then he seemed amazed by the fact that there were hidden battles going on on their side, just as they claimed victory.\u201cI can\u2019t let that happen. I also want to become the Princess\u2019 power.\u201dEven in this place with so many eyes, somehow an ally got killed by another. That would mean that Bertus\u2019 minions were spread out throughout the whole Imperial Army.\u201cI have to get to her as soon as possible. I\u2019m not as skilled as Sir Francis, but just having one more pair of eyes should be meaningful enough.\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201dFortunately, Dyrus seemed to have a strong sense of justice and couldn\u2019t let this slide. I didn\u2019t tell him anything like he had to risk his life. He seemed to think that it was only natural to give up his life if that meant he could protect her.Just when he was about to leave as fast as he could, I had a thought pass through my head.\u201cLieutenant. Wait.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? I have to go back quickly.\u201dI pointed at the lot of carts.\u201cThere\u2019s a way to protect the princess right now.\u201dYes, I dared to return to the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201cThis is the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201d\u201cRight. What about it?\u201d\u201cI saw that there was a storage room for magic items there when I got rescued.\u201dI\u2019ve come this far, so I couldn\u2019t just go back empty-handed.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we look for a teleport scroll there?\u201dSpaceshifting scrolls couldn\u2019t be used here, but they\u2019d obviously work in the garrison.Using that spell, the princess could be taken out of this dangerous place right away. I hoped that the scroll vault hadn\u2019t been plundered yet.If so, then the teleport scroll I was trying to use was obviously still there.We couldn\u2019t attempt asking a wizard to teleport us. They\u2019d surely trap us.Dyrus seemed hesitant. He looked doubtful whether it was the right choice to go look for some teleport scroll that may or may not exist.However, I knew the location of the teleport scroll. Once I confirmed that it had been stolen, we could leave immediately.\u201cDamn it, alright. It\u2019s clear that I wouldn\u2019t be much help even if I stuck to the princess \u2026.\u201dHe nodded as if he acknowledged the limits of his abilities. I still wasn\u2019t clear on the layout of the Demon King\u2019s Castle, however I had remembered some things when I came out of the prison. There was no one to stop us, as many soldiers were going in and out of the Castle.\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201dSome people seemed puzzled about me walking around unarmed, but I couldn\u2019t explain this to each one of them.Fortunately, I was able to trace my steps back to roughly where it was.The Demon King\u2019s Castle was very spacious and the prison I was in and the magic item storage were located deep inside, so there was a very good chance that it hadn\u2019t been plundered yet.\u201cThis is ridiculously huge!\u201dEventually I got tired and ended up riding his back. I rummaged through my memory and pointed out the directions I remembered. Fortunately, we were able to reach it without getting lost.\u201cIt\u2019s still fine!\u201dFortunately, it was still in good condition. It looked like no one had come here yet.\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t look that fine to me though. I think someone was here already, you know?\u201dOh.That was me.\u201cAh, tha, that\u2026\u2026 I, I meant that the scrolls were still looking fine!\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s look for it.\u201dI immediately picked up the teleport scroll that was spread out on the floor.\u201cI found it!\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cYes, look.\u201dThe name of the magic contained in the scroll was written on it in common language, so he didn\u2019t ask me how I was able to find it right away. If it had been written in the Demon language, he would have suspected me for sure. I already knew two languages I had no previous knowledge of. It was like the staple cheats people get when they get sent to another world.I resealed the scroll that hadn\u2019t been triggered yet. Of course, the teleportation would only work on one person. I didn\u2019t know if there were mass teleportation scrolls, but I had to find more scrolls.Not only Charlotte, I had to get myself out of here as well and maybe Dyrus as well, as he\u2019d also be in danger.\u201cI\u2019ll need a few more. We don\u2019t know what might happen. We should also get some scrolls that might help us as well.\u201d\u201cLittle boy, take this.\u201d\u201cThi, this is\u2026?\u201d\u201cA Scroll Book, is this the first time you\u2019ve seen one? It was over there.\u201dHe handed me an empty book.\u201cN, no, that\u2019s not it. I know what this is.\u201d\u201cGood then. Let\u2019s use it.\u201dI knew what a scroll book was. It wasn\u2019t even a magic item, just a book one could put scrolls into and organize it in a way that one could rip out the pages one needed whenever one wanted.It was an object used by people who weren\u2019t wizards, but still needed to use magic in battle. Since it was an item I came up with, there was no way I wouldn\u2019t know about it. However, it felt really really strange actually holding this item I only imagined in my hands.It was good that I didn\u2019t have to crumble these scrolls into my pocket. I started filling the scroll book with useful magic spells, while Dyrus found another scroll book, filling it with magic as well.\u201cThe Demon King\u2019s Castle sure is amazing. I heard that even low-level scrolls were more expensive than my salary.\u201dHe seemed to genuinely admire the vast stock of scrolls.\u201cI heard they\u2019ve almost used up all the scrolls in this war, but if we\u2019d take all the ones here it would be more than enough to make up for the lower level scrolls we\u2019ve used.\u201dDyrus rummaged through the scrolls while saying things like that.There were no aoe attack spells, but we\u2019ve swept up all the scrolls that might be helpful to us. I couldn\u2019t take them with me earlier because I had to throw everything away, but now I could actually pack them up.Useful Scrolls GET. Go, me.Then I opened my eyes wide at a sudden discovery.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d[Mass Teleportation]Multi-person space movement order.There was no more need to find more teleportation scrolls.\u201cLet\u2019s go Lieutenant!\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201dThen, as soon as we stepped out the door, we couldn\u2019t help but stiffen.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dOur eyes met with a soldier who was carrying some bundles.No, if you think about it, wouldn\u2019t we be seen as people who just arbitrarily took the spoils that should belong to the military? It was, of course, a felony to snatch loot without permission.What if they won\u2019t let us go?Dyrus, I and the soldier were looking at each other in silence.He clenched his teeth. Perhaps he was prepared for this extreme situation.In the face of his new mission to protect the princess, he seemed prepared to do anything. Even if it meant having to subdue his own allies right on the spot.\u201cThat. Lieutenant.\u201dThe soldier cautiously opened his mouth after checking Dyrus rank.\u201cHow about we\u2019ll just turn a blind eye on each other?\u201d\u2026..\u2026 You too?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7I would\u2019ve never imagined that my life would one day be intertwined with a child who wasn\u2019t even a major character of my novel.But I also didn\u2019t expect to see soldiers looting in the Demon World War I described in it. There was no need or reason for me to imagine such things as I wrote the novel.Normally, things like these weren\u2019t woven into the main story in novels such as this, right? This wasn\u2019t related to the main story at all, but this world was on a much larger scale than just the main story, right?While the main character was waiting to enter the Gardias Temple letting his imagination flow, in the prologue section before the main story even started, a princess was about to be assassinated and the Demon Prince was fighting tooth and nail to save her. That was happening right now.This world I described, with all it\u2019s blank spaces filled in, was more realistic than I imagined. That made this whole thing even more scary.Dyrus didn\u2019t stop walking, while he did seem disappointed and angry at being treated the same as those mongrels who acted out of personal greed.While I was rushing to get out of the Demon King\u2019s Castle, Dyrus suddenly grabbed my arm.\u201c!\u201dDyrus suddenly slipped into the hallway next to him, not the way we were going to go, and hid me behind a Gargoyle statue in the hallway. Dyrus\u2019 expression was serious.\u201cThe Knights of Duke Salerian.\u201dI knew what he meant, so I immediately held my breath.Duke Salerian.Bertus\u2019 maternal family and the reason he could have so many followers. If Charlotte had judged Sir Francis to not necessarily be an enemy, Duke Salerian would absolutely be the princess\u2019 enemy. The overarching goal of Duke Salerian was to make Bertus emperor.It was very likely that Sir Francis was killed by them.Dyrus held his breath and tensed up. I didn\u2019t know what kind of status Dyrus had, but he said he was a Lieutenant.In addition, the Knights of Duke Salerian, one of the most powerful noble families in the Empire, would have prestige not comparable to any other noble. Although I\u2019m not really sure, they must be high-ranking knights far more superior compared to normal knights.Not to mention their skills.-Clang, clang, clangThere were a large number of them.\u2013 Are you sure they entered the Castle and haven\u2019t come out?-Yes, I am.\u2013 Can\u2019t say if that\u2019s a good or bad thing\u2026.\u2013 What should we do if we find him?-Do I have to tell you?\u2013 Are we going to do that officer in, too?\u2013 It must have been his fate to end in such an unlucky way.They didn\u2019t mention a concrete person in their conversation, but it was clear who they were looking for.They were looking for me and Dyrus. Dyrus was holding his breath while clenching his teeth.They have to pass by. They can\u2019t notice us.Then.I realized how foolish it was to think that we could fool the senses of high-ranking knights.\u201cI think they\u2019re over there.\u201dOne of the knights said calmly, as if they were in no rush to find us.\u201cThey\u2019re breathing pretty harshly. Looks like they\u2019re nervous. Hey, it\u2019s hard not to notice that.\u201dA series of nearby knights arrived there after hearing the call.There were four knights in total. Dyrus and I stepped out from behind the statue and slowly backed away.Four knights in splendid plate armor came into view and were looking at Dyrus.The knight, wearing a relaxed expression, clicked his tongue slightly. Then the one who seemed the most senior opened his mouth.\u201cThe princess really is a pitiful girl.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the only one, but he keeps making me kill the hardliners \u201dThe knight sighed that he\u2019d have to kill 1 to 10 people. I didn\u2019t even feel like contradicting him.\u201cShame on you. For the Knights of the Empire, laying hands on the imperial family!\u201dDyrus shouted.\u201cIf you thought the whining of some kid I don\u2019t even know the name of would put even a small scratch on my honor\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I don\u2019t really care.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to care at all about the accusations he heard from people who weren\u2019t worth his time.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a pleasant thing. I admit that.\u201dHe smiled bitterly to himself.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that I have to end the day drenched in the blood of demons by spilling human blood.\u201dIt seemed quite unpleasant for him to have to do such a thing. Just because the princess didn\u2019t die, he had to do something like this.Apart from that displeasure, however, there was no hesitation in his actions.-Sching!When that knight drew his sword, all the other knights did the same. We could run back, but we\u2019d surely get caught sooner or later. Their physical abilities should completely transcend not only mine, but even Dyrus\u2019.A Scroll.Could we break through this situation with any of them?However, while I was leafing through the scroll book to choose a magic spell, they would just run up to me and slice my head off before I could even take a single breath.I was finally able to escape the Demon King\u2019s Castle, but did I just come back here to die like this?The thought of dying just like a dog in such an absurd situation made me feel feverish.I had to die again less than a day after I first died. The knights began to slowly approach us, as my breath tightened. Despite being in a huge corridor, the three knights\u2019 presence was enough to fill it.Of course, that was just a figure of speech, they weren\u2019t really filling the corridor, it just felt that way. The presence of those approaching knights\u2019 couldn\u2019t even be compared to that gigantic gargoyle statue Dyrus and I had been hiding behind just a moment ago\u2026.Wait a moment.Gargoyle?I stared blankly at the gargoyle statue.That.Don\u2019t these things usually move in places like this?Though that was a terrifying thought.-Whoosh!-Boom!The Gargoyle\u2019s giant halberd hit the knights approaching us from the front.Explosions.Astonishment.Death.\u201cRun!\u201dAnd judgment.Now was not the time to think.* * *The huge Gargoyle\u2019s merciless surprise completely crushed the knights who were approaching us with raging force. I clearly saw those high-ranking knights were literally shredded to bits even with their armor on. They didn\u2019t even get the chance to scream.They may be strong but this was the Demon King\u2019s Castle.It was the place that held the strongest forces of the Demon World.It wasn\u2019t hard to understand that the gargoyle was a powerful monster compared to high-ranking knights who were monsters among humans.I couldn\u2019t even feel nauseous. I avoided the bodies before I could even think about it.-Thud! Boom! Thud!We were able to escape while the knights pursuing us were responding to the suddenly activated gargoyle.\u201cW, why is it suddenly moving?\u201d\u201cI, I have no idea!\u201dNo, I did know.Obviously, all my physical abilities were close to 0, but I did have the ability to dominate demons. Perhaps my thoughts activated the gargoyle, or it sensed the knights\u2019 killing intent and acted on its own.Anyway, it clearly moved to protect me.I was born with the power to control demons.However, I couldn\u2019t tell him that, so running away was our top priority. No matter how many knights there were, they wouldn\u2019t have the ability to withstand the attacks of such a colossal monster.The castle, which was in the middle of getting searched, was thrown into chaos by the sudden explosions. Dyrus and I used that chance to quickly escape the Demon King\u2019s Castle.\u201cThere\u2019ll definitely be others following us.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Knights of Duke Salerian were scattered and searched for us. Although there was a skirmish happening, they\u2019d definitely pursue us if they knew we escaped. Dyrus put me on his horse and we rode straight out of the castle.We earned some curious glances as we rushed out, but this wasn\u2019t the time to be concerned about that.-Doo, doo, doo, doo!As soon as we arrived at the garrison, we had to teleport the hell out of here with Charlotte. I almost lost my mind while riding on that horse. It was hard just holding on to it.\u201cShit! They\u2019ve already caught up to us!\u201dTheir command system was in such perfect order, that the Knights of Duke Salerian caught up to us in no time. Despite there being so many eyes around, they wanted to catch us, even while risking there being rumors.That must have meant that even if they killed me and Dyrus right here, they\u2019d be able to take care of the aftermath themselves.It was impossible for them to kill the princess on the main road, but if it was just us they could do so easily. They\u2019d just make up some reason for that later.\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe horses the knights were riding on were far superior to Dyrus\u2019 steed. Even though they rode them while wearing armor they were still that fast.Despite being so far away from us at first, they were getting closer to us.The rapidly increasing number of pursuers was now over 10. The soldiers driving the loot wagons and the ones taking away the prisoners of war stared at this sudden chase blankly.\u201cLieutenant! Hold my waist tightly and secure me!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDyrus grabbed my waist and kept me from falling without asking what I was planning on doing. I opened the scroll book hanging from my waist, then I quickly looked for any magic spell that might help us in our current situation.Anything.Isn\u2019t there anything that we can use?[Haste]I opened the scroll and cast Haste on the horse.\u2013 Doo, doo, doo, doo!In an instant, the horse\u2019s movements became faster. White foam began to form around the horse\u2019s mouth.\u201cDamn it! It\u2019s good that it got faster, but this might kill the horse before we even arrive!\u201dHaste made one\u2019s movements faster, but it also made the target drain it\u2019s stamina rapidly. A horse wasn\u2019t an animal that could sprint for a long time in the first place. In addition to that, I applied acceleration magic, which insanely amplified its metabolism. This was like burning away the horse\u2019s life.It was going to be like that soon anyway.\u201cI\u2019d rather die after three minutes instead of one!\u201d\u201cWhat a nut job!\u201dEven in this situation, he had time to burst out into laughter as he was just that speechless. Dyrus rode like crazy. Despite it being a lot more difficult riding this faster horse, he kept on holding onto me and controlling his horse with one hand.\u201cShit\u2026!\u201dDyrus looked behind and cussed.\u201cThey\u2019re going to shoot arrows!\u201dThe knights weren\u2019t even using swords. They were just firing arrows at us because they couldn\u2019t catch up to us. Fortunately, Dyrus was able to dodge the arrows in an almost acrobatic way, which deflected the arrows.\u201cThe horse seems to get more and more exhausted!\u201dThe condition of their horses and our horse was so different. I mean, as I was in a hurry back then, Dyrus made his horse sprint to the Demon King\u2019s Castle a while ago as well.He made this already exhausted horse sprint and on top of that I cast Haste on it, so it was natural that it\u2019s stamina soon reached its end.I looked through the scroll book to see if there were any spells that could replenish the horse\u2019s stamina, but there wasn\u2019t any magic spell like that. There were only auxiliary type magic spells like Illusion, Fascination and Delusion inside.\u201cDo you think they\u2019d be affected by Fascination spells?!\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t! Knights are required to undergo anti-magic training!\u201dThey were all equipped with anti-magic measures. Low-level auxiliary magic won\u2019t work on them, is what Dyrus told me flat out. Yeah, I kind of expected that it wouldn\u2019t work. It would be a bit ridiculous for melee experts to just die after getting peppered with magic, so they set up some training sessions on how to counter magic.I knew that, because I put the subject \u201cAnti-magic Training\u201d into the academy\u2019s curriculum. Anyway, my set-up was pulling my legs right now.Nevertheless, I had to use a scroll.It was a risky gamble.I used Illusion.\u201cI told you it won\u2019t work!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not aiming for the knights!\u201dI opened the scroll to use its magic spell.The targets weren\u2019t the knights.If you would shoot a general, shoot his horse first.I intended to carry out that old idiom.[Illusion]The spell activated.-Neeeeeeigh!-Clatter!Then, the sounds of Knights falling to the ground and horses neighing could be heard from behind us.Fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like the horses were trained to resist magic.If magic didn\u2019t work on the knights, I\u2019d just cast the spell on their horses. I just showed the horses an illusion of a dragon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8\u201cYou\u2026! Great!\u201dI pulled out the Fascination scroll this time.The type of the spell didn\u2019t even matter. Anyway, any spell that could affect their horses would do. There was no other reason why I was taking on this risky gamble.Just as I was casting spells on their horses, they might cast some on our horse.However, Dyrus said clearly that the Coalition used up almost all their scrolls in this war.And none of them were magicians.I thought that even if they had a scroll book, they wouldn\u2019t have any more spells in them and it turned out to be the truth. The war was over and they couldn\u2019t get replacements for the scrolls they used and they obviously didn\u2019t have any more in stock.Most of them probably had attack spells in their scroll books that would have an intuitive immediate effect and they probably used up all of them. I started this gamble believing that.\u2013 Neeeeeeigh!-Bang!My guess was right.The horses toppled over after being affected by the low-level magic, causing the knights riding on them to come rolling down to the ground. Those that didn\u2019t manage to land properly were highly likely to die by breaking their necks.Some may have died.I didn\u2019t actively think about the fact that I might have killed them, as they were trying to kill me.Guilt, remorse or justifications for my actions didn\u2019t even occur to me at that point.I had to do everything I could. I had no other thoughts but that. The situation was so urgent that all my judgement seemed to have focused on only this single point.All concerns regarding ethics and values were put off until later. Not consciously, but unconsciously.\u201cShit!\u201dHowever, I didn\u2019t have any more mental magic I could use to knock them all downThere were two pursuers still chasing after us with rage filling their eyes.The horse we rode was already far over its limits. It was now slower than it was before I placed Haste on it.\u201cThey\u2019ll catch up to us.\u201dDyrus shouted in a desperate voice. The horse was exhausted and there were two knights, who witnessed their comrades fall down, still chasing after us from afar with killing intent so sharp pointed at us that it really felt like I was getting cut.The horse now started to just trudge, while the knights\u2019 horses followed us at a frightening speed. Dyrus clenched his teeth and pulled out his sword, however it didn\u2019t seem like he thought he could win.Was this the end?And then, I saw a long line of wagons and soldiers watching this chase.And.There was also the procession of those demon prisoners that seemed to go on forever.And I saw the eyes of those demons looking at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFrom Goblins to Trolls and unarmed Ogres, Orcs and countless other unknown types of demons.All these demons were watching this commotion.They were looking at me.Not even a single word was exchanged between us.I didn\u2019t say anything to them.They just looked at me without saying a word.They were demons of the Demon Realm who surrendered after losing their fighting spirit, knowing that their king died.As demons and monsters, they had to pay the price of defeat with their lives. Since no one would pay their ransom, the only thing they could pay with was their lives.They were looking at me.Because the Demon King was dead.And I was sure to be the last one.Seeing how I was betraying them.I didn\u2019t know how they were able to recognize me, but I felt like they knew who I was or were they able to read my feelings just by looking at me in this desperate situation?Or did the power sleeping inside of me \u2018Demon domination\u2019 activate because of this situation?The process and outcome were unknown to me.However, after giving up everything, they looked at me with eyes that seemed to have found their last hope.-Crank!An ogre broke his shackles that bound him and began charging at the knights rushing towards me.-Kuooooooooooooh!With a roar that seemed to shake the heavens and earth, the demons, who were tied up and quietly let themselves get dragged away before, immediately began to resist.\u201cCr, cra, crazy!\u201dIn the end, the two knights who were following us were attacked by the ogre rushing at them.Once again everything got chaotic as the prisoners of war began to riot.This was the last resistance of the remaining demons in order to save their last king.* * *They didn\u2019t use ropes to tie the demons. It was impossible for others to break them except if they were large monsters like an ogre. Most of the demons were just struggling to make a commotion.Therefore, the prisoners began to be subdued and that suppression ultimately just turned out to be bloody slaughter. The only thing that changed was that they got killed here by the troops and not on the execution grounds.Because of the disturbance caused by the demons and the suppression of the last pursuers no one was chasing after us anymore.Dyrus seemed to find this absurd situation hard to accept.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026.\u201dThe gargoyle activated to kill some knights just at the right time and just when we were in a desperate situation the demons decided to riot and attack the knights.Dyrus knew that this was abnormal. He just couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on exactly. However their main goal of escaping with Charlotte was yet unfulfilled.Dyrus seemed to hold back his doubts. He remained silent until we drew near to the garrison.The atmosphere at the garrison was definitely exhilarating.-Is Her Royal Highness really still alive?-Yeah, she just came out and shook hands with the soldiers telling them that she was alright.-She just went back to the barracks to get some rest\u2026.\u2013 What a relief, what a relief.\u2013 That dog-like Demon King died and the princess was still alive. How blessed can we be?-Hey man, the Empress died though, so to call it a blessing is\u2026\u2026-That\u2019s true, I hope that Her Highness will soon get back on her feet\u2026.As Charlotte expected, the news that the princess was still alive had already spread throughout the garrison. It seemed like they hadn\u2019t gotten the report about the rioting prisoners of war yet.There were more eyes and ears here.But it was too early to feel reassured. The Knights of Duke Salerian tried to kill Dyrus and me, despite the presence of all those wagons and convoys. It was just the princess who was difficult to touch.Even if news arrived that Dyrus and I killed their knights, there would be nothing about them trying to kill us, so no one would care.They would have so many reasons ready why they had to immediately execute us.Soon, news of what happened close to the Demon King\u2019s Castle would reach this place. Before that happened, we had to get out of here.Fortunately, the soldiers\u2019 eyes were fixed on the HQ barracks where the princess was said to rest.They seemed to wonder if they\u2019d ever be able to see the princess\u2019 face, who was said to be still alive. However, because of that, the barracks were completely encircled. We had no way to sneak in.There was no way around it.Dyrus and I strode straight towards the barracks.The guard looked at me and shook his head before I could even say anything.\u201cHer Highness is resting. Go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve brought the goods Her Royal Highness asked for.\u201dIt seemed like nothing would make this guardsman budge.\u201cThere was an order from the Commander-in-chief that she needed absolute rest. Come back later.\u201dThe moment we\u2019ll try to go back, you\u2019d just try to kill us secretly.Even if that didn\u2019t happen, it would be over as soon as the news from the Demon King\u2019s Castle arrived here.We had to get in there somehow.\u201cIt\u2019s urgent.\u201dAt those words, the guard\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cEven if you were rescued together with the Imperial Princess, we can\u2019t let someone with an unclear identity like you be by her side. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re having some ideas?\u201dYou guys are more dangerous to her, though?That guard would certainly rather die than let me in. He was staring at me and pointing the end of his spear at me as if telling me that he\u2019d be forced to use violence if we tried to force our way in.I had no idea what Charlotte\u2019s condition was inside, but it seemed like she wasn\u2019t able to come out to me, even if she knew that we arrived.They wouldn\u2019t know what I was trying to do.However, knowing that I had received some instructions from the princess, they tried to prevent me from meeting her subtly.The problem was that I neither had the strength nor justification to break through their vague actions.\u201cBoy.\u201dAt that moment, Dyrus called out to me.\u201cLieutenant.\u201dHe took a deep breath, sighing as if he had no other choice.\u201cIt\u2019s plan B.\u201d-Sigh!\u201cKuek!\u201dAs if it was a sign, he drew his sword and stuck it right in the neck of the guard, before his opponent could do anything.\u201cYou crazy!\u201dThe other guards just spat out swear words, completely in shock that their comrade was suddenly stabbed like this.\u201cGo!\u201dWhile Dyrus cut one attacking guard after the other, I just stopped thinking and ran into the barracks.As I broke through several layers of tents, I could see Charlotte, who quietly sat in her seat inside and countless other people standing around her, not touching her, but they seemed to monitor her.\u201c!\u201dCharlotte looked at me, opening her eyes so wide her eyelids seemed to be about to rip apart.An old man wearing a white priest\u2019s robe shouted in a brusque tone.\u201cI believe I made it clear that you were not to let anyone in\u2026\u2026 !\u201dThere was no time for conversations.[Flash]\u201cKuerk!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s using magic!\u201d\u2013 Flash!In an instant a flash of light exploded inside the tent. While everyone was blinded by the light, I unblocked my eyes and grabbed Charlotte\u2019s hand, who was also affected by the sudden flash.Charlotte was equally perplexed as the others. Charlotte told me to get Sir Francis and not to break in here and shoot out a flare.[Mass teleport][Please specify destination.]I cast mass teleportation.\u201cTo Gardium!\u201dOur destination was the Imperial Capital.We\u2019re going to Imperial Capital Gardium![You have passed the Prologue sequence.][Special Achievement \u2013 Inflection Point of History][A key figure (Charlotte de Gardias) who should not have appeared in the original story line has survived.][The future has changed dramatically.][Acquired 1000 Achievement Points.]I was finally done with that hellish prologue.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9This was called teleportation.It was really unbelievable, experiencing this first-hand.As the flash of light subsided, the scenery was completely different. Unlike the Demon Realm, which was covered by a gray sky, a blue sky and a bustling city spread out before my eyes.The very place where the main story of my novel [The Demon King is Dead] unfolded.The Imperial Capital Gardium.It gave me a strange feeling seeing the place I had only described with words before\u2026Like shit.Where are we?I don\u2019t know this place.No, well, to be fair, I didn\u2019t describe every single corner of the Capital. I mean, if I did I would have been cussed out for making the chapters longer by adding useless descriptions.Perhaps we were in a plaza somewhere in the in the capital. People were looking at me and the princess who suddenly appeared out of nowhere through teleportation with puzzled expressions. Teleportation was a super high-level spell, so it was definitely not commonly seen.So, in the end, I arrived in the Capital Gardium, a city I wrote about, but had no clue about.\u201cHaah\u2026. Wha, what happened? Thi, this is\u2026The Capital?\u201dAnd next to me, Princess Charlotte de Gardias, who had teleported with me, held a puzzled expression on her face as well.I was supposed to bring her an escort, but I ended up kidnapping her using teleportation magic, so it was natural that she was surprised.\u201cSir Francis has already been killed. So I went back into the Demon King\u2019s Castle to find some teleportation scrolls. I thought that the Imperial Capital would be the safest place for the princess.\u201dAfter hearing my explanation, the princess widened her eyes. She was shocked to hear that Sir Francis had already been killed and seemed surprised that I was able to come up with an alternative method so quickly and saved her from a situation like that.Yeah, it\u2019s not like a normal 17-year-old would have that wit.But even considering my original age, this was hard to come by!I almost died again a few timesLater.\u201cYes, well done\u2026. You did a really, really good job.\u201dCharlotte plopped down on a nearby bench, apparently because she felt relieved.She had almost breathed her last.It was pretty scary thinking like that.\u2013 Flash!Dyrus arrived in front of me with a flash of light.\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201dDyrus, who seemed to have been escaping from a rather desperate situation, arrived in front of us while breathing heavily.\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Lieutenant!\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. A little later and they would have blown away an arm or a leg.\u201dDyrus took a deep breath and fell straight to his knees. Not before me, but before Charlotte.\u201cLieutenant Dyrus, commander of the 3rd Platoon, 11th Company, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Imperial Corps. I give my sincerest greetings, Your Imperial Highness the First Princess.\u201dCharlotte didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on.* * *We had two teleportation scrolls.Plan A was rather simple. Just approach the princess and use the Mass Teleport Scroll if the guards let us through the entrance.Plan B was for Dyrus to open up a path for me and take the aggro off of me. Dyrus would escape with a single person Teleport Scroll, while I brought away the princess using the Mass Teleportation Scroll.Dyrus had confirmed that we got away and escaped himself.Of course, Charlotte was astonished seeing a stranger appear out of the blue, so I explained the whole story first. I explained that if it weren\u2019t for Lieutenant Dyrus, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to perform my mission properly.Charlotte nodded her head, still wearing a puzzled expression.\u201cThank you. Lieutenant Dyrus.\u201dCharlotte expressed her gratitude, saying that he greatly helped her.\u201cAs a soldier of the Imperial Family, I shall always put the safety of the Imperial Family first.\u201dDyrus had made a difficult decision. No matter how much a soldier should say these words, putting them actually into practice was a completely different matter. He risked his life throwing himself into the forces who were trying to kill the princess as if it was natural. He had no hesitation or thoughts that he might die.I just did what I did because my life was intertwined with hers, but this dude was the real deal.Charlotte nodded as if she thought so as well.\u201cWouldn\u2019t our enemies be able to come after us using teleportation magic?\u201dThat was our most pressing concern now. There definitely were wizards among our enemies, and I pretty much shouted out that we were teleporting to Gardium. They obviously knew where we were.Dyrus\u2019 expression hardened at my words.\u201cWe must move quickly.\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have to.\u201dCharlotte, however, was calm.\u201cThere should be no wizards among the Coalition Forces who could successfully teleport from the Demon Realm to Gardium. We have moved an unbelievably far distance. This was originally impossible. Obviously, there were no Warp Gates near the Demon King\u2019s Castle either, so no one would be able to pursue us.\u201dInforming us that the Demon\u2019s Scrolls had unbelievably great performances, Charlotte denied the possibility of pursuers coming after us using teleportation.\u201cHowever, They can report this matter using communication magic. Well, it will take a while, so that should be enough for us to reach the Imperial Palace.\u201dCommunication magic wasn\u2019t instantaneous. There would be delays. To be exact, the distance between these two locations was so great that there would be just as great a delay\u00a0 until the magic spell reached the right person.First he heard that the princess was alive, so he gave orders to kill her, this time it had to be reported that the princess had already teleported to Gardium.\u201cCould you explain what happened, Lieutenant Dyrus?\u201d\u201cYes, I shall explain.\u201dSo we didn\u2019t have that much time to spare, but we still took the time to explain what happened to the princess as we walked down the streets of the Capital. When we reached the part about me nearly dying to the Knights of the Duke, the princess seemed sorry while looking at me. I did this to survive, so she didn\u2019t have to feel sorry for me.Of course, I could have used the teleport scroll as soon as I left the Demon King\u2019s Castle if I just wanted to live, but that\u2019s not how I wanted it to be.I don\u2019t know why, but I couldn\u2019t just leave Charlotte behind even when my life was at stake. I knew one didn\u2019t need a reason to save someone, but this was the first time I risked my life for another. I could only say that it was something wholly unfamiliar to me.Anyway, all\u2019s well that ends well. But I\u2019m pretty goddamn sure that I wouldn\u2019t be able to pull something like this off more than once.Anywho, while Dyrus was recounting the incident, I felt a chill running down my spine..Looking back at the story, there were just too many unnatural parts.A Gargoyle suddenly activated and blocked the knights.The demons suddenly rioted and for some reason the captured demons acted as if they were trying to protect us.The first one could be chalked up as a coincidence, but the second situation was just too suspicious. It was just too convenient.Dyrus just seemed to feel lucky to be alive, but I was watching the princess\u2019 expression harden.She was Charlotte, who had lived in the Imperial Castle, that could be said to be the main stage for political battles. She\u2019s been through some things, but she was extraordinarily smart. As soon as she was released from a situation where she was pushed to her limits both physically and mentally, she immediately foresaw her own death.Those strange incidents.A boy who lost his memory.A teleport scroll I found as if I knew exactly where it was.There were ample of reasons to be suspicious of me. I didn\u2019t know what conclusion they\u2019d draw from this, but as far as I could see it wouldn\u2019t be a good one for me.It was clear what conclusion the princess would reach. I didn\u2019t know what choice she\u2019d make, but I couldn\u2019t wait for her to decide on one.I slowed down a bit and walked behind them. Fortunately, Dyrus was close to the princess and was prepared for any unexpected events.That\u2019s good.It would be good if the princess owed me, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay close to her as I\u2019d risk my identity being discovered someday.It was a relationship that couldn\u2019t have lasted long anyway.This was the only time I could pull out.I walked slowly and silently, then I quickly entered an alleyway I passed by.Even if she was willing to give me a thousand gold, I could no longer be associated with the princess.The princess would be safe, but I, on the other hand, had entered another tiger\u2019s den.It was impossible for me to go to a place full of powerful and aristocratic people with my camouflage magic, that could get dissolved just by using weak dispel magic.How come I\u2019ve only ever been able to make short-term goals ever since I entered this world?And why did I alway have to risk my life to reach these short-term goals?Passing the alleyway, I hid so that the princess and Dyrus couldn\u2019t find me.They wouldn\u2019t be looking for me now. Going back to the Imperial Palace held priority.I first left that collapsing cave called the Demon King\u2019s Castle only to end up in the tiger\u2019s den, the garrison of the Coalition Forces, but that was just a stepping stone to enter the dragon\u2019s lair called the Imperial Palace.After walking around for a while, I finally stopped at a quiet spot and sat down on a bench.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dLeaving everything aside, I had to take a rest.\u201cFuck\u2026.\u201dUsing some common saying, my mind was exploding.It seemed that I had faced so many bloody trials, witnessed so many people getting slaughtered and I even caused some people\u2019s death with my own hands.While coming this far, my mind had already crossed its limits several times.Let\u2019s rest for now. Let\u2019s take a break and sort out all these horrible memories somehow.And think about what to do next.* * *This was the first time I could take a break after having met so many desperate situations and being driven into a corner so many times in this unfamiliar world. I felt a subtle sense of relief that I wasn\u2019t forced to go anywhere.I was currently somewhere in the Imperial Capital.As I saw it, the Imperial Capital was somewhat similar to Seoul in Korea. It went without saying that it was an incredibly large city, the largest on the entire continent. In this day and age, a city of that size wasn\u2019t all that common.I was now sitting on a bench on a promenade of some sort, it wasn\u2019t too deserted or too crowded. The Imperial Capital was already a bustling and flourishing city, but the Empire will prosper even more with the victory of the Demon World War.In any case, if I want to survive, I can\u2019t force myself to think about certain things.While trying to put my splintered heart back together, I somehow had to suppress these terrible memories and rationalize my guilt.From this point on I had to think about what I had to and was able to do.I had a few problems.I didn\u2019t have any money.I had no place to live or food to eat. It was even more nonsensical to go back to the princess for that.Working and somehow making money would also be rather difficult. What if my camouflage magic suddenly wore off while I was washing dishes in some restaurant? They also wouldn\u2019t give me any advanced payment and I had an unclear identity.I was now slowly realizing in real time why vagrants fell into crime.Except through criminal ways, I had no other way to make ends meet. Couldn\u2019t I somehow get into some sort of public childcare facility or something? Did places like this even exist here? No matter how crazy one was about creating settings, who\u2019d be so crazy as to set up a public childcare system in their novel\u2026\u2026?Oh.Now that I think of it.I indeed did such a crazy thing.A project to manage the large numbers of orphans caused by the casualties of the Demon World War would be carried out as a post-war measure.I knew this because there were some children from said public childcare facilities in Temple, the main stage of my school drama. I wrote that there were quite a few children of people who were killed in the Demon World War in Temple, among them were also major characters.However, the news of the victory against the demons had just been delivered. Such a large-scale policy wouldn\u2019t have been implemented so quickly.That was highly unlikely.I could try to go to some place similar to an orphanage and ask them to take me in, but regardless of whether they accepted me or not, this was still the Imperial Capital.Even if she didn\u2019t do so right now, there was a high possibility that the princess would try to find me.Whether she wanted to reward me or take action to find out who I was, it was very likely that the princess would try to find me for some kind of reason.And she should be able to infer that I\u2019d eventually go to some public childcare facility. She was smart after all.So, if I went to an orphanage, I\u2019d be able to survive for some days, but I\u2019d alway feel anxious about the princess coming to find me one day.She might not be able to find me if I went to a different city, but I didn\u2019t have the money to travel around. I didn\u2019t have much confidence about surviving in the wilderness either.And although I was a demon, seeing as I was carrying around biscuits, I was sure that I had to eat.Actually, I was hungry right now. I should have put in some convenient setting like \u201cDemons could survive solely through mana\u2019 or something![Used the function \u2018Add Settings\u2019.]\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d[A total of 100000 achievement points are required to add the setting \u2018Race Arcdemon can supplement nutrition by consuming magical power\u2019.]A message suddenly appeared in front of my eyes.\u2026What\u2019s with this?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: 10Then it occured to me that I should probably think more about these occasional message windows appearing in front of me. I never mentioned those in my novel.I wasn\u2019t all that sure about this subject, but what I had to think about the most right now were probably these achievement points.So, the way I understood it was, that the novel I wrote now suddenly had a game system implanted in it, making it some strange chimera..Who the hell would read this shit? Even though I prayed so much on every holiday for some kind of cheat, this just wasn\u2019t right.Anyway, I might have been given some type of cheat skill. Even if this turned into some dog-shit novel, if I could live a comfortable life I\u2019d prefer that over anything else.I kind of understood now why the \u2018isekai\u2019 genre got so popular. I\u2019d have been living comfortably if I had just written more novels of that genre.No, I wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been reincarnated as the main character, so I might have ended up in an even more unfortunate situation. Maybe as just a normal high schooler or something. Moreover, I would have to watch some nerdy high school kid, who was also heir to his family\u2019s\u00a0 secret art of swordsmanship, holding a japanese sword, talking up a big game, wouldn\u2019t I? Aah, if I had to follow that kind of brain dead main character I might die of high blood pressure again.Anyway.I really hope I can become some godsend cheater in this dog-shit I wrote.Hoping that I was the owner of such a cheat, I tried to look through the system. Just by thinking about it, a message appeared before my eyes.[Congratulations, you have been granted the power to interfere with the world of \u2018The Demon King is Dead\u2019, your undisputed masterpiece, which was rated as \u2018Neither this nor that and a typographical crime\u2019 by the office of Atonement, Judgement and Evaluation]Why are you insulting me all of a sudden?I\u2019ve been calling this novel dog shit all this time, but hearing those things from someone else made me feel kind of depressed.[You will have to go through events from time to time. There are various types, from minor to major events. Most of the rewards will be in the form of achievement points.]I couldn\u2019t find anything as convenient as a settings window. I didn\u2019t need something like volume control, but couldn\u2019t you at least give me some kind of interface?It didn\u2019t seem like there was anything like that.[You can change the main story by preventing things that should happen or making things happen that shouldn\u2019t. In case you do such things you might get more achievement points than for normal events.][Additionally, you can also earn some through \u2018Challenges\u2019. If you succeed in overcoming a challenge, you will get achievement points.]What did they mean with Challenges?[Challenges are challenges. If you would like to take on a challenge, please check the \u2018List of currently available Challenges\u2019. The entries are updated periodically. Some challenges may not appear again.]When I checked the Challenge list, I immediately understood what they were.[Slap the Emperor across the face (Full swing only) \u2013 10000 Points][Get imprisoned in the Gardium Prison \u2013 1200 Points][Escape from the prison after getting imprisoned \u2013 2000 Points][Pickpocket a Knight without getting caught \u2013 100 points][Buy an over 1067 m\u00b2 house with money earned from begging \u2013 1000 Points]...Somehow, I felt like there were no normal options on the listSlap the Emperor? You want me to exchange my life for achievement points? I think it\u2019s impossible for me to get an audience with the Emperor in the first place, you know?What\u2019s with this feature that made one feel like crap by just looking at it?So what else was there? I need to know these things first.[As a reward for clearing the Prologue, the privilege of using achievement points has been given.][Achievement points are used for \u2018Revising\u2019 functions such as changing certain settings of this world, forcibly granting you certain talents, making events happen that shouldn\u2019t or prevent events from happening that should. Furthermore, the function \u2018Preview\u2019 can be used limitedly, to check the changes your actions have caused. However, interfering with big events or main characters is impossible or requires a fairly large amount of achievement points.][Be careful not to cause a \u2018Setting Collapse\u2019. If you are not able to recognize the collapse of the setting and try to add new settings or try to \u2018revise\u2019 the event, you will be penalized. If your memory is bad enough to cause a setting collapse in your own novel, I recommend you to add the setting \u2018A cure for Alzheimer\u2019s exists in this world.\u2019]It didn\u2019t seem that serious in the beginning, but are you trying to pick a fight with me? Am I imagining things ?[Keep in mind, you cannot remove settings that have been added or already exist.][For example if the setting \u2018The Dragon can\u2019t be killed\u2019 was already in place you won\u2019t be able to add the setting \u2018The Dragon can be killed\u2019.][Of course, while you were alive you used to paste additional settings to your already existing one\u2019s later on, regretting the choices you made like an idiot, like \u2018Actually, the Dragon couldn\u2019t be killed normally, but it was possible using the Dragon Slayer OO\u2019. Frivolous behavior such as adding \u2018additional settings\u2019 Like \u201cIt\u2019s XX but it was actually OO\u2019 will require more achievement points or will not be tolerated.]I definitely did not imagine things, it was the truth. You were really picking a fight with me.What\u2019s with this? It wasn\u2019t just here to help me. This felt like I was reading malicious comments written by someone who absolutely hated me. Why were these descriptions charged with emotions?There was clearly some malicious intent behind these mysterious messages. Just looking at the mention of what I did when I was still alive, made it obvious. And just hearing about the additional settings made me feel like shit.That seriously broke my heart. I\u2019m not joking. I\u2019m 100% serious.People tend to feel bad if they are faced with the uncomfortable truth. That was a fact.Just who was writing this? Was it in real time?Then a sudden thought went through my mind. Was everything that happened here actually\u00a0 broadcasted to the outside?\u2018Come, watch some asshole newbie writer get punished.\u2019. Maybe it was titled like this?No, well, I wasn\u2019t that bad, you know\u2026. So if this was getting broadcasted, who was doing that? \u2018Cause Frick you.[Achievement point requirements are subject to change. A feature that may have cost you 100 points yesterday might cost 200 points or 50 points the next day. It might not even work anymore.]I wondered if it would respond to my thoughts, but I was a little disappointed as it didn\u2019t address any of them. Were you telling me that my thoughts weren\u2019t even worth dealing with?After that, numerous actions that could be done using Achievement Points were listed.I felt something the moment I saw that.So.It seemed like this was my cheat.It was a cheat, but an oddly uncooperative cheat.It seemed like I, as a writer who was sent into his own novel, had the ability to directly interfere with this world\u2019s common sense. I was pretty sure that was what the functions \u2018Revise\u2019 and \u2018Add Settings\u2019 were for. So my purpose was to rewrite my novel and make it a little more interesting.But.It had clearly stated earlier that it would take 100000 points to add something to race settings.Also, I was being punished, not rewarded here.Based on the developments so far, I don\u2019t think this will help me much. To begin with, the fact that I reincarnated as the Demon King\u2019s son didn\u2019t feel that random anymore. I could feel a lot of malice mixed into all of this.These functions might turn out to be important someday, but I only had 1100 achievement points.What could I do with these?[For example, take this situation: you can trigger the event \u2018The bakery owner gives you, a poor beggar, a piece of bread.\u2019 to satisfy your hunger, which wouldn\u2019t otherwise happen. Of course, if the subject is less altruistic it would require a greater amount of achievement points to trigger this event. This means that it would require a large amount of achievement points to cause something that would seriously violate the \u2018Law of Probability\u2019. You know the Law of Probability, right? the one you repeatedly screwed with? The biggest reason why you gave up on your novels after getting criticized for ruining the story and being unable to fix it, giving only ugly excuses .]What do you mean, a beggar? I\u2019ve got plenty of other opportunities! That\u2019s just too much.Reading that description, it felt like it was written by one of the victims of my bad habits.I didn\u2019t really know who they were, whether it was the will of this world or God, but they must\u2019ve really hated me.And why were there so many restrictions?So, big things, such as interfering with the main characters or causing the death of someone, who was unlikely to die, under the guise of an accident, would, of course, require an insane amount of achievement points or would be entirely impossible.No.But wouldn\u2019t I be able to do \u2018that\u2019 if I had a lot of achievement points? That.That \u2018Half die\u2019 move or something like that.Wasn\u2019t this actually one hell of a cheat?Achievement points could eventually be used to revise and add settings on a larger scale. In the end, it was a matter of scope and scale and it not deviating from those two frameworks.For example, one could understand this as being able to rewrite a novel.However, I wondered if I could break through my current situation with just 1100 achievement points. While looking through the functions that used achievement points, I discovered a peculiar one.[Function \u2013 A Writer\u2019s advice]What\u2019s this? Advice from who now?[Sometimes, you may find yourself before a crossroad or you may not know how to proceed.\u00a0 In that case, you can execute \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019 to receive advice from the writer on what to do next.][This feature is of rather low cost, but usually it\u2019s unknown what consequences said advice will lead to or what purpose it serves.][Sometimes the Writer\u2019s Advice is a trap. Following it could have bad consequences for you. It\u2019s common to receive both good and bad results simultaneously. There\u2019s rarely just a good outcome.][Advice can be divided into \u2018Clear Advice\u2019 and \u2018Vague Advice\u2019. \u2018Clear Advice\u2019 suggests certain actions, but is more likely to lead to bad results, while \u2018Vague Advice\u2019 is more likely to have only good outcomes, although it is hard to guess the intent behind it.][Wish you the best of luck.]You don\u2019t even pretend to be an explanatory text anymore.I felt my heart breaking just by reading that description.* * *There were many things I could do with my current amount of points. If I went to a grocery store with a generous owner and caused an event, I would be able to get food.However, that was just temporary. It would be great if I made a kind, wealthy family accept me as their adopted child, but I didn\u2019t know how many points that would cost. And also, how was I to find out if they were a nice family or not?Also, who is that description person? Why do they hate me so much?If one told me they were a collection of people that hated my guts, I\u2019d believe it.After examining various possibilities, in the end, the only thing I could really try right now was \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019.There was a possibility of the advice being a trap, but its price was low.[A Writer\u2019s Advice \u2013 150 Points]I was told that the achievement point cost was variable. After some time, the prices might suddenly inflate and it might end up costing more than a thousand points.It was also up to me whether I took the advice or not.I executed \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019.[Clear Advice][Vague Advice]There were two options. Clear Advice was easy to understand but was most likely a trap and Vague Advice was the complete opposite.And if one took the advice, most of the time good and bad things would occur simultaneously.I mean, it couldn\u2019t really get any worse than my current situation. Homeless and hungry.No, it could be worse. My life could be in danger.Still, to increase my odds even by a little I chose [Vague Advice].[A Writer\u2019s Vague Advice][How did so many people get kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle?]What.What\u2019s with this?This went beyond vague, and straight up had nothing to do with my situation at all.What\u2019s with that riddle all of a sudden?No, couldn\u2019t you at least tell me something like \u2018Go this way, go that way\u2019? I thought some voice would tell me what to do, but instead this riddle suddenly appeared. I was dumbfounded.Kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle.What was I supposed to do with this? Let myself get kidnapped?This obviously wasn\u2019t a trap, which I thought was good. If this were a trap, they would have made it a lot more clear, otherwise I\u2019d doubt their intelligence.\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dAs I sighed deeply while looking at the ground, a guy passing by looked at me strangely.Do you even know how I feel?If I knew how these people got kidnapped, would my situation be any better? They were just kidnapped. I didn\u2019t know how vague that advice was supposed to be, but this was hella cryptic.I\u2019d rather it gave me some solid advice.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dOh, rightCouldn\u2019t I try it one more time?[A Writer\u2019s Advice \u2013 150 Points]I wasn\u2019t told that I couldn\u2019t use it repeatedly.No, wait, why is it like this?Back when I was alive, I really hated these types of gacha games, so I didn\u2019t even try to play any of these, so why did I have to do something like this after coming to another world.It\u2019s not like I poured a thousand won into buying some gacha crystals or something. However, I did have to put my life on the line to get these points, so I couldn\u2019t help but cry bitter tears.I chose Clear Advice this time.[A Writer\u2019s Clear Advice][Go to the Magic Tool Shop]Yes.That\u2019s the type of advice I was looking for.Who\u2019d have known.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Go to the Magic Tool Shop.It was an intuitive and clear message and I could immediately understand what this advice was about.One of the biggest problems I was facing was:Money.When I saw the word Magic Tool Shop, I couldn\u2019t help but get this idea right away. I didn\u2019t have anything other than the clothes on my body and my labour to offer.And the scrolls remaining in the Scroll book.If I were to sell the scrolls to a magic tool shop, I\u2019d, of course, make lots of money. Scrolls were expensive after all.The intentions I read out of this were to first put out the big fire by selling these to get money.However, I wasn\u2019t that reassured. The Writer\u2019s Advice would have good but also bad effects simultaneously in most cases.It advised me to sell the scrolls to raise money.A bad outcome I could think of would be the possibility of getting ripped off, of course. I didn\u2019t know the market price, so the store owner would probably try to rip me off. I didn\u2019t know the exact value of magic scrolls.But I clearly remember Dyrus saying something like:\u2018The Demon King\u2019s Castle sure is amazing, even lower level scrolls are often more expensive than my salary.\u2019A lower level scroll was worth more or less the salary of a Lieutenant of the Imperial Army\u2019s Cavalry.So how much did a Cavalry Lieutenant earn?As a (Self-proclaimed) Medieval Fantasy Specialist, I knew a thing or two about this.There were always descriptions of how many gold coins one needed to feed a family of four, as well as, how much a regular person with an ordinary job would earn in a month.Of course, I also wrote about those things.In the case of this novel here, I had written that a gold coin was equivalent to a month\u2019s food expenses for a family of four. And a regular person with an ordinary job earned about 2 gold coins a month.So.I thought 1 gold coin = 1 million won. (T/N: ca 730 Euro)It was easier to work with if I converted it like that.How could a family of four live on just a million won a month? Wouldn\u2019t they want to eat out at some point? Our house spends about 400 on food, you know?I got these kinds of comments, but they\u2019ll get by somehow.These weren\u2019t living expenses, they were just food expenses. There were no such things as comprehensive insurance, health insurance or telecommunication costs in this world after all!I, as a (self-proclaimed) Medieval Fantasy Expert say:One who seriously researches about the historical background is but a rookie!There are just some things one wouldn\u2019t be able to see if one didn\u2019t empty their minds.I felt sorry for those who weren\u2019t able to enjoy this beautiful medieval fantasy world of magic, knights and social infrastructure that has virtually no science.I have lived by the following ideals:The focus of Medieval Fantasy isn\u2019t on the Medieval part, but on the Fantasy part!It\u2019s not a \u2018Medieval\u2019 Fantasy, but a medieval Fantasy!Most of them didn\u2019t even have anything to do with the Middle Ages! It was kind of like a buzzword!Anyway, How about we do OO with the setting of XX, lol?The genre Medieval Fantasy was created by such shallow thoughts, however what unfolded in front of our eyes is a fantastical world that had nothing to do with the Middle Ages!\u2026This was fantastical in a different sense.Let\u2019s sell the scrolls and live on to see another day.I was neither a wizard nor was I a knight, although I do have the ability to rule over demons, however as I was a Demon Prince who had fallen to the Imperial Capital, Gardium, there wasn\u2019t even a single demon around here.\u201c\u2026.\u2026Excuse me. Could you give me some directions?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? directions?\u201dI tried to ask a passerby, who felt some silent embarrassment for the way I spoke, for the most important thing right now.\u201cOh! Are you lost?\u201dNo, well, a little.* * *The ones who mainly used magic tool shops were adventurers and wizards. Of course, This wasn\u2019t an adventure novel, so while there were people who were adventurers, that didn\u2019t really describe what they did. They did have a job, but I\u2019ve never really thought about that.\u2026Come to think of it, how did adventurers make a living in this world? Did they get by with quests from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild and monster subjugations? Was there even something like an Adventurer\u2019s Guild?There were adventurers, but I hadn\u2019t set up what they earn or through what means.If one thought about it, that was seriously weird.When I tried thinking of ways adventurer\u2019s earned their money, I could only think of dungeon explorations and monster subjugations.However, if that\u2019s how adventurers earned their money, that would also be a problem.There was a regular army, so why did freelancers like adventurers do things like monster subjugations? If the country outsourced personnel to get rid of security issues, such as monster dens and raids, why did that country even exist? What did the citizens pay taxes for?Although the Warrior Artorius actually killed the Demon King, but the Empire and its Principalities, that had enough military power to take on the Demon Army, solved their monster problems through the Adventurer\u2019s Guild? What were the soldiers good for then?So, if the regular army took care of monster subjugations and there were no such quests coming from the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, then how did the adventurers earn their keep?Well, if the whole world was filled with dungeons for adventurers to plunder wouldn\u2019t that be weird as well? Why were rare magical items just rolling around in a dungeon and no country went to claim them for themselves? Wouldn\u2019t they usually do something like nationalizing the dungeons so that adventurers wouldn\u2019t monopolize them?Wasn\u2019t the existence of adventurers in and of itself a setting error judging by this world\u2019s common sense?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf one started to pay attention to historical accuracy, one would lose, but I started to worry a little.It really bothered me.Since I started to think that this was the world I had to live in, I seriously tried to move on from that topic.Let\u2019s not think about this anymore. It\u2019s not like hungry adventurers would just rush up to people asking for a penny. If adventurers didn\u2019t have jobs, they\u2019d just be robbers or even bandits.There was just one thing I really had to care about.To not get ripped off in the Magic Tool Store. I had to get at least 1 gold piece for each scroll. I was planning on keeping constant eye contact, to appear strong. I didn\u2019t think it was too much to ask for a regular price. However, if they were to whine about the quality being not up to par or something, I\u2019d never sell it to them.I planned to go eat somewhere after I got some money.I was so hungry.Afterwards, I should find an inn and take some time to organize my thoughts.There were positive points about the Writer\u2019s advice in that it clearly determined what I should do, regardless of whether the advice was right or not.If the advice was unconditionally good, I\u2019d just empty my brain and follow what it told me.Oh, is that why there were traps in there? They wanted me to stay on my toes?Did they want to see me struggle or something?* * *As the main stage of the story, I had to describe the Capital Gardium in quite detail.No, well, I didn\u2019t go quite as far as describing every single brick. It was just specific areas.However, setting up an imaginary place was quite cumbersome. It was pretty difficult, because there was a strong possibility that I might make mistakes and if it wasn\u2019t properly set up, one would just get confused later on.That said, the Capital Gardium was pretty similar to Seoul.Was it just similar?Well, I must confess, it was just Seoul with a different name.This was my description of the Imperial Capital.\u2018A great Irene river runs through the Imperial Capital Gardium, splitting it in the northern part where the imperial palace was located and the southern part where the temple was located. The river\u2019s huge tributaries serve as its borders.\u2019Could you see it?Gangnam\u00a0and\u00a0Gangbuk.\u2018In the center of the northern part of Gardium lies the Imperial Palace Emperatos.\u2019In other words, the Imperial palace in\u00a0Jongno. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as big as\u00a0Gyeongbokgung Palace, the entire Jongno District was the imperial palace after all.\u2018In the southern Eredian district, one of the Capital\u2019s two greatest landmarks, the Temple, the other one being the Imperial Palace, was located. It was also a gigantic educational facility and the cradle of many talented young people.\u2019In other words, the Temple was in the\u00a0Gwanak District.So Eredian District = Gwanak District.So I ended up setting up the Capital Gardium as a space so similar to Seoul that the only thing different about it was the name. The districts also had medieval sounding names.This was an actual sentence out of the novel.[The main character\u2019s party sprinted all the way from the Gehenna district to the Eredian district. The effect of their physical training was showing.]How the scene actually appeared in my mind:\u2018The main character\u2019s party ran from the\u00a0Dongjak District\u00a0to the Gwanak District.\u2019It was kind of like that. I wouldn\u2019t even need to create a different map. I could just imagine Seoul\u2019s map and change the district names. It was convenient and I felt good about myself. If one just drew up an imaginary map, the readers wouldn\u2019t even be interested in it. I did that when I was in middle school, but there was no one who was even remotely interested in it. That was when it hit me.These maps of imaginary worlds were for the writer and not the readers. The reason Gardium seemed like Seoul was entirely because of my needs.The Temple was in Gwanak and the Imperial Palace in Jongno.The place I got teleported to was the Al Ligar District. Later it would be changed to Artorius District in honor of the hero. They would build a huge statue of him as well.Where was this Al Ligar District and later Artorius District located, you ask?This was\u00a0Yongsan.Of course, it was just the topography and division that were similar, the buildings were completely different, so this was just like a neighborhood I never went to before.I arrived in Yongsan, so I headed towards the shopping district, which was about where the\u00a0Yongsan Electronics Market\u00a0was.Even though this was an imaginary place, maybe because it was that kind of region.\u201cWhat kind of crappy scrolls are these? Dude, where did you get this stuff?\u201dAs if proving that this was Yongsan, I encountered a gangster like bastard in my first try.* * *At the shop owner\u2019s first words, I went back out to the streets thinking that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do some immediate business with that owner, which I had already engraved as a gangster\u00a0 in my memory. He muttered something, but I didn\u2019t even listen to what he was saying.Every building around this area was a shop. Thousands of people were passing by, looking at things. Were all these people adventurers?How was being an adventurer lucrative? Was there some kind of way to earn money that I wasn\u2019t aware of? Actually, it had to be like thatt, otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be so many of them.It felt strange. As if someone filled my plot holes for me.Noise came from every corner of this place.\u201cOh, young adventurer! I just opened up! Hey, since it\u2019s this store\u2019s opening, I\u2019ll sell to you at half the price, how about it?\u201d\u201cOh, so ya looked and touched all these things, but you\u2019re not gonna buy anythin?

Don\u2019t make me angry.\u201d...No.What\u2019s with this?Why did it really turn into Yongsan?What unfolded before me was the medieval version of Yongsan.\u201cWas everyone like this?\u201dI felt like prey.\u201cOh, well, erm. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll just look for some other place\u2026.\u201dI tried my best not to get devoured.\u2013 Hey, don\u2019t make eye contact. Don\u2019t meet their eyes. There are some crazy bastards who won\u2019t even buy stuff and just unpack it and take it.\u2013 They\u2019re all retired adventurers, so they\u2019re good at fighting. If you pick a fight, you\u2019ll get one of your arms or legs broken.Even the people who knew what this place was, came in groups.Just when I was imagining Yongsan, what spread out in front of me was really the Yongsan I had in my mind.And here I was, a 17-year-old push over that tried to sell magic scrolls from the Demon Realm to people who were even worse.Yongsan.Just that one word made me feel like it was an impossible endeavour.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12As I found out later, the Al Ligar district\u2019s shopping district was notorious among adventurers. It was a place filled with unscrupulous merchants who nearly forced people to buy things, never refunded and charged them several tens of times of the market price.Nevertheless, it was the largest shopping district in the Imperial Capital and most items necessary for adventurers could only be purchased there, so it was a notorious place that, alas, couldn\u2019t be avoided.Well, it was the same as the old Yongsan Electronics Market. Just a fantasy version of it.It was a place novice adventurers were more scared of than dungeons. A place where it was common for people who wanted to start out as adventurers to give up on these thoughts.The victims were mostly just teenaged novice adventurers who came here with their saved up pocket money.Was it PTSD? I felt my whole body shaking.That bastard who sold me MP3s. Are you doing well, I wonder?You have to live a good life. If you just continue to live such a bad life, wouldn\u2019t that be sad, huh? Wouldn\u2019t it?Let\u2019s calm down.Among these many gangsters, I had to find a proper magic tool shop to sell these scrolls to. No, well, at first that felt easy enough, but it seemed like the difficulty just rose absurdly high suddenly.Somehow it felt impossible to do.Just by knowing the fact that this was Yongsan.There were many shops such as weapon shops, armor shops, tool shops, etc. however, I was looking for a magic tool shop. A magic tool shop was basically a place where a lot of money changed their owners pretty quickly, different from these other shops.\u201cWhat do you want? Don\u2019t touch anything and get out.\u201dI couldn\u2019t even enter most of the shops because the owners were afraid I might touch a scroll and activate it. I also didn\u2019t look like an adventurer.The first store owner was actually rather kind as he let me in.Even though there were some who strangely let me come in, their reactions weren\u2019t that good.The merchant looked at the scroll that I said I was going to sell and frowned.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this? Were you gonna sell these for money? Look at that brat. Don\u2019t make a fuss and get out. Well, I can give ya two bronze coins for these.\u201dWhat?Did all the gangsters collude or something? How could they slap me in the face like this? I wasn\u2019t sure about 2 gold coins, but you wouldn\u2019t even give me 1? Didn\u2019t that guy have at least that much conscience left in him?I didn\u2019t say anything, grabbed my scrolls and left. They were just a bunch of crooks not worth talking to.However, the response from the next shop was also poor.\u201cHaha, what\u2019s this? It\u2019s my first time seeing someone trying to scam me like this. Ah, what bad luck. Get out of here, bastard!\u201dThere were some who kicked me out as soon as they saw the scrolls.After getting turned down like this three times in a row, I realized that something was odd.What did they mean, scam?The next store treated me the same. I got sent off two consecutive times with the words \u201cWhat\u2019s with this nonsense?!\u201d.\u201cWhat the hell do you think of people doing business here, huh? Do you think we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference?!\u201d..\u201cDon\u2019t just doodle these weird things and actually learn how to draw.\u201dIt was a rather friendly reply, but I still got turned down.They looked at me as if I was some madman trying some weird scam by selling fake scrolls.This bizarre situation was going on instead of the good and bad outcomes I was expecting. Everything that the Writer\u2019s Advice hinted at went wrong.Were they thinking that the scrolls I took out weren\u2019t the real deal just because I looked young? Did they think these were fakes that just looked kind of similar?I had to show them that they actually worked, but if I activated a scroll I\u2019d just waste it. I couldn\u2019t blow my capital like that. If I showed them and then asked for money afterwards, I\u2019m pretty sure they wouldn\u2019t give it to me.The next place I went to was more out-of-the-way.\u201cHo-oh\u2026.\u201dThe shop owner glanced at the scroll and his eyes lit up. I thought he was someone who could finally recognize these scrolls\u2019 true value without being prejudiced.To be honest, I was exhausted, so I just wanted to finally sell them even if he ripped me off badly. The man suddenly fumbled through his drawers and pulled out a scroll.\u201cHey, you shouldn\u2019t draw this, try doing these, these and these.\u201dHe did recognize the value.\u201cIf you can draw the same thing, I\u2019ll give you five silver coins each. How about it?\u201dThe only problem was that he saw value in me and not in the scrolls.It seemed like that guy was misunderstanding something greatly, trying to make me mass-produce fake scrolls to sell.I was almost flabbergasted by this devilish idea that transcended dimensions.The owner kept on raising the remuneration even though I didn\u2019t do anything, and in the end, he offered me 1 gold coin per sheet.I had never seen such a vicious bastard before.\u201cOh, come on! Fine! Let\u2019s go 50/50! Okay? But you\u2019ll have to rake in lots of money for me, got that? So young and already so ferocious\u2026\u2026 Huh.\u201dIt was tempting, but I wasn\u2019t the one who drew these so I really couldn\u2019t do it. However, I did feel in awe, seeing the eyes of that man coveting talent that I didn\u2019t have.He was such a crook that I almost genuinely wanted to punish him. No, well, scrolls were supposed to be used in emergencies. If the scroll turned out to be fake, that person trying to use it would most likely die, right?You were playing with people\u2019s lives here, you know? He was the top bastard among these petty thugs.I ended up sighing and nodded my head.\u201cSure, can I bring you the finished products tomorrow?\u201dJust looking at these complex shapes, it was probably impossible for me to replicate them here.\u201cO, ooh! Yes, yes! Can you bring it in tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI might have to stay up all night.\u201d\u201cOh, good! Yeah! I\u2019ll give you the money as soon as I get it! The profit\u2019s 50/50, so if they get sold, we\u2019ll split the profits! You know there\u2019s no business like this, right, buddy?\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t tell me even if you sold one, you bastard.I left the shop with the scroll the merchant handed to me.\u2013 You\u2019re going to make me a fortune!Hearing the sounds coming from behind me made me involuntarily sigh.What\u2019s with this?Was that guy\u2019s head only filled with greed? Was he the type of person that couldn\u2019t see clearly ahead of him because of his own greed?Anyway.I got a Fireball Scroll for free.* * *I came to sell a scroll and saw the extraordinary profit of earning one scroll. Fireball was an attack spell, and unlike other novels who treated this spell as one of the basics, Fireball was quite a powerful spell in this world.Why was a spell that created an explosion right in front of you only a basic spell?I was a stubborn bastard, that insistent on not caring about historical facts.However, these things bothered me.Honestly though, I didn\u2019t think that much about it.Could anyone just carry a fireball scroll or something? Shouldn\u2019t it be banned by law? Well, wasn\u2019t this like selling rocket launchers like RPG-7s on the street? Weren\u2019t these just fantasy versions of dynamite?Medieval Fantasies were just dreamlands for terrorists.I should have put various restrictions on magic scroll trading when I was writing about this. Back then I had no reason to worry about these laws and regulations, but now that I had to live here, I felt they were much too lax.Of course, I didn\u2019t create an entire set of laws for the Gardias Empire when I was describing it. However Imperial Laws should exist and it\u2019s obviously going to be a huge amount.It\u2019s not like the parts I haven\u2019t described didn\u2019t exist, however this environment where anyone could just use magic scrolls certainly didn\u2019t seem safe to me.This was dangerous\u2026.People seemed to think my scrolls were fake. I had no idea if they thought that because I was just some kid who didn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d be able to get his hands on scrolls at all or if there was some other reason.I walked endlessly and finally found another magic tool shop on this street filled with gangsters. Maybe I should check and see if there was just a problem with my wares.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 Are you a customer?\u201dThere was a disheveled person who seemed to have slept on the table, raising her head in this scroll shop filled with the smell of paper and ink.She looked drowsy, not at all willing to do business.\u201cI\u2019m here to sell magic scrolls.\u201d\u201cHuh? Sell scrolls? You?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI took out the Fireball scroll and put it in front of her. The merchant woman unfolded the scroll and glanced over it, frowned and then hit my head.-Bang!\u201cArgh! Why are you hitting me?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for a kid to carry things like these.\u201dThe woman frowned and shook her head as if she couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cI usually don\u2019t buy stuff like this, but I\u2019d rather buy it off of you, so that you can\u2019t carry this around with you anymore.\u201dShe said something like \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped so I\u2019ll take it off of you\u201d. What a gangster-like expression.\u201c4 gold. It\u2019s useless even if you don\u2019t want to sell it for that. I won\u2019t return it to you.\u201dI got my hands on a lot more money than I planned on getting.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask where you got this from, but if you\u2019re caught carrying these things around, you\u2019ll get scolded. You got that? I\u2019ll remember your face.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t a gangster who made hard sales but one that forcibly bought things.It was at that moment that I changed her name from gangster to kind beautiful shop owner inside my mind.No, actually, scratch that. It should be Great Beauty.Anyway, I sighed heavily.\u201cTch, kids really don\u2019t know how to be afraid of magic.\u201dIt looked like she really bought it because this was something dangerous. Whatever, I got my money.\u201cThank you.\u201dI bowed my head and tried to leave the shop. I had to buy some things with these. I had to be careful not to let it get stolen or to get ripped off. I also had a lot on my mind.\u201cWait.\u201dThe owner called out to me.\u201cYou, come here.\u201dWith a very languid expression on her face, she told me to come to her, then she came out from behind the counter and approached me.\u201cWhy are you wearing a scroll book? Take them all out.\u201dIt felt like I got caught red handed.\u201cUh, I. There\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like she\u2019d take it all away, if I had any more dangerous magic scrolls. She dragged me to a chair and took away my scroll book.\u201cYou picked something up someone lost, didn\u2019t you? You didn\u2019t even try to return it to the owner and thought about selling it, huh? You brat. You must be mad.\u201dShe clicked her tongue while saying \u201cWhat are kids doing these days?\u201d. She seemed convinced that there was absolutely no way that I actually got these on my own. Well, the source was actually pretty questionable.She pulled out a scroll, unfolded it, looked at it and frowned.\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201dShe seemed puzzled, then she went to her counter and unfolded the Fireball Scroll I gave to her.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s true.\u201dIt was at that moment, I realized that there must have been a good reason as to why so many merchants thought I was trying to trick and scam them.The merchant unfolded my scrolls one by one, and gradually became speechless.She sat next to me and gently wrapped her arms around my shoulders.\u201cBaby.\u201dNo.No matter how young I was, I absolutely wasn\u2019t like a baby.The woman\u2019s voice was endlessly sweet.\u201c..\u2026\u2026Ye, yes?\u201d\u201cYou have to be honest, okay?\u201dAlso, she bore a sense of ingenuity that seemed to want to peer inside of me.\u201cWhere did you get all these scrolls?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThis is the magic construction method used by demons. Why do you have these?\u201dA Writer\u2019s Advice usually led to both good and bad outcomes.I could definitely see now what they meant with that.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13There was magic.That\u2019s as far as my set up went, so of course I didn\u2019t know \u2018How\u2019 it worked. It wasn\u2019t my role to know how magic worked or how it manifested.How did magic work, what were the magic formula and what was mana\u2026?Who the hell would want to read up on that bullshit in a fantasy novel?To begin with, what\u2019s even the difference between explaining how magic worked or how there was a black flame dragon sleeping in ones right arm? It was just a setup.If one got that, than one could also just move on. Even if you don\u2019t mention all the details of some old, dusty martial technique vault in martial arts novels, the reader would understand what was going on just by reading the line. In other words, that was what one called shared common sense.However, there was a principle and way that overthrew said common sense.The magic system of demons and humans were different. They used the same kind of magic, but in different ways. They were like how steam locomotives and modern trains ran on the same kind of track.Therefore, a scroll inscribed with demonic magic was capable of ultra-long distance teleportation, while a scroll containing human magic wasn\u2019t.It was impossible for me to distinguish between human and demonic magic just by looking at the formula. It was a mistake that stemmed from my ignorance and lack of understanding of just what I was trying to do here.The other merchants couldn\u2019t recognize the magic formulas of demons, probably because they weren\u2019t wizards, so they thought the scrolls were fake. However, this woman who was both the magic tool shop owner and probably a wizard recognized that my scrolls were working with a different systems.\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me? Please?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what that woman would do to me.Could I somehow get through this situation using my achievement points?I had to make this woman think that my scrolls were insignificant.[To trigger this event 3000 achievement points are required.]Again, I needed more points than I actually had. I mean, it was highly unlikely to find demonic scrolls in the middle of the Imperial Capital after all, so that would seriously undermine probability.In the end, I had no other choice but to open my mouth.\u201cTha, that\u2026. Erm\u2026. A, at the\u2026 At the Demon King\u2019s\u2026 Castle\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dI had no other choice but to tell her the truth.\u201cI bought them from the Demon King\u2019s Castle\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe woman frowned after hearing my words.\u201cWhat do you mean? You brought these scrolls from the Demon King\u2019s Castle?\u201dThe woman furrowed her eyebrows as if she couldn\u2019t make sense of my words. However, these demonic scrolls made what I said believable apparently.I recounted the whole story to her. The long story of how I ended up being imprisoned together with the princess in the Demon King\u2019s Castle and how we used teleportation scrolls to escape from there. Then I told her that, after arriving at the Capital, I found myself all alone with no money and somehow had to find a place to live, so I tired selling these scrolls.I even added that I didn\u2019t know who I was because I lost my memory.\u201cOh, my god\u2026. This is so absurd\u2026\u2026 Do you want me to believe that? The princess has been rescued?\u201dDumbfounded she furrowed her brows even more. She looked into my eyes and sighed.\u201cYou\u2019re lying. If you actually rescued the princess, you\u2019d be given a noble title or whatever. Why are you alone, huh?\u201dThat was natural. The price for saving the princess\u2019 life was beyond imagination. To the extent that it would seem absurd to just reject it and wander around alone.The only logical explanation would be that I didn\u2019t save her, of course.However, I was a master of \u2018additional settings\u2019, that is, finding excuses.These settings were actually like that so as to avoid a setting error I\u2019d just rearrange some words.That\u2019s what it meant to be a specialist in making excuses!\u201cThat\u2026. When we escaped, a lot of Duke Salerian\u2019s Knights died. I might get rewarded, but I thought Prince Bertus was going to try and kill me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u2026 Retaliation\u2026\u2026 Yes\u2026\u2026 I guess, that makes sense\u2026\u2026 It would probably be difficult for the princess to protect you\u2026\u2026 Obviously\u2026\u2026\u201dI was able to make use of the excuse I planned on giving the princess if she happened to stumble upon me in a completely different place by any chance. A reward would be good, but it was, of course, not as precious as my own life.Of course, this was just an excuse, albeit an understandable one. I also hoped for Dyrus\u2019 safety. I was sure they\u2019d plan to retaliate against him as well.She stared at me.\u201cYour story is too elaborate to be made up on the spot.\u201dIt seemed like her last doubts had been solved.She seemed to believe my story. With such a ridiculous thing in her hands it seemed like she had no other choice but to believe my exciting story.She sighed again.\u201cSo, that means, the Demon King\u2026\u2026 is dead\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA strange light flashed in her eyes at my words. She seemed relieved, but I couldn\u2019t determine if it was sorrow or joy she actually felt. She had been silent for a long time. Eventually, she looked at me with sad eyes.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a relief. How hard it must have been for the young princess\u2026 How hard it must have been for you.\u201dShe wrapped her arms around me and patted me on the back as if pitying me.No, well, I wasn\u2019t actually tortured.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t actually remember any of that\u2026. So it\u2019s okay.\u201dLet\u2019s moderately circumvent this situation.\u201cYes, I\u2019m glad that you don\u2019t have to suffer from such a bad memory. Thank God.\u201dShe kept patting me on the back, telling me that it would be better to live without these memories and that it would be too painful to remember them. What, why was she being so kind to me? By the way, I was pretty hungry and had some things to sort out mentally, so I kind of wanted to leave, you know?\u201cLet me look at you for a second, kid. Still\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere were definitely a lot of people who had memory problems after suffering sever torture, but you were trapped in a terrifying place such as the Demon King\u2019s Castle. Right?\u201dNo, it was originally my home sweet home, but the problem was that the hero\u2019s party just decided to pay us a visit.\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a curse on your body. So I\u2026.\u201dShe looked at me with warm eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll try to cast a simple spell on you. If you lost your memory because of a curse, your memory might return, but this spell can\u2019t remove curses that are too strong\u2026.\u201dShe formed a sign.\u201cUh, hey, wait a minute!\u201d\u201cDispel.\u201dThe spell had already been cast.\u201c\u2026\u2026.?\u201dShe looked at me as if she had no idea what\u2019s going on. Horns, and a skin color that was slightly different from a humans.It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know what that meant. She just couldn\u2019t accept it.\u201cOh.\u201dA Writer\u2019s Advice.From now on I shall call it a son of a bitch.\u201cYo\u2026. Your Highness\u2026?\u201dHowever, the words that came out of her mouth completely changed my mind.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Your Highness.Naturally I knew that\u2019s what one usually calls a prince.But why was there someone who recognized me in such a random place?Of course, I knew what that meant. It was just hard to accept. The shop owner immediately knelt down in front of me.\u201cI, I\u2026. I, Eleris of the Demon Army\u2019s Gardium Invasion team, greets His Highness the Prince.\u201d\u201cU, uh\u2026.\u201dWas this good? This was a good thing, right? My mind was working on overdrive trying to interpret this situation and how I should treat this woman in front of me, who definitely was a Demon.At least this wasn\u2019t a dangerous situation, right?\u201cI believe, it would be better if you came this way first.\u201dShe alternated looking at me and the store\u2019s entrance, then led me into the warehouse behind her. If a customer came in while we stood in front of the entrance like that, they\u2019d immediately discover that this store housed demons.She cast a spell and soon there was a subtle change to her appearance.\u201cHey, don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201dTwo fangs slightly peeked out from between her red lips.Red eyes and pale skin.I seemed to know what she was.\u201cA, a vampire\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m Eleris Tuesday from the House of Seven Nights.\u201dWhat the hell kind of chuuni setting is the House of Seven Nights? I never wrote anything about those kind of things. Anyway, the other party seemed concerned about me. She carefully put a hand to my face, while I was still dumbfounded.\u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026 Have you really lost your memory\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, uhm\u2026 Oh, I guess\u2026 I don\u2019t remember much. Except for the fact that I was the Prince of the Demon Realm\u2026.\u201dI had no other choice but to be honest, as I thought it would be a hundred times better to just be honest than fake having memories I don\u2019t have.There was a strange light in her eyes again. I had no idea what kinds of emotions she felt.\u201cTo leave the castle and come all the way here all on your own in such a situation\u2026.\u201dShe held my hand carefully, looking like she was about to cry.\u201cWhat a stroke of luck. I don\u2019t know how this came to be, but I feel like I have to give my thanks to the Gods.\u201dThe vampire seemed to think that this was just an absurd coincidence, to the extent that she felt grateful towards God.However, when I thought that this situation came to be because of the Writer\u2019s Advice, it would probably be more fitting to thank the devil. It was a ridiculous coincidence for Eleris, however to me it was an inevitability.Go to the magic tool shop.Eleris might have recognized the demonic scroll because she was a wizard, but it was highly likely that she did because she was a Demon herself.So, going to the magic tool shop to sell scrolls was just a disguise, there were actually hidden intentions behind this advice.The message hidden in it was to find a demon spy who infiltrated Gardium and ask for help.However, if I had been caught by a human wizard who happened to recognized that the scrolls were made by demons, I might have been in a tougher position. The outcome could have been rather dangerous, but in the end I really did meet a Demon spy.After a moment.Come to think of it, the Vague Advice hinted to something similar in the end.[A Writer\u2019s Vague Advice][How could so many people have gotten kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle?]Not \u2018Why\u2019 but \u2018How\u2019.I wrote that those people were kidnapped by spies from the Demon Realm who had infiltrated the Human Realm. The vague advice was a subtle message for me to find the spies, since they would still be in the Human Realm. However, I didn\u2019t even think of that, because I was completely lost and hungry.If I had understood the vague advice, I would have gotten a clue that I had to entrust myself to a demon spy in Gardium. If I had moved carefully, it would have been absolutely safe.The Writer\u2019s Clear Advice was quite risky but intuitive and the Writer\u2019s Vague Advice tried to hint at what I should be doing.Vague Advice was relatively safe and Clear Advice presented some risks.\u201cErm\u2026. Could there have been a human wizard capable of recognizing scrolls of the Demon Realm?\u201dI spoke informally, however Eleris didn\u2019t seem to mind it.\u201cThere are some weridos who study even the magic of demons. I\u2019m glad you came to me before you met any of them.\u201dA chill ran down my spine at the thought what a disaster it would have been if anyone actually recognized these scrolls before I met Eleris. I could have seriously gotten myself killed.She went back outside into her shop again, locked its door and took me upstairs.\u201cI shall do my best to serve you from now on.\u201dSaying so, she sat me down on a sofa.Soon, she began to tidy up her messy room.Wait, she was a vampire.So, why was this room so well lit? It wasn\u2019t a huge apartment, but wasn\u2019t there a lot of sunlight getting in?\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this kind of dangerous for Vampires?\u201dShe looked at me and nodded.\u201cI\u2019m a Vampire Lord. I can handle this level of light. Of course, it isn\u2019t good for my body though.\u201dNo, I could see you flinch a little every time light hit you while you were straightening out the table cloth. Were you really okay?\u201cThis was an annex to the store, so I don\u2019t have to pay rent. I also would have wanted to live in a dream like residential area like a semi-basement where the sun doesn\u2019t shine all year round, but the budget for my actions are rather tight\u2026.\u201d\u2026How sad.I didn\u2019t exactly know what a Vampire Lord was, but wasn\u2019t this just too sad for a high-ranking vampire?I did understand that such an environment would be dreamlike for a vampire, but just hearing her say that she desired to live in a semi-basement was just too sad. A Vampire was worried about rent\u2026.\u201cUh, wouldn\u2019t it be fine if you just made the landlord your kin?\u201dCome to think of it, wouldn\u2019t it be very easy for a vampire to get rich? Wasn\u2019t that common sense?\u201cI had a similar idea, but to create a kin, I would have to take on too many risks. It\u2019s not easy to create a kin while disguised as an ordinary person.\u201dEleris certainly was a strong vampire, but that didn\u2019t mean the ones she created would be just as strong. It was obvious that a normal man who suddenly avoided the sun and stopped eating would be considered suspicious.No.Wasn\u2019t it actually quite difficult for Vampires, who were the Nobles of the Night, to blend in with human society?After cleaning up moderately, Eleris looked at me.\u201cYou must be hungry. Let me prepare some food.\u201d\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026.\u201dDon\u2019t Vampires drink blood? Do you even have any normal ingredients here?As if aware of my concerns, Eleris put on a hooded robe.\u201cI\u2019ll be out for little while.\u201d\u201cN, no. Will you be fine?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be alright.\u201dJust because of me, this vampire went grocery shopping in broad daylight. I was dumbfounded at how easily she just said that.Thank you so much and I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m so ignorant and helpless!After she quickly bought something to eat for me she looked so exhausted. I was close to tears.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14The Demons I saw at the Demon King\u2019s Castle ran rampant to save me. They seemed to recognize me even though I cast Camouflage on myself.However, Eleris, who was also a demon, didn\u2019t recognize me, before my real appearance was revealed.What was the reason for that? I pondered while Eleris was away, but I didn\u2019t come to an answer.My ability to control demons was incomplete. That was the only guess I could make.What Eleris bought were sandwiches and milk. She apologized to me for not having much to offer.\u201cI don\u2019t have that much leeway\u2026. I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness.\u201dAs I ate gratefully, I tilted my head at the sudden thought I had.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you just buy a Fireball Scroll for 4 gold?\u201d\u201cOh. Tha, that was\u2026.\u201dShe told me that it was too dangerous for a kid like me to walk around carrying something like that and just threw a huge chunk of money at me.\u201cI just thought it would be dangerous for a child to carry something like this\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness.\u201dFor a spy she was pretty sympathetic and compassionate. Was it fine to be so good-natured as a vampire? Was that how you spent all your money?I took out the 4 gold coins I had stored and put them on the table.\u201cI don\u2019t think I could spend so much anyway, so I\u2019ll return it to you.\u201d\u201cOh, that, that\u2019s\u2026. Thanks.\u201dAnyway, I got a guardian who happened to be a high-ranking vampire now, so having all that money would seem pretty meaningless.She was watching me eat with a sad expression on her face. What\u2019s good is good. Because of her good natured personality, I gained a vampire protector. She could help me out in emergencies.And.That awkward mood still lingered.There were some unknown emotions swiping over Eleris face when I told her that the Demon King was dead.It clearly wasn\u2019t anger at the loss of her master. It felt like relief.Although I continued to eat casually, I didn\u2019t stop thinking.Eleris seemed happy that the Demon King died and about the fact that the Demon World War ended in the human\u2019s victory.So was this vampire a pacifist or something while still being a spy?Or maybe she was influenced by the humans because she lived in Gardium for too long. Either way, this vampire was the kind of person who couldn\u2019t even overlook a young boy like me carrying around a fireball scroll, even though she didn\u2019t even know who I was.And the emotions she showed while I was talking about the princess also felt like genuine sympathy and compassion.She said, that she must have gone through so much hardship while still being so young.This vampire hated war and felt joyous about its end.I still didn\u2019t know if she was happy about the war\u2019s end or the human\u2019s victory though.She\u2019s taking care of me for now, but her loyalty towards the Demon King had disappeared a long time ago.So what was the surviving Demon Prince to those who hate war?Wouldn\u2019t he just be like the embers of a new war? Than it was obvious what her best choice would be if she wanted to avoid another war.I see.Beneath the hem of her robe, Eleris\u2019 fingertips were trembling violently.Maybe she just felt weak because of her exposure to the sun, but maybe she actually just made up her mind on something, but was too afraid to go through with it?Fear of having to completely end the Demon World, her hometown, with her own hands.Disgust towards herself who was trying to kill the young and helpless me to prevent any more war from happening.I wonder if she was really thinking like that or if this was just my imagination.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cUh, ah\u2026. Yes.\u201d\u201cHave you really, really\u2026. Lost your memories, all of them?\u201dWhen Eleris asked me this with a trembling voice, I was almost certain of what she was trying to do.\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t remember anything but who I was. I don\u2019t even know why this happened and I believe I definitely wasn\u2019t cursed or possessed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, whatever. Not that searching for my memories would change anything.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if these words would reassure her or not.\u201cI\u2019ve only gone through it for one day, but war sure is crazy.\u201dAt these words, an indescribable joy flashed across Eleris\u2019 face.\u201cThe, then, ah, no! You are the master of the Demon Realm and the hope of all demons! You must have a strong heart and rebuild the Demon Realm and raise it up again\u2026!\u201dShe was trying really hard to say things she didn\u2019t mean or stood behind.\u201cThe Demon Realm has already fallen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI neither intend to be the king of a country that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dLet\u2019s drive it home.\u201cNor should you act like the subject of a country that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt these words, tears fell from the vampire\u2019s eyes.She proved her innocence by crying.There was a time when novels like that dominated my childhood.But vampires were able to cry in this world, huh?After saying, that she was sorry for her behavior, Eleris went down to the first floor and didn\u2019t come up for a while. It didn\u2019t seem like what I said had any negative impact on her.* * *That night.I lay in bed. Eleris said she\u2019d watch over me, so she sat down on a chair by my bed, looking out the window from where some moonlight was pouring in.It was said that Vampires were the nobles of the night.She was really pretty.I was looking at Eleris, who shone paley in the moonlight.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\u201c.\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t call you anything else.\u201dEleris said so and kept talking without looking at me.\u201cYou should never tell anyone else what you told me today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to. If I were to say these things, I\u2019d reveal that I\u2019m a demon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dThat\u2019s not why, Eleris said powerfully.\u201cExcluding me, there are two other infiltrators that have infiltrated Gardium.\u201dYes.That\u2019s exactly what I expected, because she told me it was an Infiltration group.\u201cYou will inevitably get to know the other two as well. It would be unacceptable for them if Your Highness continued hiding away from the world.\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cCount Argon Pontheus. And then there\u2019s the one known as Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.\u201d\u201cOne of them is a noble?\u201dWasn\u2019t that way more than a spy?\u201cYes. He was the one who directly carried out the abduction of the princess and the empress.\u201dWhen I heard that it was him who kidnapped the princess, I flinched. Naturally, the demons here must have carried out the abduction themselves.But it felt strange to think that the one who did it was someone like him and that he\u2019d definitely be someone loyal to the Demon Realm.I felt like I was faced with the uncomfortable truth that I was, after all, nothing more than her parents\u2019 enemy to Charlotte.\u201cCount Pontheus\u2019 real name is Sarkegaar. He\u2019s of the Dreadfiend race.\u201dFiends belonged to the demon tribe. Fiends were a sub-species of demons. But I didn\u2019t know what a Dreadfiend was.Why did I get sent into my novel, only to find mostly things I didn\u2019t know about?\u201d\u201cCould you elaborate?\u201d\u201cDreadfiends are basically demons who specialize in transformation magic, including counter magic. That\u2019s why he was able to fool the humans\u2019 eyes and penetrate into the aristocratic society, the heart of Gardias. He wasn\u2019t detected not because of the level of his transformation, but because he changed his race itself. You can think of them as being able to use abilities similar to Polymorph, one of the highest level magic spells, from birth.\u201dThere were many types of transformation magic. There was camouflage, which was a low-level magic spell. It was the one I used. Then there was the method of creating optical illusions with illusion magic, and the method of transforming for a short period.However, polymorph was a highest level spell that could change one\u2019s very body structure. This kind of magic couldn\u2019t be lifted by using Detection or Dispel.Dreadfiends could use abilities similar to that polymorph from birth. All this would have been much easier if I had turned into that kind of demon.\u201cHe\u2019s absolutely loyal to the Demon King. Not only would he go to war, he would be willing to sacrifice even his soul if it meant he could rebuild the Demon Realm.\u201dWeren\u2019t Fiends usually in the position of stealing souls? How loyal was he?\u201cSo if he came to know that I wasn\u2019t interested in rebuilding the Demon Realm\u2026 it\u2019d cause some real problems, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be to that level, but he\u2019d try to make Your Highness want to.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t kill me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the last Arcdemon. Without you, the Demon Realm cannot be rebuilt. So he will try to change your mind somehow.\u201dWere Arcdemons such an important race? Right now, I was just a kid who couldn\u2019t do anything on his own.\u201cWhat if I still don\u2019t change my mind, then what?\u201dEleris looked at me and smiled. Then she put her hand on my head. She had a low body temperature, but it felt good in its own way.\u201cEven if it means destroying everything you love, he will do it.\u201dI had just arrived in this world, but Sarkegaar would do everything except kill me to make me the next Demon King.\u201cFor now, please just go along with him. And it won\u2019t be too late to use your hand when you built up enough strength to overwhelm Sarkegaar.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Yes, well. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s also very competent. He\u2019ll be able to help Your Highness in a lot more ways than I\u2019m capable of.\u201dFirst of all, he was a spy, but he was also a noble. Sarkegaar is, after all, a loyalist. He wouldn\u2019t do anything that could cause me harm.Actually, the most dangerous person to me was Eleris before I told her I wasn\u2019t interested in war. It seemed like Eleris was trying to kill me, though she looked like she wouldn\u2019t want to do that anymore.\u201cWait, just out of curiosity, if I became the actual Demon King after going along with what he said, what would you do?\u201d\u201c..\u2026 I don\u2019t know about that.\u201dEleris sighed with a bitter smile.\u201cWhen that time comes, you\u2019ll have to choose between me or Sarkegaar.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dPerhaps killing me now would be\u00a0her best option to burn the roots of war, but Eleris didn\u2019t seem like she was able to do that.\u201cYou have to grow up to be good, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will try.\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe that I was hearing these things from a Vampire.\u201cSo what is that Irene\u2019s Wild Dog?\u201dWhat was with that creepy nickname? Irene\u2019s Wild Dog?\u00a0 Were they trying to seem cool? She scratched her cheek slightly.\u201cThey\u2026.. There are illegal gangs in Gardium committing crimes in various places\u2026\u2026 Something like that\u2026\u2026 Irene\u2019s Wild Dog is the head of one such gang.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026The demon sent as a spy became a gangster?\u201dWhat kind of dog was he supposed to be again?Eleris wore an awkward smile showing her dumbfoundedness.\u201cStrictly speaking, rather than being a gang\u2026 They are just some people that stuck together. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s inevitable for violence to occur because they are together.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Isn\u2019t that a gang?\u201d\u201cWhat should I call this\u2026.\u201dEleris seemed even more hesitant than when she was talking about Sarkegaar.\u201cThat\u2019s how one turns out if the only thing one\u2019s good at is fighting.\u201dWhatever it is, if the guy who\u2019s going to help me is the head of a big organization, what was the harm in that? Eleris sighed deeply and muttered openly.\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 a beggar.\u201d\u201c..\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThe gang members are usually selling candies or something to people walking along the Irene River\u2026. In fact, that\u2019s how they also earned our funds for our activity\u2026.\u201d\u2026Isn\u2019t this solicitng?So the guy who was sent to Garnium by the demons became the head of an organization. And that\u2019s also what they earned their activity funds? What kind of spy was that guy? Was this the medival version of the Beggars\u2019 Sect?Ah.Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.It wasn\u2019t just a chuuni name, but literally described them.They were the abandoned dogs found at the Han river!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15So they were selling gum to people taking a walk by the Han River, or rather the Irene river. I had never seen a nickname so accurate before.Eleris\u2018 lips were trembling, seeming like she also found this quite ridiculous just thinking about it.\u201cThey\u2019re a Lycanthrope.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026If my memory serves me right, isn\u2019t that the one who peridocally turned into a wolf monster?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dTo be honest, not even Eleris, who was a high-ranking vampire, didn\u2019t seem to be in the right condition to be a spy. Although she\u2019s able to walk under the sun, I could definitely see that she was having a hard time.But even so, Eleris was able to withstand sunlight.A Lycanthrope, who would lose their mind and become a monster as soon as the full moon hung in the sky, should act as a spy in the middle of Gardium? How come they hadn\u2019t been caught so far?Sarkegaar was the only one who was cut out to be a spy!\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that a bit disadvantageous for a spy?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. However, we only had few resources\u2026. It seemed like a dangerous mission so there were not many who volunteered, and\u2026.. We were in a hurry, so\u2026\u2026 Yeah.\u201dWere they the type of person who were pretty slow but fiercely loyal?It was infiltrating into the heart of enemy territory after all, so it was no wonder none of the demons stepped forward. However, that Lycanthrope volunteered.\u201cSo on the night of the full moon, it seems like they hide themselves in the sewers beside the Bronzegate Bridge.\u201dThe Bronzegate Bridge.Well.I did say that this place was practically the same as Seoul.If I remembered correctly, then the Brozegate Bridge should be the\u00a0Banpo Bridge.When the day of their transformation neared, they\u2019d go into the sewers under the Banpo Bridge to hide.\u201cLiving close to the Bronzegate Bridge was rather convenient, so they\u2019d rather not go too far from it\u2026. As a result, thier appearance also became quite \u2026 unkept\u2026 There were quite a few passersby who mistook them for a beggar and gave them money\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo that wasn\u2019t their original goal?\u201d\u201cYes. So, thinking what they were doing was right, they just sat there and kept begging.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dDidn\u2019t they have any dignity? Maybe it\u2019s because of the Emperor but the people here were pretty generous.They were a weirdo who I couldn\u2019t decide if they were living thier life comfortably or recklessly. Eleris hesitated and continued her explanation.\u201cAs a result, there were a lot of fights for that position, but as they were born a Lycanthrope while they themselves were a strong person with good fighting skills, it seems like there was no one who could match their fists\u2026. However, there were a lot of beggars there\u2026 so they would always have a drink with the person they fought against yesterday, and then\u2026 They just been hanging out with them and they go closer\u2026 There were just too many, so\u2026.\u201dHaha.They were begging near Banpo Bridge and got into a fight over the position, defeated that guy and the next day the guy who got beaten up came over with a bottle of soju, saying something like \u201cOh yeah, yeah. Yesterday was my bad, right?\u201d, and with this scenario repeating they made a lot of friends while drinking a glass or two. A rather big friend group.It grew to such proportions that it couldn\u2019t be maintained properly so it turned into an organization.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t really know them, but they seem to be like quite the person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026. We also receive a lot of help from them\u2026.\u201dEleris, who seemed to have no business skills at all, and Sarkegaar, who was sure to need a lot of money while living an aristocratic life.Neither of them seemed like they\u2019d be able to survive without the help of Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.\u201cHuh\u2026. But Irene\u2019s Wild Dog\u2026 That\u2019s quite the fitting name.\u201dThey could actually transform into one.\u201cThey actually wanted to be called Irene\u2019s Wolf, but I can understand why no one would want to call them that.\u201dThat was kind of sad.Anyway, that was quite good. I just can\u2019t let Sarkegaar know that I have given up on the Demon Realm and Irene\u2019s Wild Dog seemed like a complete weirdo, but they also seemed to have a sense of camaraderie. They did help the other two spies after all.Eleris didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions to cause me harm at the moment.\u201cSleep. Your Highness. I will arrange a place for you to meet them in the near future.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Don\u2019t you have to sleep as well?\u201dThis was probably Eleris\u2019 bed. She lay down next to me, saying she\u2019d go to sleep as well. No, isn\u2019t it actually kind of weird that a Vampire was sleeping at night\u2026?\u201cAre you okay? If it\u2019s uncomfortable for you, I could also sleep on the floor.\u201d\u201c.\u2026\u2026Uh, um. It\u2019s fine. Yeah.\u201dIt was fine, but at the same time it wasn\u2019t at all.This was a good outcome, but isn\u2019t it also kind of bad?No matter if I got a cheat or not, I wasn\u2019t happy with this in the least.This is life, huh.Cheat, fuck off. No one needs you.And when morning came.-Niaaarck!I woke up to a Vampire screaming at the touch of sun light instead of an alarm clock.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Waking up from that fuss, I stood up and saw Eleris with her hair all frizzy.\u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t you have blackout curtains or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2026. I sleep a lot\u2026. If I don\u2019t do this I wouldn\u2019t be able to get up\u2026.\u201dExplaining as such with a hoarse and cracked voice she went out of the sunlight. I knew that Eleris was a really unusual Vampire, but using the sun as an alarm clock, that wasn\u2019t something easy to imagine. If she couldn\u2019t wake up fast enough, wouldn\u2019t she die?A Vampire who lived in a sunny and well-ventilated place. I knew she was a high-level vampire who just got by, but this was just too sad.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you\u00a0get Count Pontheus to give you a spare room in his house to live in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inefficient for spies to work in the same area. If one gets caught, wouldn\u2019t the other go down as well?\u201dEleris sighed while she changed her clothes.\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t do this in front of me.I was still a 17 year old teenager!\u201cNo, but have you never felt that it was quite unfair that one of you gets to live as an aristocrat?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really like places with a lot of eyes on me. Rather, I think Sarkegaar is living a much harder life.\u201dAh.If one thought of it like that. Sarkegaar probably didn\u2019t have a single moment in which he could relax, right? While Eleris only had one enemy in this place. The sun.\u201cBut if you feel uncomfortable living like this, I think you\u2019d be better off staying in Sarkegaar\u2019s mansion. We don\u2019t even have enough supplies here to live a decent life.\u201dI really didn\u2019t want to say this but\u2026.\u201cBu, but I still want to continue living here\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect the day would come when I\u2019d throw such a childish tantrum again.No.I was sure that Sarkegaar already had his hands full even if I wasn\u2019t trying to mooch off of him.That wasn\u2019t necessarily the only reason.Uh.* * *Insects had different feeding systems for adults and larvae.For example, mosquito larvae lived in water and adult insects flew, so not only did they eat different things they had completely different ecologies. In that way, adult insects and larvae had completely unrelated prey, so they didn\u2019t compete for food with each other.So, right now I was feeling like an insect.It was because of Eleris, who watched me eating breakfast with a look devoid of any appetite. I was wondering if she just enjoyed watching me eat.I was thinking about useless things.\u201cI\u2019m just curious. Do you drink blood every few days?\u201d\u201cEhem\u2026. Well, once a week is enough.\u201d\u201cDoes it have to be human blood?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily, any lifeform with mana in their blood would do.\u00a0 I could use pigs or chickens as well. However, I would need a greater quantity of it. The blood of lower lifeforms contains relatively small amounts of mana.\u201dBlood was blood, but it had to be blood containing a lot of mana. The ones that had blood with a high concentration of mana would be humanoids.But once a week. That energy efficiency was no joke. They were higher life forms compared to humans to begin with. Put into human terms, that meant that one didn\u2019t have to eat for another week after having a bowl of\u00a0ox blood soup.Of course, the type of blood was important.\u201cBy the way, if one were bitten by a vampire, wouldn\u2019t that make one a vampire as well?\u201d\u201cIn the case of wild vampires, there were often such cases where they weren\u2019t able to control themselves, but I\u2019m not like that. As I said, I don\u2019t have a higher rank for nothing.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026. Will the person you suck blood out of die?\u201d\u201cPiling up corpses is never a good thing, you know? I only take enough for myself so they don\u2019t die. Because of that I had to turn a lot of subjects into vampires, but I\u2019m very good at magic. The condition can be controlled to the extent that it wouldn\u2019t impact their lives.\u201dAs expected, Eleris was a peaceful vampire. It seemed like such things as good demons existed, huh.\u201cThen you do it mostly at night\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be night for me to do it. I take it mostly from customers. Well, take it as a slight punishment for those that went out of line\u2026\u201dEleris smiled.When such customers came around, she would probably use some type of fascination magic and take blood from them, huh.\u2026\u2026It was pretty scary now that I thought about it.\u201cMr. Swinton from the store next door usually comes to mess around, so I get to eat deliciously every time. I\u2019m thankful to him. Of course, I can\u2019t do the things he wants me to do with him. He\u2019s married, you know?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. I, is that right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like men who lack fidelity.\u201dHim, being a human wasn\u2019t the problem, huh?It seemed like the nearby merchants had their blood sucked by Eleris without their knowledge. Additionally, they came to this beautiful vampire on their own two feet.She looked nice, but in the end she had a scary side to her.\u201cTalking with you, it seems like you haven\u2019t only lost your memory but a lot of your knowledge as well.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve heard that one usually only loses one\u2019s memory, but in the case of Your Highness\u2026.\u201dEleris tilted her head. She knew that I had amnesia, but it seemed like she felt weird because I lacked even basic common sense demons should have.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve become a completely different person\u2026\u2026 I can feel it.\u201dAh.Did she notice?But come to think of it, yeah.In most possession stories, the main character tries to never reveal that he was actually possessing the body.Why do I have to do that? Why could I not tell the truth? It\u2019s not like I did that on purpose.Rather, Eleris would probably feel relieved if I told her I was really a completely different person.Still.It\u2019s a bit risky to gamble with this before I reached some level of trust with her.\u201cWhat kind of person was I?\u201dSo I asked a question and didn\u2019t give her an answer. I was the master of excuses and spouting bullshit.If the person in charge asked me when I\u2019d sent in the manuscript I\u2019d answer with: \u201cWhy did that bastard ask me for a drink yesterday? If it wasn\u2019t for him, I would have already sent it, but phew, ah, I\u2019m getting pissed off suddenly.\u201dI would keep on sprouting this kind of nonsense.Eleris was about to answer my question, with her arms crossed.\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dThat attitude.A worrying attitude!I kind of got a feeling.That damn game system\u2026.\u201cYo, you\u2026. You weeere\u2026 A great prince. Yes, of course! An i, i, inspiration for all demons\u2026\u2026 You\u2019ve been a role model\u2026 Yes!\u201dWere you trying to spout bullshit just now?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: 16Looking at Eleris pale expression, I got a sense of what the former prince was like.Following this mixed up development, I figured that this guy was quite the jerk.\u201cBy any chance, did you ever have contact with me?\u201dCome to think of it, Eleris was able to recognize me right away. Of course, she might have seen me a few times, as a high-ranking vampire, but then Eleris muttered quietly.\u201cWell, I was your tutor\u2026. So I did.\u201d\u201c\u2026Were we pretty close then?\u201dWeren\u2019t we supposed to be on pretty friendly terms then?\u201cB, but it was only for a short time. My ability was too low to teach Your Highness properly \u2026.\u201dIt seemed like my personality was just too hard to bear with, so she either got fired or quit shortly after.\u201cWell, the past is the past. You have to life in the present, yes.\u201d\u201dEleris seemed to want me to stop being curious about my past. I\u2019m sure I was a total mess, but just to what extent?\u201cWait, so the other spies also know me personally?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026. Yes, definitely. But\u2026.\u201dEleris grabbed my shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re the last Arcdemon. They\u2019ll know what\u2019s important.\u201dWhat.That\u2019s scary.* * *The Demon King died.The Demon World War ended in the Coalition\u2019s victory.Unfortunately, the warriors also fell in battle after a fierce fight with the Demon King and the Four Heavenly Kings.And, the Princess returned safe and sound.Soon, the news was announced.The street was filled with cheering people. The fact that people didn\u2019t have to die in the war with the demons anymore and the survival of the First Princess who was thought to be dead.Not only the Imperial Capital, but the whole continent must have been filled with cheers.\u201cWow, this is good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re just very generous.\u201dEleris and I were walking down the street. I was just eating some chicken skewers that the overjoyed Stall owner said were for free.Now that Eleris cast some magic on me I just looked like an ordinary boy to others. Eleris herself also used camouflage magic on her body.The Victory of the Demon World War made the people of this Gangster filled neighborhood distribute things for free. Eleris didn\u2019t seem to understand how I, who lost everything in a single day, could enjoy some chicken skewers at my own nation\u2018s defeat party. She was glad that the war was over, but why didn\u2019t she look like it?\u201cIf you can\u2019t avoid it, enjoy it.\u201d\u201cAh, that, yes\u2026.\u201dRather, my tension was much higher.Well, it didn\u2019t really have anything to do with me whether the Demon Realm was destroyed or not, right?I was nothing more than a little kid protected by this beautiful vampire.I wanted to live peacefully until the end just like this. Being cared for by someone like Eleris was rather peaceful and comfortable.Of course, I knew best that this was almost impossible.\u201cAre they all there?\u201d\u201cYes, they are waiting for Your Highness.\u201dWe were moving to meet the other remaining demons in Gardium.-Long live the Empire!-Long live Her Highness the Princess!-Long live Artorius!Everyone drunk on the news of the victory, showed off their joy.\u201cHurray!\u201dI also shouted out a hurray, that\u2019s when Eleris finally pulled on my arm.\u201cYour Highness! Restrain yourself!\u201d\u201cWhy? It\u2019s pretty fun!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u2026.\u201dIt was fun acting a bit immature.Of course, when I thought about my actual mental age, deadly humiliation engulfed me internally.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *There were certain things one could only find in the Imperial Capital.One of them is the mana train.So, a fantasy version of a train. They were implemented on a large scale by the Imperial Government, as they couldn\u2019t handle everyone\u2019s transportation needs with just warp gates, bridges and wagons inside the Capital.They were eco-friendly trains, which were powered by this convenient item called mana stone, a staple of the medieval fantasy genre.The comments I received about this were as followed:Isn\u2019t that just ridiculous? Isn\u2019t that much too convenient?I mean, I\u2019m not the only one who wrote about things like these. Lol. I did it anyway lol.If you could make a train, wouldn\u2019t you also be able to make a cellphone?Dunno lolWell, that train was actually moving right in front of my eyes now.The city division was similar to Seoul\u2019s, and, the route map, of course, also aligned with the Seoul subway route map. We had to head south of the Bronzegate Bridge and to do that we headed towards the station to catch a mana train.We first had to head to the station located in the Al Ligar district and take the train to Bronzegate.Simply put, it went from Yongsan Station to the Express Terminal and then to\u00a0Banpo Han River Park. It was so easy to convert. It would have been difficult for me to put my head around this if I came up with some strange map. If I did that, I would have made my life as a writer harder, not that of the readers. I should be able to write comfortably!I was so proud of my lazy former self. If I hadn\u2019t put in this convenient setting of mana stones, I would have had to take a carriage or walked there. That would have been pretty annoying. I didn\u2019t think of the places I put in the novel as these places, but as places in Seoul, that\u2019s how I\u2019d be able to know exactly where they were.In the moving train, Eleris murmured quietly engulfed her robes.\u201cHumans sure are incredible.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThey know how to make things like this.\u201dWere you actually praising me, because I made this basically, you know? Yeah, I\u2019m pretty good. I can\u2019t believe I made this with just a few lines. Maybe I\u2019m a god?In fact, I might have been this world\u2019s god. A stupid one that died of high blood pressure after reading some malicious comments.\u201cHow great would it have been if we created things like these with our excellent magical power instead of powerful destruction magic and war weapons.\u201dEleris murmured in a self-deprecating voice. Certainly, demons seemed to be superior to humans in terms of magic. However, the demons only used magic for destruction rather than for their daily lives.Therefore, even with their awesome power, the Demon Realm looked rather dull, not prosperous at all. There wasn\u2019t really a city around the Demon King\u2019s Castle. It was just a huge fortress that stood alone.However, there were a lot of people living in this human Capital.She might have seen many magical tools that helped them in their everyday lives and magic being used in ways that were beneficial to humans.Did Eleris constantly comparing the barren Demon Realm with this place, while living here?Maybe that was the reason why she felt that the Demon Realm was wrong and backwards.So that was why she ended up hoping for the humans\u2019 victory and not the demons\u2019.I seemed to know what she as thinking to a certain extent.A world where only weapons to kill enemies were made.A world where people were struggling with all their might to make themselves happy.Although Eleris rejoiced about the end of the war and the human\u2019s victory, she was just blankly staring at the joyful sights in front of her not being able to fully be happy about the fall of the Demon Realm.No matter what kind of place one\u2019s home was, even if one didn\u2019t want to go back to it, it would always feel sad having lost one\u2019s place to return to.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The riverside of Irene was well-maintained. The green grass was trimmed well and there were people walking about the well-paved promenade.For ordinary people who couldn\u2019t afford to travel far, the park built along the Irene River was the best picnic spot in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s a place that always lifts my mood when I come here.\u201dEleris wore a soft smile on her lips despite the strong sunlight. Maybe because she liked the scenery. It certainly seemed like Eleris could tolerate sunlight better than I would have assumed.\u201cYeah, it would be even better if this scenery wasn\u2019t right next to it.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. Yes\u2026.\u201dWoah\u2026. Waah\u2026.\u2013 Guweeeeeeek!\u2013 Hey, you bastard! Huh! That son of a bitch, are ya cheatin right now? How did so many 3s come out?! Huh?!-Who\u2019s cheatin? I\u2019ve been livin an honest life! If it\u2019s 3 then it\u2019s 3!Below the Brozegate Bridge.People don\u2019t even dare to go there.Because of the shade the bridge threw, this place was a lot darker and gloomier than other places.A group of beggars were drunk, vomiting, eating, drinking, playing dice and trembling all while the sun was still hanging high up in the sky. Some beggars approached some passers-bys if they got close enough to sell them candy.\u201cSo the cockroaches infesting this peaceful landscape are our allies and main source of income?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. That\u2019s right\u2026.\u201dWhy were you feeling ashamed, when it\u2019s these guys who should?I didn\u2019t even want to get close to them.\u201cHey, young lady, buy some candy from me.\u201dThen a beggar popped out from nowhere and crept towards us, shoving candy in our faces with his dirty hands. It looked like we were also their targets.Eleris sighed and accepted the candy. She didn\u2019t really want to say no.\u201cFive bronze coins.\u201dOne gold coin was 1 million won and one silver coin was 10000 won.A bronze coin was roughly 100 won.That was how I roughly converted them. So 500 won for a candy of that size wasn\u2019t cheap. But was candy even that common in this world? Weren\u2019t you able to obtain carbohydrates anywhere in modern society?However, there was a beggar selling candy. Anyway, let\u2019s just leave it at that. I\u2019ll lose, if I continue thinking about that.Eleris seemed to be contemplating if she should give me that candy she bought for 5 bronze coins, maybe thinking I wouldn\u2019t eat it.\u201cIt\u2019s too dirty for Your Highness to eat.\u201dAfter agonizing about it, Eleris shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m not so picky about these things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI wasn\u2019t particularly craving candy, but I wasn\u2019t such a fussy eater. However, Eleris looked at me slightly surprised as if she didn\u2019t expect me to say something like that. No, that jerk attribute of that former prince was quite something.Was that jerk born to be criticised or something?Will I end up receiving praise like: \u201cEven though you\u2019re breathing, why aren\u2019t you causing any trouble today?\u201d.To begin with, the restraint placed on my being reborn as this jerk actually had some merit. If I were reincarnated into some rising star of the century with tremendous abilities, that would be a huge advantage, but if one didn\u2019t work hard even for a single day they will be questioned saying things like one changed in a bad way.A bastard that gets complimented just by breathing vs. a genius that gets scolded just by breathing.The former was overwhelmingly good. Being reincarnated into a person who had already been perceived as negative throughout the world would be great for pretending to be weak.If I were the former prince would I have felt offended just by being approached by a beggar?\u201cThen would you like to eat it?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI peeled the wrapper off of the candy I got from Eleris and put it in my mouth. It just tasted sweet with no flavor.\u201cDid I like sweets?\u201d\u201cI remember you did.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI don\u2019t like sweets though.However, it seemed like being young had its advantages. The beggar who approached us was approaching others now. Most of the time, it felt more like people wanted to get rid of the beggar than honestly wanting to buy these candies.It was a disgusting sight, but I was told that that was how they funded their activities.No, I still didn\u2019t like looking at it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17There was a good reason behind why we chose this place to meet up.Count Pontheus had servants who had no idea that he was a demon, there were also influential people coming to his mansion, as he was a noble. Eleris\u2019 shop and it\u2019s second story were a little too small for the four of us.The base of Irene\u2019s wild dog was a place avoided by all and swarming with beggars. I was told there were also quite the number of secret spaces. Eleris passed through the mess of beggars affected by hallucination magic. Even while we were passing right by the beggars they didn\u2019t notice our presence.There was a dark tunnel right under the bridge. This place seemed to be their real base.I was told that it originally served as a type of drainage channel that would lead the city\u2019s rain water to Irene when it rained. As this place wasn\u2019t really visited by people, it also served as Irene\u2019s Wild Dog\u2019s hide out when they turn into a Lycanthrope.There were beggars lying around and sleeping inside. There were blankets, mops and roughly built shacks.It really was a beggar colony.As we went even deeper inside, eventually even the shacks disappeared from our sight. As we entered the endless sewers, we saw a small light in the distance.Someone was sitting in front of a lit bonfire. Even though they were just the leader of some beggars, they still were a king in a way, however, they didn\u2019t seem like they had anything special around him.They were just like a dog basking in the fire\u2019s warmth.There was a person wearing a ripped shirt and tattered trousers, with thick gray hair on their head tied in random ways.Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.\u201cYou\u2019re here, my lord.\u201dCome to think of it, I was never told that the dog was a man..* * *The King of Beggars.Irene\u2019s Wild Dog.The Leader of a Gang.\u201cLoyar greets His Highness the Prince.\u201dShe knelt down in front of me as soon as she saw me. That Wild Dog\u2019s real name was Loyar and as far as I knew she was a wolf-type Lycanthrope.\u201c\u2026Yes, nice to see you. Although it\u2019s in a place like this.\u201dWe were inside Gardium, but here we were meeting up in the sewers.\u201cIs Sarkegaar still over there?\u201dLoyar nodded at Eleris\u2019 words.\u201cAll the nobles must be busy. There\u2019s going to be a victory celebration and stuff. He\u2019ll be here soon, though. This is a lot more important to us.\u201dEleris was a pacifist, however she was still surprised that I was still alive, Loyar on the other hand didn\u2019t really have any big reaction. How should I put it, it felt like she didn\u2019t really care much about all this?\u201cLoyar, I\u2019m telling you in advance, but he lost all his memories. Except for who he was\u2026 He doesn\u2019t remember almost anything.\u201dAt those words, Loyar stared at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026For real?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah\u2026\u2026It somehow turned out like that.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dHer gaze was a bit uncomfortable.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d\u201c..\u2026You\u2019re happy about that?\u201d\u201cYeah, because you\u2019d tell me stuff like I should lie down with my stomach exposed, saying that dogs should behave like dogs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I, I did?\u201d\u201cYeah. You\u2019d even put me on a leash sometimes.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dLoyar opened her mouth as she thought about those times. Oh no, you\u2019re telling me I treated Lycanthropes like some sorts of pets? Eleris\u2019 mouth twitched as she was smiling half-heartedly.\u201cLo, Loyar\u2026. As far as I can remember, you kind of liked that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen did I ever?!\u201dLoyar\u2019s face turned red. What the hell were you talking about? Did I really treat a Lycanthrope who changes into a wolf every full moon as a common dog?Was she like my pet or something?\u201cTha, that\u2026.\u00a0 I can\u2019t really remember, but I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine.\u201dYour expression didn\u2019t look fine at all though. If I were in her shoes I would have really hated being treated like that.Come to think of it, I was told she volunteered for this spy mission even though she was a Lycanthrope.Could it be she was forced to volunteer to get away from me? Come to think of it, that was pretty plausible. I managed to somehow escape and come here alive, but could I trust her?\u201cWe, well\u2026. I can\u2019t erase my past actions, but I\u2019m\u2026. sorry. Let\u2019s try to get along from now on.\u201dI reached out my hand to her, showing her that I meant no harm.-Pat\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI meant to shake her hand.However, she just put her hand on mine. She didn\u2019t grasp it; she just put her hand on top of mine.\u201c!\u201dAs soon as she realized what she did, Loyar was startled and then lowered her hand to hold mine.Wasn\u2019t that\u2026\u2026Did she just do \u2018Give paw\u2019?\u201cGive paw.\u201d\u2013 PatThe moment I put out my palm, Loyar put her hand on my hand. She did it without realizing it and immediately pulled it back.\u201cY, your Highness\u2026. Why am I doing that?\u201dLoyar said so in cold sweat.The speechless Eleris also added some words.\u201cIt\u2019s like the body is reacting on its own without the head telling it to.\u201d\u201cO, oh, no!\u201d\u201cYour Highness. How about you try telling her to lie down and show you her stomach?\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cShe going to flip over. Try it.\u201d\u201cN, no! Why would I do that!\u201dI couldn\u2019t get myself to do that in the end. She\u2019d probably really do it.Why was she trained so well?How often did I bully you like this in the past? Rather, it was already on the level that her body reacted instinctively.I\u2019m afraid she\u2019d really sit if I tell her to sit.\u201cUhm, erm. Sorry, I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026.\u201dEven though her heart doesn\u2019t like me, her body was that of a loyal dog. Thinking that I put my worries about Loyar aside. I sat down besides the fire. When Sarkegaar arrived we could start talking about the details.I felt something approaching from afar. There was a sound echoing through the sewers.\u2013 Uooooooooaaaaah!I couldn\u2019t even see his face yet, but I was already convinced that he\u2019ll be the troublesome type.Just like I expected.When Sarkegaar arrived, he hugged me and began to wail loudly.\u2018Oh my goodness! For those wretched humaaaans to kill His Majesty the Great Demon King! They must have used some cowardly tricks! What are we going to do about this? What are we to doooo? But seeing that Your Highness is still safe, there\u2019s still a ray of hope left for the people of the Demon Realm. What a miracle! Wooaaaah! Please quickly grow up and rebuild the Demon Realm stronger than it was before and erase all traces of these filthy human beiiiiiings!\u2018..He roughly kept on mumbling and crying loudly for about 10 minutes.He started crying even louder when I told him that I had lost my memories. No, I thought I was some kind of super jerk? Why was he so sad?Ah.Seeing how he was acting right now, it seems like even the former prince, who was indeed a jerk, avoided him.His voice was so loud that it made the entire sewer tremble. It was so loud that Eleris was forced to cast noise suppression magic around us.\u201cKuhuk\u2026.Sniff\u2026. Buhuuhuk\u2026.\u201dEven I, who didn\u2019t think much about his crying before, was almost brought to tears. No, well, maybe I was the type that would start crying as well if I saw someone crying in front of me.No, that\u2019s also not it. This guy was crying so sadly.What\u2019s with this?Anyway, Sarkegaar was a loyalist almost to the point of insanity.Sarkegaar continued to sniffle for a while, making snorting noises. I felt like he was going to run out of breath, so I felt like I had to somehow comfort him.\u201cWhy\u2019s such a grown-up Fiend crying like that? Huh? It\u2019s like you lost your country.\u201dCome to think of it, we really lost our country. Looks like that idiom became reality now.Sakegaar looked up at me, at my words.\u201cI see! You\u2019re right! Demons are still alive, so the Demon Realm has yet to die as well! What disloyalty I committed! The Demon Realm is still alive and well! Please punish meeeeeee!\u201dThat guy twisted my words weirdly, making his own determination flare up even more.Loyar and Eleris were looking at me as if they were trying to apologize for being helpless in this situation.They seemed to be tired of Sarkegaar\u2019s antics as well. After barely calming him down, we all sat down around the bonfire.What a perfect meeting place for a prince and servants of a fallen kingdom. Sarkegaar was looking at me with a firm expression.\u201cYou must rebuild the Demon Realm.\u201dEleris stared at me. She seemed to want to remind me about our previous conversation about moderately playing along.\u201cAh, uhm\u2026. Well. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAnd to take revenge for the previous King, we have to build an even stronger and more powerful nation than ever before\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, you bastard! If you keep on sticking to these unfruitful rhetorics I\u2019ll rip out your tongue!\u201dLoyar shouted.Yes, even in novels, if a character keeps on talking about similar things, the author will get cursed out for inflating the length of the chapter. Sarkegaar also fake coughed as if preparing to continue on with the third verse.\u201cEhem. My apologies, Your Highness. It\u2019s just when I heard the news that His Majesty the Demon King had passed away, it seemed like the whole world was coming to an end \u2026.\u201d\u201cAlright. I got it.\u201dIt seemed like he was the type of person who\u2019d finish what he wanted to say no matter what.Hearing the news of the Demon Realm\u2019s defeat must have felt like the sky was collapsing above him. However, since I was still alive, I was his last hope, hence reigniting his fighting spirit.\u201cRebuilding the Demon Realm, huh. That\u2019s good and all, but there are only the four of us and I\u2019m still some useless, incompetent kid.\u201d\u201cCalling yourself as such is an unfair thing to say! Your Highness\u2019 bloodline is the most noble! You are the only Arcdemon left in this world!-\u201d\u201cYeah, so that\u2019s it.\u201dI cut off Sarkegaar\u2019s muffled words.\u201cJust what the hell is an Arcdemon?\u201dJust what was an Arcdemon, for them\u00a0 to not even think of finding a new Demon King and simply clung to me?I had no idea about that yet.Everyone was looking at me with puzzlement apparent on their faces.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: 18Chapter\u00a018e Demon King acted as an\u00a0emulsifier between water and oil.A being that made things that weren\u2019t able to mix together, mix together.\u201c\u2026Then there\u2019s one more question I have.\u201d\u201cYes. go ahead.\u201d\u201cWhy did the Demon World War happen?\u201dI just wrote down that there was a war, but not why the Demon World War happened. Humans tried to vanquish the demons. that\u2019s what I wrote. So this was supposed to be the first invasion from the human\u2019s side.Eleris looked into the bonfire, saying:\u201cThe humans have always been afraid of the unification of the Demon Realm.\u201dThe probability of the event that I hadn\u2019t properly set had been fixed. It was quite bizarre to experience my messed up probabilities getting fixed like that.Humans had invaded the Demon Realm.Since I didn\u2019t state the reason for it, the world supplemented the possibility that humans feared the Demon Realm\u2019s unification and the setting of the Arcdemons. I had that strange feeling of guilt creep up inside of me, as this felt like someone else filled the holes I created while messing around.The demons of the Darkland began to form a society. Even the humans, who had been fighting among themselves had no choice but to be alert of that situation.\u201cThe previous Demon Kings were aware of the fact that the humans would one day start to invade the Demon Realm. That\u2019s why the Demon Realm was continuously preparing for war.\u201dI nodded at Eleris words. Even if they don\u2019t intend to invade each other, if they see the other side increase their arms the other side would do the same.\u2018Don\u2019t get us wrong, we were just increasing our military to defend against a possible attack from you.\u2019Of course, no one would believe that bullshit.It was common for fights to happen because they feared each other.So, even though the Demon Realm and the Human Realm didn\u2019t have any intentions of attacking each other, they were preparing to attack each other, just because the other side existed.It didn\u2019t matter who started it. A war would eventually break out no matter what.The Demon Realm had the Demon King, but the Human Realm also had mighty forces, the Warriors. The warriors succeeded in taking down the Demon King with them.The death of the Demon King was on a completely different level than the death of a human king. So, the mere fact that the Demon King was dead would have completely destroyed the morale of many of the King\u2019s soldiers.In fact, the Demon King was comparable to a God in the Demon Realm.This explanation alone was enough for me to understand the importance of Arcdemons.\u201cYes\u2026. I can see now why Arcdemons are important.\u201dNow I knew why it had to be me.\u201cThen what should I do from now on? Have you thought about that yet?\u201d\u201cYou have to build your strength. Also, Gardium is much too dangerous. We have to return to the Demon Realm, gather the scattered demons and reestablish your power, while you must continue your training.\u201dOf course, if I returned to the Demon Realm, I would be welcomed by the demons who still remembered the Demon King, and it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult to gather some forces.The Darklands were vast, and even if the Demon King died, it was impossible for the humans to devour everything. I shook my head at Sarkegaar\u2019s words.\u201cToo dangerous. The humans can\u2019t occupy all of the Darklands, but they wouldn\u2019t neglect their surveillance. If a new demonic force were to emerge, they would immediately launch another attack.\u201dThey wouldn\u2019t just calmly sit by as we reconstruct the Demon Realm they just destroyed. If they noticed any sign of suspicious behavior, they would make a game of killing us all off.And above all, I just said that to go along with their words, because I had no intentions of rebuilding the Demon Realm and going to war again, you know? I was told that the demons would split up again without me, but, to be honest, that would happen in the distant future. It wasn\u2019t like it was happening now.And\u2026 There was another point that wasn\u2019t as important.\u201cI think going back to the Demon Realm would be a bad idea.\u201dSarkegaar\u2019s eyes lit up at my words, as if he just got an idea. I didn\u2019t want to go back to the Demon Realm in the first place. I sure didn\u2019t like it there.I wanted to stay in Gardium for now. The city was pretty nice.I didn\u2019t want to live in a place without trains!\u201cThis is the heart of the enemy territory. To defeat the enemy, one must know the enemy. Rather, we need to learn the ways of humans here.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard for me to come up with some reason, as I was the master of finding excuses.\u201cOoh, you\u2019re definitely the ideal prince. That boldness and courage to strike right at the enemy\u2019s heart! A King\u2019s virtue worthy of imitatiooooon!\u201dNo, I just wanted to live close to the station, you know?There was also Eleris, so there shouldn\u2019t be chance of being discovered by humans while living here. The probability of getting caught should have been significantly lowered.There was no reason for me to leave Gardium. This was the best city to live in on the entire continent, and I didn\u2019t want to leave even if I were to die, unless there was a chance that I would be discovered to be a demon.I just wanted to while away my time here until the ending. It wasn\u2019t good for me to mess with the story any more, and the ending would come closer and closer as the years passed by while being cared for by Eleris.There weren\u2019t any specific conditions that I had to be active, right? Right?Did my excuses work too well? He almost cried at my kind of plausible excuse, believing that I would really be able to defeat our enemy by learning their ways.He seemed to admire my boldness and courage.\u201cYour Highness. If that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been thinking, then I have an even better idea.\u201d\u201c.\u2026A better idea?\u201dNo, I don\u2019t know what it is, but I\u2019m 100% sure it wouldn\u2019t be any good for me.\u201cOnly by knowing the humans\u2019 way would we be able to bring them down! I admire your wisdom!\u201dNo.What are you going to say?\u201cBy entering \u2018Temple\u2019 you would be able to thoroughly learn the humans\u2019 ways! Defeating them with their own weapons would only be true revenge!\u201d\u201dOh.What\u2019s that nonsense?Loyar nodded her head at Sarkegaar\u2019s words.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a bad idea.\u201d\u201cHu, huh?\u201d\u201cThe Temple is the cradle of not only the Empire\u2019s, but also almost all of the human race\u2019s children. When you grow up, you\u2019d know all the people who hold important positions in human society. If you were to fight the Empire, you\u2019d know better than anyone else who your enemies are and their way of thinking. Or you might be able to subdue them. You would destroy the Empire from within.\u201dNo, wait.What?I had no intentions of interfering with the main story. However, Loyar looked at Sarkegaar seemingly agreeing with him as if what he said was something good for once.Sarkegaar added.\u201cAdditionally, Temple is currently nurturing young talents with great power. They aim to nurture talents like the Warrior Artorius. I\u2019m certain it would be of great help to us, knowing what sprouts they are raising and we might be able to remove the too dangerous talents at their roots before they grow.\u201dYes. Temple was also an institution that nurtured talented people who would eventually become powerful forces. Even in that kind of place, there was a type of special calss that nurtured talented people who could succeed the Hero Artorius and his party, and yes, that was where the main characters were.However, there was no reason for me to go there. What the hell was I supposed to do there?I was going crazy.I started to get shoved into the story just because I said the wrong words.Eleris!Help me!You don\u2019t want me to turn into a war weapon, right?!Eleris just smiled at me when she noticed me looking at her with pleading eyes.\u201cI also think that that\u2019s a good idea, Your Highness.\u201dWhat was she on about? Wouldn\u2019t she normally disagree? It was hard to understand why Eleris, who should be opposed to Sarkegaar\u2019s ideas, agreed.\u201cNow, just wait a second\u2026.\u201dI tried hard to come up with an excuse to avoid this strange development all three agreed to.\u201cNo matter how much we can hide our appearances with magic, there will probably be wizards at Temple, don\u2019t you know what would happen then? It would definitely be dangerous if my identity got revealed.\u201dDid these idiots want to kill me?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness.\u201dWith a smile Sarkegaar took off a ring from his finger.\u201cThis is a ring that gets passed down from generation to generation in my clan.\u201d\u201cWell, what about it?\u201d\u201cJust by wearing this ring, you\u2019d be able to use my clan\u2019s power.\u201dWhat?Why would you have such a thing? Why would such a thing appear so conveniently at a time like this? Huh? This was so unbelievable, honestly. Why the hell would these polymorphic bastards pass down a ring capable of granting the ability to polymorph from generation to generation?That would be completely useless to them!Wasn\u2019t this just some random setup for this moment?![Do you find it weird to find such an improbable development happening in this novel suddenly?][Idiot.]I felt like something just went by my vision. I didn\u2019t see it properly.What was that?\u201cThat, that, how could I accept such an important ring that got passed down for such a long time?\u00a0 It, uh, must be very precious to you. Like a memento of your parents. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dI gradually ran out of excuses.\u201cJust what are mementos in the face of your great mission of rebuilding the Demon Realm! Please take it, Your Highness!\u201dSarkegaar\u00a0 pushed the ring towards me while shouting out his determination.\u201cA strong and prosperous nation is almost in our graaaaasp!\u201dI fell victim to my own excuses.Anyway, it was pretty obvious.That person who sent me here didn\u2019t seem to want me to calmly get to the end.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: 19The plan of my admission to Temple had been decided.Yes, obviously, I absolutely wouldn\u2019t get caught with that ring on. This wasn\u2019t on the level of illusion magic, this completely reconstructed my body.I wondered since Polymorph could reconstruct one\u2019s physical body, woudn\u2019t it be possible to improve one\u2019s physical specs as well?If I were to change my body to look like someone who\u2019d have 99 points in strength, wouldn\u2019t I get stronger as well?When I asked this, Loyar told me, strangely seriously:\u201c\u2026.\u2026Polymorph of that level would only be possible for someone with the same amount of mana a dragon would have.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t Arcdemons kind of like dragons?\u201d\u201cDragons are illusory monsters. Could there ever be a being in this world which could use magic without even properly casting?\u201dWhat a sad excuse of a legend.I didn\u2019t believe in legends, they were on the same level as lies.\u201cWhat you\u2019re using isn\u2019t actually Polymorph. This is just the version our clan makes use of, so you must get stronger yourself. Strength obtained through transformation, wouldn\u2019t be your own strength. You should not rely on such cheap tricks.\u201dI\u2019m oh so glad that you confirmed that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use such a cheat ever. Anyway, because I gained the ability of the Dreadfiend clan, I was able to completely transform, not only disguise myself.\u201cBy the way, I have a question.\u201dOf course, I knew that making myself look muscular by using polymorph wouldn\u2019t really make me muscular.\u201cFor example, is there a limit to how dense I could make my hair?\u201d\u201cYes? What do you mean?\u201dSarkegaar didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was talking about.However, I was serious.\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019ve got hair loss, could I just transform myself into a from with a full head of hair? Well, that\u2019s what I was talking about.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a matter of course? That\u2019s not such a big deal.\u201dAh.\u201cSarkegaar! You\u2019re history\u2019s greatest loyalist. Of course! Of course!\u201dYou\u2019re such a nice guy.I couldn\u2019t hold in my passion and hugged him.I held the Eternal Anti Hair Loss Ring in my hands!\u201cIf you wish I shall even give you my liiiiiife!\u201dLoyar and Eleris stared bankly as\u00a0 Sarkegaar and I hugged fiercely.* * *Gardias Temple.The main stage of the original story.Frankly, there was no reason not to go there. As Sarkegaar helped me concealing my identity, I\u2019d be fine. Even if I didn\u2019t intervene, the story would just proceed on its own, going straight for the set ending.In other words, the less involved I was, the better.However, just by intervening slightly, variables would appear. The story already changed a lot because Charlotte de Gardias survived.I didn\u2019t want to get too involved in a story that already had a predetermined ending.Also.There really was no need for me to go to school with all these kids. So why did I have to do it?However, once Sarkegaar would find out that I had no intentions of rebuilding the Demon Realm, I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. As for Loyar, I wasn\u2019t so sure what she was thinking, but Sarkegaar definitely was loyalist, but in the end, he probably was the most dangerous person to me.In the end, Sarkegaar seemed to want me to grow stronger.Frankly speaking, I was neither suited for fighting nor was it my hobby. Just like everyone doesn\u2019t want to suffer pain, I felt like I wanted to escape to a place where my survival and well-being were guaranteed.However, in the end, whether or not I went to Temple, I had to somehow get stronger myself.In order to someday be able to escape Sarkegaar\u2019s clutches, I needed to have a certain amount of strength. It didn\u2019t matter if I was standing on Eleris\u2019 side or Sarkegaar\u2019s side.I would have to enter the Gardias Temple.\u201cBut how?\u201d\u201cIf I took you as my adopted son, you would be able to enter Temple.\u201dUsing the position of Count Pontheus, he could take me in as his adopted son, enabling me to enter Temple like that.I\u2019d also become the son of a noble, so would I be able to live a more comfortable life then?\u201cThat\u2019s too dangerous.\u201dHowever, Eleris shook her head. As if not understanding, Sarkegaar frowned.\u201cWhat are you saying, Eleris?\u201d\u201cSarkegaar, you were the one who personally kidnapped the princess. Now that she has returned, they will restart the investigation of how the princess\u2019 abduction was carried out. They have the princess as witness after all. There\u2019s a chance that they\u2019ll catch your tail.\u201d\u201cI left no traces.\u201d\u201cThink of it as just a precaution.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201dA second investigation into the princess\u2019 abduction could draw suspicion to Sarkegaar. It was really just a precaution, but Eleris seemed to think that there was no need to take useless risks.That was how I thought it was.\u201cThen, as expected, Eleris would be best to be my guardian\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dI thought she\u2019d obviously take on that role, but Eleris just shook her head.\u201cI am a Vampire. If it\u2019s discovered that I\u2019m a vampire, I\u2019m sure Your Highness of whom I was taking care of would also fall under suspicion. I\u2019m always careful with everything I do, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen.\u201dAlthough Eleris was well integrated into human society, she always kept the possibility of being discovered to be a vampire in mind.\u201cWhat? How could I get into Temple if neither Sarkegaar nor Eleris are able to be my guardians?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201dEleris pointed at the last person present as if it was obvious.\u201c\u2026What? Me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYou want the beggar king to be my guardian?What the hell was this nonsense? Both I and Loyar were dumbfounded, but Eleris shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m just telling you, but it would be most beneficial for you to just be born as an orphan.\u201dI understood what she meant.\u201cIf you were adopted by Sarkegaar, you might be in danger if his deeds were discovered, and if you were to choose me as your guardian, you might be in danger if my true identity were discovered.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know what you mean, even if I\u2019m caught, my gang members don\u2019t know that I\u2019m a Lycanthrope, so he could just say that he didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s it, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe members of Loyar\u2019s pack didn\u2019t know that she was a Lycanthrope. So even if Loyar were to be discovered, even if they were questioned most of them wouldn\u2019t know a thing. There were a lot of members after all.In addition, there was a high possibility that I would not be connected to my collaborators even if they were discovered if I entered Temple as an orphan with no ties.Yeah, Eleris was right.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, you want me to live here from now on?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe Your Highness has to live in such a filthy place! That\u2019s just unreasonableeeeeeee!\u201d\u201cDid you just call my place flithy? Are ya trying to insult me?\u201dA fire blazed in Loyar\u2019s eyes.\u201cYa want to let me know how it feels like to buy some bread from your own money starting today? Huh?\u201d\u201cN, no. I, I , I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026\u2026 The, there\u2019s just a bit of\u2026 You know?\u00a0 I mean, see\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that a little too much, huh? Hey, if I\u2019m gonna sponsor such a great VIP, d\u2019ya have any idea what the fuck my kids are supposed to do?\u201dLoyar was their financier.So, she actually had the greatest say here.Loyar threatened Sarkegaar with overwhelming force, and Sarkegaar\u2019s face turned completely blue as soon as he heard that she would stop giving him money.Eleris sighed watching those two fight.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to live here. If you enter Temple, you\u2019ll be able to live in the dormitories. You just need to spend a few days here.\u201dShe gave me a kind of look that seemed to say: \u201cHow could I let you live in such a dirty place?\u201d.Well, I didn\u2019t really mean to become something as grandiose as a noble\u2019s son, but\u2026.When I went to school, won\u2019t the other kids make fun of me for being a beggar? Mentally I was over 30, but no matter how old I\u2019m on the inside\u2026.No, I was just saying if these little punks find out that I made my living by begging at my age, won\u2019t they hit me or something?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dStill, I couldn\u2019t come up with a safer idea than Eleris\u2019 suggestion.Just a few days, a few days\u2026.I have to live a few days in this place\u2026.When I asked her if I had to stay a few days here, Eleris told me that I had to.I was an orphan and didn\u2019t even have a proper identity. It seemed that in order to obtain a new identity, I had to somehow prove that I\u2019m an orphan, and to prove that, I had to get the testimony of Loyar\u2019s group.I couldn\u2019t believe I had to acquire a new identity through the beggars\u2019 guarantees. What\u2019s with this?\u201cThere are many of my little brothers who don\u2019t really exist on paper, so I know what to do, because some of the guys do end up needing an ID.\u201dIt was natural for her to call them little brothers as she\u2019s the head of this organization, so to speak, but it still was strange hearing it come out of her mouth.I couldn\u2019t believe a Lycanthrope being brothers with humans. Was this a live-action version of\u00a0Tiger Brother? So would this Wild Dog also become my brother? No, rather my sister.Sarkegaar\u2019s words angered Loyar, but she seemed to think that staying in this environment for a long time would be a bad thing for me as well.\u201cEleris will come up with the right excuse, so we can just do it like that.\u201dLoyar seemed carefree. Eleris contemplated how she should get me out of here as soon as possible and admit me to Temple.* * *Sarkegaar and Eleris went back, leaving me and Loyar behind. I had already been told what to do. Loyar told me not to worry as no one would touch me anyway, but that wasn\u2019t really the problem\u2026.There\u2019s nothing that can be solved easily.I don\u2019t really want to go to Temple, but now I had to go while wearing an identity given to me by a beggars\u2019 group. This made me want to go even less. But what could I do? This was the safest way.Loyar dragged me out of the deep parts of the sewers and took me to the shantytown.-Whistle!As Loyar whistled, all the beggars that were scattered all over the place slowly started to gather in one place. Everyone was limping, but they seemed to listen well.This must\u2019ve been the dark side of Gardium.\u201cBig sis, what\u2019s with that kid?\u201dIf it were Eleris or Sarkegaar they would have been furious at his words, but Loyar didn\u2019t show much of a reaction. She wasn\u2019t loyal in mind, but very loyal in body. She was that kind of bizarre being.\u201cHe\u2019s a new member. He\u2019s called Reinhardt.\u201dThis was a new name, not my real name which was Valier.Reinhardt.No, I mean Valier wasn\u2019t actually my real name either, right?Anyway, it was an alias, an alias. Nothing more.Sarkegaar suggested it.He told me I should choose another name, not Valier, as my alias, so he asked me for my opinion.Ooh.I had some in mind.\u2018Gromm Hellscream.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Hellscream? Isn\u2019t that name just too creepy?\u2019The first suggestion got cut down by Eleris.\u201aThen Lich King?\u2018\u2018What perfection! What a fitting name for a great Demon Kiiiiiiiiiiiiing! If it\u2019s Your Highness, you would certainly far surpass the magical capabilities of a lich!\u2019\u2018Your Highness, your real name would be much more inconspicuous compared to that.\u2018Sarkegaar agreed to it, but Loyar refused. She said something like: \u201cif you\u2019ll choose such an ugly name, you\u2019d be better off just using your real name.\u201d.Well this name was the equivalent of Kim Eum Doom in Korean.\u2018Then\u00a0Thrall.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Your Highness, we can\u2019t possible use a weird joke like that.\u2019Eleris quite seriously thought Thrall was a pun on \u2018Damn it\u2019. (T/N: Korean writing for Thrall =ssral, Damn it = jae gi ral or also written as X-ral (ekssral)Don\u2019t you know the Warcraft series?!Eventually, after arguing for a long time, we were able to decide on something.\u2018How about Reinhardt?\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2026Oddly enough, it\u2019s a very main character-like name, but\u2026..\u2019\u2018I think it\u2019s a better name than Hellscream.\u2019\u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt to add a few more syllables. A King\u2019s name can\u2019t be too simple\u2026.\u2019\u2018If it\u2019s even longer than that it would be a pain to say. I also don\u2019t want to be mistaken as a noble or something.\u2019That\u2019s how it got decided. It wasn\u2019t particularly flashy, nor was it something weird. It was just a name.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20At Loyar\u2019s announcement, a sloppy but strong looking guy, who probably was the second-in-command here, chimed in.\u201cBig sis, where should we put \u2018im?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t make him do anything.\u201dLoyar shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m gonna sent him to Temple.\u201dAt those words, the beggars made rather strange expressions.\u201cDid ya eat something wrong?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dOne of the beggars who said something along those lines slightly shrank back, when Loyar raised one of her eyebrows as if they were talking bullshit.\u201cNo, why didja suddenly accept dis kid when you stubbornly refused to let any in before, cause they dun even know anythin? And Temple?\u201dThere certainly weren\u2019t any children my age in Loyar\u2019s beggar group. Teenagers who derailed and ran away from home definitely were as hard to control as rabid dogs. So, it was quite natural that they asked something like that. Loyar shook her head.\u201cThis guy\u2019s our future.\u201dIt felt weird suddenly becoming a bunch of beggars\u2019 future.Maybe I\u2019ve actually become the future of these guys to a certain extent.Everyone\u2019s expressions showed more and more confusion. Loyar looked at the beggars, who were thoroughly dumbfounded and placed her hands on her hips.The King of Beggars began her speech.\u201cAs y\u2019all know, we have nothing and we don\u2019t know anything. Ain\u2019t that right? Some of ya keep talking about the good old times where y\u2019all were great, but look at ya now? Left to rot in some gutter. That\u2019s why we got together like this. So that the ones who don\u2019t exist can also live their lives.\u201d\u201cBut how long d\u2019ya plan to live like that? I don\u2019t care if it just were me, but you guys don\u2019t want to live like this, right? Ya want to get out of this life, right?\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s too late for us to learn anything new. So through our power\u2026. Our, money. Yes, using our capital, we will nurture talented people who\u2019d be responsible for this gang\u2019s future.\u201dThinking what she said was quite plausible, Loyar seemed content. Somehow, this is the first time I\u2019ve witnessed such charisma in any of my lives.I instructed Loyar to briefly explain this as a strategy to nurture talent for the future of the gang and to first heavily focus their capital into one talent with the goal of optimizing the situation of all the beggars here.One of the beggars titlted their head at Loyar\u2019s proud declaration.\u201cBig sis, I dun think sending some guys to Temple would suddenly make us sleep on feather cushions, though?\u201dA valid concern.Of course, Eleris and I came up with a lot of excuses to deal with this situation.\u201cIf I say it\u2019s like that, then it is like that. You bastards!\u201dHowever, Loyar just shouted at them, not tolerating any protests.\u201cIf that\u2019s what the boss said.\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201dAnd everyone accepted that one sentence rather than millions of excuses.That was a boss for you.However, would it be worse to be found out to be a demon or the heir of a beggar organization?Aren\u2019t they both pretty dog-like existences?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Strictly speaking, Loyar\u2019s words weren\u2019t just cheap excuses. Everyone was just convinced by the feeling that whatever Loyar told them, they had to do. It was that kind of attitude. Perhaps, this wasn\u2019t the first time that Loyar made them do something absurd.Loyar took me to a rather big shack, and brought someone else with her.A man of strong stature. He was the one who looked like the second-in-command from earlier. Loyar introduced me to this man.Since Loyar was the boss around here, he promised me to treat me comfortably.\u201cSay hi to each other. This is our gang\u2019s future. Reinhardt. Reinhardt, this is my most trusted younger brother, so you can trust him, too. His name is Daibun.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Reinhardt, I\u2019m Daibun.\u201dHe was the younger brother favored by a Lycanthrope.Was this a friendship that transcended race? It wasn\u2019t even 1%, it was friendship with a few decimal places between them. (T/N: as in their positions)\u201cI\u2019m Reinhardt.\u201dI shook hands with him. His hand was as large as a pot lid. Rather than a beggar, he looked more like a retired soldier in a slightly shabby outfit. He gave of a rugged impression.Perhaps because he trusted Loyar just that much, but he didn\u2019t question or ask anything about this stranger that appeared out of nowhere she suddenly offered to send to Temple.\u201cTake \u2018im to get an ID tomorrow. If you got time, swing by Temple.\u201d\u201cYes, big sis.\u201dThe three of us just sat around for now. It was messy, but it was worlds apart from that hallway inside the Demon King\u2019s Castle littered with corpses. This place was only dirty, so this was a literal heaven compared to that.I thought about the worst case scenario and affirmed my present situation. Although it was a bit uncomfortable, it could be worse. Then Daibun spoke up hesitantly as he looked at Loyar.\u201cBig sis, what are you gonna do about the tuition? I\u2019m not really sure, but ain\u2019t Temple for noble children? I heard it costs a lot of money.\u201dIt was a problem we were already aware of. We made the decision I\u2019d go, but didn\u2019t even have a way to solve the most important problem. It wasn\u2019t about getting detected, but getting enough money.For that reason, there were doubts whether it would be possible for Loyar to continue paying tuition for Temple.The Gardias Temple was the most famous educational institution on the continent. Not only members of the Empire but also members of leading families from all over the continent often came to study abroad there.Because of that the tuition was extremely high. The Temple itself was an educational institute, but it was also the place that gave the Empire the most revenue. Just by getting admitted to Temple one would be able to build connections with a lot of influential people. Nobles didn\u2019t hesitate to pay a lot of money just to send their children to Temple.However, it was doubtful that this beggars\u2019 organization could admit me to Temple and continue to support me by paying that sinfully high tuition fee. I already had a contingency plan though.Temple\u2019s tuition fee varied depending on the grade and major, however, ordinary students required to pay 50 gold per semester. About 50 million won. That was equivalent to 100 million a year. In addition, tuition wildly varied depending on the major.\u2018First of all, you only have to provide the tuition fee for a certain period of time.\u2019\u2018Are you thinking of going for a scholarship?\u2019Of course, I probably was smarter than the average kid, but honestly, there were definitely plenty of kids smarter than me in that place.However, that wasn\u2019t what was important.\u2018The Empire wants a second and third Artorius. So what if one definitely had the talent, but didn\u2019t have the money to get an education at Temple? In that case, the tuition will be waived!\u2019It sounded like I was guessing, but that\u2019s what would happen. Students with outstanding talents, but with limited financial power, were specially managed within Temple. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t make you pay the huge amount of tuition fees.I was an Arcdemon. There should be something I could do.\u2018Once I enter the school and get some education, I should be able to find something I\u2019m talented in.\u2019After that tuition would be waived. This isn\u2019t just nonsense as well, because I could make a talent bloom with my achievement points. It might not be possible at the moment, but there were plenty of ways to get achievement points if I started sticking close to the main story.Everyone nodded to this as if it was quite plausible.Before I was forced to go to Temple, I did say that I wanted to live a comfortable life, but if I had to go anyway, any thoughts about that went right out of the window. I had to become stronger, whether I liked it or not.So, it was important to gather enough money to attend the first semester. From that point on, I\u2019d get woven inside the main story, collect achievement points and develop my talents.That was my goal now.\u201cCan we even do that with our earnings?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really know, but\u2026\u2026 probably not.\u201dLoyar wasn\u2019t particularly sharp.Daibun hesitated before he opened his mouth.\u201cWell, how \u2018bout if we cut down on what big sis is taking from the gang\u2019s finances\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe money Sarkegaar spend on his aristocratic life. Perhaps Loyar didn\u2019t disclose what she used the money she was taking away for. If we do as Daibun said we\u2019d be able to save up enough money for me to go to Temple.However, Loyar firmly shook her head.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I had to use it to prevent crap from happening?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. You did.\u201dLoyar seemed to have told them that she uses the money to bribe the guards, explaining why her gang wasn\u2019t cracked down on even though they were the way they were. Of course, I didn\u2019t know if she really did that or not.Well, Sarkegaar was a noble after all. He probably used his power to prevent this side from getting affected by anything. Either way, neither Loyar nor I could give up the support given to Sarkegaar.Daibun sighed.\u201cThese days our revenue is decreasing. Big sis, no one is getting close to Bronzegate Bridge anymore.\u201dThere were rumors spreading that this place housed solicitors. For a long time now, people in the know didn\u2019t come close to this place. As such, the revenue was gradually decreasing. That was only natural.\u201cThis is a serious problem\u2026.\u201dIt seemed like Loyar only realized at that moment that things weren\u2019t going as planned. Then she glanced at me, as if telling me to do something.Yes, I was waiting for my turn to speak.\u201cUhm\u2026. How about we think about this a bit differently?\u201d\u201cHuh? Differently?\u201dDaibun furrowed his brows as if what I said was strange.No, these people just didn\u2019t have enough sense to improve themselves. The answer was actually quite simple.\u201cIf the customers are avoiding us, we just have find them ourselves.\u201dThat was only natural. If one didn\u2019t have customers, one had to find some. I got quite restless seeing that they didn\u2019t even try to leave this place. It seemed like they were running around this area trying to sell their candy to people passing by. If one market was blocked, one should just open a new one.Who\u2019d help you if you just stayed on the ground saying you\u2019re screwed?\u201cFind them? Do you mean to expand our power to other regions?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cDo you have something in mind?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ll sent them too far away, the kids might get exhausted too quickly.\u201dDaibun seemed to think it would be difficult to realize because they had to walk long distances to expand our power.\u201cNo, this\u2019ll make things more comfortable.\u201d\u201cComfortable\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, they\u2019d just have to go to one place. It\u2019s a place with a lot of people coming and going with a huge flow of people, you know?\u201dAs if wondering where such a dream-like place was located, Loyar and Daibun looked at me with dumbfounded expressions on their faces.\u201cThe Mana Train.\u201dThat place had the largest flow of people in the whole capital.They\u2019d evolve from simple solicitors to subway vendors.Both Daibun and Loyar were astonished by my idea that could be called revolutionary.That was it.That was how things should be done.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Daibun continued to admire me, saying that he didn\u2019t know how he couldn\u2019t think of selling things in a place like that, and Loyar also seemed to think that that would be a good idea.I\u2019ve only been on that train once, but it didn\u2019t seem like there were any guards positioned on it yet. There might be complaints against the vendors getting filed, resulting in countermeasures, but that would be in the distant future.It didn\u2019t end there.This was my cash cow. Of course, things had to work out here. They had to earn a lot more and be more stable than they had ever been before.In fact, it was difficult for me to believe that either Eleris or Sarkegaar would bring in any income.Hence, this place was my lifeline.\u201cOf course, just selling candy alone like before would be a little weak. So we have to have something that would draw in everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d\u201cAttention?\u201dA place where a large amount of people gathered was overflowing with consumers. Of course, candy alone wouldn\u2019t garner much attention. It had to be a product that was specifically targeted at our customers.\u201cHowever, our financial situation isn\u2019t good enough to sell the good stuff, you know?\u201d\u201cRight\u2026.\u201dOf course, it would have been nice if we could sell good quality stuff that people needed, but if that were possible for us, we\u2019d just start an official business. Simply put, something simple, inexpensive that attracted a lot of attention, something that focused on utility rather than quality.\u201cToys would be the best thing to sell in our situation I believe.\u201d\u201cToys? I don\u2019t know what stuff they\u2019re selling elsewhere, but d\u2019ya think they\u2019ll sell?\u201dLoyar seemed a bit hesitant.I chuckled.\u201cToys are products who are demanded by a different comsumer group than the actual purchasers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dDaibun would probably understand, but Loyar wasn\u2019t the sharpest. Well, yeah, this was optimized for isekai characters. Not bad.An Isekai cliche.Talking about completely normal everyday things as if they were amazing in front of stupid characters.Depending on the level of the things the writer makes the main character say one could tell the writer\u2019s knowledge level.Something along the lines of: \u201cAah, this is soap. Because of the\u00a0surfactant\u00a0in it you can wash your hands really well\u201dThere\u2019s a 100% chance that you\u2019ll feel great about yourself for using the word \u2018surfactant\u2019 and about 98.235% of people will think you\u2019re one smart cookie.Anyway.This time I was talking about toys.\u201cIt\u2019s the kids who will be begging for toys, but it\u2019s the parents who have to pay for them.\u201dToys were something kids demanded, but the actual purchase happened through the parents.\u201cLet\u2019s say a toddler were to cry for that toy on a crowded mana train.\u201dThey were both staring at me talking.\u201cThen the parents would buy that toy, whether it was poor quality or not.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how I should explain knowing this even though I lost my memory, but I was sure they\u2019ll hear me out.If they keep suspecting me, I didn\u2019t think it would be such a bad idea to tell them the truth. I could even tell them I was a writer, however that would probably sound like nonsense to them.I had no intention of acting careless purposefully though.Anyway.Loyar and Daibun were looking at me almost as if I was some kind of devil\u2019s spawn-Well, wasn\u2019t I kind of one?\u201cYou\u2019re terrible\u2026!\u201dWithout realizing it, Loyar\u2019s true intentions slipped out of her mouth. I was surprised myself.Even if you treat me comfortably because I\u2019m a kid. Huh? You want me to be good? Huh? Didn\u2019t you say we should live comfortably together?I was getting a little mad.\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s do our best!\u201dI reached out my palm.-Pat!Loyar, of course, gave me her \u2018paw\u2019 out of reflex. Her face was completely blank.Conclusion.I didn\u2019t have any more plausible bullshit but toys in stock.* * *There were many other conditions I added. For starters they needed some neat clothes and a sales book to keep track of the articles they sold. Like that they wouldn\u2019t be shunned at least. They would at first do it like they did so far,\u00a0 but I\u2019ve been trying to urge them to become more customer-friendly in the future.We also had to think about our products, though.Daibun was very impressed with the measures I had taken. He told me that he now understood why his big sis wanted to send me to Temple. He even generously praised me, saying that I\u2019d deserve being their gang\u2019s brain. He even mentioned that it would be great if I received advanced education there.With just a few words his attitude changed as if he just received a thousand dollars instead of having to pay off a debt of a thousand dollars.I joined amidst the group to get to know them a bit better at least. To be honest, it felt pretty uncomfortable, but I couldn\u2019t avoid them anyway. It seemed like Loyar usually doesn\u2019t do anything but sleep.She apparently did make an appearance when it was time to punch someone.\u201cI heard that Daibun praised that guy.\u201dAlthough Loyar acted as the boss, it seemed like it was actually Daibun\u2019s role to manage the organization. Loyar said she\u2019d send me to Temple, and Daibun didn\u2019t hold back with his complements, claiming that I wasn\u2019t an ordinary person, so the other members seemed to be looking upon me quite favorably, albeit still a bit skeptical.\u201cHey, have a drink.\u201dThey offered alcohol to me without hesitation. Although one could see I was a minor at first glance, it seemed like they didn\u2019t care about that.\u201cHey, all of this.\u201dI, who was in my thirties, also wanted to have a taste, but I was rather surprised.\u201cHey! What\u2019re ya givin alcohol to some kid?!\u201dThere were some who said things like that, but I just giggled slightly and downed the drink in one go, before they could dissuade me.\u201cWoah, awsome.\u201dEveryone burst into laughter seeing me do this.It\u2019s a little bitter, but who cares.Alcohol is alcohol and water is water. So it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.The old man who poured me the drink chuckled. His breath didn\u2019t smell that good, but it didn\u2019t really matter.\u201cThat young and already knows how to drink! Hah!\u201d\u201cIs there a life without alcohol?\u201d\u201cWell said!\u201d\u201cThis is it! Oh, we can become great friends!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been getting drunk ever since I was your age, now look at me! Hahaha!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s get drunk again today! Let\u2019s goooooo! Let\u2019ssss gooooo!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s driiiink!\u201d\u201cHere we goooooo!\u201dWithout them I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to live, so I couldn\u2019t be picky and ungrateful.I drank vigorously with the beggars until far into the night. Surprisingly, these gents knew how to drink the right way. No, well, I actually was an old man, so of course I couldn\u2019t help but match these old men\u2019s pace.They asked me this and that, and I wasn\u2019t that drunk, so I answered them as I planned.\u201cBut how didcha get here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even remember anymore when I was abandoned. I was just drifting from place to place.\u201dToo young to remember when I was abandoned, Loyar found me while I was wandering around the streets, so she took me in.My origins were unknown. Everyone patted me on the shoulder saying that I must have had a hard time while still being so young. I was also told that I should go to Temple and become a great man.\u201cDon\u2019t be like us.\u201d They said. They gave me some advice that almost brought me to tears.\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s the name of this gang\u2026?\u201dIt seemed that Loyar was called by the nickname Irene\u2019s Wild Dog and she repeatedly called this organization a gang.Didn\u2019t they have another name for it? What the hell, the name can\u2019t just be \u2018Gang\u2019 right?\u201cOh, yeah. There\u2019s a big intersection up there.\u201dIntersection? What did that have to do with anything?\u201cWhat, does the newcomer not even know what this gang\u2019s name is?\u201dOne of the middle-aged man burst into laughter.\u201cRotary gang, dude. Remember that.\u201dAh.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *After seeing this drunken chaos in the middle of the night, Loyar got mad, saying: \u201cWhat gave ya the idea to make a kid drink alcohol?\u201dIt felt like I got drunk and my elder sister dragged me away to scold me. I actually did get nagged, but it was very different from my old days. Did the former Prince not drink before?Still, probably because I played around with the others at what felt like a welcome party, everyone seemed to see me as a very nice guy.The next day, I made it my goal to somehow sort out the situation of the Rotary Gang.Even though they were on my side, I didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that I knew everything about them. The reason I drank with them yesterday was obviously because I wanted to get to know the Rotary gang as well as its members as much as possible.The Rotary gang had about 200 members. That\u2019s quite the number.I didn\u2019t know what the exact income of the solicitors was, but if it was enough to support the everyday life of a nobleman, then one could assume that it was quite high. However, not only were they able to support a noblemen, but they were also able to cover food costs and received compensation money, you know?Just how many candies did they have to sell a day for that to be possible? Even if every single one of them sold one candy worth 5 bronze coins every day, which would just amount to a thousand bronze coins and 10 silver coins.That would just be a hundred thousand won. Even if everyone sold 10 pieces each, it would just be a million won. Moreover, not everyone is mobilized at once to sell candy. It seemed impossible to even maintain this group with just that.Of course, there were people who begged as well as those who solicited, but I didn\u2019t know if that would be enough to maintain such a huge group.The Rotary gang must have had a different source of income.There was no way that Sarkegaar and Eleris didn\u2019t know about this.It appeared that they didn\u2019t tell me on purpose.Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar kept some secrets from me about the Rotary gang\u2019s source of income.I was wondering what was going on, so I asked Loyar directly.Loyar usually hung around the bon fire deep in the sewers, where no one ever set foot in, whiling away her time or sleeping.I believe you have a different source of income somewhere else, but just what is it?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dLoyar cut me off as if she didn\u2019t want to tell me.\u201cOkay, then just answer me one thing.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAre you hurting people?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, but sometimes that\u2019s what happens as a result of it.\u201dThat was how Loyar answered. It wasn\u2019t something that necessarily hurt people, but in some cases it might happen as a result of it.\u201cI heard that the gang has about 200 members.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHowever, I believe there are only about 50 people living here.\u201d50 was still a large number, but it certainly wasn\u2019t more than 200. This was an indirect question pertaining as to where the rest of the members were. Loyar let out a short sigh.It\u2019s like she understood that I wouldn\u2019t back down so easily.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I thought it would be better if you didn\u2019t know about these kinds of things. I had no intention of deceiving you.\u201d\u201cYeah, it might be a little dangerous if I knew about it, right? That\u2019s what you were thinking.\u201d\u201cSelling candies is just a disguise.\u201dSoliciting wasn\u2019t their main goal.\u201cWe are supported by the Gardium Thieves\u2019 Guild.\u201dTheir main goal was collecting information that organization wanted, when they wanted.That\u2019s how it was possible to maintain a group of this size, Loyar added.So, I was right about this being the Fantasy version of the Beggars\u2019 Sect.The Rotary gang was the information gathering organization the Gardium Thieves\u2019 Guild outsourced. Even if beggars were driven out, they were rarely suspected. Then, at my question of whether my proposed change in soliciting method was meaningless then, Loyar shook her head.\u201cWe are inextricably linked to the Thieves\u2019 Guild, but the more dependent we are on them, the more they will try to control us. If the gang can operate only with the gang\u2019s profit, that alone would be meaningful.\u201dIn the end, the proposal I made yesterday meant a lot to Loyar and Daibun.If the group couldn\u2019t maintain themselves without the support of the Thieves\u2019 Guild, they would try to use the Rotary gang more and more freely. However, if the Rotary gang\u2019s own revenue grew, it could be freed from further interference from the Thieves\u2019 Guild.I did notice that Daibun was unusually excited, so that might have been the reason.It\u2019s complicated in many ways, but in the end it was all about money.I could also understand now what she meant with that it could end up harming someone, as they didn\u2019t know what the Thieves\u2019 Guild would do with their information.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know much about this. You can just go to Temple using the fact that you are from this side and forget about us.\u201dShe told the gang members that I was their future, however what she truly meant was that I should just focus on training myself at Temple. I didn\u2019t have a reason to care about the Rotary gang\u2019s matters.Even if there were problems with the Rotary gang, Eleris suggested that I should just cut ties with them after I got them to pay tuition for me and I entered the school.If I developed some kind of talent, I would be exempted from paying tuition fees and I would no longer have a need to be involved with the Rotary gang.That was why Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar didn\u2019t tell me about the gang\u2019s secret source of income, which I didn\u2019t need to know about.\u201cIf I\u2019ve satisfied you now, go with Daibun. You need to make an ID.\u201dAside from gathering the admission fees, I needed an identity first. Let\u2019s take a single step at a time.Shit.I had chosen a path when I was at the crossroads between just quietly waiting for the ending to pass and setting foot in the main story.I wanted to live comfortably, but in the end, I ended up having to join Temple. If it couldn\u2019t be helped, I would just have to do something about it, just like I did when I saved Charlotte the other day.After entering Temple, I had to clench my teeth.The future would change greatly depending on how strong I became.At that time, Sarkegaar, Eleris and Loyar.They all would find out that the Demon Realm wasn\u2019t that important.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22I was told that Daibun created a lot of identities for people that had no origins. He took me to the Imperial City Bureau, so to speak, to a nearby district office. The person in charge looked tried as if he had seen Daibun many times, maybe even questioning why he had come again.\u201cYou\u2019re looking quite neat today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve brought a child this time.\u201d\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know you actually cared that much.\u201dPerhaps because Daibun played the role of my guardian today, he wore clean clothes and bathed today. I did the same. The person in charge didn\u2019t seem to be all that fussy, as if this had already happened frequently except that we looked rather neat.He didn\u2019t have any suspicions or questions, completing the procedure swiftly.When I received the Dreadfiend\u2019s ring, I thought long and hard as to what to change my appearance to. Naturally I should have a lot of hair.I shouldn\u2019t be too handsome or too ugly.I did want to live as a super handsome man, but I didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention with my looks. That was the first thing Eleris told me.So I tried to make myself look moderately good-looking. Blonde hair, slightly curly, blue eyes. Neither the hair color nor the eye color were especially rare. It was good enough to looks slightly better than average. I was a bit good looking, but not overwhelmingly handsome.\u201cName.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cWhere were you born?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026. You don\u2019t even know from what town you come from?\u201dThe person in charge looked at me rather frustrated.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t really remember, because I was abandoned when I was very young.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask for much more information after that. He told me to put my hand on some mana stone in front of the table. He seemed to check something and then nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely no data on you\u2026 You must have lived a rather righteous life.\u201dHe suddenly spoke some nonsense, but I could roughly understand what that meant. This seemed to be something like a fingerprint reader, so if I were caught by the guards after I committed even a petty crime, my data would\u2019ve already been registered. \u00a0Homeless children like me were more likely to commit crimes, but seeing that I did not have such records, he presumed that I lived a righteous life.After all, my birthplace and address were unknown, but I couldn\u2019t just leave it blank, so I just made up a date of birth with those two. The birthplace was set as a suitable city that disappeared a long time ago and my address was south of the Bronzegate Bridge.It seemed like I owned the bridge, but I actually lived under it.Due to the advanced nature of the empire, they had a magic tool with which I was able to get a photo for my ID card.Daibun and I left the office, sent off with the reminder to periodically come around to renew the ID.So.It really was no different from a modern district office.They were too expedient! To a shocking degree at that!However, that was good!\u201cThat was pretty easy.\u201d\u201cWe gave him some things after all, so of course our stay would have been comfortable.\u201dI assumed that the person in charge was provided with a variety of things. I did feel that he was too easy going. If he got caught doing things like this, the outcome would be pretty clear.I checked my ID that was in the form of a metal card.It showed a picture, my name, date of birth and identification number. It wasn\u2019t much different from a modern ID card. The same went for the registration of biometric data.Only its appearance fit into medieval fantasy, but its convenience wasn\u2019t much different from the modern world.Once again, it was medieval Fantasy .Anyway.To sum it up in a single sentence.It was convenient.The town was still in an excited frenzy as a result of their victory. That atmosphere would last for a very long time. The improvement event when the\u00a0 war veterans returned would be on an even greater scale.A long festival would follow.Now that I had an ID, I decided to smoothly proceed with my admission to Temple.\u201cBy the way, does Temple just admit anyone who has money? Wasn\u2019t there something like\u2026 They won\u2019t accept commoners or something?\u201dWhile we were on the way to Temple, Daibun tilted his head..\u201cWell, I never heard anything like that.\u201dThe tuition fees were just so high that it was almost impossible to enter the school unless one was a noble\u2019s child, had wealthy parents or was part of a merchant\u2019s family.If one had the confidence to pay hundreds of millions of won a year, depending on what major one picked, one was free to go. If one wanted to pursue higher education one would have to expect to pay twice as much.50 gold coins was the average. Depending on ones major, tuition fees could rise to unimaginable amounts. Of course, there was a scholarship system, and there were cases where children were exempted from the tuition depending on how much they contributed to the empire.So, after the end of the war, a huge amount of medals would be handed out, leading the Temple to be crowded with more freshmen than usual starting with the next year.Temple was so expensive because they reinvested that money earned from that huge tuition fee into talented children. Most don\u2019t get that much education.Daibun took me to the Eredian district.That would be where the Gwanak district and Seoul National University were located in Korea.The only difference was that Temple was a much larger educational institution covering the entire Gwanak district. Therefore, it was only natural that the number of students was also astronomically high, meaning the money that went into this school was equally astronomical.Not only that. In order to prevent non-students from wandering around the campus, Temple was equipped with physical barriers as well as large scale magic barriers that block those that weren\u2019t students, faculty or people who had permission to enter. The Temple\u2019s security, crime prevention system and barriers that I set up were exactly the same as the Imperial Castle\u2019s.There were children said to come from each country\u2019s powerful family, so they created an environment in which they could fully focus on their studies without worrying about their safety. That\u2019s why everyone was able to send their children off to a far away place with a peace of mind and it would be a big deal if any of the students were to get harmed or abducted while they were walking around the campus, so they put huge emphasis on the safety measures.Of course, there were loopholes, because an incident had to happen after all.If the defense and countermeasures were too perfect, incidents wouldn\u2019t be able to happen. No one wanted that. Especially me.Anyway, Temple was practically a town\u2019s name, so it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense to say we arrived at Temple to begin with. The mana train couldn\u2019t even go inside of Temple.We arrived at the admission office outside Temple. Daibun couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\u201cThis is my first time coming here, so why are there so many people here?\u201dThe admission counseling center on its own was already huge enough to be called a school, and what was even more surprising was the number of people waiting near the entrance.They were people waiting to get admitted. They all pulled a number ticket, all of whom were children with their parents next to them.Daibun just couldn\u2019t understand that there were so many rich people out there trying to send their children to Temple.I knew what this was about.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what it is?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cChildren with special talents can enter Temple for free. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to confirm here.\u201d\u201cWill there even be cases like that?\u201d\u201cOne could never know.\u201dI put it as if it was just a guess, however it was actually the truth. Even though it was difficult for them to pay the tuition, there were some parents who thought their child had special powers or was a genius.Parents who couldn\u2019t afford to pay the school fees would come here with their children, counting on that possibility.Of course, most of them get sent back disappointed that there was no talent to be found, but they definitely did discover children with special talents, allowing them to enter the school.The probability was just very low.There were four forces in this world as a great whole.Combat, Magic, Divine power.And a power that was completely different from those three, a power that hadn\u2019t been discovered even after a long time. Supernatural power.Combat wasn\u2019t just about being able to run well, but being able to display superhuman powers after one grew up. Such was the case with Artorius. The Knights of Duke Salerian who pursued me must have been those with similar powers. However, even on the side of the Demon Realm, there were monsters a lot stronger. There was a good reason why the Gargoyle was able to crush these veteran knights in a single blow.In any case, those that have the potential to develop superhuman powers will go on to learn martial arts.Children who were unusually smart or were discovered to have magic-related talents would go on to major in magic.Those who show talent in divine power would go down the path of a priest or paladin.And very rarely, children sometimes awakened to bizarre abilities. These powers, dubbed supernatural powers, had not yet been fully elucidated, because it wasn\u2019t an ability that could be learned and used like magic. Some people might not even be able to control them properly.That was why the Empire was taking special care towards these supernatural powers. They weren\u2019t used as resources in the Demon World War, but they could be very dangerous depending on the person. Depending on the level of danger, users with supernatural powers that were thought to be out of control would eventually be disposed of secretly.For children with supernatural powers, Temple served as an institution to socialize as well as learn how to control and develop their abilities.Of course, most of the children gathered here would most likely fall under none of these four classes.Having talent was rare. Really rare.\u201cBy the way, with so many people here, would we even get our turn today?\u201dDaibun seemed to be thinking about a much more realistic problem. I was rather sure that if we were to line up there we would have to wait for a really long time. Perhaps so long until they closed their doors, so we couldn\u2019t know if we would even be able to get in today.Of course, that was an unnecessary worry.\u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0 here to apply for admission, not for consultation, right?\u201dWe didn\u2019t come here to try for the free admission, because we didn\u2019t have enough money or something.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right.\u201dWe proudly entered through the entrance to apply for admission, not into the admission counselation office.Unlike the admission counselation office, the place to apply for admission was quiet. Of course, there were people there, but the place they waited in was decorated very luxuriously.There were some parents who bawled their eyes out at the thought that they had to say goodbye to their children soon, perhaps because they came from afar, and some children who whined that they didn\u2019t want to go.No matter how good Temple was, you could always find people like that. What did they know? Just because they had to part with their parents.\u201cEhm, this is the window for admission applications\u2026.\u201dSeeing me and Daibun, who looked rather neat but also rather penniless, the counter staff tried to gently guide us to the other side.\u201cU, uh\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dDaibun froze by my side, perhaps because that was his first time coming to a place filled with enormously wealthy people. No, why would my guardian be scared, huh?\u201cI came here to pay the admission fee.\u201dOn the contrary, when I spoke up calmly, the staff looked rather embarrassed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23The Admissions counseling center was practically crowded with people, but the admissions application office was quiet and each student had a one-on-one meeting with a counselor to receive counseling. Said counselor said they came because we said we had the money to apply, but they looked at Daibun with a look of disbelief.\u201cUhm\u2026. This may sound rude, but may I tell you something in advance?\u201d\u201cYes. Go ahead.\u201dDaibun was completely frozen, so I just stepped up. The counselor continued with a slightly apologetic expression.\u201cThere are some people who only pay tuition for one semester\u2026 Those who wish to first enter the school\u2026.\u201dIt was true that 50 gold was a huge amount of money, but if they liquidated everything you had, there may be some people who could afford it, so there were some people who only payed for one semester like this. Was this about that?\u201cCan you not do that?\u201dIf we couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t that mean my plans wouldn\u2019t go through? The counselor also spoke respectfully to me.Perhaps it became a habit after meeting so many children of high-ranking people.\u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t have the money to pay the tuition for this semester and the next\u2026 It\u2019s a rule to expel these people after a certain period of time, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, if I don\u2019t have the money for the next semester, I won\u2019t be able to register?\u201d\u201cYes, in principle. However, there is no reason to sanction this just because of that\u2026. As not all the students admitted like that would end up this way\u2026. Sometimes, that is.\u201dWhat?Was there an additional setting or environment created by some probability that I didn\u2019t set up? The counselor hesitated to speak.\u201cThey would first pay the tuition for just a single semester and then, well\u2026 They would try to build up friendships with other more financially stable children during that semester\u2026. They then would ask them to pay the tuition for the next semester\u2026. There were quite a few like that.\u201dOh.I seemed to know what they were talking about.\u201cChildren would whine to their parents that a close friend of theirs had to leave Temple because they lacked money\u2026. There were parents who would listen to them, but\u2026 This is rather damaging towards Temple\u2019s image, in many ways\u2026.\u201dEven if the tuition for Temple was pretty expensive, that was of little importance to those who were very wealthy. In Temple, where nobles, commoners and royalty lived together, friendships transcending their social status sometimes occurred.Therefore, there were children who entered for one semester in the hopes of building such a connection, of course, it was mostly the parents that made them. Even if it wasn\u2019t just to make them pay their tuition fees, they calculated that it would be beneficial just to have an extremely wealthy friend.The children might make a fuss about their friends leaving, but the parents might just go complain to Temple why they would let beggars just casually wander around their grounds.I didn\u2019t even think of that when I set up Temple, but, indeed, short-term admissions could be used like that.It\u2019s ridiculous, sad, and pathetic that I didn\u2019t think of that!\u201cAfter this became a problem, we decided to no longer admit children whose parents cannot financially support them well enough to allow them to study here for a considerable amount of time while at Temple\u2026. The other problem is, that if children just leave after one semester, the other ones who were close to them would also end up very hurt\u2026.\u201dTemple\u2019s stance on this was understandable if anything. Changing classmates to often was also detrimental to the children, even if that student was just trying to mooch off of other kids\u2026. I would also want to implement such a policy if I were in their shoes.However, I was planning on developing my talent after entering the school to become a permanent scholarship student, you know?They probably wouldn\u2019t believe me if I started saying things like that.Wouldn\u2019t my path be immediately blocked if I told them I was the successor of the Bronzegate Rotary gang?Rather, I might have had a better chance if I had come from Sarkegaar\u2019s side.\u201cOnce you have prepared the documents to prove your financial status, we can review them\u2026. You don\u2019t seem to have that much leeway though.\u201dThe counselor was very politely dismissing the two of us, however I wasn\u2019t particularly offended by that.The Demon Prince couldn\u2019t enter Temple because he didn\u2019t have enough money.We came with the confidence that I\u2019d be easily admitted.That soon turned into the feeling of needing to beg to be let in.Daibun lowered his head as if he had committed a crime.No, if you don\u2019t have money, then you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault, dude.What was I supposed to do? I didn\u2019t think I would come across such an obstacle. The Rotary gang had many people, but it was difficult to prove their finances. It may have been possible to borrow money through the Thieves\u2019 Guild, but that was just ridiculous, as that would rather prove that I had connections to a criminal organization.As expected, my only other option would be to change my appearance again, get another ID card and enter as Sarkegaar\u2019s adopted son.\u201cSigh, there\u2019s nothing more I can do\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we do that inspection thing or something?\u201dWhen I was about to get up, Daibun said something out of the blue.An inspection? What inspection?\u201cIf it\u2019s an inspection\u2026.\u201dDaibun had a desperate expression on his face.\u201cHe might be a genius or have supernatural powers. Well, wouldn\u2019t that be possible? Does it cost money to do the inspection?\u201dNo, what\u2019s wrong with this man?The counselor looked puzzled at Daibun\u2019s sudden outburst.\u201cOf course, we conduct inspections at the application consultation center, not at the admittance office\u2026. Inspections alone do not cost money\u2026. However, the chances of a child having a talent are rather slim. Most children don\u2019t have a single talent\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat the counselor said was true. I didn\u2019t have any talent right now. So there was no hope for the thing Daibun suggested with such a desperate expression.\u201cHe, hey. Let\u2019s just get out of here, Daibun.\u201d\u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t know about that if we didn\u2019t try. How long does it take to get tested? Does it take long?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. It doesn\u2019t take that long. You just have to touch the physical scanner\u2026 but you shouldn\u2019t do this here in the admittance office\u2026.\u201dThe counselor seemed troubled by Daibun\u2019s sudden obstinate attitude. They looked between me and Daibun and eventually sighed slightly.\u201cOkay, since you came all the way here already\u2026.\u201dThe counselor rummaged through one of the counseling rooms and took out a magic tool, saying: \u201cIt won\u2019t take that long\u201d. A physical scanner, so to speak, was this world\u2019s talent and status meter. They determined one\u2019s current ability and potential talent with these things.This was the staple among convenient settings. If I didn\u2019t add something like that, wouldn\u2019t that have been too difficult? I would have had to describe it a lot more, and vague at that, so there was a need for a state window. Like that, one could immediately determine how strong a character was!Stat windows would quantify strength in numbers. Without it I would have had to describe the strength through events. I would have to explain it like \u201cBefore I did this and that and I just couldn\u2019t do it, but now I feel like I got stronger\u201d.That was just too annoying and difficult.Attack power increased by 1000!Wasn\u2019t that just too comfortable to write? I love it.But anyway, what Daibun was doing now was pretty much meaningless.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will be worth it, Daibun.\u201d\u201cIf you got nothing to lose by doing this, then just do it. Or is there something wrong with that?\u201dIt seemed like Daibun wanted me to take it as it was free anyway. He seemed to think that I desperately needed to enter Temple. I had another way, but Daibun didn\u2019t know about that.He was just thinking of me.He was such a nice guy. However, that didn\u2019t mean that I suddenly have some talent.\u201cYou just have to keep your hands on the scanner. Wait for about a minute.\u201dTo determine my talent, I will have to put my hands on a crystal ball, my talents will then be printed out on a tablet like magic tool the counselor held.There\u2019s nothing I have talent for.It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be able to see that I\u2019m a demon through this, right? Or see that I have that skill Demon Domination, right?I didn\u2019t think so. I had Sarkegaar\u2019s ring after all.Demon Domination was a unique skill of the Arcdemon race. It was completely sealed after I changed using the ring.Since it was an ability I could only use in the form of Valier, it should be hidden.Of course, it might not be as well.I should just run with the ring.Let\u2019s just go back and think about how to change my looks next.Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\u201c\u2026\u2026Hm?\u201dThe counselor suddenly tapped on the tablet. Was it that thing were you continue to tap on an iPad when it\u2019s not working properly?\u201cDid you find something?\u201dAt Daibun\u2019s question, they shook their head.\u201cUrg\u2026. My apologies. It seems that it\u2019s broken. This item is only rarely used here.\u201dThey left the counseling room as if they didn\u2019t even know how that tool worked as they were actually more used to dealing with the wealthy, but didn\u2019t have any experience checking for talent. They said, they\u2019d bring a new tool over.\u201cDidn\u2019t they find something?\u201dI shook my head at the expectant Daibun.\u201cNo way.\u201dI checked my status again, but, of course, I couldn\u2019t find a single talent in it. I knew my condition better than any magic tool could.\u201cI brought a new one. I even checked its functionality, so it should work this time.\u201dIt seemed like the counselor was gradually getting exhausted. It probably was because we caused them extra work just for someone who had no talent at all.I put my hand on the newly arrived crystal ball.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd, the counselor was speechless.\u201cWhat\u2026.Is it malfunctioning again?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThe counselor furrowed their brows.\u201cHow strange. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before.\u201dPerhaps because they were bewildered, but the counselor spoke informally this time.\u201cIs it something that breaks easily?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a very complicated tool after all.\u201dAs if he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on, the counselor showed the corresponding part of the tablet screen to Daibun.Should I even call it a screen? It kept blinking. I kind of wanted to know what characters it displayed and why it just kept blinking. What was this, was that a talent? Do I have the talent to break machines? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I didn\u2019t have that kind of talent?That\u2019s one of the shittiest, most common talents I had ever heard of! It was as bad as that kitchen disaster attribute, it was so common that it wasn\u2019t even used anymore, but now when it gets mentioned, it feels rather novel, but it was still hella old-fashioned, you hear!Don\u2019t give me that!The counselor asked me to put my hands down and put his own on the crystal.\u201c\u2026\u2026Looks like the tool is working normally.\u201dThe counselor then asked Daibun if he had his talents measured before, then told him to put his hands on it this time.\u201cCertainly, the tool has no defects.\u201dThat screen blinked so much, it was apparent that I was the cause. The counselor asked me to put my hand back on the crystal.\u201cJust hold your hands on it for a second this time.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhat the hell?I held my hands on the crystal ball for circa a second as I was told. The tablet screen was again blinking wildly. Soon after, the counselor opened their mouth speechlessly.\u201cWhat\u2026. I think I know now. In that case\u2026 There were all sorts of cases before, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dDaibun approached the counselor with an excited expression on his face.\u201cThere are cases where a subject doesn\u2019t show a specific talent, but \u2018aptitude\u2019. For example, it\u2019s not developed enough to be a talent, but if the subject works hard, they would be able to be outstanding it a certain field\u2026. It\u2019s a kind of sub-concept of talent.\u201d\u201cAptitude?\u201dAh, I knew what that was.\u201cFor example, someone with an aptitude for swordsmanship would be better in learning swordsmanship than archery or spearmanship. If a person with an aptitude for swordsmanship continued to study swordsmanship, he or she may become very gifted with the sword, or even excel more than someone who has talent in it, even if it isn\u2019t a talent.\u201d\u201cSo what does all that mean?\u201dDaibun was excited.\u201cThis device can read not only talent, but also what field the subject has an aptitude for. So they have this kind of service at the counseling center\u2026 Even if a child doesn\u2019t have a talent, they will tell them what aptitudes they have. It was rare for a child who doesn\u2019t have talent to not have any aptitude as well\u2026.\u201dIdentifying aptitudes.There were people who came from far away to receive counseling for the Temple admission, so even if the child wasn\u2019t a genius, they will tell them what route would fit the child best.\u2018Your child has no talent.However, since he has aptitudes in these and other areas, please make him study this and this.\u2019Temple seemed to provide that kind of service.The counselor turned the tablet screen and showed it to Daibun. It seemed that this was the first time that for them witnessing such a case.Swordsmanship aptitude, Archery aptitude, Magic aptitude, Magic Sensitivity aptitude, Spiritual aptitude\u2026\u2026.The screen was filled, showing all the aptitudes I had.\u201cIt seems that Reinhardt was born with an aptitude for everything in the world.\u201dThe screen wasn\u2019t blinkin.My aptitudes were almost infinite, so the screen was just constantly updating.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24\u201cI really don\u2019t have any idea what to call this. Were you born with God\u2019s blessing\u2026. Or was this some type of supernatural power\u2026?\u201dThe counselor looked puzzled.However, I knew what caused this.I could certainly force an ability that I originally didn\u2019t have to become my talent using achievement points. Even if I didn\u2019t have enough points to do that, the possibility was still there.Therefore, I was currently in a state where I could have all the talents in the world. I was born possessing every aptitude in existence, so that it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for me to get certain talents.The counselor seemed dumbfounded.\u201cIn this case\u2026. I don\u2019t know if it would be possible. Having an aptitude in both swordsmanship and archery wasn\u2019t really a problem, but if this data is correct, then Reinhardt can use both black magic and divine power.\u201dI could both wield the power of darkness, as well as holy power. Of course, it would be impossible to be able to use both of them at the same time, but it was possible for me.\u201cB, by the way\u2026. There has never been a case\u2026 that a child was granted a special admission only based on their aptitude a, and not on talent\u2026\u2026\u201dThe counselor seemed to think that this wasn\u2019t a problem he could solve with his authority alone.\u201cThen he could be admitted to Temple, right?\u201dDaibun seemed to block out the details and only heard what he wanted to hear.\u201cThi, this is such an unprecedented situation, but as this is such a special case\u2026.\u201dThe counselor blankly nodded their head.\u201cPerhaps, I think.\u201d\u201cGood for you, man!\u201d-Hits!\u201cUrgh!\u201dDaibun slapped me on the back and shouted.That almost killed me!In the end, it seemed it was just a delusion that I knew my condition best.Through Daibun\u2019s useless insistence, I could now see for sure what my condition was like.I didn\u2019t know something like this would happen.* * *\u201cAn aptitude for everything?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what they said.\u201dLoyar\u2019s eyes widened when I told her the inspection\u2019s results.It wasn\u2019t over just with the counselor\u2019s words, after that a professional wizard appeared to precisely check my talents. So after suffering for a while it was confirmed that the judgement on my aptitudes was true.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that a lot more than we expected?\u201dThat\u2019s what she said, but I could feel the tremendous admiration in her words. Even the previous Demon King wouldn\u2019t have been like that. Although I had no talent, I was born with the aptitude to acquire talents in any field.This may just be a correction caused by being able to interfere with my body using this system, but that correction in itself was already a tremendous ability.These aptitudes included even opposing aptitudes.It was possible for a person who had no talent or aptitude for swordsmanship to become a master swordsman by training swordsmanship, however it would be very difficult.One had to overcome this wall with effort.But why would a person who had no aptitude for it train swordsmanship? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just wake up from those delusions?No one could just have strengths. Even those geniuses who had many aptitudes and talents had also a good amount of inadequacies.For example, if a person had an aptitude for divine powers, of course, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use black magic. Conversely, a person who had an aptitude for black magic would not be able to learn divine magic. Some abilities rejected their counterparts.But I didn\u2019t have a single inadequacy.Of course, I didn\u2019t know if it was possible to give myself inadequacies, but like hell that\u2019s going to happen. Am I crazy?I went to Temple with the intention of paying the tuition for a semester, but ended up on a\u00a0completely different path.I\u2019d have to return to the admissions office sometime later, but I\u2019ve been told that they\u2019ll most likely decided on granting special admission. I didn\u2019t think much of it right now, but if there\u2019s some guy capable of being good at anything, it would be rather weird to not let him enroll through special admission.This was an unexpected windfall. Just because they decided to let me enroll through special admission we didn\u2019t have to create a hole in the gang\u2019s funds.There was no more need to to leave traces behind by paying the tuition with their money. Everyone wanted me to have an environment in which I could completely focus on improving myself in Temple. Like this everyone would be satisfied.No matter what happened later with the Rotary gang, it wouldn\u2019t affect me.\u201cBut you don\u2019t look very good, though?\u201dI smiled at Daibun\u2019s words.\u201cN, no, it\u2019s nothing. This is great. Like this I can enter even without being part of the gang.\u201dBut just as Daibun said, I wasn\u2019t in such a good mood.Originally, my plan was to gradually develop my talents over a semester and then I was planning to be exempted from tuition leading me to join the main story through said talent.However, in terms of development, I might have a higher chance to enter the main story like this rather than as a simple scholarship student..Temple had two types of special classes.The Royal Class, which one could enter through talent, and the Orbis Class, which one could enter through skill.Students with exceptional talent entered the Royal Class.Students who lack talent but gained outstanding abilities through hard work entered the Orbis Class.There was a certain rivalry between these two classes, but that would come into play later. It would be only after a long time that the Orbis Class was mentioned.Anyway.Entering the main story meant that I would soon join one of Temple\u2019s special classes, which will probably be the Royal Class.There was a high chance that I would enter the Royal Class, because I was recognized for my potential talent and not my outstanding ability.Originally, I planned to slowly enter the story by building my power for one semester and then climb to that position later.However, I would end up entering the Royal Class right from the beginning.That meant, that I would be together with the main characters right when the main story starts. I would bump into them without thinking much or planning to do so. If the story changed because of my actions, I would receive some achievement points, but the consequence of that would be that the story might bounce into weird directions, all the events would become unpredictable.I would have to use the achievement points I received by changing the future to see how the future changed, I would gain nothing from that. I could get other benefits, but those achievement points are the most important to me right now, so I couldn\u2019t just waste them.That\u2019s why I wanted to take that one semester to plan things out, but that opportunity got stolen from me.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dTherefore, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh deeply thinking about the special admission.Anyway,I was pretty sure this development is happening purposefully.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *What kind of novel was [The Demon King is Dead] you may ask?Although it was a novel I wrote, it was more like part of my dark history though. It got the worst ranking and tons of bad reviews.This was supposed to be a slice-of-life story that took place after the Demon King got defeated. The story took place in [Temple], located in the Imperial Capital Gardium, where people with immense power and wealth gathered.Although they nurtured talents specialized in combat, teaching things like magic and marital arts, Temple, who was recognized as the cradle of all learning, also encompassed elementary, secondary and higher education.The number of students, excluding the faculty, exceeded 100,000.From elementary school onwards, they adopted a similar teaching system as universities. On could apply for classes one wanted to take. Therefore, there were a lot of kids who never ran into each other even though they were in the same class if they don\u2019t take the same courses.Even in a place like that, the main stage was the Royal Class, one of the two most important classes in Temple, the other one being the Orbis Class.Those two classes were filled with the most talented of the Empire, the ones placed the most expectations on. Of course, they all held permanent scholarships. However, let\u2019s keep the Orbis Class out of this talk for now. I won\u2019t run into them anyway, for the time being.Anyway, one of the two flagships of Temple.Royal Class\u2019 Perks.Even if a course is already filled to capacity, one may still apply for said course. Even courses that go beyond one\u2019s grade could be applied for, as consideration for the geniuses. Therefore, the Royal Class was inevitably the object of envy and jealousy of ordinary students.In addition, Temple shoulders the cost to maintain a certain level of dignity as well as a luxurious dormitory exclusive to the students of the Royal Class.There were many who tried to get into the Royal Class using their money and power. However, one could only enter Temple through money, however the Royal Class didn\u2019t know status, rank or wealth. Only talent determined whether one could enter or not.Higher education at Temple started with high school.It didn\u2019t end there.Temple\u2019s higher education, including the Royal Class, consisted of 6 grades just like elementary school.That meant that a 6th\u00a0grade Highschooler wasn\u2019t that uncommon in this world.Simply but, it was like graduating from middle school and then immediately attending collage for six years.In realtiy, it was more like starting from the first year of high school and ending with the third year of college. Of course, it was possible to attend for three years and then graduate, but the education is usually completed after the sixth year. After that, there\u2019s university, but that was more like a graduate school.The Royal Class, that could be said to be the best of the best, divided the classes based on talent. The main character belonged to 1st\u00a0year Class B of the high school section.What was different about this was that the Royal Class, which selected people based on talent, divided the grades based on talents in the early stages of high school.That meant between Class A and Class B of the Royal Class, Class B was the inferior class, which was made up of children with lower ranking talents.Since the class was divided in order of talent, the members of the Royal Class remained the same even when they reached the next grade. Unless someone got eliminated or dropped out in the middle, or a person was added, the number of classmates didn\u2019t change from the first year of high school until graduation.Class B, who was the inferior group of talented elites, is where the main character appeared. He first got confused by his defeat-ridden classmates, endured humiliation and ridicule from the kids of Class A who were more talented and powerful and eventually they were able to overtake Class A with the power of love and friendship. That\u2019s the kind of youth drama I was planning to write.Not interesting at all? Sounds like it was no fun to read?Of course, it was hella boring.Stories about weaker students overcoming stronger students through hard work was rather common and nothing new. The Power of Love and Friendship? People are doing well on their own these days. If you let your classmates suck away your own life like carcinogens, they\u2019ll think their hot shit after you cared for them and helped them grow.I should have stopped writing right away after hearing what the person in charge told me.Anyway.It was now February.The main story would also start with the new semester in the same year as the end of the Demon World War.[You have been admitted to Temple Royal Class 1-A.]And, the Temple Admissions Office judged my \u2018infinite aptitude\u2019 to be an advanced talent.There was nothing really good about that.Class A would be the place I\u2019d receive my education in later.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cAre you worried?\u201dI was currently at Eleris\u2019 scroll shop.\u201cI\u2019d lie if I said no.\u201dI sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that they think I have some crazy talent. Being able to get in through special admission is also good, but it seems difficult to actually meet these expectations as fast as they hope\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have to be around the Bronzegate Bridge all day, so I went to visit Eleris. The Rotary gang was also relieved of its financial pressure thanks to me getting in through special admission.So until the entrance ceremony I was going back and forth between Bronzegate and Eleris\u2019 scroll shop.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do a good job.\u201dEleris gave me reassuring smile. Yeah, I could become anything. I knew that I was just nervous because I was nothing and hadn\u2019t done anything yet.Thanks to my aptitudes, which were judged as an advanced talent, I was able to bypass numerous procedures required for admission. If one had a highest-ranking talent, Temple didn\u2019t simply admit the student, rather they just take them in. That was why all the sloppy parts about my identity and origin were just glossed over.Rather, Temple itself became my guardian.Things worked out incredibly well. However, even if things worked out somehow, there was a definite future, so thinking about my friends from Class A made my head hurt.Above all else, living in the dormitory without Eleris, Loyar or Sarkegaar who were practically my guardians, was one more reason for my nervousness.In general, there\u2019s this widespread opinion that accidents did not happen at Temple.However, as a writer, I mean, I did add in many incidents to happen. I was well aware how sloppy Temple was, or rather than knowing, I made it that way.Eleris grabbed my hand while I was lost in my thoughts. The vampire\u2019s low body temperature felt unfamiliar, but at some point that coldness started to feel like warmth.\u201cWe will support Your Highness with all our heart. And even if you enter Temple, does that mean that you are banned from going out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not, but still\u2026.\u201dThey wouldn\u2019t ban me from going out or something.If I wanted to see them I could come out and visit Sarkegaar, Loyar or Eleris.\u201cAnyway, are there any things you need to take with you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have that many things. I would wear a school uniform most of the time anyway though.\u201dI would have to go to the dormitory tomorrow, so I had to take something there, but I didn\u2019t know what I should bring because I\u2019m literally in a position where I have nothing on me but my clothes.As I filled out various forms before my admission, and was told everything I needed to know, I didn\u2019t really think I need to take much.\u201cBy the way, why did you want me to enter Temple?\u201dI asked the question I couldn\u2019t find the answer to the other day.Eleris didn\u2019t want me to become stronger, but she still encouraged me to go to Temple. Eleris smiled at my question.\u201cBecause I think if you were to stay close to humans, you would come to love them.\u201dThis was a slightly different logic from Sarkegaar, who wanted me to get to know humans to use their knowledge against them.Eleris seemed to want me to get to love them.Well, I mean I didn\u2019t feel any real love towards humanity in the first place.\u201cYou might regret this later.\u201dEleris laughed at my words.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it when the time comes.\u201dThe strangest one of the bunch wasn\u2019t actually Sarkegaar, but Eleris. She brought over a trunk from somewhere.Rather she summoned it here with a snap rather than bringing it over.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThese are plain clothes you can wear. You can\u2019t just wear your uniform all the time.\u201dIt seemed like she didn\u2019t want to send me off empty handed. Eleris then took off her necklace and put it around my neck.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you remember that I called myself Tuesday?\u201d\u201cAh, I do.\u201dI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant, but was it something about that seven nights something?\u201cI believe you have forgotten about this as well, so let me explain. There are seven vampire clans who call themselves the Houses of the Seven Nights.\u201d\u201cMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, like that?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201dThose were pretty simple names.\u201cEach Family specialized in the magic type of the corresponding element.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s elemental magic based on the days of the weak?\u201d\u201cYes, the Monday and Sunday clan disappeared a long time ago, so it didn\u2019t get handed down which type of magic they held, but Tuesday is fire, Wednesday is water, Thursday is wood, Friday is metal and Saturday is earth.\u201d(T/N: To carlify, this is based on the Hanja of the words for the days of the week. Each day except Monday and Sunday have a type of element in their name as mentioned by Eleris here. \u6708\u66dc , \u706b\u66dc , \u6c34\u66dc , \u6728\u66dc , \u571f\u66dc , \u65e5\u66dc )While I still could kind of understand the power of the moon, I couldn\u2019t even imagine how vampires could use something like sun magic. Since Vampire Lords could withstand sunlight, maybe it wasn\u2019t that strange that that clan could use solar magic.\u201cThis is an heirloom of our clan and the symbol of our house, the \u2018Flame of Tuesday\u2019.The necklace Eleris gave me held a small golden pendant studded with a blood drop like ruby.\u201cEleris, then, does that mean\u2026. They call the heads of a clan Vampire Lords?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it would be, but\u2026.\u201dEleris seemed to be one of the most powerful Vampires and yet it still wasn\u2019t easy for her to stay out in the sun, even though it\u2019s not to the point of impossibility.\u201cSo, why did you give me this necklace\u2026.?\u201d\u201cIf this ring harbours the power of the Dreadfiends, what do you think this pendant could do?\u201dA pendant harbouring the power of a clan that specialized in fire magic.\u201cIt will enable me to use fire magic, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, it would only work within the confines of Your Highness amount of mana. It\u2019s a little different from Sarkegaar\u2019s ring. You\u2019d be able to summon flames just by using mana, no need for complicated chants.\u201dI didn\u2019t understand it fully, but just hearing her explanation just made me realize what a ridiculous item this was.Magic was a power only geniuses could use. This thing enabled even an idiot to summon flames if they have enough mana.Scrolls were only one-time use items, but with this I\u2019d be able to permanently use this magic.A great treasure, indeed.\u201cDo you want to try it out?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dBy using the Flame of Tuesday I could use fire magic. My mana level was at 9.9 as far as I could remember. I knew that this was quite high for someone my age.I held the pendant in my hand and imagined flames in my head, just like Eleris told me a second ago.-Flare!Then a Flame appeared in front of my eyes.\u201cThis is how it works.\u201d\u201cBut only this much?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect something of the leven of a fireball to appear, but this was just on the level of a lighter flame. Did I actually have as much mana as a rat maybe?\u201cYour Highness isn\u2019t able to make full use of your mana yet. If you learn powers related to magic sensitivity or magic control, you would be able to create more powerful flames with the same amount of mana.\u201dSo in the end that\u2019s all I could do with this powerful treasure due to my lack of ability.\u201cWhy are you giving me this?\u201d\u201cThere might be some emergencies in which Your Highness wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything, so having this would be advantageous, right?\u201dI didn\u2019t really know what I could do with a lighter flame though.\u201cStill, something like the symbol of your clan\u2026. Can you just give me something like that?\u201d\u201cIf I gave you something of similar value to what Sarkegaar gave you, wouldn\u2019t the chances increase that you\u2019ll stand on my side in the future?\u201dEleris spoke while laughing jokingly. Sarkegaar and Eleris both gave me their family\u2019s heirlooms.It was quite funny.Sarkegaar, the one that wanted war, gave me something that would help me live a peaceful life in the human world.The pacifist Eleris, on the other hand, gave me an item related to destruction.\u201cAlso, it would be rather shameless to proudly wield that place\u2019s items while deciding to betray them.\u201dEleris seemed to want to relinquish all the responsibilities and obligations she held as a Clan Head as well as the last member of the Tuesday Clan with this. It seemed like Demons couldn\u2019t let go of their families even while betraying them.\u201cI just have one thing to ask.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIf I use this, just this little flame comes out, but what would happen if you were to use this?\u201dI was just able to produce a flame the size of a lighter flame. The simplification of the magic chant would be a tremendous thing for a wizard, rather than someone as ignorant as me.So how much power could this little thing exert in the hands of someone like Eleris?\u201cI don\u2019t know, because I\u2019ve never used this before.\u201dOne could tell just by looking into her eyes that she was lying.It seems like there were some painful memories resurfacing in her, but I saw that this pain only briefly passed by her eyes. Eleris told me one last thing, looking straight into my eyes, holding my shoulders.\u201cYour Highness, this is by no means a good item.\u201dEleris didn\u2019t seem to appreciate this heirloom called Flame of Tuesday.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an object that responds to darker emotions. The more malice you hold against someone the greater the flame would be.\u201dThis seemed to be something I should be careful about while using.An object that could sense its owner\u2019s emotions, especially hostility and malice. It was an item that completely fit the preconceived image humans had of demons.\u201cI hope you\u2019ll understand why I offered the Flame of Tuesday to you.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want me to hurt anyone, but she was worried about me so she gave me something like that.If something happened at Temple, I should only use this if I was in a life-threatening situation.That\u2019s what Eleris meant.Eleris was afraid of me, but she valued me just as much.\u201cThank you, I plan to never use this until I graduate.\u201dEleris smiled brightly, as this was what she wanted to hear the most.She really was the weirdest one.* * *The Heirloom of the Dreadfiend clan.The Heirloom of the Tuesday clan, which was part of the Seven Nights.I was the only heir to the Darklands, the Demon Realm that got unified as one nation, so it wasn\u2019t so strange for me to hold these items.Still, a beggar-turned-Temple student was now in possession of two great relics of the imperial level.That definitely was suspicious.The ring, of course, was a camouflage item, so it had transparency and dematerialization magic properties on its own, so it just looked like an ordinary metal ring, and Eleris put an old looking metal case around the exterior of the pendant that otherwise looked precious. It certainly seemed like the better option to put a normal looking casing around it than camouflage magic that might get detected. So in the end all I had was what looked like a worn-out ring and pendant. To be honest, I\u2019d believe it if someone told me these things were picked up by a beggar wandering around.Since I received some amazing items from both Eleris and Sarkegaar, I had the thought that Loyar might give me something as well, but then again how could I expect anything great from someone wearing rags, chilling around a bonfire all day? She should just take good care of herself and eat well.That was what I thought, but\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026What is this?\u201d\u201cPocket money.\u201dLoyar handed me a bag of gold coins to use at Temple.Loyar told me to tell her if I needed any more money, because the issue of the admission fee got solved anyway, and Temple would only pay for some of my living costs.Loyar was the most important instance to me in the long run.It seemed that their progress of spreading their power to the mana trains was going smoothly.Tomorrow, I\u2019d finally move into Temple\u2019s dormitory.Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be good for me to continue living here, but I was exhausted just thinking about moving into an environment I knew nothing much about, filled with major characters.It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad just living at Eleris\u2019 place.I couldn\u2019t fall asleep that night, maybe because I was just thinking about all the trouble this would bring.However, I made a promise.I was going to do the things I set out to do and I would do them well.I felt it in Charlotte\u2019s case.It wasn\u2019t such a bad thing saving someone who was supposed to die.As a result, I could save people who died because of my karma. If you asked me, I believed this to be a good thing.This was a slice-of-life story.But even slice-of-life stories were written by people who were talented in that field.So the biggest reason for this novel\u2019s failure, the reason all the readers who kept going until the middle of it fell away, was\u2026I didn\u2019t have the talent for writing these kinds of stories until the very end. As the events and materials I had planned out were depleted, my writing lost its way and as a result I lost my motivation to move the story forward.Therefore.I just flipped the table.This crazy novel only came into being because of the author\u2019s lack of ability to create any more events.\u2026In the middle of that story\u2026\u2026I made Gates suddenly opened.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25This was called self-satisfaction.Naturally, the readers dropped the novel in disgust of that sudden development. But what should I have done? At the time I thought that would be the best development. Of course, it would have been better if I had just ran away, leaving it unfinished as usual, but then I had a sudden compulsion to complete it somehow.If you do stupid things, one day you will end up paying for them.Because of that crazy development, I now had to eat the shit I produced myself. So whether I liked it or not, that chaotic situation in which gates suddenly opened in this world, sending this world to ruin was approaching with every moment.It was a slice-of-life story for one half and the other was some weird Gate diving story.I now had three options.I could wait for the ending to come in a safe place, ignoring the fact that I had knowledge about these Gates.I could train until I got to a state where I could fight before the Gates opened and jump right into the situation.And lastly.I could eliminate the situation of the Gates opening by using the \u201cRewriting\u201d Function.For the second option I didn\u2019t really have to join Temple, but the third option absolutely required me to be part of the main story to get achievement points.As I had already experienced several life or death situations in the prologue part, I had no confidence whatsoever in fighting or seeing someone die right in front of me, so I had no other choice but to somehow prepare for the Gate situation.If it were up to me I\u2019d choose to hide somewhere and just watch the fire slowly burning out without concerning myself with it.Even though it was cowardly, my life was more precious.However, Sarkegaar, Loyar and Eleris had pushed me away from that. As my excuses were blocked one by one, I had no other choice but to give up.Anyway, if this reality really is the shit I made, I had to take some responsibility. It\u2019s impossible for me to take full responsibility, but if I were able to do something about a given situation, I should absolutely do that.I didn\u2019t know if it were possible to stop the Gates from opening. It was probably impossible.If that didn\u2019t work, then I had to become stronger through achievement points and decimate the monsters coming out of the Gate.So, anyway, part because of my own self-righteousness, I somehow had to do something about this future only I knew about\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI arrived at the first page of the main story.Temple.I had to either become the strongest on the continent, or somehow get rid of that Gate situation. Or I might end up with useless talents, that were neither this nor that.I wasn\u2019t even good at the things I liked, so should I try harder on things I didn\u2019t like then?Cold sweat ran down my face.* * *Temple was divided into three main sections: the elementary, secondary, and higher education facilities. 6 years of elementary school, three years of middle school and 6 years of highschool. There was also a graduate school for further education.Of course, there were numerous subsidiary facilities and special purpose halls scattered here and there. In other words, there were stadiums and other special facilities, including concert halls.As the campus was just too large to traverse by foot, Temple also had a separate tram line that only operated inside of it. Of course, it was free.Entering Temple for the first time, I was able to get inside with my pre-issued student ID including my admission permit.The vast campus of Temple accentuated by the blue sky spread out in front of me. It didn\u2019t really just feel like my imagination came to life.\u201cHuh.\u201dIt was much grander, much bigger and neater than I imagined, so I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. There was no way after all that I could picture this with just those limited written descriptions I gave.Among countless students wearing various uniforms coming and going, I stood blankly at the entrance, not knowing whether I should call this feeling I felt, being astonished or being moved.There were many different school forms in Temple, so I created this set-up of there being diverse uniforms, but seeing that variety right in front of me felt strange.The statues and street lamps placed beside the huge park-like streets, as well as the various educational facilities, seemed more like independent works of art rather than school decorations.The tram was also just running quietly along the tracks built on this huge campus.It was a mix between the Classical and the Modern, and in a way, it was a kind of disorder only I was aware of.Now wasn\u2019t the time for that though. I could admire it later.The place I should be heading to is the Royal Class\u2019 dormitory near the higher education facilities.As there were more than 100000 students, the dormitory facilities were bound to be enormous.The Royal Class of the Department of Higher Education had about 20 students per grade, and the high school segment had six grades, so there were 120 students in the Department of Higher Education in total.That was a fairly small number. This also showed that only very few people actually had talents.So the class I would be entering had on average of 10 students in each class. 20 students would be divided into class A and B. Although I got added in later, so there would probably be 21 students this time.I got off the Temple-owned tram at the place written in the guide.As soon as I got off, I saw a ramp lined with columns leading to the dormitory building.It felt incomprehensible to me how this 7-story dormitory only housed around 120 people.It was unbelievably huge. Although I wrote \u2018They receive great preferential treatment!\u2019, however, seeing this with my own eyes I began questioning if this was really okay. I didn\u2019t think that even a high-ranking lord could live in a place like this, you know?I was both bitter and happy because of the many things I wrote into my novel.I walked between those columns. As their shadows flitted past me at a regular pace I started feeling more and more nervous without realizing it. I felt like I was about to enter a place I wasn\u2019t supposed to enter.I thought it would be rather burdensome if I continued to feel this way everyday. Let\u2019s forget about the Bronzegate Underground Sewers, but Eleris\u2019 scroll shop was much more comfortable compared to this.Upon going through the entrance of the dormitory located at the end of the\u00a0colonnade, I could see a high dome-shaped ceiling, looking up, and a marble staircase leading to the upper floors.The lobby was communal and was connected to the 1st and 2nd floor through the staircase on the left and right. I knew this because I set it up like that..The 1st floor was for the 1st years, the 2nd floor was for the 2nd years, etc.Therefore, as their grade goes up, students become more and more annoyed. Of course, I wrote that there was something similar to an elevator. It worked with floating magic or something like that.\u00a0 The thing in the middle of the dome seemed to be that elevator.Looking at the structure of the building, the rooms for Class A were on the left and those for Class B were on the right. All the students belonging to Class A regardless of grade lived on the left side. The same went for Class B and the right side.I roughly knew what was going to happen from this point on.\u201cYou\u2019re a freshman, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dA senior student, wearing the same uniform as me, approached me with a file folder.A person wearing a female uniform\u2026.\u201cI\u2019m Ceres Van Owen, a 5th grader and the president of the Royal Class Student Council. Hello?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Hello.\u201dYes, that\u2019s how it was. Although the Department of Higher Education had an overall student body president and vice president, each school had their own separate student body president and vice president.Therefore, the Royal Class had its own student council president and vice president.The number of students the student council had to manage was enormous, so they had a lot of authority. To begin with, there were more than 50000 students who were part of the Department of Higher Education.However, the authority of the Royal Class Student Council, which had less than one-hundredth of the High School section\u2019s total number of students, was also quite high. This was the Royal Class after all, one of the the two pillars of Temple, and not some regular school.Of course, due to the relatively smaller number of members, the Royal Class Student Council had no other choice but to help out with certain things.Like guiding new students.No matter how well received they were from outsiders, there was no denying that there was a shortage of manpower within the Royal Class.I handed my Student ID to the senior student who introduced herself as the student council president and she looked through her files looking for my name.\u201cReinhardt, no last name\u2026. Class 1-A. You are assigned room A-11. Let\u2019s get along from now on.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dShe reached out her hand and I grabbed it. Students of the 5th grade of High School were already adults since they were 21 years old.The student council president in front of me would be in her last year next year and would probably be busy, so we probably wouldn\u2019t have many contact points. However, leaving a good impression was never wrong.Regardless of her actual skills, the Royal Class Student Council President was the most powerful person in this dormitory after the faculty. She had a lot of real power. Then she spoke to me with a smile.\u201cPerhaps after everyone arrives, they\u2019ll make you gather in the central lobby to give a brief reception and some warnings. It\u2019s okay to take a short rest after you unpack everything, but don\u2019t fall asleep too deeply if you decide to. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI dragged my suitcase behind me and headed for the hallway on the left. The sunlight trickling through the window intertwined with the shadows formed a complicated net on the floor. I never imagined I\u2019d see a scene like this in my whole life.As soon as I passed the main lobby, a lobby dedicated to Class 1-A appeared before me. Although it was smaller than the other one, it was still a formidable hall equipped with sofas, tables and reading tables where one could sit down at and relax.That was where the kids of Class B got together, ate snacks, chatted and conspired, although that refered to the lobby on the opposite side.Starting from this hall there were corridors leading to the dormitory, the magic lab, the reading room, the indoor gym and many more additional facilities including a restaurant. It kind of served as a hub. The main hub would probably be the main lobby.There were some facilities added as one rose in grade, but they were mostly similar in layout.Now that I came to a place I could properly recognize in this world I felt more comfortable, but in the end, I was still missing the details so there was still some awkwardness left in me.It was a complicated feeling that was difficult to describe.I entered the hallway leading to the dormitory and headed for room A-11. Just by tagging my student ID, the door opened immediately. That wasn\u2019t new to me. Everything was just powered with magic.This room was quite large for a single person. There was a neatly arranged bed, a large wardrobe and windows. There was even an indoor shower facility. The inside of the room wasn\u2019t as fancy as the outside, but was designed with a clean, modern feel to it. Rather, this was much more convenient. If it were too flashy it would just hurt my eyes.Currently only the basics were present in this room, but if a student requested for it other things would be added. Whether it was training equipment for physical training or a magic research lab. As long as it was within Temple\u2019s power anything could be added to this room.This was the best environment in which one could completely focus on developing one\u2019s talents without having to worry about other things.When I opened the closet, I found many uniforms custom made to fit me hanging in it. This was a service ordinary students at Temple could only dream of.I took my things out of the suitcase and put them into the closet one by one. I didn\u2019t even bring that many things because I could get anything I needed just by asking for them.The thing I should always carry with me is the ring of the Dreadfiend clan and the Flame of Tuesday in case for unforeseen emergencies.After unpacking my belongings, I lay down on the bed.I didn\u2019t know how much earlier I arrived, but I was the only one that got off at the Royal Class Dorm station.Once all the students arrived, I had to face both the students of Class A and Class B when the student council summoned us. They said it would just be a simple reception, so more like a greeting and not a party.There I would get to see all the characters I had written.However, there was something that\u2019s been bothering me.My room.Room A-11.Temple was a place that liked to rank people. Of course, the room number wasn\u2019t just randomly given out. Room A-11 meant that the admission office saw my \u201ctalent\u201d as the lowest among the First-Year Class-A talents.Yes, me becoming part of Class-A was a miracle in itself. I had no talent at all after all, although my aptitudes were infinite.I was put into Temple\u2019s Royal Class, which was divided into Class A and B, and there I was, the lowest ranking one in Class A.What the hell?I could already imagine what kinds of disputes I will fall into.Oh, you\u2019re that \u2018infinite aptitude\u2019 guy I\u2019ve heard about? But aren\u2019t you actually all squishy?Hey, hey, aren\u2019t you just weak?You\u2019re in Class A? How the hell did that happen?I thought I\u2019d probably get to hear stuff like that.Haah.I would have rather gone to Class B.Sigh, would I be beaten up by students higher ranking than me?I didn\u2019t want to be first or last. It\u2019s just that this strange situation itself was like dogshit.And I didn\u2019t know if things would go well or not.It seemed that no one fell in rank because of me at least.Obviously, Class A and Class B were set to have 10 people in them, but here I was, number 11. So that meant that I came in as a member outside of the original quota.Wouldn\u2019t it be fine if some hot headed idiot got dropped out? Wasn\u2019t there someone like that, who would get kicked to make place for me?No, wait, they might have ended up going down the list and pushing someone important out. Thank god, it was the way it was.I could see various people getting off the mana train in the distance from my window. It seemed like they were arriving one by one.If my guess was true.There obviously would be things happening that deviated significantly from the first part right at the start.I wondered what would happen.I took out the notebook and writing instrument I had prepared.Let\u2019s get my thoughts in order. It would probably be hard for me to remember every single one and there might also be the possibility that there are some characters who had no presence so I didn\u2019t know them at all. There were some characters who only appeared in my setting notes and were otherwise like air. I set up all 20 students\u2019 personal details, but not all of them played a major part, because if all 20 of them played an important role my writing would have become a mess.Of course, my writing went to shit after the whole Gate opening thing in the middle.Anyway.Class A and B.I should organize the personal data of all the students that come to my mind.One, two, three.\u201c\u2026..\u201dBecause there were more than seven people, I couldn\u2019t seem to remember properly.My memory was just great\u2026.I worked my brain hard to figure out all the names of all the unused characters and organized them. Fortunately, although I couldn\u2019t remember all their names, I still knew what kind of people they were.* * *It was late afternoon or early evening.[All students of the Royal Class, please gather in the lobby. All students of the Royal Class, please gather in the lobby.]Finally, a broadcast calling for all the students of the Royal Class appeared. I came out of my room which was on the far left and was able to see the backs of my classmates walking around as they listened to the broadcast.Elite or whatever.I now had to act as a freshman in high school.As much as I thought, that I had to hurry up, my steps became heavier and heavier. I was already exhausted.The students of Class A and B gathered in the lobby on the first floor. The student council members stood on the high stairs that led up.And there were people on each floor leaning over the railings looking down on us. The 6th graders who were on the top floor, didn\u2019t even come out to look.But why did all the senior students decide to look at the new students coming this time?\u201cCome on, both Class A and Class B, line up in your room order, starting with number 1\u201dEveryone lined up at the student council president\u2019s words. They didn\u2019t have any discipline though. Well, they were kids after all. I was at the back of Class A.Normally the senior students shouldn\u2019t come to see the new students, which was a rare event every year.However, here they were looking at all of us. I already found something that was different right at the start.\u201cWell, shall we start with A-1?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Bertus de Gardias!\u201dJust hearing that name gave me goosebumps. Bertus de Gardias, I heard the voice of the man who almost caused my death serveral times.It was such a lively and bright voice for someone so evil.He didn\u2019t exude any form of authority and seemed like a hard worker.It was strange.Originally, Bertus entered Temple while hiding his identity, but now he was openly introducing himself with his last name. So the entirety of the Royal Class was aware of the fact that he was the Prince.So, originally, the other students shouldn\u2019t have been interested in the new students, but after hearing the news that the Prince entered the school, they became eager to come watch.The introductions continued. I simply said my name.Of course, no one paid any attention to me.\u201cNow then, shall we start the introductions of Class B? Now, B-1, could you introduce yourself to your friends?\u201dIt immediately became clear to me why the direction of this event\u2019s progress was different from the original one..\u201cI am Charlotte de Gardias.\u201dSomeone who shouldn\u2019t have been here.Charlotte was in Temple\u2019s Royal Class.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26The Imperial Prince and the Imperial Princess both entered the Royal Class and joined the same grade. They announced that the princess was alive, but she never appeared in public.But then she suddenly entered Temple.Of course, Bertus was aware of her admission. He was also the main villain of the story. However, Bertus didn\u2019t use his authority to join the Royal Class.As he was a major character, I was, of course, able to give a brief outline of the character.Number A-1.Name: Bertus de Gardias.Talent: Swordsmanship, Magic Sensitivity, Magic Control.Characteristic : Narrow eyes. (T/N: Like those characters that never open their eyes of which a lot are kinda two faced)Remarks : A Bastard.In front of others, he acted kind and got along with everyone, however, he, in fact, was someone who did a lot of bad things when left alone. A bastard who was originally good, but explodes once he got angry. I didn\u2019t even think that he even had naturally narrow eyes.And those three simple talents.Swordsmanship, Magic Sensitivity, Magic Control.Those were talents Duke Salerian forced to bloom by spending a great deal of money on Bertus. Ever since he was young, he had to undergo countless surgeries in order to get these three talents. With money and power, talent could also be made to bloom by force. Although that was only possible if one were the Imperial Prince.So what were these three talents?After a long study conducted by the Empire on why someone wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the master-class even though they trained hard for a long time, they came to the following conclusion.A combat-related talent, magic sensitivity and magic control.It was almost impossible to reach the Master-class if one had no aptitude for any of those three. There were some who had talents in combat related weapon skills, but it was very rare to have an aptitude for magic sensitivity and control at the same time. If having them as aptitudes was rare already, then, of course, it was even rarer to have both as talents.However, Bertus had all three as talents, not as aptitudes. His talent was swordsmanship and magic sensitivity and control were essential requirements.To become a master in swordsmanship, that is.In other words, he would become a Swordmaster.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The Imperial Family was also getting educated at Temple. It was a kind of advertisement and proof of credibility. If one said Temple was the best educational facility in the world and then went and taught the Imperial Family separately, anyone would probably have doubts about the reliability of those words.However, in the Empire, the Imperial Family was also educated here.So it was no wonder that its reliability and safety skyrocketed. Of course, the Imperial Family could just get educated separately , but with them deciding to sned their children to receive their education at Temple, other people couldn\u2019t help but place their trust in its security.Were they also living in the dormitory?Needless to say.That was why so many sent their children to Temple with such confidence. Because they thought their children would be provided with the same level of education and safety as the Imperial Family.Bertus had already known about that.So he was expecting Charlotte to come to Temple to some extent.It was rumored that he would come to this place, so I was a little hesitant to come directly to the Royal Class and not as just another regular student. There was a high chance that I\u2019d be caught by that smart guy.The reason why the Duke forced his talent to bloom was because no one of the Imperial Family ever belonged to the Royal Class. A place that one could only enter through talent and not through power. If the Prince entered the Royal Class and graduated with excellent grades, he\u2019d be able to build enormous authority just by doing that.Naturally.Imperial Princess Charlotte de Gardias could use the same method. What was possible for the Prince wouldn\u2019t be impossible for Charlotte, the Imperial Princess, either.So there was a good chance for Charlotte to also possess a talent, enabling her to enter the Royal Class. However, even if she was first ranked, was her talent inferior as she was in Class B?Or.Did they intentionally separate these two? Both of them were in the position that corresponded to the leaders of Class A and B.No one knew about their circumstances, but I did.Bertus obviously had great talent, but it wasn\u2019t the number one talent. Even though he was fit for Class A, he actually should have been in the third or fourth spot if they really only considered his talent.His power intervened in this decision.Strictly speaking, it was the judgment of the faculty that if the Prince were to enter the Royal Class and ended up in the third or fourth seat, they might end up going against Bertus for nothing.It was difficult for power to influence this place, but there was no place that couldn\u2019t be influenced by it somehow. There were people who knew how to bootlick no matter where one went. In the first place, it was just an implicit rule to line up according to one\u2019s room number, not a written one. So Bertus didn\u2019t really have the number one talent, but just the number one position.So what was going on with Charlotte? I wasn\u2019t sure if she became number one of Class B because of her talent or because some faculty member or even someone higher up. I had no idea if there were instructions behind this.However, the result was presented in front of us.The semester that was about to start would be far from the pleasant school life I had planned.\u201cWelcome to Temple\u2019s Royal Class!\u201d\u2013Clap, clap, clap, clap.All the plans I made for the future had collapsed and the fight between Charlotte de Gardias and Bertus de Gardias was about inevitable.And here I was in Class A.I was on Bertus de Gardias\u2019 side.\u201cDid you say your name was Reinhardt? Let\u2019s do our best together!\u201dThe guy standing next to me spoke to me. Even if I didn\u2019t look at him, I knew exactly who he was. Since we all introduced ourselves already. However, even if he didn\u2019t introduce himself I would have known.B-11, the one that was originally supposed to be number 10.This was the historic moment of the last ranked of Class A and B meeting.\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dYou would do just fine on your own, the problem is me, you shitty main character.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Two people were added that originally weren\u2019t supposed to be here. One was me and the other was Charlotte.The story had already gone awry right at the start. It was like there were actually two writers to this story, the other making every change I made fit the narrative.That was probably how I even ended up having to fight the one I risked my life for at the side of the one who tried to kill me.Except for that short exchange I had, we didn\u2019t have to do something as troublesome as talking with these 100 plus students. The reception ended after everyone introduced themselves and everyone applauded.The student council president then announced the rules of the Royal Class to us.\u201cThose friends who have already received elementary and secondary education at Temple would know these things, but there are some among you who have just transferred here to the higher education division, so I shall explain.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, all students of Temple are equals, the Royal Class isn\u2019t an exception. All your classmates are to be treated the same. There are no ranks in Temple, except the relationship between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen. Wherever you came from, whether you\u2019re a noble, part of a royal family or even the Imperial Family. If we start looking at lineage like that, Temple wouldn\u2019t be able to operate like that, right?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a policy that came into existence because every student no matter where they came from had the right to a fair education and as such should be treated equally or something.It was made because Temple\u2019s system would become ridiculously complicated if they had to look into every student\u2019s lineage. There were kids coming from all over the continent after all.It would be possible to educate commoners, nobles, royalty and the Imperial Family separately, but things wouldn\u2019t end there. The nobles would say things like: \u201cI\u2019m a duke so how could I be placed in the same class as the mere son of a baron?\u201d and the royal families would go on to say: \u201cHow could I be placed in the same class as the prince of such a lowly kingdom?\u201d.There would be no end, if it were decided to separate the students based on lineage. There were just too many people coming here for that. Status brought identity with it, so even among the students of similar status, there would be tens of hundreds of class divisions, to the point students wouldn\u2019t even be able to study properly, grouped together based on their lineages and said things like: \u201cYou and I cannot eat together, your presence alone is insulting.\u201d, to each other.So Temple had this rule of students to not reveal their status in school, not because they cared that much about the students\u2019 rights and interests or tried to prohibit discrimination. If people starting arguing about lineage, Temple wouldn\u2019t even be able to exist in the first place.Of course, this might be a bit difficult for people of very high status.So those guys might not even come here.Or they joined because of the connections, knowledge and recognition they would gain by graduating from Temple.There were still people who would reveal their status at Temple and tried to take advantage of others even after being warned a few times, eventually they would get expelled. Members of the Imperial Family weren\u2019t an exception. It might be a bit shameful for the people of the Imperial Family, who were far up in terms of lineage, to have their children expelled after creating such a mess, but the Empire rather welcomed that. It served as another example of the fairness and greatness of Temple to every single person of the continent.As I mentioned before, Temple was a place that brought in a lot of money, and sometimes money is everything in the world.The student council president, Ceres van Owen, who was in front of me was also the rightful heiress to a Royal Family of a Principality located in the southern part of the Empire, although I couldn\u2019t even remember what the name of her country was anymore. Judging by her name, I thought it must have been called something like Owenia. Now that she was about to graduate from the Royal Class, she was sure to be greatly welcomed back when she returned home.Still, Imperial Family members of the Empire came to Temple, what was more these two were potential candidates to become the next emperor, and she just casually told them not to reveal their true identities and to get along with everyone.That\u2019s the Gardias Temple for you.It wasn\u2019t like there were any cases where someone retaliated later on for what happened at Temple, but these guys would get heavily criticized. Well, put simply, all personal resentments created in Temple should be buried in Temple. That was this school\u2019s rule.Of course, that also included romantic relationships. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a noble or someone of a royal family to fall in love with someone and then pretended not to know them or straight up ran away from their lover after graduating.\u201cThe rank you have outside of Temple is completely useless in here. You can act like a military god outside of Temple as much as you want, but if I ever see any of you do this on campus, I will have to give you a warning using the authority given to me as the student council president. If you have accumulated warnings beyond a certain amount, a faculty meeting will be held, where the disciplinary action taken against you will be decided upon. Don\u2019t even think for a second that everything will end in expulsion. In some cases it might lead to diplomatic problems or jail time. If that is the case, keep in mind that you are to be punished by the special law that Temple students are subjected to, and not according to your original status. Of course, you might have been granted immunity as each country has different laws, but you should keep in mind this won\u2019t apply in these situations. If you force your classmates to call you in a specific way or tell them that just looking in your eyes is seen as an insult would hardly make you seem like the one in the right here.\u201dThe president and vice-president had the authority to interfere with the students.If it was inside Temple, even if they were the heir to the throne, if they did something against the rules, they would be scolded by the president.Of course, they could get revenge against them because they felt offended, however, if the Imperial Family started interfering with the affairs of students at Temple, it would not only be childish, but it would also seriously tarnish Temple\u2019s honor, which was the Empire\u2019s source of enormous income and a landmark.Therefore, these two would faithfully follow Temple\u2019s rules. If they were to brandish their authority and power here, ignoring all the rules, it would just be like spitting in their own faces.Temple was the Empire\u2019s face along with the Imperial Family after all. Throwing insults into one\u2019s own face was pretty inefficient.\u201cAnother important thing. Do not intentionally drag what happened outside of Temple inside of it.\u201d\u201cFor example, using the various privileges that Temple students receive to commit crimes outside and then escape to Temple.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care if any of you were enemies outside of Temple or if there\u2019s some feud going on between your families. Temple is an educational institution, not a political arena. Competitiveness in good faith is permitted, but if you use unfair or unreasonable means or if external powers or forces intervene in these matters, the student concerned will be expelled and will be subject to numerous responsibilities.\u201dIn other words, don\u2019t drag outside powers into Temple. In the end, all these things she was telling us were more or less directed at Charlotte and Bertus.Everyone was secretly guessing that this would definitely play a part in the struggle for imperial power.\u201cAlso, there is a message from the Imperial Family Gardias. Originally, this wasn\u2019t allowed, but this situation is somewhat special in many ways, so I will read it out to you.\u201dYet another thing that hadn\u2019t existed before sprung into existence.The student council president opened a letter and read it out to us.\u201cFrom the moment this letter is read out, if any problems arise with either Charlotte de Gardias or Bertus de Gardias, both inside and outside of Temple, even if it is just a simple accident, the other party\u2019s rights to the throne will be permanently deprived. Emperor Neliod de Gardias, Grand Admiral.\u201dThe student council president turned the letter over and showed us that the seal of the Imperial Family properly stamped on it.The Emperor blocked any future attempts for them to assassinate each other.There was a reason why the two of them were pushed into the same place in Temple just when the conflict over the succession to the throne was expected to intensify.Now that the Emperor\u2019s power seemed to pierce through the sky due to the victory in the Demon World War, his words held more authority than ever. In fact, the Emperor was the most powerful one since the founding of the Empire. That was the price he received in exchange for the hostages\u2019 lives.Now the Emperor could even appoint a completely weak member of the Imperial Family who had no real authority or base as the successor.That\u2019s why he was telling the two most influential successors to not think about hurting each other, but rather protect each other no matter what.They should win the Imperial Power through fair competition.Nelliod de Gardias, the current Emperor, was an unprecedentedly powerful Emperor who could make such ridiculous demands.It was as if he was telling them: \u201cDon\u2019t even think about trying to commit the perfect crime, because even if your opponent dies because of an accident, your right of succession would be void.\u201d. Only this Emperor, who had the most power in the history of mankind due to his victory in the Demon World War, was able to place such an absurd condition.The letter wasn\u2019t only addressed towards Bertus and Charlotte.It was to all the students, faculty and the followers of Charlotte and Bertus who might be among them.From the Emperor\u2019s words, both Bertus and Charlotte should have realized that they should value the life of their opponent as much as their own.I couldn\u2019t see what kind of facial expression those two were wearing.Anyway, I was really grateful.I wasn\u2019t sure about Charlotte, but that Bertus guy would definitely cause bloodshed, in the near future at least.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27There\u2019s the rule that all students had to treat each other equally, and the authority, power and status one had outside was meaningless in Temple.\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Yo, your Grace\u2026?\u201d\u201cCome on, you should talk to me comfortably. It\u2019s the rule here to treat everyone equally.\u201dHowever, this rule was rather tricky to implement for lower ranking people..Could you just talk comfortably to a Prince just because he asked you to?In the past when we went to Temple, you sure were talking casually to me, haha.You were telling me to do so after all, hahaha.Do I look so easy to you?They were afraid to someday hold this kind of conversation.Of course, Bertus wasn\u2019t that kind of character, but rather, it was just the lower class getting intimidated by his presence.After that, the student council president informed us about the general rules and told us to refer to the manual if we had further questions.It was mostly about the curfew, meal time, items that could and could not be brought in and when to wake up. Just some little things. We were warned not to wander around after lights out. Of course, it was possible to go out if necessary, but we were told to prepare for a scolding by the superintendent if they found out.\u2018Since the superintendents have a lifetime contract with Temple, if you don\u2019t have enough power to influence even the Temple staff, you\u2019d better wake up on time.\u2019They even gave us that kind of dreadful warning.Temple was fully prepared to even counter act their teachers being weighed down by their students\u2019 authority and couldn\u2019t do their jobs as teachers properly.In the lobby on the left, the students that met each other for the first time today got together and talked with each other. I sat slightly further away and overheard what they were talking about.Bertus was a hidden villain to begin with. At the start, guys with a hot temper were the ones who started arguing with Class B. Bertus originally appeared as a good guy in Class A. He was amiable, didn\u2019t discriminate against others and was kind to everyone in Class B.He even hid the fact that he was a prince. He hid his identity and just enrolled into Temple\u2019s Royal Class as an outstanding student. He later revealed his true identity and character to the main character! That was how I set it up.But now, because of Charlotte\u2019s admittance his identity was already known. In other words, the development I had previously planned out disappeared like smoke.Even so, it wouldn\u2019t change the bigger framework of this academy setting. Going to classes, studying and training. Although the development would be different, the structure would be the same.\u201cTake it easy, take it easy. If you don\u2019t, I might be the one who gets a warning, you know? Aren\u2019t you worried about that?\u201d\u201cAh, Uh, uhm\u2026 Yes, I am\u2026.\u201dBertus was telling the students who had a hard time dealing with him to treat him comfortably, while teasing them slightly, just like I set him up to be.Class A, which consisted of 11 people, did not use different dormitories for men and women. Temple focused more on dividing the inferior and superior students than on dividing male and female ones.Right now, the person asking the Prince about various things was number 9 Erich de Lafaeri, the son of Count Lafaeri. I couldn\u2019t remember if he had talent in divine power, swordsmanship or something else, but it must be a talent suited for a Paladin.As an aspiring paladin, I set him up to be a shallow guy. Strong against the weak and weak against the strong. Typical.He was the one who despised Class B the most. He was also the prince\u2019s lackey.Ah.I feel like someone spoiled me here, because I already knew these developments in advance. That feeling of knowing someone\u2019s inner thought was both a good one and a bitter one.\u201cHave you ever been to Lafaerie? Oh, of course, you haven\u2019t been there before\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh, Lafaerie, it\u2019s the great territory in the Northwest. I\u2019ve never been to it before, but I know it produces good grapes. I can\u2019t drink yet, but I know because the Emperor likes to drink wine from Lafaerie.\u201d\u201cO, oooh! You know!\u201dErich was almost moved to tears just because the prince knew about his territory.Although I didn\u2019t find that matter all that moving, Bertus\u2019 ability to commit anything he saw to memory and to recall any of these things at will sure was amazing.Bertus smiled innocently.\u201cAs a matter of fact, I had a few sips without the Emperor\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\u201cAh, re, really?\u201d\u201cIt had a good feeling to. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t remember too clearly.\u201d\u201cNo, no! No! Tha, thank you! B, by the way, you did it wi, without\u2026 You did it without the Emperor knowing\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that much different from you, you know? I also do things I want to do secretly behind my parents\u2019 back. Then if I get caught I get scolded.\u201dWhat a ghoulish bastard.It was so absurd watching Bertus make his first slave in real time right in front of me. After talking for a long while, Bertus got up and approached someone. They came down to the lobby, wiping down their hair with a towel as if they just came out of the shower.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201c..\u2026Huh. You got business with me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to get to know your classmates a bit more? I\u2019m Bertus. Nice to meet you. I saw you earlier, you were rank 2, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to introduce myself formally.\u201dA girl with black hair and eyes. Even though this was the first time I saw her, I knew exactly who she was.\u201cEllen.\u201dThe girl tried to walk past Bertus as soon as she said that.\u201cHuh? That\u2019s it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know you.\u201dBertus smiled bashfully and extended his hand to her.\u201cI heard about it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe girl that introduced herself as Ellen looked at Bertus before she held his hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Of course, you were supposed to be number 1. I guess there were some people meddling. I really wanted to apologize to you for taking your place.\u201dBertus spoke as if he knew something about Ellen.\u201c..\u2026I don\u2019t care.\u201dAfter Ellen said that she brushed away her hair and walked towards the restaurant.\u201cHey, did you hear?\u2026 She was supposed to be number 1\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah. Right.\u201dA girl who was supposed to be number 1 got pushed down to number 2 because of Bertus.She introduced herself as just Ellen, but Bertus knew that the girl was hiding something.Of course, I also knew as it was part of the main story.What she hid was her real name. Her last name to be exact.Ellen Artorius.She was the sister of the Warrior Artorius.* * *Ellen Artorius.If Bertus was the villain who had slightly better talents than the main character, then Ellen Artorius was a powerhouse that the main character couldn\u2019t even dare look at.As such, she was the main character\u2019s real rival.Although she fell to Class A\u2019s second rank, she actually possessed such tremendous amounts of talent that just calling her first rank wasn\u2019t enough.She had a lot of talents I couldn\u2019t clearly remember. Things like weapon mastery, magic domination, magic resistance, spiritual sensitivity, psychic resistance, fast-learning and many more.She was a genius and good at everything.She was the beneficiary of that set up.That was why Ellen hid her vast amounts of talents from outsiders. It wasn\u2019t an ordinary number of talents after all.If I had infinite aptitudes, then Ellen was born with every type of combat talent there is, though it wasn\u2019t infinite.If Swordsmanship was a talent for just one type of weapon, then Weapon Mastery would be a type of comprehensive talent. It meant that one had a talent for all types of weapons. Even if she just had a talent for a single weapon and an additional one she would have been able to enter Royal Class, but counting Ellen\u2019s talents was just a meaningless task.She had so many talents that no one could match her in the class of warriors. In addition to her magic resistance she had one more resistance that no one except Ellen had. She had the talent to develop a resistance against supernatural powers.To begin with, I made her as a character that felt like a mountain the main character could never over look, so of course she was a Munchkin. As was etiquette in these types of novels, the main character would eventually rise to a level comparable to Ellen Artorius.Bertus was watching the leaving figure of that Ellen, who didn\u2019t seem to care much about him. Erich watched her with an expression as if he wanted to say something like: \u201cWhat? How dare you ignore His Grace?!\u201dI heard all their names during that self-introduction, however, even though I was the one who set up their names, honestly, I still couldn\u2019t remember all of them.What did that guy do again? What were his abilities?There were so many characters and it wasn\u2019t like this was the last novel I wrote about the Demon King\u2019s death, so I couldn\u2019t help but forget.Bertus greeted each and every one of us in the lobby as if he was trying to get acquainted with us, I was no exception in this.While Bertus was talking, I again tried to recall the faces and names of the remaining people.\u201cI think you were called Reinhardt. Right?\u201d\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do well together, my friend.\u201dIt seemed like we already had too bad of a relationship though to become friends, but, well, that wasn\u2019t a reason to act too unfriendly.The one I had to be on guard the most about wasn\u2019t Bertus after all. I had to be careful not to let Charlotte know who I was. Bertus didn\u2019t know anyway.I had some guesses about Charlotte entering the school, but I was actually pretty surprised that it actually happened.I had to be careful not to stand out too much. Even though Charlotte didn\u2019t know for certain that I was a demon, she did know that I was suspicious. That\u2019s what I noticed before I fled without a word.I was certainly uncomfortable with the idea of having to be in the same class as Bertus, but it was a lot more dangerous to be in Charlotte\u2019s class. I was glad that I got into Class A.It was that\u2026.It was about time for that to happen.\u201cHey, guys! Nice to meet you!\u201dA guy approached Class A\u2019s lobby with a lively expression on his face.\u201cLet\u2019s get along in the future!\u201dThe one ranked last in Class B and the main character, Ludwig, was coming towards the lobby.* * *Technically, the A and B Class dormitories weren\u2019t off limits to the other class.It was more like an unwritten rule, so someone heading to the other class\u2019s dormitory didn\u2019t happen often. Even more so as the grades went up.That was because Class A clearly perceived Class B as inferior and Class B was also uncomfortable with or rather they disliked Class A.In fact, as one went up in grade, there wasn\u2019t even a way for class members to go back and forth between the two. In some cases, Class B was able to overtake Class A by working hard, but that just added to the annoyance of Class A.Of course, this was the first day everyone here joined the Royal Class, but those who have attended Temple since elementary school had heard about these facts.Therefore, it wasn\u2019t that unreasonable for the people in Class A\u2019s lobby to look at Ludwig, who came to Temple for the first time today and proudly introduced himself as Class B\u2019s number 11, with an expression seeming to ask \u2018What\u2019s with that bastard?\u2019.That was the event that took place right after the self-introduction after entering the dormitories.Ludwig just stopped by Class A to say hello, but was met with rather bitter reactions.There were five people in the lobby right now.I, Bertus, No. 9 Erich, No. 10 Cayer Vioden, No. 4 Harriet de Saint-Owan.Except for me and Bertus, everyone was frowning at him. Ludwig then readily reached out his hand to Bertus.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, Prince! Let\u2019s do our best together!\u201d\u201cOkay, Ludwig. Don\u2019t call me Prince. That\u2019s against the rules.\u201d\u201cYes! Bertus!\u201dBertus smiled kindly and took his hand. Everyone looked at that scene with even more astonishment. It\u2019s like witnessing a friendship that only had a 1% chance of happening, happening right in front of their eyes.The prince had a good personality as well.I felt like I could hear voices saying that from everywhere. After shaking hands with Bertus, Ludwig greeted the other children as well.\u201cOh, we meet again, Reinhardt\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do our best!\u201d\u201cOh, you too.\u201dLet\u2019s not stand out. Let\u2019s just show a neutral reaction.Erich shook hands with Ludwig, even though he was quite speechless. No. 10 Cayer just sighed in astonishment and took his hand.\u201c\u2026Hey, get out of here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cGet out of here. This is the Class A dormitory.\u201dHowever, No. 4 Harriet de Saint-Owan was blunt with Ludwig.\u201cAh, so\u2026. I, I can\u2019t come here?\u201dLudwig seemed embarrassed as he said that. Harriet sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t know about you not being allowed here.\u201dHarriet sighed again and pointed at the hallway Ludwig entered through.\u201cBut it feels bad. Some B Class person just wandering in and out of the A Class housing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, ah\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you understand, just go away already.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Ri, right. I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201dLudwig turned back with a puzzled expression.\u201cCome now. Aren\u2019t we all the same friends here?\u201dBertus appeared to rescue Ludwig from trouble. Harriet\u2019s face turned beet-red as she hadn\u2019t expected Bertus would step up.\u201cAh, tha\u2026. That\u2019s\u2026. Ah\u2026.\u201dHer bewilderment, fumbling for words, was a stark contrast to her previous venomous look she sent out before. I guess she never thought the prince would cover for that guy.Harriet de Saint-Owan.Princess of the Duchy Saint-Owan. As the princess of one of the Empire\u2019s duchies she had to make a good impression on the Prince.That guy was a commoner without a surname and he boldly dared to come here as a B Class student, so she got annoyed and lost her temper, however when Bertus stepped in she got very quiet.Bertus, of course, didn\u2019t reveal that he was a prince in the original, but he overwhelmed her with his atmosphere.It was amazing how the initial development was the same, even though some things changed.\u201cLudwig, we have some sensitive friends here, so let\u2019s be more careful in the future. If you have something to say to us, you can use the pager and if you don\u2019t know how to use it, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\u201cO, oh. Ehm\u2026. Thank you.\u201dBertus walked out of the lobby with a grinning, but slightly dazed Ludwig. Harriet\u2019s face was still red and she couldn\u2019t bring out a single word.She usually lived with her nose in the air, so she completely forgot that there was a Prince next to her. She only pretended to be calm, after all she only heard of Temple and this was her first day here.By the way, was it so scary to suddenly see someone from Class B here? Well, anyway even though she was kind of a jerk, she was still ranked fourth.Her main talent was \u2018Magic\u2019.If Weapon Mastery was a comprehensive talent, then \u2018Magic\u2019 was of the same type.There was a person in Class B who had the two magical talents \u2018Alchemy\u2019 and \u2018Enchantment\u2019. In comparison, that girl\u2019s comprehensive talent, Magic, was a huge upgrade to the talent the person from Class B had.In any case, she was gifted with the ability to be able to master all types of magic, regardless of school or field. She wasn\u2019t 4th ranked for nothing. Of course, knowing that there were still 3 more people above her was amazing in itself.\u201cThe Prince has a very good personality\u2026.\u201dErich was admiring him, calling Bertus Prince again without realizing.\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201dErich looked at me as if he was asking me to agree. Originally, he was supposed to ask someone else, wasn\u2019t he?\u201c..\u2026Yeah.\u201dLooking at it like that, no matter how rotten he was on the inside, he did seem to have a good personality on the outside. Even I who knew his true colors couldn\u2019t believe it.He was so good at pretending that he could even deceive me, the creator.That was quite the thing.[You have accomplished the achievement \u2018First day at Temple\u2019.][You have earned 100 achievement points.]I didn\u2019t know if it was because I saw the event with Ludwig or if this was a reward for safely passing the day, but I received some achievement points.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28I was returning to my room.Getting involved in major events, such as just now with Ludwig, seemed to earn me achievement points. Of course, regardless of that, I knew that I could earn some by completing challenges such as \u2018Slap the Emperor in the Face\u2019\u2026.But wasn\u2019t that just a bit unfair?I got 100 points for surviving and overcoming the risk of death, and yet I got 100 points just because Ludwig was getting humiliated in the same place I was at? Wasn\u2019t that completely insane?Were they telling me that my life was on the same level as Ludwig getting called a dog?While I was musing over the amount of achievement points earned, no message popped up. I guessed they must have their own rules. Just thinking about that made me feel tired.Most of the main story took place in Class B and its dormitory or classroom, so Class A could almost be considered a vestige of the main story. That meant, it was mostly filled with things I was unfamiliar with.When I returned to my room, I filled out the blank name spaces based on the names I heard in the self-introduction.Class 1-A.I couldn\u2019t remember all their talents. There were also some people I completely forgot.1 \u2013 Bertus de Gardias (Swordmaster, Villain)2 \u2013 Ellen Artorius (Munchkin)3 \u2013 Marianna de Grantz (Electrokinesis)4 \u2013 Harriet de Saint-Owan (Magic)5 \u2013 Cliffman (Something having to do with close quarter combat.)6 \u2013 Heinrich von Schwarz (Pyrokinesis)7 \u2013 Adelia (Something on the Magic side)8 \u2013 Kono Lint (Teleportation)9 \u2013 Erich de Lafaeri (Lackey 1, somehow will become Paladin?)10 \u2013 Cayer Voiden (Lackey 2, early game villain. Can\u2019t remember more.)11 \u2013 MeAnd Class B.1 \u2013 Charlotte de Gardias (Unknown)2 \u2013 Louis Ancton (Smart. Nerd)3 \u2013 Scarlet (Supernatural power, immune to magic.)4 \u2013 Ashir (Divine power\u2026 Probably?)5 \u2013 Christina (Alchemy, Enchantment.)6 \u2013 Anna de Gerna (Black magic, not a bad girl.)7 \u2013 Ibia (Telepathy)8 \u2013 Destomolian (Witchcraft, Supernatural power, savage bastard.)9 \u2013 Delphine Izadra (Archery)10 \u2013 Lanian Sessor (Music)11 \u2013 Ludwig (Stamina, munchkin pretending to be weak, main character)Although I didn\u2019t have any detailed knowledge about a lot of the talents, I was roughly able to sort things out, as hearing their names kind of made me remember some things.Who I had to remember weren\u2019t the original main characters anyway. Most of the people I would run into were the Class A kids.Anyway, unlike in the original, Charlotte and I were added, so there were 22 students.Among them I had not a single clue what talent Charlotte had. What kind of talent would she have? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the same as Bertus\u2019? Since they were family, there was a good chance that they might have the same talents.However, now wasn\u2019t the time to deal with Charlotte.I got 100 points for escaping the Demon King\u2019s Castle.Then I earned 1000 points for saving Charlotte.After that I used \u2018A Writer\u2019s Advice\u2019 twice, spending 150 points each, so 300 points.And just then I got 100 points as a reward.I had a total of 900 achievement points available to me.To give myself a talent with achievement points, I needed at least 1000 points.[Swordsmanship \u2013 1000 Points][Archery \u2013 1000 Points][Magic Sensitivity \u2013 1000 Points]...In fact, this was an incredible ability. Bertus had to endure enormous pain undergoing that huge procedure to acquire three talents. However, I could just get talents by using achievement points.Of course, achievement point costs would be subject to change.Maybe after I get my first talent, the second one might be more expensive. It was a pity that I didn\u2019t know how expensive they would get.If I get 100 more points, I would be able to get my first talent, unless the prices suddenly changed.There were obviously some incredibly powerful talents. For example, those comprehensive talents.[Weapon Mastery \u2013 10000 Points][Magic \u2013 20000 Points]One of Ellen\u2019s many talents, Weapon Mastery, required 10000 Points, and Harriet\u2019s Magic required 20000 Points. I could save up my points and then put them into one of those talents, but who knew how many years it would take until I got that many points saved up. I wasn\u2019t even sure if the price would still be the same at that time.When swordsmanship reached its peak, there were some cases where it evolved into Weapon Mastery, but what was with this?And Weapon Mastery and magic, swordsmanship included, could only create enormous synergy if there were other talents supporting them. Most of them had to be backed by magic related talents.In the case of Magic, even if one had that talent, one couldn\u2019t learn any if one didn\u2019t possess magic sensitivity, magic aptitude and, most importantly, a great deal of intelligence.I wanted to become a wizard the most. It was safe and powerful.However, would I be able to master the science of magic filled with technical terms that would make my head spin? Even if my talents for magic were fully developed, there was a strong possibility that I wasn\u2019t able to understand the science behind it.Or could I become a wizard after I upgraded my brain by getting learning-related talents? I\u2019d love to have a talent that would make me smarter, but\u2026.Under the premise that I want to become a wizard, I would need at least four lesser talents to meet the requirements. One talent for the corresponding magic system, magic sensitivity, mana control and brain reinforcement.It would be nice to get all that before I die of old age.In the end, there was only one answer.A Supernatural ability.Supernatural powers could exert their strength with only one talents. A-3 had Electrokinesis and A-6 had Pyrokinesis.However, there was a problem with supernatural abilities.At a lower level, the abilities were either too weak or not controllable. In other words, it was difficult to make use of them whenever one needed them. Therefore, those who used supernatural powers had to develop them through continuous training and control. Just like others had to do swordsmanship training or magic research.But in the end, it would be better to dig the well early than uselessly dream of becoming a wizard by saving hard on my achievement points of which I didn\u2019t know when I would get some.Swordsmanship could evolve into Weapon Mastery and if one studied various schools of magic, those who originally didn\u2019t have the Magic talent could develop it.Some talents evolved. Especially supernatural abilities tended to do so. The reason for that was, as one became able to control one\u2019s ability and one\u2019s understanding of it deepend, one could discover the hidden aspects of the ability.A-3, who utilizes electricity, would later be able to use a power stronger than what she was able to use now, and A-6, who used flames, would later be able to ignite things without combustion..If I were to buy a talent using my achievement points it should be something one wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain through normal means. With all my aptitudes, I could just acquire those normal talents by doing some repetitive training. The problem was that I didn\u2019t know how long it would take though.Supernatural powers couldn\u2019t be obtained through effort, regardless of one\u2019s inadequacies or aptitudes. However, I could buy supernatural powers with my achievement points.It might not be useful right away, but it had a strong potential for growth.So, there was no other option for me other than supernatural powers.So which supernatural power should I choose\u2026.? At the lowest level it wouldn\u2019t be of much help anyway.I had to decide based on future developments.It was quite funny that I was planning away the 100 achievement points I hadn\u2019t even received yet.Let\u2019s go to sleep.* * *On the next day was the entrance ceremony. The entrance ceremony was held for children who had entered the higher education course in Temples gigantic square. The sight of more than 10000 students having their entrance ceremony here was truly breathtaking.Setting up that there was an entrance ceremony itself seemed like a pretty unreasonable move on my part. When one gathered tens of thousands of children in one place, it would naturally create some world chattering noise.However, the Royal Class\u2019 entrance ceremony was held separately.The reason for that seemed to be to make the Royal Class children focus on their work rather than get dragged to some large scale events. I didn\u2019t even bother explaining that bit.Come to think of it. making those other kids uncomfortable while giving us this comfort seemed pretty much like discrimination, didn\u2019t it? They basically put on some frivolous show, making the other students quite exhausted, while they kept the privileged away from it.That\u2019s how it was.I felt my face turn red in embarrassment at how carelessly I wrote these things. It was an entrance ceremony for only 22 students, so the procedure was rather simple. Even with the Prince and Princess there, it didn\u2019t seem much different.The attendance ended with the introduction of the general teachers of the Royal Class, that is, the principal and the people who will be in charge of us in the future.Then we were led to the class building dedicated to the Royal Class close to the dormitories and were told to sit in our classroom. That fast pace wasn\u2019t all that bad.Class A\u2019s homeroom teacher, Epinhauser.Unlike Class B\u2019s homeroom teacher, Mr. Mustrang, he had a very business-like, cold personality.He was looking at us with a stiff expression on his face. He was that type of person that thought he was the only smart guy in the room, so he was treating us no different from ordinary students.\u201cOn Mondays and Thursdays, we will have a common class in this classroom.\u201d\u201cOn Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you can take the classes you requested. The lecture list and their outlines are all written on the document distributed. Students who do not know how to proceed, come to me separately. You might not know which classes to take.\u201d\u201cYou children have great talent, but do not be fooled into thinking that you are geniuses in every field. What I\u2019m meaning to say is, don\u2019t try to take classes you won\u2019t be able to understand yet.\u201d\u201cNo. 1, you shall be the temporary class leader. If you want to replace your class leader, report to me after you do. Most things I have to tell you will be communicated through No. 1.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even call the Prince by his name and some of the students were rather taken aback at how casually he referred to him, but Bertus didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201cAlso, if you believe I might be of help with any grievances, problems or quarrel, please ask for help.\u201d\u201cAnd, if there is a big fight, call me immediately, and while I wish to prevent any student from getting killed as much as possible, I cannot say that it never happened. So that you can be more cautious of each other, you have to know each other\u2019s talents, so we created a list. Check it out later.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was muttering some words with bloody content quite casually, like a narration. Someone raised their hand at that cruel closing remark.\u201cWhat would happen if you page a teacher when there\u2019s a big fight?\u201dNo. 8, Kono Lint. He probably was curious. I knew the reason he asked as well.If we were to fight among ourselves , would that be a problem that could just be resolved by getting a teacher involved?That seemed to be his question. It kind of showed his confidence orrather arrogance.Mr. Epinhauser seemed familiar with that question as well.\u201cYou are under special supervision and valuable talents of the Empire, but you may also hold the power to endanger yourself and others.\u201dMr. Epinhauser explained calmly.\u201cAs a teacher of the Royal Class, I have the authority to take emergency measures in case something like that were to happen.\u201d\u201cEmergency?\u201d\u201cIt means that if the situation is not favorable, the student can be promptly disposed of.\u201dThose words chilled the atmosphere in the classroom.This place only held precious people with great talent.And here someone was, standing right before them, telling them, if something goes wrong, he can kill them. He spoke calmly as if what he just said was a matter of course.\u201cAre you capable of that?\u201dNo. 10, Cayer Vioden remarked rather sarcastically. Mr Epinhauser didn\u2019t react much to that obvious sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years now.\u201dThis time no one dared to say anything sarcastically again.No, well, they probably were scared because they were kids.But why was I also scared? Why? Was I too old? Did I maybe grow soft? Was it because this was just too cruel? Can a teacher even do that?Contrary to that atmosphere.-Wahahahaha!One could hear laughter from the next classroom. It was Class B.\u201cThen I hope you have understood my words and be careful.\u201dHowever, there was no laughter to be found in Class A.\u201cAnd No. 11.\u201dHuh?\u201cYou follow me.\u201dHuh? Me? Why so suddenly?I didn\u2019t really expect that development, you know?Teacher?* * *The classroom building for common education was built right next to the Royal Class\u2019 dormitory, so there was no need to go around the entire Temple on the days of common education.About 100 students were getting educated there, but the building was slightly smaller than other Temple buildings. There, not only teachers, but also faculty and other personnel were second only in number to the students.\u2026However,\u00a0 I just set it up like that, I actually had no idea what they were doing.There were dozens of people in the first year teacher\u2019s office, excluding the homeroom teacher. I wasn\u2019t sure if all of them were teachers, but I was pretty sure that the other year\u2019s teacher\u2019s offices looked the same.Certainly, the number of students and staff should be about equal or even greater.Mr. Epinhauser took me to his private room and instructed me to sit down in front of him.I felt like a patient who just came to the hospital after being diagnosed with a serious illness waiting for some bad news.I wasn\u2019t really sure, but I felt like I was in some sort of trouble.He rummaged through some papers and talked to me without looking at me.\u201cNo. 11, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cYea- Yes.\u201dHe looked at me calmly.\u201cYou have a lot of aptitudes, but no talent, correct?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026. Yes.\u201dWhy was he talking to me as if I was a beggar?He was cruel and cold-hearted, but I didn\u2019t set him up to be human trash, though?\u201cWhat classes are you going to take?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes?\u201dSomething completely unexpected came out of Epinhauser\u2019s mouth. He put a document down in front of me. Each student\u2019s profile was organized there.The document he presented to me was the profile of No. 3, Marianna de Grantz.\u201cNo.3, Grantz, a holder of supernatural powers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dWhat about it? He rummaged through the papers and showed me another page.\u201cThis is No. 5.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cCliffman is a Combat talent.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSo what? While I was having such thoughts while looking at him, Mr. Epinhauser was just staring at me silently. His eyes were scary.So there were people in this world that could scold someone with just their eyes.\u201cStudents with supernatural powers usually sign up for special lectures on meditation and psychic control. There aren\u2019t many with supernatural abilities, so they need specialized lectures like that.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take any of those lectures through, now do you, No. 11?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026. Well.\u201dI didn\u2019t know about later, but I didn\u2019t think I needed to take them for now.\u201cCliffman is a combat talent. It is rather rare. Hand to Hand Combat, Gladiator, Martial Arts, Archery\u2026 They say it encompasses all kinds of combat talents.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe showed talent in everything to do with the way of battle. Cliffman only had one talent, but in terms of just that one talent, it was a comprehensive talent far superior to Weapon Mastery.\u201cNo. 5 who is a combat talent, will take lectures centered on physical training, weapon skills and sparring. Do you agree?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOh man, I now knew what he was talking about.\u201cYour other classmates have a set direction how they want to specialize. They roughly know what they need to learn and what classes to take.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut No. 11, you have aptitudes in all fields, but nothing you excel in.\u201dI knew he wasn\u2019t trying to scold me, but I sure felt like he was.\u201cYou probably have no idea what you need to learn. Correct?\u201dHe seemed to think that I needed help.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29He was a teacher. Most students had specific aptitudes and talents, so one didn\u2019t have to tell them what they had to study. It was his job to just look over the list of courses the students chose and give a few words.However, from his point of view, it would be the first time having a student like me. A weird student who could do everything but wasn\u2019t specifically good at anything.\u201cYou can do anything within the curriculum supported by Temple. However if you try to do everything, you would gain nothing.\u201dSo, Epinhauser brought me to the teacher\u2019s office in case I would get overly greedy and tried to do something absurd. To prevent a situation like me trying to learn everything but ending up with nothing.What a good teacher.\u201cAptitude and talent did not always determine if it was suitable for one or not. I\u2019ve seen people who had a talent in magic but absolutely hated magic, and there were people who had great talent in swordsmanship, but would immediately faint as soon as a sword got pointed at them.\u201dA talent for swordsmanship didn\u2019t automatically give one fighting spirit, and a talent for magic didn\u2019t automatically give one the desire to research and explore magic.That\u2019s what one might call the blind spot of talent.Mr. Epinhauser was already telling me a problem that would only occur after the beginning part.In the end, what was important was one\u2019s own mentality, one\u2019s interest in it and if one could apply it in practice. If one were forced to train in a certain field because one found a talent in you early on, one might come to loath that talent itself and one might just end up collapsing in a situation where one\u2019s life is at stake.What good would being talented in swordsmanship do, if you were afraid of violence itself?That\u2019s what he meant.\u201cSo, you are better off than those guys at least. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to do anything because you don\u2019t have a talent that\u2019s restricting you. You can do whatever you want.\u201dEventually, he asked me what I wanted to do. I decided on that yesterday.\u201cI want to learn about supernatural powers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFor the first time today, his face showed some emotions.He was clearly pitying me.He looked at my profile and remained silent for a while.\u201cI heard that you have so many aptitudes that it just got shortened to a single line.\u201dThey weren\u2019t able to write all my aptitudes down on paper. That was why they just summed it up in a single line: \u2018Has aptitudes in all fields\u2019. If they actually tried to document all of them, they\u2019d waste a huge amount of paper.\u201cDo you also have aptitude for supernatural abilities?\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201dMaybe I had it or maybe I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t really explain it to him.\u201cSo, let\u2019s just say you do, how do you plan on awakening such supernatural powers?\u201d\u201c\u2026By trying my best?\u201dI couldn\u2019t exactly tell him that I could use achievement points to awaken them, so I said that, but that kind of made him look at me as if I was trying to break a rock with an egg.\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything else you want to focus on other than supernatural powers? Put simply, people who do not have supernatural abilities cannot attend those special lectures.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a bit different for students of Royal Class, but the teacher in charge will find that very strange. There might also be the possibility that they will kick you out.\u201dI nodded and told him that I would bear the full responsibility if I would get kicked out.He agonized for a long time and eventually began to write something down on a paper.\u201cApply for this class, I will inform the teacher separately.\u201dHe seemed to think that I should realize on my own what nonsense I was trying to do.\u201cInstead, we shall keep it at a single lecture.\u201dHe wrote down this and that, saying that he would not introduce any other supernatural power-related lectures to me.After writing some things down in a flash he handed me the paper.\u201cThis is your schedule for the semester. If you put anything else in it, I will not accept it.\u201dApparently he made a schedule for me instead.\u201cWhat lectures are these?\u201d\u201cRather than just focusing on that single subject, I\u2019d like you to do it like this. You\u2019ll be able to find something fitting.\u201dHe told me I could do anything I wanted at first.When he realized that I wanted to focus on something as bizarre as supernatural powers, he asked me to choose something I\u2019d like to do other than that. So rather than spending this semester on just supernatural powers, he told me I should try other lectures as well to find something I liked. It was common sense that it was impossible to awaken supernatural powers just through effort.In other words, that was the right judgement here, so I couldn\u2019t say anything against it.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It went without saying that just joining all the supernatural power classes wasn\u2019t a good idea. In fact, it might not be possible for me to fill the entire semester with just lectures related to supernatural powers, and I also wanted to see how the lectures of each major that I only roughly described in my novel went about things.So I just went back to Class A\u2019s classroom where no teacher was present. There I found nearly all the children, except a few, gathering around a bulletin board.As soon as I went through the door all of their eyes turned to me.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy were they staring at me like that?The gazes from the guys gathered around the bulletin board were lukewarm. Rather than filled with mixed hostility, their gazes held curiosity and incomprehension.\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have any talent, do you?\u201dIt was No. 10 Cayer Vioden who said these words. It was then that I realized why the kids were crowding around the bulletin board like that.Mr. Epinhauser posted each students profile on the bulletin board. They were posted with the intentions of getting to know each other\u2019s talents so that everyone knew what to be careful of.Of course, Ellen\u2019s tremendous talents weren\u2019t all written down, so she didn\u2019t get much attention.There probably were some kids who were curious what talents the others held, so they found out that the bottom ranked No. 11 only had aptitudes and no talents.So they found it weird.\u201cYeah, so what?\u201dIt was true, so I didn\u2019t have anything else to say to him. I just went back to my seat and sat down. My seat was on the far left in the second row near the window, as the tables were arranged by numerical order. The classroom was spacious so there was no need for us to share desks. I had this huge desk all to myself.I tried to get rid of them, but these strange gazes seemed to follow me. Bertus was also looking at me with a strange smile on his face.\u201cNo, hey. How does that make any sense?\u201dCayer came to my seat as if he didn\u2019t understand this at all.\u201cThis is the Royal Class, a place not everyone can enter, even if they have a talent. How did you get into this place, which required one to have exceptional talent? What\u2019s more into Class A? Shouldn\u2019t you be at least in Class B?\u201dI did set him up to be someone with a strong personality, but I didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d come at me like that on the first day of class.Cayer really didn\u2019t understand and to him my existence on its own seemed ridiculous. He seemed very angry. How should I even respond to this? He was ready to grab my collar and no one seemed to want to stop him.Bertus seemed to be just watching the situation.\u201cI seriously don\u2019t understand. Hey. What are you? How could someone like you be here?\u201d\u201cHey you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u2026What?\u201dI wanted to act more mature. To be honest, how old was I to be overreacting over something like a kid badgering me?I didn\u2019t want to stand out.I didn\u2019t mean to.But, so what.\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, go ask the admissions office for all I care.\u201dSeeing this situation happen right in front of my eyes, I snapped back a bit.Seeing me reacting not as he expected, Cayer\u2019s complexion drastically changed.\u201cY, you punk, you, just now\u2026. What\u2026. H, how dare you not have any talent and\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me about the decision the admissions office made? Do you think I came through some back door? Huh? I just came here because they sent me here, like you. Who do you think you are? And what do you mean with \u2018How dare I\u2019? Are you the admissions examiner or the head of the admissions office?\u201d\u201cNo. This\u2026.\u201d\u201cHah, are you the head of the admissions office?\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d\u201cHah, are or aren\u2019t you the head of the admissions office? You bastard! Yes or no?\u201d-Clatter!He was startled as I jumped up from my seat and approached him. He began to retreat step by step.\u201cAre or aren\u2019t you? What\u2019s taking you so long? Huh?\u201d\u201cN, no\u2026. I\u2026 am not.\u201d\u201cSo why are you meddling in this?\u201dHe was definitely so scared that his face turned blue.\u201cHey, Number 10. Number 10 who has this huge magical talent but can\u2019t feel mana for shit.\u201d\u201cA,ah\u2026.\u201dOne didn\u2019t have to be talented to be a jerk. Did you avoid poop because you were afraid of it? No, you avoid it because it\u2019s dirty. I couldn\u2019t become some scary guy right now, so I had to become a dirty bastard so that one wouldn\u2019t want to touch me.That guy in front of me wasn\u2019t even talented in combat anyway.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just treat each other well, huh?\u201d-Thump\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer?\u201dWhen I opened my eyes and stared at him, his complexion turned as white as a sheet of paper, then he slightly nodded.\u201cA, ah\u2026.\u201dI patted that naughty bastard on the cheek and sat back down. The atmosphere around my classmates watching the scene was chilly.I was tired.Like that I would be branded as some dirty bastard, who didn\u2019t even have an ability.But I wasn\u2019t wrong you know? I was sent here by the admissions office, you know?Afterwards.I really didn\u2019t want to stand out, but here I was standing out faster than lightning.I could foresee a dark future for my school days.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Thanks to No. 10 getting things turned on him while he was trying to pick a fight with me, no one else tired. They must have been shocked seeing a crazy person acting like a jerk, not in the least intimidated by his lack of talent.They just heard from the teacher that they might get killed if they use their ability first so only a completely crazy guy would have the guts to do anything. If he wasn\u2019t that than he was just totally ignorant. Well, something like that certainly would happen again in the future.Class B was a very friendly class. Sometimes one could hear laughter drifting over from there, but Class A was deathly silent. Except for the sound of pens moving, the teachers\u2019 lecture and the questions asked from time to time, it was completely devoid of laughter.Originally, this place was supposed to be a gathering of only that kind of people, but I couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the thought that the atmosphere of horror I created for no good reason must have played a part in this.Damn it, I seriously got angry at a kid. I\u2019m the worst kind of human being.I sat in class feeling shame.Common classes were like general classes that everyone had to take.For example, classes such as history, geography, mathematics, literature and ethics. Each teacher was in charge of a different subject, perhaps it was set that the homeroom teacher wasn\u2019t in charge of any classes.During the brief break between classes and the end of them, the children seemed to be chatting with each other, slowly getting to know each other.\u2013 You have aptitude for magic? What classes are you going to take?-Well\u2026. I\u2019m not sure yet.-Then would you like to ask our teacher what to take?-Huh? Ah, that\u2026. Well\u2026. Hm.-Royal Class seems to have exclusive lectures different from other general class kids. \u00a0Maybe we could just get a lecture for just the two of us.-Oh\u2026. Really?Kids with similar talents seemed to want to apply for the same classes. On the day you self-applied for a lecture, you would have to listen to the lecture with general class students, so they wanted to have one more person they knew as psychological crutch.So on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, people talented in combat would join combat classes, people talented in magic would attend magic classes and people with supernatural abilities would join classes for supernatural ability users. In the case of people talented in divine power, they tended to attend combat lectures as they often had another combat talent.And so, everyone was talking about what to apply for, others thought about it on their own. That was how the class time passed.Lunch time.Since there were only about 100 people in the Royal Class, all years ate lunch in a large restaurant. There was no need to stand in line with a plate in hand, and one could just take along whatever one wanted to eat.It was natural that senior students were also mixed in the crowd, but the zones were implicitly divided. Some seats were reserved for first years, others for second years and so on. Of course both classes A and B were mixed together, hence they had to eat in the same place.Class A gathered around Bertus and had a meal. He seemed like a good-natured person, so maybe he already gained some followers.Class B was no different.-Hey, Charlotte, try this. It\u2019s so delicious.-Ah\u2026. Ah, No, thank you. I don\u2019t like oily things.Class B was centered around Charlotte, but the reason seemed to be a different one.-You have to eat a lot to be healthy!-Do you dislike vegetables?She was kidnapped to the Demon King\u2019s Castle and entered Temple shortly after returning. So it seemed like everyone was worried about Charlotte\u2019s health. Not only that, but even her seniors were looking at the princess with pity.They were clamoring to take care of Charlotte with Ludwig at the forefront, while Charlotte seemed to struggle dealing with this situation.I set up Class B to have a friendly atmosphere, but even with Charlotte added, the atmosphere remained friendly and the reason for that was Ludwig. He was a typical manga protagonist type character with an optimistic, friendly and energetic personality.I didn\u2019t have much contact with people like that, but I feel like I didn\u2019t really like people like that.Even though there were so many open seats, Class A gathered around Bertus and Class B gathered around Charlotte.And then there were five people eating on their own, as if trying to keep their distance from each other, including myself, who had a bit of an incident this morning.A-2 Ellen Artorius.A-5 Cliffman.A-11 Yours truly.B-2 Louis Ankton.B-3 Scarlett.Were all outsiders, introverts trying to keep their distance?All the outsiders, including me, were eating silently.-I\u2019m going to have an upset stomach\u2026.Charlotte\u2019s melancholic voice sounded strangely sentimental.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Most of the general classes were decent enough. This was supposed to be my first year of high school and I didn\u2019t know this world\u2019s common sense too well, but it was understandable.The Royal Class was a place where people with outstanding talents gathered, but that didn\u2019t mean they were all smart. Rather, there were some guys sleeping in class. Those with good brains were completely focused, even some of the guys with physical talents managed to concentrate. But there were a lot of guys who were just average and some who didn\u2019t even attend, because they were kids. This class\u2019 students were chosen based on talent not on intelligence.However, for me, who had already finished my education before, these classes were usually either boringly easy or just reliant on memorization.By the way.-Run! Don\u2019t stop! Jump!\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201d\u201cI, I ca, can\u2019t anymore\u2026.\u201d\u201cWheeze\u2026. Wheeze\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to do this?!\u201d-Your middle school days are over! \u00a0There\u2019ll be no one consoling you anymore if you\u2019re throw a tantrum!As for the physical training classes, I was literally sweating blood. We had to do this cycle of physical training exercises that were close to corporal punishment.\u2013 Magic, supernatural power, studying and physical training must not be neglected. You are the future of the empire. If you do not meet a certain level of physical fitness by the end of this semester, I will fail you! Keep that in mind!It was an illusion that it was okay for wizards to be weak.If one relies too much on their supernatural power, one would get hurt someday.He who lacks stamina, won\u2019t be able to study properly.It was obviously me who wrote these sentences. Therefore, regardless of major, one had to conduct physical training during the common classes. There was no such thing as a major that would allow one to be weak after all.So it was said that children who had non-combat talents hated this class the most.It\u2019s like I\u2019m getting punished for my own words right now.-Hey, you there! Don\u2019t walk!\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dAs I was receiving that high-intensity physical training now, I almost felt like throwing up the food I had not too long ago.-Run! I\u2019ve never seen anyone die from running! Hey, I can\u2019t see you over there! Look at that!Where the p.e. teacher was pointing was a guy that was running at a constant speed from start to finish.-Tok, tok, tok, tok!He was also sprinting at that, saying some refreshing words as he passed by me.\u201cCheer up, Reinhardt!\u201c\u201cI, I\u2019m going crazy\u2026.\u201dIt was Ludwig.P.E. was one of the classes Class A and B took together.That guy had only one talent.Stamina.All physical abilities were ranked according to a system. I reconfirmed the settings I made in the past by looking at the rank classification criteria written next to the physical data table of my classmates.0~4 (F Rank)5~7 (D Rank)8~13 (C Rank)14~19 (B Rank)20~30 (A Rank)31~35 (S Rank)36~40 (S+ Rank)In addition to that, there was an SS Rank, but having that specification was rather meaningless. Beyond that, would represent a superhuman\u2019s level of strength. Of course there were some who would reach that level.F~D Ranks corresponded to the lower grades.C Rank corresponded to intermediate level.B Rank corresponded to advanced, and beyond that, growth was extremely slow. Unless one was born with a certain type of physique, one might face the limits of one\u2019s growth there. No matter how hard one tried, one might not be able to reach A Rank.In other words, it is said that A Rank would be almost the limit a human being could reach. If one reached something like the A+ Rank that might already be the limit.From S Rank up, it was clearly at the level of a super human. Ordinary training alone wouldn\u2019t get one there.Ludwig\u2019s stamina is 30, which corresponded to A+ Rank.The average stamina someone our age normally had was D Rank, meaning 6~7, while that guy\u2019s stamina was already at 30. He was a nutcase who had the physical strength of humanity\u2019s top athletes. That was Ludwig.That was his only talent and specialty.\u201cWha, what kind of monster is he\u2026.\u201dMy other classmates had their mouths wide open when they saw Ludwig\u2019s crazy stamina. I didn\u2019t feel any jealousy or admiration towards that guy for being faster than me.I think I was just going to die that instant. Should I keep doing this? For the whole semester? Every time we had common classes? Twice a week?I was worried whether it would be okay to choose a supernatural power as my first talent or if I should choose stamina first. After all, that guy was just as fast on his feet as Ellen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-Pak!Ellen Artorius, who also ran at a constant tempo without any disturbance, passed me as well.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The P.E. class that turned people into super humans included not only running but also strength training. There was no distinction made between men and women. There were only five people who were able to stand properly: Class A No. 2 Ellen, No.1 Bertus, No. 5 Cliffman, Class B No. 3 Scarlett and No. 11 Ludwig.Everyone else made noises like zombies. there were some kids even crying.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to cry then you\u2019re still pretty energetic!\u201dHowever, the P.E. teacher, who looked like a demon from hell, was merciless.There was just one person standing beside him.Charlotte de Gardias watched us withering away like that.The P.E. teacher excluded her from training because she was still weak and needed absolute rest. She must have gone through a lot of hardship already in the Demon King\u2019s Castle, so no one objected.Students and teachers were amazed at how well she was taking classes.Even on the verge of death, my eyes were drawn to Charlotte. What kind of talent did she have? It must have been written on Class B\u2019s bulletin board, but I didn\u2019t want to attract more attention by checking it.Charlotte was just watching what we were doing. She faced a life or death crisis once, even though we faced it together that time.I realized again that I had no idea what personality Charlotte de Gardias actually had. It was because the personality she held during the crisis and her personality now seemed distinctly different.\u201cHe, hey! It\u2019s too fast! I can\u2019t count!\u201d\u201cHoo! Hoo! Hoo!\u201dNext to me, Ludwig was doing sit-ups at lightning speed and the child holding his legs and counting across from him was crying. Maybe because he was from Class B but I wasn\u2019t familiar with his face, so I couldn\u2019t remember his name.Now I knew for sure.It was the same with Sarkegaar.I hated these energetic guys.* * *After the two-hours of hellish P.E. classes, everyone washed up in the shower and changed their clothes.\u201cWhy are the showers and changing rooms integrated?\u201dErich de Lafaeri grumbled loudly.The shower facilities themselves were impeccable. Although men and women got divided it was used by both classes. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s changing rooms and shower rooms were shared by Class A and B.He was complaining about that.I didn\u2019t even care about that as I felt like my soul was leaving my body. Except for those who had a certain level of stamina, there were some who collapsed to the floor altogether.A-8 Kono Lint was murmuring blankly.\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem\u2026. We have to do this again on Thursday\u2026.\u201d\u2013 Aaaaarg\u2026.Regardless of class, moans and groans of lamentation flowed out of nearly everyone\u2019s mouth. Everyone had to go through the same hardships again, so who cared about that single detail.Worked to death on Monday, rest two days, then get worked to death again on Thursday. Yes, there certainly was an intention behind that.-Hit!\u201c\u2026.\u2026What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201dWhen I was getting angry at myself for writing such a dog-like novel and hit my head, everyone was looking at me with strange expressions.Anyway, sorry guys.However, I ran into a problem while changing clothes in the changing room.\u201cHey, Number 11.\u201d\u201c.\u2026What?\u201dCayer Vioden spoke to me. I was still in pain and felt like dying, so what problem did that idiot have with me now?\u201cYou\u2019re not in particularly good shape, are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026What about it?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what the hell he was thinking, but he also seemed to be on the verge of dying because of how tired he felt. He wasn\u2019t particularly good physically either.\u201cHey, are you any good at fighting? Huh?\u201dWhat was with that childish quarrel. I guess he acted like that because he got scared after I acted a bit like a jerk.That was why his pride got hurt, so seeing me struggling during P.E., he seemed to think that I wasn\u2019t that much different from him. That was why he gained some confidence and started picking a fight with me in the changing room while I was tired.The men\u2019s only changing room.What a good place to fight for one\u2019s pride.\u201cI\u2019m not good at it.\u201dI couldn\u2019t get mad at this guy again, so I would just put up with his antics for now. To be honest, I regretted my actions earlier.\u201cSo what gives you such confidence then? Huh?\u201dAh, he\u2019s so childish, it felt like goosebumps ran up my neck and back. Was I too old for this? What gives you the confidence? What the hell was with that?I was just speechless and didn\u2019t feel like answering.\u201cFucking with me again\u2026. Hah, what weird nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\u201cFucking with you? Be respectful. Huh? Aren\u2019t you just a bitch?\u201d-Tap!Cayer tapped me on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhy, wanna try me again? Huh? Go ahead. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s ridiculous for a bastard like you to come to Class A. Huh? What kind of trick did you use? Huh? A guy with no talent? Did you bribe them with money?\u201d-TapIt seemed like that guy wouldn\u2019t step down to heal his damaged ego. I hurt his pride more than I thought.I had to admit that I was being pretty impatient at that moment.\u201cArg!\u201d-Thud!I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and threw him down. He was in a pretty weakened state so I could do it easily.The guy who fell over in an instant looked up at me in puzzlement.It was quite funny actually.The students of the Royal Class were chosen by talent.It was completely different from the Orbis Class, which used the exact opposite methode to choose its members.In other words, those guys weren\u2019t that skilled.\u201cThere are children who understand things they are told immediately, and then there are brats who first need a beating to understand.\u201dI had two fights with the same guy on my first day at Temple.\u201cI think you\u2019re a brat.\u201d-Pow!\u201cArg!\u201d\u201cLet me give you that beating.\u201dI kicked the guy who fell to the floor in the stomach.The Royal Class didn\u2019t have anyone who was as skilled as they were proud.There were a lot of students who put a lot of faith in their talent and didn\u2019t bother putting in any effort.That was the weak point of the Royal Class. The students were selected by talent and they wouldn\u2019t fail if they didn\u2019t decide to drop out themselves.Like that guy in front of me, there were people who considered themselves to be part of a very privileged class. In fact they didn\u2019t have anything else to show for themselves.Just some garbage with nothing else to offer but being part of the Royal Class.I trampled on Cayer\u2019s face.-Stop!\u201cUrggg!\u201d-Bang!\u201cCough!\u201dI kicked him in the head.Strong bastards didn\u2019t really have to be strong.-Boom!\u201cArgh!\u201dThere were several types of bullies, but when it came to fighting, there were two types you absolutely shouldn\u2019t touch.One who\u2019s good at fighting.Or one who\u2019s a completely crazy bastard.If you touched someone who was good at fighting, you\u2019d obviously get beat up if you touch them.But it was a bit different in the case of a crazy bastard.People shouldn\u2019t touch someone like that because they wouldn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do. There were guys who\u2019d really hit someone over the head with a chair, you know?I couldn\u2019t fight well, so I chose the latter option to not get trampled over.A person who could act strong was indeed strong. One just had to show some guy, who\u2019s all talk, that you yourself are not.I was going to act like that while everyone was watching.All I had to show them is that if you touch me for no good reason your life might get seriously endangered.I wasn\u2019t strong. I couldn\u2019t even be strong yet.But I could be cruel.Body data and rankings don\u2019t show everything.That\u2019s why I had to show them.-Pow!When I stepped on his face again, someone caught me as if they felt something unusual from me as well.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cWhy, why are you doing this?!\u201dLudwig and Bertus took me away from him.\u201cUh, urgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, if you\u2019re so confident in yourself, try me again, why don\u2019t you?\u201dI spoke to Cayer as I was dragged away by Bertus and Ludwig.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you then.\u201dCayer, who lay collapsed on the floor, couldn\u2019t even look at me.* * *\u201cYou fought?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe hit me first!\u201dIn the end, we were dragged before Mr. Epinhauser due to our fistfight. To be exact, Ludwig and Bertus said something like: \u201cLet\u2019s keep this between us, make up and move on\u201d, but someone went ahead and told the teacher.I didn\u2019t know who tipped him off, but I knew these guys\u2019 attributes. I wrote down certain characteristics and personality traits for them. And I remembered all their names I had forgotten after the introduction ceremony yesterday.Someone who had the attributes of a tattle tale.It had to be B-2 Louis Ankton.Anyway, he must have rushed to tell someone about the fight and Mr. Mustrang was coincidentally in Class A so it got passed on to Mr. Epinhauser, so we were dragged to his private room.\u201cGetting into fights from day one, are we?\u201d\u201cHe hit me first! Oh, and he swore at me this morning!\u201dCayer, who had a stiff, unhappy expression on his face, began to argue that it was all my fault.He seemed to have forgotten how I beat him up in the dressing room.He felt wronged that I hit him, but seemed to have found this to be a great opportunity to get me kicked out. He wanted the teacher to protect him.\u201cIt\u2019s all his fault\u2026.\u201d\u201cSilence.\u201dEpinhauser looked at Cayer with a cool expression.\u201cYou\u2019re noisy No. 10\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk when I haven\u2019t asked you to.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201dCayer, who was very scared, answered in a withered, quiet voice. Epinhauser\u2019s eyes had such a stillness to them that it felt down right creepy when he looked at you.I knew he wasn\u2019t a bad person, but this atmosphere sure made me feel nervous.\u201cNo. 11.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd him calling students by their number rather than their names felt like he was trying to keep a certain distance from them.\u201cDid you hit him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy did you hit him?\u201dHe asked me while wearing a very curious expression on his face.\u201cCayer made statements that undermined Temple\u2019s authority.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about!\u201dEpinhauser and even Cayer were bewildered by my sudden statement. They were surprised because it sounded like nonsense. Epinhauser started to stare at me.\u201cExplain what you mean, No. 11.\u201d\u201cYes. Teacher.\u201dWatch me do this now, you punk.\u201cCayer pointed out to me several times this morning that it was unfair for me to be admitted to the Royal Class with only aptitudes. He said it didn\u2019t make any sense for me to enter Royal Class and Class A at that, based just on my aptitudes without having a talent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dYeah, watch me twist it like that.Mr. Epinhauser seemed to be surprised not by the content of what I was saying, but how I worded it. Yeah, it was a very serious way to put it.\u201cSo I said to Cayer something to the effect of that students shouldn\u2019t question the decisions made by the Temple Admissions Office. Of course, in that process, I also asked Cayer maybe a bit strongly if he were the head of the admissions office, to which Cayer, of course, answered no. I believed the issue to end there, but I guess Caierre must have felt offended that I had dismissed his remarks at that time.\u201dAre you the head of the admissions office, you bastard? That\u2019s what I said roughly.\u201cAnd just after the P.E. class, he asked me if I were good at fighting in the changing room. So I answered him honestly that I wasn\u2019t very good at it. Maybe he planned to physically subdue me to repay me for the humiliation he felt that morning after he saw me struggling with the physical training. He pushed me several times and asked how I could dare to talk to him like that when I wasn\u2019t even good at fighting. Cayer, do you admit that you said these words?\u201dAt my question, Cayer exclaimed with his face reddened.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s true, but I just pushed him! That guy hit me!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hit you because you pushed me.\u201dNoticing that the talk was about to get more tangled up, Mr. Epinhauser raised his hand.\u201cStop, so what did you mean by him undermining Temple\u2019s authority?\u201dHe looked at me, as if warning me to not go on to talk nonsense.\u201cAs Cayer pushed me he said that it would be absurd for a person like me to get into Class A, then asked me what trick I had used to get in. He said that it was clear that I bribed the admissions office and that my admission was fraudulent.\u201dCayer\u2019s face paled with every passing moment. He was probably wondering why I gave a speech like that. Everything happened for a reason.It was true that I was feeling nervous because I was standing in front of Mr. Epinhauser, but, in the end, it was me who set up this character as well.\u201cI can tolerate insults against me,\u00a0 but Cayer\u2019s remarks casted doubt on the credibility of Temple, the pride of the Empire and the world\u2019s best educational institution.\u201dI looked at Mr. Epinhauser.\u201cIn other words, he questioned Temple\u2019s credibility and with it the great Gardias Empire. I couldn\u2019t bear my indignation anymore so I might have lost my temper without realizing it. I apologize for my carelessness. Teacher.\u201dMr. Epinhauser\u2019s characteristic was\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026Is it true that you said that, No. 10?\u201dOverwhelming patriotism.\u201cI asked if it was true that a student of Royal Class even spread groundless rumors about Temple\u2019s system being flawed.\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2026. That\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes or No. Only answer with either of those two.\u201dMr. Epinhauser\u2019s cold anger wasn\u2019t directed at me, but I still felt my throat tingle.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Mr. Epinhauser was a cold-hearted patriot who took great pride in the Empire and Temple. Therefore, he was extremely calm about other things, but about matters that might damage the honor of either of those two, he was extremely sensitive.So it was no wonder that he got angry at a student that openly doubted Temple\u2019s decision not once but twice in a single day.Of course, there were some things that I left out of my recount, as this was a very serious matter.It was easy to make a man out to be the world\u2019s worst killer based on nothing depending how one interpreted his words.A problem doesn\u2019t become a problem until it\u2019s addressed.In other words, most words can be twisted in such a way that they sound problematic.He seemed that he was going to let go of the matter regarding the fight. He told me he would let me off the hook. It seemed to be common for classmates to get into fights in Royal Class.After that Epinhauser told me that I could go, but that Cayer had to stay. He also mentioned that I seem to have a talent that wasn\u2019t treated as one before.What he meant by that was that I didn\u2019t talk like a child my age should. But, so what. It\u2019s not like he\u2019d think I was actually an old man on the inside.Wouldn\u2019t it be strange for a complete incompetent to get into Temple\u2019s Royal Class, where talents gathered?Who\u2019d even doubt that there was some old man inside this bastard that is me? If I force myself to act like a child, I\u2019d just feel uncomfortable and it would only be more awkward. I was just going to roll with this character I build.In the end, Mr. Epinhauser focused more on Cayer but he wouldn\u2019t be severely punished. After all, Teacher knew that I exaggerated the situation a bit, and Cayer was just a kid.It would just be to the extent of a warning.When I came back to the classroom alone, there was a strange atmosphere hanging around everyone. Cayer didn\u2019t come back, only me. I didn\u2019t seem like I got scolded at all, so they were curious.There would be rumors floating around Class A and B about the fight.Even though he has no talent, he has such a bad temper.Ah. What was wrong with them just because of one bad apple? Although that bad apple was me, so I had nothing to say.And then.[Challenge accomplished][Received 100 Achievement Points.]\u2026\u2026What the hell?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s why the teacher told everyone to go back after the fight broke out.So, shortly after Cayer came back, Mr. Epinhauser returned for the closing ceremony.Although Cayer was frustrated for being scolded, he sure wouldn\u2019t want to pick a fight with me anymore. I wanted you to realize that my mouth could hurt you more than my fists, kid.\u201cEveryone, please submit your course application forms.

Please keep in mind that you can\u2019t go outside unless you get permission from me or the headmaster.\u201dMr. Epinhauser left with these words and half of the students got up to leave as well.How each person spent their personal time was widely varied. Some of them were dedicated to self-improvement.\u201cHey, let\u2019s go to Main Street.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired\u2026. I want to go rest\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I know a nice place there! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it there, so want to come with?\u201dSome put there best effort into playing, like for example A-8 Kono Lint. Class B\u2019s lessons also ended.\u201cDo you know any fun places to go to?\u201dLudwig was asking his classmates if they knew any fun places to visit as this was his first time at Temple. Of course, everyone was completely exhausted from the P.E. lesson they had not too long ago today.\u201cWoah, look at these accursed eyes.\u2026.\u201dThen, I suddenly heard some quiet swears coming from somewhere beside me.I knew what they were talking about.They were talking about a girl that just left the classroom of Class B.\u201cWhenever I see her, I immediately feel my luck slipping away from me.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so creepy.\u201dErich de Lafaeri said loudly as if he intended her to hear everything. She must have heard it, but Scarlett just continued walking ahead pretending to not hear a thing.She had red hair and red eyes. They made it hard for her not to stand out.B-3 Scarlett.\u201cSuch an ominous thing can\u2019t possibly be born naturally.\u201dErich gritted his teeth while staring at Scarlett\u2019s back.\u201cI can\u2019t believe such a thing made it to the Royal Class. What bad luck.\u201dWhat do you know, you bastard? You don\u2019t even know that you\u2019re standing right beside a Demon Prince? Idiot.Erich calmly walked over to Scarlett and bumped into the girl as he passed by.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dScarlett began to pick up the items she dropped without saying a word, as if she was already used to that situation. Ludwig tilted his head as he looked at Erich\u2019s leaving figure.\u201cWhat, he bumped into you and didn\u2019t even apologize. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAs if trying to refuse his help, Scarlett quickly picked up her dropped items, turned away from Ludwig and walked away.Erich wasn\u2019t the only one.Most of the Class A and B students were also secretly avoiding Scarlett. There were those who just avoided her and those who didn\u2019t care at all about her. Erich only directly bullied her, but with the exception of Ludwig, everyone treated her the same.Sheesh.It didn\u2019t feel all that good seeing the bullying I set up happening right in front of my eyes.* * *Red was an ominous color.Born with red hair and red eyes, Scarlett was abandoned by her parents at birth. Her setting was that she got picked up by a beggar who took pity on her. My fabricated origin was something similar, but she really was from the streets.She was dragged to the guards a few times for stealing some bread, but one day her talent was discovered by a wizard that happened to pass by coincidentally and was sent to Temple. She had a great talent, so becoming a scholarship student was a given.However, she got bullied by the students in Temple all the time, getting called ominous.Scarlett had no other place to go once she left Temple though, so she just clenched her teeth, endured this humiliation and just went on with her life.\u00a0 Therefore, although she was physically very adept and talented at that, she was still stuck with those children bullying her. If she caused trouble and got expelled, that would be the end.So she got a scholarship and ended up in Royal Class. However, Erich, who had been tormenting Scarlett countless times even in middle school, also entered Royal Class.It obviously was that kind of setting.Anyway, the bloody eyed Scarlett had been famous among her classmates for a long time now. In a negative way.However, I realized how irresponsible I was when I set her as a target for bullying just because she stood out a bit.I didn\u2019t think there was anyone else who would look so good in her red hair and eyes. She stood out even from a distance because she was such a pretty girl.Red = Negative, so she got bullied for it?Flammable trash, that\u2019s what that was. She should have been Temple\u2019s idol, but she got bullied anyway. Actually, Erich should have fallen in love with Scarlett and just teased her, like little boys would harrass the girls they liked.But looking at all the things Erich would do to her, it would definitely not be to the point of simply teasing the girl he liked.\u201cIf I become an inquisitor, I will grab you first and tear you apart\u201d, obviously wasn\u2019t something one would say to a girl one liked. Ah.How could he say such things to such a cute and kind kid?But wasn\u2019t it actually me who wrote this?Aren\u2019t I the piece of trash then?Yes, I am.How could I make characters say such harsh things to a child like that?Yes, I absolutely deserved to die from high blood pressure caused by malicious comments.\u201cHaah\u2026.\u201dWhen I saw Scarlett walking to the dormitory area from a distance, I sighed, feeling guilty about making this strange setting with my own two hands.If I left it as is, Erich\u2019s bullying would intensify, leading Ludwig to become angry and asked Erich for a duel for the sake of Scarlett. So, a fight broke out and after many turns, Scarlett was freed from her bullying and they became friends.However, I had to watch this shit until Ludwig decided to come out\u2026.The rest of the kids also thought that the color red was ominous, so even those kids with a sense of justice would just remain silent.Sigh.* * *Those who returned to the dormitory would spend their time on their own until evening. Class B seemed to have gone to Temple\u2019s Main Street with Ludwig.Dinner time started at 6 pm. Since each dormitory had their own separate cafeteria in their dormitories, I would just eat at the dormitory cafeteria of Class A Year 1. Sometimes the whole student body would eat at the banquet hall, but that was rather unusual.Anyway, there was still time until evening. Class A was rather quiet compared to the noisy Class B.It felt more like complete silence actually.Well, there was no need to worry anymore since I had 1000 achievement points saved up. So I tried to decide which talent I should choose.[Self-suggestion \u2013 1000 Points]Self-suggestion.I acquired that talent without thinking about this any further. This was the most fraudulent supernatural power I could think of.As for how much of a cheat it was. I once wanted to give this power to one of the characters, but after thinking about it a bit more, I removed it entirely for how scammy that power was.So in other words, I had never used that setting. It seemed like data that I originally discarded got recycled. It was similar to the situation of the capital, which I imagined to have the same layout as Seoul, although I never wrote it anywhere, however, it actually turned out to have the same layout. Although, there were some abilities that definitely didn\u2019t appear.It was also great that it had the same point requirement as low level talents, as it was an ability that would evolve over time.I checked my status.ValierAge: 17Current stats: [Strength 3.5(F)] [Agility 4.4(F+)] [Dexterity 5.2(D-)] [Magic 9.9(C-)][Stamina 5.9(D-)]Race: ArcdemonTalent: Supernatural \u2013 Self-suggestion (Locked)Abilities[Demon Domination D](Unique to Arcdemons) (Cannot be used in current state.)[Self-suggestion](Locked)Comprehensive Ability Assessment \u2013 Lowest Level DemonCombat Level Assessment \u2013 FThere was a subtle rise in strength, agility and stamina. That wasn\u2019t just because of the p.e. class today, but also because of my hard work up until now\u2026.However.Wasn\u2019t there something strange?What does that (Locked) written behind the talent mean?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was just lying in bed and I discovered a weird twist. I had that strong permonition that I had been fucked.Yeah, I had a cheat, but it was certainly an uncooperative cheat. I should have looked into that more when I was buying an ability. Supernatural powers could certainly be used with just a single talent, so there must have been a good reason as to why it was sold so cheaply.I had a vague feeling of what was going on.It was wide spread common knowledge that supernatural powers couldn\u2019t be awakened though sheer effort.However, reality was a bit different. All those who have been found to have a talent for supernatural powers had \u201cawakened\u201d their powers. One could say, they were able to raise the level of their ability to such an extent in which it became apparent no matter if one could control it or not.However, there were actually a few people who had latent supernatural abilities. They just hadn\u2019t manifested yet.Such latent supernatural powers might awaken after being traumatized or being under immense psychological pressure. Even the one\u2019s with these abilities around me awakened after a traumatic experience.What?It\u2019s a common development.Awakening one\u2019s powers after exploding into anger.It\u2019s like those chuuni fantasies\u2026.Right\u2026?\u201cShit.\u201dI knew. I kind of expected it, but I still hoped it would be a little different in my case.I got it from my cheat, so I thought I could just use it right away. But I couldn\u2019t.I didn\u2019t buy an activated supernatural power. I bought a latent one.Yeah, I now knew why it was so cheap.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32The only one who naturally awakened was Number B-3, Liana de Grantz. The rest of the supernatural power users awakened unintentionally after experiencing something traumatic.Natural awakenings were extremely rare and shouldn\u2019t be taken as the norm. I didn\u2019t know how long it would take my power to just awaken naturally.Then, it looked like there was no other way than going through a psychologically pressuring situation to forcefully awaken my ability\u2026.I experienced something like that while I was escaping from the Demon King\u2019s Castle and I really didn\u2019t want to be thrown into such a situation again.Couldn\u2019t that experience be counted as a form of traumatic prepayment and just awaken me already?Of course, it couldn\u2019t. I thought I could maybe artificially awaken myself with achievement points, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Damn it, I wasn\u2019t expecting to be able to use it right away because it was still at a low level, but for it to not even be activated.What was even the use of this dog-like supernatural power, if I couldn\u2019t even use it yet?Okay, let\u2019s just think about the future first.I didn\u2019t intend to just settle with one talent. I had to think of a way to awaken my supernatural ability and what talent I should acquire next. I wished I had a talent that could be of help right away.When I confirmed the performance of Ludwig\u2019s talent today, I felt like it was incredible.[Swordsmanship \u2013 2000 Points][Archery \u2013 2000 Points]...The prices doubled. That was what I pretty much expected. I thought it might just multiply by 10, completely shattering my hope, but it, at least, left me with some hope, huh?However, I currently had 0 achievement points. I had invested all of them into buying this inactive supernatural power. At this rate one wouldn\u2019t even be able to detect that I had a supernatural ability.If they could do that, the Empire would sweep all of them up.There are two things I had to do from now on.One, I have to put extreme psychological pressure onto myself to awaken my supernatural ability.Two, I needed to earn achievement points to buy an additional talent.If I were to earn 2000 achievement points through events and challenges that would usually give me about 100 points, I would be able to get a second talent unless the prices changed.Right now, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what to do, so the only thing I could try now were the challenges.However, there were only those strange actions, crimes and things juvenile delinquents would do among them.However.[Write a love letter to one of your classmates and get dumped\u2013 200 Points]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was very easy to achieve, but it was also very easy to see that this challenge wanted me to trample all over my dignity.I mean, that kind of corssed the line.Wouldn\u2019t that mean I had to confess to a highschool kid and then get dumped?But why did this give me twice as much points while other challenges just give me 100?Ah.What if\u2026.Did they want me to humiliate myself?200 Points.Twice as much as usual.If I were just to suffer for a bit, I would receive 200 points.Apparently, that filthy bastard named Reinhardt, some bully who beat up his classmate on the first day, suddenly wrote a love letter to someone?If rumors like that were to spread about me, my image as a jerk with a bad personality doing pervy things would be cemented in everyone\u2019s mind. The risk of that was just too great. These were my classmates whom I had to see for the next 6 years after all.There was even that restriction \u201cclassmate\u201d. So if I sent it to the wrong person everything would be meaningless. Did classmate include Class B or only Class A?No.No wait.Let\u2019s see.Let\u2019s think about this differently.Let\u2019s look at this from a different angle.Rather, I found a much better method.[Receive a love confession from a classmate \u2013 1000 Points]This, I think, this might be possible?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Of course, Temple, which was a huge educational complex, didn\u2019t only have schools. There was no reason for there to not be a commercial district where children of wealthy families gathered endlessly.There weren\u2019t only high-class restaurants, but also cafes, clothing stores and entertainment facilities.So, the kids who liked to play spend most of their time wandering around Main Street, it was also known as an area in which students came to the most.\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d\u201cThis is where I\u2019ve been going to for the past 3 years, and almost everything there tastes good. I can assure you of that.\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019ve been here a few times.\u201dErich nodded at Kono Lint making a fuss. Cayer had his arms crossed and wasn\u2019t even touching the dessert in front of him.On the table the three sat at, were cakes, pretzels and other desserts spread out in front of them. They just bought some hot dogs Kono Lint recommended at a nearby restaurant and came here for desserts.\u201cHey. Just eat and relax.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cJust take a bite. It\u2019s sweet, you know?\u201dKono Lint smiled and pushed the plate towards Cayer. All of them, except Erich, were commoners, but it wasn\u2019t hard for Erich to get along with them, because the Lafaeli family were rural lords.Originally, those three didn\u2019t get along so quickly. However, they united on the first day because of one reason.\u201cYeah, we have to pay attention to that madman.\u201dIt was Number A-11 Reinhardt.He didn\u2019t have any talent, but had a bad temper, so that madman threw punches and swore like a sailor starting the first day of the semester.Because of Reinhardt becoming their common enemy, the three of them became close on the first day. Cayer even got hit by that man without any talent, and got punished by the teacher even though it was he who got wronged.\u201cNo, but why did you end up getting scolded?\u201dKono Lint didn\u2019t seem to understand.\u201cYeah. What happened?\u201d\u201cNo idea. I don\u2019t even know what that bastard meant with what he said. Anyway, something about me insulting Temple.\u201dUnfortunately, Cayer couldn\u2019t remember all the words Reinhardt kept on babbling out. But when Mr. Epinhauser heard Reinhardt\u2019s words, he rebuked Cayer with a serious expression.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Insulting Temple?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. That fucking bastard, I\u2019ll get him later and when I do I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201dAt Erich\u2019s words, Cayer quickly turned his gaze out the window with an irritated expression on his face. Every group needed to have a common enemy in order to form solidarity.Those three made Reinhardt their common enemy.\u201cHey, but aren\u2019t all the girls in our class really pretty?\u201dKono Lint suddenly lowered his voice. Erich nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Still I wouldn\u2019t tell them that face to face.\u00a0 We are classmates in Temple, but they wouldn\u2019t even give me a glance if we were outside.\u201d\u201cBut, hey, aren\u2019t we all in the same class now?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t only good-natured people like the prince among them. You have to be careful. Not to mention the Imperial Princess, there\u2019s the Princess of the Saint-Owan Grand Duchy and the Duke of Grantz is also a high lord. They have more prestige than the Emperor.\u201dErich was clearly drawing a line. They mingled in temple, but outside, they were people of completely different standing. No matter how young they were, they weren\u2019t the type of people he could touch even a single hair of.\u201cBut how about now? Wouldn\u2019t you be able to talk to them?\u201dKono Lint poked at them as if he was really interested in this topic.\u201cWho do you think is the prettiest? Huh?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cAh, I personally think it\u2019s the Imperial Princess.\u201dAs Kono Lint said so, Erich frowned as if he was unwilling to share. Erich and Cayer refused to speak, but after continuous prying on Kono Lint\u2019s part they eventually confessed.\u201cI think\u2026. Number 2.\u201dAt Erich\u2019s words, Kono Lint tilted his head.\u201cHer? What\u2026.? I mean, sure, but isn\u2019t she a little scary? I\u2019m speechless.\u201d\u201cYou asked me who I think looks best.\u201d\u201cAh, well. What about you?\u201d\u201cIf I had to say\u2026.\u201dCayer thought about it and then finally spat it out.\u201cDuke Grantz\u2019 esteemed daughter\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I can get behind that.\u201dThis was what kids and adults alike liked to talk about when they got together. Just when they were in the middle of talking about beauties.\u201cErm\u2026. Excuse me, but\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, all of them turned their heads hearing the voice of a girl coming from somewhere.\u201cCou, could you give me a minute\u2026. Would it be okay to talk for a bit?\u201dThere, a beautiful girl was shyly talking to Kono Lint. He nearly doubted his eyes.\u201cWell, here.\u201dKono Lint, who got dragged out of the dessert shop as if possessed, nearly had his head explode at this unknown girl shyly giving him an envelope.\u201cThi, this. Erm\u2026. What\u2026 Might this be?\u201dHe started speaking formally without realizing it.\u201cPlease read it\u2026.\u201dThe girl\u2019s face was flushed and she wriggled her body, trying not to make eye contact. When he opened the envelope as if possessed by something, there was a single sentence written on a piece of paper.[I fell in love with you at first sight. Please go out with me.]\u201cThi, this\u2026. This is\u2026.\u201dMale, 17 years old.He just experienced a miracle he had never even dreamed of in his life.\u201cEhm\u2026. What do you think\u2026?\u201dTo the girl\u2019s quiet question.\u201cI fell in love at first sight with you too!\u201dKono Lint nearly stumbled over his words.What the boy, however, didn\u2019t see was the corners of the girl\u2019s mouth slowly creeping up.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I sold my soul for points.[Achievement points: 1000 Points]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI thought about it, but when I actually put it to praxis I felt my heart break.Scared of confirming if the confession challenge was completed, I pretended I was busy and ran off.Then, I changed my clothes in a dark alleyway as to not get found out, turned back into Reinhardt and returned to the dormitory.It didn\u2019t say I had to \u2018Get the confession in the form of Reinhardt\u2019 in the challenge information after all.I noticed that blind spot and tried to exploit it right away, and it worked. It seemed like a good idea in my head, but when I actually did it, I felt like dying during every single second of it.I had preserved my dignity as Reinhardt, but I seriously tarnished my dignity as a human being and played with an innocent 17-year-old boy\u2019s heart, no matter how much I set him up to be a playboy.Kono Lint was a bit lacking, but by no means a bad guy.And here I trampled all over his heart.I feel like I\u2019ve become less then human feces\u2026.[Challenge list has been updated.]A message appeared in front of me. The remaining ones stayed the same, but there were some changes.[From now on, unless stated otherwise, the condition that all challenges have to be completed as \u2018Reinhardt\u2019 has been added.][Receive a love confession from a classmate \u2013 1000 Points](Clear)[Write a love letter to a classmate and get dumped \u2013 200 Points][Get punished by your teacher \u2013 100 Points][Leave some graffiti on Temple\u2019s Main Street after curfew \u2013 100 Points]Look at this bastard.Did you not expect me to take advantage of this weak spot? You added that condition immediately after I finished the challenge, didn\u2019t you?How annoying, fixing it right away, pah.The challenges were definitely only there to fuck me over. You didn\u2019t expect me to make use of an exploit, but I did, so you added that condition.You want me to write a love letter and get dumped so bad?Then,An unexpected challenge had been added.[Date Kono Lint as a pretty girl (Idiot) \u2013 1000 Points]Ah.Ah.Ah!That guy\u2019s watching me in real time! I don\u2019t really know how he\u2019s doing it but I bet he laughed his guts out while he watched me talk!My desire to disappear from the surface of this world grew ten times stronger.Even if the world were to collapse, I won\u2019t ever do that.* * *I sold my soul for 1000 points.I never thought I\u2019d manage to get that much in a single day. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I believe this wasn\u2019t the direction that voyeuristic ass wanted this to go.If I collect 1000 more points, I would be able to buy another talent. I wasn\u2019t even considering going on a date with Kono Lint.I returned to the dormitory thinking about how I should get the remaining 1000 points. Naturally, I threw the sweatshirt I wore while I met Kono Lint outside the shop, away and returned in another outfit. I didn\u2019t plan on leaving any traces behind.Evening.-Hehe\u2026. Hehehe\u2026.The sight of Kono Lint and the other two fiddling with their food looking at him with envious eyes made my stomach ache.I felt like I was about to throw up all my food because of this complex mix of guilt, shame and humiliation I felt.I felt so nauseous I couldn\u2019t get myself to eat the dinner. In the end, I wasn\u2019t even able to eat half of the prepared menu. I could certainly feel that the chef was really skilled though.However, I didn\u2019t think I could appreciate those skills today.Kono Lint seemed to be living in his happy delusions for a while. However, what will happen after that condition fades?Would he get depressed?No.Let\u2019s not care about him.As soon as I start to caring, I\u2019ll lose.Even though my supernatural ability hadn\u2019t even awakened yet.I left the restaurant while continuing to self-suggest myself.One might say this was a type of extreme psychological pressure in its own way.It had no effect though.* * *I\u2019d say I did a pretty impressive job for my first day. Although it was still inactive, I managed to get the supernatural ability I was aiming for and got a great amount of achievement points.If I somehow got 1000 more points, I would be able to get my second talent or I could use it for other purposes.It seemed I could, not only buy talents, but also randomly raise my stats, but I hadn\u2019t put that under consideration yet. My stats rose just by training normally. If I were to receive physical training similar to the one I had today, my stats would continue to rise.Unless it was a special case like the magic stat.And there was something I was worried about.If one saw profit once, one would crave for more. I earned 1000 points, but I was still hungry for more.You could never know when those challenges would disappear. I had no idea when that mysterious bastard changed his mind, right?The newly updated challenges probably wouldn\u2019t have any more weak spots and it seemed likely that their content would be more difficult or humiliating than before.Things, including skipping class, would lead to disciplinary actions. I didn\u2019t get into much trouble, but Epinhauser seemed to already have a certain picture of me because of the fight, and if I caused any more problems, I, of course, wouldn\u2019t get away with it.[Write a love letter to a classmate and get dumped \u2013 200 Points]It seemed to encourage me to write a love letter. I wrote a love letter earlier but I didn\u2019t get dumped, so I wasn\u2019t able to finish it.The condition was to get dumped after all.It was rather sad knowing that fulfilling that condition was just too easy. Under my current circumstances the probability of getting dumped was 100%..If I just endured that humiliation for a bit, I would be able to get 200 points, but then I still had to get 800 more.Actually, if that idea of using the Dreadfiend\u2019s ring to get a confession didn\u2019t cross my mind, I wanted to try something else. The problem of all this was that I might get bullied after rumors about this came out, however what would happen if the person I gave the letter to would not gossip about it? They would just treat me as werido.So it had to be a person that wouldn\u2019t start gossiping about me and also wouldn\u2019t care that much about me after the act.Ellen Artorius.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShould I or shouldn\u2019t I?Should I or shouldn\u2019t I?Ah.First I sold my soul for points.Was I now going to trample all over my dignity for points this time?* * *There wasn\u2019t any need for us to talk for long.Class A dormitory\u2019s gym.It was obvious where I would be able to find her, so I headed to the gym after everyone was gone.Ellen Artorius, who received my letter stating my desire to date her, looked at the plain text, then looked at me and spoke briefly.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAh, oh\u2026.

So she didn\u2019t try to approach anyone because she thought the other person would just push her away.She had tremendous talent, but she had no sense of superiority around her that usually came with it. She also didn\u2019t feel inferior that one would usually feel when faced with someone stronger than oneself.She wasn\u2019t acting all sweet, but she had a gentle heart.Of course, I set up a past for her, but that wasn\u2019t important now.Anyway, it didn\u2019t really matter whether I confessed to her or not. I wrote a love letter to Ellen because she wouldn\u2019t really care about this.I mean, I actually only did this for the points after all.However.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was bothering me.It was really bothering me.It wasn\u2019t because I liked her or something, but because I had now become very conscious of her!I felt so embarrassed and ashamed that I couldn\u2019t stand it. That bastard obviously wanted me to be in that state. This was just straight up bullying.-Now, move from this posture to this and\u2026.Tuesday.Ellen was sitting next to me in the swordsmanship theory class and I nearly went completely mad about it.Of course, Ellen and I were the only Royal Class students taking this class. All the other students were regular class students.Students wearing various types of school uniforms gathered here. And among those, who could recognize the Royal Class uniforms we were wearing, kept glancing at us.I could read their thoughts just by looking at their eyes.Wow, they\u2019re from Royal Class, aren\u2019t they?That was the look they gave us.Although they sure were an object of envy, these school uniforms attracted way too much attention..Bertus, Ludwig, Cliffman and Erich also should have taken lectures on swordsmanship, but they probably chose other lectures for this time slot.So, did she sit next to me because I was a classmate from Royal Class? Was it like that? You\u2019re usually not the type to care about these things though, now aren\u2019t you?Seriously, why did she decide to sit next to me?Sigh, was she not talking to me because of the sudden confession yesterday? Did she become conscious of me? That can\u2019t be. She wasn\u2019t like that. Then why did she sit next to me?What\u2019s this? Why was I fussing about this like some teenager?I\u2019ve become conscious of a kid like that just because I was trying to earn some points? Ridiculous!-Tok\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI dropped my pen because I couldn\u2019t stop fidgeting. Ellen picked it up silently and handed it to me.\u201cAh, uhm. Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWas this a positive sign?Didn\u2019t she usually not help people pick up their things? Based on her personality, she wouldn\u2019t care about these things, now would she?Of course, she wouldn\u2019t care about me after picking it up and just listened to the lecture. Ah. no, it\u2019s definitely not normal for her to pick up pens for others.No, but what should I do? I\u2019m not interested in her at all. What if she suddenly told me that she liked me? I couldn\u2019t accept that at all.\u2026\u2026.I had a problem.I started to imagine all sorts of delusional, ridiculous scenarios.Of course.At the end of the lecture, Ellen left the lecture hall without sparing me a single glance.Did she even recognize my face to begin with? She didn\u2019t even know who I was, did she? No, but we were wearing the same uniforms.My face was getting hot for no reason.* * *This was my class schedule, excluding common classes.Tuesday I would have swordsmanship theory, swordsmanship practice and magic theory.Wednesday was Magic Sensitization Training, Mediation and Supernatural Power Control.On Friday I had Divine Power Training, Alchemy and Integrated Martial Arts Training.Now, as someone of a lower grade, I only had to listen to three lectures a day, but as I got older I would have to listen to sometimes up to five or six lectures a day. The first three years were like high school courses, and the second half was like university courses.So, since I didn\u2019t have anything I specialized in, I was taking swordsmanship, magic, supernatural powers and divine power classes.Swordsmanship Theory and Swordsmanship Practice were combined lectures taught by the same teacher so it was a pretty long lecture in which one first learned about the theory in a classroom and then put it to practice in the gym.A class where one had to put to practice what one learned on the same day and even learn further things while practicing.Of course, as this was a general class as well, it wasn\u2019t a total mess, but there were a bunch of clumsy people among the students.\u201cGet your posture right! Put power into your hands!\u201dThe problem was, I was included in the category of clumsy people. Of course, I was constantly criticized by the teaching assistants for my poor basic strength as well as my poor posture.There were even a lot of general students who were so excellent that comparing them to me was completely meaningless, as they learned swordsmanship ever since their middle school days.\u201cPerfect. As expected from the Royal Class. She\u2019s on a completely different level.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen passed almost every task in one try because she had the physical constitution to imitate what she learned immediately, so her teacher praised her.The other students were also looking at Ellen, witnessing the skills of someone from the Royal Class.I didn\u2019t really know what the teacher was thinking, but she suddenly clapped her hands.\u201cAs far as I was informed there was one more student of the Royal Class here. Ellen and Reinhardt is what I heard. Is your name Ellen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cReinhardt!\u201dI looked over to them as I heard the teacher call my name. It seemed like she came up with a good idea.\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s have the first practice match between the Royal Class students!\u201dNo.I don\u2019t think that was a good idea at all.* * *They shoved a training sword into my hands all of a sudden, while I was still not done practicing my basic posture. Everyone gathered around, wanting to watch the battle between the Royal Class students. Everyone\u2019s eyes were sparkling.What kind of public execution was this?You want me to have a practice battle with the strongest person of my class?The teaching assistant who was training me just now, seemed like he wanted to say \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a good idea.\u201d but couldn\u2019t bear to tell the teacher.What if I die here, huh?Ellen looked at me indifferently and held her training sword.\u201cI\u2019ll stop it when it\u2019s going too far, so feel free to fight as much as you want.\u201dThat teacher said some dangerous words without blinking an eye. No, I didn\u2019t want to do this though?Before I was able to come up with a solution to somehow deal with this situation\u2026.\u201cNow, start!!\u201dI.-Tak!I didn\u2019t even notice Ellen Artorius approaching me.* * *An unfamiliar ceiling.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMy head was buzzing.Wha, what happened?I thought that I was probably lying in some sort of bed.Seeing as to how my head hurt, I had probably been hit by something.At that moment, the situation that happened shortly before I passed out appeared in my mind.Ellen Artorius rushed at me as soon as the start signal was given, and then struck my head with her sword.And then I passed out, I guess?No, but where was I\u2026.\u201cUrg!\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re awake.\u201dWhen I looked to my right, a calm, cold-looking girl with dark hair and black eyes was looking at me.\u201cThis is the infirmary, classes are over.\u201dI probably got taken to the infirmary after I passed out. The teacher, who seemed to be in charge, checked up on me.\u201cThe pain will subside soon. It\u2019s nothing serious, you don\u2019t have to worry, okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded at the teacher\u2019s words with a bewildered expression on my face.That damn swordsmanship teacher! Why did they do some practice match out of nowhere? You made someone faint! Can\u2019t you take your nose out of your ass?! Aren\u2019t you a teacher?!\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dEllen grabbed my shoulder as I was struggling to get up.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWere you trying to cheer me up?\u201cI didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t know swordsmanship.\u201dEllen lifted me up and helped me put on my shoes, while she was talking in a sullen voice.Wha, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201cOriginally, I planned to aim for your neck after you blocked my sword and let my sword flow down your sword to finish it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I, see.\u201dHer original plan was to force me to block with a straight strike then let her sword follow the flow down my blade and aim for my neck.However, I couldn\u2019t even react to the first hit, so she accidentally hit my head with her sword.In other words, this was an unexpected accident. An accident that occured because I was unexpectedly weak, that is.So.Was she doing this because she felt sorry?\u201cAh, Look. I think I can walk on my own now\u2026.\u201dAt my words, she lowered her arm supporting me. I had a headache, but I wasn\u2019t badly hurt. Anyway, how long had I been out?\u201cAh, don\u2019t we have to go to our next lecture?\u201dEllen shook her head at my words.\u201cIt\u2019s lunch time now.\u201dAfter the two lectures in the morning, it was usually lunch time. The second lecture was already over, and it was lunch time now so there was still plenty of time.No.Did that mean we were going to eat together?Probably not. She was just answering the questions I asked. I mean, I confessed to her yesterday, got dumped and today she one hitted me.That wasn\u2019t even a fight, it was a one sided beating actually.I couldn\u2019t feel any more shame. However, the other person didn\u2019t seem to care much, making me feel even more embarrassed.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Do you want to have lunch?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-NodWhat I had come to realize is that after you pass a certain level of shame, it just didn\u2019t matter that much anymore.* * *At first, she seemed like a quiet kid indifferent to most things.Yesterday, I confessed to her and she refused me, but right now I felt conflicted, because I asked that same kid to have lunch together with me now. I wasn\u2019t that kind of person usually.The kind of person that didn\u2019t give meaning to anything.She ate when she was hungry and didn\u2019t care who she ate with. Thinking like that made my worries go away..I just had to treat her however I wanted to as well. Unless I did something rude enough for her to slap me, that was just it.Because that was how she was.Thinking like that made my head clear. She was the type of person who would react the same no matter what happened, so it should be alright for me to treat her a bit more comfortably than the other kids, right?Because she didn\u2019t misunderstand me and didn\u2019t have any preconceived notions about me, she just judged me as I was.\u201cIs there anything you want to eat?\u201d\u201cAnything\u2019s fine.\u201dEh?\u201cAre you really fine with anything?\u201d\u201cYeah, anything\u2019s fine.\u201dNo matter how much I thought about it, this wasn\u2019t your fault, but you dumped me and hit me.I started to feel like teasing you a bit.Be prepared.* * *Since this place was similar to Seoul, there were places similar to the one\u2019s found in Seoul in the Imperial Capital Gardium.Maybe that\u2019s why there were so many familiar things. For example, the beggars found in the Han River Park or\u00a0the shopping street that was so reminiscent of the Yongsan District.And yesterday, when I went out to this street to meet Kono Lint, I found something I was shocked to see here.Wasn\u2019t that almost enough to make my whole worldview collapse? It was what I truly wanted.Ellen tilted her head at the sight of this food.\u201cIt smells strange.\u201dCheonggukjang.Ellen was unable to take her hands from her nose when she saw the cheonggukjang in an earthen pot.A musty, savory smell permeated the entire store.I had no idea why, but it existed.Why did you exist? Well, it was what I wanted the most right now.Anyway, It was the food of my hometown! I was so happy to get to eat it again, no matter what!And that\u2019s how I brought her here.What\u2019s the matter? You said you\u2019d eat anything, you know? Huh?If you\u2019re scared just run away then.\u201cThis smells like something I shouldn\u2019t eat.\u201dI shook my head at Ellen\u2019s words and pointed at the people who filled the store.\u201cThe people here eat it normally, you know?\u201dOf course, all of them were adults as well as faculty members. Ellen tilted her head as she looked at the people eating.\u2013 Temple sure is good. They even have eastern dishes here.-There are people from all over the world coming here. So yeah.Apparently, this was described as eastern food, although I had no idea about that setting. However, because Temple attracted students from all over the world, they had to prepare a lot of traditional food that one would usually not find anywhere but it\u2019s place of origin. If there there was demand, there would be supply. It was more expensive than somewhere else maybe, but where else would one go to get this kind of food?Well, that was pretty plausible.It was comparable to a New York food alley. As there were people from all over the world coming they sold a lot of international food.Anyway, cheonggukjang is one thing, but this was probably the first time that I felt happy that\u00a0jjamppong\u00a0and\u00a0kimchi\u00a0existed in this world.So did they also have\u00a0kimchi stew\u00a0and\u00a0army stew?No, wouldn\u2019t it be weird for there to be army stew? There were no American soldiers in this world, so how could there be food introduced by the US army?No, if one thought about it, cheonggukjang also had its origin somewhere else, right?What the hell was going on with this place?Where was I even?\u201cCome on, look.\u201dI started mixing the rice with the cheonggukjang, which I took out of the earthenware pot, sprinkled seaweed powder and sesame oil on it and then began to eat.Ellen watched me eat with a weary expression on her face.Are you discriminating against another culture right now? Do you want to get into trouble?To be honest, this wasn\u2019t really my favorite food, but it was something I kind of needed from time to time. She just continued to watch me eat in delight.Although it had a strong smell, I finally got to experience the taste of my hometown again after a long time.I was kind of touched by it, although not to the point of tears.What?This place actually made some great kimchi.That was it. The meaning of life.As expected, I was still an old man at my core.Did they have soju?\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t sell it to kids, huh?Ellen was staring blankly at me with a long, thoughtful look in her eyes.\u201cHey, Give that to me. I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201dI took her bowl of cheonggukjang, mixed everything in her bowl, scooped up a spoonful and carried it towards her mouth.\u201cOpen up. Try it.\u201d\u201cAh, uhm. Erm.\u201dEllen repeatedly opened her small lips, perhaps because of the stinging smell rising up into her nose. Her eyebrows and lips twitched, seeming as if she even doubted whether this was really human food.Looking at her reaction she seemed like a fish opening and closing its mouth. pretty cute, wasn\u2019t it?\u201cAh, my arm\u2019s gonna fall off, man!\u201d\u201cAh, ah\u2026.\u201dWhen I complained, Ellen finally opened her mouth and I put the spoonful of cheonggukjang into it.That was revenge for her hitting me.Ellen chewed a bit of it with an uncertain look on her face.\u201cHe,hehe. How\u2019s that? Feeling limp already?\u201d\u201c!\u201dEllen squeezed her eyes shut as she put it in her mouth whole with a frown on her face.It seemed like her feelings of rejection maximized after she put it in her mouth.Unable to spit or swallow, Ellen started stamping her feet.A blunt, chic and beautiful 17-year-old girl?Hah, there\u2019s no such thing as a permanent concept!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Eventually, Ellen swallowed it by pressing hard on her mouth, too afraid to make a fool out of herself by spitting it out. Perhaps because of the savory taste of the cheonggukjang, Ellen drank from her water several times.\u201cWhy\u2026. Does it smell so much\u2026.\u201dEllen continued to drink her water, while I continued to eat without being fazed. Ellen looked at me strangely as well as the other people eating it.You would end up like that as well if you ate it a few more times.Seeing me and the other people eat it with such fresh expressions, Ellen scooped up another spoonful and took it to her mouth with a slightly puzzled expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen, with a regretful expression on her face, she was unable to spit it out again, forcibly chewed it and swallowed it.\u201cAm\u2026 I the strange one\u2026?\u201dEllen muttered blankly to herself, her lips trembling slightly.She couldn\u2019t eat it, but other people around her were eating it normally, so she was wondering if something was wrong with her.It\u2019s fine.That was just the type of food it was to begin with! I hated it as well as a kid!It tasted like shit, but then one day I suddenly\u2026Ah. Cheonggukjang.Do I want that? I do!Everyone around my age is eating it after all!That was how it started, man.Ellen wasn\u2019t exactly normal either.Even though she ate it and greatly regretted it, she still went on to eat half of her portion though she couldn\u2019t finish all of it after one or two sips of water, as if she was confused as to how people could eat it so easily.\u2018Wow. This is so incomprehensible.\u2019\u2018Argh! Maybe like this? Will it taste delicious this time? Do I have to eat it again?\u2019\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201d\u2018Every time I put it in my mouth, urgh!\u2019That\u2019s how her thought process probably looked like. The face she pulled was just too funny.What. Did she have a child\u2019s palate?It was a bonus that the humble owner of this shop halved the price for us, impressed that children were eating choenggukjang so well.* * *\u201cI\u2019m not eating that again.\u201dAfter we left the restaurant, Ellen returned to her usual chic expression.Oh my.\u201cYou ate well for that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a strange smell\u2026. coming from my mouth\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoes it smell like shit?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEllen glared at me for a moment at my shameless remark.Ellen narrowed her eyes as if she could smell her own breath. Yes, and one day, this moment would suddenly flash past her as part of her black history, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201cWhy does it smell like that?\u201dEllen was deep in thought, as she couldn\u2019t understand why people would eat something that smelled like that, but what came out of her mouth was a more basic question.\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to eat this, right?\u201d\u201cHey, why would they sell something one isn\u2019t supposed to eat and actually have a lot of people pay for it?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u2026Right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s edible, so I ate it.\u201dDid I look like such a perverted bastard? My novels were all innocent, you know?No.If one thought about it, the genre already changed after I took a beautiful 17-year-old girl to eat cheonggukjang which she had never tried before. That in itself made me seem like a crazy perv, didn\u2019t it?If someone caught me do this, wouldn\u2019t they call this torture? No, but I didn\u2019t force her to eat it. She ate it willingly. She later even ate more and did this to herself.Not caring about me suddenly scaring myself like that, Ellen nodded blankly. She didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Maybe her curiosity had been sated. I was starting to worry that her character maybe collapsed\u2026.No, what would happen if something like that collapsed? Wouldn\u2019t the entire main story get completely destroyed?\u201cI\u2019ll go that way.\u201dAfter walking for a while Ellen pointed to the tram route she had to take to get to her next lecture. I had to go somewhere else.\u201cAh.\u201dThen Ellen turned around and pointed her finger at me.\u201cBe careful with your head.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dSaid the culprit who whacked my head.As such, the 17-year-old beautiful girl disappeared from my view, leaving behind the savory smell of cheonggukjang.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *My next class was Magic Theory. There were 4 students of Royal Class present in that lecture. A-10 Cayer, B-2 Louis Ancton, B-5 Christina and B-6 Anna de Gerna.As soon as Cayer saw me, he turned his head away as if he hadn\u2019t even noticed me and I wasn\u2019t acquainted with any of the students from Class B.That B-2 Louis Ancton guy, was a jerk who had a knack for being a snitch, so he probably told the teacher about that fight yesterday.I just let it go. I wasn\u2019t really that fond of fighting and he wasn\u2019t that bad of a guy, now was he?Currently five of my classmates were majoring in magic. Three of them of them were attending this class. Three of them were here right now, so why were there four people listening to this lecture?B-2 Louis Ancton had no talent for magic. He was an unusual guy who studied magic even though he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to become a wizard.I did mention that there were people like that.People who couldn\u2019t use magic but studied the science behind it.Those people were called magic researchers.Louis had the talent \u2018Academic\u2019 which was the highest talent in the field of research. He wasn\u2019t that physically capable, but he was smarter than no other.So he couldn\u2019t become a wizard, but he still pursued the study of magic.The magic class was quite different from what I expected.I first thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to understand a thing, but it wasn\u2019t that difficult to understand the proper terms, including jargon, because my knowledge seemed to be on the middle school level.The formulas were a bit difficult for me, but it wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t keep up at all.What? Were there maybe still hopes for me to become a wizard?Magic was said to be the study meant for geniuses, but did it maybe feel easier for me because there was already an intelligence correction applied to me?Come to think of it, that might actually be the case.Would I have been able to grasp this with my original level of intelligence?Or did Ellen\u2019s hit to my head have some effect on me? Surprisingly, I had no idea what happened. Maybe it would be a bad idea to aim to become a wizard if I already had intelligence correction applied to me while only barely being able to understand magic\u2026.\u201cOf course, this is only the basic level, but keep in mind that moving from theory to praxis will be much harder than just grasping the concept. You have to think carefully if you want to join the magic major. Also keep in mind the other students before you that have chosen this major. The Magic major brings forth a lot of failures as well.\u201dAh.That\u2019s right.I guess this was comparable to me thinking that Seoul National University would be a piece of cake while solving some elementary school tests.So, I was taking notes with the mindset that I would try as best as I could for the time being. It was better to use my head here, then do physical training at least.Then after a while.The teacher started explaining the existence of other types of magic systems.\u201c\u2026As a typical example, demons implement magic in a completely different way from us because their mana system is completely different from ours. \u00a0We still have to do more research on the subject of the demon\u2019s magic. However, even if we were able to learn how to use magic like them, we cannot be sure that we would be able to use it exactly like them.\u201dHearing that, my mind went blank.What was I even doing up until now?Come to think of it, even if I were to learn magic here, I wouldn\u2019t be able to use it at all, right? I had to go to Eleris to learn magic, and not to this place, didn\u2019t I?Why was I even staying here knowing it would be fruitless?\u201cOh, student? Where are you going?\u201dLet\u2019s make a clean cut.\u201cAh, I don\u2019t think magic\u2019ll work out for me. Teacher!\u201dI decided to drop it!*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The next day.The first lecture.Magic Sensitivity Training.\u201cGather the consciousness all over your body\u2026. Clear the mind\u2026.\u201dI was lying on a mat with my eyes closed. I could faintly hear the teacher\u2019s voice reaching my ears.-Now\u2026. Imagine the Universe is you.\u2026.What?-Take a deep breath\u2026. Breath in\u2026. Breath out\u2026.Spirit treatment?-Put your mind at ease\u2026.Wasn\u2019t this yoga?\u2013 Your body is becoming one with the univeeeeerse\u2026.Wasn\u2019t that similar to the first line? Huh? No matter how I looked at it, that guy was just some charlatan.-Feel iiiiit\u2026.The teacher\u2019s languid voice, sounding as if he drank alcohol starting this morning, made my whole body feel tired and relaxed, as if he was using hypnosis.-Now\u2026. The world is you\u2026. And yooou are the woooorld\u2026.Oh.-Feel it\u2026.The origin of this world\u2026. Maaaaagic\u2026. Ahh\u2026.-With your whole body\u2026. Accept it\u2026. You feel so comfortable\u2026. Your mind\u2026 feels heavy\u2026 It\u2019s going to siiiiink\u2026.Oh\u2026 Like this\u2026.\u2013 Your consciousness\u2026. Is gradually\u2026. Getting further away\u2026. You feel sleepy\u2026.After the Magic Sensitivity Training, conducted by this teacher that looked exactly like the head of a yoga class, was over, everyone looked like they had just woken up.\u201cThat would be all for today. I hope you all have a magical day.\u201dHowever, the teacher didn\u2019t really say much to us after we woke up and just told us to go out as the class was over.This Magic Sensitivity Training was an exclusive class for the Royal Class. Wednesday\u2019s lectures were usually only classes exclusive to the Royal Class. They were classes effectively taught in smaller groups.Except for supernatural power and divinity majors, it was normal for everyone to receive Magic Sensitivity Training. So with the exception of a few, every student of Class A and B were gathered here.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cI know\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuh, what the-?\u201dEveryone looked as if they just were possessed by a ghost. I was just listening to what he said, but everyone seemed to have fallen asleep.\u201cI heard that this class was very satisfying. I bet something will happen.\u201dBertus also yawned as if he had just woken up, and then laughed.I didn\u2019t think that a class that only required one to sleep would have a low satisfaction rating, but\u2026.I didn\u2019t really know if this had anything to do with magic sensitivity.Anyway, it was an easy class, so it was fine.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The next class was Meditation, it wasn\u2019t a class exclusive to supernatural power users, but many with supernatural powers attended it. It was important for anyone to be able to keep one\u2019s composure. So, of course, it wasn\u2019t just for supernatural power users.Four of my classmates had supernatural powers.A-3, Liana de Grantz, Electrokinesis.A-6, Heinrich von Schwarz, Pyrokinesis.A-8, Kono Lint, Teleportation.B-7, Ibia Telepathy.There was one more person who took the meditation class even though they didn\u2019t have supernatural powers.He had white skin as dry as anchovies, which made one feel bad for him.However the look in his eyes seemed a bit dangerous.B-8, Dettomolian.His talents were witchcraft and spirituality.He came from a primitive tribe calling the northern snowfields their home. A guy who got admitted with a talent for an ancient form of magic called witchcraft.However, there was no way for Temple to have a curriculum on something like witchcraft only few practiced. However, Dettomolian wanted to enter Temple under the pretext of studying witchcraft on his own. He said he wanted to study in a safe and well-maintained environment.He looked insidious and was actually shunned just like Scarlett.He could also see ghosts.He was currently doing meditation not to control his mind, but to communicate with the spiritual world.There should have been only five people in total\u2026.\u201cCharlotte de Gardias.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte also signed up for the meditation class. They called us for attendance, which was rather fast as there were only few attending this class in the first place.This suggested the possibility that Charlotte had a supernatural power. I had no contact with Class B, so I still didn\u2019t know what talent Charlotte had.Of course, her taking mediation classes didn\u2019t mean that she absolutely had supernatural powers.I wasn\u2019t exactly a supernatural power user yet either.But Trauma.Awakening supernatural powers under extreme psychological pressure.Obviously, if Charlotte had a latent supernatural ability, she definitely would have awakened it in the Demon Realm.However, if she had supernatural powers, why didn\u2019t Charlotte use them then? She was in immediate danger, so wouldn\u2019t she have used it in that situation, even if it was on accident?Or did she awaken, but didn\u2019t know how to use it or couldn\u2019t control it?No, maybe she really didn\u2019t have supernatural powers to begin with?The meditation class went on, and I went into meditation with such questions spinning in my mind.-Tak!\u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cFocus.\u201dOf course, I couldn\u2019t properly meditate with such things floating around my mind.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35My next class was Psychic Control.With this I couldn\u2019t help but be sure.\u201cCharlotte de Gardias.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCharlotte had a supernatural power. What kind of ability did she possess?\u201c..\u2026 Reinhardt. \u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs they called my attendance, the supernatural power teacher looked at me confused.\u201cThis was Mr. Epinhauser\u2019s request, so I accepted it, but\u2026. You don\u2019t have any supernatural abilities, do you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard that your aptitudes were very multi-faceted\u2026. I don\u2019t know how I could teach you\u2026. How to awaken a supernatural ability\u2026.\u201dThe teacher looked perplexed and the other students also looked at me strangely. It was as if an herbivore came to an all-you-can-eat meat buffet.\u201cIt\u2019ll work out somehow.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dIncluding the Teacher and Charlotte\u2026Everyone was looking at me, dumbfounded.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *-Bzzzt! Crackle!\u201cExcellent, Miss Grantz. You have the best control out of everyone in class.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cTry to increase your power output in that state little by little.\u201dLiana de Grantz sighed in relief as she succeeded to let sparks bounce between the index fingers of both her hands.Unpredictable things could happen in the supernatural power control class so the teachers were teaching the students one on one.-Flaaare!\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s see how long you can maintain it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHeinrich von Schwartz, who succeeded in lighting a fire on sand, was sweating profusely trying to maintain his concentration.-Wo, woah! Don\u2019t look!-I\u2019m not seeing anything. Anything at all. Lint. Get dressed.And I could hear Kono Lint\u2019s screams coming not from the classroom, but the containment room, followed by the teacher\u2019s fed up voice.Kono Lint.Although he was a total playboy, he had a pretty fraudulent ability, that is, the ability to teleport his body.But his biggest problem was that he couldn\u2019t teleport his clothes as well. So the biggest side effect of his power was that every time he used it, he\u2019d end up naked.He was often teased that his ability could only be used in public baths.Naked Teleportation. I kind of wanted it, but on the other hand, not at all.It wasn\u2019t a bad ability to have.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go to Main Street to have crepe for lunch today. Is that correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go outside now. Try it again then.\u201d\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd B-7 Ibia was using her telepathic abilities. The ability to send her own thoughts into the mind of an opponent. They seemed to be doing a range test at the moment.\u201cReinhardt\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Teacher.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dMy teacher had a perplexed look on his face as if he didn\u2019t know what to do with me who didn\u2019t have a supernatural power at all.I would find it weird as well if I were in his shoes. This was a place where supernatural ability users were trying to control and improve their abilities, not to awaken them. So my teacher was at a loss.\u201cPlease put me under extreme psychological pressure.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cOne might awaken a supernatural power in an emergency, right?\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cSo, you don\u2019t have to actually try to kill me, just push me to the brink of death and\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask for something so strange!\u201dThe teacher freaked out, as if I was saying something completely outlandish.That teacher straight up refused, saying that he couldn\u2019t torture a student like that. He also added that there were times when one awakened to a supernatural power in such situations, but that wasn\u2019t always the case. If that were the case, the world would be full of supernatural power users.No.I know that.Actually, I did have a supernatural power.No matter how hard I tried to persuade them, they didn\u2019t seem to want to listen to me, so I just observed the class.And.Charlotte.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dCharlotte was taken somewhere by her dedicated teacher after the class started. Were they doing an ability check in the containment room like they did with Kono Lint? Was it a type of ability that should not be seen by others? I looked at the teacher and asked.\u201cWhat type of supernatural ability does the Princess have?\u201dI was just asking. Casually. You could ask such things out of curiosity, right? That\u2019s what I thought anyway.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHowever, the teacher just shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret or something\u2026.\u201dConfidential.It was then that I understood why no one was talking about Charlotte\u2019s ability.Charlotte had awakened to a supernatural ability.And no one knew what type it was, except a few teachers.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I had no other option but to silently wait until the class was over. Charlotte, who went somewhere and returned shortly before the class ended, looked tired.The Princess\u2019 ability was confidential. Maybe her classmates didn\u2019t know either. For some reason they treated her abilities like some state secret\u2026.Mr. Mustrang and the teacher in charge of her ability training were probably in the know.Did Mr. Epinhauser know?Charlotte was a supernatural ability user, and any talk about her abilities was under lock and key.If so, I should also consider the possibility that she didn\u2019t actually have one.There was also the possibility that she may have faked powers she didn\u2019t have in order to get into Temple as a member of the Royal Class. Well, whether that was possible or not is another question.So, did Bertus know what ability the Princess held? It was getting more and more troublesome. If the Princess didn\u2019t have any abilities and Bertus knew, then he wouldn\u2019t have a reason to stay silent about that. So, by that we can conclude that Bertus either also knew the Princess\u2019 supernatural power or he didn\u2019t know yet, no matter if the Princess had one or not.As the class was over, the teacher called me over.\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI will allow you to join the class for now, but keep in mind that you will receive failing marks if you decide to continue.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\u201dThere was no way a person without a supernatural ability could be given any kind of grade in a class focused on supernatural abilities.When I nodded my head gently, everyone was looking at me as if I was crazy. No, well, I did get that they wouldn\u2019t have any other choice but to fail me like this.I had no intentions of failing though.After class everyone left the classroom.\u201cHey, No. 11.\u201dAnd then, someone called out to me.\u201cHuh, what?\u201dIt was A-6 Heinrich von Schwarz who called me. I could see at first glance that he wore a bad kind of expression on his face and everyone started to stand by and decided to watch what was going on. Charlotte was already gone though. She seemed tired after all.\u201cIs Temple a joke to you?\u201dHe looked pretty uncomfortable, even if I pretended not to notice. It was the same for the others who gave me dirty looks.\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cThen why does a person who doesn\u2019t have supernatural abilities worm their way into classes for supernatural ability users?\u201dWhy was that bastard asking something so obvious right now?\u201cBecause I want to awaken one.\u201dAt those words, the expressions of the other kids, including Heinrich\u2019s, changed drastically as if they just heard something absurd.\u201cDo you seriously think that\u2019s possible?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? You never know if you don\u2019t try.\u201dHeinrich frowned as if he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\u201cI heard you\u2019re attending all major\u2019s lectures, right?\u201d\u201cThat I do.\u201d\u201cDo you seriously think you could do anything just because of your infinite aptitudes? You really believe that? Huh? You want to be a supernatural power user. Hah! Do you think you can be a Swordmaster or Wizard just because you want to?\u201dThe other students looked uncomfortable as well. Yeah, it did look somewhat bad, huh?\u201cI\u2019m just doing this because I think I might get something out of it.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026.\u201dHe looked exasperated.\u201cNever mind, just don\u2019t come to the supernatural power lectures anymore. If you come again, I\u2019ll grill you, you know?\u201dIt seemed like he didn\u2019t like the fact that I was taking the supernatural power classes. It looked like Heinrich tried to intimidate me by telling me he\u2019d grill me.\u201cGrill what? You wouldn\u2019t even be able to grill a potato.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my estimate after watching the size of your flame. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dHe did make some fire burn in the sand, but it was definitely not as good as a bonfire.Heinrich turned red at my words.\u201cWhat a great ability you have. If all you can do is make your eye color change and make a somewhat big fire with your arms trembling, wouldn\u2019t a flint be much more useful than you?\u201d\u201cWha, wha\u2026. What? Thi, this\u2026.\u201d\u201cWould you like to compete with it? You or a flint? Which one would be better? I expect a landslide victory for the flint. Flints don\u2019t run their smelly mouths like you do.\u201dHeinrich, whom I compared to a flint, was stammering, probably never having imagined to get insulted like that.\u201cN, n, now\u2026. D, do\u2026. Do you, even\u2026 know who you are in, insulting right now?\u201dThat guy eventually said some words that should never be said in here after getting pushed a little.\u201cThe one I\u2019m insulting is A-6 Heinrich von Schwarz. No matter how much you are of some fucking noble family, who\u2019d care about that in Temple?\u201d\u201cHow dare you insult the royalty of the First Principality, subject to the Heave-\u2026.\u201dI raised my hand as I watched him chatter on.\u201cAh, you should apologize to me.\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to mention your status in Temple. Did you forget that rule?\u201dI looked around at the spectators watching us with stunned expressions.Everyone who took the class, except Charlotte, were here. Kono Lint, Liana de Grantz, and even Ibia, were watching from afar.\u201cWe have witnesses here. Did you hear everything?\u201dHeinrich\u2019s face turned blue as he realized that he had just broken that rule in his excitement. Everyone suddenly looked away and frowned, when I was asking for witnesses.\u201cIf you don\u2019t apologize to me in three seconds, I\u2019ll report it to the student council.\u201d\u201cOoone.\u201d\u201cTwooo.\u201d\u201cThreeee.\u201dI turned around with that momentum. One more rule violated.\u201cSorry.\u2026I was acting too reckless.\u201dHe was a little late, but I smiled at him as he did give me an answer straight out.Why would you start an argument if you can\u2019t even finish it?\u201cWatch your mouth next time, buddy.\u201dI tapped his shoulder and whispered.\u201cThis is a place where royals wouldn\u2019t be able to complain, even if they get beat up by a commoner.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cThat means, if you do, things will be turned right back at you regardless of your status.\u201dNo matter what status he held, he wasn\u2019t even good enough to be a portable lighter here. Just when I was about to go past him, I heard him hitting the back of my head.\u201cHow dare you, you cheeky bastard!\u201d\u201cAh, what now?\u201dThe color in his eyes was getting more saturated.He looked like he was turning on a faucet. It seemed like he was trying to use his power.\u201cFrickin hell.\u201d-Slap!\u201cUgh!\u201dI casually walked over to him and hit his forehead with my palm. Of course, he staggered and was unable to use his ability like he intended to. I disturbed his concentration after all.\u201cAh\u2026? Huh?\u201dHe looked like he didn\u2019t understand what happened just now. It was like something that shouldn\u2019t have happened, had happened and he couldn\u2019t even articulate properly.It almost looked like he had question marks in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m gonna give it to you, you fucktard.\u201dDidn\u2019t these kids know that a fist would be way faster? Everyone was watching me blackly as I casually smacked the Prince of the First Principality. He seemed astonished beyond absurdity.\u201cHo, how\u2026 How dare that bastard touch my body!\u201d\u201cIt was legitimate self-defence. Weren\u2019t you trying to burn me just now?\u201dHe stared at me trembling while I just stood there nonchalantly.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you want to grill me? Huh? Go ahead. Try.\u201d\u201cI will kill you!\u201dThe color in his eyes got more saturated again.-Smack!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201cDid you think I would wait for you to charge up, you idiot?\u201dWas he stupid?\u201cEvery time you try to use your ability, you\u2019ll get a smack in the face. Okay? I\u2019m nice, so I\u2019ll keep it a secret that my dear classmate tried to attack me with his ability. Huh? You do know what a pain it\u2019ll be if I report this, right?\u201d\u201cI, I, Iiiiiiirrrrrk!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Didn\u2019t you want to kill me? Come on.\u201d\u201cHuup!\u201dAs soon as I raised my hand, he started holding his breath and pulled his head back.\u201cWhat a little coward.\u201d\u201cY, yo\u2026. You dog-like bastard\u2026.\u201dHeinrich\u2019s face was flushed red. It seemed like he was terribly embarrassed by the fact that he got scared.Eventually, he couldn\u2019t endure his anger anymore and rushed at me.-Crash!\u201cUgh!\u201dI smoothly took that childish rush of his and threw him off.There was no way that a well-bred royal knew how to fight. He was also a supernatural power user.\u201cWell, you think you can manage with your body alone?\u201d\u2013 Stomp!\u201cHey, hey! How about trying to get rid of these dirty feet of mine, huh?\u201dI turned to the spectators who didn\u2019t even have time to close their mouths as I stepped on Heinrich\u2019s head.\u201cYou guys clearly saw him trying to use his power on me, didn\u2019t you? Huh?\u201dLiana de Grantz was staring blankly. Kono Lint was almost trembling.They never imagined seeing such a scoundrel in this place.Anyway, that was that, but having a fight with a classmate and using their powers on a classmate were two crimes of very different magnitudes.\u201cI know you have a lot of pride, but do it in moderation, you hear?\u201dI mumbled coldly as I stepped on his head.\u201cWas I hurting you? I was just quietly taking this class. So why did you have to pick a fight with someone who was just staying quiet? The way I see it, shouldn\u2019t you be grateful to me? As I don\u2019t have any supernatural powers, aren\u2019t I laying the groundwork here?\u201dI squatted down, grabbed Heinrich\u2019s hair and whispered into his ear.\u201cYour ability\u2019s range currently is 5 meters across, it takes 10 seconds of preparation time and its firepower is less than a bonfire.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI observed today\u2019s class. So, as Heinrich and Liana continued to learn how to use their abilities, I practically had no other choice but to figure out the extent of their abilities.As I accurately gasped the extent of his powers, he opened his eyes wide, almost tearing them apart.\u201cIf you try to use your powers on me one more time in the future\u2026\u201dHow could I stay still when I had nothing. If someone would stand completely still in front of someone who clearly despised you while not possessing anything, that would be asking to get yourself killed.\u201cAt that time, if I don\u2019t suddenly change my mind in those 10 second, I might as well rip out your eyeballs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Mr. Epinhauser say it before? Huh? Let\u2019s be careful of each other.\u201dIf you didn\u2019t do anything and just endured it, you will be looked down upon.Being a fool was acceptable, but one should never be a pushover.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36On the first day I had to beat up Cayer.And on the third day I had to beat up Heinrich von Schwarz. This time, I wasn\u2019t called to see the teacher. If I were called in, I would just testify that he tried to use his ability on his classmate, although it would be a pain.However, this was different from the time with Cayer.Cayer was a commoner, Heinrich von Schwarz was the prince of Kernstadt, the first Principality of the Empire. Although he wasn\u2019t its successor, he was still a descendant.In other words, he was a descendant of the royal family, who had the second highest authority after the Imperial Family.\u00a0 This would be seen a shocking event by anyone, no matter how much they enforced the principle of equality and treated everyone fairly regardless of class.Rather than criticizing me, it seemed like everyone was avoiding me. They seemed to perceive me as a madman, someone actually crazy. At this point they didn\u2019t see me as just something dirty, rather I turned into a scary existence in their eyes.No, I mean, should I have let go of that guy who suddenly started arguing with me and tried to use his ability on me just because he couldn\u2019t stand the sight of me sitting still? Should I have actually gotten grilled, huh?After that, Heinrich would leave his seat as soon as he saw me, as if he saw something dirty. It seemed like he turned around in fury and anger, but he couldn\u2019t raise his hand against me in Temple.I didn\u2019t want to be seen as a pushover, so I became a nut job.Because if I didn\u2019t do this, some genuinely strong person might want to pick a fight with me. It would only be a matter of time before that would turn into a bloodbath, right? If that were to happen, I should absolutely get an ability I could actually use.Would my slow attacks even do anything against someone with a combat talent?My quiet life had been ruined, by none other than myself. So I had no other choice but take this route. It would be completely useless to pretend to be nice and kind to these people.And thinking back about it.I didn\u2019t think that I was ever really nice before. I mean, someone who gets actually mad at some kids in their thirties definitely had some problem with their head, right?The atmosphere of Class A, which had always been quiet, became even worse because of me.Did I actually become a type of villain in the story I wrote? I didn\u2019t do this on purpose, you know?No matter how one looked at it, I was the bad guy here.An initial villain who had no real power but a bad temper, right?After Thursday\u2019s common classes, evening.\u201cReinhardt, could I talk with you for a second?\u201dAfter dinner, Bertus finally called out to me.* * *After dinner, Bertus took me to a patio tea table. He still had a friendly smile on his lips. On the table was a teapot filled with black tea. He probably prepared this beforehand.\u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d\u201cWell, sure.\u201dBertus poured the tea gently into my cup. He put milk into his tea, while I just drank it as is. The Prince didn\u2019t seem to have any hostility towards me.I couldn\u2019t figure out what he thought about me being so casual with him by his expression alone.I didn\u2019t let my guard down because his expression didn\u2019t tell me anything.He was an aspiring Swordmaster. Those who picked a fight with me were mostly physically weaker than me. However, the Prince was someone who could step all over me if he so wanted. Both physically and politically.I wasn\u2019t his match in either of those aspects.If Bertus tried to impose physical sanctions on me\u2026How should I respond?It was the right decision to just become one of those typical strong against the weak and weak against the strong types.Bertus looked at me with a soft smile.A friendly attitude that seemed devoid of hostility.Ludwig was deceived by that attitude. Countless other people were, too.It was a soft smile that could even deceive me, who shouldn\u2019t be deceived by it.\u201cThey were all asking me to do something about this matter, so I\u2019ve decided to speak on their behalf with you.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cThey are afraid of you.\u201dHe euphemistically said they were scared of me, but in the end they simply didn\u2019t like me.\u201cOf course, I can understand your behavior to a certain extent. On the first day, Cayer was rather aggressive towards you. Even in the changing room.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it was also Cayer\u2019s fault for saying that your admission was of fraudulent nature.\u201dThe Imperial Prince.It wasn\u2019t me, but the Prince who was upset by Cayer\u2019s remarks that undermined Temple\u2019s authority. Did you feel refreshed inwardly after you came to stop the fight?\u201cI heard that you acted because you were indignant about him insulting Temple, not you personally.\u201dWhether he heard it from Mr. Epinhauser or through other channels, he knew about my appeal. That\u2019s why Bertus knew I pretended to be a patriot.\u201cAs a student of Temple I have to look at every person fairly. I have no choice but to. Although it is true that my heart is drawn towards such patriotic people.\u201dWhat?What\u2019s with that weird development?\u201cReinhardt, I like you very much.\u201dThis.The storyline got really weird!My hands would tremble less if he told me that he was going to kill me.What\u2019s with this? What direction is this going to? Huh?Bertus heard what I said to Mr. Epinhauser, and was now admiring my patriotism? No, well, it was a matter of course that the Imperial Prince holds strong patriotism.So he was looking favorably upon me? Because he thought that I was enduring all these insults towards my person, but would punch out as soon as Temple was insulted because I was that much of a patriot?Bertus was fiddling with his teacup while still wearing a soft smile.\u201cStill, I think this time you have gone too far. Of course, touching someone of a royal family is far more dangerous than a commoner. I\u2019m not talking about that point though.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI believe our dear classmates\u2019 imagination is running a bit wild.\u201d\u201cImagination?\u201dWhat did he mean?Bertus smiled as he looked at the nightly landscape of Temple as if he could see something beyond the horizon.\u201cThere is no way that a man with no talent whatsoever would ever touch the House of Schwarz with nothing to rely on\u2026. That is what they are spreading.\u201dI began to understand what he meant. \u2018Even if he was crazy, he\u2019s so crazy that there has to be something behind him\u2018, that\u2019s what they thought.\u201cSo\u2026. They think I\u2019m hiding something huge?\u201d\u201cCorrect. It could be a talent or it could be the power of your family\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dIf I were them I wouldn\u2019t be able to understand my behavior either, if there wasn\u2019t something like that behind me. They thought there couldn\u2019t be someone out there, not even a madman, who would beat up someone of a royal family out of rage.\u201cIt\u2019s not common, but there are people like that. People who hide their own status and enter Temple as commoners.\u201dI knew about that. There were students who couldn\u2019t live under their family name or those who had to hide their background for various other reasons, for example they don\u2019t want to get noticed. There were even such cases where they send a young nobleman here as a commoner, hiding his family background, and what he was met with was utter contempt, as such receiving true education.I was mistaken as someone like that.\u201cWhat\u2019s worse, even Heinrich is starting to believe it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hah?\u201dRecently, Heinrich had been avoiding me, pretending to sleep as soon as he saw me. It wasn\u2019t because he thought I was dirty, but because he truly thought I was scary?\u201cBy the way, how many families are there that aren\u2019t afraid of the Schwarz family?\u201dThings were going into a completely different direction I expected it to. They thought I had some background that would enable me to punch someone of the Schwarz Royal Family without a care.If so, wouldn\u2019t there be only one option then?\u201cI believe the others think you are the hidden son of a Royal Family.\u201dA child\u2019s imagination was sometimes even beyond an adults understanding. No, what stupid idiot would send their hidden son into an environment with two members of the Imperial Family?\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know that\u2019s not true.\u201dBertus looked at me as if he wasn\u2019t such a fool to believe in the trivial imaginations of children.Then he tilted his cup, still having that gentle smile float on his lips.\u201cSo, Reinhardt, let me ask you a question.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs there something you can place your trust in?\u201dBertus knew that me being from a Royal Family was nonsense. However he still was curious. About my true background. Even Bertus didn\u2019t seem to believe that I was just some ruthless guy in the end.However, the nature of my background could never be revealed. As it was on the level of turning the entire human race against me.\u201cAs if.\u201dI sighed and folded my arms.\u201cI don\u2019t need some crazy background to punch some fucker who\u2019s trying to walk all over me, now do I?\u201dI\u2019ll just go with that route.It was already too late to fix this anyway. I\u2019m sticking with the nut job route. So what if I hung some dog-bastard out to dry?I also had the Dreadfiend ring, so I could disappear any time I wanted.Bertus looked at me blankly with a slightly dumbfounded expression.\u201cHuh\u2026. You mean\u2026. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2026. So, you don\u2019t have something like that?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou just did that because you were in a bad mood?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026. Hah.\u201dBertus, who had been smiling all this time, slightly licked his lips.\u201cHaha, ha. Hahaha. Hahahaha. Haha!\u201dThen he suddenly burst into laughter. Bertus laughed for a long time, like a man who lost his mind.After laughing for a while, Bertus looked at me.That look chilled my spine. His eyes felt like those of a snake.This was Bertus true face. Just by looking at him one could feel goosebumps run up one\u2019s back.He looked at me with those eyes and quietly tilted his teacup.\u201cIn a situation like that, one would usually lie.\u201dIt was a lie.No, it could be seen as a lie, kind of, right? I did have a certain background. Ah.It might be a background that exceeded anyone\u2019s imagination though.\u201cIf you told me you had some great background or something, I would have have ignored you in the future.\u201dBertus was showing himself to me completely raw. It was completely different from those guys who had been yelling and swearing at me before.It was indeed a young man\u2019s gaze, but it seemed frozen.\u201cIt was wise of you to answer honestly. Reinhardt.\u201dHe seemed to have expected me to bluff my way out of this situation. I was just pretending to be that kind of person to not get beat up. Did he do a background check on me? Did he already know that I wasn\u2019t actually some big shot, and by saying these things was he trying to find out what kind of person I was?I shrugged my shoulders.\u201cI could have lied that there was nothing, though?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if there really is nothing about you, but you aren\u2019t a nobleman at least.\u201dBertus set down his teacup and stroked the rim with his fingers.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that a nobleman wouldn\u2019t know how to hold a teacup.\u201dThe tea wasn\u2019t prepared for no reason.He looked through me just by observing how I held a teacup and drank the tea.When I realized that my unconscious actions gave away information about my background, I got goosebumps all over my body.I was the one who set up this character, but it was hard for me to put into words how this guy was scaring me.If I bragged about my background he would have just ignored me. But I told him that I wasn\u2019t much. So what?\u201cYou should have bluffed, Reinhardt.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought about what Heinrich von Schwarz could do to you?\u201dI kind of thought about it. Of course, I rushed in with my body first, but I did organize my thoughts later. The price I would have to pay for touching someone of the Royal Family of Kernstadt, the First Principality of the Empire.However, I knew about Heinrich von Schwarz\u2019s background. I was pretty confident that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt me.\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cThe moment you step out of Temple, you might disappear without any trace for hitting someone from the House of Schwarz. Don\u2019t you worry about that?\u201d\u201cSure do.\u201dNo, I didn\u2019t really. Because something like that would never happen in the first place.\u201cThen when I told you that Heinrich was afraid of your unknown background, wouldn\u2019t it have been good if you kept these fears alive?\u201d\u201cSure would have been.\u201d\u201cThen why did you tell me the truth? Heinrich is very likely to harm you, and you should feel afraid of that.\u201dHeinrich was of a Royal Family, rather hostile and joined the Royal Class.However he was currently more or less in exile.No one in the Schwarz family looked favorably upon Heinrich. That was why Heinrich\u2019s status was just a shell. In reality, he was just some guy with no power or status.Therefore, I already knew that there would be no retaliation against me from that family he was practically abandoned by far in the distance.However, to tell him that I knew about these things would obviously be suspicious.So why did I deny this misunderstanding that would have kept me safe?\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been any good to tell such shallow lies in front of the Imperial Prince.\u201dIt would be better to say that I had foreseen this situation. I judged it to be more dangerous to deceive Bertus in order to keep myself safe from that guy called Heinrich.That was what I was going for.At my word, Bertus began to stare at me.\u201cI could tell Heinrich about this, you know? Wouldn\u2019t that be problematic for you?\u201dI felt like walking on a thin sheet of ice. Turning Bertus against me would put my life at risk. I decided to use the nut job route, but he wasn\u2019t really picking a fight with me, so there was no reason for me to snap at him.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\u201cYou said that when I lied, you would have just ignored me in the future. Then wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019d do something if I didn\u2019t?\u201dMy hand was just a dog\u2019s paw after all.Then, in this situation, Bertus wouldn\u2019t ignore me, but would try to do something.Maybe he\u2019d offer me a solution.Maybe he thought something like I wasn\u2019t someone he should ignore.\u201cAnd I do think Heinrich wouldn\u2019t be able to touch me, whatever my background, assuming he\u2019s not completely braindead.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cNo matter inside or outside of Temple, it wouldn\u2019t be normal for a Temple student, and a Royal Class student at that, to suddenly die in the Imperial Capital Gardium.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd if I actually were to die, the culprit would be all too clear. A Royal Class student from a commoner background fought with a member of the First Principality\u2019s Royal Family. If someone like that were to die suddenly, it would be very obvious whose knife stabbed him.\u201dIf I died with that timing, it would be obvious who killed me, so, of course, Heinrich would be the prime suspect. Bertus was smiling more and more.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be possible for the Schwarz Royal Family to use their power to cover up this case?\u201d\u201cOf course, that might happen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201dI looked at Bertus and smiled.I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but I couldn\u2019t stop now.\u201cI don\u2019t think our homeland, the Empire, would be swayed just by a Principality. Rather, wouldn\u2019t they be asked to pay for tarnishing Temple\u2019s honor?\u201dBertus\u2019 lips began to curl up at the expression \u2018homeland\u2019. Was he more patriotic than even Mr. Epinhauser?Now that I thought about it, my death would be a much bigger deal than I thought. I knew it wouldn\u2019t happen, but I decided to use my confidence in Temple and the Empire as the reason for that belief. Bertus seemed to admire my judgment.Bertus liked smart guys. He certainly picked up something about me, but it was different from our other classmate\u2019s judgement. Of course, it was because I knew a thing or two about this place\u2019s common sense.\u201cGreat.\u201dBertus was grinning as if there was no more need to talk.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I came to like a cheeky guy like you so much.\u201dWhat? What was with this situation?\u201cReinhardt, let\u2019s enjoy our life at Temple together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dWhy was the first person I got close at Temple the villain?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Why do you think that the first friend you made at Temple would make a good friend?Talented Villain.1. Nice to his subordinates.2. Would be able to hide me,So, becoming Bertus\u2019 subordinate wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing, but I was still scared. It did have advantages, but wouldn\u2019t it look like I\u2019m a double agent? Was he going to treat me like a subordinate in the first place? It would be hard to keep that going for a long time.If he were to place me under his wing, wouldn\u2019t he be the first and only member of the Imperial Family to ever make a Demon Prince their subordinate?Anyway, Bertus seemed to want to maintain a close relationship with me in our future Temple life.Of course, I knew Bertus.He was a talented guy. Whether they were commoners, nobles or royalty, if they had the ability, he would have serious interest in them.It didn\u2019t matter what kind of person they were, as long as they proved to be useful. That was the type of person he was.Bertus sat on the terrace railing this time. It was on the first floor, so one could go outside from it.He talked with his back to me.\u201cDo you love the Empire?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t a lie. I really did love it. This was the best place to live on the whole continent after all.\u201cWhy do you love it?\u201dHe didn\u2019t like obvious answers.\u201cBecause of money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What? Money?\u201dBertus turned his head to look at me. He\u2019d find out if we continued to be like this anyway, but I had to be a little more honest here.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to love a place that allows a helpless beggar to live in a palace like this just because there\u2019s something strange about him.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Beggar?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even on the level of not having any background, kid.\u201cI\u2019m from the streets.\u201dI was a beggar!Bertus opened his mouth slightly as if he had never imagined something like that. That made it clear that this guy didn\u2019t run a background check on me. Bertus didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, perhaps bewildered or perplexed, he nodded blankly as if he came back to his senses.\u201cAh, right\u2026.Yes\u2026. I know what you mean.\u201dI had been wandering around the streets.\u201cIf you dislike me for being a beggar, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dHe was fine with commoners, but what about beggars? We weren\u2019t just a Prince and a Pauper, we were the Imperial Prince and a Beggar.\u201cNo. I prefer it that way.\u201dHowever, Bertus gave me an unexpected answer. I couldn\u2019t believe it. He preferred it?\u201cBecause there\u2019s a strong basis for loyalty.\u201dNot only did I get to live in this place just because I had some form of talent, but it was also possible for me to hold a conversation with the Prince like this.He seemed to think that one could take my loyalty to the Empire for granted then. Yeah, that certainly was a convincing statement. As if he found it funny that I put it as being loyal because of money, Bertus chuckled.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of light hanging out with a beggar would shine on you. Well, my origins aren\u2019t exactly a secret or anything.\u201dI told Bertus another point I thought might be a problem. Surely it wouldn\u2019t paint a good picture and my origins would spread someday.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dHowever, Bertus cut me off.\u201cReinhardt, do you know about ants?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah.\u201d\u201cDid you know that they have a hierarchy in ant society?\u201d\u201cLike queen ant, worker ant and so on?\u201d\u201cYes. Like that.\u201dBertus was staring outside, as if he was peering through the darkness. Why was he talking about ants out of nowhere?\u201cQueen ants, worker ants, soldier ants and so on, there might be even more complicated systems, or none at all, but I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201dWere you proud of not knowing that?\u201cWhat do I know about classes among ants.\u201dBertus said coldly.\u201cBeggars, commoners, nobles, princes, dukes, counts, barons. Why would I care about that?\u201dThat was the type of guy Bertus was.\u201cThey look all the same below me, Reinhardt.\u201dBertus laughed grimly.\u201cSo, whether Heinrich von Schwarz criticized me or you criticized me.\u201dHe had pretty intuitive logic.\u201cIt would be all the same to me.\u201dAll were equal below him.Whether it was a soldier ant or the lowest of those ants trying to criticize him, he wouldn\u2019t care either way. He put it in quite the dog-like way, but in the end it meant he didn\u2019t care what I was.He told me not to worry about that and not to be too nervous about these things.\u201cThe core message is great, but the way you put was quite intense.\u201dLook at that twisted bastard.\u201cThat\u2019s what power is, Reinhardt.\u201dBertus giggled.\u201cThose who have it, have the freedom to be snobbish.\u201dHis choice of words were rather radical. Isn\u2019t it nice being treated comfortably?The powerful have the freedom to be snobbish.\u201cHowever you don\u2019t have that kind of power and yet you are the way you are\u201dAs for Bertus, he seemed interested in me because I was acting frivolous even though I didn\u2019t have any power at all. Because of that, some people judged me to be some mysterious person in the end.\u201cYou\u2019re a beggar and yet you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. Your eloquence isn\u2019t normally found in someone born in poverty.\u201d\u201cThere are all sorts of people in this world.\u201dBertus looked at me. It was as if he was trying to peer through me.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s find out what you are really hiding.\u201dHe seemed convinced that a beggar wouldn\u2019t be capable of that. He\u2019d treat me as a friend, but Bertus was obviously suspicious of me. However, one couldn\u2019t just manipulate my origins.That said, I didn\u2019t even try acting like a stupid beggar.I wasn\u2019t all that disappointed, as it was an inevitable result.In the end, Bertus wouldn\u2019t fully trust my background or rather the lack thereof.He didn\u2019t tell me to come under him, nor did I say that I would go under him.\u201cBut it is true that I don\u2019t have any abilities. So is there anything about me that you\u2019re interested in so much that you want to get closer to me?\u201d\u201cThose talents as meager as a rat are useless as of now. That\u2019s not to say that a physical scanner could explain everything about a human being.\u201dAfter Bertus revealed his true face, he didn\u2019t pretend to be kind in front of me anymore. Talents as meager as little rats. Bertus was criticizing the Royal Class students for being useless.He seemed to think that it was foolish to only believe in what that physical scanner showed. He was focused on indicators that that thing couldn\u2019t show.\u201cI\u2019d prefer someone who could use his head a little better a hundred times over some measly talent. Of course, someone with a good head on their shoulders punching people left and right is rather problematic. Well, as that was how you used to live, I can understand your behavior to some extent.\u201dBertus chuckled. \u00a0It seemed like he judged me as someone who was smart and had good judgement, but as soon as someone started to argue with me I would use my fist first. Since I was a beggar, he seemed to think that that was why I acted like that.No, but\u2026.I wasn\u2019t actually a beggar\u2026.\u201cWell, what I wanted to say stays the same, in the end. Try to hold in your temper.\u201dWe came back to the beginning and he ended up saying the same thing.\u201cI\u2019ll try, but only if those brats can be communicated with.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. That\u2019s all for now.\u201dBertus came down form the terrace railing and stood in front of me.\u201cWhen I\u2019m sure you\u2019re mine, let\u2019s talk about some more important things then.\u201dThe time for Bertus to trust me.The time for me to trust Bertus.That time hadn\u2019t come yet.But Bertus did recognize my worth, which is why he threw out the bait first. Something like \u201cDon\u2019t forget who recognized your value first\u201d.I knew without even thinking about it who came first.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I became friends with Bertus. No, we weren\u2019t quite friends yet. Anyway, even if I hadn\u2019t quite gained the Imperial Prince\u2019s favor yet, it did seem like he saw me in a positive light. I seemed to have been judged as a useful guy.There weren\u2019t any visible effects of that. He wasn\u2019t acting too friendly. Of course, we would talk casually, regardless of whether other people saw us or not. There were probably some rumors floating about by now, that the Imperial Prince was kind even so some crazy asshole.Classes on Friday included Divinity, Alchemy and Synthesis.Divinity studies were for those gifted with divine powers, so the only ones taking the class were Erich and Ashir from Class B. The rest were all regular class students who wanted to be priest or paladins.Of course, I understood what they were trying to teach, but I couldn\u2019t sense divine power at all. Using divine power as a Demon, would seem pretty funny, wouldn\u2019t it?Everyone who majored in Magic would study Alchemy as well. Unlike magic classes, Alchemy seemed quite doable. It was a fun class because it was a practical one.General Martial Arts.I almost fell behind while trying to understand it.In the end, this was close to P.E. Part 2.Fortunately no one, except Ludwig, even dared to make eye contact with me. It seemed like the rumor that I was a total nut job went around the Class A and B kids.When Erich saw me today in Divinity Studies, he seemed to avoid me and that man named Ashir who was also majoring in Divinity from Class B, immediately turned his head as fast as lightening after he made eye contact with me once.Well.I wasn\u2019t a bully, just some psycho they wanted to avoid.And the truth behind that rumor of me having some mysterious background still didn\u2019t seem to have spread yet.Did Bertus want the misunderstandings to be resolved on their own?It was true that I was an ill-tempered person, but I was also talentless. So if a strong guy came along, I was confident that that person, beating me up would set things right, but it seemed like those types of people were avoiding me because of that misunderstanding.Hidden royalty?Children and their imagination\u2026.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *As a rule, Royal Class students had to live in the dormitory. Of course, since most of the Temple students came from far away countries, most of them lived in Temple, but there were also some Temple students that lived in Gardium, so there were some cases of students commuting to school.Of course, Temple was huge, so one had to get up very early to leave the school and go outside.Among the members of the Royal Class, those who had a mansion in Gardium often went home on the weekends. There were no compulsory activities during the weekend. Everyone was free to study, play or do whatever they wanted.I could stay in the dormitory, but I\u2019d just be alone anyway. I had no clue how to awaken my ability.Well, I\u2019d better let them know how my first week went.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Where would I go?Of course to the Rotary Gang, the sewer area under the Bronzgate Bridge.\u201c\u2026\u2026So, you\u2019ve been beating up the kids, is what you mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026so to speak, erm, that\u2019s how it was.\u201dWhen I told Loyar about my Temple life, she looked at me. She seemed to think I hadn\u2019t gotten rid of old habits or something. After all, the way I acted kind of felt the same as the original prince, huh?\u201cNo, but it was them who picked the fight. Would I hit the back of the head of someone who was just minding their own business?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dAt my plea, Loyar looked at me as if I would do that.What\u2019s with that guy?\u201cPaw.\u201d-Pat\u201cDo, don\u2019t do this, Your Highness\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you keep looking at me like that, I\u2019ll tell you to show me your stomach.\u201d\u201cI, I really don\u2019t want to do that, Your Highness\u2026.\u201dShe was more straightforward than anyone I knew.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Naturally, Sarkegaar and Eleris weren\u2019t here. It was only Loyar. The gang members I met on the way asked me if I was doing fine in Temple, so I answered appropriately.Of course, I didn\u2019t tell them that I was beating up kids.\u201cI heard the Imperial Prince and Princess entered Temple as well.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?

In a way, just entering Temple was quite the dangerous endeavor, but now two of my classmates were of the Imperial Family.\u201cSo far, everything\u2019s fine, but I think the Prince is trying to lure me to his side.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.

Loyar seemed to be worried that my life would be in danger at Temple.And I didn\u2019t only come here to report my life at Temple to her.\u201cAnd, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like you to look into if you could.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s something Sarkegaar should do, to be exact, not you personally.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how far the reach of Count Argon Pontheus was, but Sarkegaar had the ability to transform, so it would be relatively easy for him to gather some information.\u201cIt seems like the Princess has a supernatural ability, and that power is considered to be confidential.\u201d\u201c\u2026The Princess. You\u2019re telling me she has a supernatural ability?\u201d\u201cYeah. I want you to look into that. Of course, there\u2019s no rush. I just feel a bit queasy having something in front of me that\u2019s kept a secret.\u201dI had a feeling that I needed to know what Charlotte was capable of. Perhaps Loyar hadn\u2019t even thought of that as she furrowed her eyebrows.I wanted to confirm if that confidential supernatural ability the Princess was said to have, was real, or if it was just a lie fabricated so that she could enter the Royal Class.If she held a dangerous ability, I had to be careful.\u201cI will relay the message to Sarkegaar.\u201d\u201cHow is it going with the train vendor strategy, by the way?\u201dA smile spread across Loyar\u2019s face, hearing my words.The Rotary Gang had changed their strategy from selling candies to passers-bys to selling goods on trains.\u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cOh, how good exactly?\u201dLoyar explained to me that their sales had risen to an unprecedented level.The items they sold also seemed to get good responses as they also sold simple snacks along with candy.Anyway, it felt rather weird for them to become general merchandisers.\u201cI was thinking about what toys to choose to sell, but I don\u2019t think things are running so badly as is.\u201d\u201cStrictly instruct them not to fight with the passengers, tell them to just get off or go to another compartment if they seem about to get into one. If they start hurting the passagers, sanctions will be imposed at the Imperial level. Then our business would be over.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dThis was an unlicensed business. If the vendors started to be shunned and caused the passengers inconveniences, there might be a possibility that the city guards would be dispatched to drive them away, or they might even permanently place guards on the trains.It would be nice if their income was stable enough to cut ties with the Thieves\u2019 Guild. It didn\u2019t feel particularly good for my group to potentially get controlled by someone else.I was about to go back after telling her those things, but Loyar called out to me.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t visit Eleris or Sarkegaar in person.\u201dNo, I was actually planning to stop by Eleris\u2019 shop though.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSince you are supposed to come from this place, it\u2019s alright to visit, but places like the mansion of Count Pontheus or Eleris\u2019 shop might be considered unnatural.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Yeah, that\u2019s true. But do we have to implement that already?\u201d\u201cYeah, there was a tail on you already.\u201dWhat? No, how did you detect that in the first place?\u201cI didn\u2019t take any actions because they seemed like Your Highness\u2019 classmates, but you will have to be careful with your actions in the future.\u201dI never thought that there would be people tracking my actions for some reason.I was careless.Dropping by the Rotary Gang was a good thing, because I was supposed to come from this place. However, things would have gotten dangerous if I went anywhere unusual like Eleris\u2019 Shop or the mansion of Count Pontheus.However, I couldn\u2019t believe I got followed.I wasn\u2019t some super human, so I couldn\u2019t just suddenly stop in some alley and go: \u201cHey. Come out\u201d. That was just impossible.I didn\u2019t have to think much about the reason why they followed me, because I could roughly guess. They probably went after me, because they were curious about how great I really was.I should refrain from going to the Rotary Gang from now on. Loyar told me that she would send me a message from her side if necessary.There was the possibility that the Prince might put tails on me, so if I came into contact I seriously had to check my back. I was really very glad that I first stopped by the Rotary Gang. If I decided to go anywhere else first things might have gotten pretty troublesome.And.\u2013 Here comes the beggar.I was now facing a less cumbersome situation compared to being caught.* * *Upon hearing Loyar\u2019s warning I immediately returned to Temple. I also went to talk to the guys I believed might have followed me.However as soon as I entered the lobby of the Class A dormitory, all the students who stayed behind were staring at me with a look of contempt. Apparently, the rumor had already been swept away. They knew I was a beggar.And the guys standing on the forefront, Cayer and Erich, were staring at me.\u201cHey, why were you hanging out with the beggars under the bridge? Are you a beggar?\u201dI nodded at Erich\u2019s words.\u201cHuh. You\u2019re just a bum from the streets?\u201dWhen I readily agreed, the expressions of the people looking at me became spectacular.I guessed they were expecting me to deny having hung out with beggars. However, when I just came out as a beggar, they were dumbfounded.I stared at Erich and Cayer.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re trying to tease me for being a beggar and making a fuss about it. But, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t heard this crap once or twice before. It\u2019s annoying.\u201dI sighed with my arms crossed.\u201cIf I were you guys, I would rather not touch me if I knew that I was from the streets.\u201dAs I took one step closer, Cayer as well as Erich stumbled a step back..\u201cWha, what? You\u2019re just a beggar\u2026.\u201d\u201cYo, you dirty bastard rolling around with beggars\u2026. Stay away from me\u2026..\u201dIt was kind of funny how they were running their mouths while feeling scared shitless.\u201cWhat do you think would happen if someone who lived a rough life on the streets suddenly came here and some bastards were staring down at them?\u201dI took yet another step towards them while they took another step back.\u201cHuh? Your eyes are spinning suddenly. Yeah, you\u2019re supposed to be scared of this, right?\u201dAs I approached them with gleaming eyes, they tried to retreat. Eventually they reached the couch and fell on top of it. They looked white as a sheet as if they were intimidated by my words.\u201cI don\u2019t think you know this because you\u2019re still kids, but you don\u2019t mess with people who have nothing to lose.\u201dYou\u2019re glad that I was just a beggar? I don\u2019t have anything like a powerful background, so you think you can handle me?Adults, you see, are more afraid of people like that.People who had nothing to lose wouldn\u2019t think about what they could lose by doing certain things.\u201cIf some crazy guy down on their luck feels threatened, huh. I don\u2019t know. Like this. They\u2019ll hit you. You want to feel that? Huh? If you want me to show you, just say so. Ah, don\u2019t you want to know? You do want to see it, don\u2019t you? So, do you want me to show you or not?\u201d\u201cTha, tha\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuh, should I show you or not!?\u201dI shouted at Cayer.\u201cN, no\u2026. No\u2026.\u201d\u201cNext. You, you bastard. Erich. Should I show you? Tell me.\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2026. Show me what\u2026. What do you want to show me!?\u201dErich frantically shouted.\u201cHow about showing your right eye what your left eye looks like, huh? Do you think I won\u2019t be able to harm you even with a knife because you\u2019re stronger than me and you have decent stamina?\u201dWhile I explained with a dirty look, Erich shook his head violently, his face blanched, perhaps imagining it.\u201cI see. If you ever feel like wanting me to show you that, you just have to follow me again.\u201dWhen I smiled at them like a psycho, those kids looked like they were about to pee their pants.Those who were watching this scene weren\u2019t any different.They seemed to wonder what was wrong with a beggar bastard like me.In fact, they seemed to have realized that I was an even crazier psycho than they first thought.\u201cIf you\u2019re so full of energy on the weekend, just play some ball. How could kids not know how to play like kids\u2026. Tsk.\u201dI patted the cheeks of those two who had just lost their face.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It seemed that it was Erich and Cayer who followed me. I also wondered if Heinrich would come at me all excited after he heard that I was just a beggar, but he didn\u2019t.The fact that I was a beggar would probably spread around rather quickly, but thanks to that scene I just showed them, the rumor that I was just some maniac who didn\u2019t know how precious life was would spread much faster.I was sure they would become even more reluctant to touch me, although it would probably be better for me if I didn\u2019t directly saw these kids giving me ugly looks. Well, right now I was just keeping them at bay with my crazy gangster bluff, but depending on the results of my training I would become a real hard hitter.I mean, what else could I do?Even if I got into a fight and acted tough, what was most important were my abilities after all, so it was important to unlock that damn locked ability.In the end, I couldn\u2019t think of anything even after the sun went down, so I was kind of worried.Just when I was thinking about my future.-Knock, knock.Someone knocked on my door.What?Is it finally time for me to show them something nice? Were they coming to pick another fight with me? Did they forget already?\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dWhen I opened the door, I saw a totally unexpected person standing there.It was a pretty girl who was wearing a track suit even though it was the weekend. My apprentice in the studies of Cheonggukjang.It was Ellen Artorius.\u201cGo to the gym.\u201dNot \u201cWould you like to come to the gym\u201d but \u201cGo\u201d? What was she talking about? Who told her to bring me to the gym?\u201cWho wants me to come?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think she\u2019s a senior.\u201dSenior?What nonsense was that?\u201cThe others went, too.\u201dWhat was the meaning of this?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Somebody had to go call me, but no one wanted to do it, so it seemed like Ellen went. But why the hell did a senior call us?The gym was in the form of a very large hall. All the Year 1 Class A students present in the dormitory were gathered here, except those that were away over the weekend.Everyone was there except Bertus and Liana de Grantz, who had a mansion in the Capital.So there were 9 people in total\u2026.Why were they doing that?\u201cIs he the last one?\u201dEllen nodded her head. I could see my classmates in prone position and a little kid trying to keep as grim of an expression on her face as possible.That little brat spoke.\u201cWhat are you doing? Lie down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you get down already?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform, but she was indeed a kid. I mean, I was a child as well, but she was more of a child than I was.Wasn\u2019t she just a middle schooler?But that brat was supposed to be our senior?Ellen lay face down next to the other children. The little one then looked at the lying children and started to talk.\u201cGuys. I think your friend has rather bad ears.\u201dThe children were staring at me and seemed to cuss me out very hardly with their eyes. They were telling me to quickly lie down. No, but why were these prideful bastards doing this just because of one little brat?\u201cDon\u2019t you understand words?!\u201dThe little brat screamed.\u201cWhat kind of senior are you?\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2026?\u201dAs soon as I said that, the little brat\u2019s expression turned into bewilderment.\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2018re a senior? Someone as tiny as you? What\u2019s so crazy about this little thing that everyone is lying on their bellies?\u201dThe faces of my classmates who were lying down turned bizarre.\u201cYo, yo\u2026. You don\u2019t know who I am\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, get out of here before I flick you. So annoying.\u201d\u201cEeek!\u201dWhen I raised my hand suddenly, the little brat stepped back in confusion. Her face turned blue.How could this girl be like that? That look.She seemed confused.\u201cY, you\u2026. You are done here.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dThe blue faced little brat gnashed her teeth at me and strode out of the gym. Everyone was looking at me blankly, doubting their own eyes at this crazy thing I did again.Although, this time, my mad act seemed more welcome than before.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you getting up?\u201dEveryone slowly began to get up with puzzled expressions on their faces. I looked towards Cayer, not the others.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dHe was a pushover after all.\u201cAh\u2026. No, this.\u201dCayer hesitated to explain as it might hurt his pride.\u201cAh, hey!\u201dWhen I came towards him with a harsh look in my eyes, he hesitated first but then opened his mouth.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39\u201cWhat a sight.\u201dWhen I heard the explanation from Cayer, I was dumbfounded and burst into laughter.What transpired just now was a tradition passed down from generation to generation in Class A.They called this \u2018Draining\u2019. They did this to prevent the nobles and royalty, who were said to be narrow-minded, from acting up. It seemed that this absurdity came into being as a means to show everyone that they were equal.As a result the 2nd graders would come and knock down the 1st graders. They would also tell them at the same time that they should never lose to Class B and that they would kill them if they ever lost to them. They were trying to do that today, the first weekend after the start of the school year.That\u2019s why they were making people lie down regardless of their status, telling them that there were only the seniors who were superior to them regardless of their status. So it was rather ridiculous for me to act like that towards her, so that brat was dumbfounded.I had no idea something so absurd was a tradition in Class A. This was mainly due to my focus on the Class B dormitory. That unwillingness to lose to Class B of Class A was also coerced by their seniors. Something like that?The students of Class B would have fun, eating good food with some nice seniors\u2026Students from Class A sure had a lot of personality, regardless of grade, huh?Well, I was sure to be the one who had the biggest personality of them all though\u2026\u201cSo a commoner upperclassmen would come here to teach the freshmen of Class A like this every year?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard\u2026.\u201d\u201cWho was that brat just now?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a sophomore and her name is\u2026 Her name is\u2026\u201d\u201cRedina, she didn\u2019t tell us her talent.\u201dKono Lint who was next to him told me in his stead. So originally, this was an important event of a commoner completely crushing the sense of authority of the royalty and nobility. This year, that little brat was the one in charge.Anyway, they probably felt it was ridiculous for everyone to be treated like that, but as it was a tradition they were clenching their teeth. Even if it hurt their pride a little, it would hurt a lot more having to leave Royal Class.They must have thought that all the other nobles and royals of the Royal Class had received that treatment.Anyway, the royals and nobles swallowed their pride and were quietly undergoing the process of de-authorization, to find out what it\u2019s like to be a beggar.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was focusing their attention on me for some reason. Everyone was just staying in the gym wondering if it would be alright to leave like this.\u201cHey.\u201dNo. 4, Harriet de Saint-Owan, called out to me worriedly. That Harriet with the Magic talent.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWill you take responsibility if this goes wrong?\u201dIt was like she was asking me why I didn\u2019t just leave that pride that had already been bent, bent. She had a pretty face, but was ferocious, and a total jerk.\u201cAnd what would happen if it went wrong?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d look bad to our seniors.\u201dI thought she was talking about what image the seniors had of us.\u201cAnd what would happen if they see us in a bad light? What then?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat will happen if the seniors see us in a bad light?\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2019s it\u2026.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you be able to go to class or won\u2019t you be able to sleep? If they beat us up, we should report it to the teachers. Why did you flop on your belly if that\u2019s all there is to it? Do you guys have no guts? How could you have even less pride than me who came from the streets? Tsk.\u201dSigh. When I looked at everyone disdainfully and tsked, everyone, except Ellen and Cliff, had red hot faces.They probably thought that if they didn\u2019t listen they would get into trouble, so they clenched their teeth, thinking about the honor and social recognition they would receive after graduating from the Royal Class.They felt like shit, but they tried to bear with it, but that\u2019s when I waltzed in and flipped the table.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s your responsibility! We did what we were told! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that! Okay?\u201dHarriet yelled at me, thinking that she had just lost all her pride and face.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if this will mess up my life at Temple.\u201dIt seemed that Harriet thought that I would be no harm to her because I kept still and didn\u2019t touch her before.What a joke.\u201cKill me? Were you just saying whatever came to your mind? Do you think I can\u2019t beat you?\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201d\u201cWhere could status and rank, as well as the difference between man and woman be found in\u00a0 the Royal Class, which views everyone equal before talent? If you act big, you\u2019re gonna have my handprint imprinted on your cheek for the next few weeks. You hear?\u201dI\u2019m quite experienced when it came to death. I had already died once after all.None of you have died before, right? Well, I have!As I took a step closer, Harriet slipped back in surprise.\u201cThe only thing you got going for you is a hard head. So how are you gonna kill me?\u201d\u201cHe, he\u2026. H, Head?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWhen I treated the Princess of the Saint-Owan Grand-Duchy as someone whose only strength was her hard head, everyone\u2019s expressions became strange.\u201cHu, huh\u2026. Huh! Huh!\u201dHarriet felt more insulted and humiliated then when she had to lie on her stomach, so her face turned apple red and she couldn\u2019t bring out a single coherent word.-Bang!\u201cCome forward, you bastard!\u201dAnd.This time a group of people stormed into the gym.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *There were a total of five people who stormed in. They were probably in their second year of high school, so they were 18 years old. Of course the kid from earlier was among them as well.\u201cIs it him?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe little brat called Redina hid behind a male classmate and pointed at me. What, you were just some cute little brat with your classmates, huh? This looked like a little sister calling her big brother after a fight. That guy looked like he was about to shout \u201cHow dare you mess with our child with that attitude of yours?\u201d.The senior who seemed to be the leader of the group, was looking at me with a twisted expression. Wow, it was so bizarre to see a high school student do this in real life.\u201cHey, junior. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cReinhardt.\u201d\u201cHuh. You\u2019re probably from some great noble family and don\u2019t know how the Royal Class operates\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a noble though?\u201dIt seemed like I was mistaken for some kind of aristocrat, and despite the circumstances, laughter erupted among my first-year classmates.\u201cWhy are you laughing? What\u2019s so funny?\u201dThe atmosphere behind me became chilly again due to this senior\u2019s criticism.\u201cSo what? Are you a royal?\u201d\u201cNope?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dThen the boy\u2019s expression turned strange. I was neither a noble nor a royal. So there was only one conclusion.\u201cWhat are you saying? The only one from the Imperial Family here is supposed to be Bertus? You\u2019re Reinhardt, right?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s from the Imperial Family?\u201dI laughed and then said:\u201cI\u2019m not a noble, nor am I a royal, nor a part of the Imperial family, but just a beggar from the streets, what about it?\u201dEveryone was stunned by my bold declaration.\u201c\u2026. A beggar? You are a beggar?\u201d\u201cYeah, a beggar.\u201dEveryone seemed shocked at how casually I was saying that. The one that seemed like their representative looked at me with his arms crossed, completely speechless.\u201cNo, then why are you acting so high and mighty like the nobles and royals do?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do something, you don\u2019t. What\u2019s the big deal? Can\u2019t a beggar have pride?\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dHe clenched his fist and began to approach me.\u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to beat it out of you. Let me give you a good beating.\u201d-Pow!I felt it as soon as I got hit.That guy was the real deal.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The atmosphere was even chillier than before.\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201dIt hurt like hell. That was all I could think off. His fist hit really hard, no joke.\u201cAnd haven\u2019t you been really silent since earlier?\u201dWhen I stepped back holding onto my stomach, he started approaching me slowly.I\u2019ve been acting like I was mad up until now, and I thought I would be able to get this guy like that.However, this was unexpected. This guy was a senior after all, not one of my classmates. It seemed clear that our physical abilities couldn\u2019t even be compared with. That was the difference a year could make.\u201cIf you are part of Royal Class.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrg!\u201d\u201cFollow the Royal Class\u2019 traditions.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cIf it were up to me, you would be long dead. Got that?\u201dI was getting helplessly beat up by an 18 year old kid while he was casually talking. I couldn\u2019t stand getting beat up like that, so I ran towards him.\u201cHeh.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrrg!\u201d\u201cDid you just try to hit a senior, huh?\u201dAlthough he was startled by the fact that I tried to punch him, that guy avoided my fist just by moving his head a bit. He then laughed and grabbed my hair.\u201cThis bastard is for real.\u201d-Pow!He beat my chest.\u201cReally.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrgh!\u201dHe hit me in the abdomen.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d-Pow!\u201cHeup!\u201dI got hit in my face. My classmates and seniors were watching me get beat up blankly.What was surprising, was\u2026The look on their faces wasn\u2019t a refreshed one. They were obviously looking scared.I realized it as I got hit in the head.Even though I couldn\u2019t fight.I felt like I had won.\u201cYou\u2019re just a little bit-\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d-Kak!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201cGot you now, you fucking bitch.\u201d\u201cKuaaaaarg!\u201dI grabbed that man\u2019s crotch with all my strength. It slapped me right in the face, so I just grabbed it like a crown of victory.Well.It was average for a high schooler.\u201cSay \u201cSpare me\u201d. Go for it.\u201d\u201cArggghhgghgh! Hey. Hey. Let go. Let go, while I\u2019m still being niiiiaargh! Please!\u201d\u201dThat guy was now being tested on the limits of his vocal cords and his balls.The other seniors who witnessed that astonishing scene now approached to stop me.\u201cI won\u2019t stop!\u201d\u201cAh, no! You, you crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer, you bastards!\u201d\u201cYaaaarggghghghg! Urrrgggggghhhhaaaah!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s twisting. Huh? Ain\u2019t it twisting nicely? Huh? If you come any closer, I\u2019ll twist it all the way around! Oh, looks like he\u2019ll have to live as a seedless watermelon for all his life then. Ah. Dunno how long it will take, but if you come any closer, then this guy can say his descendants goodbye! Huh!\u201dHearing my threats everyone was unable to rush to his aid, as I put even more strength into my grasp.\u201cLe! Le! Let goooOOoOOOOoooh!\u201d\u201cSay, please spare me.\u201dThe male students all cringed unconsciously at that scene of horror.\u201cS, sp, Spare! Spare me!\u201d\u201cYou have to add the please. Mind your language! Please! Do it!\u201d\u2013 Clennnch!\u201cPlease spaaaaaheaaaare meeeiiiiik! Eerk!\u201dBoy, you\u2019re starting to sound like a girl.\u201cLetting go now? Not a chance.\u201d-Clennnch!\u201cUwaaaarrrrrrrrkkkkkkk! Krrrrk! Aeeeek!\u201dHe just let out some really weird voice.I was getting goosebumps now too.\u201cTake your friends and get out.\u201dI muttered grimly.\u201cYou can come beat me up whenever, but if you do it, I\u2019ll really break your stuff here until it can\u2019t be fixed, so be prepared. Oh, and next time I\u2019ll really twist it all the way around.\u201dI let go of him and then looked down at the man now collapsed on the ground.\u2013 Kick!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201cTake this thing away, you bastards.\u201dAs the finishing touch, I peppered a kick into his face.* * *Two of the seniors rushed to take him and then disappeared, perhaps because getting that bubble blowing bastard treated was more urgent.\u201cYou crazy psycho pervert!\u201d\u201cKeep the praise coming.\u201dThat little girl named Redina followed behind that kid who got taken away while crying. She seemed incredibly shocked. However, there was still one senior left in the gym. Although she looked like she had just seen something absurd and terrible, she was a relatively calm-looking woman.\u201cAren\u2019t you going?\u201d\u201cJunior, don\u2019t make the situation worse.\u201d\u201cThen do you want to beat me up? Will you twist my thing off?\u201d\u201cJunior, I just want to have a good conversation. Since there is no one else here, why don\u2019t you show me the least bit of respect?\u201dI felt a certain sense of crisis from that invitation in this kind of situation.I don\u2019t know what it was about her, but she seemed strange. She looked like an adult, and I guess she just told me to stop this.I\u2019d talk nice to the people who talked nice to me, and the others seemed to have given up on thinking about this development.\u201cYes, well. Sure. So what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Adriana, a sophomore at Royal Class, A-2. You said you were Reinhardt, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dShe gave me her name. Did she really only want to have a good conversation with me?\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this either. It\u2019s been done for generations, so the upperclassmen put pressure on us, too. To do it quickly.\u201dIt was the classic hereditary system. How absurd.They forced them to do it, even if they didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201cRedina is a weak-hearted girl. She wouldn\u2019t be able to harm anyone, she would rather hurt herself than having to talk harshly to you guys. Her seniors nominated her and forced her to do it.\u201d\u201cYou could just not do it. Why do it, if you\u2019ll only get hurt in the process?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s been done like this for so long. I know it sounds weird. But if one would want to just stop a tradition that had been going on for such a long time for no good reason, things would become troublesome.\u201dAdriana certainly didn\u2019t seem like she enjoyed doing this. However, with pressure coming from the higher grades, it was eventually decided for the small Redina to do it and she wasn\u2019t even that type of person.\u201cIf we say that we didn\u2019t do it, maybe the third graders will come. At that time\u2026. Will you be able to manage?\u201dShe asked me if I would kick out the third graders by doing some unspeakable, shameful thing again like just now.\u201cThe higher the grade, the harder it is for them to hold back. You. You might actually get hurt.\u201dYeah, the more time one spent at Temple, the stronger one would get. I was beaten like a dog by a second grader, but I took advantage of his carelessness and got hold of his weak spot. There wouldn\u2019t be such a chance if the older students started coming.\u201cDo the teachers just watch this stuff?\u201d\u201cThey acquiesce to it\u201dIt would actually be quite comfortable for the teachers, if the troublesome guys got straightened out like this. They could use the seniors to rail in the ones that danced out of line and rehabilitate them.\u201cLet\u2019s just do things in moderation, Junior. If things get blown even bigger, we\u2019d get scolded by our seniors, but you would be in even greater trouble.\u201dIn conclusion, \u201cCan\u2019t you just bow down like it usually goes?\u201d. She certainly seemed like a communicative person as she was even trying to gently advice me. Still, she didn\u2019t seem to want to take on the hassle to break this circle of absurdity.Don\u2019t make a fuss and be nice.Can\u2019t you just endure it for a bit and pretend that you\u2019ve been convinced?That\u2019s what she had been suggesting and requesting.Well, that was possible. I could see that she really was a communicative person.\u201cTell the third years to come. Weren\u2019t they the ones who made you seniors do this? If those bastards want it to be done, they should do it themselves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.What?\u201dAdriana expressed her astonishment as she didn\u2019t expect me to go down that route.Second years, third years!Just come at me!\u201cInstead, they shouldn\u2019t come today or tomorrow.\u201dI chuckled.\u201cTell them to come on Monday. Monday night, to be exact.\u201dI knew why they chose the weekend. Adriana bit her lips as she immediately understood what I was saying.\u201cLet\u2019s see whether those third years can tell Imperial Prince Bertus de Gardias to bend down. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have all of us present? I really can\u2019t quite understand why you have to do it at this time. We should do it together. I promise that I\u2019ll accept this stuff when they come over on Monday.\u201dI could see why they would do this on the weekend.They must have confirmed that the Prince returned to the Imperial Court over the weekend.No matter how much he was part of the Royal Class, they didn\u2019t want to touch the Prince. They could do these things to other nobles or royals, but I didn\u2019t think they would dare to actually touch the Prince.\u201cIf those third years won\u2019t come on Monday, I believe something like this would never happen again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was astonished that I dared to mention the Prince. Adriana just sighed briefly with her eyes closed.\u201cYou\u2019re really one great kid.\u201dThe senior with the calm demeanor left the gym with these words.She didn\u2019t think I was crazy enough to mention the Prince.I turned around and talked to Harriet de Saint-Owan.\u201cI took responsibility, alright, you idiot.\u201d\u201c.\u2026\u2026Hey, don\u2019t call me an idiot! I, I\u2019m smarter than you!\u201d\u201cYeah, a high quality idiot.\u201d\u201cThi, this! This!\u201dShe shouted with her face red, but she seemed relieved that this situation had been resolved somehow.The looks they gave me seemed a bit different from before as they slowly dispersed one by one.They felt like they just found a bizarre use for this psycho, a beast that should be avoided.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40At first, I obviously didn\u2019t want to stand out much, but that had become a thing of the past. I\u2019ve already caused too many incidents, to just get rid of this attention.Yeah, well, it would work out somehow. It was true that the looks my classmates gave me changed after I fought with the seniors. Of course, it wasn\u2019t even close to goodwill.I mean, the fact that I was still a wild animal in their eyes didn\u2019t change. I just told those guys that they should come back when the Prince is around after all.I somehow got into the position of a madman who was a bit better than they expected, I guess?\u201c\u2026You sold my name?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI told Bertus, who returned to the dormitory on Sunday, the truth. I thought it would be better if I told him with my own mouth rather than him, finding out in a different way later. I talked to Bertus on the terrace from last time. There were few people around so it was easy to have a good talk.Bertus seemed speechless when he heard that I sold his name and forced our seniors to step down.\u201cI knew there was such a tradition in the Royal Class, but when I was wondering why they didn\u2019t come, they just looked at me\u2026\u201dBertus didn\u2019t have to pretend to be friendly or talk nicely in front of me.Bertus knew that there were such traditions, but he seemed to have been more curious as to why they hadn\u2019t come.\u201cSo, what if the seniors come on Monday? Knowing what you told me just now, wouldn\u2019t it be you who made me lie down rather than the seniors?\u201dBertus smiled insidiously, asking me with his eyes if I wanted to die.\u201cThere\u2019s a very high probability that they won\u2019t come, but even if they do, it would be quite the funny sight.\u201d\u201cFunny?\u201d\u201cI mean, whether you do it or not, wouldn\u2019t they become quite restless?\u201dIt would be funny if he did end up doing it, but even funnier if he didn\u2019t. They\u2019d think things like: \u201cDo we beat up the Prince now?\u201d. And even if he did lay down on his stomach, the guy who ordered would probably die from a heart attack. No matter how simple the system of Temple was, with the only type of status being senior and junior, the Imperial Prince and Princess were the second most noble aristocrats of this world as the Imperial authority was piercing the skies now.Reality was very different from rules.The son of a great noble could be worked with, but the Imperial Prince was just too high up in class.Bertus was smiling at the bastard who dared to sell his name.\u201cFine, but still, selling the name of the Imperial Prince is a serious crime. You didn\u2019t refer to your classmate Bertus, but to Prince Bertus de Gardias. You obviously didn\u2019t refer to me as a friend, now did you?\u201d\u201cI suppose that is what I did?\u201dHe was right though, as I didn\u2019t refer to him as my friend Bertus, but as the Prince. Was this guy mad?Should I use the ring to run away?\u201cUsually, it would make sense to kill your whole family for that sin. But I don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019ve used me once, so wouldn\u2019t it be fair if I got to use you once as well?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dWould there even be anything I could do for him? In any case, Bertus did offer me a rather fair deal. Speaking the Prince\u2019s name was certainly possible within the walls of Temple, but it would be a rather shocking thing to do on the outside.\u201cI know you take some classes with my half-sister.\u201dHe probably meant Charlotte.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much I\u2019m asking of you. Just let me know if you notice anything unusual.\u201dI should keep an eye on Charlotte and report to him if I see anything unusual. He didn\u2019t want me to be friends with him or do anything behind the scenes.But in the end, wasn\u2019t I gradually becoming Bertus\u2019 pawn?It felt rather annoying.\u201cSure thing.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThere was nothing special about it. We didn\u2019t talk much in the first place. In my current state I didn\u2019t have any leverage at all.He didn\u2019t seem to care much about me. Did he even know who I really was?\u201cAnd, uhm, get along with the other kids.\u201dBertus sighed, pretending to be angry.\u201cBy my standard, I\u2019m trying to get along quite well here though? What. Didn\u2019t I save the kids from being harassed today, in a way?\u201dAt my absurd remark, Bertus burst out laughing.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s considered nice to call Princess Saint-Owan an idiot though?\u201dDid she whine to you about that?*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *It wasn\u2019t really a secret that Bertus and I were speaking to each other. As a result, the way my classmates looked at me became quite strange.I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever get along, but we did talk to each other for a bit, and from a distance, it would seem that we were quite friendly with each other.I revealed myself to be a beggar, but Bertus didn\u2019t seem to be particularly mad with me, who actually dared to sell his name.My classmates didn\u2019t seem to quite understand this.\u201cBe, Bertus!\u201dErich seemed to have contemplated for a while and then ran to Bertus from across the terrace.\u201cYes, do you have something to say to me?\u201d\u201cB, be careful of that guy\u2026.\u201d\u201cAah, Reinhardt? Don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s just a bit clumsy.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026.\u201dWell, no matter how one looked at it, even I would think that I wasn\u2019t like that just because I was a little clumsy.It looked like he had that nonsensical thought that I might end up harming the Prince because I was just some lowly bastard. I couldn\u2019t hear them that well as they were getting further away from me.Come to think of it, I was definitely more useful than Erich.At the moment, at least.That image that the Prince seemed to be closer to me than the other kids was spreading around, mystifying the other kids.About my job?I also didn\u2019t know what I was going to do about it.Bertus definitely was the type of person that would treat me well if I had proven myself to be useful.Even if I decided to leave after I made my profit later, it would be better to cooperate with Bertus for now. Unless he asked me to do something bad to Charlotte.As I was leaving the lobby and heading towards the dormitory, I saw Harriet sitting at a table, drinking tea and reading a book.When she made eye contact with me she frowned.\u201cHmpf!\u201dShe turned her head sharply with a \u201cHmpf!\u201d as soon as she saw me. What\u2019s with that? She did it so obviously. Wasn\u2019t this rather cute?What the hell was she supposed to be? A noble high school girl?Hmpf! She said. When was that fashionable again?\u201cIdiot.\u201d\u201cWha, what?!\u201dHer face turned red again, while I just shrugged.\u201cI was just saying a random word. What? Is your name Idiot?\u201d\u201cU,uh\u2026. Uuung\u2026.\u201dWhat\u2019s this? Had she already gotten used to getting called \u201cIdiot\u201d? Would she turn her head now every time someone said \u201cIdiot\u201d?\u201cYou said, you were smart, right? This isn\u2019t good, you know?\u201d\u201cThis!\u201dShe sprang up and strode towards me.\u201cYou just keep provoking me, so that I\u2019ll bring up my identity and when I do you\u2019d just run to the teacher to tell on me so that I get punished! Huh!\u201dIt seemed like she had a pretty vivid imagination. She seemed to think that I would go around provoking people so that they\u2019d say something like: \u201cHow dare you, I\u2019m the son of XXX\u201d, ultimately violating the school rules.Well, she might think that I\u2019d do that, because I was supposed to be a nut job.\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really thought of doing that\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen why are you doing this to me?! I\u2019m not an idiot! I\u2019m not right? So why are you doing this, you bastard?!\u201d\u201cNo, well. The payout is just too great. All kinds of reactions come out with every single word I say. Wouldn\u2019t you do this as well?\u201d\u201cWhat? Pay\u2026. Pay, what?\u201dWith every single word I told her all kinds of dramatic reactions came out, so I really just did this because it was fun. I walked past her who was looking to say something with a flushed red head.\u201cCute.\u201d\u201cWha, what? What did you say\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re cute, you\u2019re a genius but also silly and childish.\u00a0 It\u2019s to my taste. I like that you\u2019re so childish. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026. What do you mean?\u201dShe seemed confused whether I complimented or insulted her.It was so much fun teasing a beautiful noble young lady.\u2018Huh, how am I supposed to react to this? Is this for real? This can\u2019t be happening\u2019The look on her face as she was trying to make sense of the situation, but just couldn\u2019t come to terms with it was really funny.I giggled to myself as I went back to the dorm.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Monday\u2019s common classes. There were a lot of things going on, on Monday.First.\u201cReinhardt.\u201dThe second-year senior whom I caused a lot of trouble for came to the classroom. He didn\u2019t come alone. He arrived with the other seniors he was with last time. Four people, with the exception of Adriana, the calm senior, appeared.That little brat from last time stared at me as if she was going to eat me. It was also true that the atmosphere in the classroom suddenly froze over with the appearance of the seniors.He suddenly threw something at me before I could say anything.-FlopIt fell on my desk, not my face or anywhere else.A glove.I knew what this was.\u201cYou have seriously defamed me, Art de Gartis, the heir to the Gartis family.\u201dHe didn\u2019t look as excited as he did before.\u201cTherefore, I challenge you to a duel to restore my damaged honor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026A duel?\u201d\u201cYes, a duel.\u201dWhat kind of horse shit was this?\u201cChoose a time and place. There, observers will overlook our duel.\u201dEveryone reacted with disbelief when he applied for a duel against his own junior.\u201cSo, let me get this straight. You\u2019re applying for a duel, because your junior, whom you tried to beat up, grabbed you down there making you scream, leading to you feeling embarrassed?\u201dAt those words, everyone who witnessed this scene tried to hold back their laughter. The seniors looked around and told everyone not to laugh, but I could see the corners of their mouths\u2019 trembling.It was funny, regardless on which side one stood.\u201cThat was foul! Bad! Pervert!\u201dLittle Redina only pointed at me and shouted.\u201cYou look like a mess.\u00a0 You have to use everything you can, you know? Should I\u2019ve just quietly gotten beat up? Is that it? If I can break your head, I\u2019ll break your head and if I can grab onto something, I sure as hell will grab it. Is that wrong? Should the weak only get beat up? Huh?\u201d\u201cHow longwinded. If you intend to refuse the duel and embrace that dishonor, then do it. That would mean that you\u2019re a just a man of such caliber. That\u2019s all. Admit that you would only be able to win a fight through dirty methods.\u201dArt de Gartis seemed unmoved by my words. I knew, because he beat me up the other day. If I fought that guy, I\u2019d definitely get crushed. No, not only crushed, I would probably get seriously injured.A duel.I did include some duel scenes. Duels within the Temple can take place on the premise that the students do not use real swords.One might get hurt badly.However, one won\u2019t die.\u201cYes, I accept.\u201dMaybe because they didn\u2019t expect me to accept it, not only the person who applied for the duel, but also the other seniors and my classmates seemed to be astonished.\u201cKeep in mind, I won\u2019t fall for the same dirty trick as last time.\u201dI required extreme psychological pressure.That was the reason why I accepted it even though I knew it would be too much for me.I didn\u2019t know if that duel would do it for me, but I had to try.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41It was only natural that the atmosphere in the classroom became strange after the seniors left.\u201cHey, you. Could I talk to you for a second?\u201d\u201cWhat is there to talk about?\u201dEven though everyone went back, the little senior, Redina, stayed behind and called out to me.She wasn\u2019t aggressive in the least when she asked to talk with me. She actually looked very scared even though she had been sending me death glares to up until now.She took me out and dragged me to the stair landing so that no one could hear us.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, crazy?\u201d\u201cArt is Second Aear Class A\u2019s Number 3. Don\u2019t you know what that means? Do you want to die?\u201dThey naturally thought I\u2019d just embrace the disgrace and refuse the duel. I only won by taking advantage of his weak spot last time, so that guy knew I wasn\u2019t good at fighting.\u201cHe won\u2019t kill me.\u201d\u201cYou said you don\u2019t have any skill or talent. So what makes you so confident? Are you an idiot?\u201dAdriana told me yesterday that this little brat was actually forced to do this and that she was a really weak-hearted girl.She actually looked pretty fidgety now. She was excited at the thought of throwing insults at me if I were to refuse the duel, but when I chose the other option, which was crazy, she was rather frightened.\u201cDuels aren\u2019t a joke. There were kids who got really badly injured in them. Go to Art quickly, apologize and beg him for forgiveness. Things are just getting too weird, you idiot! Art would have let you go if you sincerely apologized!\u201dShe also told me how embarrassed he was.Knowing that I wasn\u2019t good at fighting, he applied for a duel and tried to get an apology out of me if I didn\u2019t agree to it.After Adriana told me that she was a good kid yesterday, I was wondering what kind of person she actually was, but she really seemed like a nice girl.\u201cWhat is life?\u201dI shrugged.\u201cIf I get beaten to death, than that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen, I guess.\u201dRedina seemed totally dumbfounded by my nonchalant response.The duel was decided to take place two weeks later in the First Year Class A\u2019s dormitory.During that week, what kind of miraculous talent could I get that would help me win against a second year student of the Royal Class in a duel?I just hope that this was psychologically pressuring enough.I really hoped that I didn\u2019t have to prepare a situation similar to when I was escaping from the Demon King\u2019s Castle and almost died. I hoped with all my heart that this would be enough.It was true that I was scared because I was sure to get beaten up badly, but I couldn\u2019t keep doing this with my ability locked.[Event Quest: Duel with Art de Gartis][Description : Art asked for a duel for defaming him. The probability of you winning is very low.][Goal : Go through with the duel.][Completion Reward : 600 Points][Consolation Reward : 200 Points]An event quest appeared as if it was natural.And in this case, even losing would pay off.I would be rewarded just for having the duel. The probability of me winning this duel was so low, there probably was a way to avoid it. So even if I wouldn\u2019t be able to make my talent awaken through this psychologically pressuring situation, I would get rewarded.Why was it giving me pity prizes now?Even though I did this to myself, I still felt a bit depressed.* * *Duels were allowed within Temple, but a teacher must watch over them. Otherwise, they might actually kill someone in that duel.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was staring at me silently. Since Mr. Epinhauser had previously stated that he would be the observer if a duel were to ever occur, so I reported this matter to him.\u201cIf the duel has been agreed upon by both parties there is no problem. Write down the location, date and time.\u201dThe teacher didn\u2019t ask me if I was crazy. He was a good and interesting guy in that he worried rarely or wouldn\u2019t meddle unnecessarily.A-11 Reinhardt would duel with a sophomore.Naturally, that rumor was coursing through Class A and then spread to Class B. To be precise it was during the P.E. lesson which was joint.\u201cReinhardt? What the hell happened? A duel? With a second grader?\u201dLudwig asked me after the short break between running exercises and strength training.I guess he became worried because he heard about this all of a sudden.\u201cThis and that happened. I\u2019m too lazy to explain all that.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if we could end this all with an apology? Won\u2019t you get seriously hurt?\u201dLudwig was stubborn and insisted on what If I were to get hurt, and how it would be better if I just ended this all with an apology. Although the classes were divided into A and B, maybe because we were still in the same grade, the Class B kids were also looking at me worriedly.And the kids who seemed to have heard the details were shocked.But for some reason, Charlotte was just staring at me. Her gaze somehow felt different from the other children.I was definitely not mistaken about that.Shortly after PE, Charlotte called out to me from behind as I was exhaustedly walking towards the changing room.\u201cYou said you were Reinhardt, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah, so.\u201dCharlotte walked over to me slowly and put something into my hand.\u201cCheck it.\u201dAfter leaving those cold commanding words behind, Charlotte walked her way towards her classroom.[Stay in the classroom after class]There was only one sentence written on the slip of paper.What?I was told by Bertus to keep an eye on Charlotte, but it seemed like Charlotte also had some business with me.* * *The common classes ended with the P.E. class. Mr. Epinhauser gave a closing speech, and then the students all exited the classroom.After our life-threatening escape and coming to Temple, Charlotte and I had never spoken with each other.Did she notice who I was? If that was the case, I had to immediately leave Temple.No. If she actually did, how did she know? After all the students left, I was the only one left in the classroom.-KatchakThen, the door opened and Charlotte entered Class A\u2019s classroom. This personality and the personality she showed me in that critical situation were bound to be different. Her being completely aware that her life was in danger, and Charlotte crying while hugging the body of her presumed mother in that dark prison cell.This Charlotte de Gardias, who gave off a cold impression, was like a completely different person. Was this Charlotte\u2019s original personality?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dCharlotte approached me while looking at me, then she sat obliquely in front of the desk next to me.\u201cI usually don\u2019t want to converse with people like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201dWhat was she doing all of a sudden?\u201cI heard you were all over the place? You like to stand out, you have a bad temper and even got asked to duel by a senior today\u2026.\u201dCharlotte had a very bad impression of me, probably because she heard the rumors about me. There certainly wasn\u2019t anything good about my actions, so it couldn\u2019t be helped if Charlotte viewed me in a negative light.Still, I felt a bit heart broken.\u201cIs it because you are from a humble background that you treat people more strongly, so you won\u2019t be ignored?\u201dCharlotte\u2019s blunt words somewhat hit the nail on the head. I didn\u2019t want to seem like a pushover so I acted like a dog. As she continued to talk, it didn\u2019t seem that she noticed who I was.So what is that she wanted?\u201cI heard you\u2019re a beggar. I did some research.\u201dResearch?If I\u2019m a beggar, then I\u2019m just a beggar. Why did she do research? It must have been on Saturday that this rumor reached her ears, but she had been researching me?\u201cI know who you are.\u201dShe did?\u201cWhere you\u2019re from, what kind of members your gang has, and what kind of organization stands behind them.\u201dI had goosebumps all over my body.Charlotte didn\u2019t seem like she knew I was a demon, but she found out about something else.She knew about the Rotary Gang and that it was supported by the Thieves\u2019 Guild.\u201cKeep in mind that it is uncommon for me to deal with pests like you.\u201dShe was saying that she didn\u2019t only dislike me because of the kind of person I was.She didn\u2019t like me because she thought I was associated with a criminal organisation.Although Bertus\u2019 power was enormous, it seemed clear that Charlotte, who returned to the Emperor\u2019s side, could also wield formidable forces. How else could she find out all these facts in that short amount of time?She found out about the Rotary Gang just by finding out where I came from. and even gathered clues about the Thieves\u2019 Guild who supported them.They were tightly entangled after all.\u201cWa, wait\u2026. I\u2026. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026. I don\u2019t know\u2026. What is this about?\u201d\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m naive enough to believe that excuse that they sent you here simply to get educated at Temple?\u201dCharlotte leaned against the desk in exasperation, then came up to me and looked down at me with sad eyes.She started looking at me deeply.\u201cStop acting like that. If you keep pretending you don\u2019t know, I\u2019m going to mobilize the city guards right this instant to clean up those dirty sewers.\u201dThere was no point in denying my link to them.Like Bertus, Charlotte wasn\u2019t someone I could control. This was even more serious than that time with Bertus though. Bertus didn\u2019t seem to have made a background check on me, but Charlotte could even connect me and Loyar at this moment.Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have dealt with someone like me.But right now it wasn\u2019t a normal situation.In the end, Charlotte said that she had some business with me. Denial would only put the Rotary Gang at risk.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dAdmitting it in the end, I waited for her answer. Charlotte took something out of her arms.A portrait was on the paper Charlotte gave me.\u201cThis kid.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOf course, I knew who that was.It was me, who tried to use camouflage magic to hide my horns.\u201cFind this kid. If he\u2019s alive, tell me where he is. If he died, tell me where and why he died. And also who killed him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou must find him.\u201dShe stared at me coldly as if she would destroy everything before her if I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201cWait, what should I do if I can\u2019t\u2026. Are you asking me to find a kid whose name even you don\u2019t know? Rather, isn\u2019t your side more\u2026\u2026.\u201dCharlotte frowned when I said something like \u201cWhat can I even do? I just belong to a Beggars\u2019 Organization.\u201d and \u201cThere must be a lot of other people available\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know that. It\u2019s important that you have to find his whereabouts faster than Bertus.\u201dI killed the Knights of Duke Salerian. I didn\u2019t know what happened to Dyrus, but it was clear that both me and Dyrus were targeted by Duke Salerian..Just as Charlotte was looking for me, Bertus was as well.Charlotte seemed to be looking for me with all the manpower she could mobilize. That was why she was trying to even mobilize this kind of organisation, she usually wouldn\u2019t even spare a single look.\u201cI\u2026. Could end up handing him over to Bertus though?\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201dTo begin with, I was in Class A which meant a lot closer to Bertus. However, Charlotte\u2019s eyes then lit up in cold anger.\u201cHowever, if that were to happen, I will surely kill you with my own hands as well as that organization of yours.\u201dDamn it.I never thought Charlotte would be looking for me so desperately, because the man she wanted me to find was right in front of her. I just wanted her to forget about me, but it seemed like she couldn\u2019t.She thought that I\u2019d get killed if Bertus found me first.\u201cHey, that kid\u2026. Why is he so important?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know. You have someone to find, so that\u2019s all you have to do.\u201dCharlotte didn\u2019t seem to want to provide an explanation for me. She just pressed the portrait against my chest.\u201cReport to me regularly about the status of the investigation. It\u2019s not like your grades in Temple are your top priority. Right?\u201dMy life and the lives of the gang members relied on this.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42A boy who saved her but then suddenly disappeared.Charlotte seemed to think that he became a beggar. That was why she asked me who also was a beggar to find the boy, because a beggar would know a beggar best.A student from a beggar organization that entered Temple. To Charlotte, I seemed to be the best option to look for that boy for her.But while Charlotte seemed rational, she wasn\u2019t. The emotions that flashed in her eyes when she told me to find him showed that Charlotte wasn\u2019t calm at all.She looked like she was about to lose her reason. Charlotte, who threatened me and insisted on me finding myself somehow, seemed unable to control her emotions.Charlotte carried out a meticulous background check on me in mere days, however she seemed unable to think rationally.I thought she\u2019d obviously think I was suspicious while listening to Dyrus recount, but she didn\u2019t seem like that at all right at that moment. She only felt desperate to find someone who was very dear to her.In some cases, there were people who never doubted anyone.Charlotte didn\u2019t seem to think that I was suspicious at all. Maybe she thought that I simply ran away or was kidnapped and killed.That was what I believed went through her mind.If she had even the slightest inkling that I was a demon in disguise, Charlotte should have doubted me.If she checked my origin as a beggar, the date my ID was issued, and interrogated the beggars personally, Charlotte would have noticed that I just appeared out of nowhere one day.However, Charlotte was so obsessed with finding Valier, that she just wanted to use me as a tool to find him for her, but didn\u2019t go around asking about me herself.I felt a little good, but on the other hand I didn\u2019t. I was now in a position where I had to deceive this kid who was looking for me so desperately.I had been given this bizarre order of finding and bringing myself to Charlotte. Appearing in front of her with the appearance of Valier would solve everything, but she wouldn\u2019t let me go. She\u2019d somehow try to keep me by her side.What should I do?One of my assistants, Sarkegaar, was the one who kidnapped the Imperial Princess. It would be absurd to reveal my true identity to her and standing in front of her in the form of Valier would be very dangerous.This was never a matter I could simply decide on my own.I had to discuss this matter with Loyar, Eleris and Sarkegaar.Anyway, I was now completely trapped between Bertus and Charlotte.Depending on my actions, it would be decided if the decision to come to Temple was the worst possible one we could have made.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The one closest to my body was Bertus, and the one closest to my heart was Charlotte.To be honest, I felt very sorry. I wasn\u2019t in a situation where I could just show up in front of her who was so desperately looking for me, and I actually had to help Charlotte\u2019s sworn enemy.And the gang was now on the Princess\u2019 radar. I didn\u2019t know about Bertus, but the princess would absolutely wipe out the Rotary Gang if I were to pull some crap. She\u2019d probably bring up my connection to the Thieves\u2019 Guild to the teachers and might even get me kicked out of Temple.It was useless feigning ignorance as well. Charlotte had everything figured out already.She didn\u2019t know the most important details, but she did know all the facts that would be bothersome to me.I couldn\u2019t tell Bertus what Charlotte instructed me to do. Just telling him would leave me with a servered head. If he asked me later, what I talked about with Charlotte, what should I tell him?Both Bertus and Charlotte were looking for me. Bertus for retaliation and Charlotte for protection.Things had become twisted.Anyway, what happened to Dyrus? I couldn\u2019t even ask Charlotte, but I was curious. If Duke Salerian retaliated against him, he wouldn\u2019t be in this world anymore. I could only hope that Charlotte was protecting him well.Who was I worried about now?Both heirs to the Imperial Throne wanted me to do something for them. It would have been better if I only had something to do with one side, but I was vaguely intertwined with both of them. What a dog like situation.That\u2019s what it was.Charlotte\u2019s matter needed to be discussed separately. And it wasn\u2019t just that.I also had to prepare for the duel with Art later this week. It was clear that he would beat me into a bloody pulp when that time came, but after that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it so easily anymore.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *I went back to the dorm, when someone called out to me.\u201cHey, you beggar.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was Harriet de Saint-Owan. When I reacted she covered her mouth and laughed.\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t call you though? I just said a word. Are you a beggar?\u201dWas she trying to get back at me using the same method I used on her?\u201cHuh, I am, right?\u201d\u201cHu, huh?\u201dWhen I said yes, that girl\u2019s expression turned into a puzzled one as if this wasn\u2019t the reaction she was looking for. I never set her up as that kind of character, so why was she so cute?She was like a little kid that thought she was smart. She was so damn cute, I couldn\u2019t even get mad at her.\u201cI\u2019m a beggar, you\u2019re right. So what is it?\u201d\u201cHuh, uhm\u2026. Ah\u2026.\u201dWhat she expected me to say was: \u201cDon\u2019t call me a beggar!\u201d, however what she got was a: \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d. So, when I asked her what she wanted she seemed flustered, as she probably didn\u2019t have anything to say to me.\u201cI heard. That. I heard, you\u2019re going to have a duel?\u201dWhy was she pretending to have heard it from somewhere when she was right there when it happened? No matter how one looked at it, this was just a question she came up with on the spot.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThat senior is a very scary person. You\u2019re going to be beaten up pretty badly, you know?\u201d\u201cWhere you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I wonder if he\u2019ll kill me.\u201dShe seemed taken aback by my nonchalant response.\u201c\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t you scared?\u201d\u201cAm I scared? To the point where I\u2019m about to pee myself.\u201dShe seemed even more confused when I casually told her that I was, in fact, scared. She knew I was a troublemaker, but it seemed like my evaluation was being revised as a completely incomprehensible person.\u201cThen why did you accept the challenge if you\u2019re scared?\u201d\u201cI know, right? Maybe I\u2019ll just happen to turn it around somehow.\u201dI didn\u2019t say anything like: \u201cI\u2019m trying to awaken my supernatural abilities by putting myself into extremely psychologically pressuring situations\u201d.Harriet stared at me as if I was crazy. Eventually, she shook her head.She even had a wicked smile on her lips.\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have to watch if you really get beat up.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmpf!\u201dI headed to the gymAnd it seemed like our conversation was surprisingly calm just now.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *My physical abilities weren\u2019t that far behind my classmates, they weren\u2019t comparable to those with combat talents, obviously.Of course, people like Erich Lafaeri who had a combat talent but didn\u2019t put in any effort was out of that equation.The Class A dormitory\u2019s gym, there were two students holding training swords and beating scarecrows alone or practicing their posture.A-2, Ellen Artorius and A-5 Cliffman, only those two. Those two practiced every day according to their own routine. They didn\u2019t go out to play on the weekends and just practiced all day long.However, the two of them were training separately while still being in the same space and there was a 100% chance that they haven\u2019t even held a single conversation with each other up until now.For now I just picked up a training sword.But how was I supposed to practice swordsmanship? They were just swinging around their sword by themselves.I usually described it as \u201cThey did swordsmanship training\u201d in my novel without going into detail. Leveling up was roughly the same, I\u2019d just say they ranked up or leveled up. Or it would just be as blunt as saying, they\u2019ve gotten better at this or that.I asked neither of them to teach me, so they didn\u2019t. I just started swinging my sword.Of course, it wasn\u2019t all random. I tried recalling the swordsmanship moves I learned last week and traced it while replaying that memory in my mind. I trained techniques and swordsmanship moves while looking at the provided manual. There was just too much work to be done to condense it in just a single word.I realized that the strength of my wrist and forearm muscles had to be supported, the foot work was important as well.I couldn\u2019t believe those two were doing this on their own every day.The two silently wielding their sword started to look incredible to me again.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cHuff\u2026. Huff\u2026.\u201dAfter dinner, Ellen continued to wield her sword, and even after Cliffman returned to the dormitory, she continued to train alone.Of course, she didn\u2019t just swing her sword, she seemed to be doing other things like going somewhere and coming back after. Eventually, after some time passed, I was the only one left training and wielding the sword.Would this even make a difference?I only did this for one day, but I already felt exhausted and tired. I had to get used to training in itself, not just because of the duel next week. I can\u2019t believe in my mad dog act forever.That\u2019s what I realized.The third graders didn\u2019t come even after it grew dark. In the end, as I expected, they didn\u2019t want to touch the Prince directly. And those guys forced the second graders to do such a thing for them.The third graders didn\u2019t come. However, an unexpected person entered the gym.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cJunior. I heard you were here.\u201dIt was Adriana, the second year senior with a calm demeanor.She furrowed her brows as she looked at me sprawled out with the training sword beside me, sweating profusely.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Redina requested me to come.\u201d\u201cThat kid?\u201dWhat did she ask her that for?\u201cYes, Art seems to be looking forward to this a lot, so he might beat you half to death. She tried to stop him.\u201dShe was such a good girl, to the point that I felt really sorry for being so harsh to her. Adriana sighed when she saw how exhausted I was.\u201cBut looking at you now, it seems that you\u2019re trying to do something at least.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. More or less.\u201d\u201cJust because you do this for around 2 weeks doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be able to beat Art. You know that much, right?\u201dAdriana didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was doing.\u2018Why the hell are you accepting a duel that you\u2019re obviously going to lose and wield your sword in the training hall until the point of nearly killing yourself? There\u2019s no chance of winning.\u2019That\u2019s what she was trying to tell me.\u201cI have to do something.\u201d\u201cYou will lose. Miserably at that.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just apologize now, before you have to suffer through greater humiliation. You certainly realize that you\u2019re going a bit too far. Art isn\u2019t as bad a kid as you think.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad guy.\u201dI could fully understand why he threw the glove after being subjected to something like that. He was humiliated by his junior. Adriana slightly bit her lip.\u201cYou know you will lose and you also don\u2019t think that Art is a bad person, so why do you want to go on with this duel and not apologize?\u201d\u201cJust because.\u201dI got up again with my training sword and started practicing my posture.\u201cI, have to get hit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dIt\u2019s not that I want to get hit, just to get hit.-Whoosh! Swish!I had to get hit to overcome this difficult situation. Adriana stared at me for a long time, then sighed.\u201cJunior.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAdriana slowly approached me as if she wanted to stop me and took the sword from my hand.Then she lightly performed the moves I had been trying to do up until now. Looking in the mirror, it was not comparable to the clumsy moves I displayed. They were nearly perfect moves, like a sword dance.\u201c\u2026Why are you showing me things I can\u2019t even imitate\u2026.\u201dAdriana sighed as if she herself couldn\u2019t understand what she was doing and returned the training sword to me.\u201cTry.\u201dI then tried to demonstrate the exact same movements Adriana just showed me using the scarecrow.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWe both looked at each other silently. She approached me, grabbed my arm and shook it around. It was definitely limp because I felt rather exhausted at the moment.\u201cIt won\u2019t do you any good if you try to do this while you\u2019re all out of energy. You\u2019ll just hurt your wrist.\u201dAdriana looked at me with pity, and then suddenly closed her eyes. A bunch of white lights appeared from her hands and began to tickle my body.\u201cThi, this is\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, you don\u2019t know.\u201dThen Adriana opened her eyes again.\u201cI want to be a Paladin.\u201dShe seemed to have talents in both divine power and swordsmanship. Second year, A-2, Adriana. If she was Class A\u2019s number 2, I was assuming that she had even more talents.She certainly was incredible, as she was able to use divine spells at her age.She restored my vitality with a divine spell just now. All my muscle aches and fatigue certainly had been completely relieved.\u201cNow, try again.\u201d\u201cYes, thanks.\u201dMy strength should have been restored. While carrying gratitude in my heart, I tried to trace Adriana\u2019s movements again.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNothing had changed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Your basic fitness level is too low. Junior, you should do physical training, not holding a sword.\u2019Adriana let out a deep sigh when she said that.\u2018Why do I even care about this kid?\u2019\u2018Wake up 2 hours earlier than the standard wake-up time and wait in the main lobby.\u201dWhether she was concerned or just plain annoyed, Adriana didn\u2019t seem like she could leave me alone.Anyway, I did feel grateful for her help.I wondered why she was helping a rowdy junior who was about to duel with her classmate.The next day.I was in the lobby at 6 o\u2019clock, well before the standard wake-up time, wearing a track suit. As it was 6 o\u2019clock it was still dark out, but there were still some people here.This was because the students who wanted to train their physical strength in the morning gradually came out.Ludwig and Ellen were also there.\u201cReinhardt? What\u2019s going on? So you want to exercise?\u201d\u201cYeah, well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good! So you want to do it together then?\u201dIt was good that he was so energetic, but I didn\u2019t think I could keep up with him.\u201cNo, I think my heart would burst if I were to try to follow you.\u201d\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m pretty sure it is. Go alone.\u201dRunning beside him would mean committing suicide. Even Ellen couldn\u2019t keep up with that. That\u2019s what it meant to have A+ Rank stamina.\u201cEllen! Do you want to run with me today?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dEllen answered curtly and went out of the dormitory lobby. Ludwig looked at Ellen who gave him the cold shoulder like always and smiled at me.\u201cDoes Ellen hate me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dShe just doesn\u2019t care about any of us.After sending him off for his morning workout, Adriana, with her shoulder-length bob tied in a ponytail, came down from the second floor, after a while.This senior of mine was very calm and had a modern style beauty to her. She looked like a modern high school girl.I bowed my head slightly and Adriana nodded her head towards me to answer my greeting. Adriana was probably the most polite person I had dealt with up until now.\u201cWouldn\u2019t this make you look bad in front of your classmates?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHelping me with physical training.\u201d\u201cWell, you need to be a little more physically fit if you want to have a duel\u2026 Ung.\u201dShe started warming up by stretching.\u201cThat way, rumors about Art bullying a weak freshmen kid because of his own stubbornness won\u2019t circulate.\u201dSo, to protect Art\u2019s honor was enough justification to help me out. That was what she meant. Anyway, I was pretty sure I would lose, but I was grateful anyway.She seemed to be good at swordsmanship and aimed to become a paladin, and seeing her waking up at this time, she really was sincere and calm.What the hell. Was she the perfect human being? Was she really a high schooler? It made me feel even shabbier for swearing at younger kids.\u201cLet\u2019s go, junior.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAdriana ran ahead and I followed behind her.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cThis is serious.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026. Huff\u2026.\u201dI ran to the point that I had a sweet taste in my mouth, but Adriana wasn\u2019t tired at all.She restored my strength by injecting divine power into me. My wildly beating heart gradually calmed down and my breathing stabilized.What\u2019s this?I felt like I was running while taking a doping potion. My mind was exhausted but my body felt fine. This was a really strange feeling.\u201cRun faster. I\u2019m also training myself, so it\u2019s hard for me to also look after you, junior.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201dMy body and mind were driven to the extreme, but due to Adriana\u2019s divine power, my body would always be restored to its original state. Rather, this almost drove me mad. My mind was worn out, but my body continued to be active.This was the first time in my life that I ever felt that way. I could continue to run, but my mind was in an even more extreme state.\u201cI, I feel really strange!\u201d\u201cI mean, technically this is against the rules, but it would actually be stranger to not feel strange you know?\u201dI shouted while running and Adriana answered me. Normally, I shouldn\u2019t be able to run anymore, but I kept running, so it was natural for me to feel strange.\u201cHuff\u2026. Huff\u2026. If Paladin candidates were to, huff, run a marathon\u2026 Huff\u2026 I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll all win\u2026 Huff\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf this method was actually allowed, then yes! And you\u2019ll run out of breath if you keep talking while running.\u201dAdriana ran easily, even finding the time to rebuke me. There were quite a few people in Temple who trained themselves in the morning.\u201cThe first year junior called Ludwig . He was the one sprinting around Temple, right?\u201d\u201cTha, that\u2019s\u2026. How he was originally\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, junior. He can do it, because he worked hard. Don\u2019t just work hard today, keep doing this in the future. The Orbis Class kids do this every morning as a group. Our Royal Class\u2019 lazy kids could learn a thing or two from them.\u201dAdriana was talking about one of Temple\u2019s two pillars, the Orbis Class. It seemed like they would get up early in the morning and train together as a group. Regardless of major.Were they part of the army?\u201cHey, you told me not to talk\u2026. Huff\u2026 Why do you keep talking to me\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes. Sorry.\u201dI ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran, ran and ran. I almost lost my mind every time she healed me. It wasn\u2019t just running I had to do. Adriana headed to the gym and let me do strength training.At that moment, I could truly feel how demonic her divine power was. When my muscles started to ache, she would heal them with her divine power, then send me to do more training and when the pain grew worse again, she\u2019d heal me.However, if she went on like that my muscle growth would be no joke. What would one call these kinds of steroids? Divine steroids?\u201cI\u2019m doing this because you just lack too much strength. You should do some strength training on your own, but don\u2019t overdo it or you could ruin your body.\u201dAdriana told me that I should think about carefully growing my strength and kept on checking on me even though she had her own training to do.\u201cIf you exercise while forcibly recovering using divine powers, there\u2019s one thing you have to do no matter what.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEat a lot.\u201dI was more or less forced to maintain my physical abilities even after I completely exhausted my energy. That was why Adriana advised me to eat a lot more and more often than usual because I would suffer serious nutritional losses. Especial protein.\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m confident of doing today\u2026.\u201d\u201cHah, I suppose so.\u201dAdriana smirked as if I said something funny.I had never seen her smile before.* * *Even while completing her strength training she poured divine power into me and went back to it. She didn\u2019t use it on herself. Somehow, this seriously felt like I had a heal-pack stuck next to me, when she started her work out.If she were to travel to modern times, I was sure she would have great success as a personal trainer. People who would sell their souls for muscle growth would absolutely love her.Though my body was fine, my mind was completely exhausted when I returned to the dormitory. I took a shower, changed my clothes and headed straight to the dining room. It wasn\u2019t meal time yet, but I was so hungry that the world felt like it was spinning around me.No, I didn\u2019t think I really had that big of an appetite because the workout was just too intense, but I felt this strong compulsion to eat something, a feeling much stronger than just feeling hungry.When it was time, the chefs would bring the food they prepared into the hall, but that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a kitchen here. It didn\u2019t only include simple meals, but also late-night snacks that could be eaten at any time one wanted, as well as a kitchen equipped with all kinds of ingredients.One could call upon the chefs to prepare some food for you, and sometimes the students even cooked themselves.But how many of them would even be able to make their own meal? They had to try and maybe grill an egg.And there was this setup I didn\u2019t know about.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen, who had already finished with her physical training, was carrying a bunch of beef jerky.She went out every morning to exercise, so she wanted to have something to eat before having breakfast. That\u2019s understandable.But I remembered that she also ate a lot more at breakfast than others. What kind of metabolism did she have?When I looked into the storage that held the snacks, I saw that it was empty. When I turned around, I saw Ellen eating the beef jerky little by little.\u201cIs that all there is?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWas there only beef jerky in there?\u201d\u201cNo. Originally, there was bread and some other things.\u201dOriginally, they had prepared a lot of things, but it seemed like they didn\u2019t replenish it often as there weren\u2019t many people who ate those snacks. So it seemed like after eating this and that every morning, the only thing left was beef jerky.\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dEllen shook her head. It seemed like she ate it only because it was available, not because she liked it particularly.No, how hungry was she?I didn\u2019t want to steal her food, so I ended up going into the kitchen. Fortunately, there were quite a few ingredients in the storage, so I didn\u2019t have to eat raw meat as is.I had no intentions of making anything amazing. I was about to die from mental exhaustion after all.I just took some eggs and bacon and fried them in a frying pan. The fragrant smell of bacon spread throughout the kitchen. Then I just threw some asparagus in there to fry. Since I was told to eat a lot, I used a lot of bacon and five eggs.I also wanted to eat some carbs, but I didn\u2019t feel like cooking noodles or rice. That was just too much work.After I was done, I placed the mountain of eggs and bacon, accompanied by asparagus on a large plate and brought it to a table in the dining room.Ellen was still chewing on her beef jerky. However, she could apparently not help herself twitching her nose when she saw me coming.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t eat that shabby food. Eat this instead.\u201dI had a bad temper, but I wasn\u2019t a heartless person, you know?When I handed her the fork, Ellen accepted it and sat across from me. I sighed when I saw Ellen eat some of the fried eggs.\u201cHey, the storage is full of meat and eggs, why don\u2019t you fry some instead of eating that tasteless stuff? Is it that hard?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never done that.\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you done this before though? Isn\u2019t that essential?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen stared at me smirking suddenly. I didn\u2019t know why, but she looked somewhat sullen, like : \u201cWhy are you talking to me? Are we in the same situation?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to, you should learn it. Kids these days\u2026. Anyway, eat up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhat am I doing when one doesn\u2019t even touch a dog when it eats? I was going to eat too.-Nom, nom, nomNo, why was she eating so fast?\u201cHey, don\u2019t cross the line. Eat at a human pace. Huh?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like words would get through to her, so I picked up my fork as well. But that punk ate half of it already, even though it was me who made it.\u201cAre you kidding me? You eat more than a beggar who hasn\u2019t eaten for days.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m hungry.\u201dAfter she said that, Ellen curiously avoided my gaze.She ate more than half of what I made in a single bite? This had crossed the line, honestly.\u201cYou know that you have classes with me today, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dToday was Tuesday, I was taking the two consecutive swordsmanship lessons with Ellen. To my words, she nodded. She was quite insensitive, although she wasn\u2019t stupid.\u201cBe prepared for lunch then.\u201d\u201c?\u201dWe were going for 2 rounds of cheonggukjang.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44It was a bit much to expect dramatic changes after just one day.Nevertheless.Current stats: [ Strength 4 (F+) ]\u00a0 [ Agility 4 (F+) ]\u00a0 [ Dexterity 5.2 (D-) ]\u00a0 [Magic 10 (C) ] [ Stamina 6.5 (D) ]My Strength increased by 0.5, Agility by 0.3 and Stamina by 0.6. I didn\u2019t exactly know why but I also confirmed that Magic also increased by 0.1.Of course, as I explained before, the lower the level the quicker one could see developments. Obviously, this might also be the effect of going through Temple\u2019s curriculum in addition to that one day of training, but it was clear to see that the effects of that training while being influenced by divine power were enormous.However, Adriana seemed to think that this wasn\u2019t a very good method, so there had to be a reason why it wasn\u2019t.In addition, the fatigue this caused was actually just as enormous as its effects, as it felt like my body and mind acted separately.Honestly, I wasn\u2019t quite sure if I would continue with swordsmanship in the future, but right now I could only learn things that were related to the body.I tackled the swordsmanship theory and practical training with a different mindset from last week. There were no major improvements.Ellen was an honor student and I was more on the inferior side of things even though I was also part of the Royal Class. I didn\u2019t care about the general class\u2019 people\u2019s looks. If I cared about something like that, I wouldn\u2019t be doing this.In the first place, there were a lot of talents found in the Royal Class! I wasn\u2019t the weird one here! This had nothing to do with hard work! That\u2019s what I wanted to plead, but I couldn\u2019t do that, because they weren\u2019t looking at me anymore.Of course, there were some guys who seemed to gossip about me because even though Ellen and I were both in the Royal Class, we were completely different.However, there were just too many things I had to worry about to even graciously give them True Education. To be honest, I didn\u2019t even know those guys\u2019 names.I had to be strong-minded. There would always be people wanting to pick a fight with me, and those who would want to repay the humiliation they suffered after they realized that I was just a weakass or after their skills had improved.The duel in two weeks was only one incident. I had to continue my physical training. From swordsmanship to martial arts. I couldn\u2019t learn magic properly here to begin with, my supernatural power hadn\u2019t awakened yet, and I didn\u2019t have a talent for divine power yet, so I had to start from a completely bare ground.The only thing I could believe in at this point was my body that would grow as I trained.I couldn\u2019t end up as just a bad tempered guy. I had to have real power and I had to get out of Bertus\u2019 and Charlotte\u2019s hands eventually.I didn\u2019t have any time to waste.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not as strange as last time.\u201dRegardless of how it went last time, Ellen challenged the cheonggukjang again and ate it unexpectedly calmly.As this was her second time eating it, she got used to it, didn\u2019t she?\u201c\u2026That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s delicious.\u201dAs if she tried to avoid any misunderstandings, Ellen added that.But if she didn\u2019t like to eat this, why did she follow me here? Was it because I was buying?Did I set her up to like free meals?Still, she ate more than last time, and even burped.She was quite the legend after all.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you more of a beggar than me for always eating the food I buy?\u201dWhen I took a stab at her after we left the store, Ellen just looked at me. Rather than staring at me, it felt more like she was lost in thought.\u201cThen I\u2019ll pay next time.\u201dWhat\u2019s this?She just smoothly answered with a promise to eat together again next time.Did she maybe think I was actually a pretty good guy?Ellen, of course, left without saying goodbye this time.Such an ungrateful kid.* * *Since I didn\u2019t have a specific skill yet I didn\u2019t have much to learn in class.I dropped the magic classes with the permission of Mr. Epinhauser, and horseback riding was added in its stead. I thought that I might end up having to ride a horse one day.I was so scared, I almost peed myself. I was supposed to ride on some wild beast and entrust my life to it? Were they crazy? I should have made the setting that mana cars or something existed.I also realized once again that the horse riding skills of Dyrus, who let me ride with him when we escaped the Demon King\u2019s Castle, were top class.I had already exhausted all my mental strength in the morning training, but I couldn\u2019t take a break. After class, I reviewed what I had learned today until evening at the gym, as well as some physical training.When I was completely exhausted and couldn\u2019t move anymore, I kind of missed Adriana\u2019s divine power.I wondered if she would also come in the evening, but she didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Honestly though, my conscience wouldn\u2019t allow me, making her help me out more than she already did.However I didn\u2019t forget what Adriana told me, I had a big dinner, and after a short digestive break, I went for a run, followed by some strength training.I thought I was overdoing it, and this would have originally been enough to hurt my body. However, thinking that Adriana would somehow be able to handle this, I kept on pushing myself harder.\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201dThe sweat on my hands made the training sword slip out of my hand.Did I really have to do it like this? I was far from a person who enjoyed exercising after all. I didn\u2019t really have the willpower to do something like that, and I just kept on writing stories in the corner of my room. I neither liked nor had a talent for putting that kind of effort in things.I had that thought a dozen more times when I felt out of breath and my fingers trembled in exhaustion.I was bound to lose that duel anyway. This was something I should worry about in the future.So I should just take it easy.Even if I do my best, I wouldn\u2019t be able to beat a guy who was a year older than me with just two weeks of training.Whenever such complacent thoughts entered my mind, I forced myself to hold my sword tightly.I was sure that I would lose that duel in two weeks. However, I shouldn\u2019t be complacent just because I knew I would lose.I wasn\u2019t doing this shit to beat a senior one year older than me.\u201cHup!\u201d-Pok! Pok! Pok!Because of my carelessly scribbled developments, gates would soon open, leading many people to die. I might die as well.I did this so I wouldn\u2019t die later.I might work myself to death now and it\u2019s still far in the future, but I\u2019d regret it later if I didn\u2019t do something now.I felt regret enough over the development of this novel. I didn\u2019t deserve to be complacent or lazy.Right now I was just some nasty bastard.I might even look like dirty, cruel bastard to some.\u201cHup!\u201d-Pock!There weren\u2019t any manwha-like developments like that scarecrow getting smashed to pieces by my swings.\u201cHah!\u201d-Pock!However, I added countless scratches to it.* * *In some dating simulations, there would be sequences in which you could decide where you would like to spend your free time. If the setting was a school then there were places like the music room, the gym, the science room, the rooftop etc.In the case of such games, one would find a specific character in each location. Girls who liked to play instruments would be in the music room, ones who liked working out were in the gym and those who were really smart were in the science room.So.\u201c.\u2026Those are passable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI felt like I knew all the locations one could encounter Ellen Artorius.She was sitting alone in the dining room eating sausages.She would be in the lobby early in the morning, before she started her training. After that she would go to the dining room, then go to the gym after school was over.And she would be at the dining room again, late at night.I came here to supplement my diet in advance, because I would feel super-dead after training with Adriana tomorrow, but Ellen was already here. She probably came here to eat after training like this every day.I opened the cabinet meant for snacks and saw that it still wasn\u2019t refilled. What? Then what was she eating?\u201cAre you eating that as is?\u201dShe had a tray full of sausages, munching away on them. At my incredulous attitude, Ellen pointed to the sausages she was eating.\u201cYou can eat the sausages just like that.\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe because they were smoked. But why do you just eat cold sausages?\u201dShe ran out of snacks, so she rummaged through the food storage and found those sausages. They were already precooked, so she probably just ate them as is.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have just turned on the stove, put them in a frying pan and rolled them around in there for a bit, before eating them? Is that so difficult to do?\u201dUse some cookware, for pete\u2019s sake!I didn\u2019t put some kitchen disaster or ditz attribute on you! I mean, you were supposed to be smart!Why was this intelligent person acting like a bum?Ellen shook her head at my words.\u201cToo annoying.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how, do you?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t tried.\u201dYou were telling me that you were too lazy to find out how to use them. She had such an annoying attribute. This scene made me angry just by looking at it.\u201cGive them here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEllen looked at me quietly when I took the plate of sausages. What? Were you telling me to give them back to you? If you really were a gluttonous character, that\u2019s what you\u2019d do, huh? However, she didn\u2019t tell me to put the plate back down, she just looked at me.Either way, I took out some more sausages, put them in a frying pan and heated them enough to consume at least. Why was she eating raw food that was of even higher quality than regular sausages made with the finest ingredients?When I took the sausages from the stove, Ellen was still staring at me.I could see now why she stayed still.\u201cDid she think I would make things for her in the future as well?\u201dI felt like she knew for certain that I would fry the sausages. That was why she stayed silent.As I said, I may be an ill tempered person, but I wasn\u2019t completely cold-hearted.So even though I had that kind of temperament, I would still share this meal with this cold person.We started to eat the sausages with a fork.\u201cHow good is this, huh? The juice is practically bursting out of it, and here you were trying to eat it raw like a dog on the street.\u201dEllen continued to eat, ignoring my nagging. It didn\u2019t matter what I said, she wouldn\u2019t particularly care.\u2018I\u2019ll eat it anyway, woof.\u2019Was that it?I ate some sausages for a while, before I put down my fork.Ellen did the same.\u201cSalty.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEllen nodded at my words.Since we only had sausages, it tasted really salty with nothing added to it. Usually it would make sense to have rice as a side dish or maybe even a loaf of bread.I wanted to eat more as I only had water and sausages, but I was too tired to make more. Ellen didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to leave, I didn\u2019t either.There were still fifteen more sausages left.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI thought I was about to die because I felt so tired all over. It would be a waste to just throw these away. That said, we should make something with the leftovers, but seeing that she is only ever made me work, I felt kind of annoyed.\u201cHey. You do exactly what I tell you to do from now on.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI was done volunteering.She had to do something for her food now.* * *\u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re doing good.\u201dSeeing the onions finely chopped, I nodded my head. I didn\u2019t really know how different handling a sword was from handling a cooking knife, but Ellen was able to do exactly as I ordered.I guess it wasn\u2019t a matter of being able to handle swords well, but a matter of having high levels of dexterity.\u201cDo you really not know how to cook?\u201d\u201cNo, this is my first time.\u201dIt seemed like today was the first time that she touched a kitchen knife ever. But seeing the level of her skill, even as a chef she\u2019d do well. Of course, she was too talented in combat to actually become one.\u201cNext are the carrots, same thing.\u201d-KakakakakaWatching the carrots getting chopped up in an instant, I proceeded telling her the next step. It felt like I was controlling a virtual avatar.I could do that as well, but I couldn\u2019t at the moment.I was so exhausted that I was rather confident that I would cut my fingers if I were to take up the kitchen knife.I had no intention of doing anything too complicated. There were a lot of different cooking utensils and ingredients in the kitchen, but it was night time. It was just too annoying.They had rice, but I was too tired to actually cook it. Of course, I didn\u2019t want to make new bread out of the flour as well.So what I was going to do was stir fry vegetables along with rice in a pan with oil, then add water, put the sausages in, and boil it like porridge.\u00a0 It\u2019s visuals didn\u2019t really matter to me. So what if it was a sham version of a honey porridge, as long as it was edible. It could maybe be called a Risotto?It didn\u2019t really matter to me and Ellen , who successfully managed to finish my introductory class to cheonggukjang.To begin with, by my standards she seemed to have the taste buds of a wild dog as she was eating the sausages raw.She\u2019d eat anything as long as it was edible, or so it seemed.Ellen began to stir, adding in the vegetables and rice, including minced garlic, just as I ordered. She seemed to be the type of person who would do what they were asked to do in the right circumstances.She deserved to be called my best midnight snack cooking student.\u201cRemember it, and from now on, cook for yourself. You come here before me after all.\u201d\u201cAnnoying.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to do it, but it\u2019s not like she can keep on getting fed by others. It was interesting though that she did something she thought was annoying when someone ordered her to do it. Of course, it was probably because the sausages tasted just too salty on their own.I put in the sausages and water at the right timing, and soon they began to boil in the pan. I put in some herbs. The sausages were already salty enough, so I didn\u2019t season them separately.After the random sausage porridge was completed, we brought it back into the dining room.Ellen scooped some of it up with her ladle as if there was nothing more to care about.\u201c!\u201dThen she opened her eyes wide.Of course, it wasn\u2019t because it was particularly delicious.\u201cDid you think it wouldn\u2019t be hot, shoving it into your mouth right out of the pan like that?\u201d\u201c!!!!\u201dWhen I gave her a glass of water, she gulped it right down. She was obviously smart and she had a good physique.Was she the type that would get stupid because of her own hunger? Would she turn into an idiot faced with food?\u201cHow is it? Much better, right? Huh? Isn\u2019t it delicious?\u201dAs I looked at her who kept eating after it cooled down, she stared back at me.\u201cI made it.\u201d\u201cWhat? You just moved your arms, it was me who actually taught you how to make this.\u201d\u201cBut it was me who actually made it.\u201dWhat? Was she arguing with me right now? Was she picking a fight?I\u2019m 100% sure that she would overpower me in a 1-on-1. Should I continue this?Ellen scooped up a spoonful and blowed on it this time, then she said:\u201cWe made it together.\u201dSomehow I felt like some petty bastard, so I didn\u2019t say much after that.No, I wasn\u2019t just like a petty bastard, I actually way one.* * *When I returned to my room after having a midnight snack with Ellen, I found that someone was in my room. I thought it was an employee. Since the dormitory employees cleaned the rooms of the Royal Class students.But they would usually clean up the room in the morning when I had classes. It was a little unexpected for them to be here at night like this.I had nothing in my room that shouldn\u2019t be seen. I organized and remembered the student list and then destroyed it. The worker in maid clothes seemed roam around my room, but didn\u2019t seem to pay any close attention to me.However when I entered, the employee came over and closed the door on my behalf.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat?That was weird.The employee looked at me and spoke briefly.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Sarkegaar.\u201dI couldn\u2019t even imagine how they planned on delivering messages to me, but it seemed like they\u2019d actually just bring them to me personally!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Just like I was able to casually enter Temple, Sarkegaar would be able to do the same, even though Temple had many security measures. But coming to my room as a maid in the middle of the night\u2026.Come to think of it, Count Argon Pontheus, Sarkegaar\u2019s cover, was a man.What was Sarkegaar\u2019s actual gender? Were they a species who didn\u2019t have something like that?\u201cHow did you get into my room?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard to do.\u201dSarkegaar had the master key all maids had. Well, there should have been several ways for him to get that thing. I also had to talk to Sarkegaar because there were many events complicating my situation.\u201cIn the future, instead of you coming to see me, I will come directly to you.\u201dSarkegaar was good at transforming himself, so it would be possible for him to contact me without being caught. Perhaps because of the time and place, Sarkegaar didn\u2019t lengthen his words with useless rhetorics.\u201cFirst, about the Princess\u2019 supernatural ability.\u201d\u201cYes, did you find out?\u201dSarkegaar shook his head at my words.\u201cI\u2019m here to report what I found first, although I could directly find it out if I take on some big risks.\u201dAlthough he did not find out what her ability was, he decided that he needed to report to me what he found in the process first.\u201cFirst of all, even within the Imperial Family, the talks about the Princess\u2019 supernatural power are divided. In particular, those who belong to Prince Bertus\u2019 faction seem to be skeptical. They think the reason for the information about the Princess\u2019 supernatural ability not getting revealed is because it was fake to begin with.\u201d\u201cMeaning that even Bertus doesn\u2019t know what ability the Princess has.\u201d\u201cYes. Your Highness.\u201dThe Prince didn\u2019t know what abilities she had. That could mean that Charlotte isn\u2019t really a supernatural power user. In the end, that just increased the possibility that her taking the supernatural power classes itself was just to cover up her lie to belong to the Royal Class.\u201cThat means the Emperor is the only one who knows for certain about the Princess\u2019 abilities\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was possible that the supernatural power teacher who took Charlotte to a seperate room knew, but even then there is a chance that she actually doesn\u2019t do anything in there.Even Bertus couldn\u2019t figure it out with his authority.\u201cThen there were only two other people beside the Emperor who knew about it. The Class B homeroom teacher Mr. Mustrang and the teacher in charge of Charlotte during the supernatural power classes.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dThe authenticity of the Princess\u2019 supernatural power was highly confidential, so neither of them would go anywhere running their mouths about it. Both of them were great people who couldn\u2019t be easily touched.They were teachers at Temple. And they were a teacher in charge of the supernatural power lectures who had to control students with dangerous abilities and a Royal Class homeroom teacher. Neither of them were ordinary people.\u201cSo, what did you mean by taking big risks?\u201d\u201cIf there were people who shared the secret, I could disguise myself as one of them, however it\u2019s difficult to find out a secret that only a few select people know.\u201dMr. Mustrang and the supernatural power teacher both resided in Temple. And they both weren\u2019t people that could be led on so easily. They held important positions among the Temple teachers after all.\u201cHmm\u2026. This certainly is a strange situation. Not knowing whether her powers are real or fake\u2026.\u201dDid she lie that she had supernatural powers as to not fall behind Bertus? If so, how long could that lie even last? That being said, the Emperor approved of her using a fake supernatural power to get in.Was that why only a small number of teachers, including the first-year Class B homeroom teacher, Mr. Mustrang, were aware of the Imperial Familiy\u2019s lie, to keep them in check?What if it was actually real? Why would they hide her ability, if it was real though?I didn\u2019t really have to think much to get the reason behind that.\u201cIf she really has a supernatural ability, then it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be revealed to others easily\u2026. It had to be a very problematic ability.\u201d\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201dImperial honor or Imperial prestige.It was an ability that could probably damage either of these, so what the hell kind of ability did she have?\u201cOkay, if it\u2019s too dangerous, let\u2019s just bury this. The truth will come out one way or another.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. That is a wise decision.\u201dSarkegaar answered as such. We should forget about the Princess\u2019 ability for now.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWas there an accident?\u201dI was going to have a duel next week, but I didn\u2019t think that was something I should tell that guy. He would probably just get angry, asserting his uselessly over-the-top loyalty.\u201cIt\u2019s about the Princess again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe Princess is looking for me.\u201dSarkegaar didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was talking about for a moment.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Hearing my story, Sarkegaar\u2019s expression turned grave.It was true that this was a serious issue that couldn\u2019t even be compared to that duel. If we did one wrong move, not only I but the foundation of our activity, the Rotary Gang, could be blown to smithereens. When I told him that even Bertus started paying attention to me, Sarkegaar\u2019s expression became even more serious.\u201cTemple is a much too dangerous place for Your Highness. You should avoid this place\u2026..\u201d\u201cEven if I get to live, the Gang would definitely get blown up.\u201dIf I were to disappear, Charlotte would wipe out the Rotary Gang. \u00a0Money was very important for us.This kind of just happened by chance, but now the Rotary Gang had become our most important source of money. In my case, I didn\u2019t necessarily need that money anymore, but Sarkegaar needed it a lot.\u201cWhat a funny thing. For the Princess to become a problem like that, even though she should be in your debt\u2026.\u201dThat was something that shouldn\u2019t come out of your mouth, Mr. Kidnapper. If it weren\u2019t for you, I might have been able to actually reveal my identity.Well, what happened, happened.\u201cNow I ended up having to do something as absurd as looking for myself, but I have no idea how to go about this. Should I just tell her that I died somewhere and fabricate some evidence?\u201d\u201cThat answer might satisfy the Princess. It would be the best course of action, but\u2026. We don\u2019t know how the Princess will react afterwards.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dSuppose I would tell Charlotte that Valier was dead and show her some fabricated evidence. Assuming they would just take that manipulated evidence at face value.Wouldn\u2019t there be the possibility that they would just get rid of me and the gang after having exceeded our usefulness? It certainly would seem like a bad connection to have after all.\u201cIf I bring them results, they might just get rid of me, and if I don\u2019t, they\u2019ll just get rid of me for being useless\u2026.\u201dI felt like I was in one hell of a dilemma. Whether I did it or didn\u2019t there would be problems popping up, but when I thought about it a little differently, my head suddenly felt clear.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just do it little by little.\u201d\u201cLittle by little?\u201d\u201cYeah. She won\u2019t touch us if we show that we are making some progress at least.\u201dDamn it, I didn\u2019t want to have Charlotte as my enemy. Just to cover up for a small lie that got bigger and bigger over time, I would end up making up much bigger lies.\u201cRather if they feel like we are seriously working on this, they would have to protect us, far from wanting to get rid of us.\u201dBertus would continue to show interest in me as long as he thought I was useful. He was no different from Charlotte in that regard. I had to make some progress in finding Valier.In the meantime, she would just continue to resent me, but wouldn\u2019t touch me, no matter what I did. Rather, she would try to help me if I or the Gang was in danger.Both Charlotte and Bertus hid their true selves from the ordinary students.That was something they had in common. Charlotte pretended to be a bit of a shy person in Class B, but the way she acted and spoke to me that day wasn\u2019t the least bit kind or shy.It was as if they were made out of the same mold, so it would be the same no matter who of them became Emperor.Anyway.This wasn\u2019t a good situation at all, but let\u2019s think positively.I didn\u2019t have to choose between Bertus and Charlotte anymore.\u201cLike this I\u2019d be in a position where I could use both of them.\u201dSarkegaar smiled at my bold words.\u201cI\u2019m amazed by your insight.\u201dCould you stop smiling so creepily with that elegant face? It\u2019s giving me goosebumps.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *My short-term goal was surviving that duel next week.My long term goal was to prove my usefulness to Charlotte, and keep my activities from Bertus.And my very long term goal..\u201cGasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026. Gasp\u2026.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to just magically improve after just one day, but this is really serious, junior.\u201dPhysical training.Adriana made me recover my physical strength by injecting me with divine power after I was on the verge of exhaustion. A paladin was training the potential next Demon King with all her heart.Actually, wasn\u2019t Adriana constantly sinning by doing that? If Adriana went to hell, wouldn\u2019t that be entirely my fault?Anyway, we kept to that routine. To some extent, one needed a certain amount of physical fitness to be able to use swordsmanship. In terms of exercises, I was trying bench presses at the moment, but I didn\u2019t even have the strength to do a single one. What was the use of technology if one\u2019s basic abilities wouldn\u2019t be able to support it?So, even if I thought that I was about to lose my mind, I had no choice but to clench my fists again, while feeling that strange sensation of my exhausted body normalizing again.Following the morning training with Adriana and her advising me to eat a lot, I ate something before breakfast. Most of the time, I ate together with Ellen, who was a regular in the dining room. Since she requested for simple snacks, the storage soon got refilled with simple food that could be eaten quickly..After listening to the lectures, I resumed my training until dinner.Then after dinner, I\u2019d train and eat something again before I went to bed.After a bit, I reached the point where I could feel my physical prowess improving little by little, perhaps because I started off with a very low level of physical fitness and the support of divine power.Thursday morning.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you train using divine power?\u201dIt was easy and quick growing with it, so why did she not use it? I asked her if there was a specific reason behind that.\u201cIf one takes stimulants every day, one\u2019s body could end up hurt. That\u2019s the reason. Hunger can\u2019t be restored with divine power. I don\u2019t know if one would call it blasphemous for me to say something like this, but it\u2019s not natural to grow with the support of divine power.\u201dDivine power restored stamina, but it didn\u2019t replenish the nutrients spent. So, one could really call it a form of doping. So that was why she kept reminding me to eat a lot.Was that\u00a0stimpack?\u201cThis is just temporary, you hear? If you want to reach a certain level, you have to do it on your own, junior.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dAs if she wanted to clarify something, Adriana more or less told me that she won\u2019t keep on being my stimpack forever.I knew very little about what was going on on Class B\u2019s and Ludwig\u2019s side, but they should be doing fine..Originally, there would have been a scene where they were conflicting with the students from Class A who were trying to pick a fight over each and every little thing.I attracted all of Class A\u2019s aggro, so they didn\u2019t even have time to care about Class B.I, a big villain, took on all of the early villains\u2019 hatred and malice, so there was no \u201caggro\u201d left for the main character.What the hell? I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.Anyway.I continued to train and train some more.So naturally, I ran into Ellen a lot. Our daily routine was almost identical. We mostly ran into each other in the dining room and the gym.That\u2019s how it was for the most part.When I saw her eating whatever she felt like, I really had the urge to give her some of the food I made. Of course, I took all the credit for that.\u201cYou\u2019re really lucky that you came to Temple.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWith the amount of food you eat daily, you could ruin a whole household.\u201dLooking at Ellen, who had just swallowed a huge amount of pasta that I just made, made me feel like dying. I really wondered if there was perhaps a black hole in her stomach.At my words, Ellen looked at me with a sour look on her face, spitting out:\u201cI didn\u2019t want to come here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cTemple told me to come.\u201d\u201cHuh, ah\u2026. I see.\u201dWas she arguing with me now, because I said that she could destroy a household like that? Wait, she was talking about herself, right?She didn\u2019t tell anyone about herself, so no one knew that she was that Warrior\u2019s sister except the Prince, but here she was telling me that she was told to come here, because I scolded her for eating like a black hole. She didn\u2019t want to come here.That was what she had said.Of course, I knew about her personal matters, but it was surprising that she told me a bit about herself like that.She was right. As soon as they found out that Artorius had a sister, they begged her to come to Temple.\u201cAre you mad?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThat made it clear.I was the first who ever succeeded in making Ellen sulk.* * *The training was harder on the weekends. Rather, it felt like I could rest during the lectures on weekdays. On the contrary, I worked a lot more intensely in my free time, so the weekends were a hell of my own creation to me.Adriana stayed longer than usual on those days, making me remember a lot of theoretical knowledge, trained me and made me eat a lot.Sunday.\u201cAh, that\u2019s not how you do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn the kitchen, I strictly watched Ellen cook. She came into the kitchen, saying that she would like to do it on her own this time, because I kept cooking for her. She probably was tired of me taking credit all the time.The menu was presumed to be beef stew with a lot of tenderloin. When I asked her if she knew how to make that, she said that she ate it a lot at home.\u201cHey\u2026. Huh? J, just do it like that. I just told you.\u201d\u201cIs there any salt in there?\u201d\u201cAh, this is overcooked\u2026. You\u2019re teeth will hurt if you try to eat this, you know? Is this supposed to train your jaw?\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s clearly missing in there\u2026. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cAdd in the herbs with this timing\u2026.\u201d...\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEllen looked at me quietly as I continued to give her instructions.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think you should look at people like that while holding a cleaver.\u201dShe continued to stare at me anyway.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRather, she seemed angry! She just quietly looked at me while holding a kitchen knife. That was hella scary! Ellen looked at me a moment longer, then continued to concentrate on cooking again.\u201cLook at your temper. Ready to put a knife into me if I just say one more word, huh?\u201dOf course, my mouth never went into silent mode. She had a different kind of flavor from cute little Harriet. She didn\u2019t seem to react at all.Honestly, I felt like I had to admit defeat, because I was the one who got pissed instead.Ellen finished cooking regardless of my extreme critique. She then took the enormous amount of stew and set it down on a table. No matter what you tell me, I thought she really wanted to make me angry.I scooped up a bowl of the finished stew, and we each took a spoonful.I stared at Ellen.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was half-joking, but the result was the same as last time.\u201cSalty.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe did say that she ate it often at home, not that she cooked it.Eventually, she went back to cooking according to my instruction, managing to make a decent stew.\u201cWhat do you think? Is it edible now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is. Who do you think I am?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs I poked at her until the very end, I finally saw furrows appearing between Ellen\u2019s brows. I felt thrilled finally having made that stone Buddha angry.Ah, I was quite the sadist, wasn\u2019t I?And then, Monday evening.\u201cThat\u2019s not how you do it.\u201dWatching me wield my sword in the gym, Ellen spoke to me casually.\u201c.\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t do it like that.\u201dEllen began to take revenge for my extreme criticism and rudeness she received from me.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46The price for upsetting the stone Buddha was great.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cEven weirder than before.\u201dEllen pointed out that all the sword techniques I displayed were wrong. Then, she demonstrated the right way to do the technique in front of me.\u201cThis is how you do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh.\u201d\u201cTry it.\u201dDamn it. This was like getting hit by a boomerang. I was paying the price for poking at this kid to make fun of her. It really pissed me off.As I clumsily followed her movements, she shook her head.\u201cNo. That\u2019s completely different.\u201dEllen showed me the correct movements again step-by-step and told me to repeat them again. Of course, whatever I did, my moves were bound to look strange to her. I\u2019m totally unskilled after all.As a result, in exchange for making Ellen Artorius, who was like a stone Buddha, angry, she gave me specific training in swordsmanship.The strongest person in my class was teaching me, so, in the end, this was a good outcome.She was someone that wouldn\u2019t have helped me even if I personally asked her.However, she didn\u2019t do this to help me. Ellen, who got angry after my server criticism and teasing, gave me lessons to do the same to me.The result was good, but the process was strange.I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen, so I got more annoyed.\u201cNot like that.\u201dEllen repeatedly told me \u201cNot like this, not like that.\u201d as if to retaliate for the lesson I gave her.Wha, what\u2026.In fact, I should feel thankful right now, as the girl with the strongest talents in the world who was also busy with her own training went out of her way to help me with my swordsmanship training.That was how I should feel.\u201c\u2026Why not?\u201dI was angry. I was even more angry because I didn\u2019t deserve to be angry. I was so mad, I had to change this up, and get back at her.I.I was the the total incarnation of a hypocrite. I found it funny to tease others, but got annoyed as soon as someone did it to me.A child was a child, so there was no excuse for that.However I was a somewhat screwed up adult, so I was a bit twisted.\u201cHey. I know you\u2019re good at it. Uh. So if you\u2019re giving me lessons, why won\u2019t you teach me properly, huh?\u201dFacing my own ugly nature head-on, I became a little passive.\u201cSo like this.\u201dEllen demonstrated moves that were close to picturesque. When she looked at me with curious eyes, wondering why I couldn\u2019t do it, it felt like she was poking at me thoroughly.Yes, I was the perfect incarnation of a hypocrite.See you later in the dining room.I\u2019ll get you later.* * *After that day, whenever we made something in the kitchen and Ellen cooked I would criticize her and nag while giving her instructions. And when I was in the gym, Ellen would give me extremely strict lessons while I was practicing my swordsmanship.It was like we were instructing each other. If one were just to hear these words, one might think what we shared was a beautiful friendship.However, I didn\u2019t think what grew between us was friendship by instructing each other, but malice.\u201cFrickin hell, why don\u2019t you know something as simple as that? Don\u2019t you know what a measuring cup is? Or how to read a cookbook?\u201d\u201cAnnoying.\u201dIn the kitchen.\u201cYou have to move your arms by this much, to that degree, like this. Why can\u2019t you do it?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m exhausted. It\u2019s been a few hours, if I were able to move like that in this condition, that would be hella weird, man.\u201d\u201cWhat about earlier?\u201d\u201c\u2026O, of course, I did better then! I was in better shape after all!\u201d\u201c\u2026If you thought that was better\u2026. Maybe you need to suffer a bit more.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re oh so great, huh?\u201dIn the gym.Like this we were building up that chain of malice caused by our extreme instructions.By the way, even though she always said it was annoying, she definitely had fun cooking. She seemed tired of snacks. I could see that she was doing what I taught here even though she wasn\u2019t that good at it.Technically, she genuinely seemed to want to learn how to cook for herself even after listening to my instructions, rather than just wanting to show off what she cooked to me.I had to learn swordsmanship to increase my physical abilities anyway, so I did what Ellen told me to.It wasn\u2019t just swordsmanship training.\u201cTry.\u201dI also sparred with Ellen. When I rushed and stabbed my sword towards her, Ellen put her sword against mine and slid it outwards, and hit my solar plexus with her right shoulder.-Puck!\u201cKak!\u201dAs soon as I fell, Ellen put her sword against my neck.\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201dThis couldn\u2019t even be called sword play anymore, it was just a one-sided beating. Whatever I did, she just sent me flying in an instant.\u201cWasn\u2019t that a body blow? That\u2019s a foul, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAt my cheeky words, Ellen just tilted her head.\u201cThere are no such things in a real battle.\u201dThose were some cruel words for a child to say, but she was right, so I couldn\u2019t refute.After that, Ellen taught me various forms of swordsmanship, offensive and submission techniques while practicing like that. Ellen knew a lot of things we hadn\u2019t learned yet from the swordsmanship theory lecture.It was true that it was more beneficial to train with a living partner than just stubbornly training swordsmanship techniques on your own.I looked up her physical data out of curiosity. There weren\u2019t any details, and a lot of her talents were redacted, but it did get announced in the classroom. It was like a simplified form of the status screen, so to speak. This was also used in the original.Royal Class, Year 1, A-2, Ellen.[Strength 16.5(B)] [Agility 18.3(B+)] [Dexterity 20.2(A-)] [Magic 23(A)][Stamina 15.3(B-)]Talents[Weapon Mastery][Magic Control]It was very simplistic, compared to my status that the system displayed to me. Information that the physical scanner wouldn\u2019t be able to grasp would not be displayed on it. For example, the rank of one\u2019s swordsmanship or the skills one had.Ellen had a lot of talent, but the list got reduced a lot by Temple, only leaving Weapon Mastery and Magic Control. Although she already had the comprehensive talent, Weapon Mastery, Magic Control was another one. It included the talents Magic Manipulation, Magic Sensitivity and Magic Growth.Just by having these two talents, she was already far ahead of Bertus, and yet they dared to call her Number 2.She wouldn\u2019t even need a talent to be better.Even when considering her physical abilities, Ellen far exceeded mine which were mostly ranked as F or D.In the combat rank classifications, there is little change in the rank even if one\u2019s numbers increased and one reached a higher rank.In that classification system, Ellen was already at a ridiculously high level.Having a Status of S Rank and higher was at the level of a superhuman. In the first place, that rank could only be reached by someone of master level or higher.I didn\u2019t know what her combat rank would be, but it would probably be above A Rank.None of her classmates, or anyone from the Royal Class for that matter, possessed that level of physical ability.\u201cUrk!\u201d\u201cHuk!\u201d\u201cKerk!\u201d\u201cUwark!\u201d...Didn\u2019t it seem like that bastard was just using this as an excuse to beat me up?However, I also realized a lot of things through that.In the end, swordsmanship wasn\u2019t just about using the sword, but the whole body, including one\u2019s fists and feet. There were even techniques that implemented characteristics of grappling that included performing faints with the sword to grab the opponent\u2019s collar.That was how I came to the realization that the arm that didn\u2019t hold the sword was also very important, whether holding the sword with both hands, to deflect the enemy\u2019s sword, to subdue the enemy empty handed or to catch the enemy\u2019s blade.There were so many applications that I couldn\u2019t memorize all of them.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u2013 Thud!At the time, she flicked away my sword, she almost crushed me, not forgetting that strange action of pointing her sword at my neck\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d\u2026telling me that I was dead after subduing me.\u201cYou\u2019re heavy, man\u2026.\u201dEven if it was part of swordsmanship, don\u2019t ride on me like that. During our spars, Ellen showed me many different ways how one could get beat up with a sword. This time she showed me something dumbfounding.\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you making fun of me right now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you now holding your sword upside down to beat me up?\u201dShe was holding her sword blade and hit me on the head with the cross guard. When I saw that, I felt it was so ridiculous I almost froze. Was she insulting me?Ellen shook her head.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s actually a way to use it. Against heavily armed enemies.\u201d\u201cIs there really such a strange technique in swordsmanship? What if one ended up cutting their hand?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t cut that easily.\u201dEllen said that it wasn\u2019t only possible because this was a training sword, but I didn\u2019t trust her 100% on that. Anyway, as I already knew from first-hand experience, Ellen wasn\u2019t on the level of having to learn swordsmanship like my other classmates.Ellen tried teaching me her swordsmanship, including how to subdue an enemy, and told me to try it as well. In other words, she beat me up so much that my losses couldn\u2019t be counted anymore, so in the end, she had no other choice but to explain it to me slowly.She taught me how to deflect a sword, how to use my left arm without holding the sword, and finally something similar to toppling techniques to make your opponent fall, which seemed like they came straight up out of a martial arts game.Still, I was starting to wonder if I could ever do these kinds of things.\u201cYou\u2019re too slow, and your motions are clumsy.\u201dEven while I was getting crushed under her, Ellen shook her head as if this wasn\u2019t it either. No, well, if I were a real adolescent boy, I would be really excited to be in this kind of situation right now! This is really crossing the line!Couldn\u2019t she see that No. 5 Cliffman, who was standing beside us at the moment, clinging to his sword, was spying on us, wondering what we were doing? Couldn\u2019t she see him swallowing hard?Wait.Wh, why was she?He, hey, hey!She was looking at me as if I was just a little brat!\u201cDo it again.\u201dNot only me, but Ellen was also covered in sweat as she was sparing with me for a long time now.I thought that now was the right timing. My opponent was extremely arrogant and saw me as just a child.As a result.-Kang! Kakang!\u201cMy arm will rip ooout!\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201dWe were both focused on swordsmanship practice and the lessons.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The date of the duel was just after lunch time on Sunday.And since Friday, Ellen was making me practice quit the strange things.\u201cHold it tight.\u201d-Bang!\u201c!\u201d\u2013 Clink!She slammed against the side of the sword I was holding while aiming forward.The training sword, which escaped from my grasp, clattered on the gym floor.\u201cEvery technique in the world is useless if you lose your sword.\u201dIf you lose something that essential, you would end up dead.\u201cYour grip is too weak.\u201dMy grip was so weak that I would lose my sword with just a single hit like that. Ellen tried to test my grip strength on Friday, so she slammed away my sword rather than just suppressing me, demanding that I held onto it tightly.Not only did my hands feel tingly, the more we continued to train the weaker my grip became.And.-Katchin!How long have we been doing that? When Ellen hit the side of my sword once again, the sword shattered.\u201cWha, what\u2026?\u201dAs the sword got broken, my hand didn\u2019t hurt, but did she really hit so hard that she was able to destroy a sword? Ellen looked at the broken training sword and picked up the remaining pieces.\u201cTraining swords aren\u2019t durable usually. They break easily.\u201dIt looked like she already broke a few of them before.\u201cThat\u2019s what Temple uses though?\u201d\u201cIt would be a problem if the training swords had too high a quality.\u201dTraining swords had no edge at all. It would be a big problem, if one were to ever get hurt by using these. And it seemed like they purposefully used poor materials because if it turned out too durable nothing good would come from that. Even if it didn\u2019t have an edge, it could become a blunt weapon if one used enough strength.\u201cDon\u2019t let go of your sword.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, okay?\u201dAfter the sword broke I plopped down on the floor. I couldn\u2019t do anything anymore as my hands felt like they were about to break.Grip strength was important.As such Adriana kept on focusing on grip strength during her physical training. She continued training her grip, saying that a strong grip was essential in fighting with a sword.Today, Ellen kept on testing if I would drop my sword or not by hitting it in different angles.Cliffman also went back to rest, so it was just the two of us in the gym. Of course, there weren\u2019t always just us three here. Bertus and Erich also came by sometimes to train.Bertus had a strange smile on his face when he saw me train with Ellen. He didn\u2019t say much about my planned duel, although he seemed subtly proud seeing what I was trying here.He kind of gave the impression of watching his great subordinate No. 1 doing well even if left alone.In addition, there was little friction between me and the other children as I was completely focused on training for the duel. Well, some of my hindrances had already been cleared up, so the other children probably didn\u2019t dare to touch me.Still, all of the kids were looking forward to Sunday.It was the day when Reinhardt, the psycho bastard, would receive some true education. All those who hated my guts would come to see the duel.\u201cYou will lose.\u201dEllen suddenly told me. This girl hadn\u2019t said anything up until now about my duel.It would be weird for her not to know, why I was focusing on training like that all of a sudden.\u201cI know.\u201dEveryone told me that I was going to lose, and I knew that. Ellen also knew I wasn\u2019t particularly confident about this either, so why was she talking about that so suddenly?\u201cDo you want to win?\u201dShe even asked me things like that. I didn\u2019t know what her intentions were, but seeing Ellen ask these kinds of things, did that mean that we grew a bit closer at least?Do I want to win?\u201cNaturally.\u201dIt would be nice if I were able to win regardless whether it\u2019s possible or not. I would get three times the points as my reward after all, my friend. Ellen didn\u2019t even look at me up to that moment, but then suddenly she turned her gaze directly at me. Her calm dark-blue eyes stared at me.She really was picturesque.\u201cI know a method for you to win.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dWhat did she mean? No matter how much I thought about it, there was practically no way for me to defeat a guy with a high level swordsmanship talent as well as a sophomore. I had no idea what it was, but Ellen seemed to know at least one method for me to win this duel.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Think carefully what a duel is.\u201dThat was all Ellen said.\u201cWait, what are you talking about?\u201dI grumbled besides her, asking what the hell she meant, but she kept her mouth shut as if she didn\u2019t want to tell me any more.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47The day before the duel.On Saturday, I did my strength training with Adriana in the morning as usual.She continued her training, while aiding me with her divine power.Even after breakfast, Adriana called me back and gave me more training.\u201cHaah\u2026. Haah\u2026.\u201dI definitely felt that my stamina improved by a lot in that short amount of time. That rapid growth and this feeling across my whole body gave me some joy, even while I was in extreme physical and mental pain.\u201cJunior, don\u2019t do anything anymore tomorrow morning. Stay in good shape.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAdriana could restore my strength, but if she did that and I did more, it would have adverse effects on tomorrow\u2019s duel. I knew that much, so I was only going to train up to that point.I didn\u2019t really know what difference it would make if I maintained my best condition for this duel that I was going to lose anyway.Adriana trained me in the morning as well as in the afternoon and sat with me on a park bench in front of the dormitory. She handed me a canteen. It was more than usual.Due to the intense training, I couldn\u2019t help but gulp down a ton of water.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dSeeing me exhausted, Adriana looked at me with a strange smile on her lips.\u201cJunior, you are really weird.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI believe you have enough patience and perseverance in you, to the point that you could follow my lead very well so far. Why are you so rude to others?\u201dShe seemed to have noticed that I wasn\u2019t such an impatient, short-tempered guy during this week of training. However, she didn\u2019t understand why I was being so rude to others, in fights and outside of them. To the point that I would disgrace my opponent like that.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be ignored.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cEven if I put up with it once, there would be another guy picking a fight. Should I just endure it twice then? I\u2019d just get hit again and again, that\u2019s when you\u2019re already caught in this vicious circle.\u201dAdriana sighed deeply at my words.\u201cIsn\u2019t that tiring? Getting angry, fighting someone, bumping into them because you felt a little upset.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just like that.\u201dAfter I drank all the water from the canteen, I stared blankly at the lush park.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to get exhausted as a shitty bastard than a pushover.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026. I can\u2019t understand you at all.\u201dAdriana shook her head as if she didn\u2019t understand a thing I said.\u201cBy the way, there\u2019s something I wanted to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAdriana stared at me as if she was willing to answer if it was within her capability.\u201cA classmate of mine said that there was only one way for me to win this duel, do you maybe know what she meant, senior?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAdriana thought for a moment, as if what I said was rather bizarre. The only way I could win. What was it that Ellen thought?\u201cThat\u2026. I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201dAdriana shook her head as if to show that she really didn\u2019t know.Okay.Ellen wouldn\u2019t tell me even if I grabbed her collar and shook her. Rather, I should just give it my best shot.If I lose, I lose.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The time of the decisive battle had come.Thanks to the training I did over this week I was definitely in much better shape than I was before, as I trained while being heavily doped.Current stats: [Strength 4.8(F+)] [Agility 5.0(D-)] [Dexterity 5.9(D-)] [Magic 10.1(C)][Stamina 8.1(C-)]My strength increased by 0.8, my agility by 0.3, my dexterity by 0.7, and my stamina by 1.6. I trained with Adriana to increase my strength and stamina, and I presumed that my dexterity went up because of the spars I had with Ellen.So, why did my magic stat go up again?There were some changes in the sub-menus as well.Skills[Demon Domination \u2013 D](Unique skill of Arcdemons)(Cannot be used in current state.)[Self-suggestion](Locked)[Pseudo Swordsmanship]Comprehensive Ability Assessment \u2013 Lowest level DemonCombat Level Assessment \u2013 F+.\u2026What\u2019s with that?What was pseudo swordsmanship supposed to be? It wasn\u2019t even Rank F. It was just pseudo swordsmanship. What was that? Were they telling me that I couldn\u2019t even do F Rank Swordsmanship yet? Was I even unable to use the lowest level of swordsmanship or something like that?The fact that my combat level went from F to F+ was also truly breathtaking. They should have just left it as F. F+ makes me seem even lamer.That pseudo swordsmanship I barely obtained after such hard work was nearly crushing my heart.In any case, there was a dramatic improvement to my physical fitness. My abilities seemed to have improved evenly, and if I continue to practice, I\u2019d hit my limit someday, anyway. At that time, I would have to use achievement points or something, but first, I had to achieve whatever I could with my own body.Afternoon.First Year Class A\u2019s dormitory gym.There were quite a few people now in this place where Ellen and I clashed swords repeatedly.A lot of people came just to watch me lose.Bertus was absent. It was the weekend, so it seemed likely that he returned to the Imperial Palace and wasn\u2019t particularly curious about my duel\u2019s results.Everyone of Class A, except No.1 Bertus and No. 3 Liana de Grantz, were present. It was rather surprising that Ellen came to watch my duel. All the classmates that were present when I messed with this senior were here.There were also some of Class B present.\u201cReinhardt! Cheer up!\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dOf course, the kind Ludwig came to support me. He seemed to have brought some friends with him with whom he was particularly close with. B-9 Delphine Izadra and B-10 Lanian Sesor. I never even held a conversation with either of them.It didn\u2019t seem like I would ever have anything to do with them in the future. Pretty funny that I didn\u2019t have any connection to the kids I wrote about the most.And she was a bit far from the others, but she also came to watch. Charlotte was watching silently from afar.That was weird. I was sure she didn\u2019t come to cheer me on. Rather, it seemed more like an investigation. Maybe she was curious as to how I would act in a duel, or she wanted to ask me about the progress in Valier\u2019s search.It somehow seemed like she was trying to confirm my usefulness.There were other people, I didn\u2019t expect to see here, for example, B-3, Scarlett. Her red eyes and hair made her stand out.I didn\u2019t have any connection to her either, so why did she come to look? I wouldn\u2019t be very interested in something that had nothing to do with me. Strictly speaking, if I were her I wouldn\u2019t want to go near Class A even more.\u201cWhy did that cursed bitch come here? How unlucky.\u201dScarlett came to watch my duel, even though she had no reason to. Erich, who seemed desperate to bully her, was also here after all. Although I stood far away from Erich, she definitely stared at me.What was this?Since this event never happened in the original, there should have been some motive behind her actions that couldn\u2019t be found in the original.My classmates were made up of these kinds of people, and most of them would love to see me get horribly trampled. Ludwig excluded, I had no idea what Ellen was thinking. She was just squatting at some corner, looking at me.\u201cYou\u2019re going to be in big trouble today, you beggar. Be prepared.\u201dHarriet smirked behind her hands.\u201cOh, Have fun watching.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cHave fun.\u201d\u201cWha, what really\u2026.\u201dHarriet looked dazed again when I told her to have fun while watching me get beat up.Preconceptions seemed to be very important. At first, I snapped at her a bit because I got annoyed, but when I thought it over again I couldn\u2019t see her as anything but a cute little kid, so no matter what she did, it seemed kind of endearing.In other words, when I saw this girl, who I\u00a0 obviously set up as a villain, act like this I couldn\u2019t help but find it cute and she might have unexpectedly become my favorite character.Because she didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on.On the seniors\u2019 side, it seemed like the entire Second Year Class A came. Seeing as there were more than ten people there, did some from Class B come as well? Did they want to see the face of the guy who dared to defy one of the seniors? Was it something like that?The faces I could recognize were the duelist I was going to face, Art de Gartis, Adriana and the little brat named Redina who looked between me and Art with a teary expression.I should really go buy her something later. I couldn\u2019t believe I said something like that to such a nice girl. My neck was going numb from just thinking about that.She was such a good and kind girl!Yeah! I deserve to be hit!And then there was the observer, Mr. Epinhauser.\u201cI think we\u2019re ready, so let\u2019s go ahead with this.\u201dActual duels were actually held with one\u2019s life at stake. However, duels between students shouldn\u2019t be death matches.Therefore, duels were only conducted under the supervision of a teacher who was able to restrain the students at any time.Mr. Epinhauser didn\u2019t question why we were fighting. He was just doing what the regulations stipulated him to do, so he allowed us to do this.If it were Mr. Mustrang, he would have told us not to do this. Their personalities were polar opposites.\u201cArt de Gartis who had his honor sullied by Reinhardt\u2026. I\u2019ll just read it as it was written in the report.\u201dMr. Epinhauser began to read the report done on the circumstances of our duel.\u201cOn Saturday, two weeks ago, First Year A-11 Reinhardt grabbed the crotch of Second Year A-3 Art de Gartis and squeezed it hard\u2026.\u201d-Pffft!-Kufufum!-Oh my god!Mr. Epinhauser read that part so seriously, that everyone around, no matter on what side they stood, began to laugh. Either way, the teacher just read it all to the end.I also found this quite funny and Art\u2019s expression became quite weird. But I gotta say, Mr. Epinhauser was one hell of a guy.\u201cHe claimed that he suffered from extreme mental and physical pain as well as incredible humiliation, which consequently damaged his reputation. Therefore he requested a duel, demanding an apology from Reinhardt, No. A-11, who accepted this duel. Am I correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYees\u2026.\u201dArt didn\u2019t laugh, but I barely managed to answer in a slurred voice, because this was just too funny.\u201cState what you want in return for victory.\u201dArt replied to Epinhauser\u2019s words.\u201cI want Reinhardt to kneel before his seniors and apologize for his disrespect and I want him to swear to always respect his seniors from that point on.\u201dWhat he wanted for his victory was an apology and respect. What he meant was that whatever they decide in the future I should kneel before them and just nod my head. This time Mr. Epinhauser looked at me.My reward for gaining victory in this duel I had a slim chance of winning.\u201cI hope that these absurd acts that the seniors were trying to impose on us so far will not be forced either on me nor my classmates anymore. Of course, they should apologize as well.\u201dAt my words, the children\u2019s expressions became strange.Even if it was obvious that I was going to lose, they didn\u2019t expect me to say that I wanted them to stop bullying my classmates in return for victory.What were they looking at me like that for?It was a reward I wouldn\u2019t even be able to receive anyway.\u201cGood. Ars, the god of war, shall take the side of the righteous.\u201dDueling was, after all, a barbaric act.It was clear that God would only stand on the side of the righteous, so the one who won was always in the right. Whoever was chosen by Ars, God of War, would win. That just sounded like bullshit.And then, right when Mr. Epinhauser was about to announce the start of the duel.\u201cTeacher.\u201dArt, unable to hide his displeasure, raised his hand.\u201cI will nominate a champion as my right as a duelist.\u201dThis.What the hell was he talking about?A champion?\u201cName him.\u201d\u201cMy champion is Third Year A-7, Mayarton.\u201dArt, with a distorted expression on his face, retreated and someone else took his place in front of me, receiving his training sword. The one who accepted it was laughing as if this situation was just too funny to bear.Only then did I realize. Even if all the second years, including people from Class B, were here, the number just wouldn\u2019t add up.That meant the guys from Year Three Class A came here as well.\u201cSo you were the guy who told us to come when the Prince was around, yeah?\u201dThe third years were offended by what I said and took Art\u2019s duel seat. I dared them to try and come at us when the Prince was around, but they couldn\u2019t do it, so their pride was hurt, hence they wanted to take care of me themselves.Art also seemed to have gotten forced into this rather than this actually being his will, and Adriana looked at this scene wide-eyed. I guessed she didn\u2019t know that this would happen.The guy in front of me looked down at me with a fishy smile.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re just as skilled as your dog mouth, Junior.\u201dAt that moment I finally realized what the only way I could win was.Choosing a great warrior as my Champion.A duelist could choose someone to fight on their behalf with their right.Then I looked towards Ellen Artorius, who was squatting in the corner, staring at me quietly.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-NodShe looked at me and nodded her head.That was the only way I could win.At that moment, Ellen signaled to me that she could be my Champion.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Things were going differently from what I expected. I didn\u2019t think I would win this duel to begin with, but I never expected the third years to make their appearance. How cheap could these guys even get? You didn\u2019t want to mess with us when the Prince was around, but now you were trying to bully your juniors like this?The odds of winning, which were already slim, now became slimmer, though this probably wouldn\u2019t change much.However, that guy in front of me, Mayarton, kept staring at me as if he was thinking about how to truly educate me.My classmates were equally surprised by the sudden appearance of this third year Champion.If I named Ellen as my Champion she would be willing to come up. But no matter how good she was, would she be able to beat a third year? He had been at Temple for two years longer than her after all.Maybe, she would win. I had no idea what Mayarton was like, but she should be more than enough to win. If one wanted to beat Ellen, one had to be a superhuman or someone who had reached the limit of what a human is capable of. I didn\u2019t think that this guy was someone like that. Someone as strong as that was very rarely found in Temple, so they wouldn\u2019t do something meaningless like this.Perhaps because of this sudden change in circumstances, there was one more person whose mood changed slightly, besides Ellen.It was Adriana.She seemed angry beyond perplexity, confronted with this situation. That calm senior was looking at me quietly. I could tell just by looking at her eyes.Her eyes seemed to tell me that she would fight for me.Adriana, originally, hated this absurd hereditary tradition anyway. She even told me that she didn\u2019t like her seniors all that much.However, now that there was a third year standing before me, seeing that guy butt in in a duel against a first year, it seemed like she couldn\u2019t stand by anymore.Adriana spoke to me with her eyes.\u00a0\u2018Make me your Champion\u2019.I thought I was going around fucking up my Temple life, but there were actually two people willing to fight for me. Had I actually been doing well?\u201cIf there is no disagreement, the duel will begin immediately. If the outcome seems clear or if one side surrenders, the duel will end.\u201d\u201cTeacher. I have something I would like to suggest.\u201dMayarton looked at Mr Epinhauser and said:\u201cCan\u2019t we just make it a rule that the duel will end if either side surrenders?\u201d\u201cAnd what would be the reason for that?\u201d\u201cThe result is already pretty clear after all. However, I want to teach some manners to this rash junior here.\u201dSo, unless I explicitly said I surrender, the duel wouldn\u2019t end? He would definitely win with the normal rules, but he didn\u2019t want the duel to end as soon as his sword touched me.His purpose wasn\u2019t to defeat me, but ro crush me.\u201cReinhardt, do you agree to these terms?\u201dI\u2019ve been hoping for that, you bastard.\u201cYes, but instead I have a condition.\u201d\u201cWhich would be?\u201dEllen and Adriana would both be willing to fight for me. Circumstances had changed, and I had been caught by a hell of a lot worse bastard than Art. Art probably would have wanted to fight me fairly.However, that guy definitely would treat me a lot worse than him.The situation changed and so did my judgment.\u201cMayarton is a third year, and I\u2019m just a first year. There\u2019s a clear difference in ability in not just a single area.\u201dMr. Epinhauser nodded his head as if agreeing with me.\u201cI want to use my right as a duelist and\u2026.\u201dWho should I call?\u201cAsk the opponent for a handicap.\u201dI didn\u2019t call for anyone.* * *When Ellen talked to me the other day she meant that if one thought about what kind of duel this was, one would think of choosing a champion.However, when Art nominated his champion, I thought of something else.A handicap.If there was just too much strength difference between you and your opponent, you could give the opponent a handicap. That was the kind of situation I was in right now.Neither Ellen nor Adriana seemed to have expected that I would use the handicap instead of nominating a Champion. Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t have thought to use the handicap either if this Champion didn\u2019t suddenly appear.Mayarton burst out in laughter at my words.\u201cJunior, are you seriously planning on beating me?\u201dHe was smiling, but seemed to be really angry. It was like he thought that I believed that I would be able to beat him if I just gave him a handicap. Mr. Epinhauser, the observer of the duel, nodded.\u201cGood. During the duel, Mayarton is forbidden from using his left hand.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Mayarton who gave himself that handicap, but Mr. Epinhauser. Mayarton snorted at him and hid his left arm behind his back, as if that handicap didn\u2019t matter at all.Before I wouldn\u2019t have thought that to be a big handicap either, but I had learned what an important role the hand which didn\u2019t hold the sword played while sparring with Ellen. Having one arm sealed away was a huge handicap.Of course, it would be very unlikely for me to surpass this power difference with just that.Then, before everyone\u2019s eyes, Mr. Epinhauser declared:\u201cStart the duel.\u201dMayarton didn\u2019t immediately rush at me. He held his training sword in his right hand and slowly approached me with his left arm hidden behind his back. I didn\u2019t have a single strategy in my mind. Would the countless skills I learned from Ellen really work on someone like him? If I had some good skills, I might have been able to overcome this gap, but I only learned some things by sparring.I didn\u2019t even know proper swordsmanship yet. It would be arrogant to think that I learned it properly when I only just learned a few techniques.That guy approached me as if he just went out for a walk, he wasn\u2019t feeling wary of me at all.\u201cDid you freeze up?\u201dWhen the man approached me with his sword pointed forward and tried to enter my range, I pushed his sword to the side and tried to push in.-Kang!\u201cKurk!\u201dHowever, as if he saw through all my movements, he powerfully slashed at the sword I was holding with both of my hands, while he held his with one hand.That shock forced me to take a few steps back. Even though I was holding my sword with two hands, it felt like my palms were going to tear apart.\u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201dMayarton stared at me, having been pushed a few steps back.I was very confident that he\u2019d be able to subdue me right at this moment, but he was trying to play with me. He was trying to trample my pride and make me realize that I was nothing in front of him. Mayarton leaned over his body and ran straight at me.-Kang!Then he started attacking me.-Kang!\u201cKuk!\u201d-Kang!He attacked the sword I was holding, to be exact.Intentionally.-Kang!\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u2013 Clink!As soon as I let go of my sword, he kicked me in the stomach.-Pow!\u201cCough!\u201dI realized something as soon as I collapsed to the floor together with my sword. Until I surrendered, until I bent my pride and surrendered.That guy would continue this.\u201cWhat are you doing, Junior? Letting go of your sword like that.\u201dHe kicked the sword I dropped towards me.\u201cPick it up.\u201d-Claaang!As soon as I picked up the sword, Mayarton rushed at me and hit the side of my training sword once again.The sword slipped out of my grasp and rolled to the floor again.Mayarton smiled at me.\u201cPick it up.\u201dI could see now why Ellen trained me to properly hold my sword and not let go of it.She knew that they would do this to me.* * *-Kaang!The power of my grip was gradually getting drained away.\u201cI really don\u2019t get it.\u201d-Thud!\u201cUrgh!\u201dEvery time I let go of my sword, he would hit me with his elbow, kick me and knee me as if I was being punished for it.\u201cSomeone like you, who has no skill or credibility.\u201d-Puck!\u201cKrrk!\u201d\u201cWhy did you decide to mess with us?\u201dHe had no intention of subduing me. He saw me on the floor and kicked the training sword towards me.He blew away my sword and gleefully watched me pick it up again.The humiliation given by the act of having one\u2019s sword hit out of one\u2019s hand and made to pick it up over and over again was no joke.I felt miserable and ashamed at the thought that I was only on the level of a toy for my opponent. Nothing had changed about that even if he was just a piece of trash that found joy in beating up his juniors who were two years younger than him.I knew I would lose and I knew I would get humiliated like this. In addition to the humiliation I felt, the pain all over my body was enormous as what he was subjecting me to was more like corporal punishment than an actual fight.I held my sword again, and it got slammed out of my hand yet again.-Kaang!My palms were torn and bleeding.This was no longer a duel. It wasn\u2019t a duel to begin with. He didn\u2019t treat this as a duel from the start.He just casually walked towards me, swung his sword lightly and make my sword bounce off. Then he kicked and slapped me when I was defenseless, treating me like a joke.He looked down at me as if I was pathetic as I was continuously falling down and getting up.\u201cYou\u2019re nothing before a Swordmaster.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrgh\u201d\u201cStay down, you bastard.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cHow good things would have been if you acted nicely.\u201d-Bang!\u201cUggh!\u201d\u201cYou lost. Come on, say you surrender.\u00a0 That would be more comfortable for you, right?\u201d-Pow!\u201cGuh!\u201d\u201cDo it.\u201d-Pow!\u201cUrg\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d\u2013 Pow!\u201cWell, fine by me.\u201dHe kept insulting me, not showing the slightest bit of sympathy as I kept trying to get up.I was a filthy bastard, but that guy was a little different.That guy wasn\u2019t just dirty, he was cruel.As I was trying to cover up my lack of ability with acting dirty, that guy did it by acting cruel.And he was clearly incomparably stronger than me.The more I got up and tried to resist, the more he seemed to be pleased rather than showing admiration for my endurance. It looked like that guy felt delight at his victim\u2019s futile stuggle.I felt the atmosphere around me as I grabbed my training sword again.There were no emotions in Mr. Epinhauser\u2019s expression and eyes.However, most of my classmates\u2019 expressions were distorted.There were cases like that.In any kind of event, if one side was starting to lose miserably, there would be some who would unwittingly start to cheer for that team.They don\u2019t want the other team to be so helplessly crushed, so they want them to do a little better.Now I was on that miserably losing side.Harriet de Saint-Owan, who showed delight at first at me receiving some true education, was also at a loss. Her complexion was completely white. She looked between me and Mr. Epinhauser. It was as if she was asking with her eyes why he didn\u2019t stop this fight even though it was clear who the winner was.She had been imagining it, but she didn\u2019t think it would be like this.I didn\u2019t know I would end up this miserable either.Some were calm.Ellen was still looking at me and so was Charlotte.Rather, the people who loathed and hated me were the ones who got terrified. It seemed like they thought that I would end up dying like this.Even though duels at Temple could be called child\u2019s play compared to actual duels, it was still a duel after all.It wasn\u2019t at the level of a simple match.The duel wouldn\u2019t end unless someone surrendered. Even Mr. Epinhauser wouldn\u2019t intervene unless my life was at risk.I didn\u2019t even want that kind of intervention. Watching me crawl back up again, the other kids\u2019 faces distorted, not Mayarton\u2019s though.It seemed like he wanted me to surrender.He wanted me to admit defeat and back off.I didn\u2019t know why I was doing this. In a complete mess, I looked at Mayarton with my whole body aching as well as my hands.I wouldn\u2019t be able to win.However, the wind seemed to be picking up.Although I wouldn\u2019t be able to win.That wretched, cruel, fucking bastard.\u201cYou, I\u2019ll get one in.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEven if I got crushed and trampled over, I would definitely get in a single punch.\u201cI\u2019ll fucking get you at least once, you son of a bitch!\u201dI would at least get one hit in.The reality of my coming defeat or any plans I had about developing my supernatural power by putting me in an extreme mental state, all of that was forgotten in my seething anger.I got hit too many times.I was hit so hard, that all the heat rushed up straight to my head.If I didn\u2019t get even a single bite out of that fucking bastard, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep for the next month or so.I rushed at him with all the strength I still had left, and prepared to use something. If I would hesitate, he would either kick me or hit me with his sword.I never planned on using this for something like that.But, I was so fucking annoyed that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.[Used the \u2018Revise\u2019 Function.][20 Achievement Points are required to trigger this event.]I hit the sword that blocked my eyes and made \u2018something that originally shouldn\u2019t happen\u2019 happen right at that moment.His sword.It shattered the moment my sword hit it.\u2013 Kaang!The sword that blocked mine broke, dyeing Mayarton\u2019s expression in surprise.\u2013 Pow!\u201cGah!\u201dAt the same time as my training sword struck his head, I rammed my knee into \u2018the place\u2019 that started this whole duel.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Training swords weren\u2019t made out of durable material.I remembered Ellen telling me that. And the constant use of this particular one made this event possible. The less probable an event, the more achievement points it would require.Conversely, if it was highly probable it would require relatively few points.The event of a training sword breaking after constant collisions, wasn\u2019t that improbable. So, I was able to trigger this event using a very small amount of points.It was definitely more probable than making someone highly trained in close combat suddenly fall over or surrender. In the end, I was able to land a blow using the methods available to me.Knowing this pain, Art put his legs together, and the man in front of me grabbed his thing and stepped back with a painful expression on his face.\u201cU, urgh\u2026. This, this dog\u2026. This dog-like bastard\u2026!\u201dUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t fall down even though he was sweating profusely. If he recovered from his stunned state, there would be more severe consequences for me.His sword was broken, so Mr. Epinhauser took out a new one and threw it to him.I couldn\u2019t give him time to pick it up.If he recovered from his damage, I would be dead.I rushed in while that man, who was shivering after being kicked in the crotch, clumsily tried to pick up the training sword.-Thud!\u201cAah!\u201dI didn\u2019t swing my sword, I hit him with my body. As I looked at Mayarton, who was still in pain, I held my training sword upside down.-Pow!Then, as Ellen showed me the other day, I slapped him in the head using the cross guard.She told me that it was used against heavily armed enemies, but now I was using this to stun that guy.-Bang!\u201cArgh! Y, you son of a bitch!\u201dIf I were able to use my full power, this would have ended in his head splitting open, but because I lost a lot of my strength it only made him feel some pain. I hoped he would at least faint.-Thud! Pow! Pock! Bam!While he still hadn\u2019t recovered yet from the pain, I kicked him, trampled on him and slapped him in the face.However, his body, which had been trained to the limit, didn\u2019t receive any meaningful damage. He squatted and endured all my powerless attacks. It was the same for him. The fight wouldn\u2019t end if he didn\u2019t surrender.He would just wait it out until he recovered.-Thud!\u201cArgh!\u201dAnd that moment came pretty fast. As he pushed me away, he took a step back and got up.I had no time to relax. This senior\u2019s face was flushed red, probably because he got humiliated by a first-year junior.What kind of duel was this?It was just a dog fight.This was just a quarrel between children with no pride, honor or respect. His eyes gleamed with life.The expressions of the onlookers started to get weird.I was helpless, but because I unexpectedly counterattacked, did they start to cheer for me? Did they honestly think I could win this even remotely?\u201cYes, don\u2019t ever surrender. Please.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t gonna happen. The senior was still waiting to recover or he was ready to stop me if I came anywhere close him. Right now, he was just watching.I could surrender now. I paid him back after all. I could give up now. It would be my win in a sense if I surrendered now.Something like: \u201cI\u2019m surrendering now to save your face\u201d.That would be the best way to make him angry.That would be the case.\u201cSurrender? Yeah, won\u2019t happen. I have no intentions of doing that, you bastard.\u201dI wanted to win.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll, win this.\u201dAfter I gave him a kick to his damn jewels. Seeing his face distorted like that.I tasted how sweet revenge was.\u201cYou just managed to get in one cowardly surprise attack, and you think you\u2019re gonna win?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI wanted to win. I wanted to defeat this guy and grant him some behavioral training.I wanted to make that bastard kneel in front of me and apologize.So.I wanted to win.If I were to lose, I would have to kneel before that guy and Art and apologize. Getting beat up was shameful, but having to say that I was wrong when I didn\u2019t even think that what I did was wrong was a lot worse.I didn\u2019t like that at all. I didn\u2019t need some grand reason or convincing probabilities, I just didn\u2019t want to lose. I mean, no one would want that.I had to get beat up by this jerk in this unfair fight and then kneel to him and apologize right after that?I wanted to see that.I wanted to see what that guy, so convinced of his victory, who taunted me, stomped on and kicked me, looked like after he lay defeated in front of me.I wondered what kind of miserable expression he would show me, denying his defeat and showing me an even uglier appearance.I wanted to make this person who made me like this even worse off.Hence.I wanted to win.I desperately wanted to win.The guy came up to me. This raging attack won\u2019t just blow away my sword, it would break everything in my body. If I allowed the next attack to hit, there would be no getting back up from that.There was also a limit to holding out through sheer tenacity.Breaking another training sword would be unlikely, so it would cost more points. Maybe it was impossible even.There would be no way for me to win if I wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand that next blow.\u201cHow the hell do you plan on beating me, huh? Why don\u2019t you show me?\u201dI didn\u2019t have anything like that.Still.I wanted to win anyway. Just because there was no way for me to win, that didn\u2019t mean I was forbidden from wanting to. I couldn\u2019t win, but I still could have the desire to win.I needed to see him lying under my feet no matter what.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThat was when I realized.I thought that I shouldn\u2019t have come because I would lose anyway.I knew I would lose, but I had to fight in the hopes of winning.No, this wasn\u2019t even what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t even close to the thing I wanted.There was no way to win, and yet I wanted to win even in this situation where I had no other choice but to lose, I wanted to grasp victory, and I wanted to be certain of my victory.I now vividly remembered what I had to do.I caught my breath as I watched that guy approaching.\u201cHow the hell are you going to win?\u201dHe was slowly approaching with a sly smile hanging on his lips.How?\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe answer had been decided long ago. I looked at the guy holding his sword.\u201cI\u2019ll win anyway.\u201dI was being stubborn in this situation.I didn\u2019t know how I would win, but I knew that I\u2019d win anyway.This was just a farce.\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201dMayarton seemed to think that I had gone crazy because I was pushed to my limits. That was what the other\u2019s faces also told me.No. That wasn\u2019t it. I realized this by rationally thinking about it, not because I was driven into some extreme state. I just realized how my powers worked.The name of my power was Self-Suggestion, so I had to apply it to myself. I had to believe in it myself.It\u2019s not just about wanting to win.It wasn\u2019t even just a prediction of my own victory.Even with no chance of winning, I had to constantly think that I was going to win.I had to really believe it.That was how it was supposed to be used.That was the power I had. It wasn\u2019t about what one wanted, desired or longed for. There was no reason, cause or basis for it, but you had to blindly believe that it would happen. Whining like a child, insisting like an idiot. Only if I completely and whole-heartedly believed that it was going to happen would my power awaken.If you believed in it well enough, it would happen regardless of the cause or reason. The ability would grant myself power like that.\u201cLook.\u201dThe most powerful supernatural ability that would eventually evolve into\u00a0Word Magic.\u201cI\u2019ll beat you anyway.\u201d[Awakened \u2013 Self-Suggestion]That was my power.\u2013 Boom!After getting closer, as if he couldn\u2019t stand looking at me anymore, he lowered his upper body and rushed towards me.-Bang!\u201cWuark!\u201dI reacted to those movements that I shouldn\u2019t be able to react to and smacked him in the face with my sword.-Thud!Mayarton fell to the same part of the floor where he had started his rush.He was down on the ground.I couldn\u2019t feel the pain and wounds all over my body.I was in an extreme state of exhilaration as I grabbed this shivering bastard\u2019s hair.\u201cKuh\u2026 Urgh\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to get what happened just now. The reactions around us were the same. It would be unbelievable to see the guy who was barely able to move his body properly until just a while ago to suddenly display such power.I grabbed his hair and slammed his head back down on the floor.-Bam!\u201cUrgh!\u201d-Bam!\u201cGaaark!\u201d\u2013 Boom!\u201cKurgh!\u201dMayarton\u2019s body trembled after I hit his head three times against the floor of the gym. Just as Mr. Epinhauser didn\u2019t interfere when I was getting beat up, he didn\u2019t intervene when I was smashing Mayarton\u2019s head against the gym floor. He was just watching. That was some scary level of composure.No one knew what was going on.\u201cSurrender.\u201d\u201cHuh. Hah\u2026. Ho-how\u2026. How\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll lose anyway if you faint. Do you want me to smash in your head until you faint? Fine by me.\u201d-Bang!\u201cKurgh!\u201d-Bang! Bang! Bang!Amidst this complete reversal without rhyme or reason I grabbed Mayarton\u2019s messed up hair again and made him stare straight at me.\u201cI told you.\u201d\u201cUuh\u2026. Urgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cI was going to beat you anyway.\u201dA reality forced to happen.Self-suggestion was that kind of ability. The greater my absurd belief the stronger my power grew.My vague belief in my own victory seemed to be just enough to win against Mayarton. The moment I realized how to use it, I managed to believe in this scenario.Anyway, I was sure I could win.Neither madness, nor cruelty, nor malice, nor joy could be found in his eyes.Those eyes were only filled with fear and incomprehension at this situation.Good.It was good to be an object of fear.It was even better as the one who feared me was the guy who had been holding me down and beating me up until now.\u201cNow, tell me, senior. You\u2019ve been going to Temple two years more than me, you have better physical abilities and your swordsmanship is much better than mine.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help laughing and shouting.\u201cNow how about you try telling the first-year students that you\u2019re a fucking third year, huh!\u201dI could feel the people around me get frightened by my maddened roar.\u201cDon\u2019t want to? Then how about I\u2019ll make you wake up to the infirmary ceiling then?\u201dI lifted his head up high to slam him down against the floor again.\u201cI, I\u2026. I lost.\u201dI was finally able to crush his pride and get him to surrender. Mr. Epinhauser bluntly announced the result.\u201cI declare Reinhardt as the victor.\u201d[Event Quest Complete \u2013 Duel with Art][You have earned 600 achievement points as reward for your victory.]Then.With the announcement of my victory everything went dark before me.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Damn it.I told that guy I would make him see the infirmary\u2019s ceiling, but in the end it was me who woke up to it.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was after Mr. Epinhauser declared my victory, so the results couldn\u2019t have been overturned. This was the infirmary, right? The curtains were drawn so I couldn\u2019t tell if someone was around.Soon, someone opened the curtains and appeared before me.\u201cYou woke up.\u201d\u201cAh, senior.\u201dIt was Adriana. She approached me, put her hand on my forehead and nodded slowly. Did she judge that my condition was okay?\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYou won the duel, junior, but then you suddenly collapsed. This is the dormitory\u2019s recovery room.\u201dRecovery room? Was there such a thing? Was Mayarton also here? As I looked around, Adriana shook her head as if she knew what I was looking for.\u201cThat senior is in another recovery room. I wouldn\u2019t let both of you use the same room.\u201dI did hit his head quite a lot, so he would be in need of recuperation. Adriana sat down on the bed next to me and sighed.\u201cJunior, you knew what I wanted to do, right?\u201dMaybe she was talking about the look she gave me before.\u201cYeah, well\u2026.\u201d\u201cI could have fought for you.\u201dShe was asking me why I still insisted on doing such a reckless thing instead of choosing her.\u201cWere you expecting such nonsense as suddenly awakening your supernatural power at just the right time? Don\u2019t you understand things unless you get beat up?\u201dAdriana seemed angry.By the way, they must have already scanned my body once while I was fainted. So they should already know the reason why I became so strangely powerful was because of my supernatural ability.\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine as long as the results are good?\u201d\u201cNonsense. Of course, I heard about your strange aptitudes, junior, but\u2026. You did something very reckless.\u201dI knew I had a latent supernatural power and realized how to awaken it just then. However, to others this might have seemed like I was hitting my head against the floor to break it.\u201cIf it didn\u2019t go well, wouldn\u2019t it have been even worse than losing?\u201dAdriana didn\u2019t seem to know what to say in response to my reaction as if there was something wrong with that.\u201cJunior, you still have six years to live in Temple. You just started your first year. You were able to awaken a supernatural power through great coincidence this time, but will you continue to do these kinds of reckless things in the future just to turn your other aptitudes into talents?\u201d\u201cNo, not really\u2026.\u201dSupernatural powers were just special cases, and the rest of the talents I wanted I could buy with achievement points, so there wouldn\u2019t be a reason to do these kinds of things anymore.\u2026.\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t do such reckless things anymore. Also don\u2019t be rude to your seniors just because you won that duel.\u201d\u201cIt will probably happen again in the not so far future though\u2026.\u201dI was sure that everyone was wondering if my damn temper would lead me to be cut down this time. Unfortunately for them, I realized how to use my supernatural ability and grabbed the third year senior by his hair and slammed him into the gym floor.So that would mean for them that Reinhardt has only become more insane.\u201cReally now. Then I seriously have to scold this junior of mine. Got that?\u201dAdriana was staring at me terrifyingly. What would happen if this senior scolded me? I didn\u2019t know if that scolding would be in the form of words or in the form of a beating.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try to restrain myself.\u201dAnyway, I didn\u2019t want to be scolded by someone who was so worried about me to the point that she got angry. Just because she got angry with me about something like this didn\u2019t necessarily mean that she hated me.Of course, if I really were to fight the seniors I probably wouldn\u2019t get away with it so easily. Mayarton was off guard as well. If that were a real fight, it would have ended in less than 5 seconds.\u201cBut honestly, I\u2019m grateful.\u201dEven if you\u2019re thought to be crazy by everyone else, you should be nice to the people who would actually stand up for you.Adriana sighed at my words.\u201cI really don\u2019t like juniors who go around fighting all the time. I\u2019d rather have a junior that gets along with everyone.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s that guy in Class B called Ludwig.\u201d\u201cYou know, you\u2019re supposed to be that kind of person, so do you really have to say that?\u201d\u201cI guess I got born into the wrong life then.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so.\u201d-Hits!\u201cOuch!\u201dIn the end, the angry Adriana hit my head.I feel like I could make anyone mad with ease. I think that was my real talent here.***I was treated by the teacher designated to be the nurse in the recovery room. It was only natural that I ended up fainting. I forcibly raised my own strength far exceeding what my original body could handle, so it had reached its limits. Of course, I was able to leave the recovery room pretty quickly as there was no further need for me to recuperate there.Then, to my dismay, I had a consultation with Mr. Epinhauser.\u201c\u2026\u2026Self-Suggestion\u2026.\u201dMr. Epinhauser seemed worried about my supernatural power\u2019s awakening during the duel.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, No. 11. You did say that there had to be an aptitude for supernatural powers among your countless ones, so it should be possible to awaken one. It seems to me that you accepted your senior\u2019s challenge out of necessity\u2026. It\u2019s rather ridiculous, but you turned out to be right.\u201d\u201cActually, I did this because I wanted something else to happen, but it somehow turned out like this.\u201d\u201cLuck is also a talent. Just as the other talented students hadn\u2019t necessarily acquired their power through hard work. I do not know if it was mere luck, but you are not allowed to use your ability to attack someone anymore. Unless it\u2019s in special circumstances like a duel. However your ability isn\u2019t an obvious one. The downside to this is that it is hard to recognize and judge. Of course, it might be advantageous for you though.\u201dDepending on the degree I use my ability at, one might not be able to tell if I strengthened my body or not. It was extremely advantageous for the one who used it, but it was pretty disadvantageous for the teacher who had to make a judgement on it.\u201cI won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\u201cYes, although you seem to be quite violent, I don\u2019t believe you to be an idiot.\u201dMr. Epinhauser was still staring at me with his unflinching gaze.Whenever I met his eyes I always felt like this person\u2019s gaze was utterly terrifying. When he showed me this cold attitude I felt a similar type of fear I felt from Bertus.\u201cMs. Rollendria will be quite surprised to hear about you. You can go.\u201dMs. Rollandira was referring to the teacher in charge of the supernatural power class.She\u2019d definitely be surprised as the one who casually said he\u2019d somehow get a supernatrual ability, actually got one.* * *Reinhardt awakened his supernatural powers during his duel with his senior.That rumor seemed to have already spread throughout the class as well as among the seniors. When a first year and a third year fought against each other in a duel, the first year actually awakened their supernatural ability and beat up his senior.The duel itself probably became the a hot topic around the entire Royal Class before it even started, but now it came out that the first year actually won.It would have been strange if there weren\u2019t any rumors.Still.I didn\u2019t know it would turn out like this..\u201cAre you Reinhardt?\u201d\u201cI heard that duel was no joke?\u201d\u201cMayarton, that bastard, should\u2019ve been beaten some more.\u201d\u201cOh my god. You\u2019re such a little baby! Cute! Can I hug you?\u201dNo, I wasn\u2019t a baby. I was still 17. And no matter how I looked at it, I wasn\u2019t really the cute type, or was I?\u201cShould this sister buy you something delicious? Do you like macaroons?\u201dThe First Year Class A dormitory was currently crowded with seniors who came down after hearing the rumors about me.In a way, this might have been a natural conclusion.In order to defeat a single first year, a third year forced himself into the fight of a second year as his champion.At this point, Mayarton would have already been imprinted as trash in the minds of those who weren\u2019t all that interested in disciplining the juniors. Not all Class A students were strict about traditions and such.As soon as they reached their fourth year, many students turned their attention away from such things. So, many of them were already dissatisfied with Mayarton for trying to beat up a first year.But he even lost.Therefore, those seniors were bound to develop a certain degree of curiosity and favor towards me, to the same degree they disliked Mayarton.Also, although I didn\u2019t make Reinhardt look super handsome, he was still good looking enough.It was understandable that those sisters would go: \u201cYou\u2019re such a cute little baby\u201d.\u201cHow can he be so young and already so righteous? You told your seniors not to bully you and your friends anymore if you won, right?\u201dAs the rumor spread around that I participated in duel I was bound to lose anyway to make the seniors stop harrassing my class, it seemed that I now got known as a righteous guy who fought for his friends.\u201cAh\u2026Uhm\u2026 I did say that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so nice.\u201dOf course, my actual classmates who heard the seniors\u2019 fussing seemed to doubt their ears.The seniors were praising Reinhardt, the crazy dog bastard, as a good and nice guy after all. Their expressions showed that some of them seemed to want to fiercely shout, \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t that kind of guy at all!\u201d\uff0e\u201cIf anyone comes to bother you again after this, tell me. I\u2019ll scold them for you. See? If you have any problem, come straight to the Fifth Year Class A, okay?\u201d-Rumble! Rumble!If she was in the fifth year then she was 21 years old. She was a college student sister.\u2026Of course, I didn\u2019t actually see her as an older sister, she was still just a child as well.She was trying to show off and made a small storm appear in her right hand. What? Why was she doing that?Since they were seniors, their supernatural abilities couldn\u2019t be compared to those of a first year. They told me I should be proud of myself and that there should be more children like me.My classmates, of course, would never agree to anything they said.If there were any more children like me, Temple would get destroyed.Still, if one were to take the rumors at face value, I did seem like just a good little kid.There were also times when some male seniors would pat my head, saying I did a good job, but there were also some female seniors who simply crossed the line.\u201cWhat do I do? I heard you had such a hard life.\u201d\u201cAh, yeah, well\u2026.\u201dShe seemed to have heard about my origins, so a certain senior girl suddenly hugged me tightly, giving me a headache.N, no.Hey!Don\u2019t do this!Although my mind was still the same as it was before, my body was currently a healthy 17 year old!\u201cOh my, good that you were able to get into Temple.\u201dDon\u2019t do this! Th, this wasn\u2019t how this was supposed to go!When they found out that I was actually just a beggar from the streets, they couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how I was able to grow up to be so upright in that kind of environment.The seniors had that huge misunderstanding about me, to the point where I couldn\u2019t do anything about it anymore.Tired.I was really tired.I ended up becoming a star at Temple just because of one duel.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *Regardless of the misunderstandings the seniors had about me, the looks the others gave me after they returned were a little different from before.Probably because they knew I awakened my supernatural ability.They might have also felt something from my actions, fighting so hard even though I was put into such a helpless situation by that senior.The people who hated me, Cayer, Erich and Kono Lint, looked at me then went past me with their eyes tightly closed. They felt like they were no match for me, not only in terms of skills, but also in terms of mental strength.It wasn\u2019t because I fought so well, it was because of my mental strength that didn\u2019t allow me to give up no matter how badly I got beaten up. Eventually, they would get more skilled and mentally strong, but right now they were just kids. No wonder I looked weird to them.And.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHarriet de Saint-Owan was looking at me, turned her head and passed by me without giving me a single glance.Well, that certainly wasn\u2019t what I expected\uff0eWouldn\u2019t this have been the perfect time to tell me something like: \u201cYou should have gotten beat up more\u201d?\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cWha, what\uff01\u201dWhen I called out to her, she stopped as if she was waiting for that, and looked at me angrily. I could see that she was blushing.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201dHarriet frowned when I asked her that.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing though? What would I have to say to a bastard like you? Oh, yes, yes. You should have been hit a bunch more, but then you ended up using that supernatural power of yours like a coward just to win.\u201dI got the exact response I wanted to hear.\u201cReally? Weren\u2019t you rather restless when you watched me get beat up though?\u201d\u201cWha, what?\u201dHer face got even redder because she didn\u2019t think I was looking at her before.\u201cI saw you stamping your feet with a pale face, you know?\u201dI told her with a grim smile. In fact, she kept looking towards me and Mr. Epinhauser in the hopes that he might stop this fight.I was able to see all that, even while I was getting beat up. To be exact, that was the only thing I could do at that moment.Anyway, I saw her getting more and more restless, wanting Mr. Epinhauser to bring an end to all that, but he didn\u2019t.So there was just one conclusion\uff0e\u201cWere you worried about me? How cute.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not! Never ever, nope! I, I. Wh, why would I, I be wo, wo, worried about the li, likes of you? Hah! Hah! It was so refreshing!\u201dJudging by her red hot face, it seemed like she was absolutely worrying about me. In the end, there was not a single person who wouldn\u2019t feel sympathy if someone got beat up so pitifully.I went up to her and put my hands on her cheeks, squeezing them.The cheeks of that high-and-mighty princess of a Grand Duchy felt like two steamed buns.\u201c!\u201dShe wasn\u2019t even able to scream that was how dumbfounded she was. She didn\u2019t even imagine someone would dare do this to her.\u201cLeeh! Leeh goh! Shto!\u201dIt was really, really cute that she got surprised by me doing something as ridiculous as this. When I let go, this completely red-faced girl started trembling all over her body in total bewilderment.\u201cHo, how dare, dare you touch my body! Someone like you? How absurd. How. How. How could a beggar\u2026. How\u2026.\u201dShe was so angry and embarrassed that she wasn\u2019t even able to scream properly. Her pupils were shaking very strongly, one might think they were affected by an earthquake or something. This time she didn\u2019t seem that angry, she was more dumbfounded and surprised.Not only did I dare touch her precious face, but I even squeezed her cheeks and laughed at her.She was the cutest when she was like this\uff0eIt seemed like she was trying to deny reality. She probably was thinking something like: \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening to me\u201d, or something.\u201cHu, hnnk\u2026\u2026Sobsob\uff01 Sniff\uff01 Knnrk\uff01\u201dHowever\uff0eContrary to my expectations, she started to cry\uff0e\u201cHu, huh\u00b7\u2026\u201dThat wasn\u2019t it.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me? You bastard, why are you picking on me? Why do you bully me like this? Stop it! Stop teasing meee!\u201dWha, what do I do\u2026?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
