    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - Is he saying that he finds her ugly? (1)The girl in the mirror had delicate features and everything on her was just perfect. Her original bright and charming color felt just ordinary. Even her skin had a hint of yellow hue to it. It looked like pearls that were covered in dust and had lost their original luster. They were greyish and ordinary.After she was done looking into the mirror, Ning Zhi looked back at her cellphone again. There were the original owner\u2019s pictures in there. The girl in the pictures had bright eyes and shiny teeth, her skin tone fair. Just one look and nobody would be able to look away from her.Ning Zhi frowned.Her features didn\u2019t change at all so why was it that she looked so different than she was before?Suppressing her doubts, she watched as the car drove inside of the mansion area.She put the makeup mirror and her cellphone back into her purse and got ready to get out of the car. The very next second, someone had already opened up the car door.\u201cSecond Young Madam,\u201d said the butler. There was urgency in his voice. \u201cMadam asked you to hurry over.\u201dNing Zhi had already received the call when she was in the car and had learned from the butler that the Second Young Master, who was also the original owner\u2019s husband, was having another episode.She nodded, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201dInside the living room, Mother Lu looked pale as she watched her son continuously banged his hand against the wall. She felt like an ant in a frying pan and she couldn\u2019t be more anxious.\u201cIs Ning Zhi back yet?\u201d Her brows furrowed deeply and she looked very worried.The servant replied quickly, \u201cButler is already waiting for Second Young Madam up front.\u201dNing Zhi walked inside right after the servant had finished saying that.Delighted, the servant said, Madam, Second Young Madam is back.\u201dWhen Mother Lu saw Ning Zhi, she quickly said, \u201cHurry up and go stop Xiao Jue. Don\u2019t let him hurt himself.\u201dWith the exception of Ning Zhi, Lu Jue wouldn\u2019t let anyone close to him. No matter how much she disliked Ning Zhi, Mother Lu had no choice but to put all of her hopes on Ning Zhi right now.From her memory, Ning Zhi new that this elegant and well-maintained woman was Song Ya, Lu Jue\u2019s mother. She loved Lu Jue a lot and he was the one whom she cared about the most. She had never had any complaints or resentments toward him just because he was autistic.Ning Zhi looked at the man who was banging his head against the wall.He was tall and slender and wearing a red sweatshirt. With his back to her, he was methodically banging his head against the wall.Clearly, he had done this many times before and all the walls in the room was padded and wrapped in beige leather. Inside of them were probably cotton or other types of padding. The paddings were very think and there was no way that Lu Jue could hurt himself while banging his head against them.\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Stop him quickly,\u201d urged Mother Lu.Ning Zhi tried to recall. Lu Jue has always been autistic and had started treatment since a very early age. It shouldn\u2019t be too serious but, for some reason, he had never gotten any better. In fact, after being kidnapped once, his autism seemed to have gotten worse and he had become with more withdrawn. He refused to be touched by anyone and would only lock himself inside his own shell.Even Mother Lu wasn\u2019t able to communicate with Lu Jue. She could just feel anxious as she watched him.Up until the point when original owner showed up. Mother Lu noticed that Lu Jue\u2019s eyes would linger on her and allowed her to get close to him and touch him.Mother Lu was pleasantly surprised by that observation.And then, original owner married Lu Jue.As expected by all, the original owner was not fond of Lu Jue. After all, who would be fond of someone who was ill?Lu Jue was always indifferent and isolated. He didn\u2019t like to talk; nor was he interested in anything that went on around him. He didn\u2019t care about those around him nor did he care about how others feel toward him. He was living in his own world.He did not make for a good companion, let alone a life partner.Mother Lu could clearly see the dislike and resentments that the original owner had toward Lu Jue but there was nothing she could do about it. How she felt was personal and, as mighty as she was, she couldn\u2019t force original owner to have feelings toward her son.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Is he saying that he finds her ugly? (2)After quite a while, Ning Zhi was finally able to calm herself down. She confirmed from her memory that Lu Jue was not violent when he was having an episode before she felt relieved and started to approach him.The man acted like he couldn\u2019t feel pain at all and slammed against the wall repeatedly. Even if the walls were padded but a normal person would still pass out from slamming against it that way. Yet Lu Jue didn\u2019t seem like he could feel a thing.Ning Zhi had come across some articles on autism in the past and learned that many autistic patients had a delayed sensation and decreased sensitivity to pain and could potentially pose a danger to themselves.She walked over to him and tried to tug at Lu Jue\u2019s hand.His fingers were slender and his hand chilly. Ning Zhi had just touched his hand when she saw a white bubble-shaped display box appeared suddenly over Lu Jue\u2019s head with a cute black cloud inside of it.Ning Zhi thought she was seeing things and blinked a few times forcefully.Nevertheless, after blinking for a few times. The bubble display box over Lu Jue\u2019s head stayed and the black cloud was still floating inside of it.What was that?Ning Zhi turned and looked over at Mother Lu. She was looking at Ning Zhi anxiously and there was nothing over her head. Lu Jue was the only one that has it.[It\u2019s a display of his mood.]A milky little boy\u2019s voice came from inside of Ning Zhi\u2019s head. Stunned, her eyes widened. Who was talking to her?The little milky voice continued to ring inside of her head. [Black cloud means that Lu Jue is in a bad mood. A black cloud with a lightning means he\u2019s mad and a little sun means he\u2019s happy.]Ning Zhi was shocked. Lu Jue\u2019s mood would be indicated?The little milky voice carried on in a serious tone: [Lu Jue\u2019s autism has turned severe and he can hurt himself at any moment and pose a danger to others\u2019 safety. As for you, you had been locked on by Lin Tiantian as someone whom she wants to steal the halo from. Right now, your halo value is at 0. Having 0 means that your physical appearance will be in its worst state and that you will lose your life.]Ning Zhi, \u201cYou mean to tell me that Lin Tiantian had selected me as her target and had stolen all of my halo?\u201dShe knows that Lin Tiantian was the female lead in the novel and that original owner and Lu Jue were both cannon fodders who died at the end. But what was the story on the halo?[You have already died once. If your halo value is still at 0 in three days\u2019 time, you will die again.]Okay. She had it figured out now. Original owner\u2019s halo was completely stolen by the female lead which brought about her death and now she had come and replaced her.Ning Zhi was very speechless. So, all she had was three days\u2019 time to live?The little milky voice continued: [For each little sun that you collect, you can recover 1% of your halo from Lin Tiantian.]Ning Zhi asked, \u201cAll I need to do is to collect these suns in order to regain my halo is stay alive? And I can also get my looks back?]Little milky voice: [That\u2019s right.]Ning Zhi, \u201cAnd I need to appease Lu Jue in order to collect these little suns?\u201dThe little milky voice only wished it could nod. [That\u2019s right!]Ning Zhi frowned. If Lu Jue was a normal person, then this assignment wasn\u2019t that difficult. Except that he was someone with autism. Never mind about appeasing him, it would be difficult enough just trying to communicate with him.Little milky voice: [The little suns that you collect can also help Lu Jue improve his symptoms.]\u201cTreat autism?\u201d Ning Zhi was even more shocked. Autism was a kind of illness that could only be improved with intervention, not cured. \u201cYou can cure Lu Jue?\u201dLittle milky voice: [You are the one who can help him. My name is Overlord. Feel free to reach out to me anytime if you have any questions.]And it disappeared after it had finished saying that.Ning Zhi felt like busted out laughing. The milky voice didn\u2019t go well with the name Overlord at all.At the same time, Lu Jue tugged his hand that was held by her a little and stopped slamming against the wall. Instead, he looked at her being at loss.Lu Jue was a very pretty man. His face was a little pale but his features were delicate and his nose tall and straight. His beautifully shaped lips tightened shut slightly.Few male stars have the looks that could rival his even in the entertainment circle.Sensing that Ning Zhi was approaching him, Lu Jue\u2019s eyes lingered for a little while on her face before he quickly looked away.Ning Zhi was a little stunned. Lu Jue has a pair of beautiful peach-blossom eyes. His eyes that should be conveying emotions were clean and pure. Unlikely those of a normal person, they were scattered, unfocused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Is he saying that he finds her ugly? (3)The original owner did not like Lu Jue very much. In fact, she even resented him a little secretly, which was why she never had a lot of contact with him.Ning Zhi held Lu Jue\u2019s hand tightly and he did not struggle. He looked down at his own hand that was held and, as though it was wrapped in something soft, it felt good.Ning Zhi tried to community with him. \u201cDon\u2019t slam your head. Can you tell me which part of you is not feeling well?\u201dThere was a black cloud inside of Lu Jue\u2019s indicator. Overlord had said that a black cloud meant that Lu Jue was in a foul mood.Lu Jue wasn\u2019t talked about much in the book other than the facts that he was autistic and that the male lead cared a lot about this brother of his. A year later, his symptoms had become so severe that he would sit in a corner all day long without eating and drinking and finally he would have harmed himself so much that he ended his own life.As for the original owner, had she not died from her halo being stolen from her by Lin Tiantian, would have run away from the Lu family with some other man. The Lu family would then blame Lu Jue\u2019s death on her and she would have a miserable future from the Lu family\u2019s revent.Lu Jue lowered his head and did not say a word.He was the tool for her to stay alive for the time being. Any way she looked at it, Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t just leave him alone.Ning Zhi turned toward Mother Lu and the servants and asked, \u201cWhat was he doing before his episode? Did he come into contact with someone or something had happened to him?\u201d Lu Jue was most likely affected or provoked by something before he started slamming his head against the wall.The servant replied quickly, \u201cWe are not allowed to get close to Second Young Master\u2019s room normally without Madam\u2019s permission. But, at around 2 PM, Xiao Ling was cleaning in the hallway but I don\u2019t think she would dare walk inside Second Young Master\u2019s room and disturb him.\u201dHearing that, Mother Lu said sternly, \u201cHave her come over now.\u201d She was so worried about her son\u2019s condition earlier that she had failed to notice that.Under the inquiries of Mother Gu, the young maid told her that she was cleaning the hallway with the vacuum cleaner at the time.Ning Zhi remained silent for a little while before she said, \u201cBring the vacuum cleaner over.\u201dThen, the sound of the vacuum cleaner started again. Lu Jue struggled free of Ning Zhi\u2019s hand and covered up his ears with his hands while he resumed slamming his head against the wall.\u201cTurn it off! Turn it off quickly!\u201d said Mother Gu to the young maid frantically.Ning Zhi stopped Lu Jue and, after he had stopped, rested her hands over his two ears. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201dAutistic people might not hear others talking to them but they would sometimes be hypersensitive to certain noises and find them irritable. Ning Zhi had heard that some of them would be afraid of the sound of the rain or hypersensitive to noise from a hairdryer. Some of them were afraid of cars honking.Lu Jue, on the other hand, was hypersensitive to the noise from a vacuum cleaner.After the vacuum cleaner was stopped, Ning Zhi looked squarely at Lu Jue and removed her hands that were covering his ears. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. So it was the vacuum cleaner that you don\u2019t like. We won\u2019t let it disturb you again.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s eyes shivered slightly and he gave Ning Zhi a quick look before he lowered his head again.Ning Zhi noticed that the black cloud over his head was gone and only the white bubble indicator was left.She was a little surprised. Was it that easy to get rid of the black cloud? What if she wooed him a little? Will there be little suns then?Thinking of that, Ning Zhi purposefully made her voice more tender and she said to him, \u201cLu Jue, do you still feel unwell?\u201dThis body has a very nice voice. Ning Zhi had noticed that since she talked for the first time. It was light and soft and always ended a sentence with a twist, giving a tingling sensation.Unfortunately, her current look without the halo wasn\u2019t good enough for the voice.Lu Jue did not react to her.Ning Zhi got closer to him and her tender voice continued to crawl inside of his ears. \u201cSmile for me, will you?\u201dLu Jue looked up.The man had on a red sweatshirt, which made his skin tone appear even paler than it was. His eyes and brows were profound and delicate and everything about him was just perfect. He had exactly the kind of look that Ning Zhi liked. She felt that of all the celebrities and wealthy children that she had met in the past, none of them could measure up to Lu Jue as far as their looks went.Ning Zhi looked at the top of Lu Jue\u2019s head with anticipation. She wanted to see what the little suns look like.\u201cYou ugly turned.\u201d Lu Jue\u2019s voice was very deep and, perhaps because he didn\u2019t talk often, it was also a little hoarse.Ning Zhi was taken aback a little then she had it figured out. He meant to say, \u201cYou have turned ugly\u201d?He was calling her ugly?___The future of Married to the Male Lead\u2019s Brother:This concludes raw Chapter 1.As you may know, one of my series The Male Lead\u2019s Villainess Stepmother will be ending soon (July 2021) and I am currently looking for its replacement.

    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Instead of little suns, she got black clouds instead. (1)Before her transmigration, Ning Zhi was a pretty one. She had never been resented for being unattractive before.She gave Lu Jue a stare. The little fool was silly and not all there. Somehow, he knew that she had become uglier than she used to be?On the other hand, witnessing that her son had been stopped and even responded to Ning Zhi, Mother Lu was visibly happy. She knew it. Having Ning Zhi married Lu Jue was the right move.Mother Lu took off after she told Ning Zhi to take good care of Lu Jue.It was quiet inside of the room.Ning Zhi started looking around the room after she have given Lu Jue another look.The room was quite spacious and all of the walls were padded in beige color. There was barely any furniture in the room. The main colors were white and grey and seemed very forlorn even when there was a woman living there.Clearly, the original owner did not consider this place her home.There was a large patio outside of the room, the afternoon sun shining down on it made it seem less cold.Ning Zhi noticed another closet in the room. None of Lu Jue\u2019s clothes were in there; they were stored in a different closet.Looking inside from the glass door, she could see woman\u2019s clothing hanging inside. There weren\u2019t a lot of them and the closet seemed empty.Suddenly, she thought about her own closet that was filled to the brim with the trendiest dresses, purses, shoes, and jewelries from the latest season. They were all her babies.After she was done looking at it, she happened to notice that Lu Jue was heading out and she quickly followed behind him.The room next to them was a study and, following behind Lu Jue, Ning Zhi noticed that he was very tall.She was about 1.68 meter in height and Lu Jue was much taller than her. His shoulders were broad and his waist slender. He was a walking weapon in and of itself and he was difficult to overlook.Lu Shao walked in front of the bookshelf and there were many boxes on top of it. He picked up one of the many.Walking over to his desk, he poured the puzzle out of the box and the pieces took over the entire table. Ning Zhi looked at the box and it was labeled 1000 pieces.Ning Zhi picked up the lid of the box and looked at it. It was a picture of a dark blue sky covered with little planets. They looked like little glowing ants and were dazzling.Lu Jue started working on the puzzle without making another sound.Ning Zhi had never put a puzzle together before but she could still tell that this was a difficult one. She had doubts that Lu Jue would be able to assemble it.Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t interested in puzzles. She looked over at Lu Jue. It was better to look at him than at the puzzle. His features were defined, as though carved out carefully. Even his thin lips that were shut were exactly how she liked them.The little fool was so good looking; no wonder he was resentful of how she currently looked.Ning Zhi touched her cheek. Her features were very delicate now but they looked very ordinary. As though it was covered up with a layer of gauze, murky and not attention-grabbing. She hasn\u2019t even met Lin Tiantian yet, but Ning Zhi already considering her her archenemy.Look was very important to a girl. Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t just take her look, but also her health. The name Lin Tiantian alone was enough to rile up Ning Zhi.She only had three days remaining. If she did not get one little sun before the deadline and exchange it for 1% of the halo, she would die.Thinking of that, she looked over at Lu Jue once again. Her look was bright and burning.He was not just a tool to facilitate the book; he was her savior!Unfortunately, the original owner didn\u2019t care much about Lu Jue Ning Zhi had no recollection of Lu Jue\u2019s hobbies or what favorite food.Ning Zhi brought over a chair while looking at Lu Jue focusing on his puzzle.Sitting down next to him, she said with a smile, \u201cLu Jue, let me help you. It will go much faster with the two of us.\u201d How boring was it to play by himself? She was sure it\u2019d make him happy if she played with him.Lu Jue\u2019s head was still lowered. He was very focused and did not respond to Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi picked up one of the pieces. She compared it to the original drawing, trying to figure out where it\u2019d go. Nevertheless, it looked like it could go just about anywhere on this drawing of a night sky.Ning Zhi looked for an approximately spot and tried to place it.\u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d said the man in his deep and dull voice.Lu Jue picked up the piece of puzzle that she had put down and moved it to a different spot.Ning Zhi picked up another, triple checked herself, before she placed it in a corner spot.\u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d Lu Jue corrected her once again.She was, again, corrected by Lu Jue when she put down her third piece.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cHow could you tell that I was wrong? They all look the same.\u201d As soon as Ning Zhi had finished saying that, she saw a little dark cloud popped into the indicator over Lu Jue\u2019s head.Ning Zhi dared not go on. She could stoop very low in order to live. \u201cAye, I was wrong.\u201dThere was no little sun; she had managed to bring about a dark cloud.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Instead of little suns, she got black clouds instead. (2)Lu Jue did not say a word nor did he pay attention to Ning Zhi. He continued with his jigsaw puzzle. Bored, Ning Zhi could only play with her own hair.She thought she would be spending hours with Lu Jue in the study. Low and behold, Lu Jue completed the entire puzzle in just an hour.Ning Zhi was shocked.Lu Jue never looked at the original drawing when he was working on the puzzle. Ning Zhi compared it with the original drawing. There were no mistakes, not even at the most complicated spots.With a starry night sky like it and at 1,000 pieces, it would be quite difficult even when referencing the original drawing. But Lu Jue had never taken even one look at it.Did he have the original drawing memorized?Ning Zhi looked at him in disbelief. His cold and pale face was chiseled. His lips shut tightly. He was both solemn and inflexible.She recalled that many affected by autism had startlingly high IQ. They were referred to ask silent geniuses.The Lu\u2019s resident was huge and its decors glamourous, extravagant, and not tacky. The Lu\u2019s family could be seen from them.The servant ran up and took the jacket from Lin Tiantian. \u201cFirst Young Madam, dinner is ready.\u201dLin Tiantian nodded, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ning Zhi?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Sir had an episode today, Second Young Madam is taking care of him right now,\u201d replied the servant respectfully.\u201cEpisode?\u201d Lin Tiantian hadn\u2019t expected that Lu Jue has been having so many episodes as of late. \u201cI\u2019ll go rest up upstairs.\u201d\u201cYes, First Young Madam. We will let you know when it is dinner time.\u201dWatching as Lin Tiantian walked away, the servant looked at her with envy. She couldn't help but said to another servant next to her, \u201cFirst Young Madam is so pretty. I also forgot to breath when she was looking at me earlier.\u201d\u201cI know. I was stunned to when First Young Madam smiled at me.\u201dThe servant next to them agreed with them. \u201cBut, have you noticed that First Young Madam\u2019s skin has become fairer and her feature more and more delicate. Eve her body had become shapelier and filled out. She is looking more and more like Second Young Madam when she had first married into the family?\u201d\u201cFirst and Second Young Madams are cousins. It only makes sense that the two of them look alike. Besides, First Young Madam married First Young Sir. She is happy every day so she becomes prettier and prettier. On the other hand, Second Young Madam married Second Young Sir and was dull day in and day out. She had no temperament and is becoming more and more ordinary.\u201d\u201cYou are exactly right about that\u2026\u201dNing Zhi accompanied Lu Jue downstairs when it was dinner time.She finally saw Lin Tiantian, the female lead in the book.She was sitting across from her with a smile. Her deportment mild and she was pretty and attractive.Ning Zhi narrowed her eyes and walked over to her.In her recollection, Lin Tiantian, the female lead, was only just decent-looking in the past. She had become prettier and prettier gradually over time, her skin tone had become fairer and fairer, and she had become more and more attention-grabbing.Looking at her closely, Lin Tiantian, compared to before, looked like she had level 10 beautifying effects on.Now, even though Lin Tiantian wasn\u2019t as pretty as the original owner in the past, but the original owner\u2019s look was one in a million. Lin Tiantian would be pretty enough with just half of the original owner\u2019s beauity, nevermind that she had taken away all of original owner\u2019s halo.Others thought these changes were brought about by lots of money and maintenance.They were the effect of the halo.As opposed to Lin Tiantian, Ning Zhi was like a flower that was robbed of its nutrients and was starting to wilt. Her skin and turned yellow. Her originally delicate features looked ordinary anyway one looked at them. She was no longer attention-grabbing.Before she had transmigrated over, Ning Zhi didn\u2019t just have a perfect face and body. She was pretty from head to toe. She even kept her hair nice and shiny. She noticed just a little while ago that even the tips of her hair were splitting!That was a shock for someone who loved looking pretty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - Instead of little suns, she got black clouds instead. (3)Ning Zhi summoned Overlord. \u201cYou said my halo was the female lead\u2019s target. What happens if I collect little sun to get my halo back and the female lead takes them back again? I will be doing a lot of work for nothing.\u201dOverlord explained quickly: [Lin Tiantian will not be able to take the halo that you get back from exchanging little suns.]Ning Zhi, \u201cIf Lin Tiantian cannot take my halo back, will she switch to a different target and harm others?\u201d[Lin Tiantian had only one shot at picking a target. She had picked you. She will not be able to swap to a different target.]Ning Zhi didn\u2019t even want to dignify that with a comment. \u201cWill Lu Jue be negatively impacted as I collect little suns from him?\u201dNing Zhi would not claim that she was a kind person but neither did she want to hurt others for her own benefit like Lin Tiantian had done.Overlord replied seriously: [Collecting little suns would not harm Lu Jue. In fact, it will help him greatly in the future.]Ning Zhi felt better finally.\u201cXiao Zhi, I heard that Lu Jue had another episode this afternoon. Are you alright?\u201d asked Lin Tiantian as she studied Ning Zhi.She had taken the last of the halo from Ning Zhi today. She could tell that Ning Zhi\u2019s skin was no longer shiny and she looked yellowish. Even her once beautiful dark eyes had lost their brightness.Her beauty, on the other hand, had moved up another notch. Even her skin had become smoother and more delicate. She was the envy of others.These all belonged to Ning Zhi in the past. She recalled how much she had wanted to become the shiny Ning Zhi in her dreams. Nevertheless, there was nothing she could do other than being envious and dissatisfied privately. Now things were different. She had become the envy of others.Lin Tiantian was happy and it showed on her look. Her face glowed even more.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t stand her. Her tone was very nonchalant. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201dLin Tiantian gave her an I-understand look. \u201cXiao Zhi, I know it\u2019s rough for you. You can always come and talk to me about your problems at night.\u201dNing Zhi had always gone over to gripe to Lin Tiantian about how much she disliked Lu Jue and how difficult her life at the Lu family was.Ning Zhi found that laughable. Was that how Lin Tiantian wood the original owner into thinking of her like a sister of hers and her trusted confidante?Ning Zhi asked Overlord once again. \u201cHow does Lin Tiantian take my halo?\u201dOverlord: [Host is so smart. Did you see that necklace that she is wearing? It helped Lin Tiantian absorb the halo from you. The worse off you are, the more unhappy, the more it could absorb your halo.]Ning Zhi looked over at Lin Tiantian. She had a pendant with a red string around her neck. It didn\u2019t go well with the rest of her outfit at all. On the red string was a warm and smooth white lotus. That was probably what Overlord was referring to.Overlord\u2019s milky voice was very prideful: [Not to worry, Host. As soon as you get all of your halo back and her jade, lacking the nutrients from the halo, would crack on its own.]Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward, \u201cSweet.\u201dAfter dinner, Lin Tiantian wanted to chat with Ning Zhi. \u201cXiao Zhi, I don\u2019t have any work tomorrow and have a lot of free time tonight. Is there anything you would like to talk to me about?\u201dShe loved listening to Ning Zhi gripe.\u201cYou and I don\u2019t have that much to talk about.\u201d Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t be bothered to engage with her. She went back inside their room with Lu Jue.It got later into the night.Ning Zhi moved her pillow from the couch onto the large bed. Original owner resented Lu Jue and never slept on the same bed as him. She opted to sleep on the couch instead.Lying on the plain and grey large bed, Ning Zhi didn\u2019t want to sleep on the couch every night like original owner did.She was from a well-off family before she had transmigrated and was coddled since she was a child. She couldn\u2019t make herself sleep on the couch. Besides, the little fool didn\u2019t even want to talk to her or look at her. She didn\u2019t have to worry about him making a move on her at all.All of a sudden, the room to the bathroom opened up and Lu Jue walked out in his bright red pajamas.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes lit up.Lu Jue\u2019s skin were cold and fair. He was handsome, slender, and tall. He looked like an attractive demon in his bright red silk pajama.\u201cYou have finished showering?\u201dNing Zhi had just started talking when she saw that Lu Jue had already walked over to the bed.Looking at his large bed that had been invaded, his handsome face was taut, his lips shut tight. He looked straight at her and, in the indicator above his head, one black cloud appeared one after another. Each of them came with their own lightning.He was angry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - This man is for sure a treasure!! (1)Ning Zhi now was aware of the benefit of the indicator; she could monitor Lu Jue\u2019s mood at any given time.\u201cStarting today, I will be sleeping in the bed.\u201d Ning Zhi looked into Lu Jue\u2019s eyes, who quickly looked down. \u201cWith you.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s mouth was shut tightly and the black cloud over his head seemed to have grown a little.Did that mean he was getting more upset?Some autistic individuals did not like their territory invaded. Lu Jue, who had always been sleeping alone, found Ning Zhi\u2019s getting close to him difficult to adapt to.Ning Zhi moved her pillow and gave him most of the room. \u201cLu Jue, my body aches from sleeping on the couch. I don\u2019t sleep well at night. I want to sleep in the bed.\u201dAs such, she would not budge on this one. She insisted on sleeping on the bed even if it meant Lu Jue would be upset.Lu Jue was a handsome man. Even with the black cloud with lightning over his head he was still cute. Ning Zhi wooed him. \u201cWe will each take half of the bed. I don\u2019t move around a lot when I sleep. You won\u2019t even know that I am here.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s eyes were lowered and his aura cold. He seemed to be resisting the idea.He still didn\u2019t want to do this?Ning Zhi blinked and crawled into another bed. The bed was a little on the hard side, not as soft as the one she had in the past. She wiggled around till she was comfortable and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201dWell, if he was not used to it, she\u2019d just have to make him get used to it.Ning Zhi closed her eyes. She felt that she was being bad, like a bully who was mistreating a nice child.It was after quite a while before Ning Zhi felt the spot next to her depressed and she could hear the noise of fabric rustling.She turned and looked.Lu Jue laid down in bed and pulled the blanket over himself. He laid down flat and closed his eyes.Under the light, his eyes fluttered a little. His eyes were perfectly shaped and his eyelids thin and pretty. The black cloud with lightning above his head remained where it was.Ning Zhi found that amusing. She decided to let him be for the time being. She can always placate him tomorrow.She didn\u2019t know how much time had passed. It was serene outside the window.Lu Jue opened up his eyes. He could smell a light fragrance coming from next to him. His pretty cherry-blossom eyes glared at the ceiling blankly and he indulged himself in the fragrance. His chest was warm, somewhat ticklish. It was an odd sensation for him.He liked the fragrance.Ning Zhi did not see that the black cloud with black cloud with lightning suspended over Lin Hui\u2019s head was gone in the middle of the quiet night.The sun lifted up a corner of the dusky sky and the pieces of golden lights spilled over the window.Ning Zhi was woken up by the sound of the bathroom door closing. She opened up her eyes and saw Lu Jue returning from brushing up. A strand of his hair over his forehead stuck out randomly, making him seem silly.Lu Jue walked over to his closet and opened it up.Ning Zhi looked over and saw an entire closet full of red clothing with one or two yellow ones among them. Her eyes hurt from that.Ning Zhi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dExactly how much did he love red?Nevertheless, she must admit that red looked very good on Lu Jue. His skin was fair and red was a good color for him.Lu Jue started unbuttoning his sleepwear with his head lowered.His fingers were slender and long. When he was slowly unbuttoning his shirt along with his clear and handsome face, he was surely pleasing to the eyes.Lu Jue was topless after he had his sleepwear removed.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes beamed and she wasn\u2019t groggy anymore.Lu Jue looked skinny but he was well-built underneath.She could see hints of defined muscles even from the side.Lu Jue pulled out a red shirt and pulled it through over his head.Ning Zhi was not ashamed of her peeking action at all. Not only do men like looking at pretty women with curvy bodies, women enjoyed appreciate men\u2019s bodies as well. Lu Jue was both handsome and well-built. She couldn\u2019t have been more pleased.Ning Zhi was fully indulging herself when, all of a sudden, Lu Jue pulled down his pants. Her eyes followed him and what she saw, covered under the black fabric, was too shocking. She quickly looked away.It was too early in the morning for something of this magnitude!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - This man is for sure a treasure!! (2)Mother Lu was up early. Ning Zhi found her sitting on the couch when she walked down stairs.Mother Lu was an elegant woman. Her curly hair was impeccable and she had a fiery red gem ring on her well-maintained hand, and a glowing, emperor green bracelet on her wrist. She has the temperament of a model upper-class woman.She was very different than the mother who was frantic about her child yesterday.Ning Zhi walked over but did not see Lu Jue in the living room.Ning Zhi quickly got into her role. Sitting on the couch kitty corner to Mother Lu, she said, \u201cGood morning, Mom.\u201d\u201cOh, you are up. Aunty Hua is preparing breakfast. It will be ready shortly.\u201d Mother Lu was much friendlier toward Ning Zhi after what happened the day before.Ning Zhi only had two days left to live. Her time was running out. She must stepped up her game in wooing Lu Jue.As she was thinking about that, she got up from where she was sitting and sat down next to Mother Lu affectionately. \u201cMom, I want to ask you something.\u201dNing Zhi had always been pretty and a sweet talker since she was a child and had always been popular among the elderlies. As such, she was not intimidated to interact with the elderlies.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mother Lu put down the cup in her hand and was surprised at the way that Ning Zhi was behaving today. She was normally cold and quiet as though she really hated the Lu family. She had never tried to get close to her like this before.\u201cI want to ask about Lu Jue\u2019s preference. What does he like to eat? I want to make something for him.\u201d She knew nothing about Lu Jue\u2019s preference and asking Mother Lu was her only option.Mother Lu was even more surprised after hearing what Ning Zhi had said. She couldn't help but looked over at her. Ning Zhi was smiling at her, looking serious. She was not joking.She had picked Ning Zhi to marry into the Lu family not only because she was able to get close to Lu Jue, but also because she was very pretty and the two of them made a good-looking couple. Their future children would for sure be very attractive.Nevertheless, ever since she had married into the family, not only did she look more and more ordinary, she also did not play her part as a wife. She was cold to Lu Jue day in and day out. Truth be told, Mother Lu was quite disappointed in Ning Zhi.\u201cWhy did you want to make him food all of a sudden?\u201d Mother Lu watched Ning Zhi closely to capture every expression that she may have. \u201cThe Lu family has many chefs. You don\u2019t need to go into the kitchen.\u201dNing Zhi was an observant one. Naturally, she was aware of Mother Lu\u2019s feelings toward her.She did not give up. Instead, she said, a little shy, \u201cLu Jue was upset at me last night. I want to make him something myself to placate him.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t lying. The little silly thing was very angry at her sleeping in his bed. She did, however, noticed that the black cloud with lightning above his head had disappeared this morning. He had somehow placated himself.How cute was that?Mother Lu studied Ning Zhi carefully. It didn\u2019t look like she was lying to her.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Lu Jue likes sweets,\u201d said Ning Zhi in a low voice.Hearing that, Mother Lu started to smile. \u201cHe likes sweets but he can\u2019t have too much of it.\u201dRegardless of what her intention was, Mother Lu was happy to see that Ning Zhi was willing to try and get close to Lu Jue and spend time on him.Ning Zhi smiled and said, \u201cOh good. I know how to make this one kind of desserts. I will make sure it\u2019s not too overly sweet.\u201dMother Lu nodded. \u201cThere are many things that Xiao Jue can\u2019t have and need to watch out for. Just check with Chef Li before you start. He was the one responsible for Xiao Jue\u2019s everyday diet.\u201dNing Zhi smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019ll go talk to Chef Li then.\u201dThat was when Lu Jue, in his red shirt, walked in from the outside. It was early spring and the morning was still chilly. Nevertheless, there were beads of sweat on his forehead.\u201cOh, look at you. You\u2019ve sweat so much. Hurry up and go change upstairs. You don\u2019t want to catch a cold.\u201d Mother Lu walked up anxiously when she saw that Lu Jue had returned from his morning exercise.Lu Jue did not react to Mother Lu\u2019s kind words toward hi but walked upstairs by himself.Seemingly used to it, Mother Lu looked at the back of her son until he was out of sight before she returned to her seat.Ning Zhi looked away from her. Even with autism, all mothers love their children.She suddenly recalled what Overlord had told her. It had told her that Lu Jue\u2019s autism was treatable. She wondered if it was right about that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - This man is for sure a treasure!! (3)Ning Zhi found Lu Jue inside the study.Lu Jue was sitting in front of the monitor in his red sweater, keying away, focused. Ning Zhi noticed that Lu Jue\u2019s face was not the only attractive part about him. Even his hands were pretty. His fingers were slender and long and his knuckles defined.His screen was covered in codes and just one quick look was enough for her to know that it was nothing that would be able to comprehend.In her memory, Lu Jue didn\u2019t like interaction with others but loved working on the computer. The original owner didn\u2019t know much about Lu Jue but she knew that Lu Jue was involved in the research and development of his company\u2019s products. He had worked out of the Lu Corporation\u2019s office in the past and had his own office there.He had, however, refused to go out anymore since his autism had worsened.For the sake of appeasing Lu Jue, Ning Zhi put a lot of work into making some rose cakes. Small, delicate, shape of petals, translucent with rose jam in the middle. They were sweet and soft.Picture : Rose CakesSource : openrice.comIt was the only dessert that she knew how to make.Lu Jue stared at the computer screen expressionlessly and did not react to her being in the room.Ning Zhi had a lot of patience. She got close to Lu Jue and her voice low and soft, very melodious. \u201cLu Jue, I\u2019ve made you some desserts. Would you like to try some?\u201dThe hands that were typing away stopped.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward. She was right about one thing. Lu Jue likes soft whispering next to his ear. Lu Jue would only respond when she whispered into his ear.\u201cTry. Me?\u201d Came Lu Jue\u2019s low and dull voice. His eyes that were lowered fluttered.She would have misunderstood him completely had she not looked up online on the ways of how autistic people talk!\u201cYes, you can try them.\u201d Ning Zhi picked up a piece of rose cake with a small, silver spoon and held it in front of Lu Jue. \u201cWould you like to eat by yourself or you like me to feed them to you?\u201dLu Jue kept his mouth shut and only said after a long while, \u201cMyself. Myself.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ning Zhi placed the little silver fork into his hand. When she withdrew her hand, she purposefully and devilishly scratched his palm with the tip of her finger.Yup. She was taking advantage of the fact that he was docile, silly, and would not fight back.Lu Jue kept his lips shut even tighter.Ning Zhi tried not to laugh. \u201cHurry up and try some.\u201dLu Jue quietly placed a small piece of rose cake into his mouth.The rose cake was shiny, clear, and soft. The rose jam in the middle was sweet but not overly so. When chewed, it would fill one\u2019s mouth with the fragrance of roses.Ning Zhi asked him with anticipation, \u201cDo you like them?\u201dLu Jue remained silent.Ning Zhi leaned closer to him and asked in a low voice. \u201cLu Jue, do you like them?\u201d She reached out her fingertip and wiped away the rose jam from the corner of his mouth.Lu Jue was stunned.All of a sudden, Ning Zhi saw a little sun in the indicator over his head.The little sun was illuminating a golden color!It was tiny, like an icon that one would see in the weather forecast, except cuter. If it has a physical form, Ning Zhi would reach out and poke it.Was it because her dessert was tasty and Lu Jue was very pleased with them?She summoned Overlord quickly. \u201cHow do I collect the little sun?\u201dOverlord was as excited as she was. [Host, you just need to touch Lu Jue and the little sun will become yours. You can store it or you can use it to exchange for the halo that Lin Tiantian had stolen from you.]\u201cSwitch for halo!\u201d She only had one day left and she must get her halo back. Unfortunately, one little sun could only get her 1% of her halo.After that, Ning Zhi leaned close to Ning Zhi and continued talking into his ear in a soft voice. Her voice even has a sweet taste to it. \u201cIf you like that, I can make it more often.\u201d When she was done talking, her lips even touched the tip of Lu Jue\u2019s ear slightly.All of a sudden, another little sun appeared.One sun had turned into two!Ning Zhi tried to calm herself from leaping up in joy. It looked like Lu Jue really loved her rose cake.\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d She touched the tip of his ear again gently.Instantly, the two suns appeared in her mind.Ning Zhi curved her lips and handed the suns over to Overlord. \u201cI\u2019ll want to exchange that for 2% of my halo.\u201dOverlord, receiving the little suns, was even more excited than Ning Zhi. Its milky voice trembled. [Yes, Host.]Ning Zhi walked in front of the mirror and stared intently at her own image.In a split second, her skin seemed to become more alabaster and her eyes more lively. They were no longer listless like they were before.Ning Zhi looked at her hair. There were even less split ends.It worked!She wouldn\u2019t stop looking at herself in the mirror. She only wished that she could take all of her halo at once.She spent quite a while making sure that there were no other changes before she gave up.She returned to the study and looked over at Lu Jue who was sitting there eating the dessert quietly. His eyes were fluttering and the tips of his ears pink. This man could let her regain her beauty and keep her alive at the same time. What kind of a treasure was him?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - She is a very protective person. He should not have called Lu Jue a fool. (1)Ning Zhi ran into Lin Tiantian downstairs after she left the study.She had on a bright yellow dress. Now that she has alabaster skin, she could totally pull off a color like that.In her memory, Lin Tiantian had alabaster skin even before she had stolen Ning Zhi\u2019s halo. But it was the smooth, glowing, and flawless.Halo was a great thing.That was why Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t just want to steal the halo; she wanted to steal all of it.\u201cXiao Zhi.\u201d Lin Tiantian looked at Ning Zhi\u2019s hands, saw her carrying a white ceramic plate and said, \u201cI heard from the servants that you had made some food for Lu Jue?\u201d\u201cAnd the problem of that being?\u201d Ning Zhi looked up and down Lin Tiantian. She had just recollected 2% of her halo but Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t seem to notice at all.\u201cIs something going on with you the last couple of days? I feel that they way you treat Lu Jue had changed.\u201d As was the way that Ning Zhi was looking at her. She was not able to read the new Ning Zhi.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed too,\u201d said Ning Zhi with a smile as she got closer to Lin Tiantian. \u201cI noticed that you looked a little darker today.\u201dShe had gotten a little bit of her halo back, meaning that Lin Tiantian had that much less. It was just that the changes were too minor for Lin Tiantian to tell so far.The smile on Lin Tiantian lessened. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Xiao Zhi.\u201d She told Ning Zhi mildly, \u201cA renowned skincare product company reached out to my agent yesterday asking for me to be their spoke person.\u201dShe was trying to faceslap Ning Zhi with her true ability.Had Ning Zhi not been looking into the mirror lately? Had she not noticed the difference in appearances between the two of them?Ning Zhi smiled.Looking at Lin Tiantian\u2019s dubious look, Ning Zhi said to her, \u201cI suddenly remember a joke. A thief went over the original owner and bragged about how pretty and useful the stolen item was and even laughed at the owner for being stupid not able to guard their own treasure.Lin Tiantian, \u201cAre you trying to be funny?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d said Ning Zhi while giving Lin Tiantian a deep and meaningful look. \u201cIt\u2019s a true story.\u201dLin Tiantian felt that there was subtext in Ning Zhi\u2019s words.Watching Ning Zhi left, she stroked the pendant that she wore around her neck and the warm feel calmed her worried heart.***Ning Zhi was a junior in university. Per the original owner\u2019s request, the Lu family did not announce the fact that Lu Jue and her had gotten married overseas six months ago. Nobody at school knew that she had married into the Lu family.School load was light as a junior in college. Ning Zhi was only glad that original owner\u2019s major was the same as hers before she had transmigrated over. She found the curriculum quite cozy after an afternoon of classes.The chauffeur from the Lu family was already waiting at the entrance of the university when it let out.The black luxurious car attracted much attention even just parked there silently.Ning Zhi got inside of the car and asked the chauffeur, \u201cUncle Chen, was everything alright with Lu Jue today?\u201dShe knew full well that Mother Lu would have given her a call if something had happened to Lu Jue but she still decided to ask. After all, one needed to pay attention to details when making changes.Uncle Chen was a little surprised at Ning Zhi asking about Second Young Sir. In addition, she seemed to be more outgoing than she was before. \u201cYoung Sir Lu Jue was doing well today.\u201dWhen they drove past a dessert place, Ning Zhi had Uncle Chen pulled over.When she returned to the car, she had two delicate boxes with her.They had guest at the Lu\u2019s residence today. Mother Lu has a young sister and she was visiting with her youngest son.Song Ruo, Mother Lu\u2019s sister, was a little surprised when Ning Zhi greeted them with poise. After Ning Zhi had gone upstairs, she asked Mother Lu with a smile, \u201cDid you give her little daughter-in-law some training?\u201dSong Ya took a sip of tea. \u201cDo I look like the kind who\u2019d have rules for my daughter-in-law to follow?\u201d\u201cI know you are not that kind of a person.\u201dSong Ya and Song Ruo had always been closed. She wasn\u2019t worried about Song Ruo\u2019s thought on this. \u201cYou know the situation when Ning Zhi married into my family. I have an agreement with her elders. If Xiao Jue doesn\u2019t get better within two years and they don\u2019t have any children, Ning Zhi is welcome to leave.\u201dSong Ruo disagreed. \u201cNing Zhi is lucky to be able to marry into the Lu family. How else would an orphan like her be able to marry into the Lu family? Not even the slightest chance.\u201d\u201cHer intention of marrying into the Lu family was never pure. Besides, Xiao Jue\u2019s autism is getting worse as time goes on. Her heart doesn\u2019t lie with us. What is the point of forcing her to stay?\u201dMother Lu was well aware of her son\u2019s situation all along. Having Ning Zhi married her was her only hope. And it is her wild hope that Ning Zhi might have a child with her son.It had already been six months and, not only did Lu Jue\u2019s autism not getting better, Ning Zhi also disliked her son. Never mind about having a child between them. The two of them didn\u2019t even share the same bed.She had tried to pressure Ning Zhi some but that didn\u2019t work. It was, after all, matters between Ning Zhi and Lu Jue. They would not have children if one party was unwilling.Song Ya signed. \u201cIf Xiao Jue\u2019s illness gets worse, we can\u2019t just have Ning Zhi wastes her entire life at the Lu family.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - She is a very protective person. He should not have called Lu Jue a fool. (2)Song Ruo knew that her sister liked to put up a front and appeared to be high and mighty but she was really a very reasonable person. \u201cIf every mother-in-law in the prominent families is as reasonable as you, all of the daughters-in-law will be very lucky.\u201dNing Zhi had no idea that Mother Lu was talking about her. She walked upstairs and into the study with the little box.She had noticed in the past two days that Lu Jue would always do the same thing at the same time. For example, he would always be on his computer at this time.\u201cTyrannosaur rex, we can\u2019t play with dimwits. It\u2019d make us stupid.\u201d The door to the study was not shut completely and she could hear a little boy\u2019s milky voice coming from the inside.\u201cA dimwit who can\u2019t talk.\u201d\u201cA dimwit who nobody likes.\u201d\u201cA dimwit whose foolish, foolish, foolish.\u201d\u201cA dimwit who\u2019s stupid, stupid, stupid.\u201dShe walked inside and saw a slightly chubby boy standing in front of Lu Jue\u2019s desk. He had in his hand a green tyrannosaur rex. His chubby face was filled with his contempt toward Lu Jue.\u201cWho are you calling a dimwit just now?\u201d This little boy was Song Yu\u2019s son, Lu Jue\u2019s cousin.The little boy\u2019s name is Zhigao. And he was a smart one. He knew that what he was saying to Lu Jue was nowhere close to nice. Now that he was asked by an adult, he didn\u2019t want to tell the truth.Ning Zhi put on a mean look, \u201cYour name is coconut pudding?* You just said that a dimwit can\u2019t talk. If you don\u2019t answer me, I am going to assume that you are a dimwit.\u201dZhigao pouted and said in his milky voice, \u201cI am not. He is.\u201d His pointed at Lu Jue with his little finger.Lu Jue, sitting on front of the monitor in his red sweater, did not react at all. He clicked away on his keyboard. The light off of the monitor reflected on his cold and fair face, making him seem particularly handsome.Ning Zhi smacked away Ye Zhigao\u2019s little hand that was pointing at Lu Jue and said, \u201cA child should not be so rude or spew nonsense. He\u2019s your [older] cousin.\u201d If Lu Jue is a dimwit, then what was she as his wife?Hugging the tyrannosaur rex, Ye Zhigao told Ning Zhi, \u201cEverybody says that he\u2019s a dimwit. He is just like the dimwit in my class. He doesn\u2019t talk and nobody wants to be his friend.\u201dNing Zhi felt that this child was not cute at all.Walking over to the bookshelf, she pulled down a Rubik\u2019s cube that was on there.Ning Zhi purposefully messed it up and asked Ye Zhigao, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201dThe little kiddo nodded. \u201cRubik's cube. Our teacher had shown it to us before.\u201dThe teacher at the kindergarten had taught them how to play with one.Ning Zhi placed it in front of Lu Jue. She leaned into his ear and said tenderly to him, \u201cLu Jue, can you please return this to it\u2019s original state for me?\u201dThe hands that were typing away stopped. Lu Jue, his thin lips shut slightly, took the Rubik's cube away from Ning Zhi.The next second, before Ning Zhi and Ye Zhigao even figured out what was going on other than seeing the afterimage of Lu Jue\u2019s hands, the Rubik's cube had been restored to its original state in less than 20 seconds.Lu Jue said in a low voice. \u201cHere\u2019s your Rubik's cube back.\u201dThe Rubik's cube had been restored. Take it.Ning Zhi was shocked. She saw the Rubik's cube on the shelf and knew for sure that Lu Jue knew how to work it. She didn\u2019t think he was a master in it.After she had recollected herself, she saw Ye Zhigao\u2019s little mouth dropped open from surprise.Ning Zhi, towering over him, asked him with complacency, \u201cIs your teacher that good with the Rubik's cube?\u201dYe Zhigao shook his head.\u201cYou saw how your cousin is mightier than your teacher. So how is he a dimwit?\u201d Ning Zhi said to the little kiddo. \u201cYour cousin doesn\u2019t like to talk not because he is foolish but that he was too smart and doesn\u2019t like to talk to fools.\u201cHe isn\u2019t talking to you because he finds you stupid.\u201dYe Zhigao pouted. \u201cI am not stupid.\u201d\u201cSee? You feel bad when someone calls you stupid, right?\u201d Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t help herself but pinched his chubby little cheek. \u201cYour cousin will feel bad too when you call him stupid.\u201dYe Zhigao lowered his head.Ning Zhi went and locked the door to the study.Then, she opened up the two boxes that she brought back from the dessert shop. There were delicate cakes in them.Sweet aroma from the pastries filled the study and Ye Zhigao was immediately distracted by the desserts.Ning Zhi placed one of them in front of Lu Jue and told him, \u201cI went passed this dessert shop after school and saw a long line outside. I bought it just for you.\u201dShe had to go to school today and didn\u2019t have to time make him food herself. She wasn\u2019t sure if store-bought food could make him happy and allow her to collect little suns.Lu Jue glanced over at her quickly.\u201cHurry up and eat.\u201d Ning Zhi placed a tiny fork in his hand.Lu Jue ate quietly.The little guy standing across from them gulped. His pair of big and black eyes were glued to the cakes.Ning Zhi smiled again. \u201cThis dessert shop is very well-known. Their cream is sweet and had a rich chocolate taste. And then there are these crispy fruits\u2026\u201dThe little kiddo gulped again. His chubby little hand held on tight to the tyrannosaur rex. He wanted the cake so badly; he was sure his tyrannosaur rex wanted some too.Ning Zhi picked up a small piece with her fork and waved it in front of Ye Zhigao. \u201cDoes it smell good?\u201dThe little kiddo nodded honestly. \u201cYes.\u201dNing Zhi, like a devil, said to him, \u201cYou still can\u2019t have any.\u201dYe Zhigao, with his tyrannosaur clutched in his hand, was stunned.\u201cAre you going to cry?\u201d She asked him.Ye Zhigao kept his lips tightly shut.Ning Zhi was eviler than the society. She said to him, \u201cYou still can\u2019t have any even if you cry.\u201dShe was a very protective person. He should not have called Lu Jue a fool.___Translator's notes:\u201cCoconut pudding\u201d somewhat rhymes with his name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - That was Lu Jue. No, that was Lu Jue when he was young! (1)The faint, sweet aroma from the cake filled the study.Ning Zhi looked above Lu Jue\u2019s head by the indicator was empty. There were no little suns inside of it.She walked over to Lu Jue and whispered into his ear. \u201cI stood in line for a long time. So long that my legs were hurting.\u201d She lied to him. There were a lot of people inside the dessert shop but there was no line.Ning Zhi lied and wooed him. \u201cLu Jue, if you like this. I can go stand in line and get them for you every day.\u201dShe stared intensely at the indicator over Lu Jue\u2019s head and there was still nothing.Did he not like it? Or was the cake not good?Was he not happy at all for the trouble that she had gone through to get him the cake?Lu Jue shook his head. \u201cNo like. No stand in line.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like it and he didn\u2019t want her to stand in line.Ning Zhi understood what he meant. It looked like she would not be able to get any little suns from him this time.She looked over at the little kiddo with his lips stuck way out and clutching tightly to his tyrannosaur rex. \u201cCome over here, Coconut Cake.\u201dYe Zhigao sniffled and his two little feet stepped over one another but he didn\u2019t move.Ning Zhi found this comical. The little kiddo has a temper. \u201cDo you want some cake?\u201dYe Zhigao walked over with the tyrannosaur rex in his hand. In his milky voice, he said righteously, \u201cIt isn\u2019t me who wants to have cake. It\u2019s tyrannosaur rex who does.\u201d\u201cI will give you some if you apologize to your cousin.\u201dNing Zhi reached out again and pinched him on his meaty cheek. \u201cAnd, you have to promise that you will not go around calling people idiots. Let it be your cousin, or your classmate. If I ever find out, I will tie you up, put 10 cakes in front of you so you can only see them but not eat them.\u201dNing Zhi was very evil. \u201cOh, and you have to throw away your tyrannosaur rex.\u201dYe Zhigao quickly gripped tightly onto his tyrannosaur rex. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t throw little rexie away.\u201dHe pouted a little and then said to Lu Jue in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201cAren\u2019t you a boy? You said it so softly that I am not able to feel your sincerity at all.\u201dYe Zhigao felt wronged. Still sounding milky, he raised his voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t call you an idiot again.Ning Zhi handed over to him the cake that was untouched. \u201cHere.\u201dThe little kiddo\u2019s black, round eyes lit up.Ning Zhi leaned closer to Lu Jue and wanted recognition for her accomplishment. \u201cCoconut Cake was mean to you and I have taught hi ma lesson for you.\u201d Seeing that his lips seemed a little dry, she put the glass of water next to him into his hand. \u201cFrom now on, anyone who dares to be mean to you will be taught a lesson by me.\u201dShe touched Lu Jue\u2019s hand. The tips of his fingers were cold.Ning Zhi looked up before she gotten a respond from Lu Jue and, suddenly, she saw a little sun over the head of Ye Zhigao, who was happily working away on the cake. There were no indicator, just the little sun.It was tiny and not as bright as Lu Jue\u2019s.What was going on?Surprised, she quickly asked the Overlord. \u201cHow come I could see that there is a little sun over Coconut Cake\u2019s head?\u201dOverlord: [Through physical contact with Lu Jue, you will be able to see the little sun of others when they are happy.]Ning Zhi was surprised. \u201cI will be able to other\u2019s emotions if I am touching Lu Jue? Just like I could see Lu Jue\u2019s?\u201dOverlord: [Not everyone has little suns. It all comes down to fate.]Looking at the little kiddo who was happily eating away, Ning Zhi had a happy look on her. It was much easier to woo Coconut Cake than Lu Jue.She asked Overlord, \u201cDoes that mean I can have an unlimited supply of little suns if I can woo Coconut Cake? Will I be able to get my halo back quickly?\u201dNing Zhi\u2019s great idea was interrupted by Overlord right away: [Host, with the exception of Lu Jue, all the others only have one little sun.]Ning Zhi sighed. Sure enough, Lu Jue was the best tool.\u201cIs it tasty?\u201d Ning Zhi rubbed Ye Zhigao on his head tenderly.Ye Zhigao nodded his head docilely. \u201cYes. And tyrannosaur rex said so too.\u201dLooking at the little sun that\u2019s in her head now, Ning Zhi\u2019s smile became more tender. It wasn\u2019t as bright as Lu Jue\u2019s sun, but it could still get her back 1% of her halo.That evening, Song Rou and Ye Zhigao stayed at the Lu\u2019s residence for dinner.Ning Zhi accompanied Lu Jue to the dining room and she only sat down next to him after he had sat down at his usual spot.Over dinner, Song Ruo observed the way that Ning Zhi was eating. She noticed that Ning Zhi\u2019s mannerism and etiquette were impeccable, as though she had been raised that way for a long, long time.Words had it that she was from a well-off family before her parents passed away?Naturally, Ning Zhi noticed that she was being studied. That didn\u2019t bother her. In fact, she was eating heartily. She planning to exchange the little sun for her halo later.With a lout BAM! A bowl fell and shattered on the floor instantly and rice went flying all over.Ning Zhi quickly looked over at Lu Jue.His lips were shut tight and, his head lowered, he was smacking it against the dining table.\u201cXiao Jue.\u201d Mother Lu\u2019s face turned pale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - That was Lu Jue. No, that was Lu Jue when he was young! (2)Ning Zhi quickly put down her chopsticks and reached out to Lu Jue.Lu Jue pushed her away and, unprepared, she felt a few steps backward.Ning Zhi was baffled.Lu Jue had always been quiet and docile. But it was difficult for him to control himself when he had one of his episodes.\u201cWuuu\u2026\u201d Ye Zhigao, sitting across from him, stared to cry. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201dSong Ruo quickly put her arms around her son\u2019s head so he wouldn\u2019t be able to see Lu Jue during his episode.Mother Lu\u2019s eyes reddened. She wanted to have the servants to go and force stop Lu Jue from banging his head against the table.Ning Zhi went up to Lu Jue again and put her hand in front of him. \u201cLu Jue, I almost fell onto the ground when you pushed me.\u201dLu Jue stopped.\u201cBut I know you didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d Ning Zhi touched Lu Jue\u2019s forehead. It was already bright red in color.Lu Jue\u2019s eyes lowered and he said all of a sudden, \u201cBleeding.\u201dHuh?Ning Zhi looked down. She had stepped on the broken fragments and her foot was now bleeding.Lu Jue held Ning Zhi\u2019s hand and he repeated. \u201cBleeding.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I am bleeding. Can you accompany me into the bedroom to put some medication over it?\u201dLu Jue stood up. \u201cSure. Go.\u201dMother Gu quickly had someone brought some medication upstairs.Inside the room, Ning Zhi carefully applied the medication. She never liked pain. All of her attention was on Lu Jue earlier so it was just now that she started feeling the cut.Lu Jue stood in front of her in a daze. Watching Ning Zhi carefully cleaning her wound, he said, \u201cSorry.\u201dNing Zhi looked up in surprise.Lu Jue\u2019s eye lips fluttered as he looked down, as though he was feeling bad.The dining room table had already been cleaned up. Ye Zhigao, crying from being frightened, was taken home by Song Ruo.Ning Zhi saw Mother Lu sitting on the couch with reddened eyes when she went downstairs.\u201cHow\u2019s Xiao Jue doing?\u201d Mother Lu still looked worried.Ning Zhi sat down next to her. \u201cHe\u2019s alright. He\u2019s now reading in the study.\u201dMother Lu nodded. What she said next, however, made one\u2019s heart ached. \u201cEver since he was a child, I have always been worried. When he was a child, he rolled down the stairs one time without the teachers noticing. He suffered a few fractured ribs from that fall.\u201dShe looked at Ning Zhi and carried on. \u201cA normal child would start bawling but Xiao Jue didn\u2019t make a sound. It was until he was running a fever that night and was taken to the hospital did I learn about that.\u201dSome autistic patients cannot feel pain. That is because their cerebral cortex are not able to receive the signals.It is dangerous for a person to not be able to feel pain.Ning Zhi listened to Mother Lu quietly.\u201cEver since he had rolled off the stairs, he resented being touched even more. Normal children will be coquettish to their parents but Xiao Jue only likes to sit around and zone out on his own. He is unlike a normal child who enjoys being around their parents\u2026\u201dNing Zhi could picture little Lu Jue sitting in a corner by himself.Mother Lu\u2019s voice was filled with self-blame. \u201cIt was my fault. I didn\u2019t have enough people around watching out for Xiao Jue. Ever since the kidnapping, Xiao Jue had become quieter and withdrawn completely. Now he loses control of himself easily whenever he is stimulated or if there is anything out of the ordinary.\u201dWhen they brought Lu Jue home, he was covered in bruises and injuries.Mother Lu couldn\u2019t imagine how he was tortured by the bad guys.It was getting late in the night.After talking to Mother Lu, Lu Jue had already showered when Ning Zhi returned to the bedroom, still in his bright red pajama.His bangs were wet and stuck to his forehead. He seemed docile and his delicate brows and eyes looked a little childish.Ning Zhi walked over to the bed and then laid down on it.Lu Jue kept his mouth shut and looked at her without making a sound, obviously still didn\u2019t like her sleeping in his bed.\u201cI\u2019m injured.\u201d Ning Zhi lifted her foot with the band-aid. \u201cI want to sleep in the bed.\u201dAfter a long while, there was no black cloud with lighting appearing in his indicator.Pleased, Ning Zhi pulled her let back.Lu Jue ignored Ning Zhi, laid down straight in bed, and closed his eyes.Ning Zhi did not fall asleep right away. She asked Overlord, \u201cYou mentioned before that Lu Jue\u2019s autism can be cured. Is that true?\u201dOverlord: [Host, I do not lie.]\u201cHow will we cure him?\u201dThe frequency of Lu Jue\u2019s episodes had been increasing. At this rate, it would become more and more difficult to collect little suns. As a matter of fact, he just might hurt himself to a point that he would die from self-inflicted injuries before she was able to collect enough little suns.After all, Lu Jue died from self-inflicted injury in the novel.Overlord: [There is a reason why Lu Jue\u2019s autism is getting worse. You will be able to cure him using the little suns.]Ning Zhi hesitated, \u201cI have to use the little suns to save Lu Jue?\u201d[That\u2019s correct. You have one little sun right now. Do you want to use it to help Lu Jue or to get back 1% of your halo?]Ning Zhi turned her head and looked at Lu Jue, whose eyes were shut tightly. \u201cI choose Lu Jue.\u201dAs soon as she finished saying that, it went dark in front of her.When she opened up her eyes again, Ning Zhi found herself standing inside the living room.Wasn\u2019t she lying in bed just a moment ago? Did Overland have the ability to move her to a different location instantly?Mother Lu walked over. She had on a delicate dress and she looked young.\u201cMom.\u201d Ning Zhi greeted her but Mother Lu walked right passed her as though she couldn\u2019t see her.Ning Zhi called out to her again and, once again, gotten no response.Mother Lu walked over to the stairs and bent down. That was when Ning Zhi noticed a little boy sitting next to the stairs and quietly putting together a puzzle on the floor.\u201cWould you like Mommy to pick you up?\u201d Mother Lu reached over and picked the child up.Ning Zhi was shocked.That was Lu Jue. No, that was Lu Jue when he was young!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thank you for helping me meet my Ko-fi Goal #6. =)Fringecapybara Hall of Fame___As it turned out, Lu Jue liked red color clothing since he was a child.He had on a little red shirt with a denim overalls. It had a large pocket in the front of it. Little Lu Jue was cute with delicate features, his little face was alabaster colored and smooth. With his face long, he was cute and cool and, in fact, so cute that it could make one\u2019s heart shuddered.The little kiddo was picked up by his mother. He was a little dazed and, after being carried by Mother Lu for a little while, starting struggling and did not wish to be carried any longer.Ning Zhi finally realized that Mother Lu didn\u2019t seem young because she dressed young; this was when she was young.It seemed that Overlord had sent her back to when Lu Jue was young.Ning Zhi asked Overlord, \u201cAm I really back to when Lu Jue was young?\u201dShe did not hear a response back from Overlord after a long while.She tried repeatedly to communicate with Overlord but heard nothing back.Ning Zhi frowned. What was going on?Mother Lu carried little Lu Jue over to the couch. The servant brought over a plateful of strawberries that had already been rinsed. Each of them was glistening from the water droplets and looked very appealing.Mother Lu picked up a large strawberry and put in in little Lu Jue\u2019s little hand.Ning Zhi was sure by now that nobody could see her. She walked over in front of the couch and watched as little Lu Jue, holding a strawberry that was bigger than his fist, chomped down on it quietly.The juice from the strawberry stained his lips. His pair of round black eyes were clear and pretty. Sitting there docilely, Ning Zhi\u2019s little heart shuddered from his cuteness.Mother Lu, too, was obviously touched by her son\u2019s cuteness as well. She wanted to lean down and kiss him on his cheek but little Lu Jue avoided her.Mother Lu sighed and resorted to stroking him on his little head.Ning Zhi rested her chin on her palm. Bored, she stared blankly at little Lu Jue as he ate his strawberries quietly. Overlord told her that she could cure Lu Jue. But what was the meaning behind sending her here?Across from her, little Lu Jue stopped eating after two large strawberries.He got off the couch and walked over to the bathroom to wash his hands by himself. Mother Lu did not follow behind him. She had taught him to be independent since a very long time ago.Ning Zhi stood up and followed boldly behind little Lu Jue.Little Lu Jue walked on his two little legs, his back straight. Walking inside, Ning Zhi wanted to laugh when she saw a cute little stool that was almost up to her thighs.The adult Lu Jue was very tall and she need to lift her head in order to look at him. And now, she was lowering her head to look at him. That was quite interesting.Little Lu Jue walked inside of the bathroom and washed his hands after carefully standing on his tippy toes.Standing next to Lu Jue, Ning Zhi noticed a very large mirror in front of him. She glanced over it and was shocked.Her skin was alabaster colored and very smooth. Her feature delicate and her lips red. Her black eyes were clear and clean. Limpid, they looked like there were fragments of stars inside of them. The corners of her eyes curved upward just a little bit, giving her a pure but also somewhat charming look.Even her hair was smooth, black, and shiny.Ning Zhi touched herself on her cheeks. The soft and delicate touch was real.Did she get her halo back?That couldn\u2019t be right? She didn\u2019t get any little suns and was not able to exchange them for her halo.Ning Zhi narrowed her eyes. Or that she could regain her original look when she had departed from reality?Regardless of the reasons behind it, she was pretty now.Ning Zhi checked herself out in the mirror. The more she looked, the angrier she became. She came to realize that Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t just take away her look, but also her figure.How dare she!Now that she had recovered her figure, she top was prominent and her waist slender. Even her legs were slender and alabaster colored. She was so pretty and delicate that even her toes had a pink glow to them.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t have been happier. She looked left and right at her own body and, the more she looked, she happier she became. She only wished she could take all of her halo back from Lin Tiantian this very moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Lu Jue had once fallen down the stairs and fractured a few of his ribs. (2)Little Lu Jue, having finished up washing his little hands, turned, walked around Ning Zhi and walked outside of the bathroom.Ning Zhi was stunned. Did that mean little Lu Jue could see her? Or that it was just a coincidence?She quickly followed behind him.Little Lu Jue had short legs so it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to catch up to him.The little kiddo\u2019s cheeks were puffy and even still had some baby fat left on him. He was very different from his adult self whose features were prominent and defined.Ning Zhi rubbed her hands together and, finally, couldn\u2019t help herself but reached out her finger and poked Lu Jue on his alabaster and tender cheek. Immediately, a little dimple appeared on his little cheek.Oh! So, she could touch him!Ning Zhi was very emotional. She pinched little Lu Jue\u2019s face and it was soft and tender. She really could touch him.\u201cLittle Juejue, can you see me?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.Little Lu Jue looked up and at looked blankly at Ning Zhi with his defined eyes. Then, lifting up his little hand, he smacked away Ning Zhi\u2019s hand that was pinching him.The little kiddo didn\u2019t have a lot of strength and Ning Zhi didn\u2019t feel any pain.He could see her, indeed!Ning Zhi was pleasantly surprised. \u201cYou can see me, can\u2019t you?\u201dLittle Lu Jue was quiet and cool. He paid her no attention at all.Ning Zhi tried to walk in front of Mother Lu but gotten no reaction from her. She reached out to touch Mother Lu but her hand just went right through Mother Lu\u2019s body.Ning Zhi was certainly now. Little Lu Jue was the only one who could see her and he was the only one that she could touch.Over dinner, Ning Zhi sat in the spot next to little Lu Jue.Looking at the table full of food, Ning Zhi really wanted to have some but she did not feel hunger. It was like she didn\u2019t belong to this world and was not restrained by this world either.Sitting next to Mother Lu was the handsome and authoritative Father Lu, Lu Dongzhou. Ning Zhi had always thought that Lu Jue looked like his mother. Now she suddenly felt that he looked more like Father Lu.It was obviously from the way that Father Lu looked at Mother Lu and how he would put food in her bowl that he truly loved his wife.After dinner, Ning Zhi followed little Lu Jue up to his room. She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it when she walked inside of his room.The room was still decorated in a childish way. The wall was of a sky-blue color and many toys that appealed to boys were scattered all over the room. Even the bed in the middle of the room was a kid\u2019s bed.That was a cute children room.Little Lu Jue did not like to talk but he was very independent. He had learned to bath himself a long time ago.Ning Zhi followed little Lu Jue around everywhere he went like a little tail of his. She was very curious about little Lu Jue. After all, who else had the opportunity to see what their husbands were like when they were young?Inside the bathroom, the servant had already drawn the bath water for little Lu Jue and had his pajama prepared.The servant closed the door and waited outside.Little Lu Jue took his own clothes off and, when he saw Ning Zhi standing next to the sink when he turned around, his little face dropped. His lips pressed shut; he was unhappy.\u201cBath I. No watch.\u201d Little Lu Jue\u2019s milky voice was cuter than that of Overlord\u2019s. It was crisp and child-like.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved from her smile. She teased him intentionally. \u201cOh? Call me big sister and I\u2019ll go out. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll stay and watch you bathe.\u201dLittle Lu Jue\u2019s little face was taut.Ning Zhi pinched his soft and small little cheek. \u201cC\u2019mon. Call me Big Sister and I\u2019ll leave.\u201dLittle Lu Jue lowered his head and, in his low and milky voice, said in a low voice, \u201cBig. Sister.\u201dOh! Ning Zhi could die from cuteness overload right now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Lu Jue had once fallen down the stairs and fractured a few of his ribs. (3)Ning Zhi did not bully little Lu Jue again. She left on the couch that night.She thought her back wouldn\u2019t feel very good after spending a night on the couch but she didn\u2019t feel any discomfort when she woke up the next morning.Across from her, little Lu Jue, in his red cartoon pajama woke up. He didn\u2019t need anyone to tend to him and was able to get himself ready and change. He was serious like a little adult.Mother Lu had told Ning Zhi in the past that they had detected Lu Jue\u2019s autism at a very early age and started with treatment immediately. Lu Jue, at his current age, was like a normal child in all ways other than not enjoying being closed with others or being hugged.Little Lu Jue, who had changed into his red kindergarten uniform, went downstairs on his own and the servant carried his red little book bag behind him.Ning Zhi followed behind them slowly.Ah. Her husband was about to go to kindergarten.After breakfast, Father Lu left for the office and Mother Lu took little Lu Jue to the kindergarten in person.Ning Zhi quickly hopped into the car. Her body went right through the car and she took the passenger seat. At this very moment, little Lu Jue, sitting in the back, gave her a look.Odd Big Sister.The car stopped in front of the kindergarten. As it was the morning drop off time, there were lots of cars from other families and almost all of them were luxurious cars.Apparently, this was a noble kindergarten.Mother Lu stayed until her son was taken inside of the school by a teacher before she left longingly.Ning Zhi continued to followed behind little Lu Jue. They arrived at little Lu Jue\u2019s class. The other students also arrived early and were laughing, chasing each other, and giggling inside the classroom.Unless the other children around them, little Lu Jue put down his little bookbag, sat down at his own spot and remained seated quietly. He did not make any noise nor did he look at any of his classmates around him.Ning Zhi suddenly remember Coconut Cake\u2019s words. He said there was a student in his like who, like Lu Jue, did not like to talk. All the other children called him a fool.So, what about little Lu Jue?Would the other children not feel that he was a part of them? Would they make fun of him? Would they bully him?The thought that the other children might bully little Lu Jue made Ning Zhi felt that none of them was cute.During class session, Ning Zhi did not stay inside the classroom but stood outside of the classroom and watched little Lu Jue boringly through the window. The other children would raise their hands when the teacher asked questions but little Lu Jue just stared in the air without responding to anything.There were a lot of children in the class and the teacher could not pay attention to all of them at the same time. As such, the teacher did not notice the little boy sitting next to Lu Jue had pinched him stealthily.Walking quickly inside of the classroom, Ning Zhi wanted to pull the little boy away from little Lu Jue but her hand went right through the little boy. She was not able to touch him.Ning Zhi looked as the little boy left a red mark on little Lu Jue\u2019s tender, alabaster with his fingernail. \u201cXiao Juejue. Tell the teacher quickly.\u201dLittle Lu Jue did not respond to her at all. He didn\u2019t make a sound nor did he feel any pain.Ning Zhi frowned deeply. Luckily, the little boy stopped after pinching little Lu Jue just once.She gave the little boy an unhappy stare.Two teachers took the children to exercise outside of the classroom for the next session.All of the other little kiddos ran around the playground. Some went onto the slide and others, the seesaw. Little Lu Jue, on the other hand, stood quietly next to the stairs all by his lonesome.The teachers seemed to be used to him standing around on his own by now.Ning Zhi never thought much about it in the past but when she looked at all the children who were laughing happily, then turned to look at Lu Jue, she felt her heart ached.He had a little hard self around him and he hid his little body inside of it. Nobody could enter his little shell as long as he wasn\u2019t coming out of it.After she had recollected herself, Ning Zhi noticed that little Lu Jue had already walked up the stairs. Following behind him was the little boy who pinched him in the classroom earlier.The little boy looked familiar to her. She seemed to have known him from somewhere.Before she could give it much thought, Ning Zhi saw the little boy reaching out to pull little Lu Jue from the back.The little boy was taller than little Lu Jue and, with just one tug from the little boy, little Lu Jue lose his balance and started falling backward.Ning Zhi was stunned. She suddenly recalled what Mother Lu had told her.Lu Jue had fallen down the stairs once back when he was in kindergarten and fractured a few of his ribs.___Translator\u2019s rambling:It is this translator\u2019s goal to add this series to my regular rotation starting December, if not earlier.

    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - What Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t notice was that, shortly after she had hung up the phone, Ning Zhi took back another 2% of her halo from her. (1)As little Lu Jue was falling down the stairs, Ning Zhi threw herself in his direction.The little soft body fell into her arms.The second that it landed on the ground, she had him tightly wrapped in her arms and padded his body with hers.Any normal child would have been so scared that they would be bawling when something like this happened to them, or that they would rush to an adult for comfort.Little Lu Jue, on the other hand, blinked his eyes with a dazed look and did not look like he was about to cry at all.\u201cDid you get hurt? Little Juejue?\u201d Ning Zhi didn\u2019t have time to pay attention the little boy who had run off. She quickly checked on Lu Jue. She had caught him when he was falling. He shouldn\u2019t have broken any of his ribs this time.Little Lu Jue pointed at Ning Zhi\u2019s foot with his small little finger all of a sudden as he said, \u201cRed, red.\u201dNing Zhi looked down and saw that she had sprained her ankle a little when she rushed over to save him. She had banged her knee on the stairs and it was red now.Normally, she would be tearing up from the pain when a fragile spot like her knees were hurt. But now, she didn\u2019t feel a thing. Much like she would not feel hunger in this world.\u201cI hurt my foot while saving you. It hurts.\u201d Ning Zhi lied to little Lu Jue shamelessly. \u201cFrom now on, you can\u2019t ignore me when I talk to you, okay?\u201dLittle Lu Jue quickly gave her a look with his big, black eyes and, after a long while, finally nodded.Ning Zhi couldn't help but pinched his little cheek again. Little Lu Jue was so easy to fool.Over on the other side, the teacher found little Lu Jue sitting on the ground, dazed, when she came looking for him. \u201cLu Jue, why are you sitting on the ground?\u201dLittle Lu Jue turned his head away and rested it on Ning Zhi, completely ignoring the teacher.Little Lu Jue still had the baby smell and he was still chubby and soft. It was very comfortable holding him.Ning Zhi leaned into his ears and wooed him in tender voice. \u201cBig sister\u2019s foot hurt and needs to rest up. Little Juejue needs to listen to his teacher and go with her.\u201dThe big, black eyes blinked repeatedly and little Lu Jue lowered his head to look at Ning Zhi\u2019s knee. He said in his milky voice, \u201cBlow, me.\u201dLet me blow on it.Ning Zhi couldn't help but smiled. She teased him purposefully. \u201cDoes little Juejue want big sister to blow on him?\u201dHaving said that, she lowered her head and gently blew a puff of air next to Lu Jue\u2019s ear.The puff of air went inside his ear and the tingling feeling made little Lu Jue cock his little head. He was a little anxious, \u201cBlow, me.\u201dNing Zhi must say, it was definitely much easier to communicate with little Lu Jue than adult Lu Jue, who would at most respond to every 10 times that one said to him.\u201cThank you, little Juejue but Big Sister doesn\u2019t need blowing.\u201d Little Lu Jue was too cute. Ning Zhi only wished she could give him a peck on his cheek.little Lu Jue looked up.The strange big sister slowly became transparent in front of his eyes and then disappeared.Little Lu Jue was at loss. \u201cBig. Sister?\u201dThe teacher wasn\u2019t surprised by little Lu Jue talking to himself. He was, after all, a child that suffered from autism. \u201cC\u2019mon, Lu Jue. Get up and teacher will take you back to the classroom.\u201d***When she opened up her eyes again, Ning Zhi found herself laying in bed with Lu Jue next to her. The adult Lu Jue.She was back?Ning Zhi quickly touched her own face. Her skin no longer had that delicate and smooth touch and her hands were not as alabaster as they used to be. Her hair still had split ends.She touched her own chest. They were soft but obviously smaller than they were earlier.Ning Zhi was slightly disappointed. She had hoped that she could keep her looks when she returned to reality.She reached out to Overlord quickly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like I had done anything. Why am I back already? Is he cured from his autism yet?\u201dOverlord: [Have you forgotten already, Host? You\u2019ve saved Lu Jue when he was falling down the stairs. As for his autism, of course it isn\u2019t cured yet.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - What Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t notice was that, shortly after she had hung up the phone, Ning Zhi took back another 2% of her halo from her. (2)Ning Zhi frowned, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that he could be cured with just one little sun?\u201dOverlord elaborated quickly: [You\u2019ve saved Lu Jue once and it had already lightened up some of his symptoms. When you repeat that a few more times, you will be able to see the difference.]\u201cYou mean, I have to keep on going back to save him?\u201dOverlord: [Host is so smart.]Ning Zhi had figured that it would not be easy to cure Lu Jue. After all, there is no cure for autism in real life.It was morning and bright outside.When Ning Zhi woke up, she saw Lu Jue returning from his morning jog in his red workout outfit.His baby fat was gone. Instead, his face was very well defined and his two little legs turned into large, long legs. His chubby body was now sturdy and strong and he had a cold look on him.Yup. Little Lu Jue was much cuter.When Ning Zhi headed downstairs and found Mother Lu arranging flowers in the living room, she walked over to her with a smile.Mother Lu was still dressed very elegantly today. Her appearance was important to her. Let it be her bracelet, or ring, the broach, she put effort into matching them every day. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWhen you mentioned to me last night how Lu Jue had rolled down the stairs when he was in kindergarten, what...\u201dBefore Ning Zhi could even finish her sentence, Mother Lu interrupted her and said dubiously, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you are talking about. Why would I say such a thing? Xiao Jue had never rolled down the stairs when he was a kid.\u201d\u201cBut last night, you\u2026\u201d And it dawned on Ning Zhi that now that she had saved little Lu Jue, this incident no longer existed.Ning Zhi quickly explained herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m still half asleep. That was in my dream last night.\u201dNing Zhi was curious. If her saving little Lu Jue had become reality, then would Lu Jue still remember her saving him?Then, it occurred to her that even though it had happened just last night to her, it was some 20 years ago to Lu Jue. For sure he would have forgotten about it by now.***Inside the dressing room.The agent, looking very happy, said, \u201cDirector Fang just called and told us that you are going to be the female lead in his newest movie. Tiantian, you are so lucky. The old lady that you have helped randomly turned out to be Director Fang\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201cA few actresses were fighting over this role and had been working on it since a long time ago. You just swooped in and grabbed in just like that. That\u2019s what\u2019s called winning with no effort.\u201dThe agent noticed that Lin Tiantian has always been very lucky. Opportunities that others might not get even they groveled for it would just happen upon her like that.Lin Tiantian smiled. She was used to being spoiled by heaven since she had taken away Ning Zhi\u2019s halo.Touching the necklace that she wore around her neck, she recalled her dream from the night before.Ning Zhi was still her pretty self in her dream. She shined in the entertainment circle and was doted upon after joining the Lu family.As for herself, she took on the role as Ning Zhi\u2019s contrast.In her dream, she married her first boyfriend. Her boyfriend turned into a completely different person after they had gotten married. He was fake and a player. She had tons of housework to do everyday and he still found her resentful.Everyday, she would sit down in front of the television during her free time after the housework was done and be secretly envious of Ning Zhi, who was the center of everyone\u2019s attention.When she woke up, it felt as real as she had truly gone through a life like that.Luckily, she was able to take away all of Ning Zhi\u2019s halo when this necklace came into her possession.She became prettier. She entered into the entertainment circle. She married into the Lu family. And Ning Zhi, without her beauty, had to marry the autistic Lu Jue.And now, she was Ning Zhi\u2019s subject of envy.Right then, Lin Tiantian received a call from a servant from the Lu family. She reported that Lu Jue had another episode last night and even caused Ning Zhi to injury her foot.She could only imagine how awful and gloomy Ning Zhi felt right now.Lin Tiantian said to the servant on the other end of the phone, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to report back to me about Ning Zhi anymore.\u201d Now that Ning Zhi had lost her halo, there was no more need to keep a close eye on her.What Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t notice was that, shortly after she had hung up the phone, Ning Zhi took back another 2% of her halo from her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Ning Zhi was stunned when she saw the little boy in the picture. (1)Inside the car.Ning Zhi looked at Lu Jue sitting next to her and saw the black cloud in the indicator above his head. She found that amusing.Some autistic people had their own daily routines and, when they were interrupted or interfered with, it would cause make them feel unhappy or anxiety.Lu Jue went jogging in the morning every day and would play with his puzzle, on his computer, and read at specific hours in the afternoon. It was as though they had an alarm clock set and was both rigid and boring.Being dragged out by Ning Zhi interrupted his routine and, as such, Lu Jue was unhappy right now.Ning Zhi had gotten the permission from Mother Lu before she took Lu Jue out. Mother Lu was surprised but agreed to it immediately. Lu Jue had, after all, not left the house for a long while. She wished that her son would come into contact with more people, communicate with them, and alleviate him symptoms that way.Ning Zhi was very happy that she was able to get him to leave the house.When the two left, Mother Lu sent a few bodyguards to accompany them. In fact, Mother Lu gave Ning Zhi a credit card, one of Lu Jue\u2019s secondary card.The butler reminded Ning Zhi that the card has no upper limit.Ning Zhi was a smart one. She knew that the butler had been instructed by Mother Lu to remind her.A credit card with no limit that she could spend as much as she pleased. Spending Lu Jue\u2019s money, then she needed to take good care of him.As far as Mother Lu was concerned, as long as Ning Zhi would be nice to Lu Jue, she could be nice to Ning Zhi. There was nothing more important to her than her son.Ning Zhi would never even dream about such a good thing. She would be nice to Lu Jue and woo him regardless of whether Mother Lu had asked her to do so.The car stopped in front of the mall.Ning Zhi was the first to get out of the car, followed by Lu Jue, with his lips shut tightly.He still had on his red sweat shirt with a pair of black slacks on the bottom. He was tall and his brows and eyes made him stood out. He drew a lot of attention even just standing quietly next to the car.\u201cLet\u2019s head in.\u201d Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t wait to fill up her empty closet with the card given to her from Mother Lu.There were many people at the mall entrance. Lu Jue kept his head lowered and remained quiet.Ning Zhi could see that the three little black clouds on top of him was growing like it has had some sort of catalyst.He was even more unhappy now than he was before?Lu Jue was very tall and Ning Zhi must lift her head up and stand on her tip toes before she could whisper into his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll hold your hand. All you need to do is to walk next to me.\u201dShe reached out to Lu Jue\u2019s large hand that was dangling by his side.His hand was a little bit chill and his fingers long, slender, and defined. Much like his look, they were attractive looking.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLu Jue looked at Ning Zhi\u2019s hand. It was soft. Odd to the touch, but he didn\u2019t mind it.Ning Zhi walked toward the inside of the mall while holding onto Lu Jue\u2019s hand. The few bodyguards followed behind them attracted too much attention so she had them followed them from a distance.There were a lot of people inside of the mall and Ning Zhi could feel Lu Jue\u2019s hand tightening around hers noticeably. He even scooted closer to her.The little black cloud became even bigger inside his indicator.Ning Zhi held onto his hand tightly and did not lead him into the crowd. She accepted the fact that he was different and would not try to force him to adapt to this world.She said to him in a low voice. \u201cI want many pretty dresses. Come and help me pick some out, will you?\u201d\u201cAnd I want to buy many pretty jewelries.\u201d\u201cLu Jue, what do you like?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - Ning Zhi was stunned when she saw the little boy in the picture. (2)Ning Zhi whispered into his ear tenderly. Lu Jue kept his eyes lowered and all he could hear was her voice.Feeling that the big hand started to relax and the black cloud over Lu Jue\u2019s head had disappeared, Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward. Little Lu Jue was easy to woo, as was big Lu Jue.There are many designer stores on the second floor.Ning Zhi walked into one of them with Lu Jue by her side. Knowing that it would bother Lu Jue, she had the salesperson kept their distance.There are many new designs in the shop. Ning Zhi was a little disappointed that she had yet to regain her beauty. She picked out one that she liked and was about to go try it on.\u201cI am going to go try it on. You wait for me here, okay?\u201d Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t too worried as there were bodyguards around them.Sitting on the couch, Lu Jue kept his head lowered and finally said in a low voice after a long while, \u201cMmm.\u201dEven though she looked ordinary right now, but that didn\u2019t stop Ning Zhi from liking to look pretty. She picked a white dress that had embroidery of little flowers on the hem. It was spring time right now and was perfect for wearing dresses. It would look very pretty with a jacket.Walking out of the changing room, Ning Zhi walked in front of Lu Jue. Lifting his head with her hands, she smiled and asked him, \u201cIs this pretty?\u201dLu Jue looked up. His cherry-blossom eyes were clear and pretty, but he looked at loss.Ning Zhi repeated herself, \u201cIs this pretty?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Lu Jue\u2019s face was expressionless but, for some odd reasons, Ning Zhi could sense his resentment. He truly felt that this was not pretty.What does this little nerd know?Ning Zhi taught him, \u201cYou should say \u2018yes\u2019 when I asked if whether something is pretty.\u201d\u201cNo, not pretty,\u201d said Lu Jue again in his deep voice.What could she do? Even though the little nerd was rigid and not cute, but Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t get mad at that face.Ning Zhi stopped trying clothes on. She picked a bunch of dresses and had the salesperson wrapped them all up. Then, she went over to the men\u2019s clothing shop with Lu Jue.\u201cLu Jue, will you be happy if I buy you clothes?\u201d Ning Zhi had it all figured out. She would buy gifts for Lu Jue to woo him, using his card. How wonderful was that?Ning Zhi sounded very generous. \u201cPick whatever you like.\u201dLu Jue walked quietly in front of a red shirt and quickly looked over at Ning Zhi.Sure enough, the little nerd liked red just like any other time.\u201cYou like this one? Okay, then go and try it on.\u201d Ning Zhi had the salesperson bring the red shirt over to him.Lu Jue was pushed into the changing room with Ning Zhi. \u201cYou go try it on. I\u2019ll be waiting for you out here,\u201d said Ning Zhi as she closed the door.Sitting on the couch, Ning Zhi accepted the water that was brought over to her by the salesperson. She sipped at it slowly and, looking at the door to the changing room that was closed, suddenly had an excitement of waiting for her little boyfriend to change clothes for her.After a long while, the door finally re-opened.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw Lu Jue walking out of the fitting room.The red silky shirt glowed under the light and, with the form-fitting design, it showed Lu Jue\u2019s contour clearly. His collar was opened slightly and, with his pale skin and the clear and handsome face, he had turned into a seductive demon.\u201cWow, this shirt complimented him so perfectly.\u201d The female salesperson\u2019s eyes were filled with awe. Very few men like to dress in red and, if the man doesn\u2019t have the face and body to go with it, he would only appear greasy.Ning Zhi nodded. She must admit that Lu Jue, standing in front of her, was very eye-catching.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Ning Zhi was stunned when she saw the little boy in the picture. (3)This little fool was nothing but a treasure chest. One only needed to push open a lid a tiny bit and the lights would shine out from the inside.Ning Zhi walked over to Lu Jue, reached out to his shirt, and buttoned it up for him. \u201cLu Jue, you are so good looking.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s eyelids, lowered, shuddered slightly. His lips were pressed shut tightly and a little sun popped into the indicator above his head.Ning Zhi was pleasantly surprised. Oh, so he liked compliments from her?Ning Zhi was going to dish out more compliments when Lu Jue abruptly turned and walked over to a rack of clothes. \u201cPretty.\u201dHe pointed at a very colorful, busy-looking short-sleeve shirt. Ning Zhi suspected that those styles were aimed toward middle-aged men in their 40s and 50s.\u201cPretty.\u201d Lu Jue repeated.\u201cYou like this one?\u201d Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t certain.For once, Lu Jue nodded and his lips curved upward. There was even a little dimple on one side of his cheeks!Ning Zhi was stunned!When they walked out of the boutique, Lu Jue had on the colorful shirt with large roses that he had picked out himself. Watching the second little sun popped up in the indicator, Ning Zhi suddenly felt that the shirt wasn\u2019t that bad after all.With two little suns in her inventory, Ning Zhi quickly summoned Overlord. \u201cI have two suns. I want to trade one in for 1% of my halo and use the other one to save Lu Jue.\u201dOverlord\u2019s little milky voice sounded weak: [Host, you will need 3 suns to save Lu Jue the second time.]\u201cNot just one?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.Overlord: [The more difficult the task is, the more suns you will need.]\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this before? Why do I feel that you are just making this stuff up as we go?\u201dFrightened, Overlord\u2019s little milky voice was shaky: [Because you never asked, Host.]\u201cWhat about going forward?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.Overlord: [You will need 5 little suns for the third time and 10 for the 4th.]\u201cNever mind. Shut up.\u201d Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t bear to listen to it anymore. Were they making this impossible on purpose?Ning Zhi walked back in the direction that they came from while holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand.Lu Jue looked baffled.Ning Zhi said to him with a smile, \u201cYou like bright colored and red colored clothing, right? We will buy them all. As long as that will make you happy.\u201dSpending money was such an amazing feeling, especially when one was spending someone else\u2019s money.Ning Zhi was very satisfied at the 5 little suns that she had earned in total. Unfortunately, Lu Jue stopped producing more little suns toward the end no matter how much clothes she would buy for him.Much like the rose cakes that she had made for him in the past. She received 2 little suns the first them and none in subsequent times.Ning Zhi immediately traded 2 little suns for 2% of her halo and saved the other three for Lu Jue.When she traded with Overlord, she could see her skin tone lightened up visibly. She quickly touched her own face and felt that her cheeks were much finer and smoother than it was before.Her mood improved instantly and her joy could be seen visibly.She had taken back 2% of her halo previously and had just gotten 2% more. That meant that she had already taken back a total of 4% of her halo from Lin Tiantian.Ning Zhi turned her head and, standing on her tip toes, she whispered into Lu Jue\u2019s ear, \u201cLu Jue, how are you so wonderful!\u201dBy the time they got back to the Lu\u2019s residence, it was already dark outside.Ning Zhi walked inside with Lu Jue with her and saw Father Lu sitting on the couch.Father Lu\u2019s temperament was calm, authoritative, and his face weathered by time. Nevertheless, he still looked at Mother Lu the exact same way.A stocky man with cold temperament sat kitty corner to her. She recognized him as Lu Shenyuan, the male lead and Lu family\u2019s adopted son, from her memory. He was now helping Father Lu in the management of the Lu Corporation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Ning Zhi was stunned when she saw the little boy in the picture. (4)\u201cAh, you two are back. C\u2019mon over and join us,\u201d said Mother Lu happily when she saw Ning Zhi home. \u201cXiao Jue, your dad and your big brother are back. Come say hi.\u201dFather Lu and Lu Shenyuan had been developing their business overseas before now and had just flown back today.Father Lu didn\u2019t say anything when he saw the clothes that Lu Jue was wearing but he couldn't help but looked disappointed. \u201cYou two went out today?\u201dNing Zhi, holding onto Lu Jue\u2019s hand, walked over and sat down on the couch. \u201cYes, I took Lu Jue out today.\u201dFather Lu was a bit surprised. His younger son hasn\u2019t left the house in over 6 months.Mother Lu saw the servants bringing in bags after bags of clothes and asked, \u201cYou two bought all these?\u201d\u201cYes, all clothes for myself and Lu Jue. Mom, I discovered today that Lu Jue\u2019s favorite isn\u2019t red colored clothing but floral ones.\u201dOf course Mother Lu was well aware of her son\u2019s preference. As much as she loved her son, she still couldn\u2019t bring herself to buy him the floral shirts. Smiling, Mother Lu sounded much more affectionate toward Ning Zhi now. \u201cHe loves floral-pattern clothing, ever since he was a child. Don\u2019t let him pick out his own next time.\u201dEver since he was a child?Ning Zhi took a look over at Lu Jue in his floral shirt. She could imagine how he looked as a child in his floral shirt. Alabaster, tender, with his baby fat. He must have been a cute little boy.Sitting kitty corner to him, a deep and board male voice from Lu Shenyuan sounded very concerned, \u201cWas Xiao Jue fine when he was out today?\u201dNing Zhi, \u201cYeah, he was fine.\u201dIt was mentioned in the novel that the male lead cared a lot about the status of hi brother\u2019s illness.Lu Shenyuan told Mother Lu, \u201cI ran into a very renowned psychiatrist when I was overseas. I have already arranged for him to come as soon as possible to try and treat Xiao Jue.\u201dMother Lu nodded. Her younger son seemed to have been getting worse as of late and she had been very worried. Lu Shenyuan being able to secured a doctor made her feel better.Lu Jue\u2019s head remained lowered the entire time.Ning Zhi turned and she could see Lu Jue\u2019s long lashes fluttering.She reached out for this hand stealthily and devilishly scratched his palm with the tip of her finger. Truth was, she was okay with him staying inside his own shell. She could always sneak inside of it.Ning Zhi went over to Mother Lu\u2019s room after dinner.\u201cAre you looking for me, Mom?\u201d Ning Zhi had noticed that Father and Mother Lu\u2019s room was a little smaller than Lu Jue\u2019s.It looked like Lu Jue had the best room in the house.\u201cCome. Sit next to me.\u201d Mother Lu looked very gentle under the light.Ning Zhi docilely went over and sat down. She wondered what Mother Lu wanted to talk to her about.After a long while, Mother Lu finally started, \u201cAre you sharing a bed with Xiao Jue?\u201dMother Lu had always known that Ning Zhi had been sleeping on the couch instead of in the same bed as Lu Jue. She had never talked about it with Ning Zhi before but that didn\u2019t mean she was happy about it. Today, however, when the servants went to clean up the room when Lu Jue was out, they noticed that Ning Zhi\u2019s pillow and blanket were on the bed. Apparently, the two of them had been sharing a bed.Mother Lu had mixed feelings after she had found that out from the servants. She was pleasantly surprised. Did that mean Ning Zhi was finally beginning to accept Lu Jue?That she just might have a chance to have little grandsons or granddaughters?Mother Lu wasn\u2019t one to hide things within herself; as such, she asked Ning Zhi point blank.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t think that Mother Lu would ask about this. She was Lu Jue\u2019s wife. It was only normal that the of them share the same bed. Besides, no man could be safer than Lu Jue in this world. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, I am sharing a bed with Lu Jue.\u201dMother Lu looked happy after she heard that. She didn\u2019t say much but she removed her jade bracelet from herself and wanted to put it onto Ning Zhi.\u201cMom, I can\u2019t take this from you.\u201d Ning Zhi had collected rare jewelries in the past and could tell how precious this bracelet was. The best of emperor green. Not everyone could get one even when they could afford one.\u201cOh, put it on. It will go to you sooner or later anyway.\u201d Mother Lu then said to Ning Zhi, \u201cYou just take good care of Xiao Jue.\u201dNing Zhi had fallen instantly in love with the warm feel from the jade. Not being able to turn it down, she accepted the gift from Mother Lu. She was a sweet talker. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom. I promise I will take good care of Lu Jue.\u201d\u2018She chatted with Mother Lu for a while longer and, when she stood up and was about to take off, she noticed the photo on the wall.She saw in the middle was the super cute little Lu Jue in red being carried by Mother Lu. He was pouting and looked like he didn\u2019t want to be there. Father Lu stood next to Mother Lu and there was a little boy on the other side of him.Ning Zhi was stunned when she saw the little boy in the picture.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23- The tender gust of wind landed gently on little Lu Jue\u2019s forehead and it tickled. (1)Ning Zhi pointed at the little boy in the picture and asked Mother Lu, \u201cMom, who is this little boy?\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell? That\u2019s Shenyuan, Xiao Jue\u2019s big brother,\u201d said Mother Lu with a smile. \u201cThis was the first picture that we have taken together since we have adopted Shenyuan.\u201dNing Zhi frowned. No wonder she thought the little boy at the kindergarten looked familiar when she saw him. The familiar feel came from her memory. The original owner had seen Lu Shenyuan before.Xiao Jue in the picture was a little bit older than he was when he was in kindergarten. Meaning to say that Lu Shenyuan had not yet been adopted at that time.So did he want to bully little Lu Jue? Was it because he felt that Lu Jue was an easy target? Or that that was just a normal thing for a child to do?Regardless of what the reason was or that he was still a child at the time and didn\u2019t know better, Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t a fan of this male lead. She didn\u2019t care that he was outstanding, competent and would, in the future, become the mighty Butler Lin who would run the entire Lu Empire.\u201cShenyuan was the child of a friend of Dongzhou. His parents died in a car accident and, considering Xiao Jue\u2019s condition, Dongzhou decided to adopt him. That way there will be someone who can help out with the Lu\u2019s family business and Xiao Jue would have someone to lean on.\u201d Mother Lu, as much as she didn\u2019t want to admit to it, was aware that with Lu Jue\u2019s condition, it would be hard press for him to take over the Lu\u2019s empire.With a comforted look, Mother Lu said, \u201cShenyuan has always been a child who is matured beyond his age. Most importantly, he cares a lot about Xiao Jue and is a good big brother to him.\u201dNing Zhi couldn't help but pouted. Lu Shenyuan was not a child matured beyond his age. He was the one who pushed little Lu Jue down the stairs.As she had already saved little Lu Jue, the events had changed she was now the only person who knew about this. Mother Lu no longer has this incident in her memories.Ning Zhi happened to run into Lu Shenyuan on her way upstairs after she finished her chat with Mother Lu.Lu Shenyuan had been submerged in the business world with Father Lu and he exuded the aura of a businessman. In addition, he was good looking and have a cold temperament. He fit the male lead\u2019s image to the T.If Lu Shenyuan was a conniving one, then Lu Jue was like a little animal who hid in its own shell, too frightened to come out to the real world. He was pure and clean.Lu Shenyuan stopped in his steps and said to her, \u201cI heard from the butler that Xiao Jue had lost control of himself in the last few days and you were the one who calmed him down.\u201dNing Zhi waited for him to finish what he had to say.\u201cAs you are able to help Xiao Jue, I hope that you can continue to take care of him.\u201d Let it be his look or his tone, Lu Shenyuan lived up to the image of a good big brother.Ning Zhi finally nodded.Inside their bedroom, Luo Zheng had already finished showering. Ning Zhi learned that he was let an alarm clock that had been programmed. He was very punctual.He was wearing a new pajama that she bought him today \u2013 it was blue with big red floral prints.A little sun popped up over Lu Jue\u2019s head when she purchased this. Ning Zhi knew that he loved this one.Ning Zhi only took a quick look at it. The big red flowers were painful to look at. She averted her eyes quickly.No wonder Mother Lu, as mush as she loved and cared about Lu Jue, would only buy him a closet full of red clothes. The way he looked in colorful floral prints really hurt one\u2019s eyeballs.\u201cLu Jue, let me talk to you about something.\u201d Ning Zhi didn\u2019t want to see someone so colorful lying next to her when she went to bed and when she woke up.Lu Jue, in his blue pajama with bright red flowers, his beautiful cherry-blossom eyes pointing slightly upward, he was a little dazed and looked both foolish and cute.Ah. Ning Zhi suddenly realized what an awful thing that she had done. She shouldn\u2019t have let him buy so many painful colored clothing just so she for the sake of collecting little suns from him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24- The tender gust of wind landed gently on little Lu Jue\u2019s forehead and it tickled. (2)Her lips twitched a little and she tried to find the right word choice in order to not hurt his fragile feelings. \u201cYour clothes\u2026\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t every day that Lu Jue would respond back to her, \u201cPretty.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe mellowed out her voice and wooed him. \u201cThey are too bright and don\u2019t look good on you. The red one that I bought for you is very pretty. You should dress in red.\u201dLu Jue gave her a sideway glance before he quickly averted his eyes. His lips were shut tightly.Even though his look didn\u2019t change much, Ning Zhi could tell that he was unhappy from the two black clouds over his head.Conflicted, Ning Zhi said, \u201cOkay, how about this? You can wear your floral prints at night, but wear red in the day time? You look the best when you are in red.\u201dLu Jue kept his head lowered and didn\u2019t say anything.Ning Zhi\u2019s heart shuddered. What had he done wrong? He just liked colorful clothes was all. He had done nothing wrong. It was all her fault! It was the fault of her eyes!Lu Jue\u2019s lips remained shut and, after a long while, as though squeezing the words out from his throat, he said, \u201cMmm.\u201dHe ignored her after that.The colorful Lu Jue climbed into bed and kept his eyes closed.Ning Zhi took her shoes off and crawled into bed. She reached out stealthily to wrap her finger around Lu Jue\u2019s. \u201cLu Jue.\u201dHe didn\u2019t respond.Ning Zhi scooted closer to him and touched him again with the tip of her finger. She leaned into his ear and said tenderly, \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. If you like bright colors so much. I will get you lots of bright-colored underwear tomorrow.\u201dShe wooed him, \u201cYou wear them on the inside and nobody could see them.\u201dLu Jue opened up his eyes. His eyes a glowing a little. \u201cYou can see them.\u201dRecalling what he looked like down there, Ning Zhi blushed. She quickly scooted back to her side and away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look at them!\u201dIt was getting late into the night.Ning Zhi opened up her eyes when she heard the light breathing sound coming from Lu Jue.She had gotten 5 little suns today. She had already traded 2 of them for 2% of her halo and she planned to spend the remaining 3 to help Lu Jue.Ning Zhi called out Overlord and handed over the 3 remaining suns. \u201cI still can\u2019t communicate with you after I have gone over there?\u201dOverlord: [That is correct.]Ning Zhi, \u201cAnd I will return automatically after I had helped Lu Jue?\u201dShe wanted to be ready before she departed. At the very minimum, she should say goodbye to little Lu Jue. She left so abruptly last time that she didn\u2019t even get the change to give little Lu Jue a peck on his cheek.Overlord: [Host is so smart.]Ning Zhi had a pretty good idea now. \u201cAlright. You can send me over now.\u201d Saving Lu Jue was like having a dream anyway. It may have been a long time in the dream, but when she woke up she would see that she had only been gone for less than 10 minutes.***Ning Zhi could feel bright light. She opened up her eyes and found herself in the Lu\u2019s garden.She looked down at her own bare feet. They were fair and delicate. They were stepping direction on the ground yet they were not soiled.She wondered if she would show up with shoes on if she put shoes on beforehand next time.Walking under the sun, Ning Zhi could see that skin tone on her hand was so pale that it was glowing. She couldn't help but touched her own face she loved the soft and delicate feel to the touch.Her beauty had returned again.Ning Zhi was happy and she was about to start looking for little Lu Jue.Right at this moment, she saw Mother Lu walked out from her room dressed up nicely. The butler had already had the car ready for her. This was a weekend and she had a gathering to attend.Mother Lu walked past Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi must say that Mother Lu was a very beautiful woman when she was young.After Mother Lu had walked away, Ning Zhi looked back and looked forward to seeing little Lu Jue. She had no idea how much time had past since the last time she saw him and whether he still remembered her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25- The tender gust of wind landed gently on little Lu Jue\u2019s forehead and it tickled. (3)Ning Zhi walked inside the house.Then, a little boy walked down from upstairs. He was much taller than when she saw him the time before.Lu Shenyuan was fair and delicate when he was a child. He had on a clean, white shirt but Ning Zhi really couldn\u2019t be fond of him.Lu Shenyuan said politely, \u201cAunty Feng, my mother had to head out today. Thank you for taking care of Xiao Jue.\u201dAs though something had occurred to him, he went on to say, \u201cI am going to meet up with my classmates at the library so I won\u2019t be doing on my homework assignments with Xiao Jue. Please pass the message onto Xiao Jue, Aunty Feng, and keep an eye out on him when he work on his homework assignments.\u201dAunty Feng sounded very affectionate, \u201cYou be safe, Young Sir. I will let Second Young Sir know. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dLu Shenyuan left happily.Ning Zhi had never met this Aunty Feng at the Lu\u2019s residence so she figured that she had already retired.She walked behind Aunty Feng upstairs to look for little Lu Shao.The middle-aged maid pushed open the door to Lu Jue\u2019s room and Ning Zhi was the first to walk inside.She saw that little Lu Jue was still in his red clothes and was sitting docilely next to the desk.He had grown a lot since kindergarten and was now a 7 ~ 8-year-old boy.The features on him spread apart some more and he had lost some of his baby fat but his cheeks were still puffy. His eyes were black and bright and his red clothes made him look fair and soft, like a white bun.\u201cXiao Juejue.\u201d Ning Zhi walked over and greeted him happily.\u201cLittle Young Sir, it\u2019s time to do your homework.\u201d The maid also walked over as well.Little Lu Jue was very focused on his jigsaw puzzle and did not react at all.The maid sounded somewhat annoyed. \u201cLittle Young Sir.\u201dLittle Lu Jue continued to ignore her.The maid shoved the puzzles on the table to one said and poked forcefully at little Lu Jue\u2019s temple. \u201cAre you deaf? Can\u2019t you hear that I am talking to you.\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201dNing Zhi was stunned by the maid\u2019s action and, immediately after that, she rushed up and wanted to smack the woman\u2019s hand away.The very next second, her hand went through the maid and she wasn\u2019t able to come into contact with her at all.\u201cI said answer me. Can\u2019t you hear?\u201d The maid tucked at little Lu Jue\u2019s ear and twisted it forcefully.When Ning Zhi saw that little Lu Jue\u2019s little ear turned red instantly, she was about to explode. This dang witch!A child\u2019s ear is very fragile. It is very easy to tear when twisted like that.Ning Zhi wanted to pick up the book next to her to throw at the witch but she couldn\u2019t touch anything at al.\u201cLet go of him! Let go of him!\u201d Ning Zhi\u2019s heart was bleeding.Little Lu Jue\u2019s ear was completely red from the twist but he didn\u2019t seem to have felt a thing. His long and curly eyelashes shuddered a little.The maid had learned long ago that no matter how she shouted at him or what she did to him, he would not talk or cry out, nor would he bawl. That was the reason she was so blatant in what she was doing.The maid let go of his ear and little Lu Jue\u2019s ear was so red that it looked like it could bleed.Ning Zhi quickly went over to little Lu Jue and squatted down next to him. \u201cXiao Juejue, you need to shout out. You can\u2019t just let her treat you that way.\u201dShe reached out and touched the tip of his ear lightly. His little ear was still red from the twist and was hot to the touch.Ning Zhi felt her heart ached and bloated. It was an awful feeling.She blew at his ear gently. \u201cDoes it hurt? Big sister will hu-hu you, okay? Hu-huwill take the pain away, alright?\u201d*How could it not hurt when it was twisted like that? He just couldn\u2019t feel pain very well.The maid smacked little Lu Jue on his head and shouted at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t even make a noise when you are struck. Surely you are a fool. What had I done in my past life that I have to take care of a fool like you in this life?\u201dNing Zhi tried to block in front of little Lu Jue\u2019s body but the maid\u2019s hand just went right through her and hit Lu Jue on his head again.Someone knocked on the door at this moment in time.The maid stopped what she was doing quickly and went to open up the door. A young maid stood outside of the door.\u201cSister Fang, Madam said to bring the dessert over for Little Young Sir when it is ready.\u201dThe middle-aged maid took the tray over quickly and said to her, \u201cJust give it to me. Little Young Sir is doing his homework. I\u2019ll have him drink it in a little while.\u201d\u201cThanks, Sister Fang. Thanks for your help.\u201dAfter the door was closed, the maid glanced over at little Lu Jue who was sitting there quietly. She walked over to the other side with the dessert and started drinking it herself.Ning Zhi was so angry that her teeth were grinding.She gently rubbed little Lu Jue where he was hit. \u201cBig sister will continue to hu-huyou.\u201dThe tender gust of wind landed softly on little Lu Jue\u2019s red forehead. It tickled.Li Jiaojiao looked up and at Ning Zhi with his big blank eyes. His voice milky, \u201cHu-hu me.\u201d\u201cMmhmm. Big sister will hu-hu Xiao Jue.\u201d___Translator's notes:Hu-hu \u2013 noise one makes when one blows air at something.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - When he opened up his eyes, the strange big sister was gone. (1)Little Lu Jue\u2019s ear was reddened from being twisted. Ning Zhi checked on it. Lucky there was no tears.Her heart ached and she talked softly next to little Lu Jue\u2019s ear. \u201cXiao Juejue, you need to tell the adults that the old witch hit you. You can just let the bad people bully you.\u201dThe maid took advantage of the fact that little Lu Jue didn\u2019t like to talk and wouldn\u2019t hurt even when hit, nor would he cry. Which was why she felt that she could do whatever she pleased.Ning Zhi taught him. \u201cYou need to learn to tell on them!\u201dLittle Lu Jue\u2019s little face was long. He did not respond to her. His ear itched from being blown on and he cocked his little head.There was nothing that Ning Zhi could do right now. She could only stare as hard as she could at the woman who was happily enjoying the dessert.The woman walked over again after she was done eating.Now that she had dessert, the woman was in a much better mood. She could tell the difference but she knew that what she had just eaten was bird nest soup. The was smooth and sweet in her mouth; precious items that she could never afford on her own.She examined where she had struck little Lu Jue and made sure that it was only reddened with no markings before she left with the empty bowl, feeling relieved.Ning Zhi let out a sigh of relief after the door was closed. She was truly worried that the maid would strike Lu Jue again.She turned around and saw little Lu Jue sitting on his little chair, staring into the air. There was no expression on the milky bun\u2019s little face.His world was a quiet one.Ning Zhi tried to pry open his little hard shelf and force her way in. \u201cHow about big sister work on the jigsaw puzzle with you?\u201dLittle Lu Jue looked at the puzzle on the floor and said softly, \u201cFell.\u201dNing Zhi couldn\u2019t pick the puzzles up so all she could do was to woo him. \u201cYou pick them up and then I will play with you.\u201dLittle Lu Jue blinked his big eyes blankly and then bent over docilely and started picking up the puzzles from the floor.His hands were small and there were even little dimples on the back of his hands. They were so cute that she wishes she could poke at them.Ning Zhi, too, squatted down to keep him company.By the time he had all the puzzles picked up, she sat down next to him and said, \u201cBig sister is really good at this. I can teach Xiao Juejue.\u201d She started guiding him. \u201cYou put this one here.\u201dLittle Lu Jue did not listen to her.\u201cXiao Juejue, put this one there.\u201cAiya, big sister was wrong. This one should go on the left.\u201cWhy do these two pieces look identical?\u201dLittle Lu Jue tightened his lips and, after a while, said in his milky voice. \u201cStupid, you.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDid he just call her stupid?The adult him said she was ugly and the young him called her stupid? How could he!She couldn't help but reached her hand out to pinch his soft little cheek. She rubbed and kneaded his cheeks and she must admit that his cheeks felt nice. \u201cHurry up and said big sister is smart and pretty.Little Lu Jue\u2019s face was trapped by Ning Zhi\u2019s hands and, pouting his little mouth, his looked at her quietly with his pair of big, black eyes.Oh. Ning Zhi felt that her little heart was about to be melted by his cuteness.\u201cStrange\u2026\u2026 big sister.\u201d The little kid\u2019s mouth being pressed by Ning Zhi\u2019s hands, his milky voice was mumbled and appeared even more milky.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t hear hi clearly. Letting go of his cheeks, she asked, \u201cWhat was it again?\u201d\u201cStrange big sister.\u201d Little Lu Jue lowered his head, ignored Ning Zhi, and carried on with his puzzle.Ning Zhi was stumped. Why did he call her strange? She was so pretty right now. Anyway he looked at her, she should be the big angelic sister.This little kid never knew what pretty was since he was a child!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - When he opened up his eyes, the strange big sister was gone. (2)When Mother Lu returned from her gathering that night, she immediately went to visit her son on the second floor.Aunty Feng reluctantly prepared the bath water for little Lu Jue. She quickly walked up to Mother Lu with a smile when she saw Mother Lu walking inside. \u201cMadam, you are back.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s Xiao Jue doing today?\u201d Her son was nice and docile and would never cause any trouble. Mother Lu, however, wished that he could be more active like other kids, even if that means he would get into troubles from time to time.Seeing that Mother Lu had returned, Ning Zhi patted little Lu Jue next to her and said to him, \u201cHurry up. Tell your Mommy that this old witch hit you.\u201dLittle Lu Jue read his book quietly and didn\u2019t make a sound.Ning Zhi leaned into his ear and said fiercely, \u201cHurry up tall on her, just like big sister had taught you earlier. Tell your Mommy that you were hit.\u201dLittle Lu Jue\u2019s mouth was shut tight. He still didn\u2019t make a sound.\u201cBig Sister is going to bite you on your little ear if you still don\u2019t listen to her!\u201d Ning Zhi threatened him fiercely.Little Lu Jue lifted his head and said, \u201cBite Big Sister, ear.\u201dMother Lu, hearing that her son had just said something, was delighted. She walked quickly over. \u201cXiao Jue, what did you just say?\u201d\u201cNot this one. Tell her that the old witch had hit you.\u201d Ning Zhi instructed him again.Little Lu Jue blinked his large eyes. \u201cHit old witch.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Mother Lu didn\u2019t understand what her son was trying to tell him.Aunty Feng, hearing his words, shuddered and she walked up quickly, \u201cMadam, the bath water for young master is ready.\u201d\u201cWait a minute, Xiao Jue is chatting with me.\u201d Even just one sentence from her son was more than enough to make Mother Lu happy. \u201cMy nice son, what did you just say? Can you repeat it for me?\u201dNext to him, Ning Zhi was anxious. She leaned into little Lu Jue\u2019s ear and teach him word by word. \u201cLittle Juejue, quickly, tell you mother that the old witch had hit you and twisted your ear.\u201dLittle Lu Jue lowered his head. \u201cHit me. Old witch. Twist my ear.\u201dThe smile on Mother Lu stiffened a little. \u201cSomeone hit you and twisted your ear?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t sure if she had heard her son correctly but she quickly went to check his ear. His little ear was white and tender. There were no tears or any markings.Aunty Feng shuddered and looked at little Lu Jue in shock. She couldn\u2019t believe that he was telling on her.Mother Lu quickly checked the rest of his body but didn\u2019t find anything. \u201cXiao Jue, what do you mean by that?\u201d Who would dare to hit him inside the Lu\u2019s residence?\u201cAunty Feng.\u201d Mother Lu called out to the maid. \u201cYou were the one who was watching after Xiao Jue today. Did you ever step away from him?\u201dAunty Feng forced a smile onto herself and replied quickly. \u201cMadam, little young master played quietly in his room all day today. I was with him the entire time. Nothing happened.\u201dNing Zhi only wished she could beat up this old witch right now. What a shameless person. \u201cXiao Juejue, quickly. Say that it was her who hit you.\u201dLittle Lu Jue was like a broken machine that repeats. \u201cXiao Jue. Hit you.\u201dMother Lu, taken aback a little, rubbed her son on his head. \u201cOkay, your bath water had been drawn. Mommy will take Xiao Jue for his bath.\u201dAunty Feng was finally able to relax her body. She found that comical. The little fool had tried to tell on her?That night.Little Lu Jue changed into his red cartoon pajama after he had bathed.\u201cBig Sister will help you take care of the bad people tomorrow.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how to tell on them so she would have to come up with something else.Little Lu Jue laid down and closed his eyes.His little face appeared even more tender and alabaster under the soft light. His cheeks, with their baby fat, made it look like had had a piece of candy in his mouth. He was soft and cute beyond words.He was so cute that Ning Zhi couldn't help but leaned down and gave him a peck on his cheek.A gentle and warm touch. Little Lu Jue opened up his eyes and looked at Ning Zhi blankly.Ning Zhi patted him on his head and said, \u201cGo to bed. Goodnight, Little Juejue.\u201dLittle Lu Jue closed his eyes once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - When he opened up his eyes, the strange big sister was gone. (3)Ning Zhi sat in the passenger seat and went to school with little Lu Jue again the next morning.Both little Lu Jue and Lu Shenyuan sat in the back of the car with Mother Lu sitting next to the two of them. She insisted on taking the kids to school every day.Ning Zhi learned from the dialogs between Mother Lu and Lu Shenyuan that Lu Shenyuan was in the academically-focused class and little Lu Jue was in a regular class. The two did not belong to the same class.Mother Lu wished that the two of them could be in the same class; that way little Lu Jue would have his older brother to look over him. She was, however, not a selfish one, and did not want to sacrifice Lu Shenyuan\u2019s grades for the sake of taking care of little Lu Jue.The car stopped in front of the school.Lu Shenyuan waved politely at Mother Lu after he had gotten out of the car.On the other side, little Lu Jue walked dully in the direction of the school with his little red backpack on his back.Mother Lu sighed and only got back into the car and took off after her son had walked away.Ning Zhi went with little Lu Jue to his class. His spot was next to the window.Ning Zhi only discovered after class had started that the spot next to little Lu Jue was empty. He did not have a deskmate.Everybody else in class had a deskmate. He was the only one who sat alone.Light came in through the window and it was quiet and lonely on his little body.Ning Zhi sat down in the spot next to him. Leaning close to him, she smiled and said, \u201clittle Juejue, I am going to be your deskmate today.\u201dLittle Lu Jue looked over at her, then turned away.Then, to Ning Zhi\u2019s surprise, he placed a pen in front of her, followed by a new notebook, and a book.Ning Zhi couldn't help but busted out laughing. He was really treating her like his deskmate?Chuckling, Ning Zhi teased him. \u201cThank you, Classmate little Lu Jue.\u201dAttending grade school with one\u2019s own husband was kind of exciting.During physical education class, Ning Zhi followed little Lu Jue to the playground. A gunch of little carrots engaged in games or ballgames happily. Little Lu Jue, on the other hand, sat quietly under a tree.As though knowing that little Lu Jue was a special one in his class, he didn\u2019t pay him much attention.Ning Zhi squatted down next to little Lu Jue. \u201clittle Juejue, aren\u2019t you going to go play balls? Playing with the ball is fun.\u201dLittle Lu Jue turned and ignored her.Ning Zhi leaned into his ears and said softly, \u201cOh, so little Juejue doesn\u2019t want to play with them?\u201dLittle Lu Jue kept his little mouth shut.Looking at the children running around actively with smiles on their faces, Ning Zhi suddenly felt her heart ached.She wooed little Lu Jue. \u201cBig Sister likes little Juejue. How about I play with you?\u201dHaving said that, she stood up, took little Lu Jue\u2019s hand, and walked with him to the sandbox behind them.\u201cDoes little Juejue want to know what he is like after he had grown up?\u201d Ning Zhi pinched him on his cheek. \u201cBig Sister can tell you.\u201dLittle Lu Jue blinked his big eyes. \u201cTell me.\u201dNing Zhi held his hand, picked up a small twig and, with her hand over his, led his hand to start drawing on the sand.Little Lu Jue\u2019s big eyes looked at Ning Zhi the entire time and he let her hold his hand.After a little while, Ning Zhi let go of his little hand. \u201cOkay, look. This is what you look like after you grow up.\u201dThere was curiosity in little Lu Jue\u2019s eyes.He looked at the sand and on there was a cartoon pig. He tossed aside the twig in his hand and, pinching his little mouth shut quickly, he said, \u201cPig. You.\u201dYou are a big.Ning Zhi doubled down laughing.Ning Zhi spent two days around little Lu Jue.He would look up at her when she got close to him.He would turn his ear toward her slightly when she talked to him next to his ear.Ning Zhi\u2019s image would reflect in his blank eyes when she smiled.Because of his effort to tell on her a couple of days ago, Aunty Feng had not try to strike him again.But Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t just going to let that go.When nobody was paying attention, Ning Zhi brought little Lu Jue to Mother Lu\u2019s room. The two of them picked up a jade bracelet and stealthily placed it in Aunty Feng\u2019s pocket.That night, when Mother Lu found the bracelet in Aunty Feng\u2019s pocket, Ning Zhi covered up little Lu Jue\u2019s eyes.\u201cBig Sister is the bad one. Little Lu Jue did nothing.\u201d She was the one who did that. Little Lu Jue was in the clear.Exactly like Ning Zhi had wanted, Mother Lu decided to fire Aunty Feng. It was just because of the bracelet. She had also noticed the odd way that Aunty Feng had been looking at little Lu Jue the last few days and that made her feel uncomfortable.Mother Lu would not allow any potential danger around her son.Now that the issue with Aunty Feng had been resolved, Ning Zhi knew that it was time for her to go.Covering little Lu Jue\u2019s eyes, she leaned into his ear and said, \u201cLittle Lu Jue, Big Sister has to go. We will meet later.\u201dWhen she finished saying that, little Lu Jue felt a warm feeling on his ear as though someone had kissed him.He sensed brightness in front of his eyes and, when he opened up his eyes, the strange Big Sister was gone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Aunty Feng got what she deserved. (1)Opening her eyes, Ning Zhi recollected herself slowly. She was back.She looked over at Lu Jue sleeping next to her. He slept very properly, lying down flat on his back. Unless her, she liked to hug the blanket when she slept and she also enjoyed rolling around.Ning Zhi looked at the time. She had spent days over there this time but only 10 minutes had passed. She did the math and figured that each day that she spent over there was equivalent to 5 minutes.If she was to spend a month there, it would be 150 minutes in present time.Ning Zhi felt that as she had no idea how much time she would need each time to save little Lu Jue, going at night was her best option.Ning Zhi woke up the next day when the sky was just brightening up.Lu Jue, too, wake up on time next to her. He looked dazed and his cherry-blossom eyes were filled with grogginess and moisture. Along with his impeccable good look, he was delectably good looking.Ning Zhi looked downward and saw his red and blue floral-patterned pajama. She had to look away.It was too painful to look at.Lu Jue was oblivious to that. Pulling over the blanket, perhaps noticing that his pajama was a bit wrinkly, he straightened it out in a cherished way before he got out of bed to go wash up.Ning Zhi found that comical.The adult Lu Jue was still very cute.***Ning Zhi looked for the butler and asked him about Aunty Feng.The butler, too, was very surprised that Ning Zhi would bring that up out of the blue. \u201cSecond Young Madam, Aunty Feng was fired over 10 years ago.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201cWhy was she fired?\u201d\u201cShe stole one of Madam\u2019s bracelet and Madam fired her.\u201dThe butler remembered clearly. He was very surprised at the time. Every one who came working at the Lu family would have to go through a training period ahead of time and Aunty Feng was hired after first young master had joined the Lu family. She main job was to take care of the first young master and, occasionally, the second young master.Aunty Feng hadn\u2019t been with the Lu family for a long time. Nobody expected that to happen.Ning Zhi narrowed her eyes. Yup, nobody knew that she had abused Lu Jue in the past.\u201cDo you have the address of this Aunty Feng, Butler?\u201d\u201cThe Lu family would take detail information on each employee of theirs and I have the records with me. But we are talking about over 10 years ago.\u201d The butler paused a little. \u201cIf Second Young Madam wishes to find Aunty Feng\u2019s address, I can have someone look into that as soon as possible.\u201dNing Zhi smiled. No wonder this Uncle Li could hold the job as the butler of the Lu family. \u201cThank you, Uncle Li.\u201dThe butler was very efficient and Ning Zhi got her hands on Aunty Feng\u2019s address before noon.When Ning Zhi brought Lu Jue out of the house, he reluctantly changed out of his floral shirt and put on a red sweater.Looking at the black cloud in the indicator above his head, Ning Zhi smiled and told him. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to buy underwear later. The kind with floral prints.\u201dApparently, Lu Jue still remembered that. His long and straight eyelashes quivered a little and the black cloud above him disappeared.The car drove inside of an alley.There were a lot of puddles on the ground and the walls were aged and mottled. There were also a lot of haphazardly laid wires above the alley. The environment was chaotic and the arrival of the luxurious black seemed very out of place.The chauffeur informed Ning Zhi, \u201cSecond Young Madam, the red door in front of us is Feng Fang\u2019s address.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Ning Zhi turned her head and looked at Lu Jue sitting next to her. He had been sitting there properly and quietly with his eyes lowered since they had gotten into the car.Leaning into his ear, she said to him, \u201cDo you still remember the old witch? We are here to teach her a lesson.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t able to do anything before and was only able to pull a little stunt to keep her away from little Lu Jue. Being fired alone wasn\u2019t enough to justify her crime.Lu Jue\u2019s eyes moved a little.Ning Zhi smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t remember. I do.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Aunty Feng got what she deserved. (2)She was just about to open up the car door and get out of the car when she saw the old red metal door with peeling paint opened up and a woman in her forties walked out with a trash can in her hand.Her hair was tied up behind her head and only her round face was showing. Ning Zhi recognized her as Aunty Feng.She walked over stealthily and emptied out the content of the trash can in front of her neighbor\u2019s place.Aunty Feng turned around complacently and, the very next second, the neighbor\u2019s door opened up and a short-haired woman middle-aged woman jumped out.\u201cFeng Fang, stand right there! I finally caught you this time. You shameless thing. Take your garbage back with you.\u201d The middle-aged woman ran up and tugged on Aunty Fang.\u201cYou threw fruit peel in front of my house two days ago and caused me to fall. You should be happy that dumping garbage in front of your house is all that I am doing,\u201d said Aunty Fang with her eyes raised, looking arrogant.The middle-aged woman was no pushover. \u201cHow can you proof that it was me who did that? But I witnessed you dumping garbage in front of my house\u2026\u2026\u201dNing Zhi, sitting in the car, watched as the two women went from a shouting match to getting physical with each other. She couldn't help but smacked her lips.The chauffeur asked Ning Zhi, \u201cShould we go over there, Second Young Madam?\u201d\u201cNo, we will just watch the drama from here.\u201d Ning Zhi had never seen fights like that before \u2013 clothes-pulling, hair-yanking, face-scratching, the whole nine yards.Aunty Fang was the sturdier one of the two and the middle-aged woman was no match of hers. Quickly, Aunty Fang was sitting on the middle-aged woman slapping her on her face.*Ning Zhi told the chauffeur. \u201cYou go and help that short-haired woman. If she wanted to strike her back, have her smack Aunty Feng on her head and twist her ear.\u201dLet her experience the same treatment that little Lu Jue had received.\u201cYes, Second Young Madam.\u201dThe chauffeur was also the Lu family\u2019s bodyguard. Not only was he good in fighting, his build was intimidating. Both the middle-aged woman and Aunty Feng were startled when he went over.The middle-aged woman, with hand prints on her face, was very excited when she saw the chauffeur subdued Aunty Feng and learned that he was on her side.Listening to the chauffeur\u2019s instructions, she slapped Aunty Feng on her cheeks and her forehead and she even went to twist Aunty Fang\u2019s ear. \u201cFeng Fang, what goes around comes around.\u201dAunty Feng shriek in pain.Ning Zhi reached her hands out and covered up Lu Jue\u2019s eyes. Leaning into his ear, she said to him softly, \u201cDon\u2019t look at the bad people xiao Juejue.\u201dThe chauffeur let go of Aunty Feng when the middle-aged woman had let it all out.Aunty Feng was angry and in pain. Covering her ear that was red and painful from being twisted, she stared at the middle-aged woman and the chauffeur as though her eyes had been soaked in poison.She demanded to know, \u201cWho are you? Tare you this woman\u2019s illicit affair?\u201d\u201cPei!\u201d said the middle-aged woman. \u201cFeng Fang, watch what you are saying.\u201dThe chauffeur dusted the invisible dust off of himself said, \u201cI am the chauffeur of the Lu family.\u201dThe Lu family?It took Aunty Feng quite a while to put two and two together. Her hand that was covering her ear tightened. \u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201dThe chauffeur ignored her, turned, and entered the car.Aunty Feng finally noticed a car that was far too luxurious for this neighborhood and she could somewhat make out the look of the man inside through the window.It dawned on Aunty Feng that the chauffeur the middle-aged woman smacked her on her forehead and twisted her ear \u2013 all of them she had done to the fool of a young master before.Was he here for revenge?Aunty Feng shuddered. Immediately, as though her soul had left her body, she stumbled back inside her house nervously, forgetting even her trash can.Ning Zhi pursed her lips. A woman like Aunty Feng would only dare to bully those weaker than herself.The man placed his hand that was slightly cool to the touch on Ning Zhi\u2019s wrist. Ning Zhi was a little startled and quickly removed her hands that were covering Lu Jue\u2019s eyes.His pair of pretty cherry-blossom eyes gave her a blank look before he looked away.Ning Zhi cupped his face with her hands.He had no choice but to lift his fluttering eyes and met with hers. Frightened, he wanted to lower his head but he wasn\u2019t able to with her holding his face.Noticing that Lu Jue was frowning slightly, Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cI have taught her a lesson for you. Are you happy?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - The first shopping trip (1)Lu Jue did not respond.Ning Zhi changed the subject. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go get your floral print underwear.\u201dLu Jue looked up and glanced quickly over at Ning Zhi. He voice was both deep and melodious. \u201cI buy you.\u201dI buy for you.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved and she toyed with him purposefully. \u201cYou want to buy me? I am pretty pricey.\u201dLu Jue kept his lips shut for quite a while before he responded to her slowly. \u201cUgly. No want.\u201dNing Zhi was so angry that she could bite him when she heard that. She didn\u2019t mind that he was a fool but he didn\u2019t like that she was ugly?When they arrived at the store, Ning Zhi straight up had the salesperson brought up any men\u2019s underwear with floral prints or were bright colored.Looking at all the different styles, Ning Zhi finally realized that men could be very men sao too.\u201cBuy all that you like,\u201d said Ning Zhi generously.Then, the salesperson saw the extremely handsome man in red sweater shirt picked out an underwear that was green with bright red rose prints.Ning Zhi had already built up her tolerance and she said to him very tenderly when she saw the little sun that popped up over Lu Jue\u2019s head all of a sudden, \u201cAnything else that you like? I will buy all of them for you.\u201dThen, Lu Jue picked the reddish orange pair, a bright yellow pair, and all sort of fruit print ones.Standing next to him, Ning Zhi was smiling brightly. Her eyes getting progressively brighter with each additional little sun over Lu Jue\u2019s head!The salesperson was stunned.To think that she had previously questioned whether these men\u2019s style would sell when she saw her boss adding these colorful styles to their inventory.Watching the handsome picking them out happily and the female customer continue to tell the man how great his choices were, the salesperson felt that her sense of esthetics was problematic.***Walking out of the store, Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes and face were filled with smile.[Host. Host. Would you like to trade for halo?]Overlord was even more excited than Ning Zhi when he learned that Ning Zhi had collected 5 little suns at one time.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t think that buying colorful underwear for Lu Jue would make him this happy and earned her that many little suns.\u201cI want to exchange all of them for my halo,\u201d said Ning Zhi generously.She turned to look at the man with the 5 little suns above him as she said that. Tsk. The little suns were glistening in gold color and Ning Zhi felt that Lu Jue was now even more handsome than usual!\u201cLu Jue, let\u2019s head home.\u201d Ning Zhi reached out for Lu Jue\u2019s hand.The moment that she touched his hand, all of the little golden suns rushed into Ning Zhi\u2019s mind.Ning Zhi quickly turned them into Overlord and exchanged them for 5% of her halo.The second the exchange took place, Ning Zhi could see that her hand that was holding onto Lu Jue turned a shade lighter.She quickly pulled out the makeup mirror from her purse.From the mirror, she could see that her face looked like another layer of gauze had been unveiled, allowing some colors to peek through. If she was plain-looking before this, she was now slightly fair-looking.Recalling how she had turned back into her glowing and attractive self when she transmigrated back to Lu Jue\u2019s childhood, so attractive that others couldn\u2019t look away from her, it made her very happy.Soon. Soon. As long as she continued to appease Lu Jue, her beauty would return to her.When she returned to the Lu\u2019s residence, Ning Zhi found Lin Tiantian chatting with Mother Lu in the living room.\u201cOh hey, you are back, Xiao Zhi.\u201d After learning that Lu Shenyuan, her husband, was returning from overseas, Lin Tiantian immediately returned home from her set.Looking at Ning Zhi, for some odd reasons, she felt that Ning Zhi\u2019s skin tone became a shade lighter than before.\u201cMmm.\u201d Ning Zhi was cold toward Lin Tiantian.Lin Tiantian smiled tenderly. \u201cI have been too busy lately. Are you mad that I haven\u2019t been spending a lot of time with you, Xiao Zhi?\u201dLin Tiantian decided that she no longer need to spend time on Ning Zhi after she had taken away almost all of her halo. As such, she did not contact Ning Zhi at all when she was on her set.\u201cWhy would I be mad?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.She couldn\u2019t be bothered to pretend that the two of them were close. She couldn\u2019t happier if Lin Tiantian would leave her alone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - The first shopping trip (2)\u201cXiao Zhi had been keeping Xiao Jue company lately,\u201d said Mother Lu with a smile. \u201cWhere did you two go today?\u201dShe was happy to see that Ning Zhi had taken Lu Jue out of the house with her and she was also happy to see Ning Zhi spending time with Lu Jue.Ning Zhi smiled and said to Mother Lu, \u201cTo buy presents. I have promised Lu Jue before.\u201dThe smile on Mother Lu thickened. Even the way she was looking at Ning Zhi became more tender.\u201cWhat kind of present?\u201d Mother Lu was curious when she saw the paper bag that her son was carrying.Ning Zhi blinked and said to Mother Lu, \u201cThat\u2019s a secret between Lu Jue and I.\u201dThat made Mother Lu even happier. That was what she wanted to see the most. \u201cYou two have your own secrets now?\u201dLin Tiantian was stunned when she heard that.She knew better than anyone else how much Ning Zhi disliked Lu Jue. Now she was getting close to Lu Jue?Lin Tiantian\u2019s eyes, fallen upon Ning Zhi\u2019s wrist, saw that Ning Zhi was wearing Mother Lu\u2019s emperor green bracelet. The green was so bright that it pained her eyes.That very moment, Lin Tiantian seemed to have it figured out. Ning Zhi\u2019s attitude toward Lu Jue must have changed for the sake of buttering up to Mother Lu.\u201cXiao Zhi, my mom\u2019s birthday is this Sunday and she would like you to come for dinner,\u201d said Lin Tiantian hesitantly. \u201cShe would like you to bring Lu Jue with you as well.\u201dNoticing that Mother Lu was looking at her, Lin Tiantian quickly added, \u201cMy mom said that it had been 6 months since Xiao Zhi\u2019s wedding but she has yet to bring Lu Jue back for dinner\u2026\u2026\u201dMother Lu knew that Ning Zhi had been living with the Lin family since she was a child. Lin Tiantian\u2019s mother was Ning Zhi\u2019s mother\u2019s younger sister. It was not out of the ordinary to want to have dinner with her niece and nephew-in-law.With Lu Jue\u2019s special condition, Lu Jue had never visited the elders on Ning Zhi\u2019s side since they had gotten married overseas.Mother Lu did not object to Ning Zhi bringing Lu Jue with her. With Ning Zhi there, even if Lu Jue was to lose control of his emotions, she would be able to pacify him.Lin Tiantian added, \u201cShenyuan said he has time to come with on Sunday as well. Lu Jue will be fine with him there.\u201dIn her memory, the original owner\u2019s aunty had been nice to the original owner.Ning Zhi nodded. \u201cSure, I will bring Lu Jue with me as that\u2019s what Aunty wants.\u201d***Compared to the super wealthy Lu family, the Lin family, being just a small company but just well-off. They were nowhere close to being a prominent family.Ever since Lin Tiantian had inadvertently saved Lu Shenyuan and married into the Lu family. The Lin family seemed to have all the green lights turned on for them and had been going up and up.Later on, surprise to all, even the Lin family\u2019s niece married into the Lu family. All of the relatives knew that the Lin and the Lu families were intertwined and the Lin family\u2019s status was no longer what they used to be.On the day of Mother Lin\u2019s birthday, many wanted to butter up to the Lin family and nice words could be heard nonstop.\u201cMrs. Lin, what skincare tricks do you use? You look to be another 10 years younger.\u201d\u201cMrs. Lin, is your dress Chanel\u2019s latest design? It\u2019s perfect on you.\u201d\u201cI heard that First Young Master Lu will be here for your birthday today?\u201d\u201cFirst Young Master Lu? The First Young Master of the Lu Corporation?\u201d Someone exclaimed.\u201cI heard that your niece married the Second Young Master Lu. Is that true, Mrs. Lin? That Second Young Master\u2026\u2026\u201dMother Lin, smiling, said, \u201cThey will be here for my birthday today.\u201d\u201cOh, both young masters of the Lu family will be here? What a lucky woman you are, Mrs. Lin.\u201dMany were envious of the fact that the Lin family had the opportunity to become in-laws with prominent family like the Lu family. They regret that their daughters never had that opportunity.Inside the bedroom.Holding up a black suit, Ning Zhi asked, \u201cHow about you just give it a try?\u201dLin Xi, with his mouth shut tight, wouldn\u2019t even look at the black, purely handmade suit in front of him.Ning Zhi sighed and had the servant brought out another set of suit that they had prepared ahead of time.A pure red suit, elegant and eye-catching.Lu Jue finally looked up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - A visit to the Lin\u2019s (1)Ning Zhi already had his sense of aesthetic figured out. \u201cAlright, this one then.\u201dLu Jue didn\u2019t say yes but he didn\u2019t reject the idea either.Ning Zhi, too, went to change. She purposefully picked out a black gown. She hasn\u2019t had her light skin tone back yet. Picking a light-colored dress would just accentuate her flaw.She was glad that she exchanged all 5 of the little suns for her halo. She at least looked lighter when she was in black.Ning Zhi only had the makeup artist applied a light makeup for her.\u201cMiss Ning, the proportion of your facial features are incredible.\u201d The makeup artist was surprised.Every feature of this Miss Ning was delicate. She was the prettiest among all ladies of the prominent family and celebrities that she had encountered in the past.Oddly, she looked very plain. Somehow, all of her delicate features together did not make her stand out.There was something very odd about it.She felt that this Miss Ning Zhi should be a glowing, lively and eye-catching beauty.Ning Zhi smiled. She nodded in satisfaction when she saw her own reflection in the mirror. She looked yet another shade lighter with the makeup on. She was at least fair-looking after she had dolled herself out.The makeup artist praised Ning Zhi again after she had her black gown on. \u201cMiss Ning, your body is so shapely. Many actresses are on a diet everyday just so they could be as skinny as you.\u201d\u201cYou think I am shapely right now?\u201dNing Zhi looked at herself in the full-length mirror. Her waist is skinny and her legs long. Nevertheless, she was not stunning because she has lost her halo.\u201cOf course.\u201d The makeup artist nodded honestly.Ning Zhi knew what she looked like when her beauty returned to her. She was shapely, her upper body thrusted out and her pair of long legs alabaster. She was skinny but soft. Unlike how she was now. Now she only resembled a dried flower on a stem.Putting on her black high heels with ribbons, she smiled and said, \u201cI am not that pretty right now.\u201d She would truly be pretty when she got all of her halo back.The makeup artist thought she was just being humble. \u201cYou are too humble, Miss Ning.\u201dNing Zhi went to check on Lu Jue after she was ready.Walking inside of the room, she saw Lu Jue who had on a floral shirt with a solid red suit. Ning Zhi felt that they hurt her eyes.That was painful to look at.\u201cYou can\u2019t wear floral under it.\u201d Ning Zhi walked over with the black shirt that she had picked up earlier. \u201cYou need to put this on.\u201dLu Jue turned his back to her and rejected silently.Ning Zhi patted him on his back but she didn\u2019t get a response.Ning Zhi had an idea and she walked over to Lu Jue.Leaning into his ear, she said mean things to him in a tender voice. \u201cIf you don\u2019t change out of that shirt, I am going to throw away all of your floral underwear later.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s tall figure shuddered. Obviously, she was able to get through to him this time.He lifted his hand and looked at Ning Zhi with disbelief and aggrievement in his pretty cherry-blossom eyes as though he was complaining about her cruelty.Ning Zhi\u2019s little heart trembled a little. With a guilty conscience, she said, \u201cHurry up and change.\u201dLu Jue took the solid black shirt from Ning Zhi reluctantly and hrumped disgruntledly. \u201cUgly.\u201dNing Zhi saw a black cloud appearing inside the indicator over Lu Jue\u2019s head.He slowly removed his favorite silk light blue shirt with pink cherry blossoms and carefully placed it on the bed. He even folded it up neatly before he put on the well-tailored black shirt resentfully.Lu Jue worked out every morning and had a great body.On his board chest were a layer of even and firm muscles. When he moved, the muscles would tense and puffed up, making him appear powerful.With the black shirt on, his handsome face looked cold and cool.After Lu Jue had buttoned himself up, he tucked the black shirt into his pants. His board waist seemed straighter and full of strength.When he put on the red suit jacket. The extreme contrast between the black and red clashed with each other and this man was nothing other than a seducer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - A visit to the Lin\u2019s (2)Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t look away from him.Board shoulder, narrow waist, and long legs.And that perfect face. Tsk, everything about this little silly boy was exactly her preference.Had the man in front of her not be autistic, he would charm many with his look and his family background.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ning Zhi held his hand voluntarily, her fingers interlacing with his.She even purposefully rubbed his fingers with her soft part of her finger. \u201cThere will be a lot of others during dinner. But you don\u2019t need to be afraid. I will be next to you the entire time. If you are unhappy, you just let me know and we will take off, okay?\u201dLu Jue felt his fingers tickled by something soft. He gave Ning Zhi a quick look and did not object to her holding his hand.Above his head, the little black cloud disappeared.The Lin family had purchased a small mansion next to the rich people district a while ago.For Mother Lin\u2019s birthday, she had it decorated particularly. Every d\u00e9cor was delicate and luxurious. She invited many friends and families to attend the banquet.Lin Tiantian had returned home a long time ago.She dolled herself up purposefully today and had on a white, exquisite, and fancy dress. With her alabaster skin, she looked like she was glowing.Mother Lin was in a good mood today and she looked her daughter up and down the whole time.She noticed her daughter looked prettier each time she returned. She was elegant and classy. So much that she barely recognized that she was her normally fair-looking, scrawny daughter with mediocre skin.Mother Lin looked very proud seeing Lin Tiantian standing next to her handsome and outstanding Young Master Lu. \u201cThe banquet hasn\u2019t started yet. Why don\u2019t you take a seat with Shenyuan over there? Your dad is only on the couch too.\u201d\u201cHere, Mom, your birthday present from Shenyuan,\u201d said Lin Tiantian as she handed the present over to Mother Lin.Mother Lin couldn\u2019t stop smiling.All of the guests were envious. They wondered what the Lin family had done in their past lives that they were able to marry into the Lu family.\u201cI don\u2019t remember Tiantian being so pretty when I saw her a few years ago. How come she looks like an entirely different person now?\u201dThe stunning Lin Tiantian was very different than how her relatives remembered her.\u201cI heard that she\u2019s a star now. All actresses know how to doll themselves up.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Neither Lin Daihai nor Fang Qing are attractive people. How is it that Lin Tiantian suddenly shot out like that? She was just an okay-looking girl when they saw her two years ago.\u201d\u201cNow that she had married into the Lu family, she is a rich lady and have the money to doll herself up. She\u2019s pretty now because she\u2019s classy.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I hear that the Lin\u2019s niece also married into the Lu family? How did the Lu family get so lucky?\u201d\u201cHer niece isn\u2019t as lucky as their real daughter. Didn\u2019t you know? The niece married the fool but Lin Tiantian married the first young master. He stands to succeed the Lu Enterprise in the future.\u201d\u201cI heard there is something wrong with the Lu\u2019s second young master. Is that the one that their niece married?\u201d***The guests were very engaged in the conversation, especially when they found out that the Lin\u2019s daughter and niece married the two young masters of the Lu family, they continued to compare and contrast the two of them.\u201cMadam, the banquet is ready,\u201d said the servant to Mother Lin.\u201cIs Ning Zhi here yet?\u201d Mother Lin checked the time. She hasn\u2019t seen Ning Zhi yet.\u201cNo, not yet.\u201dMother Lin touched her quickly and said, \u201cWe are not going to wait. Bring the dishes. We don\u2019t want to keep First Young Master Lu waiting.\u201d Even though Lu Shenyuan was her son-in-law, she dared not pull the mother-in-law card in front of him.On the other side, Lin Dahai, Father Lin, had been chatting with Lu Shenyuan and praising how outstanding he was with every sentence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - A visit to the Lin\u2019s (3)\u201cI heard that you have been developing a new project with Mr. Lu overseas. How is it coming along?\u201d asked Father Lin tentatively.Lu Shenyuan\u2019s voice was full and his aura cold. He was imposing just sitting there. \u201cRight. That is coming along well. The Lu family has the technology, the talents, and the capital. Expanding into a new area is not much of an issue.\u201dFather Lin nodded at that.When he heard that the Lu Enterprise was developing a new project, he was dying to be a part of it. His head, however, was still clear and he knew the difference between his own small company and that of the Lu Corporation.Next to them, Lin Tiantian wrapped her arm around Lu Shenyuan\u2019s and, with a shy look, said to her father, \u201cDad, it\u2019s now dinner time. It\u2019s not everyday that Shenyuan has some downtime. You should stop talking about work with him.\u201dLin Dahai laughed heartily and said, \u201cAlright, alright. I won\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201dThe harmonious atmosphere among them made the other friends and families even more envious.Noticing the envious looks from around her, Lin Tiantian\u2019s smile intensified. These used to only belong to Ning Zhi had in her dreams.And now, she was the one that everyone was envious of.Suddenly, she heard a low cry from the guests nearby.Looking over at the direction that everyone was looking at, Lin Tiantian saw Ning Zhi walking inside holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand in hers.Lu Jue had on a red suit. With a loud color like that, any man who was not as tall, skinny or handsome enough would appear to be ugly and crude.Lu Jue, however, was not only tall, but also have an extremely handsome face. The red suit only made him look like an elegant seductor that others were afraid to look at.Ning Zhi had on a black dress.The black and red contrasted each other greatly.Holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand in hers, Ning Zhi walked toward the main table under everyone\u2019s gaze.Lin Tiantian\u2019s chest tightened a little. She seemed to have seen that Ning Zhi in her dream who was above everyone else and was the always the object of envy once again.She reflexively clenched her fists. The pain in her palm made her saw Ning Zhi\u2019s look clearly. Unlike how it was in her dream, Ning Zhi was very plain-looking right now.\u201cXiao Zhi, how come you are just now arriving?\u201d Mother Lin had the servants brought out two more sets of utensils.She looked at the man next to Ning Zhi. Had he not had his head down and not making eye contact with anyone, she really couldn\u2019t tell that the Second Young Master was autistic.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There was some traffic on our way here.\u201d Ning Zhi, holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand in hers, sat down in the empty spots across from Lin Tiantian.\u201cI am glad you can make it. You haven\u2019t been back to visit for a while. I think about you every day. How are you doing at the Lu\u2019s?\u201d Mother Lin checked out Luo Zheng. Her own daughter had been getting prettier and prettier as each day passed but her niece looked less and less attractive.Many peeked over after Mother Lin asked that question. They were stunned at how handsome the Second Young Master Lu was, even more so than the First Young Master Lu.Didn\u2019t they say that the Second Young Master Lu was a fool? He certainly didn\u2019t look like one right now.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved as did her lips. \u201cI am fine over the Lu\u2019s. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, Aunty.\u201d\u201cHow come you look like you have lost a lot of weight?\u201dNing Zhi smiled and said, \u201cI have been on a diet lately.\u201dMother Lin glanced over Lu Jue, who had kept to himself this entire time and not looking at anyone. Regardless of how outstanding his appearance was, anyone who paid him some attention could tell that he was different.The others noticed too and started gossiping about him softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Someone gave Lu Jue wine (1)When Ning Zhi heard terms such as \u201cfool\u201d, \u201cmentally challenged\u201d, or \u201cmental illness\u201d, her smile remained but her eyes turned cold.Mother Lin smiled and shook her head. \u201cOh, child. You are so skinny already. Why do you need to be in a diet?\u201dHearing Mother Lin\u2019s affectionate tone toward Ning Zhi, the guest next to them smiled and said, \u201cMrs. Lin is so doting to her niece.\u201dMother Lin said, \u201cXiao Zhi had been with us for so many years. I treat her the same way I treat Tiantian, my own daughter. Of course I dote on her.\u201d\u201cMiss Ning is so lucky to have an aunty like you.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Enough talking already. Have someone start serving the dishes already.\u201d Father Lin seemed unhappy about how nice Mother Lin was to Ning Zhi.Mother Lin gave Ning Zhi an apologetic look.For as long as Ning Zhi could remember, things had always been this way. As long as Mother Lin was nice to the original owner, Father Lin would express his discontent toward Mother Lin openly. That gave Ning Zhi the feeling that Mother Lin cared about her a lot.She did, however, notice that Father Lin had just poured a cup of tea for Mother Lin. He even placed it right next to her hand attentively.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cXiao Zhi, it\u2019s Mom\u2019s birthday today, how come you let Lu Jue dressed the way that he did\u2026\u2026\u201d Lin Tiantian\u2019s intention of having Ning Zhi brought Lu Jue was to show the others that she was able to married Lu Shenyuan when Ning Zhi only married the autistic Lu Jue.What she didn\u2019t expect was that Lu Jue dressed in such an ostentatious way and attracted all of the attention.Ning Zhi poured a glass of juice for Lu Jue and, hearing Lin Tiantian\u2019s words, she curved her lips and said, \u201cAnd exactly what\u2019s the problem with the way he dressed? It\u2019s Aunty\u2019s birthday, a day to celebrate. Red is the perfect color for the occasion.\u201dLin Tiantian was taken aback a little then, she switched to a lectured tone and said in an accusatory manner, \"He\u2019s red all over. Don\u2019t you think he is overshadowing Mom, who is the host of the day?\u201dThe corners of Ning Zhi\u2019s lips dropped a little and her tone nonchalant. \u201cAunty just said that she sees me as her own daughter. Are you saying now that she\u2019s the host and I\u2019m a guest?\u201dMother Lu gave Lin Tiantian a look, smiled and said to Ning Zhi. \u201cElders nowadays are not so rigid any more. Tiantian cares too much about what is appropriate.\u201dNing Zhi was always a smart one. She didn\u2019t miss the subtexts in Mother Lin\u2019s words.She wasn\u2019t sure earlier what kind of attitude she should have with Mother Lin, she did now.\u201cYes, the Lu family didn\u2019t have that many rules either.\u201d Ning Zhi scooted closer to Lu Jue, smiled and said, \u201cBesides, red looks great on Lu Jue. Have any of you ever seen anyone looking better in red than him?\u201dHer tone was filled with her pride for Lu Jue.Lin Tiantian felt that she was hallucinating. Was Ning Zhi just bragging about Lu Jue?Ning Zhi redirected the conversation suddenly, \u201cIf we really want to talk about what colors are appropriate, isn\u2019t the white color that you have one even more inappropriate? This is a birthday banquet, not a\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Tiantian turned pale. She hadn\u2019t expected Ning Zhi to behave like a completely different person. She was being so blunt and confrontational.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s stop chatting and start eating. The dishes had been served.\u201d Mother Lin wasn\u2019t looking too happy either. Her face dropped and she forced a smile on herself and urged the others to start dining.Afterward, Mother Lin and Father Lin only talked about Lu Shenyuan as though Lu Jue wasn\u2019t there at all.Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because she had already taken Lu Jue out into the public twice before or that she had saved him twice in the past, she noticed that even with so many people around him, Lu Jue was still only sitting there quietly. He did not grab her hand tightly from the fear of the crowd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Someone gave Lu Jue wine (2)Ning Zhi put some food into his bowl but he didn\u2019t seem to like them much and ate very little of them.Lu Jue was a very picky eater.At the Lu\u2019s, he had specific chefs that cooked for him. If he didn\u2019t like the dishes, he would rather eat plain rice and still not touch any of the other dishes.Ning Zhi ate a few bites symbolically and, as the banquet was boring and meaningless, was about to take off with Lu Jue.Mother Lin noticed Ning Zhi\u2019s impatience and said to her, \u201cXiao Zhi, don\u2019t take off just yet after dinner. I have something here for you?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.\u201cSomething left to you by your parents. I had been keeping them for you but, now that you are married, it is time to return them to you,\u201d said Mother Lin to her.Item left to her by her parents?Ning Zhi had no choice but to acknowledge her.Lu Jue, in his red plus his look, was very eye catching. The guests would look over at this Second Young Master Lu from time to time.He just sat there quietly and nobody could read him.Ning Zhi leaned into his ear and said to him, \u201cLu Jue, I need to make a trip to the bathroom. You sit here and wait for me. It won\u2019t be long. Okay?\u201dLu Jue blinked and looked at her blankly. Finally, he forced a grunt out from his throat, \u201cMmm.\u201dNing Zhi noticed that someone was in the first-floor bathroom so she headed up to the one on the second floor.When she returned to her spot after a long while, she noticed that Lu Jue had been drinking and the glass was almost empty.Ning Zhi snatched the glass from him and asked coldly, \u201cWho gave him wine?\u201dLin Tiantian said from across from her, \u201cHe just picked it up and started drinking. We didn\u2019t even notice it.\u201dShe put on a troubled look, \u201cYou know that he\u2019s autistic, it wasn\u2019t like we could stop him even if we noticed. He doesn\u2019t listen to anyone.\u201d\u201cAiya, I just stepped away to have the servant bring more food. Why is the Second Young Master drinking?\u201d Mother Lin walked over and said, \u201cIs he going to be alright? Can he drink?\u201dNing Zhi held his head with both of her hands and he just looked at her blanked. She could tell anything.\u201cMaybe you can take him upstairs first and rest up in the bedroom. The servants had been cleaning your room daily and it\u2019s very clean,\u201d said Mother Lin. \u201cI will bring the item to you after the guests are gone.\u201dNing Zhi nodded and walked upstairs while holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand, her face cold.She found the room from her memory.The room was not very big and the d\u00e9cor very girlish.Ning Zhi brought Lu Jue over to the bed. Compared to the bed in Lu Jue\u2019s room, this one was quite small. It looked even smaller when the tall Lu Jue with long legs sat down on it.\u201cHow much have you drunk? Do you feel dizzy?\u201d asked Ning Zhi, worried.There were wine on Lu Jue\u2019s lips and they had a nice glow to them. His cold and alabaster face had a hint of redness.He started unbuttoning his jacket with his slender fingers.\u201cDo you want to sleep?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.Lu Jue removed his red suit jack and started unbuttoning his black shirt.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to take this one off to sleep,\u201d said Ning Zhi as she placed her hand over his.\u201cHot.\u201d Lu Jue\u2019s voice was low and his lips pinched together slightly. \u201cHot, me.\u201dNing Zhi was a little surprised. \u201cYou are hot?\u201dLu Jue moved to remove his red suit pants.Ning Zhi, catching a glimpse of the floral rim, quickly put on hands over his again. \u201cYou can\u2019t remove this.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s lips were pinched shut and a black cloud appeared over his head.Ning Zhi gasped. \u201cNever mind. Take your shirt off but you must keep your pants on.\u201dLu Jue pointed at his own face, \u201cHot.\u201dNing Zhi reached out to touch his face. It felt good under her hand. It was almost as good as little Lu Jue\u2019s baby fat. His cheeks were a little hot. Was it from the alcohol?Lu Jue placed his cheeks comfortably on Ning Zhi\u2019s hand, enjoying the coolness.Perhaps that wasn\u2019t quite enough. Lu Jue moved to hug Ning Zhi. He rested his head where her shoulder was. Like a pitiful little thing, he repeatedly tried to push his cheeks onto the skin of her exposed neck.Ning Zhi could hear his deep voice next to her ear, \u201cTouch, me.\u201dNing Zhi, taken aback a little at first, chuckled. \u201cMmhmm. Go ahead.\u201dWhat she didn\u2019t see was that the little black clouds over Lu Jue\u2019s head disappeared and one after another sparling little sun popped out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - She almost coughed out blood (1)This was not the first time Ning Zhi hugged Lu Jue except, in the past, she was hugging the young Lu Jue who had a small body with the baby fat and the distinctly milky smell that could only belong to a child.But now, it was the adult Lu Jue that was in her arms.Unlike when he was a child, his body was broad, study, and smelled refreshing. With his warm cheek against her neck, Ning Zhi felt that where it came into contact with Lu Jue was about to start burning.\u201cWould you like some water?\u201d Ning Zhi tightened her lips some. She felt a little thirsty.Lu Jue nuzzled her on her shoulder. Then, like a restless little bug, he wouldn\u2019t stop wiggling. \u201cCool, you.\u201dDid he think that she is cool?Ning Zhi found that odd. \u201cLu Jue, how much did you drink?\u201dLu Jue\u2019s dark eyes turned limp. Still dazed, he said, \u201c2.\u201dTwo glasses.Ning Zhi couldn't help but frowned.She didn\u2019t drink and when the servant was serving wine, she had them skipped over herself and Lu Jue. There weren\u2019t even wine glasses at their spots.So someone fed Lu Jue wine intentionally?Ning Zhi\u2019s face dropped.Suddenly, Lu Jue\u2019s arms around her waist tightened as though he wish his entire body could rub up against hers.Ning Zhi almost couldn\u2019t breathe from his hug. She wooed him gently. \u201cAre you very hot? Do you feel any other discomfort besides being hot?\u201dShe tried to struggle free from him. \u201cI\u2019ll nap with you for a little while. You will feel better when you wake up.\u201dLu Jue said nothing.Ning Zhi had no choice but reached for his head that was buried in her neck. As soon as she had lifted his head up, she immediately saw the three shiny little suns in the indicator above his head.Another one popped out when she was staring at them.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes widened.That were FOUR of them!She had no idea what had happened. Did Lu Jue enjoy drinking?Cupping his cheeks with her hands, she studied him carefully. His cold and alabaster skin had a red glow and his cherry-blossom eyes were black and bright. The silly little thing wasn\u2019t afraid to look at her this time. She could see herself reflected in his clear and limpid eyes.\u201cTouch, me.\u201d Lu Jue\u2019s voice was deep and dull, as though he was displeased that she wasn\u2019t hugging him.Looking at the little suns over his head, Ning Zhi was in a very good mood. Then she recalled that he was happy from the alcohol and she felt that she must gave him a lecture. \u201cDrinking is bad for you. I can\u2019t drink again in the future.\u201dLuckily she was with him this time. If he was drunk next time, someone was bad intents could easily kidnap him.Ning Zhi was worried sick. \u201cEven boys need to protect themselves when are out of their house!\u201dShe stroked Lu Jue\u2019s amazingly handsome face. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201dThe moment that she touched him all four little suns flew toward Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved immediately.Feeling the coolness from the tips of her fingers, Lu Jue rubbed up against her hands happily like a moaning little puppy.She let go of him and his face followed.Ning Zhi found that comical. She was being mean and asked him purposefully, \u201cYou want me to hug you some more?\u201dLu Jue looked at her.With this opportunity, Ning Zhi wanted to bully Lu Jue. \u201cBeg me. I will only hug you if you beg me.\u201d\u201cHurry up and beg.\u201d She didn\u2019t even need to look into a mirror to know that she looked very much like a hooligan right now.Lu Jue went silent. After a long while, as though words were forced out of his throat, \u201cHug me, please.\u201dPlease hug me.The top two buttons of Lu Jue\u2019s shirt were unbuttoned and the perfect contour of his chin could be seen. Then there was his sexily protruding Adam's apple. He had a very restrained-looking face but it looked dazed and at loss.Ning Zhi felt that not even a deity could resist a seductive man like him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - She almost coughed out blood (2)She stopped teasing him and put her arms around his waist.Through the thick layer of fabric, Ning Zhi could feel the heat radiating from his body burning up her palms.Lu Jue snuggled up to her tightly, greedy for the coolness of her body.She wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because he was feeling very comfortable but she saw that his indicator that had just been cleaned out started to produce little suns again.One!Two!Three!\u2026\u2026As Ning Zhi was hugging Lu Jue, the little suns rushed toward Ning Zhi as soon as they appeared.The Overlord couldn't help but popped its head out. His milky voice was so excited that it was shaky. [Host\u2026\u2026 you are dirt rich now!]He felt that he was so lucky to have a host that could become dirt rich at any moment. As opposed to his poor brother Riches, who had to beg his host to go and collect golden cotton candies every time.Another little sun appeared above Lu Jue\u2019s head and Ning Zhi, too, felt that she was about to strike it rich.Lu Jue was no silly little thing; he was the God of Wealth! A sun mine!Perhaps she should consider having Lu Jue drinking a little more next time?Someone knocked on the door suddenly.Ning Zhi had no choice but to let go of Lu Jue.She opened up the door and saw Mother Lin standing outside of her door.\u201cHow\u2019s Second Young Master Lu? Is he okay after having the alcohol?\u201d Mother Lin came up and asked the first chance she got. She worried that the Lu family would be unhappy if anything was to happen to Lu Jue.\u201cHe is drunk.\u201d\u201cDrunk?\u201d Mother Lin was surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t he just drink a few sips? I\u2019ll have the kitchen prepare some sobering soup and have someone bring it over in a little bit.\u201dNing Zhi studied Mother Lu carefully and it didn\u2019t look like she was faking it. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I am sure he will feel better after a little bit of rest.\u201dLooking at the little box that Mother Lin was carrying in her hand, she asked, \u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cInside is what your parents had left for you.\u201d Mother Lin handed her the little box. \u201cYou were still young back then so I had kept it for you. Nor do I wish to see you sad when you saw it.\u201dNing Zhi took the little box from her.She saw a picture when she opened it up. It was one of her with her parents when she was just a child. Under the picture there was a jade stamp. There was a small \u201cNing\u201d carved on the little white jade stamp.Mother Lin sighed and said, \u201cBe sure to keep it somewhere safe.\u201dShe had always cared about her niece.Ning Zhi was a very pretty girl and she had always wanted her to marry into an influential family. It would not only help out the Lin family but Ning Zhi would also live a comfortable life. There were some selfish intents in it but her care for Ning Zhi was real.Ning Zhi did not have the status to marry into the Lu family originally. That was Tiantian\u2019s idea. Tiantian had Ning Zhi go visit her at the Lu family and, lo and behold, Mother Lu really had an eye for Ning Zhi.From Mother Lin\u2019s perspective, there are not influential family greater than the Lu family. Tiantian had already married into them. With the addition of Ning Zhi, the two families would be tied together for good.\u201cMom.\u201d Lin Tiantian showed up out of nowhere and, looking at the two standing by the door, asked with a smile, \u201cWhat are you and Xiao Zhi chatting about?\u201dLin Tiantian saw Ning Zhi holding a small jade jewelry when she looked over at Ning Zhi.\u201cI am giving Xiao Zhi what her parents had left for her.\u201d Mother Lin asked her, \u201cHow come you are coming up here? Don\u2019t you need to stay with Shenyuan?\u201dLin Tiantian said coquettishly, \u201cDad is dominating the conversation with him. I can\u2019t squeeze a word in between the two of them.\u201dMother Lin smiled. \u201cShenyuan doesn\u2019t come very often. I am sure your father has a lot he wanted to talk to Shenyuan about on the rare occasions that he is over.\u201d She turned to Ning Zhi and said, \u201cI am going to see check on the guests. If you have any problems over here, have a servant help you out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - She almost coughed out blood (3)After Mother Lin had left, Lin Tiantian walked over to Ning Zhi. \u201cXiao Zhi, I want to talk to you.\u201d\u201cWhat about?\u201d Ning Zhi tightened her lips some. \u201cAbout why you gave alcohol to Lu Jue?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Lin Tiantian was shocked. \u201cWhy would I do such a thing? What would I get out of that?\u201dShe looked carefully at Ning Zhi. \u201cWhy would you think that? I feel that your attitude toward me have changed recently.\u201dNing Zhi looked at her coldly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain yourself. I know it was you.\u201dEven with no evidences, Ning Zhi still knew that it was Lin Tiantian who did it.The reason was simple. She wanted Lu Jue to embarrass himself in front of everyone and thereby giving Ning Zhi a hard time.Overlord had mentioned that the worse her life was, the unhappy she was, the easier it was for Lin Tiantian to steal her halo from her. Lin Tiantian had been setting the original owner up all along in the past.\u201cWhat is up with you, Xiao Zhi?\u201d Lin Tiantian frowned.The wine was poured by the servant and every guest had a glass. There was one at Ning Zhi\u2019s spot and one at Lu Jue\u2019s. The alcoholic content was very high.She had expected that Lu Jue would for sure made a scene at the banquet after two glasses.And Ning Zhi would, therefore, felt very embarrassed for having married such a husband. She would hate Lu Jue even more and also her days with the Lu family.Sadly, she didn\u2019t think that Ning Zhi would be back so soon and pulled Lu Jue away with her.Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t believe that Ning Zhi had any actual proof. After all, she didn\u2019t plan any of these intentionally. She knew that sometimes what took place unintentionally and leaving no traces behind would appear more genuine.Besides, she was not so stupid that she would try to set Lu Jue up at the Lin family\u2019s banquet and leave evidences behind.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t bother arguing with her. \u201cI\u2019m a very petty person. Whatever others did to hurt me, I will double that when I return the favor.\u201d She curved her lips some and said, \u201cLet me think. What is it that you care about the most?\u201dLin Tiantian was baffled by what Ning Zhi was saying.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t care about Lin Tiantian\u2019s reaction and just slammed the door close in front of her.What Lin Tiantian cared about the most was her halo and that fake look of hers.Looking at the 10 sparkling suns in her mind, she said, \u201cOverlord, exchange 10% of my halo for me!\u201dOverlord\u2019s milky voice was very cheery. [No problem, Host!]After trading in 10 little suns in one go, Ning Zhi saw that the color of her hands lightened up instantly.Outside of the door, Lin Tiantian walked downstairs, irritated. She still looked somewhat unhappy when she got back to Lu Shenyuan.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lu Shenyuan took a look at his wife and was a little surprised.Noticing the surprise in his eyes, she put her disgruntlement toward Ning Zhi aside and asked him shyly, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cYour face\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about my face?\u201d Lin Tiantian knew that she was pretty and, sometimes, Lu Shenyuan would zone out while staring at her.She pulled out her little cosmetic mirror and she was stunned when she looked into the mirror.She had inherited Mother Lin\u2019s face shape with prominent cheek bones and a square face. Ever since she had stolen Ning Zhi\u2019s halo, her face shape had self-corrected and turned slowly into a beautiful tapering shape.And now, her cheek bones were showing. They were not as prominent as they were before but her face was also not as delicate as it once was.Meeting Lu Shenyuan\u2019s inquisitive look, she quickly covered up her cheeks with her hands and went on to explain, \u201cI ate too much lately.\u201dHer mind raced. What was going on?After she had exchanged for her halo, Ning Zhi went back to the bed.When she saw Lu Jue lying in bed, topless with only his pair of colorful underwear for the bottom, she almost coughed out blood!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - A crack on the jade (1)Today Lu Jue had on a bright red underwear with large blue flowers!The color could hurt one\u2019s eyes. It was both loud and crude. Lucky Lu Jue had a nice body and was able to handle the floral color combination.Ning Zhi walked over to him and, startled by the bulge on him, quickly averted her eyes.\u201cPut your clothes back on!\u201d said Ning Zhi as she pulled the blanket over Lu Jue.Meeting Lu Jue\u2019s clear and limpid eyes, Ning Zhi let out a sigh. She knew that autistic individuals do not have the concept of sex nor a sense of shyness.Lu Jue\u2019s lips were pinched shut. No more little suns appeared inside of his indicator.He wanted to flip the blanket over.Ning Zhi quickly walked up and held it down. \u201cPut your clothes back on first.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s eyelids were thin. With some alcohol in him, there were a pink color. His straight and long lashes shuddered. \u201cHot, me.\u201dI am hot.Albeit looking tender, the words coming from Ning Zhi was cruel. \u201cJust put up with it. You will feel better once the alcohol subsides.\u201dIt crossed Ning Zhi\u2019s mind that she would let him experience some discomfort. That way he would learn of some evilness in this world and see if he would have alcohol again next time. Then she recalled that Lu Jue was bullied a lot as a child and he had already experienced too much evilness.Ning Zhi stroked his burning cheek and said, \u201cI will take you with me wherever I go next time.\u201dHis lips pinched shut, Lu Jue grunted as though he was not feeling very comfortable.With the outline from the blanket, she seemed to be able to see the stirring beneath the blanket.Ning Zhi turned her head away. Hearing the soft rustling noises, the redness rose from her neck up and even the tips of her ears turned red.She felt extremely ashamed.Her hand that was holding onto the blanket never let go of it. She finally turned her head back when she heard a soft grunt coming from next to her.Meeting Lu Jue\u2019s blank and clear eyes, she felt as though she had been burned and quickly let go of the blanket.Ning Zhi stood up and tightened her dried lips a little. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. We need to head out. Put your clothes back on quickly.\u201dThere were sweat on Lu Jue\u2019s forehead and desire in his pitch-black eyes mixed with some blankness. He did not say anything after hearing what Ning Zhi had said but put his clothes back on quietly.***Mother Lu had just gotten back from the auction when Ning Zhi and Lu Jue got home.Mother Lu was very happy when she saw her son standing quietly next to Ning Zhi. Her son had been going out with Ning Zhi more frequently lately. Unlike the last 6 months where he had stayed home mostly, refusing to go out.Seeing her son in his red suit looking both handsome and lively, the smile on Mother Lu thickened.After Mother Lu had the servant fetch them tea, she wanted to hold her son\u2019s and brought him over to where the couch was. But Lu Jue avoided her before she could even come into contact with her.He started walking upstairs with his head lowered.Noticing the lonely look in Mother Lu\u2019s eyes, Ning Zhi took Mother Lu\u2019s outreached hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m tired too, Ma. Let me sit with you for a little while.\u201dMother Lu patted Ning Zhi on her hand and said, \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone said that daughters are like a snuggly-fitted little cotton jacket. It\u2019s so much better to have daughters.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a little cotton jacket.\u201d Sitting down with Mother Lu on the couch, Ning Zhi said in an appeasing way, \u201cI am a sweet cotton candy.\u201dMother Lu paused a little, then busted out laughing. Ning Zhi was a sweet talker. No wonder Lu Jue would listen to her.\u201cHow did Xiao Jue do at the banquet today?\u201d Lu Jue was what Mother Lu cared about the most.\u201cHe is less nervous in a crowded place now. Maybe a little nervous at the beginning. But he will start to relax after a little while if there is someone familiar there with him.\u201dEven though Ning Zhi didn\u2019t spell it out, but Mother Lu knew that the \u201cfamiliar person\u201d could only be Ning Zhi. \u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - A crack on the jade (2)\u201cIt\u2019s not hard work. I enjoy taking care of Lu Jue,\u201d said Ning Zhi.Mother Lu was aware of Ning Zhi\u2019s abrupt change in attitude but she had no interest in finding out the reason behind that. As long as Ning Zhi was nice to Lu Jue, she would be nice to Ning Zhi.\u201cMa, I want to learn more about Lu Jue\u2019s childhood. Can you tell me more?\u201d Ning Zhi felt that if she could find out more about Lu Jue\u2019s childhood, that would be beneficial to her saving him.As a mother, Mother Lu was only too happy to talk about her son. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d\u201cHad he been bullied as a child, or suffered any injury or illness? Something along that line.\u201dMother Lu was surprised by Ning Zhi\u2019s abrupt questions.As though recalling from her memory, \u201cXiao Jue was a special case. He was different from other children. I recalled that he liked hiding inside the closet for a while there and refused to come out no matter what I said to him. The doctor said that was one way that autistic people protect themselves.\u201dMother Lu carried on. \u201cThen there was this one time when he almost got lost. I was so worried that I was up all night.\u201dNing Zhi had done some reading on it. It was easy for autistic individuals to get lost.In addition, they don\u2019t know how to communicate with others so they would not ask for directions when they are lost. Sometimes, they wouldn\u2019t even know to avoid the cars on the streets. That could be very dangerous.Mother Lu did not sound disgruntled when she talked about these. She did not feel that Lu Jue was a burden.Ning Zhi chatted with Mother Lu some more before Mother Lu pulled out a gift box that she had brought back from the auction.She handed it over to Ning Zhi.\u201cThis is\u2026...\u201d Ning Zhi opened up the box and sitting inside of it was a broach with a red gem. The gem was red like blood and its color mesmerizing.\u201cI just got this from the auction. Keep it,\u201d said Mother Lu with a smile. \u201cOnly young people like you will look good with bright color like this.\u201dNing Zhi could tell the value of the broach with just one look. Even if the gem on the broach was not the best of it best, it was still a rare one. It must have cost at least 8 million yuan, if not more.She didn\u2019t think that Mother Lu would give her a gem now right after she had given her the jade bracelet.Ning Zhi suddenly realized that it was amazing to have a generous mother-in-law!Lin Tiantian happened to walk in right now and saw Ning Zhi putting on the broach given to her by Mother Lu. Pausing a little on her way, her eyes dimmed a little.Not only did Ning Zhi\u2019s attitude toward her had changed, she had also learned to fawn over Mother Lu.Walking toward them, Lin Tiantian mindlessly looked at Ning Zhi\u2019s face. She suddenly noticed that Ning Zhi had become lighter.She wasn\u2019t very light but nobody knew about the change in Ning Zhi\u2019s appearance better than her. Lin Tiantian recalled the change in her own face shape. She panicked a little. Could the two incidents be somehow related?Lin Tiantian hurried back to her room after she had greeted Mother Lu.She removed the necklace from her neck. The jade pendant is shiny. As she had taken away all of Ning Zhi\u2019s halo, she hadn\u2019t been paying the jade too much attention lately.When she looked at it carefully, she finally noticed a tiny crack on top of the white jade.Why did that happen?Had she bumped it inadvertently some time?Now that her cheek bones started showing a little and Ning Zhi had become a tad lighter. For sure both had something to do with the crack on the surface of the jade.The thought made Lin Tiantian worry after the fact. If the jade was broken, did the mean she would return to her old self?Lin Tiantian looked at the tiny crack on the jade and her heart ached. Now that she was aware of it, she must do her best in protecting this piece of jade going forward.She carefully put the necklace back on and placed it inside her collar, hiding it against her flesh.Lin Tiantian wasn\u2019t too worried that Ning Zhi had become lighter. All she needed to do was to get the halo back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - A crack on the jade (3)That night.Lin Tiantian had another dream.She dreamt that Ning Zhi went over to a certain place with the little jade stamp. It looked to be a mansion of some rich people.Ning Zhi then handed the little jade stamp over to an old man.The dream was in bits and pieces.Lin Tiantian saw that Ning Zhi became more glamorous. Like the moon surrounding by all the stars, she was the envy of everyone.As for herself, she could only look from the entrance from afar. Watching as Ning Zhi became the princess that was doted upon. Even without her parents, Ning Zhi was still doted by her\u2026\u2026Lin Tiantian woke up startled. She suddenly recalled the little jade stamp that her mother had given Ning Zhi earlier that day.Lin Tiantian couldn\u2019t see the people in her dream clearly but she knew that the little jade stamp was very important and that she could not let Ning Zhi has it.She must find a way to get it from Ning Zhi.Lin Tiantian took a look at Lu Shenyuan, who was sleeping soundly next to her, and walked out of the room lightly.She was just about to go downstairs when she run into Ning Zhi in the hallway holding a glass of milk in her hand.\u201cXiao Zhi, you are up late tonight,\u201d said Lin Tiantian as she walked up to Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi raised her brows, \u201cCan\u2019t we say the same about you?\u201dAs though she didn\u2019t notice the coldness from Ning Zhi, Lin Tiantian smiled and said, \u201cI saw my mom giving you a small jade stamp earlier today. It looked delicate and pretty. I got into collecting pretty jades lately. Can I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dNing Zhi cut her off right away. \u201cThat\u2019s from my dead parents. Don\u2019t get any ideas.\u201d Ning Zhi had no idea why Lin Tiantian was interested in that.Lin Tiantian bit her lip. \u201cI just want to take a look.\u201d\u201cNo, not even one look.\u201d Ning Zhi took a sip of her milk and snickered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me take a look at the necklace that you are wearing?\u201dLin Tiantian put her hand over the necklace reflexively. \u201cThis had been blessed. I can\u2019t just let anyone touch it\u2026\u2026\u201dNing Zhi\u2019s eyes were filled with mockery. \u201cThat\u2019s not double standard at all.\u201dLin Tiantian turned pale.After returning to her room, Ning Zhi quickly moved the box with the jade stamp somewhere more hidden and even locked it up.She finally returned to bed when she confirmed that it was safe.Lu Jue had already fallen asleep. Recalling what he had done under the blanket today, Ning Zhi\u2019s face burned a little.Recollecting herself, Ning Zhi summoned Overlord. \u201cHow many little suns will it cost on my next trip to help Lu Jue?\u201dOverlord quickly told her: [Host, it will cost 5 little suns this time.]Here Ning Zhi thought she was so rich with the 16 little suns that she had gotten today. Little did she know, she had to spend another 5 little suns to help Lu Jue now after she had exchanged 10 of them for her halo. She was down to one little sun in the blink of an eye.Overlord quickly put away the 5 little suns from Ning Zhi. His milky voice was filled with excitement. [Good luck and save travelling.]Ning Zhi opened up her eyes again.She looked at her hands. She skin was light and tender and her fingers petite and delicate. Her finger tips were a hint of cherry-blossom pink. It looked like she was back to her original self.She feet were still bare but it would not get dusty from stepping onto the ground.Ning Zhi started looking around. The surrounding did not look familiar to her. She did not appear at the Lu\u2019s residence this time.Did that mean little Lu Jue was nearby?\u201cHurry up. PE class is about to start.\u201d\u201cDo you think that fool will tell on us to the teacher?\u201d\u201cOf course not. He doesn\u2019t like to talk. He\u2019s like a mute.\u201d\u201cThe fool is very timid. I am sure he is crying inside the bathroom by now.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s pretend to be ghost and scare him till he pees his pants next time we lock him up.\u201d\u2026\u2026Hearing what the boys were saying behind her, Ning Zhi quickly turned around. Her first reaction was that Lu Jue was the fool that they were talking about.They locked Lu Jue up in the restroom?The bell rang and the surrounding quieted down. Many children quickly ran toward their classrooms.Including those boys.Ning Zhi frowned and went quickly to look for the restroom.Ning Zhi spotted the sign that pointed to the restroom from the direction where the boys came from.Standing in front of the men\u2019s restroom, Ning Zhi peeked and only walked inside when she confirmed that there was nobody there.All of the stalls were empty until Ning Zhi got to the very last one. She saw that the door was tied shut by a rope from the outside.\u201cXiao Juejue, are you inside?\u201d Ning Zhi wanted to untie the ropes but her hand went through the door knob. She wasn\u2019t able to touch the rope.She went straight through the door into the stall.The last stall in the restroom was very narrow and small. It was usually the one that the cleaning staff used for storage. Trash cans, garbage bags, mops, and water buckets took up a lot of the room.Little Lu Jue with his little body squatted inside the stall. His head lowered and he put his arms around his knees quietly.Ning Zhi\u2019s heart ached as though it had been squeezed all of a sudden.Squatting down, she leaned into his ear and said softly to him, \u201cXiao Juejue, big sister is here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - \u201cDo you want to be my boyfriend?\u201d (1)Little Lu Jue looked up, blinking his big black eyes. He had a blank look on him.He had grown since the last time Ning Zhi had seen him.Ning Zhi noticed that most of the baby fat on his cheeks were gone with just a little bit chubbiness remaining. His features were delicate and he was already a pretty little boy.Looking at the blank look on little Lu Jue, Ning Zhi reached out to pinch his cheek. The softness of his cheek still felt very good in her hand. \u201cDo you still remember me?\u201dThe big, black eyes looked over at Ning Zhi, then turned away.Ning Zhi did not force little Lu Jue to recognize her. It had already been the few years since they had last met. She was certain that the little boy had already forgotten about her.Ning Zhi started examining his body. She let out a sigh of relief when she noticed that he was not hurt. \u201cAre you scared, Xiao Juejue? I\u2019ll get you out of here.\u201dIf a normal child was locked up, they would be so scared that they would bang on the door, cry for help, or started to cry. But that was not little Lu Jue.He would just sit there quietly when he was locked up.His quiet personality made him an easy target and always got the short end of the stick.Ning Zhi stood up, wanting to bring the child with her. She suddenly realized that she could go through the door but the door was still locked. She had no way of getting little Lu Jue out.She felt regretful. She was able to visit the correct time but she was not able to touch anything solid. There was a lot of limitations being placed on her and that made it very difficult for her to save him.Ning Zhi sighed. It was class time right now and there was nobody nearby. They could only shout out for help after the classes were over.\u201cXiao Juejue.\u201d Ning Zhi squatted back down and chatted with little Lu Jue. She had no idea how many times he had been locked up before she came.Little Lu Jue was unresponsive.Ning Zhi cupped his cheeks with her hands. His eyelids fluttered, not daring to look straightly at her.\u201cI will stay here with you. You don\u2019t need to be frightened.\u201dLittle Lu Jue looked up at her quickly, then lowered his eyes again.Ning Zhi started nagging him. \u201cNext time they bully you, you need to shout for help. You can\u2019t just let others have their ways with you. There are too many of them and you can\u2019t fight them off. Remember to tell your mother when you get home.\u201cXiao Juejue is so docile and so cute. You don\u2019t deserve to be bullied.\u201cYou must tell your mother when you get home. Xiao Juejue. You need to learn to tell on others. They are only bullying you because you are too docile. And that you don\u2019t cry.\u201cThat\u2019s right. You must cry. Whenever someone bully you, you will bawl. That way everybody knew that you are wronged.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cWeird big sister,\u201d said little Lu Jue all of a sudden.His voice was still a little bit milky, childish, and crisp. Even though he only spoken softly, Ning Zhi could still tell that he was talking about her.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes lit up all of a sudden. \u201cYou remember me?\u201dLittle Lu Jue pinched his lips shut and went silent again.He recognized her, right?Ning Zhi was so happy that she couldn't help but gave his cheeks a good rubbing. \u201cDid Xiao Juejue miss big sister?\u201dAfter a little while, little Lu Jue finally said slowly, \u201cMiss I.\u201dI missed you.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved. She was back to her pretty self now and her beautiful black eyes looked like they were decorated by stars. Her eyes curved and it looked like the sparkling stars were escaping from her eyes. \u201cRight, right, right. I missed Xiao Juejue. Big Sister thought about you every day.\u201dUpon hearing that, little Lu Jue looked up at Ning Zhi one more time. He blinked his big black eyes and said again, \u201cStrange, big sister.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - \u201cDo you want to be my boyfriend?\u201d (2)Ning Zhi corrected her, \u201cI am so pretty. I am sister angel. And sister angel only to you.\u201dlittle Lu Jue was a stubborn one. \u201cStrange big sister.\u201dNing Zhi couldn't help but pinched his chubby little cheek and said resentfully, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell what\u2019s pretty at your age. And it is even worse after you\u2019ve grown up.\u201d\u201cTeacher, right here.\u201d Suddenly, a little girl\u2019s voice could be heard. \u201cI saw them taking Classmate Lu Jue inside.\u201dThen came a man\u2019s voice. \u201cTeacher will go and check it out now. You go back to your classroom.\u201d\u201cTeacher, I am sure that Lu Jue had been bullied by them. I saw them rummaging through Lu Jue\u2019s backpack after class last time then tossed it onto the ground and stomped on it. They were such bad people but none of the kids in class dare to tell on them.\u201d The little girl continued to tell the teacher.\u201cAlright, Teacher will look into it. They will be punished if what you said are true.\u201dNing Zhi was pleasantly surprised when she heard footsteps. \u201cXiao Juejue, someone\u2019s here. Shout, quickly.\u201dNing Zhi could hear the door being opened. She turned to look at Lu Jue and saw the little kid\u2019s mouth pinched shut, making not a single sound. She grabbed his hand and smacked on the door.Smacking sound rang repeated.Outside of the stall, the male teacher heard the sound coming from the last stall. He ran over quickly and asked, \u201cLu Jue, are you inside?\u201dNing Zhi smacked the door again with little Lu Jue\u2019s hand.\u201cGive me a second. Teacher will open the door for you now.\u201d The male teacher pushed the door, only to found out that the door hand was tied down by a rope. It looked like what the girl had told him was true. The other kids played a prank and locked Lu Jue inside of there.The teacher quickly undid the rope and opened up the door. He saw Lu Jue who was squatting inside the stall.The child looked very pitiful squatting there in his little body.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Teacher will get you out now.\u201d The teacher wanted to help little Lu Jue up but, before he could make contact with Lu Jue, little Lu Jue had already avoided his hand.The teacher knew that this child in his class was autistic and said, \u201cAlright, Teacher won\u2019t touch you. Why don\u2019t you stand up on your own?\u201dNing Zhi quickly help little Lu Jue up and said to him gently, \u201cLet\u2019s follow this teacher out.\u201dThe teacher only turned and walked toward the exit when he saw that Lu Jue had stood up. \u201cI will let your class teacher know of this incident.\u201dHe was just a physical education teacher. He did not have the authority to punish misbehaved students. He could only inform their class teacher.After returning to class, little Lu Jue sat there quietly. There wasn\u2019t much expression on him. If it was any other kids, they would be bawling and telling the teacher what had happened by now.Sitting next to him, Ning Zhi poked at his little hand with the tip of her finger. \u201cXiao Juejue, I am your deskmate again.\u201d She teased him on purpose. \u201cYou need to take good care of me.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t sure whether little Lu Jue had comprehended what she had said but he reflexively thrusted his chest out and stood up straight.Suddenly, a little girl walked over. She smacked the top of the table and said to Lu Jue, \u201cI was the one who got the teacher to go help you when you were locked up in the bathroom. I am your savior now and you cannot ignore me from now on.\u201dNing Zhi recognized the little girl\u2019s voice. She was probably the girl outside of the bathroom earlier.The little girl Wushuang very cute. She continued to tell little Lu Jue, \u201cI just saw Liang Dong and his gang taken to the teacher\u2019s lounge by their class teacher. I am sure they will be scolded.\u201cLu Jue, why are you still ignoring me?\u201d The little girl placed both of her hands over little Lu Jue\u2019s desk, pouting in dissatisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ve saved you. Will you like me now?\u201dNing Zhi rested her chin on her palm. Psst. little Lu Jue was so cute. All the other students wanted to be friends with him.Leaning into his ear, Ning Zhi said to him. \u201cXiao Juejue, you can\u2019t be so cold to others. You need to make more friends. This little girl had helped you earlier. You can be friends with her.\u201d\u201cLu Jue, I am going to get mad if you continue to ignore me.\u201d The little girl has on pretty and clean clothes. It was obvious that she was one that was pampered at home. \u201cYou are the only one that I like in class. Do you want to be my boyfriend?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - \u201cDo you want to be my boyfriend?\u201d (3)Next to her, Ning Zhi was so startled that her chin had fell off her palm and she almost fall down entirely.Kids matured so early nowadays?She quickly leaned into little Lu Jue\u2019s ear. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t accept that. You are still a kid, you need to study hard and not think about anything else.\u201dNing Zhi told him, \u201cA student must study hard. Xiao Juejue should not be in a relationship until you are attending university.\u201dShe thought about it some then changed her tune selfishly. \u201cYou should focus on your school work even when you are attending university.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want little Lu Jue to be experienced in relationships.Little Lu Jue\u2019s lowered eyelids fluttered some. He then looked up at the little girl and said to her, \u201cNot like.\u201dThe little girl seemed to be shocked. She stomped her feet and said angrily, \u201cThen I won\u2019t like you from now on either. Nor will I go and save you. I won\u2019t help you even when you are bullied.\u201dHaving said that, the little girl ran back to her own seat.Ning Zhi felt that kids nowadays matured so early. When she was going to grade school, all she thought about all day long was which pretty dress to wear every day and what to eat for dessert.\u201cXiao Juejue, you can be good friends with that little girl but not\u2026\u2026\u201d Meeting little Lu Jue\u2019s blank look, Ning Zhi gave up on explaining. Never mind, what would this silly little thing know?Mother Lu came when school was out.She had on a delicate matching set. On the top was a light blue suit jacket and matching a matching skirt on the bottom. She was poised and elegant. Her being there attracted the attention of many students and other parents.Mother Lu got inside the car with little Lu Jue and Lu Shenyuan. Ning Zhi went through the car again and sat in the passenger seat.She turned to look at Mother Lu and noticed that she didn\u2019t look any different from usual. Did the teacher not tell her that little Lu Jue was locked up in the bathroom?Ning Zhi frowned. Or that he hadn\u2019t gotten around to telling her yet?After they had returned to the Lu\u2019s residence, little Lu Jue went upstairs quietly with his backpack on his back, completely ignoring Mother Lu\u2019s caring look.Lu JingYan, on the other hand, told Mother Lu politely that he was going to return to his room and work on his homework assignments.\u201cWait.\u201d Mother Lu stopped Lu Shenyuan. \u201cYour father and I are attending a old grandpa\u2019s birthday banquet tonight. We already have your clothes ready for you in the bedroom. We will take you with us tonight.\u201dLu Shenyuan looked very happy. He asked in a very mature way, \u201cWhat about little brother? Will he be coming with?\u201dMother Lu sighed. \u201cYour little brother doesn\u2019t like going places with a lot of people.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will go change now.\u201d Lu Shenyuan\u2019s voice sounded light and brisk.\u201cOkay, you go.\u201dNing Zhi saw Mother Lu turning and telling the butler about preparing dinner for little Lu Jue.They weren\u2019t going to bring little Lu Jue with?Ning Zhi knew that little Lu Jue would be frightened and lose control of himself when going places where there were a lot of people. It was best to have him stay home.Nevertheless, she felt an inexplicable heartache.Ning Zhi went upstairs but she didn\u2019t see little Lu Jue when she went inside his room.\u201cXiao Juejue?\u201d Didn\u2019t he return to his room?Ning Zhi looked inside the bathroom and the patio. There was nobody there. Nor was he in the hallway, home theater, or study.Was the little kid hiding?Finally, Ning Zhi returned to his room again. As soon as she sat down on the chair, she happened to notice a corner of his cloth sticking out of the closet. There was a small cartoon drawing on it. It was the same one that little Lu Jue was wearing today.Ning Zhi walked over and stood in front of the closet. She recalled Mother Lu had mentioned that there was one day when she suddenly couldn\u2019t find Lu Jue and only later on did she find him hiding inside the closet and refused to come out.Ning Zhi tightened her lips.She opened up the closet door reflexively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Little Lu Jue was bullied again (1)Light went through the crack of the door and lightened up an alabaster and cute little face.Ning Zhi saw little Lu Jue sitting there quietly against the closet in his red outfit with his two short legs pulled up.Little Lu Jue gave Ning Zhi a quick look and quickly lowered his head again.\u201cXiao Juejue, so you are here, huh? I have been looking for you all over.\u201dNing Zhi didn\u2019t blame him for hiding. She bent down and also climbed inside the closet. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark inside there. Let me come and keep you company.\u201dThe inside of the closet was not very spacious and it was even more crowded after Ning Zhi climbed inside.Inside of the closet dimmed a lot after she closed the closet door again.It was dark and quiet.That was what the world was like under Lu Jue\u2019s little hard shell.Ning Zhi blinked and get rid of the achiness of her eyes. \u201cXiao Juejue, I am afraid of the dark. Can I hold your hand?\u201dLittle Lu Jue next to her didn\u2019t say anything.Ning Zhi said in a low voice. \u201cDid those bullies scare you today?\u201d She wooed him. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I am worse than the bullies and I will take care of them for you.\u201dThe closet was filled with the little kiddo\u2019s clothes and all of them very soft to the touch with his milky smell.Ning Zhi wanted to tease him some more when, a soft little hand reached over, touched her on her wrist, and made its way into her palm.The little hand made an effort to hold hers and, next to her ear, Ning Zhi could hear little Lu Jue\u2019s childish voice. \u201cHold, you.\u201dNing Zhi, taken aback a little, reflexively held the little hand tight.Little Lu Jue said again, \u201cTimid you. Afraid of dark.\u201dFor some inexplicable reason, Ning Zhi could tell a hint of resentment and more pride in his voice.Her eyes curved from smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m timid. Xiao Juejue is so courageous.\u201dLight came in through the crack and inside of the closet was no longer dark and quiet.\u201cXiao Juejue, hold me tighter.\u201cBig sister suddenly is not afraid of the dark with you here.\u201cXiao Juejue, are you tired from sitting there? Would you like me to hold you?\u201cXiao Juejue, big sister\u2019s legs had gone numb.\u201d\u2026\u2026The butler finally located their young master inside of the closet. He heard the little young master talking to himself inside of the closet.He opened the closet up and saw him sitting there by himself. \u201cLittle Young Master, why are you hiding inside the closet?\u201dWhen the servants couldn\u2019t locate the little young master, they were just about to call up Master and Madam.\u201cMadam and Master are not home today. The kitchen had already prepared your dinner, little young master. It\u2019s time to go eat.\u201d The butler\u2019s mannerism was very mild.Little Lu Jue ignored the butler.Nj wooed him. \u201cXiao Juejue, let\u2019s get out. Big sister\u2019s legs had gone numb already.\u201dShe held onto his hand.Little Lu Jue did not object to that and he allowed Ning Zhi to guide him out of the closet docilely.Watching as the butler closed up the closet, Ning Zhi told little Lu Jue. \u201cDon\u2019t hide inside the closet anymore. I worry that it will be difficult to find you next time.\u201dLittle Lu Jue did not respond to her.After a long while, Ning Zhi finally heard the little kiddo said to her, \u201cNo, hide.\u201dNing Zhi couldn't help but rubbed him on his little head. \u201cHow is Xiao Juejue so docile and nice?\u201dLittle Lu Jue lowered his eyes and the tips of his soft little ears turned red.Neither Mother Lu or Father Lu were home and, other than the servants, there was only a little body dining inside the humongous dining room.Next to him was Ning Zhi who nobody could see.\u201cXiao Juejue, you need to eat some vegetables.\u201d So this little kid had been a picky eater since such a young age.She had noticed that Lu Jue was an extremely picky eater but it was too late to do anything about it. Now that she had the opportunity, she could start training her husband when he was a child.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Little Lu Jue was bullied again (2)Ning Zhi tried to scare him. \u201cKids who don\u2019t eat vegetables will not grow tall.\u201dLittle Lu Jue continued to eat silently.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to become taller than big sister in the future?\u201d said Ning Zhi with a smile. \u201cBig sister like boys who are tall.\u201d The adult Lu Jue was very tall. She needed to life her head when looking at him.The servant stood to one side tending to the dining little Lu Jue.Suddenly, she saw the little young master who never liked vegetables reached out to the dish of stir-fried shredded carrots that was furthest away from him.The servant felt incredulous.Madam had tried everything she could from wooing to threatening but little young master never even had half a bite. He reached out for it on his own today?Little Lu Jue frowned and his big black eyes were filled with resentment but he finally swallowed the carrots that he hated.\u201cSo wonderful. Have some more.\u201d Ning Zhi felt that children were easier to woo.The servant was shocked. She saw the little young master eating the carrots one small bite at a time while frowning.She couldn't help but told that to the butler in excitement.Finally, even Mother and Father Lu found out that little Lu Jue had some vegetables after they got home. There were always a few creative vegetable dishes from the chef on the dinner table from that point forward.The next morning.Ning Zhi went to school with little Lu Jue.She saw the boys who bullied little Lu Jue yesterday.The chubby little boy among them walked up to Lu Jue and said to him viciously, \u201cDid you tell on us to the teacher yesterday?\u201dThe little chubby boy was taller than the other kids and was the little bully in class. He tossed all of little Lu Jue\u2019s pencil case sitting on his desk onto the floor.SMACK! All of the content went all over the floor.\u201cMy mom told me already. My uncle is the school director and even our teacher is afraid of my uncle.\u201d The chubby little boy stepped on the colorful pencil case on the floor. \u201cI am not afraid of the teacher.\u201cYou\u2019ve told on us. I am going to lock you up in the bathroom again later on.\u201d The chubby little boy had already made plans with the other boys that they would pretend to be ghosts and go and scare Lu Jue to tears after they had locked him up.Listening to the chubby little boy\u2019s horrible words made Ning Zhi clenched her fists. The chubby little boy was obviously a naughty one spoiled by his parents. He was not even afraid of the teacher.Sure enough, when little Lu Jue went to the restroom, Ning Zhi saw the chubby little boy walked up to him with a few other boys.She followed behind them quickly.The chubby little boy grabbed onto the back of little Lu Jue\u2019s collar and kept on calling him names like \u201cfool\u201d or \u201cmute\u201d.Little Lu Jue just kept his head lowered without saying a word.Ning Zhi saw his two little hands clenching into fists.She only wished she could go up and beat all these kids up. How could they be that mean?\u201cLet\u2019s lock him up again.\u201d One of the little boys suggested.They were bold but they dared not hit someone. The most they would do was to lock the fool up or destroy his books.Ning Zhi reached out her hand to hold little Lu Jue\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Big sister is here with you.\u201dHis little hand, being held, was warm. Little Lu Jue relaxed his little fist. He looked up at Ning Zhi who had, once again, appeared out of nowhere and said dully, \u201cStrange big sister.\u201d\u201cThe fool is talking to himself again.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s lock him up quickly. Class is about to start.\u201d\u201cWhat if the teacher found out it was us again, then what?\u201dThe chubby little boy wasn\u2019t afraid of the teacher. \u201cYou cowards. I\u2019ll do it. Hey, fool, get inside there yourself and close the door behind you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Little Lu Jue was bullied again (3)Ning Zhi only wanted to shove a rag inside of this chubby little boy\u2019s mouth.She held onto little Lu Jue as hard as she could but he was still shoved by the chubby little boy. Ning Zhi was frantic. She didn\u2019t want to see him locked up again.Ning Zhi was annoyed that she could get here but there were so much that she couldn\u2019t do. She would watch little Lu Jue be bullied and there was nothing that she could do.If only she could appear, or touch other solid objects, she would not feel as helpless as she did right now.\u201cGHOST!\u201d Screamed one of the little boys when he looked over next to Lu Jue.The chubby little boy turned his head and saw a woman with long hair, in a white dress, who appeared out of nowhere. He was so frightened that he started crying. His knees buckled and he collapsed onto the floor. \u201cMom! Ghost!\u201d\u201cWu. The ghost is going to eat us.\u201dSeeing the terrified look on the kids as they looked at her direction, she pointed at herself and asked, \u201cYou can see me?\u201dThe chubby little boy\u2019s legs shook. He bawled. \u201cDon\u2019t eat me. OH! Ghost is here.\u201dNing Zhi had no idea what had happened but she responded quickly to the situation. \u201cI saw you bullying little Lu Jue earlier?\u201dShe lowered her head and her black hair fell forward. She did look a little scary. \u201cI will beat up whoever that bullies little Lu Jue.\u201dThe chubby little boy looked nothing like the arrogant little bully that he was just a little while ago.His tears and snots came running down and he looked to be genuinely frightened. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again. Please don\u2019t hit me. Wuwuwu\u2026\u2026\u201dNing Zhi turned toward the other two boys.\u201cWe didn\u2019t hit Lu Jue and we won\u2019t do it again. I want to go home.\u201d The little boy trembled and turned pale.Ning Zhi hrumphed loudly. \u201cWhoever that bullies little Lu Jue again in the future, I will go to your house and eat you at night after you go to bed.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t bull him again. Don\u2019t come to my house.\u201d The chubby little boy bawled her eyes out. He was scared chitless.Ning Zhi finally let the boys go after she saw that they were about to pass out from fear.\u201cXiao Juejue, they are gone now and they will not bully you again in the future.\u201d Ning Zhi had no idea why the kids could see her all of a sudden. She reached over to the tap and water came running out.She could touch it now?What was going on?In addition, Ning Zhi noticed that the last little sun that was left in her mind was gone.Ning Zhi recollected herself and held little Lu Jue\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m pretty like an angel. How could those little bullies mistake me as a ghost? Tsk, they need to have their eyes checked.\u201dLittle Lu Jue looked up at her, \u201cStrange big sister.\u201dNing Zhi pinched his little cheek. \u201cYou need your eyes checked too!\u201dNing Zhi walked out with little Lu Jue. At first she had worried that she might attract attention walking out from the men\u2019s restroom but she noticed that those outside of the restroom didn\u2019t seem to notice her.What was going on?How was it that the little boys could see her earlier? And, whatever happened to her last little sun?In the two days that followed, Ning Zhi found out from Mother Lu that there were rumors of ghost-sighting at school and a few boys from little Lu Jue\u2019s class had fallen ill from fear.\u201dMother Lu was a nonbeliever but she still went to get a couple of protective talismans for little Lu Jue and Lu Shenyuan.Ning Zhi had come to realize that Mother Lu never found out about little Lu Jue being bullied by the boys in his class. It was obvious that the teacher had no intention of informing her about it.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t touch solid object again but she had an idea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Little Lu Jue was bullied again (4)Ning Zhi sat down next to little Lu Jue in front of the desk.Holding onto little Lu Jue\u2019s hand, she started to write: Aunty Lu, a few boys in class had been bullying little Lu Jue and locked him up in the bathroom. The teacher knew about this as well. The boys are not afraid of the teacher so Aunty Lu must protect Classmate Lu Jue.Ning Zhi tried her best to imitate the hand writing of a grade school student and, when she was done writing, she held onto little Lu Jue\u2019s hands and folded the letter up.The servant found a letter at the front door with the recipient\u2019s name on it. She carried the letter back inside of the house.Ning Zhi followed behind the maid, hoping that she would quickly hand the letter over to Mother Lu.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d The maid ran into Lu Shenyuan.Lu Shenyuan had on a blue checkered shirt and was already very polite at his young age. \u201cAunty Hua, is that a letter in your hand?\u201d He saw that the letter said it was for Mrs. Lu.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know who left it at the door. I am just about to bring it over to Madam.\u201dLu Shenyuan was being very nice. \u201cMy mom is resting inside her room. Why don\u2019t you give that to me and I will bring it over to her?\u201d\u201cThank you, Young Master.\u201d The maid felt that the young master was super nice. He was mature and polite at such a young age. Who wouldn\u2019t like a child like him?Lu Shenyuan took the letter from the aid and, after the maid had walked away, pulled the letter out from the envelope that was not sealed.Ning Zhi watched what he was doing the entire time.\u201cSo my little brother had been bullied.\u201d Lu Shenyuan looked up and looked around him after he was done reading the letter.Ning Zhi frowned. She had a bad feeling.She then saw Lu Shenyuan tore the letter up into halves.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes widened!She watched with disbelief in her eyes. Lu Shenyuan, who was still a little boy, tore up the letter?Ning Zhi heard high heels clacking on the floor. It was Mother Lu.Mother Lu walked out of her bedroom and saw Lu Shenyuan standing frantically next to the coffee table. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dLu Shenyuan, after all, was just a child. When he was caught red handed, he didn\u2019t hide away the tore up letter in time.Ning Zhi saw the frantic Lu Shenyuan started to talk, \u201cAunty Hua had just picked up a letter and I had inadvertently dropped the content out and damaged it.\u201dMother Lu, \u201cWho\u2019s it for?\u201d\u201cSomeone wrote it for Mom. I couldn't help but read it. It says someone was bullying little brother.\u201d Lu Shenyuan handed the letter over to his mother with both hands. \u201cMom, is that true? Who would bully little brother?\u201dMother Lu quickly took over the letter and read the content on it. The handwriting was childish and crooked but that didn\u2019t bother Mother Lu.She didn\u2019t look too happy after she read the letter.Ning Zhi saw Mother Lu picking up the phone and started dialing. She could tell from how she addressed the other person that she was talking to Lu Jue\u2019s teacher.Ning Zhi stopped listening. She knew that Mother Lu would look into the incident and take care of it. She would not allow this to happen again.That night, Ning Zhi heard that Mother Lu had left the house that afternoon and still hasn\u2019t been back.She walked out onto the patio holding little Lu Jue\u2019s hand in hers.It was a summer night and there were a lot of stars in the sky.Ning Zhi sat on the rocking chair on the patio and rocked back and forth relaxingly.\u201cXiao Juejue, big sister has to go soon.\u201d Mother Lu had taken care of this incident and it was time for her to go.Ning Zhi pinched his chubby little face. \u201cWill you miss me?\u201dLittle Lu Jue had on a red shirt with a color cartoon drawing on it. His little cheeks were alabaster color. He blinked his big eyes when he heard Ning Zhi\u2019s words. After a long while, he finally said, \u201cMiss, me.\u201dI will miss you.Ning Zhi smiled with her eyes curved. \u201cAnd I will miss you too.\u201dLittle Lu Jue\u2019s little brows frowned. There were emotions in his big black eyes. \u201cNo go you.\u201dFor the very first time, little Lu Jue reached out his hand and hung onto the hem of Ning Zhi\u2019s skirt.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes lit up.She reached out and covered up the little kid\u2019s big eyes once again. Leaning into his ear, she said to him in a tender voice, \u201cXiao Juejue must eat lots of vegetables and stop being a picky eater. You need to learn to tell on others when they bully you. I will see you next time.\u201dTruth was, Ning Zhi would like him to be more outgoing and less reserved.The warm breath fell on the tip of his ear and little Lu Jue just felt that his ear itched.It was dark in front of his eyes and he could smell the fragrance form Ning Zhi.Shortly thereafter, his ear was no longer itching and the fragrance in his nose disappeared.Little Lu Jue lowered his head. He looked blankly at his little hand. The hem that he was holding onto had disappeared.The strange big sister was gone again.Ning Zhi opened up her eyes.Looking at the tender light in the room, she knew that she was back.\u201cStrange big sister.\u201dThe room was very quiet and, suddenly, Ning Zhi could hear Lu Jue\u2019s low and deep voice. She turned to look at him.Little Lu Jue was lying there flat, his eyes shut. It seemed he was muttering in his sleep.Did he remember her? Or did he dream about her?Ning Zhi\u2019s mood lightened up some.She leaned over and couldn't help but reached her hand out and, much like how she did it to little Lu Jue, she pinched his face and corrected him softly, \u201cI am sister angel!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Lin Tiantian\u2019s face shape changed noticeably (1)It was the morning and it was quiet around her. The morning breeze blew past and the light blue curtain waved gently in the wind.Ning Zhi summoned Overlord the minute that she had woken up.\u201cHow come I was able to touch things and appeared in front others suddenly during my trip yesterday? More importantly, my last little sun disappeared.\u201dShe had been wanting to ask since the night before.Overlord: [Host, whenever you consume a little sun, you will be able to touch things and appear in front of others. The time limit is one minute.] Ning Zhi was shocked. \u201cI can consume one little sun and appear in front of others and touch solid objects?\u201dOverlord: [That is correct.]She gritted her teeth and asked angrily, \u201cHow come you never told me something this important before?\u201d She had been troubled this entire time how she would be able to save Lu Jue with all these restrictions that she had been experiencing.The Overlord\u2019s little milky voice weakened. [Host, you didn\u2019t exactly ask.]\u201cHow would I even know what to ask?\u201d If only Overload has a physical body, she would very much want to pull him out and give him a beating.The Overlord felt guilty.\u201cAnd you just said that each little sun can buy me a minute\u2019s time?\u201dOverlord: [That\u2019s right.]Ning Zhi frowned. \u201cWhy such short time? Besides, I was able to open up the closest door and appear in front of the boys. So, the time can be spent separately, as long they don\u2019t go over a minute total?\u201dBut little suns were difficult to come by. Lu Jue happened to drink some alcohol last time, which allowed her to become rich for a little while there. They were all gone now. She didn\u2019t even have one little sun with her right now.The Overlord reminded her: [That\u2019s right. And, Host, you will need 10 little suns for your next trip.] Ning Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe needed nothing like she needed little suns right now.The Overlord carried on to tell her: [Host, there are goods and bads associated with consuming little suns. When you travel back, you are not a part of that world. As such, with the exception of Lu Jue, you will not get hurt or feel pain while you are there.] Ning Zhi was aware of that. Much like her feet would not get dusty even when she was walking around in her bare feet.[Once you consumed little suns, however, you can be hurt, feel pain, or bleed during the prescribed time. If you die during that time frame, you will die for real and will not be coming back here.] Ning Zhi was taken aback. It looked like she needed to use the little suns wisely. \u201cIs there anything else that you need to tell me?\u201dOverlord said quickly: [No, that\u2019s it for now, Host.]Ning Zhi hrumphed and dismissed him.She heard stirring from next to him.Ning Zhi recollected himself and looked over. Lu Jue had woken up.His blue pajama with big red flowers were loud and a strand of his hair above his forehead was sticking up. Looking dazed, he was incredibly cute.Ning Zhi couldn't help but pulled out her cellphone from under her pillow and snapped a picture of Lu Jue.Lu Jue acted like he didn\u2019t notice that at all.\u201cGood morning,\u201d said Ning Zhi to him with a smile.Looking up, there was a blank look in Lu Jue\u2019s cherry-blossom eyes. His voice sounded like it was forced out from between his throat, \u201cMorning.\u201dNing Zhi asked him, \u201cYou had a dream last night?\u201dLu Jue blinked. He couldn\u2019t recall a thing. He said nothing but flipped open the blanket, got out of bed, and went inside the bathroom.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t think that he would remember her. After all, each time she travelled back, he was still a child. She figured the only thing that he would recall would probably just be term \u201cstrange big sister\u201d.Ning Zhi unlocked her cellphone and looked at the picture that she had just took.She must say, even in loud colors and only half of his face, Lu Jue was still incredibly handsome in the picture.She thought about it some and registered for a new account on Weibo. She named it: The Brightly Colored Little Treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Lin Tiantian\u2019s face shape changed noticeably (2)She uploaded the picture onto the account and even added a little sun emoji.When she was done, she reached for Lu Jue\u2019s phone.His phone did not have a password set and Ning Zhi was able to unlock it easily. She noticed that there was not one app on there that did not come with the phone. Never mind about any mobile games, he didn\u2019t even have any chatting apps.It was very neat.Ning Zhi did a bunch of work on it.By the time Lu Jue came out of the bathroom, she had already registered an account for him and added herself as his friend.Ning Zhi returned his phone back to him and said, \u201cI registered an account for you. You can post on there what you want to share. I will post something on there from time to time as well and you will be able to see them. You can respond back to them as well.\u201dNing Zhi showed him the picture that she had took of him.Lu Jue took a look but said nothing.Ning Zhi taught him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to type anything, you can send emojis.\u201dLu Jue took his phone back and casually tossed it onto the bed. Ning Zhi had no idea whether he heard her or not.She had her own reasons for teaching him how to post.For sure Lu Jue would never chat with her voluntarily or share his thoughts with her. If at all possible, she would like to learn about what was on his mind through his posts. That would make it easier for her to appease him.Ning Zhi was uncertain. \u201cYou got that?\u201dLu Jue looked up and looked at her with his pretty cherry-blossom eyes. His eyes were very clear. Nevertheless, his words seemed somewhat resentful. \u201cNo I dummy.\u201dI am not a dummy. Of course I got it.Ning Zhi found that comical. \u201cYou are right, you are not a dummy.\u201dYou are just silly. Very silly!Lu Jue had just finished washing his face. Ning Zhi got close to him and gently wiped away the remaining droplets of water on the side of his cheek. \u201cYou are the smartest.\u201dThe very next second, five little suns appeared in the indicator above Lu Jue\u2019s head!Looking at the golden sparkles in front of her, Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes beamed instantly. She held Lu Jue\u2019s slightly cool hand and all five of the little suns rushed to her. They were as cute as one could imagine.Ning Zhi praised him again with a smile. \u201cXiao Juejue, how are you so wonderful? You are the best treasure in the world.\u201dAlmost immediately, another little sun appeared over his head.Looking at the six cute little suns in her head, Ning Zhi\u2019s little mouth was very sweet. Compliments toward Lu Jue rolled out of her as though they were free.She didn\u2019t just praise that he was smart, but also that he was good looking. \u201cAnyway I look at it, you are exactly my type.\u201d\u201cXiao Juejue, did you grow up eating cuteness?\u201d\u201cXiao Juejue, I want to play hide and seek with your abdominal muscles.\u201d\u201cXiao Juejue, you are not even a human, you are a god from the sky.\u201d\u2026\u2026Ning Zhi shamelessly used all of the bizarre and embarrassing compliments that she had seen online before on Lu Jue.What was shame in light of little suns? Not to mention that she hasn\u2019t even have her looks back yet!Nevertheless, no matter what more she said, no more little suns appeared inside Lu Jue\u2019s indicator.Ning Zhi\u2019s good mood from obtaining the little suns disappeared when she ran into Lin Tiantian downstairs.\u201cGood morning.\u201d Lin Tiantian greeted Ning Zhi voluntarily.Lin Tiantian felt that she had been affected too much by her dream the night before. Rushing to ask Ning Zhi\u2019s for what her parents had left for her would, of course, upset Ning Zhi.She should have thought it through first.The little jade stamp could wait. What was more important right now was her look. Lin Tiantian noticed that she was no longer able to steal Ning Zhi\u2019s halo.And she had no idea what had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Lin Tiantian\u2019s face shape changed noticeably (3)The change in her own face shape and that Ning Zhi\u2019s skin tone becoming lighter than it was, all of these pointed to the fact that the minor crack on her jade pendant might lead to Ning Zhi\u2019s halo returning back to her.But, why was it that she couldn\u2019t take them back again?Lin Tiantian studied Ning Zhi stealthily and noticed that Ning Zhi looked lively. The air of sadness and disgruntlement were gone from between her eyes.\u201cYou are in my way. Something\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Ning Zhi with her brows raised.Lin Tiantian recollected herself. The Ning Zhi now was very different than how she was before. She was distant, cold and, most importantly, she didn\u2019t seem to dislike Lu Jue anymore? She was no longer disgruntled about being with him.Lin Tiantian\u2019s face dropped a little but, still with a smile, she said, \u201cNo, nothing.\u201dNing Zhi had no idea what kind of evil thoughts were going through Lin Tiantian. She pondered over it some and converted the 6 little suns she had just earned and converted them to her halo from Overlord.The moment that the exchange had taken place, Ning Zhi noticed that her skin had become lighter instantly.It wasn\u2019t exactly white like snow but light nonetheless.Ning Zhi touched her hair. It was soft and smooth with no split ends at all.She pulled out her little cosmetic mirror and looked in it. Her features became more defined and three-dimensional. It looked like another layer of gauze had been removed and more could be seen.Inside the dressing room.Lin Tiantian needed to redo a few of the shoots today.The makeup artist was helping her with the styling.\u201cSister Tiantian, have you been eating a lot lately?\u201d The makeup artist was hired by Lin Tiantian\u2019s team and, as they had been working together for a long time, they were quite familiar with each other. As such, she wasn\u2019t too worried about what she could or could not say.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Tiantian\u2019s eyes were closed. She was leaning back in her seat, letting the makeup artist work her magic.\u201cYour seemed to have gained some weight on her cheeks.\u201d The makeup artist helped Lin Tiantian with her makeup a lot and was very familiar with Lin Tiantian\u2019s features, face shape, and skin.Up until now, Lin Tiantian\u2019s features had always been delicate, her face shape perfect, and even her skin was light and flawless. She made everyone envious of her.Most importantly, she never had any work done on her face. Everything about her was natural. She had the title of natural beauty within the entertainment circle.Today, however, Lin Tiantian\u2019s face shape seemed to be noticeably different. Even her nose\u2026\u2026Lin Tiantian opened up her eyes immediately and looked into the mirror when she heard the makeup artist\u2019s words.This historical style required all of her hair to be pulled up, her face clean with no hair dangling in front of it. Even her makeup had to be very, very light.Only she could handle such a harsh request.When she looked into the mirror and saw her own reflection, however, she was stunned.Only her cheekbones were showing a little yesterday on both sides and that her tapering face was a little bit squarer but, now, her face had become meatier and even her nose seemed to have collapsed a little. It was no longer perky and delicate like it used to be.Lin Tiantian looked at the pendant around her neck reflexively and the crack on the white jade seemed to have grown just a tad longer.What was going on?She had kept it as close to her as possible. Why did it crack more?Lin Tiantian was a little frantic.A worker came inside and rush them. \u201cSister Tiantian, the director asked me to come and check on you. Are you almost ready?\u201d\u201cYes, almost.\u201d The makeup artist quickly carried on with her work.Lin Tiantian suddenly said, \u201cAdd more shadow on both cheeks and also on both sides of the nose.\u201dThe makeup artist acknowledged quickly.After she was done with her makeup applied, Lin Tiantian went over to the studio. \u201cPardon me, Director. It took me a little longer than expected.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just take your place.\u201dDirector Wang did not like it when actors were late. Waiting for almost an hour, he was already quite unhappy.Lin Tiantian walked over to where the cameras were pointing. The male lead was already waiting there for her.The director put down his script and looked into the monitor. He frowned immediately the very next minute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - The girl who saved Lu Jue (1)\u201cWait.\u201d Director Wang cried out. \u201cWhat\u2019s with your makeup today, Lin Tiantian. Why is it completely different than how it was before? We are reshooting some of the scenes. The audiences would be able to tell the differences right away like this.\u201dDirector Wang wanted to film in high definition. He strongly disliked having too much post-production editing. As such, he had very high standard for the actor\u2019s makeup.He was never a fan of the female lead, Lin Tiantian. Her acting was awful but she liked to act like she was somebody. He would never have used her if not for her pretty face and that she matched his requirement as well as the image of the female lead.Now, looking at Lin Tiantian\u2019s cheeks and the heavy shadows on her nose, Director Wang\u2019s brows furrowed. He requested Lin Tiantian to have all those removed and that her makeup couldn\u2019t be too heavy.Lin Tiantian\u2019s face burned. She returned to the dressing room under everyone\u2019s stare, her face blushed the entire way.By the time she switched out her makeup and showed up again, Director Wang\u2019s brows were still furrowed.Director Wang spoke, baffled, \u201cYou looked quite good before, why did you go and have it done? What is with your look right now?\u201dHis words were obvious. He was sort of saying that her plastic surgery had failed.Lin Tiantian was furious. Her head half lowered, she said, \u201cI am not feeling very well, Director. I want to take a couple of days off.\u201dHaving said that, she didn\u2019t even care whether the director approved of her time off or not and just took off.Her agent chased after her. \u201cOh my gosh, Tiantian. What is going on with you? Do you know how many top tier actresses wanted to be in Director Wang\u2019s shows? Your attitude earlier really upset Director Wang.\u201d\u201cWas I supposed to put up with him after he said what he said?\u201d Lin Tiantian went inside her nanny van with her mask on.Lin Tiantian wasn\u2019t worried about that at all. She was not like the other actors. The other actors needed to kowtow to the directors and appease them. She was a part of the Lu family. Others need to be appeasing her.The agent was well aware of Lin Tiantian\u2019s identity. She was a golden paradox. She couldn\u2019t be chastised.The agent sighed and changed the subject. \u201cWhat is going on with your face?\u201dLin Tiantian had always been a pretty one. But she seemed to have become uglier today, almost unpleasant looking.Lin Tiantian\u2019s face dropped. She did not want to elaborate on that subject.After a long while, she finally spoke, \u201cI need to swing by a jewelry place.\u201dThe agent was a little surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You want to buy jewelries?\u201dLin Tiantian said, \u201cMy pendant broken. I need to have it repaired.\u201dNing Zhi had classes in the afternoon and she noticed that there was a guest at the Lu\u2019s when she returned.\u201cYou are back?\u201d Mother Lu was still smiling from chatting with the guest.Ning Zhi walked over to them.\u201cHere. Let me introduce the two of you. This is Huo Xiaoyue, the Young Miss of the Huo family. She just returned from overseas a few days ago.\u201d Mother Lu turned toward Huo Xiaoyue and introduced Ning Zhi to her. \u201cThis is Ning Zhi, my second daughter-in-law who I mentioned earlier.\u201dNing Zhi sat down across from Mother Lu. \u201cHi, Miss Huo.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue looked Ning Zhi up and down. There were discontent and dissatisfaction in her tone. \u201cSo you were the one who married Lu Jue, huh?\u201dNoticing the hostility in her tone, Ning Zhi was a little surprised. They had just met, what did she do to offend her?Mother Lu said, \u201cXiao Zhi is the one who had been taking care of Xiao Jue. Xiao Jue wouldn\u2019t let anyone else get close to him.\u201d\u201cI can take care of Lu Jue too,\u201d said Huo Xiaoyue softly.Mother Lu patted her on her hand, her voice affectionate. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take care of Lu Jue. Besides, you won\u2019t be able to anyway.\u201dMother Lu said to Ning Zhi, \u201cXiaoyue had been in the same class as Xiao Jue since grade school. They had been classmates for many years and, back in grade school, Xiao Yue had saved Lu Jue before.\u201dNow Ning Zhi\u2019s interest had been piqued. This girl had saved Lu Jue before?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - The girl who saved Lu Jue (2)Mother Lu, \u201cBack in grade school, Xiao Jue had been bullied by a few boys in his class and was locked inside the bathroom. Xiao Yue was the one who informed the teacher to go and get him.\u201dMother Lu\u2019s tone sounded very appreciative. \u201cThe teacher only gave the boys verbal warnings and I never found out about it. Luckily, Xiao Yue wrote me a letter and told me about it. Xiao Jue would continue to be bullied by those boys otherwise.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue was the girl who brought the teacher?Ning Zhi was surprised.She looked at the girl. The little girl\u2019s cute round face had grown and her features had become more delicate. She could still see a hint of her look when she was a kid.Ning Zhi remembered that this girl had asked Lu Jue to be her boyfriend back in grade school!But what was with that letter?She wrote the letter while holding onto little Lu Jue\u2019s hand. How did that turn into Huo Xiaoyue who wrote the letter?\u201cAunty Lu, I only remembered going to get the teacher. It had been so long. I can\u2019t remember whether I wrote a letter to you or not.\u201d It had been so long that Huo Xiaoyue couldn\u2019t remember all of the details.Mother Lu smiled and said, \u201cOne way or another, Aunty is still very appreciative of what you have done.\u201dShe turned toward Ning Zhi and said, \u201cXiaoyue was here to visit Xiao Jue today. Why don\u2019t you take her upstairs with you? Xiao Jue won\u2019t lose his temper with you around.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d said Ning Zhi.Huo Xiaoyue, walking next to Ning Zhi, said to her bluntly, \u201cI like Lu Jue. Had I not gone to study abroad, I will be the one who married him.\u201dNing Zhi could now see a hint of Huo Xiaoyue, the little girl back in the days. She found that comical. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018ifs\u2019 in this world. Besides, Lu Jue doesn\u2019t like you. Regardless of whether you have studied abroad or not, you wouldn\u2019t be the one to marry him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve known Lu Jue since grade school.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue lifted her chin, looking very much like a wealthy girl that she was. \u201cGrade school, junior high school, and senior high school. I had always been in the same class as him. I was there with him when he grew up.\u201d\u201cAre we competing who knew him first now?\u201d Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since kindergarten.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need you to believe me,\u201d said Ning Zhi nonchalantly.Huo Xiaoyue hit where it hurt. \u201cYou are too ugly for Lu Jue.\u201dNing Zhi felt that Huo Xiaoyue was a cute kid but how did she turn into such a jerk after she grew up?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I look as long as Lu Jue likes me.\u201d Ning Zhi\u2019s skin was very thick. She would not bulge from just a few words from Huo Xiaoyue.Huo Xiaoyue bit her lip and just found Ning Zhi very annoying.She had really wanted to marry Lu Jue if it wasn\u2019t for her mother\u2019s objection.Lu Jue was normally inside his study at this hour.Ning Zhi pushed open the door and saw Lu Jue sitting in front of the computer in his red workout clothes.Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s eyes lit up. She ran up to him. \u201cLong time no see, Lu Jue. I am back from overseas.\u201dLu Jue paid no attention to her words or her person.Huo Xiaoyue wanted to touch his hand but he avoided her immediately.Huo Xiaoyue sighed. She was already used to that. She had only been chasing after him since grade school.\u201cHave you lost some weight, Lu Jue? You looked to be handsomer too?\u201d Huo Xiaoyue looked up and down Lu Jue. She had always had good eyes. Lu Jue was, indeed, the handsomest of them all.Ning Zhi was unhappy now. She suddenly felt that someone was coveting what was her.She walked over to Lu Jue and leaned into his ear.She purposefully touched the tip of Lu Jue\u2019s ear with her lip and said, \u201cXiao Juejue, your old schoolmate\u2019s here to visit you. Why don\u2019t you say hi to her?\u201dAs soon as she finished talking, she saw a row of little suns appearing inside the indicator over Lu Jue\u2019s head.One, two, three\u2026\u2026She counted. There were 7 total!Ning Zhi was even more unhappy now. Exactly how happy was he when he saw Huo Xiaoyue??Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - \u201cSo this is where you like being touched, eh?\u201d (1)Huo Xiaoyue was stunned when she saw Ning Zhi got close to Lu Jue. She even saw Ning Zhi touching Lu Jue\u2019s ear with her lips.Lu Jue didn\u2019t turn her down nor did he avoid her!It was exactly what Mother Lu had said. Lu Jue only allowed Ning Zhi to get close to him.Huo Xiaoyue had been paying Lu Jue attention since grade school. She knew very well how much Lu Jue didn\u2019t like to be touched.He never talked to anyone and had no friends.All the way until graduating senior high school, she always thought that Lu Jue would always be a loner.He would spend his entire life quietly, and by himself.Had it not been that incident, she would not have left the country. She would fight to marry Lu Jue. After all, she would never be able to find someone as handsome as he was.But now, not only was Lu Jue married. It even seemed that the two of them got along alright?\u2019Huo Xiaoyue must admit that she was shock.The tip of his ear was warm and itchy. Lu Jue\u2019s lids trembled a little and his lashes fluttered with that.Not getting any responses from him, Ning Zhi hrumphed next to his ear and patted him on his shoulder. All 7 little suns rushed toward her happily and was put away by her in no time.Lu Jue didn\u2019t look at Huo Xiaoyue at all. His voice was low and keep. \u201cDon\u2019t know me.\u201dI don\u2019t know [her].\u201cYou don\u2019t know her?\u201d The displeasure that filled her chest just a second again disappeared all at once. She looked over at Huo Xiaoyue and the latter looked like an ignited dynamite. She looked huffy and puffy.\u201cI know your name is Lu Jue, but you didn\u2019t need to be so cold and uncaring. How many years had we been classmate from grade school through senior high school? How do you not know me?\u201d Huo Xiaoyue only wished she could run up and shake Lu Jue\u2019s head. How was it that he never had her on his mind?Even if he wasn\u2019t fond of her, but how could he turn a blind eye to a classmate for so many years?Seeing how Huo Xiaoyue was flustered, Ning Zhi tried to hide the smile on her. She said to Huo Xiaoyue, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. You are aware of Lu Jue\u2019s special circumstance. Don\u2019t mind him. We appreciate Miss Huo for visiting him today.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue grilled Ning Zhi, \u201cYou are happy, aren\u2019t you?\u201dNing Zhi curved her lips some and said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what Miss Huo was trying to say here.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue found Ning Zhi annoying no matter how she looked at her. She felt that Ning Zhi was just mediocre looking and was not good enough for Lu Jue. \u201cSo what if you can get close to Lu Jue and touch him? It doesn\u2019t mean anything. He doesn\u2019t actually like you.\u201dAutistic individuals lack feelings. They ignore even their parents, let alone toward others.Huo Xiaoyue did not believe that Lin Xi would fall for Ning Zhi.\u201cThat is not something that you need to worry about,\u201d said Ning Zhi slowly and leisurely. \u201cOne way or another, he definitely doesn\u2019t like you.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue\u2019s cheeks were all puffed up. \u201cWhy do you talk in such an annoying way?\u201dNing Zhi\u2019s tone was light. She kept at it. \u201cWhat can I say? Lu Jue loves listening to me talk.\u201dThe very next second, she heard Huo Xiaoyue blurted out, \u201cMy brother saved Lu Jue\u2019s life in the past.\u201dNing Zhi was taken aback a little. Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s brother had saved Lu Jue in the past?As soon as she finished saying that, Huo Xiaoyue regretted. She was mad that she let that slipped out of her.\u201cYour brother saved Lu Jue in the past too?\u201d Ning Zhi wanted to find out more about it. Mother Lu didn\u2019t seem to have mentioned that.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know the details. It has nothing to do with you.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue didn\u2019t want to elaborate on it. She took another look at Lu Jue, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue walked out lonelily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - \u201cSo this is where you like being touched, eh?\u201d (2)After Huo Xiaoyue had left, Ning Zhi lowered her head and looked at Lu Jue. \u201cDo you really not recognize Huo Xiaoyue?\u201dLu Jue looked up at her blankly with his cherry-blossom eyes. \u201cWho?\u201dNing Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward. She continued to ask, \u201cHuo Xiaoyue said her brother saved you in the past?\u201dLu Jue\u2019s lips were pinched shut. After a little while, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dNot being able to find the answer, Ning Zhi just changed the subject. \u201cWhy were you so happy when you heard me telling you that Huo Xiaoyue was here to visit you?\u201dHe produced seven little suns. Exactly how happy was he?No, wait. He just said he didn\u2019t know who Huo Xiaoyue was.Ning Zhi narrowed her eyes. She leaned down and whispered into Lu Jue\u2019s ear, \u201cOr, were you happy because I was whispering into your ear?\u201dShe stared over his head but no little sun appeared.As though she something had occurred to her, Ning Zhi, once again, touched the tip of Lu Jue\u2019s ear with her lips.The very next second, three little suns popped up above Lu Jue\u2019s head!And the tip of his ear started to turn pink slowly.Looking at the three sparkling little suns, Ning Zhi paused a little. So earlier he wasn\u2019t happy because Huo Xiaoyue was here.It was because her lips had touched his ear?Ning Zhi reached out her hand to touch his. The 3 little suns flew to her but no more suns appeared above his head.Holding his hand had no effects.As though experimenting, Ning Zhi touched Lu Jue\u2019s ear for the third time with her lips. Ever so gently, her lips touch his ear and she asked, \u201cLu Jue, do you like me touching you like this?\u201dAnother little sun appeared in the indicator.Ning Zhi tried again but there were not more suns.She received a total of 11 little suns. All of them golden and they couldn\u2019t be cuter!In front of her, Lu Jue\u2019s eyes were lowered, his lips pinched shut, and his look expressionless. But tips of his ears were pink. Ning Zhi was curious. Why was he happy that she touched his ear?She didn\u2019t believe that he was fond of her. He probably had no idea what fondness even was.Lu Jue, with his ears beet red, his lips moved a little. After a long while, he finally said, \u201cStick me.\u201dNing Zhi recalled all the little suns that popped up when Lu Jue was drunk last time. So, he wasn\u2019t happy from drinking alcohol but that she had hugged him?Ning Zhi recalled that some autistic individuals would recognize others through touch. They like to interact with their bodies, even though they would sometimes reject kissing and touching.Now that she had that figured out, Ning Zhi felt that she had another mean to earn little suns in the future!Unfortunately, the effect would decline and it would only work once.Huo Xiaoyue returned to her own place after she left the Lu\u2019s.Mother Huo was not too happy to see her back. \u201cYou ran out every single day. Will it kill you to stay home for a change?\u201dThe pride had left Huo Xiaoyue. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been back in a long time. All I did was go and visit an old schoolmate.\u201d\u201cYou went to the Lu\u2019s?\u201dFeeling a guilty conscience, Huo Xiaoyue lied, \u201cNo.\u201dMother Huo didn\u2019t say anything else.Huo Xiaoyue went upstairs quickly. She walked in front of a room and knocked on the door.A man\u2019s clear and magnetic voice came from within. \u201cC\u2019mon in.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue pushed opened the door and immediately saw her brother sitting in his wheel chair in front of the floor-to-ceiling window.\u201cYou didn\u2019t head into the office today, Big Brother?\u201d Huo Xiaoyue feigned a cheerful tone as she walked over next to Huo Xiaoyang\u2019s wheelchair.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot going on today.\u201dThe Huo family had good genes. Huo Xiaoyue was elegant and cute and Huo Xiaoyang was refined and decorous. He was even handsomer with his gold-rimmed glasses on.Huo Xiaoyue squatted down next to Huo Xiaoyang\u2019s wheelchair. Closing the book on his lap, she looked up to him and said, \u201cBig Brother, I just went over to visit Lu Jue at the Lu\u2019s.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - \u201cSo this is where you like being touched, eh?\u201d (3)Huo Xiaoyang had a light smile on him. \u201cMmm.\u201d\u201cHe is still silly like he was before and he said he didn\u2019t recognize me. How is he so annoying?\u201d Huo Xiaoyue leaned against her brother\u2019s legs. \u201cI thought I would be single for life if I can\u2019t marry him but he already has a wife now.\u201dHuo Xiaoyang listened to his sister attentively.\u201cThat woman can approach Lu Jue and even touch him.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue complained. \u201cShe isn\u2019t even as pretty as I am. Lu Jue needs to have his eyes checked.\u201dHuo Xiaoyang shook his head helplessly. His sister has a flaw \u2013 she only liked good-looking people.\u201cI thought I will be very sad when I saw that Lu Jue married someone else.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue sniffled, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t Big Brother. I am sorry.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t been such a spoil brat, her brother would not be wheelchair-bound from saving Lu Jue.\u201cI should be the one who is handicapped.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue regretted deeply. It was all her fault that her brother was wheelchair-bound for life. Her brother was such an outstanding man.If it wasn\u2019t for her, her brother would be the brightest star at school and at the office.That\u2019s why her mother held grudges against her. It only made sense why she didn\u2019t want to have her around.Huo Xiaoyang patted her on her head. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. Saving Lu Jue was my own decision. I will live up to the consequences.\u201d\u201cNo, it was my fault.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s eyes reddened. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t insist on bringing Lu Jue with, you would not have been in that car accident from saving Lu Jue.\u201dShe had been so spoiled that she couldn\u2019t tell right from wrong.Huo Xiaoyue sniffled heavily. \u201cIf only I can have a do over, I will not make that silly mistake again. That way there will be no accident and Big Brother will not have to be wheelchair-bound.\u201dHuo Xiaoyang rubbed his sister on her head. \u201cThere is no do over in this world.\u201d\u201cYou sound just like that Ning Zhi.\u201d\u201cNing Zhi?\u201d Huo Xiaoyang was baffled.\u201cLu Jue\u2019s wife. She is an annoying one,\u201d said Huo Xiaoyue.Huo Xiaoyue smiled. His sister had been spoiled since she was a child and very few could teach her a lesson. Had it not been the car accident and she seemed to have grown up overnight and reined in so much, she would still be that prideful and arrogant young mistress.Ning Zhi saw that Lin Tiantian was back for dinner.Sitting across from her, Ning Zhi studied Lin Tiantian\u2019s face carefully.When she had exchanged for 6% of halo in the past, Lin Tiantian seemed to have become uglier. Her cheekbones appeared to be even wider now and her cheeks were meatier. She no longer had that perfectly tapered face and even her nose was not as pointy as it was before.A smile appeared in Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes.Lin Tiantian had become much prettier in the past because of the halo\u2019s effect. Nobody felt that anything was out of the norm.Now that Lin Tiantian was becoming uglier from losing a portion of the halo, Ning Zhi wondered how Lin Tiantian would explain her changes to the others.Sitting across from her, Lin Tiantian, too, were studying Ning Zhi. She noticed that Ning Zhi had become lighter!Sure enough, the crack on her pendant lead to the halo starting to return to Ning Zhi.Lin Tiantian had no idea why a crack had appeared on her jade inexplicably but she had already taken it to be fixed.She should be able to rob the halo from Ning Zhi again once it was fixed.\u201cXiao Zhi,\u201d said Mother Lu suddenly. \u201cThere\u2019s a charity ball in a couple of days. Why don\u2019t you accompany me there?\u201dBoth Ning Zhi and Lin Tiantian was surprised by Mother Lu\u2019s words.Lin Tiantian lowered her eyes. Mother Lu had always brought her with. Ning Zhi had been fawning over Mother Lu lately and that had obviously changed the way Mother Lu\u2019s opinion on Ning Zhi. Now she was even going to take Ning Zhi with her to a ball?Lin Tiantian smiled and said, \u201cMom, Xiao Zhi had never been to a ball before. I am free day after tomorrow. Why don\u2019t I accompany the two of you? That way I can stay with Xiao Zhi so she won\u2019t embarrass herself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - \u201cSo this is where you like being touched, eh?\u201d (4)Ning Zhi raised her brows, \u201cAre you saying that Mom doesn\u2019t have the ability to bring me with her alone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I am saying.\u201d Lin Tiantian went on to explain. \u201cXiao Zhi, I just want to help you out.\u201dNing Zhi smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. I will just follow Mom the entire time.\u201dMother Lu nodded, \u201cXiao Zhi will be fine with me. There aren\u2019t a lot of rules at a charity ball. There\u2019s no need to be too uptight.\u201dLin Tiantian went silence. She knew that Mother Lu had no intention of bringing her with.Now that Lin Tiantian had started it, Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t going to let her off the hook lightly. \u201cHow come you look odd today?\u201dLin Tiantian\u2019s heart tightened. She heard Ning Zhi said, \u201cYour nose looked to be collapsed.\u201dBoth Father and Mother Lin were not exceptionally looking individuals. Their noses were not tall either. Lin Tiantian, inherited their DNA, her nose was a bit round and big and looked a little collapsed.What Lin Tiantian hated the most right now was people paying attention to and mentioning her look. She gritted her teeth silently when she heard Ning Zhi\u2019s words. \u201cI bumped into my nose during the shoot today.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Ning Zhi put on a surprised look and said purposefully, \u201cYou had work done on your nose before?\u201dLin Tiantian suppressed her anger. \u201cI had never any work done.\u201dNing Zhi pretended to be innocent, \u201cIf you had never had any work done, how was it that your nose would collapse like that when you just bummed it slightly?\u201dLin Tiantian could hardly maintain her smile. \u201cXiao Zhi is getting funnier and funnier.\u201dNing Zhi kept at it, \u201cYour words are getting more and more illogical too.\u201dNing Zhi was secretly happy when she saw the fire burning in Lin Tiantian\u2019s eyes. Die from anger, you.She turned, looked over at Lu Jue who was eating quietly next to her and said, \u201cYou are the cutest.\u201dThat night.Ning Zhi crawled into bed early. After a period of time, Lu Jue would no longer get upset over sharing the bed with her.Ning Zhi counted her little suns over and over again. She had 11 of them but she would need to spend 10 of them for her next trip. She felt that she was still very poor.Meanwhile, Lu Jue walked out of the shower.This time he had on a red pajama with big, blue flowers.Others might look tacky in that color combination but Lu Jue was well built, tall, and incredibly handsome. He almost made that loud color looked fashionable.He had just washed his hair and it was still dripping wet. Water droplets continued to roll down his tall nose and chiseled cheeks.Ning Zhi quickly got up, grabbed a dry towel, and smiled at him. \u201cLu Jue, let me dry your hair for you.\u201dThe water droplets fell, rolled down his prominent and sexy Adam's apple and disappeared under his collar.Sitting on the side of the bed, Lu Jue paid Ning Zhi no attention.Ning Zhi quickly stopped Lu Jue from lying down. \u201cNo, don\u2019t lie down yet. Your hair is still wet.\u201d\u201cLet me help you dry your hair. You sit tight.\u201d Ning Zhi got close to him and placed the towel over his head.She rubbed his hair gently and said, \u201cDoes this feel good, Lu Jue? Do you like me drying your hair for you?\u201dHe liked her touching him, right? So she would service him.Ning Zhi was so attentive that she was short of asking him, \u201cAre you happy with my service, Boss?\u201dLu Jue sat there quietly and let Ning Zhi did with his hair however she pleased.After a long while, there was still no little suns.Ning Zhi was a little disappointed. He wasn\u2019t happy even after she had been servicing him so enthusiastically?Lu Jue\u2019s heart was definitely like a needle in the ocean.She could tell that his hair was fine and soft under her hand.His lips pinched shut. There was no expression on him and his handsome face looked even paler with the bright color pajama on. A childishness could be seen between her clear and clean eyes and brows.Ning Zhi\u2019s heart softened. Lu Jue looked a lot like when he was a child right now.After a long while, when Lu Jue\u2019s hair was almost all dried, Ning Zhi tossed away the towel. \u201cOkay, now go to bed.\u201dLu Jue laid down flat on the bed and closed his eyes.Ning Zhi turned the lights off.She returned to the bed with the dim light from the table lamp. She thought about it some and was still feeling unreconciled.Ning Zhi scooted over next to Lu Jue.She leaned over to him and touched his ear with her lip.Lu Jue opened up his eyes immediately.There were no little suns.Ning Zhi reach her hand out and placed it directly on Lu Jue\u2019s chest, her palm touching his body.Still no little suns.Ning Zhi frowned. Was she wrong?She moved her hand around and she touched his face, hand, legs. Nothing worked.Ning Zhi gave up. She retrieved her hand and she happened to stroke his stomach.All of a sudden, a little sun appeared.One little sun!Ning Zhi was delighted. She put her hand back and gently stroked the firm area.Five little suns!Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved. \u201cSo this is where you like being touched, eh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - \"Lu Jue, I've found you.\" (1)Lu Jue went for a jog every morning and, as such, was very well-built.Ning Zhi felt that what she was feeling under the palm was very nice as well. With her hand placed on him, the six suns that appeared rushed to her.She left her hand on him and wanted to expand the area that it was touching.Lu Jue\u2019s hand was a little chilly but his stomach was very warm. She wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because of the stimulation from her touch, his muscles were taut.She could tell that the muscles were very defined.Hurry up! Give me one more little sun!Ning Zhi moved her hand around randomly.Inadvertently meeting Lu Jue\u2019s clear and blank look, Ning Zhi blushed. She suddenly realized what kind of an evil act she was committed right at that moment.\u201cMy hand is cold,\u201d said Ning Zhi shamelessly but she stopped moving her hand around. She went on to explain, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to warm my hand up.\u201dEven she didn\u2019t believe in her own words.Lu Jue\u2019s lips were pinched shut. Under the dim and warm light, his long lashes fluttered. His low grunt could be heard in the quiet room.Ning Zhi\u2019s face was burning. She pulled her hand back quietly. \u201cThank you. My hand is warm now.\u201dLu Jue felt somewhat comfortable but not really. There was bewilderment in his beautiful cherry-blossom eyes.Under the blanket, Lu Jue placed his own hand where Ning Zhi had hers earlier but he didn\u2019t feel a thing.He turned his body to face Ning Zhi and said, \u201cPlace again. Warm you hand.\u201dPut your hand on me again. I will warm it up for you.Ning Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are offering to warm my hand for me?\u201d Ning Zhi strongly felt that she was an evil person luring a good kid to do evil things.Lu Jue\u2019s long and straight lashes fluttered and it sounded like he squeezed out noise from his throat. \u201cMmm.\u201dFor the sake of little suns, Ning Zhi shamelessly scooted back toward him and she reached her hand from under her blanket to under his. Her hand found its way under his pajama with ease.The second that she laid hand on him, she could feel his muscles tensed up right away.Ning Zhi looked up at Lu Jue. His eyes dark and bright and, above his head, 5 more little suns appeared!It looked like he liked being touched there a lot.She wiggled her hand a little and another little sun appeared!Lu Jue grunted heavily. He sounded like he was in discomfort, or feeling good.Ning Zhi\u2019s cheeks burned. She felt that the muscles under her hand were also burning her.She touched him for a little while and got two more suns but then those were it.She had received 6 little suns earlier and now 8 more. She didn\u2019t think that touching Lu Jue\u2019s stomach would have given her 14 little suns.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t some calculation, with the 11 little suns that she had gotten from the study earlier, she now had whopping total of 25 little suns.She was rich!As there were no more little suns, Ning Zhi stopped what she was doing.Feeling that the hand that soft and seemingly boneless little hand was gone from him, Lu Jue quickly looked over at Ning Zhi, puzzled.Ning Zhi had no problem tossing Lu Jue aside like a tool that was she done using. \u201cThank you. My hand is warm now. Let\u2019s go to sleep.\u201dThe tool Lu Jue kept his mouth shut, gave Ning Zhi another look, and closed his eyes.Ning Zhi attended the charity ball with Mother Lu that Sunday.Becoming lighter lately, Ning Zhi no longer have to worry about wearing light-colored clothing. She chose a starry sky-style flesh-color gown with diamonds on it.Her skin, too, had become much better and, with some light makeup on, her features stood out all of a sudden. Her soft and smooth hair cascaded down her back and she seemed very gentle.\u201cHow do I look?\u201d She went in front of Lu Jue after she had gotten ready.Lu Jue had just woken up from his nap.Lu Jue\u2019s days were very routine \u2013 jogging in the morning, breakfast, read, lunch break, playing with his puzzle, playing on his computer, read. He lived by a very fixed and punctual schedule.Lu Jue looked up. His voice low and dull, \u201cUgly.\u201dNing Zhi, who was holding up her hem, paused what she was doing. She was so annoyed that she wanted to bite him. \u201cWhy did I bother asking?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - \"Lu Jue, I've found you.\" (2)Ning Zhi changed into her high heels and got ready to go. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later than normal tonight.\u201dThere was no expression on Lu Jue. He didn\u2019t acknowledge her.Ning Zhi was only informing him. She hadn\u2019t expected a response.The charity ball took place at a hotel and all of the proceeds from the auction would be donated to those in need.Ning Zhi had attended plenty of these events with her parents in the past. She felt that, comparing to the gathering solely for eating, drinking, and having fun, albeit equally boring, at least gatherings like these were more meaningful.\u201cJust follow me and buy anything that you like.\u201dMother Lu maintained herself very well. That, on top of the fact that she was a beautiful woman when she was young, she was still very attractive when she dressed up.She reminded Ning Zhi with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about money. The card that I gave you before belongs to Xiao Jue. You are his wife. It\u2019s your right to spend his money.\u201dWhat Mother Lu didn\u2019t tell her was that most of Lu Corporation\u2019s dividends went into this card. She didn\u2019t want to scare Ning Zhi with the amount in it.Mother Lu didn\u2019t worry that Ning Zhi would spend extravagantly. After all, there was more money in there than Ning Zhi could spend in a lifetime.*After receiving fancy jewelries from Mother Lu multiple times, Ning Zhi had already learned that her mother-in-law was a very generous person. As long as she was nice to Lu Jue, her Mother Lu would put up with a lot.Ning Zhi smiled and acknowledged Mother Lu after she heard that.Many of the wealthy housewives from the other prominent families came up to greet them when Mother Lu showed up with Ning Zhi.Mother Lu introduced Ning Zhi to them. They had never announced her in the past so this was Ning Zhi\u2019s first time being introduced to the other prominent families.Many guests knew that Second Young Master Lu was autistic and it was the Lu\u2019s adopted son who was currently assisting Father Lu in taking care of the massive Lu\u2019s empire.\u201cShe is beautiful. Madam Lu is so lucky.\u201d\u201cShe looks very loveable.\u201d\u201cYou could tell she\u2019s a smart one.\u201d\u2026\u2026The ladies that came over studied Ning Zhi carefully. They praised her verbally as they looked at her with a hint of contempt.She was born to an ordinary family. Decent looking but there were plenty of beautiful looking girls there. Ning Zhi seemed very ordinary when compared to them.Had the Second Young Master Lu not be autistic, with the Lu family\u2019s status, he could totally have married an outstanding lady. But now, the Second Young Master Lu who never showed his face could only marry such an ordinary woman.Ning Zhi was not silly. Naturally, she could tell the how fake and perfunctory the other madams\u2019 words were but she didn\u2019t care.During the banquet, Mother Lu was surprised to find out that Ning Zhi\u2019s was poised and not intimidated at all when talking to the other madams.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t fawn over them because of their high status. She acted appropriately and even handled the situation very well. She made the other chuckled.It was as though she was born for environment like this.Mother Lu remembered the first time she brought Ning Zhi with her to a banquet. As much as she tried to hide it, her pettiness showed. She stooped very low when she interacted with the other guests and made herself a laughingstock of many.This new Ning Zhi had opened up Mother Lu\u2019s eyes. Naturally, the more outstanding Ning Zhi was, the better.\u201cWhat did you say to Madam Wang earlier to make her so happy?\u201d Mother Lu was curious.Ning Zhi took a few sips of her red wine before she put her glass down. \u201cMadam Wang is wearing a pink diamond ring. There are only 15 pink diamonds in the world that are over 10 carats in size and Madam Wang one is one of them and it is also the only one that reached F in grading.\u201dNing Zhi blinked at Mother Lu and said in a cheerful tone, \u201cI just told Madam wang that the rare youthful pink diamond ring compliments her very well.\u201dMadam Wang smiled at Mother Lu and said, \u201cMadam Lu, this daughter-in-law of yours has good eyes.\u201dMother Lu had no idea how Ning Zhi was able to appraise diamonds but she was happy that Ning Zhi was praised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - \"Lu Jue, I've found you.\" (3)Ning Zhi smiled. Her hobby was to spend money and buy jewelries before her transmigration.Inside of her security box was a pink diamond, also grade F, and slightly bigger than Madam Wang\u2019s.The banquet had yet to start and guests were trickling in.Somewhat bored, Ning Zhi gave Mother Lu a heads up and got up to walk around.As soon as she had walked out of the hall, she ran into Huo Xiaoyue. She was pushing a wheelchair and in the wheelchair sat a young man.She took a look at the man in the wheelchair. He was decorous and handsome and there was a gold-rim spectacles resting over his nose bridge. The reflection on the glasses blocked his eyes.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked Huo Xiaoyue when she saw Ning Zhi. She studied Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi was slim with a nude color gown. She had just the right amount of light makeup on and her hair pulled up slightly. The tip of her soft and fine hair curled up a little, making her appeared delicate and tender.Huo Xiaoyue did not like Ning Zhi but she must admit that Ning Zhi, when she was dolled up, was somewhat attractive and she was good at dressing herself up.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward and she answered her with a question, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dNing Zhi didn\u2019t have much feelings toward Huo Xiaoyue. She was nothing but a rich spoiled brat. Blunt, straightforward, tsundere, and easily riled up. She was not a manipulative one and, even if she was, she could be seen right through.Compared to Lin Tiantian, who like to scheme behind one\u2019s back, Ning Zhi much prefer dealing with someone like Huo Xiaoyue.\u201cI am here with my brother for charity.\u201d Huo Xiaoyue did not like occasions like that but her brother needed to attend for the Huo family. Knowing that her brother was wheelchair-bound, she must come along to help him out.Ning Zhi nodded. \u201cMmhmm, me too.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue looked around and didn\u2019t see Lu Jue. \u201cLu Jue\u2019s not here. You left him home and came here by yourself for fun?\u201dThere were so many people here and no way Lu Jue would come. She just couldn't help but wanted to attack Ning Zhi verbally.\u201cXiaoyue.\u201d The man on the wheelchair stopped her.Huo Xiaoyue reined in immediately. Pouted and dared not say anything else, Huo Xiaoyue pushed the wheelchair and left.Ning Zhi went to the bathroom and ran into Huo Xiaoyue again when she got out.Tsk. This wealthy young miss had her heart set on following her around?Huo Xiaoyue gave Ning Zhi a mean stare and said in a very unreconciled tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dNing Zhi was taken aback a little. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to apologize to me.\u201dAn apology like that she might as well had just skipped it. Besides, she was not bothered by what Huo Xiaoyue had said at all.\u201cMy brother said I need to apologize to you.\u201d What she was saying was, it was not her idea and that she was forced by her brother to do so.\u201cOh.\u201d So that man on the wheelchair was Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s brother? She recalled Huo Xiaoyue mentioned the other day that her brother had saved Lu Jue.How was a man on the wheelchair able to save Lu Jue?\u201cWhat\u2019s with that reaction of yours? Don\u2019t you have something to say?\u201d Huo Xiaoyue was displeased at Ning Zhi\u2019s nonchalant attitude.Ning Zhi looked over at her. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d\u201cMy brother had me apologize to you. I was merely doing what he told me to.\u201dNing Zhi said casually, \u201cI know it\u2019s your brother\u2019s idea. Did you want me to say that you are such a good sister?\u201dAs soon as she had finished talked, Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s stare became even more vicious. \u201cI am not a good sister. I am not docile at all!\u201dHaving said that, Young Mistress Huo stomped away angrily.Ning Zhi was at loss. The mood of this young mistress was even harder to read than that of little silly Lu Jue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - \"Lu Jue, I've found you.\" (4)Ning Zhi didn\u2019t see anything she liked particular during the auction. Mother Lu bought a necklace and gave it to Ning Zhi.Per Mother Lu, these pretty little things complemented Ning Zhi very well.Many saw the way that Mother Lu treated Ning Zhi and re-evaluated Ning Zhi\u2019s standing in their minds.It was already dark when the auction was over and it was after 9 o\u2019clock by the time they got home.Ning Zhi chatted with Mother Lu some more before she returned to her room.Opening up the room door, Ning Zhi, for the first time ever, saw that Lu Jue was leaning up against the headboard in his floral pajama sitting there quietly.Lu Jue had a set schedule and he should be asleep by this hour.\u201cYou are still up?\u201d Ning Zhi was surprised.Lu Jue\u2019s lips were pinched shut. He looked up at her, said nothing, before he laid down and closed his eyes to go to bed.Was he waiting for her to come her? That thought suddenly occurred to Ning Zhi.She knew how stubborn and fixated Lu Jue\u2019s behaviors were.He would always return the glass back to where it was after he was done drinking out of it. Even the clothes in his closet would be folded up neatly and placed back in the same order as defined by him.Autistic people will get upset when their routines are messed with.That thought made Ning Zhi second guessed herself.Removing her high heels, Ning Zhi walked over to the bed. Lu Jue\u2019s eyelids trembled slightly under the light, apparently he was still awake.Ning Zhi said tenderly, \u201cThank you for waiting up for me, Lu Jue.\u201dUnder the light, Lu Jue\u2019s stifled and long lashes fluttered.The night was getting later and it was very quiet inside the room.Ning Zhi washed her feet and did not change into her pajamas. Instead, she put on a pretty dress and pair of white shoes.The Overlord had told her that she could spend little suns to appear and touch solid objects. As such, she could no longer travel back in her bare feet or in her pajamas.She summoned the Overlord, \u201cSo 10 little suns this time?\u201dThe Overlord\u2019s milky voice was filled with excitement: [That\u2019s right, Host.]Ning Zhi gave the Overlord 10 little suns and, all of a sudden, she only had 15 of them remaining. If she was to spend all 15 of them, she could have 15-minute time to show up or touch the objects around her.When she opened up her eyes again, Ning Zhi found herself standing in the middle of the street and cars were going right through her.She couldn\u2019t feel any of it but just watching the cars going through her one after another was still quite a visual stimulus.Ning Zhi quickly walked over to the side of the road.Was Lu Jue somewhere around?Ning Zhi had already noticed that she would always appear somewhere close to where Lu Jue was when she travelled back.But the area around her was so big that she had no idea where to go to look for Lu Jue.The sun was strong today and many pedestrians had umbrellas with them. Ning Zhi walked around freely and wasn\u2019t worry about the sun at all.Her skin seemed even lighter and more refine under the sun. She could only have her beauty restored when she travelled back in time. She seemed to have underestimated her original form.The dress that she had on was purchased with her current size. Now that her body had changed, her chest area was uncomfortably tight.Ning Zhi was both happy and upset at the same time. She suddenly came to the realization that being big-chested could be a form of burden.She looked around for Lu Jue but also, at the same time, wondered why Lu Jue would be in this area.\u201cDon\u2019t you know to watch out for cars when you walk? You are going to get killed!\u201dShe heard a man yelling from behind her. \u201cHey, I said to get out of my way. Are you deaf? Can you not hear what I am saying to you?\u201dNing Zhi turned and saw a tall and skinny person in red exercise outfit standing in front of a car.\u201cLu Jue!\u201dDelighted, Ning Zhi ran over quickly.When she had gotten closer, she could tell that the tall and skinny boy in red was, indeed, Lu Jue.She quickly ran up, grabbed Lu Jue by his hand and pulled him away from the car as the driver continued to shout at him.Ning Zhi took Lu Jue under the shade of a tree by the side of the road. Her eyes curved from her smile. \u201cI\u2019ve found you, Lu Jue.\u201dCompared to the last time she saw little Lu Jue, he had grown a lot. She was taller than her now. She put him at around 1.7 meter.With his baby fat gone, Lu Jue\u2019s feature became more 3-dimensional but, because of his young age, his eyes and brows still look like those belonging to a boy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - The Strange Big Sister had disappeared for 823 days; he had been counting each and every single day. (1)Lu Jue was only up to her chest area last time she was here but he was now an adolescent boy that was taller than her.Ning Zhi found that fascinating. She was watching her husband grew up!\u201cDo you still remember me, Lu Jue?\u201d Ning Zhi asked tentatively.It had just been a few days since she had last saw little Lu Jue but it had been years for him.The adolescence Lu Jue looked up at her and said nothing. He even pulled his hand out from Ning Zhi\u2019s hand.Ning Zhi was taken aback a little. Little Lu Jue had forgotten about her?She felt a little disappointed. \u201cWhy are you here? Where\u2019s the chauffeur?\u201dThose with autism like watching things that spin. Tires that spin quickly on the road attract their attention a lot. On top of that, they don\u2019t know to avoid the cars. It is very dangerous to have them alone on the street.Ning Zhi frowned. \u201cDid you mother know that you are out here on your own?\u201dLu Jue pinched his lips shut for a little while before he said, \u201c823.\u201dHe was an adolescent right now. He voice was hoarse, very different from his deep voice in his adult life.\u201cWhat 823?\u201d Ning Zhi didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say.Lu Jue\u2019s eyes were half lowered. His long and upright lashes fluttered a little. His skin was cold and light-colored. His still-childish eyes and bows frowned a little. He looked discontented and a little aggrieved.He looked pitiful, almost.Ning Zhi felt that her heart had been poked by his finger tipped and it was all softened.She lightened up her voice and asked again. \u201cCan you tell me what is the meaning of 823?\u201d\u201c823 days,\u201d said Lu Jue as he looked up at her with his black and serene eyes.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say right away.Lu Jue lowered his eyes again and ignored her.Still baffled, she asked him, \u201cLu Jue, how long have you been out? Did you come out on your own?\u201d Mother Lu wouldn\u2019t have left Lu Jue left by himself.\u201cMyself.\u201d Lu Jue\u2019s adolescence voice was dull.As though aware that his voice was odd and not pleasing to the ears, he quickly shut his mouth after he finished talking.He came out on his own?Ning Zhi frowned. \u201cLet me take you home. I\u2019m sorry they are worried about you.\u201dLu Jue said nothing nor did he decline her.She had no idea how long Lu Jue had been out. The sun was beating down and Ning Zhi could see that Lu Jue\u2019s lips were very dry.\u201cAre you thirsty? Let me go get you some water?\u201d Ning Zhi suddenly recalled that she had no money on her. \u201cDo you have money on you?\u201dLu Jue blinked and pulled money out of the pocket on his pants.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t take the money from him but she brought him in the direction of the park in front of them.Lu Jue could see her so her appearing would not make any difference to him but the other pedestrians on the road would be startled when a person suddenly appearing out of nowhere.There weren\u2019t a lot of people in the park. Ning Zhi spent 10 little suns in exchange of appearing for 10 minutes.The second that she appeared, Ning Zhi could feel the heat around her and how strong the sun was.That was incredible. Ning Zhi found the effect of the little suns incredulous.And Lu Jue, the source of the little suns\u2026\u2026 Ning Zhi gave him a look. He was still silly and cute.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips too were dry from the heat. Holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dShe brought him to where they sell water.It was the middle of summer and the entire city felt like a steamer. They had only been walking for a little while and Ning Zhi had started sweating already.There was a little supermarket next to the park and Ning Zhi walked there with Lu Jue.She bought two bottles of water.The boss lady who was munching on melon seeds were surprised by the beauty of the girl. She had no idea how it happened but the girl had a delicate face, her eyes large and limpid and her lips red like she had lipstick on. Even her skin was light like milk.She didn\u2019t know how to describe the girl but she felt that the girl in front of her was prettier than the stars on television with heavy makeup.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - The Strange Big Sister had disappeared for 823 days; he had been counting each and every single day. (2)\u201cChange please, Boss Lady.\u201d Naturally, Ning Zhi noticed the way the boss lady was looking at her and she curved her eyes at her.The boss lady couldn't help but praised, \u201cLittle girl, you are so pretty. Aunty had been here half of her life and never seen a girl as pretty as you.\u201dShe saw Ning Zhi\u2019s hand when she paid. Her hand was very different from her own that had been roughened up from heavy manual labor. Ning Zhi\u2019s little hand was light colored, her fingers long and slender, and the tip of her fingers were a pinkish cherry color. They were a pair of hands that had been pampered.She wondered what kind of family could raise a daughter like that. If she had a daughter like her, she would laugh in her dreams.As she thought that, the boss lady couldn't help but looked at Ning Zhi some more. The more she looked at her, the more envious she was. She only wished she could swap her lazy son at home for a pretty daughter like Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi\u2019s smile became sweeter after what the boss lady had said to her. After all, all girls like to be told that they are pretty.Ning Zhi took the two bottles of water and, right when she was about to hand one to Lu Jue, she turned and noticed that Lu Jue was gone.\u201cLu Jue.\u201dNing Zhi looked not too far away and saw that Lu Jue was walking toward the street with cars zipping past.Startled, she quickly ran forward.Watching as a car got close to him and Lu Jue had no idea of how dangerous it was, Ning Zhi\u2019s heart was about to bounce out from her throat. \u201cLu Jue, be careful. Don\u2019t go over there.\u201dTwo bottles of water fell onto the ground.Ning Zhi stumbled as she dashed forward. Her hand brushed past Lu Jue\u2019s clothes and she fell onto the ground.Ignoring the pain on her leg, Ning Zhi quickly grabbed Lu Jue\u2019s hand that was resting by his side. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dLu Jue lowered his hand and looked at Ning Zhi blankly.Ning Zhi stood up, \u201cStop running around aimlessly. You scared me.\u201dThere were too many cars in the street and he didn\u2019t know how to avoid them. He could be hit by a car at any moment.\u201cBlood, red.\u201d There was a shred of nervousness in Lu Jue\u2019s hoarse voice.Ning Zhi lowered her head and saw that her knee was scratched and it was bleeding.With her light-colored skin, even a red mark was obvious, let alone a large scratch. It looked scary.Looking at the blood that was seeping out, Lu Jue sounded anxious. \u201cRub medicine you. Rub medicine you.\u201dYou need to put medicine on yourself.Ning Zhi recalled what Overload had told her. If she got hurt in this world after she appeared in physical form, she would have feelings. She felt painful right now.Lu Jue suddenly turned with his back to her, squatted down and said, \u201cHospital carry you.\u201dLu Jue wanted to carry Ning Zhi to the hospital.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d Nobody would be able to see her in five minutes.\u201cCarry you. Carry you.\u201d Lu Jue was very insisting about it.Under the beating sun, Lu Jue\u2019s lips were dry. Frowning, he was stubborn like a little beast.Ning Zhi had no choice but to get onto his back.The adolescent Lu Jue was taller than her but his waist and back were still skinny.Ning Zhi held onto Lu Jue\u2019s shoulders tightly. She worried that he wasn\u2019t strong enough and would drop her.She turned her head and said into his ear, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. Let\u2019s just go back to the park where we were earlier.\u201d\u201cMedicine,\u201d said Lu Jue.\u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d She only had 5 minutes of time left. She wouldn\u2019t need any medicines; her wound would probably disappear by then.\u201cMedicine,\u201d said Lu Jue stubbornly.Ning Zhi had no choice but to say, \u201cI just need to wash the wound out.\u201dThen, she reached out her hand and twisted Lu Jue\u2019s ear gently and put on a mean voice when she said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t run around wildly next time. Look, I fell when I was chasing after you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - The Strange Big Sister had disappeared for 823 days; he had been counting each and every single day. (3)Lu Jue would not feel pain. He only felt tingly from his ear being twisted. He carried Ning Zhi toward the park with his head lowered and without making a sound.He finally said after a long while, \u201cNo run.\u201dIt was hot outside and, with the two bodies touching each other\u2019s, they became even hotter.The person on his back was both soft and warm. It was an odd sensation for Lu Jue.With his mouth shut, he hastened his pace. He could smell a nice fragrance in his nose.There weren\u2019t a lot of people in the park.Sitting on the long wooden bench, Ning Zhi lifted her foot up slightly.Her leg was fair and delicate and it looked even fairer and tenderer under the sun. It contrasted starkly with the dark-colored wood bench.Lu Jue squatted down half way in front of the wood bench and helped her clean out her wound.He was clumsy but tender and careful. Bit by bit, he used the tip of his finger to brush off the sand on her wound.Ning Zhi moved her leg some with the pain.Lu Jue looked up at her.\u201cI will hold still. You keep going.\u201d Ning Zhi was always a coward when it came to pain. With the big scratch on her knee and blood coming out of it, if she didn\u2019t feel that crying in front of little Lu Jue would be very embarrassing, her eyes would probably be red from crying right about now.Lu Jue had never cried nor said that he was in pain from being hurt or sick since he was a child. That being said, looking at the frowning Ning Zhi still gave him a dull feeling in his chest.Lu Jue lowered his head and blow at Ning Zhi\u2019s wound.Ning Zhi was taken aback a little, \u201cLu Jue?\u201dThe young man\u2019s voice was hoarse, \u201cHu you.\u201dHe repeated once again, \u201cHu-hu you.\u201dNing Zhi still remember that she would blow on his wound when he was hurt as a child. Now their roles had been reversed.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved from smiling. The young and inexperienced Lu Jue in front of her was so ridiculously cute. \u201cThank you so much. I am not hurting anymore.\u201dAs soon as she had finished saying that, her 10-minute time was up and Ning Zhi returned to her original state where only Lu Jue could see her. The wound on her foo disappeared and her skin was back to its fair color.She was right. As soon as her time was up, any wounds that she had sustained would disappear instantly.Ning Zhi\u2019s knee was fair and tender right now with not even a hint of redness.Staring at her leg, Lu Jue saw that her red wound had just disappeared.Lu Jue leaned in very close to examine it and his warm breath fell on Ning Zhi\u2019s knee. It tingled. Ning Zhi\u2019s face burned and she moved her leg again.Catching the baffled look from Lu Jue, Ning Zhi smiled and said, \u201cMy wound is much better. Thank you for tending to it, Xiao Juejue.\u201d\u201cWound disappear,\u201d asked Lu Jue.\u201cRight. It had disappeared.\u201d Ning Zhi said to him shamelessly, \u201cBecause I am Angel Big Sister.\u201dLu Jue lowered his eyes. His hoarse voice was deep. \u201cStrange big sister.\u201dNing Zhi was a little surprised. Did he recognize her?Under the sun, Lu Jue in his red exercise outfit were still half-kneeling in front of her. There was no expression on him but between his youthful and inexperienced brows and eyes were quiet and docile.Ning Zhi\u2019s heart softened some. \u201cWhat did you mean when you said 823 days earlier?\u201dLu Jue kept his mouth shut tightly.Ning Zhi said her speculation out loud. \u201cHad it been 823 days since we have last seen each other?\u201dLu Jue looked up at her and, after a long while, finally squeezed out a grunt from his throat.Ning Zhi was stunned. So, he remembered it this whole time?Lu Jue placed his cold and fair cheek onto Ning Zhi\u2019s leg. His eyes had already formed into their beautiful peach-blossom shape. Looking at her with his dark eyes quietly, she looked like an aggrieved and milky puppy begging to be comforted.The strange big sister had disappeared for 823 days. He had been counting every one of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - The stars in little Lu Jue's eyes crumbled. (1)Ning Zhi always thought that little Lu Jue lacks emotions and, even if he remembered her, it would just be a very faint impression.But now, she had suddenly learned that not only did he remember her, he even looked forward to meeting her again.Ning Zhi felt her heart being poked by a chubby little hand. Oh, how\u2019s little Lu Jue so cute?Looking at the adolescence boy who was half-squatting down in front of her, Ning Zhi couldn't help but reached out and stroke him on his head. His hair, nice and soft, laid docilely over his forehead. He couldn\u2019t be more docile.\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to return.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know that he would wait for her.Lu Jue didn\u2019t say anything. For the first time, he reached out voluntarily and wrapped his hand around Ning Zhi\u2019s wrist. His voice hoarse, \u201cForgive you.\u201dWhat was a chubby little hand now had very defined fingers. His fingers slender and strong. Ning Zhi just let him hold her hand. Her eyes curved from smiling. \u201cYou will forgive me just like that?\u201dLu Jue kept his eyes lowered and didn\u2019t say anything.The sun was beating down on them. It had no effect on her but the same could not be said about Lu Jue. He could get heat stroke in this temperature.Lu Jue held Lu Jue\u2019s hand. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201dThe Lu family had already launched into a panic by now.Mother Lu almost passed out when she found out that Lu Jue was lost. Father Lu sent a lot of men out to look for Lu Jue. He didn\u2019t look much better either.\u201cSir, we saw that Young Master had gotten onto a bus from the surveillane video. We even looked through the bus\u2019s video and are now searching around the area where he got off.\u201d\u201cYou must find Xiao Jue soon.\u201d Mother Lu\u2019s eyes were red and the corners of her eyes were swollen. She had been crying for a while already.The idea of Lu Jue being out there all by himself made her worry.Next to her, Lu Shenyuan, who was dressed neatly and cleanly comforted her, \u201cI\u2019m sure little brother will be alright.\u201dMother Lu wiped away the tears that welled up in her eyes. \u201cXiao Jue doesn\u2019t know to avoid cars. I can\u2019t imagine him running around blindly in the middle of the streets. He also doesn\u2019t like to talk so he won\u2019t ask anyone for direction, or help\u2026\u2026\u201dThe more Mother Lu thought about it, the more worried she became.\u201cLittle brother is very smart. I am sure he will come home when he was done having fun.\u201d Lu Shenyuan had the servant brought his mother a cup of ginseng tea to calm her. He then sat there quietly and wouldn\u2019t need to be looked after.Mother Lu\u2019s heart gripped tightly. The thoughts of her little son possibly getting hurt or running into bad people brought more tears to her eyes.Father Lu\u2019s handsome face looked unhappy and his eyes filled with ache. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I promise I\u2019ll find out son. You haven\u2019t eaten lunch yet. Let me have the kitchen make you something.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have appetite.\u201d Mother Lu\u2019s voice was cracking. \u201cI\u2019m sure Xiao Jue hadn\u2019t eaten either. What happens if he\u2019s hungry? I don\u2019t even know if he has money on him.\u201dFather Lu, too, was worried about his son. His wife\u2019s words made him more worry.\u201cI\u2019m sure little brother will be fine,\u201d said Lu Shenyuan with certainty, as though he was comforting both his parents and himself.\u201cHe\u2019s right. I am sure Xiao Jue will be fine.\u201d Mother Lu was an atheist but, now, she couldn't help but started praying for the safe return of her son.Ning Zhi just experimented with 10 of her little suns and she only had 5 left now. She couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more of them.Where they were right now were some 10 bus stations away from the Lu\u2019s mansion. She had no idea how Lu Jue even got there in the first place.She brought Lu Jue with her onto a taxi and had him told the driver his address.The car stopped in front of the Lu\u2019s mansion and, as soon as Lu Jue got out of the car, the security guard quickly went to alert the butler that their second young master was back with an excited look.Looking at Mother Lu running over with her eyes reddened and wanted to hug Lu Jue, Ning Zhi suddenly recalled Mother Lu telling her that Lu Jue had gotten lost once. She worried about him all night long and he was finally found at a hospital.Lu Jue, who was lost, was hit by a car. The driver was so scared that he immediately took Lu Jue to the hospital. Luckily Lu Jue only had some scratches on his hand and nothing serious.Mother Lu was still scared when she recounted the incident.So, it was her who found the lost Lu Jue this time.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t imagine what Lu Jue had experienced being lost for one whole night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mom was so worried.\u201d Mother Lu ignored Lu Jue\u2019s resistance and threw her arms around him. Tears streamed down her cheeks and the weight had finally been lifted off her chest.\u201cMom was worried sick.\u201d Mother Lu hugged her skinny son tightly, fear that she would lose him again.Lu Jue\u2019s mouth was shut tight and his brows furrowed. Not wanting to be hugged, he started struggling to break free from Mother Lu.Mother Lu let out a deep sigh of relief. \u201cXiao Jue, don\u2019t run round like that again in the future.\u201dShe let go of him and Lu Jue stopped struggling.Father Lu wasn\u2019t as emotional as Mother Lu but his eyes were still glistening from moisture.Next to them, in a white shirt, was Lu Shenyuan who was smiling tendering, \u201cLittle brother, you are home safely. That is great. Mom and Dad were very worried.\u201dLu Jue said nothing.Mother Lu looked her son up and down and, after she had made sure that he was not injured, finally said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not stand around the front door any more. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dNing Zhi followed behind them.Walking in front, Lu Jue suddenly turned around and looked at her.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward and she hastened her pace.Xiao Juejue was starting to pay her attention!In the dining room, Mother Lu busied herself around Lu Jue. She finally let him back to his room to get some rest after he was done eating.Ning Zhi followed him upstairs.Lu Shenyuan showed up in the hallway all of a sudden.\u201cHow did you get back?\u201d He blocked in front of Lu Jue.Lu Jue said nothing. He did not react to what Lu Shenyuan was saying to him.Lu Shenyuan sighed, \u201cMom and Dad worried about you.\u201dNing Zhi frowned when she heard that.Lu Shenyuan\u2019s voice was low. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would be able to find your way home so quickly. Why did you still come back?\u201dNing Zhi was stunned when she heard Lu Shenyuan\u2019s words.She knew all along that Lu Shenyuan had bullied Lu Jue when they were children and that Lu Shenyuan had been a mean one but she chalked that up to him being young and didn\u2019t know any better. Hearing what Lu Shenyuan was saying now, she just looked at him in a whole different light.\u201cThe Lu family needs no fool.\u201d Lu Shenyuan went on to say. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201dNing Zhi thought she was hallucinating. Lu Shenyuan was belittling Lu Jue purposefully. How could he!Lu Shenyuan knew that Lu Jue would not respond to him. He smiled and walked away.Looking at the quiet Lu Jue and then back at Lu Shenyuan with the smug look on him, Ning Zhi was angry.Something occurred to Ning Zhi. She leaned into Lu Jue\u2019s ear with a smile and said, \u201cXiao Juejue, let me teach him a lesson for you.\u201d Having said that, she quickly ran after Lu Shenyuan.She spent one little sun so she could materialize.In the hallway, Lu Shenyuan seemed to have tripped over something. His entire body tumbled forward and he felt solidly onto the floor.Lu Shenyuan fell hard. His nose slammed against the floor and started to bleed.\u201cYoung Master, your nose is bleeding.\u201d A servant who walked past happened to saw Lu Shenyuan fell and quickly walked over to help him up.Lu Shenyuan didn\u2019t let them help him. Covering his nose with his hand, he turned and looked behind him. There was nothing on the ground.Lu Shenyuan frowned. For certain he had felt something that tripped him.Was he mistaken?Looking at Lu Shenyuan\u2019s disheveled look, Ning Zhi smiled like she was a little fox who had just stolen food. Once again, she felt that the power of the little suns was wonderful.Returning to the room, Lu Jue sat quietly on the bed.Ning Zhi walked over and told him, \u201cXiao Juejue, I\u2019ve taught Lu Shenyuan a lesson for you and caused him some pain.\u201dLu Jue looked up at her. He finally said after a long while, \u201cDisappear you.\u201dAre you about to disappear?Ning Zhi was surprised, \u201cOh, how are you so smart and know that I have to go soon?\u201dTheir meeting this time was short.Lu Jue looked at her quietly, \u201cNo leave.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not something that I have control over.\u201d Ning Zhi teased him purposefully. \u201cXiao Juejue, do you not want me to go?\u201dLu Jue\u2019s long and straight eyelashes fluttered and he said in a low voice, \u201cMmhmm.\u201dHe stood up, walked over to the dresser, opened up the top drawer and pulled out a colorful ribbon from inside of it.Lu Jue walked back over.\u201cWhat is the ribbon for?\u201d Ning Zhi was baffled.Lu Shao sat down next to Ning Zhi. \u201cTie you, no go.\u201dHe put one of his let next to Ning Zhi\u2019s then, bending over, he tied Ning Zhi\u2019s ankle and his together.Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that. She suddenly recalled how little Lu Jue had grabbed onto her hem so she wouldn\u2019t leave him and, now that he had grown, he had learned to tie her down.Nevertheless, Lu Jue quickly realized that the ribbon went right through Ning Zhi\u2019s leg and could not be used to tie her.He blinked. His lips shut and he looked at Ning Zhi blankly as though was asking her why did the ribbon went through her.To satisfy him, Ning Zhi spent another little sun so she could materialize. \u201cOkay, try again now.\u201dLu Jue noticed that the ribbon could be tied around Ning Zhi now.The girl\u2019s ankle was skinny and Lu Jue clumsily wrapped the ribbon around a few times, tying her ankle to his.Looking at the knot that Lu Jue had tied around them, Ning Zhi busted out laughing.There was a smile in Lu Jue\u2019s eyes as well. It was light, like little stars were embedded in them.This time, Ning Zhi did not cover up Lu Jue\u2019s eyes with her hand.She pinched his cheek a little. \u201cI have to go now.\u201dLu Jue blinked and the girl\u2019s pretty face turned blurry in front of him bit and bit. And then she was gone.The knot came lose and the colorful ribbon fell loosely onto his foot. The stars in little Lu Jue\u2019s eyes crumbled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - \"Xiao Jue Jue, thank you for hearing me.\" (1)___Extra part courtesy of Majiikayo, MG, Maggie, Christine G.L, DragonLady, HE-IA, and anon Ko-fi supporter. Thank you all so much!!! \\^o^/See Capybara\u2019s Hall of Fame.___Back to reality, Ning Zhi opened up her eyes slowly.Before this last trip, she had always viewed these as completing her assignments. She felt that little Lu Jue was pitiful and cute and that the whole experience was very noble.There was a dull feeling in her chest after she returned this time.She wished that little Lu Jue would remember his Sister Angel in the past but, now, she wished that he wouldn\u2019t. That way he couldn\u2019t count everyday until they meet again.The night was very quiet.Ning Zhi turned and looked at Lu Jue with his eyes closed. His outline was distinct under the dim light and all of the childishness was gone from his look. The hair over his forehead rested there submissively, as docile as little Lu Jue.She scooted over closer to him.Ning Zhi reached out stealthily, stroked his hair, and said tenderly, \u201cSweet dreams, Xiao Juejue.\u201dThe next day, the sun shined into the room through the floor-to-ceiling window. The light-blue colored curtains rustled in the soft breeze.Lu Jue had already gone jogging by the time Ning Zhi woke up. She had never once seen Lu Jue sleeping in, or napping. His biological clock was more precise than an alarm clock.She struggled for quite a while before she finally got out of bed.Someone knocked on the door at the same time.Ning Zhi opened up the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Aunty Hua?\u201dAunty Hua replied, \u201cMadam asked me to have you go downstairs.\u201dNing Zhi was baffled, \u201cDid she say what it is about?\u201dAunty Hua, \u201cThe expert that First Young Master had hired for Second Young Master had arrived. Madam wants you to accompany Second Young Master to the hospital.\u201dNing Zhi knew that Lu Shenyuan had mentioned that he was looking for a doctor for Lu Jue.After the few incidents of Lu Shenyuan setting up Lu Jue back in their childhood, Ning Zhi had a lot of doubts about Lu Shenyuan\u2019s concern for his brother.There was a possibility that he did what he did when he was a child because he was envious of Lu Jue and wanted to the adults\u2019 favorite or that they were just pranks because he had disliked Lu Jue. But he had grown into a good big brother who cared about his younger brother.Nevertheless, Ning Zhi leaned more toward the fact that Lu Shenyuan did not just become a good big brother. Instead, he was just putting up a front to fool those around him.\u201cOkay. I will.\u201d Ning Zhi, too, wanted to find out about Lu Jue\u2019s situation.Ning Zhi changed into a beige dress. Her skin was lighter now and a sweet color like this looked good on her.She went downstairs and found Mother Lu, Lu Shenyuan, and Lin Tiantian there. Father Lu had probably left for the office.Mother Lu looked like she was in good-spirit today and she said to Ning Zhi, \u201cAh, you are here. Let\u2019s accompany Xiao Jue to the hospital together after breakfast. The doctor is already there waiting for him.\u201dShe then went on to say that, \u201cXiao Jue resents the hospital quite a bit. You will need to try to talk him into it.\u201d Ning Zhi was the only one that he listened to.Ning Zhi nodded.She inadvertently glanced over at Lin Tiantian and was surprised to see a pimple above her lip and the dark circles under her eyes. She looked like she hadn\u2019t been well rested.Compared to the time when Lin Tiantian had 100% of the halo, she was already looking disheveled after losing just 20% of it.Ning Zhi felt that Lin Tiantian would lose her mind if she turned back into how she used to be. She was quite interested for the day to come.Lin Tiantian had been frantic the last few days. She had taken the pendant to be fixed and the crack on the jade had already been filled, leaving no signs that it was one broken.Nevertheless, she had learned that even with the jade fixed, she was still unable to take the halo back from Ning Zhi.Looking at Ning Zhi in front of her with her skin becoming better and her features more 3-dimensional, Lin Tiantian was very irritated and, at the same time, felt uneasy.Why was there a crack on her jade and why was it that when the halo returned to Ning Zhi, she wasn\u2019t able to take it back again?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - \"Xiao Jue Jue, thank you for hearing me.\" (2)Ning Zhi didn\u2019t care that Lin Tiantian was sneaking peeks at her nor was she worried that Lin Tiantian was aware that she had been taking her halo back. As a thief, it wasn\u2019t like Lin Tiantian could ask the original owner why she had taken back what was stolen from her.Lu Jue just returned from his morning jog.He had on red workout gear and there was sweat on his forehead, brow ridges, and his tall and straight nose.He was clear, cold, and sexy.Mother Lu knew that her son wouldn\u2019t hear her if she was to speak to her son directly. As such, she just had Ning Zhi communicate with him.Ning Zhi followed Lu Jue upstairs when he went to change and she said to him, \u201cLu Jue, I will go with you to the hospital after breakfast.\u201dLu Jue went inside of the bedroom quietly.Ning Zhi said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a checkup. I will be there to keep you company the entire time.\u201dLu Jue finally said after a long while, \u201cMmm.\u201dHe had just finished saying that when he took his clothes off right in front of Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi didn\u2019t turn away in time and her eyes looked straight at his chest area.Board and sturdy, with a thin layer of muscles. They were evenly distributed without an extra ounce.Her sight moved lower, onto the distinct lines, and continued to go lower till they were blocked by his pants.Ning Zhi had touched that area before. She even obtained 14 little suns from that. She didn\u2019t think that somewhere that was so pleasant to the touch was also pleasant to the sight.Lu Jue\u2019s hand landed on a floral shirt that was sitting on top of the dresser but, with Ning Zhi standing next to him, he passed over the floral shirt with his lips shut and grabbed a red shirt instead.After Lu Jue had put his shirt on, Ning Zhi saw his hands reaching for the waistband of his pants. She was just about to turn away when she was dazzled by some loud colors.Inside the hospital.The doctor performed examination and evaluation on Lu Jue along with his mental state. Physical and psychological evaluations and a series of supplementary examinations.Ning Zhi looked nervously at the autism behavior scale that the doctor was holding in his hand. She had already saved Lu Jue four times. She felt that Lu Jue\u2019s autism had been getting better as of late.Lu Jue would never look at her or meet her eyes in the past but now his eyes would linger on her face for a few seconds and sometimes he would even meet her eyes.Ning Zhi was waiting outside when the result came out.Because of her looks, Lin Tiantian had already had her agent moved her filming dates. She wanted to see the disappointment and pain on Ning Zhi, which was why she accompanied Mother Lu to the hospital.She walked over to Ning Zhi. Being close up to Ning Zhi, she could see that not only was Ning Zhi skin fairer, even her features were more delicate. Ning Zhi was no longer the plain-looking girl who had lost all of her halo.Lin Tiantian\u2019s eyes darkened a bit. She was unhappy.She said to Ning Zhi, \u201cLu Jue had lost control of himself twice recently. He had been getting worst. It\u2019s best that we have the doctor write him out a prescription for controlling his symptoms.\u201dNing Zhi lifted her brows. \u201cAre you the doctor? Do you decide whether he needs prescription medications?\u201dLin Tiantian stopped breathing for a second. She then said attentively to Ning Zhi, \u201cIf Lu Jue\u2019s condition continues to get worse, he will become more impulsive and attack other people. He might even become suicidal. Putting him on prescription drugs is the way to keep him and others safe.\u201cAs someone close to him, you run the biggest risk.\u201d Lin Tiantian stared intensely at Ning Zhi as she talked and studied her closely. She wanted to see pain on Ning Zhi and her resentment toward Lu Jue.Nevertheless, she detected neither of those.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - \"Xiao Jue Jue, thank you for hearing me.\" (3)Ning Zhi looked at Lin Tiantian calmly, almost somewhat cold, and said to her, \u201cThe doctor\u2019s diagnosis is not even out yet. How are you so sure that his condition had been getting worse. Or, are you telling me that you can see into the future?\u201dLin Tiantian was stunned by the coldness in Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes. She recalled her dream and was frantic. She explained herself, \u201cYou used to share your worries with me. I care about you is all. If you don\u2019t want to hear what I have to say, I\u2019ll just keep my mouth shut.\u201dNing Zhi was blunt. \u201cYou are not worried about me. You just wanted to listen to me gripe and make fun of my misfortune. Lin Tiantian, stop treating others like they are fools.\u201dLin Tiantian was taken aback a little. She had never seen Ning Zhi being so aggressive in the past.She wanted to explain herself.Ning Zhi cut her off. \u201cWe are at a hospital. Can you keep your mouth shut?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Lin Tiantian walked away with her face beet red. Whether it was from anger or embarrassment, only she would know.Ning Zhi hrumphed and summoned Overlord. \u201cI still have three little suns. Give me 3 more percent of my halo.\u201dOverlord\u2019s happiest time was when Ning Zhi trade in her little suns. [Yes, Host.] With her 20% from before and 3 more percent right now, she had taken back a total of 23% of her halo now.Overlord had told her in the past that the halo she had gotten back through spending little suns could not be taken away from her again by Lin Tiantian.That was the reason why Lin Tiantian wasn\u2019t able to take away Ning Zhi\u2019s halo again, even after she had her jade fixed.The second that the exchange took place, Ning Zhi could see that her skin tone was another shade lighter. But the amount was less than before; as such, the result wasn\u2019t as obvious.Lin Tiantian, who had walked back over to Lu Shenyuan, still had anger in her eyes. Not only was Ning Zhi\u2019s attitude toward her changed completely, Ning Zhi was also antagonizing her all the time and her words were blunt.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lu Shenyuan noticed that his wife looked off.Lin Tiantian bit her lip and said, \u201cI guess Xiao Zhi is anxious and isn\u2019t in a good mood. I was trying to comfort her earlier and she snapped at me.\u201dLu Shenyuan frowned. \u201cShe bullied you when you when you were concerned about her? You just might be doing yourself a disfavor for being such a nice person.\u201dLin Tiantian smiled shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dLu Shenyuan patted her on her head in a doting way. \u201cI\u2019ll feel bad about it.\u201d Granted, that was part of the reason that he had fallen for her.Lin Tiantian blushed even more.\u201cYour eyes\u2026\u2026\u201d In that very instant, Lu Shenyuan thought there was something wrong with his eyes.With a shy look, Lin Tiantian asked, \u201cWhat about my eyes?\u201d She looked at him and blinked.Ever since she had stolen Ning Zhi\u2019s halo, her fair skin wasn\u2019t the only thing that she was happy about. There were also her eyes.Back at the Lin family, she had always been envious of Ning Zhi\u2019s natural-born beautiful pair of limpid eyes. They were big and bright and, when she smiled and her brows and eyes curved, they looked like they had stardust in them.When Ning Zhi cried and tears welled up in her eyes, it made others wanted to drown in her tears.Lin Tiantian dreamed about having a pair of eyes that resembled Ning Zhi\u2019s and her wish had come true.Although her eyes were still not as pretty as Ning Zhi\u2019s but, under the effect of the halo, her eyes were now almond-shaped. They were limpid and pretty.Even Lu Shenyuan loved to kiss her on her eyes when he was feeling affectionate.Lu Shenyuan frowned and felt that he was hallucinating.Lin Tiantian\u2019s original eyes were spiritual and limpid so why was it that they looked so ordinary all of a sudden?Being looked at by Lu Shenyuan so lovingly, Lin Tiantian blushed and said tenderly, \u201cDon\u2019t keep staring at me like that.\u201dLu Shenyuan looked away and, not giving anything away, said, \u201cThe doctor\u2019s here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - \"Xiao Jue Jue, thank you for hearing me.\" (4)Ning Zhi and Mother Lu were the first to ask the doctor of the outcome.The doctor told them that Lu Jue was mid-level autistic right now.Which meant that he had come a long way from the advanced level that he once was.\u201cHe isn\u2019t getting worse?\u201d Lin Tiantian blurted out. Recalling what she had said to Ning Zhi just a little while ago, she felt like she had been faceslapped.Ning Zhi turned and stared at her. \u201cYou sounded like you wish Lu Jue is getting worse.\u201d\u201cOf course not. Why would I think that?\u201d Lin Tiantian quickly explained herself when she said Mother Lu\u2019s displeased look. \u201cI am so happy to hear that Lu Jue is getting better.\u201dNing Zhi couldn\u2019t be bothered to engage with her.Lu Shenyuan chimed in, \u201cDoctor, do we know what made my brother better? I want to know if we can find out the cause behind it. That way we can make sure he can continue to get better.\u201dDoctor, \u201cMiss Ning\u2019s influence on Mr. Lu had a lot to do with it.\u201dThrough his evaluation, the doctor had seen the interaction between his patient with Ning Zhi. He could tell that the patient would listen to Ning Zhi and the two had no problems communicating.Mother Lu quickly told the doctor. \u201cThat is right. Xiao Jue always listens to Xiao Zhi.\u201dMother Lu couldn't help but burst into a smile. It was such a good decision on her part to have Ning Zhi married her son.\u201cDo we need to prescribe him with medication from this point forward?\u201d asked Lu Shenyuan.Ning Zhi gave him a look.Doctor, \u201cThe patient does not need medications right now. Truth was, as far as Mr. Lu\u2019s condition is concerned, Miss Ning is more effective to him than any medications.\u201dLu Shenyuan nodded. \u201cOkay. We get it now.\u201dAfter they had returned home.Mother Lu\u2019s smile never went away. \u201cXiao Zhi, thank you for all of your hard work recently taking care of Xiao Jue. Look at you. You lost so much weight.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard work. Lu Jue was very docile.\u201dNing Zhi wasn\u2019t just saying that to be nice. Lu Jue had always been quiet and stayed in his own world for the most part. She didn\u2019t need to do much for him except to go back in time to save him.Ning Zhi had been skeptical about what Overlord had told her in the past. Now that Lu Jue was getting better. She no longer questioned Overlord\u2019s words.Mother Lu patted Ning Zhi on her hand happily. She turned her head and had the chef made Ning Zhi some nutritious soup.Lin Tiantian, on the other hand, was not very happy. She felt that things had been deviating from her plans greatly as of late.Lu Jue was getting better; Mother Lu was growing more and more fond of Ning Zhi. To make matters worse, her jade had cracked and the halo had been returning to Ning Zhi.All the incidents gravitated in Ning Zhi\u2019s favor.Lin Tiantian was becoming more and more frantic.Ning Zhi ignored Lin Tiantian\u2019s unfriendly look and walked over to Lu Jue.Lu Jue\u2019s lips were shut and his eyes lowered.Autistic people hide cautiously in their own world and others would need to pay a lot more love and tenderness than normal to be able to crack their little hard shells bit by bit.Ning Zhi held his hand and ran the tip of her finger through his palm. \u201cXiao Juejue, thank you for hearing me.\u201dLu Jue looked up at her.Ning Zhi was still lamenting the second before but, the very next second, she changed the subject.Smiling, she looked like an evil person who was trying to entice a child to commit a bad act. \u201cYou have never played this game called Plants v Zombies, right? Let me download it for you. There is this sunflower in the game that can produce little suns. It was amazing!\u201dHe needed to take a page from the sunflower\u2019s book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - The Beautify feature shut itself off all of a sudden. (1)Ever since the last time when Ning Zhi received a bunch of little suns, Lu Jue never provided her with any new ones when she touched him at the same spot again.She needed to come up with a new way to have him generate little suns.Ning Zhi returned to their bedroom holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand.She quickly downloaded the Plants v Zombies game. \u201cLu Jue, let me teach you this game.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter whether he learned the game or not. Her purpose was not to teach him how to play the game. He only needed to keep popping out little suns like the sun flowers in the game.Sitting down next to Lu Jue with her cellphone in her hand, she pointed the screen at him. \u201cThis is the sun flower. Its purpose is to generate little suns and they will serve as energy for the other tools.\u201dNing Zhi paused all of a sudden. Ning Zhi was just like a sunflower that could produce little suns.He was providing her with energy.Ning Zhi gave him a meaningful look. Lu Jue\u2019s eyes were lowered. He had deep contours and sharp eyebrows, much prettier than a sun flower.\u201cLook, I plant the seed like this and it will start producing little suns,\u201d said Ning Zhi seriously. \u201cDid you see how the little suns pop out?\u201dNing Zhi asked tenderly, \u201cYou get it now?\u201dLu Jue looked on expressionlessly. No little suns popped into the indicator above his head like the sun flower in the game.\u201cDo you feel that the sun flower that can produce little suns is very cute?\u201d Ning Zhi handed her phone over to Lu Jue. \u201cHere, you give it a try.\u201dLu Jue blinked and gave Ning Zhi a look. \u201cChildish you.\u201dThe game was childish as was she.Ning Zhi stared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s so childish about it? The sun flower that can produce little suns is so cute.\u201d She tempted him. \u201cIf you can produce little suns, you will be cuter than it though.\u201dLu Jue did not respond to that and still nothing inside his indicator.Ning Zhi was a little discouraged. Earning little suns was harder than earning money.Ning Zhi showed Lu Jue an entire game. She killed off all the zombies and the little suns produced by the sun flower covered the entire screen. Lu Jue still did not respond to that.\u201cOne more time?\u201d Ning Zhi suggested.Lu Jue put down the phone and was about to head to the study. It was now time for him to read.Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t going to let him go so easily. She tugged at Lu Jue\u2019s clothes and, while he was still dazed, pushed him down onto the bed.Ning Zhi reached her hands over and started tickling Lu Jue on both sides. \u201cLaugh.\u201dLu Jue, forced to lay down on his back, looked quietly at Ning Zhi towering over him with his black eyes.Ning Zhi tickled him gently through his clothes but he did not react to that at all, not even to avoid her.Was he not ticklish?Ning Zhi tentatively reached her hands under his clothes. The tips of her fingers touched his slender but strong waist.She tried again to tickle him.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you laugh?\u201d Desperate, Ning Zhi even pinched him a little on his waist.Lu Jue blinked. He continued to look quietly at Ning Zhi while she kept on trying.Ning Zhi leaned into him, her lips touching his ear.Ever since she noticed that touching Lu Jue\u2019s ear would product little suns, she had tried a few more times after that but there were no more little suns. Same with his stomach. She tried touching him a few more times there later on and also no little suns.Now, she tried doing both at the same time.She moved her hand from the side of his waist to over his stomach while she gently touch his ear with her lips. She asked him softly, \u201cWhat about this? Do you like this?\u201d\u201cSmile?\u201d\u201cLu Jue, why do you have to be so difficult.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - The Beautify feature shut itself off all of a sudden. (2)With her body weight on top of him, his eyelashes that were lowered fluttered.One little sun popped up inside of the indicator.Noticing that her strategy was working, Ning Zhi, pleasantly surprised, touched Lu Jue\u2019s ear with her lips again while placing her hand firmly in his waist and stomach area.The second little sun!Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved. More!She only wished she could squeeze Lu Jue dry.Nevertheless, no more little suns appeared in the indicator after the second little sun. She could feel that Lu Jue\u2019s body was tense, especially where she was touching him. He should be feeling something. So why were there no little suns appearing?Ning Zhi was a little upset. Parting her lips a bit, she bit down on Lu Jue\u2019s ear.The third little sun!Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes beamed. Yup. She could get more if she just pressed hard.Lu Jue\u2019s ear was meaty and soft. Ning Zhi had it between her teeth and she slowly moved her teeth over it.The fourth little sun!Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes lit up. She continued to nibble little Lu Jue\u2019s ear softly.The fifth little sun!The sixth little sun!Little sun after little sun popped out of the indicator and rushed toward Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward as she saw the sea of shiny golden color in front of her eyes. Keeping her excitement under control, she continued to torture the earlobe between her lips.Ning Zhi finally let go of Lu Jue\u2019s ear between her teeth when there were no more little suns.By now, his ear was already slow red that it looked like it could start bleeding at any moment. It was hot, as though broken from being toyed with for too long.Lu Jue laid there quietly and his lips were shut tightly. His lowered eyelid fluttered nonstop along with his long and straight eyelashes.Looking at the battered poor little earlobe, Ning Zhi\u2019s heart softened. She wrapped her lips around it one more time and kissed it.The seventh little sun!The eight little sun!The ninth little sun!\u2026\u2026On the bed, Lu Jue\u2019s bangs were slightly disheveled. His pair of cherry blossom eyes black and limpid, his ears red. Anyway one looked at him, he looked exactly like a tool that had been thoroughly used by Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi counted the 15 little suns that she had just gotten from Lu Jue!She was rich all over again!With a satisfied look, Ning Zhi summoned the Overlord. \u201cHow many little suns will I need to go back to save Lu Jue next time?\u201dThe Overlord replied with a guilty conscience in his milky voice: {Host, you will need 30 little suns for your 5th trip back.}\u201cWhat? I think I\u2019ve misheard. Can you please repeat yourself?\u201dOverlord: [Host, you will need 30 little suns.]Ning Zhi was so upset that she grinded her teeth together. \u201cWhy so many? The first time required 1 little sun, the second time required 3, the third time required 5, the fourth time required 10 little suns. I thought doubling the requirement of the previous time was pretty bad already. Lo and behold, I still estimated it. This next time will take 30 little suns?\u201dThat was horrible. The little suns didn\u2019t come by easily.She had just squeezed Lu Jue dry and all she got was 15 little suns. They weren\u2019t even warmed up in her hands yet!The Overlord felt unjustified: [Host, the further down this path we go, the more little suns it will take but, you are also looking at more marked improvement with Lu Jue\u2019s illness.]Ning Zhi went silent when she heard that it would further improve Lu Jue\u2019s condition.After all, autism was not curable in real life. Now that they had the opportunity to cure Lu Jue, even tens and thousands of dollars would be worth it, let along all it took was just little suns from Lu Jue.Ning Zhi sighed. \u201cOkay. I get it. I want to exchange for 10% of my halo this time!\u201dShe would need 30 little suns for her next trip to save Lu Jue. What she currently had was not remotely enough.She exchanged for 10% of her halo and saved the remaining 5.Overlord quickly accepted 10 little suns. Had it had a physical body, Ning Zhi would see it smiling at her with is mouth cracked open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - The Beautify feature shut itself off all of a sudden. (3)The Overlord had, once again, felt that he was with a worthy host. In comparison, Fugui, his brother, had it much worse. He only got chump change golden cotton candy from his host. And their other brother, Baofu, was still looking for a host and starved in the meantime!No, wait. Not only did Overlord feel that he had married the right host. Most importantly, his host married the right person.After all, they would not be able to find a second person who could churn out little suns like Lu Jue could!Ning Zhi traded for 10% halo and, immediately, noticed that her skin had became fairer.She had already gotten back 33% of her halo.Ning Zhi quickly went to check in the mirror. She was pleasantly surprised when she said that her skin was now fair and clear and almost looked watery, like another layer of grey gauze had been ripped off. Her features were brighter and more prominent.She blinked. Her pair of dark eyes were bright and lively and they weren\u2019t dull like they were before.Ning Zhi noticed that her nose was perkier and her little mouth red and glossy.She had gone another level up from being moderately attractive to delicate.Ning Zhi touched her hair behind her back. It was black, bright, and smooth. It was no longer dry and have split ends like when she had first transmigrated over.Best of all was her chest area. She didn\u2019t measure it with her hands but the weight increase told her that they had gotten bigger.Ning Zhi was pleased. She looked forward to the day she could regain her beauty!Lin Tiantian received a call from her agent and headed over to the studio.She recalled that she had a live streaming today and she had signed the contract on it. Words had gotten out and her fans had been looking forward to it. It\u2019d be difficult to cancel it last minute.Before their start time, her assistant had talked to the host and confirmed about using filters to make her look skinnier.\u201cSister Tiantian, I had confirmed with the other side and they are okay with that.\u201d Her assistant walked over with the agenda. \u201cWe will start at 7:30 PM sharp.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLin Tiantian entered when it was time.Her fans talked nonstop on the screen, \u201cTiantian is so pretty today.\u201d\u201cHere comes our sweetheart on earth.\u201d\u201cI came here for Lin Tiantian. Tiantian is so pretty today.\u201d\u201cTiantian-zihas a lot of makeup on today. Her eye makeup too. But that\u2019s alright, she\u2019s still very pretty.\u201d\u201cAh, the live stream is finally starting. Let\u2019s get it going.\u201d\u201cI skipped dinner just to wait for Tiantian. Are all the fans here?\u201d\u201cTiantian is so pretty today. Have you lost some weight?\u201d\u201cTiantian\u2019s skin is so fair. I wish I have that too!\u201d\u201cOh mi. How is it possible that a woman can be that pretty? I wish she is mine.\u201d\u2026\u2026Lin Tiantian greeted her fans from the room. Her smile was sweet and she said, poised, \u201cHi everyone. I am so glad to see you all here today.\u201dThe male host had always heard that Lin Tiantian\u2019s beauty was top notch in the entertainment circle and that she was even prettier in person than in front of the screen. Meeting her today, he felt that that was an overstatement. She was pretty but not to the point of stunning.The male host, \u201cLet\u2019s welcome Lin Tiantian one more time to our studio.\u201cSister Tiantian, our fans are very curious how are you able to keep your skin so nice.\u201dFrom the screen, Lin Tiantian sat there properly with a smile on her. \u201cEven though all stars put a lot of effort into maintaining themselves but my work is busy so a lot of times, I don\u2019t have to time to take care of myself at all.\u201dThe male host, \u201cAh, so I guess Sister Tiantian\u2019s skin is all natural. You are just very blessed that way.\u201dLin Tiantian smiled and did not disagree with him.Her fans went nuts on the screen, \u201cTiantian-zi is the prettiest ever!\u201d\u201cI went to the airport to saw her in person last time. She was really fair. That\u2019s not something any skincare products can accomplish.\u201d\u201cI have seen her in person as well. Lin Tiantian was truly fair. She had very little makeup on at the time and her features were pretty. She was so pretty that she looked like she was glowing.\u201d\u201cLittle Tiantian is all natural and had no work done on her before. Unlike some celebrities who refer to plastic surgery as a \u2018medical procedure\u2019!\u201d\u2026\u2026Lin Tiantian\u2019s smile deepened when she saw what her fans were saying.More and more fans joined the streaming was choppy.Lin Tiantian thanked her fans for their support when, all of a sudden, the beauty filter turned itself off.At the very same time, the millions of fans of hers instantly saw that her skin darkened by a shade and her tapered chin turned squarish.They could even see pimples on her. All of the fairness and smoothness from earlier were gone!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Shocked, Ning Zhi reflexively pushed Lu Jue out of its way. (1)Everybody was stunned.\u201cOh darn. What just happened? The beautify feature was turned off?\u201d\u201cWith the beautify feature turned off, Lin Tiantian\u2019s face shape had changed. What happened to her tapered face?\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u2026 that was some filter. Whatever happened to the beauty who didn\u2019t need any makeup?\u201d\u201cThe beautify feature was turned off abruptly? That was surprising. Lin Tiantian\u2019s real person looked somewhat different than she did with the beautify feature. \u201c\u201cHere I thought Lin Tiantian was a true beauty. I am somewhat disappointed after the filter was turned off.\u201d\u201cTiantian looks pretty whichever way. I like that she isn\u2019t a generic face that one will see on the internet. She\u2019s pretty even without the beautify feature. We will all be happy if we can look like her.\u201d\u201cI saw that she has pimples. I thought articles online said that her skin was like a peeled-egg.\u201d\u201cWell, how should I say it? She\u2019s still pretty without the filter but not as stunning as she was said to be.\u201d\u201cHow come her nose is so flat?\u201d\u2026\u2026Reading what the fans were saying, the male host quickly looked for a worker and asked them what had happened.Lin Tiantian was stunned.She looked at herself on the screen in disbelief.Even with the filter off, her skin was still fair and her cheekbones were hidden by her hair and were not obvious.But now, her skin color had become even darker and her normally smooth face was covered in pimples. Most importantly, her cheekbones had become even more prominent and started resembling how she used to look.What happened?How did she become uglier all of a sudden?Lin Tiantian was frantic. She had just become uglier in front of millions of fans.When the beautify feature was turned on again, the male host quickly tried to manage the situation. \u201cOops, we had run into some minor hiccups. Let\u2019s do some drawings right now\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Tiantian, reading all the comments in front of so many fans, she couldn\u2019t sit still nor could she just take off.Thinking that a crack might have appeared on her jade again, she could barely maintain her smile.After the live stream was over, the beautify feature being turned off abruptly during Lin Tiantian\u2019s show went up on the most trending list.Lin Tiantian\u2019s agent handed their phone over to her. \u201cI had someone taking care of that already. We\u2019ll lower its popularity.\u201dFlipping through the articles on the most trending list, Lin Tiantian looked more and more disturbed.\u201cLin Tiantian losing her looks that was once the best in the entertainment circle?\u201d\u201cBoy, Lin Tiantian looked frantic when the filter was turned off suddenly.\u201d\u201cAll her fans ever talked about everyday was how pretty she was. They referred to her as little sweet heart snow white. With the filter off, her skin tone was more or less the same as any other girls.\u201d\u201cYou called that losing her looks? Why don\u2019t you post your own picture online so we can if you are prettier than Lin Tiantian.\u201d\u201cPoor Lin Tiantian, being criticized even with her looks. Is that really necessary?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m purely a bystander. Lin Tiantian\u2019s true look really isn\u2019t as pretty as she was in her pictures. And her skin was not as flawless as advertised. Her face was square and her nose not delicate and perky. Was it a flopped plastic surgery or that all of her past photos were edited?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so speechless. How could you say that she\u2019s not pretty? Can you even back your own words?\u201d\u201cHahaha, to think that all of her fans had been saying how she was the prettiest woman in the entertainment circle.\u201d\u2026\u2026Lin Tiantian asked her agent. \u201cThe water armies are at work already?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d The agent studied Lin Tiantian. \u201cHow come I feel that you looked different after the live stream? And what\u2019s with all the pimples?\u201dLin Tiantian looked away, not being able to look her agent in their eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well lately.\u201dShe was in a bad mood right now. Awful, in fact. She suddenly realized that each time she became uglier, Ning Zhi would become prettier.It wasn\u2019t until the evening when Ning Zhi saw the most trending list.She knew that Lin Tiantian\u2019s look would change when she took back 10% of her halo. She just didn\u2019t know that Lin Tiantian was on a live stream at the time. Her looks changed in front of so many fans and, worse of all, the beautify feature was turned off inadvertently.How exciting was that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Shocked, Ning Zhi reflexively pushed Lu Jue out of its way. (2)Ning Zhi enjoyed the melon for a while and noticed that Lin Tiantian\u2019s articles kept dropping on the most trending list and were almost falling off. In addition, all of the comments were positive. It was quite obvious that the water armies had joined in.It would appear that Lin Tiantian\u2019s team was behind this operation.Ning Zhi narrowed her eyes some. She somewhat looked forward to seeing how Lin Tiantian\u2019s fans would react when she returned to her original look.The bathroom door opened from the inside and Lu Jue walked out after taking a shower. He had on a red silky pajama, which made him look even more clear and handsome.Walking over to the bed, he saw that Ning Zhi was applying lotion on herself.After a little while, when Ning Zhi was done with what she was doing, she turned and noticed that Lu Jue was still sitting there quietly and hasn\u2019t yet laid down.\u201cHow come you are not in bed yet?\u201d Ning Zhi walked over and turned the lights off, leaving only the table lamp on the night table.Lu Jue finally laid down after she had crawled into bed.Something occurring to her all of a sudden, Ning Zhi rolled to her side, facing Lu Jue who was laying flat on his back and asked, \u201cYou were waiting for me?\u201dLu Jue voice was low in the dark, \u201cMmm.\u201dNing Zhi was somewhat surprised and somewhat happy.She still remembered how Lu Jue was angry that she wanted to share the bed with him on her first night there. There were even black clouds with lightning in his indicator.It hasn\u2019t even been that long and he had already started waiting for her. That was quite an improvement.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved from smiling. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that you waited for me.\u201dLu Jue kept his lips shut and, after a long while, he leaned his head over at Ning Zhi. His low and dull voice was particular clear in the night. \u201cGive you ear to kiss, to kiss.\u201dLu Jue reached his hand over and placed it over Ning Zhi\u2019s hand that was resting on top of the blanket. He repeated himself, \u201cGive you ear.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWas the little silly thing asking for her to kiss him on his ear?Ning Zhi recalled reading from online that autistic people would touch the back of someone\u2019s hand when they wanted something and, once they got what they wanted, they would go back to ignoring the others.Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved. She asked, \u201cWill you be happy if I kiss you on your ear?\u201dLu Jue blinked. His beautiful cherry-blossom eyes were blank.\u201cI am going to bed if you don\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Ning Zhi was mean. She couldn't help but wanted to tease him.She yawned purposefully before closing her eyes.Lu Jue\u2019s hand that was resting on her tightened. He said slowly, \u201cHappy.\u201dNing Zhi couldn't help but chuckled. She opened up her eyes, \u201cOkay, beg me then.\u201d It had always been her who had been begging to make him happy.Lu Jue had no idea what self-esteem was. \u201cPlease.\u201dThe fringe over his forehead laid there nicely. His eyes were limpid and bright. He looked docile between his brows and eyes and it was difficult to say no to him.Ning Zhi leaned into his ear and gently touched him with her lips.Lu Jue\u2019s eyelids shuddered.She parted her lips and nibbled his little ear just like she did in the afternoon.One little sun!And then, that was it.Ning Zhi grinded his soft earlobe with her teeth but still, there was nothing.Was he milked dry this afternoon?She let go of his ear. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done.\u201dLu Jue looked at her blanket. He seemed unsatisfied.Ning Zhi reached her hand out and pinched him on his cheek. \u201cNow go to bed.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s lips pinched shut. He scooted back to his own spot reluctantly.Ning Zhi found that amusing. She wondered whether she would be able to gain little suns again if she gave it a little break and try again after some time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Shocked, Ning Zhi reflexively pushed Lu Jue out of its way. (3)Mother Lu gave Ning Zhi two tickets to a art show on Saturday and suggested for her to bring Lu Jue with her.The artist was known to use bright colors and Mother Lu felt that Lu Jue might like that.Ning Zhi changed into a light green dress on her way out. She has fair skin now and this color worked very well on her. It gave her a mystical feel.Lu Jue picked out a green shirt with flowers on it and Ning Zhi vetoed that right away. If he was to walk out in floral pattern, he would sure be the most eye-catching boy on the street.Finally, Lu Jue changed into a read silk shirt. With is light-colored skin, he was able to work that bright red color.The top two buttons of his shirt were undone, which accentuated his Adam's apple. That, along with his clear, handsome, and restrained face could easily make one\u2019s heart skip a beat.Ning Zhi held his hand and her petite and soft fingers interlaced with his.She told him, \u201cThere will be many people at the art show. You let me know if you don\u2019t feel well.\u201dLu Jue acknowledged her.There were a lot of guests at the exhibition and all of them were dressed nice with extraordinary temperament.Ning Zhi held Lu Jue\u2019s hand. Lu Jue\u2019s grip would tighten reflexively whenever someone walked past him and would also lean toward Ning Zhi at the same time. He kept his eyes lowered, not daring to look around.\u201cLu Jue, do you like this painting?\u201d Ning Zhi brought him in front of a painting and tried to distract him.She did have much interest in painting but her father used to be a collector of famous paintings. She had seen enough to know some about them.In the painting was a woman. She was pretty with a hint of shyness in her eyes. The painting was quite vivid.Lu Jue\u2019s look didn\u2019t change much. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWell, which one do you like?\u201d Ning Zhi was merely asking casually. She mainly brought him out so he could be exposed to environments with more people more often.Lu Jue looked up. Quickly looking around, he pointed at a painting hanging on the wall across from them and said, \u201cThat. Like.\u201dNing Zhi looked in the direction that he was pointing.It was a painting of peonies. The glorious and bright red flowers reminded her of one of his fancy pajamas. It, too, had these big red flowers on it.Ning Zhi smiled and said, \u201cOkay. We can buy it if you like it.\u201dSuddenly, she saw Huo Xiaoyue across from them and locked eyes with her.Huo Xiaoyue walked over pushing Huo Xiaoyue in his wheelchair, \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201dNoticing Lu Jue next to Ning Zhi after she had said that, Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s eyes lit up all of a sudden. Lu Jue, in his red shirt, was too eye-catching.She said happily, \u201cLu Jue, you\u2019ve come too.\u201dLu Jue lowered his head as though he didn\u2019t hear her.\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d said Ning Zhi.Huo Xiaoyue hrumphed. \u201cI am here with my brother. There are so many people here. Why did you bring Lu Jue with you? Don\u2019t you know that he\u2019s afraid to be around people?\u201dNing Zhi said to her, \u201cI\u2019ll help him get used to it slowly.\u201dLu Jue had been much more stable than when she had first transmigrated over. At least he hadn\u2019t had an episode as of late.Looking at the couple in green and red respectively, Huo Xiaoyue suddenly noticed that the two of them made a good couple. That hurt her eyes. \u201cAnd how are you going to accomplish that? If he suddenly loses control and runs out into the street, will you be able to stop him?\u201d\u201cXiaoyue!\u201d Huo Xiaoyang stopped his sister.Huo Xiaoyue hrumphed and lost her haughty air. She said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m just reminding her was all.\u201dHuo Xiaoyang looked up from his wheelchair and looked at Ning Zhi.He didn\u2019t have his glasses on today and she could see his long and narrow eyes. \u201cI apologize, Miss Ning. My sister is rash but she meant no harm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Ning Zhi had an idea about Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s personality after their several encounters.Huo Xiaoyue pursed her lips some.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Shocked, Ning Zhi reflexively pushed Lu Jue out of its way. (4)\u201cI am a friend of the host of the art exhibition. You can give them my name should Miss Ning and Mr. Lu decide to make a purchase,\u201d said Huo Xiaoyang gently.Ning Zhi nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201dNing Zhi held Lu Jue\u2019s hand and prepared to take off. As she turned her head, Ning Zhi suddenly noticed a black cloud with lightning in the indicator above Lu Jue\u2019s head.He was upset?Huo Xiaoyue looked from Ning Zhi to Lu Jue before she left with her brother in his wheelchair.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Ning Zhi asked Lu Jue softly. \u201cWhy are you upset?\u201dLu Jue looked up at her. His look lingered for a few seconds on Ning Zhi before he turned away quickly. \u201cHe, not like.\u201dAfter a short pause, he added, \u201cDislike him.\u201d\u201cYou dislike Huo Xiaoyue?\u201d*\u201cNo.\u201d Lu Jue frowned. \u201cHim.\u201dNing Zhi hesitated a little, then asked, \u201cYou dislike Huo Xiaoyue\u2019s brother?\u201dHis lips shut tight, Lu Jue answered in a low voice, \u201cMmm.\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201dNing Zhi recalled Huo Xiaoyue telling her that her brother had saved Lu Jue in the past. So why was it that Lu Jue disliked Huo Xiaoyang?Lu Jue did not answer her.Ning Zhi purchased the painting of the big, red peonies before they took off. Only a painting like that would match Lu Jue\u2019s taste.Ning Zhi arranged for the painting to be delivered to the Lu\u2019s and she planned to wander around outside for a bit with Lu Jue.When they walked out of the building, Ning Zhi walked with Lu Jue toward where their car was parked.Suddenly, a black car gunned straight at them at high speed. Shocked, Ning Zhi reflexively pushed Lu Jue away.The car made no intention to stop continued toward Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi jumped out of its way and the car brushed right past Ning Zhi and she fell onto the ground.The car took off quickly.The bodyguards behind them rushed up. Some of them hopped into a car to follow the other car and two stayed to protect Ning Zhi and Lu Jue.\u201cAre you hurt, Second Young Mistress?\u201dLu Jue went up immediately. He reached his hand out wanting to help Ning Zhi back up. There were panic in his beautiful cherry-blossom eyes. \u201cHold you. Hold you.\u201dNing Zhi placed her hand on his and got up slowly. She had just stood back up when she realized that she had sprained her ankle. \u201cI\u2019ve sprained my ankle.\u201dIn front of the building, Huo Xiaoyue, who had just come downstairs with her brother, happened to witness Ning Zhi narrowly missed being hit by the car.Shocked, Huo Xiaoyue said, \u201cWas the car aiming at Ning Zhi or Lu Jue?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go over there and see if they need any help.\u201d\u201cBig Brother, didn\u2019t you say you needed to head into the office?\u201dHuo Xiaoyang, \u201cLet\u2019s go and check on them first.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue had no choice but to push her brother over there.With her ankle sprained, Ning Zhi had no choice but to have Lu Jue support her.Huo Xiaoyue took a look at her foot, hrumphed but didn\u2019t say anything mean.Huo Xiaoyang had on a white shirt today. He was decorous and handsome looking. Being wheelchair bound did not make him any less attractive.\u201cMiss Ning and Mr. Lu, you seemed to have gotten into a little bit of trouble. Is there anything that we can help you with?\u201d He asked.Ning Zhi nodded and thanked him. \u201cWe got this so far.\u201d\u201cSee? I\u2019ve told you not to take Lu Jue out. You almost had an accident,\u201d said Huo Xiaoyue. \u201cDid you offend someone?\u201dNing Zhi shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201d They would have to wait and see if the bodyguards were able to catch up to the car.\u201cMiss Ning\u2019s foot was injured. Do you need us to take you to the hospital?\u201d Huo Xiaoyang noticed that Ning Zhi was standing on one foot and not putting weight on the other.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Our chauffeur can take me.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue pursed her lips. It\u2019s not like we have time anyway.\u201dNing Zhi was already used to the way that Huo Xiaoyue talked by now.With Lu Jue\u2019s support, Ning Zhi planned to take off. When Ning Zhi turned her head, she now saw two black clouds with lightning in Lu Jue\u2019s indicator.He was getting angrier than before?___Translator's notes:He/him/she/her all pronounced the same in Chinese. Which was why Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t sure immediately which one he was referring to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - It looked like Lu Jue still has a lot of potential left in him. (1)Ning Zhi finally asked him after they had gotten into the car, \u201cSo why do you dislike Huo Xiaoyue and her brother?\u201dLu Jue looked over at Ning Zhi. His gaze remained on Ning Zhi for a few seconds but he didn\u2019t say a word.Ning Zhi was baffled, \u201cHe had bullied you in the past?\u201dHuo Xiaoyang didn\u2019t seem that type. Even when he was wheelchair bound, he still retained his gentleness.Lu Jue gave Ning Zhi another look and, slowly, his voice sounding like it was squeezed out from his throat, said, \u201cNo.\u201dIf Huo Xiaoyang hadn\u2019t bullied him in the past, then why did Lu Jue dislike him and would be upset when he saw him?Ning Zhi wooed him the same way she wooed little Lu Jue, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. We will just avoid him if you don\u2019t like him.\u201dThey weren\u2019t close with each other and there was no need for them to socialize anyway.The two black clouds over his head with lightning disappeared after she had said that.Welp, that was easy.Ning Zhi went to see a doctor and her sprain wasn\u2019t bad. The doctor rubbed some medication on her and she would recover in a week or so.Mother Lu, Father Lu, and Lin Tiantian were all there when they arrived home.\u201cWhat happened? We were told by the bodyguards that you were attacked?\u201d Mother Lu looked worried. Even her hair was a little messed up. She had obviously rushed home from somewhere.Walking up to them quickly, she asked, \u201cAre you two hurt?\u201d\u201cLu Jue is fine. I sprained my ankle.\u201d Half of Ning Zhi\u2019s body was leaning over on Lu Jue. Unlike the milky smell that he had when he was a child, what she picked up now was a clear and fresh smell from him. It was just a hint but pleasant.\u201cHave a seat quickly then.\u201d Mother Lu finally noticed the gauze around Ning Zhi\u2019s ankle. She turned to Father Lu and asked, \u201cWere they able to catch up to the culprits? What was going on?\u201dFather Lu looked solemn. Between his elegant brows was the authoritativeness belonging to somehow who had been in power for years. Nevertheless, when he looked over to his wife, he said to her gently, \u201cYes, we got them and had already taken them to the police station. The other end said that the driver was driving drunk.\u201dNing Zhi frowned deeply. She felt that the car aimed directly at herself and Lu Jue. It did not look like someone driving drunk.\u201cDrunk driving or intentional? We must get down to the bottom of this.\u201d Mother Lu was still worried.\u201cMmm.\u201d Naturally, Father Lu wouldn\u2019t just let this go easily and allowed his family\u2019s lives to be in danger.Lin Tiantian, next to them, said, \u201cXiao Zhi, have you offended someone?\u201dIf Ning Zhi had truly offended someone and endangered Lu Jue, both Mother and Father Lu would be unhappy with her.Ning Zhi studied Lin Tiantian\u2019s look carefully. She was wondering whether Lin Tiantian was the one behind the incident. \u201cI\u2019m an easygoing one and had no conflict with anyone but\u2026\u2026\u201dGiving Lin Tiantian a very meaningful look, she said, \u201cJust because I hadn\u2019t offended anyone doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be thief going after my possessions.\u201dIt was entirely possible that Lin Tiantian was the one behind it. She had, after all, lost 33% of her halo already and Lin Tiantian\u2019s look had changed noticeably. In fact, she had made it onto the most trending list because of her looks.Perhaps Lin Tiantian hired someone to take care of her now that she was out of options.Lin Tiantian felt that the way Ning Zhi was looking at her was odd. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you, then perhaps they were after Lu Jue. With his condition, you shouldn\u2019t take him out all the time.\u201dShe had no idea what had gotten into Ning Zhi. She used to hate Lu Jue and wished they could get a divorce right away. Now she was like a different person. Not only did her attitude toward Lu Jue changed, she even took Lu Jue out all the time.That was a lot of effort if her only purpose was just to appease Mother Lu.\u201cI was the one who asked Xiao Zhi to take Lu Jue to the art exhibition,\u201d said Mother Lu, looking not too happy.Lin Tiantian was surprised. She didn\u2019t think it was Mother Lu\u2019s idea. She quickly explained herself, \u201cI am not blaming Xiao Zhi. It\u2019s just that Lu Jue is just getting better. If incidents like today happen when they go out, I wonder if it would negatively impact him.\u201dMother Lu mellowed out a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - It looked like Lu Jue still has a lot of potential left in him. (2)Ning Zhi raised her brows, \u201cSo, in your opinion, Lu Jue should just stay home all the time?\u201dLooking Ning Zhi\u2019s face that had become prettier and prettier compared to her own that had been slowly retuned to how she once looked, Lin Tiantian was not happy. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I am saying\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what is it that you are saying?\u201d Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved. \u201cAnyone can just place blame.\u201d\u201cAlright. It was my idea to have Xiao Zhi take Xiao Jue out from time to time,\u201d said Mother Lu. \u201cHow\u2019s your foot, Xiao Zhi?\u201d\u201cThe doctor said I will need a week\u2019s rest.\u201dMother Lu said, \u201cOkay. You rest up in the next few days and don\u2019t wander around. I\u2019ll have your meals sent to your room so you don\u2019t need to go up and down the stairs.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi was limping when Lu Jue and her headed up stairs.She had only taken a couple of steps when she felt an excruciating pain.Ning Zhi felt very unlucky as the elevator in the house was broken the last couple of days.She slowly lifted her foot and tried not to put any weight on her injured foot as she scooted forward with difficulty. Suddenly, she felt that she was in the air.The first thing she saw was a prominent Adam's apple then a red collar.\u201cLu Jue?\u201d Ning Zhi\u2019s little heart was beating madly. She looked up in disbelief. Lu Jue was carrying her!Carrying her like a princess, Lu Jue\u2019s posture was a bit odd. He said not a word but carried her up the stairs.Ning Zhi regulated her breath and grabbed Lu Jue\u2019s shoulder with both hands, worrying that he might drop her. \u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t drop me.\u201d She was frightened.Lu Jue looked down at her and said in a deep voice, \u201cDrop you, not possible.\u201dI won\u2019t drop you.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Hold onto me tightly.\u201d Lu Jue was tall so she was quite a bit of distance from the floor. She just might hurt her other foot too if he was to drop her.With his lips shut, Lu Jue didn\u2019t say anything. He tightened his grip on Ning Zhi.From where she was, all Ning Zhi could see was Lu Jue\u2019s very defined chin and some 5 o\u2019clock shadow.She suddenly noticed that Lu Jue was a real man. He not the milky little child or the adolescence boy. His chest was broad and his arms strong. Even his pair of long legs were powerful.His skin was cold and white and he\u2019s handsome. The docileness between his eyes made him looked like a young adolescence boy and she had forgotten that he was a man. He could grow beard.\u201cLu Jue, you are already a man,\u201d lamented Ning Zhi.Lu Jue\u2019s lips tightened even more. Glancing over at her with his black eyes, he said with a hint of resentment. \u201cMan I am.\u201dOf course I am a man.Ning Zhi reached out to touch his 5 o\u2019clock shadow. Lu Jue loves to be clean and neat. His chin was well shaved and it was not rough to the touch.His chin being touched by Ning Zhi\u2019s soft fingers, it tickled. Lu Jue reflexively tightened his chin.Suddenly, Ning Zhi saw a little sun in the indicator above Lu Jue\u2019s head.Ning Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe quickly touched him again with her fingers.Nothing this time.Ning Zhi narrowed his eyes then, she said all of a sudden, \u201cLu Jue, can you lower your head a little. You are too tall. I can\u2019t reach you.\u201dLu Jue carried Ning Zhi to the second floor and, after a little while, finally lowered his head.At the same moment, Ning Zhi lifted her head and approached Lu Jue.She planted her lips on Lu Jue\u2019s chin.They were soft with a hint of a fragrance.Ning Zhi gently touch Lu Jue\u2019s chin with her lips. She felt that Lu Jue\u2019s body shuddered then, immediately, his chin tightened. He reached very strongly to that.The second little sun.The third little sun.The fourth little sun.The fifth little sun\u2026\u2026.Little suns popped up one after another in the indicator then fought their way over to Ning Zhi.With the sea of gold sparkling suns in front of her, Ning Zhi knew that her little storage will be filled up again.The 22ndlittle sun.The 23rdlittle sun.The 24thlittle sun. And that was it.Ning Zhi backed away. Looking at the little suns in her storage, her eyes curved. \u201cSo you like me touching your chin too, huh, Lu Jue?\u201dNing Zhi had already made a mental note: Ears, stomach, chin.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes narrowed happily as she looked at Lu Jue whose tips of his ears were bright red and his chin taut.It would seem that he still had promising potentials.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Lu Jue, in his junior year, had grown even taller than the last time she saw him. (1)Ning Zhi was very pleased with her harvest today.With her new acquired 30 little suns, she could not go and rescue Lu Jue.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Bring me back into our room.\u201d The silly little thing stopped right where they were. Had she shocked him silly?But, judging from all the little suns that had popped out, he obviously quite enjoyed her touching or even kissing him on his chin.Lu Jue\u2019s back remained straight, his body tense, and he carried Ning Zhi toward their room without making a sound.Ning Zhi leaned against Lu Jue\u2019s chest. His chest was board, sturdy, and quite comfortable to lean on. \u201cLu Jue, you can just put me on the couch.\u201dLu Jue stood in front of the couch with Ning Zhi on his arm and he stopped moving.\u201cPut me down already,\u201d urged Ning Zhi.Ning Zhi looked up at him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dSuddenly, Lu Jue lowered his head and thrusted his chin over to her. \u201cMore, kiss.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at Ning Zhi, Lu Jue said slowly, \u201cGive you kiss, more kiss.\u201dLooking into Lu Jue\u2019s dark and clean eyes, Ning Zhi blushed. She suddenly felt that she had taught a good kid bad things.\u201cYou like what I have done to you?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.The straight and dense black eyelashes fluttered and his head remained low. His delicate chin moved even closer to Ning Zhi. He responded in a low voice, \u201cMmhmm.\u201dNing Zhi reached out and touch his chin. There were no little suns.Something occurred to her, she looked up and said to him, \u201cGive me a smile and I will kiss you. Otherwise what I do is pointless.\u201dLu Jue blinked and gave her a blank look.\u201cJust smile.\u201d Ning Zhi\u2019s lips curved upward. \u201cYou like me kissing you on your chin, right? Then give me a smile.\u201dShe leaned into him, her lips always touching his chin and she seduced and wooed him, \u201cHurry.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s perfectly shaped lips curved, somewhat stiffly. A small dimple appeared on the side of his pale cheek.He was handsome and distanced but there was, all of a sudden, an added cleanness and childishness that appeared on him.Ning Zhi felt that something poked at her heart and it was a little ticklish.Ning Zhi moved her lips slowly and gently touched his chin. She saw a little sun appeared in his indicator.She was able to squeeze out more.The warm and fragrance breath hit Lu Jue\u2019s cheek and his little dimple deepened.Ning Zhi touched him again gently and a second little sun appeared.Ning Zhi kissed him a few more times and it finally stopped after 5 little suns.It looked like she had really squeezed him dry this time.Ning Zhi backed off, like a scum who was about to toss him aside now that she was done using him. \u201cOkay, I am done.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s beautiful cherry-blossom eyes were black, bright, and limpid. He looked at Ning Zhi, dazed, and said, \u201cKiss me again.\u201dNing Zhi couldn't help but reached out and pinched him on his cheek. \u201cYou greedy little thing.\u201d She moved her body some. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired carrying me this whole time? Hurry up and put me down.\u201d\u201cNo tired me.\u201d Lu Jue pursed his lips a little and placed Ning Zhi onto the couch.Ning Zhi counted her safe. She now had a total of 35 little suns. They were blinking a sea of gold!Ning Zhi selfishly wanted to exchange them all for her halo. The thought of getting 35% of her halo back was too tempting.But, looking at Lu Jue that was standing in front of her, her heart softened and she decided to go save him instead.She had exchanged for her halo last time so she will go and save him this time. They would take turns.That night, Mother Lu had the kitchen prepared Ning Zhi\u2019s food separately and brought it upstairs for her.Lu Jue sat at his usual spot to have his dinner.Lu Shenyuan took off his suit jacket and had someone hung it up for him. Sitting down in front of Lu Jue, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about what happened today. Is Xiao Jue alright?\u201dMother Lu said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201dLu Shenyuan looked like he felt relieved, \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Lu Jue, in his junior year, had grown even taller than the last time she saw him. (2)\u201cXiao Zhi sprained her ankle though. I had them delivered her dinner upstairs to her.\u201d Mother Lu asked Father Lu, \u201cHave you heard anything back from the police station yet?\u201d\u201cThe person insisted that he was driving drunk. The man that I\u2019ve sent was able to confirmed that he was having lunch with a bunch of friends in the afternoon and did have quite a bit to drink.\u201d The man that Father Lu sent did not find anything suspicious.\u201cXiao Zhi said that the man aimed straight at them while depressing the gas pedal.\u201d Mother Lu frowned, \u201cDid he mistaken the gas pedal as the brake?\u201d\u201cHe drank quite a bit and reeked of alcohol when they took him to the police station. That was a likely scenario.\u201d A dark light crossed Father Lu\u2019s sharp eyes. The more innocent it seemed, the less innocent it was. He would continue to have people follow up on this stealthily.\u201cDrunk driving is the worst.\u201dMother Lu hated those who do not follow the law. They don\u2019t just hurt themselves; they hurt others as well. \u201cLuckily Xiao Zhi reacted quickly this time and pushed Xiao Jue out of the way in time; otherwise\u2026\u2026\u201dShe did not even want to think about what could have happened.Mother Lu exhorted, \u201cLet them know to not let him off lightly. He should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201dLu Shenyuan couldn\u2019t agree with her more. \u201cMom is right. It was entirely luck that little brother is okay this time.\u201dHe turned to Father Lu and suggested, \u201cDad, let me handle this. Even if it is just drunk driving, we should still be careful. I will have someone continue to look into it.\u201dThat was Father Lu\u2019s thoughts as well, \u201cMmm. Okay, you can take it over from this point forward.\u201dLu Shenyuan, \u201cI will get justice for little brother.\u201dAt the same time, Lu Jue put down the chopsticks that were in his hand, grabbed the napkin next to him, and began his daily routine.He wiped cleaned the area on the table in front of him, folded the napkin and tossed it into the trash can before he got up from his seat.\u201cXiao Jue, you are done eating?\u201d asked Mother Lu.Lu Jue headed upstairs without responding to her.Looking at Lu Jue\u2019s emptied bowl, Mother Lu was very surprised, \u201cIt normally takes Xiao Jue almost half an hour to eat dinner. It only took him 10 minutes today?\u201dSuddenly, she busted out laughing when something occurred to her. \u201cXiao Zhi did not eat with us downstairs today. He wanted to finish faster to go and keep her company?\u201dHer son had his fixed spot every day and would also eat at the fixed time. His life was repetitive and routine. If the routine was broken, he would become irritated.But he just broke his routine for Ning Zhi.Lu Shenyuan agreed with his mother. \u201cLooks like the doctor was right. Ning Zhi had a lot of influence on little brother.\u201dMother Lu nodded with a big smile on her face.Sure enough, Ning Zhi was very special to Lu Jue.Inside the bedroom, Ning Zhi sat in front of the desk enjoying her dinner that was brought up to her. She must say that the chefs at the Lu family were amazing. They made her eat a few extra bites every day.The door to the bedroom opened up.She saw Lu Jue, in his red workout clothes, walked inside.Lu Jue was tall and worked out every morning. Even though his pants, Ning Zhi could tell how powerful his two long legs were.\u201cWeren\u2019t you eating dinner downstairs?\u201d He would not have normally finished so soon.He walked over to Ning Zhi and sat down.\u201cYou are done eating already?\u201d asked Ning Zhi.There were no emotions on Lu Jue\u2019s clear and handsome face. \u201cMmm,\u201d he grumbled.Ning Zhi wouldn\u2019t think much if anyone else had finished their meals faster than normal but Lu Jue was not \u201canyone else\u201d. His routines were fixed.She leaned over to him and asked tentatively, \u201cDid you come upstairs to keep me company?\u201dLu Jue lowered his eyes and his eyelids fluttered. He finally grunted again after a little while.She was right!Oh mi! How was this man so docile? She thought she would die!Ning Zhi felt that she would be an awful villain if she teased him again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Lu Jue, in his junior year, had grown even taller than the last time she saw him. (3)She switched to a different pair of chopsticks, picked up a piece of fish filet with the bones removed and placed it in front of Lu Jue\u2019s lips. \u201cHere\u2019s a little prize for you. Open your mouth.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s lips remained tightly shut.\u201cYou don\u2019t want it?\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201dNing Zhi was about to pull her hand back and keep on eating when, the very next second, Lu Jue\u2019s head reached over, his lips parted, and he ate the piece of fish filet on Ning Zhi\u2019s chopsticks.Lu Jue chewed slowly but, as he was very good looking, he look very elegant when he chewed slowly.The moment that he took the piece of fish felt from her, Ning Zhi saw a little stun popped out over his head.Ning Zhi was pleasantly surprised.\u201cWhat else would you like to eat? I\u2019ll feed it to you.\u201dNing Zhi started kissing up to him. She picked up a piece of delectable meat before Lu Jue said anything and brought it up to him.A second little sun!Ning Zhi fed him a few more times and the little suns finally stopped coming after 5 of them.It was a bit on the light side compared to the 35 little suns that she received from kissing his chin but Ning Zhi was happy nonetheless. Tis was a rich day for her. She now had 40 little suns in her little safe!That night.After she had showered, changed into the set of clothes that she had prepared in advanced, and put her shoes on, she summoned Overlord.She turned 30 little suns in over to it and her brimming little safe was down to 10 little suns all of a sudden.So costly.Ning Zhi had, once again, transmigrated when she opened up her eyes.She saw many students walking past her in their blue-and-white junior high school uniform. So she had transmigrated to Lu Jue\u2019s junior high school period once again?It\u2019d seem that Lu Jue would be somewhere nearby.This was Ning Zhi\u2019s first time coming to Lu Jue\u2019s junior high school and she was not familiar with the surrounding nor did she know where to go to look for Lu Jue.She regretted a little without asking Mother Lu ahead of time which classes Lu Jue was in in junior and senior high schools. She would otherwise be able to go and look for him there.Ning Zhi started looking around.The setting sun casting its light on the little trail gave it a forlorn feel. She noticed that this school was quite sizeable. Two boys walked past her. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go play basketball. Brother Shang\u2019s not here today. What is the point?\u201dThe other boy holding a basketball in his hands asked, \u201cWhere did Brother Shang go?\u201d\u201cBrother Sheng and Lin Fan took the fool over to the botanical garden.\u201dThe boy with the basketball giggled. \u201cWhat are they going to do with him? Brother Shang isn\u2019t going to beat the fool up, is he?\u201dThe boy next to him said, \u201cBrother Shang was very angry today. The Beauty Queen had some conflicts with him and the fool happened to walk by so she made some comments toward Brother Shang.\u201dThe boy snickered. \u201cBeauty Queen said she likes the fool and Brother Shang was jealous. He was too prideful to apologize though, so he decided to go and teach the fool a lesson to show the Beauty Queen.\u201d\u201cIf the Beauty Queen has half a brain, she would know who to choose between Brother Shang and the fool.\u201dNing Zhi had a bad feeling. The fool that the two were talking about could very well be Lu Jue.She quickly followed behind them.Walking around the school building, Ning Zhi followed the two to the botanical garden behind the library.She immediately saw two boys and a girl standing there. One of the boys had his hair dyed a light brown color and had earrings on. He looked both handsome and arrogant.The one standing in front of them was definitely Lu Jue.Ning Zhi immediately walked over to him.The boy, Song Jingshang, asked the Beauty Queen next to him, \u201cYou sure you like a loser like him?\u201dThe Beauty Queen bit down on her lips. She looked from Song Jingshang with her limpid eyes but didn\u2019t say a word.Song Jingshang\u2019s buddy ripped Lu Jue\u2019s backpack from him, tossed it on the ground, and stomped on it.He laughed complacently. \u201cLook, Beauty Queen, he doesn\u2019t even know to fight back when he is bullied. He\u2019s a fool and he can\u2019t comprehend what we are talking about. How can you compare this fool to Brother Shang.\u201dThe Beauty Queen did not look at Lu Jue. She only blurted stuff out earlier because she was mad.She only liked Song Jingshang. He\u2019s the Heartthrob at school. Not only was he handsome and carefree, he was also very rebellious. Many girls at school would throw themselves at him in a heartbeat.She only said what she said earlier to spite him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Lu Jue, in his junior year, had grown even taller than the last time she saw him. (4)The beauty queen said to Song Jingshang, \u201cLet\u2019s make up. I only like you.\u201dNing Zhi could more or less piece together what happened from their dialog.She was enraged. What the heck? These two dared to use Lu Jue\u2019s as the stepping stone for their relationship!Holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand, she said, \u201cXiao Juejue, I\u2019m here.\u201dHere to help him beat up the bad guys!A soft little hand held onto his and Lu Jue finally looked up after a long while.Compared to two years ago, Lu Jue, in junior high school had grown quite a bit. Last time he was just a bit taller than Ning Zhi. This time he was half a head\u2019s distance taller than Ning Zhi.Lu Jue\u2019s features became more three dimensional. Youthful, clear and cold, he was obviously much handsomer than this so-called school bully.Lu Jue looked down at the hand that was holding onto his. He didn\u2019t struggle free from it nor did he say anything.Ning Zhi feel that he recognized her this time.\u201cLu Jue, they are bullying you,\u201d said Ning Zhi, mad.Even though as far as an autistic person go, they don\u2019t see or hear other people. Sometimes they don\u2019t even react to loud firecracker sounds. They only listen to what they find interesting.But that did not mean he should be bullied.Those standing in front of them right now obviously felt that Lu Jue was very bulliable because he would never talk or fight back.\u201cCongratulation, Brother Shang. The Beauty Queen is getting back with you again,\u201d teased one of the boys.Song Jingshang raised his brows, \u201cWill you tease me with someone else again in the future?\u201d His voice was filled with arrogance and contempt. \u201cDo not compare me with a fool again.\u201d\u201cThen you cannot accept letters from other girls either. Otherwise, I really will get with Lu Jue next time,\u201d said the Beauty Queen in a shy and coquettish voice.Ning Zhi was very speechless when she heard that. The Beauty Queen was using Lu Jue as a backup?She was so angry that she walked in front of the Beauty Queen and said, \u201cOh, so you think Lu Jue will just be with you if you say so? Where did that confidence come from?\u201dThe so-called Beauty Queen was fair looking but she was nowhere close to Ning Zhi\u2019s beauty.Ning Zhi continued, \u201cCan you please not drag other innocent people in to further your own relationship?\u201d Lu Jue didn\u2019t owe them anything.Naturally, the Beauty Queen couldn\u2019t hear Ning Zhi.Song Jingshang\u2019s buddy teased, \u201cOh, Beauty Queen, c\u2019mon. Even if you want to get a rise out of Brother Shang, you should look for someone better. What about this fool measures up to Brother Shang?\u201d\u201cExactly, I figured the fool is stupider now than before after our threat.\u201dNing Zhi only wished she could appear instantly and scared this group of brainless kids $hitless. Lu Jue was every bit as fine as them.Ning Zhi quickly walked back over to Lu Jue and whispered into his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to them. You are the handsomest, calm, highly intelligent and rich. They are only jealous of you because you are so nice.\u201dAs far as Ning Zhi was concerned, if not for the autism, these people didn\u2019t remotely measure up to him.Under the sun, Lu Jue\u2019s eyelashes fluttered. He looked up at Ning Zhi and quickly looked away.Suddenly, a tall and skinny boy walked over. Ning Zhi recognized him right away. It was Lu Shenyuan.He was here looking for Lu Jue?Ning Zhi let out a sigh of relief. Now that Lu Shenyuan was here, at least these people would not dare to bully Lu Jue anymore.The others, too, saw Lu Shenyuan. They all knew that Lu Jue was Lu Shenyuan\u2019s younger brother.The Lu family was untouchable to people like them. As such, they would only bully Lu Jue secretly and never in the open. Besides, they had never touched Lu Jue.Because they didn\u2019t dare.Any injuries on Lu Jue, the Lu family would make them disappear before the next sunrise.All they had ever did in the past was talk. As far as they were concerned, bullying Lu Jue felt like they were able to walk over the Lu family and that gave them a satisfying feeling.Lu Shenyuan, on the other hand, was not like Lu Jue. He was no fool and he might take actions now that he discovered that they had been bullying Lu Jue.Everybody there was nervous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Strange Big Sister belongs to me. (1)It quieted down around them and, the next second, Lu Shenyuan walked straight past all of them leisurely as though he had seen nothing.\u201cWhat did he mean by that, Brother Shang?\u201d The boy was baffled. \u201cDo you think he is going to get others?\u201dSong Jingshang snickered and said in a meaningful way, \u201cWhat you so nervous about? We\u2019ve done nothing.\u201dNing Zhi, watching as Lu Shenyuan departed, gritted her teeth.She should have known, Lu Shenyuan had been targeting Lu Jue since he was a child. Of course he would not lift a finger now that he saw Lu Jue being bullied.The other boys understood what Song Jingshang meant and felt an instant relief.The Beauty Queen said, \u201cJingshang, let\u2019s go. I am getting hungry.\u201d She was tired from standing and didn\u2019t want to stay there any longer.She didn\u2019t really like Lu Jue. She was merely using him to spite her boyfriend. Now that she was back together with Song Jingshang, she no longer wished to waste any more time on the fool.\u201cBrother Shang, the beauty queen said she is hungry. You should feed her as her boyfriend.\u201d The boys started to tease.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go. Dinner\u2019s on me,\u201d said Song Jingshang as he lifted his brows.From Ning Zhi\u2019s perspective, this group was stupid and bad.Song Jingshang left with his group.Ning Zhi only had 10 little suns left. She spent one of them and picked up Lu Jue\u2019s red backpack from the ground.Ning Zhi patted away the footprints on it and placed it back into Lu Jue\u2019s hand. She picked up his other hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201dThe Lu family\u2019s chauffeur was waiting at the front door. Ning Zhi saw Lu Shenyuan sitting inside the car.She gave him a few intense stares.Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t an impulsive one. Even though she had noticed the abnormalities about Lu Shenyuan, she would not rashly run and told that to Mother for Father Lu.She knew full well that Lu Shenyuan had put up a great front. He had always acted as the perfect son in front of Father and Mother Lu.There was no way that Mother Lu and the others would believe in what she was telling them had she told them about Lu Shenyuan now.She had only been married into the Lu family for six months and had a rap sheet. Lu Shenyuan, on the other hand, had been a filial son and good brother for over 20 years.Most important, she had no concrete proof at all that could support that Lu Shenyuan wasn\u2019t the good brother that he pretended to be.Lu Shenyuan looked calm as usual when he saw Lu Jue getting inside the car. He said to the chauffeur, \u201cXiao Jue is here. Uncle Chen, we can head out now.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dBack at the Lu\u2019s place.Ning Zhi saw Mother Lu in the living room. She was smiling and she walked up to take the backpack from Lu Jue but Lu Jue avoided her.He went upstairs with his backpack without saying a word.Lu Shenyuan said caringly, \u201cMom, I\u2019m back. There\u2019s quite a bit of homework today.\u201dMother Lu smiled and said, \u201cOh okay. Go start on them then. I\u2019ll go get you when dinner is ready.\u201dSmiling, Lu Shenyuan said, \u201cOkay. Thanks, Mom.\u201dOne of them quiet and cold and the other mature and docile, and knew how to appease others.The contrast between Lu Jue and Lu Shenyuan were stark.Ning Zhi couldn't help but gave Lu Shenyuan a few more stares. He did that on purpose. He played the role of the perfect son to contrast how bad Lu Jue was.Lu Jue had already gone upstairs.Ning Zhi, not wanting to look at Lu Shenyuan\u2019s face, went upstairs as well.She opened up Lu Jue\u2019s room door with familiarity.She noticed that all of the curtains in the room had been drawn shut and it was dark inside the room.She walked inside and closed the door. It became even darker.She shuffled forward to get closer to Lu Jue.For autistic individuals, they can stay inside a dark room with no trouble navigating through it and finding what they need.Ning Zhi could make out a tall, dark silhouette in front of the desk.She walked over.\u201cLu Jue.\u201d Ning Zhi sat down next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark in here. I can barely see you.\u201dShe could only make out his shape.In the dark, Lu Jue sudden reached his hand out and placed it on Ning Zhi\u2019s face.Ning Zhi was taken aback.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Strange Big Sister belongs to me. (2)She could feel Lu Jue\u2019s very defined fingers stroking her, tracing her outline and her features.Ning Zhi recalled she had red on the web that autistic individuals learn to identify people through touching and studying one\u2019s face.Lu Jue\u2019s fingers were slightly cold and where he touched Ning Zhi on her face, a hint of coldness lingered.Ning Zhi closed her eyes and let him stroke her. \u201cLu Jue, do you still remember me?\u201dHe was grown now. He should remember her.Lu Jue didn\u2019t say anything. The tips of his fingers scrolled gently through her face like he was trying to recognize her.After a long while, Ning Zhi heard Lu Jue\u2019s low and dull voice, \u201cStrange big sister.\u201dNing Zhi\u2019s lips curved. He did remember her.But she still needed to correct him, \u201cNot strange big sister. Angelic big sister. I am pretty and angelic big sister.\u201dLu Jue\u2019s voice was deep. He repeated, \u201cStrange big sister.\u201dNing Zhi sighed and gave up. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201dLu Jue suddenly stood up in the dark. Ning Zhi seemed to see him walking over to where the closet was.It sounded like he was rummaging through it.After a long while, Ning Zhi could make out that he was returning.Lu Jue reached his hand out and held onto hers.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t see clearly but she felt someone chilly and soft being wrapped around her wrists.She was curious. \u201cLu Jue, what are you doing?\u201dLu Jue\u2019s head was lowered and he was very focused on what he was doing. He said slowly, \u201cTie you.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe next second, she felt her wrists being wrapped by something soft and silky and it tightened.Ning Zhi recalled how Lu Jue had tied her foot to his with the colorful ribbon last time to keep her there.She wanted to laugh but there was a dull feeling in her chest. It didn\u2019t matter how he tried to tie her down, she would disappear still.The curtains were pulled open and lights returned to the room.When the room lit up, Ning Zhi could see that her wrist was tied to Lu Jue\u2019s. It was still that familiar colorful ribbon.Lu Jue blinked his pretty eyes and there was happiness in the bottom of his dark black eyes.There was even a hint of shyness between his youthful brows. \u201cStrange big sister, mine.\u201dStrange big sister belongs to me.***Lu Jue, in front of her, was like an ignorant little puppy who wanted to claim ownership to something that he liked and waited for a long time.Lu Jue lifted his hand that was tied to Ning Zhi and showed it to her.Ning Zhi was taken aback a little then she busted out laughing. Lu Jue had no idea what fondness was; he merely wanted her to stay with him because he was used to her being there.She smiled in an indulging way, \u201cMmhmm. Yours.\u201dShe tugged at the ribbon with her other hand. It wasn\u2019t overly tight but one wouldn\u2019t be able to struggle free easily either.She had spent a little sun when she wanted to pick up Lu Jue\u2019s backpack at school in exchange for the ability to touch physical items for a minute.That was the reason she was able to open the door and be tied up by Lu Jue.Overlord had mentioned that the time was accrued, totally up to one minute. Meaning that the ribbon would no longer be able to hold her in half a minute\u2019s time.Ning Zhi was curious how Lu Jue would react then.Sure enough. The ribbon that was tied around Lu Jue and Ning Zhi\u2019s hand went through Ning Zhi\u2019s hand and hung loosely on Lu Jue\u2019s not too long after.Lu Jue\u2019s dark black eyes were perplexed. He undid the ribbon and clumsily tried to tie Ning Zhi to him again.Nevertheless, the ribbon kept going through Ning Zhi\u2019s hand after he had tried that a few times.Lu Jue looked up at her as though he was asking her why.Ning Zhi had no idea how to explain that to him. She pondered over it a bit before she said to him, \u201cXiao Juejue, you are the only one who could touch and see me. Didn\u2019t you say that I am yours? Nobody else can see me and nothing else could touch me.\u201dAfter a long while, Lu Jue lowered his head and his voice sounded like it was forced out from his throat, \u201cWant tie.\u201dNing Zhi had no choice but to say to him, \u201cI am still yours even if you can\u2019t tie me up.\u201dLu Jue looked up and looked at Ning Zhi quietly. Then, his thin lips curved a little and his light little dimples shown. \u201cMine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Lu Jue blinked and looked at the two person kissing on the screen (1)Ning Zhi must say that the young Lu Jue was very easy to placate.That night, Ning Zhi went downstairs when Lu Jue was showering.Mother Lu hadn\u2019t retired to her room yet and was saying something to the butler. Ning Zhi walked over to her.\u201cHave the kitchen have Xiao Jue\u2019s birthday cake ready ahead of time for day after tomorrow. Make sure they make all the dishes that he likes. Have someone put up pretty colorful lights around the living room. And also colorful decorations.\u201d Mother Lu was very thorough in her instructions, not wanting to miss any details.Standing next to her, Ning Zhi was a bit surprised. Lu Jue\u2019s birthday was day after tomorrow?The butler responded, \u201cYes, Madam. I will make sure they are all taken care of.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Mother Lu had a lot of faith in the butler\u2019s ability.With the Lu\u2019s wealth and that Lu Jue was the young master of the Lu, his birthday should be a big celebration. Unfortunately, he was not a fan of crowded places.His birthdays had always been celebrated at the Lu\u2019s place ever since he was a child and they never invited anyone else to attend.As such, all Mother Lu could do was to focus on the decorations.Ning Zhi returned to her room. Her one minute of time to be able to touch physical objects was up so she had to walk through the door.She had just gone inside when she saw Lu Jue standing in the middle of the room in his red pajama, his hair wet and water was dripping down from it.His black eyes were limpid and dazed. Seeing Ning Zhi appearing suddenly, he walked over to her with his long legs and grabbed her by her slender wrist. \u201cWhere go you?\u201d\u201cI just went downstairs. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Ning Zhi could feel his nervousness with her hand held by him tightly.Lu Jue kept his mouth shut. The water continued to drip down his short hair and his collar was soaked.\u201cI am not leaving yet.\u201d Ning Zhi comforted him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will let you know before I disappear. I will not leave without saying goodbye.\u201dLu Jue lowered his eyes and didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cGo dry your hair quickly. Your clothes are getting wet.\u201dNing Zhi rushed him. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll be here watching you.\u201dLu Jue finally let go of her reluctantly.The night thickened.The light in the bedroom was off and it was dark around them.Ning Zhi, lying on the couch, was thinking about what to do to that Song Jingshang, the person who led the bullying of Lu Jue, tomorrow.She was deep in thought and did not notice the small rustling noises coming from the bed.In the dark, a slender and warm body got close to her all of a sudden.Ning Zhi was startled and dazed.The body took over most of the small and narrow couch and Ning Zhi could only scoot toward the inner part of the couch. She let out a soft cry, \u201cLu Jue?\u201dLu Jue\u2019s body was up against hers and his low and dull voice particularly clear in the dark. \u201cSleep with you. Sleep with you.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNing Zhi spent another little sun to turn on the desk lamp sitting on the end table.Under the dim yellow light, Lu Jue, in his red outfit, was carrying his red pillow in his arm. His body rotating half way, he tried to lie down next to Ning Zhi.His hair was a bit messy and they made his youth and handsome face looked dazed and cute.Lu Shao squinted his eyes when the light was turned on. He looked quietly at Ning Zhi with his dark, black eyes and the meaning in them were obvious. He wanted to sleep with her.Ning Zhi suddenly recalled that Lu Jue was so upset that she slept on his bed the night that she had transmigrated over that a black cloud with lightning appeared over his head.And now, the young Lu Jue was trying to climb into her bed?\u201cI don\u2019t need you to sleep with me.\u201d Where did he learn that from? \u201cHurry up and return to your own bed.\u201dLittle Lu Jue had learned to be a bad boy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Lu Jue blinked and looked at the two person kissing on the screen (2)Lu Jue lowered his head and said nothing.He docilely got off the couch but he did not return to his bed. Instead, he stood up straight in front of the couch, as though he was instructed to, with his red pillow in his hands, guarding her.He looked as pitiful as a person could look.Ning Zhi suddenly had a false impression that she had bullied him.\u201cGo back to sleep on your bed.\u201d Ning Zhi repeated herself.Lu Shao continued to stand there, dazed and motionless with his pillow in his arms.Looking at the pitiful big boy, Ning Zhi\u2019s jaws tightened and finally said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll sleep in bed with you.\u201d She sure as heck did not want to squeeze into the couch with him.Lu Jue looked up. He blinked his black and bright eyes before walking toward his bed, still holding his pillow.He laid down on bed and turned to his side. Looking at Ning Zhi quietly, his cherry-blossom eyes blinked repeatedly rushing her to join him.Ning Zhi walked over and laid down next to him. She pulled the blanket over his head and said to him meanly, \u201cSleep.\u201dLu Jue crawled up from under the blanket and scooted closer to Ning Zhi.He called her softly from behind her, \u201cStrange big sister.\u201dHis voice was deep, magnetic, and hoarse.Ning Zhi could feel her ear tingling.How would she be able to sleep now?The next day, Ning Zhi went to school with Lu Jue again. Unlike in grade school, Lu Jue needed to wear uniform now.He looked even more youthful and handsome in his black and white uniform.Lu Jue put on his uniform with resentment in his eyes. Once he got it on roughly, he didn\u2019t even bother straightening it out.Ning Zhi walked over and straightened out his shirt some. \u201cXiao Juejue looks so handsome in his uniform.\u201dShe could seamlessly consume her little suns in order to come into contact with real physical items now. She hasn\u2019t used up all of the little sun that she had exchanged for a minute when she was turning off the desk lamp last night yet.Lu Jue tightened his lips some and said slowly, \u201cRed is the handsome.\u201dI only look handsome in red.Ning Zhi wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry.Inside the classroom.Because of Mother Lu\u2019s special request, Lu Jue received special treatment and the spot next to him was always empty.He sat alone.Ning Zhi sat down next to him. She had just sat down when a girl walked over to them.\u201cMorning, Lu Jue. I brought breakfast. Would you like some? Our new chef prepared them and they are very tasty.\u201d The girl had a delicate-looking lunch box in her hand and she was very cute.Ning Zhi could tell immediately that she was Huo Xiaoyue in junior high school.She recalled that Huo Xiaoyue had mentioned that she was in the same class as Lu Jue in grade school, junior high school, and senior high school.Lu Jue kept his head lowered. He pulled out his textbooks from inside of his red backpack and stack them one on top of the other, all of them formed a stack sitting neatly on the upper left-hand corner of his desk.He never paid Huo Xiaoyue any attention.\u201cLu Jue, can\u2019t you at least acknowledge what I had said to you?\u201d Huo Xiaoyue did not give up easily. She had no heart to get angry at him when she looked at that beautiful face of his.Lu Jue divided his pens and notebooks into two sets; one of them was for Ning Zhi.Huo Xiaoyue pursed her lips like she was wronged. \u201cFine, so you don\u2019t want any. I am not going to bring you any next time.\u201dSuddenly, a girl came over and said to Huo Xiaoyue excitedly, \u201cXiaoyue, your brother\u2019s here looking for you.\u201dHuo Xiaoyue looked over by the door and it was, indeed, her brother. She handed the lunch box over to the girl casually and said, \u201cHere, you can have it.\u201d She hurried over to the door after she said that.\u201cHuo Xiaoyue\u2019s brother is too handsome.\u201d\u201cYeah, he is even handsomer than the school heartthrob Song Jingshang.\u201d\u201cI agree. I much prefer boys who are decorous and handsome like Senior Huo.\u201d\u201cI heard that Senior Huo will be applying for the academically-focused class at No. 1 Senior High School. He is both handsome and smart. I need to take a page from his book and also shoot for the academically-focused class at No. 1 Senior High School.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Lu Jue blinked and looked at the two person kissing on the screen (3)Ning Zhi looked over in the direction that the girls were looking at after she heard their excited discussion.Standing by the door was Huo Xiaoyang in his senior high school uniform, looking decorous and handsome where he was.His legs were fine.Ning Zhi was a bit surprised. That meant he had some sort of an accident later on that put him in a wheelchair?What a bummer to have someone as outstanding as him to be wheelchair bound?Ning Zhi was dazed when, suddenly, she felt a warm breath falling on her ear.Turning, Ning Zhi saw a young man with light skin and his clear and handsome face expanding in front of her eyes.Ning Zhi blinked, as did Lu Jue.Lu Jue\u2019s lips pursed slightly as though he was unhappy. \u201cDon\u2019t look him.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning Zhi didn\u2019t figure out immediately what Lu Jue was trying to say.Lu Jue reached out his hand and pointed at his own face. \u201cLook me.\u201dDon\u2019t look at him. Look at me.That person was not as good looking as him.Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved. She reached out and pinched him on his cheek. His cheek felt good between her fingers. \u201cOkay. I look you.\u201dNing Zhi saw that Song Jinshang entering the classroom before the class started. The beauty queen was with him. The two of the sit in tandem of each other.During class, the two of them exchanged notes at least five times.They were already in junior year of junior high school and their grades were nothing to show for. They should be focusing on their school work, not their romance.Now, looking back to her own Xiao Juejue. He was definitely the valedictorian type.Ning Zhi looked back over and met the eyes of the silly little thing.Ning Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe put her hands on both side of his cheeks and turned his head toward the blackboard. \u201cWhat you looking at me for? Xiao Juejue, you need to focus in class.\u201dXiao Jue pursed his lips and didn\u2019t say anything.Ning Zhi had a headache after sitting through all the classes with Lu Jue. It was as though she had returned to her own junior high school years.The final session was self-study and there was no teacher there to monitor them. Ning Zhi saw Song Jinshang walked out of the classroom and the beauty queen was about to follow him about shortly.Ning Zhi perked up instantly. \u201cYou stay and study. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dShe stood up.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d Ning Zhi noticed that Lu Jue was following behind her after she had taken a few steps. \u201cI need to go and take care of something. I will be back shortly.\u201dLu Jue didn\u2019t say anything. His hand was holding onto the hem of Ning Zhi\u2019s dress. His intention was obvious.Ning Zhi had no choice but to take him with her as she walked out of the classroom hastily.She saw a shadow who quickly around the corner of the staircase. Ning Zhi hurried up with Lu Jue in tow.Then, Ning Zhi saw the beauty queen walking up the stairs.\u201cDon\u2019t make a sound. We will follow them up.\u201d Ning Zhi told Lu Jue.Song Jinshang and the beauty queen went to the rooftop of the school building.Ning Zhi was glad that she did not materialize. She wasn\u2019t tired at all after climbing five flights of stairs. Lu Jue, by her side, was also breathing normally.Ning Zhi, pulling Lu Jue with her, and hid around the corner. Song Jinshang and the beauty queen couldn\u2019t see her and she wasn\u2019t worried but she had Lu Jue with her. So she had to be more careful.\u201cDid you bring your phone with you?\u201d Ning Zhi asked Lu Jue.Lu Jue pulled up his black phone from the pocket of his pants and placed it on Ning Zhi\u2019s palm.Ning Zhi spent another little sun. She turned on the camera on the hone and pointed the camera at the two.From the screen, Ning Zhi could see Song Jinshang and the beauty queen hugging each other.The very next second, the beauty queen looked up, looking shy.Ning Zhi saw Song Jinshang wrapped one arm around the beauty queen and, lifting her head up by her chin with his other hand, leaned down and kissed her.Caught off guard, she suddenly recalled Lu Jue next to her.She turned her head quickly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201dLu Jue blinked. He looked blankly at the two kissing on the screen with his black eyes.Ning Zhi quickly reached her hand out and covered up his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t look, Xiao Juejue.\u201dAnd don\u2019t learn that either!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - The strange big sister had lied to him. She still disappeared even after he had made his wish. (1)Ning Zhi had expected that Song Jinshang and the beauty queen would just start to kiss before exchanging a word. In fact, the two seemed very passionate and excited through the lens.Ning Zhi must admit that they were bold.It was pitch black in front of Lu Jue\u2019s eyes and he couldn\u2019t see anything. The only sensation that he had was the familiar fragrance in his nose.Ning Zhi whispered into his ear, \u201cStop blinking. You are making my palm itch.\u201dThe long and straight lashes fanned her palm slightly.Lu Jue blinked a few more times and Ning Zhi\u2019s palm itched even more.That little brat. He did that on purpose!The two on the screen were very into their smooching. Ning Zhi had already taken their pictures and did not plan on staying any longer.She said to Lu Jue in a low voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dShe worried that these two would negatively affect Lu Jue, her little simple, if they stayed any longer.She didn\u2019t want a good kid to turn bad.Ning Zhi saved the photos and videos that she had taken before she slowly pulled her hand away from Lu Jue and wanted take off with him.Lu Jue opened up his eyes again when it brightened up in front of him. Ning Zhi walked toward the stairs holding Lu Jue\u2019s hand.Lu Jue turned around and saw the boy had the girl against a wall. His hands were moving up and down her body and their lips were glued together. They looked both like they were enjoying it and not so much enjoying it.Lu Jue blinked and turned back around.After they had returned to the Lu\u2019s, Ning Zhi spent another three little suns in exchange for three minutes\u2019 time. She only had 4 out of her original 10 little suns remaining.Sitting in front of the computer, she uploaded the video to the school\u2019s comment box.She didn\u2019t have any evidences of Song Jinshang and the others bullying Lu Jue. They had wisely avoided the surveillance camera the other day when they brought Lu Jue behind the library.As such, she would have to go about it differently.It was only a few more weeks to mid-term examinations. All she needed was for Song Jinshang and the others to not have time to bother Lu Jue.Tomorrow was Saturday. Ning Zhi figured that she should be able to see some result by Monday. Lu Jue\u2019s birthday was tomorrow so she would be able to spend his birthday with him before this issue was resolved.The Lu\u2019s living room was adorned with many colorful decorations, ribbons and balloons to celebrate Lu Jue\u2019s birthday.They were the colors that Lu Jue liked.Ning Zhi couldn't help but laughed when she saw them. She had an illusion that this was the birthday party for a child.Then, turning and seeing the young man next to her, he was indeed still quite young.Mother Lu spent a lot of time in dressing up today for her son\u2019s birthday. \u201cIs the cake ready? We can put it out first.\u201dShe said to the butler. \u201cBe sure to have someone lower the curtains and turn the lights off when we sing the birthday song. That will give better ambience.\u201dThe butler acknowledged everything that he was told.Ning Zhi saw that Mother Lu, Father Lu, and even Lu Shenyuan had presents prepared for Lu Jue. She was a bit upset that she didn\u2019t have a penny on her and couldn\u2019t get Lu Jue a birthday gift.She told Lu Jue, \u201cI will get you birthday gift when you grow up.\u201dShe would make it up to him on his next birthday after she had returned.Lu Jue, sitting in front of the desk and reading quietly, grunted in response to Ning Zhi as she said there. There was a little bit of light in his eyes.The strange big sister said that she would give him birthday present after he grew up.He would still be with the strange big sister after he grew up.On the school\u2019s side, there was workers on duty even over the weekend.The administrator opened up the email attachment, saw the content, and quickly informed the school leader worriedly.Ning Zhi had no idea that her email had already alarmed the school before Monday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - The strange big sister had lied to him. She still disappeared even after he had made his wish. (2)The principal of the school located Song Jinshang and the beauty queen and had contacted their parents to meet him at their school.The school\u2019s stance was to deal with the incident severely and Song Jinshang and the beauty queen\u2019s parents started placing blames on each other.\u201cOur Xiao Ting had always been a good girl. She would never have done such a thing if she wasn\u2019t led down the wrong path by someone else.\u201d The mother of the beauty queen quickly spoke up for her daughter.Song Jinshang\u2019s mother had on a very presentable dress suit and looked very powerful. \u201cIf your daughter is as good as you say she is, she would not have seduced my son.\u201dThe beauty queen\u2019s mother looked very unhappy and quickly rebuked. \u201cYou are a parent. Watch what you are saying.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? If she could do it, then I can talk about it. She was such a \u2026. At such a young age\u2026\u2026\u201dThe fighting escalated.Next to them, Song Jinshang looked like he had already given up struggling and just stood there quietly.The beauty queen, across from him, sobbed softly. One could see the shock, fear, and shame from their deeds being discovered shown on her face.She could already imagine how her relationship with Song Jinshang would not be blessed by the others and that they would be pulled apart by the school and their parents.The principal of the school quickly stopped the two sets of parents before they started fighting with each other. \u201cPlease calm down, both of you. I notified you to come here today so we can discuss on how to resolve the issue, not to place blames. Both students were at fault here and according to school policies\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two sets of parents quickly began pleading after they heard the principal\u2019s words.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to attend school anymore anyway. It is all my fault and it had nothing to do with Xiao Ting. I don\u2019t care if I am expelled.\u201d Song Jinshang wasn\u2019t bothered by it. He looked untamable.Mother Song quickly scolded her son. \u201cYou shut up!\u201dThe beauty queen looked at Song Jinshang, touched by his action. \u201cI\u2019ll go too if you go.\u201dThe beauty queen\u2019s mother smacked her upside her head. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201dNing Zhi would probably roll her eyes if she was there.These two were not just fools but also romance brained. Two people should be together so they can better themselves together, not to lower their intelligence together.Besides, they were still so young. What was wrong with going to school?After a long discussion and considering that mid-term examinations were almost there, the school decided against expelling the two students but recorded demerits on both of their records. In addition, Song Jinshang would be transferred to a different class.Of course, the two would also be criticized publicly by the school.The outcome was more or less what Ning Zhi had expected. Her intention was so that they two would not have the spare time to pick on Lu Jue or to use him as a stepping stone for their relationship.What she hadn\u2019t expected was the efficiency of the school.The ambience at the Lu family was amazing right now.The butler invited Lu Jue downstairs after the setup was ready.Ning Zhi followed behind them.There was already a three-tiered cake in the middle of the dining room. There was a colorful and eye-catching rainbow on the cake that looked like it was made out of jams of different colors.Along the edge of the cake were little flowered made out of cream of different colors.Yup, this was a very colorful birthday cake.Ning Zhi was quite impressed that the chef was able to make such a childish, colorful, and cute cake.Ning Zhi could tell that Lu Jue was happy with the cake and the colorful ribbons and red balloons.Mother and Father Lu stood to one side. There were looking at Lu Jue with smiles in their eyes.Mother Lu lit the candles on the cake and had Lu Jue made a wish.The butler quickly had someone drawn the curtains and turned the lights off. The room dimmed.Lu Jue\u2019s attention was drawn by the warm and yellow glow from the candles on the birthday cake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - The strange big sister had lied to him. She still disappeared even after he had made his wish. (3)Hearing Mother Lu urging Lu Jue to blow out the candles, Ning Zhi leaned into Lu Jue\u2019s ear and taught him, \u201cXiao Juejue, close your eyes, make a wish, then blow out the candles.\u201dNing Zhi wooed him. \u201cThat way your birthday wish will come true.\u201dLu Jue blinked.He closed his eyes under everyone\u2019s gaze.Mother and Father Lu and even Lu Shenyuan and the butler standing nearby all heard Lu Shao making his birthday wish for a change.Lu Jue\u2019s voice was low and dull. He said slowly, \u201cNot disappear, Strange Big Sister.\u201d\u201cWhat strange big sister?\u201d Mother Lu was surprised that her son had made a wish but she had no idea what he was talking about.Lu Shenyuan had long since gotten used to his brother\u2019s gibberish. He smiled and said, \u201cHappy birthday, little brother.\u201dLu Jue didn\u2019t say anything but faced the candles and closed his eyes.Lu Jue\u2019s youthful brows and eyes were traced by the dim light of the candles. His long and straight eyelashes fluttered and he looked very serious.The others didn\u2019t understand what Lu Jue was talking about but Ning Zhi, standing next to him, did. Her heart had, once again, ached with a dull pain.His birthday wish was for her to not leave.Lu Jue blew out all of the candles seriously after he made his wish.He wanted his wish to come true.Mother and Father Lu smiled and clapped their hands. The others around them also said their congratulatory words to Lu Jue.Amidst the lively noises, Lu Jue leaned into Lu Jue\u2019s ear and said to him softly, \u201cHappy birthday, Xiao Juejue.\u201dHer warm breath landing on his ear made him happy. His thin lips perked up a little and a small dimple could be seen on him.Mother Lu hadn\u2019t seen Lu Jue smiled in a long time. When she noticed her son smiling all of a sudden, she grabbed Father Lu\u2019s hand excitedly. \u201cLook, Xiao Jue is smiling. He is happy that we threw a birthday party for him.\u201dFather Lu stroked his wife\u2019s slightly messy hair. There was tenderness in his piercing eyes. \u201cYou are right.\u201dHe looked down and looked at Lu Jue\u2019s pretty and pink lips.Lu Jue suddenly recalled what he saw on the roof the other day. How the boy had planted his lips on the girl\u2019s.He wasn\u2019t silly. He knew that was a kiss.Lu Jue recalled how the boy did it and, lowering his head, he laned in even closer, his face almost touching Ning Zhi\u2019s.His breath was warm and Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes were filled with shock.Lu Jue planted his lips gently and tentatively on Ning Zhi\u2019s and he felt softness.Soft and fragrant. It was a fragrance that he liked.It was just a quick peck. Not really a kiss.Ignorantly, Lu Jue wanted more and, the next second, the feeling on his lips disappeared gradually and the person in front of him faded out more and more until she was gone completely.Lu Jue\u2019s dark black eyes were stunned and he couldn\u2019t even move.Next to him, noticing that her son was in a trance, Mother Lu patted him quickly and said to him, \u201cXiao Jue, you need to cut the cake.\u201dLu Jue turned to look at the candles on the cake that he had blown out. His long and straight eyelashes fluttered, leaving two shadows on his cheeks.He stood there quietly for a long time, like a pitiful little thing.The strange big sister had lied to him.He made a wish. But she disappeared anyway.***Ning Zhi opened up her eyes in dim light.She touched her lips with her hand and they still seemed to be tingling.Ning Zhi pursed her lips forcefully. She turned to look at Lu Jue that was lying in bed next to her. He had kissed her for no reason. Certainly, he watched Song Jinshang kissing the beauty queen and picked it up from them.Yup. It was easy to make a good kid bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Did Lu Jue recognize her or did he not? (1)Ning Zhi looked at her little storage. She had only 4 little suns remaining. She had spent a total of 36 little suns during her last trip.The little suns didn\u2019t go very far.Ning Zhi summoned Overlord. \u201cHow many little suns will I need for my next trip?\u201dShe had already mentally prepared herself that with each trip, she would be needing even more little suns.Overlord told her cautiously: [Host, you will need 50 little suns next time.]Ning Zhi gasped. Hot dang! Straight up 20 more little suns!\u201cDo you think I am playing a game of Plants v Zombies? Do you think Lu Jue is just like the sun flower in the game and can produce limitless little suns? And that it is easy to obtain little suns from him?\u201dOverlord: [Host, I can tell you right now that you will only need more little suns the further you go.] With comparison, its host would know that what she needed right now was just a very small amount.\u201cShut up. Don\u2019t tell me that right now.\u201dNing Zhi had a bad feeling. She worried that she would burst out crying if she found out now. It was better that she found them out one at a time. At least she would feel discouraged.When Ning Zhi woke up the next morning, she saw that Lu Jue had already woken up and had changed into his red workout clothing, getting ready for his morning jog.She must say that Lu Jue was handsome and tall and he looked especially good in the red workout gear. Red was a good color on him.She was dazed looking at him from the bed.Lu Jue had placed the clothes that he had changed out of neatly on their usual spots. Even his shoes were put in the exact same spot as usual.It was as though every piece of clothing and every pair of shoes had been marked in his brain. He would always remember where they belong.Ning Zhi was very impressed at how clean and neat Lu Jue was.Contrary to him, Ning Zhi would normally just toss her clothes aside. If it wasn\u2019t for the domestic helpers at home, there would be piles of her clothes and very messy.Suddenly, Lu Jue turned and looked at her.Ning Zhi curved her lips. \u201cMorning.\u201dLu Jue gave her a blank look as he walked over to her.While Ning Zhi was still shocked, Lu Jue bent down and got close to her.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lu Jue\u2019s face got bigger and bigger in front of her and his beautiful pair of cherry-blossom eyes stared straight at her.Yes, he was staring at her as though he was seeing something through her. His eyes drew a blank but also dubious at the same time.Lu Jue reached his hand out and touched Ning Zhi on her cheeks.Ning Zhi could feel his slender and long fingers running over his brows and nose.Just like when she had transmigrated over, the youthful xiao Lu Jue, too, had touched her face in the dark.Was that his way to recognizing someone?Lu Jue\u2019s fingertips were chilly and, with them running over her lips, Ning Zhi could feel her face began to burn. He had no idea that he was teasing her.\u201cLu Jue.\u201d Ning Zhi couldn't help but asked him, \u201cWhy are you stroking me? Do you remember me?\u201dLu Jue didn\u2019t say anything. He etched her features once.After a long while, he finally said slowly, \u201cUgly.\u201dNing Zhi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was calling her ugly, again!Lu Jue looked at her a few times, retrieved his hand, and repeated in his dull and low voice, \u201cUgly.\u201dHe got up and left after he finished talking.Ning Zhi punched the bed in anger. What was so ugly about her? She had already regained 33% of her beauty. She was totally delicate and pretty.Lu Jue\u2019s idea of beauty was off.Then again, Ning Zhi recalled that Lu Jue had always been looking at her original, impeccably pretty look. In comparison, one-third of her original look was quite ugly.She sighed. She wished she could earn lots of little suns and get all of her halo back.But, did Lu Jue recognize her or did he not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - Did Lu Jue recognize her or did he not? (2)Ning Zhi\u2019s sprained ankle was still swollen and she needed about a week\u2019s rest. She was still hopping like a rabbit when she walked.She saw Mother Lu working on flower arrangement when she got down to the first floor.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stay and rest in your room with your foot injury?\u201d said Mother Lu when she saw Ning Zhi limping over. \u201cYou should ask someone for help so you won\u2019t risk injuring yourself again.\u201dNing Zhi limped over and sat down on the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. My foot is not really hurting anymore.\u201dEven just staying at home, Mother Lu was dressed in very dignified and delicate manner. Her extravagance that was built up over the years shown through every one of her motions.Had Lu Jue not have autism or that his illness could improve or even be cured, Mother Lu\u2019s life would be even happier.Ning Zhi asked Mother Lu if they had found out more after the driver from yesterday had been arrested.\u201cDong Zhou had someone looking into it already. So far we hadn\u2019t found anything suspicious. The driver had a lot to drink and the incident was ruled a DUI preliminarily,\u201d said Mother Lu to Ning Zhi. \u201cTo be thorough, Lu Shenyuan will continue to follow up on this.\u201dNing Zhi was surprised. Lu Shenyuan would be the one following up on it?Mother Lu said, \u201cShenyuan was the one who brought it up. He said this might not be a simple DUI.\u201dNing Zhi frowned. She felt that there was more to it. Perhaps it was because she didn\u2019t trust the front that Lu Shenyuan put up usually and that she didn\u2019t trust him.Ning Zhi asked tentatively, \u201cWho will you side with if conflict ever happens between Lu Jue and Lu Shenyuan?\u201dMother Lu smiled and said in an affirmative way, \u201cThat scenario you are describing will never happen.\u201dUnder Ning Zhi\u2019s questioning look, Mother Lu told her, \u201cShenyuan loves Xiao Jue. He would let Xiao Jue have what he wants and will not have conflicts with him.\u201cYou have no idea. Shenyuan had saved Xiao Jue before in the past.\u201dNing Zhi was shocked. Lu Shenyuan had saved Lu Jue?She asked curious, \u201cMom, tell me the story.\u201d\u201cXiao Jue had fallen into a lake once and Shenyuan was the first one who discovered it and immediately jumped in to save him.\u201d Mother Lu was going down the memory lane. \u201cIf he would risk his life for Xiao Jue, he would never have conflicts with Xiao Jue. He would only let Xiao Jue have what he wants.\u201dNing Zhi\u2019s brows furrowed. She felt that that couldn\u2019t be the whole story.After witnessing what Lu Shenyuan had done to Xiao Jue in private, she could be certain that Lu Shenyuan was not a fan of Lu Jue. As such, why would he risk his life for Lu Jue?Mother Lu was not stupid. With Ning Zhi suddenly bringing up this subject, she sensed something. Perhaps Ning Zhi was worried that Shenyuan would fight over the inheritance with Xiao Jue?She said to Ning Zhi subtly, \u201cShenyuan had always defended Xiao Jue since he was a child and he still does. He is working hard on learning to manage the Lu Corporation but the Lu Corporation belongs to Xiao Jue. With Shenyuan\u2019s help, we will be able to keep the Lu Corporation within the family and he will be able to help out Xiao Jue.\u201dNing Zhi knew fully well the reason behind Mother and Father Lu adopted a child since childhood. Partly it was to take care of their good friend\u2019s child and partly so Lu Jue would have a brother to look over him after they had passed away.Problem was that Lu Shenyuan was a vicious tiger. He would not take care of Lu Jue; he would only swallow Lu Jue.Lu Shenyuan\u2019s pretense was so good that nobody was suspicious of him. If she wanted to call him out on it, she would have to wait for him to slip somehow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Did Lu Jue recognize her or did he not? (3)Lu Shenyuan walked over at this point. He was just a tad shorter than Lu Jue but still very tall. With his greyish silver suit on, he seemed elegant and noble.Lu Shenyuan\u2019s lips curved and, with a handsome smile on him, said, \u201cI seemed to hear mom talking about me?\u201d\u201cYou are home today?\u201d Mother Lu smiled and said, \u201cI was praising about you to Ning Zhi. I heard from Dong Zhou that you have completed a big project spectacularly recently and that the shareholders were very pleased with you.\u201d\u201cYeah, I left an important contract at home.\u201d Lu Shenyuan responded. \u201cAs for my achievement, that was all because Dad was helping me from behind. It will still be a while before I can do it on my own.\u201dMother Lu\u2019s smile thickened. Lu Shenyuan had always been a humble since children and never fought over anything. They chatted for a little longer and she said, \u201cOkay, you go on then.\u201dLu Shenyuan nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take off now. I\u2019ve checked the weather report and it is going to rain in the next couple of days. The weather will get cold. Be mindful to stay warm, Mom.\u201dMother Lu smiled and said, \u201cOkay, I will.\u201dLu Shenyuan nodded at Ning Zhi when he finished talking and before he took off.Had she not found out about Lu Shenyuan\u2019s true self in the past, she would for sure think that he was a handsome gentleman who cared a lot about his family.Then again, as the male lead of the novel. It only made sense that he was ambitious.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t move around easily and, it being Saturday and she had no classes, she had someone brought a chair to the study.Lu Jue was reading and she sat next to him and did nothing.She browsed her phone mindlessly and read about some of Lin Tiantian\u2019s fans talking about running into Lin Tiantian at a shopping center. Lin Tiantian was helping out with a skincare product that she was the spokesperson for.Ning Zhi recalled that Lin Tiantian had made fun of her about her skin quality and bragged about being the spokesperson of a skincare product.Ning Zhi was a very petty person and she remembered it to this date.As though something had occurred to her, Ning Zhi took the book away from Lu Jue.Lu Jue pursed his lips. He was unhappy that his reading was interrupted.Ning Zhi scooted her chair closer to Lu Jue and whispered to him in a mysterious way. \u201cDo you still want me to touch you?\u201dShe wooed him like a demon who was tempting a good kid to do something bad. \u201cWhat say I touch you right here this time, hmm?\u201dThe tip of her finger landed on Lu Jue\u2019s nose. She has yet to try that area before and she wondered if it would produce little suns.Ning Zhi couldn\u2019t wait to try and she was experiencing an indescribable excitement.Lu Jue looked at her quietly, then, slowly, he said to her, \u201cYes.\u201dFor some inexplicable reasons, Ning Zhi suddenly felt nervous. She felt that Lu Jue\u2019s face was even prettier than normal at this close distance.His eyes and brows were deep and his nose tall. The shape of his eyes was impeccable. Even his thin lips were exactly how she liked them.Lu Jue was very tall. He was even much taller than her when both of them were sitting down.Ning Zhi placed her hands on his broad and strong shoulders and said, \u201cLower your head.\u201dLu Jue blinked and lowered his head.Ning Zhi leaned into him and planted her lips onto his tall and straight nose. It was a little bit cold to the touch.With a small peck and, instantly, Ning Zhi saw a little sun in Lu Jue\u2019s indicator.So he did like her kissing him on his nose eh?Ning Zhi\u2019s eyes curved and she kept on kissing him.The shiny gold little suns rushed over to her. Ning Zhi counted and she had 6 of them so far. That and the original 4 that she had gave her a total of 10 of them.Ning Zhi wanted more so she kissed Lu Jue on the tip of his nose again but got nothing this time.It\u2019d seem like kissing him on his nose did not make him as happy as when she kissed him on his chin and ear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Did Lu Jue recognize her or did he not? (4)Ning Zhi was not happy with the result. She looked at Lu Jue\u2019s forehead and said to him, \u201cLower your head some more.\u201dLu Jue lowered his head again.Lu Jue placed her hands on both sides of his cheeks and sincerely and lightly kissed him between his brows.One little sun popped up.She had come to realize that Lu Jue was a cute treasure chest that was waiting for her to explore bit by bit.Ning Zhi got 5 more little suns from kissing Lu Jue on his forehead. Along with what she had before, she now had 15 little suns.It was very quiet inside the study and the curtain fluttered in the light breeze.Lu Jue lifted his head some and his body was forced to be next to the desk. Ning Zhi reached out her hand and touched the prominent and sexy Adam's apple in his neck.The first little sun.The second little sun.The third little sun.\u2026\u2026He was already so happy before she even kissed him?Ning Zhi, being a meanie, purposefully stroked Lu Jue\u2019s Adam's apple. She saw him gulped and his Adam's apple moved up and down.Lu Jue\u2019s thin eyelids fluttered nonstop and the sun casted in from the outside. The corners of his eyes were a little red. He looked both like he was in involuntary discomfort or a little animal who was elated in joy.When Ning Zhi applied a little force on the tip of her finger, Lu Jue would even give a dull grunt.The grunt made Ning Zhi\u2019s face burn.Lu Jue looked up. His beautiful cherry-blossom eyes were dark and limpid. He looked at Ning Zhi blankly looking both satisfied but also uncomfortable.His held his hands together and veins popped up on the back of his hand. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to ask her to do.These last couple of days, Lin Tiantian had been visiting the spa frequently. She had been having pimples on her face and she needed them take care of.Luckily, the situation was not too serious and the very minor imperfection could be covered up with makeup.Today, she needed to attend a promotional activity of one of the skincare products that she was a spokesperson for. The front of her shop was already crowded by her fans.\u201cTiantian is so pretty.\u201dLin Tiantian had on a golden dress with glitters. Her makeup was delicate and her temperament noble. All of them excited her fans.\u201cOOOOOHHHHHHhhhh, Tiantian is so pretty today.\u201d\u201cWho said she wasn\u2019t looking as pretty as she was before? If only I could be as pretty as her, I am willing to live on plain buns.\u201dFor sure it was her competitor\u2019s smearing campaign. Saying that Tiantian had a plastic surgery was silly talk. Why would Tiantian needs to have a plastic surgery?\u201d\u2026\u2026The fans were separated from her by the security guard and could only see her from afar. That, however, did not make them any less excited.Lin Tiantian greeted them in a poised manner.The host, next to her, praised Lin Tiantian\u2019s good look and how she fit perfectly the image of his product.\u201cI have been using this product everyday lately and its effects were very obvious.\u201d Lin Tiantian did her best to recommend the skincare product to the others.Nevertheless, as soon as she had finished talking and in front of all the reporters and fans, she skin became a few shades darker right in front of the cameras. Her pinkish little mouth suddenly became bigger and thicker and red pimples appeared on her face all over again.Everybody there looked at Lin Tiantian in shock.Lin Tiantian, however, having no idea what had happened, enjoyed being basked in her fans\u2019 look. Ever since she had taken Ning Zhi\u2019s halo, she had been getting more and more used to others\u2019 envious look.She smiled and continued to talk about the product. \u201cThis emulsion is very moisturizing and, when applied at night, you will see a glow on your skin when you wake up the next morning. I enjoy using this product a lot lately. I feel that my skin had become fairer, moisturized and smooth.\u201dAs she said that, Lin Tiantian lifted the bottle and placed it next to her cheek. She cocked her head slightly so her cheek touched the bottle. Smiling, she waited for the reporters to take her pictures.The reporters snapped picture of Lin Tiantian madly. This was too crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - She deserved it! (1)The flash lights flashed nonstop and Lin Tiantian put on different postures. Her smile was filled with confidence and she even shouted out the advertising slogan, \u201cPlease support Xia Corporation\u2019s skincare products in the future. You deserve charm and beauty.\u201dThe fans there, witnessing the change in Lin Tiantian\u2019s look, were a little dazed.\u201cDid you guys see it? Lin Tiantian seemed to have turned darked all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cWhat happened? I saw it too? I saw that she had suddenly became darker from head to toe. She was fair and translucence just a little bit ago and darkened all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cWhy did her lips look swollen all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cAnd these pimples that just popped up on her face. Oh my gosh. Is that an allergic reaction to these skincare products?\u201d\u201cI think that is an allergic reaction to the products too.\u201d\u201cMi, you are scaring me. Oh mi, Lin Tiantian had turned ugly in person again. Last time it happened when she was streaming. Then it happened again today. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt seemed like her makeup was gone?\u201d\u201cWhen have you seem makeup just disappearing without using any makeup remover? I suspect that she had a botched plastic surgery and it is now having an adverse reaction.\u201d\u201cOh, stop saying that. She\u2019s having an allergic reaction. Tiantian was screwed by the sponsor.\u201d\u2026\u2026The fans were in a heated discussion Lin Tiantian, however, thought they were just excited to see her. The smile on her thickened.Next to her, the host was about to hand the microphone over to Lin Tiantian but when she saw Lin Tiantian\u2019s face, she was befuddled.How did Lin Tiantian become uglier all of a sudden?Her usually delicate features and lost most of their delicacy and she wasn\u2019t as bright as she normally was. Most importantly, pimples had just popped up on her face and she was holding up the products of the merchant in her hands.That was like telling everyone that the products were problematic and smearing the merchant\u2019s reputation.The host quickly tried to salvage the situation. \u201cOur Sister Tiantian is tired. Why don\u2019t we take a break, Sister Tiantian.\u201dLin Tiantian turned and, still having the same smile on her, gave the host a disapproving look. She said with a smile, \u201cThe next item on the agenda is me applying this skincare product in front of everyone on the spot.\u201dShe was a little bit unhappy with the organizer. Where did they find this host person who didn\u2019t even have their agenda memorized?\u201cSister Tiantian, your\u2026\u2026\u201d The host was in a difficult position, she wanted to remind Lin Tiantian of the change on her face but she couldn\u2019t possibly do that in front of all the reporters.Lin Tiantian looked unhappy but her words were still tender. \u201cI\u2019m not tired yet. All my fans are here. I wouldn\u2019t leave them hanging when I go take a break. I don\u2019t mind being a little tired for them.\u201dThe host stopped talking with a look of embarrassment.The fans, blocked by the security guards, had mixed emotions. How was it that their idol\u2019s look had changed?Was it allergic reaction or the aftermath of a botched plastic surgery?When it was the segment for Lin Tiantian to demonstrate the use of the products, she walked inside the shop, followed by the reporters and a bunch of her fans.Pouring some of the fluid onto her palm, she said, \u201cPlease hand me a mirror.\u201d She asked one of the workers with a smile.Lin Tiantian enjoyed the looks from the crowd, especially when they were stunned by her beauty.She asked the worker again, \u201cWhere\u2019s the mirror?\u201dWhat was wrong with the workers today? Their efficiency was horrid.\u201cSister Tiantian, here\u2019s a mirror.\u201dA worker handed a mirror to Lin Tiantian from the counter.The disapproving look finally disappeared from Lin Tiantian. She raised the mirror with a smile on her and was about to apply the fluid in her palm onto her face.The second that Lin Tiantian looked into the mirror, she let out a loud, shocked cry.The mirror that she was holding in her hand fell onto the floor at the same time. \u201cMy face! My face!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - She deserved it! (2)Lin Tiantian was in shock and disbelief.The reporters snapped photos like mad as they found the situation comical.Lin Tiantian quickly covered up her face. Her assistant pushed the crowd aside and said to her, \u201cSister Tiantian, let\u2019s take off first\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Tiantian was about to out of her mind. She would never dream that she would turn ugly in front of so many of her fans.Inside the study, Lu Jue\u2019s body could not be more tense. The tips of his ears had turned so red that it looked like blood would drip out of them. The second that Ning Zhi took her hand back, Lu Jue had, once again, let out a deep and dull grunt.Ning Zhi only felt that her ears tingled when she heard Lu Jue\u2019s deep and dull voice.She stopped when no more little suns were appearing.The corner of Lu Jue\u2019s eyes were red and his eyes limpid. He looked like he had been bulled by her and looked pitiful. Ning Zhi must admit that she was being a horrible sinner.She quickly reached out her hands and pulled Lu Jue\u2019s collar up to cover up his Adam's apple that was starting to turn red from her teasing.Lu Jue looked at her blankly as though questioning her why she had stopped.His dark eyes were clear and filled with desire. Ning Zhi only wanted to cover up his eyes. \u201cEverything in moderation. We will do it again next time.\u201dShe had barely touched him on his Adam's apple and he had already reacted to strongly with restrained desires in his eyes. It looked like he could explode if he was teased any more.Ning Zhi dared not take it too far. Its better to slow down. Even a bunny will bite if it is forced into a corner.Lu Jue lowered his eyes and his limpid and bright eyes were hidden. His hands that were gripped tightly relaxed slowly.Ning Zhi counted her little suns. Including the ones that she had just gotten from touching Lu Jue on his Adam's apple, she now had 27 little suns.\u201cI want to exchange for 27% of halo.\u201d Ning Zhi summoned Overlord and wanted to exchanged all of them for her halo in a very generous manner.Overlord lamented that he was surely following the right host. Big fish and meats every day. Wonderful![Okay, host. 27% halo had been exchanged.]Ning Zhi lipped out of the study and walked in front f a mirror.She started examining herself carefully. If she was fair-looking before then, after this last halo exchange, she had recovered to 60% of her old self.Her features had become more delicate as though a few layers of gauze that had been covering over her halo had been removed and lights were able to shine through and her face was becoming clearer.Her nose was perky and her little mouth red and moist. Her eyes were black, bright, and limpid. She felt that her eyes could be prettier.Not only had her features changed, even her skin had become fairer and flawless and had a glow to them. It wasn\u2019t as good when it was at its 100% but she was already fairer than most.There weren\u2019t a lot of changes to her body this time. Ning Zhi felt that she would regain her shape when she had gotten back her halo.She touched her hair and they were black, smooth, shiny, and the tip of it was a little curly with no dryness or split ends. She couldn\u2019t stop stroking her own hair.Ning Zhi returned happily to her study when she was studying her own look.In front of the desk, Lu Jue had already recovered. He was, once again, reading quietly and expressionlessly.Ning Zhi went back to siting next to him. He quickly glanced over at her and, noticing that she had picked her phone back up and was ignoring him, his thin lips tightened.Ning Zhi was curious what Lin Tiantian looked like now after she had lost another 27% of the halo.She went online and, surely, Lin Tiantian was on the most trending list again: Lin Tiantian\u2019s face changed in mere seconds, as bad as a botched plastic surgery.She clicked into the pictures and videos taking on site and the corners of her lips curved upward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - She deserved it! (3)Lin Tiantian was telling everyone how amazing the products was and how she had been using it everyday when, the very next second, her look just changed.Ning Zhi knew well how important Lin Tiantian\u2019s looks was to her.She had now already taken 60% of her halo back and Lin Tiantian\u2019s looks had changed twice publicly. Just the thought of Lin Tiantian breaking down on site was enough to make Ning Zhi laughed out loud. That was amazing.Besides, this was the first time she had seen an actress actively trying to ruin their client\u2019s reputation.Ning Zhi clicked open the comment section and saw the comments under it. All of Lin Tiantian\u2019s fans were speaking poorly about the products.\u201cPoor Lin Tiantian had been scammed. She had signed up to be the spokesperson of a 3-No Product.\u201d*\u201cWuwuwu. My Sister Tiantian had an allergic reaction to the products. She is a beauty even without makeup and had never had plastic surgeries. Please stop with the rumors.\u201d\u201cI feel so bad for Sister Tiantian. Make sure your team vat it out next time before you become a spokesperson.\u201d\u201cThe poor merchant, being blamed for Lin Tiantian\u2019s issues. I\u2019ve watched the video. Her face changed within seconds. It was almost paranormal. What else could it be if not a botched plastic surgery?\u201d\u201cThe merchant is crying in the bathroom. Can Lin Tiantian please stop calling herself the prettiest woman in the entertainment circle?\u201d\u201cI was there in person as well. Lin Tiantian\u2019s looks was only in the eyes of her fans. She is pretty but many other actresses are just as pretty. Please stop saying that she is the prettiest.\u201d\u201cSister Tiantian was the victim of the merchant\u2019s products. She had an allergic reaction to the products. All of her fans know that. Her skin was fair and fragile. It must have been an allergic reaction. She didn\u2019t have a plastic surgery because she didn\u2019t need one.\u201d***Ning Zhi hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Tiantian\u2019s fans would place the blame onto the merchant. By now the merchant was probably in tears from anger.The table turned that night.The merchant posted their product certification and other associated proof that their products were not 3-No product. They even listed out all of their ingredients and they did not contain any allergens.Netizens love melons.\u201cAhahaha. Their official account was short of asking a certain actress to stop placing blame on them.\u201d\u201cPoor merchant. Somehow ended up with an irresponsible spokesperson.\u201d\u201cHer fans need to have their eyes checked. I watched Lin Tiantian\u2019s video repeatedly \u2013 she had pimples on her face and her lips became thicker, which is the sign of a botchedhyaluronic acid injection.\u201d\u201cOnly her fans brag about her looks. She really isn\u2019t all that stunning. I saw her in person today. She was just an ordinary pretty girl. Then she got worse with the sudden change.\u201d\u201cThe merchant had faceslap a certain actress with truth. They shouldn\u2019t let her place the blame on them.\u201d\u201cThe merchant should call off the contract! Had her pay the fines!\u201d\u201cThis was the second time that Lin Tiantian\u2019s face had changed publicly. And she wanted to place the blame onto the merchant this time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been using the Xia Corporation\u2019s products for three years. Their ingredients are very mild and I feel very comfortable using them. This was the first time I have heard of someone having an allergic reaction to them and it was their spokesperson at that. That was simply odd.\u201d\u201cGo away, Rubbish Merchant. We trust our Sister Tiantian unless she said so herself.\u201d***Ning Zhi hadn\u2019t expected the merchant to clarify the incident so quickly. But that made sense as well. This involved image and quality of their products.When she limped downstairs, she happened to run into Lin Tiantian, who had just returned with a long face, looking distressed.When she saw Ning Zhi, she stopped and gave Ning Zhi a death glare.\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Lin Tiantian didn\u2019t even care anymore. There was another deep crack on her jade.Ning Zhi frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I am not following.\u201d___Translator's notes:A) no manufactured date, not certified, and no manufacturer's information (i.e. nobody know where it came from) or B) no manufacturer's name, no manufacturer's address, and no barcodePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
