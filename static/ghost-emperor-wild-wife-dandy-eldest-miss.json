Also, not long ago with one swoop, he turned four countries into Longyuan\u2019s subordinates. Hearing of this matter, His Majesty was extremely pleased, not only moving Yun Luo back to the Imperial City to receive commendations but also to give a blank edict. With this blank edict, it is the equivalent of His Majesty\u2019s promise to fulfill one request of any kind.However, after victoriously coming back, the Great General Yun Luo did not attend the court meeting to see the Emperor but rushed back to the General\u2019s Estate instead.Following behind him, the soldiers were all silent. Nobody was clearer than them about why the Great General Yun Luo was anxious to return home! All of this could be attributed to the eldest miss of the Yun Clan.It was said that while Great General Yun Luo was guarding the border, that trash provoked an enormous amount of trouble. Her typical arrogant, domineering, rampant, and overbearing personality could be overlooked, but she recently caused a scandal by snatching a pretty man on the street. This led to the Crown Prince annulling his engagement with her. However, she could not stand this development, so she chose to commit suicide by hanging herself.If she really died, then the General Estate would have one less disaster. Yet, this trash didn\u2019t die. Not only was she saved, but she also appeared to have changed into a different person. She locked herself at home and did not go out for half a month. Hence, when General Yun Luo triumphantly returned to the city, he was in a rush to return to the General Estate.\u2026At this time, on top of the artificial hill inside the General Estate, a young lady in white had both of her hands behind her head as she lazily leaned against a rock, her eyes were half-squinted as she looked at the blazing sun in the sky.\u201cI can\u2019t believe time went by this quickly, I came to this continent a little more than half a month ago. Thankfully, during this period of time, I have completely accepted this body\u2019s original memories and also came to understand what kind of place this is.\u201dHalf a month ago, she was conducting an experiment in the medical lab at Huaxia University when she accidentally caused an explosion. Upon waking up, she found herself in this strange world\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun Luofeng was her name as well when she was at Huaxia, but the difference was that she was Huaxia University\u2019s top student and the teacher\u2019s most outstanding pupil. However, this Yun Luofeng was a well-known trash who was talented in neither the literary arts nor martial arts. She could not even do the simple act of gathering spiritual energy, let alone becoming a true spirit cultivator.In this world, the strong was respected, so the ridicule and condemnation that a trash who could not become a spirit cultivator suffered from could be imagined.However, this trash did not merely have a general for a grandfather, but she also had the number one dream lover of many females in Longyuan, His Highness the Crown Prince, for a fiance since birth. Yet, this trash was not satisfied with a perfect fiance like the Crown Prince and actually dared to molest a man from a good family! This caused the Crown Prince, who finally couldn\u2019t endure it anymore, to risk offending General Yun Luo and terminated his engagement with the trash.Who would have thought that the trash, Yun Luofeng, not only did not repent, but she also wanted to use suicide to threaten His Highness the Crown Prince to have a change of heart? However, the Crown Prince just turned around and left. Thankfully, the people in the General Estate saved her in time, preventing her from the misfortune of dying.However, nobody knew that when Yun Luofeng was rescued, she was already dead. Now, it was actually Huaxia\u2019s Yun Luofeng inside the body.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

She also wouldn\u2019t have rushed up to grab him and ended up being charged with molesting a pretty man.Of course, if it were only that, people would not have misunderstood Yun Luofeng\u2019s relationship with that man.The important reason was that when the man was grabbed by her, he started to yell, claiming that the eldest miss from Yun family was endlessly pestering him and wanted to force him to be her boy-toy. Sadly, Yun Luofeng wasn\u2019t good with words and lost the ability to defend herself in her panic. So her silence confirmed the charge.Recalling the events to there, the young girl internally sighed, \u201cThis Yun Luofeng is a noble daughter of a general, but she\u2019s too stupid! She couldn\u2019t see through such an easy set-up and was deluded into thinking that she could use her own life to regain the Crown Prince\u2019s heart! If it wasn\u2019t for the Crown Prince\u2019s orders, why would there be someone wearing his clothes in public?\u201dThe Crown Prince, Gao Ling, was Long Yuan Kingdom\u2019s most handsome man. He was incredibly talented and had outstanding abilities! With his identity and position, why would he be willing to marry a trash?So she could understand his grievances.However, what she could not understand was why, in order to retain his reputation, Gao Ling would frame Yun Luofeng for being immoral and ignoring her engaged status to molest a pretty man.At this time, Yun Luofeng\u2019s personal maidservant, Qingyan, rushed over. Her originally panicked face changed into one of happiness when she saw the young girl sitting on the artificial hill. Hurriedly running to the front of Yun Luofeng, she panted, \u201cMiss, Master General has returned, he is ordering you to see him in the study.\u201d\u201cGrandfather returned?\u201dYun Luofeng froze for a second. How could she forget that today is the day of Great General Yun Luo\u2019s triumphant return! Not long ago, this was the day that this body\u2019s original owner had waited for with anticipation! Who knew that she would die from someone else\u2019s scheme before she could see her grandfather, a person she had wholeheartedly missed for ten long years.\u201cLet\u2019s go, take me to see Grandfather, the old man!\u201dShe regained her wits and pinched Qingyan\u2019s little cheeks, which appeared as delicious as an apple. Her stunning face was adorned with a wicked smile.And then, without waiting for Qingyan to react, she headed toward the direction of the study.\u2026Inside the General Estate\u2019s study, an old and gray-haired man had an expressionless face while he sat on the chair. He looked at the white-clothed girl standing in front of him with a solemn expression.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe standing Yun Luofeng lazily yawned. She had already entered this study for half an hour. But in this half an hour, General Yun Luo said nothing and just expressionlessly continued to look at her. Seeing General Yun Luo\u2019s lack of speech, Yun Luofeng, of course, wouldn\u2019t speak first.Finally, General Yun Luo could not hold in his anger and sternly asked with a heavy expression on his old face, \u201cI heard that you recently had some publicly indecent conduct. Shouldn\u2019t you explain yourself to me?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of explanation do you want?\u201d She lightly laughed, \u201cIf you choose to believe the rumor from outside rather than your granddaughter, then what you heard is what happened, I have no need to explain.\u201d\u201cPresumptuous!\u201dGeneral Yun Luo slapped the desk with a bang, causing the desk to break in two from its force.

When I suffered from humiliation, who stood up for me? When someone schemed against me, and I hoped for someone to stand out and protect me, where were you?\u201dIf General Yun Luo did not guard the border, would the former Yun Luofeng live such a miserable life? Or even be framed and ruined?Therefore, she held resentment in her heart towards this grandfather who left home when she was four and never came back afterward.It was due to the resentment of this body\u2019s former owner that she would speak like this to the old man.However, once Yun Luofeng finished saying this, she felt her whole body relax as if something broke free. She knew that it was because she spoke what this body\u2019s original owner wanted to say, causing the last remaining trace of regret in this body to disappear.The young girl\u2019s accusing voice made the furious Yun Luo calm down. His aged body laid weak and limp in the chair with a bitter smile on his face.He knew that he owed his granddaughter a lot for all these years.Particularly her words just now, they were like a heavy stick ruthlessly hitting his heart, making it unbearably tight. In the end, all he could do was heavily sigh.Since ancient times, it was difficult for devotion and filial duty to coexist\u2014the same with loyalty and family. For his loyalty towards His Majesty, he set aside his granddaughter, who was only four years old, and went to the border. He was gone for a whole ten years, just what kind of life did she live for the last ten years as someone who couldn\u2019t cultivate?But, once he returned, he disregarded what was right and wrong, and rebuked his granddaughter for those rumors.\u201cFeng\u2019er\u2026\u201d Yun Luo lifted his calloused hand and shakily extended them toward Yun Luofeng before weakly putting it down in the end. \u201cGrandfather wronged you and also wronged the entire Yun Clan. Your parents sacrificed themselves for the country, but Grandfather didn\u2019t take good care of you.\u201dAt that moment, the originally high-spirited General Yun Luo seemed to have aged a few years.Before, he was this angry because he was disappointed in her! But he appeared to have forgotten that she was left parentless at three, and he himself left home when she was four. Nobody had disciplined her since she was young, so how could she possibly meet his expectations?He could still vaguely remember when he had to leave back then, how the four-year-old Xiao Luofeng pulled on his clothes, begging him to not leave.In the end, for the safety of the citizens of Long Yuan Kingdom, he heartlessly left her.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, then I\u2019m going back to rest,\u201d Yun Luofeng sleepily blinked her eyes and languidly spoke.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing the indifference on the young girl\u2019s face, there was a touch of guilt deep in Yun Luo\u2019s eyes. He opened his mouth to say something, but all the words felt stuck in his throat, so he could not voice out a single sound.\u201cGo then.\u201dFinally, he lightly sighed and weakly dismissed her with his hand. These two words seemed to have exhausted all his strength, and he collapsed back with his eyes closed.At this time, General Yun Luo no longer seemed to be as vigorous as he was on the battlefield. He appeared incredibly frail, as though he had his candle blown out by the wind. It was almost unbearable for Yun Luofeng, but, in the end, she said nothing and turned around to leave the study room.It wasn\u2019t until the white figure disappeared that Yun Luo reopened his eyes.

His features had a touch of sadness. His skin was very pale and white\u2014the kind of sickly white where it looked like he could collapse at any moment. Seeing him would make other people feel pity. Unfortunately, this elegant yet indifferent man happened to be sitting in a wheelchair; sickly and physically disabled, making it seem like that he couldn\u2019t endure any heavy burdens.\u201cFather, you left when she was four, so you don\u2019t know the humiliations she suffered over the years. And I, as her uncle, had no way to stand out to defend or protect her, causing her to become what she is today: an indifferent young woman.\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was like sweet spring water, incredibly refreshing.But, if other people were here and heard how this man addressed Yun Luo, they would be in shock.Everyone knew that the great General Yun Luo only had two sons. In the past, one son was more talented than the other. The Yun family\u2019s second young master, Yun Qingya. When he was only fifteen years old, he had already reached the pinnacle of the middle-level spirit cultivator and was just one step away from breaking through to high-level spirit cultivator.It was known that within Longyuan, there were only two high-level spirit cultivators, one was the great General Yun Luo, and the other was the imperial family\u2019s expert.But it took both of them forty years to finally manage to pass the high-level spirit cultivator bottleneck.And yet, back then, Yun Qingya was only fifteen years old!Becoming a middle-level, peak-rank spirit cultivator at the age of 12 was a matter that would make people very proud. However, the past Yun Qingya, who achieved his ambition at a young age, seemed to forget that the tree that stands out in the forest, the wind will definitely destroy it 1 .In the middle of a competition, he defeated his opponent and attracted the wrath of the opponent\u2019s family. In the end, he fell from the top of a mountain. No one would have imagined that the supposedly dead Yun Qingya was actually still alive!\u201cQingya, you have also suffered these past years.\u201d Yun Luo laughed bitterly; guilt laced his voice as he said, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the Yun Family, you wouldn\u2019t be hiding. That power is too strong. If they knew you still lived, they definitely wouldn\u2019t let you off and also wouldn\u2019t forgive the Yun Family.\u201dYun Qingya lowered his gaze slightly, hiding eyes which were filled with sadness. He said with an indifferent, calm tone: \u201cEven if I live, so what? The way I am now is no different from being dead. My strength was wasted, I can only pull through with this disabled body and sneakily live. My own niece suffers humiliation outside, and I couldn\u2019t step out to help her. If it was a decade ago, even if you and I weren\u2019t home, nobody would have dared hurt Little Feng\u2019er.

In the end, he hid in the secret chamber. Once hidden, he hid for a little over a decade.Living in the darkness without light for a little over ten years did not help his illness. It only made it worse.What left him in even more despair was that, when he was escaping from his pursuers, his Soul Realm was destroyed. His strength disappeared, and he could no longer cultivate.If it wasn\u2019t because father already lost Brother and he could not bear to let his father bury his own child again, then maybe, he would have ended his suffering long ago and left this world.\u201cQingya,\u201d hearing Yun Qingya\u2019s words, Yun Luo was silent for a moment before saying, \u201ceven if the news that you live can\u2019t be known outside, little Feng\u2019er is still your niece.

A spirit cultivator is divided into different levels: early, middle, high, earth, sky, god, and sage. Each level is divided into low rank, intermediate rank, advanced rank, and peak rank! However, in Longyuan Kingdom, the strongest people are at high-level, and only two are at the high-level spirit cultivator level. One is my cheap grandfather, the other is the expert from the imperial family.\u201dOn the bed, a young girl opened her eyes.

Immediately, a girl\u2019s sonorous voice crashed into his ears, like a hand harshly squeezing his heart.\u201cAah.\u201dYun Luo took back his hand. In his eyes, beside guilt, now showed an additional sign of distress.This girl put so much effort to cultivate, but he actually believed outside rumors and misunderstood her; not only did he not come back and care for her but instead he interrogated her as well as broke her heart.\u201cSir General.\u201dJust when Yun Luo was feeling guilty, the housekeeper hastily came from behind, bowed with a clenched fist, and said: \u201d His Highness the Crown Prince came to pay a visit.

When she recovered, she found herself positioned within a narrow piece of land\u2026Standing in front of her was a little boy, wearing white clothes and looked like a pink jade carved cherub.

With such a good-quality physical body, although the people of this world say that the original Yun Luofeng was a waste, it was because no one could help her cultivate.

If you put outside herbs into the spiritual medicine space, those ordinary herbs will have spiritual energy; the effect is naturally incomparable to ordinary herbs,\u201d said the little boy proudly. \u201cIn the current Longxiao, spiritual energy is extremely rare on the mainland. There is no way of making spiritual plants; so, if you take out a stalk of a spiritual plant, it is bound to cause a great sensation on the mainland.\u201dYun Luofeng looked at the little boy. \u201cI know that humans and spiritual beasts can cultivate, but I have not heard of herbs that can also absorb spiritual energy.\u201dOnce he heard these words, the little boy was a bit angry.

Medicinal herbs need to rely upon spiritual energy in the world to grow, but now that the mainland has too little spiritual energy, it cannot be compared with the past.

What he chose was the second-best option.\u201cI understand,\u201d Yun Luofeng took the prescription that was handed to her by the little boy. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you have not told me what your name is?\u201dXiao Mo\u2019s face had a bright smile as, with a tender voice, he answered, \u201cMaster, I\u2019m called Xiao Mo; don\u2019t forget my name.\u201dAfter pocketing the prescription, Yun Luofeng lifted her head to look at Xiao Mo. Suddenly, the boy\u2019s lovely smile entered her sight, making her unable to hold her hands back from pinching the little guy\u2019s face. Her lips curved into an evil smile.\u201cXiao Mo, I have been here for too long; it would be easy to be found out. But I don\u2019t know how to leave?\u201dThe girl\u2019s palm was warm, so it made the boy\u2019s cheeks turn red. After hearing the girl\u2019s words, he bit his lip, he looked at her with watery eyes.\u201cMaster, you have to leave so soon? I was finally able to see you, and no one will know of your current situation. When you come to this place, in the eyes of outsiders, you look like you\u2019re asleep. No one will think you\u2019re within the Medical God\u2019s Code World.\u201dYun Luofeng was silent for a long time before slowly saying: \u201cThen can you leave this Medical God\u2019s Code World?\u201dXiao Mo shook his head, his eyes filled with loneliness.\u201cMaster, I am not a human, nor am I a spiritual beast. My spirit was born because of the Medical God\u2019s Code, I do not exist in the world. However, wait until master\u2019s strength becomes very powerful. Then I can temporarily leave the Medical God\u2019s Code world and appear by your side. But I cannot be more than 100 meters away from you.\u201d\u201cXiao Mo, this is my last question for you: why did you choose me?\u201dHuaxia\u2019s people amounted to tens of millions, she couldn\u2019t understand\u2014why did the Medical God\u2019s Code choose her in the end?\u201cI also don\u2019t know why.\u201d Xiao Mo\u2019s eyes revealed a touch of doubt. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you chose me first; if not for you, I would still be thrown somewhere in that library, perhaps, this is the reason I chose you\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026When Yun Luofeng left the space, she found herself lying in bed.

But the moment she got up, she couldn\u2019t help but pause.If she remembered correctly, before, she was forced to quit practicing because of blood loss, but now she was completely clean. Her white clothes were clean and elegant, as if they were freshly washed.What\u2019s actually going on?Yun Luofeng no longer thought about it since she didn\u2019t understand. She sneered and said, \u201cQingyan, let\u2019s go, I would like to know why did the Crown Prince come to the General\u2019s Estate.\u201dWithout waiting for Qingyan to respond, Yun Luofeng had already walked out of the room. A little while later, Qingyan finally recovered from her shock as she hurriedly chased after, her heart filled with doubts.For some unknown reason, ever since Miss\u2019s attempted suicide, it was like she was a completely different person. Even after hearing that the Crown Prince came to visit, she wasn\u2019t excited like in the past but gave a very strange impression instead.In the main hall, General Yun Luo was sitting upright, his brows were wrinkled and carried a bit of sorrow.By his side was one old person and one young person, the young one looked to be about 18-years-old. He looked handsome, carried extraordinary equipment, wore blue navy robes and his body stretched just like a sharp sword. As if he could kill someone out of the blue.Behind the young man stood an old one. Compared with the calm of the youth, the old man\u2019s face was completely livid, with eyes full of anger unable to be vented.\u201cGeneral Yun, my family\u2019s Prince has already waited here for a long time, do you not know when your family\u2019s daughter will come out?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yun Luo had some hesitation, \u201cI have already sent the maidservants to notify her, it should not be long before she arrives.\u201dOf course, Yun Luo did not tell the old guy that he also ordered the maidservants to not disturb Yun Luofeng if she is busy and to wait until she is finished before informing her to come see the Crown Prince.So, when Qingyan saw that Yun Luofeng was having an afternoon nap, she followed his instructions and had been waiting nearby for her to wake up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHmph!

If you do not want to wait, then you can leave. I will not see you out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The old man was angered by Yun Luo\u2019s words until his old face was red, his tone was angry, \u201cas we all know, Yun Luofeng only chased the Imperial Highness, the Crown Prince from morning to night. Besides chasing men, what other things does she need to do? Now that our crown prince has come, she dares to create difficulties and not come out? Isn\u2019t it just to loosen the reins only to grasp them better! Thinking that deliberately dodging his Imperial Highness, would make the Crown Prince look at her more? Yet she would not look at what she had done some time ago in broad daylight: forcefully grabbing another man! It\u2019s simply unscrupulous! Extremely shameless!\u201dYun Luo\u2019s fist slammed on the table, he looked coldly at the old man, both of his eyes filled with wrath.\u201cJing Lin, this Yun Luo\u2019s granddaughter, is not for others to say such irresponsible remarks! Moreover, what evidence do you have to prove that the rumor of my granddaughter forcefully snatching another man is true? Basing it on that man\u2019s one-sided words?

It was clear that he was remembering the time when he took all of Longyuan by storm.That year, Yun Luofeng\u2019s parents led the soldiers to fight the enemy, and the result was that the current Prime Minister Mu had accidentally revealed this intelligence which was obtained by the enemy. This caused the tragic death of her parents. For this reason, a grieving Yun Luo called upon all of his soldiers to level the Prime Minister\u2019s Estate, it caused a great sensation in the Kingdom of Longyuan.In the end, the Emperor of Longyuan had to come forward to settle the matter.Although the Emperor made him go to the Yun Luofeng\u2019s parents tomb every year to let the Prime Minister express his apology and compensate for the loss, people still understood that the Emperor is biased to the Prime Minister\u2019s house.For no other reason than the fact that Prime Minister Mu\u2019s daughter is the Emperor\u2019s favored concubine. Originally it should have been the death sentence, but Prime Minister Mu is still well and alive, rose in position every year, and ultimately climbed to the position of the Prime Minister.As for the annual grave visit?If he didn\u2019t stomp on it, it was good enough, but to also expect him to go to the grave?\u201cOld Man, recently, it seems like you get angry more frequently. You need to clear your anger.\u201dAt this time, a laugh suddenly came from outside the hall.A girl clothed in white with a touch of laziness in her smile walked in. She had a wicked charm and looked undisciplined. Her eyes looked at Yun Luo\u2019s face without a hint of laughter. From start to finish, she did not look at the youth sitting in the main hall, as if she didn\u2019t notice his existence at all.Originally, the youth was only quietly sipping tea. Only after hearing the voice of Yun Luofeng did he finally lift his head. His eyes lightly swept over her body and had a hint of regret.One had to say, this Yun Luofeng was really beautiful. Unfortunately, she was a big-chested, brainless man chaser, and did not even have a little bit of talent. So how could this rubbish of a woman have the qualification of standing by his side?He was destined to be a dragon amongst men and she, she was just a waste that everyone disdained.If he married her, his reputation would be destroyed!\u201cHehe,\u201d Yun Luo dryly coughed twice, his face had a touch of embarrassment, \u201cFeng\u2019er, you came?\u201dThis stinky brat, he was angry for her, yet she actually wants him to clear away his anger?Is there a need to anger people this much?In fact, Yun Luofeng had come to the door a while ago. So, she had already heard just about all of Grandfather and Jing Lin\u2019s conversation.Since the beginning, the old man\u2019s indiscriminate accusations toward her made her not have any good feelings toward this cheap grandfather. But she did not expect that, in front of other people, this old guy would stand up for her. Therefore, the feelings of having a grandfather seemed\u2026 not too bad?Yun Luofeng\u2019s lips curved up. \u201cI just woke up, so I would naturally be late.\u201dWoke up?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun Luo\u2019s old face burned with embarrassment.

Because of this, it made our Crown Prince wait for so long.\u201dYun Luofeng looked at him: \u201cSleep is a major event in life.

You should understand that your granddaughter\u2019s body has some problems, if there\u2019s no physician to help, she will be a trash all her life.

Then, she will know the suitable remedy!\u2026The dark, humid chamber and moist pavement made Yun Luofeng frown slightly.From the side, Yun Luo did not see her face, so he kept on talking. \u201cOver the years, in order to avoid the eyes and ears of that force, your uncle has been living here.

Yun Luo pressed a switch on the wall, and a bang rang out as the door of the stone chamber opened.The inside was not as wet as the outside. It was clean and elegant and had a sandalwood scent.A man was holding a book in a wheelchair. His mouth faintly curved into a slight arc, and then he slowly raised his head when he heard the doors opening. His cold eyes looked at the old man and young person at the door, and his eyes gradually warmed.A truly elegant, cantabile-like, virtuous, magnificent, and peerless man.After Yun Luofeng saw the man\u2019s stunning appearance, she could not help but sigh; \u201cGrandfather, the people say the Crown Prince Gao Ling is the most beautiful man in Longyuan Kingdom, but I think Second Uncle suits this title more.

I have received orders from the general to protect her, so I naturally would not allow anyone to hurt the young Miss! But how could our Miss handle experiencing this kind of thing? Now her mind has suffered serious trauma. Thus, we are letting the Prime Minister know that our general will come to discuss the matter of compensation later on.\u201dMu Xingchou was angered until old blood almost sprayed out, and he staggered until he had to support himself to keep from falling down.He trembled as he raised his hand, pointing to the mountain-like Jun Family Yun\u2019s guard in front of him, and quivered as he said: \u201cJust you wait\u2014I won\u2019t let this matter drop!\u201dCould these people be any more shameless?His own grandson was beaten, and they want him to offer compensation?Moreover, he doesn\u2019t believe Yun Luofeng was scared silly.

Hmph!\u201dHaving said that, he fiercely flung his robe, turned around with his hand behind his back, and left. Now he needed to go court to see his Majesty.After the guards had sent Mu Shen back to the Prime Minister\u2019s manor, one of them returned to the Yun Family as quickly as possible to report the matter.When Yun Luo heard his subordinate\u2019s report, he froze for a moment, then began to laugh heartily.\u201cHahaha! Good! Very good, that\u2019s my granddaughter! My granddaughter should be this bold, never fearing anyone! But given the character of that old thief Mu Xingchou, he won\u2019t let it go!

This Medical Pavilion not only sells medical herbs of various kinds, but also have very skilled physicians! However, these physicians generally don\u2019t come out to save people. Even if you offer them a million gold, it may still not be possible to get their attention.Yun Luofeng did not hesitate to enter the Medicial Pavilion.Fortunately, those who come to Medical Pavilion are not average people. The guests were busy solving their own problems, so nobody noticed her arrival.\u201cMiss?\u201dAs Yun Luofeng looked around this famous medical court, a man dressed in a blue robe came to her side, and politely said: \u201cExcuse me, did you come to our Medical Pavilion to buy herbs?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun Luofeng nodded her head slightly and took out a piece of paper she had with her: \u201cI want the herbs on this list.

Of those problems not one was challenging or interesting. She couldn\u2019t help but be disappointed. Just when she wanted to turn away, she suddenly caught a glimpse of a problem that made her halt.\u201cI would like to ask, if one was not careful and ingested the Man Luo poison, how can it be treated?\u201dMan Luo poison is from a plant called Man Luo that produced highly toxic flowers. If poisoned, the person will increasingly age until death. Currently in Long Xiao continent, it is indeed difficult to solve the problem of Man Luo poisoning .But\u2026Before she came to buy herbs, she random flicked through some medical books and just so happened to turn to the page about Man Luo poison.Probably on a whim, Yun Luofeng wrote down the detoxification method under the question. Then, she placed the brush in her hand and went toward the center of the big hall.From beginning to end, no one to saw this white clothed girl leaving a few strokes on the paper.\u201cMiss, the herbs you want, I have prepared them for you.\u201dJust when Yun Luofeng reached the middle of the hall, that male individual in blue clothes came in front of her while holding the herbs.

This is the first time she realized that the general manor is so poor.Moreover, these herbs were only enough for her to soak for a day. If she bought enough to last five days, she\u2019s afraid that the general manor\u2019s treasury would not be enough for her to squander.It seems like it\u2019s time for her to make some money \u2026 \u2026\u201cSo the dignified General Manor\u2019s Miss is short on money.\u201dSuddenly, a sarcastic voice came from the Medical Pavilion door.The crowd followed the sound and looked. The first thing that caught their eye was that Mu Wushuang dressed in a goose yellow flannel dress, seeming noble and elegant and whose whole body was covered with endless charm, while those by her side provided a sharp contrast.She is like flower standing among a pile of cow dung, beautiful and delicate, a fragrant scent assailing the nose.The one who opened her mouth to ridicule Yun Luofeng was Mu Wushuang\u2019s little follower, Wu Qi, who stood by her side.After all, toward people like Yun Luofeng, Mu Wushuang always showed disdain and filled with attitude; not opening her proud mouth, even from the door to now, she did not spare Yun Luofeng a glance.Yun Luofeng rubbed her nose. To see Mu Wushuang appearing here, it seems like she didn\u2019t hear the news about her beating Mu Shen\u2026 \u2026\u201cShopkeeper Lin.\u201dMu Wushuang walked around Yun Luofeng, to go to the blue clothed man standing in front of her, changing the previous glamorous elegance to a beautiful face with a touch of chuckle.\u201cIs Elder Rong in today? If he is, then can I trouble Shopkeeper Lin to inform him that Wushuang came to visit.\u201dThis is the Medical Pavilion!Even if the other person is just a small shopkeeper, as the prime minister\u2019s Miss, Mu Wushuang must be polite and did not dare go beyond.Shopkeeper Lin frowned, his face still displayed a polite smile: \u201cSorry ah, Elder Rong has gone on a long journey, and still has not come back. Miss Wushuang please return.\u201dMu Wushuang\u2019s smiling face stiffened. Because she received news that Elder Rong came back, she came to see and did not think that these people, wouldn\u2019t give her face.Even so, if she thought like this, Mu Wushuang\u2019s face still showed the same smile: \u201cIn that case, Wushuang has presumptuously caused a disturbance again. If Elder Rong came back, please inform me soon then Wushuang will carry gifts to call for a visit.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe blue robed man made a please posture, as if Mu Wushuang was definitely going to leave.Mu Wushuang\u2019s stomach simmered with anger that couldn\u2019t come out. But she had to maintain a noble and elegant smile, so when no one saw it, she winked to the follower at her side, Wu Qi.Wu Qi immediately knew what it meant., Looking at Yun Luofeng who had yet to depart, she sneered: \u201cYun Luofeng, what are you freezing there for? Since you can\u2019t take out money to buy medicine, immediately get out! The air in the place our Miss Wushuang appears must be kept fresh, but such good air is polluted by trash like you! \u201dWushuang needed to maintain her image outside.

However she suddenly stiffened, and her expression turned ugly like she ate feces, but didn\u2019t dare to say a word.A man clothed in a brocade costume, looking noble without any comparison, emitted an aura on stage that could not be compared to the aura of a person like Wu Qi. A warm smile was displayed on his face, and a pair of eyes contained a gentle luster.Unparalleled handsomeness, warm like Jade!Suddenly, these (eight) words entered into Yun Luofeng\u2019s mind, making Yun Luofeng unable to help but give another look at the man.Only\u2026This man, even though his face had a smile, that smile did not reach his eyes.

Later you can go get the money from General Manor. However, this price of yours is too expensive, how about \u2026 you gift me those grass plants.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s eyes flashed for a moment, pointing to the corner where green herb grass laid. She made the statement with a smile full of meaning.The blue robed man became stunned for a moment; then he politely smiled: \u201cMiss, these are just one of the most common herb grasses, and are of no real use. If Miss Yun likes, you can take away that corner of herb grass. \u201d\u201cMany thanks.\u201dYun Luofeng didn\u2019t try to be polite; she packaged all of the herb grass and walked back to the door without looking back.Gao ShaoChen watched the girl\u2019s figure disappear and abruptly laughed: \u201cI did not expect for this Yun family\u2019s Yun Luofeng to be bearable unlike what the rumors said. Maybe my brother will lose a treasure.\u201dMu Wushuang stood beside Gao Shaochen. After hearing these words, she felt greatly uncomfortable.What does he mean by the Crown Prince will lose a treasure? Only she is worthy of being the Crown Prince\u2019s woman.

No way, I have to hurry up and find Elder Rong.

His old face was covered with anxiety, while in front of him stood a middle-aged man.Compared to the old man\u2019s anxiety, this middle-aged man\u2019s face was extremely respectful.\u201cStill no one has yet written out the detoxification method for Man Luo poison?\u201dElder Rong placed the cup in his hand down, gently sighing.\u201cElder Rong,\u201d the middle-aged man pondered for a moment and replied, \u201cEven the most powerful physicians of our Medical Pavilion have no idea.

Did someone really write the way of detoxifying the Man Luo flower? Quick! Quickly give that piece of paper to me!\u201d\u201cYes, Elder Rong.\u201dLin Xiao respectfully placed the paper in his hand, and his heart became excited along with Elder Rong\u2019s movements.Elder Rong held his breath, the hand holding the paper trembled: \u201cThat\u2019s right, this is the Man Luo flower detoxification method!

How about bed warming?\u201d Yun Luofeng\u2019s eyes were smiling, her voice bewitchingly seductive, and a hint of teasing lingered on her lips.At present, the young girl was only dressed in a light garment; her exposed snow-white thighs coupled with her bewitching voice could enchant anyone\u2019s heart and soul.

He was gently pursing his lips, and his dark eyes were incomparably clear.Yun Luofeng\u2019s line of sight moved downward little by little until it landed on the eight-pack abs on his torso.

Although he could only stay inside the God Code World, not a single breathing entity would be able to hide their presence from him.\u201cReporting to Master, I\u2019m detecting the presence of three people in this rear mountain. One is your second uncle\u2019s, the other is Yun Xiao\u2019s, and the last one is unknown! However, that person is with Yun Xiao and also doesn\u2019t harbor malicious intentions.\u201dYun Xiao?Yun Luofeng paused. \u201cSince there\u2019s no ill intent, you don\u2019t need to mind him.\u201d\u2026On top of the mountain, overgrown weeds.Yun Xiao watched the grey-robed man kneeling in front of him, his tone unreasonably cold, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that not a single person shall enter Yun Estate without my permission! Did you forget?\u201dSaying this, a domineering aura radiated from Yun Xiao\u2019s body. If Yun Luofeng was here at this moment, she would have discovered that the spirit beasts living on the mountain behind the Yun Estate did not dare to move and were coweringly prostrated on the ground.Lin Qiong wanted to cry but had no tears. He only came to report about a single matter. Who knew he would be subjected to a ruthless pressure from this terrifying man?That was right! Terrifying!In the hearts of these subordinates, the man in front of his eyes was precisely a demon who terrified people. Anyone who offended him would have a fate that was definitely worse than death!\u201cMaster, it\u2019s like this,\u201d Lin Qiong swallowed his saliva, quiveringly replied, \u201crecently, a genius girl appeared in the continent, and that girl admires Master. Moreover, she\u2019s spreading that there\u2019s no one in this world who is more worthy of Master than her, and she even said she can conquer Master. This subordinate is here to ask Master, do we need to deal with this matter?\u201d\u201cKill her.\u201dTwo words, simple and easy to understand, but it also showed this man\u2019s level of cruelty.\u201cAh?\u201dLin Qiong was momentarily frozen. Despite knowing the depth of his master\u2019s viciousness and ruthlessness, he did not think he would make them directly kill her.As though he was very dissatisfied with this one word that Lin Qiong had uttered, the man\u2019s cold eyes focused on him. Just this glance alone already made Lin Qiong shudder from head to toe and hurriedly lower his head.\u201cThis subordinate obeys.\u201dYun Xiao seemed to have thought of something, involuntarily glancing at the single-story house not far away from him.\u201cAlso, send someone to investigate the grudges between Prime Minister Mu Estate and Yun Clan and inform me without omitting a single word!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lin Qiong responded while cupping one fist in the other hand.He really did not understand, why would a superior person like Master escape to an extremely small kingdom like Long Yuan to be the guard of a general\u2019s daughter? Even if it was the Emperor, he still had to kowtow several times whenever he saw Master.Of course, even if Lin Qiong was given 100 guts, he still would not dare to ask this question. He would not survive otherwise!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun Luofeng, who was currently cultivating in the house, was naturally oblivious to everything that was happening outside.

If such talent was revealed, it would definitely stun the entire Long Yuan Kingdom!\u201cWith this last remaining dose of Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid, it looks like I will need to reallocate. Never mind, I will go to the Medical Pavilion to try to see how much this last dose can sell for. A doctor is a profession that burns a lot of money, and merely relying on the 45 million taels that Mu Shen owes me isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Yun Luofeng muttered to herself.She was about to rise from the bathtub when she suddenly discovered a small figure sticking out its tiny butt and licking the bathwater that got splashed on the floor\u2014even the water in the corner was not spared.\u201cXiao Mo, why didn\u2019t you tell me that something came in?\u201d Yun Luofeng stared at the gluttonous little guy and asked with a raised brow.Before long, Xiao Mo\u2019s guilty and defensive voice could be heard from inside her mind.\u201cMaster, this is only a gluttonous gold-seeking hamster, attracted by this Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid. It isn\u2019t harmful to you, so I didn\u2019t inform you.\u201dHe would never tell his own master that this hamster\u2019s presence was too weak, so he overlooked its presence.\u201cGold-seeking hamsters like to eat Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid?\u201dYun Luofeng stared at this snow-white gold-seeking hamster, the glint in her eyes slightly turned a few rounds.\u201cWhat gold-seeking hamster eats isn\u2019t Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid; what it likes to eat are medicinal herbs! Moreover, it relies on medicinal herbs to increase its strength! However, this gold-seeking hamster hasn\u2019t eaten medicinal herbs before, so up until now, its strength is still very low! Master, this time, you found a treasure.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Mo\u2019s voice was very excited, \u201cThe lineage of this gold-seeking hamster is very pure! If you bring it with you, it can help you discover extremely valuable medicinal herbs! Of course, you need to be cautious, the gold-seeking hamster is voracious, so if you let it search for medicinal herbs, it will eat it all!\u201d\u201cThe only ability of gold-seeking hamster is to discover precious medicinal herbs?\u201d\u201cOf course not! Gold-seeking hamster\u2019s own strength is also very strong; its teeth can bite and break the toughest and most durable sword in the world! Its claw can dig through the General Estate within two hours! Because it has a small body and sharp teeth, even if it fights with spirit beasts like jackals and wolves, it still wouldn\u2019t be in a disadvantageous position! The premise is that the gold-seeking hamster is allowed to grow.\u201dXiao Mo became more excited the more he talked, \u201cHowever, if you want to strengthen a gold-seeking hamster, the amount of medicinal herbs that you have to invest will be as high as a mountain! This is also precisely why there aren\u2019t many people on this continent who can successfully nurture powerful gold-seeking hamsters.

It\u2019s difficult for common medicinal herbs to nurture a gold-seeking hamster, but you have spiritual herbs! If you let it use spiritual herbs as food, it will rapidly grow!\u201dIn this continent, the ordinary, younger generation of nobles would tame one or two spirit beasts to be their companions! In the past, it was not that Yun Luofeng did not have that type of notion, but since she did not possess a smidgen of power, even if someone else from the Yun Family tamed the spirit beast for her, there would eventually be a day when that spirit beast would betray her!The gold-seeking hamster, who was happily eating, finally felt her gaze on its body, so it stiffly turned its head little by little. In a split second, it met a pair of nefariously smiling eyes.\u201cSqueak!\u201dThe gold-seeking hamster squealed, and within an instant, it wanted to charge towards the doorway. However, before it could dart out, it was picked up by one hand and placed on the other hand.\u201cSqueak, squeak, squeak!\u201dIn Yun Luofeng\u2019s hand, the gold-seeking hamster struggled twice, and then it bit Yun Luofeng\u2019s fingers. However, Yun Luofeng\u2019s skin did not even break under its assault, and her bewitching eyes were intently staring at it with a faint smile in them.The hamster finally lost all hope and gave up on struggling. Its expression filled with despondency; it could already imagine its miserable shape when it turned into a hamster meal.\u201cLittle guy, how about following me?\u201dJust when the gold-seeking hamster was despondent to the point of being disinclined to budge, Yun Luofeng slowly opened her mouth to ask.The gold-seeking hamster\u2019s expression was revived. It blinked its eyes and blankly watched the exceedingly beautiful girl with her demonic smiling expression.What did she mean by that?It did not have to be turned into a hamster meal?\u201cI know you can understand my words. Follow me and you can have medicine to eat every day. How about it?\u201dIf an average person heard you say that they would have medicine to eat every day if they followed you, then they would certainly give you a round of beating.But the gold-seeking hamster was different!After hearing Yun Luofeng\u2019s words, that pair of pitch black eyes lit up, hurriedly and fiercely nodded its head, and squeaked once.\u201cThen I will give you a name,\u201d Yun Luofeng played with the gold-seeking hamster in her hands, her eyes revealing an evil smiling expression. \u201cSeeing that your color is similar to milk, I will call you Milk Tea from now on.\u201d\u201cSqueak!\u201dThe gold-seeking hamster responded with a sound. As long as there was medicine to eat every day, it did not mind whatever name she gave it.\u201cThis Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid is what was leftover from my use. It is not too useful in increasing your strength. Soon, I will go to the Medical Pavilion to help you buy some herbal ingredients. However\u2014\u201d Yun Luofeng paused, \u201c\u2014when you follow me from here on out, you cannot have any reservations. For instance, when you pick up some medicinal herbs from outside, you must first bring it back to me.\u201dAfter saying these words, Yun Luofeng hid Milk Tea into her sleeve and strode out of the room.Four days!She had been in seclusion for an entire four days.

He has already gathered 45 million taels?\u201d Yun Luofeng lightly touched her chin, saying, \u201cQingyan, I need to go to Medical Pavilion right now. Let him leave the money behind, and as for anything else, let him wait for me in the rear court tomorrow.\u201dIt was already quite late, so she did not have time to pay attention to Mu Shen.Qingyan blankly stared for a moment.

Thus, I can\u2019t let anyone know the one who possesses the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid is me. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid that without waiting for me to become strong, that dog emperor will casually plant a criminal charge to implicate nine of my familial relations.\u201dXiao Mo understood the reason behind Yun Luofeng\u2019s statement, so this time, he did not say anything.After Yun Luofeng left these words behind, she headed towards the boisterous Medical Pavilion\u2026\u201cAh, little sister, did you come to my Medical Pavilion to buy medicinal herbs? Look at this precious appearance, afraid of people seeing it, so even your face isn\u2019t exposed.\u201dJust as Yun Luofeng stepped into the Medical Pavilion, a charming laughter traveled to her.This was a woman with an exceedingly beautiful appearance. Her beauty and Yun Luofeng\u2019s beauty were two kinds of zenith. Yun Luofeng was beautiful enough to be peerless and overturn countries, her bewitching charm and languidness were accompanied by a nobleness that prevented people from daring to approach her.On the other hand, this woman bared her breasts and her stomach, and every frown and every smile had ten thousand types of amorous feelings\u2014as though a single glance could steal someone\u2019s soul away. Let\u2019s not talk about men, even women who heard her beguiling voice would feel their entire body becoming weak and numb, unable to move.Of course, if it was only relying on appearance, then it was definitely Yun Luofeng\u2019s win, however, this woman\u2019s flirtatious behavior was incomparable.\u201cIs Shopkeeper Lin not here?\u201d With a curl of her lips, Yun Luofeng looked at this flirtatious woman walking towards her with her tiny swaying waist.Shopkeeper Lin was Lin Xiao, who had always been welcoming Yun Luofeng. Since receiving the customers of Medical Pavilion had always been carried out by Lin Xiao, this woman did not suspect Yun Luofeng\u2019s words.\u201cHahaha,\u201d the woman charmingly and lightly chuckled, stroking her hair coquettishly as she said, \u201cFor my Medical Pavilion\u2019s improved performance, this period of time, it is I who shall receive all the customers!

However, this medicinal liquid is only useful for those below high-level spirit cultivator. Once the spirit cultivator\u2019s level reaches high-level, it will lose its effectiveness.\u201dThe smile on the woman\u2019s face froze, even her breathing became slightly heavier. \u201cYou are saying this is a Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, and it can help spirit cultivators cultivate?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it indeed has an effect on spirit cultivators below high level. Its specific usage is to mix this Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid with water, then the spirit cultivator soaks in this water while cultivating, and it can help them gather spirit energy.\u201dYun Luofeng nodded, confirming the woman\u2019s question.Following the young girl\u2019s words, the charming look on the woman\u2019s face had completely disappeared and was replaced by a solemn one.\u201cLittle sister, I can\u2019t make the decision for this Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid on my own.

Otherwise, she would face the danger of her identity being exposed.\u201cLittle sister, from now on, if you have any more Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, you can continue to come to my Medical Pavilion to sell it, I will give you an even more reasonable price.\u201d Fang Ya winked at Yun Luofeng, \u201cNow does little sister happen to be free, go out to have dinner with big sister?\u201dA doctor who could take out a Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, she must befriend no matter what.\u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u201dYun Luofeng snatched the bank notes from Fang Ya\u2019s hands and turned around to depart after leaving behind this sentence.Watching the silhouette of her retreating back, Fang Ya smiled helplessly. \u201cWhat a domineering little sister, if this type of people belonged to my Medical Pavilion, then my Medical Pavilion\u2019s strength will become even more formidable.\u201dHaving said that, Fang Ya decided to head towards the inner court, but at this point, her footsteps abruptly halted, and her beautiful eyes widened while looking at one of the questions on the problem-solving wall\u2026\u201cWho answered this question?\u201dThis question was the extremely difficult problem that Elder Rong found earlier for the purpose of baiting the person who resolved the man luo flower poison problem. Therefore, these few days, Fang Ya had been paying attention to this problem, but she did not think that the one time that she left for not too long, the question would have already been answered by someone.Hearing Fang Ya\u2019s words, one of the servants in the Medical Pavilion responded with one sentence: \u201cFang Ya daren, the problem was answered by that veiled girl whom you just received.\u201dThis servant\u2019s position in the Medical Pavilion was not high, so she naturally did not know the importance of this matter. Thus, even though she noticed Yun Luofeng answered the problem, she did not promptly tell Fang Ya.Fang Ya\u2019s body shook once, her heart endlessly regretting even more. If she knew it would be like this earlier, she would have kept that little girl here earlier.Now, in this vast sea of people, where was she supposed to find that person?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026The efficiency of Medical Pavilion\u2019s handling of affairs was extremely high.

If Wushuang likes it, this Crown Prince will buy it for you, how is that?\u201dMu Wushuang hesitated for quite a while before slowly saying, \u201cCrown Prince Your Highness, I heard General Yun also wants to buy that Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid. He is currently borrowing money everywhere. The Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid is too expensive. If Yun Luofeng can cultivate, yielding to her is of no consequence, but the problem is that she can\u2019t even become a spirit cultivator, so what is the use of wanting that Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid? Wouldn\u2019t that be such a waste?\u201d\u201cWushuang, rest assure that I will issue an order to the ministers of Long Yuan Kingdom later that no one is allowed to lend money to the General Estate!

When that time comes, I will also need Crown Prince to help me.\u201dJust thinking of that peerlessly beautiful face, Mu Wushuang hated it so much that she bit her lips and gritted her teeth in anger!

At that moment, when Gao Ling was not looking, her pair of eyes flashed with malice.Yun Luofeng, you will always be inferior to me!Your innate skill is inferior to mine, your ability is inferior to mine, even your ability to control men is also inferior to mine! In this lifetime, I will live auspiciously, living a life that everyone will envy, while you only deserve to stand at the lowest point, looking up at my existence!The one whom I will marry will be the noblest in the world, while you actually need me to pick a husband for you!As for the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, I must also obtain it!

Yesterday, Mu Shen sent me 45 million taels, so I already had her bring it to the treasury to replenish it.\u201dAn odd silence dawned.Following Yun Luofeng\u2019s words, the grim atmosphere in the study abruptly settled. Yun Luo stared unwaveringly at the young girl in front of him, even his breathing became ragged.\u201cFeng\u2019er, can you explain to me what this matter is all about?\u201dNo one knew of the incessant tempestuous emotion in the old man\u2019s heart. He had to use all of his strength to suppress his heart from almost jumping out. Despite this, his shaking body still betrayed his internal turmoil.\u201cGrandfather,\u201d Yun Luofeng lifted her head, staring at the old man\u2019s twitching, aged face. Her face did not have her usual bewitching charm and was replaced with solemnity. \u201cMy parents\u2019 enmities, I will definitely avenge them!

From now on, she would make the Prime Minister Estate gradually decline and would also stomp the imperial power underneath her foot.Of course, to prevent frightening this old man, Yun Luofeng did not speak this sentence out loud.\u201cHahaha!\u201d the old man was stunned for a long while, and then he wildly guffawed.How many years? How many years had it been since he was this smooth and unhindered? Ever since Feng\u2019er\u2019s parents died, he had been continually living within this stifling oppression! Now, his own precious granddaughter had actually mercilessly swindled the Prime Minister Estate. If the Prime Minister knew, he would definitely be angered to half death!Yun Luofeng shrugged, \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me what are you borrowing money for?\u201dHearing this, the old man\u2019s expression suddenly became grave. \u201cPrecious granddaughter, you still didn\u2019t know? Recently, a dose of Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid appeared at the Medical Pavilion. Just this single dose has so many nobles and aristocrats wanting to buy it. Of course, Grandfather is unwilling to fall behind, and this is why Grandfather is currently going everywhere to borrow money to buy this Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid.\u201dSpirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid?Yun Luofeng was stunned. She did not think that her grandfather was actually borrowing money to help her buy a dose of Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid.In that moment, a thread of warmth spread through her heart.\u201cI don\u2019t need that Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid.\u201dLooking at the expression of the old man while talking about the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, Yun Luofeng deliberated for a bit before deciding against informing this old man for now lest the old man\u2019s heart could not bear this kind of stimulation.\u201cYou silly girl, what nonsense are you saying? Our family has this much money now, so I will obtain this Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid no matter what!\u201d Yun Luo glared at Yun Luofeng and unhappily stated.Yun Luofeng helplessly smiled.

He did not think that it would be different with Godly Doctor undertaking this task and actually only needed one day! Thinking of this, his mood instantly turned feverish, and he hurriedly entered the room.\u2026For a long time, the Medical Pavilion\u2019s front yard was as busy as a marketplace. High-ranking ministers and nobles of Long Yuan Kingdom all blocked the entrance of the Medical Pavilion, causing the guards inside the Medical Pavilion to rush out to maintain order.\u201cGeneral Yun, you actually really came here! I heard your Yun Clan\u2019s savings have already been completely squandered away by Yun Luofeng. It even led to you being angered to insanity by her. In the end, you still have the nerve to come to Medical Pavilion. Haha, I say, you are just wasting your strength. Buying a Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid for Yun Luofeng would only be a waste!\u201dAmidst the crowd, a sharp-eyed unknown person spotted Yun Luo and could not resist laughing out loud.Yun Luo\u2019s expression was unsightly, but he stood still without making a sound.Although Yun Luofeng already made him give up on the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, he really could not reconcile to that! What\u2019s more, his granddaughter now had such a fearsome innate skill, and if you added the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, it would definitely be twice the effect with half the effort!Unfortunately, Yun Luofeng did not think Yun Luo would still be this stubborn. Otherwise, perhaps she would have said something about the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid\u2026\u201cWith my mandate, there won\u2019t be anyone lending money to General Yun. Only, I don\u2019t know why would General Yun still come here?\u201dCrown Prince Gao Lin looked at Yun Luo, his eyes slightly sinking, the bottom of his eyes flashing with a fierce light. He turned to look at the young lady in yellow clothes beside him and asked tenderly, \u201cWushuang, your complexion today doesn\u2019t look so good, did something happen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMu Wushuang shook her head lightly, her eyelids drooping.She did not tell His Highness the Crown Prince that just this morning, her grandfather, Prime Minister Mu, originally wanted to use the treasury\u2019s money to buy the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid for her.

It\u2019s just that last night, I didn\u2019t sleep at all because I was choosing an excellent husband for Yun Luofeng, so now, I am slightly fatigued. Also, I\u2019m worried that Yun Luofeng\u2019s standards are too high and afraid that she won\u2019t accept the husband that I chose for her.\u201dOf course, Mu Wushuang would not tell Crown Prince what occurred at the Prime Minister Estate, so she naturally pushed everything onto Yun Luofeng.After Gao Ling heard Mu Wushuang\u2019s words, his complexion darkened a few degrees. \u201cYou are worrying and working yourself to exhaustion because of her, she would not dare to be this ungrateful. Being a mere trash, what right does she have to have high standards? Wushuang, I believe in your ability, so after you choose a suitable candidate, I will let Father Emperor announce an imperial decree to bestow marriage. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to abide, she must abide!\u201dAs a trash, how could she have the right to be picky? It\u2019s already quite good that someone was willing to marry her. If it weren\u2019t for Wushuang making a decision on this matter for her, in this current world, who would be willing to take a trash for a wife?While Gao Lin and Mu Wushuang conversed, he did not forget to give a few eye signal toward a few people present, indicating for them to continue making things difficult for Yun Luo.Ordinarily, with Yun Luo\u2019s strength and status, they would not dare to go overboard, but after receiving His Highness the Crown Prince\u2019s hint, all of them stood forward in order to ingratiate themselves with the future ruler of the kingdom and wore a righteous expression to face Yun Luo.\u201cGeneral Yun, I say, you are really not too generous, using the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid on Yun Luofeng the trash is simply a waste! It\u2019s better to leave it to those who need it! So I urge you to give up on competing with us!\u201dIn Long Yuan Kingdom, besides the high-ranking officials and nobles, there were still four major clans. Surprisingly, the person who said these words was Lin Ying, the family head of Lin Clan from the four major clans!\u201cBullshit, you\u2014who did you f*cking say is trash?\u201d Yun Luo was so angry that his beard erratically shook, both of his eyes were glaring ferociously at Lin Ying. \u201cMy granddaughter is more outstanding than anyone. Whoever says this general\u2019s granddaughter is trash again, this general will make them get lost from here!\u201dLin Ying was startled by this old man\u2019s imposing aura but remembered that Crown Prince was present, so this old man would not dare to be impudent. Thus, he mustered up his courage to say: \u201cGeneral Yun, is this you becoming mad from shame, or is it because I touched a sore spot? Haha, who doesn\u2019t know that Long Yuan Kingdom\u2019s number one genius belongs to His Highness the Crown Prince, and Prime Minister Estate\u2019s Mu Wushuang\u2019s innate skill is also on par with Crown Prince.

The Medical Pavilion kept a record of the medicinal herbs it sold. As a result, yesterday, after she sold the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, it was inconvenient for her to continue buying medicinal herbs. Otherwise, her identity would be discovered from the medicinal herbs that she normally purchased.\u201cGeneral Yun, I can see that your granddaughter is actually more sensible. She knows that she is a trash and that using the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid on her will only be a waste. You should go back to rest instead. Why waste money?\u201d Lin Ying loudly laughed twice, his disdainful and contemptuous glance sweeping across Yun Luofeng\u2019s absolutely gorgeous countenance.What use was it for a woman to be this beautiful?

She walked over to Yun Luo\u2019s side, wickedly raising the corner of her lips. \u201cA dose of Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid\u2019s price is 20 million gold coins. It is too expensive. If you want to buy this Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, then we will suffer a huge loss of money, so go back first and wait for me, and I will give you a surprise.\u201dAfter she gave it a thought, Yun Luofeng decided to disclose the matter of the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid. Even if this old guy could not handle it, it was still better than him paying this much to buy the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid.\u201cHehe,\u201d Gao Ling evidently heard Yun Luofeng\u2019s voice and chuckled in derision. \u201cYun Luofeng, after you unsuccessfully committed suicide, even though you are not as irritating as before, you are too arrogant! You actually said buying the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid for 20 million is too expensive? And even suffer a big loss? Let me tell you, even if it is 30 million taels, there would still be someone willing to buy it. Only an ignorant person like you would deem the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid too expensive.\u201dAs though Yun Luofeng did not hear Gao Ling\u2019s words, she nonchalantly walked into the Medical Pavilion.Yun Luofeng, who was walking ahead, did not notice that before Fang Ya left, she glanced at Gao Ling as though he was an idiot.\u201cYour Highness the Crown Prince!\u201dAfter seeing his own granddaughter leave, Yun Luo\u2019s complexion darkened. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know why the ministers of the imperial court weren\u2019t willing to lend me money!

I heard that the Medical Pavilion\u2019s Elder Rong is very haughty and might not even receive those royals and nobles who come to visit. I don\u2019t understand why he wants to see me now.\u201d\u201cMiss Yun, you will understand if you follow me.\u201d\u2026Inner Court.Elder Rong held the teacup gently in his hands, telling the middle-aged man beside him, \u201cIt looks like the commotion that this Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid produced is tremendous. It\u2019s a shame that there is only one dose of this. Right, Mu Rong, has there been any news about the person that I had you locate?\u201dMu Rong\u2019s face displayed helplessness. \u201cAt present, we only know two special features about that mysterious doctor. First, according to Miss Fang, that mysterious person is a young woman; second, that woman was dressed in white. However, in this vast sea of people, I am afraid finding someone based on these two conditions is extremely difficult.\u201d\u201cEven if you can\u2019t find her, you must find her! Even if it means mobilizing all the power of Medical Pavilion!\u201dThe whereabouts of this mysterious doctor involved the survival of the entire Medical Pavilion, so he must find her!Knock knock knock!A series of knocking sounds came from outside the door. Without waiting for Elder Rong to inquire out loud, Fang Ya\u2019s seductive-to-the-bone voice came from outside the room, \u201cElder Rong, I have already found the doctor who solved the manluo flower poison.\u201dElder Rong\u2019s hands trembled, nearly dropping the tea in his hands to the floor. He noisily stood up from the chair; his excessive excitement led his voice to falter.\u201cMake her come in quickly.\u201dAs soon as his words faded, the room\u2019s door was pushed open. The charming, red-clothed Fang Ya first entered the room, and closely following behind Fang Ya was a body clad in snow-like white robe entered Elder Rong\u2019s eyes.The young lady was born extremely beautiful. Her skin was white like jade, a peerless and city-ruining beauty. Wicked yet languid, her brows revealed an inherent haughty dominance, not allowing anyone to ignore.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYun Luofeng?\u201dAs the number one trash, it was impossible for Mu Rong not to have heard of Yun Luofeng\u2019s name. Currently, seeing that the person who Fang Ya had found was her, the astonishment in his heart could be imagined.Only, for reasons unknown, the current Yun Luofeng seemed to be quite different from the one he saw in the past\u2026\u201cAre you the doctor who solved the manluo flower poison?\u201dElder Rong\u2019s eyes flickered with surprise. His shock was not because of Yun Luofeng\u2019s identity of course! Rather it was because despite already knowing that this mysterious doctor was very young, he did not expect that it would be this young.

I still have other things to do. If you want to find me to treat an illness, I won\u2019t treat without 50 million taels.\u201dWhat is called arrogant and confident?At present, Yun Luofeng thoroughly spelled it out, even causing Mu Rong, who originally wanted to explain Yun Luofeng\u2019s identity to Elder Rong, to freeze in his spot.\u201cIf you can really detoxify the manluo flower poison, don\u2019t talk about 50 million taels, even if you want 100 million, we will still give it to you.\u201d Elder Rong seriously regarded Yun Luofeng.As far as Fang Ya was concerned, he was very confident. If it was Fang Ya who found the person, there should not be a mistake!\u201cHmm,\u201d Yun Luofeng touched her chin, lazily smiling, \u201cYour Medical Pavilion is quite generous. If I don\u2019t accept your 100 million, then I would let you down. Let\u2019s do it this way, I will detoxify the manluo flower poison, and you will give me 100 million taels! Additionally, I want to change the division of earnings for the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid. The selling price of one dose of Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid\u2019s is 20 million, I\u2019ll take 19 million of it.\u201dElder Rong was stunned.He had just casually mentioned 100 million in passing, but this girl had really bluntly raised the price?Hold on!Suddenly, Elder Rong regained his senses, his astonished eyes staring at Yun Luofeng. \u201cWhat did your words mean? You said the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid is yours? Do you possess other Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid as well?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201d Fang Ya couldn\u2019t resist laughing. \u201cElder Rong, I forgot to inform you, the genius who answered that eternally difficult problem and the seller of the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid is the same person; they are both this girl!\u201dElder Rong\u2019s entire body trembled, his eyes filling with disbelief.He didn\u2019t expect that a thing like the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid would come from the hands of a 14-year-old little girl.\u201cGirl, if you can cure the manluo flower poison, we will agree to any request of yours!\u201dDuring this period of time, it was not like Elder Rong had not attempted to detoxify the poison himself, but it was to no avail. There are some points in the solution that he could not figure out. Thus, this detoxification process must be carried out by Yun Luofeng herself.\u201cOkay,\u201d Yun Luofeng glanced at Elder Rong, \u201cOnly I don\u2019t want too many people to know this matter! When it\u2019s time to detoxify, you can send someone to Yun residence to find me.\u201dElder Rong\u2019s eyes sparkled a few times. \u201cGirl, can I ask you one last question, where did you learn from?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my master, the old man, doesn\u2019t like to let his existence be known by other people, so I won\u2019t answer this question.\u201dYun Luofeng yawned, slowly standing up straight. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything else, then I will go first. As for the other Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, I will bring it to the Medical Pavilion later\u2026\u201dAs her words ended, Yun Luofeng turned around, intending to leave. When she walked to the room\u2019s entrance, she paused and said without turning her head, \u201cRight, Fang Ya, I\u2019ll trouble you to send me the medicinal herbs that I need to the General Estate later.\u201dWith that, she departed without consulting anyone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMu Rong, what is the identity of this Yun Luofeng?\u201dWatching the young lady\u2019s retreating figure, Elder Rong asked, lost in thought.\u201cElder Rong, this Yun Luofeng is the General Estate\u2019s only child but was born with a trash disposition, unable to cultivate.

Much more now that she possesses something like the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid! Yesterday I analyzed it for a night, and I still wasn\u2019t able to decipher the formula of the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid! If this incident was spread out, I gather that Crown Prince will cry and beg for her forgiveness.\u201dHaha!Fang Ya could not resist and laughed out loud. \u201cElder Rong, you know, just now, Crown Prince was still ridiculing Yun Luofeng for being ignorant and unqualified for using such thing like the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid. I would really want to see his expression later. I\u2019m certain it will be incredibly brilliant.\u201d\u201cHe really said that?\u201d Elder Rong was very surprised. He was silent for a moment and said, \u201cI previously met Crown Prince and even thought he was a worthy figure, but looking at it now, this Crown Prince is only so-so!

From this, I can infer that her master must be that person!\u201d Elder Rong slightly narrowed his eyes. \u201cThat man\u2019s medical skills are superb and has an eccentric temper. If Yun Luofeng is indeed his disciple, then we definitely cannot offend her!\u201dFang Ya was stunned for a moment. \u201cElder Rong, you said that Yun Luofeng is that Godly Doctor\u2019s disciple?\u201d\u201cI am not quite sure, but besides him, who in this world can teach this kind of disciple? When Daren was afflicted with the manluo flower poison, I originally wanted to request that Godly Doctor to treat him but was refused by him! If Yun Luofeng can really treat Daren, I dare to guarantee that she is that Godly Doctor\u2019s disciple!\u201dElder Rong lifted his head to look at Fang Ya, and seriously ordered, \u201cFang Ya, now that I have the detoxification solution, I must return at once. I will leave the matters on this side to you. Remember, you must ingratiate yourself with Yun Luofeng!

Why didn\u2019t you allow me to compete for the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid?

What\u2019s more, when he went to compete for the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid today, he was even subjected to a series of humiliation! What he did not expect was for this medicinal liquid to come from the hands of his own granddaughter.This type of extreme surprise caused his heart to quiver a bit, his entire body was a bit unsteady, nearly toppling to the ground.\u201cI was afraid that you would turn like this, which is why I chose to temporarily hide the matter about the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid. I didn\u2019t think that you would be such a spendthrift and actually want to spend twice the price to buy the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid back,\u201d Yun Luofeng shook her head, lightly sighing once more. \u201cSpeaking of which, Grandfather, your strength is currently at high-level low-rank spirit cultivator, right?\u201dThe old man\u2019s emotions gradually calmed down. After hearing Yun Luofeng\u2019s words, he nodded; his head was still slightly dizzy.\u201cI feel that you are on the verge of breaking through.\u201d Yun Luofeng caressed her chin. She appeared to be afraid that the old man had not received quite a shock as it was and added, \u201cGrandfather, do you still remember the master that I mentioned to you before?

For those whose heart\u2019s fortitude was weaker, it was likely that he would directly faint.\u201cYou stinky girl, are you genuinely creating troubles for this old man. You want to shock this old guy to death, right?\u201d Yun Luo had finally relaxed. When he opened his mouth, his first sentence was to fiercely admonish Yun Luofeng, \u201cFrom now on, you will tell me these matters one by one. Don\u2019t f*cking squeeze two surprises together. Not being frightened to death by you, this old guy is already incredibly fortunate.\u201dYun Luofeng smiled wickedly. \u201cI\u2019m merely worried about shocking you again when I raise your strength later, so I directly said these two things together.\u201d\u201cFeng\u2019er, is what you said real?

He deliberately divulged the war intelligence of the parents of Yun family\u2019s eldest miss to the enemy kingdom, causing the death of both of Eldest Miss Yun\u2019s parents. The other matter was when the Yun Family\u2019s second master, Yun Qingya, was once grievously wounded, General Yun headed to the Imperial Palace to request the imperial doctor to help but was stopped by Mu Wushuang\u2019s master, Jing Lin, leading to Yun Qingya\u2019s death!\u201dYun Xiao did not speak.However, by then, Lin Qiong clearly felt the surrounding air tense up, even the pressure on his own body became much heavier.\u201cThirdly\u2026\u201d Lin Qiong swallowed a mouthful of saliva. \u201cEldest Miss Yun was previously engaged to the Crown Prince, it\u2019s just that the Crown Prince had his heart set towards Mu Wushuang. Moreover, not long ago, that Mu Wushuang had secretly given an idea for the Crown Prince to frame Yun\u2019s eldest miss into forcibly grabbing a pretty boy in public, causing Eldest Miss Yun to lose her reputation and cause her near death! However, even the Crown Prince is not aware that this idea was suggested by Mu Wushuang, and was just borrowing someone else\u2019s mouth to convey it to him. These are just the three important points, and these past few days, this subordinate also discovered many instances wherein Mu family had bullied Eldest Miss Yun\u2026\u201dBy now, Lin Xiong had finally understood how special Yun Luofeng was to Yun Xiao; if he wanted to win the favor of his master, then he just needed to follow Yun Luofeng. Thus, these past few days, he made a thorough investigation.From grievances of the past generation to the Prime Minister Estate\u2019s humiliation towards Yun Luofeng, even if it was only one word or minutia, he respectfully reported all of it.After he reported everything from his investigation to Yun Xiao, Lin Xiong fawningly asked, \u201cMaster, do I need to set the entire estate of Prime Minister Mu on fire? While I\u2019m at it, I could also wipe out the imperial clan. It\u2019s their own fault for joining forces with Mu family to bully Eldest Miss Yun!\u201dFrom Yun Xiao\u2019s motionless face, Lin Xiong had difficulties seeing his emotions.However, Lin Xiong could feel the temper of his master!The best evidence was the pressure on his body becoming stronger, even the surrounding air thickened, causing people to be unable to breathe.Lin Xiong had actually wanted to cry. He was just telling the news, so was it necessary for Master to frighten him like this? As expected, people who can converse with Master must have a very strong psychological fortitude; otherwise, he could frighten you silly.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like others meddling with her affairs.\u201dUnder Lin Xiong\u2019s frightened mental state, Yun Xiao finally opened his mouth, his voice was cold as usual.Vengeance! Only by personally exacting revenge could one be most satisfied!\u201cSo, it\u2019ll be alright as long as those from Prime Minister Mu\u2019s estate do not die.\u201dStill, this didn\u2019t mean he would be willing to repress his anger.Lin Xiong was startled. Master\u2019s meaning was: as long as they didn\u2019t die, they could mistreat the people of Prime Minister Estate however they want?\u201cYes, this subordinate will do as you bid!\u201dLin Xiong respectfully cupped his fists, his eyes shining.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis time, he must perform exceptionally!

The money that they lost was actually stolen by Mu Shen, He also used that money to buy a ginseng from a traveling merchant that could allegedly extend one\u2019s lifespan.

They estimated that he would be unable to leave the bed for at least three months\u2026When Gao Tu heard this news, his royal bearing was incredibly furious. He was determined to find the thief. This hubbub caused everyone in the Imperial City to feel insecure. The wealthy and the powerful were afraid of being visited by the thief, and the powerless were afraid of being framed as the thief!However, these people were very clearly overthinking. A thief that could come and go freely within the Prime Minister Estate and could also cause such a huge disturbance would certainly not be ordinary! They would never find the thief in the common mass.When these two pieces of news traveled to Yun Luofeng\u2019s ears, she raised her brow. \u201cMu Shen hasn\u2019t sold me out?\u201dShe did not expect that Mu Shen, this guy, would actually abide by his promise to this degree. Despite being beaten half to death, he still would not disclose the actual destination of the 45 million and had even made up some lies.The traveling merchant did not exist, so no matter how hard the Prime Minister Estate tried to find them, it would be useless. Moreover, Mu Xingchou was currently lying in bed, so how could they find the time to search for the traveling merchant that came from Mu Shen\u2019s mouth?\u201cMiss, I do quite respect the thief that visited the Prime Minister Mu Estate,\u201d Qingyan reverently said. \u201cWho let those people constantly bully Miss? This time, that chivalrous thief helped us vent our anger.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to revere that thief.\u201d Yun Luofeng squeezed Qingyan\u2019s cheeks, saying wickedly, \u201cYou only need to worship me.\u201d\u201cMiss!\u201dQingyan stomped her feet, saying with a playful pout. \u201cHowever, Miss really has changed a lot now, so why do those people keep calling Miss good-for-nothing!

Yesterday, grandfather finished recruiting these people for me, I should now go look at the candidates.\u201dIn the middle of the courtyard, there stood hundreds of people. Those people were basically half-males and half females and were currently looking around.

It can even be said that it could not be any lower, and it was only marginally better than previous useless Yun Luofeng!

By then, if you train an army there, then no one will take notice.\u201dYun Luofeng grew quiet.The Yun residence\u2019s stone room was humongous, but her recruits were also quite numerous! If she squeezed them in the stone room, they simply had no way to spread out and train! But if they trained in the Yun residence\u2019s courtyard, they could be easily discovered, and the news would spread around. That would be extremely disadvantageous for the Yun Family.\u201cMaster, the spiritual herbs have already been successfully grown.

She has nothing but a pretty face, how could she possibly be worthy of us?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that simple!\u201dAs soon as Xiaoju, the maidservant behind Mu Wushuang, heard these words, she stood out and said, \u201cYun Luofeng relies on the fact that she is Old General\u2019s granddaughter and has always tyrannically abused her power. With Old General here, it is impossible to have her be a concubine. Old General is already advanced in age; he won\u2019t live for long. After Old General dies, then demote her to a concubine, and no one will be able to protect her at that time.\u201d\u201cXiaoju!\u201d Mu Wushuang\u2019s expression darkened and insincerely rebuked her, \u201cWho allowed you to cut in? Retreat!\u201d\u201cMiss,\u201d Xiaoju defended herself, feeling wronged, \u201cthis servant only wants to hold justice for Miss. First, Yun Luofeng monopolizes Your Highness the Crown Prince and wouldn\u2019t let go. Now she turns up at our Prime Minister Estate and demands Miss to find a husband for her, otherwise, she will keep pestering Crown Prince! If she really wants to pester Crown Prince, Old General will definitely protect her. At that time, not only will His Highness be in a difficult position, even His Majesty will also be put in a difficult position.\u201dMu Wushang\u2019s expression changed, her voice was several degrees more severe. \u201cXiaoju! I already told you, you can\u2019t let anyone know about this matter! Could it be that you forget!\u201dAt the same time, in another private room on the luxurious ship, the gentle jade-like fourth prince, Gao Shaochen, heard the theatrical double act performed by this pair of master and servant inside the ship lounge and couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cLooks like the foresight of this royal brother of mine isn\u2019t that great. He can\u2019t even see this double act.\u201d He shook his head and his gaze contained a fox-like roguish delight. \u201cOn the contrary, Yun Luofeng is not as simple as she appears. I am quite curious what kind of character she is \u2026\u201dIndeed, just like what Gao Shaochen had pointed out, Gao Ling could not tell the double act performed by this pair of master and servant. Seeing that Mu Wushuang was still speaking up for Yun Luofeng, his handsome complexion could not help but darken by a few degrees.\u201cWushuang, when you proposed choosing a husband for Yun Luofeng that day, it wasn\u2019t of your own accord? You were just forced by Yun Luofeng, that trash?\u201d Gao Ling\u2019s gaze flared, staring coldly at Mu Wushuang. \u201cYou even said before that you were afraid of Yun Luofeng not complying with this marriage, so I even intended to find Father Emperor to issue a decree. Unexpectedly, the marriage was put forward by herself!\u201dMu Wushuang chuckled bitterly. \u201cYour Highness, Wushuang has no other options. Moreover, Yun Luofeng truly has extremely high standards. She might not be satisfied with the husband that I find for her.\u201d\u201cJust based on her qualification?\u201d Gao Ling sneered, the disdain in his eyes much more pronounced. \u201cWhat qualifications does she have to have high standards! Wushuang, since she spoke about this to you, this Crown Prince will help you with this matter. Such being the case, the husband that this Crown Prince finds for her, she has to marry even if she doesn\u2019t want to! What Xiaoju said was correct\u2014she relies on Old General to tyrannically abuse her power. When that old man dies, no one will protect her, and one can demote her to a concubine!\u201dEveryone speechlessly looked at each other, and they all momentarily grew silent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough Yun Luofeng was a trash, her appearance was rather appealing. If it was taking her as a concubine, many people would not be hard-pressed to do so.When taking a wife, they look at prestige and innate talent; taking a concubine, however, they only have to be comely like flowers!\u201cLooks like today\u2019s banquet is very lively.\u201dSuddenly, a languid voice came from outside the ship door, drawing everyone\u2019s gaze.Under the sunset sky, the young girl\u2019s body leaned against the door.

She carefully opened the parcel, taking out a sparkling, shiny silver needle from the inside.Her fingertips softly pinched the silver needle and aimed the needlepoint at the elderly person\u2019s baihui 1 acupuncture point, slowly pushing the silver needle into the head of the old man. Following the appearance of silver needle, Yun Luofeng\u2019s expression changed from its previous laziness into something particularly imposing.No one saw that after the needle entered the elderly person\u2019s baihui point, a white spiritual energy trailed from the needle and gradually flow into the body of the elder.According to the record of the Medical God Code, when doctors treated someone, they could combine medical skills and spiritual energy, and it would achieve half the work with twice the effect.

Otherwise, this old man will take it up with the Crown Prince Estate tomorrow!\u201d His tone carried rebuke, but Yun Luofeng still heard the concern and indulgence in it.Her heart could not help but feel warm. \u201cI already said that I, Yun Luofeng, am never a person that will be at a disadvantage\u2014I\u2019ll be the one to make other people suffer! This time, not only did I not let other people bully me, I even made Crown Prince personally raise his hand against Mu Wushuang.\u201dYun Luo stared at his own granddaughter in surprise. \u201cDid you say that Crown Prince hit Mu Wushuang? That\u2019s impossible! Considering the Crown Prince\u2019s affection for Mu Wushuang, how could he possibly hit her?Yun Luofeng shrugged, recounting everything that transpired today to Yun Luo one by one.\u201cCrown Prince lost a wager with me, so he was just fulfilling the agreement. But there\u2019s one thing that you need to be prepared for! From now on, I reckon there will be a lot of people paying a visit here. But I won\u2019t be meeting any of these visitors.\u201dOriginally, Yun Luofeng did not plan to expose her medical skills so soon. She only did it to teach Mu Wushuang a lesson! Therefore, she could just imagine that once her medical skill went in public, she\u2019s afraid that the General Estate would not be peaceful anymore.Yun Luo was dumbfounded. A moment later, he burst out hearty laughter; that laughter was filled with delight.\u201cHahaha, great, you\u2019re worthy of being my good granddaughter. You did well! Let\u2019s see how the people from Prime Minister Mu Estate will be able to shoot their mouths off in front of us in the future! Especially Jing Lin, didn\u2019t he say that without his aid, you can only be a trash all your life? His face was slapped this time around, right? I will see what kind of face he\u2019ll use to confront the world from here on out!\u201dYun Luofeng gazed at Yun Luo, who was delightedly laughing to his heart\u2019s content, her mood unconsciously improving a lot as well.\u201cI will slowly pay back what Mu Family owes us in those years little by little!\u201d Her voice was incomparably resolute, her features haughty. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, this time, I didn\u2019t let Crown Prince have an easy time either! Wait until tomorrow, Crown Prince will get a sudden illness. Besides me, no one else can cure him it!\u201dFor what reason did she attend the banquet? Was it just to deliver herself to their doorstep to be humiliated?Of course not!In fact, she made enough preparations before heading out to the banquet! It was for the purpose of pulling one over on the Crown Prince! Thus, when the Crown Prince was not paying attention, she sprinkled Spirit-dispersing Powder on his body.As the name implied, this Spirit-dispersing Powder could make a spirit cultivator lose their spiritual energy. To someone like the Crown Prince, losing his spiritual energy is more painful than letting him die!Yun Luo\u2019s expression became even more astonished, but he did not think that his granddaughter did something wrong.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne has to know how the Crown Prince had humiliated her over these past years, and he even nearly hounded her to death! Her vengeance had also become a matter of course.\u201cYou wench\u2026\u201d Yun Luo smiled wryly, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you mention earlier that you had a plan? You caused me to worry about you for so long. It\u2019s late now, you should also go back to retire early.\u201dYun Luofeng lazily stretched. \u201cIn the future, you don\u2019t have to worry about me for things like this because I will never let myself suffer!\u201dUnder the night sky, the Yun residence was very peaceful; revealing an odd atmosphere everywhere.Only when Yun Luofeng left the hall did she suddenly realize what was strange about the present Yun residence!

Currently, the man\u2019s back was facing the moonlight, a black, sturdy robe visibly highlighted his perfect physique. His facial features were very refined, and his pitch-black eyes\u2014akin to the deep, dark night\u2014were staring without blinking at Yun Luofeng, who was pushing the door to enter.\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was gruff and magnetic, as though it was a magnet easily drawing in other people\u2019s hearts.\u201cYes?\u201d Yun Luofeng lifted her eyebrows slightly. \u201cWere you looking for me?\u201dThe man gazed intently at Yun Luofeng, his cold and unmoving face was devoid of emotions.\u201cI have a book with me and came to look for you so we can study it together.\u201dYun Luofeng raised her eyebrows yet again, her sight gradually landing on the yellow book that was clasped in the man\u2019s hand.Chungong Tu?The young girl\u2019s utterly beautiful face displayed a streak of astonishment, and then she looked up, her eyes intently staring at the man in front of her.\u201cYun Xiao, are you doing this on purpose?\u201dIf a man holding Chungong Tu came barging into your room, saying he wanted to study it with you, you would also have indecent thoughts, even if your previous impression of this man was that of an extremely pure and innocent person.Yun Xiao was perplexed and could not understand why she would get this vexed after looking at this book. However, Yun Xiao was very honest and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s indeed my intention.\u201dLin Qiong told him that Chungong Tu could only be studied by two people together, so he really did intentionally wait for her here.No matter how Yun Xiao thought about it, he would not have thought that Lin Qiong, as his subordinate, would have the nerve to trick him!\u201cYun Xiao!\u201dYun Luofeng chuckled. Pushing the man\u2019s body towards the corner of the wall, her eyes revealed a streak of dangerous light. \u201cDo you know what kind of book you\u2019re holding? And you brought it so we can study it together?\u201dYun Xiao frowned, his heart finally sensing that something was amiss. \u201cIt was Lin Qiong.

She already guessed that Yun Xiao\u2019s identity was anything but ordinary, but since Xiao Mo told her that Yun Xiao completely lacked malice towards her, she did not investigate his identity.\u201cWill you believe anything that other people tell you?\u201dYun Luofeng narrowed her eyes, her body pressing tightly against Yun Xiao to the extent that Yun Xiao did not even dare to move the slightest bit. Otherwise, he would feel his whole body becoming incomparably hot and dry. It was an intriguing feeling that he had never experienced before\u2026\u201cYun Xiao, I have a question for you.

The positions illustrated in Chungong Tu were incredibly graphic, so how could he not understand?Lin Qiong!A wave of fury rushed forth from Yun Xiao\u2019s heart as he tightened his grip on the yellow book in his hand.Lin Qiong had actually brought him this type of thing! More importantly, he even opened it in front of Yun Luofeng\u2026The unfortunate Lin Qiong was still unaware that his own master was harboring a grudge against him!

Her expression was akin to appreciating a piece of perfect artwork.Just now, the proximity between the two was very close. Yun Xiao could smell the faint fragrance coming from the girl in front of him. A current of strange impulse zinged his heart, making his body burned and feverish. He did not know why would the illustrations of the intertwined man and woman that he just saw would suddenly leap into his mind.\u201cDo you want to study Chungong Tu with me?\u201dYun Luofeng\u2019s voice was the last straw that overwhelmed him.

Fortunately, Yun Luofeng did not torment him this time.

Splashes of water splattered everywhere, spraying on the man\u2019s perfect figure.The man submerged his entire body into the cold water, and the feverish heat in his body gradually receded. After waiting for his body to recover, he leaped out from the lake, standing on the ground.His long black robe was soaked from the water, sticking tightly on his body, abdominal muscles were also exposed in the moonlight.The man\u2019s hair was drenched as well. Water droplets followed the perfect contour of his face and unhurriedly cascaded downwards. If any woman saw this sexy and tempting scene, she would definitely succumb to his charm from then on.Back facing the boundless, black night, he said, \u201cLin Qiong, increase your punishment.\u201dNo one saw a faint shadow cupping his hands in salute at the man, and then disappearing into the night sky.Yun Xiao was about to depart from the lakeside when he saw the Chungong Tu that he tossed to the side before entering the lake. After thinking a little, he still picked Chungong Tu up and headed towards the direction of the rear mountain.\u2026Ever since the Medical Pavilion released an extraordinary item such as the Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid, it became livelier than it was previously.Practically, first thing in the morning every day, there would be a countless number of people showing up to linger with the intention of seizing the Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid as soon as they possibly could! Thankfully, Yun Luofeng gave several doses of Spirit-gathering Medicinal Liquid to the Medical Pavilion, preventing these people from making a riot at the scene.At this time, inside the Medical Pavilion inner hall, Elder Rong watched the grandfather-granddaughter pair sitting in front of him and chuckled. \u201cElder Rong, your arrival at Longyuan is quite fortuitous, I went out some time ago, and only just arrived here this morning. How is it? Did you find that godly doctor?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euElder Ning, this old man, ever since he contracted an incurable disease, he has had an ailing appearance. It had already been a long time since he looked as radiant and energetic as today. It was apparent that he found a life-saving method.\u201cElder Rong, you spoke correctly. I did find a famous doctor indeed, however, she isn\u2019t someone we personally know. Rather, it\u2019s a prestigious doctor who is hidden among the people. My illness is as good as cured.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Elder Rong raised his brow. \u201cThat\u2019s really great. Truthfully, because our Medical Pavilion couldn\u2019t cure you, I\u2019ve always felt guilty at heart. So when I heard that you\u2019ll be coming here, I was actually planning to introduce you to a doctor this time! This doctor is truly an exceptional genius, and she even has a cure for manluo flower\u2019s poison. As a matter of fact, I just returned from bringing Daren here.\u201dHearing that, Elder Ning was also startled while responding with a wry smile, \u201cIt turns out that Longyuan has many geniuses. The miss that I met is also a genius. She already promised to treat me, so I don\u2019t need to trouble Elder Rong this time. I believe in her ability.

Jing Lin has already exhausted every means possible and still couldn\u2019t make him recover. Therefore, this subordinate boldly suspects that he came here for Crown Prince.\u201dWithin a night, the matter about the Crown Prince completely losing his spirit energy spread throughout the entire Longyuan. Of course, this did not escape from Yun Luofeng\u2019s special broadcasting. With Jing Lin\u2019s medical skill, he certainly could not cure the Crown Prince. As such, he could only come to Medical Pavilion to seek help.\u201cGo back and inform Jing Lin that our Medical Pavilion doesn\u2019t treat people from the imperial clan!\u201d Elder Rong coldly stated.Elder Ning regarded Elder Rong with some astonishment. Even though the ego of the Medical Pavilion\u2019s doctors was quite enormous, and they were awfully difficult to request, Medical Pavilion had always given face to the imperial clan. What\u2019s more, the other party was none other than the imperial clan\u2019s His Highness the Crown Prince.Just now, he actually firmly rejected the other party\u2019s request?Elder Rong seemed to understand the confusion inside this old guy\u2019s heart and thus explained to him, \u201cElder Ning, we previously talked about the exceptional genius who\u2019s able to treat Daren\u2019s Man Luo poison. That genius just happened to have an enmity with Crown Prince. If I save the Crown Prince now, and she becomes unhappy and doesn\u2019t treat Daren, then who will I find to cry to?\u201dHearing these words, Elder Ning was stunned. \u201cThis coincidental? The genius that I know also happens to harbor a grudge against the Crown Prince. Last night, I even witnessed how she retaliated against the Crown Prince.\u201dElder Rong slightly jolted and was about to say something; however, just then a clamor was heard from the outside, faintly accompanied by the sound of Jing Lin\u2019s bellowing.\u201cWhat happened outside the door?\u201d Elder Rong stood up, frowning. \u201cLin Xiao, you go and see what\u2019s going on out there.

He\u2019s terrified that he would cause her ire.Lamentably, Lin Xiao did not know that Yun Luofeng\u2019s skill in medicine was already exposed last night\u2026\u201cOur Medical Pavilion will settle this matter ourselves.\u201dLin Xiao tightly furrowed his brows. All he wanted to do right now was to make Jing Lin leave. As for the other matters, they were not something he could question.\u201cOf course I believe in your Medical Pavilion\u2019s skill.\u201d When Jing Lin heard these words, he even thought the Medical Pavilion would give justice to him, and his aging appearance could not refrain from showing pleasure. \u201cBut this Yun Luofeng isn\u2019t only conceited and arrogant, she\u2019s also incomparably cunning. I\u2019m afraid that your Medical Pavilion would be unknowingly deceived by her. Just like yesterday, she randomly hired an old man to pretend to be sick and then volunteered to save that old man. As a result, everyone believes that she has an outstanding talent in medicine, when in fact, she\u2019s still the same useless person like before!\u201dThe corner of Yun Luofeng lips tilted up. She did not think that Jing Lin would go as far as making an excuse like an elderly man faking an illness just so he could convince himself that she could not really treat the old man!\u201cLin Xiao!\u201d An old voice slowly traveled behind Lin Xiao.The Medical Pavilion inner hall\u2019s curtain was lifted, and two elderly men came out from it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne of the old men was dressed in a white robe, having the manner of an immortal and the bearing of an expert. The other old man wore a cyan robe, and his aging face showed an ailing appearance. A pretty young lady closely accompanied him on the side. The girl was currently lending her arm to support the cyan-robed old man to slowly come out.\u201cElder Rong, Elder Ning.\u201dLin Xiao turned to face the two elderlies, respectfully cupping his hands in salute.\u201cHumph! I don\u2019t know who dares to cause trouble at our Medical Pavilion! Quickly get lost already!\u201d Elder Rong\u2019s temperament was extremely volatile, his sight sweeping everyone in the main hall until it finally settled on Jing Lin.Jing Lin naturally was oblivious that the person that Elder Rong spoke of was him. He even thought that the other person was rebuking Yun Luofeng; a touch of pleasure flashed through his eyes, and, thus, he roared at Yun Luofeng, \u201cYun Luofeng, didn\u2019t you hear Elder Rong\u2019s words?

However, he did not receive any help despite having knelt and instead, he suffered even more humiliation!Could you imagine a white-haired and aging old man helplessly kneeling in the biting, cold wind to save his son, and the people around him gave him nothing but derision and mockery!How heartrending and tragic was this?Compared with the humiliation that he suffered, he was more distressed by the grave injury of his son! If it were not for her second uncle luckily surviving, perhaps the old man would once again experience the pain of seeing his child die before his eyes!The entire Medical Pavilion became silent following Jing Lin\u2019s words.Everyone could feel a burst of oppressive atmosphere, as though the surrounding air had frozen\u2026\u201cYun Xiao.\u201dYun Luofeng\u2019s voice unhurriedly rung in the midst of this oppressive atmosphere. \u201cYou said I shall avenge my own grudges!

Were it not for her words, Jing Lin\u2019s head would probably be separated from his body in the next moment! Even so, was this something she desired?No!This was by no means the result that she wanted!Jing Lin was most proud of his own medical expertise! Only by ruthlessly stepping on his medical expertise would he succumb to an endless despair!\u201cJing Lin, you stood aside and watched someone die, and it wasn\u2019t your wrong! But you helped Mu family, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ve committed a grave mistake.

Her voice carried an incredibly powerful charisma and slowly traveled through the crowd.\u201cThere is a total of 200 people, 100 are men and the other 100 are women! So from now on, you will be segregated by gender and form two teams! As a man, you must have a mind and body as staunch as steel! Thus, from now on, you shall be called Steel Corps!\u201dAll of the men\u2019s posture became ramrod straight. They clearly had not started training yet, but they were already acting like regular soldiers; their mind and body solid as a boulder.\u201cWe, Steel Corps, from this time forth will definitely go through water and tread on fire for Eldest Miss without hesitation!\u201dYun Luofeng raised her lips in a faint smile, her wicked dark eyes shifting to Ye Ling.\u201cYe Ling, as Liujin Kingdom\u2019s third prince, you are more experienced when it comes to training compared to most people, so you will serve as Steel Corps\u2019 vice commander! I hope you won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dYe Ling\u2019s body froze, his startled gaze turning to Yun Luofeng.Before this, he assisted Gao Tu in scheming against her, but now this girl promoted him to vice commander? Ye Ling originally even thought that it was already quite nice that he was able to retain his life. He did not expect that Yun Luofeng would disregard former enmities and even give him an important position.He did not know why a strange emotion would envelop his heart, making his heart lean towards Yun Luofeng like a balance.\u201cYe Ling, although you plotted against me, I still recognize your abilities! If you wholeheartedly pledge your loyalty and devotion to me from this time forth, I will also bestow you a bright future!\u201dYun Luofeng glanced at the youth\u2019s sluggish expression and continued to say, \u201cHowever, if I find out that you betray me again, next time, it won\u2019t be as simple as using poison to control you\u2014I will definitely make your life worse than death!\u201dYe Ling\u2019s heart suddenly trembled, but he knew that Yun Luofeng would certainly do what she said!He pursed his lips and looked at Yun Luofeng with complicated feelings in his eyes, \u201cFrom now on, my life shall belong to you!\u201d\u201cRemember your words.\u201d Yun Luofeng looked up and turned to the other members of Steel Corps, an arrogant and domineering expression was visible on her face. \u201cAll of you must also remember that I would never allow anyone to betray me. If there are any traitors, I absolutely won\u2019t let them off! However, if you swear your loyalty to me, you will be one of my people from now on!

Then, everyone looked at Yun Luofeng, moved. Their heart started boiling in an instant.What could be more touching than a master who would treat your enemies as her enemies and your family as her own family?Just with these words alone, everyone had already acknowledged their allegiance to Yun Luofeng in their mind.\u201cEldest Miss,\u201d a handsome young man of sixteen or seventeen years of age raised his hand and weakly asked, \u201cI want to know if Third Prince is the vice commander, then who is our commander?\u201dYun Luofeng smiled. \u201cYour chief commander is quite a mysterious character.

Coupled with the fact that Second Uncle\u2019s morale was low, if she could have him lead the army, it would bolster his confidence.\u201cAs for the rest of you\u2026\u201d Yun Luofeng turned to the crowd of women and said, \u201cYou shall be called Raging Flame Corps. My intention for choosing this name is for you to become a raging flame, not leaving a single inch of ground alive wherever you go!\u201d\u201cWe will carefully adhere to Eldest Miss\u2019 commands,\u201d everyone in the Raging Flame Corps cupped their fists in salute and unanimously responded.\u201cRemember, you\u2019re no soldier, so you don\u2019t need to be restricted by doctrines!\u201d Yun Luofeng\u2019s voice was uninhibitedly domineering, as though embodying a type of insolence that looked down on people. \u201cProtecting the people is also not your responsibility!

Besides this, you can do as you will and be as you are!\u201dIt was not that Yun Luofeng disdained soldiers; any soldier was worth her respect!However, respect was just that\u2014respect.

Why would she implicate her family just for those people who were of no concern to her?What a grand \u201cYou can do as you will and be as you are!\u201dYe Ling chuckled wryly, his regard for Yun Luofeng becoming more complex. But he understood that there was already something gradually taking root and sprouting in his heart and growing into a towering tree that will eventually reach high up in the sky!This thing was called loyalty!\u201cEldest Miss, Steel Corps already has a commander and vice commander, may I ask who will serve those posts in our Raging Flame Corps?\u201d among the Raging Flame Corps, a quick-witted and adorable young girl raised her hand and blinked her eyes while asking.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Yun Luofeng\u2019s sight landed on the girl, lightly raising her brow.Seeing Yun Luofeng asking for her name, the young girl\u2019s heart was somewhat excited. \u201cI\u2019m named Zhong Ling\u2019er.\u201d\u201cZhong Ling\u2019er?\u201d Yun Luofeng smiled entrancingly. \u201cThis name is quite nice. You will be Raging Flame Corps\u2019 vice commander from now on. Of course, in the training following this, you must exert more effort than the rest of them! If you\u2019re unable to keep up, you can only abdicate your position to other people.\u201dZhong Ling\u2019er nearly jumped from excitement. Afraid that Yun Luofeng would really give the vice commander position to other people, she hurriedly swore, \u201cEldest Miss, don\u2019t worry, I definitely won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201dYun Luofeng faintly nodded. \u201cI hope so!

Thankfully, His Highness the Crown Prince abandoned you, otherwise, considering his status, he might not be a good match for you, Miss,\u201d Qingyan said, extremely angry. As soon as she thought of all the things that Gao Ling had done to Yun Luofeng, she would fume with resentment and rage between gritted teeth.\u201cQingyan,\u201d Yun Luofeng paused and suddenly asked, \u201cif there\u2019s an opportunity for you to become strong, would you be willing to accept it?\u201dIn the entire Yun Family, it could be said that besides Grandfather and Second Uncle, the one whom she trusted the most was none other than this little yatou.In the former Yun Family, only this little yatou genuinely and sincerely acted on her behalf!Qingyan stared at Yun Luofeng in bafflement. \u201cBecoming a strong person? Why does this servant need to become a strong person? This servant only wants to accompany Miss. Moreover, you are now a godly doctor, Miss.

Miss, you are really odd today. Why are you asking these questions?\u201dYun Luofeng burst into laughter as she shook her head, but she did not respond to Qingyan\u2019s question and said with raised brows, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I will treat someone\u2019s illness first. As for what I just mentioned, you will soon understand.\u201dInside the main hall, Yun Luo slowly took a sip of tea, his eyes would occasionally dart outside the door, anxiety gradually appearing in his eyes.\u201cElder Rong, Elder Ning, please wait for a few more minutes, that stinky girl of mine walks rather slow. She should currently be on her way.\u201dIf those who came here were from the imperial clan, Yun Luo would not be this anxious, but the one who came this time to seek Yun Luofeng was Elder Rong of the Medical Pavilion! And the other elderly person beside Elder Rong also was not an ordinary person; otherwise, Elder Rong would not respectfully call him Elder Ning.He could not even see through the ability of the pretty girl standing beside Elder Ning!

Her absolutely gorgeous feature carried a bewitching smile, and her dark eyes were like the pitch-black night sky, so deep that people had no way of examining the bottom of it!The lady\u2019s sight landed on the taciturn, middle-aged man inside the huge hall. After seeing the middle-aged man\u2019s pale hair, the smile on her lips revealed a trace of clear understanding.If she did not guess incorrectly, this middle-aged man was the person suffering from the manluo poison!\u201cYun\u2019yatou, you finally came.\u201d Elder Rong emotionally stood up. \u201cI have already brought the patient here. May I ask Yun\u2019yatou how certain are you that you can save him?Yun Luofeng raised the corner of her brow, watching the middle-aged man with a penetrating look. \u201cCurrently, he\u2019s already fatally ill, his head of white hair is the best proof! His appearance might still be around 40 years old, but, in truth, his physiological functions have already reached its limits!\u201dElder Rong\u2019s heart contracted. \u201cYun\u2019yatou, can he still be saved?\u201d\u201cStill possible.

Of course, if my treatment fails, I will return the original items!\u201dElder Rong\u2019s eyes glowed with excitement. To him, 70% chance of being cured was already more than enough! Those doctors of the Medical Pavilion did not even possess 10% chance of certainty!\u201cGirl, our Medical Pavilion has a red hackberry tree that\u2019s over a thousand years old. If you can save him, this red hackberry tree will be yours.\u201dYun Luofeng\u2019s heart abruptly quivered.Within the wide varieties of medicinal herbs, the red hackberry tree was considered extremely precious. It was said that a red hackberry tree only produced 10 red hackberries each year! And the number of red hackberry trees on the entire continent could be counted on one hand, so one could imagine how precious a thousand years red hackberry tree was.As for the use of red hackberries, it was said that it could raise the spiritual energy inside the body of a spirit cultivator after consuming it!Spiritual power was different from spiritual energy! Spiritual power served the purpose of being consumed while battling. Even if one was strong, when all of their spiritual strength was exhausted during a battle, they could still be trampled on by others.But the spiritual energy was the entire heaven and earth\u2019s spiritual energy and could be absorbed by spirit cultivators and concentrated at their dantian 1 . A breakthrough could be achieved after reaching a certain threshold.Thus, could you imagine the temptation a red hackberry tree that could provide the spiritual energy presented? Even if the spiritual energy it could give was pitifully meager, it could still make many people willing to spend a large sum to purchase it!\u201cYatou, I know that a red hackberry tree can\u2019t compare with your Spirit-Gathering Medicinal Liquid, but this is considered as our Medical Pavilion\u2019s most precious medicinal herb! if it weren\u2019t for saving Daren, I could not bear to take it out,\u201d afraid that Yun Luofeng would turn up her nose at the red hackberry tree, Elder Rong hurriedly explained.\u201cVery well.\u201d Yun Luofeng smiled, her eyes flashing with a streak of entrancing light. \u201cIf I successfully concoct the antidote, this red hackberry tree will be mine!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTo be honest, she really did not care for the little amount of spiritual energy that the red hackberry tree could provide!

Everyone who was present that day at the Medical Pavilion also did not dare to spread the matter everywhere due to Elder Rong\u2019s order.Thus, until now, Mu Wushuang did not understand that the reason that Prime Minister Estate was unable to purchase medicinal herbs at the Medical Pavilion was because Medical Pavilion wanted to vent their anger for Yun Luofeng!\u201cShuang\u2019er, you can rest assured that Grandfather will definitely avenge you for this humiliation!\u201d Mu Xingchou coldly stated as a murderous intent flashed through his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
