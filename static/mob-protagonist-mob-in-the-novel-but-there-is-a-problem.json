    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1.1. The Prologue Is An Epilogue! (1)There is a room with no light. The walls and ceiling were like obsidian, emitting no light at all. If there is a light source, the light would be absorbed and not be allowed to illuminate this room. The room was filled with a disastrous atmosphere.A black haze was spreading over the entire room, and the back of the room appeared to be blurred.It may be strange to describe it as a room. The room is one kilometer deep. The pitch-black world stretched out endlessly, and there was only silence.There was no design on the walls or ceiling and no furniture. If you listened carefully, you could hear the moans and groans of people coming out of nowhere, the thin, eerie voices of pain, hatred, and resentment like a noise.All would live in this space as evil. Even if it were an old building of historical value, it would unanimously agree to destroy it. Such was the room.The room had been several hundred years old without having been visited by anyone.After hundreds of years without a visitor, a light shines in this place. A magic circle with glowing blue letters appeared on the dust-free floor.The magic circle glowed brightly, and a figure appeared in the circle center. The figure, which had not been there before, was wearing a robe, and a hood covered its face.The magic circle had probably completed its work. It lost its light and disappeared ephemerally.The black haze that had filled the room began to move as if it had a will and tried to envelop the figure\u2019s body.The cursed haze takes the life of any fool who visits this room and turns them into dead persons. It was a terrible trap that would dissolve even their bones.The floor and ceiling polished like obsidian were not obsidian, but human blood had been smeared and polished into a jet-black material. It\u2019s a room made of tens of thousands of dead people. That was the fearless identity of this jet-black room.The death trap attacked the shadows and tried to suck out their life force. But something strange happened. As soon as the haze touched it, the figure absorbed the haze.Still, the haze attacked the figure without care. The haze that filled the vast room wriggled like slime, crawled toward the figure with sticky movements, and eventually, all of it was absorbed and disappeared.\u201cWas this haze treated as magic? Too bad, I absorb the dark attribute, sorry.\u201dThe shadow opened her mouth to apologize, but the apology was not sincere. Shrugging her shoulders, she walks through the darkness, as if she can see as if the haze has disappeared.When she reaches the center of the room, she holds her hand in the air. Curiously, several items appeared from the air, including multicolored swords, spears, jewels, and necklaces, and scattered to the ground. All emit a divine light and have the power to purify even this disastrous room.\u201cOh no, failure, failure.\u201dThe human figure arranged the scattered objects in a circular pattern with a wry smile on its mouth. The objects are too divine to be touched, yet she handled them as if the scattered objects were toys. When she finished their preparations, she held her hand in the air again.Then, a pulsating heart appears in the palm of his hand. The reddish-black beating heart was filled with an eerie spirit, like a crystal of evil.But the figure does not pay attention to the mass of evil and places it in the circle center.Then, holding out their hand, she began cheerfully chanting while turning her eyes to the air.\u201c[Use] the heart of the God of Destruction? [Yes], [Yes], [Yes]\u201dAs she finishes her mysterious chanting, the entire room glows red, illuminating the area. An eerie and disastrous magic circle, as if drawn by combining bones, is drawn around the heart, destroying several Sacred Artifacts.The mysterious spears were broken, and swords with divine light rusted. Shining pearls turned to stone, and necklaces emitting an air of serenity were shattered.Each time an item loses its power, the heart pulsates with power, and the aura of darkness it wears grows. After the items are shattered, the ground shakes, and the heart rises to the surface. The floating heart turns the jet-black aura it wears into bones, flesh, and skin.It\u2019s transformed into a giant that one could look up. It wears jet-black armor and a superbly designed toga, and his four arms, thick as logs and made of flabby muscles, hold swords and spears so clad in evil that the mere sight of them frightens you and makes your body tremble.Each strand of hair that grows on his twisted, sheep-like horned head is a snake, and its face has three vertical, golden, reptilian eyes. Mammoth-like fangs peek out from its mouth, and its breath is a miasma-like haze. On its back grew ten bat wings, and its body was a massive ten meters high.The floating monster in the sky was evil and should not exist in this world.The evil\u2019s eyes flashed, and it called out to the robed figure in a voice that sounded as if it were scratching at glass, a voice that made one feel sick just listening to it.\u201cWell done, you have revived me. The demon god [Ashtaroth] was born to destroy this world. Let\u2019s spread demons in this world and give all living things a demonic night.\u201d\u201cHeheheh. So, Ashtaroth-san, are you fully revived? Are you incomplete?\u201dThe figure asks with their hands on their hips, showing no respect for Ashtaroth. Ashtaroth\u2019s face is distorted in displeasure at this matter-of-fact attitude, but it forgives her attitude and answers, saying that she has resurrected itself nonetheless.\u201cUmu. I am completely resurrected. This body is overflowing with [Mana] and [Magic Power] that have never changed. I am fully recovered. Thanks for using all the Sacred Artifacts that sealed me in the resurrection ritual. I\u2019ll praise you.\u201dThe weapons and accessories scattered around the area were the Sacred Artifactts that had sealed Ashtaroth. It was a surprise to the demon god Ashtaroth that anyone could collect all the Sacred Artifacts and revive him in perfect condition.When it was unsealed before, half of the Sacred Artifacts were missing. Its power is imperfect and can only destroy half the world. It has been newly sealed with a Sacred Artifact created by humans gathering the power of gods.But now Ashtaroth\u2019s power was complete. With it, it could destroy the world and transform it into a world ruled by demons as it wished. God no longer existed in the land, only power hovered like air in the world.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Prologue Is An Epilogue! (2)Even if she gather the power of the gods and seal it with a divine instrument, as before, people were powerless before the completely resurrected Ashtaroth.Ashtaroth was happy with its power. And with joy, he taught the weak mortal a lesson.The human nodded her head, their mouth twisted into a grin, and she looked pleased. Ashtaroth nods at this expression and asks what kind of reward she would like. It is a complete revival of himself. Its reward must also be great.\u201cCome, mortal. Say your reward. Do you want to be my servant? Then I will give you power as the first of my retainer. Or do you want the wisdom of magic? I will give you the knowledge of the abyss.\u201dThe human replies to the demon god that asks what she wants.She replied with unexpected words.\u201cHe was incomplete in the novel. I think he was incomplete because the hero had a hidden Sacred Treasure. I thought I remembered that an incomplete resurrection made him has less than half its power.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe said she was wondering if it was a perfect resurrection. That\u2019s right. Without a Sacred Artifact, Ashtaroth\u2019s ability would be less than half. The items number she has is also important, but if she doesn\u2019t have all of them, Ashtaroth\u2019s power will be less than half. For him to be completely revived, she had to collect all the Sacred Artifacts.Ashtaroth was amazed at how skeptical what the human said was. Ashtaroth would think that she was an irreverent human. Ashtaroth thought he could not trust the human\u2019s word, and he certainly did not.(\u7591\u308a\u6df1\u3044\u4eba\u9593\u3060\u3068\u5446\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30ed\u30c8\u306e\u8a00\u8449\u3092\u4fe1\u7528\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u306e\u304b\u3068\u3001\u4e0d\u905c\u306a\u5974\u3081\u3068\u601d\u3046\u304c\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002)\u201cIn the novel, I didn\u2019t think it was a Sacred Artifact with weak power, and neither the protagonist nor the adversary thought it was a Sacred Artifact that sealed Ashtaroth. So the enemy side, who thought they had gathered everything, and the protagonists, who were not expecting it, were surprised, and then the incomplete Ashtaroth was defeated, the resealing was done by the saint, and the world was at peace. It was a happy-go-lucky end, you know?\u201dIt\u2019s a template, the human says, not quite sure what she\u2019s talking about.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIn the game, there was a hidden route, secretly stealing the main character\u2019s ring, and a secret boss was ending where Ashtaroth was completely revived. The reward drops from that fight are good, and the special ability, so I can unlock the third job. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dThe human strung their words together, heedless of Ashtaroth\u2019s dubiousness. Their words cheerfully spread across the room.\u201cBut if you don\u2019t beat him within 10 minutes, there\u2019s no third job setting off. Well, it\u2019s like, why don\u2019t people change jobs, but it\u2019s a hassle. As a challenging element, it is available but not usable. It was a reward that tickled my collector\u2019s fancy.\u201dThe human calls up a clock in the palm of their hand and presses it down with a click. It must be a stopwatch. Tick-tock, tick-tock, the stopwatch begins to tick away the time.\u201cSo, goodbye, Secret Boss-san. Good for you for having a game scenario. Usshsihshi.\u201dThe human smiles happily, and Ashtaroth finally understands.\u201cI don\u2019t understand, but I understand your irreverent words to defeat me. Die.\u201dPointing his index finger, Ashtaroth shows irreverent human power. He realized that this was the person who was trying to defeat him.[Extreme Flame]Flames like the sun shoot out from the index finger, burning the air and distorting space as he strikes the human. If even a fragment of the fire sparks hit the human being, the high heat of several hundred million degrees will extinguish them, leaving no trace.It was supposed to.\u201cWhat?\u201dHowever, surprisingly, the [Extreme Flame] was absorbed and disappeared as soon as it touched the human being. He couldn\u2019t believe its eyes at this unbelievable sight.\u201cOh, I absorb the flame attribute. Sorry.\u201d\u201cThen how about this?\u201d[Shinra 4 Element Polar Wave]From the weapons he held by the four hands, roaring divine thunder, absolute zero that freezes everything, a storm of wind blades that cuts through anything, and a tsunami of sand that petrifies all living things are released and directed at the human.But the result is unbelievable. As soon as the magic touched the human, it was absorbed, then vanished without leaving any trace of its activation.\u201cSorry. I\u2019ll rephrase. I absorb everything but the universal attribute.\u201d\u201cThat power is impossible for a human being. Who are you?\u201dAshtaroth finally realized that the human in front of him was not human. He did not know how she had hidden it, but he felt the immense power in her body and finally prepared itself to ask with a stern face.\u201cMy second job is \u2018God\u2019. And my main job is\u2026\u201dThe human chuckles as she removes her hood.\u201cMy Top Up job is \u2018Old God\u2019. Part of the old gods.\u201dThe power of chaos spread around the Old God, melting the floor into mush and distorting the space.\u201c\u2026\u2026, Old Gods! You guys should have disappeared beyond the universe!\u201dAshtaroth shudders in fear as he feels the unmistakable Old God, the power of chaos.\u201cYeah, that was expensive. Then I\u2019ll try my best to defeat you within 10 minutes.\u201dThe one who called herself the Old God replied to the astonished Ashtaroth in a light tone and began to fight.The Third Magic Academy boasts a name in the Japanese Magic Empire. In the middle of the night, light covered the academy and disappeared with an earthquake.Strangely enough, the guards and those who remained until night were outside the academy, and there were no casualties.There was no trace of the destroyed institute, leaving only a large hole 100 meters deep.The earthquake that occurred at the time of the disappearance lasted for a long time, and people thought that it was not an earthquake but some kind of ritual magic, but people never found the cause after the investigation team looked into it.However, the earthquake lasted only seven minutes. That was all that were people known.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve Been ReincarnatedIt was early in the morning, and one old man, dressed in a suit, you could find anywhere, was riding the long escalator at a train station. It was still early in the morning, and no one else was on the escalator but me. I thought that was unusual to see no one else on the escalator in Tokyo, but I stood on the left side anyway.There is an unspoken agreement that the escalator is for people who do not climb the escalator on the left side. The right side is for people who walk up the escalator. I heard it is different in the Kanto and Kansai regions, where it is the opposite. I also wonder if walking up the escalator is against the misdemeanor law, I think to myself with a drowsy smile. Either way, I have no intention of walking up the mountain. It\u2019s tiring, and I don\u2019t see the point of running up the escalator.So I took it easy and waited for the escalator to reach the top. For a high-speed escalator, it is fast. So fast that I wondered if any daredevil would run up this high-speed escalator.Looking back, I realized in the future that it was probably a \u2018flag\u2019, and I had thought of that. But I didn\u2019t particularly care at the time. Nothing would have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for the man running next to me with his wild footsteps.Hmm? I noticed the footsteps but did not look back. That\u2019s how fast the high-speed escalator is, and the escalator at this station is incredibly long. There was a possibility that I might turn around and fall.So, although I was concerned about it, I left it as it was. I think most people would have done the same. They are curious, but they don\u2019t express that curiosity anymore. With age, curiosity tipped the scales of laziness and loss.I heard footsteps approaching and saw a man running up beside me at a tremendous pace. He was a young man of small stature. He was dressed normally, sweating, and breathing heavily. I thought he was going on a trip because he was carrying a trunk case with tires. The kind with a puller people use when traveling abroad.I thought he was going to be late for his tour or was going to miss his flight. That would be the pattern. I thought about how brave he was to run up the high-speed escalator as I watched him run up the escalator.But that was until the young man slipped and fell. Of all things, the young man slipped his foot when he was almost at the top. Perhaps it was because he was relieved that he would arrive soon. There must have been a lack of exercise, his legs seemed wobbly.The young man and his trunk case fell. I was a little lower than him, and get caught up in the unfortunate thing and rolled off. With a clunk, my body hit the corner of the escalator stairs, causing severe pain. I heard the sound of bones snapping, and then my body stopped moving, and I fell to the bottom.Seriously? I thought in horror at the immobility of my body and the lack of injury. I knew it. This is a fatal wound. I was going to die, I thought through my fading vision.This young man, I don\u2019t forgive him. Don\u2019t drag me into this. I almost cry. I\u2019m single. I have been saving for my retirement, which amounts to 50 million yen. Either the government will confiscate it, or my relatives will take it. Either way, there will be nothing left for me. I can\u2019t bring the money to the Sanzu River.I should have lived more luxuriously. I wanted to drink sake worth tens of thousands of yen, stay in a suite for several hundred thousand yen per night, and travel abroad. Regret is all that strikes me.There is no such thing as the world of death. There would be no hell or heaven. I wanted to live a luxurious life, and I thought I had died regretting my life.Yes, I did die. My life ended there.And a new life began.When I came to, I was a baby.\u201cAhh ahh\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t move my arms and legs. What is this?At first, I thought I had survived. I could have survived with serious injuries. But I soon realized. Because a strange man was looking at me, he looked happy to see me. He didn\u2019t even look like a doctor.He also said something to me.\u201cBaby, it\u2019s daddy!\u201dA man with a face that was not handsome enough to be called handsome, but had a charming face, said this to me in a happy tone. I managed to move my hand and found it was as tiny as an autumn leaf. It seemed to be my hand.I see, I might have been reincarnated. Now I am a baby. It may be a dream, but it is more hopeful to think that I have been reincarnated. I\u2019ll enjoy this life, even if I wake up tomorrow. But then I realized something else that frightened me.I was overwhelmed with fear.\u201cAgyah!\u201dI cried out. What was the reason for my fear?Babies don\u2019t have their heads fixed, so they can\u2019t move. If I tried to move like an adult, I might die or left with a disability.I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m afraid of this life. Am I embarrassed to be a baby? No, it\u2019s not that. Babies are prone to death. They are like glasswork. When I become a baby, I cried out in horror at my body\u2019s fragility before I felt embarrassed or anything like that.So I hardly moved until I could crawl, and my parents worried about me as a baby.I don\u2019t remember much about my terrifying baby life. But my parents were good-looking and had a good-natured personality. When I cried at night, my father would soothe me even though he had to work the next day. And he didn\u2019t even look tired or unhappy.My mother was sleeping peacefully and comfortably while my father was doing the same.I was astonished. These parents are very accomplished people. Not only are they good friends. They are not only good friends but also have good personalities. They have both.Because the wive don\u2019t show it. She could have looked disgusted with me, or at the very least, could have looked tired. And yet, she smiles at me and soothes me.I was moved and thought, this is the best family I\u2019ve ever had. I was impressed. My reincarnation was the best environment.I became very fond of my parents and vowed to do my best to prevent the breakdown of their marriage.First of all, I would try not to cry at night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve Been ReincarnatedI realized that this is Japan, even though I am a baby. Finally, I could crawl, waddle, smile, say \u201cPapa mama\u201d, and beg to be carried by them.My parents were worried because I didn\u2019t move much and didn\u2019t cry much at night. They were afraid my body would shatter, so I could only say I was sorry about that.They hold and pamper me, but I check my surroundings, and there is also a phone. There is a TV, and the food is normal. There were fried eggs and curry. Yes, it\u2019s Japan. The TV content is also normal. My parents seem to like traveling and eating, so they often watch programs related to that.She has dark eyes, dark hair, an ordinary appearance, neither thin nor fat, and a standard body shape. She lives in a house, and my mom is a housewife. My father is an office worker. I don\u2019t know what kind of work he does, but he usually goes home on time.A normal family. They are still in love even though they are not newlyweds, take care of each other, say kind words and words of appreciation, share the household chores, and go for walks as a family on their days off. Sometimes we eat out.Some people might pity us, saying it\u2019s a pity that I\u2019ve been reincarnated and I have a mediocre family. It is a pity to have an ordinary family.But I have to say that anyone who would say such words is young. A housewife, you know? She owns a house with a lot of lands and doesn\u2019t need money. Above all, the family gets along very well. They are miraculous parents. Are they saints?It\u2019s better than being reborn in a world of swords and magic. Because a world of swords and magic is a hassle, isn\u2019t it? Above all, there is no TV, no internet. In the world of swords and magic, there are no video games. I can\u2019t live there. And there\u2019s no good food either.\u201cMii-chan, mummy, it\u2019s time for a snack!\u201dA few years later. I was rolling around in the living room when my mom beckoned to me with a smiling face. I was rolling around because I was having fun. I had grown so young that my spirit had been high in it.\u201cHi~!\u201dI walked to my mom and asked her to take me in her arms. Skinship is important.\u201cMommy, thanks for the snacks!\u201dI thanked her with a smiling face. It\u2019s very important to say thank you for everything. I always say thank you to my parents with a smile. Family is important.\u201cI made homemade cookies today. They\u2019re hot, so be careful.\u201d\u201cHomemade!\u201dI was so surprised that my mouth dropped open. Because they are homemade, right?\u201cHere you go.\u201dThere are cookies and milk on the table. They were slightly warm in my hand. Seriously, warm cookies? Huh? Are they homemade cookies? What a legendary item!When I take it into my little mouth and bite into it, I feel a light touch, the sweetness spreads, and the warmth lingers in my mouth. I\u2019ve never had a warm cookie before! They were freshly made!I thought homemade cookies were an urban legend. Mom\u2019s homemade cookies are delicious. They were the best.I\u2019m convinced that this was the best environment for me. In my previous life, my parents were divorced and always talked shit about each other, so maybe the comparison was too harsh.But I was moved even if the comparison was wrong. I had never seen such a family. Even on TV, the only families that get along are the immortal sea families. In dramas, they are usually divorced and don\u2019t get back together unless there is a touching and adventurous event. I would like to ask them if they know what the suspension bridge effect is.So I know that the seemingly ordinary family is a miracle. My mom seemed to be a somewhat ladylike ex-box girl, though. She must come from a good family.I clutched the cookie tightly and smashed it to pieces, determined not to let this family fall apart.\u201cKukki~!\u201dI was a young boy with fragile tear glands. I was so fragile that I could not hold back my tears. Handmade cookies. I was on the verge of tears, but my mom smiled and patted me on the head to comfort me.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s more where that came from.\u201dI made a firm vow to my mom as she consoled me. It was a vow of homemade cookies. I would protect this family.Then I crushed another cookie.What should I do to protect this family as a child? \u2026\u2026 Smiles, gratitude, and money.Let\u2019s study the winning numbers of the lotto. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. It\u2019s the perfect plan. I thought if I study it from an early age. I\u2019ll win at least the first prize a few times. I never won anything in my previous life.So I decided to collect lotto numbers by tapping on the computer. I would have to say it was a constructive action. I think people would give me a lot of credit for that. What do you think?And so I lived as a good boy until I was five years old. Unfortunately, my parents didn\u2019t buy a lotto, so I had to wait until I was old enough to buy one. It\u2019s called lying in bed.But when I turned five.My life was ruined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve Been Reincarnated As A MobI am 5 years old. I become 5 years old. My house is about 3.5 acres. It\u2019s small, but it has a yard and a parking lot. It is a modern house and was built less than 10 years ago. I thought perhaps my parents built it when they got married.But I do not intend to act wisely. I won\u2019t surprise my parents by reading difficult books or making adult-like statements. There is no need for such a cute little kid.No, a young child who is just plain smart is fine, okay? But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to reincarnate and show off that you\u2019re smart. Even adults understand that. There is a difference between child cleverness and adult cleverness.Child cleverness and adult cleverness, what do you choose? If your child is weird, you are more likely to consider them creepy. If they are kind parents, though, they might still not mind.I don\u2019t need to test my parents\u2019 minds in vain. So I played the role of a young child.On the washbasin, on my step stool, I sloshed my face. I check my hair to see if there are no sleeping habits or messy spots, and I confirm my clothes fit me. Young children like to be clean. There is nothing strange about them. A well groomed child is very popular.\u201cMii-chan likes to be clean! Uri-uri.\u201d\u201cKyaaa~\u201dI squeal with delight and hug my mom. Then my mom giggles softly and pats my head. I feel relieved by her patting me. I close my eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s almost lunchtime. Let\u2019s go shopping, shall we?\u201d\u201cYes! Can I buy some snacks?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll reward you if you carry my luggage.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll carry your luggage!\u201dI jumped up and down and was happy. This kind of coaxing is very pleasing to parents. My body is also begging for a treat. It\u2019s no wonder, I\u2019m still young.Hand in hand with my mother, we set out for shopping. I carry an eco-bag. I\u2019m a good girl.I see familiar asphalt-paved roads, cars coming and going, and convenience stores. It\u2019s a safe and secure scene in Japan. I wave as I walk, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in a world of swords and sorcery.\u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood, Mii-chan!\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking forward to sweets!\u201d\u201cOh, dear.\u201dI walk to the supermarket with my giggling mother. I wonder, where do I live? Tokyo? I don\u2019t see any forests, no fields. Tokyo \u2026\u2026, right? It doesn\u2019t look like Kansai. And I haven\u2019t seen anyone using the Kansai dialect.But I don\u2019t see foreigners either. In Tokyo, there are always foreigners working in convenience stores and restaurants. I wonder if everything is not the same as in my previous life in Japan.While walking, I was curious, but I decided to leave it in my memory, thinking I could look it up later. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t ask random questions. I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m a kid who asks strange things when I have nothing to compare it. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m a little timid, but I want to cherish family relationships.\u201cOh, Takano-san. Are you shopping with your kid?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m just going to the supermarket there.\u201d\u201cHello, auntie!\u201dI greeted her with a cute smile. The basis of neighborly relations is greetings. If you can say hello, you can get a good reputation.\u201cOh my goodness, that\u2019s a nice greeting. You always look so cute. I envy you.\u201dThe woman and mom greeted each other on the way. My last name is Takano, my mother is Takano Birei, and my father is Houretsu. What can I say, parents with somewhat upper-class-like names? Well, whatever.I walked on. It\u2019s spring, and soon it will be the rainy season. I thought I don the rainy season, as I happily talked with my mother and headed for the supermarket.And then I met something that ruined my life. I didn\u2019t want to meet it.It was in the shape of a person. It was walking with a clattering metallic sound.\u201cMom, is that a cosplay?\u201dI pointed at it as an adorable five-year-old child.\u201cOh, that\u2019s an adventurer heading for the dungeon.\u201d\u201cFor cosplay, they needed to go to the venue and change their clothes\u2026 But their hair is also bright pink or green. Is there a cosplay venue around here?\u201dThere is a huge green-haired old man with mechanical iron armor and a futuristic mechanical spear, and a girl dressed in a witch\u2019s triangular hat and black robe with a knotted wooden staff. By the way, she had pink hair.People with similar outfits and unusual hair colors walked by, and I thought there must be a cosplay venue nearby. I had never been to a cosplay venue in my previous life. I had never been to Comiket, which is held in summer or winter. So, I said to myself, I\u2019d like to go there. It was different from begging for sweets. It was a request that she might refuse it.I made a silly wish as my first request, but I decided to live my life as I wished after my reincarnation. Of course, family is the highest priority.Then my mother giggled and told me.\u201cCosplay? Those people will get angry if they hear about it. They\u2019re adventurers who graduated from Magic Academy after waking up to the power to use [Mana].\u201d\u201cAdventurers?\u201dWhat? I was puzzled. My instincts were starting to warn me that this was a bad conversation. But my mom, oblivious to my confusion, gently stroked my head and told me.\u201cThese are the people who conquer the dungeons in this world. They are the people who destroy the scary, scary dungeons where demons appear. The fact that their hair color is not black is a sign that they have awakened to be able to handle [Mana].\u201d\u201cHe~.\u201dI stared at my mom\u2019s face and wondered if she was serious, but she didn\u2019t seem to be lying or teasing me. Huh? Is that the way you see the world?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve Been Reincarnated As A MobI was skeptical and afraid that I was not on Earth.\u201cYou see, it is the job of adventurers to collect and sell monsters\u2019 stones, pelts, and other such items from dungeons. Monsters, you know, if you leave the dungeon unattended, they will come out and attack people. It\u2019s scary.\u201dMy mom pointed to a truckload of monsters\u2019 stones and pelts. As I listened to the sound of the truck\u2019s engine past me, my heart also went crazy with a sense of danger.I broke my common sense that day. That evening, I was watching TV in a daze, thinking I had been reborn in another world when I heard a news report.There\u2019s a tournament between Magic Academy, and it\u2019s crazy. The news was showing people in power suits with armor that looked like power suits, and the women in more revealing suits for some reason.The announcer was getting excited about how the best adventurers are supposed to be flying, but when I saw the erotic, nerdy-powered suits, I realized something. I had noticed. I honestly wish I hadn\u2019t noticed.In the future, I\u2019m planning to use my previous life experience and become rich. I had vowed to study the lottery winning numbers first. I had already piled up several notebooks with the average numbers written down.But then he realized something.\u201cThis is the world of \u2018The Night of Magic\u2019!\u201dI, who sat in front of the TV set playing the role of a quiet child, stood up and made an astonished cry.\u201c\u2018The Night of the Magic\u2019 is a modern fantasy novel. I don\u2019t know much about the worldview where dungeons are born, but magic stones and monster materials sell at high prices, and adventurers have been treated favorably since long ago.Based on this background, the story is about the protagonist who, while flirting with beautiful girls who appear one after another at the academy, protects the seal of the Demon God sealed in the academy from various enemies that will destroy the world. Then, the seal was broken, and the hero defeats the Demon God.Regarding the template development, when this novel was published, such development was novel, and it was completed after 25 volumes were released. It\u2019s a level that impresses me that I didn\u2019t get enough of it now. I\u2019ve never seen a school fantasy come to an end.In my previous life, I finished about five years before I died. I bought volumes 1-10 and 25. I got bored in the middle of the book and left it alone. I only bought the last volume because I was curious about what happened at the last volume. That is typical of long series.This was a popular low-fantasy series, and the anime goes for five seasons. It was a popular work that was also made into a game. Incidentally, the game was an open world, and people could make characters separately from the main characters in the novel. The game was an RPG that was popular not only with its fans but also with gamers, partly due to its interactions with the novel\u2019s main characters. I played it a lot.I realized that I had entered the world of the novel. It\u2019s a common pattern in a web novel\u2019s story. And I had never heard my name. I\u2019ve seen all the anime that made it to the final episode, so I know I\u2019m not a sub-regular character or buzzing mob. I\u2019m not sure because I have very few character names in my memory, but I remember the characters in that novel because they were cute. I knew no one looked like me.I\u2019m a perfect mob. That is a pattern I see in novels from time to time. I was reincarnated as a mob. My future was closed by a dark cloud. After all, this is a world where monsters occasionally appear and kill mobs. I don\u2019t want to play the role of a man who died screaming.\u201cBut there are cases where mobs become rivals of the hero or become lovers with one of the heroines.\u201dThere is a pattern that if someone reincarnated as a mob they could become strong. They become good rivals with the hero, and if the hero is also a reincarnated person, they\u2019re usually an annoying hero, so they defeat them and take their place as the hero.A common pattern is that the heroine and the mob become friends and become lovers. Although this is a development that makes one wonder what a mob is.The mob hero becomes strong with a deadly effort. That\u2019s also the possible pattern.In a world where monsters roam free, I\u2019ll never know when I\u2019ll die in a monster\u2019s attack. Moreover, a dubious dark group may carry out a terrorist attack. On top of that, my home is close to the institute. The possibility of getting involved is extremely high.That is not an option. I thought and decided to work myself to death. There is a very high possibility that I will die if I don\u2019t do that.Besides, I might be able to become a lover of the heroine. In the novel, the hero is liked by many heroines, but my favorite heroines are usually sub-heroines. There\u2019s no need to compete with each other.And if you become an adventurer, you can become rich. A high-ranking adventurer can make millions of dollars in a single earning.That might be better than studying the winning numbers of the lotto, so I decided to become a strong adventurer. I decided to become strong and join the hero in fighting off terrorists at the Third Academy, getting kidnapped on a school trip, and defeating the Demon God. I can say that this sounds like a fun development.Even at a young age, I was determined to be strong and become stronger.\u201cBut how do I go about training?\u201dFirst of all, how to train, I sighed. But, well, I\u2019m five years old. A quick start from here will do the trick.That\u2019s what I thought, but it didn\u2019t go so easily. I longed to become an adventurer, and with my twinkling eyes, even when I asked my parents about my training methods, it was only running a marathon or helping out at home.That\u2019s right. I was a mob character, and my parents were a mob. They were not adventurers. So there was no way they would know how to train me.A dark cloud was already hovering in front of me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Trigger Was An EventI was 6 years old. I was now the oldest child in kindergarten. Of course, I went to kindergarten. But talking to a toddler is no fun. They are adorable, though. After all, the adult part of me has a hard time letting him take the option of playing with a kindergartner.But for the sake of my family, I pretended to be a normal kindergartener so that the teacher wouldn\u2019t call my parents to tell them that that child was too mature and anxious.I played with the children, takaoni, and built dunes. I\u2019m pretending to be a normal kindergartener. Lately, though, I\u2019d been a little depressed.Because I had no idea how to practice. I was making sand piles in a depressed mood. Of course, I did not awaken to [Mana] even if I ran a marathon or helped out at home. By the way, I did the marathon in the garden.How could I awaken to [Mana]? In the novel, everyone awakened their [Mana] from the beginning. The protagonist, too. So there was no description of how to awaken. Even if there was, it is doubtful that I, as a mob member, would be able to awaken, but I would like to try it.I danced, flipped, sang, and pinged, but to no avail. It\u2019s funny. My mom just added more photos to my album. I\u2019m a good boy, so my mom was happy when I did that. I don\u2019t know why she was so happy about it.As I was thinking about it while making sand piles, a concerned voice called to me.\u201cMii-chan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dIt was the voice of a young girl, polite but with a hint of childishness. I looked up at the young girl standing across the sandhill from me.\u201cWell, is something wrong?\u201d\u201cYeah, I usually mobilize everyone to make a diorama out of the sand, and we all start playing tag, so I prepare a lot of demons and play with them obsessively, but lately, only I and the dunes. I don\u2019t make them.\u201dI pretend to be a normal kindergarten boy, and always pretend to play like crazy.\u201cI have a problem. But I don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u201dDismayed and depressed, I answer my friend honestly. Is it that weird? It\u2019s a life-altering situation, so I can\u2019t help it.\u201cWhat are you worried about? Is it that you don\u2019t get enough snacks or do you want to play more?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a secret.\u201dI give her a gentle smile to cover it with a tee-hee and start making sand piles again. My friends look at me with concern, but it\u2019s not the kind of worry that kindergarteners come up with.She stares at me, so I give her another smile to fool her. On the other side of the room, playing together and making sand piles are Teijou Yamiyo.She has a good name. I am not prejudiced about her name. I\u2019m just a mob guy who has entered a novel. I suspect that the characters with cool names are the ones who appear in the novel.But in this novel, even mob characters have cool names, so it\u2019s hard to judge.Teijou Yamiyo is a young girl who looks cute, or like she could be beautiful. She wears her shiny black hair in pigtails that are as black as raven feathers, beautiful eyes like black diamonds, and a face that, despite her young age, makes you think that she will become a beauty in the future. Her tone of voice is that of a polite young lady, and I heard once that she is the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Teijou.She is full of attributes. I thought she was one of the heroines who would be the hero\u2019s companion, but I was wrong. A beautiful black-haired, dark-eyed girl with a polite young lady tone of voice didn\u2019t appear in \u2018The Night of Magic\u2019, did she? I don\u2019t remember their names, but I remember the faces of the beautiful girls in \u2018The Night of Magic\u2019.I\u2019m not good at remembering names. I can\u2019t remember the names of characters from anime or novels, especially if they have nothing to do with my work and I don\u2019t have to remember them. But I do remember the faces of cute characters.If Yamiyo changes into a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, vertically drilled young lady, I can think of a character, but I have a dim memory that the girl\u2019s name is not Japanese.Yeah, I don\u2019t remember it at all. Well, in any case, I don\u2019t think it was a character in the novel. Maybe Yamiyo was in a spin-off, but I got bored with the main story. I haven\u2019t even seen the spin-off story. If it was the anime, I might have remembered it.Even so, I decided not to pretend to be a character. I mean, this kindergarten. There are a lot of girls with the same tone of voice. It seems to be a kindergarten for good families. I wonder if my family is wealthy after all.By the way, she is a marquis\u2019 daughter because this Japan is a country called the Japanese Magic Empire and is ruled not by the emperor (tennou), but by the emperor (koutei). Then democracy is up to the House of Representatives. The House of Councilors changed its name to the House of Peers and is ruled by prestigious aristocrats.Yes, it is the classic novel setting. If there are nobles, it is easy to make a story for a novel. I know, I know.\u2018The Night of the Magic\u2019 is a classic low-fantasy novel. In other words, it is a novel that made templates. In other words, a world full of templates. That\u2019s the world I live in.Yamiyo stares at me with her head tilted back cutely. Even at a young age, she probably realizes that I\u2019m fooling around with her. Children are sensitive about such things.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. But more importantly, isn\u2019t it about time for lunch?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m sure Mii-chan\u2019s lunchtime is accurate.\u201dPuffing up her cheeks, Yamiyo looks dissatisfied, but she still goes along with my subject\u2019s change. She\u2019s a good girl.\u201cI\u2019ll clean up before I go, so wash your hands, Yamiyo-chan.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand. I\u2019ll go ahead then.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Trigger Was An EventWhen I put the shovel and scoop in the little bucket, Yamiyo usually says she will clean up the mess with me, but today she nodded and went ahead to wash her hands. Smiling, I grab the bucket and trudge over to the tool shed.What\u2019s for lunch? That is important. I need to think about my training, but I am a toddler now. If I don\u2019t get plenty of nutrition and exercise in moderation, I will have trouble with my health in the future due to metabolic syndrome or something. I don\u2019t want the doctor to tell me to exercise, so I do a lot of exercises. So I\u2019m starving, so rice is an important event for me.As for me, curry is good. Because I can have another serving. I was about to wash my hands, thinking I had to beat off all the other bad kids and get a second helping.\u201cKyaaa! Yamiyo-chan!\u201dI heard a child\u2019s voice coming from the washroom, it was a scream. And the scary one at that. And children running away in a panic down the hallway.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cEn-chan, I\u2019m in trouble! I was washing my hands, and a ghost came out!\u201dsays a friend who ran away crying. A ghost?\u201cIt came out of the wall! Yamiyo-chan was protecting me, and the ghost attacked her!\u201dThe other friend tells me, and I know it\u2019s not just something that happened. It wasn\u2019t a children\u2019s fight or anything. Could it be that a monster had appeared?\u201cEveryone goes to the teacher! I\u2019m going to go save Yamiyo-chan!\u201dSomeone said it\u2019s natural to save your friends, and they\u2019re right. And since the little girl could escape, I thought the monster might not be that strong, so I ran out to Yamiyo\u2019s place. I thought it was a weak monster that even I could beat.Please don\u2019t call me a calculating person. I\u2019m not the hero of a novel, so I don\u2019t want to risk my life. Isn\u2019t that normal?\u201cYeah, save Yamiyo-chan.\u201d\u201cGood luck, Empress-chan!\u201dThe little girls wave me off with a flick of their hands. Empress is my nickname, but I\u2019ve always wondered what an Empress is. A fellow press? Well, I don\u2019t have time to think about that now.I moved my little arms and legs as hard as I could and headed for the washroom.When I arrived at the washroom, I knew what was going on. Yamiyo was crouched down and holding her head. I saw an old woman with a semi-transparent haze of darkness growing over Yamiyo\u2019s young body.It is not that Yamiyo has awakened to the power of a ghost user. I have seen this situation in novels and games.\u201cPossession, huh? If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a Wraith.\u201dAmong monsters, a nasty one that physical attacks cannot penetrate. It\u2019s a Wraith. Its special ability is [possession]. It is a monster that possesses humans and manipulates them to kill other humans.I\u2019m not good at remembering names, but I can remember the names and special abilities of monsters that are easy to understand. It\u2019s probably a gamer thing.\u201cIt was an early event, I think. In the novel, the protagonist saves a girl who\u2019s easily possessed. It was the same in the game.\u201dI know how to beat it. But the fact that I can\u2019t do it now makes me break out in a cold sweat.Okay, normal monsters have walls and stuff, so even if they come out from the dungeon the adventurers will take them down. But a ghost that can penetrate walls can do this? It would be an unpleasant situation in real life. I understand why a walking girl got possessed in a game.While I was wondering what to do, Yamiyo\u2019s groan of agony turned into a hoarse voice like an old woman. Yamiyo stopped crouching and stood up like a ghost.\u201cUaaaah, diediediedie.\u201dShe must be completely possessed. When I thought it swayed its body, it came toward me.I couldn\u2019t beat it. But I still had time to spare. The Wraith could only attack people with the possessed person\u2019s body. Yamiyo does not have a knife, cutter, or scissors in her hand. She is just a little girl.I, an adult in spirit, could not get through to her. I subdued her with a little time to spare, and all I had to do was wait for the adventurers to arrive.\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m going to have to hurt you a little. Sorry if I bruise you.\u201d\u201cDiediediedie.\u201dYamiyo, her eyes bloodshot with madness, punches out. But a little girl punch doesn\u2019t work on me. She\u2019s a little faster, but she\u2019s still a powerless little girl.\u201cYo!\u201dWhen I guard with my arm, I restrain Yamiyo\u2019s arm before it becomes a spoiled child punch. If I hook her leg and knock her down as it is, I\u2019m done controlling her. I took judo in high school. If it was just a little girl, I could take her down.I even had time to confirm that Yamiyo didn\u2019t hit her head on the floor. It was when he slowly knocked her down with an osoto-gari and tried to restrain her by carrying her body the rest of the way.[Create Dark Weapon]Yamiyo mutters something as she knocks me down and rampages away. And the aura of darkness gathers in Yamiyo\u2019s hand. It\u2019s a moment like this, but I was impressed by the light. It is amazing to see a magic aura in real life. Through the TV, it didn\u2019t seem real, and I thought it was CG.But I was impressed until the aura gathered in Yamiyo\u2019s hands, and turned into a sword of darkness.Oh, isn\u2019t this awesome?I thought I was drunk, but when Yamiyo swung the sword so wildly that it snatched my arm, I realized how great magic was.I\u2019m so surprised to see that my arm was cut in half, because of the graze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I Knew I\u2019m A True Mob CharacterYamiyo\u2019s movements were not fast or forceful. But I felt a light touch, and the dark sword slashed my arm roughly.\u201cIt hurts!!\u201dUnable to bear the pain, I roll backward on my back. I honestly failed. I should have endured the pain and seized Yamiyo before she get fully possessed. But I was only in junior high school when I got into a fistfight. I spent the rest of my life quietly until I became an old man. Even now, I have never been in a fistfight.I was cut by a sword. And I was a child. It was no wonder I was so pained that I was bending over backward. I took advantage of this opportunity and jumped up and down with all my might. I rolled backward, but quickly tried to get back up. It was a good thing I had practiced spinning backward. Even though I didn\u2019t awaken to mana, it saved my life.With my little hands on the floor, I stand up. A child has a squid belly and poor balance. So I stood up as hard as I could. The other party was also a little girl. I had no strength, so I tried my best to stand up.It must have looked like a silly scene from the side. Two children were sitting on the floor, curled up, and trying to stand up. If it were an athletic event, I would have cheered for them to do their best, but my life was on the line.I stood up faster than Yamito-chan and observed and understood what had happened.\u201c[Create Magic Weapon], huh? That\u2019s magic that wasn\u2019t in the game.\u201dThat magic was in the novel and wasn\u2019t in the game. That magic was [Create Magic Weapon]. In the novel, it is created from the enemy\u2019s hand and used to kill the protagonists as their finisher. In the game, they\u2019re not implementing it because of the equipment. Moreover, the sword in Yamiyo\u2019s hand seems to have a dark attribute.\u201cI see. Yamiyo has awakened to the dark attribute, huh?\u201dBeautiful lustrous hair like a raven\u2019s wet feathers. Beautiful eyes like black diamonds. I thought she must be working hard on her treatments, but I was wrong. She had awakened to the dark attribute, which is why she had such beautiful black hair and eyes.I deeply regretted coming to help her. I should never have come. It was my mistake to think that I could subdue a kindergartener. No hindsight is worth a thousand words, damn it.Blood flowed from my left arm, which cut in drops. My clothes were stained bright red, and I was sure I would bleed to death immediately. I thought that if I awakened, I might be able to do something about it, but unknown power not filled my body. I\u2019m a mob.I hear screams and yelling from around me. The teacher must have come. But my ears are ringing with bells, and I can\u2019t hear them. That is not good.\u201cDon\u2019t come!\u201dI yell to stop the teachers from coming closer to my blurry vision. If you underestimate her as a little girl. She\u2019ll cut you into pieces. It is often said that cutting without resistance is like cutting butter, right? But I was naive. Even butter has resistance. It is surprisingly difficult to slice through a lump of butter.But Yamiyo\u2019s dark sword cut through my arm without resistance at all. I didn\u2019t even notice that I had been cut.I had never thought that the power of magic could be so great. The adults must not have imagined it either. The teachers would be waiting for their future of being sliced into pieces, and rolling on the floor.\u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201dI may die. Then do the last act of filial piety and apologize to the unfilial one who will die first.I did my best to stop Yamiyo. I was a brave kid, you know.\u201cOya!\u201dI grab the bucket under the washroom fill it with running water and throw it at Yamiyo. She is weak because she has the strength of a child, but Yamiyo reacts and swings her sword.Normally. When the bucket hits the sword, it is bounced away and falls. However, the sword created by Yamiyo was too sharp. If anything, it could slice a human arm to the bone without resistance.The bucket split in two, obeying inertia, and split into pieces as it hit Yamiyo. Along with the small amount of dirty water inside and the wet rag.\u201cKiii!\u201dWith a screeching sound, Yamiyo flailed and peeled off the wet rag from her face. Meanwhile, I use the children\u2019s step ladder to climb on top of the washing station. I\u2019m out of breath and at my limit. My body grows cold, but I grit my teeth and stare at Yamiyo.\u201cCome at me, bro!\u201d\u201cDiediediedie.\u201dWhen I provoked her with my meager vocabulary, I don\u2019t know if the Wraith thought it was being made fun of or if it was out of spite for getting a wet rag in its face, but Yamiyo came after me, swinging his sword in a mess.The washroom concrete pedestal sliced away with spasms and no resistance. I wondered how she could make such a sharp cut, and I felt intimidated, but still grinned like a beast, as I had expected.I was still smiling like a beast because Yamito-chan cut through the faucet. The faucet cuts easily, but the restrained water doesn\u2019t. It spurts out like a fountain. It spurts out like a fountain and pours down on Yamiyo.\u201cGah!\u201dUnable to withstand the attack of the water that came crashing down with such force, Yamiyo hurriedly erases her sword and begins flailing, trying to wipe her face. That\u2019s what I\u2019m after.The water is not effective against the deadly Wraith. But it works on children. I believed that she would reflexively let go of the sword and try to wipe her face.\u201cWoah!\u201dWith a ripping cry, I jumped as I braced my legs against the pain. I jumped off the ladder as if to throw myself off.It was a kindergartner\u2019s jump. I would never have been able to jump off the ladder. But if I wanted to shatter her body, I would have to do it. I jumped to Yamiyo and hit her body.\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cGghh!\u201dThe two kindergartners fell, and I covered Yamiyo with a cushion. I reach out in a daze to restrain Yamiyo\u2019s arm, hoping it miraculously worked.If Yamiyo didn\u2019t have a sword, even the teacher could restrain her. That\u2019s what I was thinking. I can only say I was so disoriented from blood loss that I couldn\u2019t make a normal decision.It\u2019s because the true value of magic is not weapon creation.I realized this when Yamiyo pointed her fingertips at me, flailing wildly. I thought he was flailing around in agony, but when I saw the black aura gathering around her fingers, her complexion changed.\u201cSeriously?\u201dMagic. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s normal to attack with magic. The black aura contracted on Yamiyo\u2019s finger glows for a moment as I am stricken with despair that I failed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I Knew I\u2019m A True Mob Character[Dark Arrow]The light changes its form into a dark arrow and flies at me. I twist and turn to avoid it, but it is already too late. It hit me in the right shoulder and gouged out my flesh. I was blown away by the recoil.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dMy body rolls over and falls face down on the floor. I no longer know where it hurts. It hurts everywhere.\u201cDamn it. I lose to a wraith.\u201dI grit my teeth as I realize I\u2019m going to die. I had confused it with a game. I had thought that in a novel, even I would awaken or something. I wanted to cry because I was foolish.Even though this is the world of novels, it\u2019s reality, and I\u2019m a mob. I was a mob to the extent that I would be a dead kindergartener on tomorrow\u2019s news. I had failed.I couldn\u2019t even move a muscle anymore. It\u2019s over. I thought to myself as I lost consciousness.In a game, I would have pressed the touch button to open the status screen and taken a potion from the item box.It reminded me of a game from my previous life. The game was released when the novel was completed. People played it with a controller in their hand. People did it regardless of their age.I picked up the controller and pressed the control button.I imagined it.I imagined it again.And then I understood. I was a mob.I was reminded.Because.-Choose Your Job-In my consciousness, a translucent board appeared before my eyes, displaying a funny message. No, not funny. I have seen this before.It\u2019s character makeup at the start of the game. You decide your name, what your character looks like, and then your job. And that\u2019s the end of the character makeover.\u201cOh, yeah. Oh, damn. I\u2019m in character creation.\u201dKeeping my fading consciousness, I imagine the controller. No, the cursor moves just thinking about it.Several jobs appear that I know all too well. There are no hidden jobs, but it\u2019s shown me the basic and top-up jobs.There is only one choice now. It\u2019s the only job that helps me.\u201cIt\u2019s decided.\u201dI mutter in a whisper, and the message on the board switches.-Character Making Complete--Enjoy Your Magic Night-\u201cOh, I\u2019ll enjoy it. My Magic Night. Until the end of the night.\u201dI grin. Time to fight back, I think.Wraith are monsters with nothing but hatred and murderous intent toward the living. It was a monster that came from the recently created dungeon of immortality and was happy to possess the best body with a weak spirit and strong magical power. This body could kill and devour many humans, and it was amused and wanted to kill the surrounding humans.The wraith was more intelligent than other wraiths. So, as soon as the dungeon was spawned, the intelligent wraith slipped out.It took a lot of time and effort to defeat the unexpectedly small human, but he no longer fell and did not move. Its body must have collapsed into a pool of blood and was no longer dead.The owner of its possessed body noticed this and screamed in her head in grief. But that was only amusing to the wraith.The old woman-like face turns into an eerie smile of terror, and she looks around, ready to kill the other humans. There are still many humans. All of them have no magic power. It would be easy to kill them all. Its instincts tell it if it kills the humans, it can evolve to a higher level.However, its progress came to an abrupt halt. It was because it sensed a magical power that a moment ago it had only felt in this small human being.\u201c?\u201dWraith is sensitive to magic power. It can sense even the slightest amount of magical power. And yet, even though it hadn\u2019t sensed a shred of it until a few moments ago, it was puzzled by the new magical power it sensed.It looked around its field of vision and saw that it was coming from a person with a small body that it thought was dead. It was small magic power, but it was indeed magical power. Furthermore, it\u2019s impossible. Magic power can\u2019t be born suddenly and doesn\u2019t come out from anything. Even if people can\u2019t use magic, the magic power is there from the beginning. That is what the Wraith sensed.[Minor Heal]It can hear a murmur from the person who it thought was dead. The light attribute is the natural enemy of wraiths. A gentle white light covered the human body and healed it in a blink of an eye. His left arm was cut open, and even the bone was peeking out. The right shoulder, which had been gouged by [Dark Arrow], returned to clean skin without a scratch when the light subsided.And the fallen human\u2019s hair changed from black to gray. The beautiful hair shimmered with pure white particles and looked silvery.The small human stands up and puts his hands on the floor.\u201cAh, that\u2019s horrible. Is that what mob is all about?\u201dWhen he whispered something incomprehensible, the small human turned his attention to the wraith.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a tutorial, but I\u2019ll kill you. Be my first prey.\u201dThe human, who had the physique of a small child, smiled like a ferocious beast and confronted the wraith.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True Mob Is Just Like The AirConfronting the Wraith, I felt a different kind of fullness of power. The status of the Wraiths is also indicative of this.Level 1Priest I: \u2606HP: 12MP: 9Strength: 3Vitality: 3Speed: 3Magic: 3Luck: 3These are the stats as they were in the game. The Night of Magic is a novel. But because of its popularity, it was also made into a classic RPG game. A nostalgic RPG, it is a real-time turn-based game, depending on how fast you are, you may have multiple turns to fight.Even if I do the verification later, it was dangerous. Before I used [Minor Heal I], my HP was 1. I was about to die. It\u2019s dangerous.The Wraith that possessed haunts Yamiyo moving its old woman\u2019s face, distorted with hatred, and looking at me closely. I know, I know. It\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it? I understand that feeling.I awaken at the last minute. I\u2019m like a hero.But I realized that I\u2019m a mob. The game\u2019s specifications tell me I\u2019m a mob more than anything else.Well, anyway.\u201cDiediediedie.\u201dYamiyo points her index finger at me. She tries to gather a dark aura around it, but it won\u2019t happen.\u201cIt\u2019s my turn! Don\u2019t make a mistake in your turn!\u201dI turn my palm toward Yamiyo and use my job\u2019s unique skill. It\u2019s easy to use. Just choose the command in your head. The game specs are effortless to use. It\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?[Turn Undead]By using MP1, I flash a holy light from my palm. That light is the light of purification. The divine light illuminates the area, erases shadows, and attempts to purify everything.\u201cGaaaah!\u201dReceiving the purifying light, the Wraith blew smoke out of its body, twisted in pain, and moved away from Yamiyo\u2019s body. Then, it suffered pain in the air and scratched its body.I was relieved to see that. The specifications were the same as in the novel and the game. If it had been different, I would have been in trouble.\u201cRelieved.\u201dI support Yamiyo\u2019s body, which has lost its strength and is on the verge of collapsing, and I turn coldly toward the Wraith floating in the sky.\u201c[Examine]\u201dI can\u2019t use the magic that analyzes the enemy\u2019s power now, but I can still check it. That\u2019s the command [Examine]. The level of the Wraith is a little higher than mine, but if I use the game command, I can still examine the enemy.-Wraith, level 3-So I know the name and level. It\u2019s the world from novels, so its level may not be completely reliable, but it\u2019s still an indication. And level 3 is a piece of cake.\u201cIt\u2019s just annoying to be possessed. To prevent it, we got the main character\u2019s special skill [Magic Break] or the Magician\u2019s [Dispel]. And, the Priest\u2019s unique skill [Turn Undead]!\u201dThat\u2019s the job I took. That is Priest I. The unique skill \u201cTurn Undead\u201d can instantly kill a low-ranked immortal with 1 MP and weaken even the same level. Above all, it can release \u201cPossession\u201d.\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got it!\u201d\u201cI know, you\u2019ve not possessed someone, can only do low-level [Drain Touch]. But it\u2019s only my turn now!\u201dI turn my palm and use magic again. The magic priest with proficiency 1 can use are a unique skill [Turn Undead] and [Minor Heal I] of beginner-level Holy Magic I. So, there is only one option.[Minor Heal I].I use my healing magic on the old woman with a fearless, hate-filled look on her face as she approaches. Very gentle, isn\u2019t it?Just before her wrinkled hands are about to touch me, her body glows, and a faint healing light covers the Wraith.\u201cUggghhhh!\u201dOnce again, the Wraith writhes in pain, floating in the air and twisting around. It seems that he no longer has time to aim at us.\u201cWraith has a Holy-attribute weak point. If I exploit the weak point, I can cancel one action, but this happens.\u201dIn the game, if I hit a monster\u2019s weak point, I can cancel its action once. Then the next time you do it, I can\u2019t cancel its action again, but I was wondering what would happen. I see. But it\u2019s reality, so you can\u2019t let your guard down.\u201cWell then, goodbye.\u201dI turn my palm and use magic again. Wraiths are prey to any priests. So it\u2019s okay if you squeal.[Minor Heal I]Magic that anyone can\u2019t avoid. That\u2019s recovery magic. The others may have missed, but this one is a sure-hit winner. And for immortals, healing magic becomes deadly offensive magic.\u201cOooaaaa.\u201dWraith gives a final scream and disappears in silvery ashes. The demon that tried to kill me vanished without a second thought. No, was it purified because it was immortal? Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2013 Killed Wraith. Acquired 1 Exp. Acquired Magic Stone F-The Item Box filled with drops, and I finished my first battle. The dead spirit system is a sucker for priests but is a nuisance to other jobs. And since a priest can easily defeat most immortals, the experience is not very good.\u201cWell, I did it, so that\u2019s good. I thought I was going to die. Are you okay, Yamiyo-chan?\u201dOops, I change my tone. If my parents find out what I said, they\u2019ll be saddened that I\u2019ve become a delinquent.My teachers and friends were far away, so I\u2019m fine. Uh yeah, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll deceive everyone with my smile.\u201cOh, Oro? Huh?\u201dMy body wobbles and my blood starts to run cold. I used recovery magic, but what\u2019s this?\u201cNot good. The game settings lose to novel settings\u2026\u201dI wobble and fall. In the game, if I recovered, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. In the novel, there was something like this. If the protagonist doesn\u2019t collapse from exhaustion, the events don\u2019t start.Thinking of such nonsense, I lose consciousness and faint.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True Mob Is Just Like The AirWith a snap, I opened my eyes.\u201cIs this a hospital?\u201dMy blood pressure was measured with a beeping beep, and I got an IV needle in my arm. I move to mosey around, and the soft feel of the bed returns. It has brand-new sheets and a room that smells like medicine. No, it doesn\u2019t smell like medicine.The room was spacious, like a hotel suite. Luxurious decor, big TV, and refrigerator. Hmm? What a gorgeous private room. It must be expensive.I opened the status board because I\u2019m sad that no one was in the room. To open it, I imagine a controller and press the touch button. It is an unexpected way to call up the status board. If there is a god who reincarnated me in this world, I would like to complain about it. How am I supposed to know how to do this?Who would picture a controller and imagine pressing the touch button to open the status board? Unless you know it, you can do that, but if you don\u2019t know, it would take a miracle to know, damn it.\u201cHowever, I know I got reincarnated to be a complete mob in this world of The Night of Magic.\u201dI manipulate the icon and look at the item box, but all I see is a magic stone F. There\u2019s nothing left of my character or performance that I\u2019ve worked so hard on. It doesn\u2019t seem to work that way.\u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s just a reset. I have the jobs I\u2019m paid for. And if that\u2019s the case, the top-up should have affected other places. There\u2019s no problem here. And I\u2019m the mob.\u201dI was a player in The Night of Magic. Reincarnated and became a mob. Why is that?Novels and manga are made into games. If the pattern is to control the main character, there is no problem. The problem is the pattern where the player can make my character from scratch.In a normal game, the player plays as the main player character. The storyline also revolves around the main player character. But what happens if the game is based on a novel?The game\u2019s main character is the novel protagonist, and the main novel storyline is the main selling point, but here a problem arises.That ignores the player\u2019s character even though we are supposed to be in the same party. The conversations and stories progress only with the main characters of the novel.The main characters talk as if there were no players. Even if the player defeats all the enemies and the main characters are defeated, only the main characters are happy that they did it. The game treats players like air. In other words, we\u2019re a mob. I understand that they can\u2019t do anything because the story becomes strange when it gets entangled in the story, but this was terrible.I know it\u2019s a game for fans, but many games make me want to shed tears and say, \u201cI\u2019m here too, don\u2019t ignore me.\u201d.The Night of Magic uses that stupid pattern. The player is not involved in the main story, even in the conversation part. We\u2019re all just the air. If this were reality, you could cry.In sub-stories and hidden stories, the novel protagonists, on the contrary, do not participate in any conversations. It\u2019s worse than indifference in reality. That is bullying.This world is the game version of The Night of Magic, where you go through your hard work. You can\u2019t expect the story to be good.So, I\u2019m a mob, an air, as soon as I\u2019m a player character that I can make. I won\u2019t be involved in any storyline. No, but I might be able to go to the hidden story route. The main characters don\u2019t participate in that either, so I\u2019m still a mob.\u201cBut maybe it\u2019s good if I got reincarnated as a player character. I can be much stronger than the main character.\u201dI reconsider that this might have been a bad idea if I got reincarnated as one of the main characters. The novel is not a level-based world. The game version was created as level-based because it was an RPG game. The main characters did not level up by defeating monsters they were at a fixed level. The system was such that they would level up when there was a training event or something.In the game, I didn\u2019t need the main characters. It was a battle between players and summoned beasts and familiars only.When I thought about it, I felt much lighter. Thank goodness I was a mob. I can\u2019t do the training. I swore I would work myself to death, but if there\u2019s an easier route, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take it.\u201cI\u2019ll have to work hard to get stronger, but I\u2019m not going to have to work myself to death.\u201dMe leveling up, or gaining proficiency. It\u2019s going to be hard, but I\u2019ll manage, I thought, burying my head in my pillow. The difference between reality and games, or novels and games? Whatever it is, there will be a lot of things to check. This time, I had full HP, but I collapsed. Maybe I collapsed from anemia.I yawn. I am sleepy. I\u2019m tired because it was a big adventure for a 6-year-old.As I began to doze off, the door to the hospital room opened, and my mom enters with a vase of flowers. She rushes over to me, her eyes watering in surprise at me doing acupuncture.\u201cThank goodness you\u2019re awake, Mi-chan!\u201d\u201cOhayo~, Mama.\u201dI responded to my mom who hugged me tightly with an audible gasp. Sleepy. Very sleepy.I hug my mother tightly with sobs, and I hug her back, glad I didn\u2019t do anything impolite.I\u2019m glad. For now, let\u2019s just rejoice that I\u2019m still alive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s Like I Have A New Best Friend!My parents were furious with me a lot. It\u2019s hard to be angry while crying. It stings my heart, so I vow to stop doing anything dangerous. Let\u2019s fight with a proper safety margin.I\u2019m not going to stop fighting. Besides, I\u2019m a mob. If I were the novel protagonist, I\u2019d be in immediate danger even if I promised not to do anything dangerous anymore. But a mob player can fight the enemy after plenty of growth, so I\u2019ll probably be fine.Hopefully, this decision won\u2019t be a flag.\u201cI was surprised, you know? I never thought I\u2019d be fighting monsters.\u201d\u201cYes, Mii-chan. I thought our hearts stopped when we got the call, you know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Papa-Mama.\u201dI bowed my head and reflected on myself. It\u2019s not an act. I\u2019m sorry, I was naive. I was a kindergartener, but I was too reckless to fight with monsters. I guess I was still in a heroic mood.This fight made me realize that it was real. I had thought that monsters were unrealistic and could be easily defeated. This is my second life. I had to be careful with my life.My parents looked at each other when they saw me bowing my head, and then they looked relieved and patted me gently on the head. I smile, happy to see them. My spirit dragged along with my new body.In my previous life, I was unaffected by anything. The only time I was excited was when I won the third prize in the lotto; I had won five out of six, so I was happy that I had won the second prize of 10 million, but I was shocked when I realized that I had to hit the bonus number to win the second prize.\u201cMii-chan, the next time you see a monster, run away, okay? Ask a nearby adult for help.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dI lied there. Because I want to level up. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t give up on that. But since I\u2019m now supposed to awaken, can I become an adventurer? If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t need to put my all into exterminating monsters.My mom gently hugs me with a wry smile at my answer. I feel at ease as I smell her reassuring scent.\u201cBut it\u2019s admirable that you saved your friend. You did a great job.\u201d\u201cYeah, you did great, Mii-chan.\u201dHowever, the story ended with a nail stabbing that was no longer dangerous.\u201cBy the way, isn\u2019t this place expensive?\u201dThe conversation was over, so I said what was bothering me. I don\u2019t have much vocabulary, so I can\u2019t say it well, but there is a mahogany chest of drawers, a large-size TV, and even a refrigerator. I\u2019ll check later to see if there is juice in that fridge.And there is a sofa and a table. The spacious room is like a gorgeous private room where politicians stay when they are sick to avoid scandals. How much does it cost for one night?Even as a child, I was worried. My family must not be rich enough to afford such a room. I was sure my parent would tell me the house had been sold when we go home.\u201cWe didn\u2019t rent this place, you know.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t rent this place, Dad?\u201d\u201cYeah. To thank him for helping us.\u201dAs my dad was about to tell me why somebody rented this room, there was a knock at the door. My mom approached the door and rattled it open.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Takano-san. I heard that your daughter woke up. May I come to visit her?\u201d\u201cYes. The doctor told me that she is fine now.\u201dHe answered smilingly. I heard his grave and dignified voice, and he slunk into the room.\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad to see you are well.\u201dThe man who entered was an old man in a kimono. His shoulder-length hair was streaked with gray. He was a large man, taller than my father, maybe a little over 190 centimeters.His eyes were sharp and fierce. He was an old man with an intimidating face that looked charismatic and strong-willed. When he saw me, he lost his composure and approached me. Who could it be?But I understood when I saw his daughter walking behind him. What is it, Yamiyo\u2019s parent?\u201cMy name is Teijo Ouga. Thank you so much for saving my daughter.\u201d\u201cYamiyo-chan is my friend, so it\u2019s only natural!\u201dI answer in a cheerful and happy tone. This tone of voice appeals to adults. This old man, named Ouga, has an intimidating appearance. I feel like he is an old man involved in the main story.So, I searched my memory. I\u2019ve seen all of The Night of Magic anime. Yeah, I\u2019ve never seen an old man with such an impact. He\u2019s a mob with this look and name.Well, the main character is involved with only a few people when compared to the world population. They\u2019re like a drop in the ocean. But the setting of the novel is alive in the world. There must be an old man with a great name like this.\u201cMii-Sama!\u201d\u201cGhuuagh!\u201dWhile I was thinking about that, Yamiyo dash-tackled me. It was like a jackal rushing forward. I may be headed for the underworld again.I coughed, wondering if it was revenge for knocking her to the floor when I saved her, and then she puts her hand around my neck and kissed me on the cheek.\u201cThank you, Mii-sama. If the wraith had to continue manipulating me like that, I would have hurt many of my friends.\u201dYamiyo thanked me with a mixture of tears and giggles.She seems to remember what happened. Or perhaps her memory remained even though she was possessed.\u201cI was crying when I saw Mii-Sama getting covered in wounds. But I was so moved when Mii-sama used her magic to save me!

I think I\u2019ll be disillusioned when I spend my daily life. This world is also a world of fiction, so does that make it fictional?\u201cFather-sama, what is the suspension bridge effect?\u201dYamiyo didn\u2019t seem to know, so she tilted her head and asked Ouga. Ouga, hearing our exchange, laughs like a lion, and my parents giggle too.It\u2019s not funny, is it? It\u2019s the suspension bridge effect. Even if you save someone from terrorists at Christmas and makeup with your ex-wife, you still end up falling apart.\u201cThe suspension bridge effect is when, in a crisis, you mistake a pounding heartbeat for love.

We\u2019ll only be best friends more from now on!\u201dYamiyo tightens her neck in a squeezing manner. It\u2019s an attack that doesn\u2019t sound like a best friend. I give up.She must have been satisfied after giving me cheek-to-cheek kisses for a while. Yamiyo smiles at me with a gentle smile like a wildflower blooming and says.\u201cYour hair color is also lovely, Mii-sama.\u201dMy hair color had turned gray. Hmmm, not quite gray, but what about this color? It looks like something a foreigner would have. It might not look too different.I have a smooth, shiny gray hair color. My choice to be a priest had given me gray hair.I turn to my parents. They nod at me with gentle smiles.\u201cIt looks good on you, Miu.\u201d\u201cYes, it does. It looks great on you.\u201dI see my reflection in the mirror a short distance away. My gray hair is shiny and silvery.

In The Night of Magic, girls are pretty even when they are a mob.So I am a pretty girl too. My name is Takano Miu. I am 6 years old.\u201cAccept all the money for this room. It\u2019s my thanks for saving my daughter. Of course, I\u2019ll give you a proper thank you late. So you can look forward to it.\u201dI twitched at Ouga\u2019s words. A thank you. Lucky me. Then I have only one wish.\u201cThen, please buy me a super jumbo parfait from Harukaze!\u201dI cheerfully raise my hand and beg.I had always wanted to try this parfait. It was at a coffee shop I found on a walk once. I couldn\u2019t beg for them because they were 3,000 yen each.At these words, Ouga scowled and immediately laughed hysterically.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Eat a lot of food.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get a stomach ache, okay?\u201dWe created a heartwarming space there, and I began to doze off to remember how tired I was. A little girl\u2019s body got tired easily. They fall asleep like their body can be turned off with a switch.Well, I tried to start my nap, thinking I was happy to help Yamiyo more than anything else. There wouldn\u2019t be news about a mob getting killed by a wraith.(3rd person POV)Miu was a mob that got in trouble in the story\u2019s setting. Because a prominent-looking young lady like Yamiyo had never appeared in a novel. Nor in the anime.But as a matter of fact, Yamiyo was one of the sub-heroines in the novel.She is the eldest daughter of the Marquis Teijo, a rich family. In the novel, she appeared in volume 11. When she was a kindergartener, she got possessed by a wraith that appeared from a dungeon. She killed all the kindergartners. At that time, she was thrown out of her house and left in the care of a branch family.After that, she was abused and suffered, in the future, her hair became like wakame seaweed, her personality darkened, becoming an eerie-looking woman with dark circles over her eyes, and she became a dark messenger who joined an enemy organization. Even her voice changed to that of a \u2018kihihihi\u2019, an eerie tone.She is defeated and saved by the hero. She was a sub-heroine who suffered in the dark side of the world but got saved, fell in love with the hero, and became his stalker.However, due to her horrific childhood, and her unpopular appearance as a heroine. She got cut from the anime. There were numerous heroines in the novel, and they did not feel uncomfortable about the absence of any of them.The horrific scene where she kills kindergarteners was out in the anime.It is unclear how the future will change because of Miu\u2019s help. It is not surprising that Miu is unaware of it.However, she was an unfortunate character whose existence got erased in anime. According to the author in an interview during the production of the 5th season, if she cleans herself up, she will become a beautiful girl! The author was thinking about that development, but it seems there was no time to raise such an event because the author increased the heroine one after another.If there are other heroines like Yamiyo in the world where Miu got reincarnated is unknown at this point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Daughter Is Adorable-Miu\u2019s Mom POV-Takano Mirei is the mother of Miu. She had a beautiful appearance among the commoners, and although there was a succession of suitors, she married Takano Yoshiyuki. It was a love marriage. It could be called a great love story.She built a new house, lived there with her husband, and gave birth to a daughter. They have a happy family.I gently stroke my child\u2019s head, who is now sleeping peacefully on a fluffy bed in a private room for VIPs that Teijo-san has prepared for her.My child rubbing her head like a sweetheart is very adorable.\u201cI don\u2019t believe you fought the monsters and saved your friend. \u2026\u2026 I want to praise you, but I wanted you to run away.\u201dShe smiles gently at me because this child worries me. She\u2019s adorable, but she\u2019s also a strange little girl. That is my daughter, Takano Miu. She is the daughter I love most in the world, but when she does something out of the ordinary from time to time, I laugh and think back to the past.When I gave birth to Miu, I could not hide my worry.\u201cShe cries, but she doesn\u2019t move. I\u2019m worried.\u201dIt was my first child. When she was born, she cried energetically and showed no signs of abnormality, so I was happy that she would grow up to be a healthy child.\u201cYes, I know. I\u2019ve heard other people say that their child cries every night.\u201dMy husband also looked at the crib with a clouded expression. Miu would cry during the day, but she rarely cried at night. And she didn\u2019t move her body at all. It was natural to worry.She could be more active or at least move her arms. But Miu was quiet,\u00a0 too quiet. When we went to see the doctor several times to see if something was wrong with her, he told us, puzzled, that she might not be a very strong girl.So we decided to watch over Miu as if she were glasswork. Our fears that she might be frail passed quickly.Once she was able to crawl, she suddenly became very active. We were relieved. We had been worried that she might not be able to walk. But we were relieved to see Miu actively moving and I smiled at her adorable appearance.I lack for a better word, but she started doing strange things when she could talk. For some reason, she started to collect numbers.She would collect numbers and write them in her drawing notebook. After writing many numbers, she would twist her head and ponder. Then she would tap the notebook.When I told my husband about this, he laughed and then waved his hand.\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid. They get into all kinds of strange things. They get bored easily.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I guess.\u201dI\u2019m talking to the neighbors, and I heard some children do even more bizarre things. Some kids collect dust, some collect clean stones, and some collect dead insects. I nodded and thought, well, that\u2019s what children are I guess.Miu is a good girl. And she\u2019s an amazingly good girl. She probably thinks she\u2019s not what her parents want. She always tries to help me with anything and says thank you, and I love you. She tells my husband, and that alone makes him happy.Miu loves to be cuddled. I think I am spoiling her, but I can\u2019t help but hold her in my arms. The petite Miu is light and warm. She is our treasure.Once Miu entered kindergarten, she began to show her talent. Her kindergarten teacher funnily told us.\u201cEmpress? Our daughter?\u201dWhat a great nickname for my child.\u201cYeah, Miu-chan gets everyone involved in her play. If it\u2019s a game of tag, she prepares several demons, and when she\u2019s playing in the sand pit, she creates a masterpiece like a huge sand castle. She pays attention to bullies, calls out to quiet kids, and is known as the Empress, whoever gave her the nickname. They don\u2019t seem to know what it means, though.\u201dThe teacher laughs, giggling. It is a warm laugh, not a mocking one.I glance at the sandhill and see a huge castle like Osaka Castle left behind. I thought it was a lot of work to build that thing, but she was my child. She was too full of vitality. It seems the only time he was quiet was when he was a baby.\u201cBut since we play without separating the sexes, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m worried she\u2019s being influenced and using a little male language. Please warn him if he uses it at home.\u201d\u201cMan language?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more of a man\u2019s language or a rough tone. Sh sometimes says it when she\u2019s breaking up a fight or something.\u201dDoes Miu use a rough tone? The actuality is that you can\u2019t get a lot of these things. In front of us, she always smiles and begs us to hold her in our arms. I have never heard of a rough tone, but I will be careful. You should be careful with your language at an early age.My husband works at the Ministry of Magic\u2019s ward office and comes home on time. He helps with the housework and goes for walks and out to eat on his days off. He is a good man who has never forgotten our anniversary. He never uses a rough tone of voice. She must have heard this from another kindergartener.Lately, Miu has stopped collecting numbers by doing the stag beetle, dancing creative dances, and singing songs. She must be bored. I took many pictures of her adorable appearance and made an album.My adorable child dances, sing songs and is an idol in our home. I smiled and laughed, thinking she got influenced by the TV show.But that peace lasted until two days ago. I had finished my morning chores and wondered what to have for lunch.I heard the ringing of my phone, and wondering what it was, I answered the phone to find a kindergarten teacher says.\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency!! A monster attacked Miu-san.\u201dMy eyes went completely black. A monster attacked Miu? I had never thought that my beloved daughter would get attacked by a monster, although there have been occasional cases of monster outbreaks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Daughter Is Adorable-Miu\u2019s Mom POV-I immediately called my husband and headed for the hospital where Miu was. The monster had got defeated, although I could not quite make out the gist of the story.I rushed to the hospital and met with the doctor who waited for me. In addition to the doctor, a stern man stood there with a difficult look.\u201cMy child defeated the monster?\u201cYes. Sorry for Miu\u2019s shouting at me to stay away from them. However, Miu-san is safe.\u201dFrom the teacher\u2019s awkwardly summarized story, Miu was trying to save her friend who got possessed by a Wraith. I know the sound of a wraith and the word [possession]. But I\u2019m the wife of a husband who works for the Ministry of Magic. My husband had told me at least the minimum knowledge of demons. But there are some things I don\u2019t understand.\u201cIf a child was possessed, shouldn\u2019t the teachers have seized it? Why my child?\u201dPossession is a nasty attack. But an adult, let alone a child, could have taken it down. When I unconsciously raised my voice to denounce the attack, a man wearing a kimono bowed deeply.\u201cI apologize, Takano-san. Yamiyo awakened her [mana]. It seems she was also secretly practicing magic, whether someone taught her or herself, and it was dangerous.\u201d\u201cAwakened her [Mana]!\u201dI got taken aback. Mana is familiar, but it is also dangerous. Magic could kill those without magical power. Those with magic power can resist, but those without magic power cannot resist at all.\u201cIs my child okay!\u201dI grabbed the teacher by the shoulders and shook her violently, and she nodded back at me. If someone who can use magic was possessed, then my child must have received magic. My mind went blank with worry that she might get seriously injured.\u201cOh, please calm down. It\u2019s all right. I mean, Miu-chan was seriously injured.\u201d\u201cSeriously injured!\u201d\u201cBut she has already recovered. There is not a single injury. She\u2019s just sleeping now because she\u2019s extremely tired.\u201d\u201cRecovering? Did you call for a healer?\u201dRecovery. Did Miu use a potion? But if she was badly injured, it must have been a very expensive potion. Or a healer? Healers are valuable. A healer would cost tens of millions. No, it\u2019s not about the money. I calmed down a little, thinking I should be glad she saved. But her next words were disturbing.\u201cNo, she\u2019s not a using healer or a potion. Well, you can see that when you look at Miu-chan.\u201dThe teachers said apologetically. But I realized something strange at that point. There were doctors and nurses, but they seemed somehow happy and proud. Is there something going on?Wondering, I enter the hospital room. I was surprised when I entered. The room was luxuriously decorated. It did not look like a hospital room at all. I could have believed it was a suite in a hotel somewhere.\u201cTakano-san. This is a small thank you for saving my daughter. I hope you don\u2019t mind the cost of treatment here.\u201dI finally realized it when I heard the man wearing a kimono say something. This man is a nobleman. Yamiyo has played with Miu several times, but her last name is Teijo. He is a member of the Teijo Marquis family. I realized this, but more importantly, I had to confirm my child was safe.I see a painful figure lying on the bed with an IV drip. I approached the poor thing, and my mouth dropped open.Miu no longer had black hair.It had become gray hair. Miu\u2019s hair becomes a beautiful, lustrous gray hair. I know by the knowledge that it is shiny because of the mana in it.I also know the meaning of the color of her gray hair.\u201cCongratulations, Takano-san. She has awakened to the holy attribute. And she could use recovery magic out of the blue! I congratulate you on her awakening to the rare holy attribute.\u201dThe doctor tells us excitedly. The nurses also congratulated her, and the kindergarten teacher also congratulated her.I understood why the doctor and nurses were so proud. Because they had protected a child who had awakened to the holy attributes.I understood why my child was safe in the face of the deadly wraith. It was not because adventurers and warriors came to rescue her.I understood that she must have defeated the wraith herself. I quickly regained my composure.More than anything, I was relieved that she was still alive.\u201cYes. Mii-chan must have awakened her [Mana]. Whatever the case, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s safe.\u201dI pat Miu\u2019s head gently in relief. Her gray hair was smooth and very comfortable to the touch.I can\u2019t hide my surprise that she has awakened to mana. It is because it is mostly aristocrats and warriors with magical powers who awaken their [Mana].However, there is a problem. The children of nobles who are born without magical power rarely give birth to children with magical power, unless they marry a partner with magical power. For this reason, those who do not have magical powers are cast out and become commoners.\u201cIs Miu alright?\u201dShe must have come in a hurry. My beloved husband rushed into the hospital room sweaty and out of breath.Takano Yoshiyuki, the former second son of the Count Takano household, entered.My husband had a past of being thrown out of the Count\u2019s household for being useless.How would he feel that his daughter had awakened to a rare holy attribute? Would my husband be pleased? I am sure that the count family would not remain silent.Mirei, determined to protect her child, explains the situation to her husband.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I Swore To Protect My Child-Miu\u2019s Dad POV-Yoshiyuki gazed lovingly at his awakened child, who had dark hair and dark eyes three days ago, but now had gray hair and beautiful ice-blue eyes.With hair color that is evidence of her awakening to the holy attribute, my child is eating an apple my wife peeled for her with relish. Her smile is innocent and warms my heart.\u201cMii-chan, is the apple delicious?\u201d\u201cYes! They are very delicious. I love apples.\u201dMiu, who had been devouring the apple with her tiny mouth, stops eating because of my words and cheerfully smiles. Her adorableness made my cheeks relax, I patted her head, which made her happy, so I patted her more and more. I feel a little foolish for thinking that Miu is the only child who is this cute, but I\u2019m not wrong.I must protect her. I vowed once again that I would protect my wife and child. Just then. The intercom rang.This hospital room is for VIPs, and visitors ring the intercom to enter. However, it had been only three days since Miu collapsed. It was only yesterday that Miu, who had been asleep, woke up. If anyone would visit her, it would be Teijo-san, but it is a little late in the day.Looking out the window. The sky was beginning to turn orange, and it was almost the end of visiting hours. Teijou-san and the others just arrived a little while ago.Thinking it was impossible, I approached the intercom. My wife looks at me anxiously, and my daughter is crunching on an apple with a curious look. I swallowed hard and touched the call button on the intercom.The other person\u2019s face appeared on the monitor. It was an elderly man and a man a little older than me. The older man looked happy, and the other man looked frustrated and irritated, almost tongue-tied. He hasn\u2019t changed at all since the old days.\u201cOh, Yoshiyuki?\u201dThe first man makes a catcall that I have never heard myself. He is too obvious and too easy to understand what he is thinking.\u201cYes, what is it?\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Nothing. I heard that my lovely granddaughter was badly injured. I came to visit her as soon as I could. Don\u2019t stop me from seeing her, Yoshiyuki.\u201dThe elderly man who said this to me and the other man who looked grumpy had dull green hair, but I must say that their faces looked just like my own.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 Okay, Dad.\u201dIt would be bad to get into trouble here. It was a hospital, after all. Even if it was a man who had never visited the hospital since the birth of his granddaughter.In other words, the older man was my father, and the other man was my brother.When I opened the door, father and brother entered immediately. The butler followed behind the elder brother, and in his hand was a basket of fruits as a visitation gift.I could have stifled them here, but my desire not to let Miu see me arguing prevailed, and I let them pass by. My father smiles, and my brother sniffs evasively as he passes. OnlyYou-san, the butler who had also taken care of me when I was a child, gave me an awkward light bow of his head when he saw me, which was the only relief.How could he come to see his second son, whom he had thrown away because he did not have magical powers, with such a face? I can only say that he has thick skin. He cursed at me when he threw me out.My wife knows this very well. Therefore, I remained silent and bowed my head in greeting, but in the first place, my father had no interest in either my wife or me.He was interested in only one person. She was his granddaughter, Miu.\u201cOh! It is a beautiful gray. I was skeptical, but it\u2019s true!\u201dMy father breaks into a smile, looking genuinely happy. My brother clicks his tongue.\u201cGranpa, who are you?\u201dWith an apple in her hand, Miu tilts her head and makes a curious face. No wonder. She\u2019s never seen him before.\u201cI\u2019m Miu\u2019s grandpa. What, you didn\u2019t tell her about me?\u201dMy father replies with a smile to Miu, and signals to You-san with his eyes. You-san places a basket of fruit in front of Miu. The basket is an assortment of melons, grapes, and other fruits that cost a lot of money. He is not going to be stingy here.\u201cLook, Granpa brought a lot of delicious fruits for Miu!\u201dHe deliberately exaggerates, but it works wonders with children. Miu\u2019s eyes sparkle in front of the fruit.\u201cFruits! Thank you!\u201dMiu bows her head politely, and my father pats her head, acting like a good-natured old man.\u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl, Miu. Mirei-san, you gave birth to such a good girl. Thank you.\u201dMy wife\u2019s face was indeed tense at the sudden change in my father, who had not attended our wedding, did not give a congratulatory speech, and did not even care when Miu was born. No wonder. He\u2019s the kind of guy you can slap and kick out.\u201cTsk! Hey, you. Can you use recovery magic? Try it, Ora.\u201dMy brother bites at Miu in a thuggish tone. This is the tone he uses when he is in a bad mood. He must be very irritated.\u201cStop it, Arashi. I\u2019m sorry, Miu. Arashi is concerned about my back. I want you to heal it with recovery magic.\u201dFather chides my outspoken brother. But then he casually rubs his waist, his face contorted in pain. It was obvious what the gentle Miu would do if he acted like that.\u201cDo you have pain in your back?\u201cOh, yes, it does.\u201d\u201cI wonder if I can heal it.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you use it for a minute? Grandpa only needs Miu to use her recovery magic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I Swore To Protect My Child-Miu\u2019s Dad POV-Even if I stop them, I bet they will try to get Miu to use magic somehow. And considering that they might do something dangerous, it is better to let her use it than to stop her. I understand that it is impossible to hide it anyway.Miu turns her palm, which is as small as an autumn leaf, toward my father, meditates, and groans.[Minor Heal I]Father\u2019s body glows faintly for a moment. It was so fleeting that I might have missed it because of the faint light, but my father immediately rolled up his arms. I wondered why he rolled up his arms, but I was immediately astonished.Because there was a brand new bandage on his arm. It was soaked with blood.He was going to use his arm to check her recovery magic. What an obsession, I thought, and I saw a shred of insanity in it. He must have had to use his own body to be sure it was real.My father removed the bandage in a panic and rubbed his blood-stained arm, a look of glee on his face.\u201cLook! I thought I had cut myself a little bit too much, but now I don\u2019t even have a scar! It has completely recovered. It\u2019s healing magic!\u201d\u201cGrandpa, did your arm hurt too?\u201dMiu gives a puzzled voice to my father, who is looking at his arm for some reason, even though he asked her to heal his back. Poor thing. She wouldn\u2019t expect forced to heal an arm he injured himself.\u201cOh, Grandpa had a bloody arm too, but thanks to Miu, it\u2019s healed. Thank you.\u201dMy father is excited, his eyes blazing with an ugly light as if he has found his prey. It\u2019s worse because he is smiling with a good-natured expression, except for his eyes.\u201cThank God! Pain, pain, fly away!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. What a good girl Miu is. I\u2019ve never seen such a good girl in my life.\u201dMy father continues to stroke Miu\u2019s head with a smile he has never shown to my brother or me. Is it my imagination that I can almost hear a high-pitched laugh from his back?My brother looks more and more unhappy at the sight. I recognize that grim look, and it makes me worry about Miu.When he looked like that, he usually took it out on those around him, hitting servants and breaking vases and such. In the worst-case scenario, he would trap people he didn\u2019t like and put them in a terrible situation.Whatever the case may be, Miu was squealing with joy. She is an innocent good girl. I don\u2019t want to expose her to bad intentions.\u201cDad. It\u2019s almost time for me to finish your visit. I\u2019m sorry, but could you please leave?\u201dI tell him with a hint of coldness in my voice, and my father\u2019s hand that was stroking Miu suddenly stops and turns to me.\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll have to get ready to leave. When can Miu leave the hospital?\u201dThe good-natured smile he showed Miu had faded away, and he showed me the same cold face he had at Count Takano family.\u201cMiu will get discharged soon. So you don\u2019t have to come to visit her anymore.\u201dI clasped my hands tightly and firmly refused. It was a strong refusal with a strong will, something I couldn\u2019t do when I was with the Count Takano family It\u2019s different from the past. I have a wife and a child now. I am no longer the weak man I was in the past.He must have noticed that I have changed. My father and brother were slightly surprised to see me different from the old me. My brother must not have expected me to speak so clearly.However, the look of surprise easily disappears, and my father continues his story.\u201cI see. Then tell me when she\u2019ll get discharged. I\u2019ll send a car for you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll use my car. It\u2019s fine.\u201dI knew too much that my father wasn\u2019t the kind of person who would withdraw because of my implied message that he shouldn\u2019t come near me anymore. Predictably, my father shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, and responded in amazement. No, it was a tougher answer than expected.\u201cOh, come on, don\u2019t tell me you drive yourself,Yoshiyuki. And, I hate to say it, but isn\u2019t the car you drive a bit of a downgrade? Just leave it to me. I\u2019ll send the best car in the house to pick you up. Oh, we also need to decide on Miu\u2019s maid. Come and see which room she\u2019ll use before Miu leaves the hospital. The best and sunniest room will be good.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Miu\u2019s room?\u201dAt first, I did not understand what my father was saying. The words were so selfish and brazen that my head refused to understand them.I had naively thought that he would provide a car for Miu to visit him frequently. I knew my father was not the kind of man who would be satisfied with that much.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back in the Count Takanfamily. I\u2019ve reconsidered that living in harmony with my family is the best. Seeing such a cute granddaughter\u2019s face, I\u2019ve reconsidered that my family should not be on bad terms with each other.\u201d\u201cNo thanks. I have our own home.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, don\u2019t be so stubborn. We both had our faults. I apologize too. You should be honest, too. For the sake of my granddaughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 is not the place for this, so let\u2019s talk outside.\u201dEven though he unilaterally disowned me, people said we were both wrong. Moreover, he used Miu as a pretext to try to make up with me. It was a statement that made me angry in my chest, but I managed to swallow and bear it, and we decided to discuss it.I would never give Miu to him. I swore strongly in my heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True Malice Is Accompanied By A Smile-Miu\u2019s Dad POV-As Miu\u2019s father, I decided to confront my father, sitting face to face on a sofa in the hospital room. I consider it a confrontation.Because my father, Kazamichi, is more self-righteous and arrogant than his brother, Arashi. He reigned as the emperor of Count Takano family, where what he said was absolute, and people never questioned it.I was surprised to hear from him this time, even though I had not heard from him since I was 12 years old when I got paid money to break off my relationship with the family and thrown out. I had not expected to hear about Miu so soon.\u201cFather, no, Kazamichi-san, how did you get information about Miu so quickly?\u201dHe should not have been interested in those who don\u2019t manifest [Mana] at the age of 12 and don\u2019t awaken their [Mana] unless it is a miracle. They got judged to have no magical power. Until then, even if the magic power couldn\u2019t get measured, it was sleeping deep inside. There were many patterns of people suddenly revealing their magic power and awaken their [Mana], so they were being watched.I remember. I remember those eyes of disdain. Those who don\u2019t awaken [Mana], weren\u2019t needed in the Takano family, a prestigious family of wind magic users. I got labeled as being the same as garbage and thrown away. Because of my bad reputation. I was raised in a branch family, but even there, I spent my childhood abused.My personality wasn\u2019t distorted when I met Mirei, the daughter of a merchant who frequented the branch family. She was lively and cheerful, yet kind. No one in Mirei\u2019s family had awakened their [Mana], and she had always been a commoner. Because she sympathized with my situation and because I was close to Mirei, the eldest daughter, she taught me many things.I\u2019m capable, and because of the money I had as a small amount of severance pay, I made a large sum of money by making the right investments, considering the merchant\u2019s recommendations, even though I was young.I passed the civil service exam and worked for the Ministry of Magic, which offers a danger allowance. I have a danger allowance because there is a high possibility of being targeted by terrorists or attacked by monsters when checking dungeons.I now live a wealthy life for a commoner and have a happy family life with a kind wife and a lovely daughter.I believed that he would continue to live a peaceful and happy life. If only Miu had not awakened to the holy attribute. I don\u2019t intend to blame Miu. It is not Miu\u2019s fault, and I\u2019m he\u2019s proud of her spirit in trying to save her friend. I didn\u2019t want her to do anything too dangerous.I knew that Count Takano\u2019s family would get the message at some point, but too soon, I wondered.\u201cI wish I had heard from you, but there\u2019s a branch of the Takano family working at this hospital. They heard about Miu and were thoughtful enough to contact me.\u201dI was seized with a bitter thought that the hospital had a confidentiality agreement to keep personal information private, but it made sense. They must have contacted my father with glee to score points.\u201cWe must have broken our ties by now, Kazamichi-san. You said that to me in the past, didn\u2019t you?\u201dI look at my father as if to glare at him, but he must have noticed my intense gaze, but he replies with a cold smile and a nonchalant air.\u201cDon\u2019t be so stubborn. I know you\u2019ve had a hard time. I will entrust you with one of my companies. From what I hear, you\u2019re quite talented.\u201dI\u2019m annoyed by my father\u2019s arrogance, who praises me for my talent after calling me incompetent. How can he say such a thing? He had yelled at me if I didn\u2019t have magic, I wouldn\u2019t be in Count Takano\u2019s family. With tears, I let the memory of that incident remain firmly etched in my mind.\u201cDad! You\u2019re leaving the company to him!\u201dMy brother raised his voice at my father\u2019s unexpected words.\u201cShut up! The company you\u2019re running has been losing money lately! I\u2019ll leave it to Yoshiyuki\u2019s hand, who has business acumen.\u201dMy father blackmails my brother and glares at him, and my brother turns his head away awkwardly. My brother seems to be running the business so badly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kazamichi-san, but I just took my wife\u2019s father\u2019s recommendation to invest in the company. Even now, I work for the Ministry of Magic. I can\u2019t run a company.\u201d\u201cYou can run a decent business than this idiot. I\u2019m not in a position to run a company. I\u2019ll help you.\u201dMy father says cheerfully. I would\u2019ve been deceived if I had heard that line when I was a child. But I am an adult, and I have been exposed to malice my whole life.This man\u2019s goal is Miu. That is why I will not give in.\u201cI refuse.\u201dMy father\u2019s eyes open slightly in surprise at my firm refusal, but he quickly narrows his eyes as his previous attitude is a lie, and he exudes terrifying intimidation. A slight breeze blows from his body.\u201cDon\u2019t be selfish, Yoshiyuki. You know it too, don\u2019t you? The preciousness of the holy attribute.\u201d\u201cI know \u2026\u2026. 36 families of wizards are the pride of Japan. Each has about 100 attribute users, but only thirty have the holy attribute.\u201dI tell him to hide the fact that I am affected by this, as my skin feels numb from the intimidation.But then my father huffs and laughs at my words\u201cGrrr!\u201dMy cheek was pressed hard against the table when I thought I heard a dang strong sound.\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to put it, Yoshiyuki. That makes it sound like it\u2019s not a big deal to say it\u2019s rare. Hey, there are 200 million people in this Japanese Magic Empire. Of that number, 200,000 awakened their [Mana], and 20,000 have the magical power to fight monsters. About 36 families belong to this empire.\u201dMy father is holding my head tightly, and the pressure is increasing, making it more difficult for me to breathe.\u201cSome wizards can heal themselves. But how many can heal others? Hmmm? Will you tell me this, Yoshiyuki?\u201dHis tone is mixed with anger. He\u2019s angry that I defied and rejected him.\u201cOnly 30! Only 30 users of recovery magic! Out of the 200,000 wizards out there, only 30! The royal family, dukes, and marquises were each surrounded by high-ranking nobles. Recovery wizards who can heal people and are essential to conquer high-ranking dungeons! Do you understand how rare they are? A long-awaited recovery wizard has been born in our family! The whole family must protect him!\u201d\u201cMiu is our child! She is not your tool!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be selfish! Think about the future! You, a commoner, can protect Miu? Without the backing of the nobles? Of course, Miu would prefer the life of the rich! If she grows as a commoner! Of course, she\u2019ll resent her worthless parents!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of Miu! She\u2019s a good girl. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.\u201cHow can that be? How can you protect Miu without a backer? How can I protect Miu without a backer? Answer me!\u201d\u201cKuh. That\u2019s \u2026\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

True Malice Is Accompanied By A Smile-Miu\u2019s Dad POV-My father hit me where it hurts. Japan is a nation governed by the rule of law. The people are protected by law. I also know that \u2026\u2026\u2026 it is a pretext. The nobles\u2019 arrogance is rarely heard of. If Miu is known to be a recovery magician, there must be people who will try to get her. As a commoner, I have no way to prevent them.My father scoffs at my inability to answer.\u201cHmph. I see that even that idealistic head of yours understands. If you understand, then start preparing to move out. Take care of what Miu needs! Hrrmmm!\u201dSuddenly the pressure that was holding my head down disappears, and I become light. Coughing, I lift my head and see my father leaping over the couch and bracing himself with a grim look.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 Teijo-san, what are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cI had left an escort just in case. I heard the escort\u2019s report, and when I visited again, I saw that the parents of my daughter\u2019s benefactor were in terrible trouble. I think it\u2019s only natural\u00a0 I should help them, don\u2019t I?\u201dI turned around and saw Teijo Ouga, who looked like a fierce beast in a kimono, standing there with a cold look on his face. He must have done something. A translucent black aura swirled in his hands.\u201cThis is a family matter. I\u2019m sorry, but could you please refrain?\u201dHiding his fevered anger, my father tells Ouga-san.\u201cI have heard that your relationship has been cut. Count Takano family is not supposed to be related to Yoshiyuki-san.\u201d\u201cThey have been reinstated. Isn\u2019t that a common story?\u201d\u201cHow \u2026\u2026. Is that true, Yoshiyuki-san?\u201dThe two face each other, creating a sense of intimidation to the extent that the space is warped. Wang Fang asked me without paying attention in the midst of it all.\u201cNo, \u2026\u2026\u2026. I am no longer related to the Count Takano family. There is no relationship at all.\u201dHearing this commotion, the nurses and patients look at each other, but they quickly pull their faces back when they realize that it is a fight between nobles and between magicians. That\u2019s how dangerous a fight between magicians can be.\u201cDamn you! What the hell are you talking about? All you do is complain!\u201dMy brother becomes enraged at my words and grabs at me, his face turning red. A magician\u2019s physical ability is incomparable to that of an ordinary person. Even though he was only a few meters away from me with only one step, he would pack it in a split second.When I realized that my brother\u2019s hand had reached up to my neck, and then Ouga-san\u2019s arm was grabbing my brother\u2019s arm.\u201cGgh. This guy!\u201dMy brother\u2019s face was angry, and his hand was covered with a green aura, creating a swirling wind. The wind blew up his hair and swept his clothes.\u201cO Wind, gah!\u201dBut as my brother tries to release the magic, which is too dangerous for the average person, Ouga-san moves his hand with a bang. Then my brother\u2019s face tilts back, his nose sinks, his body shakes, and he sits flat on the floor.\u201cYou son of a\u2026\u2026..\u201dWith his nose bleeding, my brother glares at Ouga-san hatefully, his face contorted in pain, but Ouga-san is unperturbed. I guess this is what I mean when I say Ouga-san is of a different caliber.\u201cWhat do you think, Yoshiyuki? Let me, or the Teijo family, back Miu-san. Even though I say backer, I won\u2019t bind Miu-san to anything. It\u2019s just a thank you for saving Yamiyo.\u201d\u201cTeijo-san! You\u2019re trying to steal another family of their member!\u201dFather raises his voice in anger, not even looking at my fallen brother.\u201cYoshiyuki! There is no such thing as good news. Don\u2019t trust another family! They just want a recovery magician!\u201dIndeed, he may be right. Even if Ouga-san appears like a hero with a sense of justice, the reality is not so simple. Even if they protect Miu out of kindness, how would it look from a third party\u2019s perspective?Ouga-san is a cunning man who has successfully extracted a recovery magician from another family. Or a terrible person who forcibly took from a lower-ranked nobleman, who would use Miu\u2019s power. Even without binding her, if Ouga-san speaks of attacking dungeons, if he goes to exterminate monsters, Miu is likely to accompany him in return for the kindness she has received.But Yoshiyuki did not hesitate before the two options.\u201cYes, can I ask you for a favor, Teijo-san?\u201dWho would entrust my precious child to the family that had abandoned me?\u201cLeave it to me. Let\u2019s not let anyone mess with Miu-chan.\u201dOuga-san nodded with a slight smile, and Miu now had the backing of the Marquis Teijo\u2019s family.\u201cYoshiyuki! You will surely regret this! Teijo-san, don\u2019t think my family will remain silent like this!\u201dAnd the Count Takano family became my enemy.I don\u2019t know what will happen to this choice. However, my feelings remain the same. I\u2019m determined to protect Miu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Kindergarten Days Are OverI, fully awakened as a mob, am now a Priestess I. I\u2019m still weak, but I still have my chance. I would have preferred another job, but it doesn\u2019t matter because I can change my job in [My Home].I went from struggling to death to gaining strength through a struggle that would not have required me to die. Either way, though, it still takes effort.But since I almost died, I already went through the dying hardship. I guess I have cleared the conditions. But I don\u2019t know what conditions I have cleared.Now I\u2019m finally out of the hospital and in a coffee shop. The sofa is high, so I\u2019m swinging my legs and waiting to get thanked for saving Yamiyo.I was a pretty little girl with gray hair and ice-blue eyes. So much so that people passing by would look at me smilingly.Now I\u2019m waiting for my super jumbo parfait. My body is a little girl. I get caught up in enjoying sweet things. I liked sweets in my previous life, too.The coffee shop is decorated in a chic style, with several kinds of coffee beans on the shelves, and the good smell of roasted beans tickles my nose. The clientele didn\u2019t look like a bunch of grandmas, but elegantly dressed people reading English newspapers and enjoying their coffee.In my previous life, I could never tell the difference between coffee beans, I thought as I looked around. But I noticed something more than that. This coffee shop is strange.It is an upscale coffee shop in a residential area. It does not seem to be very profitable. The coffee shop has a low turnover rate, and because of the long queue of customers, their profits are low. But still, they would be in trouble if they didn\u2019t have customers. Even the grandmas would have to go into the coffee shop to make a profit, which is a small number of customers. Am I the only one who feels uncomfortable?I wonder how this store is run. The prices are high for a hobby. One cup costs 1,200 yen. It\u2019s a price that ordinary ladies would be hesitant to pay. No wonder the shop will be closed in less than half a year.The master of this coffee shop is an old man with dandy gray hair. To be honest, he looks suspicious. Is it because I think he is in a novel world? I suspect that he is an informant of some agency.Or a coffee shop that is for the main character. See, how often do you see that? A chic-looking coffee shop. The hero and the heroines visit there often. That is the coffee shop in the background. I might add that the master plays the role of a reluctant adviser to the hero.What contributes to the sense of discomfort is the super jumbo parfait. It is a menu item that does not fit in this coffee shop. The fact that it is 3,000 yen also makes it easy to handle as a small item. Wouldn\u2019t it be possible for the heroines forced the hero to buy them a drink?I\u2019ve only read The Night of Magic up to volume 10. The game had a weapon shop, a tool shop, a restaurant, etc., but that kind of stuff is not supposed to be memorable. The final volume, volume 25, is all battle scenes with demons and enemy bosses who resurrect demons, and there is not a shred of daily life in it.When volume 10 was released, it was more than 15 years ago, counting from when I died in my previous life. If I add my current age, it was more than 21 years ago. My memory has very little detailed content from that long ago. All I have is the erotic armament of a female character with a lot of exposure and the character\u2019s face. I don\u2019t even remember their names.Usually, I don\u2019t. I remember the story now, but it\u2019s unclear if my memory even remains until my school life when the main character appears. Well, I manage to remember the main plot. I think that\u2019s normal.There are lives at stake, though, and I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t forget the game\u2019s specifications. I can press a button, and the status board appears right in front of me.Just in case, I\u2019ll leave the story and game strategy information in a code that only I can understand. If I write the title as \u201cFinal Dragon Reincarnation,\u201d no one will think I am talking about this world. If they do, they are perverts or gods. Even a genius can\u2019t come up with that.\u201cMii-Sama, I can\u2019t wait for you to come. I\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019m looking forward to it, Yamiyo-chan. I can\u2019t wait for the parfait to come.\u201dI\u2019ve got reincarnated as a girl. So I\u2019m playing the quiet girl, so my parents don\u2019t worry about me.With my ice-blue eyes sparkling, I glance at the master. I can see him making a parfait instead of coffee, but my body feels restless.\u201cHmmm, I wonder if Mii-chan can\u2019t wait?\u201d\u201cYes! Because it\u2019s this big!\u201dI spread out my hand and raised my voice full of anticipation. The surrounding customers were looking at the little girl with a smile.Acting is also difficult. Yes, it\u2019s my act. I wonder if I will come soon.The picture on the menu list shows a beautiful parfait bowl with lots of fruits, whipped cream, and ice cream. I\u2019d expect more if I didn\u2019t have to pay, right?The people who came to eat the parfait were me, Yamiyo, her mother, and Yamiyo\u2019s maid. Yamiyo\u2019s sitting next to me, and her mother and maid are sitting opposite me.Ouga was too busy to come. Well, anything is fine as long as he buys me a drink. I was surprised to see a maid, a scary-looking woman of about 30 years old, who also works as a guard. She seems to be a magician who also works as a bodyguard.In this world, there are usually maids who work for nobles. To be honest, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s indeed its world of novels. More to the point, maids are usually young and cute, but it seems except maids around the main characters, people choose maids who are skilled and experienced as if they conform to reality. Then again, there\u2019s usually no such thing as a girl.\u201cSo, \u2026\u2026 Mii-Sama, I\u2019m officially going to practice magic. Would you like to practice with me?\u201dYamiyo comes looking at me with her fidgety fingers intertwined. Her sparkling black diamond-like eyes reflected my appearance. The fact that the pigtails swayed made me want to touch them a little was proof I have a younger mind because of my body.But practice magic? Hmmm, I want to increase my proficiency. I awaken my [Mana] or deciding on a job, I can use magic. That\u2019s a game specification, so I need to make an effort and learn magic.But I want to learn the game\u2019s magic first. I\u2019m curious, though. It\u2019s a system where if you increase your job proficiency, you\u2019ll learn more magics. But how do I learn magic, you ask?\u201cHow do you practice magic, Yamiyo-chan?\u201d\u201cThe Teijo family specializes in the non-attribute and the dark attribute. That\u2019s why I secretly learned them from the maids. I can only use two of them yet.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s great!\u201dShe smiles smugly, but two things are that dark sword and dark arrow right? That\u2019s the magic that almost killed me, right? Why does the maid teach her such dangerous magic? Teach her a little more mature magic. How can you teach that kind of magic to a six-year-old child? I thought I\u2019ll die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Kindergarten Days Are OverWith jittery eyes, I glare at Yamiyo\u2019s exclusive maid. You taught her that, didn\u2019t you?Looking into Miu\u2019s ice-blue eyes, the maid shakes her head. Hm?\u201cThat lady-in-waiting has been reassigned elsewhere. After all, it was dangerous magic.\u201dThe maid informs me in a not-so-silent language. I don\u2019t know the difference between a maid and a lady-in-waiting, but the maid\u2019s eyes told me what was happened with that lady-in-waiting. Yamiyo doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed, but. Could this have been behind the scenes? Was it just a coincidence that the wraith appeared and was trying to do something?It\u2019s the Marquis family. It\u2019s not surprising that there is a conspiracy. Well, I think it\u2019s already taken care of. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for that lady-in-waiting to sink to the bottom of the sea.If this were the main character, events would have started, and he would have exposed the mastermind and exterminated them, but alas, I, the mob protagonist, probably won\u2019t be involved. I think that\u2019s the end of this story.Nobles seem to have this kind of thing happening all the time.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Mii-sama. Even though you got hurt by my magic.\u201d\u201cNah. I was fine, and that was the ghost\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not your fault, Yamiyo-chan!\u201dMiu laughs to cheer her up with a nip, and Yamiyo looks up.\u201cMii-sama, you\u2019re so kind. I love you!\u201dI comfort the despondent Yamiyo and hug her. Then Yamiyo clings and nuzzles my cheek. The warmth and tickling make me smile too. I\u2019m a little embarrassed by the skinship. In my previous life, I was single and didn\u2019t have female friends who cuddled with me like this. I had girlfriends when I was younger, but they weren\u2019t this clingy.\u201cMore importantly, did you learn magic easily?\u201d\u201cYes. It was a little hard, though. I heard that we can use some magic instinctively.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just as the young lady says. The young lady has awakened to the dark attribute. I heard that Miu-sama, who awakened to the holy attribute, could use recovery magic instinctively.\u201dI nodded in agreement. My instincts are game specs, so they don\u2019t seem to have anything to do with it, but I\u2019ll keep that a secret. But Yamiyo\u2019s using such dangerous magic on instinct? Yamiyo is a dangerous girl.\u201cBesides, Mii-sama is a recovery magic user with a holy attribute. I\u2019m afraid the Teijo family doesn\u2019t have the know-how.\u201dAfter she hears about the holy attribute, Yamiyo\u2019s mother\u2019s face turns slightly thoughtful. Is there something there? I haven\u2019t seen the old man who brought fruit to visit me since then. My parents don\u2019t talk about it either, so what\u2019s going on?\u201cEh~! Can\u2019t you practice with Mii-sama?\u201dEven as I\u2019m thinking about it, the maid quickly utters a follow-up as Yamiyo becomes sad when she hears it.\u201cNo, Miu-sama could use simple life magic outside of the attribute. If she goes to the academy, she will be taught, but before that, the nobles will be taught at home.\u201d\u201cThen come study with me!\u201d\u201cYes! I want to try something called life magic!\u201dHolding hands with Yamiyo, I smile and get excited. Yamiyo\u2019s mother and maid smile, their eyes relaxing at the contrast between the gray and black contrast of the little girl\u2019s adorable appearance.\u201cThanks for waiting for the Super jumbo parfait!\u201dTwo parfaits are placed with a thump. Oh, they are bigger than the menu.\u201cIt\u2019s so big!\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201dIt\u2019s a gorgeous parfait in a sparkling parfait glass, with whipped cream, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, strawberries, and apples on top, in a large glass about 30 cm long.\u201cEat slowly, Mii-chan.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dI\u2019m the one who\u2019ll beat this parfait. I\u2019ll show you how to handle a spoon. With a snort, I grab the parfait.With a shaky spoon, the parfait appears! What a surprise.Hmmm?[Parfait A has appeared!]\u2013 I fight.\u2013 Running awayWhat\u2019s this?Miu turns her ice-blue eyes and is puzzled. The gray-haired little girl freezes with her spoon.It seems that my game specifications are still there. My body still hides some deep secret.

Another ReincarnatorThe Japanese Magic Empire. In the upper class, some wizards protect people from demons as nobles. The class society is absolute. Because physical attacks that aren\u2019t accompanied by magic power do not work on monsters of the middle class and above. Humans cannot defeat monsters unless they attack with magical power. Therefore, commoners cannot oppose them. It is a world where it is impossible to overcome the underdog.In the aristocratic district of the imperial capital. There is a luxurious mansion in a prime location where high-ranking nobles live, a short distance from the imperial castle where the emperor of the empire resides.It is a luxurious and gorgeous mansion. It is a Western-style building with vast grounds. The garden is spacious with a fountain, and the plants and trees are well-pruned so that even if many guests are invited, there will be enough space for a party. The mansion itself is also full of history.The house was the residence of one of the best wizards in the capital. It is the residence where the fire-attribute wizard, Aguni Masatoshi lives.He is a nine-year-old boy with fiery red hair and a face like a beast. His face is second nature, but he has a violent temperament. Even as a boy, his twisted personality is on display, and a good person would be sorry to see him.The long, shaggy carpets, small chandeliers on the ceiling, sofas, tables, chests of drawers, and furniture are all of the highest quality, and one of them alone is worth several years of a commoner\u2019s annual income.And the winning outfit is, of course, custom-made from brand-name products. One piece of clothing costs several hundred thousand yen.\u201cYoung master. It is time for us to leave for the dungeon.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be right there. Get ready. Ah, it\u2019s a fire-sensitive enemy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes, young master. I\u2019ve also confirmed that it\u2019s a newly created dungeon with only three floors.\u201d\u201cThen good.\u201dHearing the butler bow, and call out to him, Masatosh, being a young child, replies with a pompous attitude comparable to that of an adult.\u201cYes, sir\u201d, I snorted when I saw the butler leaving the room.\u201cI was in a hurry to make it in time for the summer Comiket, and I died, but I don\u2019t think I got reincarnated in as a mob.\u201dThe man was originally a young man. He slipped and died while climbing a high-speed escalator in a hurry to go to Comiket in the summer.\u201cI\u2019m a young master. No matter how many times I hear it, it\u2019s itching.\u201dInside Masatoshi\u2019s body was not that of a child. It was the soul of a man who died in another world.\u201cI never thought I could be reborn in The Night of Magic world. It\u2019s great. And I\u2019ve reincarnated as a mob.\u201dMasatoshi used to be a young man. He was in a hurry to get to the summer Comiket and was climbing a high-speed escalator when he slipped and died.\u201cThat old man should have taken it at least as well as I did. It\u2019s the duty of those standing to the left.\u201dMasatoshi was running up the escalator and slipped. But in such a case, it is normal for those standing on the left side to catch him. Masatoshi thought so.Escalators are for climbing. The lazy ones who stand there leisurely and do not climb should at least catch the people who are about to fall. They are getting in the way of people running up the escalator. Since Masatoshi thought so, he felt nothing except irritation toward the old man who fell without catching him. He even hates him.Masatoshi\u2019s body was in severe pain, and when he died, all he felt was resentment. He had planned to buy a doujinshi of The Night of Magic written by a famous artist for this Comiket. Other than that, he was a freelancer, so there was no problem, especially considering his uncertain future.\u201cWell, okay. This is [Night of Magic], and I\u2019m a genius flame user who gets beat up. The eldest son and heir of the Dukes of Awakuni.\u201dHe chuckled. He thought he was born as the eldest son of a rich man at first.In Masatoshi\u2019s previous life, his family was poor, and he could not even go to college. The schoolteachers told me he didn\u2019t have enough academic ability, but he could get into any university if he put enough money on the table. His parents also told him they would not allow him to go to college because he was lazy and skipped school frequently. They should have told me honestly that they were poor.But now Masatoshi was reincarnated as a rich man. At first, he thought he got reincarnated in another world, a slightly different Japan. But no problem. The important thing is that he is rich. In his previous life, even rich people didn\u2019t have maids and butlers, which even rich people didn\u2019t have, and he could have anything he wanted. he was happy that it was the best.That was until Masatoshi turned 5. When he turned 5, he was surprised. His father showed me how to use magic. What? He was amazed and realized the meaning of his name.Masatoshi was a genius flame wizard in The Night of Magic. He is the eldest son of the Dukes of Aguni, renowned as a flame user household. Masatoshi is a genius who was said to rank A in wizardry even without trying. Of course, being a genius flame user and the eldest son of a duke, it\u2019s a template. When he entered the school, he tangled with the protagonist and got beaten up by the hero. The role only enhances the hero\u2019s strength by beating Masatoshi to a pulp. After that, Masatoshi is called a pathetic guy and stripped from his position as the heir apparent of the duke\u2019s family. When Masatoshi occasionally appears, he gets beaten by an enemy organization that invaded the academy. He escapes when he encounters a horde of monsters. He is a mobster who gets beaten up by the enemy.But Masatoshi knew he would win. The potential for victory in this underdog role is high. The author said in an interview. If he really tried hard, he would have had a power close to that of the main character.\u201cI was reincarnated as a mob. I am a mob, but a highly capable mob. I am Aguuni Katsutoshi-sama.\u201dMasatoshi was lucky. If he could be like the hero if he worked hard, he should work hard. It was the same development he had often seen in his previous life. If he is reborn as a villainess, he should use his potential to surpass the hero. he has money, power, and talent. If he does it right, the hero will be no match for you.Masatoshi can win in the same way. He just has to work hard. If he does, he won\u2019t be the one to be beaten.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Another ReincarnatorMasatoshi, who was a big fan of The Night of Magic, had read the story, the enemy organizations, and the novel\u2019s setting, and knew everything about it. I also considered myself a god-like being. The game version was said to be a destruction of the original work and was made by taking the best parts of other famous game blockbusters, as a fan of the original work, I did not even touch it.They added some challenging elements for gamers, but all the magic was appropriate, and there was no such magic in the original work, such as the Flame Arrow I. What the heck is \u201cFlame Arrow I\u201d? The attributes, summons, and everything else were all copied from other games, and although the game became quite popular among gamers, as a fan of the original, I swore I would never play it.Well, I don\u2019t care about the game version. This is a novel world, and I am a talented character, awakening my [Mana] at the age of seven. My body is the same as the original version. Because of my serious training, I\u2019m already C-ranked at 9 years old. If I continue my training in body art and magic, I will be able to defeat the protagonist.However, I did not intend to make it a development in which the normal mob would play an active role. Because I didn\u2019t mean to be polite.-3rd person POV-Masatoshi in the original story is a violent person who easily beats people up. He was a man who took it out on his servants and turned his magic on them. Because of this, his brother, who later becomes the hero\u2019s companion, defeats novel Masatoshi\u2019s position as successor, but I decided to go along with the original story.That is known as a \u201cSama-chan\u201d (a return to the original story).The triumphant fall begins with the protagonist\u2019s involvement at the time of his entrance into the school. The protagonist was originally the eldest son of a duke. However, his [Mana] did not awaken, and he got thrown out. At that time, a witch picks him, and he turns out to be a user of the void attribute, and after training, he enters the academy.That is a template, where Masatoshi cursed the hero because of why the hero could enter the school, wanted to expel the hero, made a fool of the hero, and had a duel. The situation at that time is the bottleneck.When Masatoshi makes fun of the hero, his former fianc\u00e9e from the Marquis\u2019 household defends him. She is angry at the hero before the duel and tells the hero that Masatoshi is stronger than the hero, and then they duel.Masatoshi remembers the conversation that ensued.\u201cIf I win, you must be my obedient pet.\u201d, Masatoshi says to his fianc\u00e9 girl. Of course, the girl answers, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d The duel begins, Masatoshi gets beaten up according to the template, and the downfall of his life begins. It will be a wonderful situation.-Masatoshi POV-\u201cBut what if I win? Heh heh heh.\u201dThe girl I\u2019m engaged to have a proud personality. If I win, she won\u2019t complain about being treated like a pet. I\u2019m excited about that. I can do the thin book development myself. I make her sit on her midriff and order her to stick out her tongue. I love to see a proud woman\u2019s face as she endures humiliation. I love the look of a proud woman who has to endure the humiliation of a woman knight.I know the hero\u2019s weakness from novels. If I put in the effort, I am sure I could win. The hero would never imagine I would know his weakness. If I play my cards right, I may be able to defeat the hero with a single blow. I can\u2019t wait to see the looks on everyone\u2019s faces.I\u2019ll take heroine is taken from the insensitive hero by force. How fun that sounds. I\u2019m going to take away the other events, and steal the heroine. If I have enemies that are stronger than me, I can force them onto the hero.That is what makes being reincarnated as a mob worth it. It was still a long way off, but Masatoshi was grinning and looking forward to the future.I am a big fan of the original story, and if I came to that world, I would want to be the hero. I want to be a hero because I have powerful powers. That was impossible in my previous life, and even though I was a big fan of the original work, I was a piece of trash compared to it.\u201cYoung Master. The car is ready.\u201dThe butler tells me as he opens the door.\u201cOkay. I\u2019m on my way.\u201dI had never done such a pompous attitude in my previous life. I laughed, glad to have been reincarnated.I set off gracefully, legs crossed, in a magically-impregnated, armored limousine, to head for the dungeon. Besides Masatoshi\u2019s ride, several other cars with escorting adventurers follow.\u201cWhat\u2019s the dungeon like?\u201dThe Night of Magic has a dungeon in the background. However, the novel did not carry that much detailed information. Because it was a school fantasy rather than a dungeon story, there were several volumes of dungeon attack stories, but there were no detailed descriptions of the hierarchy.Today is the first time I do attack a dungeon. Although I don\u2019t plan to attack a dungeon only through combat, I was a little anxious.\u201cYes, Young Master. This is the dungeon of the immortals. All the monsters are weak against fire, so I thought it would be just right for your first battle.\u201dThe butler knew the kid was a strong magician, personality aside. However, he chose a dungeon that looked easy because of the eventuality of combat.\u201cMagic stones are cheap, and immortal materials are astringent..\u201d\u201cOh, no problem. I have plenty of money.\u201dWith a wave of my hand, Masatoshi did not care. It\u2019s because I was the son of a duke. There is plenty of money to roar about.\u201cAlso, I heard that the eldest daughter of the Imperial Marquis family is also training in this dungeon.\u201d\u201cThe Marquis family? Who\u2019s the eldest daughter of the Imperial Castle family?\u201d\u201cTeijo Yamiyo-sama, isn\u2019t it?\u201dYamiyo? Ah hmm? That dark-rooted wakame? I can\u2019t describe her, but she\u2019s in a place like this. It\u2019s hilarious.The name Yamiyo sounds familiar. I believe she was left in the care of a branch family and bullied during this period. She was another character that I didn\u2019t like. She was dark, and her character was creepy. On top of that, she was a stalker, and the way she spoke irritated me. I used to wonder on message boards why the author wrote that character. I laughed so hard when they cut her out of the anime.\u201cIf I see you, I\u2019ll abuse you a little, kukuku.\u201dMasatoshi left it in the corner of his memory, as he didn\u2019t particularly need to worry about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Now 9 Years Old!Takano Miu is 9 years old. I\u2019m 9 years old. I evolved from a pretty little girl to a pretty teen.My hair is still beautiful, silvery, smooth gray, extending to my back. I have sapphire ice-blue eyes, a cute nose, and a small mouth. My small face will make anyone passing by the turnaround admire my cuteness.As always, I\u2019m level 1, Priestess I, with proficiency 1. I haven\u2019t grown at all since I was 6 years old. My status is now all 4, though. It seems that the normal amount of growth has added up.It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have any battles with monsters. I had to kill monsters to raise my level and proficiency. I later realized that The Night of Magic shows you as having killed an enemy, not defeating one.That is an unusual expression, but it\u2019s a problem for my growth.Can a 6 year old girl enter a dungeon? If this were medieval fantasy, I could sneak in. But this world has firm checkpoints. Young girls were not allowed inside. I could have managed if I had skills in other jobs, but she would have to defeat some monster.It\u2019s all about eggs first or chickens second. Damn.\u201cThis is the dungeon?\u201d\u201cYes. That is what people call a dungeon.\u201dYamiyo, standing next to me, nods and draws a black sword from her waist.Inside the dungeon, I see a desolate land spread out. The sky is a ceiling of dimly glowing earth. A wide and distant place narrowed the road like a canyon. I guessed that I could enter the next area through that canyon. Behind them, the entrance we had come in through was a gaping hole.That\u2019s a few miles away. It was small in the game, I understand, the size of the area when she battles with the enemy. The scale changes drastically. That\u2019s where it differs from the game.\u201cAre you nervous? Mii-sama?\u201dYamiyo smiles softly, shaking her wet, black-haired pigtails like a black-feathered raven. She\u2019s only 9 years old, but she\u2019s a girl who makes you think she\u2019ll be beautiful. She is still very young, and cute, but she\u2019ll make people feel she is a beautiful woman.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mii-sama. We have our guards, and if you\u2019re in danger. I\u2019ll protect you!\u201dWith a smile, Yamiyo\u2019s chest heaves. It\u2019s still a young, flat chest. I chuckle. Yamiyo grumbles and puffs out her cheeks, and then complains,\u201cMuuh, you don\u2019t trust me, do you? It\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u201cSorry, sorry. I trust you, Yamiyo-chan.\u201dI stick my tongue out in a small tehehe, and when I replied mischievously. It\u2019s a playful conversation between best friends.\u201cYamiyo-sama. Miu-sama. It\u2019s about time the enemy attacked. Please be careful.\u201dThe teacher who taught me magic and how to fight for the past three years is paying attention. He is a teacher who was a former B-rank adventurer. He is a magic swordsman who is good at both swords and magic. Since his attribute is no attribute, his black hair and black eyes have not changed. He is an instructor of the marquis family, and he is a middle-aged man who was rumored to be quite skilled.\u201cOkay, I understand. Then [Activate].\u201dYamiyo puts mana on her body and sends power to the leotard-like garment attached to her body with a beaming smile. She wears jeweled shoulder pads, breast pads, and hand and leg armor, but the rest is a tight-fitting leotard.Covered with a faint glow of mana, a magical barrier is stretched over her entire body to serve as a protective barrier. The magic circle in the shoulder pads and breastplate is activated to protect the body.With a metallic sound, a line of light runs across the entire armor. As if to indicate that it has fully activated, the armor deforms slightly to deploy its armor.It is the erotic \u201cMagical Armor\u201d of The Night of Magica. All the women\u2019s versions have the same specifications. This erotic armor is one of the reasons why The Night of Magic was well received. It\u2019s easy to understand. It is a prerequisite for increasing the number of adult fans.Incidentally, men are gradually becoming more heavily armored. It\u2019s just a theory. It seems that the inhabitants of this world don\u2019t question it. For some reason, women find it easier to use magic that way, or another reason, I thought.The problem is me.\u201c[Activate], [Activate]!\u201dEven though I force myself to Activate it, the armor doesn\u2019t glow. Today is another Activate failure.\u201cIt\u2019s still no good~.\u201dIt is I, a disappointed gray-haired beautiful girl who.\u201cMii-sama is strange, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cUmmm, Miu-sama doesn\u2019t seem to be able to activate her armor well.\u201dYamiyo lowers her eyebrows in a hemming motion as if she is troubled. The instructor makes a troubled face. I look crestfallen.I can\u2019t activate my magic armor. To put it correctly, I can Activate it, but I can\u2019t start it. That is ridiculous.It\u2019s Yamiyo, me, the instructor, and nine guards. A total party of 12 people, but I\u2019m the only one who can\u2019t activate it. But even if I show signs of trouble, some guards and adventurers are deployed around me. Even if I can\u2019t activate my armor, the fight begins. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m cold. There is no problem.It\u2019s a wasteland, but there are hills and dead trees, and it\u2019s not flat. You can get to the top with a few jumps in the game, but the hills are high.The adventurers, glowing in their magical armor, scouted the area. Soon one of the adventurers contacts us with his hand over his ear. The instructor nods yes and turns to face us.\u201cLooks like we found eight skeletons, three at 10:00, five at 2:00.\u201dWe are communicating through the intercom. Unlike the intercoms of my previous life, this communication uses magic, and the instructor\u2019s eyes must see the other\u2019s image as a hologram. Miu knows because she tried it herself.It\u2019s novel and cool to communicate by seeing the other person\u2019s face. That\u2019s what Miu thinks.At any rate, they have confirmed the enemy. Miu has trained a lot, but at the 9-year-old level, it\u2019s not beyond the realm of play. My heart pounded. It\u2019s not loveA skeleton appeared over the hill, crunching bones. A white-boned corpse comes clacking closer, but I\u2019m not too scared. Maybe I\u2019m too used to it from movies. There is a club in its hand, and it won\u2019t hurt if it hits me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Now 9 Years Old!\u201cHere I come!\u201dYamiyo heads toward the skeleton with a stutter and a speed that is impossible for a 9 year-old. That\u2019s right. With the body correction provided by her magic armor and her physical abilities enhanced by magic, she is faster than a bike.\u201cHaa!\u201dYamiyo pulls her petite body to its fullest and enters the skeleton\u2019s bosom, swinging her sword, which contains the light of darkness, in a sideways cleave.With a thud, Yamiyo cut the skeleton\u2019s torso in half. Other skeletons raise their clubs, but Yamiyo leaps lightly into the bosom of the cudgeled skeleton and kicks it in the bone leg. The skeleton\u2019s leg snaps off with a crack, looking fragile. She slams the hilt into the skeleton\u2019s head, shattering it, and spins around to cut off the other skeleton.With a thump, Yamiyo ran in a straight zigzag, cutting off the remaining two with sharp sword blows. Yamiyo\u2019s pigtails swayed when she\u2019s run, and her beautiful and dignified expression was beautiful.Hey, that one is nine years old, right? She already looks like a warrior with a long history of warfare. The magician of the Marquis family is super strong, isn\u2019t she?Even without me doing anything, Yamiyo defeats five skeletons. But three more appear from the other side.\u201cLeave it to me, Yamiyo-chan!\u201dWhen Yamiyo defeats them, I don\u2019t get any experience. That\u2019s because the game specs didn\u2019t count Yamiyo\u2019s battle with the skeletons as my battle counts. The reason is predictable. Yamiyo and the others are treated as NPCs, not as part of the party. The only members I can include in a party are from the adventurer\u2019s guild\u2019s bar.If I asked at the bar counter who would be my companion, it would be too suspicious to answer if Yamiyo asked where I got my companion. I decided that I would never organize a party unless I\u2019m an adult. There is a high possibility the tavern master and I will not have such a conversation.Three white-boned corpses appear with a crunch. I squint and use the controller in my head.[Examine]-Skeleton, level 1-I can see the enemy projected level. I can\u2019t analyze its weaknesses, but I know the skeleton\u2019s weaknesses without examining them. They are Strike, Fire, and Holy.[Fight][Flee.]These two options appeared. That is my weakness, I\u2019m in trouble because of my game specs.[Fight.]As soon as I choose that option, the armor I wore, which looks like a fusion of my white leotard and priest\u2019s uniform, shines, and my armor deploys with a clang.Takano Miu, the beautiful girl, is in battle mode. She\u2019s still young, and her appearance is a little immoral and erotic. Gentlemen, you can\u2019t touch, look at, or even photograph her.Yes, I [Activate] the magic armor. I chose [Fight] so I could [Activate] it.\u201cTaaah!\u201dWith a cute voice, I attacked the approaching skeleton with my mace. The skeleton holds up its club, but when the mace hits its shoulder, the skeleton easily cracks, and its spreads and shatters from the point where I hit.The other two close in, but I step back and spread my hands.[Turn Undead]A holy light shoots out from me, the priestess girl then the skeletons become [Terrified] and stop moving as they get blasted in that holy light.\u201cThat\u2019s it, Teya!\u201dMiu swung her mace and struck the motionless skeletons with a painful blow, shattering them into pieces. Bones scattered, and the result got displayed on the status board.[Killed a pack of monsters. Acquired 3 Exp. Acquired 3 Magic StoneF.]The battle was over, and my magic armor lost its light and returned to normal.\u201cMiu-ojou-sama. You must always have mana circulating in your body. I\u2019m repeating myself, but you can\u2019t do it only when you fight with the enemy.\u201d\u201cYes, sensei.\u201dI answer cheerfully, but no matter how many times I practice, I can\u2019t do that. I know why. Because in the game, every time I enter the combat mode, I\u2019m standing with the effect of the deployed magic armor! When the battle is over, the armor retracts. I now think it\u2019s an effect I don\u2019t need.Yes, I know. I had to select the [Fight] command in combat, just like in a game, to exert my power. I thought the game specs were invincible, but I got an unexpected weakness.I didn\u2019t realize that when I help the possessed Yamiyo, it\u2019s [Turn Undead], a recovery magic that I can use outside of battle and for events. Oh boy, what a mess.So I can\u2019t even use life magic. It wasn\u2019t a game. And this [Fight] command is the same, but I can\u2019t go easy. Even if I try to stop my enemy or go easy on them, I attack at full force unconsciously because there\u2019s no such thing in the game. I feel like I don\u2019t lose stamina that easily. When I get tired and can\u2019t move, it\u2019s after the battle is over.If I don\u2019t use the [Fight] command, I can go easy on my enemy, but he can\u2019t use his mana, so he has the average physical ability of a 9-year-old. I\u2019m in trouble, holy shit. My defense is still the same. Even in the game, there are times when you get a surprise attack. In that case, the magic armor is automatically [Activate] itself. The power doesn\u2019t apply unless I choose the [Fight] command.Somehow, I should be able to use mana without the [Fight] command.\u201cI found another skeleton, four of them!\u201d\u201cYamiyo-chan, let me take them down! I need to be able to use [mana] well!\u201dAt the scout\u2019s words, I make a request to defeat those skeletons. It\u2019s because I want to increase my proficiency and raise my level. It won\u2019t change even if they kill the skeletons, right? I need it. After all, even if I fought snacks, I didn\u2019t get any experience points or proficiency. The food was delicious.\u201cI understand!\u201dSkeletons are suckers for priests.\u201cGuwahGuwah!\u201dWith a cute squeal, Miu raised her mace to do battle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s 3 hours for my first real battle.Then we eat our lunch. My lunch is a lunch box made by my mom. I have octopus sausages, a sweet egg omelet, and an apple in my lunch box. Probably the rarest item in this dungeon.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, Yamiyo-chan!\u201dI put the omelet in my mouth and found it slightly sweet. It is not too sweet, but it is also delicious. Hmmm? This fried chicken is not frozen food!I notice the taste of the fried food in my bento, and I\u2019m so surprised that I devour it with gusto.

Hwhat is this?\u201dI chew some of it and exclaim in surprise. I\u2019ve heard that edible monster meat is delicious, but while it is full of fat, it has a light, lean flavor that goes well with the meat, making it the most delicious meat I\u2019ve ever tasted. It is so delicious that I was afraid to ask the price.\u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it so much.\u201d\u201cAnd my octopus sausage in return, ahhh.\u201d\u201cAhn!\u201dSeeing these beautiful girls healing each other during lunch was soothing to all of us.I think about this while happily eating my lunch.The game version of The Night of Night is an RPG that gamers have played. This system. It is a game that is rumored, or perhaps true, to be a collection of the best parts of well-known games.Basic level. Job proficiency. When the number of battles reaches a certain level, the proficiency level increases. It is possible to fight against lower-ranked demons. However, it is limited to monsters.Odd proficiency levels add magic, and even proficiency levels add physical abilities.An example is as follows. By the way, the physical ability of a priest is MP increase.\u2606 Magic I or Martial Arts I\u2606\u2606 Physical ability +\u2606\u2606\u2606 Range Magic I or Special Skill I\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Physical Ability+\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Magic II or Martial Arts II\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Physical Ability+\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Range Magic II or Special Skill II\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Physical Ability+\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 Magic III or Martial Arts IIIDo you see what I mean? All jobs follow this rule. Proficiency is up to 9 Stars. I\u2019ve seen this before, gamers might say. The names of magic are also the usual ones, from I to III.I heard that some heavy fans complained that this was a violation of the original. There was indeed no such thing as I or III magic.But I like these games, so I played them. I thought that if it was fun, I wouldn\u2019t mind if it destroyed the original work. In the first place, the magic used by the characters in the novels is all different, so I guess they couldn\u2019t make it into the game. Even in the game, only the characters in the novel could use such magic with special names.As for unique skills, let\u2019s see. Priest I is like this.Priest I: 50% up on striking weapons, Turn Undead, Holy and Dark Resistance. Holy Magic is 100% up.That is the increased attack power of the equipment. Special unique skill. Attributes. And the power of exclusive martial arts or magic is increased.There are 12 types of attributes. Except for the universal attribute, they can be disabled, absorbed, or reflected. The universal attribute resists other attributes. Magic can\u2019t defend against universal attribute magic.Attributes[Slash, Strike, Assault] [Fire, Wind, Water, Lightning, Earth, Holy, Dark, Void] [Universal]12 basic combat jobs.4 kinds of production jobs.5 kinds of compound jobs.3 kinds of hidden jobs.1 kind of charge job.The rest are higher up the job ladder. Only basic jobs have job ranks. If you become a master, you can move up to a higher level. There are four levels, I to IV.Once you have magic and skills, you can use them even if you change jobs. The only skills that you can\u2019t use are our unique skills.If a third party looks at these specifications, they would think, it\u2019s a lazy way of doing things. Yeah, I think so too.But what\u2019s worse is this.The Night of Magic is a classic fantasy novel. The Author wrote the story when the job system was not yet common in games.In other words, there were no jobs and no levels. There was no such thing as the best composite job [Hero]. The main character was not a hero; he did not go to the temple at 12 years old and get a job from God.And Yamiyo was a magician who had awakened to the dark attribute. That\u2019s all.We can use a sword, but we can also use a club or a spear. Our attack power does not change depending on the weapon we use. We have special equipment, as is common in novels, but there is nothing we can\u2019t equip ourselves with, and we can use powerful magic.Yes, I understand. I understand.The game version is a destruction of the original work. Call it a catastrophe. It doesn\u2019t match the novel at all. I feel the game company forced it to like the existing RPG. That was even worse because it was a setting that didn\u2019t seem wrong. But it wasn\u2019t right either. It was a gray area.And there\u2019s a wide variety of armaments in a modest open world and various events. You could get a second job after you hit level 50, or if you\u2019re level 99 or above, you can pay to remove the level limit.With the idea of selling the game to gamers, the production company shamelessly used the excuse that it was a game adaptation of a novel as a pretext for their creation, and ripped off the system from other games. What\u2019s more, it is an old system. The real-time system is decades old.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Researching About JobIt would have been difficult to make it into a popular solo action game, so it would be nice to praise the production company. I like retro RPGs. Of course, I got involved.I remember gamers making fun of it, saying it was the Final Dragon Reincarnation. But it was a game made by taking the best parts of the original, so even though the naming sense was a bit corny, it was fun.I heard that the big fans of the original were furious, though. Well, that\u2019s not unreasonable. And they even released weapons and jobs that were more powerful than the original. It\u2019s a common occurrence in in-game adaptations.With that said, I ended up living in The Night of Magic game world as a gamer who destroys the original.I cannot use magic that is not in the game, and I cannot use mana in combat unless I choose the [Fight] command. I will try my best to see if I can use the novel\u2019s magic in the future, but there is a corner of my mind that says it is hopeless. Well, if I think of it as a disadvantage of becoming stronger, I might be able to tolerate it, but it\u2019s a shame. No, I\u2019m not giving up. It\u2019s the same mana, right? Mine is in MP notation, though.I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s \u2018mana points,\u2019 right? I\u2019m not the only one with [Magic Points]? I\u2019m not the only one with otherworldly specs, am I? No, it should be mana because I can activate my magic armor.Since the game is based on the novel, I can understand many things. For example, recovery magic.[Minor Heal I], the magic a priest can use can recover about 8 to 12 HP. That magic can heal the whole body if you are an ordinary person.However, it is almost useless for magicians. Why is that? Magicians are resistant to magic. It is not limited to offensive magic. Therefore, [Minor Heal I] can only heal a minor wound.Do you understand? In other words, the amount of HP recovery is expressed this way. In games, a strong wizard has 100 HP. In the real world, that would be strange, wouldn\u2019t it? It is not weird if they have the same HP as an ordinary person. It\u2019s not surprising [Minor Heal I] can heal the entire body.But when we consider the idea of resistance here, the more powerful the magician is, the more resistant they are, so they cannot recover unless they use powerful recovery magic. That is why they calculated the maximum HP to be large. It\u2019s well thought out.Therefore, Yamiyo, a magician, can recover from only minor wounds. I found this out while trying to heal a previously injured Yamiyo. It\u2019s a good thing I found this out during training. If we had found out during the actual battle. I would have panicked.\u201cMii-sama, are you tired?\u201dYamiyo pokes me on the cheek as I\u2019m absentmindedly thinking about my job research, and asks with a gentle smile.\u201cNah. I\u2019m still fine! I\u2019m already level 3 too.\u201dI smile, bends my arm, and give a thumbs-up. Yamiyo giggles happily at the adorable sight. The others looked at me with smiles on their faces.\u201cI think we can do 35 more battles!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a specific number, isn\u2019t it?\u201dYamiyo tilted her head curiously, but proficiency is not the number of my enemy, but the number of times I killed them. It\u2019s one time when I kill a swarm. If I kill a single one, it\u2019s one time. I want to fight 35 more times to raise my proficiency to five.\u201cAlso, Mii-sama. Why do you do such strange fighting?\u201d\u201cWeird??\u201dI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. Well, I know what she means.\u201cAfter defeating one of the enemies, you should leave. Your magic armor will also stop, and the instructor will be furious if you\u2019re messing around.\u201dYamiyo warns me stealthily in a whisper in my ear. Yamiyo\u2019s exhaling breath hangs on me.\u201cUmmm, I\u2019m practicing to see if I can keep my magical armor activated all the time. I\u2019ve explained it to the instructor.\u201d\u201cI see. You can\u2019t activate your magic armor unless a monster is nearby, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I have to practice!\u201dI reply with a huff and a breath, but it\u2019s a lie.When the enemy\u2019s hate goes to another adventurer, the battle ends. If I kill even one demon at that point, it counts toward my proficiency count. It\u2019s a trick I can only do in the real world.If three of them show up, I hope they\u2019ll be counted as separate battles, and I want the system counts them as three battles. I\u2019m sorry to the escorting adventurers, I want to do it efficiently. There aren\u2019t that many demons out there.I noticed this trick because when an enemy drifted away from me. The system will treat it as if the enemy fled and the battle ended. So I could easily set my proficiency level to 3.I only get to fight about three times an hour, partly because I have to separate Yamiyo from the enemy. If I hadn\u2019t noticed this trick, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to fight 15 times.\u201cFight a lot, and you\u2019ll thank everyone in my guards!\u201dMagic stones, item drops, or materials I can take from bodies are worth money. The materials here are cheap, but at least it\u2019s a thank you. I\u2019m here in the dungeon to take advantage of Yamiyo. I\u2019m going to give her everything as a thank you.I won\u2019t give her the item box contents, though.A mysterious design. When I kill my enemies, I can get magic stones and materials from their bodies. But my Item Box is automatically filled with magic stones and materials too. Does that mean I have twice as many dropped items? Well, only certain items can go into the item box.I casually asked about the item box, and no one could use it. That\u2019s not so surprising. It would take a high-ranking magician to create subspace, right? There are no such magical tools, either.So, it\u2019s a secret, secret, Miu-chan\u2019s secret. The item box has become one of my top secrets.My equipment is stored in subspace, and there is no pattern of it appearing and unfolding with the light, from the bracelet state or something. Because in the game, the scene where the female character changes clothes in the changing room is important. The female characters are in their underwear and talking with each other for a long time, rather than having a transformation scene that takes place in a moment.I think that the author of \u201cThe Night of Magic\u201d was thinking about how he could gain popularity.\u201cWe will finish our break in 30 minutes. After that, we\u2019ll start fighting for about three hours.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cOkay, sir.\u201dThe instructor panned his hand, and we were off to another afternoon of combat.Then, when my proficiency level reached 5, that guy showed up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mistake Was MadeProficiency level reached 5. After endless battles, finally. It\u2019s already 16:00. It must be time to go home.I can now use beginner-level Sacred Magic II. Well, the power doesn\u2019t change much. It\u2019s a matter of mood. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, right? But, in the Beginner\u2019s Sacred Magic II, there is an Abnormality Recovery Magic I. It\u2019s not very effective, but I wanted it.In the game, an abnormality state such as poison also has class from I to IV, right? We can only cure those abnormal states like poison with Abnormality Recovery Magic with the same level or higher. Incidentally, state abnormalities also include deficiencies. If an arm is missing, the game treats it as a seal. I think the game name should be Final Dragon World Tree Reincarnation.I admire the production company that made this game. Perhaps money was more important than pride, or something. The subtle changes they made to the system were also very bad.My skill level is 5, which is enough for today\u2019s work. I level up by 1 from 4, though. The undead is hardly the pay for my experience.A beautiful 9-year-old girl can\u2019t come to the dungeon every day. It would be better if I could go once a month. I wanted to earn as much as possible.Mufu, Miu is smiling with satisfaction on her pretty face, and Yamiyo, soothed by her smile, pulls out a handkerchief from the pochette at her waist.\u201cMii-sama. Let me wipe your sweat for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Yamiyo-chan.\u201dYamiyo wipes my puffy cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s tickle,\u201d Miu laughed, and Yamiyo more and more soothed and loosened her cheeks.Amid this soothing scene, another adventurer catches an enemy and raises his hand to signal.I escape the Yamiyot\u2019s fluky attack and clutch my mace. It\u2019s time to finish.\u201cThere are four skeletons!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost the end, so why don\u2019t you two take them down?\u201d\u201cYeah, sure!\u201dIf the [Fight] command is selected beforehand, there is no problem if an NPC joins the battle, as it got counted as my side hit. I have to deal with the damage first, though.I have 5 MP left. I recovered 2 every hour with breaks, but I use Turn Undead and Recovery Magic. Can I use Turn Undead again this time? Turn Undead is AOE magic, so it\u2019s not a problem, but let\u2019s try \u2026\u2026 range magic.\u201cYamiyo-chan, I\u2019m going to try some ingenious recovery magic!\u201d\u201cIngenious?\u201d\u201cYes, I devised it!\u201dI lie with a smile to Yamiyo who tilts her head curiously. If I answered that I had learned it because I had improved my proficiency, I might get accused of playing too many games, or I might get taken to the hospital. I don\u2019t have a choice.Originally, ranged recovery magic affects the entire party. However, when it got directed at the enemy as a ranged magic attack. Its range changed. The magic\u2019s effective range get displayed like normal because Yamiyo was not counted in my party.It was a circular area, about 10 meters in diameter. I see it has the same specification as in the game. So, magic is for the whole area, but ranged magic is for a circle. Memo note.But the effect range changes depending on the magic\u2019s power. In the game, there are circular, fan-shaped, and straight lines and the AOE of ranged magic is different in various ways. Maybe it is based on that.At any rate, I use range recovery magic with my remaining MP. I want Yamiyo to defeat the coming enemy.Ranged attacks usually can\u2019t use the enemy as a fulcrum, but they can if you lock them. Sometimes it is more convenient to use the locked state, so I used it differently.Since this is my first time, I try to select a command to use range magic while considering the speed of the enemy\u2019s foot by manual operation. I hear the sound of crunching, and bony footsteps coming from the bottom of the hill, and I see the skeletons.Boom!And the skeletons get engulfed in fierce fire with a roaring sound. The wasteland gets engulfed in flames, and my prey is on fire. The old man was blown away by the aftermath of the flames.\u201cGwagwagh!\u201dConfused, I imitate a duck\u2019s quack. Gwagwag. My prey.\u201cSorry. Those skeletons were the ones we were chasing.\u201dA voice came from the back of the room, a young boy\u2019s voice sounding but giving a rather rough impression.The scouting adventurers are startled by this. They didn\u2019t notice that he was approaching, or else they would have failed to protect us.\u201cWho the hell are you!\u201dThe captain of the guard shouts in anger. That\u2019s right. He\u2019s not that far from us. If the fire magic had been a little off. We would have been roasted chicken.Amid the burning wasteland, a small boy wearing bright red magic armor appeared from the space behind the skeletons that were turning to ashes. He was wearing a cloak with some machine attached to it, which flapped in a flurry.\u201cYou are not allowed to approach other families with [Cloak of Invisibility]!\u201dThe captain modifies his tone somewhat but still does not hide his anger. The escorting adventurers also remain vigilant with their weapons at the ready.The reason for the change in tone is the boy is a high rank noble, wearing expensive-looking magical armor. He\u2019s a boy with fiery red hair. He looks cocky, or young, but his face is contorted in a vile, ugly smile. He is a bad boy I can tell he must have had a bad education.The magic armor looks expensive because the boy\u2019s magic armor covered his body. Cheap magic armor covers only the breastplate and not much of the skin. The armor used to cover the whole body costs a terrible amount of money. It is limited to men, though.For women, it\u2019s not as expensive as it is for the more exposed parts. The author was not that bad. If it has a lot of jewelry or something on it, it\u2019s considered expensive.\u201cWell, excuse me. But you know what. You guys took the guy I was chasing. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s the worst.\u201dThinking that this guy was some hoodlum, I was astonished to see the boy distorting his face as if to cut his shoulder in an attempt to show his ferocity. Even if an ordinary 9-year-old is frightened, I won\u2019t be intimidated. Am I? Hmmm?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mistake Was MadeIt seems I\u2019m the only one who thinks so. The captains are sweating cold sweat, and the butler and the maids are changing positions to protect Yamiyo and me.When I look at Yamiyo\u2019s face, it is grim. Everyone is intimidated. This is a boy who is a bad actor who would never get chosen for the school play.Maybe they are intimidated by mana or something. Gogo. I can\u2019t feel his mana at all. I need to visualize it.At any rate, I read the air and stare at the boy with a serious face, holding my stick. It\u2019s a dumb scene. Are you kidding me? I\u2019m not surprised, am I?\u3000I\u2019m a good girl, so I\u2019ll go along with everyone.It\u2019s not a surprise. Intimidated by his power, the boy looks satisfied and opens his mouth.\u201cMy name is Aguni Masatoshi. You\u2019ve heard of me, right? I\u2019m the eldest son of the Duke of Aguni. Who are you?\u201dThe boy squares his chin in a half-polite, aristocratic manner. He\u2019s an irritating boy. Did he say Masatoshi or something?\u201cThis is the eldest daughter of the Teijo family, Teijo Yamiyo-sama\u2019s troop.\u201d\u201cAhhh, Teijo Yamiyo, right. Where are you? In the shadows? Are you using them as meat shields? Or are you a baggage handler? Hey, dark-rooted Wakame-chan, where are you~? Kuhahaha.\u201dMasatoshi scurries around and laughs. But then he looked at Yamiyo and me, and his face turned surprised. What is this guy? Could he be a character from a novel?I stare at him, and he blushes and turns his face away. Phew. Miu\u2019s cuteness got him, huh? Laughing through my nose, I check Masatoshi\u2019s face against my memory.A character in a novel. The hero, his male partner, and the heroine. Yeah, I don\u2019t match any of them. I remembered the faces of some of the enemy characters, but the check result was zero. Yes, he is not a character in the novel.It\u2019s a bad habit to think of every character around the protagonist. That is reality. Many people live here. It must be harder to find a character who is related to the main character than it is to win the third prize in a lotto lottery.But as if to block his gaze, Yamiyo stood in front of me. She ruffled her pigtails and glared at Masatoshi with cold eyes.\u201cMember from the Aguni Family. I am Teijo Yamiyo. Please make your acquaintance.\u201dYamiyo does the curtesy, pretending to hold the hem as if she had a skirt, though she doesn\u2019t have one, and she looks splendid, not like a 9 year-old. Can I as her best friend give a quick clap?But for some reason, Masatoshi\u2019s expression changed to surprise at Yamiyo\u2019s admirable greeting. For some reason, he stares at Yamiyo with a look of impatience so piercingly that it makes a hole in his face.That is it. Now it\u2019s time for me to protect Yamiyo from Masatoshi\u2019s gaze. Yami Yoru, can you not play defense? Yamiyo spreads her hands out to her sides so I can\u2019t go to her front to protect her. Hey, Yamiyo-chan?In front of the two of us giggling and shoving each other, Masatoshi regain his composure and resumed grinning.\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what it is. Damn it. Wasn\u2019t I the only one?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dYamiyo asks, frowning suspiciously at Masatoshi, who looks frustrated. But all Masatoshi could do in response was shake his head.\u201cYou know my name without asking, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI am sorry. I thought today was the first time I had met you, Aguni-sama.\u201dI looked at Yamiyo\u2019s face, wondering if they knew each other, but it looked strange like they had never met before. What the hell? That guy knows her one way or another? Well, Yamiyo is a beautiful woman. It\u2019s not surprising some men think on their own that they know her. She\u2019s only 9 years old, but she\u2019s a terrifying girl.But when Masatoshi\u2019s eyes widen in surprise at Yamiyo\u2019s words, she starts staring at him again. He\u2019s rude, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019ll be the wall, Yamiyo, and you won\u2019t play defense?\u201cOh, I see. Oh, there\u2019s a pattern like that? I see.\u201dI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but when I smiled good-humoredly, Masatoshi regained his composure and grinned at me.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry for both of us. I\u2019ll give you some of those garbage magic stones. See you.\u201dSuddenly changing his attitude, Masatoshi flipped his cloak and left. I saw the duke\u2019s bodyguard running impatiently from over the hill and joined him. What the hell, that guy?\u201cHe was a strange boy, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a pervert. He was looking at Mii-sama as if he was making fun of you.\u201dYamiyo was angry, but he spent more time staring at her than she did.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s in love with Yamiyo-chan!\u201d\u201cEh? What did you say?\u201dWith an innocent smile, I uttered a guess, and she glared at me, and for some reason, I felt pressured, so I chuckled. Maybe there are demons in this world.It was scarier than fighting monsters.Anyway, fighting demons, huh? Well, I\u2019ll have to be careful.Miu didn\u2019t remember Masatoshi. He was in a minor role, so it was inevitable. And that was the proof that I was a mobster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Mobs Are In Place-Masatoshi\u2019s POV-Aguni Masatoshi was walking up the hill, crunching my nails. My face seemed to be in a good mood, but we could also see impatience in the shadows.\u201cIsn\u2019t that common? I see. There were other reincarnations besides me?\u201dWhile mumbling and muttering I glanced back. There was a group of Teijo family members there, and as if protected by the center of the group, I could see Yamiyo. Another girl, she\u2019s the prettiest girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201cYoung master! You can\u2019t just go off on your own.\u201dThe butler, who had been looking for me when I realized I was gone, rushed up to me, sweating like waterfalls and gasping for breath.I snickered at their stupidity and walked past them.I\u2019m not going to be harmed by this monster. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to get even a scratch.I have more important things to check than that.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t Teijo Yamiyo get attacked by a wraith when she was in kindergarten?\u201dAnd she was supposed to have slaughtered the kindergartners and gotten dumped in a branch house. But by the looks, she wasn\u2019t abandoned. Not with her wakame-like, eerily sprawling black hair, pitch-black, panda-like shades, as if she were wearing foundation, not with her kihihihi and grating tone of voice.Then there is only one answer. Yamiyo didn\u2019t kill a kindergartener in kindergarten.\u201cOh, I heard about how she killed the deadly wraith. That girl next that to her has the holy attribute, and they joined forces to exterminate the wraith.\u201dThe butler had heard the rumors of deception spread by the Teijo family and believed that was true. The Teijo family had spread deceptive rumors to protect Yamiyo so that Miu could get protected by the Teijo family, whose daughter they had hurt.How shameless the Teijo family was to try to take in Miu even though Yamiyo had hurt Miu, and how shameless the Count Takano family was to try to put the rumor to rest, so they spread a rumor that was both near and far from the truth.But I was convinced by the explanation. In a whisper, I muttered so that no one could hear.\u201cI see. Originally, the story would have been that Yamiyo had killed that pretty girl, too. But she prevented it.\u201dIt\u2019s confirmed. I was convinced that Teijo Yamiyo was a reincarnated person.She is reincarnated like a template. Reincarnated as a fat person, she becomes thin, second-sighted, and beautiful. They work harder than the original character could ever do, and become so talented that everyone praises them as geniuses.What they all have in common is that they become a completely different person from the character they were before. Yamiyo fits the bill perfectly. She is a straightforward reincarnator.When I joined the group of dukes on the hill, to organize my thoughts, I kicked the butlers away, ordered them not to come near me, and sat down under a thin tree growing thinly.\u201cCould Yamiyo be my obstacle? \u2026\u2026 but she doesn\u2019t seem to know that this is The Night of Magic\u2026\u201dThere is a pattern of reincarnation without knowing the story of that novel. That scowling face was a face that said Yamiyo had never seen me before. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t lying.It is a rare pattern. In this case, the protagonist, who knows the story, saves her, and they become friends. Or the pattern could be that they become lovers.\u201cBut her previous self is so creepy. I\u2019d pass, too, indeed.\u201dNo matter how beautiful she was, I still had in my mind the creepy appearance and personality that appeared in Yamiyo\u2019s story, and I had no appetite for it.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to make you a member of my harem, it\u2019s that gray-haired girl.\u201dI smirked and remembered that gray girl. She had lustrous hair that resembled silver that reached to her back, and her ice-blue eyes were intensely attractive. She had a pretty flowery face and a petite body. I was looking forward to seeing what she would become when she grew up.I\u2019m sure that if she hadn\u2019t known the story and had made an effort to live with good morals, she would have become friends with the person she killed in the kindergarten slaughter event. Then the story changed, and the wraith must have possessed another human.There is no doubt that that gray-haired girl is a character that gets killed in the event. It was Yamiyo\u2019s treatment that supported that idea. What I felt after reincarnating in this world was that high-ranking nobles were tyrannical. After all, even if I intend to burn the servants, even if I inflict a serious injury, I can cover it up. Yamiyo could have covered it up as well.The reason why they couldn\u2019t is that gray girl. I learned in this world that the gray color is a sign of awakening to the holy attribute. It is a sign of awakening as a recovery wizard.And recovery wizards are rare; there are only 30 of them out of 200,000 wizards in the world. The Marquise, I assume, was unable to cover up the case of the daughter who killed the restorative magician. It is not far off the mark.My guess is probably correct. After all, I have the whole this whole world in my head. I\u2019m synonymous with God in this world.I praise myself for my genius and thinks about how she will respond.There is a possibility that I could be an obstacle to my obstacles. The fact that Yamiyo is sane will change the story. At the very least, there will not be an event where Yamiyo becomes a member of an enemy organization and infiltrates the academy.\u201cBut there was no problem without her event. Even if they cut all of it out of the anime. It wouldn\u2019t have ruined the story. It was so refreshing to lose the stalker creepy event.\u201dThe Teijo family gets glimpsed in subsequent episodes. It is, I believe, the event where the protagonist who protects Yamiyo goes to complain to the Teijo family. The Teijo family is a family of samurai. She must have had a strict father.There are various tear-jerking stories, and later Teijo Ouga reflects on the situation and takes a warrior from his family to join him during the monster stampede. That was the only character, and the rest of the time Ouga had no part in the story. In the anime, the reinforcements get replaced by other family members, and it\u2019s not even strange if they are not there.So there is no problem in eliminating Yamiyo. There is no problem, but I need to be careful. If Yamiyo had known the story, I would have killed her without hesitation. Even though she is the eldest daughter of a marquis, there is a high possibility that killing her will cause us many problems. It was worth the risk to kill her.Because if she knows the story, she will be involved. That\u2019s what a mob reincarnation does. They will talk about some unwanted sense of justice, etc., and then come to the aid of the protagonist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Mobs Are In Place-Masatoshi\u2019s POV-But Yamiyo doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a world in a novel and doesn\u2019t know the story. She\u2019s a character whose entire existence got cut from the anime. That\u2019s the extent of who she is. It might be more dangerous to mess with them. In a case like this, beating around the bush could result in a snake coming out.The self-proclaimed otaku ex-freelancer recalls novels and the like that have had disastrous results in my past experiences. However, I bite my nails crunchingly and irritably, because there could be a development here, such as ruin, if I don\u2019t get my hands on it.The group of dukes looks at the unmoving me from a distance and falls silent. They understand that speaking to me at a time like this would be a terrible thing to do.If I take the real world and the fiction world are different, I gather information and confirm they\u2019re well-matched.Some of this information included the power among the nobles. It was a part that did not come out in the novel, and it was information that would destroy me if overlooked.If I was going to make a move, it was now or never. The Marquis of Teijo is a family of warriors. Although it got cut out of the anime, its power cannot be underestimated, even by the dukes.If I miss out now, it may be difficult to reach them. In my impatience, I decided to use a solution for now.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t we have a summoning stone for the meat shield?\u201dStanding up and dusting myself off, I call to the butler standing breathlessly beside him.\u201cYes. I have it ready for you in case you need it, just as the young master told me to do.\u201d\u201cBring it to me.\u201d\u201c? What are you going to use it for?\u201d\u201cJust bring it.\u201dThe butler nodded, went to the luggage area, then came with a trunk case in my hand. I rattle it open, and inside is a small, pure gold box wrapped in shock-absorbent material.I take the small box and pull out a key to open it. Inside were large gems, rubies, emeralds, and topazes. How many carats are there? The amount of money would easily exceed a hundred million.And while even a mere gemstone would be worth more than a billion, there were burning flames, storms, and dust stirring inside the gem. It was proof that magic resided within those gems.It was an item I had brought along just in case. I did not consider myself an ordinary mob hero. Because of my prickly thinking, I always considered the possibility I was in terrible trouble.I try to suppress the outrageous things to a level the Duke\u2019s power could cover. I consider the usual pattern, the sudden problem, the possibility of being attacked by a powerful monster or many monsters I\u2019m a cautious man, I say of myself.Therefore, I had prepared to summon stones that would serve as a meat shield so that I could escape in such a case. These stones seal summoned beasts that are obedient to their owner.After all, I am not well-liked. I believe when I get attacked by a powerful monster. My subordinates will abandon me and flee. I would use my power of money to solve the problem than behave decently and be gentle with my subordinates.In the original story, there were occasional scenes in which the enemy used the jewel which seals monsters. There were many different kinds of monsters, and even the hero had a hard time dealing with some of them.Knowing this, Victory bought and prepared this jewel. It cost a lot of money, but I asked my father to buy it. Then I learned why the enemy used it in large quantities and did not kill the protagonist. There was no way I could casually use a jewel that cost billions of dollars.\u201cFlame is no good. Wind and earth.\u201dI put a ruby with a fiery glow to the side. This one has too much killing power to fool around with if pursued.I nod my head in affirmation as I look at the emerald glow. Then, shaking my head, I retreat to the side, as does Ruby. Wind summons has extremely weak defenses. They may be able to confuse demons, but they will not be able to confuse intelligent humans.The wind summoner was also too powerful to appeal to the audience that it had no intention of killing them in the first place.Then, there is only topaz left.It is slow-moving, yet durable and powerful with a single blow. It would only die by accident. It would be possible to escape.It could even pretend to be in a hurry and watch from a distance.\u201cStone golem, break free from the seal.\u201d[Activate]With those words as command words, the topaz shimmers, and an earth-colored magic circle floats above the gem. Everyone squinted and covered their faces with their arms as the topaz shone even more intensely.Then, after the light subsided, stood the Stone Golem, a 5 meter tall puppet made of stone. With pillar-like limbs and a rock-like torso, the summoned beast stood meekly.When I saw it, I approached it and gave it a whispered command.[Go for a walk. Destroy any obstacles.]As it did so, I slowly let a smile appear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Novel First Battle Is Always Unexpected-Miu\u2019s POV-It is already evening. The dungeon ceiling emits a certain amount of light, so I can\u2019t tell the time, but I know. Beautiful girl Sister Miu-chan understands.Ku~.\u201cMii-sama, you must be hungry.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m hungry. Can\u2019t we go home soon?\u201dAt the signal for dinner coming from Miu\u2019s adorable belly, Yamiyo smiles, and the people around her also smile at her loveliness.A little embarrassed, I hold my stomach and blush. This body\u2019s timer is accurate. I think it\u2019s time for dinner. It\u2019s time to go home, right?I\u2019m a good girl, I have a curfew to keep. My mother allows me until 6 pm today. She tells me to be careful, so I want to reassure her that I\u2019ll be home on time. Family friendliness is important. A good boy comes home on time and says, \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201cYes, I know. We\u2019ve had some strange interruptions, so let\u2019s go home now.\u201dDo you mean that strange guy, that kid named Awakuni Masatoshi? He was indeed a weird boy. Especially with that twisted personality.\u201cYeah! Let\u2019s go home.\u201dMiu raises one hand and jumps up and down with a big smile. Miu\u2019s innocent behavior soothes everyone.I giggle inwardly that my behavior is perfect, and then I say, \u201cWell then, I guess we\u2019re done.\u201d, and begin to clean up. Various items get spread out in the place that used to be our hunting base. I\u2019ll help you clean up.I walked around a bit, trying to carry what I could.The ground shook with a shaking sound. The plastic bottle on top of the trunk shook with the vibration and fell over, spilling water. The nickel holding up the tarp came off, and the tarp fell to the ground.\u201cHey, what is it?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dYamiyo and I looked around. It didn\u2019t look like an earthquake. Is there some dangerous enemy coming?I looked over and saw something approaching from the other side of the hill, making an earth-shaking sound and covered in a dust cloud.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dYamiyo noticed the anomaly and shouted. Some of the adventurers use magic. Yamiyo\u2019s eyes glow red, and she tries to see what the dust cloud is.[Eagle Eyes]It\u2019s a skill that allows you to see several kilometers ahead. It\u2019s a bit sticky, but it seems to be helpful.I stare at her, thinking this magic isn\u2019t in the game. The game didn\u2019t have the skill to check your surroundings because it was an encounter system. I do have the hiding skill, though.And that old guy next to me is using mechanical binoculars. They are the latest model of magic binoculars from The Night of Magic world that can automatically switch to distance measurement, infrared sensor, and night vision with the target.Maybe I don\u2019t need that skill after all. Is this the sadness of modern fantasy? I don\u2019t use binoculars. I feel sorry for the guy who is using the skill. Well, if you don\u2019t have binoculars, you can use them.I\u2019m a kid, so I want to use binoculars. It\u2019s romantic. Binoculars are cool.\u201cSo, it\u2019s Stone Golem! What brings that to this dungeon?\u201dWith a puzzled voice, the scouts warn their surroundings. The guarding adventurers ready their weapons and brace themselves against the approaching Stone Golem.Everyone is bewildered but still impressed by how calmly they can act if they are adventurers under the Marquis\u2019s command.\u201cYamiyo-ojousama, Miu-ojousama. Please prepare to evacuate.\u201dThe butler says to us with a serious expression. His appearance is not in the mood to be a precaution. Stone Golem, is it strong? I wonder if its level was high in the game. I remember it wasn\u2019t very strong.\u201cIs Stone Golem strong?\u201dI tilted my head with a cocky grin and asked the butler, who nodded with a serious look on his face.\u201cThat thing is almost immune to physical attacks. Moreover, the stone lump\u2019s arms are quite powerful and have a long reach due to its huge body. If you are not careful, you will die.\u201d\u201cWell then, let\u2019s all run away!\u201dA pretty bad-looking monster, huh? Then running away is the way to go. No, no. We can\u2019t escape.I realize that with a huff. The butler replies as I expected and shakes his head.\u201cThey are guards. They must act as shields in this time and buy time for Miu-ojousama and the others to escape to a safe place.\u201dWith a somber expression, the butler informed me. That\u2019s right. If they escape with us here, there\u2019s no point in guarding us.In an otherworldly fantasy, the bodyguard could leave the target of the bodyguard alone and run away. But in this modern fantasy, it is different. The bodyguards are firmly registered.Adventurers who are bodyguards get hired at a high price. It is the same with SPs. If they do not have the same resolve as SPs, who\u2019re prepared to get exposed to bullets on behalf of their bodyguard targets, they\u2019ll lose their trust, and they\u2019ll no longer get bodyguard jobs. Those who do guarding work are proud of it and will not run away from it.Even if they fight an unexpected and powerful enemy they are no match.When you look at it, it is surprising. The speed of the stone golem\u2019s feet is per hour\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. It feels like a truck going out of control. That is something you can\u2019t outrun if you run away.The adventurers in the escort are just a little stronger than Yamiyo. That is not because the bodyguard is weak, but because Yamiyo is strong. It\u2019s because she is the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Imperial Castle, a prestigious martial arts family.When it comes in contact with an adventurer who can only hold such a modest arm there, the stone golem raises its stone arm and attacks the lead adventurer.\u201cAll of you, counter them mainly with evasion!\u201d[Attack and Defense Conversion].The lead adventurer holds out his shield and uses his martial arts. The stone golem stops just before it crushes the adventurer, and falls backward as if it got bounced.With a zzzz and a scrape of its feet, the stone golem backed away, the five-meter giant being pushed backward despite its considerable weight.\u201cOh, great! I think the adventurer can win with that one, don\u2019t they?\u201dIt\u2019s a technique I\u2019ve never seen before. There\u2019s magic in the game that prevents physical attacks once, but it\u2019s not a martial art. I\u2019ve read it in novels. I don\u2019t remember the name of the technique.Because in the original novel, everyone used different techniques. They called it a family technique. They didn\u2019t make the standard the same, so in the game, they were forced to put them together. In the novel, I guess it was necessary to make them look good in battle with the enemy, but when you live in the novel\u2019s world. It just doesn\u2019t feel right.But with that technique, the battle should go in our favor. I thought, but the butler shook his head. Ah, I get it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Novel First Battle Is Always Unexpected-Miu\u2019s POV-\u201cThat is his secret technique. It\u2019s a secret technique that converts the enemy\u2019s attack into his defensive power. It consumes a lot of mana.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dI saw the adventurer who used it coolly when I looked at him.\u201cDamn. I\u2019m sorry. I ran out of mana.\u201dHe is putting back the armor of his magic armor while saying regretfully, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess he ran out of mana. But I suppose he was aiming to stop the stone golem\u2019s movement. Aiming for that opening, the other adventurers move.\u201cLeave the rest to me!\u201d[Gale Force].One of the adventurers cloaks his body in a wind aura and uses magic. The magic circle is drawn around the stone golem\u2019s feet, and a tornado rolls up, stopping the stone golem in its tracks and attempting to blow it away. The stone golem stops moving with a creaking sound. There, the adventurers around them produced chains of light in their hands and threw them all at once.[Light Chain Capture]\u201cOh! It\u2019s stopped moving this time, Yamiyo-chan.\u201dI clasp my hand and am impressed by the coordinated movements of the adventurers. The skills of these well-trained adventurers are more impressive than the one-of-a-kind skills. That\u2019s like a battle of smoldering silver. It\u2019s like fighting small fish for land battles more than white devils.\u201cNo, while that thing is in effect, it drains mana horribly. Come on, get out of there while we can!\u201d\u201cIf we stay, we won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201dAt the butler\u2019s words, Yamiyo also joins in with his voice. The stone golem is straining its arms to tear off the chains. The stone golem pulls the chains of light at the very last second, and the adventurers are trying their best to hold them back, but it looks painful.The chains of light are held back by draining the user\u2019s mana.\u2026\u2026 The first one who used martial art staggered and could move only like an ordinary person. The same goes for the ones who use Gale Force moves and the like.That is a pattern when they hold out until we escape to safety. They\u2019ll run out of mana and get stuck.\u201cLet\u2019s get away quickly. It\u2019s our job here to run away!\u201dGrabbing my arm and with a stern look on his face, Yamiyo recommends that we run away. The instructor, the butler, and the maids are ready to run away, protecting us. But that won\u2019t happen.\u201c\u2026Yamiyo, I\u2019m sorry, but we can\u2019t escape here.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t even put a scratch on that stone golem. Mii-sama can you do it?\u201dYamiyo with a serious face. I gently release Yamiyo\u2019s grip on my arm.\u201cIt\u2019s bad for our education.\u201d\u201cBad for education?\u201dYamiyo tilts her head curiously at my blurted words, but it\u2019s bad for our education.\u201cI\u2019m 9 years old, and going to be traumatized by the death of my bodyguard! I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m a good, healthy kid!\u201dTraumatizing your childhood like that leaves me uncertain about my future. If my parents see me in a darkened state, and they don\u2019t get along with me? I have to take care of my family, you know.I bare my double teeth like fangs and smile ferociously like a ravenous beast. Yamiyo is amazed at how much I\u2019ve changed, and her eyes widen in amazement.\u201cBesides, this is our only chance.\u201d\u201cChance?\u201dYamiyo asks with a blush on her cheeks, and she\u2019s right. It\u2019s a chance.Because.[Examine]Stone Golem, level 33.It\u2019s quite strong. I sneakily checked the instructor earlier, and he was level 21. Yamiyo is level 18. Their level is probably calculated based on the game standard, but if their pure combat power gets calculated, their and stone golem difference is overwhelming. Even in the game, the 10-level difference was difficult to overturn. I don\u2019t know about the novel world.And I am level 4. I could die in one blow.But, but, but.[Fight][Mine][Run]What are these commands?\u201c[Mine] sounds like fun.\u201dThat was in a game. That development.

A Perfect And Complete Operation-Masatoshi\u2019s POV-Aguni looks at the stone golem through binoculars with a smirk and an ugly smile. The latest magic binoculars model shows him the scene with a clear resolution as if the stone golem were right in front of his eyes.The adventurers frantically used magic to try to hold the stone golem. Behind them, Yamiyo and others are talking.\u201cBuying time, huh? I guess the dark root wakame isn\u2019t so strong after all.\u201dEven using precious summoned gems, Masatoshi wanted to confirm Yamiyo\u2019s ability. One topaz cost three billion yen, but he didn\u2019t hesitate. One of the reasons is that it can be undone.Facing the stone golem, a powerful summoned beast that is a stone giant, Yamiyo and her team are trying to escape, using the adventurers as bait.\u201cThe stone golem is hard. I imagined they could hurt it but not defeat it, but not like this. It may have potential, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be a threat.\u201dThe stone golem is not just a block of stone. Its material is bare topaz, which was created as a magical gemstone. Even though it looks like stone, its hardness is the same as topaz. Moreover, unless Yamiyo and others\u2019 attack gets imbued with magic. Their physical attacks get blocked. It is the strongest summoned beast.The 9 year old Masatoshi has a hideous personality that takes pleasure in tormenting others.If you\u2019re only good enough to get away with it, you\u2019re no match for Victory. Anyone who knew the story could at least have stopped the Stone Golem in its tracks.\u201cAt this time, the hero has not been thrown out of the duke\u2019s house. In other words, there is no one to come to his aid. The rest of us should be satisfied with letting the Stone Golem run rampant and watching it kill the adventurers.\u201dThe stone golem is no match for those adventurers. Masatoshi himself would have a hard time against the Stone Golem. Right now, they\u2019re using magic to block its movements, but soon their mana will run out, and those adventurers will be mincemeat.\u201cEven in the original story, some used that magic on those vicious monsters. But they ran out of mana and killed them all. I\u2019m lucky I could see the same scene in the flesh.\u201dThe mob adventurers were trying their best to stop the monsters summoned by the enemy organization, he thought. Masatoshi laughed at the description of the hard-working adventurers, saying, \u201cYes, yes, thank you, it\u2019s a stepping stone to show off the hero\u2019s strength.\u201d.Masatoshi scoffed with a Kuku kuku because the stone golem is good at what it does daily. After killing the adventurers, the stone golem would return to the summoned jewelry, Masatoshi then misled the Marquis by explaining that they had run out of control or appropriately misdirected Yamiyo and the others. They must not care if only a pawn adventurer dies, not the eldest daughter.\u201cThree billion yen will kill them. They are lucky trash. Thanks for that. Hey, what?\u201dI muttered and looked again at the binoculars.There was a petite, young, beautiful girl running adorably. She\u2019s raising her mace, and the gray-haired beauty heads toward the stone golem.She was running too slowly, though she was probably running with the physical ability of a weak 9 year old without activating her magical armor.\u201cHey, hey, that little harem candidate of mine. Don\u2019t push yourself too hard. You can\u2019t do anything.\u201dShe was running with her beautiful gray hair that resembled silver, her ice-blue eyes sharp, and an intimidating, beastly smile. Such a figure is also beautiful and noble, like a lion, and is admirable to behold.The girl, who is petite even for a 9 nine year old, raises her mace like a matchstick when faced with the stone golem. Does she think it\u2019s a game?\u201cI can\u2019t even wound it with that kind of force. Oh, what a waste. She\u2019s so pretty like that.\u201dFrom behind, Yamiyo and the others follow, dark swords in her hand, but it\u2019s futile. The stone golem\u2019s hardness cannot get cracked by even the slightest attack.\u201cWill Yamiyo die? It would be tricky to go that far, but it\u2019s okay. But it\u2019s not good to kill a recovery magician. It\u2019s worse than killing Yamiyo.\u201dThere are only 30 recovery wizards in Japan. Killing her would be a crime, even if he is the duke\u2019s son. Masatoshi is well aware of his position. He is not a small villain who acts without thinking. He\u2019s not like Masatoshi in the novel.What happens if the recovery magician dies? Masatoshi is a character who is not in the main storyline, but regardless of the storyline, he must be in a bad position. His younger brother is weaker than he is, but there is not much difference in talent. He could even be ruined by having his heirship taken away before the main storyline begins.The Dukes of Aguuni, where Masatoshi is from, have money and power. However, there was no love for family. There is a possibility Masatoshi will be mercilessly cut down and thrown out to a branch family, where he will live like a slave to be worked hard in a dungeon.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable. I\u2019ll order the golem not to kill that cutie.\u201dMasatoshi likes that girl. Because she is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen, who is not involved in the main storyline. And she has silver hair. Masatoshi liked the silver-haired character.Being a big fan of the original story, Masatoshi suspected that in acquiring the heroines, there was a world fate, a kind of story compensation.His dueling events would prove that. If the story correction works, I lose. But if not, Masatoshi would win. It was a gamble, but one he could not escape. Well, he thinks he will win. Because he has trained and become stronger. There is no problem with a correction when it comes to combat.But the human heart is different. It may be difficult to get anything other than a foolish heroine who makes herself the object of a bet. Because events are just the tip of the iceberg. Perhaps because there is a buildup with the heroine, etc., and the heroine is likely to like the hero. It is indeed impossible to interrupt all the events.There is still time before entering the academy, so Masatoshi cannot confirm this, but if there is a story correction, it is difficult to get the heroine even if he can defeat the hero. But that girl is a character that is not in the original story. He could take action to get her without thinking about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A Perfect And Complete Operation-Masatoshi\u2019s POV-Of course, it would be difficult in real life because she is a recovery magician, but it is far better than appealing to the heroine with a suspicion that there is a story correction.Masatoshi is a big fan of the original story, so he remembers the events of the heroes. But in reality, it\u2019s a crapshoot. The hero conveniently saves the heroine from monsters. The hero unknowingly says the words the heroine wants, and she falls in love with them. If the hero mistakenly enters the women\u2019s bath, an erotic event with the heroine will start, which is unacceptable in reality.Moreover, it would be almost impossible to prevent it because it isn\u2019t clear when it will start. There is no description in the novel as to what day, time, or minute the event will take place.So Masatoshi has given up on that. Because he gave up on that, he was concerned about a beautiful girl who was not involved in the story. He wants to get the beautiful girl who survived the action done by the reincarnated Yamiyo.Therefore, Masatoshi tried to order the stone golem with the thought of not attacking only that beautiful girl. He can\u2019t harm her anyway. There is no problem if we leave her alone.\u201cNo, it\u2019s good to help her in a crisis. I\u2019m going to play the hero like I\u2019m the hero.\u201dThe stone golem runs amok. Glancing back, Masatoshi glances at those standing in fear and bewilderment. They want to stop Masatoshi, but they are too troubled to admonish him, knowing his ferocious nature.Just use one of them as a scapegoat. An inexperienced vassal let it go out of control in an attempt to test the summoned gem. And the duke\u2019s genius flame user would prevent it. That way, Masatoshi would not have to kill Yamiyo. He will not be in a bad position.All is perfect, Masatoshi said and gave the order to the stone golem.[Golem. Do not attack the beautiful gray-haired girl and the black-haired girl. Kill the rest.]We\u2019ll see what happens. The gray-haired girl is in front of the stone golem. But stone golem should ignore her. That\u2019s what Masatoshi thought.However, the stone golem reacts to the approaching gray-haired beauty and tries to raise its arm to knock her down, only to be stopped by a light chain.\u201cHey! Hey, golem! That beautiful girl is not to be included in the attack!\u201dImpatiently, Masatohi utters the words. As Yamiyo and the others approach, they react and move just as violently, and the stone golem tries to lash out.\u201cYoung master. \u2026The golem cannot recognize anyone but the Lord Duke. All of them are enemies. Therefore, you should stay from the summoned beast when using them.\u201dAs the butler approaches fearfully, he tells Masatoshi some unexpected words.\u201cWhat! I didn\u2019t hear you say that! No, so the guys who used them only used them one at a time.\u201dMasatoshi recalls the original story. The enemy organization uses powerful summoned beasts that even the protagonist struggles with, but he\u2019s always thought they should use them in large numbers. At that time, he was convinced that it would be opportunism unique to novels. When it comes to reality, he\u2019s astonished that this is how it gets set up. He had always thought they do not use them simply because they were rare and expensive.Masatoshi had covered the original story and read up on magic and other settings. He had thought Masatoshi was synonymous with God, but when the specifications got explained to him, he didn\u2019t listen. He would send mana and act according to my orders. That was enough.\u201cDamn! What am I going to do? Do we evacuate the stone golem?\u201dHaving no choice, Masatoshi thinks about putting the stone golem back. He wanted to enjoy watching the adventurers turn into pathetic mincemeat, but he must not mistake his priorities.Preventing his destruction is Masatoshi\u2019s top priority. The fate of those who got reincarnated into the mobs. It\u2019s the usual template. But if his life is on the line. He can\u2019t snicker at the usual templates. Prevent destruction. That is the top priority for Masatoshi.So Masatoshi tried to order the stone golem to stop its combat action and come to him. The magic chain would not last long. Soon the adventurer\u2019s mana would run out.\u201cRetreat\u2026 n?\u201dI looked at the stone golem, trying to send a thought.Masatoshi saw a sight beyond his imagination.\u201cToriaaaa!\u201dA beautiful gray-haired girl shouted in a voice that echoed up here and swung her matchstick-like mace down on the stone golem with all her might.It was an attack that did not hurt the stone golem, but somehow the stone golem was shaken, and its body, which was the same hardness as a jewel, was beginning to crack.\u201cHuh? Wait, wait, wait, wait! Could that girl possibly could use a strong martial art on the stone?\u201dSurprised, Masatoshi took his face away from the binoculars and was astonished. Looking through the binoculars again, the gray-haired girl attacks more and more. With each attack, the cracks on the stone golem grow larger.\u201cHey, that\u2019s 3 billion yen! Stop, stop it~!\u201dThe stone golem is 3 billion dollars worth of magical jewelry. And it\u2019s rare and hard to find one. If the summoned beast is destroyed, the jewel will shatter and become trash.Screaming and panicking, Masatoshi forgot to return the stone golem and watched the mysterious scene.So the stone golem, which was supposed to be destroyed, tore off the light chain and began to attack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When You See A Rock, It\u2019s Mining, Right?-Miu\u2019s POV-It\u2019s about Miu\u2019s previous life.Or rather, it\u2019s a memory of a game.[Would you mine the rare ore at the Gunma mine?][Yes.][However, the ore at the Gumma Mine has magical power and transforms into a golem. Please mine it without attacking it][Yes?]There was a sub-story that went something like this. It was a story initiated when I went to mine some alchemy materials.I held the controller and tilted my head. It was an event where you were not allowed to defeat the attacker.You had to hit the golems that appeared in the mine with the [Mine] command. It was a shameless story in which I got beaten to a pulp while I mine and beat the golem\u2019s body.I remember it was an extremely painful event because no matter how strong I was, I had to [Mine] a certain number of times to defeat it. I was a [Holy Knight], the composite job with the highest defense, and I went in.The boss magic golem fired missiles and beams, and I had a terrifyingly difficult fight. It\u2019s impossible to destroy it unless you hit it 100 times. It was the work of selecting the [Mine] command, work. The mined materials were of good quality. There was some doubt whether ore obtained by hitting golems could be called mining.Incidentally, there was no mining work in the original story. There was only one event in which the hero\u2019s parents were cursed and had to go to a dungeon to collect a rare magical flower to undo the curse.In the game, there was. Because there was a job called [Alchemist]. You had to collect materials and make items in an alchemy kiln. You could change the game title to \u201cFantasy Dragon World Tree Reincarnation Atelier\u201d. It\u2019s not a good word, right? I think the production company is awesome.And the golem only appeared in the mine. I want to say thank you for being so elaborate. In reality, golems appear in places other than mines. Then I guess I\u2019ll have to [Mine] it. I\u2019m mining in the face of a mass of rock. It\u2019s a game player\u2019s instinct.\u201cTori-ya!\u201d[Mine]With a crack, my all-out blow slams into the stone golem with all the force of a 9 year old girl. It\u2019s a weak blow. She even stumbles when she raises her mace as high as she can, but it\u2019s still a \u201cmining\u201d action.[Mine]Ting[Mine]TingThe stone golem makes a metallic sound that is impossible with hard stone. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working, but I believe in the game\u2019s power.I believe in the game power.The game\u2019s specifications reside inside me.It\u2019s not very cool.I\u2019m not going to let anyone die. It\u2019s bad for the kids\u2019 education!\u201cWhoa!\u201dI, the gray-haired beauty slam my mace down with a clattering sound like the tinkling of a pretty bell. Using my small body to its fullest, I use my slender arms to strike the mace with all my might.Yamiyo and the others watch Miu\u2019s actions without restraining her. They\u2019re watching me as if I was the poster child of a ferocious and demonic beast.I smack it about ten times, and it cracks the entire body of the stone golem, a stone golem as hard as a gemstone, five meters long. My reach is less than a meter. Even with my mace, my reach is less than two meters. The attack had hit the stone golem in the leg.And yet, the stone golem\u2019s entire body cracked. With a pitter-pattering sound, the stone body flopped down from the crack.I grinned, peeled my double teeth, and laughed at the situation. It\u2019s as I expected. Just like the effects in the game. This world is based on the novel. However, there are many times when the game\u2019s specifications can overcome the novel\u2019s setting. That\u2019s because they created the game after the novel\u2019s completion. The game setting, which overrides the novel\u2019s setting, seems to have affected the game.The production company didn\u2019t care if they destroyed the original work many times. Moreover, the novel\u2019s rough setting got made detailed in the game. It was as if they were building a world.That\u2019s why I thought the stone golem was about to crack.\u201cOh! That hard stone golem is!\u201d\u201cAs expected of Mii-Sama!\u201dThe instructors became surprised, and Yamiyo\u2019s eyes lit up, impressed.I slam the mace down on it and try to destroy it. But the swinging speed is slow, and I attack with all my might one at a time. It takes time.The cracks are getting bigger. I thought I would be able to destroy it a few more times. The stone golem got bound by chains of light and couldn\u2019t move.\u201cGuoh!\u201dThe stone golem, which should be a golem that never screams, lets out a yell as a crack in its rock face opens wide as a mouth.\u201cGwah!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve run out of mana!\u201dThe guards\u2019 mana ran out, and the chains of light broke free. The stone golem got released from its restraints.The stone golem\u2019s rock legs made a hole in the ground, and it glared at me as he stepped hard.\u201cI thought you would!\u201dI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to beat it with a perfect seal. It was a template by any stretch of the imagination. The stone golem got sealed at the start, and at the end, it\u2019s got released, and we\u2019re in battle. It\u2019s definite development.The stone golem raises its arm and comes roaring toward me. If it hits me, it will be a hamburger of Miu. I can\u2019t let that happen.The punch comes at me with a booming sound. It was as if a chunk of rock was falling in front of me. The 9 year old girl got crushed by the rock, and it was game over.\u201cI\u2019m not going to go with that!\u201d[Run Away]I select another command. With a squeak, the magic armor I\u2019m wearing Activated. The armor of each part of the magic armor which looks like a combination of a white priest\u2019s uniform and a leotard, deployed, and mana circulates my body.Feeling the fullness of power, I jumped to the side. The stone golem\u2019s punch dug into the spot where I had been, and it got deeply buried in the ground.A cloud of dust and broken pieces of pebbles hit me. With a \u201ckororin kororin,\u201d I roll backward and quickly pick myself up. It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019ve been doing this practice. I\u2019ve been practicing since kindergarten, so I\u2019m a master.[Run Away]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When You See a Rock, It\u2019s Mining, Right?-Miu\u2019s POV-This command allows me to run away from an enemy by increasing my speed. The [Run Away] command let me run from any fast enemy. It is limited to non-bosses, though.I tried it secretly against a skeleton, and the command made me faster than the enemy. Only increase a little bit. That is probably because of the pattern of enemies going around me. However, it is a specification to make it possible to escape.That is, I could act a little faster than the stone golem. The command weakness is that I only have to take an attack position. The [Run Away] cancels the magic armor and makes it stop. It\u2019s a fatal weakness, where I can\u2019t use it to attack. But in this situation, it\u2019s not much of a problem. It\u2019s not much. I think there is, but not much.The stone golem is closing in on me and launching fist after fist at me. Its attack speed is fast. If I had not selected the [Run Away] command, I would not have been able to react.But I can see it now. I may not be a newbie, but I\u2019m a mob bishoujo, and I can see it.\u201cYotto!\u201dBoom, boom, big hole in the ground, like a pile-driver, the stone golem attacks, but its attack is simple. It only swings and slams at me. Still, its fist speed is so fast that even a level 20 adventurer can\u2019t evade it, but I\u2019m a little faster than that, and I\u2019m in full view of what it did.\u201cHey, hey, the pitcher\u2019s scared!\u201dI zig-zag on the taps, making light jokes. Even a mid-size bike can\u2019t keep up with me.But the [Run Away] command has its disadvantages, of course.\u201cGgh!\u201dThe pieces of stone shattered by the stone golem\u2019s attack hit my body like bullets. The magic barrier mitigates the attack, but the impact is still enough to make me stop breathing.The [Run Away] command set me to run away in a defensive posture, which also reduces the damage I take. However, the difference in level is so great that even a single snatch would cause me to take heavy damage.The stone golem is coming up behind me and attacking me. The stone projectiles flying in with a cloud of dust are steadily chipping away at my HP.Pieces of my helmet are bounced off, and blood pours from my head. Every part of my body hurts, especially my back. I\u2019m covered in blue bruises, a terrible monster for such a beautiful girl.When I check the status board, my HP is displayed in (HP 3) bright red letters. It looks like I\u2019m dying.[Minor Heal II]I use recovery magic on myself. It is a slightly more powerful II magic. The effect is extraordinary, and as soon as a pale light covers my body, the blood stops flowing, and the pain in my body is gone.However, I only have 1 MP left. I turn around and hold out my hands.[Turn Undead]The stone golem shakes its body as if frightened by the intense light. Okay, the [Turn Undead] also has the flash effect.As soon as I choose [Mine], the magic of the magic armor is stored. It determined that [Run Away] was stopped. Since I can use recovery magic and [Turn Undead] outside of combat, it appears that I\u2019m not violating the rule.\u201cToriaaaa!\u201dI raised my mace and struck it with all my might. In addition, the stone golem\u2019s torso cracks and falls apart.\u201cHere\u2019s the last one, one more!\u201dI raise my mace further and attack the stone golem. Finally, the stone golem was covered in cracks, and I thought it fall over, but it glared at me with ghostly eyes glowing deep in its face.\u201cGeez! Did I count wrong?\u201dI must have hit it 30 times, but I seemed to have miscounted. I was in such bad shape that I was sure I would break if I touched it, but it still raised its fist in the air, unafraid.\u201cOh no, am I dead?\u201dI try to defend myself with my mace as a shield. But at my level, I can\u2019t block the stone golem\u2019s punch.I immediately select the [Run Away] command, but the deployment of the magic armor is slow. I was afraid of this, but still, I was not frightened. It is different from the time of Yamiyo.[Dark Sword Type 1, Giant Wreckage Sword]Yamiyo raised her sword with a sharp cry. A large number of skeletons appeared on the sword, combined, and in no time at all, it became huge, turning into a sword with a blade 10 meters long with an eerie combination of bones.\u201cHah!\u201dWaving her pigtails, the black-haired beauty lunges at the stone golem, and with light in her eyes, she swings down the giant sword of bone.With a crackling sound, the stone golem blows away and rolls to the ground, sending a cloud of dust into the air.\u201cNice one, Yamiyo!\u201dI have friends, you know. I knew they would come in to help. I gave her a thumbs up, and a smirk and Yamiyo sat up, perhaps using up all her mana, but still smiling back at me fearlessly.I raised my mace and ran to the stone golem. I took an attack position, so the magic armor stopped, and I had no choice.\u201cI got it!\u201dAs I try to slam my mace into the fallen stone golem, the stone golem gets up and unleashes a fist. But I\u2019ve already chosen [Mine].The rocky fist is close to me, but I don\u2019t care, I [Mine] it with my mace.The stone golem\u2019s fist and my mace collide, creating a shockwave of mana.\u201cGuaaa!\u201dI was the winner. The stone golem\u2019s fist shatters into small pieces of stone, and it falls to the ground with an ear-shattering scream.\u201cOuchie!\u201dI, too, was shocked and blown away. I\u2019m glad I did that, practicing the backward somersault.I was thrown to the ground and got covered with scratches. I\u2019ll have to practice ukemi next time.[Acquired 10 rocks, 3 magic irons, and earth topaz!]The result gets displayed in front of me.Of course, there is no experience because it is [mining]. Let me repeat. I don\u2019t get any experience.\u201cThat\u2019s why I hate this event.\u201dCackling, I fell on my back and fainted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Apologies Are For ProfitThe Marquis of Teijo\u2019s house is a Japanese-style mansion. The Marquis of Teijo is a family of warriors and is said to be a sword that protects people from demons.True to their image as warriors, the Marquis of Teijo\u2019s house built their house in a Japanese-style mansion. The houses lined up in a row were like a throwback to the Heian period, and it would not be surprising if they were palaces somewhere.As one might expect in today\u2019s world, there are reinforced concrete buildings and three-story buildings, but the main family still lives in a one-story house in the city center. The way they used the land made people who saw it know the wealth and power of the Marquis Teijo.But today\u2019s world requires tight security in science and magic, so they also install secret surveillance cameras, infrared sensors, magic sensing, and other devices.And although they are known for their frugality, behind the scenes, high-ranking nobles knew the Teijos were skilled in the art of intrigue so they can order to maintain the power of the marquis family.Although it is necessary to be modest, there is no such thing as a family that is devoted solely to military affairs and does not get involved in politics. Those who say they are devoted to the military got eaten, and not a bone remains.Reality is a harsh world. It is not a pretty sight to have power, maintain financial strength, and hold military power.The world of politics is a dark world where evil spirits of the mountains and rivers reside. Behind the simple but solidity, there is also a cunning political power. Such is the case with the Marquis of Teijo.In the house of the Marquis of Teijo, a lot of people gather in the main residence hall. It is a rarely used room with dozens of tatami mats and is used for large discussions.At the seat of honor sat cross-legged Teijo Ouga, and next to him was Takano Yoshiyuki. An elite clan member with a sword at his waist sits by the wall with a stern look.A man in a suit and a small child is sitting facing each other, and behind them are men with swords on their hips.\u201cYou Idiot!\u201dThe man in the suit\u2019s face was red with rage, as was his flaming red hair. He was yelling in rage at the child sitting next to him.His physique is 190 centimeters, and because he\u2019s so well-trained his muscular armor makes his suit pop. His countenance was rude, violent, and fiery, and he was the kind of man who gave the impression that the mere touch of him would bring him into a fight.\u201cHow dare you put the Marquis of Teijo and the Count of Takano\u2019s daughters in danger, you stupid!\u201d\u201cGuh!\u201dWith his anger intact, the man punches the little boy hard on the cheek. The boy gets hit so hard that the boy blows away and falls, scraping the tatami mats.But seeing that the man\u2019s agitated expression does not subside, the boy staggers to his feet and bows his head deeply.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father.\u201dIt was Masatoshi who answered with a mixture of tears. His cheeks get swollen, and his skin was bleeding internally from rubbing against the tatami mats, oozing blood and pain.The man called \u201cfather\u201d was the head of Aguni, Aguni Enra. He may look like a rough and rude man, but he is the head of the Dukes of Aguni and is also a skilled magician who is said to be number one in the world in terms of manipulating flames.Perhaps the fiery red hair also resides in his personality, his angry expression doesn\u2019t disappear, and he yells even more.\u201cYou ain\u2019t apologizing to me! It\u2019s Teijo-san and Takano-san!\u201d\u201cHa, yes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dMasatoshi trembled, crawled on the tatami, and got down on his knees. It was the apology of a young child, only 9 years old. And he is on his knees, tears streaming down his face.It would have been easy for him to accept the apology and say it was okay, but he remained calm and did not change. Yoshiyuki\u2019s face turned somber, but he still kept his mouth tightly knit and did not speak a word of forgiveness.Seeing this, Enra sat back down and bowed deeply.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was my lack of education. I never thought my stupid son would think of using a summoned beast for fun.\u201dThe duke\u2019s guards sitting behind him are slightly surprised by the duke\u2019s apology. It\u2019s an apology from the head of the family himself, who rarely bows his head. After receiving his apology, Ouga finally opened his mouth.\u201cThis matter. You understand that we can\u2019t just let it slide. How do you plan to settle the matter?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s true, I would like to remove this foolish son from the line of heirs, throw him out, and use it as an apology.\u201dMasatoshi\u2019s face paled, and his body trembled at Enra\u2019s words. But Enra continues to speak.\u201cBut this guy is only 9 years old. Moreover, it was Masatoshi\u2019s subordinates who caused the summoned beasts to run wild. He said he was still young and wanted to see the summoned beasts, so he forced his subordinates to fail. Don\u2019t you think so, Yoshiyuki-san?\u201d\u201cYes. It is true. However, we don\u2019t believe we should give him a warning here.\u201dThree days had passed since the stone golem incident. The stone golem runaway incident was the result of Masatoshi\u2019s coercion to see a summoned beast, and his subordinate summon a summoned beast from a magical jewel. But because he had no experience controlling summoned beasts, he let it run out of control.It was such a tragic incident. Fortunately, there were some injuries, but no fatalities. Miu healed the injured people. So there were no problems, but one wrong move, and there would have been deaths. The victims were the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Teijo and a recovery magician daughter of the Count of Takano, so Enraku had to cancel all his schedules on short notice and came to apologize.Yamiyo and Miu were not allowed to be present. That was because the two kind people, especially Miu, might be bonded by Masatoshi\u2019s apology and forgive him. However, this was an incident that could have resulted in death. Because forgiveness was not an easy thing to do, Ouga and Yoshiyuki decided to handle the situation together.\u201cThank you! I am relieved to hear you say so. I didn\u2019t want to let my son go, either.\u201dEnraku once again bowed his head deeply to express his gratitude. Yoshiyuki, who got exiled from the Count Takano family, relaxes his face, thinking that this is not someone else\u2019s problem. After all, Masatoshi is only 9 years old, so he thought it would be good if Masatoshi apologized, and his face became gentle.Miu was safe, and as a matter of fact, she could have escaped, but his daughter had rushed forward to defeat the stone golem. As always, he was proud of his daughter\u2019s strong sense of justice, but on the other hand, he also wished she would take better care of herself.But Teijo Ouga was looking at him with ruthless eyes, and he did not open his mouth to say a single word. Seeing this, Enraku removed his hand from his face and signaled his subordinate behind him with his eyes.Enraku\u2019s subordinate brought a sturdy-looking silver trunk case, placed it between the three of them, and opened it with a crack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Apologies Are For Profit\u201cAguni-san, what is this?\u201dOuga asks Enraku when he sees the contents with one eyebrow twitching. Enraku slapped his thigh with a snap, smiled boldly, and held out the trunk case to Ouga and the others.\u201cI apologize for what happened. I\u2019m sorry for deciding to do this on my own. But I\u2019ll give this to you in the hope we can prevent something like this from happening again.\u201dThe trunk case is opened. Its contents are a paulownia box covered in shock-absorbent material. No, it was rubies and emeralds inside a paulownia box.As evidence of magic, rubies contain fire magic, and emeralds contain wind magic.\u201cThe fiery ruby is inhabited by the summoned beast Salamander, for Teijo-san. And the windy emerald is inhabited by the summoned beast Griffon, to Takano-san as an apology.\u201d\u201cMagical jewels! That must be a terrible amount of money! I cannot accept it!\u201dYoshiyuki, who works for the Ministry of Magic, is astonished because he knows how much this jewel is worth and how rare and magical the item is. It is a magical jewel that would be worth at least three billion.Even though Miu\u2019s life was in danger, this was too much to take. Yoshiyuki tries to return it, but Enraku holds him back with a wide, glove-like hand.\u201cTake it. That\u2019s how important your children are to me. I honestly don\u2019t think I can afford this.\u201dEnraku, who would be called a fierce general in this day and age, showed his good spirit and grinned.\u201cIn dangerous times like this, that magic jewelry will come in handy. I wouldn\u2019t you mind selling it, since it\u2019s an apology gift, but if you let Takano-san\u2019s daughter have it, it will be less dangerous, don\u2019t you think?\u201dMiu might do something reckless in the future. Yoshiyuki shuts down and shows hesitation, thinking that if she had this jewelry at that time, she might get saved, although if she usually has it, Miu could get kidnapped too.\u201cYou should only let her have it when she\u2019s going into the dungeon. It\u2019s a safeguard, right? Yoshiyuki-san.\u201dAs if reading Yoshiyuki\u2019s mind, Enraku\u2019s smile deepens, and he recommends the jewelry. Frankly, Yoshiyuki hesitates, his heart wavering. For the lovely Miu, this jewelry would be a unique protection. Above all, Yoshiyuki cares about his wife and child.Seeing his hesitation, Ouga exhales slightly and calls out to Yoshiyuki.\u201cYoshiyuki-san, I thought it would not be a problem if you gave it to me. Oh, I\u2019m fine with the ruby. I\u2019ll have you pay me twice the market value of this gem in cash. Of course, without transfer tax.\u201dOuga and Enraku\u2019s gazes collided, and a vision of sparks flew, the people around them thought. It created a tense atmosphere, and they felt tingling on their skin, but Enraku immediately relaxed his mouth and exhaled.\u201cWhew. I see. I understand. Give me a week.\u201d\u201cFine, I\u2019m unwilling to do so, but I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201dThe two men exchanged 10 billion yen, a sum of money that a commoner could neither see nor touch, with a light touch, as if they were playing catch with a ball.Yoshiyuki breaks out in a cold sweat when Enraku\u2019s attitude tells him, even if he doesn\u2019t like it, that Enraku is a high-ranking noble.\u201cWell, then, we\u2019re done here. Good. Masatoshi, you idiot, you should be sorry!\u201dEnraku laughed boldly and punched Masatoshi on the cheek. There was a crack, and Masatoshi rolled on the floor again and get blown away.\u201cHyah, hyah, I, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201dNose bleeding, teeth are broken, albeit baby teeth, and mouth bleeding, Masatoshi utters an apology.Aguni Enraku. He was a great flame wielder, the head of a duke family, and a famous man with a bold, open mind and a good temper.Thus, the Stone Golem Incident ended with heavy damage to Duke Aguni.The other is a man with a good temperament, Aguni Duke\u2019s Enraku, who is the counterpart of Teijou Ouga, a famous martial arts master with a solid and sturdy character. It was a scene that showed his character.Of course, this is only a superficial story.After all, Enaku\u2019s smile had deepened, and he was in a good mood when he returned home. His face was no longer the boldness it had been a moment ago but had a cunning smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My 9 year old\u2019s body is on its feet from a powerful fist blow from my merciless father. I cannot stop shaking. His body was also trembling because he was afraid of the angry Enraku.The Duke of Aguni is a loveless family. But I knew from the novel that this father was not ruthless.Enraku is a bold and openhearted warrior. He prefers people who are powerful and hot-blooded. Therefore, he disliked people like Masatoshi who, without an effort, lived by gouging servants, making cronies, and playing around with them, backed by the power of the duke\u2019s family.In the novel, Enraku likes it when the hero comes to undergo the trial by fire with Masatoshi\u2019s victorious brother and shows his strength. He is a dependable man who has supported the hero many times since then.However, Enraku apologizes to the protagonist for shutting his eyes because Masatoshi was the eldest son and his power was excellent.I knew this, but I lived by the same character as in the novel, thinking that if that was the case, I should not make a fatal mistake so that I would not get disowned from my position as a legitimate son.After all, as I found out when I tried it, it was wonderfully pleasurable to beat and kick the servants and have them give me sneering looks as if they were always looking at my face.It was different from Masatoshi\u2019s previous life. His parents would look at me with disdain and tell me it was time for me to get a job, and that he was a joke. It was his parents\u2019 fault for being stingy with money and not sending me to college. Why did they look at him with such contempt? He always had a smoldering dissatisfaction in his heart.That is why I decided to live this life as I pleased. The pleasure of a good beating. The servants\u2019 way of running away from me in front of the fire magic. It was wonderful.Even if I did such a terrible thing, until I lost to the protagonist, I was still in the position of Duke Aguni\u2019s heir. I assumed that Enraku was an old-fashioned character.That was why I was afraid of failing this time. There was a possibility that I would get disowned from my position as a legitimate heir.I also thought I might get beaten, so I glanced at my father who sat across from me, and folded his arms. When my father noticed his\u2019s gaze, Enraku brought his face close to me and violently pulled my hair.I winces in pain, but then Enraku opens his mouth and tells me.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do a little better than that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI open my mouth to ask, my mouth gaping open at my father\u2019s unexpected words. Enraku throws me down roughly and sits up deeper in me chair, and Enraku smiles at me with an intimidating grin.\u201cWhat did you want to do? Did you want to see the power of the Marquis? Was it to tease me? Either way, it was a stupid thing to do. I didn\u2019t expect the stone golem to get destroyed, and I didn\u2019t expect Teijo\u2019s and Takano\u2019s daughters to stand up to it instead of running away. Usually, they run away.\u201d\u201cWell, uh, I wanted to make a connection with a girl who is a, uh, woman, a recovery magician, you know, \u2026\u2026\u2026. I thought if I helped her, we\u2019d get along, you know.\u201dI can\u2019t say that I wanted to measure the power of the reincarnated person. And there is also some truth mixed in, and I\u2019m not lying.\u201cYou\u2019re playing prince on a white horse. You\u2019re a kid. Well, good. Now you\u2019ve made a connection. It\u2019s a good story for the Aguni family. Well done.\u201d\u201cWe, well done?\u201dI was so shocked that he repeated it like a parrot, but Enraku began amusedly explaining it.\u201cA 9 year old girl destroyed the stone golem. According to those who were watching the battle, she didn\u2019t even send mana to her magic armor, and she put all her mana into the mace to defeat it.\u201d\u201cYe, yes. That is correct, Father.\u201dI also saw the stone golem get destroyed. It\u2019s unbelievable, but she crushed the stone golem with a single mace. And she did it without activating her magic armor. Since she had activated her magic armor when she escaped, it was clear that she was using a rough trick of pouring all her mana into her mace when he attacked.\u201cThen. Miu has enough mana to defeat the stone golem. That\u2019s a huge amount. Our recovery magicians can\u2019t even compare to that.\u201dThere are two recovery magicians in the Aguni family. Both have the power to heal deep wounds, although they cannot heal the disabled. However, they do not have much mana, after using it twice a day, their mana was empty.\u201cYou made a connection with such a girl. Bad karma is part of karma. You could send her a gift, invite her to a party or on a trip as an apology. You want to surround her at home. That\u2019s why I gave her an expensive and rare magic jewel as a wabi gift. Since Takano Yoshiyuki seems like a good man, he\u2019ll remember the magical jewelry you gave him and will find it hard to refuse.\u201d\u201cHah, haha\u2026\u2026 but that girl is surrounded by Marquis Teijo family, father.\u201d\u201cWell. It would have been nice if Marquis Teijo could receive the ruby. Then, one of the Marquis Teijo received the ruby of the salamander, which is the symbol of fire, and it became a rumor that they joined our faction and became affiliated with it. I was able to let it flow, but that bastard read it. I bet he wanted to tell Takano not to accept the emerald, but he must have stopped when he saw Takano trying to accept it for his daughter\u2019s sake. Because it gives him a bad impression.\u201d\u201cThere, did father give the ruby with that much thought in mind?\u201dI recall the situation before, but I did not understand that such speculation was mixed. I realize my father\u2019s intentions on that occasion and is terrified by Teijou Ouga\u2019s replies he\u2019d receive the reward in cash.Of course, it goes without saying about the father in front of him.\u201cHigh-ranking nobles, you know, they give meaning to mere behavior. You are only 9 year old, but you are the heir to the dukedom. Remember that. Your little brother is too obedient, which makes me uneasy.\u201dI shivered with surprise, feeling something cold running down my back. I had just caught a glimpse of the horror of the high nobility.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was a passionate man with a sense of justice, without thinking about anything complicated. He is the kind of man who I can perfectly describe as a man who rushes headlong with the hero. That\u2019s because he is my, Masatoshi\u2019s brother.I never thought he would be able to meet my father\u2019s expectations. And now I understood why I had not been forced out of my position as an heir apparent.\u201cWell, I knew Teijo would be suspicious and not accept our apology. I was just lucky if it worked out.\u201dMy father didn\u2019t think it would go well. If I were in Teijo\u2019s shoes, I would gladly accept the ruby.\u201cI still have a plan. This one is the real deal.\u201d\u201cA plan?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll spread the word. The Teijo family has taken on and entrusted a rare recovery magician as an escort, yet they put her in danger. Since they are inadequate as guards, the Takano\u2019s daughter always keeps the magical jewelry given to her by Duke Aguni in her pocket.\u201dIt was a vicious idea. It made sense for my father to give her the emerald. I\u2019m surprised and suddenly embarrassed that I\u2019m thinking of such a dreary idea as \u201cSucking back\u201d at the protagonist.But I quickly discarded the idea. I want to do the opposite and see the faces of the hero and heroine in despair. I shake my head to get rid of the feeling of shame from my memory, saying that I have thought a foolish thing.I am a god. I know the story of The Night of Magic until the last episode, and I have read the novel book. I know the characters\u2019 personalities because I read the novel where they came from. I am a divine being. I can do whatever I want.When I regain my composure, I turn my attention to the story with my father.\u201cCan you do something about that level of rumor?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t think so.\u201dMy father answers. I think that would be a waste of time, but I can read what my father thinks by the look on his face, and his father snickers.\u201cI\u2019m teaming up with Count Takano family. Remember when I mentioned Count Takano when I was apologizing to you? That\u2019s right. I expressed in\u00a0 one word that I consider the young lady who is a recovery magician to be a member of the Count family.\u201d\u201cHa, ha \u2026\u2026.\u201dI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with that and gave a vague answer.\u201cWell, you\u2019re only 9. It\u2019s not surprising if you don\u2019t know. Takano Miu is the daughter of Yoshiyuki, who gets thrown out of Count Takano family. The daughter of Yoshiyuki, who fell into commoner status, awakened as a recovery magician, so Count Takano family is in an uproar.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Recovery magicians are indeed rare, but she is the daughter of a fallen commoner, isn\u2019t she?\u201dNo longer able to comprehend what my father was saying, I repeated his words like a parrot.\u201cSince she fell into the commoner\u2019s hands, the head of the Takano Countdom family was in a hurry to welcome her. But you know, I don\u2019t know what happened there, but the Teijo family took it from the side. The Teijo family is the only family that doesn\u2019t have a recovery magician. They must have wanted it by all means.\u201dTaking out a bottle of whiskey from the small chest by the limousine door, Enraku opens the lid and drinks directly from it. He swallows the whiskey very fast and wipes the whiskey dripping from his mouth with his hand.\u201cOf course, Count Takano protested. But that place has been on the decline lately. The company\u2019s idiotic heir\u2019s son\u2019s business is full of losses. The family of the illegitimate son has a habit of spending lavishly, and his networking efforts are failing because he\u2019s hated for his arrogant attitude. The protests of the count\u2019s family, which has lost its power, won\u2019t hurt the Teijo family.\u201dWhether he was getting excited or wanted to talk about his strategy, Enraku is in a good mood took another gulp of his whiskey and emptied it, setting it down roughly on the table.\u201cBut hey, what Count Takano is saying is ostensibly quite decent. He wants to get back together with his son, whom he had thrown away. He wants to live with his lovely granddaughter. It is a story that invites the compassion of a poor old man. But the Marquis of Teijo is interfering with that. Even the Marquis is too outrageous.\u201d\u201cI see. \u2026\u2026 You\u2019re going to return them to nobility, aren\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any good story about going from a commoner back to the life of a noble.\u201dIt\u2019s a Cinderella story. I nod in agreement. That Cinderella\u2019s story befits that beautiful gray-haired girl.With a sly look in his eyes, Enraku laughed at my intention.\u201cRight. So that\u2019s why I can help some duke a little bit to get back the poor recovery magician girl. Fortunately, as an apology, an edge we could also make. Not right away, but maybe in a few years we can successfully get the Count back, and maybe she\u2019ll be engaged to our Dukedom.\u201dI looked at Enraku, who chuckled and could not hide my surprise that he was planning such a long-term plan to that extent.This had never happened in the novel. The plot was hatched in the first half, and the protagonist exposed the plot and played an active role in the second half. It was a plot that lasted about a week. Compared to that, it\u2019s roundabout, and cunning!Even in the original story, Enraku had a big laugh with gahaha and helped the hero when he liked it, but I can\u2019t describe his feelings. From his behavior, I had assumed he was a bold and simple righteous planner.But what if he was thinking of some conspiracy behind the scenes? What if he was using the main character\u2019s influence and power?I had thought that the original work and Enraku were too different, but perhaps he was this kind of character.Suddenly, I was horrified that the others might also be different from the original image. The heroines were simple-minded, but what if they only appeared like that but their true self different??\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be \u2026\u2026 that can\u2019t be true.\u201dMasatoshi tried to convince himself that he was an all-knowing god, but the lump in his heart would not go away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

School Scenery-Miu\u2019s POV-The bell rang, and I finished my work. No, I\u2019m done with class.I plop down on my desk and make a tired sound. I, Miu, a beautiful girl, sound cute even in my tired voice as if I\u2019m a pampered kitten. Hearing her voice, her classmates around her giggle and smile.It is a third grader, Miu Miu, a beautiful young girl. If you\u2019re going to have a photo session, please keep men off-limits.\u201cEn-chan, good night~.\u201dThe girl\u2019s carefree voice calls out to me, her silver hair flowing smoothly from her desk and a languid smile that suits her painted face.I lift my head and sleepily answer the girl who calls to me. As I try to answer her, I let out a yawn. Wow, I\u2019m sleepy.\u201cOh, you look so sleepy. Did you stay up late last night?\u201d\u201cNmmm, I stayed up late for the first time in a while.\u201d\u201cWhat time was it?\u201cOh no, it was 9:00 p.m.\u201dI was watching a special on a gourmet TV show called \u201cGottsan-desu,\u201d in which the audience guesses the price of a dish and those who answer wrong pay the bill. My mom got mad at me. She told me to go to bed. I want to try that foie gras terrine. I\u2019ve never had foie gras.So I\u2019m very sleepy. I\u2019m not yet fit to stay up late at night. I\u2019m too young.I say good night and try to close my eyes. How much is a ticket to the dream world? I\u2019ll give you a discount for a beautiful girl. I order a dream of eating foie gras terrine.\u201cDon\u2019t sleep~. Kon-chan, wake up Em-chan!\u201dThe girl holds her palm out above her head and uses mana. As the wind whips up softly, a magic circle is drawn, and a palm-sized little fox appears.\u201cKyan.\u201dIt makes a cute mewling sound, then shittily climbs onto my shoulder, pokes its head straight into my shoulder, and begins to lick my forehead, licking it.\u201cWaawawawa, stop, stop, stoop, stoop.\u201dI screamed and tried to grab Kon-chan as she licked my cheeks gooey, but she ran away a little bit, and I couldn\u2019t catch her.\u201cWake up, wake up~.\u201dWith a muffle, mischievous smile, she pokes me in the side, and I finally give in. Kankankankan.\u201cMuu~. I wanted to take a nap until you picked me up.\u201dI\u2019m a very unhappy Miu, with puffed-up cheeks. If it\u2019s just a trivial matter, I\u2019ll get angry.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Tamamo-chan?\u201dA young girl was standing in front of me, sniffling and snorting. She had blonde hair, blonde eyes, and an energetic, lively face. Her hair was in a side-tail, and she looked adorable.She is holding a fox cub about the size of a squirrel in her palm. It is the fox cub she summoned earlier.The name of this cute little girl, who smiles like a little animal, is Aburage Tamamogi-chan. She is a third grader like me. She is an energetic [Fox-User].[Fox-User] uses mana to summon and uses the foxes. They can use a variety of magic through the foxes. They\u2019re a special version of [Summoner]. Tamamo awakened to Mana last year. Her parents are both elite magicians.Now, have you figured it out? She\u2019s not an [Attribute User]. Yes, [Attribute] and [Job] only appeared in the game. In the original work, there are various magicians like this. Many high-ranking nobles have [Attribute], but there are also those with [Unique Magic]. That is indeed a material that is used in novels.Blonde hair is a sign that she has awakened to mana, but it does not mean that she has awakened to light or thunder.The [Fox-User] is similar to the [Summoner]. In the game adaptation, the concept of the forcefully created jobs is far and near, so you can see why it was called gray.Tamamo is playing with a hand-held fox cub she made with her mana. Kon-chan is running around Tamamo\u2019s body like a squirrel. She\u2019s so cute, I wonder if she\u2019ll give me one too. Imagine a beautiful girl and a fox cub. I can get a good shot of them, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure it will be a buzz.Tickling me with a giggle, Tamamo spins her body around with a laugh. The skirt of a cute uniform like the ones worn by idol groups in novels flutters and flutters.I wondered what it was all about, and while I was enjoying Tamamo\u2019s cute dance, my eyes widened slightly.However, the dancing Tamamo disappeared as she spun around. As if melting into the air, its body disappeared into a bubble.\u201cOh?\u201dIt was magic. Her body vanished. That\u2019s great, this girl.\u201cEhehe~. Can you see me? Hmmm, can\u2019t you see me? I guess that\u2019s the right way to say it.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see. That\u2019s great, Tamamo! You\u2019ve learned magic!\u201dAn empty space. It\u2019s not like visitors from outer space. When you look closely you can see space distorted like a mirage. You don\u2019t know where you are. I only hear voices from where I am.Well, I can see her. How I can see her when I think [Examine], a triangular cursor appears on what seems to be the top of Tamamoro\u2019s head. But if I don\u2019t think [Examine], I can\u2019t see her. So it\u2019s indeed a wonderful cheat.When I clapped my hands, my friends around me also looked surprised and clapped their hands. The sound of the girls clapping their hands spread throughout the classroom, and a warm and relaxed atmosphere filled the air.Yes, just the girls. A garden for girls. My school is a school for girls. It is a terrible place where there are only girls. Why is it scary? Because it\u2019s a school without men\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s not like a cartoon school for girls. I\u2019m only in the third grade, so I\u2019ll be fine.\u201cEhehe. It\u2019s a [Mirage] technique or Ko-gakume-sai?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s more powerful than optical camouflage. I can\u2019t see it. Is that what you wanted to show me?\u201dThe air didn\u2019t waver. But I was naive. I had underestimated the power of magic. I had yet to understand the world without levels.\u201cToyaa!\u201dWith a cute call, a beautiful gray-haired girl popped out of the space. She stepped on the tap, spun around, and struck a pose.\u201cThe most beautiful girl in the world just appeared!\u201d\u201cHaha, as expected of En-chan.\u201dFor some reason, Tamamo laughs, as if amused, when she hears my line. She looks like a beautiful girl I\u2019ve seen somewhere before, but where and who is she disguised as?Her hair is tousled, smooth, and silvery, and her lovely face, she\u2019s smiling, stretches to her back, is a sight to behold. Yes, she is the most beautiful girl in the world. I love her ice-blue eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201dWith a mischievous smile, Tamamo looks at me as if peeking into my face, but, to my surprise, it seems she has changed into me. I didn\u2019t notice it at all. I just looked like the most beautiful girl in the world.By the way, Em-chan is my nickname. Tamamo and I have been friends since kindergarten. Empress is my real nickname. I guess she\u2019s a fellow presser.I\u2019m embarrassed and bashful, and Tamamo laughs and pats her on the shoulder. Then she spins her body around again and is covered in smoke.\u201cTa-da!

You\u2019re a fox girl now.\u201dThere were werewolves, but there were no fox girls in the original story. Foxgirls are prominent, so if they existed in my hazy memory, I would remember them. Yeah, I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t there.In other words, Tamamo is a mob. She\u2019s a girl I can be friends with without worry. If she were a heroine, she might get involved in a troublesome storyline or something. I am still weak. I need to get stronger, or I\u2019ll be too scared to get involved with a heroine.\u201cI learned it yesterday!

Can I touch your ears and tail?\u201d\u201cHmmm, daddy and mommy said the same thing. Of course, you can!\u201dOh, Tamamo, what a good girl. I won\u2019t hesitate to touch them.I gently reach out and touch the golden, fluffy fox ears. Oh, they\u2019re so fluffy. It feels good to be soft and fluffy. I also reach out to touch the tail is just like a fox\u2019s scarf. Is that right?\u201cFluffy, fluffy!\u201d\u201cThen, me too.\u201d\u201cAh, me too\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so fluffy!\u201d\u201cFluffy, fluffy, fluffy\u2026\u201dYamiyo joins in the fluffing. We close our eyes and enjoy the softness of the softness. The gray-haired beauty, the dark-haired beauty, and the little girls enjoyed Tamamo\u2019s fox ears and tail, and she giggled ticklingly and got teary-eyed.After a moment of enjoyment and satisfaction, we returned to their seats. I was very satisfied. I\u2019m convinced that fox girls are the best thing that ever happened to me in real life.\u201cThank you, Tamamo-chan.\u201dNikori and I thanked her with satisfied and happy faces. I enjoyed it.\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind~.\u201dTamamo smiles smugly. She is a good and kind girl. I wish I could have one Tamamo in the family. I wonder if she\u2019ll share that little fox alone.Well, anyway, my sleepiness is gone. I should go home.\u201cWell, shall we go home?\u201dMaybe I should go home and have a snack. I (Miu) wonder what today\u2019s snack will be.\u201cOh, not just this! I\u2019m here to invite you to play with me on the way home.\u201dBut Tamamo didn\u2019t just come to show her fox transformation. She waved her little hands in the air. She had come to invite me to play with her.\u201cI see. What do you want to play with?\u201d\u201cHow about a float board?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201dWith a twinkle in my eye, I immediately agree and raise my small hand.This world. It\u2019s a modern fantasy, and many things are different from the world before. Playthings are one of them.Float board, let\u2019s play it. I\u2019m looking forward to it. I\u2019ll let my mom know I\u2019ll be making a side trip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s A Plaything of Modern Fantasy-Miu\u2019s POV-Modern fantasy. Science, Magic, and School. The name sounds like it could be a game name, but what happens when it becomes a reality?If this is a medieval fantasy, you can show the periodic table of elements with triumphant knowledge, saying that the power of science is incredible. I think the laws of physics will be different when there is magic, but that\u2019s how it is.But what happens when you reincarnate into a modern fantasy? A wizard with a knowledge of science would build a magical machine. Can a reincarnated person make a TV? Can knowledge warriors do it? The heat of the blue flame is higher than the blue one. No one will be impressed if you smugly explain what even a child knows.So, what do reincarnated people do?It\u2019s simple.They can use the TV by pressing a button on the remote control. The remote control in my previous life had so many buttons that I could not master it.Well, what I\u2019m trying to say is.\u201c[Float Boards] are a lot of fun, Tamamo-chan!\u201dWe\u2019re going to play without thinking. This is a world of modern fantasy. The magical technology that existed in the world of novels is beyond the scientific technology of the previous world. At any rate, it can jump over the laws of physics.There are also some interesting playthings. There are things like the playthings seen by the protagonist who went to the future on the dendrobium. The name of the time machine car is the dendrobium, right?We left the school and walked for a while. With my gray hair fluttering, I walked to my destination with a smile and a good mood.I\u2019m with Tamamo and three other girls. Yamiyo went home because she had training. I haven\u2019t been socializing well lately. If I don\u2019t play a lot as a child, I\u2019ll get a backlash when I\u2019m an adult, so I\u2019m going to force myself to ask them out this time.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201dTamamo says with a smile, holding a baby fox to her chest. Right in front of us was a massive facility with a sign that read, \u201cMagical Children\u2019s Amusement Park [Kan\u2019na]\u201d.It\u2019s not a video game arcade. Well, it\u2019s the same thing.\u201cTamamo is the First!\u201dTamamo walks in, laughing happily, with a small fox on her shoulder. The other children follow suit, yapping, and squealing. Of course, being the mentally mature person I am, I enter slowly, watching my friends with warm eyes.\u201cI won\u2019t lose! Wait for me!\u201dThat\u2019s what I thought, but my body dragged me along, and I (Miu) also ran after them with my gray hair in a swirl.The inside was air-conditioned, and a cool breeze caressed my skin. I was sweating a little, but the sweat soon receded. I might catch a cold, so I\u2019d better be careful.Inside, the ceiling is high, and it is a five-story building with a vaulted ceiling. The site is quite large and could probably accommodate two soccer fields.The place is full of many children. Children from schools in the area gather here. There is an automatic ticket checker, and when the children take out their annual passports from their school backpacks, they slide their passports through the checker and enter. An admission fee of 500 yen is required, but everyone has an annual passport. The yearly passport costs 20,000 yen. It costs extra money to play the games.My school is full of daughters from good families, and their parents are willing to pay this money for them. Some people think it is an athletic amusement park, just right for children to play.In my previous life, my parents would never have bought it for me because they thought it was a waste of money. But we are wealthy there. Yamiyo recommended this school to me. I\u2019m earning money too. I think. From time to time, the Teijo family asks me to heal injured people, and I use recovery magic.They can praise me (Miu) for being great because I\u2019m working at my age. My parents pat my head in praise. They don\u2019t ask how much money I make. My parents are raising me. I can help them make ends meet. I\u2019ll be an adventurer when I\u2019m over 12, and I\u2019ll make a lot of money.Or perhaps, they are sending injured people to me because they want me to practice recovery magic. I can\u2019t say that I won\u2019t fail, because it\u2019s a game specification. I fail when I get a stun attack or a magic seal.So I took out my annual passport from my school bag and caught up with everyone through the automatic ticket gate.I (Miu) was still mistaken. I still thought that there were a lot of recovery magicians around. The reason for this was to make me (Miu) think from an early age that I was an extraordinary person so my personality wouldn\u2019t get distorted, and because of this, she did not want people to know that she had a secret guard hiding in plain sight. The Teijo family had always had guards in hiding, but this was because they knew that if people knew they were always in such a situation, it would cause them great stress.Once inside, several counters served as reception for various games using magical tools. Holograms on the pillars displayed today\u2019s reservations, available games, and the dates and times of events.They also set up a food corner selling refreshments, as its target is the children of wealthy people.\u201cIt\u2019s such a disparity that it\u2019s easy to understand.\u201dThe children here are well-dressed, and some get accompanied by maids and butlers. I think they must be aristocrats. My friends are aristocrats and commoners, but they are still upper class.\u201cI know. There are slums on the other side of the street. Some can\u2019t afford to eat tomorrow, underworld organizations, and their bad groups.\u201dIn this world, there is a disparity between the nobility, the commoners, and the poor. The author of The Night of Magic must have thought it would be easier to create a story if there were disparities. Where there is a life of light, there is a life of darkness.Well, it\u2019s no use thinking about it. I\u2019m in the third grade. There is nothing I can do. All I (Miu) can do is protect my family and be strong. I have to protect Yamiyo too.Tamamo has already gone through the procedures at the \u201cFlying Board\u201d counter. She was used to doing this, so she typed in the necessary information on the touch monitor.\u201cEm-chan, your registration is done!\u201dKon-chan is on her shoulder and turns her chest away, and Tamamo proudly tells her ehehe.\u201cWow, I\u2019m so excited!\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to win today, Tamamo-chan.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to the food corner later.\u201dMy friends were also happy, innocently raising their hands in the air. By the way, they are cute little girls named Nan-chan, Sei-chan, and Hoku-chan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s A Plaything of Modern Fantasy-Miu\u2019s POV-\u201cThanks, Tamamo-chan! Let\u2019s go then!\u201dI smile as Tamamo hands us our cards, and I answer with a smile and run to the locker room.In the locker room, I\u2019m not particularly shy. I\u2019ve been a girl for 9 years now. I\u2019m used to it. I do feel a little guilty and immoral, though. I\u2019m a man at heart, so I\u2019d be embarrassed by an older woman.Everyone changed into their suit, which absorbs shocks like a tight-fitting mechanical leotard, and moved to the children\u2019s section of the [Floating Board]. These clothes are embarrassing, but I can\u2019t help it. What can I say? When I\u2019m older, I\u2019ll probably have a difficult time keeping my eyes open.As the name suggests, [Floating Board] is a game of riding on a floating board. I can tell by the children\u2019s toys that the technology is far superior to what it was in my previous life.There is a spacious gymnasium-like hall and a tube set up in the sky for racing. The floor is pliable like slime, and you can\u2019t hurt yourself if you fall. The tube is transparent and is called a soap tube, and again, even if you crash into it, you will not be hurt by the feeling of being hit by bubbles.It does come with the caveat that if you\u2019re going about 20 kilometers per hour.\u201cTamamo uses this board because it can turn in a small radius~.\u201dA [Floating Board] propped up against the wall. Well, it\u2019s a skateboard with no tires, but grabbing one of them, Tamamo jumps up and down and heads down the hall.It shows your personality to choose a [Floating Board]. My other friends also choose their boards and headed down the hall, giggling and laughing.I looked at the boards on the floor and wondered what to choose. The board with average acceleration and turning speed seems to be the most popular, and none left. Instead, there is one board that has not decreased in number.\u201cI\u2019ll take this one!\u201dWith tiny hands, I (Miu) pick up the board that has not been picked up a single time and run over to join my friends. The other kids have thin boards with colorful pictures, but mine is thicker and plainer.\u201cOh, you\u2019re using the Demon King board again!\u201d\u201cThis is my favorite!\u201dTamamo\u2019s cheeks puffed out in dissatisfaction. The other kids also laugh at my choice of strange board, so she smiles back at them.\u201cLet\u2019s play then!\u201dI press the button on the side of my helmet, and a bubble envelops my body. Now I won\u2019t get uninjured. [Flying Board] is a game that flies at a low altitude, so they consider the maximum safety.\u201cOkay then, [Floating Board 152 Activated].\u201dHoku-chan is the first to make the [Floating Board] float softly with a mysterious blue light. It is the power of the magic board.The difference from a skateboard is that it floats about one meter in the air from the ground. And when you get on the board, it starts moving as if it has an engine.The one for children can reach up to 20 kilometers per hour, but the hall is for practice, so people drive slowly and sluggishly. Once you get used to [Floating Board], you go into the tube and race.\u201cTeya~!\u201dSei-chan immediately gets on the board and glides down the hall. We\u2019ve played so many times. We\u2019re used to it.My friends around me get on too, and we glide into the hall. It was a fantasy to fly through the air, and I loved it right? I can\u2019t help but get excited because of the memories of my previous life.\u201cMe too~.\u201dI activate my [Floating Board] and try to enter the hall, but while everyone else is gliding in, I\u2019m the only one driving slowly. This board has extremely slow acceleration.Just as Sei and other ordinary people activate the [Floating Board], this can be used by non-magicians.That\u2019s why they don\u2019t call magicians for being dangerous. No, I\u2019m not just talking about the [Floating Board].[Floating Board] can be activated by ordinary people too, using magic stones as an energy source. So, magic is pervasive in this world. If that\u2019s the case, then you don\u2019t have to be a magician to fight, you might say, but when you use a magic stone, you can only use the magic value of the stone.For example, the magic value is fixed at 10. The magic value of magicians is much higher. Therefore, the magic-user is far better in battle than the magic stone, which wears out. Of course, there are exceptions. Such as mobile weapons equipped with a lot of high-ranked magic stones.But in life, even low magic stones can be used to do fun things like this. Other examples include weight-reducing turrets and belts that can levitate. The former can be used for transportation and the latter for construction, which is extremely convenient.So, even if they cannot use magic, people do not feel aversion toward magicians because of their familiarity with magic. There are exceptions, of course, you know? It\u2019s the same as in my previous life. You can\u2019t have a system that everyone agrees on.The point is for the majority of people, magic is a familiar thing, and because magicians defeat demons, magicians are recognized as a normal part of society and as a profession.I love the magic system because it always gives me excitement.I fly through the halls at a leisurely pace. It\u2019s not very exhilarating, but it\u2019s fun. Some of the kids are enjoying the feeling of falling on the slime floor on purpose.\u201cPfft, look at that guy. That\u2019s slower than a baby walking.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your first time, don\u2019t pick a board that slow.\u201d\u201cYou should pick a different board.\u201dOops, I was flying at a slower pace, trying my best not to fall off, and the bad kids saw me and started bullying me. Well, I\u2019m a slow driver. I\u2019m a beautiful girl, so you want to bully me, don\u2019t you?I turned my ice-blue eyes toward them and smiled softly, and they began to blush. I know, I know. I (Miu) am a beautiful girl.I was about to fly off again, satisfied that the bad boys had shut up with that when I heard a shuffling sound, and Tamamo sidled up to me.\u201cHey, Em-chan, let\u2019s race, shall we?\u201dTamamo is a cute foxy girl, but her personality is quite belligerent. She\u2019s probably thinking about me being made fun of and wants to get back at those bad boys. Tamamo is a good friend.Her eyes flash a dangerous light like a predator\u2019s, and I smile at her.\u201cOkay. Shall we race?\u201dI love to race, too. I\u2019m in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re Gonna Race!The five of us moved to the Bubble Tube for the kids\u2019 club to race. Since it is for younger children, it is built around the first floor, but it is elaborate, with wiggly S-shapes, uneven surfaces, etc. For the older children, the tube extends to the third floor, with a complicated track.The tubes extend to the third floor and form complex trajectories for the older kids. A center dedicated to floating races for adults has located a short distance from this park, but somersaults are the norm. The tubes are interrupted, and there is a path to jump, which looks interesting, but they won\u2019t let a 9 year old play on it yet. Too bad, tch.The [Floating Race] is regulated and uses a [Floating Board] with a set magic value allocated to acceleration performance, maximum speed, and turning performance. The allocation is free but based on accumulated experience, and there are several patterns.It is a game that both magicians and ordinary people can play together. Magicians are inevitably stronger because they have physical enhancements and faster reaction times.In the professional game, there are races for magicians, which are very flashy and include interference by magic. There is also a race for ordinary people. The races are spectacular, with entire forests used as racetracks. Professional races can float several tens of meters, so there is no need to build a race track. So they can be held anywhere.There are many race types, such as getting the targets set up in a place or going through a cave. Of course, with that much intensity, there is a risk of injury from broken defensive walls, but that would be the same in my previous life. We race in cars that can flip over if we go too fast. The passion for racing always exceeds the danger.I like to play but not watch, but this sport is quite popular. I think it is because the only equipment used is a [Floating Board], and the rules are simple compared to other sports.It is important to have simple rules and to be able to play with less equipment. That is why soccer and other sports like flying through the air are interesting, but even more popular.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose today\u2026oh!\u201d\u201cKon~!\u201dTamamo raises one hand, and Kon-chan is on her shoulder calls out. Tamamo let out a strong sigh and seemed to be fully motivated. He seems to want to win. Fufun, I won\u2019t lose.\u201cWe won\u2019t lose either!\u201dSei-chan and the others raise their hands in the air, determined not to lose.\u201cHmmm, I won\u2019t lose either!\u201dI (Miu), of course, sniff excitedly and get to the starting line. Young girls are serious even when they are playing.So I get serious, too.[Floating Race, Select device type][Hero][Demon King][Princess][Dragon Knight][Jester]For some reason, there was a status board in front of me that only I could see.[Demon king]I choose [Demon King]. Then, my body is filled with mana, and my center of gravity shifts to the lower half of my body, and I become sturdy, as befits a [Demon King Board]. No, it doesn\u2019t look the same, you know? Maybe it\u2019s gravity or something like that. I, the bishoujo Miu am always pretty. The laws of magical physics must have changed.At first, I thought, this is nonsense. But I soon realized it was a sub-game of a game. The title of that game is Final Dragon World Tree \u2026\u2026, and it\u2019s going to be long enough, so it doesn\u2019t need a title anymore.The fact that it\u2019s an open world and elaborates is no joke. It is also chock full of sub-games. In the original, these games were just treated as small things, background news or something, but in the game, they get set up too.[Hero] has average acceleration, top speed, and turning performance, [Princess] specializes in turning performance, [Demon King] specializes in top speed, [Dragon Knight] specializes in acceleration performance, and [Jester] can use obstruction magic from the beginning. Please don\u2019t be picky anymore. As expected, there are no boxes with jamming items on the route. I can use the jamming magic when I accumulate a gauge during the ride.It\u2019s unfair, but I\u2019m a mob protagonist with game specs. I\u2019m going to give this body the seriousness it deserves.The five of us stand on the starting line, and a holographic signal appears. People who race on the tube show the video on the monitor in the park, so gentlemen and children start watching to be healed. Hey, those gentlemen are children\u2019s attendants, aren\u2019t they?Beep, beep, start!The light turns green, and everyone launches their boards and runs off.\u201cI won\u2019t lose~!\u201dHoku-chan, on her dragon knight board, is the first to go.\u201cI\u2019ll follow!\u201d\u201cUryaaa!\u201dWait, wait, wait!Nan-chan and Sei-chan, who were on dragon knight boards too, accelerated and ran ahead. Our gap was too big, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Tamamo was in fourth place, and I was the last one driving slowly. The [Demon King] board specializes in maximum speed. And it\u2019s peaky, with the worst acceleration and turning performance.This sub-game. I don\u2019t have any tricks to get off to a good start. So I\u2019m late. Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll use it. Because even in the game, it was one out of three times I could start dashing.\u201cI\u2019m going to chase you!\u201dThe only disadvantage is at the beginning. I still have a secret plan.Stop the board while it accelerates. Immediately start it up. Repeat. The board flows by the laws of inertia, and each time it is started up again and again, then my board accelerates. You may not think it makes much of a difference, but that little bit of time pays off later.I call it the RTA stair run. The name comes from the fact that during RTA challenges in zombie games, you can climb stairs faster than you normally would by holding and unfolding your gun. I don\u2019t care what it\u2019s called.Brun, Gatan, Brun, Gatan, and the board make noise and goes up and down violently. But I never fall off the board. Even if he crashes into a wall and falls, this level of genius driving is a lie. It didn\u2019t work in the game.\u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m catching up to you!\u201dOnce I reach top speed, you\u2019re mine. I\u2019m going to overtake them.The gray-haired beauty, aka me, my ice blue eyes shining brightly, my beautiful hair flowing in the air, the soap bubbles from the soap tube dancing in the air as I drove on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re Gonna Race!Spectators watching on the monitors focused their attention on the juvenile section of the race. Both the clerk and the children were paying attention to the spectacle.\u201cOh wow. That girl is fast!\u201dThe girls spray the bubble from the soap tube like a spray wave. The girls were young, yet they moved without falling off their boards or hitting the wall.At the top of the list was a side-tailed girl with a little fox on her shoulder. Her blonde hair shimmers and is dominated by the bubbles, and her face is mischievous and adorable. She had just overtaken her other friends and was now at the top.\u201cShe\u2019s good at going forward, like on the S-curve. She keeps going out and in and taking the shortest route.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good at that age. She hardly slows down, so she can go almost at top speed.\u201d\u201cAt her age, huh?\u201dThe adults watching the race are veteran professional race spectators, and they discuss the race enthusiastically. They were on vacation, so the men had brought their children with them.The kids look at them like they have a chance, begging, \u201cDad, buy us ice cream,\u201d the man gives them allowance so the kids don\u2019t interrupt the spectacle. The kids will surely miss dinner. They called it ice cream and ran to the hamburger shop. There is no doubt that the man will get scolded by his wife.\u201cWhat the. That girl is still slow.\u201d\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t use a demon king board.\u201dThe bad boys who had teased Miu earlier laughed at her at the very back, but that was until they entered the S-shaped route.The gray-haired beauty entered the S-route with her eyes glinting like a hunter and a bird of prey, and almost crashed into the first slalom wall. Since she was at maximum speed, it seemed that she could not fully maneuver, but she snatched the wall with a gasp, jumped, flew into the slalom ahead of it, hit the wall again with another gasp, stepped on it, and moved on.\u201cOh! Awesome!\u201dThe bad boys are amazed and exclaim in admiration at the dangerous driving. Their mouths wide open, fists clenched at the dynamic driving, they take notice.\u201cHmmm, that girl is quite good. She\u2019s aiming for the very edge where she won\u2019t trigger the protective bubble.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t fall off the board with that rough driving.\u201dWe\u2019re going to pass those ahead of us.\u201cDad, I want some juice.\u201dThe self-proclaimed intellectuals, the gentlemen nodded yes, and the kid with his allowance ran to the octopus dumpling shop. The kid won\u2019t eat his dinner today.The gray-haired girl grinned and pressed closer to the girl with the side-tail running at the top. Everyone watched with bated breath.The girl, Miu overtook Sei-chan and the others and moved closer and closer to the leader, Tamamo.\u201cI\u2019m beaten!\u201d\u201cTehehe, sorry.\u201dPassing by Sei-chan and the others, she sticks out her little tongue with a tee-hee and charges down the straight line. My body is specialized for the Demon King, with the Demon King board specializing in maximum speed. I\u2019m getting closer and closer to first place.Bubbles are fluttering in the air, and I\u2019m closing the distance in a fantastic scene. Tamamo glances at me, who is about to catch up with her, and her mouth twitches.\u201cSpecializing in turning performance is no match for specializing in the top speed!\u201d\u201cReally? Because Tamamo won\u2019t lose! Change!\u201dWith a fearless smile, Tamamo uses magic. Poof, she transforms into a fox girl, and her tail wags mischievously. I\u2019m wary that it\u2019s not against the rules since it\u2019s a physical enhancement system.\u201cThis is the power of Tamamo as a fox girl!\u201dThen I enter the next S-shaped route without slowing down. I lean my body and plunge into the wall.\u201cOh, Tamamo, look out!\u201d\u201cHmmm, here\u2019s a new technique!\u201dBut Tamamo proceeds to board up the wall and leans her body so that she almost falls over. As it was, she slid down the wall, climbed to the ceiling, and pushed forward in a spiral, S-shaped route. The bubbles that Tamamo flew filled the bubble tube with zabaa.It would be impossible to slide across the ceiling. It is impossible without an exceptional sense of balance. The transformation into a fox girl must have strengthened Tamamo\u2019s body and enabled her to run that way.\u201cI won!\u201dI also ran on the gas, using the wall as a jumping-off point, but I could hardly close the distance.But I couldn\u2019t lose either. The last L-shaped route was my chance.I kept going and going, and I could close the gap in a straight line, but I couldn\u2019t catch up to her. But as I entered the last L-shaped route, Tamamo slowed down. Tamamo slows down as expected.But I don\u2019t slow down.\u201cWhoa!\u201dAs it is, I hit the L-shaped wall with a board, hit the wall in a zigzag like a pachinko ball, and fly away.Spinning my body around and around, I flew away and said\u201cEih~!\u201dI overtook Tamamo and reached the goal.\u201cFiiinnnnniiiissssshhhh.\u201dI held up a finger as I spun around. That was the forbidden gatan-gatan floating style. You hit the wall, recoil, and push forward. If I regained my position quickly, I wouldn\u2019t have to slow down.I, the gray-haired beauty continued to spin around and around with a beaming smile on my face. As I spun the bubbles clung to my body, giving me a beautiful, fantastic appearance.\u201cThe Demon King is amazing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have that one too!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a fan!\u201dThe kids were so fascinated by my dynamic floating style that they went for the Demon King\u2019s board as fast as they could.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019ve shown me something good.\u201d\u201cMy wife is angry at me.\u201dThe old men, self-proclaimed experts, were also impressed and criticized the current race.The Demon King board. I was fascinated by its potential.Later, they added a rule to make the gatan-gatan floating method forbidden.I don\u2019t get it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Story Suddenly Comes Out Of The BlueWe were taking a break after the race, and for some reason, I was the only one getting scolded by the officials.\u201cWhy was he pissed at me?\u201dI (Miu) tilt my head cockily while sipping water from the water server. I was following the rules, right?\u201cHaha, that\u2019s just like Em-chan. But I was told you\u2019re not allowed to do that next time.\u201d\u201cThat was dangerous to watch~.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, that was a close call.\u201d\u201cDo you want to buy some juice?\u201dTamamo, Hoku-chan, and the others laugh amusedly. The water from the water server tastes so good and chilled, right? That\u2019s the power of magic too? The cooling effect is too strong.After the race, we enjoyed many games, and it was almost evening. The most interesting one was we shot floating holographic balloons.\u201cI think we should go home. Do you want to play tomorrow?\u201dTomorrow is Saturday. It\u2019s a holiday. In this world, Saturdays and Sundays are vacations. Tamamo wants to play tomorrow too. Hmmm, I wonder if Yamiyo will go to the dungeon. After the stone golem incident the other day, we\u2019re banned from going to the dungeons.\u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to the theater with my dad\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to see kabuki.\u201d\u201cPiano recital.\u201dHoku-chan and the others replied with some celebrity-esque errands. Tamamo\u2019s face turns sad with disappointment, but she looks at En-chan, aka me.My errand. In the morning, I practice my forward roll and passive throw. After that, it\u2019s class prep and review. Nap, snack, dinner, and that\u2019s it.\u201cI have no errands! Well then, why don\u2019t you stay over? We have a lot of meat from Hornbear Cow, and I heard it\u2019s sukiyaki today.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll call my mom!\u201dI\u2019ll get a twinkle in my eye. I\u2019m looking forward to the mystery meat sukiyaki. Sukiyaki is one of my top three favorite foods. By the way, in my previous life, I used wagyu ribs for yakiniku as sukiyaki meat. The supermarket near my house always puts up half-price stickers, as if they\u2019re full of stock. It\u2019s delicious to make sukiyaki with thick meat for yakiniku.My mom giggled and allowed me to stay over, telling me not to bother Tamamo\u2019s family and to have fun. I guess the point of the permission was that the sukiyaki appealed to her. She did tell me to come to her house once, though. I had to bring a sleepover set.Also, my mother said she would send me to Tamamo\u2019s house with a souvenir. Staying over at a friend\u2019s house is hard when you\u2019re a kid. In my previous life, I had never stayed over at a friend\u2019s house when I was a child.So, I said goodbye to everyone and went home. Hoku laughed at Tamamo, saying she knew me well, but I wanted to eat mysterious meat. This girl\u2019s body screams. Is it true?After I got home and changed clothes, my mom had to drive me to Tamamo\u2019s house. In the car, I, the gray-haired girl shakes her body excitedly.\u201cMom, I heard she has a lot of horn \u2026\u2026 something!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to behave yourself, okay?\u201d\u201cYes! Meat, veggies, veggies, tofu, meat in that order!\u201dI get invited. I\u2019m not a big fan of discretion. When I reply with a \u201cHumph.\u201d, my mom giggles. She\u2019s still smiling kindly. Our family is still close, you know.\u201cWhat did you bring as a souvenir?\u201d\u201cYokan from the Japanese sweets shop in front of the station.\u201cThat yokan is delicious, isn\u2019t it?\u201dI\u2019m a gray-haired beautiful girl who gets nervous when I think of food souvenirs given to customers. I like yokan. I burst out laughing, and my mother drives her car.And that is when Tamamo\u2019s house came into view. Tamamo\u2019s house is a magician\u2019s house. However, Tamamo\u2019s family are not combat magicians, they are making magical tools. Tamamo\u2019s father is wealthy because of his skill. Therefore, her house is located in a high-class residential area.As I watched a large mansion go by through the window, I was looking ahead and thought it was about time, when I saw a strange sight. Not just weird, but I saw a troubling view.\u201cWho\u2019s at Tamamo\u2019s house, Mom?\u201dI have been to Tamamo\u2019s house a few times to visit. So I know Tamamo\u2019s house well. It\u2019s an elegant mansion. The walls are clean but solid so as not to ruin the view, and there is even a gate. As you would expect, there is no gatekeeper, but they employ servants.It must be the butler. Three people were talking in front of the gate. Gradually, we approached the group, and the brake hit with a squeak, bringing the car to a halt.\u201cMii-chan, don\u2019t go outside. Stay here.\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dMy mom must have sensed something in the air. Her eyebrows furrowed, and her tone was stiff. I open the window so I can hear the conversation.Well, that\u2019s right. What can I say? It\u2019s just so suspicious!Those who talk to the butler are wearing white robes! Moreover, the tip of the head is a sharp type of hood. Those guys don\u2019t often accept job titles.Moreover, a large tree is embroidered on the back. It is elaborate, and you can see the branches and leaves one by one.Even with the window open, I knew who they were.\u201c[Yggdrasil]\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMii-chan, do you know them? It\u2019s true, that\u2019s [Yggdrasil], isn\u2019t it?\u201dMy mom looks at the three with a look of disgust. That is unusual because my mom is usually relaxed and rarely has a look of disgust on her face. That\u2019s how suspicious the three of them are. Isn\u2019t it time to call the policeman?It\u2019s a scene only a novel could have produced. A murderer appears with his face wrapped in bandages, a magician wanders by from the corner of the street dressed as a clown, and men in suspicious-looking robes. They would stand out from the crowd, wouldn\u2019t they? In my previous life, they would have taken the \u201cThis way, officer.\u201d route.But this is a world in a novel. And there are a lot of guys in robes. You know, like the rear guard of an adventurer. They usually walk around with a staff and a robe. It\u2019s frustrating, but the background of the world is like that, so they don\u2019t look suspicious. Really? Why don\u2019t they call the policeman?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Story Suddenly Comes Out Of The Blue[Yggdrasil]. It is the main enemy organization. There are other enemy organizations, but [Yggdrasil] is the one that ultimately remains.They ostensibly provide relief to people, curing those with incurable diseases with the help of their head, a saint. For an outrageous amount of money, of course. A religious organization [Yggdrasil]. That is the name of their organization.Behind the scenes, they are trying to revive the Demon God Ashtaroth to rebuild the world. Their real name is [Nidhogg]. They intend to destroy the world and live in a reconstructed ideal world. Of course, in doing so, they intend to escape the collapse of the world by riding the [Nidhogg]. [Nidhogg] have the power to survive Ragnarok.The main character interferes with [Nidhogg] mission and defeats the resurrected Ashtaroth. That is the main story of The Night of Magic. It\u2019s a solid royal road fantasy.In the game, there is a hidden route. I remember it because it\u2019s almost the same story in the game. [Nidhogg] strongholds would appear randomly, so it was a good way to make money if you attacked them. There was an old novel that said bad guys who ruin the world have no human rights, right? Was it bandits?I remember it because it was a game. Especially [Nidhogg] dropped rare items, so I had to load the game many times to beat them. It was hard to listen to every single event. That game didn\u2019t have a skip function. So I remembered [Nidhogg]. I have a good memory, too.I sneak a peek and see what\u2019s going on. I remembered there was a standard for enemies that was easy to understand. I\u2019d done so many sub-stories and leveled up so much that the enemies in the main storyline were uniformly small fry.I guess you could say it\u2019s a common thing with open-world games. If you take too many detours, you level up too much. I thought it was written in the novel.I, Miu, with my gray hair fluttering and tilting my head cutely, search for memories. I couldn\u2019t quite remember, and my troubled face turned into a cute face, but their conversation was progressing.\u201cThis potion is the best way to cure your magic sickness. I will give you a dozen for free now.\u201d\u201cI will also give you this skin-cleansing soap.\u201d\u201cIf you enter [Yggdrasil], everything is free.\u201dThe content of these words sounded like a scam. It sounded like something no one would fall for. When I hear this kind of casual conversation, I think I am in the world of novels. The dialogue is so simple, like a small-time villain\u2019s.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dI thought it would be a more serious solicitation, but it is a very trivial talk skill. No one would join in that way, I\u2019m sure. What\u2019s that? I (Miu) am going to get annoyed?The last boss of the rival organization must have been the guru behind the religion. That looks like a pyramid scheme or some other fraudulent group. The mastermind suddenly looks so shabby, doesn\u2019t he?Of course, the butler refused with a disgusted look on his face. Ehh? Something is wrong. If it were me, I\u2019d silently stare, slam the door, and be done with it. Or I\u2019d go the policeman route with my phone.But he\u2019s in trouble, and he doesn\u2019t seem to refuse it. You have to say no clearly. I\u2019ll say no.I (Miu), the righteous girl, come in, sniffling and sniffling. I unbuckle my seatbelt and try to get out, but this metal clasp doesn\u2019t come off easily. I tried to clank it with my tiny hands, but it wouldn\u2019t come off.\u201cMamama, can you unbuckle my seatbelt?\u201dMy mom tells me in a whisper, smacking my\u2019s head with a knack that makes me forget my earlier promise.\u201cIt\u2019s watching your feet. There\u2019s a child with magic sickness in Aburage\u2019s house. He\u2019s Tamamo-chan\u2019s younger brother.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a magic sickness?\u201dI\u2019ve never heard of that name before. From the name, it sounds like a magical disease. It wasn\u2019t in the game. Even in the novel, it probably wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve only read up to volume 10.\u201cMagic sickness is a rare disease that affects magicians\u2019 children. It\u2019s like asthma. They rarely die, but the mana in their bodies goes haywire, they become sickly and develop high fevers over and over until they reach adulthood. When they do, their faces will blister like burn scars, leaving pimple-like blotches on their faces.\u201dI\u2019m sorry to hear that. It won\u2019t kill you, but it will make you feel sorry for yourself when you grow up.\u201cDo you think that potion will help?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t seem to be certified as a drug, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re in trouble. And [Yggdrasil] seems to have potions that have some potency.\u201dIn this world, are potions not allowed to be sold unless they are certified as medicines? But if that\u2019s the case, why not just buy it at an apothecary? Why show hesitation for such a dubious medicine?Potions are indeed expensive. Even in the game, they\u2019re priced from 10,000 yen per bottle. Well, I wonder how much they cost in this world.Even as I am thinking of asking next time, the men who talk like con artists recommend the potion as if they can afford it even if the butler is in trouble.\u201cHow is it? My [Yggdrasil] wants to make a connection with your Lord. Besides, he wants to buy some magic tools.\u201d\u201cI am sorry, but I must ask you to leave. Your attitude is not acceptable.\u201dThe butler had lost his patience and decided to refuse the offer. He sighs and glares at the men. But the followers of [Yggdrasil] were laughing at him. They seemed to have assumed that they would get refused. No wonder they were acting according to the manual.\u201cWell, let\u2019s stop joking around here, and as I contacted you last time, would you like to exchange [Yggdrasil] treasured magic tool for an elixir? My master wants an Axe of Whirlwind, a Spear of Thunder, and a Crown of Clay for his collection.\u201d\u201cI have told you many times that I would decline.\u201dThe butler in a suit said no with a crisp refusal, but the men did not give up. The man in the lead grinned and crossed his arms.\u201cThen, how about one of them? Can I have something I don\u2019t need? The Lord has collected relics. Any of them will do. Please ask the Lord. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow.\u201dAfter bowing politely, the men spun around and left. The butler looked at the men with a bitter expression.I get it. That is a magician\u2019s trick to make you choose what you want while pretending to let the other person choose for you. It is a psychological inducement. I don\u2019t remember the name.They want the Crown of Clay. I want one too. It\u2019s easy to understand. It\u2019s a magical tool commonly known as a rusty crown.\u2026\u2026, But that\u2019s weird. I thought that was in the wrong place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rusty Items Are Easy To RecognizeI watch from the car as the men leave. I catch a glimpse of the face of the first man leaving. He had dark, muddy, almost brownish-gold eyes and hair. He also has a large build. He leaves with a smirk and a stupid, arrogant smile. I\u2019ve seen that guy before. I\u2019ve seen him in games and anime. He was much older.That guy with the rusty crown? I see.I make sure he\u2019s gone completely. I\u2019ll leave out the pattern of eyes through the window and remember him. I\u2019m a mob protagonist, and I\u2019ll make an unwanted connection.Then, my mom starts the car, and we arrive at the gate. The butler is about to return to the mansion when he notices the car, smiles, and bows his head.\u201cHello! I\u2019m Takano Miu!\u201dI greet him cheerfully through the window.\u201cThis is Miu-sama. We have been waiting for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come to play with Tamamo-chan!\u201dI stuck my tongue out. I\u2019m Miu, the enchanting beauty.\u201cThank you for your hospitality.\u201dMy mom also bowed her head through the window. The butler doesn\u2019t mention the argument he just had. It\u2019s bad manners to get involved in other people\u2019s business, right? It\u2019s called adult socializing.The butler led my mom to the parking lot and parked her car. Tamamo\u2019s family is rich, and they can park eight cars. Of course, the parking lot is a garage.After getting out of the car, I get escorted into the mansion. It\u2019s a mansion, a mansion. There is a swimming pool to prove it, and I want to swim in it. I want to swim in the pool, but it will be the rainy season soon. Next time its summer, I\u2019ll ask for a swim.\u201cEm-chan, welcome~!\u201dWhen the butler opened the front door, Tamamo jumped out and hugged me. She is a foxy girl who loves skinship.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve been waiting for you~!\u201d\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Tamamo-chan.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you!\u201dWe spin around, holding hands, and yapping. The sight of young girls spinning around as if they were dancing is so cute and smiling that it made both my mom\u2019s and the butler\u2019s eyes relax.Tamamo\u2019s mom came to pick us up, and Tamamo\u2019s younger brother followed behind her. He was so quiet that he glanced at me as he hid behind Tamamo\u2019s mom\u2019s back, and I responded with a frilly wave of my hand.\u201cHello, Mii-neechan!\u201d\u201cHello, Haru-chan!\u201dI stare at Haru, who approaches me with a shy smile. Haru is a 7 year old boy. Even if he looks at it like this, he doesn\u2019t look like an ordinary child. His cheeks are a little red. I see. This is the disease of magic sickness.While patting Haru\u2019s head, I turned my head toward Tamamo\u2019s mom.\u201cThere were some strange people outside!\u201dThe adults are concerned. The children are innocent. Ah, Tamamo\u2019s mom answers awkwardly. I thought she\u2019ll deceive me, but it seems she\u2019ll tell me.\u201cThat\u2019s [Yggdrasil]. I don\u2019t know where you heard about it, but they want our magic tool, and they\u2019re asking us to exchange some magic tools for curing my son\u2019s magical sickness.\u201dI guess they intend to swindle Tamamo\u2019s mom as well. I see. Well, I know because I heard them talking.\u201cMa\u2019am. They suggested the Elixir. You exchange one of our magic tools proposed the other day.\u201dThe butler tells me with a bitter look.The magic tool was an windy axe, a thunder sword, and a rusty crown. One of those, he said, to be exchanged for the Elixir. My (Miu)\u2019s lucid memory even recorded the briefest conversation. Fufufu.\u201cSo \u2026\u2026 we need to give that much \u2026\u2026 An Axe of Whirlwind, a Spear of Thunder, and a Crown of Clay? They gave us a lot of Elixirs before.\u201dIt was different. Well, it was safe to say they were similar, right? I (Miu) am 9 years old.But I get it. That is induction. It\u2019s a clever induction. I\u2019m sure Tamamo\u2019s mom would have given him the rusty crown.\u201cThey want an axe or a spear. If the other party is willing to give up that much, I\u2019ll discuss it with my husband.\u201d\u201cEeeeee! Isn\u2019t that a crown made of clay? That thing is rusty!\u201dWhat do you think? Why an axe or a spear? When I (Miu) open my mouth wide in surprise, Tamamo\u2019s mom replies with a wry smile.\u201cYou know things, Miu. The Crown of Clay has very little magic left in it. You can only use earth magic a few times a day. It is impossible to try to repair it. They may be thinking of trying to restore it, but if they find out that it is impossible, I don\u2019t know what they will say in anger.\u201dShe\u2019s concerned about the rumors. Well, she\u2019ll give the man a useless-looking crown and get an Elixir. Such a thing, she said, would be a temporary gain, but a bad thing in the future. It\u2019s true that \u201cElixirs\u201d cost 100 million yen at the store. Of course, I\u2019m talking about a game. The reality is no different.I guess I was wrong. Maybe the guys in [Yggdrasil] will think so too. They probably pretended to want the washing machine axe and the ramen noodle spear as dummies for the rusty crown. In the original story, [Yggdrasil] wanted the rusty crown.I don\u2019t think they would have thought twice about trying to give them a decent weapon for their later reputation.It\u2019s called being a schemer and a schemer\u2019s trick. Really?Think about it. This world is a world of fictional novels, but for the people living in it, the world is real. I don\u2019t think the way they thought is simple. But that said, what if they are involved in the story? Real people move in a way that involves fictional movements. Because this is not the main story.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Em-chan? Are you hungry?\u201dEven though I was deep in thought with a dignified expression, Tamamo was terrible. I\u2019m not a big eater. I\u2019m a quiet and good child. That is beautiful me, Miu-chan.\u201cI prepared snacks for you in my room.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201dMy face lit up with excitement. I\u2019m still too young to have a body like this, so it is inevitable. I jumped up and down, holding hands with Tamamo, and was about to be led to her room, but.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dI have something to do. I turn my gaze to Haru and stare. I see, his cheeks are getting redder and redder. So this is what you call a magic sickness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I thought it was no big deal, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal.If I use [Examine] to Haru, I\u2019ll know his status. Even if I can\u2019t analyze it, I can tell his status.\u201cUm, no, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dI thought I could buy [Disease Potion I] at the alchemist\u2019s house, but I decided not to. That one costs a million yen, too. I think it\u2019s not a big deal if you\u2019re rich, but there\u2019s something wrong. If they could afford it, they would have bought it.Then there must be a reason why they can\u2019t buy them. They can\u2019t buy the potion without an introduction from a high-ranking noble.If that\u2019s the case, I know what to do. I\u2019ve learned new magic.

What?\u201dHaru was puzzled, but he didn\u2019t know if he get cured. However, when I checked again, the description of the condition abnormality disappeared. Well, if it\u2019s a condition abnormality like this, it\u2019s easy. Hmmm.The magic that I suddenly used on him made everyone look surprised.\u201cOh~. What did you do, Em-chan?\u201dTamamo\u2019s a bundle of curiosity, she looks at me with sparkling eyes, and I smile back at her.\u201cMagic disease? I cured it! I think he\u2019s get cured.\u201dI answer with a smile, but thinking about it, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s cured or not. It\u2019s game-specific recovery magic.\u201cMii-chan, did you heal Haru\u2019s magic sickness?\u201dWith a surprised look, Tamamo\u2019s mom grabs me by the shoulders and shakes me. She shakes me with a jerking motion. So I\u2019m a little uncomfortable.\u201cMaybe? But it\u2019s not a serious illness, and I\u2019m sure a recovery magician could have easily cured it, right?\u201dSomething is wrong, right? What\u2019s wrong with them? Well, why don\u2019t you rely on a recovery magician? A disease like this should be easy.Tamamo\u2019s mom\u2019s face became troubled after noticing my questioning face. There was something wrong.But after she lets out a breath, she calmed down, and her face turned serious.\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you next time, Mii-chan. You\u2019re growing up faster than I expected. But you should go play with Tamamo today.\u201d\u201c? Yes! Tamamo-chan, let\u2019s go~\u201d\u201cMii-chan! Thank you. For curing Haru.\u201dTamamo\u2019s mom wept with emotion and hugged Haru. No, I seem to have done something wrong. That\u2019s bad. It\u2019s simple magic in the game, but it\u2019s strange. But then I have a request.But then I have a favor to ask. If my guess is correct it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201cWell then, show me the electric fan, rairaiken, and the rusty crown later! I\u2019d like to see the magic tools.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Of course, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll give those magic tools to you if you like. The Axe of Whirlwind, the Spear of Thunder, and the Crown of Clay?\u201dI think I made a mistake, but I\u2019m nine years old, so cut me some slack.\u201cNah. I\u2019ll just look at it!\u201dAnd I don\u2019t need the items. I don\u2019t want to carry a joker.\u201cTamamo-chan, show me the way.\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go! I\u2019ll show you around! I have freshly made chocolate cookies.\u201dTamamo and I hold hands and head to the room. Is it a chocolate cookie? It\u2019s a freshly made cookie so it\u2019s rarer than the rusty crown.\u201cOh, Tamamo-chan. I have a little favor to ask you later.\u201d\u201cA favor?\u201d\u201cYeah. Please leave me alone for a little while. I\u2019m going to practice my rolling technique. I have to practice once a day.\u201dThe content is crude, but Tamamo\u2019s eyes light up with excitement. She leads me to her room, asking me to show her the secrets of my rolling technique later.If [Yggdrasil] is going to come out. I\u2019ll have to train a little more seriously, but let\u2019s get this sub-event out of the way first.This story isn\u2019t in the main storyline, but I\u2019m better at sub-stories. I don\u2019t get treated like the air here.After all, I\u2019m a mob protagonist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Room DefinitionTamamo\u2019s room was spacious. It is indeed a mansion. It was several times larger than my room. It had a long, shaggy carpet, a king-size bed, a study desk and chair in the corner, and a table and cushions in the center. The next room is a closet. There is also a bookshelf. And the decor is fancy, with lots of stuffed animals here and there. It is very Tamamo-like.I, as an adult, looked at the room with warm eyes, thinking it was childish. There was a time when I was innocent, too.\u201cEn-chan, you like the stuffed toy~?\u201d\u201cThis lion is cute!\u201dMy body will hug the stuffed animal on its own. Mugyu. After all, this stuffed animal is fluffy and big. It\u2019s two meters. If I see a stuffed toy like this, I need to hug it, right?I, the beautiful girl with gray hair, enter the stuffed lion\u2019s bosom and hug it. I turn my back around the lion\u2019s hand, slam my face down, close my eyes, and hug it tightly. This plush toy is great. But it\u2019s too big for my room.Tamamo, Tamamomoto, and Tamamo joined happily next to each other, and the two of them enjoyed the stuffed animals for a while. Eat fresh chocolate cookies and sip milk in the warm air. Of course, I saved about two cookies so I could eat dinner.After talking about TV and friends for a while, I remembered what I should do. Let\u2019s put the troublesome things first.\u201cTamamo-chan, I\u2019m thinking of practicing the secret technique of rolling over. Can you leave me alone for about 10 minutes?\u201dI ask, clasping my hands together with a, please. It\u2019s the mysterious Ichigo method. If they see me, I have to punish them.\u201cOh\u2026. mysterious Ichigo method! Yeah, I understand! Then Tamamo will get out of the room and wait!\u201dWith her eyes shining and her nose blowing, Tamamo walked out of the room. Thank you, Tamamo. But even if you open the door narrowly and try to take a peek, you\u2019ll find out.\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s do the sub-event.\u201dFrom my memory, I rummage through the events connected to the rusted forehead. There should have been this item in the slums. I don\u2019t know how it ended up in the slums, but I can roughly imagine it. Preventing that would be the role of my mob protagonist.I would have collected it in the slum, but the guy I was protecting was a bandit master, and he didn\u2019t have a name, so it wouldn\u2019t matter if I cut the whole thing.I quickly close my eyes and mutter a few words.[My Room].Following those words, the space gently ripples. Then, when I opened my eyes, I was in another room. Tamamo\u2019s fancy room was nowhere to be found, and I was in a two-story house with an atrium.It is small in size, with a kitchen, living room, living room, and bedroom all in one room. The second floor has an atrium, so it feels like there is a loft on the wall. The ceiling is high, unlike Japanese houses. I could see the outside from the window, but I could see a small garden and a kitchen garden outside. Outside, there is another barn that looks like a warehouse, the door is open, and I can see a row of machine tools.It\u2019s [My Room]. A room in another dimension where you can change jobs and create items. The conditions for coming here are limited to hotels and homes. In the game, it\u2019s convenient [My Room]. It\u2019s the pattern.By the way, I found out that when I was moving to [My Room], I disappeared, because I made my parents worry. After all, they thought I got kidnapped when I was sleeping on the bed in [My Room]. I have to be careful when using it.\u201cNow, I\u2019ve got to hurry.\u201dI open the status board and transition to the flippant screen. And I move to the Job Change section.\u201cThis time. It\u2019s a production job.\u201dA production job. As the name suggests, it\u2019s a job that allows you to craft items.[Mechanic] Unique skill: Can make weapons[Alchemist] Unique skill: Can make items[Cook] Unique skill: Can make food[Appraiser] Unique Skill: Can use appraisalThese four are production jobs. All of them are recipe-released. Only the appraiser job is a little special, as it increases the number of items acquired and the rate of acquiring rare items when mining and collecting.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s see what the [Mechanic], has to offer.\u201dWith a quick push, a silver hula hoop appears. A silver hula-hoop descended from my head to my feet as if scanning me, and when I heard a swooshing sound, I was job-changed from Priest I to Mechanic. My stats recalculated, and my body feel heavy due to the stats decrease. As usual, it feels strange.\u201cI guess the job change doesn\u2019t change the color of my hair.\u201dI poke at the ends of my hair, but the color of my gray hair has not changed. My hair color seems to be fixed. I don\u2019t remember having gray hair in my character\u2019s make-up, but I don\u2019t want it to change color all the time.I move my hands willy-nilly. I don\u2019t know the difference, but the job change is complete.The [Mechanic] is a job for producing items. It covers everything from weapons to magic armor and accessories. Its proficiency level is still 1. Recipes for equipment below level 10 have been released, and the equipment I want this time is in those recipes, so there is no problem.Well, since it\u2019s an event item, I could make it with a proficiency level of 1.When I choose the equipment I want to craft from the list. This is for this time.[Magic stone 15, Ore 2, Gem 1]The materials needed for fabrication are displayed. Gems, gems?\u201cIt\u2019s a waste to use the Earth Topaz, but \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dIn the game, it could be any object. Magic stones were the lowest rank, ores, and gems could have been scrap items. It was a bailout. But I\u2019m in trouble because I don\u2019t have any scrap items. I can\u2019t help but be in trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Room Definition\u201cGood tickets for men! Good tickets for women too!\u201dI don\u2019t need guts or charm. Just click.I press the [Create] button and plop down. I put my little hands in front of me and start crafting.A sphere of light appears before my eyes, illuminating my\u2019s face. My double teeth protrude from my mouth as I continue my crafting.The sphere of light writhed like slime, and after about 30 seconds, the sphere exploded and flew in the air like glittering gold dust.Then the item box gets filled with the item I had finished crafting.The item I made was this.[Rusty Crown (False): You can use [Barrier Protection I] three times a day. When mana gets poured into it, it reacts and glows].As planned. Event Item [Rusted Crown (False)].\u201cIt went well. I should act as planned.\u201dI exit from [My Room]. I closed my eyes again, and the space rippled me back to Tamamo\u2019s room.\u201cAh, Em-chan disappeared?\u201dI open the door with a click, and Tamamo jumps in. It seems she was peeking in after all. Waving her golden side-tail, she asks me with eyes full of curiosity. I can\u2019t use it in the presence of others. It was an emergency this time, so I had no choice.The fox cub on her shoulder also tilts her head, looking curious. But I had already predicted this turn of events. The genius girl Miu always acts perfectly, you know.I reply with my still developing chest out, ahem.\u201cIt\u2019s the inner workings of my rolling technique.\u201dIt was a perfect theory. I said from the beginning that I\u2019d use secrets.\u201cTamamo, Tamamo wants to use the rolling technique too! Hey, teach me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a technique passed down from one child to another. That\u2019s why this technique is a secret.\u201d\u201cTeach me!\u201dUsing a deception unique to a 9 year old, Tamamo forced me for a while, and Kon-chan licked my face.Then, after playing for a while, Tamamo\u2019s mom called us to dinner, so we headed to the living room. I, the good little Miu needed to put on a cute act. When Tamamo and I arrived at the living room, hand in hand, we found a sukiyaki pot simmering on the stove.It seemed to be the Kanto style of eating while simmering. Surprisingly, my mom was also there. They were talking to each other. Haru was there, as was Tamamo\u2019s dad. He had returned.Tamamo\u2019s dad, who makes magic tools, is a white-collar craftsman who can go home anytime he wants because he makes magical tools in his workshop away from home. I envy him. His apprentices are there, too, but they are eating at other dining halls.I wonder how they practice making magic tools and such. I\u2019ve never learned anything other than life magic.\u201cI won\u2019t know until I go to the hospital for a checkup next time, but Haru says his body is feeling better after receiving Miu-chan\u2019s recovery magic. Thank you.\u201d\u201cThank you so much, Miu-chan.\u201dTamamo\u2019s parents smiled. My mom is also smiling, but there is a bit of a shadow on her face. The magic I used was not good.If you think about it, it\u2019s a disease that requires Elixirs. But since it\u2019s listed as Disease I, it should be easy to cure it.Come to think of it, in the novel. There was a sticky-tempered event where the heroine competed to nurse him.But isn\u2019t this a little weird? Some of the heroines were recovery magicians. It\u2019s not surprising that they could heal with recovery magic. If you say it\u2019s a novel, you\u2019re right. Could it be that magic that heals abnormal conditions is rare?Did I do something wrong? No, this is no time to joke around. But let\u2019s set this aside for a moment.With big smiles on their faces, Tamamo\u2019s parents thank me.\u201cTell me anything. I\u2019ll do anything to thank you.\u201d\u201cSure. Anything you say.\u201d\u201cWell, then show me your magic tools! And I want the Elixirs!\u201dElixir. I\u2019m interested, but some events require more.\u201cI thought, you can get it in exchange for the magic tools, right? Would you like to exchange it for a Rusty Crown?\u201dI fidget and intertwine my fingers to make the request.\u201cHmm, Elixir, huh\u2026 I don\u2019t want to show [Yggdrasil] an opening, but\u2026 I don\u2019t need it anymore, and I\u2019ve always thought it was suspicious. Let\u2019s collect it as evidence.\u201dWith a hand on his chin, Tamamo\u2019s dad hesitates, but nods. Well, he\u2019s been refusing until now. No wonder. If I replace it here, no point in me fixing it. But he\u2019s thought of another use for it.Good, it makes sense. I have to let go of the Rusty Crown.In the game, in the future, it belonged to a bandit in a slum. It\u2019s a bad sign, isn\u2019t it?So the Joker has to let go.In the past, let\u2019s say that future events get altered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

MutualismI\u2019m eating Hornbeak Cow Sukiyaki. What is this meat? It\u2019s marbled meat, that\u2019s for sure. But it also feels like it melts, but leaves a solid lean taste in my mouth. I don\u2019t want to think about what kind of monster it is.I have never eaten meat like this. The marbling and the lean are in perfect balance. In my previous life, I preferred beef that cost about 600 yen, rather than beef that cost 1,500 yen for 100 grams. I was not a rich man, though, as I ate 600 yen meat only on rare occasions, right?\u201cCome on in, Mii-neechan.\u201dHaru\u2019s meek face turns into a smile as he tries to put a large portion of meat on my small plate, but he\u2019s so young I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to drop it. It\u2019s high-quality meat, and it would be a waste if I dropped it.I have no choice but to ask him to put it on a small plate. It would be a waste if he dropped it. The rotation of meat, vegetables, vegetables, tofu, and meat changes, but this is inevitable.\u201cEm-chan, eat this too, eat it~.\u201dTamamo also puts meat on my small plate. If they put it on my small plate, I have no choice but to eat it. It is a natural part of good manners. No leftovers are allowed. I\u2019m a good boy.I eat hot meat. I want to eat it all, but Miu\u2019s mouth is so small that I get cursed with having to eat it in small pieces. I forgot to include white rice in the rotation! That\u2019s a big deal. Please refill.\u201cThere\u2019s melon for dessert, too.\u201dI knew I didn\u2019t need a refill. Dessert for girls is another meal. I know it\u2019s not true. I was astonished when I became a woman. I could eat as much as I wanted. I\u2019ll have to present it at the conference. Or maybe this is a women-only secret.And so I (Miu) finished my dinner with plenty of mystery meat and melon for dessert in her stomach. I\u2019m very satisfied.After having a full belly, the butler guides me to the magic tools warehouse. On the way there, my father also paid a visit, saying hello, and good evening, and carrying a bottle of liquor as a gift. Whiskey? It looks like they are going to discuss something. It\u2019s not my fault. Maybe he wants to make friends.I reach the vault with Tamamo. It\u2019s a vault with a thick magical metal door and walls that seem to be enchanted. The door looks quite tight. It is not easy to open. You are not a former master of opening safes, are you, Butler-san?Tamamo\u2019s family must trust the butler. After he does the fingerprint, biometric, and magic authentication are complete, and when he swipes the card, the door starts to open.\u201cThat\u2019s great, Tamamo!\u201d\u201cEven Tamamo has rarely seen this door open before!\u201dJust seeing the thick round metal door open is exciting. It\u2019s a sight ordinary people have only seen in movies.And then I was surprised to see what was inside.Swords and staves lined up in glass cases. There is a metal cupboard like a safe-deposit box containing magical tools.In this world, some powerful weapons and accessories get made long ago and whose manufacturing methods have been lost. Yes, it\u2019s a template, I understand.I hold hands with Tamamo and look around with eyes sparkling with curiosity. I wondered if Tamamo had never been there before, her face shining with a twinkle.Tamamo\u2019s family is just magicians. Why don\u2019t they become nobles? They have money and magic power, but I wonder. Is there a reason? No, I just haven\u2019t heard it. Maybe the noble? Should I not worry about it? Let\u2019s go through it.\u201cMiu-sama. It\u2019s dangerous, so please don\u2019t pour mana into the magic tools. Other than that, I have permission from the Master for you to touch it.\u201d\u201cYes! I understand!\u201dI raise my hand and answer cheerfully. It seems to me, what I have to do is not choose [Use] for [Item]. Pour mana into it? In my brain, I [Use] [Item]. I can\u2019t pour mana into it.\u201cEm-chan, this jewelry is beautiful.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s true. But let\u2019s wear gloves.\u201dTamamo opens the shelf and casually grabs the jewel to show it.Finger grease is the natural enemy of gemstones\u2019 brilliance. Gloves. Let\u2019s put on gloves, shall we?While watching Tamamo return the jewel to the shelf, I carefully observed the surroundings and narrowed my eyes.\u201cThere it is. That one.\u201dThere is a familiar magic tool from the game. A rusty crown stood on the shelf. Compared to other gems and magic tools, it\u2019s a few steps down, and the value seems low.It\u2019s a dirty, rusty crown. A small jewel shines in the middle of the crown.\u201cMay I see that one?\u201dI ask the butler, and he nods his permission.\u201cThe Master has permitted me to show you any magic tools. It is quite old, and it is called Crown of Clay. There is very little mana left in it. I will prepare something else for you.\u201d\u201cHmm, it sure looks a little dirty. I want to exchange it for this!\u201dWith a rusty forehead in hand, I smiled. While I\u2019m at it, I\u2019ll also exchange the rusty crown (fake) in the Item Box.For a moment, the rusty crown wavered, but the butler didn\u2019t notice. That\u2019s right. He wouldn\u2019t expect someone to slip it in front of him.After that, the butler showed me a lot of magic tools, mainly jewels, but since I achieved my goal, I started rowing the boat. I think I ate a little too much.After I take a bath with Tamamo, I fell asleep and slept in the same bed. Good night. I\u2019m tired from playing a lot today. I entered the bath after washing my back. A gentleman might shed tears of blood.The next day. I woke up a little late. It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock. Before I knew it, I\u2019m sleeping on a king-sized bed with Tamamo, Haru, and Kawa.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mutualism\u201cGood morning, Tamamo-chan, Haru-chan.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Em-chan.\u201d\u201cOh, good morning.\u201dWe yawn and get up dazedly, rubbing our eyes. The maid carries us to the washbasin in her arms. I (Miu) am short and cute, so I easily get carried like a stuffed animal.The water is lukewarm, which makes it easy to wash our faces, we finish brushing our teeth and adjusting our hair. The most adorable and beautiful girls were made through hard work. Do I have a sleeping habit? Have I combed my hair? No eye makeup or anything like that? Choose clothes that are clean and wrinkle-free. Of course, I\u2019ll take care of my clothes, too.\u201cEm-chan, you look beautiful.\u201d\u201cI take care of my appearance. You\u2019re so pretty, too, Tamamo-chan!\u201dI check for any split ends and spin around in front of the mirror with a smile and a twirl. The path of a beautiful girl doesn\u2019t take a day, you know. Make sure the ends of your hair aren\u2019t bouncing around too.Teko and I head into the living room with Tamamo and Haru. Good morning, I realize as I\u2019m about to greet them.\u201cPapa, Mama!\u201dAlong with Mr. and Mrs. Aburage, my parents were sitting on chairs and chatting. I think we spent the night together.I ran and jumped into my dad with a smile on my face. Expressions of affection are necessary for a family. Skinship is important.\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet, Mii-chan.\u201dMy dad stroked my head happily. I pout and move my nose twitching in an attempt to answer.\u201cYou surprised me! You smell like alcohol!\u201dAfter taking a bath, I felt the smell of sake that could not be wiped off even when I brushed my teeth and left. That\u2019s the end of our skinship. It\u2019s NG for a young girl to smell like alcohol.\u201cOh my goodness, honey. I told you, you\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d\u201cOh, my.\u201dMy dad, who scratches his head and looks shocked and dejected, and Tamamo\u2019s father, who also smells of alcohol, also stink of alcohol and leave, so it seems that they drank quite a bit. Champon makes me sick. The hangover is decided.But the heartwarming atmosphere ended there. The butler came in with a stern look on his face.\u201cSir. The people of [Yggdrasil] are here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I understand. But I cannot go. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll have to exchange the Elixirs for the Crown of Clay.\u201dTamamo\u2019s dad glanced at my parents and nodded slightly. He seems to have decided something. I can imagine.The butler, with awe, took the box under his arm and went outside. I want to sneak a peek, but I\u2019ll hold back. I don\u2019t want anyone to know I was here. Putting aside the possibility of being found out later, I reconsidered that it would be bad if they found out what I did.Because I have a suspicion recovery magicians might be rare.Maybe my dad came to talk to Tamamo\u2019s dad because I had cured Haru of his disease. I\u2019m not so optimistic that they don\u2019t notice, right? There are many strange things about Tamamo\u2019s mom\u2019s attitude and the Elixir.I can\u2019t help but click my tongue. I thought it was natural to have an alchemist\u2019s mansion. I thought the adventurer\u2019s guild had many recovery magicians. Since sports using magic tools are commonplace, I thought it was the same as the game\u2019s setting.However, the world uses the novel\u2019s setting. In other words, what if the main character gets sick and gets nursed by the heroines happens in the world? Oops, there are so few recovery magicians that they can\u2019t cure illnesses, or there are few recovery magicians who can cure status ailments.And this is the biggest problem. Maybe there aren\u2019t any [Alchemists]?\u3000I\u2019m sure there are people with similar jobs, but there aren\u2019t any [Alchemists]? Only I had the game\u2019s setting, level system, and job system.And then. There is no [Alchemist]. And there are no craftsmen who can make potions daily. Or the effect is so insignificant that few people can make a decent elixir. I came across that possibility. I was careless.The butler came back with the boxed items. Surprisingly quickly.\u201cIs that the elixir that cures everything?\u201d\u201cYes. Yes, it\u2019s this way. The master has asked me to give it to you. Here you go.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dThe butler hands me a golden liquid in a crystal glass bottle. The butler then reported to Tamamo\u2019s dad that [Yggdrasil] and their relationship was over, then the butler returned home without a hitch.Right. They wanted the rusty crown, so it\u2019s natural. They\u2019ll never cling to the Aburages again. If the butler hadn\u2019t handed it over, they might kill the Aburages under the guise of a robbery.It\u2019s worth that much.Well, they\u2019ll never know it\u2019s a fake.Now, this one.[Appraisal]I keep my eye out, use my skills, and stare at the Elixir. I wanted to use [Appraisal]\u2019s a unique skill, so I changed jobs beforehand.[Magic Mitigation Potion: Temporarily mitigates the runaway magic of those who drink it. Effective for 240 hours]Damn it. I knew it wasn\u2019t the real Elixir after all.Well, the one I gave him was a fake, too. They can pour mana into it every day to awaken it. It\u2019s just a shiny toy, though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s Change The Future Of TragedyLet\u2019s spoil the story of this series of events. Well, it was a simple event.The Crown of Clay awakens when you put in an incredible amount of mana and turn it into a divine weapon [Aegis Crown]. It is one of the Sacred Artifacts that sealed the Demon God Ashtaroth.In other words, it is one of the important items in the novel. It was good that I could get one of them as soon as possible.These Sacred Artifacts. In both the anime and the video game, the master of a gang of thieves in a slum had it. I don\u2019t know about the novel, but it\u2019s probably the same. It was an event around the middle of the book, so it must have been before volume 10.I don\u2019t know about the novel version, but in both the game and the anime, the [Nidhogg] executives show up to take The Crown of Clay. The thieves are all killed, and the enemies who have returned to the true form of the crown of clods [Aegis Crown] use the power of the sacred treasure to fight the protagonist.Eh, the name of the enemy executive?I don\u2019t remember anything like that.The hero manages to defeat him, but in the end, the [Aegis Crown] gets stolen by the mastermind that suddenly appeared, and escapes. The protagonist, exhausted from the battle with the executives, misses out on it.The same thing happens in the game. Even if the player defeats the mastermind in two turns, the hero is exhausted, the crown gets stolen, and the mastermind escapes. Hey, what did you guys do? My played character\u2019s stamina and MP are still full. Even if I wanted to chase after him, the hero and his gang would ignore me.Why do the thieves have the Crown of Clay? In the anime and the game, it existed as one of the stolen items. There was no background.So, I was thinking. Why did the bandits have it? Maybe today was the turning point? The Aburages did not give the Crown of Clay to [Yggdrasil]. Therefore, they were all killed by [Yggdrasil] who tried to take it from them. But they were unable to recover the crown. It\u2019s a classic template.That is the future. One of the alternate future. Maybe the Aburages were all killed. I\u2019m not sure why the magic tools went to the bandits, but it\u2019s called novel opportunism.I acted to prevent the robbery that would have killed the Aburages. I only gave the [Yggdrasil] a fake crown. That\u2019s all.But not just any fake. It was a fake using the power of the game. The crown\u2019s special ability before awakening is the same, as is the fact that it glows like a shiny toy transformation belt as if it is about to awaken at any moment. I want the enemy executives to dream they will transform themselves into tokusatsu heroes.It is impossible to spot the difference. Even in the game, the enemy didn\u2019t see through it and brought it back. And it didn\u2019t get noticed until I cleared the hidden route.The game version has a secret route. In the game, the player collects Sacred Artifacts sealed by a demon that the enemy is supposed to obtain. If we collect all, we can completely revive the Demon God Ashtaroth. It is impossible to do so by ordinary means.The way to get the crown is simple. Before [Nidhogg] attacked the bandits, we secretly exchanged the crown for a fake one. I used the fake item I made during the exchange.Someone can praise me for that. It\u2019s a genius idea.There are five more Sacred Artifacts left. I have all artifacts\u2019 fake recipes, so let\u2019s trade them when I get stronger. It would be a problem if the location is different from the game like this time, but there are 6 years left until the original work starts. Let\u2019s be optimistic that things will work out.The reward this time was good. The performance of the [Aegis Crown] is good. It takes quite a lot of MP to awaken it, but once my level goes up, it should be no problem.I\u2019ll leave the [Magic Mitigation Potion:] in the item box. I have never seen this item in the game. I hope I can use it for something, but I will leave it as it is. Well, it is common in games we get garbage items as event rewards.So, my sleepover at Tamamo\u2019s house ended with a good result.So, I am now in the living room of my house, facing my parents with a difficult face.I can tell by the air that they are not angry with me. It\u2019s pretty heavy. When they tell me they\u2019re getting a divorce, I, as a child, plan to be a cuss guy, but they don\u2019t seem to have it in the works.\u201cMii-chan. I want to talk to you. It\u2019s an important one.\u201d\u201cAn important talk?\u201dI asked, trying to look innocent as my dad opened his mouth with a serious expression.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Mii-chan, there are very few recovery magicians.\u201dWow, there are hardly any recovery wizards? Just as I expected. How many thousands? About 5,000? Even in the net game, they\u2019re not many white mages who could become one. I can understand that. It\u2019s not so popular.\u201cThere are only 31 people in Japan, including Mii-chan.\u201d\u201cWow, there are only 31 people in Japan. \u2026\u2026\u2026 is 31?\u201dI didn\u2019t understand.The digits were different. 3-1? Seriously.Seeing me, the gray-haired, childish girl so stunned that I opened my mouth to gape, Yoshiyuki, my father, frowns and nods back at me. He has mixed feelings of pride and thought his dear daughter would suffer.My dad\u2019s wife Mirei feels the same way. Moreover, I (Miu) cure someone\u2019s magic disease. Gently and tenderly stroking my\u2019s gray hair, my mom also opens her mouth.\u201cMii-chan, you cured the magic disease, right? There are only ten people who can cure it.\u201d\u201cHuh? But it was easy to fix, mama?\u201dIt was Disease I. It was the lowest-ranked abnormal condition. It was a disease that even a novice priest could cure. As for me, I was in turmoil. Why?Confused, my mom smiled wryly at the size of my talent when I asked her what was wrong. I could see the look on my mom\u2019s. She wasn\u2019t lying and that it had been easy for me.\u201cIt\u2019s harder to heal a disease than to heal an injury. Injuries are said to be good to heal if you grant a power similar to self-healing, but for illnesses, there is a possibility of virus activation, and recovery magic is said to be ineffective. Therefore, only 10 people in Japan can cure a disease. !! if we count Miu-chan.\u201dMy (Miu)\u2019s head was starting to spin. Seriously? That\u2019s too few. Oh, right, that\u2019s right. I bite my lip as I realize something. I had been careless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s Change The Future Of TragedyBack to the time I saved Yamiyo. I didn\u2019t think it was strange at the time, but it was crazy.Why was there a VIP room in the hospital? That was proof that there were not many recovery magicians in the hospital. If it\u2019s an ordinary hospital room, it\u2019s not strange. I would assume that there were not enough magicians around.But if you have money and power, you can get magicians to fix you up in no time, so why build a VIP room? Politicians won\u2019t get hospitalized for a temporary illness. They\u2019ll ask you to use your recovery magic.There was only one answer. In other words, even if they have money and power, there is a high possibility that they won\u2019t be able to receive recovery magic, so the VIP room exists. I thought about it in terms of my previous life, so I didn\u2019t question it, damn it.My common sense from my previous life got in the way of my thinking. Or maybe my knowledge of the game got in the way too.That is probably because the author wrote a scene for the heroine to nurse her who caught a cold, so it turned out like this for consistency.It\u2019s possible. That novel didn\u2019t miss those classic template scenes.After all, let\u2019s assume that anyone can recover with recovery magic.That\u2019s if he can\u2019t recover. The hero who helped himself and defeated an enemy was injured. The heroine says things like, \u201cYou\u2019re stupid\u2026\u201d and puts him on her knees, strokes his head, and takes care of the hospitalized hero. Suppose there is a pattern like a cold.If there is a template \u201cwuff wuff\u201d event, but there are recovery wizards all over the place, the event will end there with, \u201cHey, [Heal], look, you\u2019re healed, you\u2019re just in time for class,\u201d and so on. It could become a boring pattern.It\u2019s not very exciting. In between the battles, there is a romantic comedy with the heroine. There is no way that the author, who always thinks about popularity, would miss this.The result is this. You see, there is a difference in the ease of story development between having a recovery magician and not when the time comes. If the hero can recover from fatal injuries. The author can create a pinch without hesitation.So, even if they cannot usually recover, or when they are really in trouble, they can ask a recovery magician to heal them.The hero or heroine could be seriously injured and go to rare recovery magicians to ask for help.Dangerous. The more I think about it, the more it seems that this assumption is correct. For the sake of a romantic comedy, I\u2019m the mob hero who\u2019s in danger. Screw you, The Night of Magic author.In the game, it would be difficult as an RPG without a healing magician, so they were usually there. It means that recovery magicians were locally gathered only around the player.\u201cBut you have potions, Papa.\u201dI stand up with a clatter and ask with a gleam in my eye. See, you said it\u2019s licensed or something. I\u2019d never been sick before, so I didn\u2019t care. Why beautiful 9 year old girl goes to an apothecary with nothing to do? Would I go to the pharmacy to ask if they have cold medicine? Usually, parents go there, right?So I didn\u2019t know much about this world. The game specifications and the setting of The Night of Magic were told up to Volume 10, so I thought I knew about it.s. I thought I knew, so I didn\u2019t bother to look it up. That\u2019s a grievous mistake, man.\u201cUsually, potions only increase the effectiveness of medicines according to the disease. The same goes for poisons. Injuries only increase the self-healing power.\u201dYes, I got a hopeless reply. Seriously? Dad, I didn\u2019t want to hear such a realistic setup.\u201cPotions that truly heal injuries use valuable monster materials, and at that time, the help of a recovery magician is also necessary. That\u2019s right, maybe 2 or 3 potions will circulate a month? The nobles will buy them up.\u201dWith a sigh, the father tells me. Well, that\u2019s aristocrat-like behavior.\u201cUnlicensed potions are distributed as juice. Like [Yggdrasil] the other day, they are exchanged for something and sold as gifts to believers. They\u2019re given in the form of donations.\u201dI agree with my mom\u2019s words. And I understand that there are no [Alchemists] in this world. If there are, they must be few.In that case, a recovery magician is terrifyingly valuable. Then I understood that I was in a rather dangerous position. I wish you had told me a little earlier.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mii-chan. Don\u2019t worry, Papa and mama will protect Mii-chan.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me. Mama and papa are strong.\u201dMy parents try to reassure me with their compassionate smiles. I felt love in those words and understood the danger they were in.I would be relatively safe. Bad people won\u2019t take my life, or worse, kidnap me. At worst, I would be kidnapped, although there would be a plot to take me in.My parents could be killed. I could be left alone, and some good guy will try to take me in. Or I could become a hostage.\u201cThere will be guards from the Teijo family too. You can rest assured, Mii-chan.\u201dI don\u2019t feel safe at all. Do my dad and mom have guards?I (Miu) gulp, turn serious, staring at my parents with a strong will, and then opens my mouth.\u201cDad, mom, I\u2019m going to take a strong nap!\u201d\u201cNap?\u201d\u201cI made a mistake. I\u2019m going to be strong!\u201dIt would be time to make an active move. I, Miu made a strong declaration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Daughter\u2019s Talent-Dad\u2019s POV-The sun begins to set. It\u2019s almost evening. The sun\u2019s rays are turning orange and staining the living room. I get up and turns on the light before it gets dark.With a snap, I presses a button, and the living room lights up. It was before evening, so it might be a little wasteful.He takes a bottle of mineral water from the refrigerator, pours it into a glass, moves to the living room, and sits deeply on the sofa.\u201cHuh, I didn\u2019t expect our daughter to have that much magic power.\u201dWith a troubled look, I tilt the cup and drinks the cold water. The cool water felt good on my body, which was probably on fire from the excitement. I must have been nervous without realizing it.Suddenly, I remembered the time when I started drinking mineral water. Thinking back, it was three years ago when Miu was drinking mineral water with a smile, saying it was delicious.Until then, she had been drinking coffee and tea but caught by her smile that seemed to blossom with deliciousness from the bottom of her heart, she and her wife started drinking mineral water.Miu was so cute when she said with a smile, \u201cMineral water is expensive and delicious.\u201d, we laughed at her words, but seeing her drink it with an adorable smile, we started drinking mineral water ourselves.My mouth breaks into a smile as I remember my beloved daughter, even in the smallest habits.Miu awakened to the holy attribute and became a healing magician. She\u2019s certainly rare, but she doesn\u2019t have that much magical power. I thought she could heal minor wounds.Because I heard Miu ran out of mana after using her recovery magic 3 times. She\u2019s pretty good at healing magic. I was relieved to know she was probably one of the best.Miu\u2019s strong power can change someone\u2019s life, happily or unfortunately. She\u2019s my daughter who can use some recovery magic. That\u2019s how good she was. I don\u2019t want her daughter to be unhappy. With this level of magical power, even the Takano family won\u2019t overdo it. As the second son of a former count, Yoshitsugu knew just how muddy the noble world was.I wanted to prevent Miu, who had a pure heart and a strong sense of justice, from being thrown into the nobility and having a hard time. My wife and I didn\u2019t want her to cry with sadness.However, that expectation has changed drastically. Miu\u2019s beginning to develop this talent. I didn\u2019t expect the magnitude of mana in the stone golem incident, nor did I expect her to become a recovery magician capable of curing magic disease.That girl\u2019s expression showed she believed anyone could use such simple magic.In this one case, on the surface, we could have Aburage Haru pretending he gets cured by Elixir. However, we won\u2019t be able to hide it forever. Even if the family keeps quiet, there are servants. And his bodyguards. The hospital where Haru\u2019s going for an examination will also find out.From somewhere, Miu\u2019s story will spread. There\u2019s no way to prevent it. We already know the Elixir is just a [Magic Mitigation Potion]. Miu gave me half of it, and the Ministry of Magic has investigated it.We thought it was a revolutionary potion that could cure magic sickness, its material was so precious that only a few recovery magicians were known to be able to make it. It was a known potion that had existed in the past.Perhaps [Yggdrasil] thinks the Aburages will contact them for more [Fake Elixirs]. That would be vicious. It\u2019s [Yggdrasil]\u2019s way of ripping them off so that not even their bone remains. Since it\u2019s unauthorized, we can\u2019t accuse of it being fake.However, the Ministry of Magic must recognize this vicious business practice, and will soon be conducting an audit. Even if the corporation of [Yggdrasil] can\u2019t be nullified, it should be possible to keep it quiet for a while.However, if the [Elixir] turns out to be a fake, how does the son of the Aburage family get cured? A discerning person would immediately understand what happened since Miu has been in and out of the house.Although I said I\u2019d protect Miu, I, realistically speaking, is unlikely to be able to protect her. I\u2019m a commoner with no power or resources. I\u2019m prepared to give up my life to protect Miu from danger.However, the determination to give one\u2019s life alone isn\u2019t enough to counter the cleverly laid schemes. Surely there must be someone who\u2019s trying to surround Miu in other ways than by force.The first of these is my former family, the Count Takano family. The Marquis Teijo is protecting her now with the backing of the Marquise of Teijo. But that\u2019s shameful as a parent, and I wants to protect Miu. It\u2019s my role and my wish to protect my beloved family.My cute daughter believes that even if we tell her we\u2019ll protect her, there is a possibility that we may not be able to protect her. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could protect her, because Miu, with her pretty face, was frowning and looking anxious.\u201cPapa, Mama, I\u2019ll be strong! I\u2019ll protect everyone. I\u2019ll find a Shishou. Please lend me 500 yen!\u201dMy daughter, though very young, made a strong determination. Feeling the kind heart of Miu, who was healthy enough to try to protect us against the odds, I patted her on the head and told her to thank you, but I also had to do my best, which led me to make a strong decision.When I imagine Miu clutching a 500 yen coin and trying to apprentice herself to a magician, I find myself loving her more and more for her healthiness.There\u2019s a way. At least a way to prevent noble\u2019s tyranny, which commoners can\u2019t prevent.Now my wife and Miu are shopping for dinner. My wife said, \u201cLet\u2019s make bacon hamburger steak today.\u201d, and Miu jumped up and down with a smile of joy, and they went to the supermarket together.I had already talked to my wife, and she agreed that it was for Miu\u2019s sake, even though she didn\u2019t feel like it. So all that remained was my determination, but my will was firm.I picked up my phone and called the Teijo family. After a few moments of ringing, the person on the other end answered.\u201cYes, this is Teijo.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a direct call to the other party\u2019s smartphone. I have Ouga-san\u2019s smartphone phone number, but I wanted to make a formal request, so I called the house to make an appointment for a visit.The other party was an old man with a familiar voice. He must be the butler of the imperial family.\u201cThis is Takano.\u201d\u201cThis is Takano-sama. Thank you for your constant care.\u201dAfter politely repeating the greeting, they decided to tell each other what they wanted to talk about.\u201cI have a favor to ask of Teiho-san. I\u2019d like to visit. Is there a date and time that would be convenient for you?\u201d\u201cYou wish to visit? Is there something wrong?\u201dIt seems that Miu\u2019s story hasn\u2019t been conveyed yet. The guards protect her from afar, so they don\u2019t seem to know that Miu has cured someone else\u2019s magic disease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Daughter\u2019s Talent-Dad\u2019s POV-The Aburage family is an old and prestigious family, and although it\u2019s a small family, it\u2019s a prestigious maker of magic tools. They have many magic tools they inherited from the previous generation, and I\u2019m told during my visit that they tightened their security because [Yggdrasil] had been making moves to target their magic tools.That\u2019s why Miu\u2019s escort couldn\u2019t get close.\u201cThere is something I want to tell you about Miu, so I would like to hear from you the other day.\u201d\u201cOh \u2026\u2026 yuki-sama? Please wait a moment. The master is at home, so he\u2019ll take my place.\u201dThe butler, perhaps sensing something, immediately connected me to Ouga-san.I\u2019m gulping to keep my resolve unchanged, I clutch my phone tightly.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting. It\u2019s Ouga. Takano-san, how can I help you?\u201dOuga-san still has the same calm tone of voice and dignified air.\u201cMiu cures someone\u2019s magic disease.\u201d\u201c\u2026Magic disease? Is that true?\u201dOuga-san gasps at my words and asks in a surprised, and serious tone. Ouga-san himself must not have expected this. He had intended to look for a master recovery magician for Miu. But he said it was difficult because all recovery magicians get employed by other nobles. So Miu could use anything but her current recovery magic, and it was difficult for her to grow.But she could use magic that could cure magic disease without being taught by anyone. No wonder he was surprised.\u201cMuu\u2026\u2026 Miu-san may have a high talent for creating [Original Magic].\u201d\u201c[Original Magic]?\u201d\u201cYes. Every magic has an origin. The first magic was spread by those who created [Original Magic]. There is still [Original Magic]. It\u2019s not uncommon for Yamiyo to create two or three [Original Magic]. Everyone has [Original Magic] as their trump card.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the secret or innermost secrets of the clan, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSuch magic existed in the Takano family. As for me, who had not awakened to mana, I don\u2019t know the details, but other families have such profound secrets too.I\u2019m relieved to know that it\u2019s not uncommon. That is because Miu\u2019s talent is connected to danger. It\u2019s unworthy of a parent to desire safety over their child\u2019s talent, but I did not want her to have the power to attract attention now.But Ouga\u2019s continued words destroyed my hopes.\u201cThat\u2019s right. But there is a problem. Most people create [Original Magic] based on their family\u2019s secrets and previous magic. However, Miu-san could create magic that can cure magic disease. But she wasn\u2019t taught by anyone. Her talent is phenomenal.\u201d\u201cIf so, what do others think of Miu?\u201d\u201cThe amount of mana she has when she defeats the stone golem. And now that she could magic that can cure magic disease, she may be able to use other recovery magic. She may be able to use magic that can cure disability.\u201d\u201cDisability!\u201dIt\u2019s possible. I bite my lip. Miu\u2019s the girl who could easily cure magic disease. If she could cure a disability.\u201cThere are only 3 of them in Japan today. One is [Yggdrasil]\u2019s founder, one is a royal family member, and the last one is a witch who wanders around Japan!\u201dMiu will be the 4th person to become a recovery magician who can heal disability. There must be no end to the number of people who\u2019ll obtain her at any cost.\u201cTeijo-san, I will accept what you told me the other day.\u201dThen there is no longer much time left. Miu will enter the Magic Academy in the future. Miu will spread her power to the world. Even if she panics at that time, it will be too late.Ouga-san had told me to receive my peerage from time to time.\u201cI understand. I will present Takano-san\u2019s knighthood to His Majesty. If it\u2019s necessary to protect a recovery magician, a viscountship would not be a problem.\u201d\u201cViscount? I remember that the other day you were talking about a baron?\u201d\u201cThere is a possibility of Miu becoming a recovery magician who can cure disability in the future, then a viscount level is necessary. Even in the lower nobility, there\u2019s a difference between a baron and a viscount, because there\u2019s a difference between heaven and earth. If you are a viscount, it\u2019s easy for you to get promoted to the rank of count, and it\u2019s also possible for Miu to marry a high-ranking noble.\u201dMarriage, I\u2019d like Miu to have a love marriage, but I\u2019ll leave that for now. I\u2019m also planning to kick off all engagement offers.\u201cI\u2019m a viscount,\u2026\u2026 I understand. Please do.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me. I will act immediately, and I\u2019ll give you a good report the next time I see you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe conversation ends, and I hang up my phone. It\u2019s been a hell of a ride. Unlike Europe, Japanese aristocrats are not as fussy about etiquette, but there is still a lot to learn, and my position at work will probably change. Above all, I have to dive into the world of nobility, where all kinds of evil spirits of rivers and mountains swirl.\u201cI\u2019m home! I bought the ingredients for the hamburger.\u201dAs I recline tiredly on a chair to rest, Miu opens the door and jumps in with a bang.\u201cHeh.

Yggdrasil-???\u2019s POV-There is one island floating in the sea. It is Hachijojima in Tokyo, an island built 50 years ago near the archipelago.Built is the correct expression. Until then, it was just a reef, but it was reclaimed and turned into an island. The island was created as an artificial island, but over time the island was covered with forests, creating an environment rich in nature.However, since it is an artificial island that was constructed according to a plan, the harbor is well-constructed, and the buildings leading from the harbor are well-ordered. That plan was showing.The buildings arranged in a grid pattern resemble the old capital of Kyoto, and to cherish the scenery, the houses, and buildings are made like a mirror match.It is a mysterious landscape. It would be too much madness to build the same buildings in a mirror-image fashion. People construct buildings freely.To respect the landscape, there may be rules about not building buildings taller than a certain height, or about being careful with colors, but no one would listen to instructions to build the same building.But on this island, the instructions were working. Everyone was constructing the same buildings.The island was created as if creating a mirror world.That is because this artificial island belongs to [Yggdrasil]. The devout followers of [Yggdrasil] live there to worship their guru.Religious organization [Yggdrasil]. Only 60 years have passed since its establishment, but it was able to obtain an artificial island because the saint exists as its guru.The artificial island was built with enormous wealth, the power to allow construction, and enough magical power to make the plan possible.A townscape stretches to the center of the island. At the center of the island sits a huge building. Like the ancient capital of Kyoto and the palace where the lord of that city resided, it was a wooden building built in the palace style.Supported by slender pillars, as if ignoring its weight, the building had intricately layered one-story buildings that looked as if they were floating, like a garden in the air, or a grand labyrinth from the sight of its intricate corridors going back and forth. It is a palace built with magical architecture with a strength far beyond its original physical strength.There\u2019s a palace where the guru of [Yggdrasil] resides. It\u2019s a palace named [Yggdrasil Palace].A magnificent and gorgeous palace. Among the believers, those who are pious life there to take care of the guru. Everyone has a calm expression and lives without chatting.It\u2019s a place of peace and tranquility. In the innermost part of the [Yggdrasil Palace], where the guru lives, a fat old man sat on a polished wooden floor. He wears a fine suit, proudly wears the House of Lords badge on his lapel, and his wrinkled face is horrified by repeated power struggles.In the back room, which can be called the seat of honor, a bamboo blind is propped up, and through it, you can faintly see the shadow of a person. A solemn female voice can be heard through the blinds.\u201cO Life Leaf of Yggdrasil, heal this man\u2019s body with a fragment of eternal life.\u201d[Life Leaf].As the seated man\u2019s body glows faintly, the appearance of his face changes. The man\u2019s face, wrinkled and spotted, was transformed, the wrinkles reduced, and the spots disappeared.Then the light subsides, and the man flops down on his body. He rolls his shoulders, twists his hips, and grins.\u201cOh, Guru-sama! My body feels better! The numbness from physical exhaustion is gone, and my aching back is healed. The stomach upset I always felt is gone, and I feel refreshed!\u201dMore than impressed, the smirk and sneer express the superior\u2019s feeling of deserved superiority.\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Senator, I hope you are feeling better and you will continue to be active in politics. Also, the offer that healed your health this time\u2026\u201d\u201cHa ha ha! You can count on me. I will ask my acquaintances to ensure that there are no further prosecution pursuits against [Yggdrasil].\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a big deal. I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me! We\u2019ll discuss a thick steak as soon as I get home. After all, I can eat as much as I want now!\u201dDeclaring he\u2019ll start overworking his healed body as soon as possible. The senator patted his fat belly.\u201cBe moderate. That body has just healed. It can break down again\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand, Guru-sama. Please take care of me again.\u201dThe senator nodded with a high laugh, but it was easy to predict that she would never protect him, but the guru did not say anything more. She knew it would be futile.Then the senator bowed, stood up and left the room in high spirits. As soon as he got home, he would probably have drinks, women, and a sumptuous meal. His flabby face remained grinning and ugly smiling.Five followers emerged from the opposite aisle and passed by the senator. One of them glanced sideways at the senator and huffed as if the follower were making fun of him.The senator would take his waiting secretary and head up to the waiting helicopter.The five of them enter the back room and sit in front of the curtain, each in their seat. Some sit neatly in seiza, others on hutches, each in their way. Some do not look as if they are paying homage to the Guru. The only thing they have in common is they wear white robes and deep hoods that hide their faces.\u201cGuru-sama, you are in a good mood.\u201dOf the five, the one with the straight back and neatly sitting upright bows their head in greeting. From their demeanor, it is clear that they respect the Guru.\u201cGuru-sama, that senator\u2019s secretary was handing the trunk case he\u2019s carrying to the receptionist.\u201d\u201cIt must contain a billion dollars if it\u2019s that big.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for a single magic trick.\u201d\u201cAn equal share, I hope?\u201dThe others are all in the same tone, ranging from lighthearted to companionable. Some were grinning and twisted their mouths as if they wanted the money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yggdrasil-???\u2019s POV-Not very much, but they did not look like devout believers whose doctrine is to save people. Each seemed to be thinking only of themselves.\u201cFu, my five apostles, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re still in good health.\u201dHowever, the Guru behind the curtain showed no sign of concern.\u201cThe reward this time is 1.2 billion; 600 million is for the Yggdrasil. The rest will be divided equally among the six.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the equality in that? Are you the leader of a comic band?\u201dSeeing one man click his tongue, the Guru laughed like she was teasing him.\u201cNo matter how much money you have, it\u2019s not enough to support the cult. That was the deal from the beginning, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWe have subordinates to feed too\u2026\u201dSome express their dissatisfaction by shaking their bodies.\u201cHmph. I have tens of thousands, and you have tens. I think it would be good to have more for me.\u201d\u201cAs per our original agreement. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. You\u2019re right. We gotta keep our contract.\u201dFinally, the conversation ended, and things quieted down slightly. If devout believers had seen this scene, they might have been outraged by their attitude toward the Guru.But to them, it was business as usual.\u201cA paid top executive. Not something a devout believer could see.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think powerful magicians will conveniently become your followers.\u201d\u201cThey have basic money and power. They won\u2019t bother to join any shady religions.\u201d\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll need to give them more money and power than they currently have.\u201dThe Guru laughed and continued talking. Yes, these top executives were hired by the guru. They were neither loyal nor devout followers. There was no reason for a powerful magician who possessed money and power to come to the emerging religion, Yggdrasil.These five are corrupt. They had a magical power, but did not know how to make money, were not smart, used by the powerful, or criminals.Giving them large sums of money and providing them with connections to those in power, the Guru hired these five as top executives.\u201cSo, what I gathered this time was nothing else. Hrungnir obtainer the [Crown of Clay].\u201dAt the Guru\u2019s words, one large-built man puffed out his chest, while the others looked on in admiration. The man called Hrungnir opens his mouth with a smile.\u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s right. I have exchanged it for that crappy fake elixir. \u2026I was going to kill them all and take it from them when they refused to trade. I thought it would be a worthwhile fight, but it turned out to be a bore.\u201dCarelessly, he pulls a rusty crown from his pocket and tosses it on the floor. The Guru\u2019s attendant, looking flustered, picks up the crown and reverently brings it to the Guru.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re a mess. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a big chance you killed around so roughly because you didn\u2019t get what you wanted.\u201d\u201cIf you make fun of a magic tool user, you\u2019ll get hurt, you know.\u201d\u201cNo shit. So, is it real? It\u2019s going too well, I\u2019m afraid. I feel like we\u2019re getting bamboozled.\u201dAt Hrungnir\u2019s words of concern, the Guru, who has the crown, nodded and sent mana into it. The rusty forehead crown glows, and the rusty parts disappear as if melting. The room was illuminated and radiated a mysterious power. However, the light gradually subsided and returned to the original rusty forehead crown.\u201cHmmm\u2026 It seems I don\u2019t have enough mana. It looks like it\u2019s been neglected for a while, so I guess I\u2019ll have to pour mana into it daily.\u201dThe Guru clicks her tongue and hands the Crown of Clay to the attendant. The attendant nods, accepts the Crown of Clay, and hands it to Hrungnir.\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a dirty, clogged water pipe. You have to run the water over, and over again to clean the dirt and clean it out.\u201d\u201cWow, thanks for explaining it so clearly. Does that mean I have to keep the manna flowing?\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt that it is genuine, but there is something wrong with the mana. That\u2019s all you can do.\u201dThe Guru shrugs and Hrungnir looks disgusted.\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass! Leave it to someone else.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a divine weapon I intend to let you use until I revive the Demon God. It has a powerful power, but if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll leave it to someone else.\u201d\u201cTsk. It can\u2019t be helped. There will be more rough stuff to come. I\u2019ll pour mana in my spare time.\u201dWhile clucking his tongue at the Guru\u2019s words, Hrungnir put away his crown in his pocket. A Sacred Artifact cannot fully draw out its abilities unless only one\u2019s mana gets poured into it. Hrungnir had no choice but to accept it.When he saw that he was satisfied with the situation, the Guru continued her story.\u201cAccording to the books, there are four Sacred Artifacts that remain. Each of you must devote yourselves and collect all the sacred artifacts.\u201d\u201cHa. We will all do our best to revive the Demon God.\u201dThe executives nodded their heads as they bowed deeply.\u201cThe Demon God will back \u2026\u2026. It will be a restraining force against other countries.\u201d\u201cHow much can you sell a set of Sacred Artifacts?\u201d\u201cPowerful Sacred Artifacts Analyze\u201d\u201cIn the meantime, give me the reward money for the Sacred Artifacts.\u201d\u201cIf we rebuild the world, a happy world awaits us\u2026\u201dEveryone united their hearts and pledged their efforts to the Guru to revive the world-destroying Demon God.There is more than one idea that they\u2019re oriented toward. They are determined to act to revive the Demon God.In the novel, most of these discussions are not described. To portray the discussions as scenes for the sake of looking good, these five were represented as if they were pious fanatics.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Slums-???\u2019s POV-It was a desolate area. It\u2019s a dirty place to live. Abandoned buildings are lined up in a row, and plywood boards are randomly placed on the window frames to connect the abandoned buildings. There are many narrow roads, and places that are blocked by lockers and abandoned vehicles.The pedestrian bridge looked like a garbage dump, and many monsters were hanging from the bridge with strings tied to their bones. The store barely exists, but the windows are covered with boards, the shelves are empty, and the store is guarded by a muscular man who seems accustomed to rough work.The inhabitants are various, such as those with tired faces, those who look as if something is wrong, and those who are lethargic.If an ordinary person were to enter, they would not be treated with impunity. Men are stripped naked and floating in the gutter as corpses, and women are attacked and sold to brothels. It is an extraterritorial place that even the police will not enter. The slums were there.It is a crucible for criminals and the impoverished poor, from robbers to hit men, homeless people and prostitutes, and drug dealers.Fights and even killings are common in this area, but today was different.Several abandoned buildings had collapsed, sending up a cloud of dust that fell like ashes. The dust covered the ground, and the fallen disappeared.Flames were shooting out from the decaying houses, and the fire was spreading. The hyenas, who would try to take the bodies of the dead, realized that their lives were in danger and ran away screaming, turning the scene into a screaming hell.Amidst the spreading smell of fire, smoke, death, and blood, robed men in black stood holding swords dripping with blood in their hands.One of the robed humans found an emaciated woman who was shivering, perhaps because she had failed to escape, the robed human swung their sword down emotionlessly, killing her without a second thought.The woman screams and collapses. As the robed men try to advance further, a flaming bullet flies at their feet. When they land with a roar, they explode, scattering flames, but the targeted person has evaded backward.\u201cWhat the hell are you, you bastards!\u201dA woman\u2019s yell echoes and dozens of people appear, their footsteps clattering wildly. They were all armed with iron pipes, knives, and short rifles.There are three times as many as those in robes. A young girl, who must be the leader, leaps down from the sky, her face covered with fury. She still had childishness, but her eyes were wild and showed a stern look accustomed to roughness.\u201cUh-huh? You\u2019re the leader here, aren\u2019t you?\u201dOne of the robed humans came forward, clapping his shoulders in trouble, and opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s right! I am Youko! I\u2019m Youko, the Nine-Tailed Youko-sama! I\u2019m the boss of this territory! You do whatever you want in my territory. Where do you belong?\u201dThe girl has fox ears and a fox tail and does not look human. She is a magician. Because of her dirtiness, her fox ears and tail are as thin and dirty as if she were a burdock.\u201cAh, yes, yes. I don\u2019t live in such a dirty place. Do you guys live in a dump like this?\u201dThe man chuckles as he picks his ear. Youko\u2019s miffed face turns angry.\u201cEven here, you live in a dump!\u201d\u201cYou seem to have a lot of power, you know. I see, in a place like this, you can be the king of the mountain, can\u2019t you? In a place like this\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dThe man in the robe laughs, and Youko\u2019s friends, unable to bear their anger, leap out of the way. They raise an iron pipe and swing it mercilessly down on his head. The man does not even run away, but grins.With a gulp, Youko\u2019s friend swings the iron pipe down on the robed man\u2019s brain and grins at the sure response, but the next moment, they look startled.When the robed man removes his hood, there isn\u2019t a scratch on him. He grabs the man\u2019s face with his hands and lifts the grown man with one hand. The man with the robe off was a man with blond hair and golden eyes.\u201cOh, stinky, stinky, are you guys taking a bath?\u201d\u201cGet the fuck off me, you motherfucker!\u201dThe man in the robe lightly applied his hand to the violently flailing man.Squash.The flailing man\u2019s head of the man crushed like a watermelon, flooded with brain plasma, and stopped moving as blood trickled out.Throwing it away, the robed man crosses his arms as he pumps up.\u201cI\u2019m Hrungnir, one of the executives of [Nidhogg]. I\u2019m the one who acts to change the world into the right form. That\u2019s it, you know, the ally of justice.\u201d\u201cBullshit! How dare you kill my friends?\u201d\u201cOh, come on, he attacked me first. I was defending myself.\u201dYouko waves her arms and yells at Hrungnir, who smiles gleefully.\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? You\u2019ve been killing all my friends who lived here!\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s that. It\u2019s called a necessary expense, yeah. You see, if you kill enough people, the boss of this territory will come to you, right? That\u2019s what I needed to do. Well, they\u2019re not productive alive. You didn\u2019t mind killing them, did you?\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026 only did it for that?\u201dYouko asked back, feeling intimidated by his light tone, but Fulongnir nodded unconcernedly.\u201cThey\u2019re a group of criminals anyway. People should\u2019ve killed them, right?\u201d\u201cScrew you! But we still live here!\u201dThey are indeed a group of criminals. Pickpocketing and stealing are commonplace. They drink, sell their bodies, and do drugs. They even kill people, depending on the money people are willing to pay.But they were important friends to Youko, who had come to live here as a child.\u201cHa! If you kill a group of criminals, they may thank you, but they won\u2019t hate you. Except for scum like you guys. .. But more importantly, don\u2019t you guys know what a magical tool is? It\u2019s called the Crown of Clay, and I finally got word that it\u2019s here, and I screwed up6 years ago. That was a mistake.\u201dYouko\u2019s face palls at Hrungnir\u2019s line, which he says in a light tone of regret, and she bites her lip and glares back at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll kill you! You\u2019re going to die!\u201dYouko shouts, her vision turning red at Hrungnir\u2019s words.

I won\u2019t let them get away!\u201dYouko\u2019s friends attack Hrungnir and the others. Youko also creates flames in her palm and glares with hatred at her vengeance.\u201cMy parents let me escape when you guys broke in that day. Along with my brother.\u201dYouko, who had no power, escaped with her brother and some magic tools. Her parents promised to come to get her as soon as possible.\u2026\u2026 However, her parents did not come to pick her up, and Youko wandered with his younger brother. Before long, her younger brother died, and now Yoko has only a few magic tools. She became the boss of a small group in the slums. Then Youko awakens her mana. That\u2019s what happened.With revenge in her heart, she\u2019s survived by committing crimes. And now, she has her revenge targets in front of her.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d[Fox Fire]She sends several flame bullets bouncing off her palm. Hrungnir holds up his palm with a look of satisfaction and swings it to cancel out the flame bullets.\u201cHa! How can I lose to someone who hasn\u2019t even learned to use mana properly?\u201d\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201dYouko uses her fox people\u2019s physical abilities to leap through the air and release a fox fire.

Iron pipes get repelled by their bodies, and knives do not pierce them. Youko\u2019s friends shoot guns and try to counter the magicians, but they don\u2019t even penetrate the magicians\u2019 robes, and they get slashed to death with the magician\u2019s swords.\u201cBuhaha, look at your men. They\u2019re trash. They can\u2019t even put a scratch on us.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me.\u201d[Mirage]She uses her trump card. Youko\u2019s figure faded with the fog, and even her presence vanished.\u201cFuuuhh. Let\u2019s do it. Do you know where I am?\u201dYouko laughed and gently slid into Hrungnir\u2019s chest. The others can\u2019t hurt him, but she\u2019s a magician. Her dagger is imbued with mana and can hurt them.With a hiss, Youko\u2019s dagger slices through Hrungnir\u2019s neck.\u201cHa, take this!\u201dBecause of the attack, Youko\u2019s figure emerges, but Youko is convinced of her victory without worrying about it.\u201cYou\u2019re good, little girl!\u201d\u201cWhat the!\u201dSurprisingly, Youko\u2019s attack only made Hrngnir\u2019s neck red and swollen. Youko paused and was stunned her full force, all-out attack, had not worked.And Hrungnir did not miss the opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s over. I\u2019ll throw you in the trash.\u201dAnd with that, a crystal spear is produced from his palm and pierces Youko\u2019s chest. Youko died without getting her revenge..........That was the end of Tamamo\u2019s dream. When she wakes up, she forgets the content, but it is a nightmare she has from time to time. When she was too scared to sleep, she would go to the place with her mom and dad and cries to sleep.That was Tamamo\u2019s nightmare, but today was different.She blinked that she\u2019s died, and then realized she was safe. No, she had changed her appearance too.\u201cHey, what the hell?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a slum. It\u2019s somewhere unknown.For some reason, Hrungnir kneeled and looked impatient.\u201cAh? You don\u2019t know my name, so you\u2019re a regular character.\u201dAnd in front of Tamamo. There was a beautiful girl with gray hair that looked silver. Several other people were standing around her, but they were in shadows, and she couldn\u2019t see them.\u201cHey, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m air. It\u2019s sad to be a mob, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe gray-haired beauty laughed and held her hand to the confused and disoriented Hrungnir. Then she said something and shot a flash of light. Then Tamamo woke up.The first time she opened my eyes, she felt she had a scary dream, but later felt like it had turned into a happy dream, and she smiled. She somehow knew that nothing sad was going to happen any longer.\u201cUnyah. Hornbear cow, bear, cow?\u201dSleeping next to her, talking in her sleep, is Em-chan, who has come to sleep over. The sleep-talking makes her laugh, and Tamamo pokes Em-chan on the cheek.\u201cGood morning, Em-chan.\u201d\u201cMorning~, Tamamo-chan.\u201dSeeing Em-chan respond sleepily, her heart warms.After that, she never had the same nightmare again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yamiyo In Training-Yamiyo\u2019s POV-Teijo Yamiyo wields her sword and quickly steps in to move. A scarecrow on its way cuts through the air and falls. At 9 years old, Yamiyo shows off her prodigious swordsmanship. Her figure was as beautiful as the starlight shining in the darkness.[Consecutive Slash]Her sword was imbued with the light of mana, and the speed with which Yamiyo wielded it exceeded the limits of humans. It was like a momentary sparkle, and the sword strike, which was hard to see, was beautiful.\u201cWell done, Yamiyo-sama. Even though it is a simple [Consecutive Slash], it is difficult to swing that beautifully and that fast.\u201d\u201cThank you, Instructor.\u201dWith a snap, she sheathed her sword, and Yamiyo smiles. Her maid brings a cold towel, so she wipes her face lightly and brushes her pigtails.The place where Yamiyo is now is the Teijo family\u2019s training grounds. It is a well-maintained clearing, and the walls surrounding the training ground are covered with strong protection magic to reduce the possibility of stray bullets flying outside.At 9 year old, Yamiyo had trained as hard as an adult. She\u2019s already a full-fledged swordsman. Yamiyo is skilled enough to defeat the average samurai.\u201cMiss Yamiyo. Excuse me. I think you\u2019ve trained too hard. You should play with Miss Miu, don\u2019t you think?\u201dWorried about Yamiyo\u2019s recent focus on training, the instructor encourages her to play with her friends. Children need to play with their friends. It is not good to be absorbed only in playing, but it is necessary to have fun.Especially high-ranking nobles need to be good communicators. Many things can\u2019t be acquired by studying alone, such as how to play, and talk according to their opponent. It is also synonymous with prearranged social gatherings, especially at tea parties and evening gatherings where you have to put down roots.The only ones who look mushy and pretend to be cool are those with overwhelming power who don\u2019t need to worry about others. And there is nothing to be gained by doing so. So everyone was worried about Yamiyo.\u201cI understand. But I want the power to be able to protect Mii-Sama.\u201dYamiyo also understood what the instructor said. After all, she\u2019s only 9 years old. She\u2019s of a playful age.However, Yamiyo was of little use during the battle with the stone golem. She managed to land one blow, and Mii-Sama thanked her with the cutest smile in the world because the stone golem almost hit her, which made me happy, but it was only one blow. It was beyond pathetic.So, Yamiyo wanted the power to defeat the stone golem when the same thing happened. Therefore, she refused to play with Mii-Sama and trained with her.\u201cYamiyo, you are too narrow-minded.\u201dWhen the instructors were at a loss as to how to persuade the stubborn Yamiyo, a dignified and solemn voice called out from behind. Yamiyo turned around at the familiar voice, and as expected, her father was walking in a kimono.\u201cFather. What does it mean?\u201dShe feels like she\u2019s been denied what she does, and puffs out her cheeks to give him a childish look.Seeing this, Ouga chuckles that Yamiyo\u2019s still a child, but decides to tell his daughter a simple way out of the current situation.\u201cWeapons. You used the mass-produced Magic Armor Kotetsu Type 22, right?\u201d\u201cYes, it is the latest model. Any more than this, and it would be a dedicated machine, but I\u2019m still growing, and as expected, no matter how much money I have, it\u2019s a waste.\u201dYamiyo quietly looks at the magic armor she\u2019s used. That is true. Kotetsu Type 22 was remodeled to Yamiyo\u2019s size. You can\u2019t make something that costs that much money, such as a special machine, for a 9-year-old. At least if she\u2019s 12 years old.However, it is limited to magic armor.\u201cIf it\u2019s the magic armor, there should be no problem. Use this.\u201dWith a flick of his chin, the secretary handed a long, thin box made of paulownia wood to Yamiyo. The paulownia box\u2019s covered with several sealed talismans, and people can feel the darkness\u2019 strong power from within.\u201cFather, what is this?\u201dYamiyo, sensing something powerful from inside the box, asks suspiciously, but Ouga urges her to open the box.The box is made of paulownia wood, and when she peels off the seal, unties the string, and gently opens it, she\u2019ll find a sword in a black lacquered sheath. Just by looking at it, she can sense its tremendous power.\u201cThe name of the sword is [Night Heaven]. It is one of the magic tools handed down in our family since ancient times.\u201d\u201c[Night Heaven]. What a beautiful blade.\u201dWhen she pulled out the sword, the blade seemed to glow like the light of a star shining in the darkness. The dark aura covered the sword, and Yamiyo understood the mighty power of the sword.After all, pulling out the sword felt like her skin was trembling, and she felt her mana sucked out of her hand. No, her mana gets sucked away.\u201cGuh. Father, what is this?\u201d\u201cIt is proof that you are still inexperienced. That sword absorbs mana. The only way to prevent it is to manipulate mana, so it doesn\u2019t absorb your mana.\u201dYamiyo\u2019s head wobbled, and she almost fell to her knees. Gritting her teeth, Yamiyo endures, but she will soon runs out of mana.Seeing this, Ouga remained unconcerned and had a look on his face that said it was to be expected. It is only natural. [Night Heaven] is a sword with that much power. It is one of our family heirlooms that chooses its owner. A half-boiled person can\u2019t even hold it, let alone handle it.\u201cYamiyo, with the amount of your mana, you should be able to fight for several minutes even in your current state. You also could cut one or two limbs of the stone golem.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s great. Thank you, Father.\u201dSeveral advantages of this sword immediately came to Yamiyo\u2019s mind. She can use it in an emergency, and if used in regular training, it can be her exercise in mana manipulation. And, since she could return to her usual training pace, she could play with Mii-Sama.However, Father told me more than that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yamiyo In Training-Yamiyo\u2019s POV-\u201cWe Marquis hae both wealth and power. Of course, we also have military might. This time, I gave you the family heirloom as a quick way to gain power. But you don\u2019t need to say more than that, do you?\u201dYamiyo felt the kindness in the depths of her father\u2019s stern eyes, and nodded. He\u2019s a rather Spartan father, but still kind.\u201cThe range that a single sword can protect is small. And there is really very little that can be protected by military force. You need to lay the groundwork in the political arena. Hire a strong bodyguard, keep checks and balances around you, increase your network of allies, right?\u201d\u201cExactly. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that the heir to the marquis family can protect everything just by wielding a sword.\u201dIt\u2019s true. Yamiyo\u2019s direction and effort was wrong. If this is a person of ordinary origins, it would be fine. However, she\u2019s a member of the marquis family. She can and must take various other means.\u201cMmm\u2026\u2026\u2026 those are harsh words. Then I will follow your recommendation and make time to play with Mii-sama starting tomorrow.\u201dShe answered with a calm face, but Yamiyo was doing a dance of joy inwardly. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll bring Mii-Sama\u2019s favorite snack. Would chocolate be good?Ouga smiling wryly, as if he could see right through her, invites Yamiyo to talk again.This time, Yamiyo stopped her training and followed Ouga.They return to the living room and sit across the table from each other. Yamiyo straightens her back, knowing that her father has something important to say.Yamiyo confirms the lady-in-waiting puts her coffee on the table, bows, and lefts, while Ouga lifts his coffee cup and takes a sip. Yamiyo\u2019s is Horn Rabbit Cow\u2019 iced milk, drizzled with Honey Bee honey, and the coldness is gently sweet and comforting.\u201cActually, we have decided to promote Takano Yoshiyuki-dono a noble.\u201d\u201cBaron, right? Has Mii-sama\u2019s father finally made up his mind?\u201dYamiyo has also heard about it. It is impossible for a commoner to protect Mii-sama, the recovery magician.\u201cNo, he\u2019ll became a viscount. I presented it to His Majesty and he accepted it.\u201d\u201cViscount? Is there a reason for that?\u201dThe unexpected words made Yamiyo unable to hide her surprise. Even when he become a Baron, Mii-sama\u2019s father could protect Mii-sama from other nobles, and there alot of barons, so it\u2019s okay. The only thing about nobility is honor. Since he\u2019s a noble, other nobles can\u2019t be too forceful.But it is a different story if he\u2019s a viscount. From viscounts and up are the \u2018real noble\u2019. Everyone is the president of some company and has financial power. Unlike in medieval times, they do not have territory, but they still receive preferential treatment in the form of taxes.That was one of the causes of the widening gap between nobles and commoners, since the more money they made, the more they were treated favorably.That is why it is so hard to become a viscount; only about 100 families are viscounts. Even though Mii-sama\u2019s father is the former second son of a count, he is a commoner, and with all due respect, Yamiyo doesn\u2019t think it would be possible for Mii-Sama\u2019s father, who has no assets to become a viscount.But becoming a viscount, there must be something going on. It can only be about Mii-sama.\u201cActually, Miu-chan healed someone of their magic disease.\u201dWith that one word, she understood. In order to protect Mii-sama, Yamiyo was desperately investigating the current situation of the recovery magic users. Miu could have looked into it too, but she did not. It\u2019s because her knowledge of the game was against her.\u201cThere are only ten recovery magicians who can heal magic diseas now, aren\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay, now Mii-sama is 9 years old. If she can heals magic disease, she\u2019ll even heal disability in the future.\u201dMii-sama is a genius. She will surely be able to heal it. So it\u2019s an up-front investment. Yamiyo will have to be by her side more and more to protect her.\u201cIf Yoshiyuki-dono become a viscount, it will be easy to promote Miu-chan to the rank of knight, and she\u2019ll also be engaged to a high ranking noble.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cKohoh, that\u2019s the way it is for now. You must protect her. The girl is not a good fighter. She is a typical recovery magician.\u201dYamiyo thought she heard some auditory hallucination, but it was just her imagination. Thank goodness. She\u2019s wondered why her father was coughing. She wonder if it\u2019s a cold. We\u2019ll have to be careful as we enter the rainy season.\u201cCertainly. I understand. I swear to protect Mii-sama for the rest of her life.\u201dYaito swear by this [Night Heaven].Mii-Sama is a recovery magician. Yamiyo, who have combat power, financial power, and power, must protect her.Yamiyo made a strong determination and raised the [Night Heaven] high.The current Yamiyo has diverged greatly from the Yakuya of the novel. How it will affect the original story, even God will not know.However, Yamiyo has grown up one step more for the sake of her best friend.At least, there was no longer any possibility for bugs to get close to Mii-sama.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Full-scale Level Up!-Miu\u2019s POV-Violet poisonous clouds float in the dark sky, and sludge-colored poisonous swamps cover the ground. As it bubbled up, the poisonous swamp created a poisonous air that corroded the body, turning the land into a stagnant miasma world.The stagnant air made it difficult to see what was ahead, and in this land of poor visibility, some figures were wandering, wobbling, and staggering. The figure was too thin and too tall in the miasma.Every time it walks, it makes a squeaky sound while swaying its body.A gust of wind blew the stagnant miasma, causing it to flow and dissipate. After the noxious miasma air blew away, all that remained was a dead tree. No, it is not a dead tree. It could not be just a dead tree.Because the dead tree had split its roots into two halves and was walking with a leaning body, using them instead of its legs. The presence of monsters was there.The slender trunk had knot holes like a face, and several purple butterflies with purple wings on their dead branches with their wings folded.They made a creaking sound and walked, leaving footprints in the poisonous swamp. Their footprints soon sank into the mud and disappeared.The dead tree seemed to roam this swamp forever, but then it stopped moving with a snap and tried to turn its hole in the trunk, which resembled a face as if it had noticed something.Then it lifted the arm of the dead tree and slowly moved as if to check something.\u201c[Foxfire!]\u201dIt gets shot with a flaming fireball that suddenly appears to leap out of space and burns its body.\u201cKika kika kika!\u201dThe butterflies perched on trees flap their wings and leave to escape from the dead tree monsters covered in blazing flames. Eerily, the butterfly\u2019s elongated body vertically splits and ticks and wriggles. Its mouth-like torso has irregular teeth, and its tongue-like proboscis licks its body.\u201cWow. That\u2019s creepy! [Foxfire Barrage!]\u201dA girl appears in the space where the flame bullet was fired. She is a girl with fluffy fox ears and a tail. She wears a light black \u2018magic armor\u2019 with gold lines and holds a dagger with a large ruby in her hand.The poisonous butterflies flapped their wings, their faces pulled back, mouths appeared as if their bodies had been ripped open, and they released more firebombs.Some of the butterflies burn and fall to the ground with a plop, disappearing into the mud, leaving only smoke in their wake.\u201cGet back!\u201dThe fox girl steps back as she spins around in midair, her magical armor clad in the blue-white light of mana. In her place, a black-haired, black-eyed girl, who shouts sharply and puts on the armed, jet-black leotard-like magic armor, charges forward, waving her glossy black hair in a bun of pigtails.She jumps up with a ton of lightness, stretches beautifully, and swings the sword in her hand.[Flying Sword Slash].As she slashes through space in succession, several blades that look like they are coated in jet black fly from her sword, cutting through the butterflies flying in the sky.The butterflies are torn apart, leaving only a dead tree devoured by the flames instantly. Only a few butterflies still survived, and they flapped their wings, exposing their turbulent teeth on their bodies, to chase after the two girls.[Light Chain Binding].However, a chain made of light flies through the air and knocks the butterfly off. As the butterfly falls to dive into the mud, several adventurers appear, then check the butterfly, which cannot fly, and nod at each other with their faces.Then they turn around and call out.\u201cCome on, now!\u201d\u201cOh, I beat it!.\u201dFrom the back appeared a young girl with beautiful gray hair that looked silvery and still very young, with her beautiful gray hair flowing down her back.\u201cToi tei. Ei.\u201dAnd with that, her shimmering ice blue eyes darkly clouded, she crushed the butterfly, which flapped its wings violently in an attempt to fly away in the mud, with the mace in her hand.\u201cCongratulations, Miu-sama.\u201d\u201cWoe, I\u2019m happy!\u201dThe girl replies in a listless voice as she listens to the adventurers applauding and praising her. She smiles.\u201cYou did a great job, Tamamo-san. As if the game was decided with the first surprise attack. I didn\u2019t expect you to defeat the wandering tree that fasts.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Yamiyo-chan! You beat most of the poisonous butterflies that were there!\u201dHigh-fiving each other and happily praising each other are Aburage Tamamo and Teijo Yamiyo. Their faces are tearing up with joy that they worked well together.They\u2019re in the [Poison Swamp] Dungeon. It\u2019s a dungeon with many poisonous demons and many poisonous swamps. The gray-haired girl, I, Takano Miu, shake my shoulders at the sight of this friendly atmosphere.Finally, unable to bear it any longer, I open my mouth. I stomp on the ground, my face red with anger, and I yell out.\u201cEntertainment golf! It\u2019s worse than entertainment golf! Let me fight like a normal person! It\u2019s boring! It\u2019s not funny!\u201dI exclaimed, my cheeks puffing up like a blowfish in frustration.\u201cThat, I want a normal fight too. The last 9 months. I\u2019ve been like this most of the time, and I haven\u2019t had any real training, you know?\u201dI\u2019m a good girl and a gentle Miu. So, just in my heart, I yell, \u201cUgaaaahhh\u201d.\u201cThat can\u2019t be helped, Mii-sama. Mii-sama is a recovery magician. Because everyone would protect you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, leave it to Tamamo and the others! Em-chan, save your mana for emergencies!\u201dYamiyo notices my frustration and smiles gently to appease me. Tamamo puffed out her chest and gave a good thumbs up.\u201cI could fight too. I\u2019m not getting stronger at all!\u201dCome on come on come on. Miu just said that.\u201cMiu-sama has grown as a recovery magician. I\u2019m sorry that you still haven\u2019t found a master recovery magic user, but no need to rush.\u201dThe instructor patted Miu on the shoulder, telling me to calm down, but I don\u2019t need a recovery magician master. I don\u2019t need one. I want to say I\u2019ll level up and learn magic on my own, but it\u2019s a top-priority secret, so I feel frustrated that I can\u2019t say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Full-scale Level Up!-Miu\u2019s POV-Yes, we had come to the dungeon to work out. 9 months had passed since the Crown of Clay incident. In response to my declaration to become stronger, once every two weeks I decided to enter the dungeon with Yamiyo and the others. For some reason, Tamamo wanted to get stronger, so she joined and trained with us.So there was one problem. We\u2019re training. Besides diving in the dungeon, we\u2019re also training. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. No, it makes some sense, but it\u2019s more about defeating monsters in the dungeon, which is the shortest route to becoming stronger.But that\u2019s just me. That\u2019s the story only for me in the game specifications. Others train, sweat, and accumulate experience to become skilled and strong.In my case, I become strong by defeating monsters, accumulating experience, and proficiency. Strangely enough, a slight difference in the Japanese language can make a big difference in how I become strong. Japanese is a difficult language.So for everyone else, the dungeon is like a book game to test the results of their practice, nothing more. For that reason, I had to sweat, toil and practice in the dungeon. Yamiyo and others protected me for my recovery magic.It was a troubling situation. The dungeon was my training ground, but they wouldn\u2019t let me fight properly.When an NPC damages an enemy. Even if they defeat it, their experience is drastically reduced. You could say it\u2019s a common thing in games.It\u2019s been 9 months since the Teijo family took care of me. My level did not go up at all. I\u2019m playing golf with twice as many guards as before because I\u2019m a precious recovery magician. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m fighting at all.Yamiyo and the others comforted me, but the situation remained the same.And they are two people who have become stronger through training.Teijo Yamiyo, level 27Aburage Tamamo, level 22The two firmly show the results of their training. It\u2019s not fair. I want to level up too. I mean, these girls are strong from the start. They\u2019re not like me with my game specs. Their abilities are not from zero. They\u2019re strong from the start.The two change the subject to comfort me, unaware of my heart. They are kind. They are so kind that I can\u2019t say anything unreasonable.\u201cMii-sama will make her debut in the social world with us next month. Why don\u2019t we decide on accessories that go with the dress when we get back?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Em-chan, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dMy father suddenly became a viscount 6 months ago. To protect me, that\u2019s for sure. I can\u2019t see the front of my eyes because I\u2019m in tears of love for my family. But for that reason, when I turned 10, I had to make my debut at a party held at the imperial castle. What a hassle.I like to dress up as the pretty Miu, but I don\u2019t intend to show my (Miu)\u2019s appearance to others.And I\u2019m not strong enough. Not enough at all. If only I had a little more power.\u201cOh, I found another monster!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Poison Toad!\u201dA one-meter frog slithers out of the swamp. Its skin is covered in blotches and is purple. This dungeon is a troublesome place. Our enemies have a low attack power, but they attack with poison. However, the poison is nullified by the poison-protection warding beads provided by the Aburages.That frog also spits poison, which is nasty, but on the contrary, its attack power is low, so it does not scare me anymore.\u201cI\u2019ll take them down. You guys stay back!\u201dGive me decent amount of experience!After Oryaing, I raise my mace to Poison Toad and charge at it. Using my magic armor power, I close the gap between us at about the maximum speed of a moped bike.Knowing Poison Toad\u2019s power, Yamiyo and the others look at me warmly without interfering.\u201cTaaah!\u201dPoison Toad spits poison water like a squirt gun, but the anti-poison ward is activated, the magic light shield repels the poison water, and I crush the frog. Poison-proof warding is very useful.The moment I beat it, a fanfare rings out.[Defeated Poison Toad! Acquired 130 experience. Leveled up! Thief II\u2019s proficiency has increased!

Slums And Drunks-???\u2019s POV-A dog\u2019s howl comes from somewhere. The howl gives a somewhat ominous feeling to those who hear it. The sun has already set, and the sky is pitch black. The neon lights on the ground obscure the starry sky. And no one can\u2019t see a glimpse.The full moon has reached the mid-sky, and a chilly wind is blowing through the streets. Winter is almost over, but it will be a few weeks before the cold is gone. People are turning up the collars of their coats, hands in their pockets, and speeding home.Those who wanted to warm up early would go into the taverns and have a drink before going home, either with a good-humored laugh or with a complaint about the company.That\u2019s an ordinary night scene in the Imperial capital. Occasionally, a police officer, looking like a pain in the ass, would straddle a bicycle and make his rounds. Children, who are happy to go out at night, secretly buy food at convenience stores.It was a peaceful scene.However, from the sky, something strange happened. The neon lights and household electric lamps illuminated a corner of the cityscape, but it was dark as if the power had gone out.The area looks cut off by a black hole or something. Some places in the Imperial City are off-limits, and this is one of them.The area is a slum. It\u2019s a place where even the police are not allowed to enter, and it\u2019s dangerous unless a group of warriors enters together during criminal investigations.The slums are an area that was abandoned during urban planning due to a lack of budget. It\u2019s also unclear who owns the land, and many of the buildings were stopped halfway through construction, with most of them exposed to rusty steel. The store, with a dirty and tattered banner hanging down, was probably intended to be open, but the windowpanes were black, and the inside was not visible. There were no shelves, and a pile of garbage covered the store.Some shops are open, but the waxed windows, which used to be glassed like barricades, are firmly bolted down with sheet metal affixed.Dirty people are hiding on street corners, keeping a watchful eye out for any prey. The weak ones hide at the end of narrow streets, in the corners of houses that have crumbled, and no one will go near.Those who are a little stronger form groups and live in their territory. That is a world in which the strong eliminate the weak, and the weak eliminate the strong too. An easy-to-understand world where power speaks for itself. That is the slum.In such a dangerous slum, an old man entered the slum, unsteady on his feet, his body swaying.The people living in a relatively safe area on the border between the slum and the outer city were burning garbage in drums to keep warm, but they glanced at the old man.The old man\u2019s appearance came into view as they approached the flames.He was a shabby old man. He wore a hat with an unusually wide brim and a coat that was once a deep blue color but now looked black with dirt.His face was beardy, with a white beard extending down to his chin, giving him a dirty image. He appeared to be a poor man and did not seem to have anything of value. He must have one eye. One eye is closed and does not seem to open.However, his eyes, which were unusually sharp and shining, gave a sense of intimidation and awe to those who looked at him.The people surrounding the drum were various. From a thin middle-aged man to an old man with missing teeth and a young man with his face blackened with mud and dirt.They look at the old man and think he probably has no money.And then, they smile at him, their faces twisted into grimaces. He won\u2019t have anything of value. But that is a commoner\u2019s story. For the people in the slums, it is different.Each of them, with an iron pipe, a knife, or a club in his hand, smirks and laughs as he approaches the drunken old man.\u201cOh, old man. You look like you\u2019re in a good mood.\u201dThe man in the lead calls out, pitter-pattering a rusty iron pipe with his hand as he does so. The others, grinning and sneering, surround the old man.\u201cHmm? I, who look like this, am in a good mood. That\u2019s an interesting thing to say.\u201dThe one-eyed eyes old man look at the men surrounding him with amusement. One of the men in the circle bursts out laughing at the lack of sense of urgency in his demeanor.\u201cIs this your first time here? Well then, let me tell you something. In this slum, even a look like yours is good business. Leave your hat, coat, and shoes. And you\u2019ve got booze, booze. Leave that, too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s your toll to get into this slum.\u201d\u201cYou may look like you\u2019ve fallen on hard times, but this slum is worth a lot more than the commoners.\u201dEven if you don\u2019t have money, you have clothes. In addition to clothes, there are shoes. They could sell the leather shoes for a lot of money if they remove mud. Even if he has no wallet, if he has clothes, he can strip them off. Moreover, an old man like this would be easy, and the men would look at the old man in front of them with a glazed look as if he were their prey.\u201cI see, I see. If you starved. You\u2019ll strip an old man of his clothes, even in winter. You got a pretty good heart, don\u2019t you? No, you don\u2019t seem to be starving.\u201dThe old man looks at the man, touching his beard, impressed.\u201cShut up! Come on, take it off before we beat you to a pulp. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll mourn for your life!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a cold winter. I might die.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to hit the bonfire. We\u2019re kind.\u201dThe old man glared at the laughing, mocking people, and opened his mouth.\u201cMunin. Who are these people?\u201dThe old man mutters to no one. The people around him frown, wondering who he is talking to, and thinking it is the ramblings of a drunk, but then a high-pitched voice comes from the darkness.\u201c[Analysis complete]. These guys robbed the day before yesterday. They broke into an old woman\u2019s house, killed the old woman, and took her money.\u201dThe cawing voice belonged to a crow.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThere it is!\u201dScurrying around, the men spot a crow perched on a telephone pole. The crow was almost invisible in the darkness, but only its crimson-red eyes were visible.\u201cIs that a crow talking?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dThe old man fixes the tilt of the broad-brimmed hat he is wearing as he looks at the startled and fussing men.\u201cHm. Is that all you got?\u201d\u201cBad guys ABCDEF, these guys are killing many innocent people. They are killers.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s not a problem then.\u201dThe old man is not surprised that the raven can speak and answers with the attitude that it\u2019s only natural.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s a familiar, you\u2019re a magician, huh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Slums And Drunks-???\u2019s POV-Realizing the identity of the crow, the men feel a sense of danger. But they didn\u2019t run away. The old man doesn\u2019t wear Magic Armor, and he\u2019s drunk. They thought he was not much of a magician. After all, he had fallen into the slums. It must be shoddy.\u201cThen what are you going to do? Are you going to run away?\u201dThe old man asks in a sharp voice that doesn\u2019t sound like a drunk. But the men are convinced that\u2019s a bluff. He was bluffing. It\u2019s a sham. The old man only has a speaking raven.The man looks at his friends, who are approaching behind the old man, and smirks.\u201cNo, I just thought it would be nice if you had a magic tool!\u201dThe man facing the old man shouts to draw attention to himself. In time with his loud voice, his companion pounces on the old man, raising an iron pipe from behind him.\u201cReally?\u201dJust one word. The old man mutters boringly, and the man swings his iron pipe on the old man\u2019s head. There was a gulp and a bone-crushing sound, and he would fall. His companions began to wonder what they would do with their share.Clang!Then the men heard a dull bone-crushing sound, and the one that fell was the one that swung the iron pipe down. The blow caused him to wobble and fall to the ground, jerking and twitching. Blood sloshed from his head and became a pool of blood.\u201cHey, what the hell, man!\u201d\u201cGet him!\u201dThe rest of the group didn\u2019t understand what had happened, but they knew the old man had done something, and they all pounced on him at once.The men clubbed him, stabbed him with knives, and tried to kill him. The old man saw what they did. But he was not in a hurry. He just stood there.\u201cGah!\u201d\u201cGghh!\u201d\u201cHuURTs!\u201dThe men thought the old man would die. But he does not receive a single wound, and the attacking men groan in pain and roll to the ground.One man had his head caved in. The others were bleeding from their torsos. The men\u2019s attacks get repelled by something.[Material Reflection].\u201cPhysical attacks are always reflected once. You should have made it a check attack.\u201dThe old man looked down at the fallen men with a cold voice. The leader, who\u2019s watching them without attacking, pales and looks at the old man as if he were a monster.\u201cMagician! Why, what\u2019s a magician doing here!\u201d\u201cHmm, that\u2019s for several reasons. Anyway, I have a question I\u2019d like to ask you. Is that alright?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, anything you want to ask!\u201dThe old man is a magician. A strong wizard who uses solid magic, the leader understood, shaking his body.The old man stroked his white beard and squinted. He opens his mouth as if he were rolling a pebble, not caring about the fallen men.\u201cThere\u2019s a dungeon in this slum, isn\u2019t there? A dungeon that you secretly manage. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cD, dungeon? Was the dungeon your goal? But that place is bad. Even in the slums, A group of people with magicians own the dungeon.\u201dThe man is a member of the organization that manages the dungeon. The man resents that. He\u2019s a lowly underling, though. He never imagined the old man would ask him for pinpoint, secret information. Had the old man targeted him from the start?\u201cAs I thought, the young lady was right. There was a dungeon. Then tell me where it is.\u201dThe old man asks, his tone commanding and intimidating. The man shakily pulls out a knife from his pocket and throws it at the old man.\u201cI won\u2019t tell you! I\u2019ll kill you, gah.\u201dThe knife seems to have stabbed the old man, but ripples appear in front of the old man\u2019s body, and fresh blood flows from the man\u2019s shoulder. Seeing the man holding his shoulder, crouching, and screaming in pain, the old man snorted in boredom.\u201cEither you didn\u2019t hear me, or you don\u2019t have a good memory. Either way, tell me where it is.\u201d\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake! If I tell you, I\u2019ll lose my life!\u201d\u201cThen you will die here.\u201dThe old man told the desperate, resisting man. The ruthless voice made him realize that he meant it.\u201cWow, okay. Just don\u2019t say I tell it to you! There\u2019s a dungeon hidden in one of the warehouses there.\u201d\u201cHmm, thanks.\u201dSatisfied with his answer, the old man produced a bottle of wine from somewhere, slurped it down, and disappeared into the darkness.\u201cOh, I\u2019m survived\u2026\u201dThe man, preparing himself to die, looked around in relief. His friends are lying on the ground, badly injured. At this rate, they might die.\u201cHeh, heh. I can\u2019t help it. No hard feelings, guys?\u201dHe picks up the iron pipe lying around and smiles. He\u2019ll put the finishing touches on his friends and retrieve the gold these guys are hiding.The weak will get eliminated. The wounded will die. That is the rule in this slum.The man who held his shoulder and tried to kill his nearest companion made the wrong choice. He should have run away.\u201cGurururururru.\u201dTwo wolves had appeared, slinking out of the darkness. They were massive wolves. The wolves are the size of tigers. They had the eyes of beasts that were aiming at the men.\u201cHey, why is there a dog here? Hiiiyyy, wait, wait.\u201dThat line was the last thing the man spoke.Screams echoed through the air, and the sound of chewing could be heard, but soon the sound faded into the darkness of the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

More Friends!-Miu\u2019s POV-Darkness reigns in the slums. The old man wanders around there, drunk. Occasionally, someone tries to attack him, but they all bounce off his first blow and he crumples to the ground.When an enemy attacks, [Material Reflect] is instantly placed in front of the attacking enemy.It\u2019s automatically put up only once at the beginning of the battle. [Material Reflect] is a magic that causes all enemies to have their attacks reflected only once when they attack physically. It was not so good in the game, but it\u2019s useful in real life.\u201cAegis Crown, you\u2019re showing the effect as expected, yay!\u201dFrom the space comes the voice of a pretty girl. However, her tone is rough.\u201cA sacred artifact is a mysterious thing. That\u2019s an interesting divine artifact.\u201dThe old man, scratching his head and not wondering when he hears the voice, lights up his ship\u2019s eyes with the light of wisdom.\u201cAlso, the effect of the young lady\u2019s [Equipment Effect Off] is interesting.\u201d\u201cBecause if Odin dressed as a samurai, it would ruin the atmosphere, wouldn\u2019t it? [Equipment Effect Off] is useful because it transfers the effect to Odin\u2019s equipment. People won\u2019t know you\u2019re wearing the Aegis Crown.\u201dThe space distorts, and a girl on an eight-legged horse appears. Her robes and hood conceal her figure.Whoever she is, it\u2019s the beautiful girl Miu, you know. Don\u2019t tell my parents I\u2019m out at night. They\u2019ll be sad to hear that I\u2019ve become a delinquent.Oops, [Hide II].\u201dI\u2019m going to [Hide] if I\u2019m not careful. The figure disappeared with Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse as if melting into space. It dissolves after a certain number of steps. That\u2019s [Hide II].\u201cHmm, God\u2019s power is incredible. I think I\u2019m looking into the abyss now.\u201d\u201cI choose not to think about it. It\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s suitable. As long as it\u2019s usable, it\u2019s fine.\u201dOld man Odin is curious about [Aegis Crown] and [Equipment Effects Off] settings. If anything, he\u2019s more interested in [Equipment Effects Off]. Well, it\u2019s a mysterious game specification. I can see that.In the game, when you change the equipment, the character\u2019s appearance changes to that of the person wearing their equipment. But some players don\u2019t like that because it ruins their image, which is why there was [Equipment Effect Off]. With this, the character\u2019s appearance does not change even if they change equipment.It\u2019s intended for fans who don\u2019t like it when a character in a novel wears a loincloth. When used in reality, the skill\u2019s performance gets transferred to Odin\u2019s hat. I have no idea how its looks. When I unequip it, it reverts to [Aegis Crown].By the way, I won\u2019t use panties. I don\u2019t plan to use it because only gentlemen will be pleased.I was pleasantly surprised when I found this setting. Even though I\u2019m wearing iron armor, it looks like I\u2019m in a robe. You can\u2019t turn off effects on weapons, so even though you\u2019ve equipped a longsword, it doesn\u2019t look like a dagger.Odin wonders about this specification and is trying to research it. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but I want to use it. I press the switch, and the game starts up. That\u2019s all I need.Hearing me say that, Odin laughs. It\u2019s Odin, the Great Mage. He\u2019s the most famous god in Norse mythology. But Odin is a magician who calls himself a creator god because they allowed him to do that. He is indeed a god, but Odin is not his real name. What would you say his real name is?Odin is an old man who seeks wisdom and even gives up his life.By the way, he\u2019s my companion. He\u2019s an old man who I can befriend by praying to the Norse god statue in [My Room].To be more precise, he\u2019s one of the 500 yen Norse Gods set. That is, he is a companion I can get for a fee.In order not to destroy the novel\u2019s image, the main characters level\u2019s in the game version of The Night of Magica are fixed according to the progress of the story. But this doesn\u2019t help them defeat backstage bosses or conquer dungeons of extreme difficulty. I don\u2019t want the protagonists, who are ultimately fixed at level 70, even if they have cheat skills.So what to do is recruit random companions at the adventurer\u2019s bar, but I guess it was to force the main characters to use it. The main character has poor basic abilities. The more you level up, the more different they will be from the main characters. The only other person with higher basic abilities was the player characters. It\u2019s a common thing in games.So I cried about paying to lift the level limit, raised my level all over the place, and beat the game solo.But after a while, the management company must have felt good about the fact that the game was selling well. These days, turn-based RPGs have to be well-known to sell well.So, they released a set of companions as a chargeable item. Their basic abilities are high, and although they have fixed jobs, their unique skills are also strong. If anything, they were stronger than the novel\u2019s main characters.What\u2019s more, they saved me the trouble of leveling up, and the level was dependent on the player character\u2019s level. I had to buy it. The management company, you\u2019re too cunning.The companions I get are various, but they\u2019re in [My Room]. Was the setting to summon them from the other world? No. Was it to give a body to the shadow of gods to use? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter either way.I guess the management set the came so players could only summon companions from level 15, because of the game balance breaker.That is Odin, this one-eyed old man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cheat, cheat. Isn\u2019t it too much of a cheat for a paid character? By the way, [Grand Mage] is a composite job.I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t help I\u2019m talking like a lady. Even at level 15, this performance is unbeatable. The management company\u2019s shallow thinking is that by limiting the level, he wouldn\u2019t break the game balance even for players who are just starting in the game.It is true that with a low MP, the magic people can use in combined jobs, such as Great Magic, people can\u2019t use because it consumes too much. However, since I somehow obtained the [Aegis Crown] this time, there is no problem.Awakening event for [Aegis Crown]? It awakens when I spend 100 MP. I\u2019m not The Night of Magical\u2019s main character. I am a game player character. I could awaken by using the \u201cUse\u201d command. Odin\u2019s maximum MP was somehow over 100. There is no such thing as an awakening event. Well, in the original story, the enemy awakens it.[Aegis Crown]\u2019s performance increases MP and magic power by 200. In addition, it automatically uses [Material Reflect] at the start of the battle. Plus other performances, but that\u2019s enough for now.With this MP, Odin can do a couple of battles. In addition to that, the crow Munin can analyze the enemy. [Analysis] is the ability to read the enemy\u2019s attributes and flavor text.With Geri and Freki, the wolves that attack automatically, Odin is the strongest character I can have in my pack. That\u2019s what I think.If you ask me only twice, I will tell you those two times is a must. It\u2019s also possible to save and have MP only about 6 times. Still, he is a usable old man if I use him right.He\u2019s a game-balance breaker. That\u2019s Odin, the paid warrior. Yeah, the name is not cool.Surprisingly, this old man had an ego, just like in the game. There was a [Talk to party companion] command in the game, and he talked a lot.Now he\u2019s a magic geek and a drunken old man who likes to drink. His personality is worse than in the game, but I like him because he\u2019s human. He respects me as a lady for some reason, though. Well, it\u2019s better than being hostile.I have the game on auto, so Odin is acting of his own free will. I don\u2019t plan to use [Let me order you] because it would delay my actions by more than a beat in real life.I have also confirmed that if I\u2019m in a party, no matter how far away I am, I can talk to my companion by the thought if I choose [Talk to my friends].At long last, I have a companion I can trust, someone who knows some of my secrets.And now I was with Odin, looking for a dungeon in the slums. This\u2019s because I want to level up my level secretly.I\u2019m a little sleepy and doze off, but I\u2019ll do my best. I\u2019ve got [Hunter I] as my new sub job. The sub job allows me to use half of my unique skills, and I can raise my proficiency to 4.I\u2019m going to master [Thief] and [Hunter]. That\u2019s probably the fastest route to growth.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s about time I told you where to go.\u201d\u201cOdin never takes a wrong turn, does he?\u201d\u201cWell, I have Munin.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re giving the flavor text performance?\u201dOdin\u2019s flavor text says that the raven\u2019s Munin collects information about the world, but does it have a piece of that performance? It\u2019s a crow like a handy GPS. I want one too; he has two of them, so give me one.\u201cPutting aside Munin, is that what you call a dungeon?\u201d \u201cYeah. But something\u2019s not right?\u201dWith ice-blue eyes, I looked at where the dungeon was said to be and saw that it was a kamaboko-shaped warehouse. However, there are many guards with assault rifles on their backs. They are on very high alert.I could tell some of them were magicians because of their colorful hair.\u201cBut what is that?\u201dWe see children with ropes around their necks being carried to the warehouse-like luggage. About five people staggered into the warehouse in dirty clothes.\u201cI heard that dungeons are a source of money to earn money. There\u2019s a reason why people do things like that from ancient times.\u201dWhile rubbing his chin, Odin is calm when it\u2019s a familiar sight.\u201cThe Night of Magic is supposed to be a modern fantasy genre. That kind of thing is high fantasy. But, well, let\u2019s see if we can help.\u201dEither way, we know what we\u2019re going to do.

Modern-day Slavery-???\u2019s POV-Dungeons are both a disaster and a bounty. Dungeons created many monsters and killed many humans. Disaster is the perfect name for them.But dungeons are also a bountiful thing.Why is that? There are several reasons.The first one is each country is busy dealing with dungeons, and it\u2019s hard to get into a full-scale war. In modern times, if there is a full-scale war, the number of dungeons will continue to increase, and many monsters will be wandering around, making it uninhabitable, or causing damage, and people need to exterminate them.In the past, even if they aimed to unify the continent, it would still be a battle with swords and magic. It was like a proxy war in which a few magicians clashed with each other.However, after the Industrial Revolution, ordinary people also had guns and used them on the battlefield. After the First World War, in which many people die, and many monsters took over a large area as if to shoot at the vacuum, which caused enormous losses, humans realized the folly of all-out warfare against each other.And so, although it\u2019s not peaceful, it\u2019s the old world again. The war ended in a proxy war between magicians, and it came to an end with as little damage as possible.Second, the domination of the magicians by the presence of monsters. That\u2019s because people are less likely to fight each other in vain within their own country, which means that policies are less likely to be changed every time there is a change of government, etc. At least we no longer have a policy that changes from one administration to the next every year. I don\u2019t know if that is good or bad. But for now, the scales are tilted in the right direction.The third is, I don\u2019t have to tell you, the materials from monsters. Magic stones, in particular, are utilized as a universal energy source. Electricity, gas, water, et cetera et cetera. From small machines to large heavy machinery. From small houses to skyscrapers aiming for great heights.The same goes for materials from monsters. When mixed with cement, it increases hardness. When sprinkled on fields, it eliminates crop failure. There are special monster wings that prevent airplanes from crashing, monster scales that reduce water resistance and speed up travel when navigating the seaways, and so on.The world has seen many monsters kill many people. However, more than that, the existence of dungeons, the power, and monster\u2019s materials, and the dungeons\u2019 existence enhance the world\u2019s prosperity.The Japanese Magic Empire is also enjoying this prosperity, as evidenced by its population of 200 million people. Many children are being born, and it is still growing. There are no abandoned villages and no aging society. That\u2019s because more children are being born.And the stronger the light of prosperity, the darker the shadow, and the more it emits a rotten smell like a bottomless swamp.That shadow is like a group of slumlords managing a dungeon secretly from the country.\u201cOra, hurry up and walk. Come on!\u201dInside a kamaboko-shaped warehouse, a middle-aged man was holding a chain and yelling. The people he is yelling at are children from 12 to about 5. They were all different ages, but they were all receiving the same treatment.They were dressed in dirty, frayed, holey rags that could hardly be called old clothes, and wearing iron collars with chains attached, which the men pulled on them.He chirruped and chirped the half-rusted chains, yelling at them to scare them. I watched the children huddle and shudder, their grins and mouths twisted in amusement.Occasionally, he deliberately yanks on the chains to which he is tethered, and then he watches the children fall over, relieving his daily frustration. He was a man of bad character.\u201cOh, you guys are oranges. You must get your customers to buy them before they rot themselves.\u201dHe takes them to the dungeon\u2019s entrance of the dungeon, which opens raggedly, and the man starts talking rapidly, with a serious look on his face. His friends around him smirked and laughed, some of them wildly, saying he was doing it again.The children stare in horror at what the man will say. The man feels superior when the children\u2019s attention is on him, and he opens his mouth, acting all pompous.\u201cFirst, let me tell you where you stand. You are adventurers. You are the elite who were able to become adventurers at your age. You have become the most prestigious adventurers in the adventurers\u2019 guild that we run.\u201dOf course, it was not an adventurers\u2019 guild, but as the man said this, he tapped his chain on the floor.\u201cOla, you must be happy! Clap, clap!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cYes, clap\u2026\u201d\u201cYah!\u201dSeeing the horrified look on the man\u2019s face, the children clap in a panic, almost crying. The man sniffs in a bored manner as the sparse applause starts to fall.\u201cYou, glorious adventurers, will now enter the dungeon. Here are your weapons.\u201dAt the man\u2019s eye contact, his men bring belts to the children. They began to tie the belts around the children\u2019s waists.\u201cOh, um, what\u2019s this?\u201dThe oldest boy raises his hand and asks with fear in his voice. The man does not take offense at the question. But grins and raises his index finger.\u201cThat\u2019s the poison of the deadly Venom Viper. You guys should use that poison to defeat the mithril eaters in the depths of this dungeon.\u201dWith a dubious face, the boy asks the man who pretended to act one by one. He\u2019s attached to his waist, and the stinger looks like he can\u2019t remove it. Even if he throws it, the belt is too tight.But the boy\u2019s question is answered in the worst possible way.\u201cYou guys can eat it. If it\u2019s from inside your body, it can damage the mithril eater. When you get eaten by mithril eaters, you still attack it. That\u2019s the strategy.\u201d\u201cEh, \u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe boys did not understand what the man was saying. But when they saw the man\u2019s smirking, ugly face, they realized he was not joking, and their faces paled.\u201cOh no! We\u2019re going to die!\u201d\u201cI bet we\u2019ll die!\u201d\u201cOuch!\u201dThe boy tries to approach the man, but he is kicked away like a soccer ball and rolls over the concrete floor.The man laughs it off and continues his story.\u201cSo, back to what I was saying earlier. If you want to survive, you have to be bought by customers. It\u2019s going to be rotten citrus, you know. Do you know what you need to do to get out of this?\u201dLooking over at the children, the man snickers and tells them the worst way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Modern-day Slavery-???\u2019s POV-\u201cSacrifice the others. Our mana is not infinite. If we kill a certain number of them, we will return. That way, we would spare the survivors.\u201dThe man tells the children, who are still young enough about the devil\u2019s choice. There was no guilt on his face, only amusement.Of course, it was a lie. The men do not plan to return until they have used up all the children. They are eager to see the look on the children\u2019s faces when they realize that they have nothing left but despair at the end of their ugly struggle.He was a man of bad characters, like the devil himself. As if to drive home the point, the man kept repeating.\u201cWhat is certain is that you will awaken to mana. Awaken to mana and defeat the monsters with a single blow! Then you will be one of us! I have awakened to mana, defeated the monsters with a single blow, and am now the chief of this place. I don\u2019t have to worry about money or women. You guys can do the same.\u201dHe says this to give the children hope, but it is a lie. The man came from a noble family and was disowned by his parents for his debauchery, but he was still a magician. With his power, he is making his way into this slum.He also knows the children in front of him don\u2019t have the chance to awaken their mana. The children are genuine commoners, acquired from the poor through loans and purchases. The adults are too big to be swallowed whole by the mithril eaters.The man has a good laugh at the children\u2019s foolish struggle to awaken their mana until they were about to be swallowed whole by the mithril eaters.\u201cOh, aniki. I feel a little sorry for you. At least don\u2019t give them any hope.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dThe man waved his hand lightly with a bored look as his younger brother interrupted him, feeling sorry for him.[Storm Wind Blade]\u201cGyaa!\u201dSeveral blades of materialized wind are released from his waved arm, becoming huge and transforming like the blade of a guillotine. The blades easily sliced the body of the surprised younger brother and turned him into a piece of meat on the floor, rolling him to death. Those without magical power have no resistance and can be easily cut. The younger brother showed proof of this with his death.\u201cWho the hell do you think you are, interrupting my fun? What! You talk nonsense. You\u2019re making me feel funny.\u201dThe head of the younger brother rolled off, and a large amount of blood flowed from the piece of meat, causing a puddle of blood to spread out. The man not bothered by the sight of the blood kicked the head away with a look of abhorrence.The man\u2019s men no longer laugh and keep their mouths shut. The other magicians, too, stand speechless at the insane behavior.The children are trembling, their faces no longer pale. They were shaking with fear, and it was doubtful if they could walk.The man sees the situation and smiles. Being feared like this, he thought, if you have the ability. You should be treated well by your superiors.In the underworld, you should keep a powerful and dangerous man in your pocket. The man had no intention of ending up as a dungeon manager.So, for all practical purposes, he would beat up the children and show them his strength. A brother without magic power is worthless. He could use him to score points for himself.What is needed is a magician. To rise to the top, he wasn\u2019t serious but was trying to do so through madness and death.Above all, it was fun. The man laughs, showing his face of madness, saying that this sense of enjoyment is incomparable to anything else.\u201cWell, you guys go in as elite adventurers. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll protect you until the mithril eaters show up. The rest depends on your luck and strength.\u201dSome children curled up in a ball, unable to move out of fear, but the man pulled with all his might on the chain without concern. The children are being dragged along by the man\u2019s reinforced arm strength.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. The future is here, and you can get rich from here. The path of your dreams awaits you. Go ahead with joy.\u201dLaughing at the children\u2019s cries, which he thought were a pleasant song, the man turned to step into the dungeon\u2019s entrance and said to the children.\u201cYou go!\u201dHe received a hard blow on his back and rolled on the floor as if he were going to be blown away.\u201cW-What? What happened? What the hell is this?\u201dThe man stands up, hurriedly enduring the pain, and there\u2019s a man in a robe with their kicking leg still out. Their face was obscured by a hood, a cloth mask, and sunglasses, but they\u2019re as small as a child.\u201cWhat is it? I\u2019ve never seen a guy with such a rotten nature.\u201dA voice trembling with anger, like the ringing of a beautiful bell, could be recognized as a girl\u2019s voice. The girl\u2019s shaking with anger and exuding an air of her anger.\u201cOh, dear. Aren\u2019t you a bit quick-tempered?\u201dBeside her, a shabby old man appeared before he knew it, and laughed funnily.\u201cYou\u2019re from another territory, aren\u2019t you? You know us, don\u2019t you?\u201dThese two were magicians, and the man, wary, called up mana from within his body and circulated it through his clothes. The mana flows through the clothes, transforming them into chainmail and giving them a pale aura of mana.\u201cI don\u2019t know. What are you? Are you slumlords?\u201d\u201cHuh! If it\u2019s a bullet, you probably don\u2019t know about it. We\u2019re Chimera! We\u2019re the group that controls this area and shuts up crying children! I\u2019m Baphomet!\u201d\u201cChimera, huh? Then it\u2019s a monster. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fun. Let\u2019s try it!\u201dThe man who calls himself Baphomet activates his mana to see if he can make a difference.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chimera Extermination-Miu\u2019s POV-Miu glares at her opponent, shaking her head in anger. It seems to be a group called Chimera. Even though it\u2019s a slum, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a half-baked organization because it has magicians.I try not to look like me, but I still have to be careful. But that doesn\u2019t calm my anger.\u201cI\u2019ll exterminate anyone who isn\u2019t here, too.\u201dIt\u2019s me, Miu-chan the pest exterminator. I\u2019m going to exterminate them all. My gut is churning, and wobbly. Maximum firepower, destroy all the bad guys. I can\u2019t let those who feed on children live.Seeing Miu trembling with anger, Baphomet, on the contrary, regains his composure. There are two opponents. Even if they are magicians, they\u2019re not using magic armor because of their appearance. He has an overwhelming advantage over them.\u201cIt seems you came to help us with a green idea, but can you beat this number of people? Can you beat this [Magic Armor Sylph Type 22]?\u201dThe man who calls himself Magician bumps up and shows the latest model of mass-produced light armor, the Sylph Type 22. Without magic armor, even a magician would be no match for him.Miu looks around her, and she ponders. Close to 30 people. There are about three magicians.At first, I was going to use [Hide II] to infiltrate and see how things went. My [Hide II] can hide the whole party, of course. Odin refused, but if he didn\u2019t refuse. It would be easy to get inside. You\u2019d have to be an estimated 30 levels or higher to see through my [Hide].But I couldn\u2019t stand the way they treated the kids.\u201cFor the first time in a long time, I felt like I was in The Night of Magic. Damn it.\u201dThat\u2019s when I realized how different it was from my previous life. That\u2019s where the common sense of reality merges with the common sense of fiction. The man using children as bait to defeat the mithril eaters? Yeah, I know. It\u2019s a dark pattern of the dreaded template.In my previous life, if someone did something like this daily, even in the slums of some country, there would surely be an uproar. Especially here in Japan, right?But the reality in this world of the magical night is a little different. The behavior of the wicked sometimes sticks out. [Yggdrasil] and this scoundrel are just two examples.The Night of Magic is a popular novel. It\u2019s an old classic. The point is that it\u2019s old. There are battles, romantic comedies, and a dark atmosphere.A lot of people had a hard time with the original. The heroine is often helped out by opportunism. But there were mob people who looked like heroine candidates who would normally die early.There were. Those people almost always die. So, although The Night of Magic was a popular novel that was made into an anime and then into a game, many events got cut. That\u2019s why there are discrepancies if you\u2019re me, who got bored with the novel halfway through.The original novel\u2019s author knew that the merciless deaths would be moving, cruel, and popular. It was impossible for the author, who is always thinking about popularity, not to draw such a delicious situation.The effect of this is the situation is before me. They\u2019re scumbags in the slums who use children as fodder for their monsters and collect materials.It happened in the game, too. When you receive an event, the client tells you that \u201cthese people get sacrificed,\u201d they briefly show a scene with a pile of corpses, and the hero\u2019s face turns bitter, saying that it\u2019s terrible.The children playing with those corpses are right in front of me. I have to save them, don\u2019t we? We\u2019re the same \u2018Mob\u2019. Let\u2019s change the corpse role.Miu bared her double teeth like a wild beast, and she muttered quietly.[Fight]My physical ability jumps up by selecting the [Fight] command. My body is filled with mana, transforming me from a mere girl into a powerful warrior.\u201cI\u2019ll show you how stupid you are to come here without any magic armor!\u3000Mine is the latest model, you know!\u201dWind erupts from the body of the man who calls himself Baphomet, and the armor of the [Magic Armor Sylph Type 22] deployed by his mana power. The wizards surrounding us also deployed their \u201cMagic Armor,\u201d which seemed to have been soiled and used up, and readied their weapons. The man in front of me has a rapier. The other two have wands.And there are a lot of hoodlums.\u201cHow many loans did you get? You\u2019re going to hell in loan hell!\u201dIt looks brand new and shiny, it looks like he just bought it, but I\u2019m going to thrash it away soon. I will not forgive you.\u201cOdin! Defeat the mooks!\u201d\u201cMm, okay.\u201dAt my words, Odin raises one hand, his one eye glowing with blue ghostly light, and casts a spell.[Heroic Spirit Sorting].Odin instantly draws a white, glowing magic circle on the palm of his hand, and emits a flash of light. The enemy squints in alarm at the dazzling light.\u201cI\u2019m blinded! You guys, don\u2019t let them get away!\u201dBaphomet utters a word of warning and alerts his men. He thought his men would answer. I had expected it.But the sound of a thud followed by a fall echoes through the air, a dubious look, a flash of light stops, and the goat-head opens his eyes.Then, his eyes widen in surprise.\u201cHey! Why the hell are you guys sleeping!\u201dAll his men, except the magicians, were lying on the floor. They all collapsed on their stomachs.\u201cA [Sleep]! You\u2019re a master of abnormal magic if you can use it over such a wide area!\u201dStaring at Odin, who had used magic, Baphomet figured from the range that the old man was a user of abnormal status magic. He\u2019s quite a nuisance if he is abnormal status magic user. Even with magic armor on, you can take some terrible damage.But Odin stroked his white beard and answered in a bored tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chimera Extermination-Miu\u2019s POV-\u201cNo, they\u2019re all dead.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dBaphomet\u2019s brain refused to comprehend that short line. What did the old man say?\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? Then I\u2019ll say it. He is dead. It seems they couldn\u2019t stand my sorting.\u201d\u201cDead? Did you kill them?\u201d\u201cYes. These men get tested to become Heroic Spirits. They get tested to become the spirits of Valhalla, and they failed. I am still weak. You are still alive.\u201dBaphomet stared at Odin\u2019s face in disbelief. There were more than 30 men around him. There were even guards. But now silence reigned over the world.\u201cI won\u2019t believe it! You\u2019re bluffing! You guys, take them down!\u201dUnknowingly intimidated by the sight of the one-eyed Odin, Baphomet retreated and gave instructions to the surviving magicians.But Miu and the others\u2019 turn was not over.[Rapid Thrust]\u201cGah!\u201dBefore long, a small, robed human swings a dagger as if to dive in and leap off one magician\u2019s head. The magician, who is supposed to be protected by the powerful magic barrier of the Magic Armor, is unable to do anything and falls to the ground, his head knocked off.[Twin Fang]Two wolves attack another magician like the wind. When the fangs drew a light path, it tore off his neck and lightly descended to the floor. Blood trickles down from the wolf\u2019s mouth.\u201cWell, there\u2019s a magic barrier.\u201dThey have a magical barrier that repels even bullets. The magician fell, holding his neck, unable to believe that the fangs of a mere wolf, even though it has a body as big as a tiger, could break through the barrier.\u201cHmm, he\u2019s a level 8 magician, even equipped with magic armor. He\u2019s just like a small fish.\u201dMiu was relieved to see her fighting ability was just as good as in the game. The magicians were level 8 and 9. Geri and Freki are wolves that can fight on equal terms with enemies equipped with magic armor. Magic barriers are merely a defensive value.My surprise attack from [Hide II] was like in the game. With [Hide II], enemies who don\u2019t notice me hiding receive a special blow from my attack.As a special ability, [Thief II] attacks from [Hide II], deal double damage to the enemy. In addition, the martial art lineage of [Vital Point Thurst], greatly increases the chance of hitting a critical hit. I don\u2019t know the formula, but it does high damage.Thief has a slightly higher attack power than magicians. But, they\u2019re quite weak, and I can\u2019t use them as warriors, but they specialize in inflicting damage from [Hide]. The problem is that it takes one turn to hide, so it\u2019s the same as two attacks. I have to go for the critical blow. Because that attack penetrates the defenses of everyone except the holder of the special skill.The magicians we defeated were atrocious. They truly deserve to be the bad guys in The Night of Magic.When you choose to [fight[Baphomet appears][Evil magicians A and B appeared][A bunch of thugs showed up][Security cameras appeared]I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what was shown on the screen. Well, when you try to use children as bait, you\u2019re out. Sorry, but I\u2019m going to beat you just like in the game. You\u2019ll pay for your sins in hell.\u201cWhat the hell is going on? How can they break through the magic barrier if they\u2019re not using magic armor? What the hell is wrong with you people?\u201d\u201cMagic armor. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got it all wrong, but I\u2019ve got it on.\u201dI flutter the robe I\u2019m wearing and smile like a beast. A magic circle appeared on the surface of the robe for a moment and then disappeared immediately.\u201cHuh? What is that? Are you wearing old-fashioned equipment?\u201dBaphomet frowned in understanding. He realized that the clothes we were wearing were magical equipment. He probably thinks it\u2019s old-fashioned equipment before people made magic armor.He\u2019s sweating, but still staring at us, his will to fight increasing. He seems to have regained his composure.My equipment is [Thieves\u2019 Evasion Clothes]. Of course, I had equipment other than magic armor in the game. This is called unique equipment. It\u2019s level 10 Thief\u2019s equipment. It is a robe that increases the success rate of [Hide]. Odin\u2019s is a Sacred Treasure, so I don\u2019t need to explain it to you.It\u2019s unique equipment that I can make with [Magic Stone E30, Cloth Piece 20]. I had unique equipment on the list, even though I have to get the recipe. The knowledge system seems to have taken over the game.I secretly made it using two of my clothes. I only hope my mother doesn\u2019t notice. If she finds out, I will make an excuse that the cat bit me and ran away.\u201cWell, since you two are coming together, you have confidence in your strength. But, but this is where it starts!\u201dBaphomet pulls out his smartphone from his hip pocket and presses it down with a beep. I was wary that he would run away, but it seems that he is still very motivated.A container in the warehouse\u2019s corner begins to creak open, and something steps on the floor and quietly appears. There were five of them.\u201cWhat a waste, but I\u2019ll use it on you guys. You must know the horror of the Chimera! Kill them, [Magic Puppet Ogre Type 22]!\u201dThe goat-head laughs loudly. What emerged from the container was a mechanical giant. It must have been made from magic material. It was a robot with muscle fibers running around its mechanical body, a three-meter-tall metal giant.\u201cThis world is quite interesting. How could something called [Magic] be used to create a mechanical giant?\u201dOdin seems to be very interested in [Magic].\u201cJust as well, Odin. Let\u2019s go with the performance test.\u201d[Magic Machine]. It\u2019s a major system in the world. I wondering if I could do something about this. It\u2019s a game-like world.Even though I got surrounded by my enemies, Miu pulled out her double teeth and looked happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fighting Magic Machines[Magic Weapon Ogre Type 22\u2033.] I don\u2019t remember the name, but there were many of these things as small fry,\u201d Miu said, looking at the metal giant.They seemed hidden in containers. They must prepare it as their trump cards. It is a template development. Thank you very much.Its skin is a heavy-looking metallic skin, with pink muscle fibers and cables peeking out from its joints. Sharp horns like spearheads sprouted from its head, and in the hands of the three-meter-tall giant, a greatsword as thick as a steel plate. There are five of them. They are approaching us, their eyes made of crystal.Glowing red crystals cover each part of their bodies. They are magical weapons driven by the power of magic stones. There was no operating time in the game but in reality. It exists. I used [Examine] to confirm its strength.[Magic Doll Ogre Type 22, Level 26]It\u2019s quite strong. Magic stones are disposable, so they are much cheaper than summoning stones, but they only wear out more quickly, and their fighting power is high. I don\u2019t know how much it costs to move this thing.\u201cDo it. Ogre. [Kill those two].\u201dBaphomet\u2019s in a good mood and proudly gives the order to the Ogre. The magic weapon with the friendly-weapon identification device is very convenient.Baphomet is convinced of his victory. He sticks his index finger at us and smiles broadly, his face contorted.But magic weapons were in the game too. Of course, there are countermeasures. We\u2019ll do what we want to try.\u201cOdin!\u201d\u201cThis knowledge is embedded in my head. It reminds me of the time I gained magical knowledge at the Fountain of Mimir.\u201dOdin uses magic, turning his mouth covered with a crumpled white beard into a smile.[All Machine Control Machine Dominator \u2164][Dominated security cameras!][Ogre 22 Type A, E dominated!][Baphomet smartphones dominate!][Communications equipment dominate!]A silvery flash of light emanates from his hand. Two ogres are magic weapons, are hit by the light, and are stopped by purple electricity.\u201cOh, my phone!?\u201dBaphomet was surprised to see his phone covered in electric shocks and took it down.I was surprised to see the log. Oh my, is this what happens in real life?\u201cHmmm, [Defeat the Ogre].\u201dOdin is amused at his magic\u2019s result, strokes his white beard, and gives the order. Two mechanical ogres attack the other ogres, raising their greatswords.A clang and a metallic sound echo as the greatsword bites into the metal skin of the Ogre.\u201cHey, what are you doing!? Is it a glitch!?\u201dBaphomet\u2019s eyes peeled back in surprise as he saw Odin\u2019s controlled Ogre begin to attack the other Ogre. If I don\u2019t order them to counter it quickly, they\u2019ll take you down one-sidedly.Magic Weapons. Of course, counter-magic is in the game. Counter-magic has several types, like magic to dominate machines, confusion, and destroy parts. There\u2019s support magic that won\u2019t work against magic armor, but is much more effective against magic weapons. Most bosses\u2019 magic weapons are resistant, so I can\u2019t dominate them.The success rate of [Machine Domination] is extremely low. It is only natural since it made my enemies into my friend. Even Odin, with his Aegis Crown and high magical power, succeeded with only two.But that\u2019s not the point. I was interested in something else.Namely, machines that have essential powers in this modern fantasy but are much nastier than combat weapons and the like. Surveillance cameras and security systems. Communication devices.However, the reality-based [Machine Domination] was more effective than I had expected. I didn\u2019t expect it to dominate the security cameras, and I didn\u2019t expect it to dominate the communication equipment. The [Machine Domination] was designed to get fixed only when the enemy repaired it. Once I control all the weapons, the battle was over.In the game, they would have left the weapons as they were and moved on, but what would happen in real life? Perhaps all the equipment here is under Odin\u2019s control. Pssshhhh.Of course, in the novel, there was none of this magic. There were users of similar magic, but they were puppeteers who manipulated many of their magic puppets. You could say it was a game of original magic.There were hackers in the novels, but they usually broke into computers, not by magic. Someone in the world might use the same kind of magic, though.\u201cOdin. Don\u2019t leave us on the security cameras.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll turn it off.\u201dWe can order the machines under our control to turn them off. If I ask it to turn off, it will disappear on its own. Odin nodded as he watched the ogre battle with interest. I\u2019m asking you to do it.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!? [Broken no. 1 beat the no. 3!] dammit, what\u2019s going on?\u201dBaphomet is confused, but I no longer intend to explain. Odin joins the ogre fight, taking Geri and Freki with him. I\u2019ll leave that one to you.I guess he never imagined there was such magic in the world. He was in a hurry, as if he hadn\u2019t moved it in a long time, and thought there was a glitch. I know. Emergency systems are usually glitchy and don\u2019t work when you need them to. I\u2019ll have to keep this magic a secret.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s have a tie-breaker.\u201dI grinned like a little cat at Baphomet. He looks at me, bites his lip in frustration, and holds up his rapier.\u201cDamn!\u201dBaphomet clads himself in wind magic, rushes forward, and thrusts his rapier at me. The wind magic armor must have compensated for this. The dust around my feet floats in the wind as I step out, if it floats, and slides closer to me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s about the same level as the adventurers in my guard.\u201cCome at me!\u201dI also ready my dagger and attacked him. It\u2019s an Iron Dagger made from magic stone and leftover magic iron. It\u2019s stronger than copper.\u201cEat this!\u201dHe\u2019s using a rapier that specializes in stabbing attacks. Baphomet moves in for a quick jab and then delivers a series of blows.\u201cWhat!\u201dI repel multiple thrusts with my dagger. The rapier is close to me, and it makes a whistling sound, but just before the tip of the rapier hits me, I twist my body and hit it with my dagger to repel it.A metallic clanging sound is heard, and a fierce exchange of blows ensues.\u201cYou brat! How good you are!\u201d\u201cWell, thanks.\u201dBaphomet, probably intending to feint, looks surprised at my dagger arm and swings his rapier to the side.With a thump, I jumped back, ducking the attack and smiling.Inwardly, I thought about how the game\u2019s specifications would change in reality.In the game, if I chose to attack, the attack would hit each other with little or no misses. In reality, however, it was a battle. It seems that speed is the key, and the difference in skill determines whether or not the attack hits.I think it\u2019s thanks to my proficiency that I\u2019m good at manipulating daggers. In the game, special skills, magic, and physical abilities only increased, but as the name suggests, proficiency in dagger skills. Every time my job got higher, my skill improved without my permission.When I was practicing hard with a stuffed animal at home, I didn\u2019t understand how good am I. It\u2019s dangerous to train in the dungeon with Yamiyo, so I use a mace.But now I can feel it. I, who have never held a dagger before, could fight enemies calmly. In the game, proficiency in the real world increases the ability to manipulate weapons, which is the job\u2019s unique skill.It doesn\u2019t feel strange. I feel like I remembered it from the beginning. It is indeed the power of the game that resides in me. I don\u2019t know. My game power is not as cool as a dragon\u2019s crest or something like that.Baphomet and I both get more cuts from cutting each other. I, who specializes in speed, could keep up with him, who uses wind magic to boost his speed.\u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t feel any pain, do you?\u201dBaphomet, who had pierced my shoulder with his rapier and made a cut, was surprised. Of course, it hurts. I don\u2019t show it.I don\u2019t care if my shoulder is bleeding. I unleash the dagger without worrying about it.\u201cYou look like you\u2019re in pain.\u201dI enter Baphomet\u2019s bosom, which has shown a slight opening due to his agitation and slash at his torso with my dagger. The magic barrier blocked the attack, but my attack reached the Baphomet\u2019s skin and grazed it slightly.\u201cHURT!! You brat! How can you get past my magic barrier? It\u2019s the latest model!\u201dStartled by the pain, Baphomet moves more and more slowly. Probably only 1 damage. Don\u2019t be so upset.Baphomet. Though he has the advantage in a fight, he takes a big step backward as he flies with the wind on his legs. He\u2019s scared. He\u2019s pathetic.\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up with magic!\u201dHe turns his hand palm up and tries to use his magic with a devilish look on his face.\u201cDie!\u201d[Storm Wind Blade]As the magic circle is drawn in front of Baphomet\u2019s hand, several winds reverse, have physical mass and fly as blades. The small blades grew to like the guillotine blades a meter long and came at me.I inhale and use [Defend]. The blade of wind slices through my body, splattering fresh blood. It\u2019s a bad wind to cut a beautiful girl, Miu. I should have at least rolled up my skirt.\u201cWhat the!? Just a graze! That\u2019s ridiculous!\u201dIt\u2019s the magic that sliced my friends just now. He must have had a certain amount of confidence in it. He\u2019s staring at me with a shiver in his mouth.\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s hurt pretty bad. If I hadn\u2019t used [Defend]. I might have taken a lot of damage.\u201d[Get hit by Storm Wind Blade, Received 11 damage!]I was damaged even though I had no shield and used [Defend]. The [Defense] command cuts the enemy\u2019s attack by 1/3. If I have a shield, it\u2019s 1/6. If I had to take it, I would have lost more than half of my HP.\u201cWell then, I guess it\u2019s my turn.\u201dBaphomet\u2019s confused. There are a lot of gaps. And he shouldn\u2019t get spaced out with me.[Hide II]There\u2019s a difference in level, but it won\u2019t be a problem. My proficiency will close the gap.When using [Hide \u2161], Miu disappears as if blending into the air. She succeeded in \u2018hiding\u2019.\u201cHey! Disappeared? [Hiding]! Damn, where are you? Where are you?\u201dHe probably isn\u2019t equipped to see through the invisible. Baphomet looks around and makes an impatient face.It\u2019s because you need to keep your distance in front of [Thief]. Now it\u2019s my turn.Hiding in the space, Miu peeled her double teeth and grinned like a fierce animal aiming for its prey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Question Is Answered!Goat Head was getting impatient. He can\u2019t see the brat. Surrounded by an old man fighting Ogres, and shivering children fleeing to the warehouse\u2019s corner. He listens carefully to see if he can hear the brat\u2019s steps, but the sounds of the ogre fighting are too loud for him to hear the brat\u2019s steps.When he looks, he sees the old man defeated two Ogres. His Ogre was taken by the enemy and is damaged. But it is still strong. The other one must not last much longer.Sweat was pouring down his forehead in impatience to defeat the brat at least as soon as possible. His body is trembling slightly with fear.He has no idea how this happened. It was supposed to be the same routine as usual. Dive into the dungeon, defeat the monsters, and move on to the mithril eaters. The rest was supposed to be a simple task of using children as bait and defeating the poisoned mithril eaters.But all his men are killed, and he is in mortal danger. He\u2019s driven into a corner by just two magicians.One is a brat, the other a monster, but he fears the brat is a monster. The old man is terrifying because of his unheard-of magic, but the brat is even scarier.They don\u2019t get scared even when he hurts them with a rapier. A human being would get slowed down by the pain of even a graze wound. However, the brat did not waver after I gave them several cuts and shaved their shoulder.They\u2019re like a machine. It seemed to feel no pain. They acted calmly and without hesitation, and Goat Head\u2019s mind was filled with more fear than pain.The sound of his breathing was very noisy. He heard a crunching sound, turned around, and unleashed a wind spell.\u201cThere! Is it there? There!\u201dHe continues to fire blades of wind in the direction of the sound. Pieces of paper drifting get cut, and he shatters rolling buckets. But there is no response at all.It is as if the brat is unrecognizable. Fear slowly takes over. His eyes turn red, and he no longer cares what happens.\u201cI\u2019ve risen to Number 4! This kind of place! I don\u2019t want to die in a place like this!\u201dHe no longer thinks about the consumption of mana and unleashes it in a mess. If he uses this much magic, he can\u2019t fight the remaining old man.But Goat Head, confused by fear, did not care. His mind gets occupied with killing the brat. He did not think about the rest.[Vital Thrust]And just when he thought he heard the brat\u2019s words, his vision became unnatural. Somehow, his vision dropped to the ground, and there was a gurgling sound and a rush of pain.\u201cGo to hell and suffer for a long time in hell.\u201dGoat Head, whose head had been cut off, was lifeless when he heard the last lines that did not match the cute sound of the brat\u2019s voice.[Minor Heal III][Minor Heal III]Miu heals her wounded body. I took quite a bit of damage. I had less than 30% HP, so I was pretty close.A soft white light envelops me and restores me. Holes and cuts in the [Thief\u2019s Mask] are also covered.\u201cOh, it\u2019s fixed.\u201dMy equipment gets fixed, too. I poke at my clothes in surprise, but they are as good as new. I\u2019ve never seen this phenomenon before. When I used recovery magic on others, it never repaired their clothes. The same goes for their magic armor.\u201cIn the \u2026\u2026 game, my equipment has no durability.\u201dI see. Even if my equipment didn\u2019t, would game equipment be affected by recovery magic? It is indeed strange to equip iron armor and still take damage. Or iron armor that takes damage but doesn\u2019t break. In reality, it would look like this.\u201cBut this stands out tremendously. It goes beyond the boundaries of a recovery magician?\u201dI\u2019m going to change my job from a beautiful girl recovery magician Miu-chan to a Miu-chan who can fix anything. This might be bad if I don\u2019t keep it secret. I\u2019m afraid that the game specs will make everything my secret.When I tilted my head and was in trouble, I heard a gashan sound, and I saw the last ogre throwing sparks and falling.Geri and Freki are chewing on the ogre on top of the puffing smoke. You can\u2019t eat that, wolf.\u201cHmmm, mechanical dolls don\u2019t seem to be very smart. This one doesn\u2019t pose much of a threat unless it has an instructor behind it.\u201dOdin approaches me, looking bored, as he rearranges the direction of his winged hat. The ogres he dominated are covered in wounds, but not broken. Odin and the wolves must have gotten around just fine because there is not a single injury.I turn to Odin, thinking I need to study the different parts of the game or the game specs that have changed to match reality.With a bang, one of the unharmed ogres gets blown away. An ogre that rolls while scattering parts on the floor with gorongashan.Who are you breaking my toys? When I looked at the entrance with a sigh, some people entered.\u201cHey, that Goat Head guy, he\u2019s been killed.\u201d\u201cPfft, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable. He\u2019s the weakest among us.\u201dThe men wearing some elaborate magic armor nonchalantly entered the warehouse. The next group of nearly 20 magicians wearing second-hand magic armor followed behind them.\u201cHmm, only two of them. So you say you\u2019re good at your job.\u201d\u201cGood, you\u2019re killing everyone. They\u2019re worth killing.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope they\u2019re not small fry.\u201dSeriously, I sigh. A boss-like group appeared. Seeing me drop my shoulders dejectedly, the men giggled.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re surprised. This dungeon is our lifeline. If there\u2019s an attack, we\u2019re all supposed to gather.\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019re going to raid us, it\u2019s because they\u2019re confident in their skills.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little boring that there are only two of them.\u201dThe three look at us and tell us. Hey, do you practice those lines all the time? Every time someone like you appears in a novel or anime, I wonder, what is going on there?I look at him with a stony-eyed, disappointed look on my face, and the guy who seems to be the leader crosses his arms and tells me with a condescending look.\u201cYou didn\u2019t see it coming.\u201d\u201cIf you beg for your life, you might be saved.\u201d\u201cIf you are strong, try to resist to the end.\u201dLet\u2019s check it out.Lion Head level 28Dragon Head level 30Snake Head level 18I see, Chimera.

My Question Is Answered!\u201cAre you guys the rest of the Chimera bosses?\u201d\u201cYes. We are the Chimera. The head of the most powerful group.\u201d\u201cYou want to lick my shoe?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see what you can do.\u201dThe bosses look great. Especially you, Snake Head. You\u2019re the weakest, aren\u2019t you? Oh, well. Now I don\u2019t have to look for the Chimera.\u201cThen I give up.\u201dI shook my head and decided to give up.\u201cHmm, it\u2019s pathetic to give up on life so early.\u201dI\u2019m going to tell you something since you seem to have misunderstood.\u201cI mean, we should give up exploring the dungeon today.\u201dI can\u2019t save my MP. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cRisk your life!\u201dIgnoring the wondering bosses, I give a quick thumbs down to Odin. With a chuckle, Odin opens his hands and mutters.\u201cLet\u2019s see what the great magic is at its finest.\u201d[3 Consecutive Magic]Odin\u2019s hands shine dazzlingly with the light of mana. The unique skill of Great Magic [3 Consecutive Magic] uses three consecutive magic spells in one turn. Odin unleashes three consecutive Magician IV spells.And I\u2019ve reached level 19.I did it. I\u2019ve raised my level, Mii-chan.As I watch the bosses turn to ash and fly away in the wind, I tilt my head back. I have a few questions.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dOdin, who is disassembling the wreckage of the ogre and checking it out, asks, seeing me cocking my head cutely.\u201cOh, that\u2019s weird.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by weird?\u201dOld man Odin reacted to the word strange. He\u2019s an old man who is always curious.\u201cNo, that\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t feel guilty, even though I\u2019ve committed so many murders.\u201dI killed nearly 50 people. Isn\u2019t that strange?\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re a bad guy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo, even bad guys would feel a little guilty after killing this many people, right?\u201dIn my previous life, I was an ordinary old man. In this world, I\u2019m a good girl, Miu-chan, right? Putting aside the monsters, when I saw the corpse lying around, I thought it was strange that I murdered humans, and that my heart was completely unshakable.\u201cHmm., I, God, don\u2019t know, but how does it feel?\u201d\u201cHmm, this\u2026 it\u2019s just exhilarating. That\u2019s that. That\u2019s it!\u201dI\u2019m about to explain what I feel when I realize it.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAll I feel is the exhilaration of completing an event! Yes, eh, seriously?\u201dI know that feeling now. I had a feeling of exhilaration after defeating a bad guy. It\u2019s the feeling I get when you clear an event in a video game.\u201cGah. I feel like I\u2019m in a game.\u201dShock. I\u2019m shocked that I\u2019m not shocked at all. Gagaaan.Seeing Miu\u2019s mouth open and her body frozen in shock, Odin chuckles as he holds the Ogre parts in his hand.\u201cGame. Hmm, the feeling of enjoying a game on the board? I suppose so.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cMm. You are a god. You don\u2019t realize it, but you are a god. Just like us. A god could kill a human being and not care?\u201d\u201cGagaan. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t deny it.\u201dGah! Miu stiffened. My body is indeed a game-specific body. I couldn\u2019t deny it. I see. Was the game player a god? The game specifications indeed look like an act of God.Even in battle, I didn\u2019t feel fear, and even when I was wounded, I didn\u2019t flinch or hesitate. And this event was similar to an ordinary event in games.It\u2019s like clearing the event and murdering the bad guys To get even cheaper exhilaration. Aren\u2019t I a dangerous person? I have to be careful.\u201cAhhh! All the events I\u2019ve done! I never chose [No]!\u201dI remember when I saved Yamiyo. I instantly went to help. I remembered.I was an ordinary old man in my previous life. When I hear that a monster has appeared, no matter how much I think I might be able to help it. No matter how good a friend I am, would I help her?Sorry, but I don\u2019t have such a high sense of justice. I get reincarnated as Miu, and I was only 6 years old. It wasn\u2019t I got dragged by Miu\u2019s body.So what does that mean?I realized I get dragged down by the feelings of being the game-specific player. I realized something was wrong.That is it. If I knew it was an event, I would go in again without any confusion. The problem is that I won\u2019t notice it. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out after it\u2019s over.\u201cI see, so it\u2019s a game specification.\u201dI guess there are a lot of disadvantages to this body.I have to get stronger soon. I\u2019m in trouble. The mob protagonist is a god, well, the player is a god\u2019s point of view, so there\u2019s no problem.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cleaning Up AfterwardMiu feels shocked, but she doesn\u2019t feel guilty at all, so she gets back on her feet without too much shock.It\u2019s no use thinking about it. It\u2019s just the way this body works. Well, as long as the bad guys don\u2019t fight me, that\u2019s all that matters. Yeah, I\u2019m perfectly armed. I\u2019m going to think so.But first, I need to check the drop items.\u201cArtificial emerald, artificial onyx, magic iron, magic steel, broken parts, magic stone style battery. \u2026It\u2019s so bad\u201dIt\u2019s Miu, who is a bit sad. Well, it\u2019s a common sub-event. The objective was to get this dungeon.I think I can get something out of the corpse, but what should I do? Sylph Type 22 seems to be usable. The other two are second-hand. The rest turned to ash.But if I sell this magic armor, it will be traced back to me. I\u2019d better not.Feeling like a bandit, I decided to check with Odin.\u201cGrandpa, how many MP do you have left?\u201d\u201c14. I\u2019ve only got enough for one [Teleport].\u201d\u201cYou left me enough for [Teleport]. Thanks.\u201dI smiled back at him, and he shrugged his shoulders. Smiling at a beautiful girl is expensive, you know.[Teleport] is magic learned by grand mages. It allows you to move between locations such as bases and dungeons. Normally, in a game like this, it\u2019s hard to learn magic from the beginning, but in The Night of Magic, people won\u2019t learn it until the Grand Mage.It was a modern fantasy game, the game have various transportation systems, so they wanted to let players use them. It was a real pain in the ass.I made Odin my first companion because he has [Teleport]. He only learns powerful magic, so his fuel consumption is super low, and he runs out of MP very quickly. But this makes him very convenient. It\u2019s a great way to save money on cab fare.It is no longer possible to explore the dungeon. I think I\u2019ll go home now, and just as I collect the magic armor from the corpse, I hear a small voice. Hm? What is it?\u201cOh, um, thank you.\u201dThe kids came up behind me and timidly thanked me. Yeah, it was good. Everyone is safe. The instant-kill magic only affects those Grandpa has identified as enemies, so it doesn\u2019t affect the children. I was relieved.\u201cFrom now on, you guys are free. Good for you!\u201dI smile and reassure the children. There\u2019s no more scum to kill you. You\u2019re free to go on living.I manage to peel the Sylph Formula 22 off the corpse and stop myself from putting it in the item box. For some reason, the kids are staring at me. I got your thanks, didn\u2019t I? Do you still have something for me?\u201cOh, um, what are we going to do now?\u201dI stop moving at the sound of their trembling voices. Oh, I see. In a game, they would smile, say \u201cthank you\u201d, and go away, but this is real life. They don\u2019t want to be left here.\u201cUmmm \u2026\u2026 what should we do?\u201dSince I\u2019m in public, Miu switches to good girl mode. I crossed my arms and was in trouble. What should I do?Hmmm? I mean, aren\u2019t other children being held captive?\u201cHey, do you have any other friends who are trapped?\u201d\u201cUmm, yes. Yes, I do! Can you help me?\u201dThe kids\u2019 eyes light up with enthusiasm, but we\u2019re at our wits\u2019 end. I wonder if the rest of the party wonders if the boss is not coming back.I look at my phone and check the time: 23:00. No choice. I\u2019ll have to be a late-night Miu.\u201cGrandpa, do you know where the kids are?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to rely on Munin\u2019s [Analyze].\u201dI guess that\u2019s impossible. Grandpa\u2019ll ask Munin to analyze it for me. I could find anything, but I can\u2019t go that far.[Analyze]Caw-kun [Analyze] the molten metal. The information on the lump gets displayed on a translucent board in front of me.Name, level, attributes, rare drop items, drop items, flavor text. Hmmm, rare drop items? That\u2019s right. They didn\u2019t drop it, did they? I can\u2019t load it, so I give up on the rare drop and read the flavor text.Age, weight, three sizes for girls, hobbies, likes, dislikes, and character profiles. My address. Recent awards and punishments, a resume. The rest is a brief description. Rewards and punishments are nothing but bad things. What\u2019s a torture killer?\u201cMy address, huh?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if this\u2019s their base or not.\u201dGrandpa said, looking at the results of the analysis as well. The children can\u2019t see the board, so they look at me curiously, wondering what I\u2019m doing, but I recommend going through it. It\u2019s a maiden\u2019s secret.\u201cRight.\u201dBut 3 of the 4 bosses have the same address. There is a high possibility that this\u2019s their home base. Well, let\u2019s go there.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll sleep for 3 hours and go to this base!\u201d\u201cWell, the rest of them won\u2019t have much strength left.\u201dSo Odin and I decided to sleep in the corner of the warehouse. The kids are surprised that I sleep here, but after 3 hours, half my MP is restored. I made sure of it as I sneaked past them, dozing off. Good night~.I left the watch to Geri and Freki.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cleaning Up AfterwardAs it turned out, it\u2019s a building a short distance away was the Chimera\u2019s stronghold, a 5-story building with windows sealed with steel plates, like a fortress. I see a building\u2019s passage blocked by fire shutters, lockers, and desks. And if there is a Chimera boss, it feels like it will appear on each floor.Unfortunately, I no longer had the strength to fight. Only about three witches remained. After that, there are thugs of all kinds. Namu namu.Let me tell you, the level did not go up. There were no mountains or oceans, and the conquest of the base ended that easily.I don\u2019t feel sorry for the goons, because there was a jail with iron bars in the basement, where about 15 children were locked up in poor conditions. I will only say \u201cZamaa\u201d to the guys who got on the bus to Hades as a send-off.Some kids were so skinny. They\u2019re like skeletons.[Cure I.]I heal some children in a state of [Disease I]. Powwow, star-shaped light is sucked into the child, and the skinny child\u2019s cheeks change to plump and reddish.I rescue the children from the basement of the Chimera\u2019s base and gather them in a large room to recover.It\u2019s an empty hall, a garish room, like a dojo for karate or something. It\u2019s the room where a bunch of ruffians gathers with weapons in their hands to war.This building is no longer empty except for the kids and us. We couldn\u2019t see the people on the bus. Ashes I need to clean later, but that\u2019s fine.\u201cThanks!\u201d\u201cThe pain is gone.\u201d\u201cI feel lighter.\u201dThe scrawny kids smile and thank me, and it makes me cry with sadness. It\u2019s too much, even if it\u2019s in a novel world. I\u2019ve seen many prison cells full of human bones in the game, but it\u2019s heartbreaking to see it in real life.Grandpa Odin, who has decided that my time is up, is sipping a glass of wine and playing with the parts of the Ogre with great interest.I have no choice, so I\u2019m carrying the ready-to-eat food from the building\u2019s fridge. There are many snacks for drinks. The only thing I can stomach is rice. Fortunately, their many people living here, and there was a large rice cooker.There was, but I\u2019m sleepy. After finishing our search, it was already 4:00 in the morning. It\u2019s 4:00 in the morning. In my previous life, I would have had to go to work. It\u2019s time to get up.\u201cUm, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to cook rice.\u201d\u201cI can fry an egg!\u201cI\u2019ll make miso soup.\u201dThe 12 year olds saw that I was out and sleepy, so they took over for me. I\u2019m already sleepy. I\u2019m at my limit. I\u2019m sure my parents will worry if I don\u2019t go home.The kids are working hard to cook dinner.I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m done here. What should I do with the kids? I can\u2019t set up a company to sell coupe bread. After all, I am 9 years old.If I leave these kids here, it\u2019s dangerous if there are any remnants left.I can build a robot with the [Mechanic] job, but the initial equipment is not very good. To make them stronger, I have to make the armament better, and it\u2019s not a perpetual motion machine setting, so I didn\u2019t use it.My robots were hard to use because their MP was decreasing every time they did some action. If you think about it, that was a substitute for energy. Maybe I\u2019ll get stuck soon.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a happy event after clearing the event.\u201dSitting potty on the floor, I look at the scrawny children and think. The point is. They shouldn\u2019t be in the slums. Besides, there\u2019s probably someone selling mithril to them, and it\u2019s not good if we don\u2019t leave.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy with the event cleared.\u201dMiu-chan is in trouble. I only can use the dungeon for a few days. There may be people who come to check on the condition of the \u201cChimera\u201d.Honestly, if I hadn\u2019t taken control of security. I\u2019d have just left with anxiety. The building\u2019s security system has already been taken care of, so there\u2019s no problem.Goat Head, your smartphone, and the surveillance cameras are linked together. If I come in unprotected, I\u2019ll get caught on camera.For all the hard work, it\u2019s not very fruitful.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to find a remote orphanage. I hope it\u2019s not an evil orphanage. If we use [Analyze], we\u2019ll know if it\u2019s an evil orphanage.\u201dLet\u2019s sneak out and leave it at the orphanage. We\u2019ll tell them that we helped the orphans. I\u2019d think that once we get out of the slums, we\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s not a perfect response, and the danger to the orphans remains, but I\u2019m 9 year old.In the meantime, I erase the list of children at the base, both electronic and paper. The electronic one was easy because I could get in with [Unlock II] without taking control of the machine. The skill treats both the password and the electronic key as keys. The contents of the safe are keyhole, and the door is scratched up to give the appearance that people couldn\u2019t open it.I don\u2019t leave a body, and I don\u2019t leave anything on the camera. If that\u2019s the case. People might think it was an attack by another hostile force. Because none of the bosses survived. Instead of looking for the kids, they would look for the bosses.I\u2019d give up my Friday-Saturday training and dive into the dungeon every day. It\u2019s power leveling in a short time.I\u2019ll have to raise my base level and leave the proficiencies for later. I\u2019m counting on you, Grandpa Odin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s Conquer The Dungeon!Sleipnir is an eight-legged horse. It gallops through the heavens and the earth. It significantly increased my map movement speed. The last significant increase in movement speed is applied in the game.\u201cYes, Suu-chan!\u201dI\u2019m not your fishing-loving grandpa. It\u2019s Granpa Odin who rides Sleipnir. It\u2019s a mobility item I get when I make Odin my friend.The next day. Being the coward I am, I still thought it was dangerous to go in and out of the dungeon, so I decided to spend only the next day clearing the dungeon.I left the children at the orphanage with the director, who seemed to be a good person. He seemed anxious, but they would probably be fine. I only hope that the chain of quests will not cause an event to save the orphanage from debt.The director must be in trouble because I secretly left the children at the orphanage. I\u2019ll support you later, so please pay your respects. I was very firm with the orphans. I told him that they were living in the slums, but they were at their limits. If I mention anything about confinement, the Chimera\u2019s backers might notice.It\u2019s a big group of 20 people. I promise I\u2019ll be right back to assist later.Hi-Yo Silver and I are moving fast with the reins. Pakarang pakarang, it\u2019s-a Miu, a beautiful girl who enjoys horseback riding today.I\u2019m not riding around the city, because riding an eight-legged horse would be a real standout. Where is she? She is in a dungeon with mithril eaters.\u201cHi-Yo, Suu-chan! We\u2019ve got a big catch tonight!\u201dShe hits the reins and rushes. As far as the eye can see, we run through a place composed of rocky mountains and sand.\u201cHiheeenn!\u201dSleipnir nodded in a good mood. It seems that it likes big catches.\u201cI guess if the bait is good, you can catch a lot of fish, right?\u201d\u201cHmm. You\u2019ve caught a lot.\u201dGrandpa Odin rides and glances behind me. I looked behind me as well and saw a big catch. What\u2019s a big catch?Of course, we caught a lot of monsters. Tonight\u2019s dinner will be a full-course fish dinner. Behind us, a tremendous number of monsters were chasing us with a cloud of dust.We\u2019re using the speed of Sleipnir to mass train. There are ants the size of a person, a centipede monster covered in armor, and a gigantic flea with a spear-like proboscis. Several other monsters were chasing after us.Ants crawled out of the crevices between spear-like rock piles, and fleas emerged from the sand. Hundreds of legs peeked their heads out of gnarled holes in the rock face. It is a scene like the Night of the Hundred Demons.If we were even a little slow, they would catch up with us and would be our end.\u201cIt\u2019s thrilling, isn\u2019t it? Ushishshi.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a new monster up ahead!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you how to avoid monsters!\u201dThree two-meter-tall ants appeared in front of me, but I pulled back on the reins and meandered along. The ants raise their paws to threaten me, but that\u2019s their weakness.The Sleipnirs puckeringly and easily pass by. Sorry.\u201cOsh, we\u2019re going in on the third floor!\u201d\u201cKuku, I like your daredevil ways, girl.\u201dIt\u2019s funny, Grandpa laughs, but I value efficiency.\u201cHmm, sometimes gamers risk their lives. Let\u2019s save [Teleport], okay?\u201dMiu smiles as she puffs out her chest, which is still growing, but she is scared, so she takes out insurance.If I move forward while meandering, I can easily avoid it. The giant horse understands what I\u2019m trying to do and gallops along, hoof beats high in the air as if it were one man and one horse.The dungeon in The Night of Magic is an environmental dungeon, despite its name. An environmental dungeon. Not a dungeon with long, narrow passages, but a dungeon with deserts, rainforests, volcanoes, and snow-covered mountains.There are several large spatial areas, connected by small corridors. In other words, if you move fast enough, you can avoid the demons.That was not the case in the game. The dungeon in the game has the same environment, but on a different scale and in a smaller hall. The developer did that to not make the player stressed by making them run through a very large space in vain.But in reality, it is a vast hall. A single room could be several kilometers long. In games with an encounter system, even if the hall is small, there is no problem because the battle takes place in a vast space during the battle.In reality, however, that is not right. You don\u2019t move to a different space when you encounter monsters, and even in the original story, there was a description of a dungeon with a vast plain continuing. So the dungeon is large enough for Sleipnir to run around in.If we just ran away, the enemy would lose sight of us, but we would not do that. We ran slowly so that the enemy would not lose sight of us.\u201cA new monster has appeared.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mithril eater!\u201dFrom the shadow of the anthill ahead, a 5-meter-tall anteater-like monster appears. It\u2019s a monster with silver fur. I know, I know. I also hunted a lot in the game.The anteater has a long, slender tongue, but the mithril eater\u2019s long, slender mouth splits vertically to reveal a pink interior. The fangs, which grow like slithery gold, are disgusting.[Examine]Mithril Eater Level 25It\u2019s the same level as in the game. Then, I guessed its ability would be the same, too.\u201cIt\u2019s resistant to everything but the all-powerful. It\u2019s hard and has high attack power, so it\u2019s hard to defeat. Its weak point is status ailments. If you use that to it, it\u2019s a weak enemy. If you defeat it, you can get a mithril pelt. If you break it down, it becomes mithril ore.\u201d\u201cIs mithril expensive in this world?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rare magic metal used for magic armor and such. If you kill one of them, you can get 10 million yen.\u201dSo, in the game, at the same level range, it was the perfect monster for money-making. But it was only 10 million yen. I don\u2019t know what kind of scumbag would sacrifice children for such a small amount of money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s Conquer The Dungeon!Grandpa laughs at my angry tone. He probably thinks I\u2019m too nice. It doesn\u2019t matter. Miu is a good girl.Of course, the mithril eater is going to the train. It\u2019s not an event monster or anything. It\u2019s just a small fry monster.It\u2019s just a monster for a money-making scheme in a game that is used for the same money-making scheme in reality. It\u2019s unexpected, but it\u2019s not surprising. Even if they are not players, people in this world are alive. They have the intelligence to think. So it\u2019s natural that a group of people will defeat the tasty monsters, but I didn\u2019t expect the bad guys to use that method to get the money.I\u2019m going to be so disappointed. I played the game and loved it.I will destroy this dungeon that feeds on children. No mercy. I\u2019ll raise the bar while I\u2019m at it.\u201c4th floor!\u201dI quickly find the stairs to the 4th floor and enter. As we proceeded down the passageway to the back, we found a swarm of winged ants, equipped with swords and shields, camped out on the rocky hillside.\u201cFeathered ants mean that the enemies here are queen ants. If we meet winged ants here, this is the last floor, grandpa!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s shallow to be called a dungeon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cExcept for the secret dungeons, there are a maximum of 10 levels. It\u2019s usually three levels!\u201dIt\u2019s just a design to avoid stress. The developer chose to make it easy, attracting light users and selling downloadable dungeons to heavy users for a fee.We ignored the winged ants. We proceeded at a steady pace. It is precise because of [Material Reflect] that such unreasonableness is possible. Few people use magic at the opening, and low-level magic can escape before it is activated. It\u2019s not like a game. Fufufufu.Sleipnir runs at high speed as if it\u2019s flying. Behind it, a swarm of monsters. It\u2019s now a stampede. If you fall off Sleipnir here, you are sure to die. Not a piece of you will be left.As we proceed through the 4th level, we see a wall that looks like was made of solidified dead flesh. It\u2019s a wall of dead flesh reaching up to the ceiling, 50 meters high. It\u2019s a huge empty cave.As we approach, a red light shines from the cave. Something crawls out of the cave.\u201cKishaaa!\u201dIt must be 10 meters high. It\u2019s the queen ant with a swollen belly led into the cave. It bared its fangs and drooled, confirming that we were her prey. It was an acid drool because it made a sizzling sound, and smoke came from the ground.It was the queen ant, the boss of this place. A hundred or so of the guard ants came out in droves. They realized that the enemy had arrived.\u201cIn the game, it\u2019s an endless [Call your friends] type battle. But in real life, it\u2019s like that.\u201dI held back my gray hair, swept away by the wind, and was impressed. It\u2019s just like in the game world. No, it\u2019s the Night of Magic.\u201cOsh, [look it up].\u201dQueen Ant, level 52Royal Guard Ant, level 45.I expect their level.\u201cOsh! Odin, do it!\u201dI use [fight] on the first enemy I encounter. I\u2019m ready to go. With a snap of her index finger against Queen Antoine, Miu commands in a cute voice.\u201cEither the enemy is stupid. The lady is bold, or both. Either way, you got it.\u201d\u201cFlame, all-powerful, all-powerful! Use your weakest great magic!\u201dAll ants here are flame-weak. But some of the other monsters are immune to flame, so I\u2019ll mix in the all-powerful attribute, and because of the MP problem, I\u2019ll choose the weakest magic in the great magic system.\u201cI understand.\u201dOdin extends his hands and uses his skill.\u201cGreat magic, I see, is very useful.\u201dHis white beard-covered mouth turns into a thin smile.[Three Consecutive Magic][Prominence][Nova][Nova]My vision is covered in a bright red glow, followed by abyssal darkness and an extreme explosion of light.\u201cKya!\u201dThe original total magic only a great mage can perform shakes the ground, melting everything and turning it into nothingness. I think the intensity is ten. Sleipnir floated slightly in the sky to avoid the shaking, which helped, but our surroundings transformed into a hellish landscape.The dungeon had begun to collapse as the storm rolled in, and the ground and ceiling began to shatter. Even though my party was not affected by the magic, the indirect aftermath was killing us.It was as if we were in the sun. I sometimes see a scene on TV of flames erupting like dragons on the sun\u2019s surface, but that was it.The demons that had been trailing had already lost their shadows and shape, and the heat and flames of several hundred million degrees had burned the world to the ground.Lava rained down on my body, hitting me with super-hot heat that burned me up by touching me. But strangely enough, a skin barrier is created, and everything got swept away. I feel cool and not hot. The secondary effects of magic do not harm the player either. It is a relief, but too frightening a sight.Pressing my petite body against Sleipnir, I screamed. That\u2019s scary! I glanced at Odin and saw that his eyes were shining brightly. The power of his magic must be wonderful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Current Masatoshi-DumDum Masatoshi\u2019s POV-Aguni Masatoshi. He\u2019s a genius fire magician, the eldest son of a venerable duke.And he\u2019s a god reincarnated in the world of The Night of Magic. At the very least, Masatoshi considers himself a god.As a big fan of The Night of Magic, Masatoshi has read the novel story, pored over the setting books, and knows everything about this world.He did not play the game that was said to destroy the original work, but it was just a trash game that took advantage of its popularity. He doesn\u2019t know anything about it because He doesn\u2019t want to touch it, let alone memorize it, but that\u2019s not a problem.Recently, the god of Masatoshi has been restless.\u201cNext month will be my debut event at the Imperial Castle. I\u2019ve been waiting for it for a long time. The time has finally come for me to be involved in the original work.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this moment for 10 years,\u201d Masatoshi said, smiling as he sat in his room reading a comic book.As the eldest son of a duke, Katsutoshi\u2019s room is very expensive and luxurious. Of course, the room is divided into a reception room for welcoming guests, a study room, and a bedroom, and it\u2019s spacious enough to hold a small home party. The bed in the bedroom is a canopy bed.The bedroom is furnished with a canopy bed, furniture that would cost several years of a typical annual income, and furnishings that would be worth several decades. Everything was first class. Victory himself is dressed in brand-name, magically-impregnated clothing. These clothes cost tens of millions of dollars each.Masatoshi, given such a luxurious room, was doing as he wanted. \u2026\u2026It might be difficult to say that it\u2019s selfish because it has become considerably more subdued than he did before.\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a room that has been put together with a high-class and elegant sense, but it has the personality of a Masatoshi\u2019s room.The walls were covered with anime posters, the bookshelves were lined with comic books and novels, figurines were arranged under multi-million dollar paintings, and on the bed\u2019s canopy was a hug pillow with a half-naked anime character printed on it.Masatoshi decorated it like that because he\u2019s an otaku like in his previous life. It completely ruined the elegant atmosphere of the room.Well, this is a natural consequence. If an otaku is reincarnated in a modern fantasy, there is a very good chance that they\u2019ll still become an otaku. Even if the environment changes, hobbies do not change easily.And human nature does not easily change either.However, in an environment such as a ducal family, one\u2019s behavior will change even if one\u2019s humanity does not. Masatoshi, who was a self-proclaimed freelancer in a previous life, believes that the environment was bad. Poor parents who wanted him to go to college but told him to get a job because it was too much for them, and teachers who nagged him to come to school well. Classmates who looked at him as if he were a fool, etc. That was Masatoshi\u2019s bad environment in his previous life.Now it\u2019s different. Masatoshi\u2019s rich, powerful, and above all, he has a talent for magic. Although Masatoshi was a violent, punching and kicking man, he had been crooked and had even graduated from high school.Therefore, third-grade studies are a light matter for him. His tutors and schoolteachers are sincere in their praise of his talent as a genius, despite his violent nature. Of course, flattery is involved, but it\u2019s praise Masatoshi has never tasted before.That has made Masatoshi feel good, and recently he has been studying hard to skip a grade. When praised, even pigs climb trees.And because of his magical talents, there was no abuse involving simple violence. In his previous life, he would look away and lose his presence when he saw a classmate or other idiot boasting of his power, but now he can cut the wind with my shoulder and maintain a dignified attitude.Moreover, since he has power and money, he\u2019s also backed by his parents. He also has cronies of both sexes.Yes, there are girls in their circle. When Masatoshi is flattered, he gets carried away and immediately buys drinks, perhaps as a reaction to memories of being scorned in a previous life. Therefore, not only men but also girls were in his circle.He also had good taste in clothing: for 10 years he had lived in the duke\u2019s house surrounded by luxury goods, and his attendants had provided him with tasteful, high-class clothes. As one would expect, any human being has a certain amount of aesthetic sense.It\u2019s like living in a foreign country and becoming able to speak a foreign language fluently in less than two years.As usual, he did not stop being violent with his servants, but these circumstances made him a highly competent man.The most significant is that he puts in some effort. When he gets praised, he learns. In his previous life, if he did not understand something, he would have lost motivation even when praised. But in this life, his tutor teaches him from the basics, and Masatoshi\u2019s high specifications reflect his efforts, making him an excellent person.The biggest thing, however, is the presence of his father, Enraku. He recently became aware that his father, who had no inner description, is not the personality he had expected.He\u2019s free-spirited and caresses the people he likes. That was Enraku\u2019s position in the novel, but Masatoshi understood that he had a hidden side.His father\u2019s cunning and brutal. He\u2019s able to plot over a long time, and he thinks he may be eviler than the boss in the novel. No, as a high-ranking aristocrat, it\u2019s natural.Masatoshi fears that the fire in his eyes is dark and murky, far from the open-hearted he is. In the original story, he apologizes to the protagonist, regretting his failure to educate the illegitimate Masatoshi, but he\u2019s convinced now that it was probably just a pose.Even after Masatoshi\u2019s abolition, he still suffered a tragic fate, but there were many developments of opportunism. When he was reading the original story, he didn\u2019t think it strange and laughed at him as a stupid character, but when he thought about it realistically, it was unnatural in many cases. As he was driven into a corner, the pattern often made sense when he told the hero that someone had set him up.If this is his father\u2019s strategy, then the villainess\u2019s pattern with condemnation scenes is lukewarm. He\u2019ll be destroyed without realizing it. Perhaps his father might chase his hot-blooded younger brother as the heir in the future. My younger brother is incapable of such a plot. There is no story after the original is completed. Even if the future is tragic, there is nothing strange about it.So, rather than abolition, the fear of death reminded Masatoshi to make an effort every time he saw his father.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Current Masatoshi-DumDum Masatoshi\u2019s POV-Fortunately or unfortunately, Masatoshi\u2019s growing up in such an environment turned him into an excellent person.But his human nature remains the same.\u201cThis is my chance to become a saint and a lover. It\u2019s that first event.\u201dHe chuckles when he finally meets one of the heroine\u2019s likes after he\u2019s been reborn in the Night of Magic\u2019s world. Masatoshi aims at his favorites among the heroines of the main character\u2019s harem.One is the hero\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, with who he plans to get in a bet. And the other was a saint.In a world where recovery magicians are rare, she is a saintly heroine.\u201cI have the progression of events firmly in mind. She\u2019s the only one who has a clear timeline of events.\u201dHe smirks and chuckles, leaning back in his chair and squeaking. He came into this world thinking. He wonders which heroine he could get.He\u2019ll take any heroine who is foolish enough to take me as a prize in a bet. But he also wanted to enjoy pure love. That\u2019s what Masatoshi thought.Masatoshi\u2019s idea of pure love. It\u2019s a partner who is truly in love with him and always gives him full affirmation. Those who hear this desire will say that such a thing is not pure love, but Masatoshi truly believed it to be so.He would give good food, clothes, and better treatment to slaves who live in misery. He will rescue women who are being abused by their families and give them luxuries. Give a woman with a gaping hole in her heart the words she wants and help her out in a pinch.Then they will come to depend on you. If you ask him, if that is pure love, he considers Masatoshi\u2019s pure love. There was a hidden awareness that he wanted a cute doll that depended on him.\u201cHeh, heh. Good, I\u2019ll show you how cool I am. I don\u2019t need to be the hero. God will change the story a little.\u201dHe\u2019ll have to work hard at the party, throwing down his comic book and heading to his desk. The contents of his junior high school studies are on his desk, but that\u2019s not a problem. Aguni Masatoshi\u2019s abilities are high-spec, and he can still use the knowledge of his past self.Grabbing a pen, the maid of honor puts down a cup of iced tea. He picked up the manga that had been thrown away and tried to study it, watching sideways as she bowed her head and left silently. In his previous life, this would have been an unthinkable action, but he frowns at the sound of a knock at the door.\u201cWhat?\u201dHe wondered since he didn\u2019t think anyone would have a business to knock at this hour, but I looked over to the maid of honor and nodded to her. Following Masatoshi\u2019s instruction, who has become quite accustomed to giving orders to others, the maid of honor opens the door.A butler is standing straight and tall, bowing reverently to her.\u201cMasatoshi-sama. Your father wants to see you.\u201d\u201cHuh? \u2026\u2026 Did something happen? Well, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201dMasatoshi nodded and left the room, heading for the office where Enraku was waiting. It\u2019s bad to lose his temper. It would be obvious if his father could see it in his expression, but fathers in this world only laugh boldly and do not show their inner feelings. So he needs to be careful.There is no love, but a bond of fear, that Nasatoshi feels now. Of course, Masatoshi feels he has no choice since it comes with enormous money and power. Masatoshi believes that a loveless life with enormous assets is far better than a poor life with love.As he continues down the hallway, he wonders at the many people he passes. For some reason, some of them are wearing magic armor, and it smells hectic and dangerous. Frowning at the unpleasant smell, Masatoshi knocks on his father\u2019s office door.\u201cFather, it\u2019s Masatoshi.\u201d\u201cOh, come in.\u201dHe enters with a light bow of the head, saying, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d as permission is immediately granted, and raises his head, his face tightening.Inside the Oval Office was his father, Enraku. However, he was fully equipped. He was wearing Enraku\u2019s special magic armor, which looked like it was made out of rubies, and he was holding a halberd. Enraku\u2019s lieutenants were also there, also armed.\u201cIs it war?\u201dEnraku, looking unusually grumpy, opens his mouth to Masatoshi, who is puzzled by the overwhelming scene.\u201cIt\u2019s not a war. But it\u2019s going to be troublesome. You need to equip yourself with special magic armor. We\u2019ll be out soon.\u201dMasatoshi frowns his face slightly as he sees what\u2019s going on.\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to the slums. It looks like some other nobleman has gotten on my land.\u201dA duke\u2019s land in a slum? Masatoshi wondered, but stopped asking more questions and quickly returned to get his equipment.He thought it would be troublesome to be a noble who picks fights with the Duke Aguni.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He has never seen his father in such a foul mood before, and he shudders, his shoulders narrowing and his body contracting.Masatoshi\u2019s trying to become an excellent person in the future in the Dukes of Aguni\u2019s environment, but his heart is from his previous life. No matter how confident he may be, the sneering spirit that lies deep within him is ingrained, indicating that he is a small person.But this heavy air became unbearable, and he stiffly opened his mouth. There is also a curiosity as to why his father\u2019s in such a foul mood. He wondered why his father, who was acting the part of a man with a big heart, was in such a bad mood.\u201cFather, what in the world happened?\u201dEnraku turns his sharp eyes with an intimidating glare at Masatoshi\u2019s question. He stops tapping his fingers, sighs and tells me.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on developing cities. We got word that another nobleman has entered one of them.\u201d\u201cOh, they just stepped in, didn\u2019t they? And yet you\u2019re taking so many people with you?\u201dHe cursed in his heart that it was a violent group. It\u2019s insane to send soldiers just because they\u2019ve entered our territory. It\u2019s also strange.Yes, it is strange. Would Masatoshi\u2019s father, who uses intrigue, take his soldiers and ride in himself for such a thing? He would have sent his men toward them, protesting.At the dubious look on Masatoshi\u2019s face, Enraku exhaled in a bored manner.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a special place.\u201d\u201cSpecial is \u2026\u2026? Perhaps it\u2019s in a slum area. If so, are you trying to develop a slum?\u201dI looked out the window and saw the landscape had become filthy abandoned buildings and collapsed stores, with dirty people peeking out from behind the buildings. I have never been in a slum, but I have heard stories. Probably a slum.\u201cYes. I\u2019m trying to develop the slums. I bought some land around here a long time ago. It was too expensive to develop this place, so I had to abort the project.\u201d\u201cI see, so you think that\u2019s where the other nobles got into it?\u201dIf they aren\u2019t developing it. Why don\u2019t they leave it alone? Masatoshi wonders if it would not be a problem for his father to leave such a dirty place alone.There are piles of garbage everywhere, people burn the garbage in drums, and the poor camp there. It would be impossible to develop this area.Masatoshi\u2019s doubts are valid, but Enraku leans back in his chair in frustration.As he peered out the window in dismay, wondering if Masatoshi had called to appeal for ownership of the slum, he noticed something odd.\u201cSnow? Is it ash?\u201dSnow was fluttering outside the window. No, upon closer inspection, it was ash. Ash had somehow fallen from the sky and covered the slum-like snow. The whole landscape had changed to white ashes.\u201cThat\u2019s why. There was a dungeon on my land, and it burned up last night.\u201d\u201cDungeon? What do you mean burned up?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Dungeons are made in the crevices of space. It burned inside, and the flames erupted outside, and then the ashes fell like volcanic ash.\u201dDungeon. He\u2019s hearing those words made sense to Masatoshi. A dungeon opens its entrance to the ground, but its interior is a subspace and does not appear by grinding underground. The dungeon must have been created without being noticed.The fact that it spews flames from the entrance suggests that it is a dungeon in a fiery environment. Most dungeons are harmful, but some of them produce useful resources. It has resources like rare ores, magic herbs, and delicious monsters such as hornbeaks.So Masatoshi understood that his father was in a hurry when the dungeon appeared. That was the intention. That is why he was on his way to appeal for ownership.\u201cA dungeon of fire? It seems to be very difficult to conquer. I hope there is something useful.\u201dIf they were to equip themselves with fireproof equipment and attack the interior, it would not be surprising if a member of the Duke of Aguni\u2019s family, who was resistant to flames, was dispatched to the dungeon. He frowned slightly, wondering if he would be a candidate.However, he received an unexpected response.\u201cThe dungeon was rich in ore, but the enemies were troublesome. Besides, someone had conquered the dungeon. That place should have been impossible to conquer. I was going to be well-prepared to attack it, and now I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d\u201cWhat? You know there is a dungeon. No, no, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dHis father\u2019s story is contradictory. Strangely, he knew it was impossible to conquer the dungeon when he supposedly didn\u2019t know about it. But I keep a lid on my curiosity. It\u2019d so my life are spared. Maybe his father will tell him in a little while, but until then, Masatoshi will keep quiet. It seems it was a secretly managed training and resource-mining dungeon, so just guessing is enough.Soon the car stops, Yan Le leaves as if to jump out, and Masatoshi hurries to follow.As they get out of the car, it is humid and smells like rain, as if it is about to rain. The ashes are falling silently around the area, it\u2019s eerie.And in front of Masatoshi was a sight that could not have been possible in a slum. Magicians in magical armor were standing guard, weapons at the ready, and in the center of it all, several trucks were parked, and workers were moving heavy machinery.\u201cStop! You guys, stop the work! Call it off!\u201dEnraku shouted angrily, waving his hands wildly as he zipped along. The magicians show alarm, but without doing anything, the workers stop the heavy machinery through Yanraku.\u201cKuh, this is it!\u201dMasatoshi follows Enraku and sees the place that seems to be the center, looks up, and is now speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hidden Interests In The Slums-Masatoshi\u2019s POV-There was nothing there. The land was a neat mortar with a radius of about 100 meters. There was a flicker of ash, but there was still heat, smoke billowing out, and a feeling of heat. The ground was glassy, and a huge charred object sat in the center.Something had gouged it out. No, Masatoshi heard that flames had gouged out the surrounding area. Moreover, the buildings around the crater were still standing.The superheat of the moment passed. It must have reduced the land to ashes, even though it disappeared before the fire could spread. It is hard to imagine what kind of fire magic it was. Even in the original story, he has never read of such magic. No, is it a known magic that the novel\u2019s description does not reveal?In any case, there are no dead monsters. If the dungeon core gets destroyed, the monsters under the dungeon die. Therefore, there should be many dead monsters left in the dungeon, but there are none. No, it is probably just a huge charred corpse in the center. Perhaps it is the boss.Its exoskeleton is melted, its head is crushed, and most of its legs are gone. But for Masatoshi looked vaguely familiar.\u201cIs that an empress ant?\u201dIt feels like the monster from the original story. It looks like a giant ant carcass. In the original story, some monsters crawled out of the dungeon and wreaked havoc in the Imperial City. He thinks they appeared as if they were splitting a nest.The empress ant emerged from a dungeon in a slum and went on a rampage with its subordinates. The protagonist should have been able to use the most powerful magic [Nova] there. He joined forces with the heroines, kept attacking, got everyone to share their mana, and could use the magic to make the slums disappear.\u201cThat was a depressing turn of events. It was the worst description I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThe empress ant killed everyone in the slums. Masatoshi frowned, saying that the description of the event was eerie.The ants dissolve humans in acid and turn them into meatballs while still alive. They use human flesh and bones to make anthills. Women and children were equally used as food and get eaten to pieces. The depiction of how the ants eat the people was so terrible that Masatoshi felt nauseous, even though it was a novel.That story was worthy of the protagonist\u2019s rise to power. The people of the slum get wiped out by the ants, the land becomes the protagonist\u2019s, and he recruits new residents and acquires a new development area as a great aristocrat.In the anime, they change the story to an original story. The story is about the protagonist who developed and ruled the land together with the people of the slum. There must have been a lot of problems with the storyline in which the protagonist gets the rest of the land after killing all the people in the slum. The Night of Magic had many terrible storylines.In reality, it would be a disappointing development, Masatoshi thought. But he knew anyone couldn\u2019t defeat the enemy except the protagonist.\u201cInfinite regenerative power and gushing royal guard ants. A hard exoskeleton, powerful magic, and over-powerful martial arts. There\u2019s no way we can beat them. Many high-ranking mob characters have died, and hostile forces have succumbed. And for the protagonist, he was a boss who did nothing but good things, but that\u2019s why the others should not have been able to defeat him\u2026\u201dAt that time, the protagonist\u2019s name was becoming famous among the nobles, and the protagonist\u2019s family was trying to compete with them, to show their power. They led their faction to attack and defeat him. A different monster, perhaps? Masatoshi doesn\u2019t know because it\u2019s charred black.In the anime, they change it to a cheesy development where the protagonist defeats a hostile faction that interferes with land development with new magic.Enraku goes to the side of the charred monster, intimidates the workers, and drives them away. A subordinate hurriedly hands the halberd to Enraku.\u201cThis is my land. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, it looks like something unfortunate happened, but this corpse belongs to me!\u201dThe workers are frightened and run away from Enraku, who is furious and yells at them. In front of the strongest fire magician Enraku, ordinary people would not even think of fighting against him.But on the contrary, if it were not for ordinary people, there would be those who would oppose him.\u201cI\u2019m in trouble, Duke Aguni. We plan to keep the monster\u2019s corpse as an important property.\u201dA middle-aged man in a suit approaches Enraku with a calm tone. Masatoshi was surprised that anyone would come to Enraku in this condition.The man was of medium build and thin as a thread. He exuded an air of calmness but gave off an image of danger and caution.\u201cYou\u2019re the Duke Kaminashi. You\u2019re trying to steal something from my land, eh?\u201dEnraku bared his teeth, giving off an intimidating impression. The attitude, which even makes Masatoshi feel like dying, is not like Enraku\u2019s. It was a mixture of acting.However, the man known as Duke Kaminashi brushes off this intimidation like a gentle breeze, and only his mouth turns into a smirk.\u201cAs the head of the army, I need to retrieve the dangerous monsters. I also have to investigate what happened.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. This land belongs to Duke Aguni. I can\u2019t let you mess with it. I completely understand your desire to obtain the monster\u2019s corpse.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care how you take it.\u201dThe quiet, quiet voice of Kaminashi contrasts with the rough and rugged Enraku.\u201cFather, don\u2019t you think it would be better to compromise without asking too much?\u201dNext to the middle-aged man stood a boy the same age as Masatoshi. He seemed to be following along.Masatoshi gulped.He was said to have dark hair, dark eyes, an ordinary face, and no outstanding talent. When he puts on a serious face, he\u2019s a handsome boy with a talent that no one can match.The protagonist of the magical night, Kaminashi Shin, was standing there.\u201cWait, both of you. It looks like something used high-level magic. We need to join forces to investigate here, don\u2019t we?\u201dTeijo Ouga appeared. And behind him, Yamiyo, a reincarnated person, and Miu, who was supposed to die in the original story, followed.And behind them were a large number of warriors.Masatoshi was in a cold sweat when things got complicated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Corpses Are So Expensive-Miu\u2019s POV-Takano Miu, the most adorable and beautiful girl in the world, was sweating cold sweat. She\u2019s drenched in a cold sweat.Why? Great magic is too strong. It\u2019s different from ordinary magic. How can you call it all magic and still burn up the dungeon and the outside world? It\u2019s the aftermath of [Prominence].[Prominence] is an all-magic, and if even one enemy remains, the continuing damage of the flames will follow. Since the queen ants did not die, the flame must have burned through the dungeon\u2019s floor, a space several kilometers wide, during that time.That\u2019s only a fraction of a second before the queen ants die, right? The magic burning it all up in that little time. It\u2019s magic that is no longer dangerous to use. It might be okay to use magic to counteract the ongoing damage, but I don\u2019t intend to use it anymore unless I have a good reason.There is some single-target magic, but I\u2019d hesitate to use it. I\u2019m not sure if it only damages single targets. The effects in the game were so flashy.The dungeon is gone. It\u2019s a crater, a crater. It\u2019s become a mortar-shaped crater. It was like this place was a warehouse. Was it my fault?I had promised to play with Yamiyo, and I stayed up late and played with Yamiyo who came to my house, trying not to be sleepy. Then, someone from the Teijo family came to call Yamiyo, so I followed along. When I see something that looks like an event, my body moves on its own. It wasn\u2019t because of my curiosity. Nyaa.I have heard that curiosity kills cats. Ouga is staring at the other old men with some chilly air. Who are these people? And why did they come to this place? I hear that the killer won\u2019t return to the crime scene, but I\u2019m not a killerOnly Queen Antoine\u2019s corpse remains. I\u2019ll leave it as a souvenir trophy for you to do with as you, please. Can I go home now?Of course not. There is no good reason. Even in the dark of night, they look serious. I mean, everyone is fully equipped. Why? Do they want to fight something?In the car, we heard the story. It\u2019s a story about a flame dragon that people could see from a place in the slums, heading for the heavens. When I thought I was lucky that queen ant was dead right away. Had it been a little later, the slum would have to get damaged.So, even though the slum is said to be extraterritorial, I could not ignore it, and some of us went to investigate and found a crater and the ant\u2019s corpse had enormous magical power.We decided to retrieve it immediately. No matter how dangerous the slum is, if there are 20 magicians, they will not touch it.So we came in a hurry, but the other nobles had arrived before us.\u201cWell, well, well. Marquis Teijo. There is no need for you to come out. I will take care of this place. So you can rest assured.\u201dThe middle-aged man in a nervous-looking suit with foxy eyes, who was polite, but gave off an air of non-rebuttal, made a graceful curtsy.\u201cIdiot. I told you this is my land.\u201dThe old man with fiery red hair, red eyes, and full-body armor that looks like made rubies groaned like a beast and interjected that he was indeed a magician of flames.I know the old man with red hair. And the child who stands beside him, who looks like he has a bad character. They are from the Duke Aguni. They came to apologize for the stone golem incident. After that, they often sent me apologies, souvenirs from their trips, and gifts at the end of the year. After all, they are very expensive goods. I thought the durian was a form of harassment.The gift in return has to be just as expensive, you know? It would cut my father\u2019s salary as a government employee. I was eating the most delicious melon I had ever tasted and thinking that the souvenirs from the trip should be at least 500 yen. My father became a viscount and got promoted to section chief, but his allowance only increased by about 50,000 yen. I was amazed. The standards of the rich are truly horrendous.I wondered who the other guy was, and then I recognized the kid standing next to him and realized who the fox-eyed old man was. This guy is Duke Kanna. The first duke of the Japanese Magic Empire. His hair color is blonde. The old man looks more and more like a fox with blond hair and blond eyes.That kid is Shin. Kanna Shin. He\u2019s the protagonist of the Night of Magic, the only man with the [Void] attribute. Incidentally, in the game, it is treated as a universal attribute. But I finally met the hero. He has an ordinary face, just like in the anime. In other words, he has a handsome face. His ordinary face means a handsome face, you know. The average face of all the characters is the second face.He has a serious face, smiling and laughing in a friendly way. He\u2019s intelligent, and his talent is high even without magic. But he\u2019s a man who gets thrown out of the Duke Kanna family, which has multiple attributes, such as not being needed as he did not awaken to mana.He is only 10 years old now. He\u2019s being carefully raised as a legitimate son because people believe he\u2019ll awaken to mana until he is 12 years old if I\u2019m not wrong. Shin\u2019s very capable. Around his neck are a string and an old ring. I\u2019ve found the second Sacred Artifact. I\u2019ll prepare a fake one.\u201cLet\u2019s leave this place to us, the security guards.\u201d\u201cNo, this is something the military cannot tolerate.\u201d\u201cYou guys, get out of here. This is my land.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Corpses Are So Expensive-Miu\u2019s POV-The three of them argue without backing down. Teijo family is the head of the Kempeitai, or the military police, which protects public order. The Kanna family, I think, is the head of the military. And the Aguni family is the owner of the land here? If only Munin were here, too bad.It rings a bell that he\u2019s connected to the Chimera. They used it as a subordinate organization. But they didn\u2019t manage it well.While I felt my good feeling toward Duke Aguni fell into a negative one, I also guessed that maybe Duke Aguni was not involved in the children\u2019s sacrifices.Why is this? They\u2019re using the children\u2019s life to earn a fraction of 10 million yen is too much of a disadvantage than an advantage for the duke. If that got exposed, the duke\u2019s name would surely fall to the ground. By knowing this, there is no way they would appeal for ownership of this land.Perhaps Aguni Enraku is just letting its subordinate organizations manage the dungeon in secret. Chimera maybe was out of control. It happens all the time. It\u2019s a template.Enraku thinks that the degree to which he\u2019s secretly managed the dungeon isn\u2019t a problem even if people found out. If I had found out that the Chimera was using children as bait to scam money. I would never have come here.Man, I\u2019ve already killed all the witnesses. If they find out about this later, they will do their best to cover it up. I saved your life. I\u2019m sure they were involved, and I wish I could get some retribution for it, but I can\u2019t right now.On the flip side, I also think that children\u2019s lives are no longer in danger. If they\u2019re going to remain ignorant, it is best to stay out of the children\u2019s lives. If they kill witnesses, they don\u2019t want to send assassins to return fire and make people think that the duke\u2019s family is involved. It\u2019s because the duke wants people to think the magician who conquered this dungeon is behind it.If the duke sends an assassin, it would be a contradiction in terms. Even if they get found out, they would probably claim that the Chimera organization had somehow taken up residence here. It\u2019s a slum, so it\u2019s a real possibility.Unless people prove that the duke gets connected to the Chimera, and they sacrifice the children, they will not make a move. People will look for who invaded the dungeon. I don\u2019t doubt that the other nobles will look for them.And I understood what these people wanted.They want the queen ant\u2019s corpse. It\u2019s the carcass of a level 52 boss monster. It\u2019s a much better material than a monster in the same level range. It would be worth more than level 60 if it were an ordinary monster.\u201cAre they asking for ownership of that corpse?\u201dI tug at Yamiyo\u2019s hem, and when I ask in a whisper, she nods back.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve never seen that thing\u2019s tremendous magical power.\u201dI gulped and swallowed, and Yamiyo trembled a little and answered. Looking at the terrifying mass of magical power, Yamiyo was scared because she must have a high ability to perceive magical power. It has tremendous magical power, so I also hold her hand and tremble.\u201cUmmm, yes. It has great magic power, isn\u2019t it?\u201dI didn\u2019t feel it at all. It was not a second surprise.But it looks nothing more than the charred corpse of an insect. Can I use it for the windshield of a gunship? For now, that\u2019s it. Anyway, there it is. Please give me an effect. It feels like it\u2019s filled with magical power. It was in the game, so I wonder if I could do the same in real life. I can\u2019t sense mana, so even if people told me I have magical powers, I don\u2019t understand it.I don\u2019t understand why they brought their children to the slums. Did they bring their heirs as an ordinary war force?The three old men show a sword-swallowing atmosphere, their words, and actions are rough, but they don\u2019t seem to start fighting. Hmmm, this is no battle.They are in a bad position if they butt heads with each other. If this were only subordinates, there would have been a clash, but it would be unfashionable for the heads of high-ranking noble families to clash. They must have been expecting this and were planning to let their children experience it.I see. Show them the slums, show them the struggle between high-ranking aristocrats, and also show them to the other party. I don\u2019t know what their purpose is, but that\u2019s about it.Miu, the beautiful detective girl, knows exactly what I\u2019m talking about.Well, then, I\u2019m going to accomplish some of my goals. Sorry, but I\u2019m going to have to take advantage of you. I\u2019ll take that queen ant material as a thank you, okay?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is that charred wreck expensive?\u201d\u201cYes. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m just starting to learn about it, but how much is it?\u201dIt seems that Yamiyo does not know. However, when he heard us talking as if he had noticed us for the first time, Aguni Enraku turned his face towards me and showed me a grin and an athletic smile.\u201cThis stuff can\u2019t be priced, you know. I haven\u2019t seen this much monster material in a long time. I can put a price on it, but you can\u2019t get it for that price, missy.\u201dThe old man presumably was working with the Chimera, but I don\u2019t think he knew he was sacrificing the children, so with a smile I am surprised, just in case. Secretly, I want to make him pay, but I\u2019m only 9 years old. It\u2019s frustrating that beautiful girl Miu can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201cReally! That\u2019s great, Yamiyo-chan! I heard they don\u2019t come with a price tag! Is it called market value?\u201d\u201cMii-sama, it\u2019s a little different from market value.\u201dYamiyo giggles, and opens her mouth Miu is surprised, but it\u2019s not? Miu opened her mouth and tilted her head cutely.\u201cOh, thank you for the other day, Uncle Aguni. The melon was delicious. But the pricey products will get my mom and dad in trouble, so I\u2019d prefer something cheaper.\u201dI bow my head and say thank you. Miu is a good girl. She looks so innocent that her mouth relaxes, and Gahaha, Enraku smiles boldly.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be more careful from now on. Now that you\u2019ve mentioned it. I think you\u2019ll understand, but this corpse belongs to my house. And it\u2019s been knocked down by flames, too.\u201dWhile replying to me, Enraku tells the latter two, Kanna and Ouga, with a sharp look in his eyes. If they investigate this place, it should be all kinds of bad, but they don\u2019t care and ask for ownership, it seems that queen ant\u2019s material is worth that much.\u201cIt won\u2019t work, but what do you think? At this rate, we won\u2019t be able to settle the discussion. Why don\u2019t we decide to present the magic stones to the imperial family? It\u2019s limited. If so, I think it would be good if you could remember it by presenting it to the imperial family.\u201d\u201c\u2026A gift from the Aguni?\u201dEnraku ponders over Kanna\u2019s old man\u2019s words. I see. It\u2019s smart. No matter how you look at it, Kanna and Teijo are weak to claim ownership. Maybe Aguniowns this place.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. More importantly, the rest of the corpse. Let\u2019s decide on the distribution of these. I need to do some research as well.\u201d\u201cMe too. We need to find out what happened here.\u201dOld man Ouga joined in. Enraku scratched his head and sigh as if he had given up.\u201cUnderstood. This is a slum area. I don\u2019t think we can spend any more time investigating. Then, let\u2019s distribute it and finish it.\u201dHaa. They are going to finish the investigation. I saw a deal between two crooks right in front of my eyes. If they don\u2019t want to be probed any further. They should share the corpse. What kind of violent group is this? This is the nobility.It\u2019s hard to live in a world with too much openness. Do you miss the days of Tanuma? But there is nothing I can do to interfere. Mmmm, it\u2019s frustrating.But I don\u2019t want to live in a world where people don\u2019t do outrageous things like using children as bait. I don\u2019t want to give up just because it\u2019s the world of a novel. I can\u2019t do that now, though.For now, let\u2019s try to fulfill the next objective.\u201cHey, Yamiyo-chan. What is this place? There are a lot of people who seem to be in trouble.\u201dI ask an innocent question, what\u2019s a slum? Yamiyo\u2019s face turns troubled. I\u2019m sorry, Yamiyo. It\u2019s hard to answer. But the slum dwellers are looking at us from a distance. They are all people who I can tell at a glance that they are in need.\u201cI know them. People who help the needy! I wonder if I can help them?\u201d\u201cWell, yes. Some people help people in need, so let\u2019s leave it to them.\u201d\u201cYou help people in need, right? It\u2019s called an orphanage or a welfare institution!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. What do you think?\u201dYamiyo distracts me from the slums, but that\u2019s okay for now. I was going to take the conversation to the orphanage. I\u2019m sorry, I want to support the people I save, but beyond that, I just can\u2019t get around to it right now. Miu\u2019s arms are thin and short.\u201cComfort? You help people who are in trouble?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to the orphanage to comfort them!\u201dShe answered cheerfully, raising one hand. Let\u2019s go to the orphanage where I\u2019ve pushed 20 people.Miu is going to do her best. I\u2019ll give away healing magic to those who donate.What, the hero? I\u2019m a mob hero. I\u2019m just an air. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get involved. I\u2019ll just take the ring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re Going To Do Charity!Of course, being an air, Takano Miu isn\u2019t through with the main characters. This is the real world. This isn\u2019t the world of games. It\u2019s the world of a novel.\u201cHello, ladies. It\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is Kanna Yamato.\u201dHe approached me and greeted me with a beaming smile. Yes, that\u2019s right, his name was Yamato. Sorry, I didn\u2019t remember.\u201cI am Takano Miu. I am in the third grade! Next year I will be in the fourth grade!\u201d\u201cI am Teijo Yamiyo. It is an honor to meet you. Duke Kanna.\u201dI greeted him cheerfully. Miu is a good girl who can greet. Yamiyo, like a young lady in a good place, returns the greeting with a beautiful bow.\u201cMy name is Kanna Shin. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Shin!\u201dPlease give me a ring. No, it\u2019s a greeting with a smile, saying hello. Shin exudes a laid-back, good-natured air. He has a personality that seems to have no flip side. How could he grow up to be such a good-natured child from such a father? I guess that\u2019s what they call the cliche of novels.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too. I\u2019m Aguni Masatoshi.\u201dThe one who greeted bluntly was Masatoshi, who seemed ill-mannered. Well, I guess I shouldn\u2019t make assumptions based on appearances. He is only 9 years old. Even at \u2026\u2026, this guy makes me feel uncomfortable. But I feel uncomfortable with this guy. I feel like he\u2019s an inherently disagreeable human being. That\u2019s unusual.\u201cYour daughter is the daughter of a recovery magician, isn\u2019t she? The granddaughter of Count Takano\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cOjii-chan, I\u2019ve never met him, so I don\u2019t know. My Papa\u2019s, um, I\u2019m the daughter of the Viscount Takano family!\u201dI heard my father is kind of sensitive with my grandfather, so I\u2019ll smile and appeal that I\u2019m the daughter of a viscount for now.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Excuse me. You\u2019re a daughter of a viscount family. Are you the same age as Shin? That\u2019s a coincidence. The party at the imperial castle is also with Shin. Why don\u2019t you let Shin do the escorting that adults do?\u201dUnder the guise of \u201cfun,\u201d the old man tries to put Shin in charge of the escorting role. What a great guy, this old man. He\u2019s going to recommend me right after we meet?\u201cHey, hey, Duke Kanna. Don\u2019t embarrass me too much. It\u2019s good to have a good friend like that, isn\u2019t it, missy? My Masatoshi is sorry for what happened the other day. Why don\u2019t you let him be your escort as a way of apologizing?\u201dEnraku, you shouldn\u2019t recommend your son while saying that we aren\u2019t on good terms with her. Do you think I\u2019ll nod my head?I\u2019m so stunned, but I\u2019m irresistible. It reminds me of when I was a white mage in a net game. I was irresistible then, too. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re wrong in wanting a recovery magician.I was about to open my mouth with a smile to see if he would refuse when Yamiyo suddenly appeared in front of me and smiled smugly.\u201cMii-sama is unfamiliar with aristocratic society. So I will be her escort for her upcoming debut party. It\u2019s children\u2019s play, so I don\u2019t think it will be a problem.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s children\u2019s play. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dUncle Ouga rides on those words.\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. Besides Shin, he has a twin brother and a younger sister. We met here because of some kind of fate. Please come visit us next time.\u201d\u201cBoth Mi-sama and I are very happy about your offer. Thank you.\u201dYamiyo answered with a smiling face and misrepresented the story. Yamiyo\u2019s a scary girl. Isn\u2019t she 9 year old?Duke Kanna and the others did not show their dissatisfaction, but answered smilingly, then again, and walked to the queen ant\u2019s corpse. Aguni and his son were heading there, followed by Ouga. Masatoshi turned around and glanced at me andYamiyo, and I wondered what it was. He was muttering something about how big the impact was, so he must be thinking a lot for his age. He is indeed the heir apparent of a high-ranking noble family.More importantly, Shin said he was going to attend the upcoming party. I thought I\u2019d better get a fake ring ready by then.I\u2019m lucky, I think, and decided to do a charity event. Let\u2019s go to the orphanage!Two weeks later. I casually asked Yamiyo to make it to this orphanage. I didn\u2019t think she was that enthusiastic, and Yamiyo was surprised, but she still helped me, and I explained to her that I\u2019m going to do a charity event at the orphanage, and she agreed. All Yamiyo did was tell the butler that she would be asking for his help, but I was grateful. I guess the best friend you can have is a good friend.Something like 20 more kids in the orphanage, and they were having a hard time. Good, good. The orphanage is privately run, and the director is a magician. However, he is a weak magician who can\u2019t even fight.He is a thin, middle-aged man who makes magic tools and manages the orphanage. Of course, there is a subsidy from the country, but it\u2019s still great. He takes in children who get attacked by monsters, lost their families, and are alone in the world.I chose [Fight] to try it out.[A good orphanage director appeared!]And it was displayed, so it was confirmed that he was a good person. Logs don\u2019t lie. Of course, I canceled the battle by [Escape] without defeating him.There were about 50 orphans. I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s a lot of impoverishment.They had an old boarding house paid off and turned it into an orphanage. The floor is creaking, and the corners are rotten. There were leaks and drafts.The bedding is flimsy, though there is room to spare since it is a former boarding house. Yes, I felt guilty.I looked around the orphanage with a frown.\u201cPapa! I\u2019ll do my best for charity!\u201dOf course, there was no way a child could do charity work, so my parents followed me. Yamiyo and the maid. Tamamo\u2019s parents and Tamamo are with me. And many servants from the Teijo and Aburage families.In the cafeteria, the orphans sing a song, and I collect donations using recovery magic as bait. Many aristocrats invited by the Teijo family and the Aburage family gathered. At a glance, there must be 30 people. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too little. These people are rich. Donations should reach 10 million. If that\u2019s all we have, is it okay for a year?\u201cHow did you know about the charity, Em-chan?\u201d\u201cYes! I heard that you can help people in need!\u201dTamamo said with an amused face while wagging her side tail next to me. Fufun and I puffed out our lightly armored chests and became proud.\u201cCharity is a good thing, Mii-chan.\u201d\u201cTehehe.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re Going To Do Charity!I smile kindly, and my mother pats my head gently, and that makes me happy. She is a good girl. Ehemn. I am so pleased by the praise that I skip. My body moves of its own accord.\u201cWell, thank you very much. It helps. I\u2019ve been having a bit of a hard time lately.\u201dAfter the orphanage tour, I return to the cafeteria, and the director, dabbing at his sweat with a handkerchief, bows to me. Yeah, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry, okay? I\u2019ll do my best. Please forgive me.The children were getting ready to sing a song, and when they saw me, nearly half of the orphans gathered around with wows and smiles. Beautiful girl Miu is very popular.\u201cThank you for helping us!\u201dUn-un, thank you for helping me with the charity. What?\u201cWhere\u2019s Grandpa from the oden shop today?\u201dOden shop? That oden shop is run by a sleepy-eyed little girl.\u201cIn jail, cough.\u201d\u201cNever mind! I\u2019ll do my best, and you\u2019ll all do your best with your singing.\u201dI told the last kid with a lariat and a smile, and they all pulled faces and nodded. What\u2019s a prison? I mean, I was hiding my face. How did they know? Is it my voice? I\u2019ll have to get my hands on that voice changer the boy detective has the next time.I\u2019m a little surprised. The kids are scared of me. I can tell from the air. That\u2019s true. I\u2019m a little girl who kills people all the time. Strangely, they aren\u2019t scared of me.And yet they are smiling. They must be good kids.\u201cAriato~. Don\u2019t you want to be warm?\u201dThe little girl pulls my hem and thanks me with a smile. That\u2019s the girl who gets taken by the Goat Head. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s coming up to me with a smile after Odin and I killed dozens of people. That\u2019s something that makes me cry.\u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about it. I just did what I wanted to do.\u201dI can\u2019t help but smile as I stroke the little girl\u2019s head. These girls are the mob in the novel. Someone told them their friends had died, or they might have been lying around as human bones. I\u2019m glad I was able to save them.We should be friendly and help each other, same mob.\u201cMii-Sama, did you use healing magic on this girl?\u201dBefore I knew it, Yamiyo asked me strangely, but I called the other day. I\u2019m not lying.Turning to the nobles in the dining room, they\u2019re eating light dishes prepared by the Teijo family. There is no alcohol, but it looks expensive.Some of the children look like they want to eat. Hmmm, rich people\u2019s charity is such a contradiction. I think it would be better if this amount gets donated to charity, but the participants will be happy if they\u2019re entertained. It makes it easier for them to participate in the next charity. Considering that, is it a necessary expense?There\u2019s going to be a surplus anyway. I\u2019m sure we can all eat the rest.\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s all get ready!\u201dWe only had two weeks, so it was the height of recklessness, but we had to do it.\u201cOoohhh!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go for it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201dMiu held up her cute little hands to get everyone fired up, and they all shouted with smiles. They are good kids. Some may understand that the former orphans were impoverished because of the new orphans, but they are not carefree. You can see the personality of the director of the orphanage.The orphans stand on a simple stage and perform a song. They had only practiced for two weeks, but they were quite good.I\u2019m going to do my best. For now, my goal is to renew the kid\u2019s old clothes. I want to be in an environment where they can eat to my heart\u2019s content and have some snacks along the way.Using [Examine], I found that most nobles have Disease I]. Many of them were old, so they must have some illness. There were also a few with [Disease II]. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t cure that one. Sorry.So I\u2019ll put my energy into it.[Area Minor Heal II].I use range magic to let the nobles in. I heal the nobles, their faces then illuminated by the light.I\u2019m now level 41 and have plenty of MP. Of course, I have already changed my job to [Priest II] today.Those who cannot be healed by [Healing I] will only recover their strength, so please wait until the next time. I\u2019ll raise it to [Healing II].So, I used the range recovery magic many times and used the recovery from the abnormal status a lot. At first, I cast [Healing I] on them, and then ranged magic several times.The nobles looked astonished and made donations. Some people left checks, but I don\u2019t tell them that I wished they would have come back again and again, so I thought it would have been better to leave a small donation.Nevertheless, the charity event was a great success.\u201cLet\u2019s do it again next month!\u201dI felt good and called out to the children to do it every month. Next time, we\u2019ll do some recovery magic along with a play.\u201cNo, we\u2019re good for a few years.\u201dThe director said no.I don\u2019t get it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Saved Children-???\u2019s POV-The sound of tong-tong kanten and tong-kachi echoes through the orphanage.[Wall 2598 repair activated][Drying 475 activated]As the construction workers held up their disposable wands of magical tools, the hole in the wall rippled, and mysteriously, the hole was closed, and the dirt on the wall disappeared.Many construction workers visited the orphanage, and the now battered orphanage was being restored. Seeing the walls getting cleaner and cleaner, the orphans were amazed at the magic they were seeing for the first time, their mouths open, and eyes sparkling with excitement.\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing. People said it was magic.\u201d\u201cIn no time at all, the wall is getting fixed.\u201dThe children who had been in the orphanage before were delighted to see the cracks were gone and impressed by the magic power. A naughty boy shouted happily to everyone as he saw more and more futons being brought into the room.\u201cThat\u2019s a fluffy futon!\u201d\u201cThe pillows are fluffy too!\u201d\u201cLook, the sheets are also white. Not yellowed.\u201dEveryone shouted with delight at the sight of the new futon. It was the first time they had ever seen a new futon. And since it looked like they had one of their own, it was only natural that they were thrilled.\u201cIt\u2019s so smooth!\u201dSome of the children are already diving into the futon. After seeing the pleasant expressions on their friend\u2019s faces, everyone was about to dive in, including me. But with a clap of hands, the girl leading the orphanage stopped them.\u201cNo! Your dirty body will blacken the bedding. Look, they said you can take a bath today at noon. Let\u2019s clean up and make the futon won\u2019t get dirty, okay?\u201d\u201cYe~s.\u201dEveryone obediently followed the instructions of the older girl who seemed to be the orphanage leader and headed for the bathhouse. The bathhouse is quite spacious, as it is a former dormitory. The cost of the waterway is high, so we used to be able to go in only once every three days, but recently we have been able to go in every day.The construction workers are fixing up the battered orphanage, the carriers are bringing in futons, the electricians are installing air conditioners, and a TV is being set up in the dining room.Amidst the considerable commotion, the orphans make their way to the bathhouse.\u201cIt looks like there were a lot of donations from last week\u2019s charity event.\u201dA fellow girl calls out to the leader girl as she enters the bathhouse and undresses in the changing room. Her voice is happy.\u201cYeah, I guess so. I heard there was a lot. No, it sounds like there was more than a lot.\u201dThe leader girl replies as she helps the new little girl who came in the other day undress.\u201cWhat do you mean it was a lot?\u201d\u201cYou know, it\u2019s just a word. The director was pale. He said, \u2018what am I going to do with such a large amount of money\u2019?\u201d\u201cHeeh. That\u2019s why there\u2019s one more dish of rice.\u201dShe opened the sliding door and entered the bathhouse, murmuring comfortably that her fellow girls were full. Everyone else comes into the bathhouse in droves. The little girl runs a little and tries to get in, so I hold her in my arms with a wry smile and clean the dirt off her body with the hot water before getting into the bathtub.\u201cOfuro, shuki~.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019ll wash your body first.\u201dI hold down the little girl who is out of control and wants to get into the bath as soon as possible and pour hot water on her. This little girl has loved baths ever since she came here and took a bath.They fixed the bathhouse first. The floor tiles and cracked walls are clean. All the tiles had been replaced, even though some were missing, and the walls had been repaired and repainted.\u201cWell, I saw it in the Director\u2019s office.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI got into the bathtub, and my body warmed up. I exhaled and stretched my legs out comfortably. I hold the little girl in my arms as she tries to swim and tell her what I saw the other day.\u201cThere\u2019s someone in his suit. They asked the director to leave the money management to him. The director bowed his head and thanked him.\u201d\u201cYeah, isn\u2019t that a scam?\u201dA fellow girl crowded in, making the hot water ripple. If that\u2019s all it\u2019s true, she\u2019ll sound like a fraudster, and the leader girl will smile wryly and push back her companion\u2019s face when she\u2019s approaching her.\u201cIt\u2019s the guy from Charity. He\u2019s the noble butler. Te, te, he said Teikyo-ke or something like that. I think that\u2019s his identity.\u201dI scoop up some hot water, splash it on my face and wipe it off. It feels good, I think, and I brush my wet hair out of my face.\u201cHeh. A nobility, huh? What a strange feeling. We\u2019ve never had a noble come to our house before, have we?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I wonder why.\u201dThe leader girl agrees. Why in the world would we be the target of a charity event? I hate to say it, but we\u2019re smaller than most orphanages, and don\u2019t stand out in any way.Not even on my body. I touch my chest and stare at my fellow girl. They are getting the same nutrition, but there is a difference. Is this the power of genes?It has been 6 years since the monsters killed my parents. The leader of the group will be 12 years old next month. If I awakened to mana, I would have had no trouble with work, but being a genuine commoner, I never awaken it. For a time, I did the practices that ordinary children do, such as concentrating and meditating, but to no avail.Then, I thought of improving my good looks, hoping to win a ball, but I didn\u2019t have one. I lacked nutrition. It was not just her breasts. My body was too skinny, and I had no fat. It was a problem before beauty. All of my fellow orphans were similar.Yes. The most conspicuous thing is that a director is a good person, and the number of orphans has increased rapidly recently. Nearly 20 children who said they lived in the slums came. The orphanage suddenly fell into poverty.The good director was in trouble, but he was trying to make ends meet, and we decided to help. The children who came to the orphanage were skinny. We all tried our best to help them, even if it meant eating less.However, money was a difficult thing to deal with, and we watched the director\u2019s face grow darker and darker with pain. Then we heard about a charity project.We sang a song and asked for donations. We didn\u2019t expect much, but we did our best to help the director, even if only a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Saved Children-???\u2019s POV-Charity Events. Charity events jumped out at me for one reason.When I glanced at the newly arrived kids, they were normal. Their bodies, which had been scrawny, were getting bigger and better.\u201cHey, do you know why the charity event came here?\u201dThe newcomers looked at each other and shook their heads in denial.\u201cShishishishi, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cUmm, yeah, I don\u2019t know. I was lucky.\u201d\u201cGod saved us!\u201d\u201cOh, you idiot! That\u2019s a secret!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Himichu!\u201dThe little girl who swimming in the bathtub clapped her hands over her mouth in a panic. It\u2019s suspicious. These kids know why the charity event came to our house.The deception is a mess. Their eyes moved around like flying fish. But I don\u2019t think they will tell me even if I ask them. The little girl might tell me, but I don\u2019t think she would know what it means. What does God mean?\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s better if I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cUmm, yes. It\u2019s better not to know!\u201d\u201cThere are things in the world ~ we better not know. Our lives are precious.\u201dI should not pursue the matter. I don\u2019t want to get into trouble by saying unnecessary things. We don\u2019t want to poke the snake and get into the bush. Hmmm? Am I saying it wrong? Well, never mind.Let\u2019s leave the mystery as a mystery. With that in mind, I left the bath and headed for the cafeteria. After the charity event, we got one more dish added to the menu, and a snack was also served. That\u2019s great.However, we still have to cook the meals ourselves. It\u2019s hard work because we have to cook meals for 50 people. Today is Saturday, so we still have plenty of time to spare, but on days when school is in session, it\u2019s very difficult. The director does the prep work and the heavy lifting, so I can get by, but dinner is still going to be late.I rolled up my sleeves and went into the kitchen to find a strange woman. The director was with her. Who could it be?\u201cDirector-sensei. Who is that person?\u201d\u201cOh, she\u2019s a new hire. She\u2019s part-time. She prepares meals. I\u2019ll introduce her to everyone later.\u201d\u201cPart-time!\u201dI observed the woman. She is a little plump and looks kind with a smile. The leader has seen many people with a kind smile, but with a nasty bottom line. Orphans usually meet such people and are sensitive to people\u2019s ill will.Considering this, this lady seems to be a good person. A bad character is something that oozes out from somewhere.\u201cBut, Director~? If you waste money, you will have a hard time later~?\u201dNo matter how much money came in from charity, isn\u2019t he spending too much? Extravagance is the enemy in this orphanage. I would be very happy if they would give me an extra slice of sponge cake as a snack.When I stare at him with a jealous look, the director scratches his head and smiles bitterly.\u201cI know. I know what you want to say. But, you know, the Teijo family told me to show you a life you can afford with the money from the charity.\u201d\u201cA life you can afford?\u201d\u201cNot exactly an order, though. We have received considerable donations, but if we don\u2019t give you a decent life, they\u2019ll be suspicious of how we spend the money, especially the orphanage. I got a warning that it would be bad if I didn\u2019t spend it properly for the children, especially the orphanage.\u201d\u201cHuh, so much money was donated, about 20 million yen, 30 million yen?\u201dI\u2019ve never heard of such a warning. That\u2019s right.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Lend me your ear.\u201dHe whispered in my ear. I am still one of the oldest in the orphanage, and the director trusts me. But the amount of money he whispers in my ear leaves me speechless.\u201cWhat? Jee, eeeeeeeeeeee!?\u201dIt was an amount of money I had never imagined. I was speechless and stared at the director. I understood that such an amount of money would require a caretaker.\u201cI can even get you guys into high school.\u201dHe pats me on the head with my favorite smile. I see. There is now a chance that I can go to high school.I feel a warmth in my chest, and I\u2019m happy. This is thanks to the charity. I had already given up on going to high school, but if I can go on to higher education, I will do my best in my studies.\u201cDirector, charity is great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo, that charity is out of the ordinary. It was thanks to that recovery magician girl. Normally, they don\u2019t use recovery magic for free.\u201d\u201cHeh. Is that so? Then that girl is a better person than the director!\u201dWho is that girl? She seems like someone unreachable. Admiring her, I help the leader girl prepare the meal.While taking out a hunk of beef from the fridge, the leader girl sends her thanks to the pretty girl with a smile.Perhaps she was the one who saved the day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Bottomless Girl-Kazamichi\u2019s POV-The Count Takano family. Originally a prestigious family of wind magicians, the family had considerable status in this Japanese magic empire. Recently, the eldest son has strong wind magic, but is crude and has low management ability. As a high-ranking noble, he behaved arrogantly, so they lost their connections, and their business was in the red, making them a family on the decline. The eldest son\u2019s wife and children tend to spend extra money makes things worse.However, the old and famous clan stayed afloat because the family head, Kazamichi, was still alive and well. The Takano family is just a low-income family. They\u2019re still not a ruined family. There is also a rumor that if the heir succeeds him, the family certainly will fall.Kazamichi, the old but still going strong, frowned at the head of the family and took a quick sip of the sake poured into the cup.The kimono-clad samurai sitting by the room wall is silent at the sight of his grim expression. He\u2019s now in a living room with tatami mats. The old wooden table with a dull gleam that reminds one of its age, Japanese paintings, and flower arrangements create an elegant atmosphere.\u201cIt\u2019s good sake. As expected of us, the Takano family. It is hard to find such a good sake. They use magic rice, don\u2019t they?\u201dThe man sitting opposite him, holding the sake cup, laughed pleasantly. Kazamichi looks at the man and answers in a grave voice.\u201cIt\u2019s [Yougen Senmai] sake. They almost make nothing this year. The rice grown in the dungeon this year was damaged by monsters a lot, so the harvest wasn\u2019t good.\u201dThe sound of a deer prowler clanked against the open sliding door, revealing the splendid garden outside. The sky was turning from dusk to night, and the darkness of the evening was about to change.\u201cThe transportation business is still alive and well. It\u2019s a blessing to be in the black.\u201dKazamichi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly at the sound of the teasing voice. He slightly draws his mouth into a sarcastic line.\u201cThe Takano family\u2019s transportation business is second to none.\u201dThe Takano family is a prestigious wind magician family, and they have used their power to secure the top position in the transportation industry. The reason is quite simple. The Takano family manufactures large quantities of wind magic [Floats] with magical tools. This isn\u2019t a hand-made device. The head of the family creates a large-scale magic circle, and ordinary magic users use the magic circle to mass-produce it.The [Float] is what makes it so superior. It is simply magic that floats a few dozen centimeters in the air. But the magic greatly reduces the load and the consumption of magical stone energy, which in Miu\u2019s previous world would be equivalent to gasoline, to a fraction of its original value. It\u2019s not only for cars. But also airplanes with [Enchant Wind]. All of them can reduce the use of magical stone energy.Fuel costs account for a large percentage of the transportation business. By reducing the fuel cost, the Takano family has been able to lower the cost of transportation, which has given them an advantage for a long time.\u201cIf the transportation business belongs to the Takano family, even an idiot can run it. That\u2019s what I thought. I didn\u2019t think they could make up for the losses of other companies. Your son is very talented.\u201dHe clicked his tongue at his sarcastic remark. Because he was right.\u201cArashi has no talent for management at all.\u201dThe Takano family, which is at the top of the transportation industry, has used its transportation business to diversify its business. Mainly in the food industry. Like restaurants and taverns. This was also an advantage because meat and vegetables could be shipped directly from the local market at low prices.Because of the taste and other aspects, like the transportation business, they could secure better sales because they could ship directly at a low cost, but they were not at the top, and this one was in that position.But all of them are profitable simply because of the low cost. If they ran the business normally.But his legitimate son, Arashi, has been making a series of losses and closing the chain stores, no matter where he went wrong. He has no choice but to make up the money from his profitable transportation business, but it was obvious he had no talent.In a sense, he does have talent. He has a talent for taking a profitable company and turning it into a loss. Kazamichi checked to see if it was intentional and confirmed it was not.Arashi was extremely incompetent. Kazamichi was telling the truth when he said he would put his second son, Yoshiyuki, in charge. He thought Yoshiyuki would run the company better than Arashi.\u201cI should have left the incompetent eldest son as the decorative head of the family and let him concentrate on making wind magic tools. If they had put the second son in the position of the original head of the family, they would still be in peace.\u201dThe Takano family is a family that believes in the supremacy of magic power. Because the Takano family is a family of magic.\u201cIf Yoshiyuki had some magic power, there would have been no problem. But that fellow never awakened to mana at all.\u201dKazamichi growled in frustration. Kazamichi was shifting the blame to Yoshiyuki, even though he was the one who had banished him.\u201cIf I had done so, the position of head of the family would have rolled over by now. His daughter is a recovery magician. The other thing to do was to have her marry a wind user from a branch of the family, and she would have been good at the level of a general magician, and even at that level, everyone would have respected her as the head of the family. That fool!\u201dHe slammed the boar cup down on the table vigorously and revealed his dissatisfaction.\u201cOh, come on, that\u2019s terrible. You\u2019re the one who threw him out.\u201dThe one who answered in a disgusted tone was Aguni Enraku. He has fiery red hair and red eyes. He\u2019s a large man with a coarse appearance and eats the food on the table.\u201cWell, it happens all the time. But I think it\u2019s about time we made up, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI think so too. Over the years, I have graciously offered to help and have given my granddaughter many gifts. \u2026\u2026But, he refuses everything.\u201dannoyed, Kazemichi distorts his face at his second son\u2019s stubborn attitude. He will be able to return to the Count\u2019s house. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s secretly hinting that he will hand over the seat of the head of the family. What is there to be dissatisfied with? He still resents being expelled because he didn\u2019t awaken to mana.\u201cKazemichi-dono seems to be hated a lot.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that normal in the world of nobles? If your son had not awakened to mana, you would have thrown him out, wouldn\u2019t you? Enraku-dono.\u201d\u201cWell, magic is the basis of our nobility. Some too many people don\u2019t understand that. Magic is essential for making money and defeating monsters.\u201dLaughing, Enraku agreed with Kazamichi. In other words, we don\u2019t need mere humans who have not awakened to mana. There is no problem if they throw them out. In the past, it would have been even worse. After all, they would have died of illness before age 15, so it would have been better to let them go.Seeing Enraku agree with him, Kazamichi, who had regained some good moods, softened his attitude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Bottomless Girl-Kazamichi\u2019s POV-\u201cRight? The eradication is lukewarm. Magic is the keystone of the current power structure and protects humans from monsters. We cannot afford to reduce the number of magicians. Some commoners don\u2019t understand this point, and it\u2019s a problem.\u201dKazamichi shrugs his shoulders. On the one hand, the old man\u2019s words are correct. In modern society, magic technology is inseparable from science and technology. And since magic technology can only be used by magicians, magicians who possess magic technology, which forms the basis of society, will inevitably become powerful people.Magicians are also essential to fight against monsters. Monsters use an unreasonable power that isn\u2019t bound by the world\u2019s physical laws. Even an attack with a mere punching power of 30 kilograms can penetrate through thick steel armor. Conversely, even nuclear fire can be used by monsters, and some even absorb it as energy.People developed nuclear missiles in the past. They thought it to be a trump card against monsters, but the nuclear missiles\u2019 development got canceled because some monsters absorbed the energy and became more vicious. In the first place, radioactive nuclear energy was much more dangerous than the energy of monsters\u2019 magic stones.In the past, some countries tried to use magicians as slaves and tools. This was in the early days of the Industrial Revolution. It was a time when guns were so advanced that even ordinary people could easily kill someone with a gun\u2019s trigger.The development of weapons technology and the mana drive technology to extract energy from magical stones, which triggered the Industrial Revolution, led some countries to try to manage magicians on a national level.Management is just like the name. Magicians are managed like slaves and used as a trump card against monsters for magic technology advancement. The country claimed to have become a democracy with all citizens.A magician is only a man when he runs out of mana. They cannot compete with ordinary people with guns if they run out of mana. Therefore, the magicians obeyed. The commoners welcomed them with open arms and cheered for the democratic nation.The result was the collapse of the country.The strong magicians fled the country, and the magicians who followed were weak and unable to resist the monsters.As a countermeasure, the country was thinking of making it common knowledge that magicians were slaves, which would be good in the long run. This way, even strong magicians would not question it.However, people began to hide the fact that they were magicians. No one wants to be treated like a slave. As a result, the number of magicians decreased drastically. And so the country collapsed, suffering heavy losses in the face of the threat of magicians flooding the dungeons.The people realized the importance of magicians and the folly of trying to manage them.Moreover, many people in that country married commoners who did not have mana. That was because they had lived their lives hiding that they were magicians.As it turned out, almost none of the children born to commoners awakened to mana.That resulted in a decrease in the number of magicians. The verification that set in motion the destruction at the national level led to the modern recommendation that magicians marry other magicians. It sounds good to say \u201crecommended,\u201d but it\u2019s more of an unspoken agreement, almost a compulsion.Magicians are human beings, but they are not human beings. They were to be treated with care, and people were to be reminded that they were the protectors of the people and the users of magical techniques, resulting in the supremacy of the magician.If dungeons did not exist and there was no threat of magicians, the story might still be different. However, the existence of demons led to this outcome.However, in modern times, it\u2019s rare for a family to throw out a child because they haven\u2019t awakened to mana. Most of the time, because of their love for their family, they let them help with their own business and get them out of noble society, but other than that, they\u2019re an ordinary family. They don\u2019t do harsh things such as expulsion.Well, it is also true that the number of children who did not awaken to mana was almost zero. Especially among high-ranking nobles.\u201cHowever, I never thought my granddaughter would be born as Yoshiyuki\u2019s daughter who never awakened to mana\u2026\u201dKazamichi mutters in bewilderment as he reaffirms that it was the right thing to do and that it is common sense.Yoshiyuki\u2019s a person who did not awaken to mana, and the person he married is also an ordinary human. She\u2019s the daughter of a large company, but there are no magicians in her family.That is why he thought that his granddaughter would not become a magician.\u201cThey\u2019re born about once every 500 years. So, Kazamichi-dono, do you know about the recent story?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the reason why Enraku-dono visited? What is it?\u201dThe content of Enraku\u2019s story told with a grin and amusement, caused Kazamichi to gasp and look up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Abnormal Girl-Kazamichi\u2019s POV-Kazamichi took down the sake cup and stared at Enrakuraku\u2019s face. In the noble world where evil spirits of rivers and mountains roam around, it\u2019s rare for him to show his surprise and dismay.It was not an act of anger. But a sincere surprise and Kazamichi was too honest to show it.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dHe heard and listened to it. But, he asks again because the words are lies, whether it\u2019s just a joke, or because he\u2019s come in out of refusal. That man was trying to surprise Kazamichi as much as possible, and he knew what he said was true, but he still asked back.Enraku grins and laughs terrifyingly, like a predator with bait in front of it. His face seemed to rejoice at Kazemichi\u2019s astonishment, which was a shame.\u201cLike I said. Your granddaughter held a charity event at the orphanage.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. The problem is after that.\u201dKazamichi squinted, caught his breath, put his surprise deep in his heart, and asked for another explanation. His granddaughter Miu is a good person. He knew this from his research, though it\u2019s not surprising, since she gets raised as the daughter of good people, Yoshiyuki, and his family.She is popular at school among many children, both boys, and girls. The gray-haired girl, who resembles a silver-haired girl, laughs innocently and looks adorable. She sometimes shows a charisma that pulls people along with her giggles, and when she sees bullying, they say she immediately goes to the rescue.So he didn\u2019t care if she did a charity event. That girl would do it. His granddaughter would do it. He thought so. No surprises. The problem was the following words.\u201cMiu held the charity event with the help of the Teijo family. She\u2019s just a child. She said she wanted to help the people in the slums, but they switched the subject to a charity event for an orphanage, but she held the event in no time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a very big orphanage, is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a small, privately owned orphanage. It\u2019s just the right size to accommodate the whims of a child.\u201dEnraku continues to talk while munching on the meat like a carnivore. That\u2019s an attitude unique to Japanese aristocrats, who, unlike their Western counterparts, are not subject to the same fussy etiquette. Enraku\u2019s gesture is perfectly suited to his outward personality.\u201cIts orphans sing a song and dance, and Miu thought it would be nice if there\u2019s some donation. Ouga was different. He wanted to add a little to her power base, so he gathered nobles with minor illnesses.\u201d\u201cHmm, he calls a few dozen people and cures one of them of his illness. After that, she would cast recovery magic on a few of them, and that would be it. The participants wag their tails to the Teijo family so Miu would cure them at the next charity.\u201dKazamichi gulped down his sake. That\u2019s supposed to be done by the Count Takano family. We would expand their power base and revive a failing family.If they\u2019re old people or have a disability, they would choose that over an asset that can earn 100 billion, if 100 million can keep them healthy. This is especially true of the nobility. When anyone feels old, the next step is to aim for health rather than money.It is easy to imagine how good a deal a charity event like this would have been for the Teijo family.\u201cI thought your granddaughter\u2019s recovery magic is not very powerful. I guess they didn\u2019t expect her to be that good. But it turned out to be more than I expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is it true?\u201dWithout knowing it, Kazemichi gasped. He understands it\u2019s not a joke, but it\u2019s still unbelievable. Kazamichi nodded his head in disbelief. When Kazamichi heard the story, he was astonished, and repeatedly asked the person to confirm it was a lie.\u201cIt is true. Miu cast [Cure Disease] on all the participants, all 30 of them. I heard she couldn\u2019t cure some people, but used the range healing many times after that.\u201d\u201cImpossible! Recovery magic that heals disease, and poison shouldn\u2019t be usable! Even the current saint would have to rest for several days after using it once to cure an illness!\u201dKazamichi slammed the table and shouted at Enraku, his words rough. It was that unbelievable.[Status Recovery]. That\u2019s easier said than done. Even if it\u2019s called magic, it\u2019s not omnipotent. Especially with recovery magic.With offensive magic, one can say a [Powerful Word] with a vague idea of what it means, and if one has the aptitude for it, it can be activated.But Recovery Magic is different. Poison is still easy to cure. Recovery magicians can cure it with the image of counteracting poison. In the case of a disease, the mana scans the state of the target\u2019s body to get healed. What is wrong with it? It requires extreme concentration to figure out what approach to cure it. It\u2019s not about how much mana you have. It becomes a problem of mental strength.Once a recovery magician cures a disease, their body becomes tired and sluggish for some time. That was the conventional wisdom.That\u2019s until now.\u201cYour granddaughter didn\u2019t seem to have any particular need for extreme concentration. That\u2019s my researcher\u2019s estimation. But she probably only thinks of it as a simple cure for [Abnormal Status]. She was fine with the recovery magic she used.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s not possible. Isn\u2019t that just magic in action? So she\u2019s a real saint, huh? But, Yoshiyuki, what will you do if something goes wrong, such as letting her use that much magic? I see! She didn\u2019t go to a magic academy.\u201dHe wonders why Yoshiyuki didn\u2019t stop Miu from using that much magic, and soon realizes. The common sense of recovery magic is only within the nobility. They only heard recovery magicians heal other people\u2019s bodies. That was all.So, the commoners were mistaken. Recovery wizards are rare. Moreover, the number of times the magic depends on the amount of mana. Since there were very few recovery wizards, they thought only the nobles could use recovery magic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Abnormal Girl-Kazamichi\u2019s POV-Yoshiyuki probably thinks that the number of times the magic is done depends on the amount of mana. But he doesn\u2019t know that only recovery magicians are an exception. The nobles know, and they have little to do with magic themselves. The only rumors are that someone is a recovery magician. That was all they heard. It\u2019s not surprising that they do not talk about it, even though they work for the Ministry of Magic.\u201cTeijo must have paled in comparison. I\u2019m sure they had already decided behind the scenes who they were going to heal, but they unexpectedly used it on everyone.\u201d\u201cI guess. I can\u2019t keep him quiet about it. There must have been other factions among the invited nobles to show the hostile faction, right?\u201dOtherwise, there was no way Enraku would have found out so quickly. And Kazamichi immediately understood why Enraku had come to see him. They were nobles from all over the world. The earlier he thought of a plot, the better he could outwit the others.\u201cThis is an opportunity, Enraku-dono. My granddaughter is too out of the ordinary. I can no longer let her fall under another family.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Yoshiyoki is merely an official of the Ministry of Magic. That is extraordinary.\u201dThe Japanese Magic Empire wa ruled by the emperor and the nobility. The commoners are given the right to vote to reflect the opinions of the people, but in reality, it is still the same old aristocracy. He\u2019s on a different level from the Ministry of Magic\u2019s boorish officials. Laws are not applied equally to everyone.Nobles, except for fallen nobles, always have companies, large or small. The title of nobility is necessary for tax purposes. The nobles were far more privileged than commoners in terms of taxation.Therefore, Takano Yoshiyuki was an anomaly. Since the Teijo family has him in their custody, they should have given him to one of the appropriate companies for him, but they did not. They\u2019re exploiting the power of a great talent named Takano Miu.On the surface, people said the Teijo family is exploiting the power of Takano Miu. Even if the reality is different. It is easy to imagine that Yoshiyuki, a good-natured and good-hearted person, would not accept the company if it was given to him.However, it\u2019s only because he\u2019s Kazamichi that he understands this. The important point is how it would look from another person\u2019s point of view.\u201cDo you know what will happen if I tearfully complain about how the Teijo family is rubbing Takano Miu the right way?\u201d\u201cOf course, I understand Kazamichi-dono\u2019s painful situation. It must be hard for you to have to stand by and watch your only granddaughter being exploited and not be able to see her. I think it\u2019s time to make things right, and I would like to offer to mediate. The other dukes, marquises, and counts will agree.\u201dThis influential family of Japan is 36 families of 3 dukes, 3 marquis, and 30 counts. There are other count families, but there are 36 families that have a long history of wealth and power. There are exceptions, and there are earl families that replace fallen families. There are exceptions.The dukes and marquises are the most powerful among them. They each incorporate other families into their factions. However, if the Teijo family becomes more powerful than ever, there will be factions that will be wary. No, it is not difficult to imagine they would already be wary.The neutral families that have not joined a faction and the families that formed alliances with other count families to oppose the factions will not tolerate the Teijo family gaining more power.The Count Takano family is neutral. It has recently moved closer to the Dukes of Aguni, but it is an independent and self-reliant family. They do not have that much power.That is why it\u2019s a good target. Even if the Count Takano family acquires Miu, it is unlikely they will be able to expand their power to that extent. At the very least, each family would consider it better than having her stay under the Teijo family.\u201cA party hosted by the royal family to unveil the upcoming new son and daughter as nobles. Many of the families will be in attendance. Of course, Yoshiyuki will be there. I will try to have some discussions with them. This time we plan to be friendly.\u201d\u201cI will happen to overhear the conversation on my side. And when I do, I\u2019ll probably be the one to mediate. Because of my personality, and tell them to make up.\u201dThe bold and hot-blooded Enraku would not tolerate any petty quarrels. Such is the scenario. He would hold both of them by the shoulders, laugh at them, and tell them to make up.\u201cFufu, at that time, I\u2019d like to ask for your help. In exchange for reconciliation, I plan to make Yoshiyuki the next head of the family.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bold move, Kazamichi-dono.\u201d\u201cWhat, I\u2019m still young too. I can also help Yoshiyuki.\u201dKazamichi laughed, his mouth twisted into a scornful grin.The two are used to plotting and scheming, but they are also very cunning. The target was a party of the royal family. The Teijo family cannot make a fuss at a royal party. That was part of their plan. They plan to end the party with some discussion at one corner of the party.Kazamichi thought about bringing Miu into his own home.Kazamichi made one mistake.That is his son, Arashi. The man who was about to be removed as heir was a rough spender. But he had one good thing going for him.He was generous to his subordinates. He gave large sums of money to those who gathered valuable information.And the maid standing by the wall, who Kazamichi and the others weren\u2019t even aware of, secretly goes to Arashi after this.Various conspiracies would gather at the royal party. What the outcome would be, even God did not know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeking The Means To Obtain Power!-Miu\u2019s POV-The warm, glorious sunlight pours down on a two-story house standing alone on a plain. It was a peaceful world where spring was in full bloom, birds were singing, and young buds were heralding the arrival of spring.A pretty little brick house, surrounded by a low wooden fence, with its back to the forest, was flanked by a small barn, a small pond, a splendid field that could be called a kitchen garden, and a little. In the distance, a beautiful river sparkles on the water\u2019s surface, and fish jump from time to time.Beyond the river is the ocean, and a white beach. Crabs rustle, and shells lie on the beach. However, the sea breeze does not seem to reach the beach, and the crops in the fields are growing vigorously. Next to the forest, there\u2019s a 5 meter rocky hill with colorful palm-like trees, but with leaves in all colors of the rainbow.There was no other house on the wide expanse of land. There was only one house. It\u2019s a resort villa. Those who saw the house might think so. There was nothing around it.However, this house is a house that exists in another dimension. This space existed for the sake of this one house. Forests, plains, oceans, rivers, fish, and even plants.No, it did not exist for the house. It existed only for the owner of this house.It\u2019s a small world. But still a world that exists only for one person.Its name is [My Room]It is a world that exists for a beautiful girl with game specifications.Inside the house is a beautiful girl who will be in the 4th grade the week after next. She\u2019s a beautiful girl with silvery gray hair, a friendly smile, ice-blue eyes shining like sapphires, and a pretty face.She is a beautiful girl reincarnated in the world of a popular novel called [The Night of Magic], and her name is Takano Miu. I\u2019m not going to add certain characteristics because it would make her a little girl. Let\u2019s leave the word \u201cinside\u201d as the main one.The petite girl\u2019s sitting on a fluffy carpet in the spacious living room with an atrium up to the second floor. She\u2019s thinking and rolling around.She\u2019s now a master of spinning back and forth, thanks to her daily practice. I may not be proud of my mastery, but I was rolling like a car tire.Gentlemen must be flooded with requests for permission to take pictures of the beautiful girl rolling around, as they thought it was also a cute sight. In that case, I would answer that an SLR camera would be fine. The reason is that SLR cameras are now super high-end products, and I can feel their enthusiasm for photographing beautiful girls.Geri and Freki, who had turned into puppies, were running around wagging their tails in a thousand different directions, hoping Kororin Korororin and Freki would play with them around the rolling girl. Those wolves can turn into puppies. They are adorable puppies.Putting all that aside, after finishing today\u2019s routine of practicing her rolling technique, Miu wiped her sweat with the towel on the back of the sofa and dove onto the sofa with a plop. Then, in a rough, tired tone unbecoming of a beautiful girl, she muttered.\u201cAh, I want power.\u201dMiu\u2019s face, unusually protective and childish for a girl like Miu, twisted as she spoke of her recent troubles.The other roommate\u2019s face twitches in surprise at that line, and his one-eyed gaze glints.\u201cThat\u2019s unusual. Didn\u2019t your strength increase the other day?\u201dSitting on the sofa, clattering the crystal touch keyboard floating on the table and looking at the hologram-type monitor floating in the air, is Odin, the ancient Norse sorcerer, and god. He has taken off his broad-brimmed hat but still touches his shaggy chin-length white beard repeatedly, as if out of habit. The cloak he wears is old and aged, and even if he told someone he was a god, they would not admit it from his appearance, even if they were joking.To be honest, he smells poor. His indifference to appearance is befitting of a seeker who strives for wisdom.\u201cIt\u2019s not about levels. Look, there are other types of power, right?\u201d\u201cAh, power and wealth. Indeed, those are far more powerful than simple power.\u201dI look at Odin, who is looking at the monitor and blind-touching at high speed again. What\u2019s he doing?\u201cThat\u2019s a futuristic computer where you can search for adventurer\u2019s guild quests and news while you\u2019re in [My Room], right? Why are you typing on the keyboard?\u201dI tilted my head and looked at him questioningly. The beautiful girl with the curious look on her face is also adorable. Grandpa is rapidly gaining knowledge, even though he didn\u2019t know a shred of modern magic recently. His blind touch is no longer so fast that I can see afterimages.The terminal Grandpa is holding is an item for checking quests in the game for users who don\u2019t want to bother going to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild every time.\u201cMm. It\u2019s hard to live in this world without a family register. I\u2019m hacking into the government office with this terminal and making a family register for myself.\u201d\u201cYeah. Isn\u2019t that a crime? Security now not only checks for viruses but also detects suspicious activity.\u201dIt is a crime. I know because, in my previous life, I had security-related work, but this life seems to be on the same level, so it\u2019s pretty difficult. It\u2019s easy to be found out. What if they find out? Hmm? What would this house show up in the logs? Will it output IPs or something? This is a subspace.\u201cI hacked into the terminal using your house to try it out and found out that there was no IP or other intrusions route out. It seems that the network connection system of this terminal is above the technology of this world. However, since the operation remains, I ordered it not to log it at the machine control.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s the best of both worlds. You can do anything you want, right?\u201dDid he use [Machine Control] at the same time? It\u2019s too powerful not to leave a log. I can rule the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
