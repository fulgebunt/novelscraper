    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1\"... Ah?\"That day, he remembered.He had a sudden splitting headache, and it was as if a memory hidden in the back of his brain had been pried open.\".... like......I'm such a piece of shit............\"If there were people around, they would be like, \"What's this guy mumbling about?\"Fortunately, he is alone in his apartment. The garbage bags scattered around the room suggest that the room is quite dirty.\"......mmmm\"He was sitting in the middle of such a room with a pout, arms crossed, and he was thinking - how did this happen?\"Strangely, I can't remember the title, but ...... it's the guy who steals the childhood friend away from ...... the main character, right?\"What is this guy really talking about, anyone would think ......, but what happened to him can never be passed off as a joke.Because now he remembers.A memory of how things used to be, before he lived in this world.\"I see you are ...... Shishido Ryuichi.\"[T/N: I think he's talking in a 3rd POV, referring to the name of the character he transmigrated to. Honestly Idk, I'm stupid.]5Shishido Ryuichi, that is his name. No, it is both his name and another name. His name is different from when he lived in the old world, but it is a name he has been familiar with for many years now on this side of the world. He has no intention of saying anything about the name now, despite the fact that his dormant memories have been recalled.\"...... Well, just because I remembered it doesn't change anything, does it?\"The memory he recalled, the memory he now has, is that he is a character in a certain Doujin. It's an adult comic and the genre is Netorare...... and frankly, he is the guy who steals the girl that the main character is in love with.He said, \"...... Oh, sh*t, this is a pain in the ass.\"His manner of speaking is drawn to his body and rude.He stood up and looked at himself in the mirror. He is tall and blonde, his ears are pierced and his body is muscular, and he had a huge figure of a cock, which made him perfect for the role of a womanizer.\"This guy may not be the best, but he's good looking.\"He was indeed a good-looking young man looking in the mirror.He looks completely flirtatious and delinquent in appearance, but he has a well-developed face and, for the second time, a well-trained body. His stout body gives a sense of strength, which is enough to easily knock down an average woman.If you ignore the fact that he looks like a delinquent, he is really a handsome man. Well, I guess that's why he is set up to have affairs with women. ...... He would be popular if he was normal, and if you say he looks frivolous and seductive with his mouth, that's understandable.\"...... hah.\"He let out a loud sigh.It's not just the fact that he remembered that bothers him now, it's the reflection on his behavior before he remembered. It's not the bad behavior that makes him who he is, but ...... he did have relationships with women in his own way.Fortunately, he doesn't seem to have any relationships with women who have men as partners in his memories, but ...... what the hell is he doing?\"Sure, it's good now, but ...... you fall deeply in love with the heroine and then you steal her away from the protagonist. And the heroine is a woman, too, and she has a dislike for Ryuichi, who is frivolous, but she has a physical relationship with him because of a convenient development characteristic of erotic manga, or was it a fraud?\"1His body remains the same, his past remains the same, but his way of thinking changes and he is still Ryuichi and not Ryuichi, you could say. In other words, his normal thought process has awakened, and he has no taste for sleeping with anyone's woman.\"......... or maybe Ryuichi is just a screwed up guy with a messed up family.\"'I have some sympathy for the rocky relationship with the family in my memory and the backstory that was not depicted in the doujin, but it does not justify the misdeeds that followed.' He paused for a moment to stop thinking about his family, realizing that thinking about it too much would make him feel depressed.1\"Ryuichi Shishido...... something about his name makes me think that he might be getting laid.\"It's a completely non-mob name.It's a fine first and last name, and it's a tremendously memorable name. Well, if there is a test, it will be hard to write down the name each time there is one.\"Well, just because I remember, it doesn't change anything. Let's go outside.\"Ryuichi got up and headed straight for the front door, but on the way he stepped on one of the cans and took a big tumble. It was lame to see a big guy fall down so stupidly. Ryuichi decided to clean up a little when he got home.A cool breeze greeted him as he stepped outside.It was April, and he had just moved up to the second year at his current high school. This year, he changed classes, and the protagonist and heroine of the manga are also in the same class. Since he had been involved in a certain amount of flirting during his freshman year, he is looked down upon with a frown by the more serious members of his class.\"...... whew.\"A big sigh escaped him.Ryuichi did not even cover his mouth with his hand. This was a sign that he was feeling a little out of it, and that he was slightly confused and unable to accept the current situation.\"I can understand how you feel, but...\"As I felt myself, Ryuichi's appearance is that of a complete delinquent. That is why many people who pass by Ryuichi on the street look at him and move away to keep their distance. Although I am a little shocked by this, I can't help but worry about it since it has been that way until now.It was when Ryuichi was walking aimlessly through the city.\"Let go of me!\"\"It's not a big deal. Right? I promise I won't make you feel bad.\"\"Please don't!\"\"If you get too violent, I'm going to have to shut you up. ...... Hey, little girl?\"\"What?\"There was a man trying to take a girl in front of me with impunity.He looked frivolous like Ryuichi, but I knew he was older than Ryuichi. The passerby pretended not to see her and did not help her.Ryuichi had lived a life of seducing women, and he was also good at one-night stands, but this time he was different. In other words, he decides to help her.\"......Who the hell are you?\"\" Damn, look, give it up.\"The man turned to Ryuichi as he approached.Caught in the act, the woman also looked at Ryuichi and ...... her eyes widened there. The man's face surprised Ryuichi, too - because she was no stranger to Ryuichi.She had long, silky black hair that reached down her back, long slits in her eyes, a beautiful face, large breasts that raised her clothes to a man's lust, and dazzling legs that peeked out from her skirt, all of which made her very attractive.1Yes, her name was Rindo Shizuna......the same heroine that Ryuichi was going to steal from the protagonist.\"...... Shishido-kun.\"...... what the hell is wrong with you?\"Ryuichi chuckled at both Shizuna, whose eyes seemed to have had their hopes dashed, and the man who was freaked out by Ryuichi's appearance. He didn't expect either of them to look at him this way..... or even a little bit, for that matter.He took a step in and the man stepped back.Slowly approaching and looking down at the man from his tall height, Ryuichi spoke up.\"Get the fuck out of here.\"\" ha-ha-haiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!\"The man ran off at a great speed with a bounce.Ryuichi was stunned at how gutless the man was, but then he turned his attention to Shizuna, who was being tangled up next. She looked away as if she was scared, but Ryuichi nodded his head and said, \"Well, that's to be expected.\"\"I'm sorry for scaring you. I'm sure he won't be back, but just be careful on your way home.\"\"......Ah.\"1With that, Ryuichi walked past Shizuna.She didn't say a single word of thanks until she eventually passed by, but Ryuichi didn't care. But when he was some distance away, he heard a voice behind him.\" Ah, Thank you, Shishido-kun!\"\".......\"Thank you, come to think of it, I have never had that many people say that to me.I had never been thanked for my work. The most that you can do is to go to the website of the company and ask them for a few minutes of their time.3\"......ou!\"That is why Ryuichi turned his face only to Shizuna and answered that much.His expression at that moment was a smile like a young child's, and there was no doubt that it was a beautiful smile for anyone to see.\"......!\"Shizuna, who quickly turned her head away, was depressed that Ryuichi's smile was so creepy.Suddenly thrown into the manga world he knew, his story begins.We will see what kind of life he will lead, and what kind of connections he will be able to make.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2\"......she is really pretty, isn't she?\"When Ryuichi returned to his apartment, he thought back to his encounter with Shizuna.Well, she certainly had the looks of a manga heroine. She had a combination of charm that would make any man yearn for her and want to devour her body.It was frustrating, but understandable, that Ryuichi had originally fallen in love with her and had tried everything he could to get his hands on her.\"Hey, babe, do you wanna be my girl?\"\"No, I won't. I don't like frivolous men like you.\"The introduction begins with this kind of conversation.As soon as the main character's point of view is over, their exchange begins and creates this disgusting atmosphere, but soon Shizuna is attacked by Ryuichi. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the two are talking about the same thing, but in a different way.\"......haha, what a cruel world....\"Knowing what he knows about this world, Ryuichi uttered those words.He lay in bed for a while and thought about things, but he was fed up with a messy room after all the coarse and dirty mess, so Ryuichi started to clean it up. He sorted the garbage into clean garbage bags without mixing burnable and non-burnable garbage.1After cleaning for a while, it was still somewhat messy, but to a certain extent it was clean. Ryuichi thought it was okay, nodding his head, even though he had a messy room before to compare it to.\"Well then, I'm going to prepare some food.\"When it comes to cooking dinner, he basically just prepares cup noodles. When he is in the mood, he cooks a simple meal, and his eating habits are completely disordered. It is unclear whether it is some kind of adaptive power or whether his body is built that way.\"hmm?\"As he was waiting quietly with hot water in his cup of ramen, the intercom rang to announce a visitor in his room. It's not so much for Ryuichi that it's unusual for someone to come in at this hour.\"Not great timing.\"Although he knew who it was for the most part, Ryuichi still headed for the front door at once.Without checking to see who had come in, he opened the door and there she was, a very flashy woman.\"Hey Ryuichi, good to see you again.\"\"Oh, did you mention you were coming to.....?\"\"It's fine. It's just you and me, after all.\"With that, the woman went inside the house.She said, \"Huh? Isn't it a little bit cleaner?\"\"I cleaned up.\"\"Hmm, that's unusual. Well, it's still dirty.\"\"Shaddup.\"The woman sat down with a thud, as if she knew the place like anyone else.Now, this conspicuous woman was, to put it simply, like a friend. She was someone with whom he had made a naughty relationship before he regained his memory.Her name is Yomi Chisa, and she is a college student. As mentioned, she stands out as having a flashy appearance, with semi-long brown hair, and under her jacket she wears a shirt that is open at the chest, not even trying to hide her ample cleavage.\"You changed your mood?\"\"I don't know. I just thought I'd give a little thought to how I'm going to conduct myself.\"Despite not noticing the change in Ryuichi himself, it seems that others can see the change in him very clearly. Even so, Ryuichi did not seem bothered by the change and began to eat the cup of ramen he had prepared.\"You should at least cook something simple. You'll ruin your body if you keep eating that kind of food.\"\"Then cook it for me.\"\"Call me anytime. I can do that for you.\"In response to Chisa's words, Ryuichi ended the conversation by saying, \"Guess I'll do that then.\"To begin with, there seems to be no encounter between him, a high school student, and her, a college student, but there are plenty of encounters lying around if one goes out at night in the city. Ryuichi and Chisa met at a certain nightclub. Although minors are not allowed to visit the club, it is not a problem for someone as mischievous as Ryuichi.The two met there and had a one-night stand at Ryuichi's invitation. Ryuichi thought that their relationship should have ended there, but Chisa seemed to like Ryuichi a lot and the relationship continued after that.(It feels good to be able to simply play around......but would you still be able to live a straight life?)That is what a question Ryuichi asked himself.A normal high school student would not make a friend, nor would he think of sleeping with someone else's girlfriend in the first place. Well, if someone were to say that, the story would collapse, and Ryuichi's meaning of existence in this world would be completely lost.\"......it's sad that cuckolding is the only purpose I have in my existence...\"\"What?\"\"It's nothing.\"After finishing his noodle, Ryuichi then slurped down the soup.\"Now I'm finally finished,\" Ryuichi said. \"Come on, let's do it.\"\"......I think it's a little too sudden for that, you know?\"\"What are you talking about? When I look at you, I can't stand it. Do you have any idea whose fault it is that I have this kind of body?\"\"Me?\"\"Not surprising. No one gives me a better time than you do, you know?\"He never mentioned that he had set it up to be that way.Not long ago, Ryuichi would have felt better whenever he heard such words, but now that his memories of the past have returned, he does not know how to react. But still, his body was honest.\"Are you not feeling sorry for yourself in front of your peers in high school?\"\"You're the one who made me this way...come on. Hurry up!\"Ryuichi responds to Chisa's request because even though his awareness switches, it does not change the way he has been living his life.\"I knew you were the best. Most women would be so nervous to be embraced by a body like this.\"And when things were over, Ryuichi lay down and took Chisa in his arms.For Ryuichi, who generally doesn't get along with serious guys and hangs out with outcasts, Chisa was an easy woman to get along with, even if she was also a member of the same group. She was easy to deal with because she accepted that Ryuichi was this kind of person and continued the relationship with him.\"Chisa is popular in college, right? But I guess I'm pretty much beyond jealous when I can do whatever I want to you.\"\"You don't care about that, do you?\"\"True.\"Ryuichi nodded in agreement.A certain amount of change in awareness does not change the way one lives, Ryuichi had always believed. This remained true even after he embraced Chisa and she left.But it wasn't long before a change occurred in his daily life.\"Good morning, Shishido-kun.\"\"......Good morning.\"The following day.Ryuichi went to his high school and joined his class and was still viewed by the others from a distance, until he was approached by the heroine, Shizuna.The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the two of them have been in the same school together for a couple of years now. As if that normality was broken, Shizuna called out to Ryuichi as he came into the classroom.\"Shizuna?\"Shizuna's childhood friend and the protagonist of the world was also staring at Shizuna's behavior in disbelief. More bewildered than them, however, was Ryuichi. Even with the fact that he had saved Shizuna, he never thought for a moment that he would get involved in such a public place.\"Shishido-kun, thank you for yesterday. You were a great help.\"\"I received a thanks yesterday, right? No need for it anymore.\"\"I'm supposed to say it, right? Yesterday I thought it was rude of me not to thank you for that......right away.\"'You are too sincere,' Ryuichi muttered in his mind.1And talking to her on a normal topic like this was something that was not depicted in the manga. Originally, Ryuichi got involved with her for one reason: he wanted to have everything of her.\"Isn't it normal to be straightforward?\"\"......No, I don't think that's what I meant.\"The way he has lived his life up to now has created the kind of person he is, but of course Ryuichi has no intention of talking about that much, even with Shizuna. But still, Ryuichi was worried that he was losing his temper. It was a new experience for him, because in the first half of the encounter, the only expression on Shizuna's face when she looked at Ryuichi was one of disgust and fear, not to mention the other half, when she was in the throes of her pleasure.\"Come on, you go back to your seat. Your beloved childhood friend has been watching you the whole time.\"\"He's not like that,\" she said. \"Well, all right. Shishido-kun, I'll speak to you later.\"\"There's no such thing as 'again,'\" Ryuichi muttered, but Shizuna didn't hear him.Ryuichi let out a weary sigh, not expecting that their chance encounter would change the impression Shizuna had of him in such a way.+Meanwhile, the main character was staring intently at him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3A Dormant AbilityTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Somebody\u2019s staring an awful lot at me.\u201dRyuichi quietly muttered to himself as he did his best to stifle a yawn. Second period had just ended, but he could still sense a piercing gaze on him during break time. He sighed, having a vague idea as to who these stares were from.\u201cMust be the protagonist, huh\u2026\u201dRyuichi wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but he was relatively confident that he was right. This world\u2019s protagonist was called Shinozaki Souhei; he had looks so unremarkable that one might mistake him for a mere mob\u2014a side character.\u00a0But, well\u2026I guess that\u2019s the defining trait of a protagonist.\u201cGuess I\u2019ll head to the toilet.\u201dStill feeling his gaze on him, Ryuichi got up from his seat. As he made his way out of the classroom, he stole a glance at him\u2026and their eyes met perfectly. He seems to have been influenced by the fact that Shizuna spoke to Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dWhile in the restroom, Ryuichi thought about this world once more. The current month was still April, while the main storyline would begin before the summer vacation. Just before the summer vacation began, Ryuichi and Shizuna would have sexual relations with each other; then, during the long vacation, Shizuna would thoroughly be trained to become a woman to Ryuichi\u2019s liking.\u201cPeople really do change, don\u2019t they?\u201dShizuna had the looks of a Yamato Nadeshiko and a naughty body that completely contrasted her pure looks. After the summer vacation, however, she dyed her hair blonde and even changed the way she dressed herself, such that her attire was barely in line with school regulations.Both versions of Shizuna had been drawn beautifully, perhaps a testament of how skilled the illustrator was. Nevertheless, Ryuichi\u2019s preference lied overwhelmingly for the current Shizuna. Before he regained his memory, he preferred the flashy and gaudy types, but now that he has regained his memory, his tastes shifted towards pure and upright girls.\u201cWell, not like any of that matters.\u201dThe main story starts before summer vacation, which means that is when Shinozaki and Shizuna will start dating. This is why Shizuna said earlier that she didn\u2019t see Shinozaki that way. It\u2019s because she is still unaware of her love for Shinozaki.Ryuichi left the restroom after doing his business, but while he was walking down the hallway, the other students constantly shunned and avoided him. Sadly, Ryuichi had already gotten used to this familiar sight.But even a man like Ryuichi had someone who\u2019d call out to him.\u201cYo. Had to take a dump or something?\u201d\u201cHell no.\u201dWhen he returned to the classroom, he was approached by another flamboyant boy similar to him. His name was Fushimi Makoto, a fellow outcast and Ryuichi\u2019s close friend. He\u2019d used the word \u201coutcast\u201d to refer to him, but Ryuichi was no better; plus, Makoto, too, had a decent level of academic ability. It was a mystery how these two boys had considerably high specs.\u201cIt\u2019s not every day I see Rindo talking to you. Did\u2019ya fuck her?\u201d\u201cNo, I ain\u2019t done nothing to her.\u201dRyuichi responded to Makoto\u2019s straightforward words with a look that said he was being a pain in the ass. Ryuichi didn\u2019t know about his other friends, but he knew for sure that Makoto would ask him this. After all, even Ryuichi\u2019s friends thought it was very strange to see him and Shizuna together since they barely had anything to do with each other.\u201cCoz y\u2019know, if you\u2019d fucked her up, I was thinking of asking you for your leftovers. There ain\u2019t many girls in our grade as cute as her.\u201d\u201cYou never change, do you?\u201dHe practically lives according to the whims of his lower half,\u00a0Ryuichi thought, but Ryuichi wasn\u2019t in a position to make fun of him since he was the same way until just the other day. Also, what he\u2019d said earlier wasn\u2019t an excuse or anything; there really was nothing between him and Shizuna, so he felt like there was nothing in particular to tell him.Makoto also seemed to have guessed from Ryuichi\u2019s mannerisms that there really was nothing going on, so he left the topic at that.\u201cBy the way, Ryuichi. There\u2019s gonna be another party at that club again sometime soon. You comin\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dThat club was where Ryuichi had met Chisa. It was a party where lots of guys and girls would get together on a regular basis and\u2026well, they\u2019d pick out anybody they fancied to have a one-night stand together. Basically, you can think of it as a typical shady, underground party.\u201cNope, I think I\u2019ll lay off the parties for a while.\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201dMakoto\u2019s eyes widened in genuine surprise at Ryuichi\u2019s response. At this stage, Ryuichi knew very well what kind of image he had, but ever since he regained his memory, he had lost interest in going to such places.\u201cYou, an infamous sex fiend, skipping out on a party? I wonder if pigs are going to start flying tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d\u201cMy bad, my bad.\u201dHe apologized and laughed.\u201cI\u2019m just saying, I think you\u2019ve changed. You have a different air about you these days. Of course, the old you was good too, but I\u2019d say the new you is better in many ways, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cChisa said something like that to me, too.\u201d\u201cI thought so. Anybody who really knows you will tell you the same thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hrm.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like Ryuichi had changed the way he spoke, and he couldn\u2019t say anything about the \u201cair\u201d around him either since he himself didn\u2019t know how he looked to others. Leaving aside the fact that they were friends whom he\u2019d met under impure circumstances, both Makoto and Chisa had told him the same thing, so the air around Ryuichi must have really changed.\u201cWell, if you ever decide to come, just let me know, \u2018kay?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI\u2019ll never be changing my mind, though. I\u2019m definitely not going.\u00a0Ryuichi managed to swallow those words.Time passed, and it was now after school. Ryuichi was the only one still left in the classroom, probably because he had fallen asleep on his desk when the end-of-school assembly started.\u201c\u2026Nobody had the heart to wake me up\u2026though I wouldn\u2019t expect otherwise.\u201dStrangers would never think of talking to or calling out to someone with Ryuichi\u2019s looks, so in a sense, this was how things ought to be.He stood up with his bag, which did not contain any study materials, and suddenly turned his attention to a vase of flowers. There were beautiful flowers in it, but the water they very much needed for nourishment was dirty.\u201cWhat the hell is the day duty guy doing?\u201dChanging the water for the flowers was the job of the student on day duty, but it seems that said person did not do that job today. Although it wasn\u2019t good to jump to conclusions since they may have simply forgotten, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but sigh as he picked up the vase.\u201c\u2026Oh? Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dHe was about to head out and change the water in the vase when an unexpected encounter occurred. It was Shizuna. Carrying a bag on her back, she seemed surprised as she looked back and forth between Ryuichi and the vase.\u201cThought you already went home.\u201d\u201cUm, yes. I just forgot something\u2026 Why are you holding that vase, Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cThe guy on day duty forgot to change the water for the flowers. I didn\u2019t want the water to stay dirty, so I thought I\u2019d change it myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes were wide in amazement when she heard Ryuichi\u2019s words, seemingly as if she was doubting what she\u2019d heard. It wasn\u2019t something Ryuichi usually did\u2026in fact, it was something he\u2019d\u00a0never\u00a0done before. It was all the more reason why he felt slightly uncomfortable being stared at like what Shizuna was doing.\u201cIs it wrong for me to do this?\u201d\u201cHuh?! No, of course not! I just thought this was quite unlike you\u2026\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026\u201dRyuichi laughed at Shizuna\u2019s honest apology. He walked past Shizuna and headed out to change the water, only to find that Shizuna had also left her bag behind and followed him.\u201cWhy\u2019re you following me\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust because\u2026I guess?\u201dHe could tell it\u2019d be hard to refuse her, so he allowed her to follow him. Once they reached their destination, Ryuichi put down the vase and rolled up his sleeves. In doing so, his tanned, thick, and muscly arms came into view.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNeither of them said anything to each other as they passed the time in silence. After replacing the dirty water with fresh, new clean water, Ryuichi could see the flowers visibly regain their vitality and spirits. Ryuichi smiled with satisfaction in having done his job well, while Shizuna dazedly stared at him again.\u201c\u2026I guess rumors really are just that: rumors.\u201d\u201cRumors?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve heard on many occasions that you\u2019re the worst delinquent in the history of our high school, and that you are second to none in terms of how unruly your personality is.\u201d\u201cWell, they aren\u2019t really off the mark.\u201dThose whispered rumors weren\u2019t entirely wrong; Shizuna simply did not know Ryuichi well enough. She could only say what she did because she had no idea what Ryuichi has done or how he spends his time.\u201c\u2026But I think you\u2019re a very kind person, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cCut it out. I\u2019m anything but that.\u201d\u201cFufu, whatever you say. Just know that people who are truly unkind wouldn\u2019t say what you just did.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026\u201dRyuichi scratched his head, wondering where things had gone so wrong. As if to instill a little caution in her, or to let her know what kind of person he was, Ryuichi pressed Shizuna against the wall.A slamming sound rang out as he placed his hand next to Shizuna\u2014he was doing the infamous\u00a0kabe-don.\u201cS-Shishido-kun\u2026?\u201d\u201cBetter not get too comfy with me. You never know when I might pounce on you.\u201dRyuichi let a naughty grin show on his face, like a true delinquent. But then, something strange happened. Instead of running away, Shizuna looked straight back into Ryuichi\u2019s eyes with red, flushed cheeks.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dRyuichi suddenly recalled a certain, important detail. In the storyline, Shizuna was indeed assaulted and corrupted by Ryuichi, but she herself had deep, masochistic tendencies lying dormant within her. Ryuichi, in typical, doujin-like fashion, awakened this latent skill of hers\u2026\u00a0But surely that couldn\u2019t be happening now.\u00a0Ryuichi shook his head in denial.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading home now.

For some reason, it seems that Shizuna was now calling out to him more frequently than before.He himself had never called out to her, but she made up for it by proactively trying to close the gap between them. Whenever she saw Ryuichi entering the classroom, Shizuna would immediately walk up to him, say good morning, then walk back to where she came from. Of course, not even Ryuichi could say he found this unpleasant, but nevertheless, he sighed and thought to himself that nothing good would come out from her being involved with a man like him.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dOne day, while Ryuichi was on his way back from the restroom, he overheard Shizuna talking to her classmates from around the corner.\u201cHey, Shizuna. Did Shishido do something to you?\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cI mean, haven\u2019t you been acting weird lately? Up until a few days ago, you\u2019d never really talked to him before, but now you\u2019re proactively trying to approach him\u2026 It\u2019s really suspicious, you know?\u201dRyuichi wore a bitter smile on his face, wishing that they\u2019d chosen to talk somewhere else where they\u2019d have no chance of being overheard, especially by the person in question.\u00a0It\u2019s a pain in the ass, but I guess I\u2019ll kill some time somewhere else.\u00a0Just as Ryuichi was about to leave, however, he stopped dead in his tracks. As for why, well, it was because he heard Shizuna speak in a severely harsh tone.\u201cShishido-kun isn\u2019t deceiving me in any way. I\u2019m just trying to get closer to him of my own volition, plain and simple. I can\u2019t deny that there are many unsavory rumors about him; after all, he too didn\u2019t deny them. However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s reason enough to push him away. We\u2019re classmates, and besides, he\u2026no, the point is\u2014\u201dShizuna had been desperately trying to appeal to her friends about Ryuichi for quite some time now. But unsurprisingly, getting her point through to the other girls was easier said than done. Shizuna was the only one who knew that he had saved her in the city and that he had changed the water in the vase.\u201cWelp, guess I shouldn\u2019t keep waiting here forever.\u201dRyuichi scratched his head as he stepped out from the corner. Shizuna, whose back was turned against him, didn\u2019t notice him, but the other girls who were facing Shizuna clearly noticed his presence.\u201cAh\u2026 Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShizuna swiftly turned around. Her eyes immediately lit up and sparkled when she saw Ryuichi, though he himself had no idea why. Under normal circumstances, she should\u2019ve had a disgusted expression on her face instead of this one.As a matter of fact, Ryuichi had actually done some thinking about various things. What if the NTR in the manga was only superficial, and she actually had a liking for Ryuichi like she did now? But no, that was impossible; it was clearly stated in the manga that Shizuna absolutely loathed Ryuichi. In other words, the Shizuna of this world had deviated slightly from the Shizuna of the original work.\u201cAre you on your way back from the restroom, Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cYep. Just got finished with my business when I overheard you guys talking about me. Made it hard for me to just walk by, y\u2019know?\u201dRyuichi shifted his gaze to the girls who brought up the subject, causing them to look down awkwardly. He wasn\u2019t even glaring at them, but they seemed scared out of their boots, which made Ryuichi heave a sigh.\u201cI\u2019m not really mad at y\u2019all or anything. It\u2019s only natural for y\u2019all to have that sort of impression of me. If I dyed my hair black and removed my piercings, would you be less scared of me?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh~\u2026 Maybe, I guess?\u201d\u201cBlack hair really doesn\u2019t suit your image, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026Awfully blunt now, are we?\u201d he remarked.But thanks to this icebreaker, the girls seemed to have let their guard down a little bit. There was still some amount of fear visible in their eyes, but they seemed to be very receptive to Ryuichi\u2019s change.\u201cEven I don\u2019t want to get involved with others more than necessary. It\u2019s why I\u2019d rather see Rindo go back to how she was before.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t do that now that I\u2019ve already gotten to know you, Shishido-kun. I really enjoy talking to you, you know?\u201d\u201cYou know you\u2019ve got seriously bad tastes in people?\u201d\u201cOh, really now?\u201dTheir back-and-forth banter was so amusing that the other girls ended up smiling at them in unison.On that note, though, whenever Ryuichi talked to Shizuna like this, he would always sense a certain somebody\u2019s gaze on him without fail. But this time, he couldn\u2019t feel anything at all.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Shizuna tilted her head to the side and asked. But, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t really tell her that she was the cause of his worries.\u201cY\u2019know, you\u2019re pretty different from what the rumors say about you.\u201d\u201cI know, right? And if you look past his scary looks, he\u2019s actually kinda hot, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cToo late to start wooing me now, girls, ya hear me?\u201d\u201cAhaha! Don\u2019t get too ahead of yourself, Mr. Narcissist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHee hee hee!\u201dThere was no longer any trace of the oppressive atmosphere from before. Ryuichi, a man who used to look down on others, intimidate them, and judge them, especially women, was now more outgoing, and his expressions were more varied and alive. This, coupled with how out of character this was for him, was clearly the result of the change in Ryuichi\u2019s character.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna head back to the classroom, \u2018kay~?\u201d\u201cAlright. See you.\u201dShizuna stayed behind as she watched her friends leave for the class.Ryuichi stared at Shizuna.\u00a0\u2026Why are you staying here?\u00a0his gaze seemed to say.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at me like that, do you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why\u2019re you talking so much to me lately?\u201dIt was a straightforward question. Shizuna\u2019s eyes widened a little, as if she hadn\u2019t expected such a direct inquiry. After a while, she looked back at Ryuichi and replied.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just feel like I\u2019ve learnt things about you that no one else has before\u2026 So, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s normal for me to want to know you more?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hell if I know.\u201dHe truly didn\u2019t understand her motives. Shizuna puffed her cheeks out which, come to think of it, was yet another new expression Ryuichi had never seen from her before. He gave a wry smile and, seeing this, Shizuna\u2019s expression also gave way for a joyful smile.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s head back. It ain\u2019t gonna be good if we end up late for class.\u201d\u201cThat line really doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\u201cOh, shut up.\u201dAt the very least, Ryuichi didn\u2019t dislike his conversations with Shizuna.Then, after school, an event happened that would bring Shizuna even closer to Ryuichi.\u201cShishido-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019re seeing each other an awful lot today, aren\u2019t we?\u201dShizuna laughed at Ryuichi\u2019s narrowed eyes and told him it was a coincidence. The two of them had met at the shopping district; it seemed that they\u2019d been in the middle of shopping for dinner groceries when they bumped into each other.Well, in Ryuichi\u2019s case, he wasn\u2019t actually buying anything other than cup ramen, and Shizuna, of course, noticed this as well.\u201cYou\u2019re only buying cup ramen?\u201d\u201cYou makin\u2019 fun of these? They\u2019re hella good, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d\u201cI know they\u2019re delicious, and I\u2019m not making fun of them.\u201dAll one had to do was pour in hot water and wait three minutes, and out came a delicious meal. Ryuichi owed so many of his dinners to cup ramen that he oftentimes marveled at the sheer ingenuity of mankind. However, this cup ramen episode would turn out to be the starting point for everything else.\u201cWhat are you having for dinner, Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cCup ramen.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Cup ra\u2014Wha?\u201dShizuna was so dumbfounded, her jaw dropped in amazement. Ryuichi tilted his head, wondering what was wrong.\u201cHaving cup ramen for dinner\u2026? I mean, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad per se, but isn\u2019t that bad for your\u00a0body?\u201d\u201cOf course it ain\u2019t healthy. But what can I say, I\u2019ve already been havin\u2019 it for years now.\u201d\u201cYears\u2026?\u201d\u201cCoz\u2019 I live all by myself. Stuff happened, and my parents are gone. If I ain\u2019t gonna cook, obviously I\u2019d eat these.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dThat was when Ryuichi realized. Even if he\u2019d wanted to explain his circumstances, he shouldn\u2019t have brought up such a taboo topic; that is, his parents being gone. Sure, Ryuichi himself may not have minded others knowing, but it certainly couldn\u2019t have been a pleasant thing for the listener to hear.\u201cOh. Sorry for talkin\u2019 about all that unpleasant stuff.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Don\u2019t be.\u201dShizuna seemed saddened after learning of Ryuichi\u2019s sad circumstances, and that his parents were gone. Seeing this, Ryuichi chuckled. He reflexively reached for Shizuna\u2019s head\u2026before eventually patting her shoulders instead.\u201cC\u2019mon, why the sad face? You\u2019re ruining your good looks. Turn that frown upside down.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shishido-kun.\u201dShizuna was truly a kind-hearted girl, just as one would expect from a person bearing the title of main heroine.Their encounter today was just a coincidence, and that was supposed to be the end of it. However, just as Ryuichi was about to leave, Shizuna took hold of his hand.\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dSeemingly having made up her mind, she spoke to Ryuichi with a serious look in her eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll make dinner for you. Take me to your home, Shishido-kun.\u201dOf course, Ryuichi\u2019s reply was instant.\u201cNo.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Meat and Potato Stew is Delicious!Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was sunset when Ryuichi arrived at his apartment. It was no exaggeration to say that this was the place where he felt most at home. However, today, there was a slightly different scene than usual.\u201cSo this is the apartment you live in, huh.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna curiously looked around the building while Ryuichi heaved a heavy sigh.In the end, Shizuna followed Ryuichi all the way to his home. She\u2019d held tightly onto his hand and wouldn\u2019t let go. Of course, Ryuichi could\u2019ve just forcibly shaken her hand off, but he didn\u2019t want to do anything too rough to her. And so, that was how Shizuna\u2019s visit came to be, albeit half-forcibly.\u2026This girl\u2019s got an impulsive streak in her, doesn\u2019t she?Ryuichi could never have predicted that she would visit his apartment before the main storyline began; a time that, by all rights, should\u2019ve been uneventful and ordinary. Although she had talked to him a little more frequently as of late, it was by no means enough of a reason to justify her lack of caution in coming to the room of a man living alone; it was so alarming that it made Ryuichi worried for her.\u201c\u2026You should seriously go home. C\u2019mon, I\u2019ll walk you there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already come all the way here, so no. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cGive me a break\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Umm\u2026 Do you really hate me being here that much?\u201dRyuichi heaved yet another huge sigh. Well, it wasn\u2019t like this was his first time bringing women to his room like this. Many women, including Chisa, had been here before. Ryuichi decided that Shizuna was just another one of those.\u201cJust a heads up; the room\u2019s gonna be a\u00a0little\u00a0bit dirty.\u201dAnd with that, Ryuichi opened the door. As soon as he did, a pile of garbage bags laid spread out before the pair. It wasn\u2019t an amount big enough to crowd the room, but at least for a girl like Shizuna, it was a shocking sight.\u201c\u2026It really is dirty.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I gave you the heads up.\u201d\u201cThis is definitely more than just \u2018a little bit\u2019!\u201dRyuichi scratched his head and told her this was a lot better than what he had been used to. The two of them went straight inside, and the first thing they did was, of course, clean up the trash.\u201cThis goes there, and that one goes there.\u201d\u201cRoger that.\u201d\u201cAs for this one\u2026just throw it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAlmost like a servant following Shizuna\u2019s orders, Ryuichi did what he was told to do in a straightforward and brisk manner. There was nothing indecent or erotic in their actions; both of them simply spent their time cleaning. Once they finished, the room had become so clean it was hardly recognizable from its previous state.\u201cWow, my place looks like a luxury condo now, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYour room was just too dirty. This is how it\u2019s\u00a0supposed\u00a0to be.\u201dThis time, it was Ryuichi who was admiring the polished room while Shizuna sighed. She took her eyes off Ryuichi and spread out the ingredients she had bought. Originally, these ingredients were going to be used for Shizuna\u2019s dinner, but it looked like she was going to use them for Ryuichi instead.\u201cIs this really okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I told my mom I had to cook at a friend\u2019s house on short notice.\u201d\u201c\u2026Now I\u2019m really worried.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Now then, it\u2019s time to start making dinner.\u201dIt was refreshing to see someone other than Ryuichi standing in the now clean kitchen. Ryuichi almost lost himself staring at her, but he felt slightly uncomfortable now that he had nothing to do.\u201c\u2026Ugh. Hey, Rindo. Anything I can help with?\u201d\u201cShishido-kun, you clearly can\u2019t cook. Go sit and wait.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dRyuichi had a body more robust than most people his age, but even he was helpless when it came to cooking. When Shizuna told him to wait quietly, he obeyed her words and sat down dejectedly.\u201cHmmm~\u266a\u201dRyuichi stared at Shizuna, who\u2019d started humming a tune as she cooked. Their eyes met several times, and Shizuna smiled and continued cooking. Soon, a home-cooked meal, the first Ryuichi had had in a long time, was spread out in front of him.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cHere you go. It\u2019s nothing much, but please enjoy.\u201dSince it would take too much time to cook up enough side dishes, Shizuna had settled on making\u00a0nikujaga,\u00a0a stew consisting of meat and potatoes. Ryuichi\u2019s stomach rumbled as the delicious aroma of the meat and potato stew tickled his nose. It was served with plain white rice and miso soup, but even then it still looked like a very luxurious meal to Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026Thank you for the meal.\u201dHe put his hands together properly in thanks and quickly extended the tip of his chopsticks to the stew. He grabbed a potato and slowly brought it to his mouth, and immediately, the sweetness of the potato spread throughout his mouth, and Ryuichi\u2019s eyes lit up as he popped more and more into his mouth non-stop.\u201cIf you shovel your food in too fast, you might choke on them, you know?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fi\u2014Guh?!\u201d\u201cSee? What did I tell you?\u201dExasperated, Shizuna passed a cup to him, and Ryuichi hastily chugged it down. He coughed and wheezed multiple times as she rubbed his back, yet despite her earlier exasperation, her cheeks soon relaxed and she broke into a smile.\u201cIs it that delicious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely incredible. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve last had something this good.\u201dIt was truly a tasty meal, as evident by the look on Ryuichi\u2019s face. Shizuna started eating together with Ryuichi, and soon the white rice and miso soup, including the meat and potato stew, were gone. Although Ryuichi was the one who ate most of the stew, Shizuna had no qualms with it and was even smiling the entire time, probably because he had eaten it so heartily.\u201cThat was really good\u2026 Heh, I envy the man who\u2019ll marry Rindo Shizuna in the future.\u201d\u201cGeez, what are you saying all of a sudden\u2026\u201dSeeing Shizuna\u2019s blushing face, a hint of mischief grew inside Ryuichi. He reached out, grabbed her arm, and pulled her body toward him.\u201cKyah?!\u201dHe held Shizuna\u2019s body in his thick arms. For Ryuichi, the only purpose of taking a woman up to his room was for her body. However, he was not doing this to Shizuna with that in mind; it was merely a prank.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll devour\u00a0you\u00a0next. Y\u2019know, you came all the way to\u00a0my\u00a0home knowing full well what people say about me, so I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t mind if I push you down right here and now, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ahh\u2026\u266a\u201dRyuichi couldn\u2019t help but wonder why her reaction was different from what he was expecting. In fact, he recalled having slept with a woman who\u2019d reacted similarly to Shizuna before. In any case, he couldn\u2019t comprehend her reaction no matter how hard he thought about it, so he let go of her.\u201cYou do realize, Rindo, that I\u2019ve been having relations with a bunch of women.\u201d\u201c\u2026So it is true.\u201d\u201cYep. Right now I\u2019m only seeing one person, though\u2026but anyways, that\u2019s just the kind of person I am.\u201dHe was trying to give a warning to Shizuna, who was too kind for her own good.\u201cThe meat and potato stew was delicious, and I thank you for that. But you shouldn\u2019t carelessly follow a man to his home, especially one who lives alone. You\u2019re lucky that man happened to be me this time, which is kinda strange coming from me, but still\u2026 There are plenty of boys who have their eyes for you. The moment you let your guard down, you\u2019ll instantly get devoured by them.\u201dShizuna\u2019s body jumped and shivered. Seeing this, Ryuichi decided that he had admonished her enough; he gave a wry smile and took out some money from his wallet.\u201cHere, money for the ingredients you used. Don\u2019t you dare say you won\u2019t take it. Even I\u2019d feel bad if I didn\u2019t pay you back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Fufu, okay. I\u2019ll take it.\u201dNo matter what form it took, it was best to clear up any money you owed or borrowed from others before you forgot. Even if it was just for making dinner, letting a girl in his class spend money for him was something Ryuichi wouldn\u2019t allow.\u201cBut man, you really surprised me, y\u2019know? I never would\u2019ve thought you were such an impulsive person. Normally, you\u2019d never do something like this.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026but I just couldn\u2019t leave you be. Of course, it may have been annoying from your point of view, but\u2026actually, no, I\u2019m sorry. In the end, this was all because of my selfishness.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re also too kind to a fault. I swear, you\u2019re going to get tricked one of these days.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not that much of an idiot, okay?!\u201dHer expression, which frequently changed from one moment to the next, as well as her beauty and friendliness were the hallmarks of a quintessential heroine. They talked for a while longer before Ryuichi decided to walk Shizuna to her house.\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cHow many times have we had this conversation? C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u201dRyuichi left the room first. Shizuna also came out of the room in a hurry a moment later, but soon matched Ryuichi\u2019s stride and walked beside him.\u201c\u2026Hey, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not letting you come over to my place anymore.\u201dShizuna puffed her cheeks out after having been beaten to the punch by Ryuichi. Apparently, she\u2019d wanted to ask if she could come again. Of course, Ryuichi would love to be able to eat a variety of her dishes again, including her meat and potato stew\u2026but he still thought it necessary to draw a line in the sand. That\u2019s why both of them should forget about today and go back to how things were. He tried to convince Shizuna that this was the right thing to do.\u201c\u2026Even though you forcefully embraced me.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, what kind of nonsense are you pulling now?\u201d\u201cAm I wrong, though?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe certainly had a point. Even though she hadn\u2019t resisted, there was no doubt he\u2019d embraced Shizuna with his thick arms. Her reaction had been slightly suspicious, but it must\u2019ve been embarrassing nonetheless.\u201cI wonder what\u2019ll happen if I tell everyone at school about this?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re a stubborn one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cFufu\u2026 So, does that mean I have your permission to come back?\u201d\u201cYou better not come crying to me if people find out and bad rumors start spreading at school about you, you hear me?\u201d\u201cGot it! \u266a\u201d\u201cDoes this girl\u00a0really\u00a0get it\u2026?\u201dThis time, it was Ryuichi\u2019s turn to stare at Shizuna in exasperation.Her smile was so beautiful in the moonlight, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but briefly admire it in fascination.\u00a0I see. This\u00a0does\u00a0make me want to NTR her,\u00a0he thought to himself.\u201c\u2026Rindo.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026See you next time.\u201d\u201c?! \u2026Okay!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6A Small FissureTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201dAfter Ryuichi walked Shizuna to her neighborhood, she managed to make it home safely without incident. She turned around once before the front door closed, but of course he was not there. After all, they had parted the moment her home came into view, so he should be on his way home right about now.\u201c\u2026Shishido-kun.\u201dWhen Shizuna whispered his name, she felt an inexplicable warmth enveloping her heart. She would have never felt this way had she not been rescued by him from the ill-natured playboy that had tried to hit on her just the other day. She originally knew about Ryuichi because he was a classmate of hers, and she\u2019d heard numerous bad rumors about him, which Ryuichi himself had affirmed.Because of Shizuna\u2019s upright personality, the only impression she\u2019d ever had of him was that he was somebody she would never get involved with. However, in reality, the Ryuichi she\u2019d talked to was completely different from what the rumors said. Of course, even he didn\u2019t deny them, so they were likely true, but even so, Shizuna recognized Ryuichi as a classmate she could undoubtedly trust.\u201c\u2026I had so much fun today.\u201dShe let out a chuckle as she recalled the day\u2019s events.Even she couldn\u2019t say for sure why she had gone to such lengths earlier, but one thing she did know was that she simply couldn\u2019t leave him be. She couldn\u2019t help but reach out to him when she imagined him at home, alone, eating cup ramen all by his lonesome.\u201c\u2026I wonder what this feeling is.\u201dRyuichi himself had had no qualms about eating alone, and she definitely hadn\u2019t done it out of a sense of pity. She just wanted to do something for him. She wanted to thank him for saving her\u2026but more than that, she wanted to stay by his side\u2014he, who was brusque yet kind.\u201cHis arms were so big. And strong\u2026~ \u266a\u201dWhen Shizuna was embraced by Ryuichi\u2019s muscular arms, she felt a thrill she had never felt before. Shizuna knew that he was only joking, which made her feel all the more secure in Ryuichi\u2019s arms.Shizuna put her hands on her cheeks.They were unbelievably hot to the touch, and her heart was beating so loudly that she could hear it pulsing. She couldn\u2019t forget the feeling of being held in those thick arms of his, and the fact that he whispered in her ear that he would \u201cdevour\u201d her was also vividly etched in her mind.\u201c\u2026Seriously\u2026 What is happening to me?\u201dThe pounding of her heart continued unabated as Shizuna was confronted with bewilderment at this feeling she had never experienced before. At the same time, she realized that the reason why she hadn\u2019t resisted Ryuichi\u2019s pull on her arm both this time and last time (the\u00a0kabedon) was that there was a tiny, tiny part of her that wouldn\u2019t mind if he had his way with her\u2026She still hadn\u2019t realized.She hadn\u2019t realized that\u00a0certain\u00a0tendency lying dormant within her; it would be a while before she did.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d\u201cUrk?!\u201dPerhaps she\u2019d been alone in her imagination, or perhaps she wasn\u2019t. Either way, she\u2019d failed to notice her mother\u2019s approach. Embarrassed by the sight of her mother looking at her in exasperation, she quickly took off her shoes and moved from the foyer.\u201cSorry, Mom. I had some urgent business today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. But it really did come as a surprise. I\u2019ve never heard you sound that desperate before. Fufu, I wonder who you were with?\u201d\u201c\u2026A friend.\u201d\u201cSure, we\u2019ll roll with that.\u201dShizuna\u2019s face turned red at her mother\u2019s phrasing, implying that she\u2019d already seen through her.Shizuna\u2019s mother, Sakie, was a beautiful woman. Perhaps it\u2019d be easier to picture her if she was described as a slightly more mature version of Shizuna. Because of her youthful appearance, she and Shizuna were often mistaken for sisters when they went out together.Shizuna had heard that she\u2019d been approached by various people at her workplace, but that she\u2019d turned them all down, as if she was not interested in them at all.\u2026It\u2019s been years since Dad passed away; surely Mom could use a new life with somebody,\u00a0Shizuna thought.Shizuna\u2019s father, Sakie\u2019s husband, had long since passed on. Although Shizuna had some reservations when it came to the matter of remarriage, she would make sure to keep her biological father and her hypothetical stepfather as two separate people in her mind if it came to it. For now, though, it was all meaningless speculation on Shizuna\u2019s part since Sakie herself seemed to have no intentions to remarry.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading in the bath now, Mom.\u201d\u201cAlright. Leave the tub hot when you\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dAfter informing her mother, Shizuna made her way to the bathroom.To Shizuna, her body was a precious gift from her father and mother, and as such, she took great care of her body and beauty to keep them as beautiful as possible at all times. She never neglected to care for her skin, hair, and various other parts of her body. After she finished bathing, Shizuna dressed herself in her lovely pink and fluffy pajamas and laid down on her bed.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dI wonder what Ryuichi is doing right now?\u00a0Shizuna\u2019s mind constantly drifted to this thought.\u201c\u2026\u2018See you next time,\u2019 he said\u2026 Ehehe \u266a\u201dWhen he\u2019d said those words to her, the embarrassed look on his face was really cute. His body was way more toned and developed than Shizuna\u2019s, yet he was vain and ostentatious, like a little kid who could not be honest. Even though others called him a delinquent or an immature brat, the more Shizuna got to know Ryuichi, the more she became interested in him.\u201cShishido-kun\u2026\u201dShizuna\u2019s body began to grow heated again as she imagined being held by those thick arms of his. Even without Shizuna willing it, her palms began to fondle her large, feminine mounds. Her body trembled, and when she felt\u00a0them\u00a0harden slightly, she suddenly snapped to her senses.\u201cW-What was I doing\u2026?\u201dShe was bewildered\u2026but obviously, she didn\u2019t hate it, either.Her thoughts were in disarray, but her body, honest as it was, prompted her to move her hand to her chest once more\u2026Suddenly, her phone vibrated.\u201c\u2026Sohei-kun?\u201dShe had gotten a call from her long-time childhood friend. She picked up the phone, torn between relief for having gotten a call from him before she crossed the line, and torment for having been called with such terrible timing.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cHi. Good evening, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cEvening, Sohei-kun. What\u2019s up?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t unusual for him to call Shizuna like this; they were childhood friends, after all, so they often talked to each other face to face, not to mention calling and texting on their phones.\u2026Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t have Shishido-kun\u2019s contact information\u2026 Will he tell me if I ask?Even though she was on the phone with her childhood friend, her brain immediately went back to thoughts of Ryuichi. She spaced out, causing her to miss what he was saying on the phone.\u201cShizuna? Shizuna~?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, sorry. So, what were you saying?\u201d\u201cWere you spacing out? That\u2019s pretty unusual for you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cWell, it happens sometimes.\u201d\u201cSo, what did you want to talk about?\u201d she continued.\u201cLately, you\u2019ve been talking to him\u2026to Shishido, haven\u2019t you? He isn\u2019t threatening you or anything, is he?\u201dWhen she heard his words, her mood took an instant nosedive. She tightly clenched her phone in spite of herself.Again, she knew how others viewed Ryuichi, and she knew what kind of rumors were floating around about him. But Shizuna knew\u2014she knew the\u00a0real\u00a0Ryuichi.It was natural that Sohei didn\u2019t know, just as it was natural that he would take the rumors seriously since nobody was saying otherwise. Still, she hated the fact that despite his ignorance, he had the gall to ask if he was\u00a0threatening\u00a0her\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t threatening me. Shishido-kun is a good person. He\u2019s a very kind person who even sav\u2015\u201d\u201cNo, but the rumors say that he\u2019s ensnared many women before, y\u2019know? Plus, he skips classes and is generally disrespectful toward the teachers. He\u2019s by no means a kind\u2015\u201d\u201cSorry. I think I\u2019m going to bed now. Goodbye.\u201d\u201cWait, Shizuna\u2015\u201dBeep, beep, beep.She\u2019d hung up the phone.As her childhood friend, Shizuna trusted Sohei and naturally had good faith in him. However, she did not want to hear him say such things about Ryuichi. Even if he was just parroting what everybody else was saying, she still did not want to hear it.\u201c\u2026No matter what anybody else says, I know Shishido-kun is kind.\u201dHer quiet mutter melted into the atmosphere without ever reaching anybody.Of course, a part of her also wondered if she was simply putting too much trust in him; if she was only seeing a facade of Ryuichi\u2019s. Even so, Shizuna trusted Ryuichi\u2015and that would never change.\u201cJust be careful, okay? There\u2019s a lot of bad rumors about him. As your childhood friend, I can\u2019t help but worry about you.\u201d\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to worry you, so I\u2019ll be careful with Shishido-kun, okay?\u201dThe gears of change were beginning to turn.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7A Dream-like EncounterTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was a memory still fresh in Ryuichi\u2019s mind. It\u2019d been before he had regained his memories; while he was wandering around the city at night, he came across a beautiful woman. Ryuichi spoke to her as she walked alone, her eyes tinged with melancholy.\u201cYo. What\u2019s a beautiful woman like you doing; walking glumly all by herself on this fine evening?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was clearly hitting on her, plain and simple. For Ryuichi, a good night was a night where he could meet a beautiful woman and passionately make love to her in bed. So that day, Ryuichi was just looking for a woman who was willing to be his partner.\u201cIf you want, you and I could talk about it in that store over there?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fufu, sounds good. I think I\u2019ll take your offer up and let all my woes out, just for the handsome man who called out to me on this lonely night.\u201dThe woman knew that having a \u201ctalk\u201d was just a pretext of his, yet despite this, she still nodded in agreement.Ryuichi brought the woman to his favorite bar, run by a high school student-slash-manager who let him do whatever he wanted.In addition to having a space out front for customers to eat, the bar also had a private room in the back that was prepared for\u00a0those\u00a0purposes, which Ryuichi had used for his trysts many times.\u201c\u2018Sup, boss. Do me a favor and get the beauty next to me a drink, will ya?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got another one this time? Hey, you. I suggest you get out of here now. All he wants to do is fuck you up in bed.\u201d\u201cFufu, thank you for your concern. But today, I thought I\u2019d let his warmth soothe me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so? Then I won\u2019t say anything more.\u201dThe manager seemed to have sensed something in the woman and decided to let Ryuichi do what he wanted.Since Ryuichi was a minor, he wasn\u2019t legally allowed to drink yet; despite this, he was about to ignore it and have a drink anyway when he noticed that the woman had downed several cups already. When Ryuichi saw her in high spirits, he brought her to the back room.\u201cAh\u2026 \u266a\u201dRyuichi took the alluringly mature woman in his arms and carried her. She seemed surprised at first, but immediately, she put her hand on Ryuichi\u2019s arm and let out a melancholy sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s been years now since my husband has passed away\u2026so sometimes, I have nights like these where I can\u2019t help but feel lonely. I have a daughter, though, so when she\u2019s home, she eases that loneliness. But today, she\u2019s staying with a friend of hers.\u201d\u201cI see. So you got lonely and decided to roam the streets at night.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t actually out trying to look for company, though. I was just going to have a quick drink and go home. But then, you found me. \u266a\u201dThe woman turned around and kissed Ryuichi on the lips. He was used to kissing, but the sudden kiss from her took him by surprise. However, not content with being outdone by her, Ryuichi firmly began to entwine his tongue with the woman\u2019s.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m pretty confident in my handling of women. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you enjoy tonight.\u201dThey passionately continued kissing each other, then he pushed her body down on the bed. The woman\u2019s body was as attractive as any college-aged woman Ryuichi had ever had relations with, though she was probably in her mid-thirties seeing as she had a daughter of her own.\u201cI feel so secure in your arms. You\u2019re a little rough, forceful even, but my body is telling me that it wants you to ravage it senseless.\u201d\u201cGlad to hear it. Now then\u2026 Oh, right. Why don\u2019t we exchange our names? I don\u2019t mind if you use an alias.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201d\u201cYou might\u2019ve heard from the manager, but my name is Ryuichi. What about yours?\u201d\u201cMine is Sakie.\u201d\u201cI see. Well then, Sakie; let\u2019s have our fill of lovemaking tonight.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026Ugh.\u201d\u201cA-Awake now, Ryuichi?\u201d\u201c\u2026Makoto?\u201dA groan escaped his mouth as Ryuichi opened his eyes. He looked around and saw that he was in his classroom at school, and many students were still inside. It was only natural since they were currently in their brief break in between classes.\u201c\u2026Did I fall asleep?\u201d\u201cYep, and soundly at that. The teacher even gave up on trying to wake you up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wow. Damn, I messed up.\u201dThough it was unknown whether the same could be said for the previous Ryuichi, the current Ryuichi was, at the very least, properly reflecting on his mistakes. Seeing this, Makoto gave him a startled look which seemed to say, \u201cHoly crap, are you for real?\u201d Knowing what his look meant, Ryuichi annoyedly snorted at him.\u201cMan, you\u2019ve really changed, haven\u2019t you? I mean, you\u2019re so smart that the teachers never say anything, and even if you have a bad attitude in class, you\u2019d manage to get away with it if you got good scores on tests.\u201d\u201cSame goes for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t fall asleep in class!\u201d\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201dHe certainly had a point. Makoto had never fallen asleep during class before; he was also secretive in picking up women, so he wasn\u2019t in particularly bad waters.\u201c\u2026Man, what a nostalgic dream.\u201dIt was a memory of a passionate night with a beautiful woman he came across a while ago while strolling outside at night; a widow who\u2019d called herself Sakie. Ryuichi hadn\u2019t seen her since then, but a woman as beautiful as her surely must\u2019ve remarried and built a happy family by now.\u201c\u2026Ah, now I remember. Sakie\u2019s the woman who resembles Shizuna.\u201dBoth Shizuna and Sakie had returned delighted expressions when he\u2019d embraced them, and their mannerisms had closely resembled each others\u2019. Now that he thought about it, their appearances were also quite similar\u2026\u00a0Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re actually mother and daughter?\u00a0However, he discarded the thought and laughed it off, thinking, \u201cNah, there\u2019s no way.\u201d\u201cYou slept very soundly, didn\u2019t you, Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Fuaaaah\u2026 Ah?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why\u2019re you staring at me with your mouth wide open?\u201dIt was because he had suddenly found Shizuna right next to him as if it was a matter of course. Unless he was still half-asleep, he could\u2019ve sworn Shizuna hadn\u2019t been beside him while he was talking to Makoto. That meant that she had somehow made it to Ryuichi\u2019s side while he was unaware\u2026 He shifted his chair away slightly to put some distance between them.\u201c\u2026I know I\u2019m in the wrong for approaching you without warning, but do you have to act that scared of me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not scared or anything. I just thought you were creepy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s even worse!\u201dHer loud voice rattled his sleepy mind, making Ryuichi furrow his eyebrows.\u201cSeriously, what happened between you two? Why\u2019re you suddenly so close to each other?\u201d\u201cI suppose you could say a lot of things happened between him and I.\u201d\u201cAnd what are those \u2018things\u2019, hmm?\u201d\u201cShut up, you. Keep your nose out of this.\u201dRyuichi made a shooing gesture with his hand while Makoto laughed as he left the two. Makoto was truly a sucker for anything interesting happening around him, which made him particularly curious about Ryuichi\u2019s changes, much to Ryuichi\u2019s dismay. Ryuichi was also wary of the girl standing next to him, because he never knew when she might let something spill from her mouth.\u201cSo? Need anything from me?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I didn\u2019t have any particular business. I just wanted to talk to you. Is that not allowed?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s fine.\u201dIt would\u2019ve been easy for Ryuichi to turn her down for being a hassle, but he didn\u2019t want to make her sad, and he also didn\u2019t want to be seen as rude by everybody. Perhaps regaining his memories had made him a tad bit more timid than before, or perhaps he\u2019d just had a change of heart.\u201cAre you worried about rumors popping up?\u201d\u201cSurely you wouldn\u2019t want them either, would\u2019ja?\u201d\u201cHmm, well, we don\u2019t really mind\u2026 Right, girls?\u201dWith that, Shizuna turned her attention to her friends. The girls, whom he had only talked briefly with a while ago on his way back from the restroom, waved their hands energetically when Ryuichi\u2019s eyes turned to them. Apparently, their encounter that day had produced positive results.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, Ryuichi felt a gaze and turned his head to see Sohei, Shizuna\u2019s childhood friend, staring at him. When their gazes met, he quickly looked away, but it seemed the fact that Ryuichi was talking to Shizuna like this was weighing on his mind.\u201c\u2026Ah, is it Sohei-kun?\u201d\u201cYeah. He doesn\u2019t seem too happy to see you talking to somebody like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026I wonder why. All I\u2019m doing is having a normal, regular conversation with you.\u201dRyuichi knew why. It was because there were a handful of people who knew how she was before and couldn\u2019t accept this new reality.But in any case, he secretly glanced at Shizuna\u2019s face without her noticing. In the manga, she would always be smiling when she looked at Sohei. Yet, the look on Shizuna\u2019s face when she was looking at Sohei now seemed to be a mixture of resignation and disappointment.\u201c\u2026Oh, right. Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cCan we exchange contact information?\u201dAnd so, Shizuna grew yet another step closer to Ryuichi.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Exchanging Contact InformationTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dAfter school ended, Ryuichi returned home and stared at the screen of his phone. Seeing the new name added to his contacts, Rindo Shizuna, had Ryuichi wondering how this had happened.\u201cContact information?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to exchange contact information with you, Shishido-kun\u2026 Do you not want to?\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t particularly mind; he simply hadn\u2019t expected her to ask this of him. Yes, she had come over to his place once, but Ryuichi doubted whether that alone had made them close enough for this.\u201c\u2026What is there to talk about, though\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, Ryuichi\u2019s phone began ringing. It was a call, and the words \u201cRindo Shizuna\u201d appeared on the screen.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSpeak of the devil. Who would\u2019ve thought that she would call just as Ryuichi was thinking about her? He pondered for a while whether he should answer it or not, but eventually, he decided to be a good boy and answer the phone because otherwise, who knew what she\u2019d say to him at school tomorrow.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cOh! Hello, Shishido-kun? \u2026I actually thought you wouldn\u2019t pick up.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026I just had a feeling.\u201dAlthough her answer came back hesitantly, Ryuichi bitterly smiled at how perceptive she was, seeing as her guess was entirely true. Ryuichi, however, didn\u2019t know what to talk about on the phone, so Shizuna, perhaps anticipating this, started talking about something.\u201cHave you had dinner yet, Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you have?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dActually, on the day Shizuna came to cook for Ryuichi, she\u2019d told him to at least try cooking a little for his health. But of course, Ryuichi had made cup ramen for dinner today. Shizuna seemed to have guessed this as well from Ryuichi\u2019s silence and let out a sigh.\u201c\u2026Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cErr, I just didn\u2019t have time, you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn truth, he had lied; he just didn\u2019t want to say that he\u2019d found it a pain in the ass. But of course, Shizuna knew that. Still, the reason why she didn\u2019t push the matter too aggressively might have been because she thought he would find her annoying for forcing him to do so much.\u201c\u2026You must have a properly balanced diet, okay?\u201d\u201cFine. Geez, what are you, my mom?\u201d\u201cOh, was your mother like this, Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cNot really. I was just saying that figuratively. My mom\u2019s miles apart from you\u2026 Actually, forget I said that.\u201dHe forcibly put an end to the topic. Shizuna seemed to have guessed his feelings on the matter and did not ask any further questions, which Ryuichi was grateful for. These days, Ryuichi basically spent his time alone unless somebody happened to be around. Ever since he\u2019d regained his memory, he\u2019d dropped his habit of wandering around the city streets at night.That was why a small thought surfaced in his mind.\u00a0It felt really warm when Chisa was here. Shizuna, too.\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026Cup ramen tastes so bland compared to the\u00a0nikujaga\u00a0you made that day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t know how Shizuna reacted to his words, but he had a feeling she was happy because he could hear a flapping noise on the other end of the phone.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll make some more for you next time. Of course,\u00a0nikujaga\u00a0isn\u2019t the only thing I can make; I\u2019m pretty confident in my Hamburg steaks too, you know?\u201d\u201cHamburg steaks, huh. I\u2019ve never had one outside restaurants.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s something you can look forward to when I come over next time\u2026 okay?\u201dRyuichi could hear the anticipation in Shizuna\u2019s voice as he told her, \u201cSure, if the opportunity arises.\u201d Shizuna\u2019s voice was practically bouncing with joy, and she was so excited that she was moving forward with plans on her own as to when she would like to visit him.\u201cHey, I said when the opportunity arises, okay?\u201d\u201cGot it! \u266a\u201dShe definitely doesn\u2019t get it.\u00a0Ryuichi sighed. Nevertheless, the thought of having her delicious cooking again made him expectant. After all, the meat and potato stew alone had been so good that it was clearly visible from his expression.\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cYes! \u266a\u201dWell, that was the least Ryuichi could say about the matter. After they talked for a little longer, they came to a good stopping point. However, just seconds before the call ended\u2026\u201cRyuichi? I\u2019m comin\u2019 in~!\u201d\u201c\u2026Chisa? Sorry Rindo, I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d\u201cW-Wait a minute\u2015\u201dBeep, beep, beep.\u00a0The call had cut off.\u201cOh, were you on the phone with someone?\u201d\u201cYeah, something like that. Anyways, don\u2019t just barge into here without warning.\u201dRyuichi casually threw his phone under the pillow while Chisa waved her hand and said, \u201cNow, now, don\u2019t be like that.\u201d She sat down next to him and started clinging to him. He could immediately smell the scent of alcohol wafting from her.\u201cSeriously, how much did you have to drink\u2026\u201d\u201cHmmm? I had quite a few cups\u2026 So, I was about to make my way home from a party, but the guys wouldn\u2019t stop fussing about sending me home!\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you just go with one of them?\u201d\u201cHell no. Why do I have to walk with those losers?\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t go snapping at me.\u201dI turned my gaze away from Chisa\u2019s pouting face.\u00a0She\u2019d\u00a0likely heard a fragment of Chisa\u2019s voice during the phone call earlier. The subtle panicked tone in her voice bothered him, but he decided to put Shizuna aside for the moment, thinking, \u201cWell, whatever.\u201d\u201cDamn, this place\u2019s gotten really clean, huh? Surely you couldn\u2019t have done this all by yourself.\u201d\u201cYou got that right.\u201d\u201cWho was it? I know\u2026 It must\u2019ve been a woman, huh?\u201d\u201cRight again.\u201dHe didn\u2019t feel like it was something he had to hide, so he answered honestly. Chisa didn\u2019t have any particular reaction, but she did look somewhat stunned that he had brought home yet another girl.\u201cWho did you sink your fangs into this time?\u201d\u201cWhy do you make it sound like I\u2019m a criminal or something? She\u2019s just a classmate.\u201d\u201cWow, so you fucked your classmate!\u201d\u201c\u2026Damn it, Chisa!\u201d\u201cAhahaha! Sorry, sorry. \u266a\u201dDespite being a girl, Chisa spoke of sex and the like so freely. Her common sense was truly lacking. Of course, most of the people Ryuichi associated with were like that, so there was no point in him brooding about it now.\u201cHey, Ryuichi. I\u2019m gonna stay the night here, \u2018kay?\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cYup. I like that part of you that never says no.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026There are a lot of other parts that aren\u2019t cute about you, though.\u201dRyuichi felt humiliated to be called \u2018cute\u2019 despite being a man. After receiving permission to stay the night, Chisa immediately laid down on the bed and started fiddling with her phone, perhaps messaging her friend.\u201c\u2026Your panties are out there for the world to see, y\u2019know.\u201dChisa continued to play with her phone silently, paying no heed to the fact that her short skirt was rolled up. When Ryuichi pointed this out to her, she only glanced at him and made no attempt to fix it. Of course, it wasn\u2019t like it would be a fatal blow to her as a woman, but Ryuichi still wanted to show this image of her to all the boys in her university who were in love with her.\u201cWonder what the boys would say if they saw you now.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t show this to them. I know I play around a lot, but I\u2019m very selective when it comes to who I entrust my body to.\u201d\u201cOh, really? First time I\u2019ve heard of that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just cos I never told you. Just so you know, you\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve been doing it with lately.\u201dHearing that didn\u2019t really make Ryuichi happy. He was not really interested in what kind of relationship Chisa had with others; plus, regardless of whether he\u2019d regained his memory or not, their relationship would only amount to that: sex friends.\u201cGonna wash yourself up?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019ll take a shower.\u201d\u201cThen do it before you sleep.\u201d\u201cOkaaay~.\u201dChisa sluggishly got up, went to the closet, grabbed a change of clothes, and headed for the bathroom.After a while, Chisa came back. True to her words, she didn\u2019t seem to have soaked in the bathtub; she\u2019d only used the shower. Thanks to the shower, she seemed somewhat more awake now, but her eyelids still looked heavy, likely because of all the alcohol she\u2019d had.\u201cWell, it\u2019s getting late now, so let\u2019s hit the sack.\u201d\u201cNot gonna fuck me?\u201d\u201cNot today.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019m also pretty sleepy right now, to be honest.\u201dSince Ryuichi lived alone, all he had was a single futon; thus, the two of them had to sleep in the same futon together.\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel bad to sleep on a futon every once in a while. It feels really\u2026 Japanese.\u201d\u201cBut a bed is definitely better.\u201d\u201cAgreed. \u266a\u201dNevertheless, the sheets were quite soft, so it was pleasant enough to fall asleep right away. Chisa\u2019s expression was very much adult-like as she used Ryuichi\u2019s arm as a pillow, but her gesture of leaning in close to seek his body heat almost gave him the impression that they were about the same age.\u201cHey, Ryuichi. Is there anything bothering you?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing stressful happening?\u201d\u201cDo I look stressed?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 But I\u2019m just worried for you since you\u2019re younger than me.\u201d\u201cReally, now? Anyways, you have college tomorrow, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ve got school too, so let\u2019s leave it there.\u201d\u201cOkaay~. G\u2019night, Ryuichi.\u201dChisa immediately conked out and fell asleep. Her regular breathing elicited a wry smile from Ryuichi, who quietly whispered.\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t like that old man or hag would give a crap about whatever was happening to me.\u201dAnd with that, Ryuichi, too, closed his eyes.\u201c\u2026That\u2026was a woman\u2019s voice just now\u2026wasn\u2019t it?\u201dSomewhere else, another girl was thinking about Ryuichi with gloomy feelings.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Looking at His True Nature AloneTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dThat day, Shizuna began her morning in gloomy spirits. Needless to say, the cause was her phone call with Ryuichi yesterday. It was their first phone call since Shizuna had exchanged contact information with Ryuichi, and she had felt very nervous up until she pressed the dial button\u2026 Then, the call went through, and when she heard his voice, Shizuna felt a warmth flood her heart.However, just as the call was about to end, a woman\u2019s voice came through\u2026 That voice still lingered in Shizuna\u2019s mind in the form of her depressed mood.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dAs she let out her umpteenth sigh that day, the question of how Ryuichi and the woman spent last night constantly weighed on her mind. She didn\u2019t know why it bothered her so much; after all, he\u2019d already told her from the get go: that he had relations with many women.\u201c\u2026My chest ached a little at the time, too.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d thought nothing of Ryuichi affirming the rumors; back then, she just hadn\u2019t witnessed it in person, so she didn\u2019t really feel it. But this incident, as evident by her reaction, really weighed on Shizuna\u2019s mind.\u201c\u2026He called her \u2018Chisa\u2019, didn\u2019t he? I wonder if that\u2019s the woman he\u2019s still seeing.\u201dNaturally, thinking about it alone wouldn\u2019t give her any answers, but spacing out like what she was doing probably wasn\u2019t a good idea either, since she\u2019d failed to notice the approach of a person behind her.\u201cShizuna!\u201d\u201cKyah?!\u201dShe heard a familiar voice calling out to her from behind before she was suddenly hugged by them. The hug itself was light, but it was abrupt enough to surprise Shizuna.\u201cSohei-kun?\u201d\u201cYup, that\u2019s me. G\u2019morning, Shizuna.\u201d\u201c\u2026Good morning.\u201dThe one who\u2019d clung to her back was Sohei. Shizuna thought back to how they used to do this to each other all the time in the past. Of course, they didn\u2019t do that anymore now that they were in high school, but seeing Sohei like this now made her think that he really hasn\u2019t changed between then and now.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be in a good mood. Did you\u2026not like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s not that. I just thought it was embarrassing.\u201dShizuna lied to him. Yes, she\u2019d said she didn\u2019t dislike it, but in reality, she did just a little bit. Part of the blame lied with her for not noticing it earlier due to her being distracted by her thoughts, but even then, why had he decided to just hug a girl without warning?\u201c\u2026Actually, yes, I did dislike it. Sohei-kun, we\u2019re high school students now, aren\u2019t we? Besides, we have our differences in gender to consider, so we shouldn\u2019t do this kind of thing anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dIn the end, Shizuna changed her mind and decided to speak up, reprimanding him firmly. Although her tone wasn\u2019t harsh, Sohei seemed to be quite shocked to hear his childhood friend Shizuna say she didn\u2019t like it.\u201cShizuna, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026Actually, never mind. I\u2019ll see you at school.\u201dLeaving those few words behind, Sohei took off and ran ahead of her.\u00a0Maybe I went a little overboard,\u00a0Shizuna thought. But then, she thought back to the past where sometimes, she too would cling on Sohei. They had always been together since way back, and to Shizuna, Sohei was her precious childhood friend, so she hoped that would always remain the same now and in the future.\u201cI still remember how we used to say we would marry each other. How nostalgic. But in the end, it\u2019s only a promise made by children. I hope Sohei-kun and I can each find our own significant other who feels right for us.\u201dWhen Shizuna thought about who hers would be, he was the first person to come to her mind. Yes, he, who\u2019d saved Shizuna with his large, bulky body\u2014\u201cOh, that you, Rindo? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fuah?!\u201dThe owner of the voice who\u2019d stopped Shizuna from falling into her fantasies was, in a sense, the owner of the voice she wanted to hear, but also a person who, if she met now, would be very troubling.\u201cS-Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cYo.\u201dShizuna wasn\u2019t happy when she saw that Ryuichi looked exactly the same as usual, unlike herself, who was stressing over what happened last night. She wanted an outlet to vent her feelings, so she bonked Ryuichi\u2019s chest over and over.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with you?\u201d\u201cSorry. I just had the urge to do this\u2026 Muuu.\u201dShe immediately stopped hitting him, but her heart remained unsatisfied. Seeing Shizuna\u2019s cheeks puffed out, Ryuichi sighed before he continued walking. Naturally, Shizuna paced alongside him.\u201cHey. Are you seriously going to walk with me?\u201d\u201cOf course. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll split partway through. After all, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d prefer it that way, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dOne might\u2019ve thought that going to school together wouldn\u2019t be something that big of a deal. However, high school was fundamentally a sensitive period for teenagers, so just by seeing a boy and girl walking together, they would immediately start making baseless speculations about them.\u201c\u2026Hey, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShizuna turned to look at Ryuichi, who was walking right next to her, while he stared ahead without looking at Shizuna. Unlike Shizuna, who wore her uniform neatly and seriously, Ryuichi commonly wore his uniform messily with all its buttons open.\u2026His muscles are seriously so cool\u00a0\u266aThis thought inadvertently slipped its way into Shizuna\u2019s mind. She shook her head repeatedly to rid the thought before cutting straight into yesterday\u2019s events.\u201cWhy did you cut the call short yesterday\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, that. You see, Chisa\u2026 a college student came to my home. She just got done with a drinking party, and man, it made my place reek of the stuff.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 I see.\u201dIs she his girlfriend?\u00a0Shizuna innocently wondered.\u201cIs she your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cNah. We\u2019ve just known each other for a while so we meet up occasionally.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dShizuna felt relieved when she heard that she wasn\u2019t his girlfriend. However, it would be a while before she realized what this relief of hers meant. In the meantime, Ryuichi continued.\u201cWell, she\u2019s not my girlfriend\u2026but we\u00a0are\u00a0close enough to do those sorts of things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna wasn\u2019t so childish so as to not know what \u201cthose sorts of things\u201d implied. Shizuna felt a prickle of pain rather than embarrassment at the thought. She glanced up at Ryuichi, who was still the same as usual, and felt like an idiot for stressing about the matter so much.\u201cSo does that mean\u2026\u201dThe words she was about to say were words she would have never uttered if she were calm. But they never left her mouth, because Ryuichi reached his arm out toward her.\u201cRindo.\u201d\u201cWha\u2015\u201dRyuichi grabbed Shizuna by her arm and forcefully brought her into his embrace. Her face touched his chest, and she could directly feel the hardness of his pecs and abs. Her cheeks suddenly began to heat up, and that heat distracted her so much that she didn\u2019t notice her lower abdomen throbbing.\u201cS-Shishido-kun\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t space out while you\u2019re walking. You were so close to hitting him, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShizuna looked at where Ryuichi was looking and saw an old man walking with a cane. If he hadn\u2019t done what he did, she very well might have bumped into him, and it would have been a disaster if he had fallen over. The reason Ryuichi held Shizuna close to him was simply to keep her from bumping into the old man.\u201c\u2026Thank you, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me. Nothing happened, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201dHe patted her head gently. Shizuna felt like she was being treated like a child, but for some reason she couldn\u2019t tell him to stop. In fact, she even wanted him to do more; not to mention the fact that she\u2019d felt overjoyed when he hugged her earlier. Shizuna felt an undeniable warmth and excitement from Ryuichi that she had never felt when she was with Sohei.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dRyuichi started walking again, and Shizuna followed suit beside him. Soon, she and Ryuichi would have to part ways and head to school separately.\u00a0If only this time could last a little longer\u2026\u00a0Shizuna wished in her heart.Under normal circumstances, Shizuna and Sohei would\u2019ve gotten together as a couple. That was how it\u2019d worked in the original manga, yet a single change alone had caused things to deviate so drastically from its course.However, that change was by no means caused by bad intentions. The future that Ryuichi, who had regained his memories, had brought onto himself was purely caused by Shizuna. She wasn\u2019t being manipulated, let alone being forcibly caused to have feelings for him. She was genuinely looking at Ryuichi.She was looking at the changed Ryuichi\u2019s true nature; nothing more, nothing less.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Knowing What\u2019s Going On Behind The Scenes is Very AmusingTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026I messed up.\u201dSohei, Shizuna\u2019s childhood friend, clutched his head in his hands as soon as he arrived at school. He had come across Shizuna as soon as he\u2019d left his home in the morning. Although they talked and met with each other often\u2026they had considerably less skinship than they did in the past, but still, there was no doubt that Sohei was interested in her as a person of the opposite sex.\u201cShizuna!\u201dHe\u2019d called out to her by her name and hugged her from behind\u2026something he used to do a lot in the past. He\u2019d thought she wouldn\u2019t mind since it was just like old times. However, contrary to his expectations, Shizuna had told him that she\u2019d disliked it. A part of him was shocked, but a part of him also had to admit that, no matter how close they were as childhood friends, it was natural for her to say that since it\u2019d be a surprise to be suddenly hugged like that.\u201c\u2026I seriously messed up.\u201dShizuna\u2019s gaze at him had been sharper than he\u2019d expected, and her voice had sounded more forceful as well. Sohei left the place as if fleeing from her gaze and words that had never been directed at him before.\u2026Shishido Ryuichi.He was a tumor in the class; a delinquent whom even the teachers had a hard time dealing with. Sohei had heard many rumors about him, leading him to believe that he and Ryuichi lived in different worlds. Not just him, but also Shizuna.Recently, Shizuna had been talking frequently with Ryuichi. The two had suddenly grown closer, even though no such indication of it could be seen before. Ryuichi did seem to find it bothersome, but still, Sohei couldn\u2019t believe that Shizuna was willingly trying to talk to him.\u201c\u2026Why?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t think of a reason at all. Sohei didn\u2019t not know too much about Ryuichi, but either way, he would never think of willingly talking to him. It was just like how a person who wanted a peaceful school life wouldn\u2019t willingly get involved with a delinquent.\u201cHey. What\u2019s wrong, Sohei?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey, Toshiki.\u201dIt was Yamamoto Toshiki, Sohei\u2019s best friend and classmate. He had been watching Sohei clutching his head in his hands for a few minutes now, and it seemed that he was curious about what had happened to him. But of course, there was no way Sohei could honestly say that he had hugged his childhood friend and been rejected.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just another plain old school day, y\u2019know?\u201dSeeing Sohei avert his gaze as he said that made it clear as day that he was lying to Toshiki. Toshiki, however, seemed to have understood Sohei\u2019s attempt to drop the topic and replied, \u201cI see.\u201d No sooner had he said that than Shizuna entered the classroom.Shizuna, a beauty so stunning that she easily drew the stares of everybody in the class, made her way to her circle of friends. During that time, she never once looked at Sohei. That made him a little sad, but it also made him realize that everything had changed from their childhood days.\u201cHey, hey, Sohei. Don\u2019t you think something\u2019s up with Rindo these days?\u201d\u201cYou mean that thing about her and Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201cYeah, that. I mean, they never talked to each other before this, right? He must be threatening her or something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSohei, too, had thought that, and he\u2019d warned Shizuna of it as well. However, Shizuna had told him that it wasn\u2019t true. Although he couldn\u2019t deny the possibility that she\u2019d lied because she was being threatened, the words that followed from her at that time kept repeating in his mind.\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t threatening me. Shishido-kun is a good person. He\u2019s a very kind person who even sav\u2015\u201dWhen Sohei had heard that, he immediately fired back and told her that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. She immediately hung up the phone afterwards, but thinking about it more closely, he could sense that Shizuna\u2019s voice had sounded quite unhappy at the time.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf\u2026\u00a0If Shizuna truly trusted Ryuichi, then that would make what Sohei said to her very unpleasant to hear.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dIt was at that moment that Ryuichi arrived at school. His conspicuous blond hair, tanned skin, large muscular body, sharp eyes, and piercings in his ears made him seem all the more like a delinquent. There weren\u2019t many people who approached him in class, and at best, only a few boys with similarly bad reputations who he was probably close with would approach him.\u201cShizuna\u2026\u201dAnd with Ryuichi\u2019s arrival, Shizuna naturally approached him. As usual, Ryuichi wore a somewhat displeased look on his face, but Shizuna was talking to him with a smile on hers. There was no sign of coercion or intimidation in her appearance, and it was clear that she was sincerely enjoying their conversation.\u201c\u2026Dammit.\u201dUnbeknownst to anybody, a small murmur leaked out from his mouth. Shizuna wasn\u2019t the kind of girl who associated with bad people, and that was something Sohei, her childhood friend, knew all too well. That was why Sohei wondered if he was wrong to simply believe the rumors and declare Ryuichi to be a bad person.\u201cNow that\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened before. Hey, are you really gonna stand around and do nothing? At this rate, he\u2019s gonna steal Rindo away from you.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026just\u2026\u201dImpossible.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t utter the final word. To Sohei, Shizuna was somebody for whom he\u2019d always held faint feelings. Heartbreak took precedence over thoughts of worry or anxiety for her. It pained his heart to see her smiling like that at somebody other than himself.I see\u2026 I was spoiled by my status as her childhood friend. I have to be more proactive and take action\u2026 How ironic, huh. I can\u2019t believe it took Shishido to make me realize this.Sohei resolved to be a bit more brave from now on. The last thing he wanted was for his inaction to cause him regret in the future. Still, he decided to wait and see how things would go for now, in typical Sohei-like fashion.\u201c\u2026Achoo!\u201dDuring lunchtime, Ryuichi sneezed loudly. Either somebody had been gossiping about him or he had gotten the flu, but either way, it was such a loud sneeze that he\u2019d attracted the eyes of many. Unfazed, Ryuichi nonchalantly pulled a tissue out of his pocket and wiped his nose.\u201c\u2026Guess I\u2019ll kill some time on the rooftop.\u201dSince he had nearly 30 minutes until his next class, Ryuichi got up from his seat and headed for the rooftop. The rooftop was always open to the public, but it was a calm and quiet place since not many people visited.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve visited that place. Maybe I should go today.\u201dWhat Ryuichi was referring to by \u201cthat place\u201d was his favorite bar which he hadn\u2019t visited lately. He didn\u2019t have any particular plans with women, but that would probably turn out to be a relief in many ways to the bar manager.\u201cShishido-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026Please tell me you\u2019re not Rindo.\u201d\u201cToo bad, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dHe sighed, knowing full well that it\u2019d been her just from her voice. She moved next to Ryuichi and joined him in admiring the view from the rooftop. He glanced at her side profile: her hair waving in the wind as she held it with her hand. He was once again reminded of how much of a beauty she was as he admired her beauty inwardly.\u201cOh, yeah. Did anything happen earlier this morning?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just wanted to know.\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes widened in surprise at Ryuichi\u2019s question. Even Ryuichi didn\u2019t know why he was asking that; he just didn\u2019t know what to talk about, so he spontaneously blurted that out. Shizuna slowly began to speak.\u201c\u2026Well, it wasn\u2019t anything too important\u2026 It just made me remember how we\u2019ve actually gotten older now.\u201d\u201cYou sound like a granny or something.\u201d\u201cHow rude!\u201dShizuna hit Ryuichi on his shoulders a little forcefully. Of course, Ryuichi\u2019s body wasn\u2019t impacted in the least by that much. After that, the two of them gazed at the scenery for a while before Shizuna suddenly muttered.\u201cHey, Shishido-kun. Today\u2026umm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2018Do you have any plans tonight?\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026How did you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026Wow, I was actually right?\u201dSeeing Shizuna falter made Ryuichi suspicious, so he decided to beat her to the punch and fill in the rest of her words, but it seemed his suspicions had actually been true. He was certainly surprised, but now that she\u2019d brought the topic up, the taste of her meat and potato stew kept coming back to his mind. Even though he\u2019d already finished his lunch, his stomach was on the verge of rumbling.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of making a quick visit to the city t\u2019night. Specifically, I\u2019m gonna go to my favorite bar, or rather, a bar run by a manager that\u2019s helped me a lot.\u201d\u201cTo drink alcohol?\u201d\u201cHell no. I\u2019m still underaged.\u201d\u201cI mean, with the way you look, Shishido-kun, you don\u2019t sound very convincing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Very blunt these days, aren\u2019t you?\u201dCompared to when we first met\u2026\u00a0Well, it wasn\u2019t actually that long ago, but now, they\u2019d gotten close enough to the point where Shizuna didn\u2019t mince her words when she spoke to Ryuichi. Strangely enough, it didn\u2019t feel unpleasant, and the way in which she easily entered people\u2019s hearts was just as he\u2019d expect of her.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ve decided, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cOn what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to come with you to keep an eye on you and make sure you don\u2019t drink, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very serious about this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis time it was Ryuichi who had his mouth wide agape. Yes, he\u2019d previously called her a very impulsive person, but who would\u2019ve known that she was\u00a0this\u00a0impulsive. In any case, it was imperative that he turned her down.\u201cNo. Good girls don\u2019t go to bars.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll be a bad girl when I\u2019m with you, Shishido-kun. Problem solved.\u201d\u201cNow you\u2019re just arguing for the sake of it.\u201dShizuna was serious. She seriously wanted to accompany Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026Fine!\u201d\u201cHeehee! \u266a\u201dWhat\u2019s so funny, huh?\u00a0Ryuichi thought as he heaved a big sigh.\u201cMom, I\u2019m going out to have dinner with a friend today.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Alright. Maybe I\u2019ll go out for dinner, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really? Just like that, no questions asked?\u201d\u201cYup. Have fun.\u201d\u201cOkay! \u266a\u201dSakie smiled at the sound of her daughter\u2019s voice filled with joy. She didn\u2019t actually have a particular place in mind when she told her daughter she would eat out.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been there. Perhaps I should make a visit today.\u201dSakie smiled and decided to head to the bar where her memories with a boy much younger than herself resided.God truly was cruel.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11A Mother, a Daughter, and the Man Who Seduced ThemTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrAfter school let out, they each returned to their respective homes. Once it grew dark, Ryuichi headed to Shizuna\u2019s house.\u201cAh, Shishido-kun!\u201d\u201cDid you wait out here the entire time?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m feeling pretty excited, you see.\u201dThe place they were about to head to was a place far too early for a high school student to go to. And it definitely wasn\u2019t a place for a serious girl like Shizuna. But Shizuna was looking straight into Ryuichi\u2019s eyes. Her eyes told him that she wouldn\u2019t take a \u2018no\u2019 for an answer and that she would follow him no matter what.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201d\u201cHeehee! Give it up, Shishido-kun. \u266a\u201dWho\u2019s fault do you think this is?\u00a0Ryuichi glared at her, but Shizuna didn\u2019t seem the least bit bothered.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, Shizuna took her phone out.\u201cSohei-kun?\u201d\u201cWhat, your childhood friend?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll just reply to him later when I get home. Let\u2019s go, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cS-Sure\u2026\u201dRyuichi was surprised to see Shizuna\u2019s relative indifference towards her childhood friend\u2019s message. In the first place, the manga only depicted the story of Sohei and Shizuna after they were already in a relationship, so the events that led to them getting together were only told in fragments.\u2026Me getting this close to Shizuna also shouldn\u2019t have been possible in the first place.NTR. One person steals, while the other is stolen from. That is the original storyline of this world.In the first place, the current Ryuichi had no intention of making physical threats to Shizuna now. After all, this world was no longer fiction, but reality. Even threats could get him in trouble, let alone raping somebody\u2014that would be a one-way ticket to jail for Ryuichi.\u201cMan, I\u2019d definitely hate getting arrested.\u201d\u201cHuh? Did you do something wrong?\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as she stared at Ryuichi. There was no way he could tell her that there\u00a0was\u00a0a world in which he would do something very wrong in the future. Of course, as has been said already multiple times, that was impossible now, but even so, Ryuichi bet that she herself would\u2019ve never guessed that she would be in the center of it all.\u201cHey, Rindo.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf a person assaults you, what would you do?\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019d call the police right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. That\u2019s the normal thing to do. Good girl.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019re you talking about?\u201dRyuichi\u2019s question was natural. Usually, in those kinds of mangas, both the protagonist and the heroine would usually go brain-dead and not consult anybody until the very end. Ryuichi nodded his head in approval, seemingly moved by the fact that Shizuna\u2019s thought process was still normal in calling the police.\u201c\u2026Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dAs Ryuichi was nodding his head, Shizuna, who was staring at him intently, suddenly asked the following.\u201cIf I do get assaulted by somebody\u2026will you come to save me from them?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t tell her that\u00a0he\u00a0was the one who had assaulted her originally. He could just answer vaguely, and Shizuna would probably just smile and not pursue the matter any further. But when he saw her looking at him with a glimmer of hope in her eyes\u2026 He chuckled and thought to himself that if he answered vaguely now, what kind of man would he be?\u201cWell, if you call for me, then sure. I\u2019ll save you.\u201dHe chose a safe and innocuous reply. Ryuichi started walking before he had time to hear her reply, but soon Shizuna was standing next to him, smiling as beautifully as any smile he had ever seen.\u201cThank you, Shishido-kun. \u266a\u201dSeeing her smile made Ryuichi smile lightly in response. The two of them then walked through the city, and eventually they arrived in front of the bar.\u201c\u2026So this is the place.\u201d\u201cYep. May look shady to you, but that\u2019s just how all bars are.\u201dIt was already dark outside, and the figures of people trying to lure customers into their establishments could be clearly seen. Some of them were naturally acquaintances of Ryuichi\u2019s; others winked suggestively at him or waved at him. Some were men in suits and some were women in revealing clothes.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d\u201cO-Okay\u2026\u201dShizuna was a little scared, but having Ryuichi by her side made her fear disappear completely. She resumed her steps and snuggled up right next to him.As they descended a flight of stairs that seemed to be taking them underground, they finally came across a lone door. This was the entrance to the city\u2019s nightlife, a place very familiar to Ryuichi yet new to Shizuna.\u201cI knew there\u2019d be quite the crowd here.\u201d\u201c\u2026This really is that sort of place, huh.\u201dOnce they entered, the pair was immediately greeted by a bustling, lively atmosphere. Naturally, most of the people inside were adults, and there were no high school students like the two of them. A number of old men well into their years turned their gazes at Shizuna when she entered, but Ryuichi gave them a little glare and they quickly averted their eyes.\u201cIn a way, it feels like I brought you here as my partner or something. Well, don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll make sure to protect you. Nothing bad should happen, but if it does, I\u2019ll be right by your side.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Okay.\u201dWhen Shizuna heard Ryuichi\u2019s words, she looked down at the ground. Ryuichi couldn\u2019t see her expression, so he didn\u2019t know what she was thinking. Still, she held onto the hem of Ryuichi\u2019s shirt and didn\u2019t let go.Together, they headed for the counter. There, a stern-looking man turned his attention to the pair.\u201cYo. \u2018Sup, boss. S\u2019been a while.\u201dYes, this man was the bar\u2019s manager. He made a displeased expression upon seeing Ryuichi, which Ryuichi was used to by now. Then, he turned his attention to Shizuna and said something similar to what he had said sometime ago.\u201cLittle girl, listen to me and go home now. I\u2019m sure you know what kind of person this man is, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, I do, but thank you for your concern. I followed Shishido-kun here of my own accord.\u201d\u201cHmm? Well, fine then. The back room\u2019s free so go ahead and use it.\u201d\u201cNope, not here to use it.\u201dRyuichi refused and sat down. The manager seemed astounded to hear that Ryuichi had come today not to do those sorts of things, but to eat dinner together.\u201c\u2026I have to say, it feels like something about you\u2019s changed.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one to tell me that.\u201d\u201cI mean, that shitty behavior of yours seems to have died down a little\u2026but hell if I know. If food\u2019s what you want, then gimme some time to have it ready. You, too, little girl. Have a seat while you wait.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dWell, the place certainly did have a dubious atmosphere, but it was fundamentally no different from a normal restaurant. Only a limited number of people\u2014Ryuichi included\u2014knew that there was a room in the back for trysts and other such activities.\u201c\u2026This place really seems to have a mature and comfortable feel to it.\u201d\u201cOh my, if you\u2019re saying that, then it looks like you\u2019re well on your way to becoming a bad girl, Rindo.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019re you saying, Shishido-kun? The moment I sat down here, I already became a bad girl, just like you.\u201d\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201dRyuichi laughed. Afterwards, they enjoyed their meals that the manager had worked hard at. Shizuna had initially felt a little intimidated because the restaurant looked like a high-class restaurant, but soon, she lost herself in the deliciousness of the food.\u201cThis stuff\u2019s really good. Especially this meuni\u00e8re.\u201d\u201cI agree. This soup is also wonderful.\u201d\u201cHaha, you have a good eye, little girl. But seriously, how did somebody the likes of Ryuichi make such a good girl like you his girlfriend?\u201dShizuna choked on her food when she heard the manager\u2019s words.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d\u201cNo shit. We\u2019re just classmates.\u201dWhen Shizuna heard Ryuichi say they were \u201cjust classmates\u201d, Shizuna pouted a little, but first she had to focus on clearing her throat. After she calmed down, she corrected the manager, her face turning red as well.\u201cIt is just as he said. We are\u2026not going out.\u201d\u201cOh? Well, if you say so.\u201dNeither Ryuichi nor Shizuna could tell what the manager was thinking as he chuckled.\u201cAre you okay? Did any rice grains fall out of your nose?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201dIt\u2019d be a disaster for a maiden of her age if she had been exposed in such a manner. She would\u2019ve immediately been stripped of her \u201cmaiden\u201d status. While they were having their meal, a woman came in through the front door.\u201cAh, it\u2019s been a while since the last time you were here.\u201d\u201cYes. Nice to see you again, sir.\u201dRyuichi and Shizuna\u2019s hands both stopped when they heard the woman\u2019s voice.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWait\u2026\u201dBoth of them looked at each other, their eyes seemingly conveying their doubt. \u201cNo way, right?\u201d they seemed to say as they turned to look at the woman. At the same time, the woman noticed their gaze and turned to look at them.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dThe woman looked at Ryuichi and Shizuna in turn, her eyes widening in surprise.\u201cM-Mom\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Shizuna? Why are you here\u2026? And you, too\u2026\u201dThe woman who\u2019d shown up was no stranger to Shizuna and Ryuichi. She was Shizuna\u2019s mother, Sakie, with whom Ryuichi had shared a night not long before.\u201c\u2026Wait, \u2018Mom\u2019?!\u201dOf course, Ryuichi was surprised, too, and for good reason. At the same time, his brain instantly came to a conclusion: this situation was the worst possible situation that could have occurred.God was truly, very cruel.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Call Me by My First NameTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrFor Ryuichi, this reunion was very unexpected. He hadn\u2019t expected to find the beautiful, charming woman with whom he\u2019d once spent a steamy night to be Shizuna\u2019s mother. No, there was no way he could have thought that far in the first place.\u2026I see. I thought I had some sort of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when I saw Rindo, but it turned out I was remembering Sakie.Seeing Sakie here now finally affirmed Ryuichi\u2019s suspicions when he\u2019d first seen Shizuna. Nevertheless, this situation made Ryuichi\u2019s stomach churn in knots.\u201cMom?\u201d\u201cShizuna\u2026 So this is where you were eating out?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 You, too, Mom?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019ve been here once before.\u201dIt was likely that both Shizuna and Sakie were utterly baffled. Setting the matter of Sakie aside, Shizuna must never find out about how Ryuichi had had sexual relations with her own mother.\u00a0In the worst case scenario\u2014if she does find out\u2014who knows what kind of expression she\u2019d make\u2026?\u00a0A few moments ago, Ryuichi wouldn\u2019t have cared at all, but now that he knew they were mother and daughter, it was an entirely different story.\u201c\u2026Man, Ryuichi. You\u2019re in deep shit right now, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just shut up.\u201dThe manager, who\u2019d been quietly watching the entire time, seemed to be desperately trying to hold in a laugh at the unexpected turn of events.\u201cShishido-kun? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, err, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dRyuichi shook his head like never before, and since Shizuna was currently facing him, she couldn\u2019t see Sakie\u2019s expression. Sakie was intently staring at Ryuichi, seemingly having clearly sensed his panic.\u201cShizuna, could you introduce me to the young man beside you?\u201dSakie finally opened her mouth, and out came those words. She was trying to make it seem like their very first meeting, which was an act of consideration for Ryuichi and Shizuna. Shizuna\u2019s expression of bewilderment changed and she introduced Ryuichi to Sakie.\u201cThis is my classmate, Shishido Ryuichi, and he saved me from a malicious playboy on a previous occasion. After that, he and I became friends\u2026 And, well, he\u2019s the one whose house I went to to make dinner the other day.\u201dRyuichi was surprised that she had told her that much, but Sakie on the contrary had a rather understanding expression on her face. Perhaps Shizuna still wanted to talk about Ryuichi, but the words coming out of her mouth didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cI was going to cook dinner at his house again today. Then I heard that he was coming here today\u2026 so I followed him to make sure he didn\u2019t drink alcohol! Yes, that\u2019s right; I came here to supervise him. So there\u2019s nothing for you to worry about, Mom.\u201dIt seemed that Shizuna really wanted to drive the point home to Sakie that she was here\u00a0only\u00a0to supervise Ryuichi. It was also likely that she\u2019d included the fact that she\u2019d come here not by force from Ryuichi, but of her volition to avoid Sakie harboring any negative thoughts towards him.\u201cI see. So that\u2019s how you met him\u2026\u00a0I totally get it,\u00a0Shizuna.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSakie put her hand over her mouth, giggled, and looked again at Ryuichi.\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve been of great help for my daughter during her time of need. Thank you, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I just happened to be passing by, so I just did what I could.\u201d\u201cEven so, that was very kind of you to help her.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s right, Mom! Shishido-kun is a very kind person!\u201dBoth Ryuichi and Sakie seemed surprised at Shizuna\u2019s sudden outburst. Realizing she\u2019d unintentionally shouted, Shizuna immediately hung her head low in embarrassment, told them had to go to the bathroom, and got up from her seat. With Shizuna gone, only Ryuichi and Sakie remained.\u201cNow, then\u2026 Who would\u2019ve thought that we\u2019d meet again in this way?\u201d\u201cYou said it\u2026 I mean, I guess I was the one who planted the seeds for this situation, but I\u2019d never have guessed that this was how things would turn out.\u201d\u201cYes, I was quite surprised myself.\u201dSakie stood up and sat down next to Ryuichi. She was sitting where Shizuna had just been sitting earlier. She leaned in close to Ryuichi and snuggled up to his chest.\u201cH-Hey\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t tell me to get off, will you? I did help you smooth things out with her, so surely I deserve this much of a reward?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t believe how assertive you are even though it\u2019s been so long.\u201dWhatever the circumstances, Ryuichi\u2019s body had a habit of hugging back whenever he was hugged by the opposite sex, as he was now. When he\u00a0hugged Sakie with his thick arms, she let out a sweet breath and mouthed the words, \u201cHug me tighter.\u201d\u201cSo, you and my daughter\u2026aren\u2019t dating, yes?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s the most impulsive person I\u2019ve ever seen. Even if I\u2019m her classmate, I can\u2019t believe she actually came to the house of a boy she just met to make him dinner\u2026 And now, she\u2019s following me to a place like this.\u201d\u201cThat just shows how much she likes you\u2026 It\u2019s honestly unfair.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOh, it was nothing,\u00a0Ryuichi-kun.\u201dPerhaps satisfied, Sakie let go of his body. Ryuichi took another look at Sakie\u2019s figure. Her long black hair was tied up in the same way as Shizuna\u2019s, and her cleavage was slightly visible, as if she was showing off her boldness. Her figure was truly a spectacle to behold, as expected of Shizuna\u2019s mother.Sakie reached her arm out and picked up her glass from the table. She gave the cup filled with wine a shake and poured it down her throat in a sexy motion.\u201c\u2026My, my. It\u2019s as delicious as always, Mr. Manager.\u201d\u201cWhy, thank you. You know, I\u2019d be happy to have you as a regular.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Normally, I don\u2019t come to these places much because of my daughter.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite unfortunate.\u201dWhile Sakie was having a friendly conversation with the manager, Ryuichi was busy thinking about something else. Shizuna was the heroine of the manga, but he could only remember glimpses about her mother. He wondered if there might have been a backstory or hidden reason such as this behind Ryuichi\u2019s easy access to Shizuna.\u201cSo, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll find out about us sooner or later, but let\u2019s try to keep this a secret from her as best as we can. But fufu, I don\u2019t think I even have to suggest this since I\u2019m sure you\u2019d want it that way as well, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. I don\u2019t really care if she ends up hating me, but if she does find out, surely her image of you will change, and it definitely won\u2019t be by some small amount.\u201dHe even thought that it\u2019d be easier to just have Shizuna hate him, but for some reason he could not imagine such a future. Shizuna was an incredibly impulsive and dynamic person who was willing to go to great lengths to close the gap between them, so she might even accept it, surprisingly enough. Nevertheless, there was no way he\u2019d actually tell her everything.\u201cIs that how you see it? If you ask me though\u2026 I don\u2019t think that girl will think the way you said she will.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just speculation, though. Oh, look, she\u2019s coming back.\u201dIt seemed Shizuna had returned. She seemed to have regained her composure and her expression was as usual. However, when Sakie saw Shizuna\u2019s return, Sakie immediately clung to Ryuichi.\u201cW-What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cI guess I\u2019m feeling a little tipsy? His muscles are really something else \u266a.\u201d\u201cGet off of him, Mom!\u201dWith a terrifying look on her face, Shizuna pulled Sakie away from Ryuichi. She seemed frantic and desperate, which was a rare sight, and Sakie laughed as if she found it truly amusing. Then, Shizuna, who perhaps felt a sense of rivalry with Sakie, suddenly closed the distance between her and Ryuichi.\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just wanted to do this.\u201dShe left those few words before closing her mouth. Ryuichi and Shizuna had already finished their meal. Having achieved their initial goal of filling their stomachs, they stood from their seats.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading home first, Mom.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll make sure to get home before it gets too late, too. Ryuichi-kun, please take care of my daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2018Kay.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dShizuna tilted her head in confusion at Sakie\u2019s words, but when Ryuichi started to walk away, she quickly rushed over and made her way next to him. As for Ryuichi, he found today\u2019s reunion chilling, but he was relieved that nothing strange happened. He breathed a sigh of relief, but once they left the bar, it hit him that the crisis wasn\u2019t over just yet.\u201c\u2026Shishido-kun, are you perhaps acquainted with my mother?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d\u201cYou called each other by your first names\u2026 Plus, I could sort of tell from the atmosphere between you two.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe\u2019s got me there.\u00a0Ryuichi scratched his head.\u00a0It seems that in addition to being a woman of impulse, she\u2019s also one of sharpness and intuition\u2026or should I say one of\u00a0observation\u00a0in this case?\u201cWell, we first met each other a while back and went to that bar together. But I didn\u2019t know that Sakie\u2026 I mean,\u00a0she, was your mother, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. You did seem very surprised.\u201dIt seemed Shizuna was satisfied with that explanation. However, she wasn\u2019t done yet. She\u2019d mentioned that Sakie had called Ryuichi by his first name earlier, so in light of that, she said\u2026\u201cCan I\u2026call you by your first name, too?\u201d\u201cMy first name?\u201d\u201cYes. I want you to call me by mine, too\u2026 Please?\u201dCalling each other by their first name. There was no need for Ryuichi to spare the matter a second thought.\u201cGot it. So\u2026 Shizuna?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes \u266a! Ryuichi-kun!\u201dHearing him call her by her first name, Shizuna gave a radiant smile. The two then walked side by side through the brightly lit streets. Although Shizuna was quite close to Ryuichi, Ryuichi was in a relieved state of mind and did not mind at all.\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s why Mom seemed so happy at the time. That must\u2019ve been\u2015\u201dShizuna muttered under her breath and naturally, it wasn\u2019t heard by Ryuichi.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13To Bring Out a Hidden AbilityTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was the day after Ryuichi along with Shizuna went to the bar where they had had an unexpected reunion with Sakie. He wasn\u2019t particularly anxious or anything, but he was somewhat curious about what Shizuna and Sakie might\u2019ve said to each other after the fact. From what he knew of Sakie, she likely wouldn\u2019t say anything risky, and even if Shizuna heard something about them, he couldn\u2019t imagine a future where Shizuna rejected Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026What the hell am I doing? I would\u2019ve never cared about these sorts of things in the past.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019re you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, it\u2019s you, Makoto.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s friend, Makoto, had yet again made it behind Ryuichi without making a sound. From the grin on his face, it seemed he found the rare sight of Ryuichi sighing to be out of character.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Knowing you, though, it probably has something to do with women.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t entirely wrong, so Ryuichi remained silent. Ryuichi had had relationships with many women throughout his life, but it goes without saying that the Ryuichi from before and the Ryuichi after had very different mindsets. One-night stands were one thing, but Ryuichi no longer went around fucking women like a monkey like he did in the past.\u201cWell, maybe you could use a refresher to get your mind off all that crap. Y\u2019know, the\u00a0usual\u00a0place?\u201d\u201c\u2026Maybe.\u201dThe\u00a0usual\u00a0place referred to the party where many men and women gathered to have fun. He crossed his arms and thought about it before eventually deciding that it might be a good idea to go there every once in a while. But just as he was about to nod his head, Shizuna entered the classroom.\u201cGood morning.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cMorning, Rindo-san.\u201dUnlike the time before he got involved with Shizuna, Ryuichi\u2019s gaze was now drawn to her because of yesterday\u2019s events. Shizuna exchanged greetings with her friends, but then she put her bag on the desk and turned around. Naturally, she was looking at Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026Damn, you guys are\u00a0really\u00a0close these days, huh.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t, right?\u201dWhen their eyes met, Shizuna smiled beautifully and came straight up to Ryuichi. Her friends grinned and watched over her amusedly, but on the contrary, Ryuichi could see Sohei from the side, staring at them; perhaps worried about Shizuna.\u201cGood morning, Ryuichi-kun.\u201c\u2026Morning, Rindo.\u201dIt had already become something of a habit for Ryuichi. He had called Shizuna by her\u00a0last\u00a0name instead of her first name. In response, Shizuna puffed out her cheeks and poked Ryuichi on the shoulder.\u201cYou promised me you\u2019d call me Shizuna, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYou forced me to, though\u2026 Haaah. Good morning,\u00a0Shizuna.\u201d\u201c\u2026Good morning! \u266a\u201dShe smiled contentedly at having heard Ryuichi call her by her first name. Of course, everybody else in the classroom heard the two call each other so intimately despite having never called each other in this way before. A small commotion immediately broke out, though Ryuichi had somewhat expected it. Still, he wondered why they were making so much fuss over a simple name call.\u201cSomething definitely must\u2019ve happened between you two.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already told you: nothing happened.\u201dEven though Makoto was Ryuichi\u2019s friend, Ryuichi didn\u2019t intend to say anything to him. But, if Makoto decided to go to the bar and ask the manager, well, he\u2019d find out that Ryuichi and Shizuna had been there together, but Ryuichi decided that he\u2019d cross that bridge when he got to it. Scratching his head, Ryuichi glanced at Shizuna, who was still smiling\u2026and Sohei, who was staring at them, seemingly stunned.\u201cHey, Shishido-kun. Can I have some of your time during lunch?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, sure.\u201d\u201cAlright. See you later, then.\u201dShe waved her hand as she walked over to her friends. Apparently, she\u2019d really come over just to say hello to Ryuichi.\u201cI\u2019mma take a quick leak.\u201d\u201c\u2018Kay, c\u2019ya.\u201dAfter their quick exchange, Ryuichi stood up. There was still plenty of time left, so he could take his time and do his business. As soon as he left the classroom, however, Ryuichi was stopped.\u201cShishido.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you want?\u201dIt was Sohei who\u2019d called out to him. He understood that, as Shizuna\u2019s childhood friend, Sohei was concerned about her since she was getting involved with him. But to be honest, it didn\u2019t matter to him. He knew that this world was the world of a manga, but it was mentally exhausting for him to worry about it.Ryuichi\u2019s body wasn\u2019t being possessed by another person or anything; he\u2019d merely regained his past memories unto his former self who had originally been born into this world. Therefore, this body was his own, and Ryuichi was still Ryuichi Shishido, no matter what.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough Sohei had stopped Ryuichi, he hadn\u2019t said anything at all to him. Ryuichi turned his head around to look at him, but he didn\u2019t seem particularly scared of Ryuichi\u2026 No, actually, he\u00a0did\u00a0seem a little nervous.\u201c\u2026Sorry. It was nothing.\u201dWith that, he quickly turned his back and walked back to the classroom. Ryuichi was tempted to say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything to say, then don\u2019t call me in the first place,\u201d but he decided to head for the restroom first. As usual, when he walked down the hallway, people averted their eyes from him.\u201c\u2026Yaaaawn.\u201dWell, even in the midst of all this, Ryuichi was taking things leisurely at his own pace as he let out a loud yawn.\u201cSo, lunch time, huh\u2026 I bet she had some sort of talk with Sakie.\u201dSo, what on earth would Shizuna tell Ryuichi\u2026? It didn\u2019t take long for him to find out.Once they finished their meals, Ryuichi and Shizuna headed for the rooftop. As usual, the place was wide and empty, so they could talk freely to their hearts\u2019 content here.\u201cSo? What did you want to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well\u2026\u201dShizuna took a deep breath and continued.\u201cI asked Mom after our meeting yesterday. She easily told me about how she\u2019d met you before.\u201d\u201cThat I\u2019d called out to her as she was walking around town?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 That\u2019s about what she told me.\u201dApparently, Sakie hadn\u2019t told her about her sweet night with Ryuichi. It wasn\u2019t surprising, but it was still a bit of a relief for Ryuichi. Plus, surely Shizuna herself wouldn\u2019t want to hear about it, either. That\u2019s what Ryuichi had thought, but Shizuna\u2019s intuition was, once again, very sharp.\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not so childish that I can\u2019t guess what you two did together that night.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying you and my mom slept together\u2026 Am I wrong?\u201dThere was conviction in her question. As she stared straight at him, Ryuichi relented and nodded, thinking that it was impossible to fool her.\u201cSpot on. Yes, I did sleep with your mother. But it was only for that one night.\u201d\u201c\u2026I knew it. I\u2019m pretty sure Mom knows that I know, too, but that didn\u2019t stop her from being in such a good mood whenever she talked about you.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201dRyuichi let out a dumb sound at her sudden thank-you. As has been said many times before, Ryuichi\u00a0slept\u00a0with Shizuna\u2019s mother, Sakie. He couldn\u2019t for the life of him understand why she would thank him instead.\u201cSurely you\u2019ve heard from Mom, right? That my father has passed away.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that Mom\u2019s been looking really sad and lonely lately. I thought that day would be no different, but you showed up and gave my mother happiness, Ryuichi-kun. After Mom came home that day, I noticed her constantly smiling the entire time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs for Ryuichi, the only thing that\u2019d been on his mind at the time was that he\u2019d wanted to have sex with Sakie. Sure, perhaps something to the effect of Shizuna\u2019s words had happened, but he hadn\u2019t done so with such considerate intentions.\u201cYou\u2019ve got it completely wrong. All I wanted to do was sleep with her\u2026 That\u2019s all it was.\u201d\u201cStill, it is an undeniable fact that you put a smile on my mother\u2019s face. You made her smile. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thanking you now.\u201dShizuna was direct and straightforward as she said those words. Ryuichi was fascinated, if only for a moment, by her eyes that showed no signs of hesitation or wavering. But then Ryuichi had a thought. Shizuna and Sakie were similar to each other, so Ryuichi falling in love with Shizuna in the manga may have been due to Sakie\u2019s existence.\u201c\u2026Sure, I\u2019ll take your thanks. Don\u2019t really need it though, and even if it was accidental, I can\u2019t say that me sleeping with your mother was a good thing.\u201dNo sooner had the words left Ryuichi\u2019s mouth than the bell rang. The bell would ring once more five minutes later, but that one would signal the time for classes to start. They had to get back soon.\u201cHey, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026In your eyes, am I a woman you can sleep with?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hah?\u201dJust as he was about to leave, he abruptly stopped his feet. He looked at her quizzically, wondering what on earth she was talking about, but Shizuna\u2019s head was hung low, her face bright red.\u00a0No way, could this be\u2026?\u00a0But Ryuichi immediately ruled out the possibility and chuckled\u2026 Well, for now, he decided to answer her question.\u201cI told you before, didn\u2019t I? You\u2019re a very cute girl, so there are many boys who\u2019re definitely pinning for you. If you slip up, a day might come where\u00a0I\u00a0will attack you myself, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, personally speaking, I do think that you\u2019re an attractive woman\u2026 So, what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026\u201dRyuichi grinned widely. He himself was by no means conscious of it, but his smile carried a ferocity. It was a smile he used to have when he looked at a woman, and now, Shizuna was receiving his predatory eyes straight on.\u201cYou\u2019re obviously a woman I\u2019d take to bed. Happy now?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes! \u266a\u201dA sweet voice leaked out of Shizuna. Ryuichi\u2019s words had threatened to awaken the hidden beast inside Shizuna, trying to bring it out of hiding, but she still seemed able to restrain it.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s head back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShizuna?\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dThe dazed Shizuna followed behind Ryuichi. She stared at his back while they walked back to the classroom from the rooftop. She kept gazing at him with red cheeks and slightly moist eyes.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14I Want You to Come to My HouseTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrShizuna\u2019s heart has been in a constant state of unrest ever since lunchtime.\u201cYou\u2019re obviously a woman I\u2019d take to bed. Happy now?\u201dThose words Ryuichi had told her kept echoing in her head. She had to concentrate on the class, yet if she let her mind wander for the slightest of moments, those words would begin resonating in her head again non-stop. Shizuna\u2019s cheeks were red and she let out a sad sigh; seeing this, her friend sitting next to her seemed to be concerned and called out to her.\u201c\u2026Shizuna, are you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? Oh, sorry.\u201dShizuna came to her senses at the sound of her friend\u2019s voice. She now realized that she had apparently been in such a daze that those around her were worried for her. With a smile, Shizuna assured her friend that she was fine and returned to copying the words on the blackboard into her notebook.\u2026However, Ryuichi\u2019s voice started echoing in Shizuna\u2019s brain again. And by the time Shizuna realized, she found that she hadn\u2019t been copying the words on the blackboard.\u201cRyuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun Ryuichi-kun\u201d\u201c\u2026What on earth has come over me?\u201dHer notebook was filled with Ryuichi\u2019s name. Just as Shizuna was stressing over what on earth she was doing, the bell sounded, signaling the end of class.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dWell, it couldn\u2019t be helped; not after what he\u2019d said during lunchtime.Last night, she\u2019d talked with Sakie after she came back from the bar about Ryuichi. Sakie apparently had no intention of telling Shizuna any of the deeper details, but when she asked Ryuichi, it was different; he\u2019d told her everything.Her mother had had such a beautiful smile on her face and looked so happy that Shizuna couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d seen her make such a radiant smile. She was very happy to see her beloved mother finally enjoying herself, but at the same time, Shizuna felt a pang of jealousy in her heart.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dShe could feel a prickling feeling in her heart just thinking about it.\u00a0She\u00a0wanted to do those kinds of things with Ryuichi herself;\u00a0she\u00a0wanted him to carve out the pleasures of being a woman unto herself, too. Those kinds of naughty desires crept up in her mind. Naturally, Shizuna writhed in agony on the bed afterwards\u2026 but there, she arrived at a thought.\u201c\u2026Am I in love with Ryuichi-kun?\u201dThe moment she muttered that, her heart pulsed loudly again. Unable to stop the pounding of her heart, today arrived, and when she met him at school, the pounding reached its climax.\u201cFufu. \u266a\u201dRemembering those events made Shizuna smile. It wasn\u2019t an uncomfortable or bad feeling, but rather a heart-warming sensation that was almost addictive. She wanted to stay like this forever.\u201cHey, Shizuna; you\u2019ve been weirdly grinning for a while now. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026I-I\u2019m okay.\u201dOops, not good,\u00a0Shizuna thought as she did her best to keep her lips in place. Shizuna, who was having fun talking to her friends until the next class started, naturally turned her attention towards Ryuichi. He, too, seemed to be enjoying himself with his friend\u2026well, actually, he seemed to have a somewhat annoyed expression on his face, but nevertheless, they seemed to be getting along as well as ever.\u201c\u2026Love\u2026huh.\u201dLove. Truthfully speaking, Shizuna had no experience with it. The person she was closest to that was a member of the opposite sex was definitely her childhood friend, Sohei. He had always been by Shizuna\u2019s side, and although he was certainly unreliable in some ways, there were also times when she thought\u00a0she had to take care of him.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, Shizuna felt a gaze on her and looked in that direction. There, she found Sohei, and he was staring at Shizuna. He was smiling happily when their eyes met, but Shizuna took her gaze away from him without reacting in any particular way.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to the bathroom for a bit.\u201d\u201cAlright. See you.\u201dShizuna wanted to calm down a bit anyway. She headed for the restroom and heaved a sigh as she entered a stall. The other students using the restroom were noisy, but it was enough to calm her down. When she finished using the restroom and went out into the hallway, Ryuichi and Makoto were walking in front of her, as if they too were just returning from using the restroom.\u201c\u2026Shall I play a little prank? \u266a\u201dShe slowly approached his back, avoiding detection as best as she could. Just as she was about to poke him in the shoulder, Ryuichi unexpectedly turned around. However, it seemed that Ryuichi hadn\u2019t turned around because he noticed Shizuna was there, and was therefore surprised to see her behind him.\u201cYou\u2026 Were you trying to sneak attack me?\u201d\u201cN-No! I was just trying to give you a little fright\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t peg you as that kind of person. So you do those things too, huh.\u201dIndeed, Shizuna has not done this kind of childish thing for a while. Or rather, she had not done it at all since she became a high school student. She was merely following the mischievous spirit that had sprouted in her unexpectedly when she saw Ryuichi.Shizuna was wondering why she had done that when she received a small shock on her forehead. Ryuichi had lightly flicked her.\u201cThis is punishment for your attempted prank, alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dUnlike the fierce look she had seen in his eyes during lunchtime, Shizuna thought she saw the face of her father, who had died when she was a child, in his eyes that were somehow filled with tenderness. For Shizuna, the only man she could clearly rely on was her father. He loved Shizuna, loved Sakie, and was the mainstay of the family.The death of her father was very devastating not only for Sakie, but also for Shizuna.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSince then, Shizuna has never been spoiled by anyone like a child. She even started catering to Sakie instead; she tried her best not to inconvenience her in order to be considerate of her. But now, Shizuna wanted to be spoiled by him\u2026just a little bit. She wanted to embrace the large, wide back of the dependable Ryuichi; she wanted him to hold her in those big arms of his.\u201c\u2026Y\u2019know, Makoto.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll pass on\u00a0that\u00a0place today, after all.\u201d\u201cOh? Alright. Tell me if you change your mind. There are tons of girls waiting for you.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWith a wave of his hand, Makoto walked away. Shizuna had no idea what their conversation was about, but knowing Ryuichi, she could hazard a guess as to what the general outline of their conversation was.\u201c\u2026Just now, was that\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. We were talking about a party that me and Makoto used to go to a lot. He invited me again this morning, but in the end I decided against it.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 I see.\u201dThe slight feeling of uncertainty in her chest disappeared.Shizuna had truly been plagued by many emotions since she met Ryuichi. She was close to getting an answer, but she was afraid that if she admitted it, she would change. She was afraid that she would only be able to think about Ryuichi, even more than now.\u201cSo, is something on your mind? You don\u2019t seem to be looking too good.\u201d\u201c\u2026You can tell?\u201d\u201cSorta?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fufu, the heck is that?\u201dIt was true; she was in a sentimental mood thinking about her late father. In this respect, she was similar to Sakie: she sometimes felt lonely like this, even though she had already gotten over the past. Perhaps it was because he\u2019d sensed that in her that he\u2019d said something like that despite having no concrete evidence.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cToday\u2026would you like to come to my house?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSurprised, Ryuichi blurted that with his mouth wide open. Shizuna herself did not know why she said this. She just wanted to be with him, even if just a little. She wanted to talk to him, to be close to him, and\u2026to share some time with Ryuichi.\u201cDinner!\u201d\u201cDinner?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make you dinner! Hamburg steaks, anything you want!\u201d\u201c\u2026Gulp.\u201dThe sound of gulping could be heard from Ryuichi\u2019s throat. Last time, Shizuna had made him the meat and potato stew, which Ryuichi had finished off with great relish. Shizuna had felt a definite response that time. She wanted to see the smile that Ryuichi had shown her then, and she also simply wanted him to eat the food she had made.\u201cI\u2019m sure you and my mother have a lot to talk about, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t mind! In fact, I\u2019ll even be listening next to you!\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t\u2026\u201dPerhaps Shizuna herself didn\u2019t know what she was saying because she was trying to bring Ryuichi to her home no matter what. The desperation was clear on Shizuna\u2019s face, and Ryuichi sighed\u2026then, he nodded.Shizuna\u2019s face immediately brightened, and she gave a wide smile, like a big flower blooming.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15A Hungry Stomach and MoreTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrOn his way home from school, Ryuichi glanced at Shizuna walking next to him and wondered how this happened. He was now headed to Shizuna\u2019s house\u2026where he had been invited for dinner.\u201cI\u2019ll make you Hamburg steaks and anything else you want!\u201dRyuichi could still remember how the meat and potato stew she\u2019d made for him last time was really tasty. Unless he had someone to cook for him or unless he absolutely had to cook for himself, he would spend his days constantly consuming instant food. That was why Shizuna\u2019s cooking touched Ryuichi\u2019s heart.\u201cHmm hmm hmm~\u00a0\u266a\u00a0Hmm hmm hmm hmm~\u00a0\u266a\u201dShizuna had been like this ever since they left the school and regrouped with each other after they\u2019d walked part of the way home. Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and she was humming in a good mood as she walked. However, she was walking straight towards a telephone pole in front of her.\u201cShizuna.\u201d\u201cKyah?!\u201dHe grabbed hold of the distracted Shizuna\u2019s shoulder. Shizuna seemed surprised to have her shoulder suddenly grabbed, but Ryuichi let out a big sigh, thinking that he was the one who should be surprised.\u201cU-Umm\u2026 Ryuichi-kun?\u201dShizuna\u2019s cheeks reddened even more than before, and she turned her somewhat expectant eyes on Ryuichi. Ryuichi silently turned his eyes toward the telephone pole, and Shizuna, tilting her head, also looked in that direction and let out a gasp.\u201cO-Oh, sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t space out. I\u2019d hate to see you get injured in front of me.\u201dShizuna hung her head low at Ryuichi\u2019s words, but when Ryuichi patted her on the shoulder, she smiled happily and started walking again. Ryuichi, who was following Shizuna a distance behind her, thought about something as he watched her back.\u2026I feel like everything\u2019s completely changed.He had no idea how many times this thought had crossed his mind, but Ryuichi and Shizuna were originally a couple that never should\u2019ve been.From what Ryuichi could tell at this stage, he would say that he and Shizuna were getting along quite well. Just being invited to her home like this and being treated to dinner was truly a huge difference.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re absolute scum!\u201d\u201cHehe, I know I\u2019m scum. Now, get ready, because you\u2019re about to be changed at the hands of this absolute scum!\u201d\u201c\u2026Sohei-kun\u2026sniff.\u201dIn the manga, this was the scene when Ryuichi first laid his hands on Shizuna. At the time, Shizuna was undoubtedly looking at Ryuichi with disgust in her eyes. It was also the moment when Ryuichi, on the contrary, was so excited by that look that he resolved to make her submit to him and make her his property.\u201cRyuichi-kun? What are you thinking about?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing.\u201dHe obviously couldn\u2019t tell her that he was thinking back to her being raped by him in an alternate universe.\u201cHey, Shizuna. Is this really okay?\u201d\u201cOf course it is! \u266a\u201dShizuna replied with a beautiful smile. Truthfully speaking, Ryuichi had never thought to avoid visiting Shizuna\u2019s house. He was happy to be able to eat delicious food, and he certainly didn\u2019t mind being able to enjoy the company of Sakie and Shizuna, two very beautiful women.After all, I\u2019m still Ryuichi. Sure, I don\u2019t want to cuckold others nor do I want to steal what others hold precious to them anymore\u2026 But, I still can\u2019t help but think that I want to make a woman as beautiful as Shizuna mine.There was something about Shizuna that was different from any woman he had ever had a relationship with, whether it be Chisa or Sakie.\u201cI haven\u2019t told my mom yet, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be happy even if it\u2019s sudden.\u201d\u201cYou do realize it\u2019s only been a day since our bar visit together, right? Seriously\u2026\u201d\u201cFufu, just give it up, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dIt seemed Ryuichi had no choice but to do as she said and give up. He followed Shizuna to her house. Unlike Ryuichi who lived in an apartment, her house was a magnificent house. I had seen a glimpse of its exterior in the manga, but standing in front of it like this, I could tell that it really was an impressive home.\u201cI still remember when I walked you home around here, but this is my first time actually visiting your home, huh.\u201d\u201cYup. Come on in, make yourself at home.\u201dShizuna urged Ryuichi to enter the house. At the same time that he felt a kind of warmth that he could feel even from the entrance, he remembered that there were descriptions of Shizuna being raped in various places in this house. Shizuna\u2019s room, the living room, the balcony, the toilet, the bathroom, the hallway, and even this entranceway had all become scenes depicted in the manga.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, sorry.\u201dShizuna noticed as soon as Ryuichi started to think strange thoughts. He knew she couldn\u2019t actually see through his thoughts, but he still couldn\u2019t underestimate how sharp she was. They went to the living room, and Shizuna served him a simple glass of juice.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. \u266a\u201dHe picked up the glass and drank the citrus juice. The cold sensation felt good as it went down his throat. Shizuna kept smiling and staring at Ryuichi while he drank the juice. Of course, being stared at made him uncomfortable, so he was about to point this out to her when the intercom rang.Ding dong!\u201cWho could it be\u2026? Sorry, please give me a moment.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI saw Shizuna off as she went to answer the door and drank from my cup again, but because the door was open, I could hear the conversation from the front door.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cErr, I just wanted to ask if you want to have dinner together.\u201dThe person with whom Shizuna was talking was a man, and Ryuichi recognized his voice. It belonged to Sohei, Shizuna\u2019s childhood friend. It seemed that he had come to invite Shizuna to dinner. Since they had known each other since childhood and lived close to each other, this was probably a usual occurrence over their many years together. However, all he could say was that Sohei had chosen a bad time. He couldn\u2019t speak for others, but Ryuichi knew that Shizuna would likely refuse.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Could we go out some other time?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, okay\u2026 Are you having somebody over?\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cWell, the shoes\u2026\u201dSohei had apparently noticed Ryuichi\u2019s shoes. Well, he hadn\u2019t expected Sohei to visit like this, so obviously he hadn\u2019t hidden them. Shizuna hadn\u2019t asked him to do such a tedious thing, and Ryuichi didn\u2019t mind such things either.\u201cWhether I have a visitor or not doesn\u2019t matter, does it? Is that all? Now, if you\u2019d excuse me.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026 Wait, Shizuna!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird lately! Why\u2026 Why have you changed so much?!\u201d\u201c\u2026I haven\u2019t changed at all, though.\u201dRyuichi knew what Sohei meant. Sitting leisurely on the couch drinking his juice, Ryuichi wanted to tell Shizuna that it wasn\u2019t good for her to raise her voice like that, even though it wasn\u2019t his place to say such things.Well, I\u2019m the one who caused it, after all.For now, Ryuichi got ready to move. Their conversation did not end, and Sohei\u2019s tone became more forceful. He forcibly probed her, asking her why and what was going on.\u201cHey, Sohei-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat is it\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you have to say all that? What are you to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dSohei\u2019s dismay was palpable even to Ryuichi. Quietly and calmly, Shizuna continued to speak to Sohei as if to admonish him.\u201cIt is my right, and my right alone to decide who and what kind of people I associate with. It is not for others to decide.\u201d\u201c\u2018Others\u2019\u2026? But we\u2019re childhood friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cYes, we are. But just because we\u2019re childhood friends doesn\u2019t mean I have to obey every single thing you ask of me, Sohei-kun. Really, I appreciate your concern for me, but my life is none of your business.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shizuna!\u201d\u201cGo home. I have to prepare dinner now.\u201dRyuichi heard the door close with a loud slam. Of course she\u2019d close the door after she said all that. Sohei did not open it again, perhaps because he could not say anything more.\u201cSorry for the wait\u2026 Oh? What\u2019re you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah~.\u201dCaught loitering in front of the living room door, Ryuichi scratched his cheek and looked away. Shizuna, perhaps realizing his intentions, giggled and put her hand over her mouth, but her expression quickly clouded.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. I can\u2019t believe he said all that without knowing anything about you.\u201d\u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s because he\u00a0does\u00a0know who I am.\u201dIt was ironic how Sohei\u2019s words did not reach Shizuna, not in this world or in the other world, regardless of Shizuna\u2019s state. Shizuna\u2019s face was downcast; seeing this, Ryuichi put his hand on her chin and forcibly lifted it, causing her to look up at him.\u201c?!\u201d\u201cKeep your head up. I don\u2019t care about what he said, and neither should you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dSeeing Shizuna\u2019s expression still gloomy, Ryuichi put his hand on her back. When he had done this with Chisa and Sakie, the girls had calmed down. He had thought that this would work for Shizuna, too, but then he reconsidered that this was probably not the way to do it.Just as he was about to pull his hand back, Shizuna leaned forward and hugged Ryuichi.\u201cShizuna?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hug me. Don\u2019t stop.\u201dRyuichi was surprised, but put his arm around Shizuna\u2019s back to meet her request. In his arms, Shizuna let out a sigh and looked up to see Ryuichi\u2019s face. Her beautiful eyes were so clear that they seemed to absorb everything.\u201cIt really puts me at ease when you hug me like this.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, Chisa and Sakie both said the same thing, too. That they felt good to be hugged like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a point deduction, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou heard me right: a point deduction\u2026 But since I\u2019m really happy right now, I\u2019ll give you some plus points.\u201dShizuna then pressed her face against Ryuichi\u2019s chest. She stayed that way for a while and continued until Sakie returned shortly thereafter.\u201cYou\u2019ve been acting strange lately, Shizuna! Why\u2026 Why did you change so much?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t change at all. I just came to know his wonderful side. I\u2026have been dyed by him. Hey, Sohei-kun. He\u2019s seriously incredible, you know?\u201dHe\u2019d asked the same question, but her reply this time was entirely different.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16The Moment that Something ChangedTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cWhat a surprise. I didn\u2019t expect to see you here the moment I arrived home, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cI just couldn\u2019t resist Shizuna\u2019s invitation for dinner.\u201dSakie let out a giggle at Ryuichi\u2019s words.Last time, Shizuna had asked Ryuichi for a hug and he did as she asked. She didn\u2019t pull away from him for a while, but thanks to Sakie who seemingly came back at just the right time, Shizuna pulled away from Ryuichi.She was currently taking a bath, and Ryuichi was talking with Sakie, who was in the middle of cooking. Sakie had certainly been surprised, but she must have been happy as well, because she kissed Ryuichi as soon as Shizuna was gone.\u201cI saw Sohei-kun on my way home. He looked like he still had something to say, so I could more or less tell what happened.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything to him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to. It\u2019s all Shizuna\u2019s decision, and I won\u2019t deny what she\u2019s decided unless it\u2019s a very bad one.\u201dThat meant that basically, she would rather side with Ryuichi rather than Sohei. She likely wouldn\u2019t say anything against Ryuichi no matter what choice he made. That was just how much the events of that night had instilled in her feelings for Ryuichi. She would never smile at someone she disliked, much less kiss them herself.\u201cPhew, I feel refreshed \u266a! Are you gonna head in the bath too, Mom?\u201dAs they were conversing, Shizuna came back from her bath. He had seen her in many outfits in the manga, but for what it\u2019s worth, Ryuichi had actually only ever seen her in her uniform in this world. She\u2019d been in her uniform too when they went to the bar the other day, so this was his first time seeing her in something other than a uniform.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dAfter Sakie left the living room, Ryuichi started staring at Shizuna intently. Her flushed cheeks were sexy, as she had just finished her bath, and Shizuna now looked totally relaxed in her casual wear. The pink-toned pajamas suited her, and her breasts, though not to the point of bursting, were violently asserting their fullness.Man, I thought this when Chisa was here too, but why do women look so sexy after taking a bath?Ryuichi laughed and brushed it off as a matter that would be an eternal mystery. The fact that he wasn\u2019t embarrassed to see Shizuna like this was simply a sign of his extensive experience with women. He had had relations with countless women before and was used to seeing them naked, so there was no way he would be embarrassed by something like this after all this time.\u201cDo I look\u2026weird?\u201dShizuna, however, seemed to think the reason she was being stared at was because it didn\u2019t suit her. Ryuichi chuckled, saying that was not true.\u201cI was just taking in the sight of you in your pajamas. Oh, but I think you look really good in them. You look so sexy, I\u2019m tempted to push you down right now.\u201d\u201cI-I see\u2026 \u266a\u201dRyuichi wasn\u2019t lying when he said that. The previous Ryuichi would have pushed her down without question, devoured her lips, and squeezed her bountiful breasts. Then, he would rush straight into sex, where a night of pleasure would ensue\u2026\u00a0It almost feels like the plot of an erotic manga,\u00a0Ryuichi secretly thought to himself.\u201cWow\u2026 It\u2019s pretty hot in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cReally? It ain\u2019t even May, though\u2026 Or maybe you\u2019re just hot cos you\u2019re fresh out of the bath?\u201d\u201cMaybe. But it\u2019s still hot\u2026 Yup, definitely a little too hot!\u201dWith that, Shizuna unbuttoned one of the buttons on her pajamas. He could almost hear a\u00a0boing\u00a0sound effect as her ample bosom was exposed, revealing a well-shaped cleavage. However, Ryuichi was familiar with the sight. Instead of looking away from the exciting sight, he stared at it with all his might.\u201c\u2026Urk.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it in the first place if you\u2019re only going to get embarrassed.\u201dIt seemed that his staring had made\u00a0her\u00a0the one who got embarrassed instead.Shizuna then started cooking, seemingly taking over from Sakie. Ryuichi smiled, thinking that it was quite enjoyable to watch someone cooking like this. Ryuichi wanted to help out, too, and tried to stand next to her, but was promptly turned down.\u201cI told you last time, didn\u2019t I? You can\u2019t cook, Ryuichi-kun, so sit.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dAs evident from previous occasions, Ryuichi was below average when it came to cooking. Therefore, he had no choice but to follow Shizuna\u2019s words. It was another day where he, who had a much larger body than Shizuna, shrank back a little.However, such frustrations of his were blown away by the finished meal sitting before him.\u201c\u2026Holy crap this looks amazing. You\u2019re seriously a genius, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cFufu, thank you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dSoon, Sakie returned, having finished her cooking as well, so Ryuichi\u2019s dinner was bumped up into a feast in no time. Since both Sakie and Shizuna had cooked the food, he remembered to thank not only Shizuna, but Sakie as well. Both of them happily returned his words of thanks and smiled at Ryuichi as he proceeded to eat his fill.In addition to the promised Hamburg steak, there were also fried chicken and fried white fish, both of which were said to be favorites of boys, yet despite the large amount of food, Ryuichi devoured almost all of them. There were times when his hand stopped moving halfway through, but each time it did, Shizuna and Sakie would offer him something to eat, so Ryuichi had no opportunity for breaks.\u201c\u2026Phew, that was seriously good, Shizuna. Hands down the best meal I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\u201cGlad to hear it. Seeing you enjoy the food so much\u2026well, makes me really happy, too.\u201dAfter dinner, Ryuichi was visiting Shizuna in her room. He had planned on leaving immediately afterwards, but apparently Shizuna didn\u2019t want to let Ryuichi go home yet. There was no one to scold Ryuichi if he came home late\u2026and besides, even if his parents were still alive, they wouldn\u2019t get angry at him.\u201cI have to say, though; your room\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d\u201cCompared to yours, sure.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring up my old trash-filled room\u2026 Just remembering it is making me sad.\u201d\u201cFufu! It was truly a disaster in there, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cShut up, you.\u201dRyuichi removed his gaze from Shizuna, who started giggling, and looked around her room again.The room was very clean, as one would expect from a girl, and there wasn\u2019t a single unnecessary thing inside, leaving the room feeling wide and spacious. The fact that he couldn\u2019t find even a strand of hair on the carpet suggested that the room was cleaned on a regular basis. Well, cleaning should\u00a0be done on a regular basis, anyways; Ryuichi was just the weird one for not having done so before.Once Ryuichi finished his survey of her room, he got straight to the point. Turning toward Shizuna, who was sitting down next to him, he looked at her, and her body jumped with a start as their eyes met.\u201cSo, why did you call me to your room? You said you only wanted to talk, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not all there is to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dShizuna took a deep breath before continuing.\u201cYou remember how I asked you about whether I was a woman you\u2019d sleep with or not, right?\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, yeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026You see, I still don\u2019t really know what love is.\u201dShizuna put her hand on her chest as she spoke, and continued by saying she didn\u2019t understand what love was, which was why she wanted to learn more about it.\u201cIt was by chance that I got to know you Ryuichi-kun, but from that moment on, you have always been on my mind. Every word you say flusters my heart. I think about all kinds of lewd things, but every time I do, you always come to my mind, Ryuichi-kun. I get jealous when I hear about you and my mother, as well as the college girl.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dWhether it was love or not was still up for debate, but Shizuna was certainly feeling a very strong feeling of liking for Ryuichi right now. It might do her some good if Ryuichi told her that she was only misunderstanding her feelings, but he felt it\u2019d be cruel to deny her feelings when she was trying so hard to convey them to him.\u201cI\u2019m not asking to go out with you, nor am I saying I want us to be a couple right now. For now, all I want is some sort of relationship with you, Ryuichi-kun. I\u2026want to be one of those girls you have\u00a0relations\u00a0with, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you serious?\u201d\u201cYes, I am very serious.\u201dShizuna nodded confidently. For Ryuichi, Shizuna\u2019s goodwill was gratifying, but whether that meant they could actually become lovers was a different story. Ryuichi wasn\u2019t in a place to comment about others himself, but still, he felt that Shizuna was also quite crazy for saying those kinds of words\u2026\u201c\u2026You know, this is a first for me.\u201d\u201cA first?\u201d\u201cYeah. Up until now, I\u2019ve only fucked women for the sake of fucking them. For pleasure, basically\u2026 But this is the first time I\u2019ve had so much trouble taking a woman up on their offer after they\u2019ve clearly told me to my face that they want to be fucked by me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Am I that unattractive to you?\u201dApparently, Shizuna took Ryuichi\u2019s words to mean that she was unattractive herself. Ryuichi laughed at the dejected look in the corner of her eye and grabbed her arm as he pulled her close to him.\u201cAh. \u266a\u201d\u201cYou sure you won\u2019t regret this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure. One hundred percent.\u201dWhen she nodded, he brought his face close to hers and took her lips. If that\u2019s what Shizuna says, then Ryuichi had nothing more to say. All he had to do now was to eat up the beauty in front of him\u2026 Thus, Ryuichi immediately shifted gears and moved on as if it was business as usual.He put all the \u2018heroine\u2019 and \u2018NTR\u2019 thoughts behind him and immersed himself in their own world, far from love, where all they cared about was pleasure.\u201cI never would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d turn out to be such a dirty human being. I\u2019m sure the child who inherits your blood will be just like you.\u201d\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t know anything about that \u2018inheriting\u2019 stuff. All I have to say is: Yes, I did give birth to you, but to be honest, you\u2019re such a waste of money and a pain in the ass.\u201dFor a moment, the voices of his two parents, who he\u2019d almost completely forgotten, came back to him, but Ryuichi could only think about Shizuna\u2019s body and thus, the voices faded back into obscurity.\u201c\u2026You know\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019d refused, I would\u2019ve faked some tears and asked why you\u2019d done it so readily with my mother and not me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how desperate you were?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 My heart was a little scared, but my body was very honest.\u201d\u201cHehe, what a naughty body you have.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say it out loud. \u266a\u201dNaturally, both Ryuichi and Shizuna knew that this was the moment something changed between them.Afterword:For the sake of the story and the characters, I couldn\u2019t just conveniently write the story as: \u201cI like you, please go out with me,\u201d \u201cOkay, sure,\u201d \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get down to it.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ryuichi, who had gotten out of bed a step ahead of Shizuna, chuckled at the sight. Well, it goes without saying that Ryuichi, too, couldn\u2019t easily brush off what they just did.\u201cDo you still feel pain anywhere?\u201d\u201c\u2026There aren\u2019t any painful spots anymore, but there\u00a0is\u00a0this strange feeling lingering.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is at first.

He was currently wearing nothing but his pants; his upper body was completely bare, and his strong body was being exposed in all its glory. On the other hand, Shizuna, who was hidden under the blanket, was wearing nothing at all. This meant only one thing: they\u2019d done the act from start to finish. Of course, they were both observing the proper boundaries they\u2019d set beforehand.\u201c\u2026Why did you say \u2018nevermind\u2019?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDoes that mean\u2026you won\u2019t do it with me anymore?\u201dHer voice sounded very sad, yet at the same time slightly hopeful. Not expecting Shizuna to say this much, Ryuichi\u2019s eyes opened wide in amazement, but he immediately reached out his arm and patted her head.\u201cGeez, you\u2019re a cute little one, aren\u2019t ya? So? Are you saying you still want to do this with me in the future?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve already become one of your sex friends, Ryuichi-kun. I know this relationship isn\u2019t right in the eyes of the public, but I can\u2019t stop my feelings for you. That\u2019s why I hope we can continue what we have between us.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 C\u2019mere, Shizuna.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes! \u266a\u201dWhen he ordered her to come, Shizuna immediately cast the blanket aside and jumped into Ryuichi\u2019s chest. Because she was wearing nothing, her body was in full view of Ryuichi. She possessed beautiful white skin, but also a figure that was so far beyond any typical high school student; even after all was said and done, her body was just so attractive\u2026that it continuously aroused his lust.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun \u266a. I love you\u2026 I love you so much~.\u201dThey were only touching each other, yet the expression on Shizuna\u2019s face was the happiest Ryuichi had ever seen. Since it was her first time, Ryuichi had been careful not to be too rough on her to avoid hurting her. Shizuna\u2019s masochistic side, which had occasionally shown itself from beneath her purity and innocence, had been on full display despite it being her first time.\u201cI have to say, Shizuna, you were pretty wild back there. If that was your first time, I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what kind of beast you\u2019ll turn into later.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring that up\u2026 But you know, Ryuichi-kun\u2014the only person I\u2019ll show that side of me to is you and you alone.\u201d\u201cHow sweet of you to say.\u201dShizuna looked up at Ryuichi as he stole her lips. Normally, a kiss in Ryuichi and Shizuna\u2019s relationship would make them all shy and flustered. Shizuna, however, was not shy at all. She only blushed slightly on her cheeks and asked for more and more kisses.\u201c\u2026Umm\u2026 Even though it was my first time, it felt really good. But somehow, I could tell that you being good at it had a part to play in that. You must be used to it, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah, pretty much. I\u2019ve slept with women older than you, and I understand to some extent what I should do to make girls happy. But even without that, you\u2019re a very simple and easy-to-understand girl, y\u2019know? You basically like it rough, don\u2019tcha?\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez!\u201dRyuichi laughed as Shizuna hit his chest over and over. Ryuichi\u2019s hand had been on her breasts the whole time they were talking. The richness of her breasts, which spilled out even when he supported them with his hands, was something she\u2019d inherited from Sakie, but Shizuna\u2019s reactions were by and far much stronger and more intense compared to Sakie during the act. As expected of a manga heroine; she was, in a sense, gifted to be able to be so wild during her first time.\u201cO-Oh\u2026! Hit me there\u2026!!!\u201dHer reactions had been so good that Ryuichi had been even more excited than usual, which was something Ryuichi decided to reflect on.\u201c\u2026But, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dDoing the act with Shizuna made Ryuichi realize that he had more chemistry with her than with any other partner he\u2019d ever had before. Ryuichi didn\u2019t dislike Shizuna, and as for Shizuna, she was completely and undoubtedly fond of Ryuichi. That was probably why their bodies matched each other so well.\u201cYour body is the best I\u2019ve ever had. I think we have great chemistry, you and I.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see \u266a. Fufu, hearing that makes me very happy!\u201dA normal person would\u2019ve at least given it some more thought, but nevertheless, Shizuna smiled happily like a child who had been praised. They then started chatting with each other while naked, but it dawned on them that they still had school the next day.\u201cI should be getting home soon. We\u2019ve got school tomorrow and all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201dShe was clearly depressed. When Ryuichi told her that he\u2019d come visit again sometime, Shizuna smiled and managed to put away her sad expression. Once he finished getting dressed and made his way to the entrance, Shizuna and even Sakie too came to see him off.\u201cCome back soon. I\u2019ll make you a more luxurious meal when you do.\u201d\u201cSeriously? I should come back ASAP\u2026\u201dRyuichi felt like he was being baited and tamed by their cooking. But even so, it was an undeniable fact that their food was really good. So good, in fact, that he wished he could eat it every day. There was a saying that goes, \u201cThe quickest way to a man\u2019s heart is through their stomach,\u201d and that may be exactly what is happening to Ryuichi right now. After they said their farewells, Ryuichi walked out the front door while Shizuna put on her jacket.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026Umm.\u201dHe wondered if she had something to say to him, but Shizuna seemed to be hesitating. Perhaps she\u2019d forgotten something, or perhaps she had something else to say to him. Ryuichi patiently waited for her, and eventually, Shizuna opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know anything about you, Ryuichi-kun. All I know for sure is that you aren\u2019t the type of person the rumors say you are.\u201d\u201cThey aren\u2019t actually wrong, though.\u201dHis values had changed, but his essence remained the same. In fact, the rumors had been one hundred percent true up until recently.\u201cFirst of all, I slept with your\u00a0mother, and I even slept with you even though we aren\u2019t dating. Sex friends\u2026isn\u2019t quite the term I\u2019d use for us, but it\u2019s close enough. For high school students, that\u2019s a twisted relationship.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind, though. It\u2019s what I wanted, after all\u2026 Sure, I might not be able to tell my friends about us being sex friends, but that\u2019s nothing to me. This is how I want our relationship to be.\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dStraightforward as ever, this one,\u00a0Ryuichi thought. She was indeed a heroine. Although she was a fallen one, the Shizuna in front of him had a heart so strong that he couldn\u2019t feel that impression from her at all. She was dazzling, and Ryuichi honestly commented about that to the current Shizuna.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re pure white, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes were wide in surprise at Ryuichi\u2019s quiet mutter. Ryuichi continued.\u201cIf I am a dull, pitch black color, then you, Shizuna, are a pure, white color that will never be stained no matter what. No matter what I do, you will remain a pure, untainted dye of white\u2026 You\u2019re a dazzling, beautiful color.\u201dThat was all he said before he turned away. He started walking, waving her farewell, but immediately he felt a small impact that had hit his back. He felt her arms wrapped around his stomach; a pair of large, soft mounds on his back; and her forehead pressing against him.\u201cI can\u2019t really go home like this, can I?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. Please let me be like this for a bit.\u201dIt was somewhat cold outside, but he let Shizuna do as she pleased. Then, seemingly in response to Ryuichi, she let out a quiet mutter of her own.\u201cJust like I said before, I really don\u2019t know anything about you as a person, Ryuichi-kun. I don\u2019t know why you looked so pained as if you were enduring something while we were having sex, or why you occasionally switch between a kind, caring look and a derogatory, condescending look toward women at times.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201dThose words struck deep within Ryuichi\u2019s heart. He felt as if somebody had taken a peek into his heart. However, because it was Shizuna, he did not feel uncomfortable. He was more puzzled as to how she knew.Before he knew it, he\u2019d unknowingly grabbed the hand that she\u2019d wrapped around his waist. It was cold, of course, but at the same time it held warmth.\u201cIf the time comes when you decide to tell me everything, I\u2019d be more than happy to lend an ear. You said it yourself, didn\u2019t you? That I am an untainted white. So please don\u2019t worry. No matter what happens, there will always be a color beside you that will never change. I will always be there for you, as a strong color that will paint away your anxieties.\u201dIt was such a cliche-sounding line. But even so, they were words that expressed Shizuna\u2019s character to the fullest. He could see that she was indeed a genuine heroine. It didn\u2019t matter what he remembered from the original world\u2014seeing her opened his eyes to the beauty of human nature, whether he wanted to or not.Laying his hand on hers, Ryuichi gently unclasped her hand.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have to head home soon or else we\u2019ll end up sticking to each other all night. I\u2019ll see you later, Shizuna.\u201c\u2026Okay. Can I have one last kiss, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWithout a hint of hesitation, Ryuichi placed his hand on Shizuna\u2019s cheek and kissed her. Finally, Ryuichi pulled away from Shizuna and began walking back to his apartment.\u201c\u2026A shit ton of things happened today, huh.\u201dHe thought back to the day\u2019s events. To him, the time they\u2019d spent together had been unimaginably sweet, like honey. And at the same time, he hadn\u2019t expected the words Shizuna had told him before they parted.\u201c\u2026I guess that means that, in the end, I\u2019m still your son, huh, you shitty asshole.\u201dThe values within him, and the way he thought about women; he ruefully complained about the source of all his twisted parts\u2026 However, Ryuichi knew. He knew that despite his words, he himself was the worst of them all.The face of the woman who\u2019d smiled filthily at him; her ugly voice that declared him to be a waste of money and a pain in the ass\u2026they all threatened to make Ryuichi depressed, but Shizuna\u2019s smile and words came back to him like sunlight shining into his heart.\u201c\u2026I guess\u2026it ain\u2019t too bad.\u201dWith this tiny mutter, he promptly made his way back to his home. His steps were light, and his expression was a tad bit cheerful.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18The Hidden Truth is a Little DarkTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrA father and a mother\u2014parents, so to speak\u2014are very important to children. It is no exaggeration to say that they are indispensable for children to maintain peace of mind, so much so that the way they are treated by their parents determines how they will grow up.For Ryuichi, however, the existence of his parents only had a negative effect on him.\u201cWhy did I have to get married to somebody like you\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up. How the fuck am I supposed to know? Also, you\u2019re the one who made me pregnant and give birth to this brat, aren\u2019t you? You do something about him.\u201dHis father was an ordinary businessman and his mother was an ordinary office worker, but\u2026 although Ryuichi\u2019s father was still a good man, his mother was an unbelievable lunatic. She had affairs with many men and had sexual relations with them, claiming it was \u2018normal.\u2019When Ryuichi\u2019s father discovered this, the mother turned upon her family and spoke the nastiest of words to both her husband and Ryuichi. Ryuichi\u2019s mother talked about Ryuichi\u2019s birth as if it were a stain in her past she wanted to forget, and his father kept him at a distance because he had his mother\u2019s blood running through his veins, even though he was supposed to be his own son\u2026 Ryuichi\u2019s family environment was truly abysmal.\u201cI don\u2019t want to think of you as my son.\u201d\u201cA brat like you ain\u2019t no son of mine.\u201dAnybody\u2019s mind would be warped by such a childhood.Ryuichi hated his father, who never spared any love or care for him, and he hated his mother even more, who looked down on weak men and treated her own son like trash. Seeing his mother like that made Ryuichi think that all women were scum like her.In the end, both of Ryuichi\u2019s parents passed away early due to illness, so Ryuichi was taken in by his father\u2019s family, who didn\u2019t treat him well either. In the eyes of Ryuichi\u2019s grandparents, their son\u2019s wife was a woman who\u2019d hidden the fact that she\u2019d been constantly cheating on her husband, and the moment she got exposed, she did a complete one-eighty and abused their son. Therefore, it stood to reason that they wouldn\u2019t want to see the face of that woman\u2019s son\u2014somebody who\u2019d inherited her blood.\u201cRyuichi, could you please live by yourself? We\u2019ll make sure to send you money.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, we really wanted you to live with us, but\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRyuichi could still remember how he\u2019d laughed at his grandparents\u2014at the balls they\u2019d had to spout such blatant lies to his face. In Ryuichi\u2019s former world, he would never have been left in such a poor environment. However, this was Ryuichi\u2019s hidden past, a fact that one would\u2019ve never found out by reading the manga alone.\u201c\u2026Hrmm?\u201dRyuichi awoke to the sound of birds chirping outside. With his mind still fuzzy, he looked around and finally remembered the events of yesterday. He had visited Shizuna\u2019s house, was served food, and then slept with her in her room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf Ryuichi had to be honest, he felt like he\u2019d royally screwed up. Things had gone so far off-track from the original course of events in this world that it had become completely unfixable. Sure, it could be said that in a sense, Ryuichi sleeping with Shizuna was an inevitability\u2014a done deal\u2014but their current relationship was just too abnormal.\u201c\u2026Heh, I\u2019d never have thought things would turn out like this.\u201dEven now, he could still remember it if he closed his eyes. The image of Shizuna beautifully disheveled in his arms, her body gradually being beaten into pleasure by his hands; they kept resurfacing in his mind again and again. It was the same as always; there wasn\u2019t anything different than when he\u2019d slept with any other woman\u2026 But he couldn\u2019t deny the fact that he felt an inexplicable sense of ease at the sight of her.\u201cIf the time comes when you decide to tell me everything, I\u2019d be more than happy to lend an ear. You said it yourself, didn\u2019t you? That I am an untainted white. So please don\u2019t worry. No matter what happens, there will always be a color beside you that will never change. I will always be there for you, as a strong color that will paint away your anxieties.\u201dThe words she\u2019d uttered with an earnest look in her eyes; that, too, kept echoing in his mind. It was as if she was affirming everything about Ryuichi, accepting everything about him, and telling him that she would walk together with him.\u201cMan\u2026 Shizuna\u2026 You\u2019re one hell of a heroine.\u201dHe questioned why they\u2019d made such a good girl into the heroine of an erotic manga. In Ryuichi\u2019s opinion, she\u2019d have been massively popular if she were the heroine of a regular\u00a0shounen\u00a0manga.He did some stretches to ease his body before he stood up. Then, wondering what the hell he was thinking about, Ryuichi said, \u201cGuess I\u2019ll go make breakfast.\u201dPigs were probably taking flight somewhere\u2026or not. But Ryuichi making breakfast was, frankly speaking, just that unusual of an event. He essentially never cooked for breakfast; he would just buy some bread at a convenience store and leave it at that. That\u2019s why it was massive to hear that Ryuichi would be making breakfast.First, he cooked some rice in a microwave, then he transferred it to a bowl. After topping it with a raw egg, he poured soy sauce on top and stirred everything together. Finally, his bowl of\u00a0tamago kake gohan\u00a0was\u00a0ready to eat.\u201c\u2026Damn, that\u2019s good.\u201dSure, it was a simple dish, but it was still plenty delicious. He promptly finished up the meal, got ready for school, and left the apartment.\u201c\u2026But I have to say, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had that nostalgic dream.\u201dThat was what Ryuichi had to say about the dream he had today. It was a memory of the parents that\u2019d been with him when he was a child\u2026 It was far from your normal memory, however, as it was one of the worst memories he had.\u201cAin\u2019t no way in hell this sort of family is normal. That\u2019s gotta be manga logic at play.\u201dIt was the picture-perfect example of a broken family. It was understandable that it\u2019d caused Ryuichi to become distorted, but that didn\u2019t mean he thought the things he\u2019d done so far were right. He hadn\u2019t committed anything close to a crime throughout his life, but even so, he wasn\u2019t living his life in a way that anyone could sympathize with.\u201c\u2026Yaaaawn.\u201dA big yawn leaked out of his mouth. He was on his way to school, but he wasn\u2019t particularly concerned about how he should face Shizuna. He certainly held her in a somewhat special light compared to others, but that didn\u2019t mean he was going to change the way he treated her. He was just going to treat her as a classmate, as a friend, and as a man and a woman in a physical relationship.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAs he was walking down the road to school, he spotted a familiar face.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dWith their lustrous black hair fluttering in the wind, they looked back at Ryuichi\u2015it was Shizuna. She was standing there as if she\u2019d been waiting for him, even though they\u2019d made no plans to meet. The instant their eyes met, she ran up to Ryuichi with a big smile on her face.\u201cGood morning, Ryuichi-kun!\u201d\u201cOof\u2026\u201dShizuna embraced Ryuichi as if jumping into the arms of her long-lost love. She looked up at Ryuichi as he caught her and smiled, her cheeks slightly reddening. Her smile, which truly charmed everyone, made Ryuichi smile unknowingly as well.\u201cGeez, don\u2019t just jump into people\u2019s arms without warning.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me this time. After all, I\u2019ve been wanting to do this ever since we parted yesterday. \u266a\u201dApparently, yesterday\u2019s events had greatly unshackled Shizuna. She\u2019d said she didn\u2019t have experience with love, so skipping a ton of steps and jumping straight into a physical relationship must\u2019ve caused many changes in her. It was by no means a bad change at all, but instead a sign that she had completely removed her walls against Ryuichi.\u201cWhat if somebody sees us?\u201d\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t really mind. Oh, but, I know you wouldn\u2019t want that, Ryuichi-kun, so unwilling as I am, I\u2019ll let go of you.\u201dAlthough she said she\u2019d let go of him, she didn\u2019t mention leaving his side. And leave his side she didn\u2019t, because all she did was let go of him before they stared at each other from point-blank range. They\u2019d become so close because of their secret relationship which had changed drastically through yesterday\u2019s events.\u201cRyuichi-kun, staring at each other like this is nice and all, but I think we should get going now.\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201dThus, the two of them started walking together. Ryuichi glanced at Shizuna walking next to him, but he could not see much change. Perhaps he\u2019d just peeled off her outer layer, but he could feel that she\u2019d matured slightly as a woman.\u201cHmm? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNah, I was just remembering our night yesterday.\u201dWhen Ryuichi said this with a grin, Shizuna\u2019s face quickly turned red, as if she too had just remembered. He thought she\u2019d avert her gaze, but instead she remained staring at him. Her eyes slightly moistened, she put a finger to her mouth and said the following words.\u201cI kept thinking about it, too\u2026all the way until I went to bed yesterday. It was something so naughty and lecherous, but I couldn\u2019t help it, I was so happy. It feels as if something inside me has changed, but I don\u2019t hate it\u2026because you\u2019re the one I did it with, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you to say.\u201dAfter making sure no one was around, Ryuichi took Shizuna in his arms. When he took the opportunity to place his hand on her ample breasts, she gasped in surprise, but nevertheless, she didn\u2019t shake him off and let him do as he pleased.\u201cGeez\u2026we\u2019re outside right now, you know?\u201d\u201cThe way you phrased it; does that mean if we\u2019re at home or something, I can do whatever I want?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019d love for you to touch me as much as you\u2019d like, and maybe even more.\u201dIt seemed that Ryuichi had changed her more than he\u2019d thought. As has been said many times before, her outward appearance hadn\u2019t changed and no one would notice. Still, something about her had certainly changed, and whether or not it would surface and become known to many people\u2026was something that even Ryuichi did not know the answer to as of now.\u201cYou should\u2019ve never been born.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201dThe voice of Ryuichi\u2019s mother resurfaced in his mind like a curse, and he quietly clicked his tongue in annoyance. Little did he know, though, that Shizuna had been watching him with a worried look on her face.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19What Ryuichi is to ShizunaTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrAlthough there wasn\u2019t any visible change in Shizuna, there was definitely an emotional one. She couldn\u2019t deny the fact that she\u2019d rushed through her relationship with Ryuichi, but even so she was still happy. She mentioned it when she saw Ryuichi this morning, but she really could not forget what they\u2019d done last night. If she let her mind wander a little, she would unconsciously break out into a grin and repeatedly cause her friends to worry about what was wrong.\u2026Ryuichi-kun.For a long time now, all she could think about was him. It was true that he\u2019d been rough with her in bed, but he had cared for Shizuna the entire time. Despite the initial pain she\u2019d felt, she struggled to keep her voice down afterward because of how good he was.\u201c\u2026?!\u201dHaving the memory resurface in her mind all of a sudden flustered her, and she made a loud racket. Her classmates and even the teacher grew concerned, but of course there was no way she could say she\u2019d been distraught over something like this, so all Shizuna could do was quietly bow her head and apologize.\u201cShizuna? Are you really okay?\u201d\u201cI am\u2026 Really, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe was embarrassed, but joy quickly filled her heart, quickly replacing said embarrassment. Ryuichi\u2019s seat was in the back of the room, so she had to turn around if she wanted to see his face. Of course, since they were in the middle of class, she couldn\u2019t do that, so Shizuna spent an indescribable amount of time in agony.However, during that time, she suddenly recalled the expression Ryuichi had had on his face.\u2026Why did Ryuichi-kun look like that?It happened when she\u2019d hugged Ryuichi and he\u2019d hugged her back while rubbing her breasts and giving her another dose of happiness. He\u2019d clicked his tongue in annoyance as if he was remembering something. At the time, Shizuna had been worried that something about her was bothering him, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case, which was a huge relief to her.\u201c\u2026Oh, sorry. Can\u2019t be making that sort of face when I have such a beautiful girl in my arms.\u201dHe quickly apologized to her, but\u2026 Shizuna was frustrated that she was still not close enough for him to let her in his heart. Even as they were having sex with each other last night, she\u2019d suddenly seen a look in his eyes that completely wiped away the kindness she\u2019d felt from him; she suspected that the two were probably connected somehow.\u2026That\u2019s right. There\u2019s no need for me to panic. I\u2019m me, the one who will stand by Ryuichi\u2019s side as my own untainted color.A color that shone brightly and remained untainted no matter what. Those were the words Ryuichi had told her, which she\u2019d inscribed deep within her heart. After all, Ryuichi wasn\u2019t hiding his dark side, so she wished to be able to illuminate his darkness as well.\u201cAlright. Day duty, greetings please.\u201d\u201cUh-huh. Stand. Bow.\u201dThe person on day duty was curt and sounded unmotivated. The teacher didn\u2019t seem too pleased, but Shizuna let out a giggle. As was clear from their voice and character, the person on day duty today was none other than Ryuichi. Since class was over, Shizuna was planning on heading straight to where Ryuichi was, but one of her friends invited her to the restroom, so she decided to go with her.\u201cSay, Shizuna. What\u2019s up with you today?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHer friend\u2014Asakura Yuuhi\u2014was a tomboyish-looking girl. She was one of Shizuna\u2019s many friends; she was also her seatmate, and somebody who Shizuna frequently chatted with. She seemed to have some doubts about Shizuna\u2019s behavior today.\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing wrong with me, you know?\u201d\u201cBut my gut tells me you\u2019ve been thinking about Shishido all day.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dShocked, Shizuna stared at Yuuhi. Yuuhi could tell everything just from her reaction; she grinned and put her arm around Shizuna\u2019s shoulder. The two then began to walk together.\u201cBack then, even though it was my first time talking to him, I could tell he was different from what the rumors said of him\u2026 Yup, handsome, wild-types like him aren\u2019t too bad, huh?\u201d\u201cYes, yes! Ryuichi-kun is actually a very good person! \u2026Ah.\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t say.\u201dShizuna turned red in the face when she realized she\u2019d gotten over excited. Still, she very much wanted to let others know at least a little bit about Ryuichi, like now. Of course, she couldn\u2019t say that she didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit jealous at all, but she really wanted people to know that he was a good person.\u201cBut I was pretty surprised, y\u2019know? I always thought you had a crush on Shinozaki.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been with each other for a pretty long time, right? I thought that the time you\u2019ve spent with each other over the years as childhood friends would\u2019ve sparked something.\u201dIndeed, when Shizuna thought back to the past, she could recall having spent much of her life with Sohei. She was really good friends with him, and they got along with each others\u2019 families to a certain extent. However, Shizuna didn\u2019t think about him much these days. She thought about Ryuichi much more often.\u201cYes, me and Soehi-kun are close childhood friends, but\u2026 I don\u2019t see our relationship moving forward in that direction. I just can\u2019t see him as anything more than a childhood friend.\u201d\u201cI see. So you\u2019re more interested in Shishido than him.\u201d\u201cRight, right.\u201dWell, she\u2019d actually gone beyond \u201cbeing interested in him\u201d, but Yuuhi would probably be shocked if she\u2019d told her that. Shizuna had no intention of telling anyone about her night with Ryuichi, but she was worried somebody would find out if they saw her grinning constantly.Shizuna wrapped up her trip to the restroom and returned to the classroom, but as usual, her eyes naturally turned toward Ryuichi. Today, in addition to Makoto, there were two other people who were with Ryuichi. They were also classmates of Shizuna\u2019s and she had never heard good things about them, but now that she knew and was acquainted with Ryuichi, they were no longer something to fear for her.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dShizuna called out to him as usual.\u201cH-Holy crap, it\u2019s the princess!\u201d\u201cBeen seeing the both of ya together a lot these days.\u201dApparently, even these two found it unusual to see Shizuna with Ryuichi. One of the two tried to reach for her, but she stopped them from touching her body by slapping their hand.\u201cOof, how mean.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a friend of Ryuichi\u2019s or whatever; do not try to touch me as you please, understand?\u201d\u201cOh? Heh, well, I wouldn\u2019t want to make Ryuichi angry, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201dIt seemed he truly wasn\u2019t going to mess with Shizuna any more than that. Her gaze was very sharp, and she wasn\u2019t lying when she said not to touch her body. The only person she would touch or allow herself to be touched by was Ryuichi, save for her relatives and others of the same sex.\u201cWell, there you have it. If you don\u2019t want to piss me off, you better keep your hands off of her, got it?\u201d\u201c\u2018Kay~.\u201d\u201cYep, yep.\u201d\u201c\u2026Man, you\u2019ve seriously changed.\u201dShizuna was evidently delighted by Ryuichi\u2019s act of consideration for her. After the five of them chatted for a while, they each returned to their own seats. Shizuna felt Sohei\u2019s gaze on her, and their eyes even met each others\u2019\u2026but that was it. Just to be clear, it wasn\u2019t like Shizuna didn\u2019t care about Sohei or anything. She still considered him her important childhood friend; she\u2019d just found somebody new to replace his position.Time passed and it was now after school. Shizuna was, of course, by Ryuichi\u2019s side. She was staring at his back as he changed the water in the vase, just as he\u2019d done sometime in the past in place of somebody else. His large, muscular back and the way he gently tended to the flowers truly contrasted each other.\u201cAight, put the flowers in now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShizuna enjoyed her time alone with Ryuichi, muttering to herself about how wonderful it was that they were working on something together. They were at school, however, which meant that they couldn\u2019t do anything too careless, but even so, just spending time with him made her heart leap for joy.My heart\u2026has been completely stolen by Ryuichi-kun.Shizuna laughed, musing to herself that if this were a manga, she would have hearts in her eyes.Once they\u2019d finished their task, Shizuna followed Ryuichi along to his apartment. She\u2019d heard him muttering that he wanted to eat her meat and potato stew again, so there was no way Shizuna could just leave his wish ungranted.However, there was, in a certain sense, a new encounter waiting there for Shizuna. Chisa, the university student and also the person who\u2019d first caused the hazy feeling in Shizuna a while back, had also come to visit Ryuichi\u2019s home.\u201cRyuichi~? I\u2019m comin\u2019 in\u2026 Oh? It\u2019s pretty rare for you to have a girl over.\u201dShe didn\u2019t show any change in expression when she looked at Shizuna. It was as if she did not care what kind of relationship Ryuichi had with her.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I told you last time to tell me if you\u2019re coming over\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, sorry \u266a! Too late for that now, though, so you\u2019ll just have to let it slide.\u201dSeeing the two\u2019s intimate conversation made Shizuna\u2019s heart sting. She, too, leaned in to embrace Ryuichi\u2019s arm in an attempt to not lose out. Ryuichi smiled in exasperation while patting Shizuna on the head to reassure her. Seeing this, Chisa commented on how cute she was.\u201cNice to meet you. My name\u2019s Yomi Chisa. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201dAnd thus, this was how the two women met.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20They\u2019ve Gotten CloseTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cI see. So Ryuichi\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s been very kind to me\u2026and he\u2019s become all I can think about these days.\u201dShizuna and Chisa were talking amicably in front of Ryuichi. He was relieved to see that nothing awkward had transpired between them, but at the same time he also felt a little uncomfortable. The reason was that their conversation had been all about him for quite some time now.\u201cGirls\u2026could you not talk about something so embarrassing in front of the very person you\u2019re talking about?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a wet blanket.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201dHe gave a small click of his tongue, which only had the effect of making them laugh. Originally, Shizuna was the only one who was supposed to visit today, but as usual, Chisa decided to join in without calling ahead. At first, Shizuna had had a complicated look on her face, but as could be seen from the scene unfolding before Ryuichi now, the two quickly became friends.\u201cChisa-san, would you like to eat with us too? I actually came here today to make some meat and potato stew for Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cOh, really? I\u2019d love to try some homemade cooking from a younger girl!\u201d\u201cFufu, I\u2019ll get started then. Ryuichi-kun, I\u2019ll be borrowing your kitchen.\u201d\u201c\u2018Kay~.\u201dMeat and potato stew.\u00a0Ryuichi\u2019s stomach rumbled the moment he heard those words. It was a sign that Shizuna had completely captured his stomach. Chisa stared at Shizuna as she stood in the kitchen and began cooking.\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl. Too good for you, in fact.\u201d\u201cFor sure. I\u2019ve gotten my hands on a pretty good catch, if I do say so myself.\u201d\u201c\u2018Gotten your hands on a pretty good catch\u2019\u2026huh. You said the same thing about me too, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dNow that she\u2019d brought it up, Ryuichi remembered that he really did say that to her. When he had met Chisa at a party Makoto had invited him to, Ryuichi had asked her out at that moment. Their relationship continued to the present, and those were the words he\u2019d said to Chisa, who\u2019d become infatuated with Ryuichi.\u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it because I was fine with our relationship remaining purely as it was, but now I can tell you really care now. Not just for her, but for me as well.\u201d\u201cReally? Can\u2019t really tell myself, though.\u201dAs has been said before, Ryuichi had had a change of heart ever since he regained his memory. However, it wasn\u2019t to say that the way he\u2019d been until now has changed. He wasn\u2019t going to prioritize a certain partner he\u2019d had before, and had accepted his relationship with Shizuna and Chisa as it was.\u201cI think you\u2019re much better now, y\u2019know? Though I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have romantic feelings for you. I think you and the girl are a good match for each other, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIndeed, just as Chisa said, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t imagine being in a lover\u2019s relationship with her. Because of the length of time they\u2019d spent together in a \u2018sex friends\u2019 sort of relationship, he couldn\u2019t see a future in which they would progress to such a relationship now.\u201cI don\u2019t know about Shizuna, but I totally agree with you about our relationship. If I had to say, it feels like you\u2019re more of a troublesome sister to me.\u201d\u201cHey, who are you calling troublesome?\u201dThunk.\u00a0She hit him on his shoulder quite powerfully. Ryuichi\u2019s sturdy body didn\u2019t seem the least bit phased, however, and neither was it enough to anger Ryuichi. He reached his arm toward Chisa and embraced her body.\u201cAh\u2026 \u266a\u201d\u201cYou always quiet down when I hold you like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t help it, you know? My body\u2019s been conditioned to do this when it\u2019s in the embrace of these arms of yours.\u201dChisa buried her face in Ryuichi\u2019s chest. She had once said that any woman held in his arms like this would be captivated, and she herself had experienced this firsthand. When held in his thick, strong arms, Chisa immediately felt her body tingle with desire for Ryuichi.\u201cHey, Ryuichi. Can I stay the night here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s been your aim from the very start, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cOf course! \u266a\u201dAnd so, that was how Chisa\u2019s sleepover was decided. By the way, could the two have forgotten that Shizuna was still in the room with them? When Ryuichi felt her gaze on them, he turned to look at her. There, he saw Shizuna with her cheeks puffed out sulkily. It was as if she was saying that it was mean of them to exclude her from the group.\u201cGeez\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s seriously so cute.\u201dRyuichi left Chisa\u2019s side and made his way to where Shizuna was. She looked up at him with her cheeks still puffed out, but once he took her in his arms, Shizuna\u2019s face instantly lit up. She hugged Ryuichi like Chisa did earlier and let out a sweet sigh as if to say she was happy.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m such an easy-to-please girl, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026only for you, Ryuichi-kun. I\u2019m only an easy girl for you.\u201d\u201cHaha, I see.\u201dWell, in any case, Ryuichi felt good to have such clear displays of affection from a woman. Shizuna then suggested that he take a shower, and Ryuichi did as he was told, leaving the dishes to her.\u201c\u2026Geez, he knows just the thing I want him to do.\u201dShizuna let the words slip as she thought about Ryuichi, who was heading for the bath. She was easy. Too easy. But that was fine with her. Because Ryuichi would do for her what she wanted him to do, just as she had said. Ryuichi\u2019s existence was already too big for Shizuna, and she was crazy about him in the first place because she could look straight into his true nature.\u201cYou\u2019re so different from me, Shizuna-chan. You\u2019re genuinely in love with him.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think somebody genuinely in love would have sex with their crushes before even going out with them.\u201d\u201cTrue. But everybody is different, or are you saying you regret it, Shizuna-chan?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I have absolutely no regrets about doing it with Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cThen good. It doesn\u2019t matter what others around you think; your thoughts and feelings are the only things that matter, Shizuna-chan.\u201dShizuna unconsciously stared at Chisa\u2019s face. She wasn\u2019t particularly trying to judge her by her looks, but she couldn\u2019t help it. After all, Chisa was so flamboyant-looking, the likes of whom she\u2019d never seen at the high school she and Ryuichi went to, yet she was so kind.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re so kind, Chisa-san.\u201d\u201cI know, right~? Ah, but even I was a naughty girl in many ways before I met Ryuichi, y\u2019know? I think it was only after I met him that I became who I am today.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSuch was Chisa\u2019s story to Shizuna. She told him that when she met Ryuichi, she realized the darkness that lay within him. Of course, part of the reason she continued her relationship with Ryuichi was because she was in love with his body, but the most important reason was that she wanted to watch over Ryuichi, seeing as she was older than his younger self.\u201cHe\u2019s usually curt and blunt in many ways, but of course, there\u2019s a reason at the root of it all. Shizuna-chan, have you heard about Ryuichi\u2019s family?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I haven\u2019t heard the details. Just that they\u2019ve passed away.\u201dAll she\u2019d heard was that Ryuichi\u2019s parents had already passed away. From what she could see of Chisa, Shizuna knew she probably knew the deeper side of the story, but the fact also frustrated her a little.\u201cYou\u2019re so easy to understand, Shizuna-chan. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure\u2026you will be able to illuminate Ryuichi\u2019s darkness. He\u2019ll probably tell you everything one day, so make sure to tell him whatever you think needs to be said when that time comes, okay?\u201c\u2026Alright, I will.\u201d\u201cGood girl \u266a \u2026But I have to say, you really are one heck of a beauty, aren\u2019t you, Shizuna-chan?\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026so?\u201dThose around her often told her she was beautiful, and Ryuichi, too, had told her the same once. But whether she could consider herself above average than others in retrospect was another matter. Whenever she walked down the street, numerous men would look at her, and she would often get hit on, just as she had been that one time. Now that she thought about it, she was able to objectively consider her appearances above average.\u201cY\u2019know, I think you\u2019d rock a showy and flashy look, too.\u201d\u201cA showy look\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. Your pure and innocent look now is fine and all, but I think you\u2019d look even cuter if you tried to look a little gyaru-like. Makes for a nice gap, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dGyaru-like. The idea essentially meant looking more flamboyant and showy. Shizuna had never thought about that before. Although she did worry about her appearance, that only ever extended to her keeping her hair and skin as beautiful as possible.\u201cNext time, why don\u2019t we try putting you in some gyaru-like attire to surprise Ryuichi? Seeing you looking different from usual might get him excited, so\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cW-Wow, an instant response, huh\u2026 But sure. Let\u2019s do it!\u201dThus began the plan to turn Shizuna into a gyaru, albeit temporarily, leaving Ryuichi completely unawares. Although today was their first time meeting, they\u2019d gotten quite close to each other. Once Ryuichi finished his bath, it was Shizuna\u2019s turn to take hers. Then, finally, it was time to serve Shizuna\u2019s meat and potato stew.\u201cMan, this is just as tasty as I remembered it.\u201d\u201cThis is so good! You\u2019re amazing, Shizuna-chan!\u201d\u201cThank you. I made seconds for you, Ryuichi-kun, so make sure to eat it all up, okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me that again.\u201dRyuichi, who carried spoon after spoon to his mouth, abruptly stopped moving his hand, and just as Shizuna had done last time, she offered him a cup of tea. She and Chisa laughed at Ryuichi\u2019s childish side which hadn\u2019t changed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Closing The Distance a Little MoreTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cAight, I\u2019ll be walking Shizuna home now.\u201d\u201cOkay~. Bye bye, Shizuna-chan.\u201d\u201cYes, goodbye, Chisa-san.\u201dLeaving Chisa in the room, Ryuichi took Shizuna outside.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m jealous.\u201d\u201cOf her staying over?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to stay with you, too\u2026but we have school tomorrow.\u201dApparently, Shizuna was envious of Chisa who was staying over. Of course, she held back on account of the fact that they still had school tomorrow. As for Chisa, she had her university tomorrow too, but she had more time to work with since her lectures started later in the day than Ryuichi and Shizuna\u2019s.\u201cOh, yeah. What were you guys talking about while I was in the bath?\u201d\u201cAh, well\u2026\u201dShizuna told him what she and Chisa had talked about. She said that Chisa\u2019d told her she should attack Ryuichi with different versions of herself every once in a while to excite him, so she suggested that she try her hand at some gyaru-like fashion. Shizuna nodded her head eagerly, seemingly hoping that Ryuichi would be thrilled.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re fine just the way you are.\u201dJust as he\u2019d said previously, Ryuichi now preferred a more quiet and docile look rather than a flashy and flamboyant one. While he considered the flamboyant Shizuna seen in the manga attractive in its own way, he still thought that her current pure and innocent appearance suited her better.\u201cI\u2019ve already been dyed.\u201d\u201cThe Shizuna you knew no longer exists, Sohei-kun.\u201d\u201cFufu, my heart and body have been stolen by him.\u201dEven now he could still recall the lewd and obscene Shizuna\u2026and it wasn\u2019t bad at all. But that wasn\u2019t Shizuna. Well, it was Shizuna, but a Shizuna that was tainted with pleasure and the very embodiment of Ryuichi\u2019s desires.\u201cYou prefer me the way I am now, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t change into anything weird. You\u2019re totally likable as you are now.\u201d\u201c\u2026I-I see \u266a.\u201dShe smiled happily when he told her that he liked Shizuna just the way she was. She leaned toward Ryuichi and hugged his big, thick arms in her chest.\u201cBut if you\u2019re only planning on temporarily becoming a gyaru for fun and not for reals, then I\u2019m fine with it. Sounds like it\u2019d be pretty interesting to see you different from usual.\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u201dRyuichi nodded his head, thinking \u201cWell, if it\u2019s just a temporary change, it\u2019s fine.\u201d However, no matter what kind of change of mind she had, he didn\u2019t want her to change from the Shizuna she was now. That\u2019s why he vowed to watch her closely to make sure that nothing would change.\u2026Ugh, who the hell do I think I am? Watching her closely from now on? I sound as if I\u2019m her boyfriend or something, Ryuichi quietly laughed to himself. He\u2019d accepted Shizuna\u2019s liking for him, but unfortunately he hadn\u2019t developed romantic feelings for her yet. He knew that their current relationship was wrong in the eyes of society, but since Shizuna herself was the one who wanted it, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t be faulted for simply following her wishes.\u201cBy the way, Shizuna; do you know what gyarus are like?\u201d\u201c\u2026Totally~.\u201dThere were a fair number of gyarus, or showy girls if you will, in their class. So it seemed Shizuna was trying to become one of them, but apparently Shizuna\u2019s idea of gyarus was a bit dated.\u201cTotally\u2026\u201d\u201cTotally?\u201d\u201cTotally rad!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cD-Don\u2019t just stare at me!\u201dRyuichi was taken aback when he heard her use a phrase that had been trendy\u00a0twenty\u00a0years ago. Seeing Shizuna\u2019s face turn red before his eyes, his shoulders trembled as he let out a laugh.\u201cThat\u2019s definitely way too outdated, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s because hearing the term\u00a0gyaru\u00a0just didn\u2019t\u00a0click\u00a0in my mind. Ya get my\u00a0drift?\u201d\u201c\u2026Pfft.\u201d\u201cGeez!\u201dShizuna\u2019s cheeks puffed out as Ryuichi continued to laugh. She angrily growled,\u00a0Grrrr,\u00a0and went straight to bonking Ryuichi\u2019s chest over and over. It was a display of Shizuna\u2019s shame and anger, but it was just too cute a gesture.\u201cWell, just remember this. All I want to say is that you\u2019re fine just the way you are.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s words seemed to have convinced her. They then started walking together through the dark streets. They were a bit too dark for a young girl like her to travel through safely, but Shizuna wasn\u2019t scared at all, partly because Ryuichi was by her side. In fact, she was looking up at Ryuichi\u2019s face, seemingly wholly unconcerned about the possibility of even encountering a criminal.\u201c\u2026Hey, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a park here nearby. Could we stop by for a second?\u201d\u201cSure, I don\u2019t mind.\u201dHe nodded at Shizuna\u2019s words as he had no particular reason to refuse. He would be a little late in getting home, but he was sure Chisa wouldn\u2019t mind. Still, just in case, Ryuichi sent a message to Chisa informing her on his phone.\u201cHere we are.\u201dThe place Shizuna took him to was a relatively small place for a park. It only had swings and playground equipment in it, but of course there was no sign of anyone, so it was a very quiet place. Shizuna took Ryuichi by the hand and led them to the swings, where they both sat down together.\u201cSo? Why are we here?\u201dHe wondered if she just wanted to stay a little longer with him, but it seemed there was something else in addition to that. She seemed somewhat reluctant to open her mouth, which immediately clued Ryuichi in on the fact that it must\u2019ve been something difficult to ask him.\u201cYou can ask me anything. I\u2019ll answer your questions to a certain extent.\u201dIf Ryuichi was with any other woman, he wouldn\u2019t have gone this far. He said this because he was with Shizuna, and because they had become close enough to skip many steps in their relationship and jump straight into sex. Shizuna looked down for a moment, but then immediately locked eyes with Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026I heard from Chisa-san\u2026about your relationship with your family\u2026so, umm\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, so it\u2019s about that.\u201dIt seemed Shizuna wanted to know about Ryuichi\u2019s relationship with his family. He\u2019d already told her that his parents had died, but not how they\u2019d spent their lives together. For Ryuichi, it was something he didn\u2019t particularly want to be reminded of, but there was no point in fussing over it now since somebody else already knew about it, anyway.\u201cWell, mine\u2019s a bit more shitty than your average Joe. Still wanna hear it?\u201d\u201c\u2026I want to know more about you, Ryuichi-kun. No matter what it may be. Of course, if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cThat should be my line. I\u2019m asking if you really want to hear a story that\u2019s not really nice or enjoyable to hear.\u201dWhen he asked her that, Shizuna mumbled that she was okay. Ryuichi nodded and began to talk. He told her of his childhood when his father and mother did not love him, and after their deaths, his father\u2019s parents took him in but kept him away from them as if he were a tumor, which was why he lived alone now.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJust as Ryuichi had said, it was by no means an enjoyable story. Shizuna didn\u2019t seem to have regretted having heard it, but he could tell she was biting down on her lip, and quite painfully at that.\u201cHey, hey, why\u2019re you doing that\u2026 Well, I guess this is just another form of your kindness, huh. Don\u2019t make that kind of face for this bastard\u2019s sob stories.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not a bastard, Ryuichi-kun\u2026 You\u2019re definitely not a bastard!\u201dShizuna\u2019s voice was loud as she denied him, shouting that he wasn\u2019t a good-for-nothing bastard. Her voice echoed loudly in the quietness of the park. Shizuna\u2019s eyes were serious as she looked at Ryuichi, whose eyes were wide in shock, which made it clear that she was serious about him.\u201c\u2026You really are light itself. It feels like you\u2019d be able to illuminate anything, no matter how dark it is. You\u2019re one hell of a girl, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cI just\u2026 I just want to be able to illuminate you, Ryuichi-kun. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve illuminated me plenty enough. At least more than that dirty little street lamp over there that looks like it\u2019s going to break at any moment.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s gaze fell on a street lamp that was flickering, seemingly about to go out. Shizuna laughed at the simile, but quickly leaned in toward Ryuichi again.\u201cI\u2019ll say this again and again, Ryuichi-kun. I\u2019ll stay by your side for as long as I can. I want to be there for you, and I won\u2019t change my mind no matter what anyone says, because I\u2019ve made that decision of my own volition.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cYes! \u266a\u201dAlmost unconsciously, Ryuichi hugged Shizuna\u2019s body. Under the slightly chilly sky, the warmth of her body was comforting.\u00a0This makes yet another thing she\u2019s found out about me, Ryuichi thought as he looked up at the starry sky.\u201c\u2026But this isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI want to know more and more about you, Ryuichi-kun. So\u2026!\u201dShe backed away from Ryuichi and grinned and smiled as if she was scheming something. It was such a beautiful smile, but since he knew she was up to something, Ryuichi unfortunately couldn\u2019t admire it in full.\u201cI\u2019ll be getting involved with you much more from now on!\u201d\u201cS-Sure\u2026\u201d\u201cPrepare yourself\u2026okay?\u201dHer eyes seemed to show great determination and unbridled feelings for Ryuichi. Shizuna\u2019s vigor had initially caused Ryuichi to look dumbfounded as he replied, but then, grinning like Shizuna did earlier, Ryuichi uttered a suggestion.\u201cShizuna, got any plans for the weekend?\u201d\u201cNo, why\u2026?\u201d\u201cWanna go out somewhere?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely.\u201dHer decision had come quickly, almost too quickly, but still they smiled at each other. Thus their plans for the weekend were set.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Just Another Fashion StyleTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cI\u2019ll be getting involved with you much more from now on!\u201dRyuichi may or may not have underestimated the words that Shizuna\u2019d conveyed to him. Of course, he clearly grasped the strong desire and determination in her eyes, but he didn\u2019t know what form it would take.\u201c\u2026Wow, this is quite something.\u201dIt was the Friday before the weekend. They were currently on their lunch break, and before Ryuichi\u2019s eyes was a bento box that he would normally never bring. It was a two-tiered bento box commonly used by the average high school student, and the first things that greeted him were\u00a0karaage, egg rolls, a little frozen gratin, and vegetables.\u201c\u2026These look hella tasty.\u201dHe would be lying if he said he was drooling at the sight, but the bento nevertheless greatly whetted his appetite, especially seeing as it was late noon and Ryuichi was starving. In elementary and junior high school, there were school lunches available, but in high school, of course, there was no such thing. Although Ryuichi had often patroned the school cafeteria, this was his first time actually receiving a bento lunch that had been thoughtfully prepared for him.\u201cA-A bento box? Aha! Well, I won\u2019t ask who it\u2019s from, but I have to say, that looks\u00a0real\u00a0tasty.\u201d\u201cYou ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 any from me.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to glare at me, man\u2026 Haha, you\u2019ve really changed, huh, Ryuichi.\u201dRyuichi glared at Makoto, protecting his bento with both of his hands. Makoto then patted Ryuichi on the shoulder and walked away, iterating that he had no intention of taking any of the bento\u2019s dishes away from him and telling him to savor his meal.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me that,\u201d he retorted.In the meantime, Ryuichi\u2019s stomach rumbled. The two-tier lunchbox meant that there was another tier; when he opened that one as well, three or so rice balls appeared. Ryuichi wasn\u2019t sure what kind of ingredients were in them, or if they all had the same filling, but still he decided to put his hands together in thanks before digging in.\u201cThanks for the meal.\u201dChopsticks in hand, Ryuichi decided to start with the\u00a0karaage. Compared to freshly fried ones, its texture was softer and colder, but naturally, it was very delicious. Just one bite was enough to fill Ryuichi\u2019s mouth with its abundant flavors.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhile Ryuichi was enjoying his bento, he suddenly felt a gaze. It was Shizuna, and she was anxiously staring at him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so worried. These are damn amazing.\u201dAs a matter of fact, Shizuna was the one who\u2019d made Ryuichi his lunch box. She handed it to him when they met up before coming to school this morning. She said, \u201cI tried making a bento for you, so I want you to try it,\u201d to which Ryuichi nodded without a second thought. He knew firsthand just how delicious Shizuna\u2019s cooking was.Shizuna could clearly tell from Ryuichi\u2019s appearance that he was truly eating it with gusto. She let out a relieved chuckle and began to eat her bento with her friends as well. Aside from the fact that Ryuichi\u2019s was larger in quantity, their contents were naturally very similar\u2026 However, since the only person who\u2019d approached Ryuichi was Makoto, nobody noticed it.\u201c\u2026This is seriously good.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s honest thoughts spilled out. A little while ago, Ryuichi would\u2019ve simply accepted the favors that were given to him just like that. But now, it was different. Now that Ryuichi had gotten so much from Shizuna, he wanted to give something back to her. Obviously, he knew that she would tell him not to bother if he brought it up. Still, he wanted to repay her in some way.\u2026Well, I guess I\u2019ll prepare something for her without telling her.When it came to things that would please women, all the women Ryuichi had ever met seemed to like expensive things. Alas, things weren\u2019t so simple this time, since Shizuna was definitely not the type of girl to want those kinds of things.He had plans to go out with Shizuna tomorrow, so he decided he\u2019d get something for her then.\u201cThanks again for the meal. Man, that was a real feast.\u201dRyuichi had eaten up the bento that Shizuna\u2019d made for him cleanly. His stomach was so enthralled with her cooking that he honestly wished he could eat more of this lunch box, hopefully from now on. After some time had passed, school was out, and Ryuichi was on his way home with Shizuna naturally by his side.\u201cYour bento was seriously amazing. Thanks, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry; I was the one who wanted to make it. But still, it makes me very happy to hear that from you. \u266a\u201dShizuna was holding the empty lunch box with great care, and he could tell that she was truly happy to hear him say what he did. In fact, she looked so happy that even he couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cIf you\u2019d like, I could make another one for you.\u201d\u201cSeriously?!\u201dRyuichi immediately latched onto her suggestion with twinkles in his eye like a little child. However, he quickly came to his senses, cleared his throat, and looked away. If she saw him like that, of course she would see right through what he was wishing for.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll make another one for you as soon as next Monday.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201d\u201cFufu, no problem \u266a.\u201dShizuna hugged Ryuichi\u2019s arm. It seemed this had already become a habit of hers whenever they were alone; she would try to hug his arm whenever she could. As for Ryuichi, he didn\u2019t dislike it because he could feel a pleasantly soft sensation where she was hugging.\u201c\u2026Oh, that\u2019s right, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dShizuna then looked up at Ryuichi\u2019s face, seemingly having just thought of something.\u201cWe\u2019re going out tomorrow, right? I was thinking if you could take me to the places where you usually go to, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dRyuichi\u2019s mind filled up with the countless places he\u2019d been to. Most of them, however, were places minors didn\u2019t visit very often. They were places where sleazy young people like Ryuichi gathered, and weren\u2019t places where he could take a girl like Shizuna to.\u201cNo. You won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that childish, you know?\u201dThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about,\u00a0Ryuichi thought as he let out a sigh. Of course, there were some normal places, but there were also clubs like the one where he\u2019d met Chisa. If anything, he could say that almost all of them were the types of bars similar to the one where he\u2019d invited Sakie for a one-night stand.\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less if someone finds out I went there; after all, my reputation\u2019s already shit. But you\u2019re different. That\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOh, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about, then there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cRight? I told you\u2026wait, what?\u201dShizuna didn\u2019t elaborate on why she said there was no problem, and soon they parted ways for the day. They promised to meet up in the city at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, and the next day arrived with a slight sense of foreboding lingering in Ryuichi\u2019s heart.\u201c\u2026I see. So that\u2019s what you meant.\u201d\u201cFufu, what do you think?\u201dRyuichi immediately understood the words she\u2019d told him the previous day when he saw the Shizuna in front of him. She appeared a little different from her usual appearance; she was quite flamboyant, to put it simply. Although she did look like a gyaru, she only came off as a rather modest and subdued one purely due to her unconcealable innocence.\u201cAlthough I did talk about this with Chisa the other day, this is actually entirely the work of my mother.\u201d\u201cSakie did?!\u201dApparently, Shizuna\u2019s current appearance was manufactured by Sakie. She was wearing a blonde wig on her head and a black-hooded hoodie. Below that were a pair of hot pants, extremely short pants that exposed her beautiful legs. It was a look that\u2019d never been seen from Shizuna before, but he couldn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t suit her, likely because of her good looks.\u201cI\u2019m not changing my image just like you told me to. It\u2019s just me in another fashion style, and this way, no one will recognize me, right?\u201d\u201cWell, true.\u201dAt a quick glance, no one would be able to recognize this flamboyant woman as Shizuna. Especially if one knew what Shizuna looked like before, they\u2019d never be able to realize it was her since it was such a drastic change.\u201cAh, look, look.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dShizuna lined up next to him. She asked him to look at the glass pane of the store in front of them, where they could both see their reflection. Perhaps it was because they were both so flamboyantly dressed, but it was quite a strange feeling to see the two of them so well-matched.\u201c\u2026But seriously, I would\u2019ve never thought I\u2019d turn out this way, either. I guess I was right to leave it to Mom.\u201d\u201cSakie, huh\u2026\u201dMaybe Sakie had an experience like this in the past, too?\u00a0Ryuichi wondered, but it seemed it was bad manners to think about other women now. Laughing at Shizuna who pinched the back of his hand, Ryuichi decided to nevertheless make the most out of this day with her.\u201cAight, let\u2019s head out.\u201d\u201cYes \u266a.\u201dShizuna smiled and nodded. Seeing her in her unusual appearance reminded Ryuichi of the Shizuna he had seen in the manga. Although her appearance reminded him of Gyaru Shizuna, she had a much more restrained appearance than her other self depicted in the manga. Or rather, she looked pretty good.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just thinking that you look pretty good.\u201d\u201cFufu, thank you, Ryuichi-kun \u266a.\u201dRyuichi laughed at the beautiful smile she directed at him, thinking, \u201cI see. She really hasn\u2019t changed, huh. Just as she said.\u201d No matter how much she changed her appearance, Shizuna\u2019s radiance remained untainted. She clearly possessed a color that couldn\u2019t be dyed by any other color.\u201cBut I think I like the regular you much better.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026*blush*\u201dShe looked down at the ground, prompting Ryuichi to chuckle as he took her down the streets on their journey through the city.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23No Turning Back to the Way Things Were BeforeTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrRyuichi and Shizuna had met up in the morning, but their outing was essentially no different than any other. As for Ryuichi, the place he wanted to show her basically only operated at night, so until then, he had Shizuna lead them where she wanted to go, doing what she wanted to do.\u201cI think this one would suit you better, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWell, but this one\u2019s too good to simply pass up on\u2026 Hmm.\u201d\u201c\u2026Both of them look so cool on you. This is a tough one.\u201dShizuna was currently holding a jacket in her hand in front of Ryuichi, mulling over their conundrum. This is the first time he had actually gone out with her on a date like this. For Ryuichi, going out with a woman was nothing unusual, but going out with a girl who was also his classmate was a new experience.\u201cYou seem to be having fun.\u201d\u201cI\u00a0am\u00a0having fun. Because I\u2019m together with you, Ryuichi-kun \u266a.\u201dShe smiled as she held the two jackets in her hands. She was dressed differently than usual and appeared differently than usual, but her smile was still the same smile characteristic to Shizuna: a smile full of charm. If they were at home, Ryuichi would have hugged and kissed her right then and there before devouring her in no time.Well, I am going to be heading to her house later, so I guess I\u2019ll have some fun with her body then.He suddenly realized that he\u2019d been thinking very condescending thoughts.\u00a0\u201cHave some fun with her body?\u201d\u00a0Even if his way of thinking had changed, he was still, at his core, Ryuichi himself, and although he wasn\u2019t dejected by the fact, it did remind him that he wouldn\u2019t be able to change so easily.\u201c\u2026But I\u00a0will\u00a0be watching closely to make sure she doesn\u2019t get hurt, so I guess that\u2019s a start.\u201dAlthough they\u2019d ended up doing the deed together, Shizuna was sincerely satisfied with her relationship with Ryuichi, unlike the Shizuna in the manga. Well, the Shizuna in the manga\u00a0was\u00a0satisfied too, but their relationship now was much more wholesome than that one. Not to say that their relationship was a wholesome one in the first place, though.\u201cHey, Shizuna. What say you we have some fun tonight when we get to your house?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes! \u266a I\u2019ve been wanting to do it with you, too! \u266a\u201dShe smiled and nodded eagerly at Ryuichi\u2019s suggestion. In the first place, whenever she was alone with Ryuichi like this, she would always carry a sense of anticipation in her eyes. Sure, she was happy just to be alone with him, but seemingly hiding behind that happiness was a faint sense of expectation which Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but respond to.But is that really all it is?He definitely felt comfortable having Shizuna by his side. He had felt puzzled when he first regained his memories of this world, but now he\u2019d already accepted it. In the meantime, he\u2019d encountered Shizuna, the heroine, in an entirely different manner from the manga, and every passing day he spent with her, he came to know more and more faces of hers that he\u2019d never known.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cOops, my bad. Was just thinking about some stuff.\u201dRyuichi shook his head, thinking, \u201cThis is my time with Shizuna, so let\u2019s not think about anything else.\u201d He then grabbed the jacket that Shizuna had been mulling over and went to the checkout. Ryuichi, who was always delinquent-looking, and Shizuna, who was pretty but gyaru-like today, were attracting a lot of stares. The cashier didn\u2019t say much, as if they didn\u2019t want to get involved with them.\u201cWow, I really do attract attention looking like this, huh.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re hella pretty, after all. Even if you didn\u2019t look like that, you\u2019d still stand out anyways.\u201d\u201cI guess it\u2019s nice that people think I look good, but to be honest it doesn\u2019t really matter to me.\u201dShizuna embraced Ryuichi\u2019s arm.\u201cAll that matters is if you\u2019re looking at me, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Heh, what a wonderful woman you are.\u201dShe continued by saying that Ryuichi\u2019s opinion, too, was all that mattered to her before he and Shizuna started walking together. They spent the rest of the day strolling around town until the sun went down, and finally, the time came. Night had fallen, and the city\u2019s nightlife was beginning to liven up.\u201cIf we tried to go to all the places I go to, there\u2019d be no end to it. We\u2019ll just visit this one for today.\u201dRyuichi had brought Shizuna to a club he hadn\u2019t been to recently. Not long ago, he used to come by often, so the customers who used the club, as well as the manager, likely knew Ryuichi well. When they entered the club, they were greeted by loud, if not blaring, music.\u201cUgh\u2026 It\u2019s really noisy in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. We\u2019ll just hang around for a bit before heading out. I\u2019d much rather be banging you than staying here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dWith Shizuna tightly embracing Ryuichi\u2019s body, they quietly swept their eyes across the club in order to avoid standing out and bothering others.\u201cOh! If it isn\u2019t Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cTomikura, huh.\u201dThe man who spoke to Ryuichi with a creepy smirk on his face was an acquaintance of his, a white-collar worker by the name of Tomikura. He was a little chubby and always doled out his money at these sorts of places, and at one time he even had the hots for Chisa.\u201cDon\u2019t just walk up to me like that man. You fuckin\u2019 stink of booze.\u201dTomikura seemed unaffected even as Ryuichi made a shooing gesture with his hand. Soon, he caught sight of Shizuna, standing by Ryuichi\u2019s side. He reached his hand out toward her, but of course Ryuichi would never allow it.\u201cC\u2019mon, Ryuichi, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s unfair for you to hog all the pretty girls for yourself? Say, little missy, why don\u2019t you let me have a little taste of you, too\u2015\u201d\u201cI do not want to accompany a man like you. In fact, I\u2019d rather die than be with any man besides Ryuichi-kun.\u201dShizuna decisively cut him off. She\u2019d been so blunt that, for a moment, Tomikura couldn\u2019t process her words, but once he did, his face turned red and he glared at her. But of course, Ryuichi glared right back at him, and Tomikura, seemingly frightened by his gaze, made his retreat.\u201cWelp, that\u2019s just the kind of people that you get at places like these. Of course, not all of \u2018em are like that. Many of \u2018em come here to release their daily frustrations and stress at work.\u201d\u201cSo it seems. Apparently drinking alcohol and making loud noises helps them to relieve stress. Personally, though, I don\u2019t really see what\u2019s so good about doing those kinds of things.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t; in fact, you\u2019re best off not understanding it ever. I know I brought you here \u2018cos you told me you wanted to see what kinds of places I go to, but you shouldn\u2019t get tainted by all this glamor.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I couldn\u2019t care less about the hustle and bustle here; I\u2019d much rather be with you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dShe smiled at him, and Ryuichi laughed, too. Then, true to his words, they immediately left after a brief glance around the establishment. The outside of the store was naturally noisy with many voices, but it was still quieter than the inside of the store.\u201cFufu, I thought about visiting these kinds of places because I wanted to get to know you better, Ryuichi-kun, but now I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\u201cYup. Like I said, I really do prefer the time we spend together. I enjoy it ten times, or even a hundred times more than this.\u201dIt seemed she was saying that she much preferred making out with Ryuichi rather than wasting time like this. Even if she hadn\u2019t told him all that, it wouldn\u2019t change what they were about to do next. The thought that Ryuichi was about to go to her house and devour her greedily crossed his mind; he cuddled with her as if they were lovers, and just as they were about to head for her house\u2026\u201cShishido. And\u2026who\u2019re you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dWhen a voice called out to the two of them, they turned around. There stood, in a sense, unexpected people: it was Sohei and his friends. In other words, they were familiar faces to both Ryuichi and Shizuna. They were classmates, so it was only natural.No way. Are they here for the club too?\u00a0Ryuichi thought. However, he quickly came to the conclusion that he must\u2019ve been wrong. There was a karaoke place in the direction from which they\u2019d walked from, so it was likely they\u2019d spent their entire time singing there.\u201cWhoa, y\u2019all here for the club, too?\u201d\u201cTch\u2026 Don\u2019t lump us in with you. We just got back from karaoke.\u201dIt seemed his guess had been right. Ryuichi and Shizuna didn\u2019t really have anything to say to him, so they wanted Sohei to leave quickly, but he looked at the club for a moment before looking at Ryuichi and Shizuna again. Normally it would\u2019ve been a surprise for him to see Shizuna here, but it seemed he had yet to realize it was her.\u201cYou really are a delinquent, aren\u2019t you. Visiting inappropriate establishments like this and all. You, and all those people who crowd around you.\u201d\u201cH-Hey, Sohei.\u201d\u201cQuit it out, man\u2026\u201dSohei disregarded his friends\u2019 fear of what Ryuichi might do to them if they provoked him too much. He didn\u2019t care. He had a grudge for Ryuichi, who he perceived as an obstacle in the way of him and Shizuna.Ryuichi laughed at Sohei\u2019s attitude, but Sohei didn\u2019t seem to like that and tried to lash out even more, but Shizuna stepped out in front of him.\u201cW-What do you want\u2026?\u201dShizuna was about to say something, but her voice never left her mouth. Shizuna couldn\u2019t speak, because Ryuichi had put his hand on her shoulder and pulled her into his embrace.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cW-What are you doing\u2026?\u201dRyuichi placed one hand on Shizuna\u2019s cheek and the other on her breast. His fingers sank into her rich bulge that could be seen even through her hoodie, putting her voluptuous parts on display for all of them to see. Sohei and the others blushed in surprise at the sudden act\u2026while in contrast, Shizuna left her body wholly in the hands of Ryuichi, heartmarks in her eyes.\u201cWe done here? I\u2019ve got reservations for a steamy night with this gal. I\u2019d much rather get on with enjoying her body than deal with you guys.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dSohei and his friends quickly averted their eyes and started walking away. Ryuichi could see them as they left\u2014red up to their ears, showing a complete lack of tolerance for this sort of thing.Yo, protag, did you really not realize that this is Shizuna?Of course he hadn\u2019t noticed, which was why he hadn\u2019t paid much attention to her. The path had already diverged in so many ways and things could no longer return to how they were before; Ryuichi clearly sensed this, but it was too late for that.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get goin\u2019.\u201d\u201cAlright. L-Let\u2019s get home quickly. \u266a\u201dThus, even Shizuna didn\u2019t seem to care that they\u2019d run into Sohei. The whole time they walked to her house, she kept gazing at Ryuichi\u2019s face. It was as if she was implying that he was the only person she\u2019d been looking at the\u00a0entire\u00a0time.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24An Excessively Sweet NightTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was the night Ryuichi came to Shizuna\u2019s house after her date with him. After having dinner with Sakie, they went into her room and spent a time as sweet as honey together. Since this was her second time, her body was relaxed, and Ryuichi, now less reserved than their first time, ravished her body senseless.\u201cJust like I said last time, if you feel pain anywhere then tell me ASAP, okay?\u201dAlthough he was no longer reserved, Ryuichi\u2019s concern for Shizuna still remained the same. Basking in that kindness of his, Shizuna took in all the love that was being given to her. It was truly a blissful time\u2026so much so that she wished the moment could last forever.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dShe was currently gazing at Ryuichi as he slept. They\u2019d been sleeping together in her bed a while ago, but she abruptly awoke feeling thirsty. His face was still as stern as always, but he really looked cute when he slept like this, as befitted his age.\u201cThis is pretty nice too. Making love with the person you love, sleeping on the same bed with them\u2026and gazing at their sleeping face; they\u2019re all so wonderful, I can\u2019t find any other word to express it.\u201dShe could never hope to have a better relationship with him than this, yet deep down, she would very much love to become Ryuichi\u2019s one and only. Even if she couldn\u2019t have that special relationship with him, she could no longer think of leaving his side. That was just how large a presence he\u2019d become in her mind. It goes without saying that their relationship was still very much an impure one, though, so if she were to show past Shizuna the Shizuna of today, she would probably be surprised and even collapse in shock.\u201cOh, right. Water.\u201dRemembering that she was thirsty, Shizuna left the room and headed for the living room. On her way there, she found that the door to Sakie\u2019s room was slightly ajar and light was leaking out from the inside, so it seemed she was still basking in the\u00a0afterglow of what had just happened.\u201cFufu, as a daughter, I don\u2019t have any complicated feelings, strangely enough. After all, seeing my mom make such a blissful expression makes me happy too, regardless of the method.\u201dOf course, it was easy to imagine what her words were referring to. Sakie had been informed that Ryuichi would be staying over from the very start, but it seemed her memories with Ryuichi were an unforgettable moment for her as well. Previously, she\u2019d tried so hard to hold herself back, but this time Sakie was so conscious of Ryuichi that even Shizuna could see through her.\u201cIf Shizuna\u2019s fine with it, then sure, why not?\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t mind. Mom, isn\u2019t it lonely just standing there? Why don\u2019t you come in with us?\u201dStartled, Sakie made a loud\u00a0crash\u00a0noise outside the door. Although Shizuna felt bad for scaring her, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh in amusement. Well, in any case, the two had already agreed on it beforehand, and all three of them were satisfied in the end, so that was all that mattered to Shizuna.\u201c\u2026Haah, so refreshing. \u266a\u201dThe cold water passed down her throat and quenched her thirst. It then flowed through her esophagus to her stomach, taking with it the slight\u00a0stickiness\u00a0that was sticking to her throat. It saddened her a little, but more than that, she smiled in joy at the feeling of it going deeper into her body.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re so wonderful \u266a. Ryuichi-kun\u2026Ryuichi-kun\u2026 \u266a\u201dAs soon as her mind wandered slightly, she started muttering Ryuichi\u2019s name. She loved the way he protected her with his big back; she loved the way he pushed her down on the bed with his big body; she loved him for his caring side; she loved him for his rough side; she loved every single part of him.\u201cI really am a masochist, aren\u2019t I?\u201dRyuichi had pointed this out to her, and she realized the same while they were making out. No matter how embarrassing it was, she felt like she was fine exposing that side of her to him. She absolutely didn\u2019t want others finding out about it, but since Ryuichi was the one who brought it out of her, she was happy. Since it was Ryuichi who had awakened it, she could come to like that side of her, too, no matter how embarrassing it was.\u201c\u2026But it was definitely embarrassing to be seen by Mom.\u201dWell, no helping that, I guess.\u00a0Shizuna wryly chuckled to herself and returned to her room. When she slowly opened the door and went , she found Ryuichi still sound asleep. Ryuichi was known as a \u201cbad boy\u201d at school and had earned a reputation as a delinquent, yet here he was sleeping beautifully, very beautifully. He was quietly sleeping on his back without kicking off the blanket.\u201cI never would\u2019ve thought spending the night sleeping with someone would make me this happy.\u201dHer pillow was being used by Ryuichi, but she, in turn, was using his thick arm as a pillow. With her head on his arm, she turned her body toward him and discovered the happiness of sleeping surrounded by his powerful body and masculine scent.\u201c\u2026Haaah. \u266a\u201dShe let a sweet sigh spill out of her mouth, thinking that this moment was so fulfilling that she might get addicted to it. She was happy watching Ryuichi\u2019s sleeping face, but she was also happy to be sleeping by his side. Just as she was about to lose herself in that warmth, she saw her phone flickering.\u201cWhat could it be?\u201dShe picked up her phone and fiddled with it to find that she had gotten a message from Sohei. At that moment, she became understandably grumpy. As she recalled, she and Ryuichi had met him while they were out in town. Sohei hadn\u2019t noticed her in disguise, and she could not forgive him for trying to lash out at Ryuichi even though she was right beside him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen she looked at the message, she found that it was about Ryuichi. The message told her that he\u2019d come out of a shady establishment even though he was still a student, that he\u2019d been accompanied by a flamboyant, promiscuous-looking woman, and that Shizuna should also be careful because he said that he would be taking that girl to his bed.\u201cFufu\u2026 Ahahaha.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Sohei had probably meant his words out of concern for Shizuna, but nobody would ever want that, not to mention that\u00a0she\u00a0was the promiscuous-looking woman he was talking about in the first place. It was astounding how he was on such different wavelengths in their conversation, and although it didn\u2019t feel pleasant, she still found it amusing.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care anymore.\u201dEven she was surprised at how she no longer felt anything for him anymore. She hadn\u2019t liked the way he\u2019d spat words at Ryuichi when they\u2019d met on the street. She\u2019d even gotten slightly angry at him\u2026but the moment Ryuichi\u2019s arms wrapped around her body and rubbed her breasts, all Shizuna could think about was Ryuichi. Her anger and even embarrassment were washed away and all she could see was him.\u201cHow much do I love Ryuichi-kun? Say, Shizuna, how much do you love him?\u201dShizuna asked herself once again. Not only her feelings, but even her body was enthralled by him. But this love hadn\u2019t blinded her; Shizuna\u2019s will was properly shining through. She felt wonderful to be filled with so much love for Ryuichi, but the words he\u2019d said to her were still and would forever be etched into her mind.\u201cTo get close to Ryuichi-kun in a color unique only to me\u2026huh.\u201dTo be by Ryuichi\u2019s side with her own untainted color and radiance. This was Shizuna\u2019s desire\u2014her absolute wish that no one could intervene with from the outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWha?!\u201dShizuna was thinking about various things with her phone in hand, but a voice she hadn\u2019t expected to hear made her shoulders jump in shock. Ryuichi, who should have been asleep, had woken up and was staring at her.\u201cSorry, did I wake you?\u201d\u201cI felt cold without the warmth that was supposed to be right next to me\u2026 Just kidding.\u201d\u201cGeez, you could\u2019ve just said you missed me.\u201d\u201cMy bad, my bad.\u201d Ryuichi laughed. At that moment, she came to realize something else: Ryuichi smiled more the few moments before he went to sleep and after he woke up. His smile that exuded ferocity was Shizuna\u2019s favorite, but she also liked the way he smiled widely with his teeth showing like this\u2026or rather, she\u2019d come to like it.\u201cC\u2019mere. My arm\u2019s feelin\u2019 lonely.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dThere was no way Shizuna could resist when he said it like that; she immediately went up to the bed, wanting to be in his arms as soon as possible. She put her phone on the desk and made her way to Ryuichi, completely forgetting that she had seen Sohei\u2019s message.\u201cI can\u2019t get enough of this; it feels so good.\u201d\u201cHeh, you\u2019re so cute, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cUrk\u2026 Of course. That\u2019s because I\u2019m being loved by you, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dThat was the least she could do to resist the embarrassment she felt. Ryuichi\u2019s eyes widened for an instant, but he immediately grinned and hugged Shizuna even tighter. Her leaning on his body was part of it, but the two uppermost buttons of her pajamas were undone, revealing her ample bosom. Combined, they made her body look very indecent and sexy, but it seemed even Ryuichi wasn\u2019t going to touch her there now.\u201cYou looked like you were doing something with your phone in your hand. Did something come up?\u201d\u201cHuh? \u2026Oh, it\u2019s nothing important. Nothing to worry about at all.\u201d\u201cI see. Aight, then I\u2019ll be enjoying your body till we fall asleep, yeah?\u201d\u201cOh my, by all means, go ahead.\u201dShizuna was willing to do as much as he wanted of her. He buried his face in her neck and sniffed as if he was smelling her scent. Her voice leaked out at the ticklish sensation, and she squirmed and wriggled, but she continued to let him do as he pleased.\u201cHey, Ryuichi?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYou know, I truly feel happy right now. Thank you, Ryuichi-kun, for making love to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d say something like that.\u201dWhen she saw Ryuichi\u2019s face stunned in amazement, she giggled happily.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Fatal IgnoranceTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cYo, Ryuichi. Golden Week\u2019s comin\u2019 up soon, got any plans?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nope, nothin\u2019 I can think of.\u201dIt was nearing the end of April, and May was just around the corner. The new month brought with it the major annual holiday weekend, but Ryuichi had no plans at all. In previous years, he had spent his time with Makoto and his other friends picking up girls and hanging out at adult-only establishments, but this year, Makoto asked Ryuichi what he would do, and after giving it some thought, Ryuichi replied.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a while since I last went, maybe I\u2019ll come along.\u201d\u201cOh, so you\u2019re comin\u2019?\u201dHe thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to show up for the first time in a long time at a regular party to which he had been invited before but never ended up going.\u201cRight before the holidays, huh? Aight, I\u2019m down for it.\u201dThe one who\u2019d spoken was a boy standing next to Makoto, Kurosawa Kaname. He was the one who\u2019d tried to touch Shizuna the other day. Like Ryuichi and Makoto, he was a student treated as a delinquent, but he wasn\u2019t truly a bad person at heart.\u201cI\u2019mma try and keep my schedule open. Just so ya know, if I don\u2019t feel like it I\u2019m heading straight home, got it?\u201d\u201c\u2018Kay.\u201d\u201cYep, yep. But man, I\u2019m totally excited for this.\u201dKaname then said that he had to go to the bathroom and left the classroom. Ryuichi was left alone with Makoto, but since they were friends, their conversation progressed smoothly. Suddenly, Ryuichi felt a faint gaze on him, so he turned his head in that direction and sure enough, his eyes met Shizuna\u2019s. She seemed to have been talking with her friends, but right now they were all looking at Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dShizuna stared at him while her friends grinned at her, and when Ryuichi scratched his head and raised his hand in greeting, Shizuna made a wide grin, prompting her friends to playfully poke her shoulders.\u201cSay, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThat choker Rindo\u2019s wearing. Is that your doing?\u201dRyuichi nodded. The black item attached to Shizuna\u2019s neck was in fact a choker. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be quite the stylish item; it was adorned with a floral pattern, and just as Ryuichi had said, he had bought it for her.\u201cWell, that\u2019s because she told me she wanted it.\u201dOn his previous outing with Shizuna, Ryuichi had given her a moderately priced stuffed animal as a token of his appreciation for her bentos, among other things. He thought that would be the end of it, but at one of the stores they stopped by, she\u2019d come across a choker.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, uh\u2026I was just thinking about how nice this looked. It looks so similar to a collar, so wouldn\u2019t putting this on me make me look like I belong to you, Ryuichi-kun\u2026? Wait, what am I even saying?\u201dChokers, too, were technically a style of fashion, but there were certainly some who would say they looked similar to collars. She\u2019d looked surprised when he actually bought it for her, but soon she happily held it to her chest.\u201cHoly hell, though; I never would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d actually use it to school.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. Some people might suspect something, but they\u2019d probably conclude it\u2019s just a part of her outfit.\u201dA beautiful woman always looked good no matter what they wore. There may be some exceptions, but that choker was not one of them, as it definitely suited Shizuna well. Even now she was putting her fingers on the choker as if she was touching something important. She didn\u2019t seem to be conscious of it, so she must\u2019ve truly considered it important from the bottom of her heart.\u201cSo, what didja do to\u00a0him?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, all I can say is something definitely happened.\u201d\u201cNo shit, man. Haha, he looks like he really hates your guts.\u201dThe person Makoto was glancing at was Sohei. A few days had passed since then, and Sohei likely hadn\u2019t realized the woman in Ryuichi\u2019s arms was Shizuna. Shizuna didn\u2019t tell him anything either, so he was probably still unaware even now.\u201c\u2026Y\u2019know, getting a girl as good as her has its own downsides, huh. Feels like I\u2019ve developed a sort of superiority complex against those who\u2019re in love with her.\u201d\u201cNah, it\u2019s totally fine. In fact, you\u00a0should\u00a0be pumping your chest out in pride. It\u2019d be a different story if you were actually dating her and shit, but that\u2019s not true, isn\u2019t it? Then you have nothing to worry about, man.\u201d\u201cI\u2026see. Heh, you\u2019re being strangely nice to me today.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always nice to my bros, though?\u201dRyuichi laughed at the irony coming out of his mouth.However, even as he was talking with Makoto, Sohei was still glaring at Ryuichi as if he were glaring at his parents\u2019 mortal enemy. Ryuichi knew this, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he could straight up confront him about it, especially since he hadn\u2019t talked to him at all since then.\u201c\u2026Well, whatever.\u201d\u201cYeah, just leave it be.\u201dEventually, Sohei removed his gaze from Ryuichi. After school, Ryuichi met up with Shizuna to leave school.\u201cHey, Shizuna. Did you say something to him?\u201d\u201cHim? Oh, you mean Sohei-kun?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAfter Ryuichi nodded, Shizuna proceeded to explain everything to him. She seemed somewhat indifferent toward Sohei, but he could see a slight hint of anger in her eyes.\u201cHe ran his mouth and said whatever he pleased. He told me not to talk to you anymore, not to get involved with you anymore, and he told me that you\u2019re the kind of guy who goes to shady establishments and brings all kinds of promiscuous women to his home.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt seemed that Sohei was being quite blunt about Ryuichi to Shizuna behind his back. But it was only then that he got the full picture of why Sohei had been glaring so hard at him. In other words, Shizuna must have said something back.\u201cOf course, I tried to hold myself back at first\u2026but in the end, I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer; I told him that I hated him and that he shouldn\u2019t come to me ever again. I also told him not to talk to me anymore.\u201d\u201cPretty blunt of you, huh.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not the kind of person who\u2019s patient enough to stand hearing someone berating the person I like.\u201dShe said this while looking at Ryuichi with a serious look in her eyes.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t understand why she could say that so emphatically and seriously. He truly questioned how she could care so much for somebody else, just because she liked them.\u201cShizuna, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHer eyes pierced through Ryuichi. They were beautiful eyes, unblemished and pure, honest to a fault, and filled with light. Depending on how one looked at it, her body had already been tainted by the hands of Ryuichi. Even so, her figure was truly dazzling, never losing its radiance.\u201cYou\u2019re truly a wonderful woman, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, then it\u2019s all thanks to you, Ryuichi-kun. You\u2019re the one who changed me to become like this. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve become a woman who you can call wonderful. \u266a\u201dShe gave him a smile from the bottom of her heart. Ryuichi\u2019s heart jumped. He naturally reached out to touch her, seeing how honest she was and how much she cared for him. Once his hand reached her smooth, white cheeks, she rubbed them against Ryuichi\u2019s hand, as if seeking his touch. A chuckle slipped out of him at the sight of Shizuna, who looked as adorable as an animal.The two of them then walked down the road together in the setting sun. When they arrived at Shizuna\u2019s house, she took him by the hand, seemingly having noticed something.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOver here.\u201dShizuna pulled him over to the corner of the street, hiding them from view. As he wondered what was going on, she pointed her finger toward the house. There he saw Sohei talking with Sakie. He seemed to be desperately trying to convey something, as evident from his frantic body movements and gestures, and Sakie was just listening to him with her hand on her cheek, as if she couldn\u2019t care less about what he had to say\u2026 Shizuna let out a big sigh.\u201cHe\u2019s even talking to my mom now\u2026 Truly wasting his time,\u00a0that one.\u201dThat was the moment Shizuna finally switched from calling him \u201cSohei-kun\u201d to \u201cthat one.\u201d In Sohei\u2019s eyes, he was acting for the good of Shizuna, who was getting involved with bad people, which might\u2019ve been the right way for a childhood friend to act. He wasn\u2019t wrong; he certainly wasn\u2019t, but he had an overwhelming lack of understanding about everything.\u201cWhat a comical sight\u2026he doesn\u2019t even know that Mom and I are in love with you,\u201d she spat. In the first place, neither Shizuna nor Sakie had been forcibly attacked by Ryuichi. They willingly offered their bodies to Ryuichi and willingly nurtured feelings for him. Even though it may not be obvious to others, they definitely had proper feelings in them for him.\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s doing the right thing\u2026but he might actually just be self-conceited. That\u2019s why he wouldn\u2019t understand you even though you kept trying to tell him. I know I\u2019m the cause for that and all, but man, you\u2019ve got one hell of an annoying childhood friend, huh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not the cause, Ryuichi-kun; you\u2019re just a factor. I am the cause.\u201dShizuna\u2019s words were, in a sense, not entirely unfounded either. As he stared at Sohei, who was much too ignorant, Ryuichi thought about something. This world was the manga world that he knew, and the people who existed in it were no different. However, he wondered if he needed to be concerned about this world being a manga world after seeing all these characters existing with their own will.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTo be honest, he didn\u2019t really care about it anymore. He didn\u2019t know if it was just in Ryuichi\u2019s nature not to worry about details, but he truly didn\u2019t care anymore. To Ryuichi, as long as he was still alive, he would make sure to enjoy his life to the fullest.\u201cShizuna.\u201d\u201cAh. \u266a\u201dHe put his hand on Shizuna\u2019s shoulder as she stood next to him. In an instant, Shizuna\u2019s cold eyes toward Sohei disappeared completely, and she looked up at him.\u201cYou are my woman, and my woman alone.\u201d\u201cYou belong to me, and me alone.\u201dHis voice overlapped with a familiar voice elsewhere.\u201cYes! Of course. \u266a\u201d\u201cYes. Of course. \u266a\u201dAgain, Shizuna\u2019s reply, too, matched the one in Ryuichi\u2019s memories.\u00a0Something will probably change clearly in the near future.\u00a0Ryuichi had a clear premonition of this.HamletJr's notes:A few things to clear up for this chapter:Sorry for the long wall of text, and thank you for reading!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26First Club Visit in a Long TimeTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cMan, it\u2019s been so long since I last came to this place.\u201d\u201cI know, right? And it\u2019s totally packed in here, too.\u201d\u201cThere are tons of hot girls around. Wonder which of \u2018em I should bang with t\u2019night.\u201dAs he\u2019d originally planned, Ryuichi was visiting the club where men and women partied together for the first time in a while. Even though he had been away for quite some time, the atmosphere was just as noisy and boisterous as he remembered. He couldn\u2019t see other students like himself and his friends, but he was sure there were probably a few lurking around.\u201cYoohoo, Ryuichi~. \u266a\u201d\u201cChisa?\u201dHe came across another regular visitor of the club, Chisa. She naturally grabbed his hand and invited him to sit down. Makoto and Kaname walked into the crowd to look for girls of their own.\u201cWhat a surprise to see you here. I didn\u2019t expect you to come here after\u00a0that.\u201d\u201cHad some time on my hands, y\u2019know? Well, I\u2019m not gonna hang around for too long; gonna be heading home before it gets too late.\u201d\u201cYep, yep, good idea. You\u2019ll be putting Shizuna-chan at ease that way.\u201dHe was about to tell her that he didn\u2019t have that kind of relationship with Shizuna, but he ended up not saying anything because he knew Chisa would pick on him a lot for it. Right in the corner of his vision, he spotted a flamboyant-looking couple deep-kissing each other and exchanging words as they gazed at each other.\u201cSay, you sure you wanna do this when you have a boyfriend?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve forgotten all about him since coming here. \u266a\u201d\u201cHaha, if that\u2019s what you say. I guess that means I\u2019ll be your temporary boyfriend for now.\u201d\u201cSounds good to me~.\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t know about the man, but apparently the woman had come here even though she had a boyfriend. Of course, there were some people who came to this party just to fill their stomachs, but the majority of visitors were men and women here to do things like this.\u201cThe atmosphere here\u2019s the same as always, huh.\u201d\u201cA bit too late for that now, don\u2019t you think? Here, some soda.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dOf course, it went without saying that he wouldn\u2019t drink alcohol. As he was quenching his thirst with the glass of soda, he caught sight of a curious scene at a seat a short distance away from them.\u201c\u2026Look at that.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dShe turned her eyes to where he was looking as well. There, two people were sitting on a sofa, a man and a woman; however, something seemed to be wrong with the woman. Unlike the man who was proactively making moves on her, the woman seemed to be feeling uncomfortable about being here.\u201cDo you think she was forced to come here by a friend?\u201d\u201cAh~, yeah, that definitely sounds possible. She looks like a meek, docile girl, so I\u2019d say she probably couldn\u2019t turn them down.\u201dHer hair was long enough to cover her eyes, but when she abruptly looked up in fear, he could see that she was good-looking, with a face that was well-defined. Plus, she had a conspicuously well-shaped figure attractive enough to make a man set their sights on her. The way she was trembling timidly reminded him of a small animal, but\u2026seeing her thrown into a place like this made her look all but pitiful.\u201cI\u2019m gonna bring her here. You help calm her down.\u201d\u201cRoger that~.\u201dIf this were the old Ryuichi, he would\u2019ve never thought to help her like this. Just like when he saved Shizuna, Ryuichi got up and moved to help her. As he approached them, the man looked up at Ryuichi and trembled in fear. It wasn\u2019t so bad once one got used to it, but it seemed that anyone would be scared of Ryuichi\u2019s glaring face.\u201cLooks like the girl doesn\u2019t want your company, eh?\u201d\u201cT-The fuck you say?!\u201d\u201cDo you seriously not see that? If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not qualified to hit on women. You need to learn a little more before you come here.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026 You fucking brat.\u201d\u201cOkey-dokey~!\u201dJust as the man stood up, he could\u2019ve sworn he heard Kaname\u2019s voice as a drink rained down on the man\u2019s head. Using this opportunity, Ryuichi took the woman\u2019s hand and stood her up. He thanked Kaname with his eyes and then went straight back to Chisa, pulling the woman along with him by her hand.\u201cNice one.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cU-Umm\u2026\u201dThe woman seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with the sudden turn of events. He decided to leave the rest to Chisa and slurped down the rest of his soda. Meanwhile, he learnt that the woman was a first-year college student named Shirasagi Satsuki. Just as he\u2019d suspected, she\u2019d been forced to come here by her flamboyant friend.\u201cI know it might be hard for you to speak up, but you have to firmly say no whenever you don\u2019t want or like something. Otherwise, that man would have forced you into having sex with him, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cI\u2026know. I was so scared I couldn\u2019t say anything\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. You really saved me back there.\u201dSatsuki bowed her head.\u201cA docile-looking woman like you makes an easy target for men. You\u2019re quite the looker, and your body\u2019s got curves, so if you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll get devoured one of these days, got it?\u201d\u201cErm\u2026okay.\u201dUnlike when she was talking to Chisa, her body trembled at Ryuichi\u2019s words. He wondered to himself if she was that scared of the thought, but Chisa, standing next to him, was clutching her stomach and laughing.\u201cShe\u2019s scared of your\u00a0face,\u00a0duh. She\u2019d never guess you\u2019re in high school with looks like that.\u201d\u201cHuh?! He\u2019s a high school student?!\u201d\u201cYup. He\u2019s a bad, naughty boy!\u201d\u201cOh, shut up!\u201dEven he was aware that he was a bad and unruly kid. However, it seemed that once Satsuki heard that he was a high school student, she became a little less scared of him, and her nervousness dissipated. He didn\u2019t know what she was thinking as she stared at him, but it made him feel a little uncomfortable.\u201cErm\u2026don\u2019t you get bullied at school with those looks of yours?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026are\u00a0so\u00a0rude, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cThink of it this way instead:\u00a0who\u00a0would be brave enough to bully him with looks like those?\u201dEven Chisa was casually dissing him. Just as he was about to ask for a refill for his now empty glass of soda, Chisa excused herself to go to the restroom. This left him alone with Satsuki, but he didn\u2019t have anything to talk about with her.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dSatsuki gazed at the aforementioned couple still deep-kissing each other so intensely that they looked as if they were about to start doing the deed any moment beside her, and she put her hand on her cheek and gazed at them shyly. Her reaction showed that she was surprisingly more interested in those things than he had expected, but well, it seemed that was how it was for everyone.\u201cWhere\u2019s your friend?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026err, they went to the back of the club.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLooks like her friend was already getting on with it. He wanted to tell her to consider socializing with others, but it would probably be difficult for her to connect with the people here. Her timidness and frailty of heart meant that she might get pushed around by others and even become a target of sorts.\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to go through something like that ever again, you have to have the courage to say\u00a0no\u00a0when you don\u2019t want to do something. There won\u2019t always be somebody to save you like I did today. The moment you step through those doors, you\u2019re basically telling everybody that you\u2019re here to do\u00a0those\u00a0things. I\u2019m telling you, no matter what the details or particulars are, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re an outlier here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe drooped her head low. He wondered if he\u2019d maybe been too harsh on her, but he decided that it was necessary for her own good. He then pressed a can of ice-cold juice against her cheek.\u201cKyah?!\u201d\u201cHeh, go ahead and drink it.\u201dHe handed the can over to her surprised self. Amazed, she took the can of juice and stared back at him with a slight flush on her cheeks.\u201cYou\u2019re kind\u2026aren\u2019t you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHell no. Hanging out at places like these makes me a bad boy.\u201d\u201cFufu, right.\u201dClink.\u00a0She popped open the can\u2019s lid.\u201c\u2026Ah, this tastes wonderful. It tastes better than any drink I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\u201cNo shot. But yeah, that orange juice definitely does pack a punch.\u201dBy now, both of them had become reasonably comfortable with each other. Chisa\u2019s return meant that the three of them could now kill some time together, and thanks to Ryuichi and Chisa, Satsuki was getting used to the club\u2019s atmosphere.\u201cI think I\u2019m getting used to this place a little more now\u2026and it\u2019s all thanks to the two of you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. But if you don\u2019t want to go through something like that anymore, then don\u2019t come back ever again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dShe glanced at Ryuichi.\u201cIf I come back, will I be able to see you, Ryuichi-kun\u2026?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cOh my~.\u201dPutting aside for the moment Chisa\u2019s irritating smile, seemingly out of pure amusement at the situation, Ryuichi explained to her that he had only come today because he was in the mood for it. He used to come by often before, but now, although he didn\u2019t find it too much trouble, he was no longer that keen on coming to this club.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring Shizuna along with you too next time?\u201d\u201cAre you being serious?\u201dChisa chuckled and told him it was a joke.\u201cWell, I come by your house pretty often, so it might be nice to get together for drinks at your place sometime.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just decide that on your own\u2026\u201dIn the end, Ryuichi left the club shortly thereafter. Satsuki was in safe hands since Chisa was walking her home. He didn\u2019t feel the need to call out to Makoto and Kaname to say goodbye, as they seemed to be with their partners with whom they had spent the day.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dSoon after he left the club, his smartphone vibrated. When he looked to see who it was, he found that it was a message from his paternal grandparent, i.e., his grandfather. The message said that he had transferred all the money for his living expenses next month. As usual, they didn\u2019t even want to hear his voice, which made him laugh.\u201cAight, time to head home.\u201dHe\u2019d had a good time today, having reminisced on old times for a bit before the long holiday weekend began. On his way home, he received a call from Shizuna, who amiably asked him how his club visit had gone, and when he asked if she was really that curious, she immediately said yes without hiding anything.\u201cOf course I want to know\u2026or do you not want to answer?\u201d\u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I meant. Anyways, I\u2019m actually on my way home right now.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like she was waiting for him at his home, yet they were conversing as if they were lovers. The call ended shortly after, but suddenly Ryuichi stopped in his tracks.\u201cSatsuki, huh\u2026 Is it just me, or does her name sound familiar?\u201dHe felt like he\u2019d heard it somewhere before, but he couldn\u2019t remember where or when exactly, so he decided not to worry about it too much.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27An Extremely Simple ConclusionTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cHey, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dIt was after school, the day right before the long holiday weekend in May. It was already dark, and night had fallen. Ryuichi and Shizuna, both students, were on their way home from having dinner at the bar they had previously visited together. They were both still in their uniform because they had gone out for some shopping prior.\u201cDo you have any plans for the holidays?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Nope, not really.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t made any commitments to anyone as of yet. He had been invited by Makoto and Kaname for various woman-related activities during the holidays, but he turned them down. They were probably going to go to mixers and such, but the current Ryuichi didn\u2019t crave a woman\u2019s company that badly.Well no, he actually\u00a0did\u00a0have the desire to hold a woman. After all, it was always in a man\u2019s instinct to want to spend time with a beautiful woman.\u201cShizuna.\u201d\u201cKya?!\u201dPlacing his hand on her shoulder, he embraced her somewhat tightly. She squealed in surprise, but the moment he embraced her as such, her eyes became noticeably expressive of her fondness for him, and they began to glint in eager anticipation. It was a sign of her infatuation with Ryuichi, and she could not hide her desire to devote herself to him.\u201cWhy would I need plans when I have you this year around? So what do you say? Do you wanna spend the holiday with me?\u201d\u201cGeez, do you really have to ask questions you already know the answer to?\u201dShe let out a giggle at his obvious question. Her eyes were moist and her cheeks were flushed; every inch of her body was filled to the brim with anticipation for Ryuichi. With her in his embrace, he brought his face up to her neck and sniffed her scent as he continued.\u201cI want to hear it straight from your mouth.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 I want to be with you. I want to stay by your side and never let go. I want you to hold me tightly in your embrace with your arms.\u201dShe buried her face in his chest, telling him that that was all she could ever ask for. The way she was now, she was completely in love with him, and there was no doubt that she was so obedient she would listen to anything he asked of her. However, the fondness she had for him was undoubtedly a precious feeling that she herself had developed. Of course, Ryuichi had some part to play in this, but it was her own heart that amplified her feelings for him such that they had become as great as they are today.\u201cY\u2019know, I\u2019ve never seen you take off that choker before; do you really like it that much?\u201dShe nodded in response, tracing the tip of her finger on the choker attached to her neck. Not much time had passed since he had given it to her, but still, she basically never took it off. He could even see her occasionally stroking it with her fingers with a delighted expression on her face.\u201cYes, very. Of course, I do take it off when I take my baths, but\u2026 fufu. I always want to think of myself as being yours, Ryuichi-kun. I always want to be conscious of the fact that I am a woman who is devoted to you, a woman who you\u2019ll think is special.\u201dNobody would\u2019ve ever expected those kinds of words from a beautiful girl like Shizuna. She\u2019d said that she wanted to feel like she belonged to Ryuichi, that she wanted to be special to him. This stimulated Ryuichi\u2019s possessive side, instinctively making him see the woman in front of him as a special luxury only for him.\u201cShizuna.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dHe put his hand on her chin and raised her face. Her eyes closed, he placed his lips on hers and slipped his tongue in, violating all the way to the recesses of her mouth. With Shizuna\u2019s muffled voice fuelling him further, their kiss became more intense as Ryuichi began to desire her even more heatedly.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun. I want to spend the rest of the night with you.\u201dTheir faces parted, and silver threads formed between their lips. Ryuichi had held many women before in his life, but he could keenly feel that Shizuna carried a charm that was truly incomparable.He held her shoulders, deciding to head to his home since it was closer than hers.\u201cLet\u2019s go to my place.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dHer response was immediate, and her voice sounded very excited. Seeing her blatantly obvious reaction made him laugh. Just as the two of them snuggled against each other, about to make their way to his apartment, fate played a trick on them and another person\u2019s voice rang out.\u201cWhat\u2026are you doing?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe voice was one that was familiar to both Ryuichi and Shizuna. They didn\u2019t even have to turn around to realize it belonged to Sohei, and Ryuichi chuckled when he saw the anger on Shizuna\u2019s face the moment she heard his voice.Ryuichi turned around to face him, but Shizuna did not follow suit, seemingly not wanting to see his face. Once he turned around, he saw Sohei looking stunned, as if he couldn\u2019t believe what his eyes were seeing. He then casually spoke to him as usual.\u201cYou out on a stroll this late at night? Or are ya on your way home?\u201d\u201cShut up! Who cares what I\u2019m doing?! I\u2019m asking what\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0doing!\u201dIt seemed Sohei was anything but calm\u2026well, of course he would be, but still, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but shrug his shoulders in exasperation at how noisy he was being this late at night.\u201cI just got back from my dinner with Shizuna. Right now\u2026\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to take her to my apartment,\u00a0Ryuichi was about to say before he stopped himself. In truth, he didn\u2019t think anything of Sohei. He no longer cared about the fact that he was the protagonist; he didn\u2019t care that Shizuna was the heroine; and he didn\u2019t care that he was the one who stole her away from him. However, if he did tell him those words, it would likely change his relationship with Shizuna\u2026 No, forget changing their relationship, his words might even end it.\u201cRyuichi-kun. I\u2019ve already decided to be by your side. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright. I won\u2019t hold back then.\u201dIf that was what she said, then Ryuichi had nothing more to hide.\u201cI\u2019m going to take her to my apartment.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThis girl is my woman. If she says she doesn\u2019t want to go home and wants to stay with me, then isn\u2019t it my duty as a man to do exactly that?\u201dHe had his arms around her shoulders as he spoke. In his mind, he felt like an absolute villain, but in a sense, this too could be said to be just another outcome of love. It was a simple conclusion where Ryuichi won Shizuna over by a string of coincidences, as opposed to Sohei who never took any action of his own.\u201cThat\u2019s how it is, Sohei-kun. Come on, Ryuichi-kun; let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cRight behind you.\u201dShe, too, had nothing left to say to him, and as if to say this, she took Ryuichi\u2019s arm, back turned to Sohei. Ryuichi also turned his back on him and started to walk away, but Sohei rushed to their side for whatever reason.\u201cWhat the hell?! This isn\u2019t you, Shizuna! How could you have changed so much without me knowing\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy must you know everything about me?\u201d\u201cTch\u2026 You! I bet you did something to her! You must be threatening her!\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I guess that\u2019s how it\u2019d look like to you.\u201dRyuichi scratched his head in understanding. Sohei had no knowledge of the incident that had brought Ryuichi and Shizuna together in the first place. He didn\u2019t know of their interactions after that, and he definitely didn\u2019t know that they\u2019d had sexual relations with each other. In other words, from his point of view, it seemed as if his precious childhood friend had somehow been seduced by Ryuichi, who was a well-known delinquent, behind his back.\u201cWell, I guess it does look like I seduced you. Plus, it isn\u2019t entirely wrong, either, so I can\u2019t really deny it.\u201d\u201cFufu, true. But I really do love you from the bottom of my heart, Ryuichi-kun. No matter what anybody else says, that will never change. I won\u2019t deny it, and more importantly\u2014\u201d\u201cUrk\u2026\u201dShizuna shot Sohei a strong look. He took a step back, perhaps because he had never seen that expression from her before. She looked straight at him and said:\u201cI won\u2019t let anyone else deny it. These feelings\u2026these feelings of love that I hold for Ryuichi-kun; I will never let anybody deny them.\u201dShizuna\u2019s voice was crystal clear. Sohei was naturally shocked, but on the other hand, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but think that he was truly a scumbag. Even though she was expressing her feelings for him in such a straightforward manner, he still could not tell if the feelings he held for her was love. He wanted to monopolize her; he wanted to make her his; yet despite all that, he couldn\u2019t actually tell if he\u00a0loved\u00a0her.\u201cI wish you were never born.\u201dWhat\u2019s the use of believing in love; all women are just like that filthy mother of yours\u2026,\u00a0whispered Ryuichi\u2019s own voice from deep inside. Of course, Shizuna was not like that. He understood that she was so beautiful, so straightforward, and so wonderful a woman.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Shizuna; he had no doubt that Chisa and Sakie were also people that he could lay himself bare to. Still, he couldn\u2019t find it in him to take that one step forward.\u201c\u2026Damn it.\u201dHe forcibly convinced himself that worrying about these things wasn\u2019t like him, and that he should just continue treating her as he had until now. With that, he hugged Shizuna from behind right in front of Sohei.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cHey, you better\u2014\u201d\u2026back off from her.\u00a0Sohei was unable to say those last few words.\u201cHnng\u2026 \u266a\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, Shizuna, that\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s get home quickly so we can get to having some more fun\u00a0again\u00a0tonight.\u201dHe whispered in her ear while simultaneously sinking his fingers into her ample breasts. She didn\u2019t reject him in the slightest; in fact, she even looked as if she wanted him to go harder on her. But more importantly, this scene was an exact reenactment of the events that had occurred after they\u2019d exited the club that day.\u201cN-No way\u2026\u201d\u201cYep. The woman who was beside me that time was Shizuna. The woman whom you called promiscuous was actually her.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shizuna?\u201dShe nodded at Sohei\u2019s question. Sohei did not say anything after that, and Ryuichi, seeing that their conversation had come to an end, took Shizuna and started to walk away. After walking for some time, he muttered something to her.\u201cA lot of things are probably going to change now. I mean, he was in love with you, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cYes, he did\u2026but it can\u2019t be helped. I care about you more than I do for him now. There\u2019s no point in worrying about it.\u201dThat marked the last time she brought up Sohei\u2019s name. She must\u2019ve had some thoughts on the matter, Ryuichi was sure of it. Still, she followed her feelings and chose to stay by his side.It was a simple conclusion: she just chose the person for whom she held stronger feelings\u2014that was all.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28The Color That Continues to Illuminate Him by His SideTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cAh, this feels so good. \u266a\u201dShizuna was in the shower, leisurely muttering to herself.As soon as they\u2019d arrived at Ryuichi\u2019s apartment, he immediately began deep-kissing her the moment the front door shut closed. After that, he took her to the futon by way of a princess carry.\u201cOh my, I feel like a princess right now. \u266a\u201d\u201cAnd in a few more minutes, that princess is going to be defiled.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not defiling. That\u2019s just me getting the proof of my love carved onto my body. \u266a\u201dEven she found her words embarrassing in retrospect, but she couldn\u2019t help it; that was just how happy being carried princess-style by him had made her.\u201cWhy did I feel so good? Is it because Ryuichi-kun is so good at it? Or am I just that sensitive?\u201dHer mind suddenly drifted to this thought.She had had no experience with it whatsoever until recently, and although she technically knew about it, she had no idea how it was actually done. The way they did it was that Ryuichi would take the lead in arousing Shizuna with foreplay, then she would tell him what she wanted him to do, and he in turn would do it for her. Once they were in the act, seeing Ryuichi\u2019s happy face made Shizuna happy and aroused, too, and the rest of the time she was just following her instincts and moving her body as she saw fit.\u201c\u2026Hnng.\u201dJust recalling the events made her aroused again. He\u2019d greedily devoured her body to his heart\u2019s content, and Shizuna, too, had felt more than satisfied. However, the sweeter the time was, the more selfishly she wanted to taste more. She felt ashamed at how naughty and lewd she was, but when she thought about how Ryuichi was the one who\u2019d made her this way, she felt happy.\u201cAlright, this should be good enough.\u201dAfter washing her entire body thoroughly, including her hair, she came out of the bathroom. Since she\u2019d come here without returning home first, she didn\u2019t have a change of clothes with her, but since she\u2019d managed to borrow Ryuichi\u2019s clothes, she decided she\u2019d use those for the rest of her stay.\u201c\u2026Ehehe\u2026ehehehe. \u266a\u201dShe put on the shirt she\u2019d borrowed from him and sniffed it with all her might. It smelled like detergent, but she couldn\u2019t help but notice a slight hint of Ryuichi\u2019s scent mixed in.\u201cOh, you\u2019re back.\u201d\u201cYup. I had a great time in there.\u201dRyuichi had let Shizuna use the bathroom first, so he wasn\u2019t currently wearing anything. The mere sight of his strong body, which reminded her of a large, bulky man, was enough to make her heave a heated sigh. When Shizuna had left the bathroom, she\u2019d only had Ryuichi\u2019s shirt on her, but her two uppermost buttons were undone, leaving her voluptuous breasts in plain sight; also, since she wasn\u2019t wearing anything from her thighs down, they too were completely exposed.\u201cYou\u2019re totally dressed like a naughty girl.\u201d\u201cReally? But this is just me wearing your shirt, you know?\u201d\u201cStill, I think you look hella sexy. I ain\u2019t complaining, though; I totally dig it.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear,\u201d she said as she sat down. Seemingly switching places with her, it was now Ryuichi\u2019s turn to head for the bath, which left Shizuna all by herself. She didn\u2019t really know what to do, so she just picked up her phone.\u201c\u2026No messages, huh.\u201dShe thought Sohei would\u2019ve tried to text her or give her a call, but there was nothing.\u201c\u2026He was in love with me\u2026huh.\u201dNow that Shizuna thought about it, she could indeed see that Sohei had had faint feelings for her. That in itself wasn\u2019t a problem to her, but when she saw him lash out at Ryuichi like that, her opinion of him fell rock bottom. Though, even if he hadn\u2019t behaved the way he did, Shizuna\u2019s heart had already been taken captive by Ryuichi, so nothing would have changed in the long run.\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2026 I love you\u2026 I love you so much\u2026 I love you from the bottom of my heart.\u201dJust muttering those words made her heart warm and happy. She could no longer think of anything but Ryuichi, so much so that even she was amazed at herself at how great her love was for him. She\u2019d been playing around with her phone to kill some time, but before she knew it, she found herself playing with herself using her fingers while remembering the events that had taken place earlier.\u201cMan, just when I thought I heard a sexy voice from somebody, it turned out to be you, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t help it, okay?! Having sex with you just makes me too happy!\u201dShe\u2019d taken a double blow; she felt embarrassment from having let her mind wander, and embarrassment at having been seen like that by Ryuichi. He chuckled when he saw her quickly cover her face with the quilt and made his way to her side. He sat down with a\u00a0thud, and held her in his large arms.\u201c\u2018Course we ain\u2019t gonna do it anymore today, but seriously, you really are a cute girl. Not just that, you\u2019re also so lewd\u2026and so strong. There aren\u2019t many girls as wonderful as you out there.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201dRyuichi was indeed a delinquent. But his words for her were always gentle. There were times when he greedily devoured Shizuna, putting on display his ferocious side. But still, he was a very kind person. It was because Shizuna knew that kindness of his that she felt safe in his arms.\u201cAlso, I\u2019ll be sending you home tomorrow, okay?\u201d\u201cAll right. But just for now, it\u2019s just me and you\u2026that means I have you all to myself. \u266a\u201d\u201cSame goes for me too. Just for now\u2026no, you\u2019ll\u00a0forever\u00a0be my woman and my woman alone, got it, Shizuna?\u201dShe nodded at his words with a big smile on her face. She chatted with him a little more, all the while letting him do as he pleased. She accepted his arms that held her body, and his fingers that fondled her breasts\u2026and eventually, they turned off the lights and went to bed.Wrapped in Ryuichi\u2019s warmth and smell, Shizuna slept with a sense of happiness that could not be greater. Then, she had a strange dream.\u201c\u2026Where am I?\u201dShe was in a house she\u2019d never seen before. While she was looking over the place that she had no recollection of whatsoever, she heard a woman\u2019s voice.\u201cI wish you were never born.\u201d\u201c?\u201dIt was a voice filled with malice. Shizuna instinctively felt disgust toward the voice, but she walked towards its source nonetheless. When she arrived at one of the rooms, she saw a woman and a young boy.\u201cI honestly have no idea why taking care of a little brat like you is such a pain in the ass. It costs so much money and takes up so much of my time. It\u2019d be so much easier if you\u2019d just die, but then that\u2019d cause its own problems too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mom.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that, you disgusting runt.\u201dThe woman threw a box of tissues at the boy. It didn\u2019t matter if it was light; it would definitely hurt if the corners hit him. The boy covered his head and looked at the woman in fear.\u201c\u2026No way.\u201dWhen she looked into the boy\u2019s eyes, Shizuna instinctively realized who he was. She realized that the boy who was afraid of the woman was Ryuichi, and that this was his younger self.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that look in your eyes? Is that how you look at your own mother?\u3000You\u2019re so ungrateful; you have no idea how much you owe me for giving birth to you!\u201dThe woman got up and started walking toward Ryuichi. He crouched down and desperately tried to avoid eye contact with the woman. The scene unfolding before her was beyond disgusting, and naturally, she couldn\u2019t just stay silent. She didn\u2019t know what this dream meant, but she felt like she was finally glimpsing into the darkness that Ryuichi truly held.This was a dream\u2026 Yes, this might be a dream that led to nothing. Still, she couldn\u2019t take the option of not helping Ryuichi while he was suffering. He saved her back then. She\u2019d spent so much time with him ever since and had received so much happiness from him\u2026\u00a0That\u2019s why it\u2019s my turn to save him this time,\u00a0she thought as she stood before the woman.\u201cWho the hell are you\u2026? And why are you here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2019Who\u2019, you say?\u201dAs she protected Ryuichi behind her back, she continued to address the woman.\u201cI am the person who will protect him. I won\u2019t let a horrible person like you hurt him!\u201d\u201cHah?\u201dSince this is a dream, I should be able to do as I please, she thought to herself and slapped the woman\u2019s cheek as hard as she could. A loud\u00a0slap\u00a0sound echoed, and the woman disappeared in a bubble.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Onee-chan?\u201dShizuna bit her lip as she tightly hugged his faintly trembling body in her arms, wondering how scared he must have been. The past was in the past, and there was nothing she could do to help his wounded heart. Still, in order to shake off this darkness, she vowed to stay by his side. She wanted to protect him; he, who was kind, strong, and just couldn\u2019t be left alone.\u201cRyuichi-kun, I\u2019ll always be by your side. No, not just me; Chisa-san and Mom care about you, too. So don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be all right.\u201dNo sooner had she muttered that than she woke up.\u201c\u2026A dream?\u201dThe lights were out, and her immediate surroundings were dark, but her eyes gradually got used to the darkness. Just before she\u2019d fallen asleep, she\u2019d been lying in Ryuichi\u2019s arms, but now she was in a position where she was holding him against her chest. Ryuichi, with his innocent sleeping face, was sleeping with his face buried in her soft and large breasts. The sight was so adorable that it made her giggle.\u201cRyuichi-kun, you said that to you, our encounter was a coincidence. But you know what? To me, it was fate. A fateful encounter that led me to know so deeply about the person I would come to love so much.\u201dIf that encounter hadn\u2019t happened, Shizuna surely wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with Ryuichi as much as she did. In fact, she wouldn\u2019t even have gotten to know him. She might have even believed the rumors and come to dislike him.\u201cI love you. I won\u2019t let anyone deny my feelings\u2026 Ryuichi-kun, I\u2019ll say it over and over again. I love you\u2026 I always have and always will, now and forevermore.\u201dIt was her vow, her wish, and she reaffirmed her determination to become the light that would ward off the nightmares of the person she loved.No matter what color he was tainted with, no matter what color he was covered in, she would always be there by his side, as a fresh coat of color that would paint over those impurities.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Another One Yet AgainTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cChisa, there\u2019re so many things I want to say to you.\u201d\u201cAhaha, I wonder what that could be?\u201dShe was grinning widely in front of him, while he was clutching his head in his hands. It was already the last day of May\u2019s Golden Week, and tomorrow school would start again as usual. He had planned to spend his last day off peacefully by himself, but at the last minute, some visitors unexpectedly showed up. It was Chisa and one other person.\u201cAre we being a bother to you, Ryuichi-kun\u2026?\u201dIt was Satsuki, and she was currently looking up at Ryuichi with a despondent look on her face. It wasn\u2019t very unusual for Chisa to come to his place, but he hadn\u2019t expected her to bring Satsuki along. Sure, she had asked him if she would see him again at the club, but he would\u2019ve never expected that this was how they\u2019d meet again: here, in his own home, even though they\u2019d only just met the other day.\u201cOh, come on, Ryuichi, what\u2019s the big deal? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s nice to have the three of us together like this?\u201d\u201cYou do know this is\u00a0my\u00a0place, right?\u201dEven though it wasn\u2019t her home, she had already popped open a can of beer and had even gotten a little drunk. Satsuki was also drinking some small sips of beer, but she wasn\u2019t as drunk as Chisa. Although she\u2019d been brought here by her, she seemed a little apologetic and reserved.\u201c\u2026Sigh.\u00a0Fine, I\u2019m only making an exception for today, got it?\u201d\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll be coming back sometime soon, \u2018kay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt seemed that at this point, anything he said would just go in her left ear and out the right. Well, that being said, however, Ryuichi wasn\u2019t going to keep complaining to them now that they\u2019d occupied his room and drank his alcohol. He would just have them make it up to him with something else.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll have you pay me back with your body later.\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019ve been wanting to have some fun with you anyways.\u201d\u201cPffft?!\u201dHearing this exchange, Satsuki spit out the beer in her mouth. She stopped herself short of spewing it all out on the floor by covering her mouth with her hand at the last second, but now she was the one in a pinch as some drops of beer started coming out of her nose. Ryuichi wordlessly handed her a piece of tissue. No lady would ever want to be seen like that, and even he knew this as well as he was trying to be considerate of her.\u201cT-Thank you sho much.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201dSeeing her pinching her nose with the tissue convinced him once more that she was just as adorable as a small animal. Her eyes were hidden by her hair, giving her a gloomy impression as always, but she had more than enough beauty and a stunning figure to compensate for this.\u201cYou\u2019re such a cute girl too, Satsuki.\u201d\u201cFueeh?!\u201dThe voice she made whenever she was surprised sounded ridiculous, but insanely cute. If he had been his previous self, he would have attacked her as soon as she came to his house; he would have corrupted her body and soul with the techniques he had cultivated. However, the current him had no intentions of having relations with her as long as she had no intentions of having relations with him. Well, this\u00a0 was how it normally went; the Ryuichi of the past was just that abnormal.\u201cI know, right? You have such a cute face, yet you\u2019re hiding it with those bangs of yours. It\u2019s really a shame.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026well\u2026because I\u2019m too shy.\u201dHolding her beer can with both her hands, she shrank back even further.Satsuki was a short and petite girl. Combined with her disproportionately large breasts for her short size, she must have attracted the desires of many men. In fact, Chisa had told Ryuichi that Satsuki had a slight aversion to men.If she doesn\u2019t like men, I can only imagine how traumatized she must be to be taken to a place like that.Since then, she had worked up the courage to cut ties with that friend of hers\u2026well, no, not really, but now she at least tried to refuse invitations that she didn\u2019t like. This was what Satsuki had to say about that.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you. You told me to clearly speak up whenever I didn\u2019t like something. Ehehe, when I think back to your words, it gives me courage. \u266a\u201dApparently his words had become a source of support for her, even though he hadn\u2019t really said them to encourage her. Still, regardless of his intent, he was supporting someone, and that wasn\u2019t a bad feeling for him.\u201cYou\u2019re a kind person, Ryuichi-kun. You\u2019ve always been that way to me.\u201dEven Shizuna had said this to him once before. He hadn\u2019t seen her today, but he felt like he\u2019d been with her for almost the entire duration of the holidays. She even kept saying on the phone that she couldn\u2019t wait for tomorrow to come, and that she wanted to see him as soon as possible.\u201cOh, right. Satsuki. Remember what you told me? C\u2019mon, try asking him for it.\u201d\u201cWha?! N-No, but\u2026umm\u2026err\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dChisa\u2019s words made Satsuki flustered. She glanced at Ryuichi, their eyes met, and then she looked away. Her face was bright red, and probably not just due to the alcohol. As he tilted his head in confusion, Satsuki, seemingly having resolved herself, began to speak.\u201cUmm\u2026I want you to try hugging me from behind. Chisa-san told me that being hugged by you from behind makes her feel really secure.\u201dWhen Ryuichi turned his eyes to Chisa, she nodded emphatically.\u201cHe\u2019s totally amazing. Even though he\u2019s younger than me, he feels so accepting of me. It\u2019s like I can instinctively tell this is what a reliable man looks like.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear you say that, but\u2026 Satsuki, you\u2019re drunk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, I am. But\u2026I want you to hug me.\u201dSeeing the pleading look in her eyes, he let out another sigh. Chalking it up as the ravings of a drunken person, he beckoned her over to him. She immediately smiled happily and walked over to him.\u201cSit here.\u201d\u201cO-Okay!\u201dSatsuki sat down so that she was sitting between his legs. Then, he hugged her as she rested her back against his chest.\u201cAhh\u2026this is so nice~. \u266a\u201d\u201cSee? He\u2019s, like, totally a devilish man. A very sinful man.\u201d\u201cCut it out\u2026\u201dWell, he already knew that he was well-liked by women. He wasn\u2019t at all popular with women his own age or younger, save for Shizuna, but he was well-liked by older women like Chisa and Sakie. Although his face did give off a brutish and fierce look, perhaps they\u2019d found him cute as someone younger than them.\u201cThis is so unlike me. Hey, Satsuki. Here you are snuggling up to me all defenceless like that, but are you ready for me to do something to you?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 \u266a\u201dWhen he whispered in her ear, Satsuki\u2019s body shivered. He put his hands on her large breasts without hesitation. He would have left it at that had she moved away from him, but she did not do that at all. In fact, she even relaxed her body and leaned against him more, entrusting herself to him.\u201cY\u2019know, Ryuichi, I\u2019m pretty sure she came here to do just that. Well, if I were in her shoes, I think I\u2019d develop a liking for the person who saved me from danger, too.\u201dEven with Chisa\u2019s affirmation, he obviously couldn\u2019t just go \u201cOkie-dokie, let\u2019s have sex then.\u201d\u201cListen, Satsuki. There are other women I\u2019m seeing besides Chisa, y\u2019know? I\u2019m not seeing as many as I used to, but still, that\u2019s the kind of scumbag I am.\u201dAfter hearing his words, she paused for a brief moment\u2026and eventually, she nodded.\u201c\u2026Sigh.\u00a0Why are all the women who flock to me like this?\u201d\u201cAhaha. But from what I\u2019ve heard from Shizuna, it seems like something special is going on between you two, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah, you could say that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Umm!\u201dSatsuki suddenly raised her voice. Ryuichi and Chisa both looked at her with surprised faces. Her face turned even redder than before, she said:\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing lots of women, then adding me to the count shouldn\u2019t be a problem, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dHe laughed at her very straightforward words and wondered why that had been the only sentence she could utter clearly without stuttering.\u201c\u2026I really do attract the strangest of women, huh.\u201dAnd with that, he stole her lips.Afterwards, there were three naked people on the futon. Ryuichi\u2019s muscular torso and the two women\u2019s seductive bodies were completely in the open. This scene was exactly the kind of paradise that all men desired, and Ryuichi was at the center of it.\u201cHow was it, Satsuki?\u201d\u201c\u2026It was incredible. Was I really loud?\u201dAnxious, she asked this question and was met with nods from Ryuichi and Chisa. She immediately looked as if she was going to cry, and instead of hiding her face using the futon\u2026she hid her face by hugging Ryuichi\u2019s chest tightly.\u201cFufu, looks like you\u2019re head over heels for Ryuichi too now, huh, Satsuki?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I\u2019m head over heels for him.\u201dSatsuki looked up at him with an intoxicated look in her eyes. Her bangs had been pulled up with a hairpin, so her beauty was on full display in its unadulterated form; if she showed her face now to a man at her university, they would definitely mistake her for someone else.\u201cDon\u2019t show that face to anybody else, got it?\u201d\u201cGot it. \u266aFrankly speaking, it was unusual for them to have a sexual relationship with each other in such a short period of time, but ultimately, Ryuichi was still Ryuichi. He didn\u2019t think much of it, and since both parties agreed that this was normal, there was nothing to really worry about.\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower.\u201dWith nothing but a change of clothes, Chisa headed for the bathroom.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201cSheesh, when you\u2019re like this, it almost seems like you\u2019re the younger one.\u201dWatching her rub her cheek against his chest, she really looked like a small animal. Now then, although they were right in the middle of their pillow talk session, there was a question he\u2019d wanted to ask her for a while. It was about the feeling of discomfort he\u2019d felt before, a doubt that\u2019d always lingered in the back of his mind.\u201cHey, Satsuki, do you have a younger brother?\u201d\u201cI do. He\u2019s the same age as you\u2026 Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSo I was right all along.\u00a0Ryuichi let out a sigh. There was a boy in his class whose last name was Shirasagi, and he was a boy who often hung out with Sohei. He was also one of the boys that he\u2019d met in the city while he was with Shizuna in disguise.\u201cBy the way, his name is Akira. Oh, come to think of it, isn\u2019t he in the same high school as you, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s the connection, huh.\u201dIt seemed that Ryuichi\u2019s guess had been spot on. There was one more memory of his that was bothering him\u2026but he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30A New SparkTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrA few days had passed since the holidays. Ryuichi\u2019s school life didn\u2019t see much change to it, but Shizuna\u2019s underwent a massive one. She was still conversing with Ryuichi and snuggling up to him like before, but the events that\u2019d occurred before the holiday prompted further massive changes in her.\u201cRindo-san is being threatened.\u201d\u201cRindo-san is being seduced by Shishido.\u201dHowever, perhaps unsurprisingly, rumors like these started to float around. The girls and boys in the classroom stared uncomfortably at not just Ryuichi, but Shizuna as well when they entered the room. Unlike Ryuichi, the stares directed at her were largely ones out of curiosity\u2026but still, it wasn\u2019t fun to be stared at and talked about.\u201cYo, it\u2019s the man of the hour.\u201d\u201cHeh, things have gotten pretty interesting, huh?\u201dMakoto and Kaname remarked at him as they walked up to him. As far as Ryuichi was concerned, he didn\u2019t really care about the rumors. He guessed Makoto and Kaname knew that, which was why they were trying to make it a laughing matter instead of being weirdly concerned about it. And it seemed the same was true for Shizuna, who had become the bulk of the rumors along with him.\u201cWell, they\u2019ll move on from it soon enough. I\u2019m the one who chose to be by Ryuichi-kun\u2019s side, and I don\u2019t really care about what they have to say about me, either\u2026though it does irritate me when I hear them badmouthing him.\u201dHer words made the three boys laugh. She was standing beside him openly and proudly, and the words she\u2019d spoken had clearly carried strong connotations for a certain group of people. At first, both Makoto and Kaname had been surprised at her change, but now they\u2019d grown used to it.\u201cMan, even Rindo\u2019s been totally tainted now, huh.\u201d\u201cNot bad if you ask me. Hey, Rindo, next time, how about you and I\u2014\u201d\u201cNo. My body is for Ryuichi-kun and Ryuichi-kun alone.\u201dEven though they were in the classroom, her words were clear and straightforward. She hadn\u2019t been that loud, so at worst, only few people nearby would have heard her. Still, there was no denying that it was quite shocking to hear those words from Shizuna, especially given how she was before.\u201cSeriously\u2026don\u2019t you know you\u2019re making things worse for yourself?\u201d\u201cAm I now\u2026? But you know, you\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve become this way, Ryuichi-kun. I say these things so clearly because I want to be with you.\u201dShe smiled happily at him. Seeing this, he couldn\u2019t help but smile too as he put his hands on her body. Seemingly aware of how Makoto and Kaname\u2019s bodies served as perfect cover for them at this angle, he relished the sensation of her body both naturally and inconspicuously at the same time.\u2026Man, Shizuna\u2019s really changed a lot, hasn\u2019t she? Also\u2014He glanced at Sohei, the protagonist of this world. He hadn\u2019t spoken to either Ryuichi or Shizuna since then. It seemed that the fact that Shizuna had already developed extreme feelings for Ryuichi and had actually had sexual relations together was a huge blow to him. Lifeless\u2026wasn\u2019t a term he\u2019d used for him, but he could clearly sense his sadness at having had Shizuna taken away from him.\u201cRyuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201cOof\u2026\u201dHowever, Shizuna didn\u2019t seem the least bit concerned about him; she looked the same as usual, and she was conversing normally with her friends. And yet, she wanted to be near him as much as possible, which led to this. She hugged him with all her might, even though she had previously kept touching him to a minimum in the classroom.\u201cSqueeeze~\u00a0\u266a\u201d\u201cPretty bold now, are we?\u201dShe sat on his lap and leaned in so that she could put her arms behind his head. Held against her large bosom, he was able to feel her ample breasts on his cheeks, and at school, no less.Makoto and Kaname welcomed the situation, and in the seats away from them, Shizuna\u2019s friends who understood what was going on between them were laughing. The rest of their classmates stared at them with incredulity or even skepticism, but he didn\u2019t care.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot lately.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cAbout how you\u2019re such a wonderful woman. And also\u2026\u201dRyuichi\u2019s face was a rare, embarrassed one. The truth was, just before the holidays started, he had a dream that made him flashback to his childhood. It was a memory of his mother, the source of his darkness and his skewed perception of women embedded deep in his mind.\u201cI wish you were never born.\u201dHe could even hear his mother\u2019s voice in his mind while he was unconscious, and that dream was no different as his mother spat those words at him while violently abusing him. The Ryuichi in the dream hadn\u2019t been as strong or imposing as he was now, partly because he had been so young. He\u2019d been overcome with grief and frustration when suddenly\u2026Shizuna appeared in his dream.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dUnlike the young Ryuichi, she had been her present, grown-up self. He couldn\u2019t describe just how secure and relieved he\u2019d felt in her arms. He\u2019d known that it was nothing but a dream, a temporary world that was not reality. Still, being saved by her in that dream was an unforgettable memory to him.\u201cR-Ryuichi-kun?!\u201d\u201cWoah, woah, he\u2019s actually getting embarrassed.\u201d\u201c\u2026This is so bizarre in so many ways.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dWell, it must\u2019ve been quite rare even among his friends to see his embarrassed face, seeing as he was usually known as a delinquent. As for Shizuna, her eyes lit up and her embrace grew even stronger.\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dRyuichi decided to obediently let Shizuna do what she wanted. While he spent his time like this, he already had another boy on his mind besides Sohei. It was Akira, Satsuki\u2019s younger brother and his classmate. He was Sohei\u2019s best friend and Ryuichi had often seen them together. He\u2019d been glaring at him even now while he was talking to Sohei.\u201cYo, Ryuichi. What did you do to Shirasagi this time?\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t done nothing\u2026 Well, I may have fucked his sister, so\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u00a0did\u00a0do something.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t done anything to Akira personally, but there was no doubt he\u2019d laid his hands on his relative. But since Satsuki likely hadn\u2019t mentioned that to him, Akira\u2019s glare at Ryuichi was probably just because he was also the source of what had gotten Sohei into the state he was in now.\u201cRindo, are you okay with this? Y\u2019know, Ryuichi havin\u2019 fun with other women.\u201dWhen Kaname asked Shizuna this, she nodded.\u201cIt does make me a little jealous, but I don\u2019t think ordinary women can resist Ryuichi\u2019s charms. That woman\u2014Satsuki-san, was it?\u2014I think she\u2019s almost in the same situation as I was before, and once she\u2019s had the chance to sleep with such a strong man like him, it\u2019s basically impossible for her to resist him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s even been kinder these days.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Geez, Ryuichi-kun is such a wonderful person! \u266a\u201dHe had no idea if Shizuna\u2019s limiter had been removed or something, but he let out a sigh nonetheless and wanted to remind her once again that they were in a classroom.Aside from Sohei, there was nothing he had to worry about at this stage, not even Akira. From what he\u2019d heard from Satsuki, they had a good relationship as brother and sister, though things could turn troublesome if Akira found out about their relationship\u2026Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but let out another sigh.\u2026But still, I feel like I\u2019m forgetting something. Shirasagi\u2026 Shirasagi\u2026 It\u2019s right there, but I\u2019m missing the last puzzle piece to the answer.Turning back the clock a bit, when Satsuki had just come home after sleeping with Ryuichi and experiencing the joys of womanhood for the first time. Although she had informed her parents that she would be staying at her friend\u2019s house, they had been very suspicious nonetheless when they saw her come back home the next morning, but she never mentioned Ryuichi\u2019s name at all.Her parents would have been very happy if they\u2019d heard that Satsuki, someone who\u2019d never had a man in her life before, had finally fallen in love, but there were some complicated circumstances behind her relationship with Ryuichi, preventing her from letting them know.\u201cIntroduce me to him sometime, okay, Satsuki?\u201d\u201cGeez, I told you it\u2019s not like that.\u201dAs she made her way to her room as if to escape from her mother, her brother was standing there waiting for her.\u201cAkira? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNee-chan\u2026 Did you go somewhere?\u201d\u201cYes, I went to my friend\u2019s house\u2026 Sorry, I\u2019ve got to get changed now, so we\u2019ll have to talk later.\u201d\u201cGuh\u2026 Nee-chan!\u201dAkira tightly hugged her from behind. She chuckled in exasperation, but at the same time, she felt like something was missing. Her brother wasn\u2019t as masculine as Ryuichi\u2026 Well, she didn\u2019t have any special feelings for her\u00a0brother in the first place, but she couldn\u2019t help but compare him to Ryuichi anyway.\u201cAkira, how long are you going to keep hugging your sister like this? You\u2019re already a high school student; you\u2019ve got to find a girl you can actually do these things with.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAkira said nothing.Afterwards, she and Akira let go of each other, but she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t know the feelings that Akira held for her; his feelings for his own blood-related sister that went beyond that of siblings. She didn\u2019t know of the possessive desire for her in his eyes, or of his feelings that were so dangerously close to exploding at any moment.Ryuichi was right to be concerned about Akira\u2026or more precisely, he was right to be concerned about the Shirasagi name. That was because Shirasagi Satsuki and Shirasagi Akira were characters who were given names in the manga.Akira was Sohei\u2019s best friend, but he was also a man who wanted to dominate his own sister. Sohei often came to Akira\u2019s house to visit him because he was his best friend, but Akira was jealous of the way Satsuki treated Sohei, and thus, he took action. This must\u2019ve undoubtedly caused many readers to think, \u201cSeriously?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201c?!\u201dThe abrupt murmur that left Satsuki\u2019s mouth along with a sweet breath didn\u2019t slip past Akira\u2019s ears unheard.Akira knew that Satsuki was timid and a pushover, and that\u00a0she wasn\u2019t able to say no.What Akira didn\u2019t know was that, thanks to Ryuichi\u2019s words,\u00a0she was now able to do just that.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Ryuichi Never Changes, Regardless of Whom He\u2019s Dealing WithTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was after school.Homeroom had just ended, and Ryuichi was about to leave the classroom with Shizuna when Akira, who had been persistently eyeing him like Sohei had before, confronted him. It wasn\u2019t particularly surprising since Ryuichi had had a feeling that Akira would eventually get involved.\u201cShishido, we need to talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sure, fine by me.\u201dThen, he turned to Shizuna.He was trying to tell her that it\u2019d be great if their conversation wrapped up quickly, but that he expected they would take some time, so she could leave first. Shizuna shook her head in response, seemingly having understood him despite them having exchanged no words between each other.\u201cI\u2019m not going to go home, you know? Of course I\u2019ll wait here for you.\u201dShe said she would never leave his side; she would walk home with him no matter what. Ryuichi relented and gave a wry smile, whereas Akira stared at her in disbelief.\u201c\u2026Hey, Rindo. What on earth happened to you? I want to know: do you not feel anything seeing Sohei the way he is right now?\u201d\u201cIf I had to say between yes or no, then yes, I do have some thoughts about him. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything I can do for him as I am now. Shirasagi-kun, have you heard what happened between me and Sohei-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, but I can hazard a guess. He\u2019s your childhood friend, y\u2019know? Why did you choose to be with somebody like\u00a0him\u00a0instead of Sohei?\u201dShizuna raised her eyes at his words. He took a step back, perhaps frightened by her gaze, but when Ryuichi saw Shizuna getting angry, he sighed, wondering if it was happening all over again. Although he had never actually lost his temper like Shizuna did, he found it annoying hearing her say the same thing over and over again.\u201cShizuna.\u201dHe put his hand on Shizuna\u2019s shoulder, who seemed just about ready to angrily shout at Akira in the middle of the hallway at school. Whenever Shizuna got angry or had an unhappy expression on her face, touching her body like this was the best way to calm her down.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cCome on now, you shouldn\u2019t\u2026well, I won\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t\u00a0ever\u00a0get angry, but you don\u2019t have to get angry at every single thing. Our relationship isn\u2019t for others to decide or complain about. Just put on a bright smile when you\u2019re by my side.\u201dWith that, he started walking with his hand still on her shoulders.\u201cHurry up; let\u2019s make this quick, Shirasagi.\u201dSurely he won\u2019t complain about her being here after that,\u00a0he thought as he took her with him. Sure enough, Akira indeed kept silent about her presence. They then made their way to the empty rooftop.\u201cSo? What do you want?\u201dAkira managed to reply even as Ryuichi and Shizuna stared him down.\u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point\u2026 Do you know my sister?\u201dHe had thought the probability was there, albeit low, but it seemed Akira really did want to ask about his sister, Satsuki. Of course, he couldn\u2019t have known Ryuichi and Satsuki had slept with each other; he was just mentioning her name to bait him. However, Ryuichi decided to answer anyway.\u201cYou mean Satsuki? Well, I didn\u2019t know she was your sister, but yeah, I do know her.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026 Where did you two meet?\u201dRyuichi\u2019s eyes narrowed as he watched Akira\u2019s tone of voice grow stronger.This may be a little off-topic, but Ryuichi has come across many kinds of people. Kind, affectionate people like Shizuna and Chisa, or Sakie and Satsuki; people like his father and mother\u2026and people who think they\u2019re hiding their inner desires even though they\u2019re blatantly leaking them out.Does this guy actually feel\u00a0that\u00a0way for Satsuki? Even though they\u2019re probably blood-related siblings\u2026? Haaah, what a sinful world this is.He didn\u2019t particularly feel scorn or contempt for him; he just accepted it, strangely enough. There were people like him who had relationships with many women, and conversely, there were women who were attracted to those like him. And then there were those who thought like Akira, that was all.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business where we met.\u201d\u201cOf course it is every bit my business!\u201dAkira raised his voice very loudly. The way Akira was staring at him, he could tell how strong his feelings for her were. He glanced next to him and saw that Shizuna was also looking at Akira with great interest. He put his hand on her shoulder to protect her in case Akira went into a frenzy.\u201cAkira, are you actually\u2014\u201dJust as he was about to say the words that would strike at the heart of the matter, a black-and-white picture filled his mind. It was as if he was looking at a manga.\u201cHey, Onee-chan, why do you care so much about Sohei when you have me?!\u201d\u201cStop it, Akira\u2026please, it\u2019s not too late to turn back.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can turn back\u2026 You belong to me, Onee-chan\u2026 I won\u2019t hand you over to anybody!\u201dFinally, the memory that had evaded him by the slightest of margins returned to him. Akira was in love with his own sister, Satsuki, and when he saw her taking care of Sohei, the smoldering desire within him exploded, and he attacked her. But Satsuki wasn\u2019t actually in love with Sohei; she only treated him nicely because he was Akira\u2019s friend, but Akira\u2019s mind went off the deep end on its own.\u201c\u2026Damn, this world is seriously immoral.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was the taste or fetish of the author who drew the manga, or if he originally intended to make it this way, but there was also a scene where Satsuki tried to cheer up Sohei, who despaired at having seen Shizuna cuckolded from him.\u00a0But who would\u2019ve known things would turn out like\u2026well, yeah.\u00a0It seemed that in works like these, all the protagonists were hopeless and irredeemable.\u201cAre you okay, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cYup, totally fine.\u201dStill, even though he\u2019d brought about a major change in the flow and very premise of the world, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019d stolen Shizuna away from Sohei all the same. Even if it\u2019d been caused by happenstance upon happenstance, and both Ryuichi and Shizuna\u2019s way of thinking were different from the manga, nothing had changed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd now, Akira\u2019s mind was setting off on a frenzy, albeit indirectly. The jealousy he should\u2019ve held for Sohei was now directed toward Ryuichi. It was a much stronger jealousy than depicted in the manga, likely because it was Ryuichi this time.\u201cI said, where did you meet my sister\u2026 Where did you meet my precious belonging?!\u201dAkira impatiently walked up to him. It seemed he was quite angry, and his perception of Satsuki, which he\u2019d been hiding in the recesses of his mind, bubbled to the surface. He was convinced he was in love with her, but in reality, he just wanted to keep her as his own.\u201c\u2026\u2019Belonging\u2019, huh. I have to say, that way of thinking is exactly how mine used to be.\u201dWhen he saw it in someone else rather than himself, he could see just how horrifying it was. He surely had once been like this. And if his memory had not returned, he might have kept Shizuna, whose shoulder he was now holding, in his possession as he wished.There may have been some similarities between the two Ryuichis in how they had relationships with many women, but at least the current Ryuichi didn\u2019t consider them as objects or belongings. Even if they didn\u2019t understand this, Ryuichi would continue to see them as equals.\u201cFufu, being treated as Ryuichi\u2019s belonging sounds like it\u2019d be exciting.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dShe had apparently heard his mutterings and spoke up. Her words cut straight through the tense atmosphere, and Ryuichi was taken aback, but he laughed inside, thinking that she was a masochist through and through.\u201cBut I think I still prefer making love with you when we see each other eye-to-eye. That\u2019s why I like the present you now, you know? You still have that same blunt side to you, but at the same time, you also have a very gentle side. That\u2019s why I love you.\u201dShe smiled widely, which made him smile as well. They had completely ignored Akira\u2019s presence, but now Ryuichi turned to look at him again.\u201cHey, Shirasagi. Satsuki isn\u2019t some sort of object or belonging.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201dHis very decision to deny Ryuichi\u2019s statement was abnormal. He should have nodded his head when Ryuichi told him that Satsuki wasn\u2019t an object. His response was an affirmation that he truly saw Satsuki as a thing. Of course, there must\u2019ve been a reason for those distorted feelings of his, but Ryuichi had already slept with Satsuki before, and more importantly, he wasn\u2019t going to just look the other way and feign ignorance now especially since he\u2019d been the cause of him revealing his feelings like this.\u201cI won\u2019t deny your twisted feelings for Satsuki; after all, love comes in many forms. But, the fact that you see her as an object is what makes it a problem for me.\u201dWell, even so, the world of manga was a convenient one precisely because one could give pleasure and instill a distorted happiness in another. At Ryuichi\u2019s words, Akira\u2019s eyebrows lifted and he glared at him. He could have punched him in the face, but he was too scared to do so because his opponent was Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019m just saying. Help Satsuki, and\u2026no, I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019m not like you! I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m\u2026dammit!\u201dAkira stormed out of the rooftop. Neither Ryuichi nor Shizuna stopped him as Ryuichi took out his phone and called Satsuki. As a matter of fact, they had actually exchanged numbers when she stayed the night at his place.\u201c\u2026Wonder if she\u2019ll pick\u2014\u201d\u201cHello, Ryuichi-kun? \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe had picked up the phone instantly. He couldn\u2019t help but grin when he heard her beautiful voice over the phone. However, he had a reason he\u2019d called her like this.\u201cHey, Satsuki. I owe you a little apology.\u201dIn a sense, their exchange just now had lit a flame inside of Akira. Of course, he knew that he was probably not wrong in thinking that Akira would have definitely taken action sooner or later even if he had decided not to talk to him like this. He felt bad for Akira, but he retold their entire conversation to Satsuki.\u201c\u2026I see. So that\u2019s how Akira felt about me.\u201d\u201cSorry. I think I may have fanned the flames. Are your parents usually at home?\u201d\u201cOne of my parents is always at home, whether it\u2019s my mom or dad. Fufu, are you worried about me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dIncidentally, her voice was subtly leaking through the phone, so Shizuna could hear their entire conversation. Shizuna put her hand over her mouth and smiled with a chuckle.\u201cI love how you can answer so decisively like that right off the bat, but\u2026it\u2019s troubling how unaware you are of these things. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re the dense protagonist from my friend\u2019s favorite manga.\u201dAnnoyed at having been called dense, he flicked her on her forehead.\u201cAhh. \u266a\u201dA satisfying\u00a0smack\u00a0sound rang out, and almost immediately after, a slightly naughty voice could be heard from Shizuna. It went without saying that naturally, Satsuki grumbled about how jealous she was of her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32What Ryuichi is to ChisaTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cOh, Chisa-san. Good evening.\u201d\u201cOh my, hello there, Makoto-kun.\u201dIt was the night after Ryuichi spoke with Akira. Chisa and Makoto were at the club where they\u2019d met Satsuki. Their meeting wasn\u2019t a planned one; they\u2019d run into each other by chance.\u201cMind if I sit next to you?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dShe was having some alcohol as he sat down next to her. Both of them were flamboyant-looking to fit the venue, but they were still quite picturesque seeing as they were both beautiful and handsome to boot. The club was always full of regulars, so Chisa and Makoto had many acquaintances. There were quite a few people who were after Chisa, just as there were quite a few who were after Makoto as well.\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been coming here a lot since then, huh, Chisa-san.\u201d\u201cI guess so. I really like the bustle here, you see.\u201dWhile pouring some more beer into her now empty cup, she continued.\u201cBack then, I was just like Ryuichi\u2014playing around and having fun with lots of men\u2014but once I got to know him, no other man could satisfy me anymore. He really is a sinful man.\u201d\u201cAhaha, does that \u2018other men\u2019 part include me?\u201d\u201cWhat, you interested in me now?\u201dMakoto shook his head. He was only joking; he knew that Chisa wasn\u2019t in the market for any other man besides Ryuichi. So, had he nodded his head at her question, it would\u2019ve surprised her, but more importantly, the image that he held of her would\u2019ve been instantly shattered.\u201cWell, he\u00a0is\u00a0a sinful man, I\u2019ll give you that. The way he used to treat women like tools was kinda iffy to me, but lately it looks like he\u2019s been taking good care of you and Rindo. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s changed completely on the inside.\u201d\u201cSo even you think that, huh, Makoto-kun.\u201dTheir thoughts were completely right, but as for how Ryuichi\u2019s change came about\u2026the thought that he could\u2019ve regained his memories didn\u2019t even cross their minds. They were, in the end, residents of this world alone, and unlike Ryuichi, they weren\u2019t aware of the existence of the other world.\u201cBoss, juice please.\u201d\u201cAh, can I really have this?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cThanks!\u201dWell, even though he was underage, he sometimes drank alcohol, but Chisa obviously chose to offer him juice. He looked cute for his age as he happily drank the juice, and in this place where only adults gathered, young men like him were well-liked by older women, just like in the case of Ryuichi. Chisa didn\u2019t really think much of it, but he certainly had the makings to be popular.\u201cHaah, this juice is damn good.\u201d\u201cThanks, kid.\u201d\u201cYou got any snacks to go with these? \u2026Nah, you\u2019ve probably only got meals, huh.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got some.\u201d\u201cYou do?!\u201dThey were a well-prepared bartender. Thus, Makoto snacked on some food while chatting with Chisa. After he ate a handful, he asked her this.\u201cOh right, I\u2019ve always wanted to ask you this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already talked about how Ryuichi was a different man in the past. He was good at seducing women and pleasuring them\u2026but he could also be cruel at times, couldn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cSo why did you choose to keep seeing him, Chisa-san? Were you unable to resist his charm, or were you perhaps unable to resist his\u00a0manliness?\u201dChisa let out a giggle at his words. She poured some more beer into her empty glass yet again, guzzled it down, and then answered him.\u201cThe first time I slept with Ryuichi, I thought he was a very unusual man in so many ways. He was very good with women, and his choice of words, though offensive, was a mix between half-calculated and half-sincere so as not to make me feel uncomfortable. Basically, he was very good at making women happy.\u201d\u201cTrue. I think he\u2019s taught me how to woo women a few times before, too.\u201d\u201cOh my, is that so? \u2026Well, we can talk about that later, but basically, there was something about the way he made love to me that\u2026I don\u2019t know, felt\u00a0off. It felt like, as a woman, he was looking at me with hatred in his eyes, or more precisely, he was looking beyond me, the woman he was making love to, and at someone else.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dThat was something Makoto had never heard before. Sure, he knew Ryuichi had some cruel parts to him, but he\u2019d always thought that was the ultimate form of womanizing. As for the rest, well, he did know that Ryuichi truly hated his family from the bottom of his heart.\u201cMy parents, well\u2026they\u2019re trash. They don\u2019t deserve to be alive.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit much?\u201d\u201cWell, that only applies to my shitty parents. Your mom and dad are really nice people, y\u2019know? They treat even somebody like me normally.\u201dMakoto realized that that conversation he\u2019d had with Ryuichi a while back actually had a meaning.\u201cThe moment I met Ryuichi, I realized he was an outcast just like me. That\u2019s why, well, I thought it\u2019d be nice to sleep with him and stick by his side. I also thought that if he didn\u2019t have a special girl yet, I could put myself out to fill that role and be his lover.\u201dEven Chisa thought that way of thinking was very much like her. Her encounter with Ryuichi had been out of left field, but it had also been a coincidence that she became aware of the darkness he was harboring. To Chisa, who practically lived a free life, it was her first time meeting a younger boy with a complicated past and darkness; he had charmed her in many ways, and that made her want to watch over him.\u201cNow he has Shizuna-chan, doesn\u2019t he? She\u2019s one hell of a girl. I\u2019m sure she can enter the recesses of Ryuichi\u2019s mind much sooner than I can. I wonder if that makes her good at handling men, in a sense?\u201d\u201cNah, that girl\u2019s genuinely in love with Ryuichi. In fact, judging from the way you phrased yourself, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve realized it too, huh.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. Y\u2019know, it almost feels like she\u2019s a heroine straight out of a story.\u201d\u201cA heroine, you say\u2026yeah, I can totally see that.\u201dA voice saying,\u00a0No, she actually is a genuine, bona-fide heroine,\u00a0could be heard somewhere.\u201cIt looks like Ryuichi\u2019s working his ass off for another girl today.\u201d\u201cAh, he did mention something about going to Shirasagi\u2019s house\u2026 Is she the woman from that one time?\u201d\u201cYep, yep. She said she has a younger brother.\u201d\u201cHaha, so that\u2019s the connection. Well, I\u2019m sure Ryuichi will be just fine.\u201d\u201cTotally. Well, even if he doesn\u2019t interfere, I\u2019m sure Satsuki-chan will be just fine, too.\u201dThus, the two spent the rest of their time chatting happily with each other. Naturally, their topics of conversation were mainly related to Ryuichi, and if he were around, he would definitely yell at them to stop talking about him.To Satsuki, Akira was just a brother to her. Nothing more, and nothing less. That was how she felt even now as he was pushing her down like this.\u201cAkira, get off of me.\u201d\u201cOnee-chan\u2026I!\u201d\u201cGet off of me.\u201dRyuichi had contacted her and reassured her that he would be waiting for her outside, and Satsuki went home and waited for the time to come\u00a0in her room. Well, she wasn\u2019t sure if Akira would take any action, but in the end, he actually entered her room silently without knocking and pushed her down.Honestly, she felt uncomfortable to be seen in a sexual light by her own brother. It was enough to make her instantly lose all the feelings she had for him as her brother.\u201cI love you, Onee-chan\u2026 Hey, what did you do with Shishido\u2026? What did you do with him, Onee-chan?! You have me, don\u2019t you?! I\u2019ve always been by your side, haven\u2019t I?!\u201d\u201cYes, you have. But that was you being by my side as my\u00a0brother, right?\u201dAs she\u2019d said many times before, she only saw Akira as her brother and nothing more. No matter what he did to her, she would never see him as somebody of the opposite sex, much less think of him as a man,\u00a0forever. If she searched all across the world, she was sure she could find an older sister who could fall in love with her blood-related brother\u2026but Satsuki couldn\u2019t see herself like that at all.But I think the old me would\u2019ve just kept quiet. The old me might\u2019ve even dared to accept whatever he did to me, just to protect his heart.It was a chilling thought.No matter how much she may have cared about her brother, she was terrified of her past self, who would have accepted such an irreversible decision as right and just.\u201c\u2026I\u2026I!\u201d\u201cGet off of me, Akira.\u00a0Now.\u201dAkira got away from her as if he\u2019d lost all the strength in his body. He sat there and stayed where he was, unmoving, but Satsuki had no more words left to say to him. Putting her disheveled clothes back in order, she told her parents that she would be heading outside for a bit and went out.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dImmediately, she found Ryuichi standing with his back against a telephone pole near her house. If anyone had seen him loitering around there like that, they might\u2019ve even reported him to the police, but even so, he stood there the entire time just in case something happened to her.\u201cBy the looks of things, it doesn\u2019t look like anything happened to you\u2026did it?\u201d\u201cYes. He told me he liked me\u2026but I told him to put an end to it. Akira is such an important brother to me\u2026how did things come to this?\u201dHuman emotions couldn\u2019t be controlled, and it wasn\u2019t up to others to tell someone when to fall in love. Even if one fell in love with someone related to them by blood, it was easy to point out to them they shouldn\u2019t harbor those feelings, but one couldn\u2019t simply make them disappear.\u201c\u2026I guess part of the blame does lie on me, though.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true. It\u2019s useless to worry about that now, so please don\u2019t. Actually, no, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHe cocked his head to the side. She continued.\u201cI met you and came to like you, Ryuichi-kun. Please don\u2019t call those pure feelings of mine the cause of all this.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2026guess that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dSatsuki\u2019s smile was beautiful under the light of the street lamp.Comparing his past memories with his current self, Ryuichi had really brought about a huge change. The simple act of deviating from the world\u2019s course at the start had now brought him to attract and charm many people. He would soon learn that that was a fate he himself had brought about.\u201cOnee-chan! Onee-chan!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy am I doing\u00a0this\u00a0with my brother\u2026? Argh, I don\u2019t care anymore. I had a screw loose in my head the moment I let him force himself on my body as he pleased. I\u2019m so dirty now\u2026who cares what he does to me anymore.Yes, the world had truly changed just by a simple deviation.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33She Smiled as She Declared Herself a Bad GirlTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrWhether the issue between Satsuki and her brother, Akira, had been resolved or not was\u2026still up for debate, but that very same day, Satsuki told her parents that she wanted to live alone. She had been commuting from her parents\u2019 house because of its proximity to her university, but she wanted to experience living on her own while she still could, which she conveyed to her parents.As for her parents, they must have felt very sad to see her go. But her resolve was firm, and so, they apparently gave her permission to live alone, albeit reluctantly. She immediately communicated this to Ryuichi and also added that although there was a rift between her and Akira, she wanted to forget about him for now.\u201cRyuichi-kun, you can come over to my new apartment anytime, okay?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201dRyuichi gave a wry smile as he responded to her words, which were filled with anticipation. She had rented an apartment nearby, and Ryuichi could visit anytime he wanted to. Chisa was going to come over to celebrate Satsuki\u2019s first attempt at living on her own, giving her a lot of advice while she was at it.\u201cYou better be there too, you hear me?\u201dSince Chisa had sternly warned him, well, Ryuichi had no choice but to go. He could have ignored her, but Chisa had a scary side to her whenever she got angry. They were in a sex friends-like relationship, but just as he\u2019d said before, she was also like a nagging older sister to him.That was why he didn\u2019t want to do anything to anger her too much.He was relieved to hear that they had decided to meet up at Satsuki\u2019s place on the weekend, but now at school, Makoto gave him a nudge on his shoulder, truly amused at what he was seeing.\u201cMan, he\u2019s totally glaring at you. His face is just screaming, \u2018You fucking piece of shit, you ruined my relationship with my sister. Go to hell.\u2019\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dJust when he thought the problem with Satsuki had been taken care of, he was now up against an Akira who was ruefully glaring at him, which he had expected in a sense. His friends were puzzled as to what the hell was going on, but they backed away from him once they realized it was Ryuichi he was glaring at.\u201cMan, they seem hellbent on avoiding a confrontation with somebody as scary as you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny to watch. I guess they find it easier to just not get involved in the first place rather than wasting their time otherwise.\u201d\u201cYou said it. Well, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t have anything to worry about, but if something does happen, lemme know.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with you today?\u201dNormally Makoto would\u2019ve left the conversation off with a jab at him, but today he was telling him to tell him if something happened; in other words, that he would help Ryuichi. Since Ryuichi was a friend of Makoto\u2019s, there was nothing wrong with him helping out, but since he was a little different than usual, Ryuichi was curious.\u201cI had a chat with Chisa-san at the club yesterday. You see, we were talking about you.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHeh, y\u2019know, there\u2019s no end to the amount of topics we can talk about when it comes to you.\u201d\u201cHold up, what the hell did you two talk about?\u201d\u201cI would like to know the answer to that as well.\u201dRyuichi and Makoto reflexively jumped to their toes when they suddenly heard a voice. They had been sure that they were the only two people in the room, and yet when they turned to look at where the voice was coming from, they saw Shizuna standing there naturally as if it were a matter of course. The two were truly shocked to see her, who had given them no sign of her presence at all.\u201cWhat, I\u2019ve been here the whole time, you know! You don\u2019t have to look so shocked!\u201d\u201cThat makes you all the more terrifying!:\u201c\u2026I have to say, you\u2019ve changed a whole lot too, haven\u2019t you, Rindo?\u201dApparently Shizuna had been there the whole time, unable to join them in their lively conversation. She puffed up her cheeks, grabbed the hem of Ryuichi\u2019s shirt and glared at Makoto. The glare was cute, and Makoto laughed.\u201cLooks like the princess is jealous of me. You sure are loved, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cReally, now?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I want to talk to you all the time, too, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cShe says it so naturally\u2026\u201dSeemingly embarrassed by her straightforward confession, Shizuna looked down at the ground. Seeing this, Ryuichi chuckled and placed his hand on her head. Even though Makoto\u2019s body was shielding them from view, their classmates could still see them to a certain extent. However, Ryuichi had long passed the point of worrying about it.\u201cI\u2026am such an easy woman, aren\u2019t I? Just being patted by you on the head like this makes me so happy.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s a natural reaction to have if it\u2019s the person you love, don\u2019t you think? It doesn\u2019t make you \u2018easy\u2019 or anything like that.\u201d\u201cWell, maybe\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat if somebody other than Ryuichi patted your head?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d hate that.\u201dHer voice was stern and forceful. When Makoto reached his hand out for her head as a test, her gaze turned pointed and she glared at him.\u201cMy, my, how scary.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry. I just can\u2019t stand the thought of being touched by any other man than Ryuichi-kun.\u201dRyuichi found Shizuna\u2019s annoyed expression quite charming. There were times when she showed expressions like these that befitted her age, and there were other times when she showed an incredibly motherly expression like the one she\u2019d had in his dream.\u201cGuess I should feel honored, huh.\u201dShizuna smiled brightly when she heard Ryuichi\u2019s mutter.She was such a kind and caring girl through and through. She had a strong heart and never wavered. The only reason she spent time with Ryuichi and his friends was because she chose to. Regardless of what people spoke about her, she\u2019d never left his side, ever.She was such a young woman, but today would be his first time witnessing her talking back to an adult. On his way back from the restroom during lunch break, he found Shizuna talking to the school counselor on the staircase landing. She and the teacher, a young man with a buzz cut named Hamasaki who also happened to be the coach for the baseball team, were alone.\u201cRindo, I\u2019ve heard that recently, you\u2019ve been hanging around delinquents like Shishido and Fushimi. The teachers are worried you might be being threatened in some way\u2026 Would you like to talk to me about it?\u201dRyuichi let out a sigh seeing as how even the teachers were the same. He knew that although he was a changed man now, his attitude in class used to be bad and the teachers didn\u2019t like him. Even so, his grades weren\u2019t too bad, which was probably the reason why they thought he was so cocky.\u201cAs teachers, we are here to protect the students. So Rindo, please tell me everything.\u201dWell, Hamasaki had a point. An honor student like Shizuna hanging out with Ryuichi and the other delinquents; it was natural to think that they might have done something to her. Shizuna\u2019s friends weren\u2019t worried, but it wasn\u2019t strange for him to feel differently since students and teachers had a different, more distanced relationship with each other.\u2026Well, I guess I\u2019ll come up to them when the timing\u2019s right.Of course, Shizuna wasn\u2019t being threatened by Ryuichi in the first place; she was with him and his friends of her own volition. In other words, the concerns of Hamasaki and the teachers were completely unfounded, that was all there was to it\u2026 However, it seemed Shizuna had something else she wanted to say.\u201cI am not being threatened at all. I am with them\u2026with Ryuichi-kun of my own volition. Oh, and don\u2019t respond to my answer with misguided accusations like, \u2018I knew it, you must be being threatened,\u2019 or \u2018They must be blackmailing you,\u2019 or any other such responses.\u201d\u201cUrk\u2026Rindo, I\u2026\u201d\u201cSensei\u2014\u201dShizuna cut him off. Ryuichi couldn\u2019t see her expression, but whatever it was made Hamasaki take a step back from her.\u201cI know full well that Ryuichi, Fushimi, and some of the other people I am close with are considered delinquents. But there is no rule that says I can\u2019t interact or associate with them based on that alone.\u201d\u201cRindo, I\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201dThud.\u00a0Shizuna stomped her foot on the floor. It was a light stomp, but it was enough to stop Hamasaki\u2019s voice.\u201cSensei, you said that the teachers are there to protect the students, right?\u201d\u201cY-Yes, I did\u2026what about it?\u201d\u201cWhy do you speak that way about Ryuichi-kun and his friends when they are also students? Doesn\u2019t that go against what you said?\u201dThose words must\u2019ve come as harsh to Hamaski. Ryuichi understood from the get-go that teachers wanted to get rid of students who were inconvenient to them. Even if they weren\u2019t directly affected, if there was even the slightest of ill-natured rumors, they would want to avoid getting involved with them and would even want them to disappear.\u201c\u2026Although frustrating, I do understand where the teachers are coming from. But still, I choose to follow my feelings rather than my logic. Hey, Sensei, did you know Ryuichi-kun is a very kind man? He saved me when I was being harassed by a playboy and chased him away.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cHonestly speaking, I too had only known about the bad parts of him up until that point. Yes, there are legitimate reasons he is called a delinquent by everybody else. But I don\u2019t want to completely shut out the other person without hearing their side of the story first, especially if it\u2019s someone I care deeply about.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s eyes widened at those words. He had received many words from her, but this was his first time hearing her say that she cared about him dearly in front of others.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t used to being told that he was important, that he was cared for. Her words touched his heart because the person he wanted to hear those words from, the person he wanted to have tell him he was precious, even if it was a lie, had always told him that he was a nuisance, a mistake.\u201cSensei, if you\u2019re worried about me because I\u2019m a good student, then thank you. You don\u2019t have to worry about me anymore\u2014I\u2019m a\u00a0bad girl\u00a0now.\u201dThis was something she\u2019d said to him once before: that she was a bad girl. He didn\u2019t expect to hear those words again in the form of a declaration to a teacher. He tilted his head in confusion at his strangely pounding heart as Shizuna walked down the stairs, only to come across Ryuichi waiting there.\u201cAh, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026you talked about some really embarrassing things back there, huh.\u201d\u201cFufu, so you were listening. But it\u2019s okay; nothing I said was a lie. I just said what was on my mind.\u201dThen, Shizuna, who seemed to have thought of something, grinned and hugged him. She tiptoed as high as she could and kissed him on the cheek. Knowing that Hamasaki could clearly see them, she then said.\u201cI\u2019m a bad girl; I\u2019m more than willing to do even this at school. \u266a\u201dShizuna\u2019s smile at that moment was truly beautiful,\u00a0Ryuichi would later say.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Slowly Realizing It Little by LittleTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dIt was after school. Ryuichi was walking down the streets with Shizuna when they spotted an old woman up ahead who\u2019d dropped her groceries\u2014some apples and oranges\u2014on the ground. She was slowly picking up the fruits, but of course, being an elderly person, there was no way she could pick them all up right away.\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201dWithout waiting for Shizuna\u2019s response, Ryuichi headed for the old lady. Shizuna looked at his back with a smile, and quickly followed suit.\u201cOh, hello there, kids.\u201d\u201c\u2018Sup, granny. Looks like you\u2019re in a pinch.\u201d\u201cFufu, let us help you.\u201dWith the addition of Ryuichi and Shizuna, the fruits dropped by the old lady were quickly picked up. Naturally, they were the only ones who tried to help the old lady; the other passersby only spared a glance at them and left without doing anything.\u201cThank you, you two.\u201dThe old lady had a laid-back tone and a somewhat soft atmosphere about her that made her seem like she\u2019d be well-liked if she had grandchildren. She seemed to be on her way to a nearby bus stop, so Ryuichi and Shizuna decided to accompany her.\u201cPutting you aside, young girl, you don\u2019t look like the kind person who would be helping others, young man.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, I do look like a delinquent.\u201d\u201cOh, are you saying you\u2019re different on the inside?\u201d\u201cNope, I\u2019m a total delinquent on the inside too.\u201d\u201cHahaha, I see, I see. You\u2019re one kind delinquent, aren\u2019tcha?\u201dThe old lady beckoned Ryuichi toward her. He cocked his head in confusion, but nonetheless made his way toward her. Once he got close, the old lady told him to sit next to her. He did as he was told and sat down, and the old lady started patting him on the head.\u201cGood boy, good boy.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not at the age for these kinds of things anymore, y\u2019know.\u201d\u201c\u2026Fufu.\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t have the heart to tell off an old lady and force her to stop, so he let her do as she pleased. Shizuna looked at him and muttered how cute he was. The old lady then took out her wallet and offered him a 1,000 yen bill as a token of gratitude.\u201cThis is my thanks for you.\u201dThe old lady must\u2019ve offered him the money with good intentions. However, he had no intention of accepting it from her, so he returned it and asked her to keep it for herself. Otherwise, the scene would have been a little bad. Seen from a distance, an old lady offering money to Ryuichi would look a whole lot like extortion.\u201cAlright, granny, take care on your way home.\u201d\u201cTake care, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cThank you, you two. Oh, right, are you two lovers perhaps?\u201dRyuichi and Shizuna looked at each other. They had a sexual relationship with each other, but that was clearly distinct from being lovers, and the most appropriate term at the moment that could be used to describe their relationship was 'sex friends\u201d. But there was no way they could straight up say that to the old lady, so they both shook their heads no.\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I think you two suit each other very well. Well, if you do become lovers, make sure to let this old granny know.\u201dAnd with that, the old lady got onto the bus. As she sat down and the bus started moving, the old lady waved her hand at Ryuichi and Shizuna. They waved back in response, and soon, the bus disappeared from sight.\u201cEven if she tells us to let her know, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be seeing her ever again.\u201d\u201cIn a way, she\u2019s a really strong old lady. Hey, Ryuichi, if we do meet her again, should we tell her we\u2019ve become lovers?\u201d\u201cWell, even if it\u2019s a lie, I guess it\u00a0would\u00a0make that old lady happy to hear.\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez, that\u2019s where you\u2019re supposed to say, \u2018Yes, we should.\u2019\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dRyuichi started walking before she could pursue the strange topic any further. Soon, Shizuna caught up with him and hugged his arm. Walking like this had become normal for Shizuna, and she no longer held the initial innocence she had had in the beginning. It was simply because being together like this had become the norm for her.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThis time it was Shizuna\u2019s turn to happen upon something. She stopped in her tracks, and when Ryuichi turned to where she was looking, he saw a woman walking with a shopping bag in her hand. The woman noticed Shizuna\u2019s gaze, then she looked at Ryuichi and her eyes widened in surprise.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Sohei-kun\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh.\u201dApparently, the woman was Sohei\u2019s mother. He had a feeling Sohei\u2019s mother had made a brief appearance in the manga, but the fact that he didn\u2019t remember her may have meant that she didn\u2019t have much of a role in the story. The woman slowly walked toward them.\u201cHello, Shizuna-chan.\u201d\u201cGood day to you, Natsume-san.\u201dThat would make this woman\u2019s full name Shinozaki Natsume. With a slightly chubby figure and kind eyes, her face certainly bore a slight resemblance to Sohei\u2019s. It was quite novel for Ryuichi to see the protagonist\u2019s family like this.\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you, Shizuna-chan.\u201d\u201cYes, it does. I haven\u2019t been coming over to your home these days, after all.\u201d\u201cIt does make me a little sad\u2026but I guess you\u2019re past that age now, huh.\u201dNatsume then turned her attention to Ryuichi. Unlike the affectionate look she had given Shizuna, the look she gave Ryuichi was somewhat suspicious.\u201cAnd who is this man?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my beloved person. You can even say he\u2019s the person I hold dearest to me.\u201dNatsume\u2019s suspicious gaze grew even more intense. As Sohei\u2019s mother, she was one of the people who had watched Shizuna grow up. She couldn\u2019t believe that that same Shizuna was now together with a man like Ryuichi. However, Natsume said absolutely nothing against Ryuichi, nor did she deny her words like the teachers at school.Natsume returned her gaze to Shizuna and continued speaking.\u201cSohei hasn\u2019t been looking too well these days. Might you have any ideas as to why, Shizuna-chan?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t really know. We haven\u2019t been talking much at school lately.\u201d\u201cI\u2026see. I thought you might\u2019ve known something since he always seems to be in a daze and spaced out, even at home.\u201dThe two people who represented the biggest causes for his condition were right there, but since Natsume didn\u2019t know the specifics of the situation, there was no need to explain to her in detail. Putting Ryuichi aside, Sohei was no longer anything but a childhood friend to Shizuna.\u201cIf that\u2019s all, Natsume-san, we\u2019re gonna get going now.\u201d\u201cAlright. See you later, Shizuna-chan.\u201dThus, the two of them parted with Natsume. As Shizuna and Natsume talked, he could sense an aura of not wanting to get too involved with Ryuichi from Natsume, but that was normal. Ryuichi started walking again with Shizuna, but he no longer thought anything of Natsume.\u201cOh, yeah. I\u2019m gonna be going to Satsuki\u2019s place this weekend. Wanna come too, Shizuna?\u201d\u201cIs it okay? I\u2019ve never really met Satsuki-san, though\u2026\u201d\u201cNah, I think it\u2019s totally fine. Satsuki\u2019s been talking about how she wants to meet you for a while now; plus, Chisa doesn\u2019t mind having you over, either.\u201d\u201cI see. Alright, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201dThus, it was decided that Shizuna would be participating as well. Ryuichi immediately contacted Satsuki, who replied that she would love to have her come. Chisa would also be happy to know that Shizuna was coming, but he put his phone away, deciding that he would make it as a surprise for her on that day.\u201cYou know what, I think I\u2019ll have a nice helping of you and Sakie today.\u201d\u201cKyaa\u2026 Oh, you. \u266a\u201dShizuna shrewdly made a troubled yet happy face when he hugged her shoulders a little tightly. Whenever she was touched by Ryuichi, her body would react by seeking him out. She would end up releasing pheromones that even wafted to those around her. Beautiful as she was, she would attract many gazes, and when her eyes became like they were now, that meant she could only see Ryuichi and Ryuichi alone.\u201cRyuichi-kun, can we try out something new today?\u201d\u201cSomething new?\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dWhat she meant by \u2018new\u2019 was something he would find out when he arrived at her house. He had been leisurely relaxing with Shizuna until Sakie came home. That was when she abruptly asked him to take a bath at their house today. He found it a hassle to heat up the water whenever he got home to shower, so he readily assented\u2026however, he wasn\u2019t the only one who would be in the bathroom.\u201cFufu, taking a bath together with Ryuichi-kun is a new experience, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIndeed it is. His body is so muscular. No matter how many times I gaze upon it, I find my heart beating furiously.\u201dShizuna and Sakie were with him, naked, with him right in the middle of the two. It seemed that the \u2018new\u2019 thing Shizuna was referring to was her entering the bath together with Ryuichi. Also, Sakie had been there when Shizuna made the proposal, so they ended up taking a bath along with her since she said she didn\u2019t want to be left out.Of course, it went without saying that it was\u00a0impossible\u00a0nothing would happen between them when they were like this\u2026and it would be some time until the three eventually left the bath.\u201cRyuichi-kun, did something happen between you and Shizuna?\u201d\u201cHuh? Why\u2019re you asking that so suddenly?\u201dSakie asked Ryuichi this question after they got out of the bath. However, even if he was asked that, he could only say that nothing special happened between them.\u201cI feel like the way you\u2019re looking at Shizuna today is kinder than usual. I can\u2019t really describe it well, but I just feel like it\u2019s different.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why I got curious to know if something happened between you two.\u201dAgain, he couldn\u2019t think of anything special, or so he thought, but what came back to his mind was the memory of the incident that took place during lunch break at school.\u201cEspecially if it\u2019s a person I care about.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis heart raced as he recalled Shizuna\u2019s words. He cocked his head at the unusual feeling that had been plaguing him ever since said lunch break. He was still unable to clearly recognize the feeling, but the time when he would was steadily growing closer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35There Are Times When He Feels LonelyTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cBye, bye, Ryuichi-kun. See you later.\u201d\u201cCome back anytime.\u201d\u201cYup. I\u2019ll be back for the good food and good women.\u201dWith those parting words, Ryuichi left Shizuna\u2019s home. Feeling the illusion of being thrown out of their warm atmosphere into a cold one, he realized that he was being changed by these women. It wasn\u2019t an unpleasant sensation, but rather one that made him want to immerse himself in it even more.\u201cYou watching this, you bastard of a mother? There was a time when I wanted this from you too.\u201dHe muttered without any sort of emotion. The more time he spent with Shizuna and the others these days, the more he felt the gap between his present and past memories. Once told by both his father and mother that he wasn\u2019t needed and that they didn\u2019t want to think of him as a son, Ryuichi had now been changed by the influence of others. What would his late parents think if they saw Ryuichi now, and what would they think if they saw the girls who were attracted to him\u2026?\u201cUgh, fuck it.\u201dHe spat those words and continued walking.There was no way anybody could\u2019ve noticed his mental turmoil. However, despite that, perhaps Shizuna had felt something as the door behind Ryuichi\u2019s back opened with a\u00a0bang.\u201cHuh?\u201dOf course, even Ryuichi was surprised as he turned around.\u201cWait, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cShizuna?\u201dShe walked out of the house. She then jumped straight into his chest and hugged him. Unlike Ryuichi, who was in his school uniform, she was in her pajamas without a jacket. Even though it was cold at night, her light outfit made him wonder if she was trying to catch a cold.\u201cSorry. I just wanted to do this for a bit.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dHe held her body tightly so that she wouldn\u2019t feel cold as she hugged him. Her body was supposed to be warm, but it was getting colder and colder because she was outside. Sakie was probably waiting for Shizuna with worry on the other side of the door.\u201cC\u2019mon, you better head back fast or else you\u2019ll get a cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right. Thank you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me for that.\u201dIn fact,\u00a0he\u00a0was the one who wanted to say thank you to her. He had been feeling a little sentimental about having to leave the warm place Shizuna and Sakie had given him and being thrown out into the cold outside. Her kindness permeated his heart and distracted him from that mood, even if only slightly\u2026and he was reminded once more that the person in front of him was someone very important to him.\u201cShizuna.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mmm.\u201dUnable to resist the urge, he stole her lips. She responded by putting her arms around his back. It was a light, pecking kiss, not the deep kind where they used their tongues. She looked regretful as their lips parted from each other, but knew that otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop herself from going further with him.\u201cI get really naughty when I\u2019m with you, don\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cHeh, isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m only a bad, naughty girl for you, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201cA bad girl, huh. Do you like that phrase that much?\u201d\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure. It does have a nice ring to it, though.\u201d\u201cOh really, now?\u201d Ryuichi remarked as he laughed. For some reason they didn\u2019t say anything more and just continued to stare at one another for a long time. Then, Shizuna gave a cute little sneeze.\u00a0See, what did I tell you?\u00a0He gave her a look of exasperation, but immediately put his hand on her back, since he was the one who had kissed her.\u201cThis is where we say goodbye for today. I\u2019ll c\u2019ya later, \u2018kay?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026okay. See you later.\u201dHe could tell her dilemma; she knew they had to part, but she didn\u2019t want to. As for Ryuichi, he wanted to think of this as a nice parting where they could just make plans for their next time without regrets\u2026and as such, he didn\u2019t really want to look at her expression then.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe put his hand on her back and pushed her toward the doorway, but he was somewhat reluctant to do so honestly. Something had changed in him; clearly sensing this, he clicked his tongue a little.\u201c\u2026Y\u2019know, I feel like even I\u2019ve changed. Like, completely, ever since I saved you.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun.\u201dHe removed his hand that was on her back and hugged her again, putting his arms around her stomach. It was tight and quite forceful, and her face contorted a bit in pain. But never did she say it hurt or that she didn\u2019t want to; her cheeks only turned red and she let out a sweet sigh.\u201cAight, I\u2019mma head home now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Okay, I understand.\u201d\u201cCome on, don\u2019t make such a sad face, please.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just going to miss you so much.\u201dHe gave a chuckle, thinking that he really wouldn\u2019t be able to go home at this rate. He quickly parted from Shizuna, and after making sure she entered the house, he started walking. He didn\u2019t feel like going straight home, so he decided to head into town.\u201cMan, it\u2019s always crowded here no matter when I visit.\u201dA city was fundamentally a place that would always be in full swing when nighttime arrived. Mornings and noons were spent with bated breath, and when nighttime finally came, it would begin to show its many colors and be filled with lots of noise. The people nearby would gather like a swarm of insects attracted by light, and drunken men would often be seen being solicited by various women.\u201cHey there, would you like to come to our place?\u201dAs he was looking around, a woman called out to him. The building behind her was a cheap-looking bar, but the menu posted at the entrance suggested that their prices were reasonable.\u201cI\u2019m a student, just so you know.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s ever stopped you, though?\u201d\u201cWell, true that.\u201dAlthough he was wearing a uniform, his appearance was clearly one of a man who liked to play around. Ryuichi couldn\u2019t talk for the woman who had deliberately called out to him despite knowing he was a student; however, he himself had no intentions of doing\u00a0that\u00a0with her. But, he did have a slight desire to tease her.\u201cWell, what about you? Would that stop you from sleeping with me there tonight?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 \u266a\u201dHe placed his hand on the shoulder of the woman dressed in a revealing outfit and pointed toward a love hotel.The woman seemed surprised for a moment, but then she looked at Ryuichi\u2019s face and her cheeks blushed. Perhaps if he kept pushing, she would follow him even though she was supposed to be soliciting him. Well, as he\u2019d said before, he had no intention of doing that with her at all, so he warned her against being swept away by a bratty juvenile like him and removed his hand from her.\u201cAhh\u2026 Hey, are you really a high school student? You\u2019ve got to be cosplaying, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhy would I be cosplaying in a uniform\u2026well, I guess there are some people who actually do that.\u201d\u201cBut your body is oozing so much sexiness that my female instincts are telling me to let you sweep me away, even if you\u2019re a high schooler.\u201d\u201cOh really? Well, that\u2019s flattering to hear.\u201dRyuichi started walking away from her just as she reached out for him. He bought a can of juice from a nearby vending machine and quenched his thirst. As he was drinking, Ryuichi suddenly had this thought.Come to think of it, I know my father\u2019s parents, but I don\u2019t know anything about my mother\u2019s.He hadn\u2019t given it much thought before, but now that he thought about it, he knew absolutely nothing about his mother\u2019s family. Well, it was possible that her family could have cut ties with her because she was such a bitch, or it was also possible that she could have cut ties with them herself because she was such a cunning woman.He was sure they were alive and well, just like his father\u2019s parents, but still, he shook his head and thought that it didn\u2019t matter to him at all. But at the same time, it loathed him to think that no matter how many years had passed, the memories of his childhood still clung to him.\u201c\u2026Even though I get it in my head, why do those assholes keep haunting me like this?\u201dRyuichi\u2019s parents were no longer with him. Even though it\u2019d been this way for years now, he could still vividly recall their faces and voices. It was a testament to just how much hatred and disappointment he felt toward them, but would a day ever come when he was freed from this curse?\u201cGuess I\u2019ll head home. We\u2019re all gonna gather at her place come this weekend anyways, so I\u2019ll just let loose then.\u201dRyuichi cackled conspicuously as he tossed his empty can in the trash and walked away.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dJust as he started moving his feet to return to his apartment, he saw a couple of parents with their child. It was a young boy walking hand in hand with his mother and father. All three of them were smiling, seemingly on their way home from a meal out. He was slightly envious of this warm scene of a family, which he himself had never had, but it did not make him feel bitter.You better not turn out like me.Although he never said it out loud, he muttered those words in his mind. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have glanced at him like that, since the boy turned his attention to Ryuichi and waved his hand at him. The boy\u2019s parents then hid him from Ryuichi, scolded him to stop, and then quickly strode away, not wanting to get involved with Ryuichi at all.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t turn into a delinquent like me in the future.\u201dHis words were tinged with a hint of melancholy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Chaos at the SleepoverTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cNice to meet you, my name is Rindo Shizuna.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too, I\u2019m Shirasagi Satsuki.\u201dOn the appointed weekend, Ryuichi arrived at the apartment where Satsuki was to live alone. And just as he\u2019d said beforehand, he brought Shizuna with him, which surprised Chisa.\u201cHey, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\u201cWanted to make it a surprise, y\u2019know? Definitely wasn\u2019t because I was too lazy to call you or anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026So basically, you were too lazy, huh.\u201dSeated to his side, Chisa let out a sigh. Meanwhile, Ryuichi looked at Shizuna and Satsuki, who were happily conversing with each other.\u00a0They\u2019re really close, huh,\u00a0he thought. They were getting along very well with each other even though they had only just met for the first time today.\u201cWell, those two\u2019ve got something in common, after all. As in, they were both saved by you, fucked by you, and charmed by you.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s all it takes for them to get all chummy with each other?\u201d\u201cWell, we\u00a0are\u00a0talking about those two.\u201dIs that how it is?\u00a0Ryuichi mused as he watched the two once more.\u201cAnd then, Ryuichi-kun saved me. That encounter with him changed me. \u266a\u201d\u201cMe, too. I regretted going to that club at first, but now I\u2019m glad I did because it brought me a wonderful encounter with Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dThe two of them were excitedly recounting how they met Ryuichi. As for Ryuichi, he couldn\u2019t help but avert his gaze at the topic that made his back itch. Then, his eyes landed on Chisa, who smiled amusedly at him.\u201cSo there are times when even you get embarrassed, huh. Not something you see everyday.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed; I\u2019m just feeling uncomfortable is all.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t anything particularly wrong in denying it. Still, Chisa stroked his head and said, \u201cI understand, I understand.\u201d Both of them were very flashy-looking, but Chisa, who was older than Ryuichi, definitely had a calmer and more mature air about her.\u201c\u2026You know, I think it\u2019s nice that you have that side to you. It\u2019s better if you show off your cute side more often rather than being so reclusive and intimidating like a wolf all the time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to intimidate anyone, though\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, your face is intimidating.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so rude, you know that?\u201dHe lightly smacked her shoulder.\u201cThat hurts, y\u2019know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for saying weird things.\u201dAgain, their exchange was more like that of a brother and sister than a man and a woman. Shizuna and Satsuki watched them with smiles on their faces. It was nighttime when they had all gathered together, so it was soon time for dinner.\u201cI did some discussing with Satsuki earlier and we decided on\u00a0shabu-shabu\u00a0today.\u201d\u201cOoh~. Hot damn.\u201dFor a meat lover like Ryuichi, the word\u00a0shabu-shabu\u00a0had a mouth-watering, luscious ring to it. Into a pot atop the table went vegetables, tofu, and other ingredients as well as meat. Today\u2019s gathering commemorated the beginning of Satsuki\u2019s life on her own, but for Ryuichi, it could be said that this very meal was the main event of the gathering.\u201cYou know\u2026you have three beautiful women gathered here with you, yet you have your eyes distracted by the meat?\u201d\u201cHah, looking at beautiful women ain\u2019t gonna fill my stomach.\u201d\u201cTrue enough,\u201d the three women agreed. When all of the ingredients had been cooked sufficiently and were ready to eat, Chisa opened her mouth, beer in hand.\u201cHere\u2019s to Satsuki beginning her life on her own!\u201dThus began the party of one man and three women. To an onlooker, one tough-looking man and three beautiful women of different types surrounding a table would definitely look like a bunch of waiters entertaining a customer.\u201cWatching Ryuichi-kun eating so heartily is such a nice feeling.\u201d\u201cIndeed it is. Ryuichi-kun, we\u2019ve still got a ton more meat, okay?\u201dApart from Chisa who was drinking her beer at a frightening rate, Shizuna and Satsuki were staring at Ryuichi who kept on eating. Ryuichi felt uncomfortable being stared at while he ate, but he couldn\u2019t stop eating, either, so in the end, he prioritized eating over addressing them.\u201c\u2026Geez, you really do put meat over us.\u201d\u201cThis again\u2026? But well, I\u2019ll admit this space we got going on here ain\u2019t too bad, y\u2019know? All three of you are pretty high-leveled girls, whether it be Shizuna, Chisa, or Satsuki. That\u2019s why any meal I have with you girls tastes incredible.\u201dThose were Ryuichi\u2019s heartfelt words. Well, seeing him say that without even bothering to stop eating stupefied Chisa, but she immediately giggled happily. It seemed she was happy hearing him praise her feminine side as well.\u201cI love seeing you eat a lot, you know? That\u2019s why I want to cook so many things for you, too, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cMan, I might not be able to live without you anymore. You\u2019re seriously that good of a cook.\u201d\u201cReally? Then I\u2019ll cook for you for the rest of my life. \u266a\u201dGive them the slightest of opportunities, and they would start conversing like a married couple. Their exchange was so harmonious and picturesque owing to the fact that they were of the same age. And perhaps more importantly, it was because Shizuna was the one who could venture the deepest into Ryuichi\u2019s heart.\u201c\u2026Really is nice to see, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYup. Makes me a little jealous.\u201dChisa and Satsuki looked at Shizuna enviously, seemingly aware of this fact as well. Shizuna had a truly beautiful presence when she smiled in front of Ryuichi. She always put him first in any situation, trusted him unconditionally, and had the resolve to rely on him immediately if something happened. While being strong was certainly ideal, sometimes weakness could also be a great source of charm.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes were wide in confusion seeing Chisa and Satsuki staring at her. Her lovable appearance made Chisa put her can of beer down and embrace her.\u201cShizuna-chan, you\u2019re so cute. Will you be my wife?\u201d\u201cWife?!\u201dIncidentally, Ryuichi did not miss the fact that Shizuna\u2019s face contorted at the smell of alcohol the moment she was hugged by Chisa. It hadn\u2019t been that long since she started drinking, but she had already drunk quite the amount. It wasn\u2019t surprising then, that Shizuna would think she smelled bad when she was hugged.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ahaha.\u201d\u201cShe reeks\u2026doesn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0Sob.\u201dIt looked like Satsuki had the same thought. Although apologetic, she left the alcohol-stenched woman in Shizuna\u2019s hands, since Ryuichi had a question he wanted to ask her.\u201cHow have things been since then?\u201d\u201cSince then\u2026? Oh, Akira? I\u2019ve been getting a ton of calls from him. I haven\u2019t been answering them, though.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026isn\u2019t he totally becoming stalker-like?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely very creepy. But I think I\u2019ll be okay here.\u201dRyuichi let out a sigh, thinking that she still had to be on her guard since one wrong move and she could be in serious trouble.\u201cI\u2019m just gonna say, you have to be careful, okay?\u201d\u201cI know. I didn\u2019t tell him where I moved to. I\u2019m not going to see him again until he cools down.\u201d\u201cStill. Make sure you call me straight away if you feel anything off; don\u2019t tell me when it\u2019s already happened, cos then it\u2019d be too late.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2026 Okay. \u266a\u201dAlthough she had said that she would be okay, she must\u2019ve still been feeling somewhat anxious. Ryuichi\u2019s words, though not completely, seemed to have helped alleviate said anxiety.\u201cWe still have plenty of meat and tofu in the pot. Here you go.\u201d\u201cAh, thanks.\u201dHe received an extra serving from Satsuki and resumed eating once more. He chucked a piece of tofu into his mouth, but quickly downed a cup of barley tea since it seemed to have been hotter than he\u2019d expected. Seeing this, Satsuki\u2019s shoulders trembled and she laughed, perhaps because she\u2019d had a slight premonition of it beforehand.\u201cThe\u00a0shabu-shabu\u00a0isn\u2019t going anywhere, so take your time and eat it slowly, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dTheir exchange was completely like that of an older woman and a younger boy. Just as Ryuichi was eating his meal wholeheartedly, Shizuna\u2019s shout echoed through the room.\u201cR-Ryuichi-kun~~~!!\u201d\u201cHuh? \u2026Ohh~.\u201dChisa was planting kisses on Shizuna\u2019s cheek. Shizuna, who was under attack by the onslaught of booze-stenched kisses, was reaching her hand out to Ryuichi and Satsuki for help. Satsuki, compelled to help her, made her way for Chisa, but it seemed that this made her Chisa\u2019s target instead.\u201cSatsukiii! It\u2019s your turn now!\u201d\u201cHuh? Whaaaaaat?!\u201dSatsuki was sacrificed, taking the place of the now-freed Shizuna. Shizuna, looking exhausted, took refuge by Ryuichi\u2019s side and breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cThat was horrible\u2026\u201d\u201cGood job surviving that. Chisa\u2019s a pain in the ass whenever she\u2019s drunk.\u201d\u201cWho are you calling a pain in the ass?!\u201d\u201cC-Chisa-san, this is embarrassing!\u201dSatsuki had the biggest breasts of the three, and they were currently being fondled by Chisa. She\u2019d completely turned into a perverted old man, and Ryuichi remarked to himself that this was what made her a pain in the ass.\u201cShizuna, you haven\u2019t had much to eat yet, have you?\u201d\u201cNo, not really. Alright, it\u2019s time for me to eat a lot, too!!\u201d\u201cSatsuki\u2019s boobs are huge. These puppies are way past \u2018big\u2019 and entering \u2018massive\u2019 territory\u2026 They\u2019re just so big. What cups are these?\u201d\u201cP-Please stop\u2026 Uwah?!\u201dThe two beauties got entangled with each other in front of Ryuichi and Shizuna, who were eating their\u00a0shabu-shabu\u00a0quietly. Ryuichi continued to stuff his mouth full of meat without paying any particular attention to them, to say nothing of Shizuna.After dinner time was over, Shizuna and Satsuki headed for the bath, leaving behind Chisa who had passed out due to the alcohol.Since they had decided to sleepover at Satsuki\u2019s place today instead of going home, Ryuichi would be borrowing her bath later as well.\u201cSheesh, what a chaotic night this was, huh\u2026but it wasn\u2019t bad.\u201dIt was loud, but fun, that\u2019s for sure. He decided to close out the day by helping himself to the best\u00a0desserts\u00a0possible before having a good night\u2019s sleep. However, it was at that moment that Ryuichi received a call on his phone.\u201cWho is it?\u201dWhen he grabbed his phone and looked at the screen, he saw the name of his shitty old man.\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201dHe conspicuously clicked his tongue and, phone in hand, headed for the front door. Chisa, who had awoken at some point, was staring intently at his retreating back.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Ryuichi Sheds Tears for the First Time in a Long TimeTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi went outside and picked up the call. To him, his paternal grandfather wasn\u2019t a warm, amiable person, but rather an insignificant person who had always been indifferent to him. There may have been a world in which Ryuichi would have been adored as a grandchild, but at least in this world, he had no family that adored him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dRyuichi\u2019s grandfather wasn\u2019t saying anything at all. Ryuichi couldn\u2019t understand why he was so silent because he would never bother to call him unless he had something to say, and more importantly, because he only called whenever he wired money to his account.\u201cI got a call from your school today. From a teacher called Hamasaki.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201dRyuichi clicked his tongue at the mention of Hamasaki\u2019s name, as he knew that this was going to be a troublesome situation. It had only been a few days ago that he witnessed Hamasaki talking with Shizuna during lunch break. He wondered if it might have been about that, and sure enough, it looked like he was spot-on.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally\u2026no, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve heard from school about you. It just goes to show that, in the end, you are that woman\u2019s son after all.\u201d\u201cHah, you talkin\u2019 about me having relationships with women? That\u2019s normal for high schoolers.\u201dRyuichi spat those words at him. Being a high school student, it was nothing out of the ordinary to be having relationships with the opposite sex. To think that this was what he had to say after not calling him for so long; it was insignificant to Ryuichi all the same.\u201cI know I can\u2019t cut ties with you, but it\u2019s so relieving I don\u2019t have to see your face. Because when I do, I remember that woman\u2019s face.\u201dThat makes the two of us,\u00a0Ryuichi muttered in his mind. He knew that his grandfather disliked him, and he had long passed the stage where it would hurt him to hear his grandfather say such words. However, today, his grandfather finally used strong words directly against him, as if he had reached the end of his patience.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEven so, Ryuichi still felt nothing. However, he didn\u2019t like the fact that he was constantly being told what to do because he was already an adolescent in puberty at the age of 17.\u201cI\u2019m your son\u2019s kid, too, y\u2019know? The way I see it, he\u2019s just as much of an asshole as that shitty woman was.\u201dNo sooner had those words left Ryuichi\u2019s mouth than a loud voice filled with indignation rang out from the other end of the phone.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare lump my son in with people like you! In the first place, if it weren\u2019t for you people, my son\u2026my son!\u00a0Cough! Cough!\u201dHe started coughing painfully, probably because he\u2019d raised his voice so loudly. It was so bad that Ryuichi almost subconsciously asked him if he was okay. However, in the end, he said nothing to him\u2026 Of course he wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0Why should I have to do something like that for him?\u00a0he thought to himself.\u201cHah\u2026 Hah\u2026 Hah! You know what, Ryuichi? You are a child with the blood of that bitch. Your very existence was tormenting my son! That is your sin!\u201d\u201cTch\u2026\u201dIt was as if he had implied that Ryuichi\u2019s very existence was a sin. He looked up at the sky as he listened to the voice on the other end of the phone. The sky was beautiful and starry, the exact opposite of the darkness that Ryuichi had come to know as a child.\u2026Shut up\u2026 Shut up, shut up, shut up!If he\u2019d only been told that he was hated, that he was unwanted, he could brush it off as a slight disturbance in his mind. However, being denied the very fact that he was born would undoubtedly nag on his heart. Because of what his mother and father had said to him, words denying his existence were engraved as a curse in the deepest part of Ryuichi\u2019s heart.\u201cI don\u2019t want to think of you as my son.\u201d\u201cYou ain\u2019t no son of mine.\u201dHe impulsively tried to cut the call.\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dBut before he could hang up, Chisa, who had gotten behind him at some point, gently took the phone from him.\u201cChisa\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201dThen, she hugged him in her embrace. As he slowly let the strength leave his body, he dropped to his knees and buried his face in her chest. She reeked of booze, but coupled with her nice scent, it put Ryuichi\u2019s mind at ease.\u201cSorry for the abruptness, but good evening. You must be Ryuichi\u2019s grandfather, right?\u201dWhat on earth is she going to talk about?\u00a0he thought, but he couldn\u2019t move at all. It wasn\u2019t that he was interested in what they were going to talk about; Chisa\u2019s atmosphere just made it impossible for him to interrupt her. With the sensation of Chisa\u2019s breasts on his face, he listened intently to their conversation.\u201cHuh? The woman Ryuichi\u2019s messing around with\u2026you said? Well, you aren\u2019t exactly wrong~.\u201dUnlike her usual self, Chisa was speaking in a way that seemed to poke fun at the other party, which was rare. Since the phone was leaking his voice to some extent, he could hear his grandfather\u2019s voice echo clearly with even more fury at Chisa\u2019s appearance.\u201cHey, gramps. I know this is sudden, but there\u2019s this very nice boy I know. His name is Shishido Ryuichi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHer hand was on Ryuichi\u2019s head, stroking it gently. It was like a mother calming her child, or a sister calming her brother. Of course, he didn\u2019t know what those two actually felt like, but he could somehow tell.\u201cHe\u2019s great at handling girls, and he\u2019s great at pleasuring them, too. And I\u2019m not the only one; there are other girls besides me who are also deeply in love with him. Oh, that\u2019s right; please listen closely. Did you know that Ryuichi saved two girls from trouble? He saved them from some nasty men.\u201dThose two girls were likely referring to Shizuna and Satsuki.\u201cThere are girls who have been saved by him, charmed by him, and are now involving themselves with him. In this world where so many people don\u2019t even try to talk to or help others no matter how much trouble they are in, Ryuichi is undeniably saving them.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d he could hear his grandfather say. He didn\u2019t know what Chisa was trying to say, and he seemed to be irritated that she was talking about something unimportant.\u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s an incredible boy? I\u2019ve heard that there are fathers out there who don\u2019t care about their own sons and wish they were never born. I don\u2019t mean to compare you with those people, but don\u2019t you think a gentle boy like Ryuichi is such a wonderful child compared to those people?\u201dChisa\u2019s face was all smiles the entire time. However, the next face she adopted was filled with anger. Although Ryuichi couldn\u2019t see it, Chisa was definitely angry.\u201cWell, whatever the old Ryuichi used to be, he\u2019s a changed boy now. He\u2019s younger than me, but he\u2019s extremely dependable, and he\u2019s a really good kid, that Ryuichi.\u201dChisa then paused briefly before continuing in a harsher tone.\u201cWho do you think that shitty father I talked about earlier is? \u2026I see, so you don\u2019t know? I\u2019m talking about\u00a0your\u00a0son, you shithead.\u201d\u201cH-Hey\u2026\u201dChisa\u2019s words didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cRyuichi has the kindness to help people, the heart to love people, and the open-mindedness to make people happy. Ryuichi has what your son didn\u2019t have. Your son did not love Ryuichi, did not help him, and did not make him happy!\u3000The Ryuichi now has something important that your son never had!\u201d\u201cBe quiet! You\u2019re just another slutty bitch; that\u2019s all you are! You\u2019re no better than that whore who stole my son\u2019s happiness! The words of a piece of trash like you mean nothing to me!\u201dThis time, Ryuichi heard his grandfather\u2019s voice, loud and clear. It was so loud that he wanted to tell him that if he were any louder, he would start coughing like he did before.\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about what you have to say about me, you old fucker. Whatever, me and Ryuichi have nothing more to say to you. Still, let me tell you one thing.\u201dChisa looked at Ryuichi. Her eyes reflected the image of Ryuichi alone, and they were filled with tenderness. She took a quiet, deep breath and continued with what would be her last words for his grandfather.\u201cRyuichi is wanted by us. We want Ryuichi. He is absolutely\u00a0not\u00a0an unwanted existence to us; to us, he is somebody irreplaceable.\u201d\u201c\u2014gh?!\u201dA crack appeared in the darkness that had covered his heart. He noticed that his eyes were growing hot, but he was still too stunned to put his hands on his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll say it time and time again. Ryuichi is\u00a0not\u00a0an unwanted existence to us; if you all deny him, then we will affirm him. He is, to us, a very important person, and it will stay that way forever.\u201dAnd with that, she ended the call.\u201c\u2026Oh my, fufu\u2026 It\u2019s okay, Ryuichi. I know I may have gone a little overboard, but I think it\u2019s for the best that I said all that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dPerhaps because they\u2019d been on the call for quite a long time, Shizuna and Satsuki were also gazing at them worriedly. Chisa separated her body from Ryuichi\u2019s, and because of that, Ryuichi\u2019s expression was exposed. Shizuna rushed to Ryuichi\u2019s side before anybody else.\u201c\u2026Sniff\u2026 Damn, how long has it been since I\u2019ve\u00a0cried?\u201dRyuichi cried for the first time in a long time, as if something was overflowing from his now full heart. The events just now would likely cause the relationship between Ryuichi and his grandfather to be irreparable, but their relationship was never one that seemed repairable in the first place, anyways.But Ryuichi was willing to accept that. Even if they denied him, Ryuichi would still have people beside him who would affirm him and want him. Not just these girls, but his other friends as well.\u201cRyuichi-kun, we\u2019ll always be by your side. So please don\u2019t cry.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to cry. I don\u2019t want to, but I just can\u2019t stop the tears from coming.\u201dRyuichi forced a smile. Looking at Shizuna, Chisa, and Satsuki in turn, he continued.\u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201dIt was a short word of thanks, but his feelings reached them properly. The sky was a starry one, but now Ryuichi\u2019s heart would be clear of the darkness as well. There was no need for him to envy it anymore, for his heart was now covered with light and beginning to shine, too.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38A New Outlook and a PromiseTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was the next day. Ryuichi thought back to last night\u2019s conversation, which he wasn\u2019t even sure could be called a farewell to his grandfather.\u201c\u2026I sure as hell won\u2019t be getting my living expenses anymore after that shitshow.\u201dHis head was still rousing from its slumber, but he quickly snapped awake when he thought about what he was going to do from now on.After an exchange like that, it would be best to assume that the money he had been receiving until now would be stopped. Of course, he did have some money in his savings. An older woman whom he had slept with in the past had given him money as a thank-you for satisfying her.\u201cI\u2019ve never really used them, so I\u2019ve still got some left to spare. Plus\u2026\u201dIf push came to shove, he could always just drop out of school and start working. Well, considering his circumstances, it may be a thorny path, but since the manager of the club and bar told him to tell them if he was in any kind of trouble, he thought it might be a good idea to have them employ him for work.\u201cZzz\u2026\u00a0Ryuichi-kun\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m his\u2026number one\u2026\u266a\u201dThere were two kinds of sleep-talking coming from his sides: one cute and one stupid. On his left was Shizuna, asleep while hugging his arm, and on his right was a dumb-looking Chisa, whose pajamas were rolled up, showing her belly.\u201c\u2026Geez, Shizuna is one thing, but you\u2019re gonna catch a cold like that.\u201dHe slowly removed his arm from the clutches of Shizuna and went to Chisa to straighten her pajamas. There was no sign of the older-sisterly side she\u2019d shown him yesterday, the one that put him at ease. She still seemed to be cold, perhaps because it was morning, so she held the blankets close to her and stayed like that.\u201cSatsuki\u2026must be in the living room, huh.\u201dThe four of them had slept together in this room, Satsuki\u2019s bedroom, yesterday. Seeing that she wasn\u2019t here, she must already be awake, so he left the bedroom and headed for the living room.\u201cAh, good morning, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cMorning, Satsuki. Looks like you\u2019re the first to be up.\u201d\u201cYes. The three of you were sleeping so soundly, I didn\u2019t want to wake you guys up.\u201d\u201cHeh, well, one of us was definitely out like a baby.\u201dSatsuki, having inferred who he was referring to, put her hand over her mouth and laughed.\u201cGeez, that\u2019s mean of you, Ryuichi-kun. Don\u2019t you think her sleeping face is really cute?\u201d\u201cWell, sure, I\u2019ll give her that. She\u2019s\u2026a really nice big sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201dRyuichi sat down on a chair and said this with a laugh. Satsuki, also remembering what had happened yesterday, immediately approached him. She then grasped his hand with both of hers.\u201c\u2026I can confidently say that my father and mother love me. So I can\u2019t understand or sympathize with all of your suffering. But what I can do is ease that suffering and give you peace of mind as much as I can.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, I know things turned out the way they did yesterday, but I don\u2019t have any more grievances about that, y\u2019know? In fact, I\u2019d say my heart is feeling pretty bright and clear.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t lying when he said that. To him, there were traumatic words that had been said to him for so long; words which also lied in the darkest parts of his heart.\u201cYou are unwanted.\u201d\u201cI wish you were never born.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to think of you as my son.\u201dWords like those\u2014words that denied his existence itself\u2014had planted a permanent wound in his heart. Some might say, \u201cIt\u2019s in the past, don\u2019t worry about it anymore,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re being a hung-up crybaby by constantly dwelling on it.\u201d But for Ryuichi, those words were a curse that had hurt him as a young boy and had been eating away at him for a long time.\u201cWe will affirm him. We want him.\u201dHe recalled Chisa\u2019s words yesterday. He had never known the joy of being needed and wanted by someone like that. He cried with joy for the first time yesterday.That very moment, his heart, which had been permeated by warmth at the hands of Shizuna, was cleared of its remaining pitch-black darkness by Chisa\u2019s words and feelings.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve been thinking about how important it really is to connect with people. I ended up venting my hatred for that bitch indirectly whenever I slept with women. But these days, I\u2019ve had a lot of time to do some thinking\u2026and I realized how connecting with others really saved me.\u201dRyuichi had regained his memories about this world, and while it did not fundamentally change him, it\u00a0did\u00a0change the way he thought about it. In the original manga world, Ryuichi had only thought of women as objects until the very end, but one could tell by looking at him that he was different now.\u201cBut putting that aside, are\u00a0you\u00a0okay after yesterday? I kinda feel like I pushed you too hard even though it was only your second time.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Fufu, don\u2019t worry about me. But I was really surprised, you know? Even though there were three of us, how did you manage to handle us so well?\u201d\u201cAh~\u2026 Well, I guess you could say that\u2019s my one redeeming feature?\u201d\u201cFufu, how manly and wonderful. \u266a\u201dI don\u2019t know if you can call that \u2018wonderful\u2019, though.\u00a0Ryuichi gave a wry smile. This was something that surprised even Ryuichi himself, but the lust and sexual desire that his body possessed was truly tremendous. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he went around fucking like a monkey, but once his switch was turned on, he would aggressively take the initiative, regardless of whether he was handling three girls.This body is so out of the ordinary in so many ways. Not trying to brag or anything, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine anything like this in my previous life.Ryuichi once again shivered at the high specs of his own body.\u00a0But man,\u00a0he thought as he eyed Satsuki from head to toe.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201dShe was dressed in a white knit short-sleeved top and a black skirt below. Her two breasts, which were larger than even Shizuna\u2019s and Chisa\u2019s, exuded a tremendous sex appeal even while covered by her clothes. He could certainly understand why Akira had gone crazy, seeing as he had had such a sexy sister by his side 24/7. He gave a bitter smile at the thought.\u201cYou have a really sexy body, Satsuki.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hnng. \u266a\u266a\u201dHis words were much too direct and lacking delicacy, but she smiled happily nonetheless with a slight blush on her cheeks.\u201cIt makes me sick when other men or my brother talk to me like that, but hearing that from you makes me so happy.\u201d\u201cIf words are all you want, I\u2019ll tell \u2018em to you as much as you want.\u201d\u201cThat makes me happy to hear. It truly delights me to be told that by someone who\u2019s attracted to not just my body, but my heart as well. \u266a\u201dAt times like these, Ryuichi always wondered how such nice women like her had gathered around a guy like him. It was a bad habit of his to think like that even though these women had told him themselves that they were attracted to him and wanted to be by his side.\u201cI was really happy when you came to my place yesterday, Ryuichi-kun. You even let me meet Shizuna-chan, and now I\u2019ve made a new friend in her.\u201d\u201cI see. If that\u2019s what you say, I\u2019ll make sure to come back sometime. You won\u2019t mind if I come over for some\u00a0private\u00a0business, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. You\u2019re more than welcome for that. \u266a\u201dShe kissed him on the cheek, seemingly relaying her expectations for when that time would arrive.The group stayed at her house until late afternoon before they split up.Chisa said she wanted to stick around a little longer before heading home, which Satsuki allowed. Even though they had met through Ryuichi, it seemed both of them had already become good friends.\u201cBye-bye, you two.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s meet again sometime, Chisa-san, Satsuki-san.\u201d\u201cFor sure. See you guys later.\u201d\u201cPlease do come back again. \u266a\u201dAs they exchanged farewells, Ryuichi turned to Chisa.\u201cSeriously, thanks a lot for yesterday.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? As someone who knows you, it\u2019s only natural that I said what I did.\u201dRyuichi and Chisa looked at each other for a while, grinned, then high-fived each other. He then left the apartment with Shizuna.\u201c\u2026That was a really nice get-together.\u201d\u201cI agree. I\u2019m happy to have met Satsuki-san, and finding out just how strong Chisa-san\u2019s feelings are for you makes mine even stronger, too.\u201dShizuna hugged his arm as she spoke. Through yesterday\u2019s events, Ryuichi\u2019s outlook on life had strengthened once more, as had his feelings for the girls. Among them, it was Shizuna who melted his heart the most.\u201c\u2026Say, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDo you wanna go on a trip somewhere faraway for our next holiday?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\u201cOh, alrighty.\u201d\u201cGuh\u2026\u201dSuddenly, she looked down. When he asked her what was wrong, she answered with this.\u201cWell\u2026your smile was just so beautiful\u2026that it made my heart beat a mile a minute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe hadn\u2019t intended for himself to be so conscious of it, but apparently the change in Ryuichi\u2019s state of mind was clearly and blatantly apparent.And so, as the two made plans to go out together, Shizuna\u2019s house came into view.\u201cSee you later, Shizuna. Next time, we\u2019ll be going out on that trip together.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be looking forward to it. \u266a\u201dHe watched her back as they exchanged these words. As he gazed at her back, he thought about how much he\u2019d enjoyed these past few days, and at the same time, he also felt a little sadness at having to part like this.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Shizuna Will Always Be by His SideTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrThe change in Ryuichi\u2019s mental state showed itself in a clear, tangible manner. It happened a few days after he\u2019d gone to stay at Satsuki\u2019s house, on a certain day after school.\u201cUgh\u2026this isn\u2019t good. I\u2019m going to be late at this rate.\u201dA female teacher passed by Ryuichi as he and Shizuna were about to head home. She was carrying a large cardboard box and her expression was very troubled and anxious.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Someya-sensei?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe was a music teacher known as Someya, and she was quite young amongst the school\u2019s teaching staff and quite popular amongst the students; her black-rimmed glasses served as her defining trademark.\u201cOh, hello, Rindo-san\u2026and Shishido-kun.\u201dShe furrowed her brows when she looked at Ryuichi. The way she looked at him gave off a similar vibe to Hamasaki\u2019s, and it put Shizuna, to say nothing of Ryuichi, in a bad mood straight away. Still, she did not take the bait and pulled on his hand, anxiously urging him to leave quickly.\u201cWait, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHe approached Someya. He may not have been that terrifying a delinquent to be feared by others at school, but when he approached her, Someya naturally stepped back a little.\u201cW-What is it?\u201dThat sharp, cutting glare of hers was definitely something that shouldn\u2019t have been directed at a student. Still, he paid no heed to it and took the cardboard box that she was holding in her hand as if to snatch it away from her.\u201cWhere do you want this?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking where you want me to put this.\u201d\u201cT-The audiovisual room\u2026\u201d\u201cGot it. Is this all?\u201d\u201cErr\u2026there\u2019s actually eight more boxes like that one.\u201dNow that he was holding the box, he realized that what was inside was probably some kind of paper, but it was considerably heavy nonetheless. It would\u2019ve been quite tiring for a woman to carry, and with eight more of them, she would\u2019ve had to make at least nine trips back and forth.\u201c\u2026Shizuna, could you gimme a hand?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d\u201cYou guys?\u201dHer expression of vigilance toward Ryuichi changed into a blank, dumb one.\u201cYou look like you\u2019re in some kind of hurry. You\u2019ve probably got something to do, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cUh, yes. You see, my father is hospitalized. So, I was going to make time for a visit today, but I still have these to carry.\u201d\u201cAll the more reason why you should leave it to us and get the hell outta here, then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHer eyes widened even further as she stared at Ryuichi. He urged her along, telling her that she had no time to be stuck in a daze. He then carried the cardboard box in his hands toward the audiovisual room. Unexpectedly, however, the door was locked, so he decided to trust in the miracle that Shizuna would somehow bring it along with her.\u201cAh, I knew we would need the key.\u201d\u201cGreat job. Sheesh, Someya would\u2019ve had to make another round trip just to go get it, huh.\u201dWith a giggle, Shizuna put down her cardboard box and unlocked the door. She went straight in and placed her box in an open spot, then headed back out to bring the rest of the boxes. On the way, she glanced back at Ryuichi and spoke.\u201cSomeya-sensei must\u2019ve been surprised. I kinda snapped when she\u2019d told me you must\u2019ve been up to something, and I told her that you weren\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d\u201cYou snapped, huh.\u201dHe gave a chuckle. Well, he\u00a0had\u00a0expected her to have that kind of conversation with Someya. His guess was spot-on, so he didn\u2019t think much of it, but he had to say, the way she responded was very much typical of her in a sense.\u201cY\u2019know, I wasn\u2019t really trying to improve my image back there, not after all this time. I just did that because, well, I wanted to.\u201d\u201c\u2026I really love that part about you.\u201d\u201cHeh, thank ya.\u201d\u201cOf course, I love all the other parts about you, too. \u266a\u201dShe confessed her love for him as Ryuichi carried the boxes in Someya\u2019s stead. Just as they were down to the remaining three boxes, Shizuna started panting exhaustedly, and she lightly swung her arms around, perhaps sore in pain.\u201cIt must be tough on you, huh. There are even stairs in between\u2026 Sorry for asking you to give me a hand; you can just stop here, okay?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to help you until the very end.\u201dShe tightly clenched her fists, seemingly pumped up. He wondered if he should tire her out any further, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t back down even if he tried to stop her seeing as she was so enthusiastic about it, so he decided to let her help him.\u201cI\u2019ll hold one, then you stack another one on top of it.\u201d\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d\u201cTotally. In fact, we probably should\u2019ve been doing this from the start.\u201dFirst, he picked up a box. Then, she placed another one on top of it. With Shizuna carrying the last one, their work would soon be over. Whilst worrying over Shizuna who was still breathing painfully, they finally managed to finish the job.\u201c\u2026Phew\u2026 Haah, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d\u201cGreat job. You really did well.\u201dWhen he patted her head, she shyly moved away from him.\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m sweating a little on my back right now, so I might smell weird.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. Does it look like I care?\u201d\u201cAh. \u266a\u201dAt first glance, it didn\u2019t look like she was sweating, but sure enough, he could see she was sweating to some extent on the inside of her clothes. Since he didn\u2019t mind, he brought his face close to her neck. He smelled her scent, which seemed to make her shy but squeal with delight nonetheless. The smell of sweat wasn\u2019t present, and what tickled Ryuichi\u2019s nostrils was the sweet scent of her body.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a nice smell. I like it.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dHe wondered how she must\u2019ve felt inside, being pushed up to the wall and having his face up her neck like this. He enjoyed her scent to his heart\u2019s content for a while longer before calling it quits and leaving the audiovisual room.It was already 4:30, so it seemed they probably wouldn\u2019t have the time to go anywhere.\u201cAight, lemme send you off.\u201d\u201cYup. Please, and thank you.\u201dFor Ryuichi, and for Shizuna too, it had become the norm for them to do this. As they left the school building and headed for the school gate, a member of the baseball team seemed to be just returning from a run outside. They discreetly exited the school gate so as to not disturb them, when Hamasaki appeared in front of the two.\u201cRindo\u2026and Shishido.\u201dHe was looking at Ryuichi and Shizuna in a completely different way. They did not give any sort of response at all. Shizuna walked with Ryuichi\u2019s arm in hers as if to say, \u201cLet\u2019s get home quickly,\u201d and of course, Hamasaki spoke to their backs as they walked.\u201cI spoke to your grandfather, Shishido, and he didn\u2019t seem to be very approving of your actions.\u201dRyuichi stopped, though his back was still turned. As Shizuna looked up at him with concern, he reassured her that he was fine with a mutter and opened his mouth.\u201cThanks to that, I managed to talk about a ton of things with him. Well, as a result, it did help me take a step forward, for better or worse. So, I do have to thank you for that, I guess.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026what even is that?\u201dHe started walking away with nothing more to say. Hamasaki, perhaps still unsatisfied, continued to speak further. This time, it wasn\u2019t to Ryuichi but to Shizuna.\u201cRindo, I\u2019m really concerned for you as your teacher. I\u2019ll be talking to your mother next. About her daughter having a dangerous relationship.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201dIt was then that Ryuichi heard Shizuna click her tongue for the first time. He, who was nearby, could hear it, but Hamasaki on the other hand couldn\u2019t\u2026 However, Ryuichi was surprised by the fact that Shizuna had actually clicked her tongue.\u201cSo even you click your tongue, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m a human, too. Of course I get annoyed.\u201dAnd with that, she turned around.\u201cGo ahead, do as you please. You\u2019re more than welcome to try your hand at something pointless.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it definitely\u00a0does\u00a0sound like it\u2019d be pointless.\u201dRyuichi could only say that because he knew Sakie. Shizuna looked forward as if she did not want to see his face, and this time Ryuichi pulled her along as they went on their way.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s so frustrating.\u201dRyuichi knew what she was talking about. It was no use worrying about such things, but he could understand her feelings because he knew that she was thinking about him a lot.Though he knew it was impossible, if Ryuichi were the honor student and Shizuna were the delinquent, he would have thought the exact same thing with their relationship as it was.\u201cI\u2019m just happy enough to have you girls who know me by my side.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then that means I\u2019ll have to stay by your side forever. Mark my words, Ryuichi-kun: I\u2019ll always be there for you and illuminate your heart.\u201d\u201cYup. Thank you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cFufu, you\u2019re welcome. Hey, Ryuichi-kun, I know it\u2019s a little late to go into town now, but I\u2019m in the mood to have some food!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go grab a hamburger then.\u201d\u201cUrk\u2026 Alright! The calories aren\u2019t going to be pretty, but I\u2019ll eat it!\u201dRyuichi smiled broadly, saying that that wouldn\u2019t bother him at all. If he had to say, Shizuna was the kind of girl whose fat went to their breasts and not their belly. Well, he didn\u2019t know if it was because of the food or not, but she also mentioned how her breasts had gotten a little bit bigger ever since she started hanging out with Ryuichi.\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout it. Well, don\u2019t get\u00a0too\u00a0fat until you\u2019re round as a ball, though.\u201d\u201cO-Obviously I wouldn\u2019t want that either!\u201dThus, they headed into town together as if to forget their unpleasant exchange earlier. Incidentally, Someya thanked Ryuichi and Shizuna quite graciously on a later date. Ryuichi told her not to worry about it, but this time, he didn\u2019t feel any unpleasant or hostile glances from Someya.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Change Within The ClassroomTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was June, the time of year when the weather was gradually getting warmer, with the summer season just around the corner.Almost a month had passed since that day at Satsuki\u2019s house, and some things had changed for Ryuichi.\u201cGood morning, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHey. Morning, Shizuna.\u201dEntering the month of June usually meant a change of outfit, but since it was still a little chilly at times, Shizuna was still wearing her jacket. As for Ryuichi, he was no longer wearing a jacket and was completely in his summer wear.\u201c\u2026Your muscles are just so amazing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you said the same thing yesterday, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYup, that I did. Could I have some kind of muscle fetish?\u201dRyuichi chuckled as she began to seriously worry about that in the middle of the road. It was understandable that she would like his muscles\u2026or rather, his entire body. She always liked being embraced by his arms or having his face in her breasts, after all.\u201cC\u2019mon, Shizuna, snap out of it and let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dHe tapped her on the shoulder, not wanting her to space out and bump into something as she had done in the past, and started walking.It had become common for him and Shizuna to go to and from school together since the start of May, and it was only natural that this would become known to those around them to some extent.\u201c\u2026Yaaawn.\u201d\u201cAre you sleepy? It must be your part-time job, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYep. Got off pretty late yesterday.\u201dRyuichi let out a big yawn as he recalled last night. One of the recent changes in his life was that he had started a part-time job. It was at that club, the place where he had met Satsuki and a place Ryuichi himself had frequented many times.\u201cI don\u2019t know when they\u2019re gonna stop sending me money. So I gotta earn some money for myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun.\u201dAs a matter of fact, after that day\u2019s incident, Sakie and Shizuna had talked about many things with him. They had suggested that he move out of his current apartment and move in with them, at Shizuna\u2019s house.\u201cWhat do you think, Ryuichi-kun?\u201cI have quite a steady income. You wouldn\u2019t have to worry about money and the like.\u201dIt was a very tempting offer for Ryuichi. However, he had no intention of being such a burden to them, so he turned them down. Incidentally, Satsuki had also made a similar proposal to him since then, but he had turned that down as well.\u201cI appreciate the offer you made, but I want to work hard at many things, too. I\u2019m used to you treating me to meals and all that, but I can\u2019t have you take care of everything for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmph, I wouldn\u2019t really mind it that way, though. But you do have a point. Plus, it\u2019s not like I can force you to think that it\u2019s actually\u00a0totally\u00a0fine.\u201dNevertheless, Shizuna had a quite\u2026no, she had a very caring nature to her. It was something he\u2019d come to know very well after getting close with her.Whenever she came to his house on the holidays, she would cook for him as a matter of course, and she would even do the cleaning without saying a word. Naturally, he also helped out, but she worked so quickly that there ended up being not very much for him to do, which was quite the luxurious problem.\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be heading to your place again this week. Or do you want to come to my place this time?\u201d\u201cHmm~\u2026\u201dAnd with Shizuna\u2019s question, a delightful dilemma was planted in Ryuichi\u2019s mind. As they talked like this, they arrived at school and entered their class, which already had a number of people in it.\u201cAh, morning, Shizuna, Shishido.\u201d\u201cMorning, you two.\u201dShizuna\u2019s friends greeted them first. As mentioned earlier, many changes were taking place for Ryuichi, and this greeting was one prime example of that change.He left Shizuna for the time being and went to his seat, where some of his male classmates, whom he had never spoken with up until recently, also approached him.\u201cMorning, Shishido.\u201d\u201c\u2018Sup.\u201d\u201cWalkin\u2019 to school with Rindo again today? Man, I\u2019m jealous.\u201d\u201cOh, shut it.\u201dEven though there was still some amount of hate in their language, it was a huge change from their previously frightened selves.Since the incident at Satsuki\u2019s place, the atmosphere around Ryuichi had softened somewhat; it wasn\u2019t like he had fundamentally changed, but there were some small changes that could be seen from him.\u201cHey, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cAnother day, another lovey-dovey scene with Shizuna, eh?\u201dMakoto and Kaname, the usual duo, also approached him. Even though some things about Ryuichi had changed, his circle of friends remained the same, and his interactions with Makoto and Kaname would continue unchanged.\u201cSomehow, it feels like Ryuichi\u2019s become a distant presence.\u201d\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201dWhen Ryuichi rolled his eyes at Makoto\u2019s words and asked him about it, Kaname nodded his head in agreement as well.\u201cYou used to be a lone wolf, but now you\u2019re being approached by all kinds of people. You even get picked for teams during PE, right?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201dJust as Kaname mentioned, Ryuichi, who had a large and fairly athletic build, was a favorite pick during PE lessons. His high physical specs made him a reassuring presence on the team for games like basketball and volleyball.It seemed that his change in atmosphere had a huge part to play in making it possible for them to invite him on teams like that as well.\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201dAs they were in the middle of their conversation, Shizuna approached them, seemingly curious. It was no longer a rare sight to see her coming up to them like this, and her classmates had all but lost interest as they no longer spared a glance at her.\u201cWe were just talking about how dependable Ryuichi is.\u201d\u201cWhy are you guys talking about such an obvious fact?\u201d\u201c\u2026Man, Rindo, you really do love Ryuichi, huh?\u201dShizuna\u2019s expression seemed to be asking, \u201cWhy are you stating yet another obvious fact?\u201d Seeing this, Makoto and Kaname laughed, their shoulders trembling.Well, Ryuichi\u2019s life\u00a0had\u00a0undergone some changes, but there were still those who looked at him in a hostile manner.\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t let up, does he?\u201dThat was what Makoto had to say when he saw Akira. As usual, he was hostile toward Ryuichi, and he directed spiteful glares at him at every opportunity. However, he never said anything or did anything; all he did was glare at him, which made one couldn\u2019t help but think that he was a coward.\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t gonna worry about him too much. He\u2019ll get bored of it eventually.\u201d\u201cTrue, true.\u201d\u201cSuch wise words from the man who stole away his sister.\u201dKaname said this to him with a grin because he knew what had happened to some extent. Sure, it was true that that was how things had turned out, but Ryuichi and Satsuki no longer thought of themselves as the stealer and the one who was stolen away, respectively.\u201cAight, I\u2019mma head to the toilet for a bit.\u201d\u201cAh, me too.\u201dMakoto and Kaname left to go to the restroom. As soon as they were gone, Shizuna stood behind Ryuichi and started massaging his shoulders, as if she had planned it.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing, I just wanted to help you relax a bit.\u201dRub, rub. Rub, rub\u2026\u00a0She was very skilled in her massage, and the way she varied her massaging strength from strong to weak at times felt so good that if he wasn\u2019t careful, he might leak some strange noises.These days, Ryuichi had the feeling that Shizuna was controlling him not only through his stomach, but with things like these as well.\u201cAhh\u2026 This feels so good.\u201d\u201cFufu. You seem to be in pretty bad shape here, sir.\u201dWith a hint of mischievousness, Shizuna continued to massage his shoulders. In the midst of this, his expression changed to a serious one without her noticing. He was thinking about his grandfather.I haven\u2019t heard from him at all since\u2026 That said, though, he\u2019s still been sending me money\u2026just that he\u2019s stopped calling me whenever he does it.Though he\u2019d had that exchange with him, seeing him still sending him money like this made him wonder if he really may have gone overboard that day.\u2026Well, they\u00a0are\u00a0well in their years. Plus, I ain\u2019t got nothing to say to them anymore.He still hated his grandfather and grandmother, but he had since decided not to say too much to them. If they continued to keep their relationship to a minimum with each other, neither Ryuichi nor his grandparents would have to deal with any unnecessary stress.\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling so happy lately.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause the class is starting to see that you have a kind and caring side to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really changed the way I treat them, though.\u201d\u201cYour air and atmosphere don\u2019t lie. If you think you\u2019re doing things as usual and people are gathering around you, that must mean you\u2019ve changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that how it is?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dWell, it wasn\u2019t that people were gathering around Ryuichi, it was just that he was being talked to a little more often. He had even, to a certain extent, grown less distant from his teachers now too, but that was probably due in large part to Someya\u2019s reassessment of Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a teacher\u2019s duty to believe in their students. I never thought I\u2019d be reminded of that.\u201d\u201cThough, if I had to say, you\u2019d definitely be more of a bad student than a good one.\u201dThe state of a person\u2019s mind and heart could change the way they were perceived by others. Ryuichi himself didn\u2019t feel like anything in particular had changed about him, nothing that he was aware of. However, those around him were gradually beginning to accept the change in his atmosphere. It was definitely not a bad thing, but a sign that things were moving in the right direction.\u201c\u2026Is this like some kind of calm before the storm, or a sign of the bad things to come?\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, don\u2019t say something so ominous.\u201d\u201cMy bad. Well, I probably got nothing to worry about, anyways.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got a goddess by my side who\u2019s going to blow all my bad omens away.\u201dWhen Ryuichi said this, Shizuna\u2019s eyes widened in amazement before she immediately giggled and nodded.\u201cYes. If misfortune befalls you, I\u2019ll just ward it off. \u266a\u201dToday again, Shizuna was smiling by Ryuichi\u2019s side, delightfully and happily.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Flirting, but at His Part-Time JobTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Oh my.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dIt was after school. Unfortunately for Ryuichi, today was the day he had his part-time job, so he couldn\u2019t hang out with Shizuna after school. Nevertheless, he would still walk her home\u2026because whenever they walked home together, she would seem very happy. Of course, part of the reason he did it was because he wanted to see her smile, but he also wanted to do everything he could to follow her whims as a way of thanking her for everything she did for him.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dIt should have been a normal after-school day, but there was something unusual that had been placed inside Shizuna\u2019s shoe locker. It was a letter; more specifically, a love letter.\u201cWhat\u2019re you gonna do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dThat was all she had to say before she stuffed it into her pocket. He could tell from her expression that she truly wasn\u2019t interested in the letter at all, but the fact that she put it away in her pocket could mean that she would just read it when she got home.\u201cI\u2019m not even going to read it when I get home. I\u2019m just choosing to throw it away at home since I won\u2019t have to worry about anyone else seeing me there.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dStill, Ryuichi thought it was reckless of the sender to confess their feelings to Shizuna. Though he wasn\u2019t in a relationship with her, anyone could see that she held sincere feelings for him from the bottom of her heart. He wasn\u2019t trying to be arrogant or brag about her feelings for him, but he inwardly expressed his lamentations for said person whose name he didn\u2019t even know.\u201cShizuna.\u201dHe hugged her shoulders as if to tell that person,\u00a0If you\u2019re watching her from somewhere right now, you better burn this scene into your eyes.\u201cDid you maybe get a little jealous?\u2014\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201c\u2014just kidding. I can\u2019t imagine a world where you\u2019d get jealou\u2026oh?\u201dThere was no way he would\u2019ve been jealous since he knew how she felt for him, and it was obvious that she didn\u2019t reciprocate the feelings of the sender of the letter. However, she didn\u2019t seem to have caught on to the fact that he was only joking, and his response made her eyes open wide in surprise.\u201c\u2026Fufu. \u266a\u201d\u2026Well, she seems to have brightened up in one go. Guess I\u2019ll just let her think I\u2019m jealous.When he saw her eyes wide in surprise and her cheeks loosening into a broad smile, he didn\u2019t bother to correct her misunderstanding and just\u00a0left it as it was.\u201cI see~. I guess I should\u2019ve known even you can get jealous, huh, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201cYeah,\u00a0totally. I\u2019m\u00a0sooo\u00a0jealous. You\u2019re\u00a0my\u00a0woman, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cYes! Yes, yes, yes! I\u2019m Ryuichi-kun\u2019s exclusive woman! \u266a Muhaaaaa!!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThough her voice had gone completely strange, it was still cute, and her sloven expression of happiness also seemed to highlight her adorableness as well.After that, he walked Shizuna home and made his way to the club where he had his part-time job. The club wasn\u2019t open yet, but the manager and employees were already present, and everyone approached him as he entered.For students, it was an impure place, and for adults as well, it was a special kind of club where people with\u00a0those\u00a0kinds of interests gathered, but strangely enough, the atmosphere was good and many of its patrons were kind-natured.\u201cHey there, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201c\u2018Sup, boss. Gonna be countin\u2019 on your help again today.\u201dA fierce-looking man with his hair swept back came in. He was the manager of this club and a man with somewhat homosexual tendencies, being more interested in men than women.\u201cI know you\u2019re tough and all, but don\u2019t push yourself too hard, \u2018kay? You\u2019re ultimately just a student. Don\u2019t let yourself get tainted by the atmosphere of this place\u2026though it\u2019s probably too late for that now, huh.\u201d\u201cNo shit.\u201dHe\u2019d already visited the club countless times even before he\u2019d gotten his part-time job here, so it really was too late for that.\u201cSomebody\u2019s put in a request for you. You won\u2019t have to do anything else.\u201d\u201cHuh? Who?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019ll find out when they get here.\u201dLeaving those few words behind, the time for opening arrived. While the waiters were going about their respective jobs, two people approached Ryuichi as he was diligently helping the manager.\u201cYoohoo, Ryuichi~. Hard at work, aren\u2019tcha?\u201d\u201cGood evening, Ryuichi-kun. We\u2019ve come to visit. \u266a\u201dHe didn\u2019t even have to turn around to recognize their voices. He let out a small sigh and turned to face the visitors. There, he found Chisa and Satsuki standing side by side, gazing at him.\u201cSo it\u00a0was\u00a0you guys. I had a feeling it might be you since the manager said they specifically requested for me.\u201d\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t think of anyone better suited to handling women than you. Plus, I know it\u2019s work, but it puts me more at ease seeing you talk to people you already know.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. Guess it can\u2019t be helped, then.\u201dWell, that being said, it had become routine for Chisa and Satsuki to come visit the club on the days when Ryuichi worked part-time. Though Chisa was one thing, it may have been surprising to see Satsuki visiting the club again after that incident, but the reason she came was because Ryuichi was here. In fact, she had said that she never would\u2019ve come if it weren\u2019t for him.\u201cUgh, guess that means I\u2019ve got to\u00a0work\u00a0again.\u201d\u201cYou dimwit, taking care of your customers is a splendid job. Aight, I\u2019m leaving this delinquent of a brat in your hands, Chisa-chan, Satsuki-chan.\u201d\u201cYou got it. Leave him to us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of him, sir.\u201dThus, Ryuichi was thrown into the den of the two girls. The manager nodded in satisfaction when he saw him sandwiched between the two, and even the other employees looked at Ryuichi with smiles on their faces.\u201c\u2026Damn, he\u2019s\u00a0always\u00a0being so soft on me.\u201dWhen he spat those words out, Chisa put her index finger on his cheek.\u201cC\u2019mon, don\u2019t say that. The manager knows about your family situation to some extent, too. You\u2019re trying to act normal to avoid worrying others, but that must be pretty hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, yeah.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s present life was relatively harder than that of most high school students. He had always been considered unwanted by his parents since he was a child, and yet despite his already cruel parents, he was forced to live without the love of his grandparents either after their early passing. In other words, Ryuichi had never known the warmth of a family and what it was like to be loved by one.\u2026Come to think of it, I don\u2019t know anything about my family in my previous life, either. Or should I say, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t remember them. It\u2019s such a strange feeling.It was a fact he sometimes forgot, but this world was a manga world, and it was why there could exist a family environment like this that would not normally be possible.In that case, he should\u2019ve been able to remember his previous life\u2019s family and understand what the warmth of a family was like, but for some reason, he couldn\u2019t remember them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWell, that being said, however; it wasn\u2019t like being unable to remember made him particularly sad. In fact, from his point of view, it was a good thing that he had no regrets about his previous life, because then he wouldn\u2019t have to get hung-up over it, and it wouldn\u2019t make him feel sad.\u201cC\u2019mon, Ryuichi, why don\u2019t you order something too? Better eat up here and now.\u201d\u201c\u2026You do realize I\u2019m on the job right now, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your job right now to eat with us, you know?\u201d\u201cHeh, you heard the two. I\u2019ll cook up some nice food for you, so order fast.\u201dIt was as if he was a small child surrounded by adults who were spoiling him\u2026or rather, it was like a neighborhood uncle and two older sisters spoiling the youngest kid among them.Although he wasn\u2019t completely on board, he knew the girls wouldn\u2019t back down here, so he decided to listen to them.\u201c\u2026Sigh.\u00a0Fine, I\u2019ll order something, boss.\u201dRyuichi ended up giving in to them. Just to be clear, things like these obviously weren\u2019t an everyday occurrence, and there were a fair amount of times when he worked himself too hard and felt tired the next day, much to Shizuna\u2019s concern.\u201cRyuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dSatsuki, sitting next to him, leaned in closer. As he was enjoying the feel of her touch on his body, he suddenly felt something like a gaze on him and turned his attention toward it.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dOne male customer was looking at not just Satsuki, but Chisa as well. Well, this club served as a place for people to find partners as well, so he guessed he had his eyes on either Chisa or Satsuki. However, he seemed to have given up trying to talk to either since Ryuichi was next to them.\u201cI know you can\u2019t drink, but here, take this to go with your meal.\u201d\u201cAight.\u201dHe obediently took the bottle of beer and poured some into Chisa\u2019s cup. It bubbled up and almost spilled out, but Chisa hurriedly sipped from it just in the nick of time.\u201cDrinking with you and Satsuki like this really does make the beer taste good.\u201d\u201cReally, now?\u201d\u201cFufu, maybe I\u2019ll have a few drinks today myself.\u201dSatsuki also started sipping some beer. Even as she drank her beer, however, Satsuki never moved her body away from Ryuichi. It felt as if she was implicitly telling him that she did not want to be separated from him even for a moment, so he pulled his arm out of her embrace and hugged her shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t drink too much. I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t that heavy-weight. Unlike a certain woman.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know my limits, and I plan on drinking within them.\u201d\u201cOh? If you can\u2019t keep your promise, I\u2019ll play a little prank on you like this, okay?\u201dHe shifted his hands from his shoulders and put them on Satsuki\u2019s ample breasts. Her eyes immediately widened; she drank the beer from her glass in one gulp and then said this.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to drink a lot and get you to play more pranks on me\u2026don\u2019t I?\u201d\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s what you\u2019re going with.\u201dSatsuki, too, had become much bolder in front of Ryuichi. Whereas not so long ago she would have been trembling in nervousness for even the smallest of things, now she was more confident in herself and was showing Ryuichi how she honestly felt.\u201cHey~! Why\u2019re you two flirting with each other!!\u201dChisa, perhaps feeling left out, also joined the fray. For Ryuichi, this was supposed to be his part-time job, but thanks to these girls, he was spending time that felt nothing like a job. Well, it was work in itself to deal with these girls, but anyone who looked at him would collectively say, \u201cWhat an enviable job!\u201d\u201cMaster! You got any condoms~?\u201d\u201cYou seriously think he\u2019d have those\u2026?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dIt seemed that this club\u2026no, its manager was definitely the most unusual one.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Stumbling Upon a Lewd PhotoTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026I hope Ryuichi-kun isn\u2019t overworking himself.\u201d\u201cFufu, looks like he\u2019s all you can think about, huh?\u201dWhile Ryuichi was working his part-time job, Shizuna was worrying about him over her dinner with Sakie. As a matter of fact, Shizuna had been so worried about Ryuichi lately that he had been all she could think about since coming home.\u201cI\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re worried for me and all, but don\u2019t stress yourself over me too much, all right?\u201dShe loved the Ryuichi who\u2019d laughed as he said that to her.She loved the Ryuichi who\u2019d patted her head as he said that to her.She loved the Ryuichi who\u2019d hugged her tightly as he said that to her.\u201c\u2026Sigh.\u201dHer heart yearned for any and every variation of Ryuichi, and she wanted his love so badly that she wanted to see him right now.Asking him to live together with her and Sakie was certainly a conclusion they\u2019d reached together out of concern for him and his family circumstances\u2026but the biggest reason was that she wanted him by her side all the time.\u201cHey, Mom. I\u2019m a selfish woman\u2026aren\u2019t I?\u201dThose words inadvertently slipped out of her mouth. If they were to live together with him, they would be together from sun up to sun down, from the moment they awoke to the moment they went to bed. They would be like a real family, and she was absolutely certain that they would never be separated.\u201cYes, maybe you are. But I think the same goes for me, too.\u201d\u201cYou too, Mom?\u201d\u201cYup. That\u2019s just what happens when you love someone, don\u2019t you think? No matter how much they tell you not to worry, you can\u2019t help but worry anyway because they\u2019re important to you.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Shizuna; Sakie was also thinking about Ryuichi. Considering his current situation, it would be better for him to have a parental figure by his side. Even if he refused that, there was no harm in letting him know the love of a family.\u201cRyuichi is strong, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s a very strong kid.\u201dIn truth, his family circumstances were so bad it wouldn\u2019t have been strange if he was more warped of a person. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange at all if he\u2019d resorted to a life of crime and violence from it, but instead, he\u2019d done neither and had attracted others around him with his tolerance and open-mindedness.That was undoubtedly his charm, and those around him were attracted to his strong heart that never gave in to his environment.\u201cI honestly despised his parents when I heard his story\u2026,\u201d Sakie solemnly muttered. She hadn\u2019t heard about his situation when she first had sex with him, but as she and Shizuna slowly got closer to him, she eventually heard his story too.On top of her hate and anger, Sakie, having a child of her own, couldn\u2019t understand what Ryuichi\u2019s parents had been thinking at all.\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re my mother, Mom.\u201d\u201cOh, how sweet of you.\u201dEven if it may have been simple or ordinary, love from one\u2019s parents was always special for children. Whether they received it at an early age or not would make a big difference in how they lived their lives in the future.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll watch over Ryuichi-kun. I\u2019ll always be by his side\u2026because I love him.\u201dEven if she couldn\u2019t have a more intimate relationship with him than what she had now, that was all Shizuna wanted. She had been saved by him, had slept together with him, and had gotten to know him in many ways, which was why that wish of hers came from the bottom of her heart.\u201c\u2026I think I\u2019m gonna try calling him!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Fufu, good grief, you\u2019re such a handful.\u201dAfter quickly finishing her dinner, she went back to her room. She took out her phone and called him, but no matter how long she waited, he didn\u2019t pick up. She let out a sigh, thinking that he was likely still working and didn\u2019t have time to answer his phone.\u201cGeez, I\u2019m so in love with Ryuichi-kun that I just can\u2019t wait to hear his voice. Well, I guess that\u2019s nothing new, nor is it anything to be embarrassed about.\u201dShe fiddled with her phone and opened an album where she stored photos. The album was named \u201cMemories with Ryuichi,\u201d and all the photos inside it were either that of her and Ryuichi, or of Ryuichi alone.\u201cIt\u2019s so nice and fun to amass memories like these, one by one\u2026 Fufu, I wonder how many more I\u2019ll make with him.\u201dShe looked at the pictures one by one and reflected on her memories of that time. Gazing at the photos with a gentle expression on her face, she even looked divine, like a goddess, but suddenly, her face turned bright red in an instant.\u201cW-When was this picture taken?!\u201dThe reason her expression changed so drastically was due to a certain picture. It was one of Shizuna being pinned down by Ryuichi, with an expression on her face that she would never show to anyone else.She was crying and sticking her tongue out in front of her with all her might, and her expression was one of complete debauchery\u2026 It was a picture that even she thought was incredibly naughty.\u201cWhen on earth did this\u2026 Ah.\u201dThe next picture answered all her questions. It was a picture of Shizuna, sprawled messily and immodestly on the futon, and Ryuichi holding a piece of paper with a \u201cSorry\u201d written on it, smiling like a child who had successfully pulled off a prank.It was a picture that straight-up declared \u201cI fucked your girlfriend\u201d, but it didn\u2019t feel that way at all, instead coming off as pretty wholesome.\u201cOh, Ryuichi-kun, you naughty kid\u2026\u201dShe spoke exasperatedly, but the next moment she let out a giggle. Seeing a naked Ryuichi smiling was enough to make her smile in itself, but seeing herself lying naked on her back behind him was a sight that would make anyone think she was Ryuichi\u2019s woman.\u201c\u2026How delightful.\u201dShe smiled, looking really happy. That was about the only embarrassing photo in the album; the rest were all taken by Shizuna herself. While she was looking at the pictures, she received a call from Ryuichi.\u201cAh, hello?\u201d\u201cHey. Sorry, I only just saw your missed call.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I just wanted to hear your voice.\u201d\u201cI see. I love you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201c!! \u2026Yes! I love you too!\u201dLikely because she\u2019d told him she wanted to hear his voice, Ryuichi straight-up told her that he loved her. She\u2019d originally intended to end the call early since she was concerned he might be tired from his part-time job, but apparently, he wasn\u2019t that tired from dealing with Chisa and Satsuki.\u201cOh, and when I said I was their partner, I only meant I was their\u00a0conversation\u00a0partner, not their partner in bed, okay? We didn\u2019t fuck or anything.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dShe kept it a secret that she was actually slightly jealous of the two girls. Then, after talking for a while and ending the call, she seemingly remembered something and stood up.\u201c\u2026Come to think of it, I don\u2019t have any use for these anymore, huh.\u201dWhat Shizuna had picked up was an item of gyaru fashion that she had used before for disguise. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d use it anymore, but she thought it\u2019d be nice to use it again if she went to some\u00a0special\u00a0establishment with Ryuichi again. She also hadn\u2019t shown it to Chisa, who had suggested it to her in the first place, so she thought it\u2019d be fun to disguise herself again to surprise her.\u201cWell then, I think I\u2019m content to end the day after hearing Ryuichi-kun\u2019s voice.\u201dShe got onto her bed, satisfied and content that she would be having another good night\u2019s sleep.\u201cOh\u2026right, I forgot to complain about the picture to him.\u201dShe only now realized that she\u2019d forgotten to complain to Ryuichi about the picture he\u2019d taken. Well, though she said \u2018complain\u2019, she only intended to confront him playfully and ask, \u201cHow dare you give me a heart attack!\u201d but she smiled and decided to save that for tomorrow.\u201cGood night, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dShe\u2019d already said those words to him at the end of the call, but she once again addressed his faraway self. She was alone in bed, but whenever she thought of Ryuichi, he would appear in her imagination. Not a pang of loneliness could be found in her heart, only a great amount of happiness.Then came the next day. She waited for Ryuichi at their usual spot, but since he told her to go ahead, she walked to school by herself. Makoto and Kaname had told her that was pretty unusual of him, but since he had asked her to go ahead, she had no choice.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s late, huh.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. He ain\u2019t ever been late these days.\u201dNo matter how long she waited, he never came to school. Even when the bell signaling the beginning of homeroom rang, he did not show up, and even as the homeroom teacher entered the classroom, he did not come to the classroom.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43His First Cold in a While, and Being NursedTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrWhile Shizuna and Ryuichi\u2019s friends were worried about Ryuichi\u2019s absence from school\u2026he was in his apartment under his covers.\u201c\u2026Dammit, I\u2019ve caught a\u00a0cold. For the first time in a while, huh,\u201d he muttered. His face was flushed, and a cold towel was on his forehead. He hadn\u2019t been in an accident, nor had he been attacked by anyone or had anything dangerous happen to him, he was simply lying in bed with a fever.\u201c\u2026Oh yeah, I guess I was so fuzzy-headed that I forgot to tell Shizuna.\u201dHe only remembered now that he had told Shizuna to go ahead of him, thinking that his high body temperature would make it impossible for him to go to school.He\u2019d already called the school and let them know, so she should be\u2026definitely worried, he thought.That said, though, he had a feeling she would definitely come to his place if he had told her he wasn\u2019t feeling well before she headed to school.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t bother her for something as tiny as this.\u201dIt was easy to imagine that she would\u2019ve nursed him and abandoned school otherwise. Since it wasn\u2019t like he was going to die, and he wasn\u2019t in bad enough shape to require hospital care, Ryuichi nodded his head and hoped that the teacher would hear about it and tell the class\u00a0after\u00a0school started.\u201c\u2026But, well.\u201dSince they were very close, he also sent Shizuna a message nonetheless, apologizing for the delay in telling her that he was taking a leave of absence due to a cold. He then put his phone beside his bed and laid down motionlessly. Immediately, he was attacked by a feeling of drowsiness. It had been a long time since he had been in bed with a fever, and it had also been a long time since he had missed school for a legitimate reason: a cold.\u201c\u2026Man, I\u2019m starving.\u201dHis body was lethargic, and thus he didn\u2019t want to move his body as much as possible. He had eaten a light meal, a rice ball he had bought at the convenience store, but it wasn\u2019t enough to fill him up.\u201c\u2026Zzz\u2026zzz\u2026\u201dEven a buff, robust man like Ryuichi couldn\u2019t beat the common cold. Praying that he would recover as quickly as possible, he closed his eyes and went to sleep.Ryuichi didn\u2019t know how much time had passed since then, but he woke up with a slightly clearer head. When he picked up the phone he had left by his bedside, he found that the time was just before noon.He was able to check the reply he had gotten from Shizuna to his message, and it read, \u201cI\u2019m on my way right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dIt was only a few words, but it was more than enough to surprise Ryuichi. However, he couldn\u2019t see her by his side, so he was definitely half-relieved, but also half-disappointed; two very conflicting feelings.The longer he had been with Shizuna, the more she had inevitably been spending time with him. Still, it seemed she wasn\u2019t neglecting her schoolwork, so he had nothing to worry about there.\u201c\u2026Man, Shizuna\u2019s seriously a high-spec girl, isn\u2019t she?\u201dThat was also true of Ryuichi, but he only thought of himself as an average Joe.Moving on, now that he was awake, he could clearly sense his hunger, and his stomach growled.\u201cGuess I\u2019ll make some cup ramen.\u201dHe still felt a slight fever and lightheadedness, but it wasn\u2019t so bad that he couldn\u2019t move. However, just as he was about to get up, he spotted a familiar bag in the corner of the room.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dIt was the bag Shizuna always carried on her way to school. No sooner had he found the bag than he heard the sound of running water in the bathroom.\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dHe stared at the bathroom, and sure enough, she appeared, wiping her hands with a handkerchief. Her eyes opened wide in amazement when she saw him awake, but soon a look of concern came over her as she ran toward him.\u201cYou\u2019re awake. How are you feeling?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just fine, but you\u2026what about school?\u201d\u201cI left early. I\u2019ve already told everybody, and I\u2019ve told Mom, too, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe immediately clutched his head in his hands.He hadn\u2019t told her in the morning for fear of this happening, but he never would\u2019ve expected her to leave school early and rush over. No, he was convinced that it was only possible because it was Shizuna.\u201c\u2026Thanks. Seriously, if I had to say, I\u2019m really happy you came.\u201d\u201cNo problem \u266a. I knew you\u2019d say that.\u201dApparently, Shizuna also knew Ryuichi well. Still, she\u2019d left school early to come check up on him, but it seemed certain that he still had a slight fever. It would be a disaster if she caught a cold as well, so they decided to keep as much distance as possible between them as they talked.\u201cI was really worried, you know? We\u2019ve been going to school together so much lately that it felt weird to be going to school separately for once.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cSo when the teacher came and you weren\u2019t there\u2026 I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry about that.\u201dHearing that from her made him feel like he should have just told her honestly. Even though he had caught a cold, she was smiling with relief from the bottom of her heart after confirming that he was okay. As they stared at each other, a loud rumbling sound could suddenly be heard.\u201cFufu, I\u2019ll make you a simple porridge.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me. \u266a\u201dRyuichi decided to presume upon Shizuna\u2019s kindness. After seeing her off to the kitchen, he decided to lie down and get some rest until the porridge was ready.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPerhaps people became weak when they caught colds, because even as he was lying under the covers, his mind was calmed just by the presence of someone else and being able to hear their voice.Thinking back, he had never experienced having someone take care of him when he caught a cold, so it was really refreshing to have Shizuna who was worrying for him like this.\u2026When I think about it that way, I guess I really wasn\u2019t loved, was I?Of course, he could remember catching a cold during his childhood. However, the only memory that came back to him was one where he was only given medicine and, far from being told words of concern, was told that he should just let it get worse and die. Well, such dark memories were no longer a burden on Ryuichi.You\u2019re the ones who should just disappear, morons!Aggressively retorting to his memories like that allowed him to forget about his dark past and his parents quite nicely.After waiting for a while, Shizuna came back with a bowl of porridge in her hand.\u201cHere you go, meal\u2019s ready.\u201d\u201cOoh\u2026 So this is porridge.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yup. It\u2019s really good for your digestion.\u201dIt looked like flavorless rice soup (zosui). Although he was told that it had a minimal amount of salt in it and thus might not be too flavorful, now that he was hungry, it looked no different than a fancy meal.\u201c\u2026Slurp.\u201dHe scooped it up with a spoon and brought it to his mouth. It had a thick texture, but also melted in his mouth right away. Its taste was certainly not very strong, but that did not stop him from scooping more and more.He finished the meal in no time and, still feeling somewhat unfulfilled, handed the bowl to Shizuna and thanked her.\u201cBy the looks of it, I wonder if you could\u2019ve eaten even more.\u201d\u201cMaybe. But this is good enough for now\u2026 Seriously, thank you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cReally, don\u2019t mention it. This much is no problem at all.\u201dHe stared at her again as she headed into the kitchen with the empty bowl. Seeing her slip away from school and do all this for him\u2026made him realize once again how important of a person she was to him, truly.He was once again assailed by a feeling of drowsiness, making him close his eyes with completely different feelings than he had in the morning. The sound of running water washing dishes in his ears put him at ease as he drifted off to sleep once more.Incidentally, Ryuichi did not wake up until about two hours later, and Shizuna still hadn\u2019t gone home yet. Though he wasn\u2019t back to tip-top shape, his complexion had improved considerably. Perhaps the day\u2019s rest and the porridge that Shizuna had wholeheartedly made had helped him to recover.\u201cOh, right, Ryuichi-kun! I saw the picture you took on my phone!\u201d\u201cSo you finally noticed it.\u201d\u201c\u2018Finally\u2019 is not what you should be saying right now! I was so surprised I couldn\u2019t help but scream\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were screaming at the top of your lungs then, too.\u201d\u201cGeez!!\u201dShe blushed somewhat happily; it seemed that she subconsciously really did like to be teased like this. He whispered in her ear that, though it wouldn\u2019t be possible today, he would make her squeal like that again, and her body blatantly shivered in anticipation.\u201cHeh, you\u2019re such a cute girl.\u201d\u201c\u2026This is why I\u2019m so easy of a woman, huh.\u201dRyuichi was lying down on his futon, and Shizuna was watching over him while heaving a sigh. And so, although the day had started off worrying, it seemed that everything would be all right now.Author\u2019s AfterwordPerhaps you thought something was up with how things ended last chapter, but no, it wasn\u2019t anything too big.However, the end is definitely coming up soon.Please stick around with me for a little longer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Moments Before His Fate ChangedTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cSo even idiots catch colds, eh?\u201d\u201cWant me to beat your ass up?\u201dRyuichi replied to Makoto\u2019s words with a glare in his eyes. It was the day after his cold, and he had completely recovered\u2026well, actually, last evening, so he was thus able to come to school in healthy spirits.The only time he\u2019d ever missed school until now was to skip class, so Makoto probably found it unusual for him to actually miss a day of school due to a cold.\u201cI actually wanted him to rest another day just to be sure, but he insisted that he was A-OK.\u201d\u201cI really\u00a0am\u00a0okay. You\u2019re just worrying too much.\u201dShizuna\u2019s expression remained anxious, however. He was grateful that she was so worried about him, but he truly felt that his body was in tip-top shape, and no matter how hard he strained himself, he felt just fine.He had considered the possibility of his fever flaring up again, but since that didn\u2019t seem to be the case, she really shouldn\u2019t have any reason to be concerned.\u201cThe moment homeroom was over, Rindo went over to talk to the teacher about you. As soon as she heard you\u2019d gone down with a cold, she immediately started packing her bags, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cI mean, I couldn\u2019t just sit still after hearing that, you know? C\u2019mon, let\u2019s just leave it at that, okay?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Besides, I was really happy when you came, too.\u201dThose were his honest feelings. For a moment, she stared at him with a blank expression, but then she smiled happily; as for Makoto, he seemed as if he was about to tease her, but he instead smiled amusedly.\u201cWhat do you think, Fushimi-kun? Ryuichi-kun\u2019s an honest boy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cOnly because it\u2019s you. Welp, I\u2019mma head to the toilet.\u201dMakoto left the classroom as if to get away from the lovey-dovey couple. That left Ryuichi and Shizuna together; she then borrowed the seat next to Ryuichi\u2019s and sat down next to him. The student sitting next to Ryuichi tended to arrive just before class started, so there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her borrowing their chair like this.\u201cSetting me aside, what about you? You didn\u2019t come down with anything, did you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just fine, you know? Were you perhaps worried about me?\u201d\u201cObviously. I\u2019m glad you nursed me yesterday, but I wouldn\u2019t want you to catch my cold.\u201dWhen she heard his reply, Shizuna went \u201cHmm\u201d, putting her hand on her chin, and fell into thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing, I was just wondering how you would treat me if I caught a cold.\u201dShe seemed excited as she said that. Apparently, she was more than willing to take care of Ryuichi, but she also wanted to experience the opposite.\u201cYou really think my lazy ass is gonna come to your house like you did for me?\u201dWell, I would go, though,\u00a0he muttered in his heart. He hadn\u2019t actually muttered those words out loud, yet Shizuna said this.\u201cI knew you\u2019d come for me. After all, you\u2019re a really kind person, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dApparently, she completely understood his behavioral patterns. If there came a next time where their roles were reversed, then he would almost certainly go to nurse her, and even if she hadn\u2019t done the same for him first, he would\u2019ve still visited her.\u201cI can just tell from that expression of yours. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026Really, now.\u201dHe turned his gaze away from the smiling Shizuna and let out a small sigh. He was a little worried that he wore his heart on his sleeve too much, but it seemed that it was only because it was Shizuna that she could tell. In that respect, Chisa, Sakie, and Satsuki might\u2019ve been able to tell, too.\u201cAll right, Ryuichi-kun; I\u2019ll be heading back to my seat now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Shizuna returned to her seat, the homeroom teacher also entered the classroom. The homeroom teacher looked at Ryuichi, but his expression did not change in particular, unlike the annoyed expression that he used to show in the past. It seemed that this, too, was caused by the change in Ryuichi\u2019s atmosphere among other things.\u2026It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve become some sort of honor student, though.He could gradually tell that the atmosphere about him had changed by watching the reactions of those around him. However, the part-time job he did was at a nightclub, and the fact that he continued to have relationships with many women, including Shizuna, hadn\u2019t changed. If they knew that, they would probably look at him again like they did before, but he chuckled, thinking that there was no point worrying about that now.\u201cFor today\u2019s announcements\u2014\u201dHe half-mindedly listened to his homeroom teacher, and time passed. There was no particular change in the way he spent his classes and breaks, and when lunchtime arrived, Ryuichi and Shizuna headed for the courtyard.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dOn their way to the courtyard, they came across a certain student who was walking in front of them. This student was their upperclassman and could be said to be the face of the school, the student council president.She was a woman who had respectable morals, was serious, and was all in all the personification of righteousness.\u201cIt looks like she\u2019s on her way back from the staff room.\u201d\u201cYup. Hard at work even during lunchtime.\u201dThey were about to walk past her, but she glanced at them and stopped.\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t the rumored Shishido I\u2019ve heard many things about.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe wanted to ask what was wrong about that, but he could tell that this would be a massive pain in the ass, and his expression blatantly changed. Shizuna naturally noticed this as well, and tried to pull Ryuichi\u2019s hand and walk away with him, not caring that she was the student council president.\u201cCan I have a quick word?\u201d\u201c\u2026With me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe firmly placed her hand on his shoulder and stopped him. Now that it came to this, Shizuna had no choice but to stop as well. She stuck herself close to Ryuichi\u2019s side and waited for the student council president to speak.\u201cYou were a well-known delinquent in our school. Is there any reason why you\u2019ve changed so much that even I can tell it clearly from your atmosphere?\u201d\u201cDo I have to answer that?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it, it\u2019s fine. I was just curious.\u201dHer expression clearly showed her curiosity. However, Ryuichi had no real reason to be silent, so he decided to answer honestly\u2014not knowing that it would make the girl who was currently in his arms very happy.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve found a precious woman to me.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh?\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes were blinking rapidly, and the student council president\u2019s cheeks flushed red even though he hadn\u2019t been referring to her.\u201cAre you surprisingly unused to these kinds of things, prez?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019m one of those people whose age equals the number of years I\u2019ve gone without a boyfriend. Personally, I think I\u2019m a pretty nice girl, though.\u201d\u201cTrue, your looks definitely make you a beauty.\u201d\u201cRight? Good grief, the boys in this school don\u2019t have any eyes.\u201dShe let her anger show with a pout. It was certainly as she\u2019d said; she was a very beautiful girl, a little boyish-looking, but her body had the curves where it mattered.\u201cI\u2019m sure you could\u2019ve gone looking for boys on your own, though? You got those massive boobs and all.\u201d\u201cM-My boobs?!\u201dShe quickly covered her breasts with her arms and backed away. Apparently, she really had a low tolerance for this kind of thing, and her face was even redder than before.\u201cThese things are just way too big and they get in the way. Plus, they draw a lot of unwanted stares.\u201dWell, that was the fate of women with large breasts. Whether they were to be judged as a hindrance or as an offensive weapon to attract the opposite sex was up to the individual, so Ryuichi couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cWell, try not to worry about it too much.\u201dLeaving things off with those words, Ryuichi and Shizuna walked away. Incidentally, she walked by his side in complete silence ever since that conversation.\u201cHup!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as they sat down on the bench, Shizuna started rubbing her cheek against Ryuichi\u2019s shoulder without saying anything in particular. Apparently, his \u201cprecious woman\u201d remark earlier had made her happy, and she kept clinging on his shoulder and fawning on him, like a cat fawning on its owner.\u201cHey, Shizuna. You remember when I asked you if you wanted to go on a trip somewhere?\u201d\u201cOf course I do. Wait, could you be\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about we go on that trip this week?\u201d\u201cSure, why not? Where are we going?\u201dRyuichi briefly paused at her question. Then, slowly looking up at the sky, he said:\u201cI want to go on a sort of date with you\u2026but there\u2019s this place I want to stop by first.\u201d\u201cA place you want to stop by?\u201dHe nodded.\u201cI want to ask\u00a0those\u00a0two what kind of faces they\u2019re looking at me with in the afterlife.\u201dWith these words alone, she seemed to have understood his intentions. Thus, it was decided that Ryuichi and Shizuna would go on a slightly long trip on the weekend.And, in a sense, that day\u2014was also the day that fate moved for Ryuichi.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45There Are Many People Watching Over HimTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cOoh, so you\u2019re actually taking Shizuna-chan out somewhere?\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, it\u2019s sort of a date, but\u2026\u201dRyuichi was at his part-time job, and today Satsuki hadn\u2019t come to the club, leaving him alone with Chisa. It was easy for him since he only had to deal with her alone, but apparently the manager had heard that he\u2019d come down with a cold the other day and thus told him to only take on Chisa for the day.\u201cSeriously though, there\u2019s no way this is considered proper work, is there\u2026?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s okay. I mean, you\u00a0are\u00a0like a son to the boss too, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s why he got worried when he heard you were bedridden with a cold.\u201d\u201cHah?\u201dIncidentally, Chisa also knew about his cold, as if it was as a matter of course. He knew that Shizuna had Chisa and Satsuki\u2019s contact information, but he didn\u2019t expect her to have the manager\u2019s contact information as well.\u201cWell, I\u2019m the one who told him, though.\u201d\u201cSo it was\u00a0you.\u201dApparently, the culprit was Chisa. Ryuichi glared at her, but she continued chugging her beer as if she didn\u2019t care at all.\u201cThat\u2019s just how worried she was for you. She\u2019s going to make a great wife, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201c\u2026A wife, huh. I\u2019ve never thought about that.\u201dEven though he\u2019d had quite the number of relationships with women, he\u2019d never thought about that kind of future. It was only now that he could do whatever he wanted, but once he was older, he would have to consider his future more seriously.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna had said that she would always be by his side. It was as if she was declaring that she would support him not only while he was in high school, but for the rest of his life as well. He knew her well enough to be sure that she would never leave him, no matter what he chose to do.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking things too much, you know~?\u201dShe stood up from her seat with a\u00a0thunk\u00a0and hugged Ryuichi. The smell of alcohol was more powerful than her sweet, feminine smell, and his expression turned into a frown, but he didn\u2019t push her away.\u201cShe\u2019s by your side because she wants to be. She just wants to; that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really, now?\u201d\u201cYes, really. For the record, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s bad, y\u2019know? Shizuna-chan, Satsuki, and I are here because we want to be with you; that\u2019s it.\u201dHer words were extremely honest and straightforward. She stared intently at Ryuichi as she told him that they were with him only because they wanted to be with him; nothing more, nothing less.\u201cLeaving me and Satsuki aside, I\u2019m sure Shizuna-chan will never leave you. I\u2019m not saying that because I know her all that well myself, but her will seems rock solid, and she seems to care about you more than anyone else.\u201dRyuichi had thought it over so many times, yet he could never reach a conclusion as to how he and Shizuna had gotten so close with each other. Perhaps there was some sort of corrective force from this world. Despite the vastly different relationship he had with her now, perhaps it was just his destiny to meet Shizuna and get close to her.\u2026I\u2019d definitely hate it if that was true.If his relationship with Shizuna was somehow predetermined, he wouldn\u2019t like that. After all, he wasn\u2019t following the story; he had gotten to know her through his own way of life and spent time with her from then on.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dIt was then that he suddenly stared at Chisa intently. If he were to interpret her earlier words as they were, it would mean that Shizuna would not leave him, but Chisa and Satsuki might.\u201c\u2026Does that mean you and Satsuki will leave me?\u201dIt was true that the only relationship he had with them was that of sex friends. However, if he had to say whether their relationship was deep or shallow, he would answer with the former, which was precisely why he could keenly tell that he was deeply emotionally connected to the two. That\u2019s why he felt a little sad about the possibility of them parting.\u201cHaha~, I see, I see. That\u2019s so adorable of you, Ryuichi. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he saw her grinning face, he immediately regretted having said the words he did. Without a second thought, he looked away from her and drank the juice he had on hand, having noticed that the manager was also grinning at him as he washed the dishes.\u201cWell, that was just a figure of speech, y\u2019know? Whatever changes happen in our relationship, I\u2019m sure Satsuki and I will never leave you either. That\u2019s unless you tell us yourself that you don\u2019t want to see us anymore.\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t certain that their current relationship would last forever. Still, the fact that he wanted to cherish his time with them as much as possible was proof that he had changed.\u201cI liked the previous you too, but I really like the current you better.\u201d\u201cHave I really changed that much?\u201d\u201cYup. Seriously, I\u2019m so curious about what happened to you to make you the way you are now.\u201dHe wondered what her reaction would be if he told her that he was a different person on the inside\u2026no, if he told her that he had regained the memories of his previous life.She was still drinking her beer, and the complexion of her face was gradually turning redder and redder in proportion to the growing amount of alcohol she was consuming.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m a different person on the inside. Or maybe I\u2019ve regained the memories of another me in a previous world\u2026\u201d\u201cAhaha, what\u2019re you talking about so suddenly?\u201dShe heartily slapped him on his back as she guffawed. Well, he knew this was the kind of reaction he was going to get, so he didn\u2019t really have much to say in response.However, the words that followed from her were very warm.\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then you must\u2019ve been a very kind person in your previous life, huh?\u201d\u201cGuh\u2026\u201dTo Chisa, it must\u2019ve only been a casual remark. But to Ryuichi, the words she\u2019d just said were special. The Ryuichi in this world was undoubtedly none other than Ryuichi; there was absolutely no involvement from his former self. Both versions of himself were truly him, though, which was why he was really happy to hear himself in his previous life referred to that way, even if it was just a casual remark.\u201c\u2026Heh, I\u2019ve really encountered some nice people, huh.\u201d\u201cRyuichi?\u201dChisa tilted her head to the side in confusion. Ryuichi asked her this.\u201cStill gonna drink?\u201d\u201cNah, I think I\u2019m done\u2026wait, are you talking about\u00a0that?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAll right, then. Take me to bed. \u266a\u201dIncidentally, the manager gave him a thumbs up and laughed at him, urging him to go. Ryuichi lifted Chisa\u2019s body in a princess carry and headed to the back.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2026I\u2019m just thinking about how wonderful a man you are.\u201d\u201cThat came out of nowhere, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said, chuckling. They disappeared into the back room, but did not reemerge until several hours later.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say anymore. I feel like spending my time like this at my part-time job is so wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? It\u2019s part of your job to serve the customers.\u201dSeeing his manager acting the same as usual left him unable to say otherwise. Incidentally, Chisa had been in Ryuichi\u2019s arms ever since they came out of the back room, never leaving his side for even a moment.\u201cYou were so incredible today. You were so kind, and so strong\u2026 Ah~, geez, you\u2019re really getting me hooked on you.\u201d\u201cMen get excited when they have nice women in front of them too, y\u2019know? Now that I think about it, maybe that part of me is just too far gone, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez, when you get like this, you\u2019re just so\u2026\u201dShe placed her hand on his cheek. She gently and tenderly stroked him, as if she were handling something fragile.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Me and the girls will be there for you no matter what, so try not to carry all your burdens on your own, all right?\u201d\u201cDo I look like that kind of person to you?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t. But now you do.\u201dIt seemed that Chisa was really watching him closely. Of course, it wasn\u2019t only her; Shizuna and the others would definitely notice as well, but still, she might\u2019ve been the first to be able to notice before anyone else.\u201cWell, at the very least, we\u2019re not the only ones watching over you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m watchin\u2019 you too, y\u2019know?\u201dIt was the manager who\u2019d chimed in. He was still wiping down the cups, not even looking at him, but his words meant that he also cared about Ryuichi a lot.\u201cListen up, Ryuichi. You may be a delinquent in lots of ways, but don\u2019t forget you\u2019re still just a kid. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help if you need it, and if you ever worry either me or Chisa-chan, I\u2019ll fuck you up.\u00a0Literally.\u201d\u201cAhaha!\u201d\u201c\u2026Please don\u2019t.\u201dRyuichi could feel that he was truly serious when he said that, so he made up his mind to never carry his burdens by his lonesome.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46His Late Father and MotherTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cMorning, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dOn the day that Ryuichi promised to go on a trip with Shizuna, he\u2019d already arrived at her house at about 9:00 in the morning. He thought she would be waiting for him inside the house, but he was surprised to see her already outside the front door, perhaps out of sheer excitement.\u201cThis girl\u2019s just so excited, you see. Fufu, how nice it is to be young~.\u201d\u201cI was really looking forward to it, okay? I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dShizuna puffed her cheeks out poutily. Seeing this made Ryuichi and Sakie chuckle, which made her even more sulky as she turned her head to the side in displeasure.When he reached out and patted her head, her expression immediately changed to a smiling one, and she hugged his arm.\u201cYou\u2019re an easy one to please, arent\u2019cha?\u201d\u201cHappy things make me happy. Obviously it\u2019d show on my face right away, you know? \u266a\u201dTrue,\u00a0he nodded in agreement. After saying goodbye to Sakie and telling her that he would take care of Shizuna for the day, the two started walking.\u201c?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dOn their way, they bumped into Sohei just as he was leaving his house. He was probably going out to meet a friend to hang out with today; when their eyes met, he turned his back to them and ran away, looking uncomfortable.\u201cLet\u2019s get going, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dCompared to Akira, who still harbored hostility toward Ryuichi, Sohei\u2019s behavior was much more manly and resolute. For him, Shizuna was his childhood friend whom he had been in love with for a long time, so it couldn\u2019t have been that easy to give up on her.His back was cloaked with melancholy, but Ryuichi and Shizuna walked in the opposite direction from where he was headed without paying any attention to him.\u201cSorry, Shizuna. Today\u2019s date might not really be, well\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine with anything as long as I\u2019m with you.\u201d\u201cI see. Thanks for understanding.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dWell, he didn\u2019t know if it could be called a date that a girl would enjoy, but it seemed that Shizuna truly only needed to be by his side to be happy. Even as he glanced sideways at her, who was walking with his arm in her embrace, her gaze remained unclouded, bright, and forward-looking.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad to have you by my side, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYup. I\u2019ll always be with you, now and in the future too.\u201dHer reply came without a moment\u2019s hesitation, and he nodded in response. Now, the reason why he\u2019d asked her out this time was certainly to thank her for her usual hospitality and also to take her somewhere. She\u2019d readily agreed to go out with him not only to enjoy this weekend with him, but also to see where he was planning to go.\u201cAll right, looks like the station\u2019s the first stop of the day.\u201dFirst, they had to head for the station and take a 30-minute train ride. It had been a while since Ryuichi had been away from town like this, even if he was only traveling a short distance away.\u201cIt feels so exciting to go somewhere new with you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cGlad to hear that.\u201cWhile they waited for the train to arrive, they killed some time by buying some snacks at a store.When the train eventually arrived, even though it was a holiday and was thus not as crowded as on the weekdays, the train was still sufficiently populated to see passengers here and there, albeit sparsely.With Shizuna\u2019s hand in Ryuichi\u2019s, they boarded the train and sat down next to each other in an empty seat. There were four boys about the same age that they had never seen before sitting in the opposite seats where they sat, and though they had been admiring Shizuna\u2019s figure, they immediately looked away when they noticed Ryuichi.\u201cFufu, they look so scared of you even though you\u2019re such a kind person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ain\u2019t anything new by now, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYup. But it doesn\u2019t matter what other people think; as long as I and the other girls\u00a0know how kind you are, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201dRyuichi certainly wasn\u2019t the sensitive type so as to worry about what total strangers thought about him, especially after all this time. Shizuna took out the snacks they had just bought and offered them to Ryuichi.\u201cHere you go.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dThe snack was a bunch of thin sticks covered in chocolate. He took one of the sticks offered to him and started munching on it, but once he finished his piece, Shizuna suddenly started doing some sort of gimmick.\u201cMmm!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cMmm!!\u201dShe stuck her face out at Ryuichi with one of the sticks in her mouth. At first, he wondered what on earth she was doing, but then he realized what she wanted to do, and he muttered to himself, \u201cIs she a kid or something?\u201dHowever, he still found it nice to see such a beautiful girl like her trying so hard to do something like this.\u201cFine, if you really want to.\u201d\u201c\u266a\u266a\u201dHe put his mouth on the other side of the stick that she was holding in her mouth, and they proceeded to eat slowly, each making munching noises of their own. Then, of course, the distance between the two became zero, and their lips touched each other.The taste of chocolate spreading in his mouth and the sweet smell of Shizuna\u2019s scent\u2026did\u00a0not\u00a0make him put his tongue in her mouth, but she still seemed to be very satisfied.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do this since way back.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYup\u2026It was really bittersweet, sort of.\u201dShe smiled as if to say she was satisfied. Incidentally, Ryuichi was sitting by the window, so when he turned toward Shizuna, he would inevitably see the boys sitting on the other side. Perhaps they had been watching the whole scene, as his eyes met theirs.\u201cUrk\u2026\u201d\u201c?!\u201dOf course, they quickly averted their gazes, but he mused that they must\u2019ve been interested perhaps because they were at that age. He didn\u2019t want them to feel bad and think that he didn\u2019t want them watching them. Sure, they\u2019d done it because it was her request, but it was still their own fault for doing what they did in such a place.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOh, the guys over there were watching us.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dShe, too, seemed to have figured it all out now.\u201cMy appearances are what they are, but you\u2019re a pure, beautiful girl who seemingly lives in a completely different world from mine. I guess they must\u2019ve been a little surprised too.\u201d\u201cA pure, beautiful girl, huh\u2026 Can you still say that about me after I\u2019ve shown you\u00a0that face?\u201dShe was likely referring to the face she\u2019d made on the picture on her smartphone. It was certainly far from the face of a pure girl; it was the face of a woman sunk in pleasure, but ultimately, it was just another face of hers, one that she only showed when she was having sex with him. It wasn\u2019t part of her public self, and since the usual Shizuna had an undeniable atmosphere of purity about her, there was nothing strange about it at all.\u201cYes, I can. Because that\u2019s a face you only make at special times.\u201d\u201cI wonder about that\u2026\u201dApparently she wasn\u2019t convinced. He wrapped his hand around her shoulders, hugged her a little tightly, and whispered to her.\u201cJust so you know, I like that face of yours too, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cUrk\u2026I know. If you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t have ravaged me so senselessly like that.\u201dWell, it seemed she knew that too. While her words were quite strong, her expression was a mixture of shyness and happiness, and he could tell that she really liked to be attacked.\u201cReally goes to show that you\u2019re a total masochist.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can be on the aggressive side too, you know!\u201d\u201cOh? Well, should we put that to the test next time?\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll show you!\u201dTheir plans for the evening were set. And so, time went on as they talked about some rather obscene things for high school students, and soon, they arrived at their destination.\u201cCareful.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dEven in trivial places, he didn\u2019t forget to take her hand.\u201c\u2026Fufu. \u266a\u201dHe wasn\u2019t aware of it himself, but she properly took notice of his kindness and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of some things first.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dHe then stopped by a flower shop. Although he wasn\u2019t very picky with flowers, he picked up a beautiful flower that his intuition told him was good, and headed for the cash register.\u201cAh\u2026welcome.\u201d\u201cHow much is it?\u201dIt was an astonishing sight to see someone so obviously delinquent-looking like Ryuichi buying flowers. Shizuna was laughing behind his back, her shoulders trembling, and the girl at the register seemed so scared of Ryuichi that she wouldn\u2019t even look at him\u2026 \u201cAm I really that scary?\u201d he muttered to himself.\u201cT-Thank you very much for your patronage\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe gave up, not wanting to say anything else.\u201cShe was really scared of you, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Say, Shizuna. I\u2019m not that scary, right?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re scary, you know?\u201dShizuna\u2019s pure and innocent reply was his only saving grace. They then continued walking, with Shizuna surveying her somewhat new surroundings, though that wasn\u2019t the case for Ryuichi.\u201cI\u2019ve been here before to shop with my mom, but I\u2019ve never walked around the place like this.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a 30-minute trip away, after all. No reason to come all the way here if you ain\u2019t got anything to do.\u201dWhile they were conversing, they made their way to a place a little higher up. It was a place where many graves were lined up, and one of the reasons Ryuichi had bought flowers was to come here.\u201cThere they are.\u201dThere stood two graves on the ground. The names \u201cShishido Maito\u201d and \u201cShishido Azusa\u201d were engraved on them, respectively.\u201cYou can tell a lot about a married couple when they\u2019re buried separately, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201dNormally, if a couple died together, their names would be engraved on one grave and their remains would be placed there. The fact that that wasn\u2019t the case here, however, symbolized the distorted relationship between Ryuichi\u2019s parents.\u201cWell,\u00a0that old man and that hag\u00a0did argue a ton over this. Doesn\u2019t matter now, though.\u201dWith that, he turned his gaze to the two graves once more. He then hugged Shizuna\u2019s shoulder as she stood next to him and held her close to him as if to show her to the two deceased people.\u201cYo, it\u2019s been a while. Not sure how many years it\u2019s been, but are you doin\u2019 well? Still having affairs in the afterlife?\u201dThose were not words that one would say in front of a grave, but still, those words leaked out of his mouth. Not long ago, he would\u2019ve never come to visit a grave like this, and he wouldn\u2019t have come no matter what anyone said to him. But now that his feelings and his mindset had changed, here he was.\u201cEven now, I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m happy or blessed. But I\u2019m definitely leading a fulfilling life right now. A life that you two regretted not having.\u201dHe uttered those words with confidence. And with that, Shizuna opened her mouth to follow.\u201cNice to meet you, Ryuichi\u2019s father and mother. My name is Rindo Shizuna.\u201dAnd so, this was how Shizuna met Ryuichi\u2019s parents.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong, dear?\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026no, it can\u2019t be.\u201dA short distance away, an elderly couple was staring at Ryuichi and Shizuna. The look in their eyes was one of bewilderment, but it soon turned to disgust and anger.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Yet Another ConclusionTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Rindo Shizuna.\u201dShizuna began with those words as she stood in front of the grave before Ryuichi\u2019s eyes. He was watching quietly next to her, but the reason he\u2019d come today was to report to his parents that, unlike them, he was living a fulfilling life. No matter how unforgettably cruel and detestable they may have been to him, however, he wryly smiled at his heartlessness for doing something like this to the deceased.\u201cRyuichi has told me a lot about you. I know that no matter what I say here, my words will not reach you two anymore. So\u2026I won\u2019t say all the curses and insults I so desperately want to say.\u201dShe seemed to be desperately trying to hold back her words as she put her hand on her chest. Ryuichi could tell that she had been as heartbroken as if it were something that\u2019d happened to herself when she heard about his parents. Even though he told her it was nothing to be that concerned about, she was extremely kind to a fault, and that was why she was this serious about Ryuichi.\u201cBut I will tell you one thing; just one thing.\u201dShe briefly paused her words and looked at Ryuichi. Her eyes were still their same beautiful, unblemished color, and they were shining like jewels. He\u2019d once said that Shizuna had her own unique color that couldn\u2019t be tainted by any other color, and that she was a woman with a very strong heart\u2026and he was exactly right.\u201cI\u2019m glad I met Ryuichi. I met a man I truly care about, love, and want to be by his side forever. Our meeting itself was sudden, and I don\u2019t know if our relationship from there was correct or right, but I love him\u2014that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi, who had been listening intently to her words, closed his eyes. It had only been about two months since he realized that he had been transmigrated into this world, but he still had all the memories of his life since he was a child. He had always been frightened of his parents, and his past memories were filled with disappointment. After his parents were gone, he spent his days with nowhere to go, harboring resentment and hatred in his heart.\u2026I probably have Shizuna and the others to thank, huh. For how much I\u2019ve changed, that is.As usual, he couldn\u2019t tell if he\u2019d really changed that much, but he could still properly notice the obvious difference from his past self. It was a big step forward and proof that he was free from the curse of his parents that had haunted his heart.\u201cAll I can remember from you two is how you always quibbled with each other. I\u2026never saw either of you smile at all. At best,\u00a0you\u00a0would\u2019ve been grinning at the money you got from the guys you were having affairs with.\u201dJust thinking about it for a moment brought back his memories of the past. All of them were memories he didn\u2019t want to recall, but again, unlike before, he had Shizuna snuggled up next to him now. It really showed just how much her presence supported his heart.\u201cWell, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not gonna ask you to bless me with some kind words, or ask that you think of me at least a little bit as your son. Not after all this time.\u201dThe words that followed from him were words for the future. His reply showed his strength, that he was no longer frightened by the shadow of his parents.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be haunted by you guys anymore. I\u2019m me\u2026and I have people who want me and need me, even if you don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2026\u201dRyuichi embraced Shizuna, placed his hand on her cheek, and kissed her. It was not a deep kiss, just a light peck on her lips, almost as if he was showing off to the graves.\u201cI better not get some sort of divine retribution for this\u2026 Shizuna, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201dHe placed the flowers he had bought and proceeded to walk away with Shizuna, satisfied that he had done what he\u2019d come to do. However, an unexpected encounter awaited them there.\u201cYou\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Tch, what shitty timing.\u201dThe voice that\u2019d suddenly called out to him was a familiar one. Shizuna tilted her head in confusion, but for Ryuichi, that voice was one he would never forget.\u201cSo it\u2019s you, old man.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dYes, it was his paternal grandfather who\u2019d showed up just then. His grandmother was also behind him, and neither of them seemed to be able to hide their hatred for Ryuichi. It had been a long time since they\u2019d actually seen each other, but it seemed that they did not want to see him even more than he\u2019d expected.\u201c\u2018What am I doing?\u2019 What else would I be here for other than to visit their graves?\u201dHe didn\u2019t mean to be provocative, but his wording may have been a little poor. Ryuichi\u2019s grandfather lifted his eyelids, glared at Ryuichi, and opened his mouth with so much intensity, saliva came flying out of his mouth.\u201cYou have no right to visit my son\u2019s grave! You have that woman\u2019s blood flowing in your veins!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHis manner of speech was still as abusive and full of hatred as always. Ryuichi was tempted to tell him to expand his vocabulary a bit, but he didn\u2019t say anything back because he knew that if he said anything out of turn, he would make things even more annoying. However, his grandfather seemed to be incensed that Ryuichi was looking at him with a disgusted look, so it seemed that no matter what he did, he was doomed to fan his anger.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Shizuna.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHolding Shizuna\u2019s hand, Ryuichi started to walk away. However, his feet stopped dead in their tracks at the words of his grandfather.\u201cThe women who gather around you are just like you too! They are filthy, nauseating, and disgusting\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201c\u2014gh?!\u201dHis voice was so low that even Ryuichi himself couldn\u2019t believe it. He didn\u2019t care what they said about him, but he couldn\u2019t stand it when they said whatever they wanted about Shizuna. Last time, when Chisa had taken the reins, he was stunned by the suddenness of the situation, so he just stood by and left it to her, but now it was different.\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say about me, but I won\u2019t forgive anything you say against Shizuna.\u201d\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d\u201cThis girl means a lot to me. She\u2019s supported me, she\u2019s taught me warmth\u2026and she\u2019s an irreplaceable girl.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2026\u201dHis words would not stop, and his feelings for Shizuna spilled out. Overwhelmed by Ryuichi\u2019s frenzy, his grandfather could not say anything, only being able to stare at him in amazement. He found it ludicrous, seeing as his grandfather instantly lost his words the moment he talked back to him like this to his face, and he wondered what his grandfather could\u2019ve been hard at thought about.\u201c\u2026Guh.\u201d\u201cShizuna?\u201dShizuna stepped out in front of Ryuichi, but looked down as if she was holding something back. As she did, she took small, deep breaths and clenched her fists powerfully. Ryuichi continued.\u201c\u2026Well.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cYou guys\u00a0did\u00a0keep me alive. And you\u2019ve been sending me money, so\u2026thanks for that.\u201dAnd with that, Ryuichi finally walked away with Shizuna. They exchanged not a single word as they walked by Ryuichi\u2019s grandfather and passed by his grandmother.\u201c\u2026Man, I never would\u2019ve thought we\u2019d run into them there.\u201d\u201cYup. I was surprised, too.\u201dIt was like an irregularity that they\u2019d met. He had had no intention of letting Shizuna meet them at all, and he was sure he must\u2019ve made her uncomfortable, but she was in fact smiling.\u201cFufu, there were so many things I wanted to say, but you looked pretty satisfied, so I just left it at that.\u201d\u201cReally? I don\u2019t think I said that much, though.\u201d\u201cI just had a feeling. A hunch.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dAs he walked with Shizuna in his arms, he turned around again, but his grandmother and grandfather were still standing in front of the grave and hadn\u2019t moved at all. He wondered what words they were saying to the graves, but he didn\u2019t look back at them anymore after that.\u201cSay, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYou said that I mean a lot to you\u2026and that I\u2019m an irreplaceable girl. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026That I did. I wasn\u2019t lying, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so happy! Ahh~, I think I\u2019m going to have a good night\u2019s sleep today!\u201dRegardless of this development, it was actually already decided that she would be having a\u00a0good night\u00a0tonight,\u00a0though\u2026But, seeing her smiling and laughing was such a refreshing feeling that he didn\u2019t bother to worry about the small details.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m really glad to have you by my side, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cThat again? But I\u2019ll say this as many times as you want\u2014I\u2019ll always be with you. \u266a\u201dRyuichi nodded without hesitation. Thus, the curtains closed on their grave visit and their encounter with Ryuichi\u2019s grandparents. It was by no means a small encounter for Ryuichi or Shizuna, but they came out feeling somewhat satisfied.\u201cWell then, since we\u2019re already here, let\u2019s take a look around, shall we?\u201d\u201cYes. This is where our date begins.\u201dSmiling as if nothing had happened earlier, they headed out into the city. They enjoyed their date, cuddling up to each other as if they were a couple who\u2019d been together for years.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48To Embark on a New RelationshipTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cAh~\u2026 C\u2019mon, Shizuna, ain\u2019t it time you call it quits and admit your defeat?\u201d\u201cNya\u2026I\u2019m\u00a0nya~t\u00a0done yet. \u266a\u201dShizuna staggered up at Ryuichi\u2019s words and embraced him. They were both unclothed, so it was easy to imagine what they had been doing until now.\u2026Well, I knew this would happen, though.With that thought in mind, he embraced her body as well. Unlike his muscular body, he could clearly feel Shizuna\u2019s smooth and soft skin.After everything that had happened that day, they enjoyed their date and took the train back home again in the evening.\u201cLet\u2019s leave it at this for today, okay? C\u2019mon, let\u2019s lie down.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay. \u266a\u201dShe had proudly proclaimed that being dominated wasn\u2019t all she was capable of, and that she too could be on the aggressive side, but well, that turned out just as well as you\u2019d expect.There was no part of Shizuna\u2019s body that Ryuichi did not already know, and the same was probably true for Shizuna as well, but the difference in experience between them was evident.\u201c\u2026I wonder why sex feels so good.\u201d\u201cBeats me. Maybe women are just more sensitive than men.\u201d\u201cMaybe. Of course, it wasn\u2019t like it felt so good that I felt my consciousness leaving me, but there were definitely times when I thought I\u2019d go a little crazy.\u201dEver since he first slept with Shizuna, he\u2019d always tried to take care and be considerate of her when he handled her in bed. He already knew very well that she was a masochistic girl, but that didn\u2019t mean he could just go absolutely wild and rough on her.\u201c\u2026Fufu. \u266a\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShizuna, who was using Ryuichi\u2019s muscular arm as a pillow, raised her index finger and poked it against his sturdy chest. She then gently traced her finger across his skin and muttered.\u201cAfter everything that happened today, I was able to reaffirm my resolve once more.\u201d\u201cReaffirm?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026I reaffirmed the fact that I really love you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cGuh\u2026\u201dHer smile was more beautiful than any smile he\u2019d ever seen before. The expression she had as she looked at him with gentle eyes was truly beautiful, like a holy mother, and her smile felt incredibly maternal even though she was still in high school.Whenever she gazed at him with eyes like those, a thought always crossed his mind. She loved him and him alone, but on the other hand, he had relationships not only with her but also with Chisa, Sakie, and Satsuki.\u201c\u2026Hey, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes~?\u201dShe must\u2019ve been able to infer from his expression that he wanted to say something. She looked straight back at him, as if she was implicitly telling him to say whatever he wanted to say. Thanking her for her kindness, he proceeded to utter the following:\u201cYou\u2026really care about me, no matter what.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cI also care about you, too\u2026but, you\u2019re not the only girl I have a relationship with.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you not have any thoughts about that, Shizuna?\u201dThose words were, in a way, words that he\u2019d always wanted to ask her. Shizuna put her finger to her mouth and went \u201cHmm~\u201d as she began to think. Then, perhaps having found an answer, she nodded her head\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a part of me that wants to monopolize you and keep you to myself. But I also know how Chisa-san and Satsuki-san feel about you. My mom seems to think of you as a son these days, so I don\u2019t think she feels romantic love for you, but\u2026 Fufu, I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t let go of those girls now, can you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah\u2026you\u2019re right.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to let go of them because they were wonderful women, that was for sure. But that was not the only reason. Those women, like Shizuna, were the ones who gave him warmth. That was why, when asked if he could let go of them, he could only say that he could not.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m so foul, huh? I know for a fact that if it were me, I would ask for a straight answer.\u201d\u201cHmm, are you thinking about something complicated?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHe was at a loss not necessarily because it was complicated, but because it was a problem he had to think long and hard about. However, it seemed she didn\u2019t understand why he was worrying so much about it\u2026or maybe it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t understand, but she was trying to say that he didn\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201cI, Chisa-san, and Satsuki-san all love you. We all know that and we all know that you have relationships and sleep with all of us. Even so, there isn\u2019t any sort of rivalry between us, and we aren\u2019t at odds with each other.\u201d\u201c\u2026True.\u201d\u201cThen isn\u2019t it fine? I think it\u2019s okay to leave things that way for now. You shouldn\u2019t overthink things too much; treating us the way you\u2019ve always done until now is perfectly fine in my opinion.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dWhen he heard her words, he turned his gaze to the ceiling. It was as if her words were urging him not to worry about the troubles he had, and that he should just go on with his life as before, not worrying about anything.\u201cShizuna, you\u2019re\u2026no, maybe that\u2019s okay for now. But man, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that of all things.\u201d\u201cHey, why are you laughing\u2026\u201dOf course I\u2019d laugh,\u00a0he remarked as his shoulders trembled in laughter. It was certainly not an impossibility that she\u2019d say that since it was Shizuna, after all, but he found it hilarious that she\u2019d really told him that he should continue his relationships with Chisa and Satsuki as he had until now. As has been mentioned many times before, Shizuna was a pure and beautiful girl, which actually made her the type of person who was suited to be careful and considerate about these kinds of things.\u201cI just thought that, in the end, you\u2019re you. A woman who\u2019s been dyed by me\u2026and a woman who\u2019s also dyed me.\u201d\u201cWhuh?!\u201dHe hugged Shizuna\u2019s face to his chest as hard as he could. Surprised, she let out something like a cute scream, but she quickly quieted down and let him do as he pleased. Her long, silky black hair flowed pleasantly through his fingers without getting tangled.\u201cYou have beautiful hair.\u201d\u201cU-Umm\u2026\u201dShe was surprised by his unusually gentle voice. However, even though she was surprised, the blush on her cheeks was a sign that she was embarrassed, and she seemed to be feeling comforted by Ryuichi\u2019s voice and touch.\u201cYour skin is so soft, warm, and smooth. Touching it is so comforting, I want to touch you all the time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hnng.\u201dShizuna\u2019s face blushed endlessly. She looked at Ryuichi with moistened eyes, seemingly asking to be praised with more kind words, which was so cute that he continued to say more.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking. I can\u2019t easily change the way things are now, which is really irresponsible of me\u2026but I want to try and change things at least a little bit and take a step forward toward something new.\u201d\u201cTake a step forward?\u201dHe nodded. As he said, it wasn\u2019t easy to change one\u2019s way of life, and his relationship with Chisa and the other girls probably wouldn\u2019t change anytime soon. In fact, it was conceivable that things might\u00a0never\u00a0change. Nevertheless, Ryuichi wanted to build a slightly deeper relationship with the one girl who was giving him warmth and love like this.\u201cShizuna, will you go out with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cWill you be my girlfriend?\u201d\u201c\u2026!!\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyes widened. Ryuichi and Shizuna had an overwhelmingly intimate relationship with each other, much more so than between a normal man and woman, partly because they\u2019d already slept with each other many times.However, their relationship up until now has been more of that between sex friends, so this proposal was made so that they could have a relationship where they could confidently declare to everyone around them that they were proper boyfriend and girlfriend.\u201c\u2026I do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to be your girlfriend, Ryuichi-kun!\u201d\u201cAll right. You\u2019re now my girlfriend, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHe stole her lips up close. One might be tempted to say, \u201cIs there anything that\u2019s actually going to be different from before?\u201d But at the very least, this would bring about a major change in the way they felt about each other. After they kissed, as if their extinguished flame had been reignited in an instant, they passionately and heatedly made love to each other for the second time tonight.\u201c\u2026Haaah\u2026 Haaah.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huff\u2026\u00a0Huff.\u201dRyuichi was unusually short of breath, as was Shizuna. They both looked up at the ceiling as they caught their breath and looked at each other from either side.\u201c\u2026Haha.\u201d\u201cEhehe. \u266a\u201dThey then hugged each other again.Thus, Ryuichi and Shizuna came to build a new relationship with each other. It may have seemed like it\u2019d taken them a long yet short amount of time to get to this point, but needless to say, at least the relationship between the two had become what they both wanted.\u201c\u2026It feels like I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYup. That\u2019s just how happy I am.\u201d\u201cWhat if this really is a dream?\u201d she muttered, to which Ryuichi replied with a laugh that it was not a dream at all.He knew that Chisa, Satsuki, and Sakie would surely\u2026no,\u00a0definitely\u00a0give them their blessing, no doubt about it. He didn\u2019t know if it would make them a little sad or not, but it likely wouldn\u2019t make any difference to his relationship with them.\u201cAre you really okay? With me not changing anything with the others like Chisa and Satsuki?\u201d\u201cYup. Chisa-san and the other girls are important to me, too. That\u2019s why it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re seriously such a strong woman, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been with you for so long now, so obviously I\u2019d have to be strong, you know?\u201dYou\u2019re getting too strong, he remarked, this time stroking her head roughly. She was concerned that her hair would get messed up a little too late, but she had a glowing smile on her face as she was being roughly stroked on the head all the while.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49The Princess Who Doesn\u2019t Want to Leave His SideTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt was the morning after Ryuichi had proposed his new relationship with Shizuna. Shizuna was the first to wake up, and when she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was a thick, muscular chest.\u201c\u2026Hnng~~\u266a\u266a\u201dEven though she\u2019d just woken up, her cheeks immediately slackened when she remembered what had happened last night. No matter how hard she tried to restrain herself, her cheeks couldn\u2019t help but loosen, and though it wasn\u2019t by an excessive degree, her expression was so disheveled that if anyone saw her, they would be worried about her.\u201cZzz\u2026\u00a0Zzz\u2026\u201dRyuichi still seemed to be comfortably dreaming, whether he knew this or not. Even looking at him up close like this, Shizuna knew Ryuichi had a face that made him absolutely unapproachable to a timid person, but in reality, he was a kind man who was considerate of others.\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2026 I love you. \u266a\u201dI love you. It was a seemingly magical phrase that she never got tired of saying no matter how many times she said it. To Shizuna, the first few days she spent coming to like Ryuichi and falling in love with him\u2026 They blossomed to color her life in the best possible way.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear if it was because she\u2019d been staring at him so intently, or if her feelings had been so strong, they were conveyed to Ryuichi, but he opened his eyes and pulled her into his embrace, still looking sleepy. They weren\u2019t wearing any clothes and their skin was in direct contact with each other, but they were being covered underneath a warm and soft blanket, which felt even better than she\u2019d imagined.\u201cOh, Ryuichi-kun, you little rascal. \u266a\u201dHe hugged her like a pillow, which she couldn\u2019t help but find endearing. Wishing that he would hold her tighter, so tight that he would never let go, she stayed with him until he fully woke up.Eventually, he woke up shortly after, and she got dressed and started making breakfast.\u201c\u2026Y\u2019know.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dShizuna was standing in the kitchen, and Ryuichi scratched his cheek as he said:\u201cIt\u2019s a really nice feeling, isn\u2019t it? To have my very own girlfriend standing in my kitchen, cooking for me like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Girlfriend, huh? \u266a\u201dHearing those words from Ryuichi again made her cheeks begin to loosen once more. She was in the middle of cooking eggs, rendering her unable to control her slacked expression, and her embarrassing face was completely seen by Ryuichi.\u201cWoah, you\u2019re making one hell of a face there, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t help it, okay?! I\u2019m just so happy it\u2019s making me overjoyed!!\u201dRyuichi likely felt the same way, and he likely knew what she was feeling on the inside. Hence why he didn\u2019t make fun of her and sat down on the bed with a smile on his face, much like Shizuna\u2019s.After finishing their breakfast, they spent the rest of the day doing nothing in particular but making out and cuddling more than usual.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Monday, though. We got school.\u201d\u201cI know. I know, but\u2026I don\u2019t want to go home.\u201dShe knew very well that she was being selfishly unreasonable. Even so, the urge to not leave his side was stronger in her than usual today.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s your fault, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShizuna\u2019s words caused his expression to go blank. She found that expression of his cute, but she puffed out her cheeks nonetheless and voiced her complaints to him.\u201cYou\u2019re being too nice and gentle today, Ryuichi-kun!!\u201d\u201cO-Oh\u2026\u201dHer words didn\u2019t stop there. She slipped out of his embrace and stood up, sternly pointing a finger at him.\u201cThe way you pat my head, the way you hug me, and the words you say to me; all of them are so much nicer than usual! That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to leave! That\u2019s why I don\u2019t ever want to leave your side!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, calm down, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t calm down!\u201dFrom Ryuichi\u2019s point of view, her anger was unreasonable, but she probably couldn\u2019t hold herself back from saying the words she did. As she\u2019d said, Ryuichi was being really gentle today. Though they had become boyfriend and girlfriend as a formality, he was nevertheless kind to her, as if to say that he had changed so much.\u201cHeh, the way you say that makes it sound like I wasn\u2019t that way until now, y\u2019know? C\u2019mon, c\u2019mere, Shizuna.\u201dHer beloved partner opened his arms and invited her into his embrace. Sadly, she couldn\u2019t resist the temptation and responded to his invitation by diving into his chest once again.\u2026I feel like I\u2019m going to melt in his arms.The complaints she\u2019d wanted to say had already disappeared somewhere. She wanted to stay in his embrace for as long as possible until she left his apartment.Now, on the other hand, Ryuichi also did not want to part with Shizuna. However, his desire wasn\u2019t as strong as Shizuna\u2019s, so he naturally accepted the fact that she had to go home considering the fact that they had school tomorrow.\u201c\u2026Uuuh!\u201d\u201cGeez, were you always this spoiled of a girl?\u201dRyuichi was also aware that he had been very indulgent with Shizuna today. He had no idea that it would change her like this, and he had to chuckle at her refusal to leave his arms even after her house came into view.\u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing each other again tomorrow, y\u2019know? This is just a short farewell.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know. I know.\u201dFor the next few minutes, she fell silent. However, even as she remained silent, it seemed she was mentally preparing herself as she stayed by his side. Then, she muttered, \u201cAll right,\u201d and vigorously backed away from Ryuichi.\u201cI\u2019m okay now.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dIt seemed she really was okay. She told him she would give Sakie the heads up beforehand, and Ryuichi promised he would formally talk to Sakie himself later. After parting with Shizuna, he walked home with a lighter mood than usual.\u201c\u2026What a mysterious feeling.\u201dAlthough he had had relationships with many women in his life before, his time with Shizuna felt more colorful than any of those encounters. He wondered if this was what it meant to have a special someone, and decided to cherish these feelings as much as he could.\u201cI\u2019m not like them.\u201dHe smiled at the thought that he was not like his father and mother, who never loved him; who, despite being husband and wife, were always at each other\u2019s throats.At that moment, the phone in his pocket vibrated, alerting him to an incoming call. Picking his phone up and looking at its screen, he saw that it was apparently Chisa who was calling him.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHello? How did it go?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t told her he\u2019d taken a step forward with his relationship with Shizuna, but apparently Chisa was curious and called him. Ryuichi honestly told her what had happened and that he and Shizuna had moved forward with their relationship.\u201cI see. Congrats, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dOf course, he also relayed to her what Shizuna had said to him. That although he had a new relationship with Shizuna, nothing would change in his relationship with Chisa and Satsuki, and that they would continue as they had until now.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Isn\u2019t that girl too tolerant?\u201d\u201cI thought so too. But on the other hand, I also felt a little relieved.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBecause just like her, you and Satsuki also gave me warmth.\u201dHe knew it was irresponsible of him, but he still didn\u2019t want to let them go. He might have less time to see them now than he did before, but he also wanted to cherish the two girls who gave his heart peace and tranquility.\u201c\u2026I guess you\u2019re just like her. You shouldn\u2019t care about us too much\u2026no, that\u2019s not it. I\u2019m also really, truly overjoyed to hear you say that.\u201d\u201cI see. Well, guess that means nothing\u2019s going to change between us from here on out, then.\u201d\u201cYup. There\u2019s gonna be a lot to talk about the next time I see Shizuna-chan.\u201dRyuichi laughed, thinking that they would probably have a very long talk then. Promising that they would all meet again soon, Ryuichi ended the call with Chisa.\u201c\u2026Haaah.\u201dLooking up at the night sky with its many stars, he breathed out. Nothing in particular would change, but these events were still more than enough to allow Ryuichi to take a big step forward on the inside. He was determined not to let go of what he considered important to him, and not to lose the treasure that he\u2019d obtained.\u201cWell, there are lots of roadblocks on the way, though.\u201dIn truth, there were still many problems piled up around Ryuichi. There was the matter of his grandparents, and there was also Akira, who continued to harbor taboo feelings for Satsuki.He wanted to be able to relax without having to worry about any of these things. He prayed that nothing major would happen in the future.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50As Expected, Shizuna is Just Fine The Way She is NowTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrRyuichi and Shizuna were going out in earnest. It wasn\u2019t something that the two had made public, but anybody could tell that from the atmosphere between the two that their relationship had progressed to something new. To begin with, the way Shizuna looked at Ryuichi was very maiden-like.\u201cRyuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cJust wanted to call your name. \u266a\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dExchanges like these, though not incessant, were a frequent occurrence. With that in mind, it was impossible to think there was nothing going on between them.\u201cWell, guess I should say congrats, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ve officially made her your girlfriend. That\u2019s great to hear, man.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dRyuichi meekly thanked Makoto and Kaname. He had expected them to tease and make fun of him in lots of ways, but contrary to his expectations, they honestly congratulated him. That being said, though, they seemed to have a lot of questions.\u201cHow did you confess to her?\u201d\u201cOr were you confessed to?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe\u2019d thought they were honestly congratulating them, but immediately they broke into grins as they questioned him. He chuckled at how this was very much like them, but he put his hand on their faces as they approached, since it was not something he could talk about as he pleased.\u201cGunu?!\u201d\u201cMugugu?!\u201dRyuichi\u2019s muscular palm held their noses and curiosity at bay, revealing some pretty dumb faces. Makoto and Kaname, like Ryuichi, were delinquents, but their faces were well-defined, so their distorted faces were quite unusual in that they looked similar to pig faces.\u201cC\u2019mon, just tell us!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s that big of a deal!!\u201d\u201cYou guys are way too old for this!\u201dIt was a little annoying that they usually showed no interest in other people\u2019s love lives, yet now they were being so curious and inquisitive. Ryuichi told them that they should just go to the club and sleep with a girl they liked rather than worry about their friend\u2019s love life, but they still would not give up.\u201cWhy are you two so persistent!\u201dIncidentally, the three of them were being watched by their classmates as they joked around. These days, perhaps because of Ryuichi\u2019s change, delinquents like Makoto and Kaname tended to be more accepted to some extent.They were thought to be scary solely due to their appearance and atmosphere, but the students now felt more familiar with them because they had Shizuna by their side, and sometimes they would show faces they had never seen before when they were with Ryuichi.\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cWhat a face, huh?\u201dThus commented their classmates around them, who were also staring at them amusedly. It seemed the princess who had become Ryuichi\u2019s girlfriend couldn\u2019t stand to just watch from afar while they were making such a racket like this.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, you two?\u201dShizuna came up to them. They immediately switched targets from Ryuichi to Shizuna, who had opened her mouth in a reasonably hushed voice, perhaps in consideration of her surroundings.\u201cWe were asking how you two confessed your feelings for each other.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s stubbornly refusing to tell us.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not really something that\u2019s said in public, you know?\u201dSeeing that Shizuna had taken his side, Ryuichi made a small guts pose. The two scratched their heads uncomfortably because unlike their joking mood, Shizuna had a serious expression on her face as if it was perfectly natural.\u201c\u2026We were being total kids, huh.\u201d\u201cYep. Scratch that, we were being total brats.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re all brats age-wise.\u201dAt the very least, they definitely weren\u2019t good kids like other normal students. Although their scary delinquent-like atmosphere had lessened to some extent, they still indulged frequently in the city\u2019s nightlife and had relationships with women. That was why the phrase \u201cbrats\u201d perfectly suited them.\u201c\u2026A-Ah!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dIt was then that Shizuna suddenly clapped her hands together. Ryuichi and the others were wondering what was wrong when Shizuna started to say this:\u201cThat means I\u2019m a brat, too. Ryuichi-kun\u2019s taught me a lot of things since I\u2019ve started going out with him, and he\u2019s also brought me to\u00a0those\u00a0kinds of places before. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026You sound really happy when you say that.\u201d\u201cSo Ryuichi and Shizuna really are going out, huh\u2026\u201dJust then, the chime rang, and Makoto and Kaname returned to their seats early. Shizuna stayed by Ryuichi\u2019s side until just before the teacher arrived, perhaps because she wanted to be by his side as much as possible.\u201cC\u2019mon, class is about to start. You should go back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I promised I\u2019d go to your house today, remember? We can be together then.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dShizuna resolved herself and returned to her seat.\u201cClass is starting~!\u201dThe voice of the teacher who\u2019d just entered the classroom rang out, signaling the start of class. It was a well-known fact that recently, Ryuichi had been listening to class diligently without dozing off at all. But just for today, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sleepy. He tried desperately to keep his eyes open, but his resistance was futile, and his consciousness gradually faded away.\u201c\u2026So sleepy.\u201dHe was sleepy, and if he wasn\u2019t careful, his head might slump down on the table right then and there. He was able to endure it to some extent, but soon Ryuichi fell asleep\u2026and had a certain dream.\u201c\u2026This is\u2026\u201dHe found himself in a familiar place. He was in one of the rooms inside the beloved apartment he\u2019d lived in his entire life, his room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had no idea why he was there right now. While he was thinking about various things with a fuzzy head, the door opened and someone came in from the outside.\u201cDid I keep you waiting? They finally wrapped up all their chit-chat, you see~.\u201dThe woman who entered the room was a flamboyant woman. She had blonde hair like Ryuichi\u2019s, earrings in her ears, and a uniform that revealed so much skin that if she walked outside in it, she would undoubtedly be thought of as a lascivious woman.\u201c\u2026You.\u201dHowever, Ryuichi happened to know who the woman was. She was none other than the person who\u2019d become precious to Ryuichi\u2014Shizuna.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong~?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing.\u201dRyuichi couldn\u2019t help but avert his gaze at her dragged-out, man-seducing voice. It wasn\u2019t that he thought her appearance was too arousing, he was simply wondering why on earth she looked like that.\u201cYou seem kinda off today,\u00a0Shishido-kun~?\u201dShishido-kun, she said. Shizuna should have been calling Ryuichi by his first name by now instead of his last name, but the Shizuna in front of him had referred to him by his last name, not his first name.\u201c\u2026Oh, so that\u2019s what this is.\u201dIt was at that moment that Ryuichi realized this was a dream. It was rare that one was able to recognize a dream as a dream, but Shizuna\u2019s appearance, which looked worlds apart from the Shizuna Ryuichi knew, tipped him off that something was wrong. No, well, although he did feel something was wrong with the Shizuna in front of him, that wasn\u2019t to say that he\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0know her.\u201cSo you\u2019re the manga Shizuna, huh.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026 Are you really okay?\u201dThis was the Shizuna from the manga, the Shizuna whose body and soul had been corrupted by Ryuichi. In order to suit his tastes more, not only had her mind changed but so too had her appearance to a more flamboyant one, seemingly throwing her innocent image to the curb completely.\u201cHey, Shizuna.\u201d\u201c? \u2026Yeah?\u201d\u201cAre you happy?\u201dIt was a question that had come out of the blue. Her eyes opened wide in amazement, perhaps wondering what he had abruptly asked her. She nodded her head and was about to reply to him\u2026when suddenly, he put his hand over her mouth. He knew he didn\u2019t have to bother to hear what she was going to say to him, because he could keenly feel that the Shizuna in front of him\u00a0was not the Shizuna that he loved.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re you, another Shizuna that\u2019s also Shizuna.\u201d\u201cShishido-kun?\u201d\u201cAnd I love Shizuna. But, well, at the very least it\u2019s not\u00a0you.\u201dHe gave a wry smile as he said that, and Shizuna\u2019s figure disappeared. Ryuichi felt a little uneasy now that he\u2019d been left alone in that space, but he had a feeling that he would soon awaken from this dream. As proof of that, he could hear his beloved girlfriend\u2019s voice.\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2026 Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWait for me. I\u2019ll be up and awake soon.\u201dNow that he thought about it, he remembered that the last time he had a dream about his childhood, it was Shizuna who\u2019d pulled him out of the dream too. She mentioned that she would always be by his side, and apparently that applied not only in the real world but also in the dream world.\u201c\u2026Geez, Shizuna\u2019s just so amazing through and through.\u201dLeaving that mutter behind, he opened his eyes and woke up.\u201c?\u201dOnce he awoke, he could feel someone shaking his shoulder. It was of course Shizuna, who had called out to him in the first place, and she was looking at Ryuichi with troubled eyes as if she were gazing at a small child.\u201cAh, you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was I asleep?\u201d\u201cYou were, and soundly at that, you know? The teacher even said they\u2019d feel bad if they woke you up.\u201d\u201c\u2026I messed up, huh.\u201dI\u2019ll apologize if I eventually get the chance to, he thought. He looked at Shizuna, who was staring at him, and the flamboyant Shizuna appeared next to her like a ghost.One Shizuna was staring at him with pure eyes, and the other was staring at him with flirtatious eyes for men. The more he thought about that difference, the more conspicuous it became, and Ryuichi turned his attention to the Shizuna in front of him as if to erase the other Shizuna.\u201cYou\u2019re definitely best this way.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying you\u2019re wonderful as you are now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 G-Geez!\u201dShizuna\u2019s face turned bright red at his words, but she hit his chest happily.By the way, he probably hadn\u2019t noticed yet as he had just woken up, but they were in the classroom\u2026which meant that their whole exchange was being watched, and Ryuichi had just personally provided his classmates with material to poke fun at him with.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Summer Is the Season of SwimsuitsTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrSummer was right around the corner. However, as it grew closer and closer, the temperatures started rising and rising, and it gradually got so hot that one started sweating just by walking.\u201cI\u2019m going to take a bath. What about you, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019m asking if you want to come with me.\u201d\u201cA very tempting offer, but I\u2019ll bathe by myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026Muu.\u201dWith a look of total disappointment on her face, Shizuna headed for the bath. Sakie, who had been watching with a smile on her face, approached Ryuichi and sniffed his scent.\u00a0Sniff, sniff.\u201cYour sweat\u2026 Fufu, it smells so manly and nice.\u201d\u201cSeriously? I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d call me sweaty.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s that too,\u201d Sakie said and laughed.Today, as usual, Ryuichi was spending the end of the school day with Shizuna, and at her invitation, he had come to her house. It was no longer unusual for him to visit her house like this, and Sakie also treated Ryuichi as if he were her own son, so he found it to be a very comfortable place for him.However, though it wasn\u2019t like it\u2019d gone to the extent that he was meekly fawning on her like a son to his mother, it had only been a matter of time until he came to see this place as being infinitely more important and precious to him.\u201cShizuna\u2019s been looking really happy these days. Of course, she talked about you a lot before, too, but lately she\u2019s been talking about you even more\u2026 I wonder if that\u2019s just one of the things that comes with being lovers.\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201dSince he wasn\u2019t with Shizuna twenty-four hours a day, he couldn\u2019t keep tabs on the things she was saying to Sakie. However, it seemed that even when he was not around, she was always talking about him.\u201cThank you, Ryuichi-kun, for making her happy.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s way too early for that? You should say that after you\u2019ve watched me in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026The fact that you think that way is also proof that you\u2019re kind, you know?\u201dShizuna certainly seemed happy enough even now. However, that didn\u2019t mean Ryuichi intended to stop there.\u201cSakie.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dRyuichi held his hand out to Sakie. She was Shizuna\u2019s mother, but also the woman whom he\u2019d slept with before he\u2019d come to know her as that. She was by and far much older than Ryuichi and Shizuna and might very well be considered an old lady in the eyes of society, yet she was still very young and her body remained youthful and vibrant.\u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cAh. \u266a\u201dHe grabbed her arm, and though he worried he might\u2019ve been a little too rough, it seemed from her reaction that his worries were unfounded. She hugged him and gazed at him as if she was expecting something, but even that appearance of hers was somewhat similar to Shizuna\u2019s in some respects.She had the maturity of an adult and the absolute attractiveness of a woman; combined with how she seemingly longed for the touch of the opposite sex, namely Ryuichi, it made for a positively stunning appearance.\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m now going out with Shizuna\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to change who I\u2019ve always been. Shizuna\u2019s words had a huge part to play too, but I don\u2019t want to let go of the people who\u2019ve given me warmth either.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026 You\u2019re a bad boy, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dRyuichi himself knew that he was a bad man. Still, he couldn\u2019t let go of them, so it couldn\u2019t be helped. He chuckled to himself.\u201c\u2026That sounds nice every now and then. Treat me as a woman, not as a mother, okay?\u201d\u201cHeh, you got it.\u201dHe stroked her head as she buried her face in his chest. Even older women could be pampered in this way, and this was something Ryuichi had learned through his many encounters with women in his life. Normally she would\u2019ve been preparing dinner until Shizuna returned from her bath, but for now she wanted to be pampered as much as she could by Ryuichi.\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I read somewhere that a woman\u2019s libido peaks when they\u2019re in their late-30s.\u201d\u201cOh my, are you trying to say that I\u2019m a sex-crazed woman now?\u201dSakie had given birth to Shizuna when she was 20 years old, so she was now 37. It was really cute to see her exclaim that she wasn\u2019t that lust-crazed with her cheeks puffed out, and it wasn\u2019t difficult to imagine just how much effort she must be putting in to maintain her beauty at her age.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was trying to say; I just meant that that\u2019s how attractive of a woman you are.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Shizuna\u2019s mother, so that goes without saying, you know?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t say no to that.\u201dThey looked at each other and smiled. It seemed as if she was blatantly implying that she was attractive because she was Shizuna\u2019s mother while simultaneously calling her daughter, Shizuna, attractive as well. None of that was wrong, though, so he saw no way to correct her.\u2026Come to think of it, the Ryuichi in the manga and Sakie, well\u2026whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter now.Even now, there were times when he dreamt about and remembered the world of the manga, which was distinctly different from the world he was in now. And every time he did, he was reminded of that difference between that world and this world, but nevertheless, there was no point in thinking about that now.\u201cAh, right. Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring Yomi-san and the others with you next time?\u201d\u201cYou mean Chisa and the others? Well, that doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\u201dBy \u2018Yomi-san and the others\u2019, she was likely referring to Chisa and Satsuki. He didn\u2019t know what her intentions were in making such a proposal, but Ryuichi nodded his head, thinking that with them in the fray, their visit might drag on surprisingly long. Of course, this naturally meant that Ryuichi, a man, would be thrown into the midst of these girls, but it was hard to imagine what kind of a conversation would unfold from that.\u201cWait\u2026 That might be a little scary.\u201d\u201cFufu, everybody loves you, after all. \u266a\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s an honor to hear, I guess,\u201d Ryuichi remarked as he gave a wry smile. They then stuck close to each other until Shizuna returned, and well, it was only natural for Sakie to shrug her shoulders in reluctance when she did return. When Sakie headed for the bath as if to switch places with her, Ryuichi told her about the proposal Sakie had made to him.\u201cInviting Chisa-san and Satsuki-san here\u2026 Yup, that sounds fun.\u201d\u201cYou sound excited.\u201d\u201cI am. Both of them are my precious friends, after all.\u201dEven though it would\u2019ve never happened under normal circumstances, Shizuna had gotten to know these girls through Ryuichi. It was always nice to hear that she held good feelings toward them, no matter how many times she said it. However, Ryuichi still had a feeling that he\u2019d be uncomfortably stuck in the middle of their girls-only night.\u201cI\u2019ll stick by your side the entire time, so surely you won\u2019t get bored, right?\u201d\u201cMaybe, but\u2026well, whatever happens, happens.\u201dAnd so, he had no idea when it\u2019d happened, but they ended up making plans to have Chisa and Satsuki visit in the near future.\u201cRyuichi-kun, now that it\u2019s summer, don\u2019t you think the beach sounds nice?\u201d\u201cTrue. I haven\u2019t been there in a long while, though.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even bother considering going to the beach in the hot sun. Makoto and the others had invited him to the beach in the past to pick up girls, but he had refused all of their invitations. The reason was simple: it was too hot and too much of a pain.\u201c\u2026I bet you\u2019d get a lot of attention from girls if you went to the beach, huh.\u201d\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d\u201cI mean, you have such incredible muscles\u2026 They\u2019re so far from your average high-schooler that anyone would gawk at them.\u201dShizuna poked her index finger at Ryuichi\u2019s chest as she muttered. Ryuichi\u2019s body certainly was taller and more muscular than the average high school student. It was precisely why he\u2019d been feared until recently, but as for Ryuichi, he laughed and said it was the other way around.\u201cMen\u2019s bodies don\u2019t usually get that much attention, y\u2019know? I\u2019m sure you would gather much more eyes than me.\u201d\u201c\u2026As in?\u201d\u201cAs in, you\u2019ve got plainly better looks, massive boobs, and a huge ass.\u201dThere were other things that made Shizuna attractive, but going to a place like the beach, those aspects alone were enough to attract a man\u2019s attention. As for Shizuna, she didn\u2019t want to be exposed to those kinds of gazes, but more than that, she wanted to at least have a little fun with Ryuichi, so she didn\u2019t outright cross-out the possibility.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing interesting to see about a couple of breasts and some buttocks, though.\u201d\u201cNot if you ask men.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I know.\u201dShizuna touched her breasts and looked at Ryuichi grudgingly, saying that they had recently grown a little bigger again. Ryuichi also noticed the continued growth of her breasts, as he often touched them while they were having sex, and patted her head, saying that it was a sign that she was healthy.\u201cSummer vacation, huh\u2026 Well, let\u2019s spend that time together as much as we can, all right?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. \u266a\u201dAlthough he hadn\u2019t realized it himself, it was sort of like gap moe for him to speak like this, showing kindness unlike his usual self. Shizuna was used to it by now, but she still felt her heart pleasantly race in excitement as her cheeks turned red.\u201cLet\u2019s get to makin\u2019 dinner.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026wait, you too, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cNah, I want to learn how to cook too. That way I can cook for myself and you won\u2019t have to stop by my place so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026I won\u2019t teach you.\u201d\u201cHah?\u201dHe thought it would be nice for him to be able to cook, and he also thought he would be helping Shizuna by asking her to teach him how to cook, but instead she told him that she would not teach him. When Ryuichi looked at her to ask why, Shizuna puffed out her cheeks and said this:\u201cI won\u2019t teach you\u2026 If I do, I won\u2019t be able to come to your place as frequently to cook for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWith a\u00a0hmph, she turned her head away and headed for the kitchen by herself. Ryuichi was frozen in place for a while at her absolutely adorable way of rejecting his request, but then decided there was nothing he could do about it and waited for her to finish cooking the food.\u201c\u2026Hmm, I see, I see.\u201dSince he had nothing to do, he began looking up easy-to-prepare dishes on his phone. It was immediately confiscated by Shizuna.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Ryuichi and SoheiTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026\u201dIt was a sight Ryuichi happened to come across. The final exams before the summer vacation were approaching, and Ryuichi was wandering around the city alone when he saw a certain person\u2019s rear figure. It was Sohei, the protagonist of the manga world, and he was being harassed by a delinquent.\u2026The hell is up with this world, why are there so many people who enjoy causing problems to others?He was disgusted at how there were so many people who seemingly loved bothering others. The way he saw it, Sohei had probably just bumped into him, but the other guy, like Ryuichi, had blond hair and piercings, and not only that, he also had tattoos all over his shoulders and arms that were visible because of his short sleeves.\u201cGuess I ain\u2019t got a choice.\u201dHe and Sohei weren\u2019t friends, they were only classmates\u2026No, from Sohei\u2019s point of view, he may have even seemed like the devil who stole away the woman he loved. But even if he thought that way, Ryuichi couldn\u2019t just abandon someone who was in trouble right in front of him now.\u201c\u2026Wait a minute, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen that guy before.\u201dThe man who was picking on Sohei looked somewhat familiar to Ryuichi. Although he couldn\u2019t recall exactly, cases like these usually meant that he had seen the man\u2019s face at one of the clubs or related establishments that Ryuichi had visited before.\u201cWell, whatever. Better get to helping him first.\u201dHe had no intention of telling Sohei to talk back if he got harassed, nor did he intend to call him a coward. In this day and age, it was natural for anyone who got picked on by a man with a rugged face and tattoos like his to be afraid that they might try to attack them.\u201cYo, Shinozaki, what\u2019cha up to?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHaah?\u201dSohei turned around, and his expression immediately did a 180 from that of fear to surprise, while the man intensely glared at Ryuichi who had made a sudden appearance.\u201cThat over there is my classmate. What do you want with him?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have you know that this shithead here bumped into me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why the hell do guys like you get hung up over ridiculous bullshit like this all the time?\u201dIt\u2019s one thing if he did it intentionally, but if he only bumped into you a little bit, couldn\u2019t you have just left it at that and walked away?\u00a0Ryuichi shook his head in exasperation.From the man\u2019s point of view, he felt utterly mocked by Ryuichi\u2019s behavior, and he removed his gaze from Sohei and turned to face him.\u201cYou better not get too carried away, you brat.\u201d\u201cHah, I ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 carried away for shit. I\u2019m only shaking my head at the dumbass who snapped at said brat.\u201d\u201c\u2026You fucker.\u201dRyuichi reflected on the fact that he may have fanned the flames too much. But fortunately, Shizuna wasn\u2019t here now. A little while ago, he would have even gotten into fights like it was natural\u2026well, it wasn\u2019t actually that bad, but it definitely wouldn\u2019t have been strange for him to get into arguments like these with ruffians like the man before him.Go on, get out of here ASAP.He tried to convey this message to Sohei with his eyes, but it seemed he was still stunned and made no attempt to move. Well, while he did find it regrettable, he also felt frustrated that Sohei didn\u2019t run away as he\u2019d hoped he would\u2026 But first came the man in front of him, Ryuichi thought as he assumed a fighting stance.The man approached and tried to seize Ryuichi by his collar, but there was no way he was going to let him do what he wanted, so he grabbed his hand and put some force into the opposite direction.\u201cMan, this is pretty, no,\u00a0really\u00a0tough stuff, huh.\u201d\u201cTch\u2026 You shitty brat!\u201dThe man\u2019s gaze sharpened further, perhaps having thought that Ryuichi was looking down on him. As for Ryuichi, he hadn\u2019t had any particular intentions to do so; he was simply surprised by the high specs of his own body. On the other hand, the man looked surprised when Ryuichi grabbed his fist that he\u2019d swung at him without any difficulty.\u201cWoah, aren\u2019t those two trouble?\u201d\u201cBetter call the police.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tch.\u201dPerhaps the man thought it would be a bad idea to cause a commotion as he blatantly clicked his tongue and left. Although he felt the same thing would\u2019ve happened either way had he let the man continue to harass Sohei, Ryuichi exhaled a sigh of relief, glad that it hadn\u2019t gotten that serious.\u201c\u2026Shishido.\u201d\u201cWell, make sure to watch out for people like him from now on.\u201dHe turned his back and was about to leave when he was stopped by Sohei. No matter how much he wanted to leave knowing it was Sohei he was dealing with, he felt like the least he could do was turn around after being stopped by him; plus, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with outright ignoring him.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPlease, I know talking to me is probably the last thing you want to do, but don\u2019t do anything reckless,\u00a0he muttered in his heart.\u201c\u2026Thanks for saving me.\u201d\u201cNah, I just happened to run into you.\u201dThat was all there was to it; he had no other intentions. There was a possibility where if he hadn\u2019t stepped in, he might\u2019ve seen him at school with his face all swollen tomorrow. Compared to that, it was clear that there was significant meaning in Ryuichi having helped him.Noticing a vending machine nearby, Ryuichi took the opportunity to head over there and buy some juice.\u201cHere. You thirsty?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 \u2018No thanks\u2019\u2026is not something I can really say right now.\u201dSohei obediently accepted the juice from Ryuichi. They both opened the lids of their cans at the same time and drank the juice to relieve the tension from their bodies.\u201c\u2026Carbonated drinks really bite.\u201d\u201cReally? I think they\u2019re just fine, though.\u201dApparently, Ryuichi\u2019s tastes were not to Sohei\u2019s liking. They took some time to drink their juice cans, then threw their empty cans into a trash bin.\u201c\u2026You know, I\u2019ve done a lot of thinking lately.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI realized\u2026I didn\u2019t know anything about Shizuna.\u201dIt was Sohei\u2019s monologue. It had been a long time since he had heard Shizuna\u2019s name again from him like this, so he couldn\u2019t help but turn his attention to Sohei. However, Sohei shook his head with a wry smile, not particularly interested in prolonging the conversation.\u201cWell, I won\u2019t say anything now. I was definitely shocked when I found out about her and you, but I can tell she looks really happy now. It\u2019s really frustrating\u2026but I\u2019ve always been taking my position as her childhood friend for granted in the first place, so it\u2019d be absolutely ridiculous for me to feel jealous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dApparently, Sohei had been doing a lot of thinking of his own since then. He was certainly different from Akira\u2026well, it was wrong to compare him to Akira in the first place, but Sohei hadn\u2019t gotten involved with Ryuichi or Shizuna since then, and even the way he looked at him hadn\u2019t given off any signs of hostility.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been thinking if things are maybe best this way. I loved Shizuna\u2026but I can\u2019t confidently say that I could\u2019ve made her as happy as she is now.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dEven so, Ryuichi could sense his frustration. However, in that case, Ryuichi also had something to say back to Sohei.\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of Shizuna. Just leave her to me.\u201dThat was all he said to him. Sohei looked at him with a blank look, but soon, he laughed and said, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u2026This feels like a nice conclusion to things. Seeing as how pure and honest he is, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll meet someone nice in the future, too.Sohei\u2019s face was average, but Ryuichi had a feeling he would probably be liked by older women.\u00a0Ahh, if that\u2019s how it is, then\u2026\u00a0He grinned with a hint of mischievousness.\u201cShinozaki, are you gonna head home now?\u201d\u201cHuh? Well, that\u2019s the plan\u2026besides, it\u2019s already close to 6 PM.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m thinking about having dinner after this, wanna come with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm, give me a minute.\u201dSohei, without the slightest of suspicions or misgivings, took out his phone. Presumably calling his mother, he said he was going to have dinner with a friend and hung up the call.\u201cSo I\u2019m a friend, huh.\u201d\u201c\u2026There wasn\u2019t anything else I could say, was there?\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201dWell, with that out of the way, they headed to the place Ryuichi already had in mind. He was taking Sohei to the club, and the closer they got to the club, the more Sohei\u2019s face changed to one of disbelief.\u201c\u2026Hey, you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\u201cWell, think of it as a real-world field trip.\u201dHe gave him a strong push on his shoulders and went inside. There were as many people as ever inside along with a lot of noise, and the two of them made their way to the counter seats where the manager was, slipping through the crowd.\u201cRyuichi and\u2026who\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cWell, I ran into him outside.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hello.\u201dSeeing as this seemed to be his first time in a place like this, Sohei naturally was reserved and quiet. Ryuichi told the manager to please prepare them something delicious, and he replied, \u201cYou got it,\u201d before setting to work preparing the meals.\u201cThis is the place that accepted me and took me in, shitty brat as I was. Although this place is what it is, the employees, including the manager, are all good people.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cWell, some of the customers are good, and some of them are assholes like the one you just saw, though.\u201dEven now he shrugged his shoulders at the sight of several people who were messing around while drunk. While they were waiting for their food, a female employee approached them.\u201cHey, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201c\u2018Sup.\u201dShe and Ryuichi were colleagues as he worked part-time here, and she also knew him from the times when he visited as a customer before. Despite her revealing attire, she was a slightly cold beauty who was known to have a very tight guard. Sohei, who had no tolerance for cleavage-revealing clothing, quickly averted his gaze, and the woman seemed to have found that naivety of his cute.\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve brought a cute one with you. You\u2019re a bad boy, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, we\u2019re only here to dine, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cReally? Ah, but now that you mention it, Chisa\u2019s not here either.\u201dNeither Chisa nor Satsuki had come today; the only people he knew were really just the employees. Ryuichi chuckled at Sohei, who was still embarrassed, and made this suggestion to the woman.\u201cThis kid\u2019s never been to a place like this before. Give him a little company.\u201d\u201cH-Hey, Shishido!\u201d\u201cYou got it.\u201dThe woman sat down next to Sohei. She then led the conversation with Sohei\u2026 He, who had been timid at first, perhaps became more comfortable having an adult woman at the lead as he gradually became able to talk with her.\u201cThe food here is really good, huh.\u201d\u201cRight? The food the boss makes is just so delicious.\u201d\u201cHeh, looks like you\u2019ve brought a customer who understands my skill, eh, Ryuichi?\u201dWell, you could say that, Ryuichi laughed. It was nice to have conversations like these every once in a while, and as he glanced at Sohei, he thought about how he never would\u2019ve expected he\u2019d get involved with the protagonist like this, and he was deeply moved.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53He Is, in the End, a Protagonist TooTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cSee ya later, Shinozaki. Today was a blast, eh?\u201d\u201cUrk\u2026 W-Well, I guess.\u201d\u201cHeh, too bad it doesn\u2019t look like your lower half had any fun.\u201d\u201cOf course not! I\u2019m not a playboy like you!\u201dTouch\u00e9,\u00a0Ryuichi remarked as he chuckled. He never would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d be able to joke around with Sohei like this, so having dinner with him at the club today was an unforgettable experience for him.It wasn\u2019t like the manga world had been that dark and brutal, but the sight of the protagonist and the antagonist getting along like this would\u2019ve been unimaginable to those who knew the manga from Ryuichi\u2019s previous life.\u201cLater, Shinozaki.\u201d\u201cYup. See you, Shishido.\u201dThey exchanged farewells and turned their backs to each other. However, just as Ryuichi was about to leave, he heard a voice call out to him from behind.\u201cShishido.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen he turned around, Sohei hesitated for a moment before he firmly looked Ryuichi in the eye and said this:\u201cThe last time I saw you coming out of that store with Shizuna, I said things like how indecent and inappropriate the place was.\u201d\u201cYeah, that you did.\u201dHe sure did,\u00a0Ryuichi recalled. He had also rubbed Shizuna\u2019s breasts in front of him while she was lightly disguised as a gyaru, which, in a way, must\u2019ve been another painful memory for Sohei too. At the time, he\u2019d done it knowing it would spite him, but now that he was talking to him like this, he immediately regretted his actions.\u201cAbout that time, well\u2026actually, nevermind. So?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSohei continued.\u201cI still think that places like those are inappropriate, or at least, that they\u2019re for adults. But\u2026the manager and the waitresses are very kind, and I think they\u2019re really warm people.\u201d\u201cI truly feel that way,\u201d he added.Even though the club was inappropriate\u2026well, in practice, it\u00a0was\u00a0a place that was made to serve those purposes, but still, it was undeniably run by very kind people.Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t strange that people like Sohei would have negative impressions of the place, but it still made Ryuichi really happy to hear him say that.\u201cI\u2019ve now learnt that I shouldn\u2019t blindly deny something without hearing both sides of the story.\u201d\u201cWell, a club ain\u2019t really the place to learn stuff, though.\u201d\u201cI know. But\u2026in the context of a real-world field trip, there\u2019s really no better place to learn than here.\u201dIncidentally, while they were inside, there had also been a man and a woman kissing passionately behind Sohei, which was a scene that was very stimulating for him. Still, the female waitress skilfully led the conversation with Sohei, and he seemed to have enjoyed himself from start to finish, so it must not have been a bad experience for him.\u201c\u2026Man, never would\u2019ve thought things would turn out like this.\u201dAfter parting with Sohei, Ryuichi headed straight home. When he contacted Shizuna after he got home and told her about what happened with Sohei, she was very surprised, but at the same time she asked him why he hadn\u2019t called her over too.\u201cThat\u2019s so unfair of Sohei-kun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re jabbing at?\u201dBut, well, the next time he went out to eat again, he made a mental note to invite Shizuna as well. Even if this had not happened, he would still go to the club occasionally with Shizuna, and if anything, she herself might come with Chisa and the others since she said she wanted to see him working part-time.\u201cWell, it\u2019s okay. The final exams are coming soon, so I\u2019ll have lots of time to spend with you then, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dAs Shizuna said, the final exams were coming soon, so they were planning to study together. Studying all the time was also tiring, though, so as they\u2019d said before, there were also plans for the girls to get together at Shizuna\u2019s house.\u201cMan, there are tons of events before the summer vacation, huh.\u201d\u201cFufu, let\u2019s make every one of them a cherished memory. \u266a\u201d\u201cYou got that right,\u201d Ryuichi agreed as he laughed.While Ryuichi was enjoying himself on the phone with Shizuna, Sohei was also thinking back to what had just happened. Ryuichi had said it was like a real-world field trip, but there was certainly no better time to learn about a part of the adult world than now.\u201cWhere did you go with your friend? You didn\u2019t go to some shady place, did you?\u201dHis mother had asked him a question that\u2019d spooked him, but he smiled and managed to gloss over the matter.\u201c\u2026Shishido, huh. Turns out he\u2019s a pretty good guy.\u201dCall him naive, but Sohei\u2019s perception of Ryuichi had now changed. Sure, he was the one who stole Sohei\u2019s love away from him, but Sohei didn\u2019t want to hold it against him forever, and seeing Shizuna smiling had helped him to adopt that mindset.\u201cLeave Shizuna to me.\u201dHis words had been very powerful and trustworthy. Sohei was sure that Ryuichi would make Shizuna happy, and although he was still frustrated, he was sure of that fact.\u201cBut man, it\u2019s been really tiring today\u2026 I think I\u2019ll head to bed.\u201dHe got on his bed and tried to go to sleep early, but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what had happened inside the club. The woman whom he had been accompanied by was named Mihara, but he had never been in such close proximity to an adult woman or seen such a large cleavage before, and the experience was so arousing that it was burned deep into his mind.\u201c\u2026Haaah. Am I a pervert or something?\u201dWell, surely there were many people who could sympathize with Sohei\u2019s problems. After all, anybody would burn the memory strongly in their mind if they could converse with a woman as sexy as her.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough he had had slight difficulties in falling asleep, Sohei soon closed his eyes. Then, he had a mysterious dream\u2014one in which his other self was speaking to him.\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking? That guy stole Shizuna away from you!\u201dA person with the same face as himself was speaking to him. His words were a series of angry bellows about why he was getting along with Ryuichi and what he was doing when Ryuichi had taken Shizuna away from him.\u201c\u2026He sounds like me a little while ago.\u201dIt was the figure of a person who couldn\u2019t accept reality and kept complaining about it. It was the figure of a person who had depended on the intimacy he\u2019d had as her childhood friend and had continued to cling to the sweet illusion that she would definitely look back at him\u2026 When he looked at it objectively like this, he could clearly see how pathetic it was.\u201cWhy are you laughing?! Do you have no pride?!\u2019\u201c\u2026I see. So I was laughing.\u201dApparently Sohei had been laughing at his dream-self. Realizing this hadn\u2019t invoked any thoughts in particular, though; in fact, he laughed even more at himself.\u201cPride, huh\u2026 I\u2019ve long since thrown my pride away; that very same pride that\u2019s constantly nagged at me and made me hesitant and wavering. Shizuna is certainly important to me, but\u2014\u201dHe paused for a moment, took a deep breath in, and continued.\u201cI\u2019ve decided to leave her to a man who can make her truly happy and at the same time make her fall in love with him. That guy\u2026Shishido will surely make Shizuna happy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026leaving her to\u00a0him?!\u201dWhat a strange dream this is, he thought. And yet, he still couldn\u2019t understand why this person was so angry. Well, Sohei had a lot of things on his mind as well, but he decided to forget about this dream as soon as possible and turned his back on it.\u201cAre you running away?!\u201d\u201cRunning away? No, not at all. When I go to sleep, I wake up, which means it will be tomorrow, so I\u2019m not running away, I\u2019m just facing the future, you idiot~.\u201dAfter he said this, his dream-self disappeared with a vexed look on his face. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t feel anything when he saw himself vanish without a trace; it was just that he was thinking that if he\u2019d slipped up, he could have ended up like that, too.\u201c\u2026I learnt quite a bit about Shishido in my talk with him, huh.\u201dWhile they were eating dinner together, the manager and the female waitress had joined in the conversation and asked Ryuichi about himself. Sohei learned that he, too, had suffered a lot in his own way, and in the process had met Shizuna and many other people who helped him get to where he was today.There was no doubt that he was a delinquent, but what Shizuna had fallen in love with was his true self, his kind self. Sohei laughed when he thought about how a girl falling in love and going out with a person feared by others was almost like something out of a well-made manga.\u201cWell, a lot of things happened, but he was easy to talk to. And he was a good guy\u2026 Truly.\u201dIf this world was a manga, then all he\u2019d done was win over the heroine that was Shizuna.\u201cIf I had to use the word \u2018protagonist,\u2019 I\u2019d say Shishido more than fits that role.\u201dSohei muttered as he surrendered himself to the sensation of waking up. Unbeknownst to Sohei, this world was a former manga world that had already begun to take its own route. The original protagonist, the one who\u2019d only been stolen from, was not here. Instead of being sulky and disgruntled, Sohei had the strength to accept reality and look firmly ahead.\u201c\u2026All in all, it was a pretty nice place. Well, obviously I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll become a regular there, though. \u201dWell, of course you can\u2019t,\u00a0most people would retort and laugh.Sohei had said that Ryuichi was a protagonist, but having the strength to accept his frustrations like this was also another sign of a protagonist.Hang in there, MC. It was as if the light shining on him was telling him that the future would surely be bright.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54A Get-Together With EverybodyTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Oh, this question uses this formula, huh.\u201dThe day of the final exam had finally arrived, and Ryuichi was solving its questions more smoothly than usual. His academic ability was never low, as he\u2019d always had a good head on his shoulders, and he was certainly better than average, but thanks to his study session with Shizuna, he was expecting even better results this time around.Damn, now that I think about it, I\u2019ve never really studied for a test like this before, huh. I\u2019ve always been able to get okay-ish grades even without studying, but I guess there\u2019s just never been a test which I actually set a target score and studied for.As a matter of fact, since Ryuichi had had the rare chance of being taught by Shizuna, he studied hard this time around to aim for a certain score range.He never would\u2019ve thought the day would come when he would squander his day off to go to Shizuna\u2019s house in the morning and spread out his study materials in her room of all things, and there were many times when they had looked at each other and laughed in wonder at the situation.Aight, with this, I\u2019m finally done with the test\u2026 Finally, it\u2019s over.With that in mind, he solved the last question on the test as well. Since he was already exhausted, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to check his answers, and though Shizuna might scold him for being too complacent, he shrugged it off with a smile.\u201cAll right, time\u2019s up. Pass your answer sheets from back to front.\u201dUpon hearing the cue that signaled the test\u2019s end, Ryuichi stretched his arms out toward the ceiling. After the teacher finished collecting the answer sheets and walked out of the classroom, the tension that had been in the air throughout the class quickly evaporated.\u201cAh~, it\u2019s finally over~.\u201d\u201cI wonder if I\u2019ll be okay\u2026\u201d\u201cThink you\u2019ll get red marks?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026hang in there.\u201dThere were varied reactions around the class; some felt that they\u2019d done well on the test while others were anxious about whether or not they had done well enough.Makoto and Kaname, who usually came to his desk to chat with him, were sprawled lifelessly on their desks as if they had used up too much of their concentration.\u00a0Those two must\u2019ve worked really hard, too.\u00a0Ryuichi laughed.\u201cGood job, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYep. You too, Shizuna.\u201dHe exchanged words with Shizuna, who\u2019d come up to him.\u201cHow did you do?\u201d\u201cSo-so. All thanks to you.\u201d\u201cReally? That makes me happy to hear.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t lying when he said that studying with Shizuna had been really helpful. If there was a part he found somewhat difficult to understand, she would give him the answer right away, and above all else, she was a really smart girl. She came up with answers so readily that for a moment Ryuichi seriously considered calling her \u201cSensei\u201d.\u201cFufu, we\u2019re going to get together with everybody later today, so it really evens out the stress of working hard.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201dThat\u2019s right, today was also the day that Chisa and Satsuki, including Ryuichi, would gather at Shizuna\u2019s house. They had previously planned to make time to visit Shizuna\u2019s house, and it just so happened that today was the perfect day.Ryuichi had been worried about what kind of girls\u2019 night out it would turn out to be, but the thought that he would be having a hot pot with everybody made him a little excited.\u201cToday\u2019s Friday, and tomorrow\u2019s a holiday\u2026 Ahh, that means I can chill and relax for the entire day.\u201d\u201cYup. Will you be staying the night at my place?\u201d\u201cCan I?\u201d\u201cOf course. \u266a\u201dAnd so, it was decided that he would be staying at her place, too. Afterward, he sat through closing homeroom, packed his bags, and left the classroom with Shizuna.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dAs they were walking down the hallway, his eyes met a certain teacher\u2019s\u2026 Hamasaki\u2019s. These days, he didn\u2019t talk to him anymore, and he didn\u2019t get involved with Shizuna either, as if he had given up on advising her. Even so, seeing how he glared at Ryuichi the same way Akira did made him seem kind of childish for holding a grudge against a child, which was comical.\u201cHe actually did try to call Mom, but of course, she got mad at him when he bad mouthed you\u201d\u201cAh, so maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s acting like that now.\u201dThough she may have caused him to have more troublesome feelings for Ryuichi than ever before, Ryuichi still thanked her for giving Hamasaki what he deserved. Just like that, they passed by Hamasaki, changed their shoes, and went outside. They headed straight for Shizuna\u2019s house, and when they arrived, Sakie hadn\u2019t returned from work yet, so he and Shizuna had some alone time.\u201cHey Shizuna, I\u2019m really exhausted from the exam; can I ask you for a quick lap pillow?\u201d\u201cSure, why not?\u201dShizuna sat down on the sofa and Ryuichi immediately went over to her and positioned himself for him to lie on her lap.\u201cYou did well, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cWhat are you, my mom or something? \u2026Well, it\u2019s not a bad feeling, though.\u201dThey then stayed that way until Sakie returned home. When Sakie returned from work, she looked at Ryuichi and Shizuna smilingly, took out the ingredients for the hot pot she had prepared for the occasion from the refrigerator, and began to prepare the food.\u201cHow was your test?\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun and I aced it.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that when you haven\u2019t gotten your results yet?\u201d\u201cI just know it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi was a little scared to think about what would happen in the off chance that he got a bad score. Time passed as he talked with Shizuna and Sakie, when suddenly, Ryuichi\u2019s phone vibrated.\u201cAh, they\u2019re here. Alright, I\u2019ll go get them real quick.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come too.\u201dHe\u2019d received a message from Chisa, and it read that she would be arriving soon, so he headed out to meet her. After walking outside for a while, they spotted the two beautiful women walking toward them a distance away, and Shizuna waved to them. Chisa and Satsuki waved back and joined up with the other two.\u201cThanks for inviting us today, Shizuna-chan.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been really looking forward to this. \u266a\u201d\u201cSo have I. All right, let\u2019s get going.\u201dThus, they went back home with Chisa and Satsuki in tow\u2026and Ryuichi had to say, he felt a little regretful.\u201cI know, right? I think that part about Ryuichi\u2019s really nice, too!\u201d\u201cSame here. So you think that way, too, Chisa-san!\u201d\u201cI think that, too~! Ryuichi-kun is such a wonderful boy~!!\u201dThe preparation of the hot pot, which was also the main dish of the dinner, had been finished, and from there the noisy times began with the five people. Ryuichi and Shizuna, who were still minors, couldn\u2019t drink alcohol, but the remaining three were already getting wild under the influence of alcohol.\u201c\u2026I knew things would turn out this way.\u201d\u201cAhaha\u2026\u201dChisa, Satsuki, and Sakie had only just met today, yet they hit it off with each other right away. Their conversation was all about Ryuichi, and as for Ryuichi, he spent the entire time feeling uncomfortable.He took his eyes off the three girls and quietly ate his hot pot with Shizuna. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again for him, but he had already known this would happen once they started drinking.\u201cI wonder if we\u2019ll end up like that one day.\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s a saying that goes \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t drink without getting drunk,\u201d but I sure as hell don\u2019t want to end up like them.\u201dSatsuki was still okay, but Chisa and Sakie were really something to behold. Sakie didn\u2019t usually drink when she was with Shizuna, so it seemed she had let loose quite a bit in a situation like this with so many people. As for Shizuna, seeing her mother like that was something she did not\u2026not\u00a0want, so it made her happy to see Sakie enjoying herself.\u201cThis is one of the things that\u2019s possible because you brought us together, Ryuichi-kun. It\u2019s such a joy to see my mother enjoying herself so much, you know?\u201d\u201cMmm, Shizuna~. \u266a\u201dIt seemed Sakie had heard what Shizuna had just said, and she embraced her with all her might. She shyly accepted Sakie\u2019s embrace, but Ryuichi did not miss her frown at the smell of alcohol.\u201cRyuichi. \u266a\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kuuun. \u266a\u201dChisa and Satsuki hugged Ryuichi from both sides, and Ryuichi obediently accepted them with a troubled look on his face. Well, it wasn\u2019t like they would keep drinking forever, and in the end, since they didn\u2019t want to keep bothering the two, they slowed the pace at which they drank and resumed their meal.\u201cThere are so many girls by your side, Ryuichi-kun. Chisa-san and Satsuki-san are good girls, too.\u201dPutting aside whether they were good girls or not, Ryuichi agreed that they were definitely good people. At any rate, he\u2019d known Chisa for a long time, and it was a well-known fact that he and Satsuki had formed a deep relationship with each other despite having only known each other for a short amount of time.\u201cOh, right, how have you been doing since then, Satsuki?\u201d\u201cSince then? \u2026Ah, you mean my brother?\u201dAt Chisa\u2019s question, Satsuki replied in a completely uninterested tone, so it was clear that she held no affection for Akira anymore. He\u2019d known this, but he felt a little sorry for Akira knowing that he was constantly glaring at Ryuichi, believing in that one-in-a-million chance.No, he doesn\u2019t deserve any sort of pity. Not after he tried to attack his own blood-related sister.\u201cEven though I haven\u2019t really talked about it, my father and mother are starting to notice about Akira\u2026and they\u2019re asking me a lot of questions.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dApparently, her family knew about it to some extent. However, because they were family, they weren\u2019t able to take any harsh measures, and although he thought that was too lenient of them, it was a family matter, so it was difficult for him to interfere. However, it seemed no matter what happened, they wouldn\u2019t tell Akira about Satsuki\u2019s apartment or ask her to come back to her parents home, not even for a little while.\u201cI think leaving things like this is good for now. It might be optimistic of me to think that time will solve the problem, but I think this is for the best right now.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dHe was sure that Satsuki must\u2019ve had her own thoughts about things, but she seemed to have gained some courage since meeting with Chisa more often. She used to be a person who was easily influenced by others, but now she had the strength to assert herself.\u201cThough it\u2019s been a long and winding journey, it\u2019s thank to your guidance that things turned out this way, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cMe again?\u201dRyuichi told her he didn\u2019t want her tying everything back to him and reached for his chopsticks. The women laughed at his effort to hide his embarrassment, and when he grumbled that there was no way that was the case, they made fun of him even more, putting him at a disadvantage.In a sense, this atmosphere was what Ryuichi had feared, but even so, it did not make him feel unpleasant. That was probably due in part to the warmth of the atmosphere, and also because he trusted everyone.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55A Memory For EveryoneTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Who would\u2019ve thought they\u2019d turn out like that, huh?\u201d\u201cYup\u2026 It\u2019s a pretty novel scene.\u201dSakie and Satsuki were closely clinging to each other as they slept in front of Ryuichi and Shizuna. Despite neither of them coming off as heavyweight drinkers, they had drunk at a considerably fast pace, perhaps being carried away by the jovial atmosphere, which led to their current state.\u201cFufu, one\u2019s a college student, and the other\u2019s a mother\u2026 They look like they\u2019re sisters.\u201d\u201cWell, she does look really young for a mom.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s also plenty youthful on the inside,\u201d Ryuichi remarked as he laughed. But indeed, as Chisa said, the sight of Satsuki and Sakie sleeping really did make them look like sisters. As for Shizuna, hearing those words gave her mixed feelings, but she was definitely happy to see the two women getting along like this.\u201cBut putting that aside, I think it\u2019s about time you stop, too, Chisa.\u201d\u201cYep. This one\u2019s my last.\u201dAlthough she\u2019d drunk more booze than Satsuki and Sakie, she still seemed plenty sober and looked as if she had plenty of room to spare, just as he\u2019d come to expect of her. Though, she did often come to his apartment in a drunken state, which made him shudder at the thought of how much she must\u2019ve drank then.\u201cYou know, I think you two really suit each other.\u201d\u201cThank you. \u266a\u201dChisa said those words while gazing at Ryuichi and Shizuna. Shizuna thanked her happily, so it seemed that in a way, Chisa was like an older sister to Shizuna too. Although it hadn\u2019t been that long since they\u2019d met, they had exchanged contact information, and Ryuichi knew that they were quite close.\u201cBut, Shizuna-chan, are you really okay with this?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dChisa\u2019s slightly serious expression made Shizuna\u2019s eyes widen in surprise.\u201cI\u2019m talking about how even though you\u2019ve officially become Ryuichi\u2019s girlfriend, he\u2019s still going to continue his relationships with all of us.\u201d\u201cAh, that. That\u2019s totally fine with me\u2026 In fact, the one thing I don\u2019t want to see is you and Satsuki-san leaving Ryuichi-kun\u2019s side.\u201dShizuna closed her eyes and continued speaking as if she was thinking about something.\u201cChisa-san, you and all the other girls are very important to me, just as you all are important to Ryuichi, even though I met you guys through him. Even if this relationship paradigm isn\u2019t right, I\u2019m okay with it because I care about you and the others, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThis time it was Chisa whose eyes widened in surprise at Shizuna\u2019s words. Ryuichi, who was standing beside her, gave a wry smile at how this was just how she was, but was also amazed at how overly kind she was.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re too kind, you silly girl.\u201d\u201cWawa?!\u201dChisa then hugged Shizuna. Again, Shizuna frowned for an instant at the smell of alcohol from her, but she hugged her back nonetheless, wrapping her arms around her back so that she could feel her warmth.\u201cBoth of us have fallen for a pretty troublesome man, huh?\u201d\u201cBut I think the way he troubles us is also one of his charms.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019ve definitely got a point there.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dEven though it was already late at night, Shizuna and Chisa started to converse excitedly as if to say the night\u2019s only just begun. Well, they\u00a0were\u00a0all planning to stay the night at Shizuna\u2019s place today, so it didn\u2019t matter how late they stayed up, but at the rate things were going, he would be left out with nothing to do for the whole time.\u201c\u2026Well, I guess it\u2019s nice to just look at them like this too.\u201dHe decided to sit on the sofa and gaze at Shizuna and Chisa. However, though he had somewhat rested in Shizuna\u2019s lap earlier that evening, he was assailed by a wave of leftover fatigue from all the noise and fuss that had been kicked up by the festivities. Before he knew it, he\u2019d already fallen asleep, though the next time he\u2019d reopen his eyes would be when he felt an indescribable sensation.\u201c\u2026Ah?\u201dAn inexplicable sensation permeated his body, and Ryuichi\u2019s gaze naturally drifted to his own crotch area. There, he found Shizuna and Chisa crouched down and\u2026well, it was easy to imagine what they were doing to him.\u201cOh, he\u2019s up, Shizuna-chan.\u201d\u201c~~~~!!\u201dSatsuki and Sakie were still asleep, but Ryuichi let out a sigh and scratched his head, wondering if it was too late for him to be amazed at how audacious they had to be doing something like this in the living room. It didn\u2019t displease him in the slightest, but he lightly gave Shizuna and Chisa a chop to their head as a way to get back at them for doing whatever they wanted to him while he was sleeping.\u201cOuchies.\u201d\u201cOww.\u201dAlthough he tried not to hurt them, they both puffed out their cheeks while holding the spot where their heads had been chopped. They were so perfectly in sync with each other that Ryuichi wanted to say, \u201cYou two\u00a0look like sisters when you do that,\u201d and he unconsciously reached his hand out to them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u266a\u266a\u201d\u201cGeez. Even though you\u2019re younger than me, I still love it when you stroke me like this.\u201dRyuichi then continued stroking the girls\u2019 heads until they were satisfied. It was growing later and later into the night, so it was time for them to clean up; however, they decided to simply wash everything up and leave the rest for the next morning.\u201cAlright.\u201dFirst, he carried Sakie, who was still sleeping, in his arms and took her to her room. She seemed to be in a deep sleep and did not wake up, only making some slight movements in her sleep, which was a relief to Ryuichi. Next, he picked up Satsuki, whereupon she woke up.\u201c\u2026Fuwaa, it\u2019s Ryuichi-kunn. \u266a\u201d\u201cH-Hey\u2026\u201dHer eyes were drowsily intoxicated, and she put her arms around his neck. He decided to let Satsuki do what she wanted for a while, adjusting his arm that was carrying her to make sure she didn\u2019t fall.\u201cA princess carry~\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to experience this.\u201d\u201cHrm, but I can\u2019t keep doing this, y\u2019know? It tires my arms.\u201d\u201cMuu, are you saying that I\u2019m heavyy?\u201d\u201cDid you know, Satsuki; big breasts weigh a ton?\u201d\u201cOf course I know that! There\u2019ve been many times I\u2019ve had stiff shoulders because of them!\u201dIt seemed she knew, too.She wasn\u2019t fully awake and looked somewhat sleepy, but she looked as if she was desperately pleading with Ryuichi to take care of her with her eyes\u2026 Well, it was a very cute figure.\u201cRyuichi-kun, I want to kiss yo\u2014\u201dBefore she could finish those words, Ryuichi stole her lips. Satsuki\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, but her aggressive side took over as she inserted her tongue into his mouth. It was hard to imagine from her usual docile self, but it actually wasn\u2019t strange for her aggressive side, which she usually kept hidden, to show in full force when she did these kinds of things with Ryuichi.\u201cIt\u2019s late, you know\u2026 We\u2019ll continue this next time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you off for today then~\u2026 Ehehe. \u266a\u201dSatisfied with the kiss she just received, Satsuki giggled and closed her eyes. As she began to breathe peacefully in her sleep, Ryuichi headed to the room where Shizuna and Chisa were preparing the futons.\u201cI\u2019ve brought the Sleeping Beauty.\u201d\u201cThanks for helping to carry her.\u201dHe put Satsuki, who was still sleeping, on the futon and left the room, leaving the rest to Chisa. Both of them seemed to have brought a change of clothes with them, but Satsuki had fallen asleep before she could change, to say nothing of Chisa, so he was looking forward to seeing what they would look like tomorrow. He then made his way to Shizuna\u2019s room with Shizuna, and once they were alone, she hugged him as if she\u2019d been waiting for this moment.\u201cHow was today?\u201d\u201cIt was really fun\u2026 It\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it? To have get-togethers with people like this.\u201d\u201cYeah. I like all the noise and the lively atmosphere, too.\u201dRyuichi also liked to get together with people he felt comfortable with, no matter the venue. Whether it was at his own home, someone else\u2019s home, the club, or anywhere else, it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cI hope we can plan another get-together. It was nice to have dinner together with everybody, and I had so much fun just talking and chatting with each other.\u201d\u201cI agree. We should meet up again sometime.\u201dNaturally, they had to make sure that everyone\u2019s schedule aligned with each other\u2019s and that no one was overburdened wherever they gathered.Today\u2019s event was, in a sense, a celebration for the end of the final exam for Ryuichi and Shizuna, but there was no doubt that everyone had had a great time.Thus, one of the major events before their summer vacation came to an end, but needless to say, it became one of the most cherished memories for both Ryuichi and Shizuna.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dFor an instant, Ryuichi felt something flit by his heart, telling him of a premonition, but he shook his head and wondered if it was his imagination.Just as he\u2019d told Satsuki, it was late at night, so Ryuichi and Shizuna went straight to bed today.When the two awoke the next morning, they encountered a hellish scene, but\u2026that was a story for another time.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56The Manager Watches Him Closely TooTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrThe results of the final exam were handed out before the summer vacation. Some were happy, others despaired, but among them, Ryuichi was looking over his results without any particular change in expression.\u201c\u2026All thanks to my study session with Shizuna, huh.\u201dOverall, his scores were even better than in previous tests. It was nice to see that his studies with Shizuna had paid off, and he was happy to see the results of his labor in concrete numbers.\u201cSupplementary lessons\u2026 I\u2019ve got supplementary lessons\u2026\u201d\u201cHang in there, man.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 I should\u2019ve studied harder\u2026\u201dHis classmate in the seat next to him was devastated with despair, and Ryuichi too muttered, \u201cHang in there,\u201d in his heart.As he was looking at his results like this, his eyes met Shizuna\u2019s, who was talking with her friends at a faraway seat.\u201c?\u201dThe instant their eyes met, she beckoned him with her hand, seemingly telling him to come over. Thinking back, this was her first time calling out to him like this, since she had always been the one to come to Ryuichi.\u201cHeyo, Shishido-kun~.\u201d\u201cHow did you do?\u201dHaving been asked this question by Shizuna\u2019s friends who he\u2019d come to be acquainted with through her, Ryuichi readily spread his results on the desk, having nothing in particular to be embarrassed about.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so smart even though you\u2019re a delinquent.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to add the delinquent part, did you?\u201dAll of her friends were spouting rude things, but Ryuichi was already used to hearing that. Plus, Shizuna was laughing happily with her hand over her mouth, and once he saw her smile, he felt no need to retort at them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Hnng.\u201dAs he was staring at Shizuna, each of the girls suddenly blushed and cast their gazes downward. He wondered what was wrong with them, and they looked at Ryuichi and said this:\u201cWhat can I say\u2026 Shishido really is one hell of a hottie, huh.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. The look on his face when he was staring at Shizuna just now\u2026 It was so badass and crazy cool.\u201d\u201cFufu, Ryuichi-kun\u2019s always cool. \u266a\u201dSince it was a well-known fact that Ryuichi and Shizuna were dating, her friends laughed happily when she fondly spoke of him like this.Well, the matter of the fact was, although Sohei had been the one who was closest to Shizuna, they never ended up going out, so it was as if Shizuna had never had a man in her life.\u201cShizuna\u2019s a total beauty herself. I\u2019ll never get tired of staring at her.\u201d\u201cHyuu~ \u266a\u201d\u201cWow. \u266a\u201d\u201c! \u2026Oh you, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d said that to get back at her for calling him cool, but Shizuna\u2019s face reddened at his words as she happily hit his chest. Finding even that gesture of hers cute, the girls couldn\u2019t resist hugging her.\u201cYou\u2019re too cute, Shizuna!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t anymore\u2026 Hey, Shishido, gimme Shizuna please.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Shizuna\u2019s my girl.\u201d\u201cKya! \u266a\u201dRyuichi pulled Shizuna\u2019s arm toward him a little forcefully. He felt bad for applying a bit too much force, but the joy in Shizuna\u2019s voice seemed to indicate that he did not need to worry about that. There were still many students in the classroom, and as such, some of the girls blushed when Ryuichi embraced Shizuna, who was arguably the most beautiful girl in the class.\u201c\u2026Well, I guess I should\u2019ve expected this would happen now that I\u2019ve changed.\u201d\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re a knight protecting a princess.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m a knight, how upstanding and righteous would a\u00a0real\u00a0knight have to be?\u201d\u201cPufu?!\u201dShizuna laughed at Ryuichi\u2019s words. No one would have any qualms about Shizuna being called a princess, but as for him being a knight, even he did not want to imagine himself as that.\u201cFufu, if I have you protecting me, I\u2019d feel safe against any opponent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you gotta put that joke to rest,\u201d his tired expression seemed to say. However, Shizuna and her friends seemed to think they should expand on the topic further.\u201cBut you know, if Shishido was a knight, what do you think his weapon would be? A regular sword?\u201d\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be wielding a sword. He\u2019d be wielding an axe or a hammer, for sure.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s true. He\u2019d let his strength do all the talking!\u201d\u201cYup!\u201d\u201c\u2026Y\u2019all are saying whatever you want now, huh.\u201dIncidentally, there was a time when Ryuichi too had had a penchant for all things fantasy. Although it hadn\u2019t been as bad as the infamous\u00a0chuunibyou\u00a0phase, he\u2019d been inspired by a certain manga and looked up to swords as weapons. But, that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s head home.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe went out into the hallway with Shizuna. In doing so, he ran into Sohei, but he was, as expected, different now.\u201cSee you later, Shishido, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cSee ya.\u201d\u201cYup. See you later, Sohei-kun.\u201dSohei had restored his relationship with not just Ryuichi, but also Shizuna to some extent. It was almost as if he\u2019d become a different person, and perhaps he\u2019d thought about how his relationship with Shizuna should be as he\u2019d now gone back to being proper childhood friends with her.It was no longer a matter of whether or not he was going out with Shizuna, it was about respecting what they had with each other now because they\u2019d been together for a long time and were very close to each other.\u201cYou look happy, huh?\u201d\u201cEh? Really?\u201dRyuichi said this to Shizuna, whose cheeks were happily slackened. She thought for a moment, glanced at Sohei as he left, and continued her words.\u201cI\u2019ve been together with him since I was a little girl. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy now that things have turned out like this. He even sent me a message telling me to be happy with you, you know?\u201d\u201cReally, now?\u201dHe was honestly surprised because he hadn\u2019t known that. It was true that Sohei had said something similar to him when they went to the club together the other day, but he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d tell that to Shizuna.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d\u201cYup. Falling in love with him is an entirely different matter, though.\u201d\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be helped, can it?\u201d Ryuichi gave a wry smile.Now then, school had ended for the day, but Ryuichi still had his part-time job to do.\u201cTime to work my ass off at work again today!\u201d\u201cGood luck, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBecause me and my mom will be visiting today.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dHe thought he\u2019d misheard her, but apparently that wasn\u2019t the case. He had been looking forward to having a peaceful day of regular, hard work since Chisa and Satsuki had no plans to visit today, but apparently that wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201cYou\u2019re really coming?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dWith this, it seemed that it was set in stone that the two would come together. Ryuichi dropped her off at her home and from there he immediately headed for the club.\u201cYo.\u201d\u201cHey, Ryuichi. You\u2019re here.\u201dThe manager, who was sitting on the sofa watching TV, noticed his arrival. After setting down his bag and making some preparations, Ryuichi sat down next to him, as he still had some time to spare.\u201cHere.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dHe handed Ryuichi some chocolate, and Ryuichi thanked him as he threw it in his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ve become more honest too, huh. In the past, when I tried to give you sweets like this, you wouldn\u2019t accept them.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did I?\u201dIndeed, when he thought back on it, he felt that that had been the case. It may have been because Ryuichi wasn\u2019t the type of person who liked sweets much in the first place, but the fact that he was starting to eat sweets like this was probably due in large part to the fact that he was spending time with Shizuna.\u201cWhenever I go to her house or she comes to mine, she always offers me sweets. Maybe that has something to do with it, too.\u201d\u201cI see. Heh, I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s a good cook too, so she must really know you well.\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be a match for her for the rest of my life.\u201dIf he told this to Shizuna, she would probably tell him that that wasn\u2019t true, but Ryuichi really felt that way about her. The manager patted Ryuichi\u2019s head strongly, saying that that part of him had changed too, but Ryuichi strangely did not brush it off.\u201cYou have a large build and a stern face, but a lot of people really cherish you. I\u2019m sure you already know you\u2019re popular with older people, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWell, sorta.\u201d\u201cSure, you\u2019re a bad kid. But to be honest, there\u2019s a kind of parental love in me that really wants you to overcome a lot of things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m half-grateful and half-jealous that it wasn\u2019t me, but women you met later in life who showed you that.\u201dRyuichi stood up and told the manager, who\u2019d created a gloomy atmosphere, that he was grossed out.\u201c\u2026Y\u2019know, I really appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me, boss.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna head to the toilet.\u201dHe was still embarrassed when it came to expressing his gratitude, especially when it was to someone who had been taking care of him for so long. Flustered by the warmth of the manager\u2019s gaze, he headed for the restroom as if to run away.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57\u201cOh yeah, Shishido, you got any plans for summer vacation\u2026wait, you probably do, huh.\u201d\u201cOf course he does. It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend like us.\u201d\u201c\u2026Dammit, I\u2019m so jealous.\u201dOn the last day of school before summer vacation, Ryuichi was surrounded by many of his classmates. \u2018Many\u2019 in this case only meant five people, but still, even though they hadn\u2019t interacted with each other at all until recently, they were now naturally conversing with each other. It seemed that the change in his atmosphere and him becoming a softer person had helped, and looking at him this way, he seemed sort of like a central figure in the class in some respects.\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna talk like that, you should at least make an effort to get a girlfriend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Guh, hearing that from someone who\u00a0does\u00a0have a girlfriend hits differently.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s speaking facts, though\u2026 I\u2019m gonna do my best this summer.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201dThey clenched their fists in the air with enthusiasm, knowing that a girlfriend wouldn\u2019t just fall into their hands while doing nothing, and that if they wanted to get a girlfriend, they had to act.\u201cBut y\u2019know, you seem like\u00a0the\u00a0guy to go to for love advice and stuff, Shishido.\u201dThis remark came from Sohei, one of the people in the group. Ever since that day, he\u2019d hung out by Ryuichi\u2019s side more often, and they had had a lot more opportunities to talk with each other like this.\u00a0I seriously can\u2019t get used to this peculiar sight,\u00a0he thought as he gave a wry smile and told them not to ask someone like him for advice on love.\u201cRather than asking me, you should go to Makoto or Kaname for advice.\u201d\u201cYou called?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201dMakoto and Kaname, who were nearby, reacted when they heard their names called. They didn\u2019t have girlfriends like Ryuichi did, but they were also used to handling women and had a lot of experience with them. Ryuichi was similar to them, but he was more focused on his time with Shizuna now, so it was unlikely that he could offer much advice.\u201cOh right, Shinozaki, are you still going good with your regular gang?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Well, a lot of stuff happened.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThe \u201cregular gang\u201d he was referring to comprised Akira and his friends. Ryuichi was curious to know what had happened with them, since he hadn\u2019t seen them together much recently, so he asked.Even now, they\u2026 Akira was looking at him with a very displeased look in his eyes.\u201cWell, if anything happens, just tell me.\u201d\u201cSorry, and thanks.\u201dHe could somewhat guess what had happened, but he certainly didn\u2019t want to get involved with him either because it would be troublesome.Seeing how obstinately clingy and obsessed he was made Ryuichi think\u2026\u00a0If I ever get the chance to talk to him again, I\u2019ll tell him off strongly. It\u2019s for his sake, too.\u201c\u2026Geez, this world\u2019s seriously a sinful one.\u201dIn the world of erotic manga, incest was something that was made to be commonplace, but it was a bit difficult to ask people to accept it in the real world.Well, Ryuichi, who had a girlfriend in Shizuna while also having relationships with many other women, may not be in a position to say that, but even so, he certainly had his own thoughts on the matter.\u201cShall we get going, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWhile they were talking like this, Shizuna approached Ryuichi. Everyone exclaimed, \u201cMy, my, the princess is coming through,\u201d and made way for her, and Ryuichi chuckled at the sight of Shizuna, who tilted her head in confusion while walking proudly between them.\u201cA princess, huh.\u201d\u201cWhat is going on here\u2026?\u201d\u201cHeh, things really have changed for you two, haven\u2019t they?\u201dAt Makoto\u2019s words, Ryuichi replied, \u201cYep,\u201d in agreement as he left the classroom with Shizuna in tow.\u201cI still don\u2019t get it\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, all you need to know is that a bunch of stuff happened.\u201dHe stroked her head without using too much force. She complained that he was messing up her hair, but she seemed to be happy to be stroked like this and smiled at him.After leaving the school, he thought about what they should do today, and decided to head to a nearby park to relax a bit.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dAs he walked with Shizuna, he happened upon a certain familiar sight\u2014it was the sight of people in trouble he often came across.\u201c\u2026Aww.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, you gotta let it go.\u201dThere were two young kids, one boy and one girl, who were looking at a balloon stuck in a tree. They were likely siblings from the looks of it, but the girl\u2019s gaze remained fixed at the balloon and she didn\u2019t move at all.\u201cThis does happen a lot\u2026isn\u2019t something I can say, huh.\u201d\u201cYup. This is the kind of stuff that usually comes up in mangas and animes.\u201dAs was the case with the old lady who\u2019d dropped her fruits some time ago, Ryuichi really did come across these kinds of scenes a fair bit. And if he thought about it, even before he regained his memories of his previous life, he had a feeling he\u2019d helped people like this before\u2026 It was only a feeling, though.\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, too. To make sure you don\u2019t terrify those kids.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, please.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s intimidating face would certainly be too much for young children to bear. In that case, there was nothing more reassuring than to have Shizuna there to help calm them down in his stead.\u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs they approached, the two naturally noticed their presence. The girl hid behind the boy\u2019s back, and the boy had a blank look on his face as he stared at Ryuichi.\u201cYou can\u2019t get it, can you? Well, lemme try my hand at it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cFufu, leave it to this Onii-san.\u201dRyuichi laughed and told them he\u2019d actually been good at climbing trees as a child. Still, he took care to steadily climb up the tree to avoid breaking any branches, and eventually he managed to retrieve the balloon. After taking the balloon, he carefully climbed down the tree so that it would not pop, and handed it to the girl who had stopped hiding before he knew it.\u201cHere, got it.\u201dHe smiled as reassuringly as he could, and the girl accepted the balloon in a daze.\u201c\u2026Thank you, Onii-chan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on, Ryuichi-kun, you\u2019re getting too sentimental.\u201dRyuichi looked at Shizuna and said, \u201cOf course I would be.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unusual for him to be thanked like this, but it still felt good to hear those words from a young child who was particularly sensitive to others\u2019 ill will.\u201c\u2026Onii-chan, you were awesome!\u201d\u201cOh, looks like you get it, kid.\u201dWhen he patted him on the head, the boy giggled and smiled brightly. As he parted from the kids, he thought to himself again, \u201cSeeing others smile from your own good actions really does feel good.\u201d\u201cPhew.\u201d\u201cHere, have some juice.\u201d\u201cOh, thanks.\u201dShe\u2019d likely bought the juice from a nearby vending machine as she handed it to him. He opened the lid of his favorite carbonated juice that he always drank, and a pleasant fizzing sound rang out.\u201cYou\u2019re such a kind person, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dShizuna quietly muttered those words. Ryuichi turned to look at her, wondering where that remark had come from, but she continued to speak, staring at him intently.\u201cYou always\u2026well, maybe not always, but I think you really do help all sorts of people like that, Ryuichi-kun. It makes me proud to be your girlfriend, and at the same time, it makes me want to continue supporting you from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dIt was the summer season, so naturally the air was sultry and hot, but she leaned in close to lay her head on Ryuichi\u2019s shoulder. Nevertheless, Ryuichi wasn\u2019t so tactless as to tell her to get away just because of the heat.\u201cI, for one, think that you and the girls helped to change me into the person I am today, though.\u201d\u201cNo. You were always this kind to begin with, Ryuichi-kun. It\u2019s just that people are starting to notice that now.\u201dIt was precisely because of her complete trust in him that Shizuna was able to speak like this about Ryuichi. As he\u2019d mentioned just now, it was definitely because of the connections he\u2019d made with Shizuna and many others that he was able to become the way he was now.\u201c\u2026Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never let you go, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201cYup, I know. I\u2019ll never leave your side, either.\u201dShe kissed him as she said this while staring into his face. She no longer had any reservations about kissing, and she responded in kind whenever and wherever he asked for it.Ryuichi felt as if his old self lurking deep inside was whispering to him to devour her even as they were outside, but of course, the current him had no interest in doing that.\u201cKissing is so nice. It makes me so happy and warm\u2026 Well, it\u00a0is\u00a0summer now, so it might make things too hot.\u201d\u201cFor sure. Well, we have our summer vacation ahead of us, so it\u2019ll get even hotter from now on, in more ways than one.\u201d\u201cNothing could make me happier to hear. I want to do more and more things with you, Ryuichi-kun\u2026so please dye me more and more with your colors, okay?\u201dHe was sure she neither intended it nor was aware of it. However, the way she looked at him seductively, and her alluring words to match\u2026it was almost as if she\u2019d reenacted the manga world that only Ryuichi knew, yet there was also a contradiction in a good way that reassured him that her unique colors were still there, unceasingly shining.\u201cI\u2019m really glad I met you.\u201d\u201c! \u2026I love you. \u266a\u201dAs has been said many times before, they were originally destined to be related to each other in the worst possible way\u2026as the villain and the heroine, but by deepening their bonds with each other like this, their relationship had progressed to a point where no one could break them apart.Although it was a change that had been brought about by a single deviation at the start, it was also a fate that would lead to a greater happiness for Ryuichi and Shizuna. Needless to say, there was a sense of security that made one feel that the two of them\u2026.no, even the people around them would be okay no matter what happened from now on, as long as they were together.After all, the journey ahead for the two of them led not to darkness, but a shining future.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58What Do People Essentially Do During Summer Vacation?Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cAll right, Mom, I\u2019ll be going out now.\u201d\u201cTake care.\u201dOn a certain day during summer vacation, Shizuna left her home and went outside on a day when the temperature was quite high, if not blazing hot. It was only about nine o\u2019clock in the morning, but it was already very hot.\u201cIt\u2019s so hot\u2026but then again, it\u00a0is\u00a0summer, so I guess that\u2019s to be expected.\u201dShizuna muttered to herself as she started walking toward the home of her beloved boyfriend. Coincidentally, it was at that moment that Sohei too came out of his house as if he was going somewhere.\u201cAh, morning, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Sohei-kun.\u201dThey had originally been close with each other, but Ryuichi\u2019s appearance had soured their relationship, though things had cleared up between them now. She laughed at how it was Ryuichi as well who\u2019d brought them the opportunity to face each other as normal childhood friends, and that he was truly a mysterious person.\u201cWere you thinking about Shishido again?\u201d\u201cOh, you can tell?\u201d\u201cYeah. Because when you smile like that, it\u2019s usually related to Shishido.\u201d\u201c\u2026Muu, am I really that obvious?\u201dThat said, she didn\u2019t deny him either. Poking him lightly with an amused smile, she left him and started walking again.\u201c\u2026Fuu.\u201dIn truth, she\u2019d actually had no plans to visit Ryuichi today. Normally, they would have called each other that day or the day before, but she thought it\u2019d be nice to have days like these every once in a while too. She wouldn\u2019t be angry if he had something to do or if he was not home, she would just do a little shopping and go home.\u201cHmm~ hmm~ hmm~ \u266a\u201dShe looked very happy as she walked down the road in a good mood.Naturally, she wasn\u2019t wearing her usual school uniform, but she was dressed casually in a gray top that boldly showed her shoulders, and pants that gave off a refreshing feeling.Many passersby stared at her as she displayed both the adorableness of a high school student and the sexiness of a young adult transitioning to adulthood.\u201cHey, little girl, are ya free?\u201d\u201cNo, I am not. I\u2019m on my way to my boyfriend\u2019s place right now.\u201dShe used to hate and even fear getting called out to like this. However, she had grown completely accustomed to it because she had gained some courage by spending time with Ryuichi, and more importantly, she often saw men worse than this one when she visited Ryuichi at the club where he worked part-time.\u201cNow, now, you don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being annoying, you know?\u201dShizuna glared at the man who was picking her up. Although she wasn\u2019t really conscious of it, her glare seemed to have been quite a shock to the man, and he froze, even if only for a moment. Taking advantage of this opportunity, she backed away from the man.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve gotten braver than before. Yup, yup, not bad.\u201dShe might\u2019ve still gotten scared if they\u2019d touched her body like last time, but at the very least, she wouldn\u2019t get flustered by a mere playboy. It did make her a little sad that she would never be able to be saved like she\u2019d been when she\u2019d encountered Ryuichi back then, though.\u201c\u2026Ah, but what would I do if\u00a0Ryuichi-kun\u00a0was hit on?\u201dRyuichi was the type of handsome guy who was popular with older women. Recently, his true nature had become apparent at school, and he had more friends and could be seen conversing with a good number of girls in his class, including Shizuna\u2019s friends. She wasn\u2019t jealous of this, however, and as a result of her strange maternal nature, she\u2019d watched over him with a somewhat pleasant feeling in her heart.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dFor the time being, she put the class aside and pondered over the matter intently. In her opinion, hitting on Ryuichi would be quite the challenge and would only be possible with a woman who was confident in herself.In the first place, she felt like if someone hit on Ryuichi with half-hearted determination, they\u2019d be melted into a soggy mess in no time\u2026No, she was\u00a0sure\u00a0they would be melted into a soggy mess. The thought of it made her laugh.\u201cWell, here I am, but\u2026\u201dShe\u2019d been immersed in her thoughts and before she knew it, she had reached his apartment. There was no sign that he had gone out anywhere, so she assumed he was probably inside.\u201c\u2026Oh? It\u2019s open.\u201dShe took out the duplicate key that he\u2019d given to her and tried to unlock the door, but apparently the door was already unlocked and open.\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen she entered, she found a pair of shoes she did not recognize. Since they were men\u2019s shoes and not women\u2019s, she thought that perhaps Makoto or Kaname had come to visit.\u201cPardon me for the intrusion, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dWhen she announced her arrival, Ryuichi appeared from inside the room. She felt sorry for disturbing him, seeing as how he was completely enjoying his time off in short sleeves and short pants, but he himself only seemed surprised for a moment before he immediately walked up to Shizuna.\u201cMorning, Shizuna\u2026 Pretty sudden of you, huh.\u201d\u201cSorry. But I wanted to see you.\u201d\u201cHeh, you don\u2019t have to apologize. I\u2019m glad to see you.\u201dWith that, Ryuichi pulled Shizuna into his arms. She loved burying her face in his sturdy chest, and was twenty times happier when she was surrounded by his masculine scent like this. They both laughed simultaneously when they thought about how they shouldn\u2019t stay hugging each other at the entrance of the apartment for too long.\u201cYou got a visitor?\u201d\u201cYep. To be honest, Kaname has been here since yesterday. He slept over.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cHey, just so you know, it goes without saying that there\u2019s\u00a0nothing\u00a0between us, alright?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dShe probably knew that they\u2019d gotten in this situation because they\u2019d played around in that place, along with Makoto. They moved into the room where Kaname was watching TV while reading manga leisurely, and his eyes widened when he saw Shizuna appear.\u201cRindo? You two had plans to meet today?\u201d\u201cNah, she just came on a whim.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dShe sat there with them. She was surrounded by two guys, her boyfriend and his friend, but again, she didn\u2019t seem particularly bothered by it. When she\u2019d asked Kaname for his side of the story, what she heard was exactly as she\u2019d expected. After the three of them had spent the night having fun in the city, Kaname missed the last train, so he came to stay here.\u201cWhat do you think he was doing while me and Makoto were having fun with the girls?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe was having hamburgers all by himself at a nearby restaurant.\u201d\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Ryuichi spat. He no longer had relationships with many women, save for Chisa and Satsuki with whom he continued his relationship unchanged, but that was something everyone had already accepted. Even so, the amount of times he slept with them was dwindling, so it was only natural that one could tell he found Shizuna special.\u201cWell, I think I\u2019m gonna get going now. It\u2019s a bit awkward for me to be third-wheeling you two lovers.\u201d\u201cI see. Off with you then.\u201dKaname then quickly packed his bags and left. Thus, Shizuna was alone with Ryuichi, just as she\u2019d hoped for, and she jumped on his body again just as the door slammed shut.\u201cOof\u2026 Heh, you\u2019re a needy girl, aren\u2019tcha?\u201d\u201cOnly for you, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dThey hugged each other for a while, and then Ryuichi suddenly let out a gasp and spread a printout on the table. It was an assignment given for the summer vacation, in other words, homework.\u201cThere\u2019s a part here that\u2019s got me a little stumped. Can you help me?\u201d\u201cSure. Which part is it?\u201dShe finished the problem that he\u2019d told her stumped him as if it were a breeze in the park and left the apartment with Ryuichi, who had finished his preparations in the meantime. They walked together in the heat as usual, but they obviously didn\u2019t link their arms this time.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s hot, huh.\u201d\u201cReally hot.\u201dIt was well and truly hot. Still, leaving Ryuichi aside, Shizuna did not seem uncomfortable at all and continued to enjoy staring at him amusedly by her side. Well, there was a time in the past that she\u2019d stared at him too much that she almost slipped and fell, so he told her to try to keep it to a minimum, but apparently she couldn\u2019t stop herself from the act of staring at the person she loved.\u201cHey, Shizuna\u2014\u201d\u201cSliiide~\u00a0\u266a\u201dAn elderly man walking in front of them came into view, and Ryuichi called out to her to warn her not to bump into him, but she was well aware of him. She moved her body to the side to avoid the old man, who was propped up on a cane.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can see everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you some kind of final boss?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a final boss that\u2019s undefeatable if I\u2019ve appeared after capturing you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dThe heck is that?\u00a0Ryuichi laughed.This was their first summer vacation since the two of them got a boyfriend or girlfriend, but it would surely prove to be a fulfilling one, that\u2019s for sure. Just thinking about what they should do, where they should go, and other such things was enough to make Shizuna happy and smiling the entire time.\u201cMan, seeing you like that makes me happy, too.\u201dTheir long vacation had only just begun. Shizuna was excited and happy to be able to spend a long time with her boyfriend, and had high hopes for what was to come.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Finally, a Conclusion for This Matter TooTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrThere was a certain couple who was having a conversation.\u201cHey, did\u2019ja hear?\u201d\u201cHear what?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s this girl who just moved in next door, and she\u2019s one hell of a beauty.\u201d\u201c\u2026You know, you must really have some nerve to say that in front of your girlfriend.\u201dThe woman responded to the man\u2019s words in a disgusted manner. It was certainly as the woman had said; calling another woman beautiful despite having a girlfriend was\u2026well, it depended on the situation, but it was certainly something to be frowned upon.The man apologized and proceeded to explain why he\u2019d brought this up.\u201cBut, you know, it looks like she actually has a partner.\u201d\u201cHmm? And?\u201d\u201cHer partner is, well\u2026basically, the complete opposite of the girl. He looks like a total delinquent.\u201dThis was what the man said. The woman who moved in next door was a college-aged girl, and she was very pure and innocent looking. However, despite her pure and tidy appearance, her body was said to be incredibly lewd and dirty.\u201cIs that part really necessary?\u201d\u201cOww?!\u201dWell, it was only natural that the woman would hit him. But, that wasn\u2019t the point. The man\u2019s story continued.\u201cI saw her partner\u2026and, well, he\u2019s really the complete opposite of her, y\u2019know? At first I found it suspicious, but then I saw that the girl was really head over heels for him too.\u201d\u201cWell ain\u2019t that great?\u201d\u201c\u2026At first, I thought she was being pressured or threatened, but maybe I was wrong.\u201d\u201cSo she hated him at first, but then he made her fall for him and now she\u2019s head over heels for him? Something like that, you mean? There\u2019s no way such a manga-esque story is possible.\u201d\u201cThought so.\u201dBut well, the difference in appearance and atmosphere between the man and woman he was referring to\u00a0was\u00a0quite a ways apart from each other, so the man\u2019s thought process wasn\u2019t unjustified.Nevertheless, perhaps because of what she\u2019d heard from her boyfriend, the woman got a little curious too, and she hoped she would be able to see the mysterious couple someday\u2026 And it just so happened that, whether God was playing a prank or not, that encounter would happen on that very same day.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dThey left their room with the intention of having dinner outside, but it was at that moment that the mysterious couple came out from the room beside them.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I see now.\u201dThe woman looked at the two and immediately understood. The man looked every bit like a delinquent, but the woman was really meek and gentle looking, and it was no exaggeration to say that the two were polar opposites.\u2026Her boobs are massive.She was dressed comfortably and coolly for summer, but the girl\u2019s breasts were so overwhelmingly large that their size could be easily grasped even through her blouse. The woman then glanced down at her own chest. It wasn\u2019t as if hers were as flat as a wall, but in the face of such overwhelming might, it was absurd to even compare them.\u201cI see. So Shizuna-chan\u2019s together with Sakie-san today.\u201d\u201cYep. I\u2019m kind of scared to think about what they\u2019re going to talk about, just the two of them.\u201d\u201cFufu, it\u2019ll probably be about you, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, probably.\u201dThe man had a sort of yearning expression on his face. His melancholy look was somewhat heart-stirring, and the woman had a vague feeling that he was probably popular with older women.\u201cThanks for today.\u201d\u201cNo, no, I wanted to be with you too, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dThe girl walked with him, leaning against his strong, dependable body. Even though it was still a little hot at night, the woman was smiling as she wondered how much the girl must\u2019ve liked hugging the man.\u201cWe should get going too.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dWe won\u2019t lose to that couple; we\u2019re just as lovey-dovey as them,\u00a0the woman thought as she held hands with her boyfriend.Now, unaware that he was being watched by total strangers, Ryuichi ventured out into the city with Satsuki. As he\u2019d mentioned earlier, Shizuna was not by his side today. Ryuichi was thinking of spending the day alone, but he never would\u2019ve thought that Shizuna would have contacted Satsuki. Incidentally, it seemed that she\u2019d also contacted Chisa, but Chisa was going back to her parents\u2019 house today.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hot even though it\u2019s nighttime, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. Us linking arms makes it even hotter, though.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t hate it, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Damn, you really know me well, don\u2019t you?\u201dRyuichi was half-joking when he said it made it even hotter. A cool breeze blew by from time to time, so it wasn\u2019t hot enough to make one sweat, and it was actually just the right temperature for nighttime.\u201cLet\u2019s have some sushi.\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a sushi restaurant around here that I\u2019ve heard is pretty good\u2026\u201dWalking with Satsuki, he looked for the sushi restaurant and soon found it. They entered the restaurant and sat at the counter together; after ordering tea, they took the plates from the belt as they flowed by. While they enjoyed their sushi, Ryuichi suddenly mentioned this.\u201c\u2026Now that I think about it, I kinda don\u2019t know anything about Chisa\u2019s parents\u2019 home.\u201d\u201cReally? But now that you mention it, neither do I.\u201dAlthough Ryuichi has been to the apartment where Chisa lives now, he hasn\u2019t heard much about her parents\u2019 home before\u2026or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he hasn\u2019t heard\u00a0anything\u00a0at all.\u201cI\u2019m pretty cool with them, y\u2019know? But\u2026they do seem to have a problem with how free-spirited I am.\u201dHe remembered having this sort of conversation with her, but no matter how much he dug up his memory, that was the only instance he could think of. He wasn\u2019t particularly worried because at least her family wasn\u2019t a broken one like his, but Chisa has helped him many times, so if anything were to happen to her, Ryuichi would definitely try to help her.\u201c\u2026\u2019I\u2019ll definitely protect her\u2019 is what your face seems to be saying.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s really cool, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dApparently she\u2019d seen the look of determination on his face. With a giggle, Satsuki brought a characteristic egg sushi to her mouth and smiled widely at its deliciousness as she slowly chewed it.\u201cOf course, that goes for you too, y\u2019know? Now that we\u2019re a thing, I\u2019ll make sure to protect you.\u201d\u201c! \u2026Cough!\u201d\u201cHey, hey\u2026\u201dThe unexpected blow made Satsuki choke on her food. Ryuichi chuckled exasperatedly and offered her a cup of tea, which she hastily accepted and chugged down her throat. With the sushi safely down her throat, she took a deep breath in and out as if to calm herself down.\u201cIt isn\u2019t that surprising, and it\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t used to hearing that, are you?\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s not that!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cLately, you\u2019ve been very gentle, and your expression has been\u2026very kind, like it is now, Ryuichi-kun! That\u2019s why I was more startled than surprised!\u201d\u201cO-Oh\u2026 Well, just calm down for now.\u201dHe somehow managed to calm her down by putting his hand on her shoulder, because he knew causing a ruckus here would disturb the other customers. However, Ryuichi\u2019s expression was gentle enough for Satsuki to say what she did to him again. Naturally, he could not see that himself, so he could only reply to her what he did to Shizuna when Shizuna said the same thing to him.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m that different from my usual self, though.\u201d\u201cTry looking at yourself in the mirror real hard, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d\u201cHell no, that\u2019s gross.\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t want to stare at his own face for that long.After that, he and Satsuki, who had regained her composure, had a nice chat, filled up their bellies, and left the restaurant feeling satisfied. All that was left to do was drop Satsuki off at her apartment since they had nothing more to do, but it seemed that today was truly a day of destiny, this time in a different meaning.\u201c\u2026Ah, Onee-chan.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dIt was a familiar voice. They didn\u2019t even have to think about who it could be to know it was Akira.\u2026I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d chase her all the way here\u2026though on second thought, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.After thinking things that far, Ryuichi shook his head in dismissal. Although he still had distorted feelings for Satsuki, it seemed that Satsuki was being careful about what was going on around her, so naturally, Akira couldn\u2019t have known about her apartment. He had likely been on his way back from having dinner with his friends for summer vacation.\u201c\u2026You!\u201d\u201c\u2026Damn, you\u2019re such a pain in the ass.\u201dAs Akira was glaring at him, Ryuichi took his gaze away from Satsuki and glared right back at him. Although he wasn\u2019t consciously aware of it, his stern glare, which was already intimidating under normal circumstances, seemed even more intimidating than usual, and Akira took a step back as if frightened.\u201cAkira\u2026\u201dSatsuki\u2019s voice had completely changed; it wasn\u2019t one that thought of him as a younger brother, but one that sounded dismayed at him. It was as if she was implying that the evening was supposed to end on such a pleasant note after eating delicious sushi and having a good time, yet his appearance had completely soured that mood\u2026Ryuichi, however, nodded his head and thought that this might be a good opportunity.\u201cC\u2019mere, Satsuki.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201dHiding Satsuki behind his back, Ryuichi looked straight at Akira. He couldn\u2019t let this drag on forever. He wanted to give Satsuki peace of mind, and more importantly, he wanted to show Akira the reality of the situation, even though Ryuichi had no obligation to do so.\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, stop lusting after your sister like a woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026What the hell?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you realize? Because of what you did, Satsuki doesn\u2019t see you as her brother anymore.\u201dAkira looked shocked at Ryuichi\u2019s words. Ryuichi understood his feelings of disbelief and his desire to cling to the illusion that it couldn\u2019t be true, but he was too far gone if he couldn\u2019t tell what Satsuki thought of him after she was almost attacked by him, her own brother.\u201c\u2026Akira.\u201d\u201cOnee-chan\u2026\u201dAkira\u2019s body shuddered at her overwhelmingly cold voice. Satsuki then told him directly\u2026 Those words she\u2019d never said this whole time, words that urged them to part ways, even if it was painful.\u201cThat incident has created an irrevocable rift between you and me. So please, don\u2019t bother me anymore\u2014Akira-kun.\u201d\u201cWha?!\u201dSatsuki turned her back to Akira. Just like that, she pulled Ryuichi by the hand and walked away, but Akira made no attempt to follow them.\u201cI think things will be okay now that I\u2019ve said that much. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll let his emotions get the better of him and try something. He doesn\u2019t have the guts.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a bit sad, but as his sister, I at least know that much.\u201dBecause he\u2019d watched his own family fall to ruin before his very eyes, Ryuichi believed that if a little talking could help them make up with each other, then that\u2019d be good. However, there were some family relationships that became strained precisely because they needlessly spoke to each other. He felt like he\u2019d learned once again that having relationships with other people was a happiness that not only he felt.\u201cOh, right!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cShizuna told me that you rubbed her breasts to push her partner to give up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh yeah. That did happen.\u201d\u201cI was just thinking that things would\u2019ve gone much more effectively if you\u2019d done that back there, too.\u201dIt seemed that she had held a small hope for him to do that. As expected, Satsuki, too, seemed to be a bad girl in a different way from Shizuna.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60It Was a Hot Yet Warm Summer NightTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cAkira, what\u2019s wrong?!\u201d\u201cShut up!!\u201dAfter being bluntly rejected by Satsuki, Akira ran straight home. His mother called out to him to ask what was wrong as he opened the front door and took off his shoes, but Akira ran into his room without listening to her at all. He then buried his face in his bed and shed tears of frustration.\u201cDammit\u2026 Dammit!!\u201dHis tears were a materialization of his anger, which sought a place to vent that it didn\u2019t have. For a long time\u2026that is, since he was even younger, Akira had always had feelings for his own sister, Satsuki. He had given up on her because of their blood ties, but he still couldn\u2019t accept the idea of her becoming another man\u2019s property.\u201cOnee-chan\u2026 Onee-chan!!\u201dBut after being told that much, he understood, even if he didn\u2019t want to\u2014that his feelings would never reach Satsuki again.\u00a0Why did this happen, why did things turn out this way\u2026\u00a0The face of that detestable Ryuichi floated in his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s him\u2026 It\u2019s his fault!!\u201dYes, it was all Ryuichi\u2019s fault, Akira thought. The gentle Satsuki had changed because of Ryuichi\u2019s influence, seemingly identical to how Shizuna, who had been close to his best friend Sohei, had changed as well.\u201cIt\u2019s all his fault\u2026 It\u2019s all because of him!\u201dIt was truly by chance that he\u2019d seen Satsuki and Ryuichi today. Sohei hadn\u2019t been present for the gathering, but on his way back from having dinner with his friends at a family restaurant, his eyes first fell on Satsuki as she came out of a sushi restaurant\u2026and then on Ryuichi. Ryuichi had recently changed and had become popular in class, but to Akira, he was nothing more than the person who stole his beloved sister away from him.\u201cThat was delicious.\u201d\u201cYup. Having you there made the meal even more delicious, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dHe was stunned when he saw them come out of the restaurant looking intimate with each other, but of course, he immediately became angry. He couldn\u2019t stand the two of them being together, so he snapped at them, and the rest is history.\u201c\u2026Onee-chan\u2026 Why?\u201dAkira couldn\u2019t comprehend why she was with such a shitty person. The same went for Shizuna; he couldn\u2019t understand why she was with him, or even why Sohei had started talking with Ryuichi amicably lately.He couldn\u2019t understand why everybody loved him so much just because he had changed a little.\u201cOnee-chan belongs to me\u2026 She belongs to me and me alone!!\u201dHe believed that Satsuki was his, and to that end, he would never hand her over to anyone. However, thinking those thoughts always reminded him of Ryuichi\u2019s words.\u201cSatsuki isn\u2019t a belonging.\u201dThose words seemed to cut straight through Akira\u2019s heart. He wanted to object and say, \u201cWhat do you know? What do you know about me?\u201d\u2026But even so, he couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAkira wanted to monopolize the ever so fragile and ever so gentle Satsuki. He wanted to monopolize her lovely face, her large breasts, her shapely ass, and even her heart; he wanted to monopolize her all. Even though he was aware of how repulsive this idea was, Akira had thought that in the end, Satsuki would never refuse him.And yet, she\u00a0did.\u201c\u2026I won\u2019t forgive him\u2026 I won\u2019t ever forgive him!!\u201dHe would not allow anyone to tear apart the relationship he had between him and Satsuki; he would use any means possible to give Ryuichi a good beating, but ultimately, Akira was a coward through and through.He\u2019d been fine up until the moment he temporarily let his emotions get the better of him and attacked Satsuki, but after he was rejected like that, his heart gave up on doing anything else.\u201c\u2026Fuck\u2026 Fuck!\u201dFor better or worse, what Satsuki had said was on point. Akira could no longer muster the courage to do anything extreme, and could only shed tears of frustration. It was a moment of resignation\u2026a sad reality he did not want to admit, but also a farewell to the illusions he had had about his sister.\u201cI see\u2026 No, it\u2019s nothing. Yup, good night, Mom.\u201dWhile Akira was in his state of frustration and resignation, Satsuki was also calling her mother, likely out of concern for her brother. Though \u2018concern\u2019 in this case didn\u2019t necessarily mean she would give him kind words or meet him in any way; her concern only went so far as to check on him.\u201cWas he okay?\u201d\u201cYes. I think he\u2019ll probably be fine.\u201dSatsuki had said that he would never have the guts to do anything crazy and reckless, but her intuition, as one would expect from his older sister, was spot on. She put her phone away and leaped into Ryuichi\u2019s big chest, who was standing beside her. She just wanted to forget all about her brother and feel safe in his chest for now.\u201c\u2026I envy Shizuna-chan. She gets to do this with you all the time.\u201d\u201cWell, Shizuna is\u2026\u201dMy girlfriend,\u00a0he muttered. But still, regardless of the fact that Shizuna had allowed him to do this, he chuckled to himself that he really couldn\u2019t help himself from doing this in these situations. He then held her for a while until Satsuki was satisfied before pulling away and leaving her room to return to his apartment.\u201cMan, summer\u2019s just totally hot, even during nighttime, huh.\u201dHis surroundings were dark, but there was a warm breeze blowing through the air. On days like these, the temperature would surely remain quite high even past midnight, so this was also the time of year to be wary of heat strokes while asleep.Fortunately, Ryuichi\u2019s apartment was well ventilated, so if he opened the windows a little and placed a screen to block out insects, he would get a moderately cool breeze blowing in.\u201cBut still, Shirasagi\u2026 I hope he\u2019ll be able to cool his feelings off after that.\u201dDespite Satsuki\u2019s words, it was natural for Ryuichi to feel a little uneasy. He could only hope that Akira could turn away from his obsessions over his sister and move forward, even if his affection was on an entirely different level than that of Sohei\u2019s. If he did that, things wouldn\u2019t turn troublesome and above all, Satsuki would be able to feel at ease.\u201cAlright, guess I\u2019ll head home too.\u201dRyuichi left the apartment where Satsuki lived and headed home. On his way home, however, he ran into someone unexpected.\u201c\u2026Boss?\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, Ryuichi.\u201dThe man boasting more muscles than Ryuichi was the manager. He was sitting at an\u00a0oden\u00a0stall, and Ryuichi happened to be walking by the stall and saw his face through the curtain. It wasn\u2019t strange for the manager to be out since the club was closed today, but it seemed that he was also accompanied by his wife and daughter.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cGood evening.\u201d\u201cGood evening, Onii-chan!\u201dAs a matter of fact, this wasn\u2019t his first time meeting the two of them; they had met several times through the manager before. Ryuichi was about to turn around and resume his journey home, but the manager asked him to stay with him for a bit, so Ryuichi reluctantly sat next to him.\u201cJust finished your dinner?\u201d\u201cYeah, I had some sushi.\u201d\u201cI see. Well, here, have some\u00a0oden.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018Well, here\u2019?\u201d Ryuichi laughed and decided to go along with his request. The manager\u2019s daughter was staring at him as he sat down next to the manager, and Ryuichi, sensing from her expression what she wanted him to do, lifted her up and placed her on his lap.\u201cEhehe~ \u266a\u201d\u201cMy, my. Please excuse her.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dAlthough he was a man who was feared by little children, this girl in particular had grown attached to Ryuichi a fair bit a while back. The manager watched contentedly as well as he drank some alcohol.\u201cWhat should I have?\u201d\u201cAnything is fine. My treat.\u201d\u201cIf you say so.\u201dRyuichi put the classic ingredients\u2014konjac, tofu, and fishcake\u2014on his plate, and blew on it to cool it down as he slowly brought it to his mouth.\u201cMan, this tastes really good.\u201d\u201cRight? This stall\u2019s a hidden gem. The place looks crappy on the outside, but I can guarantee its taste.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to add the \u2018crappy\u2019 part in there.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dIt sure is delicious,\u00a0Ryuichi nodded. Food stalls like these were mainly patronized by adults coming off of work, but if the food was this good, he didn\u2019t think it would be a bad idea to bring Shizuna and visit the place together.The time he spent talking with the manager, his wife and daughter was warm.\u201cFufu, it\u2019s almost like our family\u2019s gained a son.\u201dThe manager\u2019s wife\u2019s words made Ryuichi chuckle and remark that she shouldn\u2019t have such a failure of a son.That certain summer evening turned into a heart-warming night for Ryuichi.The manager was always there to help him out, and he wondered if it would be interesting to have someone like him as an escort at his wedding or other events, if he ever had those.\u201cHey, shopkeeper, you got any orange juice?\u201d\u201cYou really think I have orange juice?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201dRyuichi and the shopkeeper exchanged laughs, but the manager unexpectedly let slip a few explosive words.\u201cI have some.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cWhy do you have it?!\u201dWho on earth really is this manager?\u00a0Ryuichi and the shopkeeper thought.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Doing It TogetherTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been getting ahead of yourself lately, huh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get too full of yourself just because you got a big body.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi let out a big sigh in his heart, wondering how things had come to this. On a certain day during summer vacation, Ryuichi was being harassed by two senior boys at school. The reason why he was at school during the summer vacation was simply because he was here to help prepare for the sports festival that was to be held after the summer vacation.\u2026What a pain in the ass. Also, now that I think about it, getting into fights like these is kinda nostalgic.Ryuichi laughed as he thought about something a little out of place. Seeing Ryuichi in a calm and composed state, the two boys reached a hand out for him and barked, \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve\u00a0always\u00a0been cocky, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cYou bastard.\u201d\u201c\u2026Now you\u2019ve done it.\u201dRyuichi, Makoto, and Kaname were all well-known delinquents at school, so although it\u2019d gone under the radar, there were of course other students who were considered delinquents, both juniors and seniors.These two were among said delinquents, but compared to Ryuichi and his friends, they weren\u2019t as impactful, or rather, they could even be called cute delinquents.\u201cFor the record, this\u00a0is\u00a0a school, and here, we\u2019re your seniors.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get too smug, smartass!!\u201dIgnoring Ryuichi\u2019s warning, he growled and came at him with a punch, but Ryuichi avoided it nimbly and grabbed his hand. Ryuichi then added force into his grip, creating a creaking noise. The senior who\u2019d had his hand grabbed grimaced in pain, but once again, Ryuichi was amazed at the high specs of his body.I can see his arm movements, I can avoid him easily, and most importantly, I\u2019m really strong\u2026 I guess you really do have to be at least this strong to have the qualifications to call yourself a staple cuckolding character.Heh, as if. Ryuichi lightly smiled to himself.However, he knew that if he fought back here, it would cause trouble, so he racked his brains as to what he should do. In the meantime, he continued to apply pressure, and as his grip grew stronger and stronger, the senior let out a squeal of pain.\u201cL-Let go of him!\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen Ryuichi turned his gaze toward the other senior, he took a step back, perhaps frightened by Ryuichi\u2019s glare. Judging that he\u2019d done enough, he let go of the senior\u2019s hand, and the two of them backed off a distance away from him but did not stop glaring at him.\u201c\u2026God, what a hassle\u2014\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dIt was then that a refreshing voice echoed throughout the area. Perhaps she was worried about Ryuichi who wasn\u2019t returning as Shizuna slowly approached from behind. She would probably glare at the two seniors and give them a piece of her mind if she knew what had happened, but Ryuichi saw no need for her to go that far.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing; I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cH-Hey!\u201d\u201cHold it!\u201dRyuichi glared intensely at them, seemingly telling them, \u201cBack off.\u201d The seniors completely shrank at his glare that was even sharper than before, and Ryuichi made his way to Shizuna, finding their reaction pathetic as he did.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah. Did you think something happened to me?\u201dWhen he asked that, Shizuna shook her head and smiled.It was possible that Ryuichi had garnered even more hate from those seniors, but he smiled ferociously, thinking that if they tried to pick a fight with him again, he would have to pay them back accordingly.\u201c\u2026I can tell you\u2019re thinking of something bad, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cOops.\u201dOf course, Shizuna always watched Ryuichi when they were alone, so she seemed to be able to accurately tell what he was thinking. It was almost as if she could see right into his mind, but since it was Shizuna, it didn\u2019t make him feel uncomfortable, and in fact, it even made him feel as if she understood him very well, strangely enough.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ve been cocky lately?\u201d\u201cHmm, don\u2019t you think that was the\u00a0past\u00a0you?\u201dShe was completely right. Ryuichi had, on the contrary, become much more mellow as of late, and he could still remember how his teachers\u2019 evaluation of him had changed a little bit and how he was now adored by the students. Perhaps it was precisely because he\u2019d become more mellow that he looked like a tiger that had lost its fangs.\u201cIf I did actually fight back, then a full-on brawl would\u2019ve been inevitable, though\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t want to make you worry, and more importantly, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t like me fighting either, would you?\u201d\u201cHuh? Well\u2026\u201dContrary to Ryuichi\u2019s expectations, Shizuna sank into thought. After a brief think, she replied with this.\u201cIt would certainly make me worry, and I would hate to see you get injured, too. But, if it comes down to it, I\u2019ll respect your decision, Ryuichi-kun. You would never use violence without a reason, so if you do use force, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a reason behind it.\u201dThose words had come from the fact that she completely trusted Ryuichi. It was often said that power, whether it be violence or otherwise, came with responsibility when used, and Ryuichi as he was now had no intention of wielding his power recklessly.It would be irrefutable if one called what he did earlier a form of violence as well, but at least when Ryuichi wielded his power, it was to protect someone important to him.\u201c\u2026What am I, some kind of\u00a0isekai\u00a0hero?\u201d\u201cFufu, that sounds nice. I think you have the makings of a hero, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cSpare me from that. I have more than enough on my hands just being a delinquent.\u201dAfter that, they went back to the classroom and helped prepare for the sports festival once more. That being said, though, there wasn\u2019t really much to do; he would be told to do this or do that, and he would simply do as he was told. He took the initiative when it came to carrying heavy loads, so he really fit in with the class and was adored by many.\u201cShishido-kun, could you take that one with you?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cShishido! Help me out here!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201d\u201cShishido-kun! Make out with Shizuna more!\u201d\u201cSure\u2026 Oi, the hell you just say?\u201d\u201cAhaha!\u201d The class erupted in laughter. Shizuna was working with her usual group of friends, and she really seemed to be laughing happily seeing Ryuichi teased by the class like this. What\u2019s more, there was an array of voices teasing her too, but she didn\u2019t get the least bit embarrassed and took it all in stride.\u201cSee, Ryuichi-kun? They\u2019re telling us to make out, so wanna make out?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hot, so we\u2019ll do it when we get home.\u201d\u201cAll right. Looks like we\u2019ll be working up a sweat, in more ways than one.\u201dMany of her classmates\u2019 faces flushed red as she muttered those words with a giggle. Ryuichi didn\u2019t even want to imagine what they were thinking as he directed a slightly reproachful glare at Shizuna, but her expression was calm and composed.\u201cIn that case, I guess we should leave things off here for today.\u201d\u201cRoger that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s finally over!!\u201dSince Ryuichi and the others\u2019 were fundamentally grouped by their grade at their school, they had to manage their own grade\u2019s festival like this every year. Of course, last year Ryuichi did not participate in any of these things, so in a sense, the interaction was a new experience for him.\u201c\u2026So damn hot.\u201d\u201cIt is hot, huh.\u201dOnce they exited the air-conditioned school, the hot sun and the close to thirty-degree celsius air hit Ryuichi and Shizuna. Although they were both dressed coolly, they still felt distinctly hot.It was just before noon, and they were on their way to Shizuna\u2019s house to have\u00a0somen\u00a0noodles.\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve had\u00a0somen\u00a0noodles. I rarely have them now that I\u2019m alone.\u201d\u201cWhen my father was still alive, we used to do things like\u00a0nagashi somen\u2026 I miss those times.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dShizuna, or even Sakie for that matter, didn\u2019t really speak much about their already deceased father. He had been far from the kind of person Ryuichi\u2019s parents were; he was the ideal parent, a very kind person\u2026 Because of that, he thought that just recalling his memory would be painful for them.\u2026I wish thinking back on you two gave me that same feeling, too.Ahead of Ryuichi and Shizuna, two parents and their child were walking happily together. The father and mother were holding the small boy\u2019s hands, and although he had seen this kind of scene before, they definitely gave off the air of a family, with warmth and smiles in the air.\u201cHey, Ryuichi, are you having fun?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cFufu, we\u2019re such a close family, after all.\u201dWhen Ryuichi imagined this hypothetical situation, his face puckered up in disgust. It was an absolutely impossible scene, which was why he regretted imagining it.\u201cRyuichi-kun, you have your part-time job today, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cSo, you know, I talked to the manager, and I thought I\u2019d like to help out a little bit.\u201d\u201cHrm\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s the condition that I don\u2019t serve men, along with many others, but today, I\u2019ll be helping you out too.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Hmm?\u201dRyuichi had a feeling he\u2019d heard something huge as he tilted his head in confusion. Then, time passed and night fell, and Shizuna was at the club where Ryuichi worked part-time.\u201cIt looks good on you, Shizuna-chan.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing Shizuna dressed in clothes that, unlike the other waitresses, showed no skin at all, Ryuichi glared at the master, wondering what was going on.\u201cShe wants to stay by your side as much as she can, or so she told me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dIt seemed that he would be working together with Shizuna today. That being said, he could rest assured knowing that she would be right next to the manager and would only be helping him with the cooking. However, in situations like these, it seemed to be par for the course that there would be troublesome customers visiting on this very day as well.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62There Are Some Things Best Left Unknown Precisely Because She\u2019s PureTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Y\u2019know.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dRyuichi muttered as he gazed at the counter with his adult senior, an adult working with him at the club.\u201cI was just thinking how the manager has a talent for opening people\u2019s hearts and minds.\u201d\u201cAh, true. Like with you, or especially with you, and now that I really think about it, with\u00a0you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, don\u2019t sulk like that.\u201dRyuichi wasn\u2019t happy with his senior\u2019s words, but he had to admit, he did make sense. Today, just like usual, he was working part-time at the club, but what was different from usual was that Shizuna was with him. Of course, there was a mature and explicit side to this place, so Shizuna was working without leaving the manager\u2019s side.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you worrying about a particular girl like this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018nice\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt means you\u2019re actually living out your youth.\u201dThe senior continued his words with his back against the wall, arms folded.\u201cMe and the others working here are more of the wild, rough type. That\u2019s why we missed out on our youth during our school days.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo from our point of view, you and her are dazzling, and more than anything, we\u2019re glad to see you change like this after watching over you for so long.\u201dThe senior stroked Ryuichi\u2019s head quite strongly. It was strong enough to almost ruin his hairstyle, but strangely enough, Ryuichi did not shake his hand off and let him do as he pleased.It was then that the woman whom Ryuichi had previously asked to accompany Sohei approached them. The woman, Mihara, giggled when she saw the two of them looking friendly.\u201cMy, my, aren\u2019t you two close?\u201d\u201cYep. Me and Ryuichi got this connection, you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026Gross.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201dFor the record, they weren\u2019t slacking off, they were just in the middle of a break of sorts. The senior\u2026whose surname was Seto, retold Mihara what they\u2019d been talking about earlier.\u201cWe were just talking about how good the manager is at opening people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\u201cHmm, well, you\u2019ve got a point. I think he has a good handle on outcasts like us.\u201dIt seemed that Mihara thought the same way as them. While they talked about how great the manager was and how he had many traits that made him a good person, the conversation naturally turned to Shizuna, who was standing next to him.\u201cSo, Ryuichi, how far have you thought things out with that girl?\u201d\u201cHow far?\u201d\u201cYou know, like marrying her and other future plans like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah~.\u201dAfter being told that much, Ryuichi sank into thought. He cared about Shizuna, and in order to progress to a new relationship with her, he had become lovers with her and wished for even more. She had also supported him for a long time, and she\u2019d told him she would stay by his side now and in the future as well, so of course he was thinking about that future to some extent.\u201c\u2026Marrying, huh.\u201dMarriage, the graveyard of life\u2026 It was a bit of an unromantic thought for him to have. To Ryuichi, marriage didn\u2019t hold a positive image in his mind, and that was because he\u2019d seen what had happened to the two people closest to him. But then again, it was through the system of marriage that Ryuichi and Shizuna had been born and were able to meet in this way. Of course, it wasn\u2019t just Shizuna; the same went for Chisa and Satsuki too.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhile he was thinking about marriage in this way, he spotted a familiar figure. It was Hamasaki, a teacher at the school Ryuichi and his friends attended.\u201cThat guy\u2026 So he comes to places like these, too.\u201dRyuichi had thought of him as an unflappably serious teacher, yet it seemed like he came to places like these, too. It wasn\u2019t like he was a married man, and there was no rule that said he couldn\u2019t come just because he was a teacher, so from Ryuichi\u2019s point of view, he was a customer\u2026 But, well, Ryuichi had no intention of meeting him at all.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThat guy over there is a teacher at my school.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dSeto and Mihara also curiously turned their gazes at Hamasaki. However, leaving Ryuichi aside, it would probably be a little troublesome if Hamasaki saw that Shizuna was working here. When Ryuichi turned his gaze to the manager, he immediately noticed Ryuichi\u2019s gaze and seemed to understand his intentions.\u201cHow could he tell from just that?\u201d\u201cIs the manager an alien or something?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not human, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s cruel of y\u2019all.\u201dShizuna tilted her head for a moment, but once she got a look at Hamasaki, albeit from a distance, she turned her gaze to Ryuichi, gave a small nod, and retreated to the back. Then, at a timing so perfect that it was too good to be true, Hamasaki and Ryuichi\u2019s eyes met. His efforts to persuade Shizuna hadn\u2019t worked, and none of his words had reached her mother, Sakie, either. As for Ryuichi, he\u2019d given up on saying anything to him, but he still regarded Ryuichi as an enemy so much so that he glared at him whenever their eyes met.\u201c\u2026Guh.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dHowever, Hamasaki looked away awkwardly, perhaps feeling guilty about coming to an establishment such as this. Ryuichi laughed at this amusing scene and went to Shizuna, thinking that things likely wouldn\u2019t turn particularly troublesome after seeing Hamasaki like that.\u201cI never would\u2019ve thought a teacher would come here.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess that overly serious teacher is still a man, too.\u201dBut still, although he expected Hamasaki would complain a lot about him working part-time at a place like this despite being a high schooler\u2026 Well, if anything, he would be sorely lacking in persuasiveness if he did, so he was conversely looking forward to seeing how Hamasaki would react.\u201cHow\u2019s it going working alongside the manager?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a lot of fun. I don\u2019t get to interact with the customers as much as help with the cooking, but even so, not only the manager but the other waitstaff are very nice to me\u2026 Yup, it\u2019s so much fun. \u266a\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201dShizuna\u2019s smile made Ryuichi breathe a sigh of relief. And so, despite the run-in with Hamasaki, nothing in particular happened afterward in the store, and his part-time job with Shizuna came to an end without incident. Hamasaki did not get involved in any particular way this time, but it was best to consider the possibility that he might say something to them at school.\u201cRyuichi-kun, I\u2019d like to stay at your place tonight.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShizuna nodded happily at Ryuichi\u2019s brief words. They were just about to head home, but it seemed that there were troublesome customers everywhere in the nightlife district.\u201cHold up, wait a minute~.\u201d\u201cHah?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA man had called out to the two. He did not look at Ryuichi at all and only seemed to be targeting Shizuna.\u201cYou were working earlier, weren\u2019t you? You were by the manager\u2019s side the whole time, so I couldn\u2019t talk to you, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dApparently, he had been looking for the right moment to call out to Shizuna for a long time. She wasn\u2019t in her uniform, but one could tell from her body shape that she was a student, and above all, Shizuna was a superb-looking woman\u2014seeing someone like her at a club was enough to attract the annoying fly known as a man to her.\u201cC\u2019mon, take your phone out. Let\u2019s exchange contacts.\u201dThis man was apparently the type to act on his desires. But then, the man finally turned his attention to Ryuichi as well.\u201cI\u2019m fine going after him, so come on over and have some fun with me later, \u2018kay?\u201dShizuna\u2019s eyebrows twitched upward. He had thought about the possibility of this happening, but he wondered if this still would\u2019ve happened had they gone outside and simply stayed away from the store where the manager was.\u201cSorry, but no can do. She\u2019s my girl; maybe you\u2019d be better off with the fine man back there, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dPutting aside Shizuna, who was rapidly muttering about how Ryuichi had called her his girl, the man turned around, not knowing what Ryuichi was talking about.\u201cHeeey, bro, even if she\u2019s only temporary, I don\u2019t like it when you bother our workers, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cHiiiiiiih?!?!\u201dIt was the manager who\u2019d appeared behind him soundlessly. He placed his hand on the man\u2019s shoulder and strengthened it as if to say that he\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0let him go. The man quickly shook off his hand and ran away as if he was fleeing from a demon.\u201cHow ridiculous.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s what happens when they\u2019re in your presence, boss.\u201d\u201cI wonder why the man looked so terrified?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dRyuichi and the manager\u2019s eyes widened at Shizuna\u2019s words. Apparently she didn\u2019t understand what Ryuichi had meant when he referred to the manager as a \u2018fine man\u2019, nor did she understand why the man ran away while protecting his buttocks.\u201cWell, it\u2019s best to keep you as pure as you are now.\u201d\u201c???\u201d\u201cThere are some things in this world that you don\u2019t need to know,\u201d Ryuichi told her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Spending Time With His Male Friends As WellTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrThe way one spent the Obon season varied from person to person. Some obviously spent it with family, some spent it alone, and others spent it with friends. And although it wasn\u2019t custom for this time of year, it wasn\u2019t unusual for some to visit the graves of their family members who had passed away during this season.\u201cYaaawn~.\u201dDespite that, Ryuichi was rubbing his eyes sleepily in the morning. It was past ten o\u2019clock, quite late, but he had come home a little late last night because of his part-time job.\u201c\u2026Ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to do.\u201dFor Ryuichi, who lived alone, it was no different than any other day. He\u2019d gone grave-visiting the other day, so he had no plans to go again. It was then that Ryuichi, having thought that far, gave a wry smile.\u201cNot so long ago, I wouldn\u2019t have thought about grave-visiting at all. I guess I really have changed, huh.\u201dRyuichi laughed, thinking that he would one day visit their graves again.Well then, feeling bored and having nothing to do, Ryuichi picked up his phone.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe\u2019d had no particular intention of meeting anyone or asking anyone out, but apparently there was someone else who was just as bored as Ryuichi.\u201cMakoto, huh.\u201dHe\u2019d received a message from Makoto, asking if he was free and wanted to go somewhere. Ryuichi laughed and replied, \u201cWhere the hell do you want to go?\u201d Then, he immediately changed into his casual clothes and went outside.\u201c\u2026So hot.\u201dIt was only natural that it\u2019d be hot outside in the blazing sun. When Ryuichi arrived at the station where he was to meet Makoto, he found that he was in the middle of picking up a couple of women. The two women were talking happily with Makoto, and it actually made Ryuichi impressed as to how skilled he was.\u201cHey, what are you picking up women for when you\u2019ve called me up?\u201d\u201cOoh, you\u2019re here, Ryuichi.\u201dNow that he had a closer look at them, he could tell that the two women were adults. They were seemingly blushing due to having been hit on by a high school student, but they still didn\u2019t seem to be too displeased, and in addition to Makoto, they also looked at Ryuichi interestedly.\u201cYou know, I think he might be more of my type.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m\u2026\u201dIt seemed that one of the women was interested in Ryuichi. However, Ryuichi was not interested in the women at all, so he did not want to spend time with them. Makoto, knowing this as well, came up to Ryuichi\u2019s side and apologized to the girls for taking up their time.\u201cWas it okay for you to do that?\u201d\u201cYeah. Besides, I was just killing time with them.\u201dRyuichi then started walking with Makoto. Ryuichi didn\u2019t have a specific place to go in mind, and when he usually met up with Makoto, his best friend, on a holiday like this, they just hung out in the city.\u201cNot too long ago, me and you would\u2019ve just gone hunting for girls and devouring them in bed, eh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so wrong\u2026isn\u2019t something I can say, huh.\u201dEven now, Ryuichi still couldn\u2019t refute or rebut his past. When he, Makoto, and even Kaname were together, the three would often pick up girls together, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for them to have one-night stands on those occasions and have relations with the girls.\u201cI remember you giving me pointers on all kinds of things.\u201d\u201cReally? I can\u2019t really remember,\u201d Ryuichi replied.Even if Ryuichi had given him some sort of advice, Makoto had quickly gotten accustomed to handling women, and since he had excellent looks, he didn\u2019t seem likely to have any trouble with women in the first place.\u201cOoh, I like ones like her, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dWhile walking through the city, Makoto turned his attention to a girl.The girl, who was probably a high school student and looked to be around the same age as Ryuichi and his friends, was a little plain looking and gave off a slightly gloomy-like atmosphere. Her face, which was well suited to her round glasses, could be described as that of a bookworm girl, and in any case, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that she lived in a completely different world than Ryuichi and his friends; that was just how inconspicuous of a girl she was.\u201cDon\u2019t you think dyeing a girl like her sounds nice?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s so like you to say.\u201dIt was true that there was a kind of immorality in dyeing and corrupting a plain girl. It was the same thing as dyeing a girl like Shizuna into a gal like Chisa, but Ryuichi smiled bitterly, because in the end, for Ryuichi, the best Shizuna was the Shizuna he had now, so he couldn\u2019t really sympathize with Makoto.Makoto told Ryuichi that he\u2019d go talk to her for a bit and walked to the girl in question.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s the point in inviting me out, then?\u201dHe was exactly right. Ryuichi sighed and wondered why he had gone out of his way to accept his invitation in the middle of this stupidly hot day, and why he had to watch him pick girls up. He could have just left like that without saying a word to him, but that would have left him back at square one with boredom, so he had no choice but to go along with him.\u201cAh, she\u2019s all red in the face.\u201dApparently, the girl herself was aware that she was plain. The expression on her face was not one of disgust, but rather of bewilderment as to why someone like her was being hit on. Of course, Makoto, a skilled player with women, toyed around with her with his sweet words, and Ryuichi felt a little bit sorry for the girl who was being hit on.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dHowever, Makoto returned soon after. The girl was still staring at Makoto with a flushed face, though\u2026 Ryuichi asked him what had happened.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt looks like she has a boyfriend, so I gave up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201dRyuichi decided not to tell him that despite that, the girl was staring at him quite passionately. After that, they went to kill some time bowling and singing at a karaoke bar, and although it was a flowerless time in the absence of women, Ryuichi thought that this kind of thing was also nice every now and then.He found it questionable how Makoto tried to pick up women every time, but it seemed even he had the decency to ask if they had a boyfriend first.\u201cHey, Ryuichi. Try hitting on some girls, too.\u201d\u201cWhy, though?\u201dHe had no idea how many times this made it, but he had absolutely no intention of picking up girls anymore. He may walk around town and admire some pretty girls, but he had no interest in them at all because he\u2019d gotten to know a woman who was even more wonderful than them.\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dAt that moment, he spotted the rear figures of two very familiar people. They were both looking at some accessories and conversing with each other amicably, which made him think that they really were good friends.\u201c\u2026Wait, is that\u2026?\u201dApparently, Makoto also noticed. Both were dressed in summery attire, one showing some skin while not losing her innocent air, and the other in full navel-displaying style, showing off her outstanding figure without hesitation.\u201cIf I gotta pick up girls, I\u2019d obviously go for them.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019d snag them for sure, huh?\u201d\u201cWell, cos I already know them,\u201d Ryuichi laughed. He sneakily approached them to avoid detection, but they both turned around at once as if they had noticed Ryuichi standing behind them.\u201cWhoops\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my, Ryuichi?\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201dRyuichi was taken aback, wondering how they had known. The two people he\u2019d approached were Chisa and Satsuki, both of whom smiled in surprise at Ryuichi\u2019s sudden appearance behind them.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWere you perhaps\u2026hoping we\u2019d spend time with you?\u201d\u201cI ain\u2019t no child, y\u2019know?\u201dRyuichi responded as such to their teasing words. Pointing at Makoto, who was watching the proceedings behind him, he confessed that he had tried to hit on them. Since he\u2019d finished what he\u2019d come to do, he was about to turn his back and leave the two right then and there, but of course, that was impossible.\u201cWait a minute, Ryuichi. Are you just going to call out to these two beautiful women and leave it at that?\u201d\u201cBeautiful women or not, you\u2019re so cold to us even though you\u2019ve run into us, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dChisa firmly grabbed him by his shoulders, and Satsuki modestly grabbed him by the hand. He had a feeling this would\u2019ve happened, and seeing things indeed go as such made Ryuichi smile wryly as he returned to Makoto with the two of them.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cHi, Makoto-kun.\u201d\u201cHi there.\u201d\u201c\u2026You.\u201dWell, obviously Makoto would be troubled if he brought two women like this. However, both Chisa and Satsuki understood that Ryuichi was hanging out with Makoto today and immediately let go of his body.\u201cWell, you two enjoy your time together, alright?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Though it pains me to leave you, I\u2019ll leave it at this for today.\u201dNo sooner had they separated their bodies than they brought their faces close to his once more and kissed him on the cheek. Chisa was satisfied that she had done it, while Satsuki smiled a little while showing some embarrassment, and the girls left. Incidentally, since they were in the middle of the city, they were seen by passersby, who were both jealous and envious of him.\u201c\u2026Seriously, you\u2019re incredible, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cThe hell you talkin\u2019 about?\u201dThe lingering scent and sensation on his cheeks felt pleasant. After that, Ryuichi spent some time walking around the city with Makoto again.And, speaking of summer, it was the season of beaches. The day when he and Shizuna went to the sea, albeit a nearby one, had finally come.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64She Still Finds Herself Attracted To His MusclesTranslated by HamletJrSummer was the season of beaches. It would probably be very pleasant to take a dip in the cool ocean water under the hot summer sun. It was the perfect day for Ryuichi and Shizuna to visit the beach together. The beach was full of families, and out on the open sea there was a group of people enjoying surfing, making it quite lively.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s so hot.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dHe had no idea how many times he\u2019d said that phrase since summer started, but it really was hot as hell. Just being outside for a few minutes was enough to get a sunburn, and for a woman, it was more than enough to make them worry about their skin.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re absolutely stunning, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dMeanwhile, the thing that was occupying Shizuna\u2019s mind was, of course, Ryuichi\u2019s body. They had already changed their clothes, so they were currently in their swimsuits, but Shizuna was transfixed by Ryuichi\u2019s strong, muscular body. Her cheeks flushed as she stared at him, even though she had seen him naked many times before. Ryuichi chuckled since things like these usually happened the other way around, and turned his gaze to Shizuna to stare back at her.\u201cI think you look good too, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dShizuna smiled widely. Her bikini was of a slightly bold color, black, and had very cute frills as an added bonus. Of course, she was not only adorable, but also boasted an explosive figure that made her all the more attractive.\u201cWell, I guess this is what happens when a girl like you goes to the beach.\u201d\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t make me very happy, though.\u201dRyuichi nodded his head in agreement. Various men who had come to the beach were looking at Shizuna, albeit in a reserved manner. If one were to use a hyperbole, it was as if she was a goddess who had descended to the beach; she was just that beautiful. A normal man would definitely be unable to turn their gaze away from her.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad feeling to have you, a woman who attracts so much attention, as my girl. A lot of things happened that allowed me to meet you and deepen my relationship with you. It\u2019s because of that that I feel superior to the other men here.\u201dWith that, he hugged Shizuna\u2019s body. She had felt uncomfortable being gawked at because of her swimsuit, but she understood her own attractiveness, so she accepted it as something inevitable. Her eyes were moistened just by being hugged by him like this, and Ryuichi, in a way, was also captivated by her feminine side, which was on full display.\u201cYou\u2019re not only cute, but you have a strong and kind heart\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPlus, you\u2019re really lewd.\u201d\u201cGeez!\u201dShizuna\u2019s cheeks puffed up when Ryuichi mentioned that one sentence that completely ruined the good mood they had going. He had tried to compliment her by saying that in addition to having a cute and kind side, she also had ample amounts of lewdness to go with it. With Shizuna in his embrace, he placed his hand on her breast and enjoyed the softness of it, and she, too, was no longer able to shake him off or tell him to stop.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dThe two of them snuggled up together and headed under the parasol. The first thing Shizuna did was to take out some oil from her luggage and spread it on her hand as she applied it to her body.\u201cI thought you were going to ask me to do it.\u201d\u201cReally? Well, I guess it\u00a0is\u00a0a cliched event for lovers who\u2019re getting to know each other.\u201dShizuna continued to speak as she carefully oiled her body.\u201cWe\u2019re way past the stage where something like this would get my heart racing, and besides, we do a lot more extreme things than this, don\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201dShe was absolutely right. He and Shizuna had been to each other\u2019s homes many times, and had also had sex with each other multiple times, so her words had come out of her certain level of experience with these sorts of things.\u201c\u2026Oh my.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShizuna pointed her finger at something, as if she had just noticed something. When he looked in that direction, he found her friends with whom she always talked in the classroom, walking along the beach in their swimsuits.\u201cLooks like they\u2019ve come to play.\u201d\u201cSo it seems.\u201dThey walked on without noticing Ryuichi and Shizuna; the two didn\u2019t make any move either, perhaps because they did not intend to call out to them. They didn\u2019t know if there was anyone else they knew at the beach, but since they had come to the beach together, they decided to have a lot of fun.\u201cNow then, let\u2019s go, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dShizuna took him by the hand and they went out to the sea. They did not get too wild, but they played as much as they could without feeling too cramped. Not only did they swim, they also participated in beach volleyball using her inherent communication skills, punished unscrupulous people who tried to catcall Shizuna, and hid under the shade of a rock, spending a very thrilling, lover-like time with each other shrouded in love\u2026 Then, noon arrived.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had yakisoba noodles too.\u201d\u201cI think so as well. It\u2019s not something made at my home, either.\u201dThey bought some yakisoba noodles at a beach house and filled their stomachs. There were many other stores, but there was no way they could visit all of them, and besides, it wasn\u2019t something typically done when one was at the beach. Well, Ryuichi could\u2019ve just eaten separately by himself, but to do that to Shizuna, a girl, would\u2019ve been cruel.\u201cThanks for the meal.\u201d\u201cThank you for the meal.\u201dAfter finishing his yakisoba, Ryuichi stayed where he was to relax for a while. In the meantime, Shizuna got up from her seat to go to the restroom.\u201cWell, it\u2019s close enough that I don\u2019t have to worry about her being hit on.\u201dThere was a restroom available for use in the restaurant where they had just eaten their yakisoba, so he would be able to immediately notice if anybody approached Shizuna. Well, people who picked up girls in a place as crowded as this\u2026probably did exist, but they wouldn\u2019t do it unless they were quite confident in themselves.\u201cHey, you. The young man over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi waited for Shizuna\u2019s return while drinking soda. Therein, a woman\u2019s voice called out to him from behind, but he didn\u2019t notice.\u201cHello? Are you listening?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah?\u201dA tap on his shoulder finally made Ryuichi turn around as if he had just noticed. There stood a group of three women, probably college students by the looks of it.\u201cNeed somethin\u2019?\u201d\u201cWah, you\u2019re so cool. Hey, you must be free, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re alone, after all.\u201d\u201cWanna come play with us?\u201dShizuna had been with him just moments ago, but apparently the girls had arrived here just after Shizuna left her seat. As for Ryuichi, he had considered the possibility of Shizuna being picked up, but then he remembered that he himself was someone good-looking enough to attract women to him.\u2026I\u2019ve gotten so used to it that I forgot, but I guess I\u00a0am\u00a0kinda good-looking myself, huh.He was reminded that he had a rugged but definitely well-defined face. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been the kind of man who stole Shizuna away, but of course, Ryuichi himself was not really aware that there was more to it than just that. Well, whatever it was about himself that attracted these girls, he unfortunately couldn\u2019t take them up on their offer.\u201cSorry, I\u00a0do\u00a0have someone with me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that~.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, we\u2019ll do something nice for you.\u201dRyuichi gave a wry smile at her ridiculous \u2018something nice\u2019 remark. The three of them were certainly beautiful women, but compared to Shizuna, they were inferior to her. It was likely impolite of him to use the word \u2018inferior\u2019 to refer to a woman\u2019s beauty, but it was no wonder, since they were complete strangers who had suddenly come up to talk to him.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it okay?\u201dOne of them leaned in close to Ryuichi. She pressed against him with a softness that was just slightly lacking, and Ryuichi thought nothing of her; he did not find his heart racing, nor did he consider her a good or bad woman.Simply put, she did not arouse his interest at all. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Shizuna returning from the bathroom, and she, too, having noticed him, put her hand over her mouth and smiled, a show of her calmness and composure.\u201cThe person I have with me is a woman. And she\u2019s a wonderful girlfriend much better than you three.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dShizuna came back and hugged Ryuichi, as if to show off to the women who were stunned. The women must have been confident in themselves, which was why they had gone reverse catcalling, but when they saw Shizuna, they were unable to say anything.\u201cFufu, it\u2019s a sweeping win for me. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026Guh!!\u201dThey pointedly glared at Shizuna, but she didn\u2019t care at all. Just like that, Ryuichi left the restaurant with her in his arms, walked straight back to the parasol and lay down, rubbing his full belly.\u201cMy, are you going to sleep?\u201d\u201cJust for a bit\u2026\u00a0Yawn.\u201dHe really had gotten only a little bit sleepy, so he closed his eyes.\u201cGeez\u2026you really are a free spirit.\u201dDespite her words, Shizuna seemed quite happy. She was not going to go anywhere without Ryuichi, and she would not leave his side until he woke up.Thus, their time at the beach passed in this way. It was the first time they had been to the beach as lovers, and needless to say, it was a wonderful time for both of them.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65And Yet, It Was Like An Ephemeral DreamTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dObon had passed, and a few more days passed since Ryuichi and Shizuna enjoyed their summer at the beach. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that his part-time job had recently become a bit busier, but Ryuichi began to find that waking up in the morning was more difficult than ever.\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling really out of it lately.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was fatigue or some other reason, but he felt his body had become a little heavier as the summer vacation was coming to an end. When he got up and reflected his face in the mirror, he was greeted by a strong, rugged face, the same as usual. There were no dark circles under his eyes, just the same glare in his eyes and his usual bad boy look.\u201c\u2026I ain\u2019t got a clue.\u201dSince it was not an illness or anything like the cold he had gone down with before, he did not want to bother Shizuna and the others, although he hadn\u2019t given it much thought. Since he had no part-time job and no plans to meet anyone today, he decided to take it easy for the rest of the day. While enjoying a sandwich he had bought at a convenience store, Ryuichi noticed something that he found a little nostalgic.\u201cOh yeah, I only wrote some small bits in here.\u201dWhat lay on his desk was a notebook in disarray, a notebook that should have had all its pages used, but was only used for its first two pages. It was a notebook in which Ryuichi had written about the original path of this world. Written in sloppy characters was a chronological order of what kind of events would happen at what times, showing a glimpse of the writer\u2019s lack of motivation.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t need this anymore.\u201dHe placed it on top of a stack of notebooks. He\u2019d long since known that this world was already far removed from the one he\u2019d known, and that under normal circumstances, Shizuna would\u2019ve been corrupted by him during this summer vacation, and that she would simultaneously knock Sohei into despair as soon as the vacation ended, but there was no need to worry about that any longer.\u201c\u2026Could it be?\u201dRyuichi came up with a possible answer as to why he felt this dullness in his body and felt strangely uncomfortable. It was fear that something might happen that would send the world back to its original path. It should\u2019ve been impossible for Ryuichi to be reborn in another world like this in the first place, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if something else that was even more impossible to happen, happened.\u201cHeh, have I ever been this much of a coward?\u201dRyuichi was afraid of the possibility that something might happen, something that could ruin the relationship he had built with everyone here in an instant. Normally, he would have laughed it off, but imagining those what-ifs made him very anxious\u2026 It made him wonder if it was a downside to the body he had now.\u201cThey say that sickness and health starts with the mind\u2026 Well, I ain\u2019t sick, though.\u201dAfterward, he finished dressing and laid down on the tatami mats. Even though it was early in the morning, the cicadas were already singing loudly, and even now he could keenly sense the summer heat. He held out for a while without turning on the air conditioner, but eventually he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and picked up the remote control and turned the AC on.\u201c\u2026Ahh~.\u201dHe spent his leisurely time alone in a daze. As he motionlessly lied there, there was a pounding at his apartment door. The door was unlocked because he had gone to throw away the garbage bag in the morning, and the door could be heard opening as the visitor entered with a nonchalant look on their face.\u201cYoohoo~, Ryuichi. Good morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026I knew it was you.\u201dIt was impossible for anyone else but Chisa to show up like this without any notice. Shizuna and Satsuki always made it a habit to notify him and plan visits in advance, so she was the only one who would do something like this.\u201cI thought you might\u2019ve been bored, so I came over to see you.\u201dShe did not seem to be thinking at all about what would happen if he weren\u2019t home, but for now, Chisa\u2019s visit lightened Ryuichi\u2019s mood a little.\u201cYeah. I was pretty bored.\u201d\u201cThought so,\u201d she laughed and sat down right next to him. As he continued to spend his time with Chisa like this, Ryuichi muttered to himself that, come to think of it, this had been how he\u2019d always spent his time in the past.\u201cI used to be together with you like this all the time.\u201d\u201cTrue. I\u2019ve been looking after you all these years, and now you\u2019ve got yourself a precious girlfriend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sometimes it all feels so surreal to me.\u201d\u201cSame.\u201dIt seemed both Ryuichi and Chisa were thinking the same thing.\u201c\u2026Are you not feeling well today?\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, not really\u2026 Well, I\u2019m just feeling a little out of it, that\u2019s all.\u201dChisa also noticed Ryuichi\u2019s condition. She thought about something for a bit, and then she, too, lay down right next to him and hugged him tightly.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cNow, now, just enjoy it.\u201dChisa stroked Ryuichi\u2019s head as if she was soothing a child. Sakie, too, did this to him occasionally, but as expected, having an older woman pamper him like this calmed him down and made him drowsy.\u201c\u2026Yawn.\u201d\u201cAre you sleepy? If so, you should be a good boy and get some sleep.\u201d\u201cThe heck is that\u2026 But, well, I\u2019ll take you up on that offer for a bit.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dGrateful to hear those words, Ryuichi slowly closed his eyes. Feeling himself sinking deeper and deeper into the darkness, he drifted off to sleep in Chisa\u2019s soft embrace. Sensing his breathing soften in sleep, Chisa smiled and continued to stroke his head as if cherishing the bad boy who was sometimes cute and sometimes annoying.Sometimes, people\u2019s fears were right on target. Thus, although Ryuichi often had mysterious dreams as he slept, this time it was very ill-natured\u2026that is, he dreamt of his very essence.\u201c\u2026This is\u2026\u201dIt was a familiar room. It was not a room in the familiar apartment he had been staying in, but a room in a proper house, full of life.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWith a puzzled head, Ryuichi\u2026no,\u00a0he\u00a0looked around. There, he glanced upon a book that stood out, a book that would definitely make him die of embarrassment if his parents saw it.\u201c\u2026Ugh.\u201dThe moment he saw the book, he immediately clutched his head in his hands and crouched down on the spot. A sharp pain ran through his head, so painful that he clenched his teeth from the pain that couldn\u2019t have been from a normal headache. But fortunately, the pain soon went away, and he twisted his head to see what the hell that was about.\u201c\u2026The heck? It feels like I\u2019m forgetting something important.\u201dThere was a pang in his chest, as if he had forgotten something important to him.But he could not remember it.He turned his attention to the book again, thinking that he couldn\u2019t remember\u2026no, that there was nothing up to begin with and that this was normal.\u201cAfter summer vacation, my precious you was dyed.\u201dWhile there were many people who disliked this genre, there were also a certain number of people who liked it.He was not a fan of NTR himself, but he was curious about the content of the manga because he liked the illustrations, so he bought it.\u201c\u2026Hrm.\u201dAs he flipped through the pages to see its contents, he saw a series of stories drawn with great artistic ability.The story detailed the heroine, Rindo Shizuna, being dyed to the liking of the cuckolder, Ryuichi Shishido, and her pure and innocent appearance being transformed into a gyaru, the opposite of what she had been.\u201cWhy the heck did I buy this\u2026 This scene is actually so, so bad!\u201dThe manga mainly depicted Shizuna and Ryuichi, as well as the deprived protagonist, Sohei, and they were all drawn really beautifully.The other characters who appeared from time to time were also attractively drawn, and if the content was not taken into consideration, it was a masterpiece of a manga.\u201c\u2026I know NTR is supposed to be heartbreaking, but why does it ache my heart this much?\u201dWatching the scene where Shizuna was dyed by Ryuichi somehow made his heart ache even more than when he first read the book.He felt a sadness as if someone he cared about was being taken away from him\u2026as if the precious existence he had by his side was going somewhere.\u201c\u2026Shizuna.\u201dWhy did it pain him so much to speak this name\u2026? He didn\u2019t understand.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll always be by your side.\u201d\u201cWha?!\u201dHe thought he heard someone muttering beside him, but there was no one else in the room besides him.Tilting his head and wondering if it was his imagination, he put the manga back on the bookshelf and left the room to\u00a0go on with his life as before, heading for his family, despite his unexplained feelings.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Those Words Truly Did Support HimTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cWhat would you like for dinner today?\u201d\u201cToday? Hmm.\u201dAs he lounged aimlessly in the living room, his mother asked him this question, prompting him to cross his arms in thought. There wasn\u2019t anything in particular that he wanted to eat, so a part of him felt that anything was fine.\u201c\u2026Meat and potato stew?\u201dThose words had spontaneously left his mouth. Meat and potato stew wasn\u2019t a particularly unusual dish, but his mother\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, not expecting him to come up with such a choice.\u201cThat\u2019s an unusual pick. Well, not that it matters.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was no wonder she\u2019d found it unusual, since the words had come out of his mouth unknowingly.\u201cWhat do you think? About my meat and potato stew?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hella good.\u201dHe\u2019d been thinking about how strange it was for a while now. The memories of a person who wasn\u2019t him kept flashing through his mind, and he repeatedly tried to remember it only to find himself stuck at an impasse.It wasn\u2019t his own voice, yet it somehow felt familiar, and even though he\u2019d never heard it before, a strong feeling flooded his chest that he didn\u2019t want to let it go\u2026and even that was something he didn\u2019t entirely understand.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter that, time passed. The hands of the clock pointed to the evening hours, and when he got out of the bath and it came time for dinner, he stared at the meat and potato stew on the table as he had requested\u2026and scooped some into his mouth.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s delicious.\u201dThe stew his mother had made for him was very tasty. Although it wasn\u2019t to the point where he\u2019d go crazy for it, it was enough to make him eat it with so much gusto that his rice disappeared in minutes. When he clasped his hands together and said his thanks for the meal, his mother said this.\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice feeling. To see you eating my food so heartily.\u201d\u201cWell, it was just that good, so.\u201d\u201cThank you. It really makes me happy to hear you say that.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dEmbarrassed, he left the living room. He really didn\u2019t know why a single meal had inspired such strange feelings in him, and he spent the rest of the time in his room in a daze.\u201c\u2026I wonder what this feeling is.\u201dHe stood up and picked up the book that he\u2019d put away. He flipped through the pages and stopped at the page with the smiling face of the book\u2019s heroine, Shizuna.\u201c\u2026Shizuna.\u201dJust the mention of this character\u2019s name warmed his heart, and at the same time, it made him lonely, wondering why she wasn\u2019t by his side. Her warmth, her touch, and her voice\u2026 Even though it should\u2019ve been impossible, it seemingly lingered in his memory clearly, bewildering him.\u201cThis is bad; doesn\u2019t this mean I\u2019m too far gone?\u201dWhile there were a certain number of people in this world who spoke of manga characters as their\u00a0waifus, he gave a wry smile, wondering how the hell he\u2019d reached this point in his life.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dAt that moment, his hand, which had been turning pages over once more, stopped. He\u2019d come across one of the scenes in which Shizuna uttered certain lines to Sohei, words she\u2019d uttered after she changed from her pure and innocent image to a flashy and flamboyant one.\u201cI was dyed by him. You see, I wanted to be dyed in his colors. He dyed the weak and frail colors I had before!\u201dWhen he saw the scene, he inadvertently screamed that she was wrong.He didn\u2019t know why, but he still couldn\u2019t help but shout\u2026 He shouted that she was wrong, and continued his words while gazing at the Shizuna in the book.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u2026 Shizuna isn\u2019t that weak. She has her own colors\u2026 She has her own unique colors!\u201dIt was a cry from the depths of his heart. Shizuna\u2019s expression then changed from the suggestive smile depicted in the manga to a picture of her hugging someone\u2019s arm and uttering similar lines.\u201cI will stay by your side forever, in my own unique colors.\u201d\u201c\u2026!!\u201dFinally, he remembered everything. As if a door of forgotten memories was opened, all the memories of his time as Ryuichi came back to him now.\u201c\u2026So does that mean this\u2019s a dream, or\u2026what?\u201dAlthough he had remembered, he couldn\u2019t find any answers as to what was going on. But, he had something he needed to do. He left his room and went down to the living room, where his mother was still washing dishes.\u201cHmm, hmm, hmm~. \u266a\u201dHis mother, who was washing the dishes while humming a tune, noticed him and stopped washing in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing.\u201dThe mother in front of him was definitely\u00a0his\u00a0mother. Not Ryuichi\u2019s mother, but the mother he had before he became Ryuichi\u2026in other words, the mother of his previous life.\u201c\u2026I\u2026\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know how\u00a0he\u00a0became Ryuichi in the first place. In cases like these, it was fundamentally assumed that something must\u2019ve happened that triggered his rebirth, but he couldn\u2019t recall any such thing at all.Nevertheless, being able to meet his blood-related family like this made him happy.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what to say, and tears spontaneously spilled out from his eyes. His mother was so surprised that she dried her hands and approached him, but he reached out to her and hugged her as she came close.\u201c\u2026Oh dear, you\u2019ve remembered now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHer voice was somewhat reminiscent of that of a mother in response to her troubled son, but it was also one filled with loneliness.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but\u2026I was really happy.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d\u201cSorry, Mom. I\u2019m heading back.\u201dHe now knew that there was a world he had to return to. He already understood that this world was a fake, an ephemeral dream. He knew that when he woke up from this place, he would never see his family again, but now that he could remember them, he would never forget them again. He\u2019d only had the worst of memories of his family as Ryuichi, but the memories of the family he\u2019d had before he became Ryuichi would never be lost.\u201cIf there\u2019s a god out there, then I think they\u2019ve done something really nice.\u201d\u201cI agree\u2026 Do your best over there.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt was because he couldn\u2019t go back that he now had no choice but to walk toward the future. He awakened from his dream with the memories of his family he\u2019d reunited with in his temporary dream, and the promise he\u2019d made to Shizuna, which he reaffirmed once more after being separated from her.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, good morning, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shizuna?\u201dWhen he opened his eyes, it was Shizuna who greeted Ryuichi. He was sure Chisa had been with him before he fell asleep, but just as he thought that, Chisa came out of the bath, wiping her head with a towel.\u201cYou\u2019re awake, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201dAs he was puzzled as to what was going on, Chisa explained to him. After Ryuichi went to sleep, she invited Shizuna to come because she felt lonely alone with Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201cYup\u2026 Was it a bother?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cLike hell you could be a bother,\u201d he said as he reached his hand for Shizuna. As he heard Chisa using the hair dryer to dry her hair, Ryuichi thought back to the dream he had just had.Although it was a dream, he felt bad that he\u2019d forgotten Shizuna, even if only a little. It was her words and the promise he had exchanged with her that brought back his forgotten memories.\u201c\u2026Shizuna.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYou said you\u2019d stay by my side from now on, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that I did.\u201dShe nodded her head. Yes, Shizuna had promised him that, but it was by no means something that should be a one-way thing. He had never really thought about it before, but Ryuichi couldn\u2019t just be on the receiving end; he had to give back to her as well.\u201cI might say something a little bit unmanly-like.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay, what is that?\u201dShizuna could also sense something from the air about Ryuichi, but she waited patiently for his words. Ryuichi paused for a moment, looked Shizuna straight in the eye, and spoke.\u201cI will be there for you too, Shizuna, now and in the future. I will protect you as you stay by my side with your colors so that they never become cloudy.\u201dWith that, he kissed Shizuna on the cheek. From her point of view, she must\u2019ve been confused and wondering what he was talking about all of a sudden, but he laughed and told her not to ask him any more questions.As both Shizuna and Chisa\u2019s eyes widened in amazement at Ryuichi\u2019s unusual appearance, he muttered these words inwardly, not knowing if they would reach their intended recipient or not.\u2026Mom, Dad\u2026 I\u2019ll be okay.Ryuichi would never thank his parents, nor could he. But\u00a0he, who resided within Ryuichi, and his parents were different.He, who had become Ryuichi, smiled, knowing that although he would miss his family and his parents who were wonderful enough to fill his heart, they had loved him properly\u2026so he would be okay now.\u201cHey, seriously though, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Did you eat something bad?\u201d\u201c\u2026You two are seriously being rude, you know?\u201dIf he was with these girls, he was sure he would be able to keep smiling. That was the kind of warmth he had by his side.AfterwordThis may be sudden, but it\u2019s been decided that this work will be adapted into a manga. Its label will be Ganga Online. It will be a while before it actually takes shape, but thanks to everyone\u2019s support, we will be able to deliver the story of Ryuichi and Shizuna as a manga. We will keep you posted on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and other media, but for now, I would like to announce that the manga has been officially decided on.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67This Is Definitely a Summer Event TooTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrSummer vacation was almost over. For Ryuichi, it would be no exaggeration to say that this summer vacation was a time when many things had happened, and at the same time, it was a time when he once again came face to face with the important people who were always around him.\u201cI love you.\u201dThe voice who\u2019d uttered those words wasn\u2019t Shizuna\u2019s, Chisa\u2019s, Satsuki\u2019s, or even Sakie\u2019s. It was the voice of\u00a0his\u00a0mother before he\u2019d gained Ryuichi\u2019s will, the mother of Ryuichi\u2019s past life who\u2019d loved him dearly\u2026 Of course, it wasn\u2019t just her, but his father as well who\u2019d loved him.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. I certainly am Ryuichi. But\u2026I\u2019m also the son of those two. It\u2019s not like all my memories are painful.\u201dIn the first place, it didn\u2019t suit a bulky guy like Ryuichi to dwell on painful memories for so long. Besides, today was the day that Ryuichi would be going out with everyone he knew.\u201cThis really does hit the spot.\u201d\u201cChisa-san, please try not to drink too much.\u201dIn front of him was Chisa, sitting on a chair drinking a beer, and Satsuki, who was watching to make sure she did not overdo it. Shizuna was sitting right next to Ryuichi, and Sakie was also drinking a beer, though not as much as Chisa was.\u201cHas it been long since you\u2019ve last seen a firework show, Ryuichi-kun?\u201dShizuna asked him this question, and he nodded his head in response. Since today was the day of the fireworks display to end the summer season, everyone decided to go out together to the city. He had often gone out alone when he was a child because he could see the fireworks if he went to town, but this was the first time he would be going out with someone to watch the fireworks.\u201cSince it\u2019s you we\u2019re talking about, you probably just went to find some nice girls instead of watch the fireworks, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s not true,\u00a0wasn\u2019t something he could say. Just as Chisa said, last year he\u2019d gone out at this time of year too, but that was because he, Makoro, and Kaname were looking for women with whom they\u2019d have a one-night stand. If they found a partner, they would make a good impression on them, seduce them, and ignore the fireworks as they spent a sweet night at a hotel with them before going home.\u201cYou have us with you this year, so you won\u2019t have to do that.\u201dShizuna linked arms with him, and Ryuichi nodded his head in agreement. Well, even if he had to spend this time of year alone, he had no plans on picking up girls, so there was no need for her to worry, but when he thought about it, he was deeply moved by how different things were now for him to spend his summer in such a state of bliss.\u201cDid something happen to you recently?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was Sakie who\u2019d asked this to him. Although there really wasn\u2019t anything in particular that had happened to him, what was clear was that he\u2019d had a reunion with his family in a dream, so it wasn\u2019t something he could confidently talk about.\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019ve managed to sort out my feelings a bit, I guess.\u201d\u201cI see. If you\u2019re smiling, it must\u2019ve been a good thing.\u201dSakie giggled at Ryuichi. The other girls followed suit and looked at him too, smiling. As for Ryuichi, he was pretty happy to be stared at like this, but he scratched his cheek to cover the slight embarrassment he felt.\u201c\u2026Man, it feels totally different now from how it was a little while back.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. At the very least, if this were the you from a year ago, you wouldn\u2019t have watched the fireworks; you would\u2019ve just taken us all home and eaten us all up.\u201d\u201cW-Was he really that aggressive?\u201dChisa gave Satsuki a nod. Then, without giving Ryuichi the chance to cut in, Chisa went on to tell everyone what Ryuichi had used to be like. Everything she said was right though, so he couldn\u2019t deny her either.\u201cBeing aggressive is a little different from how he is now, huh.\u201d\u201c\u2026But, if it were Ryuichi-kun, I\u2019d happily go along with him.\u201d\u201cEven if it was the old Ryuichi?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSatsuki assented without hesitation. However, it seemed that Shizuna was conscious of not being outdone by Satsuki, since she also nodded her head up and down with great vigor.\u201cStop talking about the old me.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dWhen asked for a reason, Ryuichi answered somewhat spontaneously.\u201cThe old me and the current me are, without a doubt, both me\u2026but I like the new me better now that I\u2019ve met you, Shizuna, and the others and changed. So, well, I\u2019d rather you be with the present me than the past me\u2026is how I\u2019m feeling, I guess?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure he was able to put his thoughts into words well, but the girls probably understood his intentions.\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve really changed, haven\u2019t you? Yup, yup, past you was totally fine, but you\u2019re a really good boy now.\u201dThe reason she\u2019d called him a good \u2018boy\u2019 rather than a good \u2018man\u2019 was likely because Ryuichi was younger than her. Satsuki just stared in amazement since she hadn\u2019t spent much time with Ryuichi yet, but when it came to Sakie, the oldest in the group, she reached out her arm and patted Ryuichi\u2019s head.\u201cThe Ryuichi I saw when I first met was wonderful, very much so. But now, I feel you\u2019re wonderful\u00a0and\u00a0cute.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s it, Sakie-san!\u201dRyuichi weakly brushed off her hand that was stroking him, telling her to stop calling him cute. It was inevitable that they would make fun of him for being shy, so Ryuichi hid behind Shizuna and Satsuki to hide from Chisa and Sakie, the adults of the group, so to speak.\u201cGeez, how could you two treat me like a kid?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re a high schooler, so even from my point of view, you\u2019re sort of like a kid too, you know?\u201d\u201cEven you, Satsuki?!\u201dIn the end, it seemed that the only ally he had was his same-aged companion, Shizuna.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re so cute, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi, clutching his chest, drooped his head down again.It was still early in the evening before the fireworks would go off, but there were many people gathered around, so of course it was very busy and noisy, and the four beautiful women gathered near Ryuichi attracted a lot of attention, as expected.It was easy to imagine that if they had not been so friendly with Ryuichi, they would have been catcalled by other men straight away.\u2026They all look really good in their yukatas.All four girls were wearing yukatas of different colors, perhaps a summer tradition. Shizuna was in blue, Chisa in red and white, Satsuki in white, and Sakie in pale red, each with a pretty floral pattern that was impressive and emphasized their beauty. Chisa\u2019s chest area was laid bare, perhaps because she\u2019d drunk a lot, but she made sure that only Ryuichi could see it, which was a feat of skill.\u201cAh, it\u2019s starting soon.\u201d\u201cLooks like it.\u201dJust as the surroundings grew quiet, fireworks shot up into the sky with a fizzle. It made a loud bang, and a large flower bloomed in the sky, brightly illuminating the spot where Ryuichi and the girls were. It had been a very long time since Ryuichi had seen fireworks not through a TV screen, but with his own eyes.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s pretty.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s honest thoughts slipped out. He smiled softly, as if the beautiful sight calmed his mood and put his mind at ease. Perhaps spurred on by the atmosphere, Shizuna and Satsuki each leaned in to embrace Ryuichi\u2019s arms.\u201c\u2026Haha.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201d\u201cEhehe. \u266a\u201dIncidentally, because of the scale of the event, he\u2019d seen quite a few of his classmates in town. They seemed to have come with their friends, and they looked at him strangely because, in addition to seeing Ryuichi and Shizuna, they didn\u2019t know the relationship he had with the other three.Shizuna was always by his side, so they didn\u2019t think they had a suspicious relationship, but they surely must have been envious of his situation.\u201cThis year\u2019s summer vacation is almost over.\u201d\u201cYup\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right.\u201dShizuna clapped her hands together. While the sound of the fireworks going off in the sky was still echoing, Shizuna\u2019s suggestion was definitely heard by Ryuichi and the other girls.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we all get together at Ryuichi-kun\u2019s place after this? Since we\u2019re all here together like this, let\u2019s make the best memory of all to end things off. \u266a\u201d\u201cMy, that sounds great!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d\u201cDear me, in that case I\u2019ll be returning ho\u2014\u201d\u201cMom? You\u2019re coming too, you know?\u201dSakie sent a gaze at Ryuichi, saying, \u201cMy, what should I do?\u201d Ryuichi nodded as if to say, \u201cNow that it\u2019s come to this, no one can stop her anymore.\u201dIt seemed an even hotter night lied ahead of them today.Only Ryuichi and his friends knew about this relationship, and it was not something they could tell anyone about. However, since each of them had accepted this relationship, no one could lodge any complaints.\u2026Heh, a lot of things have really changed. But it ain\u2019t bad\u2026 I\u2019m happy in every way possible. So don\u2019t worry about me.Ryuichi looked up at the sky and smiled, as if to say that he no longer needed to call on any more dreams like that. He wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d been heard, but something like a shooting star shone in the sky as if in response to Ryuichi.AfterwordThank you for your many kind words about the manga adaptation. It made me really happy. It is not something I can put out just yet, but I\u2019ve already seen the designs for Ryuichi and Shizuna myself! A quick glance was enough to make me think,\u00a0Wow, this is Ryuichi,\u00a0and\u00a0Wow, this is Shizuna, so I\u2019m very glad to hear that you are looking forward to it. It will be a long time until it is completed, but I hope you can wait patiently.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68A Wonderful Summer VacationTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrOn the night of the fireworks display, the girls gathered at Ryuichi\u2019s apartment after everyone agreed to Shizuna\u2019s proposal. Ryuichi had never had all five girls, including him, in his apartment before, so if you were to ask if it was cramped, you would be right.\u201cWhat on earth do you girls think I am\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now, prepare yourself, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dNeedless to say, they spent an incredibly steamy time from then on. There was no need to mention who ran out of stamina first or who managed to hold on to their consciousness until the very end, as it would be insensitive.The day after such an intense but definitely happy night, it was Shizuna\u2019s mother, Sakie, who woke up first.\u201c\u2026Hrm\u2026? Ah, right.\u201dAlthough she\u2019d been surprised to find herself waking up somewhere other than usual, her memories of last night quickly returned to her mind.Perhaps it was because she\u2019d been drinking, though not as much as Chisa, that she had had no qualms at all about having sex with Ryuichi along with her own daughter and the other girls.\u201c\u2026You know, I\u00a0had\u00a0some confidence in my body and\u00a0thought\u00a0I was pretty sexy.\u201d\u201cI-I was also pretty confident in my breasts\u2026\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I guess\u00a0this\u00a0is the charm of an adult. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 It is incredible.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but feel that they were exchanging a few risque words.Compared to the younger girls, Sakie was already at the age where she could be called an aunt, but the appearance of her body in her underwear was fresh and youthful, and she was by no means inferior to the younger girls.\u201c\u2026Yawn.\u201dShe almost let out a loud yawn and reflexively put her hand over her mouth.Sakie was the only one who was awake right now; Ryuichi and the others were still dreaming peacefully.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRyuichi\u2026kuun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichiii.\u201d\u201cRyuchi-kun\u2026\u00a0Zzz.\u201dCompared to Ryuichi, a good sleeper who made no movements at all, the girls around him were sleeptalking, muttering his name in their sleep as if they were seeing Ryuichi even in their dreams. Smiling at the joys of youth, Sakie looked around the room where Ryuichi lived.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHer honest impression was that it was certainly a man\u2019s room. However, she could imagine how lonely it would be to be in this room all alone for so long. For Sakie, her husband had already passed away and all she had left was Shizuna, but still, having a core family member close by was definitely a source of relief for her. This fact was no different even for an adult like Sakie, and she knew not how much Shizuna\u2019s presence had helped her since her husband\u2019s passing.\u201cYou\u2019re such a strong boy, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dSakie thought that Ryuichi, having lived all by himself, was very strong. Of course, she had a slight inkling of the sadness he was carrying, but the more she learned about him, the more she wanted to praise him for having endured so well.\u201c\u2026Hup.\u201dSakie slowly approached Ryuichi so as to not wake the young\u2019uns up. The sight of a bewitching woman in her underwear moving on all fours was sure to arouse a man\u2019s lust, but Ryuichi was the only man in the room, and besides, Sakie had no intention of showing such a defenseless figure to any man but him.\u201cRyuichi-kun, you\u2019re free to come to our house whenever you want, okay?\u201dShe had previously suggested to Ryuichi that he should come live with them, and she meant it. It was partly because she was in love with Ryuichi\u2019s manliness, but also because as an adult, she wanted to spoil him as much as she could, as he had never known the love of a parent. In fact, she was willing to be like another mother to him from now on, and if he wanted, she would become his real mother.\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019ll be necessary. You\u2019re surrounded by so much love, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dSakie loved him, of course, but so did Shizuna, with whom he was officially dating, and Chisa and Satsuki also had sincere feelings for Ryuichi.It was precisely because Ryuichi was surrounded by so much love that he was able to look forward to the future without being corrupted.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yo.\u201dIt seemed Ryuichi had woken up. Incidentally, they were currently in a state where Sakie was on all fours looking down at the sleeping Ryuichi\u2026which meant that, to the other girls, it would\u2019ve looked as if Sakie was about to attack Ryuichi.Of course, Ryuichi, who had just woken up, knew otherwise, so he gave a small laugh and hugged Sakie\u2019s body as hard as he could.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cLet me stay like this for a bit\u2026 Indulge me in this, okay?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSeemingly fawning on Sakie, he buried his face in her ample bosom and entwined his legs with hers, as if to keep her from getting away. Since he usually never showed such spoiled mannerisms, this gesture of Ryuichi in his half-asleep state stimulated Sakie\u2019s maternal instincts to the extreme.\u201cYes, please fawn on me to your heart\u2019s content.\u201dThus, Sakie decided to simply respond to Ryuichi\u2019s request and let him do as he pleased. Of course, Sakie herself felt Ryuichi\u2019s warmth so strongly that she hugged his muscular body tightly, as if to say that she would never let him go.\u201c\u2026Just as I\u2019d expect from you, Mom.\u201d\u201cYes, this is certainly as expected of you,\u00a0Sakie-san.\u201d\u201cSo this is the magnanimity of an adult.\u201dIt seemed that everybody had been awake.\u201cAlright, Ryuichi, see you later.\u201d\u201cSee you all later.\u201dTime passed, and when afternoon arrived, Chisa and Satsuki decided to head home first. Ryuichi proposed that he walk them home, but Chisa said she would walk Satsuki to her apartment, so there was no need. Well, it was still daytime and bright, so there should be nothing to worry about.\u201cStill gonna hang around, you two?\u201d\u201cYes. Just a little longer.\u201d\u201cIf Shizuna is staying, I\u2019m staying too.\u201dThe beautiful mother and daughter duo remained, relaxing and enjoying their time in their own way in the room, which was dirty compared to their house. Ryuichi was thankful that they were still here, as it was much better than having to spend his time alone, and he opened the fridge to get a drink.\u201c\u2026Man, this is just superb stuff.\u201dInside the fridge, Sakie\u2019s cooking was wrapped in plastic wrap and stored. It was her version of the meat and potato stew that Shizuna had cooked for him in the past, and it looked very delicious, thanks to the fact that both her and her daughter were excellent cooks.\u201cI was so surprised when I opened my eyes. You were making your way to Ryuichi-kun on all fours, Mom.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. That was just how cute Ryuichi-kun was.\u201d\u201cI totally get that!\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dHere we go again.\u00a0Ryuichi shrugged his shoulders.For him, it had been a pleasure to wake up in the morning and see a beautiful woman in her underwear, and the fact that it was Sakie made for a wonderful sight. The other three people sleeping around him had also been in their underwear, so the wonderful scenery extended beyond Sakie as well.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve got a really extravagant life, huh.\u201dBut well, that\u2019s a good thing, too,\u00a0Ryuichi thought as he inwardly laughed.Summer vacation was almost over, but it went without saying that it had been a truly fulfilling vacation for Ryuichi. Unlike last year, these past few days seemed to fill him to the depths of his soul, and although he was worried that there could be some kind of repercussion or aftereffect, agonizing over it wouldn\u2019t do him any good.\u201cRyuichi-kun, I\u2019ll make lots of bentos for you, like for the upcoming sports festival. Look forward to it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dRather than the fun times being over so soon, perhaps the truly fulfilling days for Ryuichi were yet to come. He then walked them home and was made an alluring invitation to stay the night at their place, but he declined.\u201cMaybe I should do a little shopping.\u201dInstead of heading straight home, Ryuichi started walking toward the city. The lingering atmosphere from last night\u2019s fireworks display was all but gone, and business as usual had returned.\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201dIt was then that Ryuichi spotted an unlikely duo. It was a couple, a man and a woman. One of them was Makoto and the other was the girl with glasses he had seen the other day.\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201dRyuichi had no idea what was going on for Makoto to be with the same girl whom he\u2019d tried to pick up last time but stopped because she had a boyfriend\u2026 He truly had no clue.Makoto looked the same as usual, but the girl was smiling happily as she conversed with Makoto, and it was obvious that she had the hots for him.\u201cNo way. Did he\u2026do\u00a0her?\u201dRyuichi never would\u2019ve expected them to be in that sort of situation, and he just kept staring at their backs. Eventually though, he could only have so much curiosity in them before he removed his gaze.\u201cWell, whatever. It\u2019s time to go shopping, shopping.\u201dAnd so, this was how his wonderful summer vacation came to an end.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Shizuna\u2019s Sensibilities Are Also, Well\u2026Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2018Sup.\u201d\u201cMorning, Shishido.\u201d\u201cMornin\u2019.\u201dSummer vacation was over, and the second semester had begun. When Ryuichi entered the classroom after the considerably lengthy holiday period, he was greeted back by his classmates who had arrived earlier.\u201cHow did you spend your holiday, Shishido?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? He must\u2019ve flirted around with Shizuna.\u201d\u201c\u2026Damn you, you normie.\u201d\u201cWell, you aren\u2019t wrong in saying we flirted.\u201dRyuichi was deeply moved to be approached by both boys and girls. When Shizuna\u2019s name was mentioned, she, who had been speaking with her friends as well, immediately made a dash for Ryuichi.\u201cI feel like I heard my name here.\u201d\u201cYeah. We were just talking about how you and Shishido-kun must\u2019ve spent your summer vacation flirting around and being lovey-dovey with each other.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t that supposed to be obvious by now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna said this with her hands on her hips, as if it were a matter of course. When it came to matters concerning Ryuichi, it was becoming more and more common for her to confidently speak of her relationship with him like this, but that just meant that her feelings for him were so strong to the point where she was strongly declaring it like this.\u201c\u2018Sup guys!\u201dAs the class was already getting lively first thing in the morning, Makoto also entered the classroom. He seemed to be the same as usual, and Ryuichi immediately decided to ask him about what had been weighing on his mind.\u201cHey, Makoto.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI saw you the other day. Weren\u2019t you with that girl with the glasses we met that one time?\u201d\u201cAh, you saw that?\u201dIt seemed he had no intention of hiding it.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you said that girl had a boyfriend, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHuh? Wait, did you lay your hands on a girl who\u2019s already taken?\u201d\u201cNah, there\u2019s a really deep and profound reason for that, you see.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem to be anything particularly serious, as he was laughing and smiling as he spoke. After all their classmates except Shizuna had returned to their seats, Makoto explained to them what had happened.\u201cTo tell you the truth, it looks like she was cheated on by her boyfriend, y\u2019know? \u2026Well, she sorta had first row seats to the crime.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cCheating\u2026\u201dIt seemed Shizuna clenched her fists tightly at the word \u201ccheating.\u201d Although he understood to some extent what she was imagining, he took her hand to reassure her that, at least with the current him, she had nothing to worry about.\u201cStop flirting so naturally.\u201d\u201cShut it. So?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dMakoto continued.\u201cThat girl isn\u2019t a beauty by any stretch of the imagination, but her sister has absolutely killer looks. So, when she went to her boyfriend\u2019s house, she saw him fucking her own sister.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s horrible\u2026\u201dHowever, in this day and age, it was neither surprising nor uncommon for one\u2019s own sister to have a relationship like that with their boyfriend.She may have wanted to harass her little sister whom she considered inferior to her, or she may have had some other purpose, but as far as Ryuichi was concerned, it was probably not a good one.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t very assertive in the first place, so not only did her sister run her mouth at her, her boyfriend also told her he was no longer interested in her, apparently. That was when I saw her walking around with a downcast look on her face.\u201dSo that\u2019s kind of drama there was with that girl, huh, Ryuichi thought. And so, she told everything to Makoto, who had approached her before, albeit to pick her up, and Makoto, upon hearing this, took her around to various places to get her to smile.\u201cSo even you\u2019ve got a soft spot in you, huh.\u201d\u201cOi, what are you trying to say with that?\u201dRyuichi\u2019s shoulders trembled as he laughed, but he looked into Makoto\u2019s eyes firmly and continued with the following words.\u201cIt was just a figure of speech. I know you\u2019re a good and kind friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026That was off-kilter.\u201dMakoto embarrassedly scratched his cheek and looked away.He had had his suspicions because the Makoto he saw, though by chance at the time, also seemed to be enjoying himself, but apparently they weren\u2019t in that sort of relationship.Ryuichi\u2019s intuition was that Makoto was still a flamboyant guy at heart, so that girl was likely outside his strike zone\u2026 But, well, one could never know if he\u2019d had a change of heart like Ryuichi did.Time passed, and after school, Ryuichi was hanging out with Shizuna in the city. It was a leisurely date with no particular aim, but to tell the truth, Shizuna had not said much since they left school, as if she was thinking about something.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026well.\u201dWhen Ryuichi turned his gaze at her to see what was troubling her, Shizuna spoke to him.\u201cI was just wondering how it must feel to cheat on someone.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dRyuichi listened to her words, although he couldn\u2019t help but feel that he\u2019d heard something similar before.\u201cAccording to Makoto\u2019s story, the sister didn\u2019t think well of her sibling and went out of her way to steal her boyfriend away from her by blatantly having sex with him\u2026 I\u2019m not her sister, so I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, but I can\u2019t imagine giving my body to a man for that sole reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I think that\u2019s a normal sentiment to have, y\u2019know?\u201dWhat Shizuna was saying wasn\u2019t wrong in the slightest and was perfectly normal. However, it was true that there were a certain number of people in the world who had such broken and warped sensibilities, and if anything, Shizuna was probably in the slightly eccentric category herself.\u201cI guess it all comes down to the kind of thoughts and intentions you have behind it, but then again, you\u2019re also doing something that would make normal people tilt their heads, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dShe confusedly tilted her head to the side.\u201cYou and I are formally dating, yet you allow me to continue my relationships with Chisa and the other girls, so in that regard you\u2019re an outlier too. But, well, so am I.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026 Muuuu.\u201dOne-on-one relationships were fundamentally the norm. Ryuichi wasn\u2019t particularly bothered by their current arrangement, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for him to suddenly agonize over it either. After all, he was doing nothing more than taking advantage of the kindness of Shizuna, Chisa and the other girls.\u201cIt\u2019s fine when it\u2019s you, Ryuichi-kun! Everybody wants this, after all!\u201dIt was precisely because she said things like this that Ryuichi ended up presuming upon their kindness. It was certainly an important matter, but both Ryuichi and Shizuna decided to shelve the thought for the time being, as overthinking it would only tire them out.\u201c\u2026But you know, I never would\u2019ve expected you to say something like that.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSeeing as it was a good opportunity, Ryuichi decided to bring the following matter up.\u201cHow would you feel if you were in a relationship with someone other than me and I showed up to break you two off?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d be happy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Err.\u201dRyuichi wanted to say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to say,\u201d but Shizuna\u2019s heart was already biased toward Ryuichi when he made this analogy, so it seems that such words came naturally for her.\u201cI know hypotheticals are one thing, but\u2026to be honest, I can\u2019t imagine myself dating a man other than you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cThat makes me happy to hear.\u201d\u201cRight, right, so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t really answer your question\u2026 And besides.\u201d\u201c?\u201dShizuna looked down a little. Having reddened all the way to the tips of her ears, she quietly whispered.\u201c\u2026You made me realize, didn\u2019t you? About my own sexual dispositions, or rather, my rather sinful fetish.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah~.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t ever show that side of me to anyone\u2026not that I have any intention of doing so! I\u2019m the kind of woman who, even before we were dating, got off on fantasies where I was attacked by you.\u201dShizuna was pure and innocent\u2026 Again, to be clear, Shizuna was\u00a0pure\u00a0and\u00a0innocent. But it was Ryuichi\u2019s influence that had made it possible for her to say things like these, and it was also Ryuichi who had brought out her hidden masochistic side. Ryuichi didn\u2019t really think much of it, but it seemed Shizuna in particular was ashamed of how sloven and disheveled she was in bed.\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that now, if you ask me. Besides, being able to make a beautiful woman like you look that disheveled at my hands alone is pretty pleasing.\u201d\u201cBut there should be limits\u2026 Especially when it comes to that\u2026that face!\u201dThe face that Shizuna mentioned must\u2019ve been referring to the one in the picture she\u2019d seen earlier. No matter how beautiful her face may be, when she was in a state of pleasure, her expression became slovenly and debauched, revealing a vulgar, panting face. In a way, this was reminiscent of the Shizuna who\u2019d begun getting corrupted in the manga, but in Ryuichi\u2019s opinion, this was also one of her charms.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You can get as debauched as you want with me. I love each and every part of you.\u201d\u201cGuh\u2026 It frustrates me how those words make me happy and excited at the same time!\u201dIt was useless for her to resist, since her body was already sensitive in the first place. It was an overly obscene conversation to have while walking around town, but of course, considering that there weren\u2019t many people around, no one had heard them.Shizuna also seemed to have a lot of worries and concerns herself, but Ryuichi whispered those words in her ear to reassure her and paint over those worries too.\u201cHnng\u2026 I wuv you~. \u266a\u201dBut, well, it was probably more apt to call her current expression something other than that of \u2018reassurance.\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Everybody At The Nightclubbbb!Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cYo, Ryuichi, what\u2019re you gonna do about the sports festival?\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019ll probably just laze around or hit on a girl from outside.\u201d\u201cYou never change, do ya?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dRyuichi laughed as he recalled this exchange he\u2019d had during last year\u2019s sports festival. Looking back on it now, it was baffling how much of a lust-crazed womanizer he used to be, but then again, he felt that he was still fundamentally the same even now considering what he was doing with Shizuna and the other girls.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201dShizuna, who was sitting next to him, was tilting her head to the side.It was currently PE class, and since the sports festival is coming up, each student was in the middle of some physical training. Ryuichi had also just finished running with Makoto and Kaname, and sprinting because he was going to run a short-distance race.\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201cI probably don\u2019t need to ask, but\u2026 What\u2019s the matter, Princess?\u201dShizuna had called Ryuichi\u2019s name with twinkles in her eyes. Ryuichi, who was more or less aware of what she was thinking, asked her this while keeping in mind the gazes of those around him. There was about 30 minutes left of class time, but his other classmates were either still exercising or taking a break.\u201cCan I scooch a little closer to you?\u201dAs mentioned earlier, Ryuichi had just gotten back from working out a ton, plus, they were currently in the peak of summer, so he was sweating rather profusely.So, Shizuna\u2019s eyes were sparkling, Ryuichi was sweating, and she wanted to get closer to him\u2026 Ryuichi could clearly tell what she was thinking.\u201c\u2026Do you like the stench of sweat that much?\u201d\u201cYup. \u266a To me, though, it\u2019s not really a \u2018stench\u2019 so much as it\u2019s a \u2018scent.\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m so lost.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t surprising that he didn\u2019t smell his own sweat that often; the only time he did was when a towel or a piece of undressed clothing came close to his nose. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant smell by any stretch of the imagination, but even so, Shizuna still seemed to like it.\u201cThere we go.\u201dMoving her body, she came so close to him that she was barely touching his shoulder. She then turned her body toward him and sniffed his scent, and her cheeks gradually turned even redder. There was a subtle look of intoxication in her eyes, and she slowly reached out and touched Ryuichi\u2019s arm.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard and big\u2026 I love it.\u201dWords alone could be very misleading. On an unrelated point, when the manga about this world drawn in Ryuichi\u2019s previous life was completed, a survey was conducted to find out which phrase Shizuna had said that excited readers the most, and the words that the once innocent Shizuna had uttered with an enraptured look on her face after her corruption\u2014the words she\u2019d said just now\u2014had been the indisputable winner.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard and biig~\u2026 I loveee it~. \u266a\u201dHer expression in the manga and her expression now were very similar, and that alone was enough to arouse Ryuichi.\u201cYou\u2019re too lewd.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who made me that way, aren\u2019t you?\u201dEven in her replies, she chose words that tickled men\u2019s hearts and threw them at them with precision. One could either take this as Shizuna having grown and matured, or as a source of change\u2026 It was probably the latter, and Ryuichi was the one who\u2019d caused it.\u201cBut you know, I think me being Mom\u2019s daughter played a role in it, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah~.\u201dCome to think of it, that\u2019s right,\u00a0he thought as he recalled the beautiful Sakie, who was very similar to Shizuna. She, too, had a masochistic side to her and a smell and muscle fetish, but at the same time, she had the same receptiveness, gentleness, and inner strength as Shizuna. Shizuna had inherited both the good and the bad from her, making them indeed mother and daughter.\u201cHey, Ryuichi-kun, can we move to the shade?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do I dare ask what things you\u2019re planning to do there?\u201d\u201cWhat things? \u2026There\u2019s only one\u00a0thing\u00a0to play with here, isn\u2019t there?\u201dShe grinned suggestively as she stuck her tongue out. Shizuna probably meant it as a joke, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to do such a reckless thing anyway since they were in the middle of class right now. In fact, they\u2019d already decided not to do such things at school in the first place, so she\u00a0must\u2019ve\u00a0meant it as a joke.She\u2019s really turned erotic, hasn\u2019t she? I know she\u2019s joking, but the Shizuna of the past would\u2019ve never said things like that.It seemed that in a way, Shizuna really did have an affinity for such character traits, after all. Be that as it may, he thought she had had a nontrivial amount of intent to make fun of him, even if only in jest, so it was only natural that he return the favor.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThey weren\u2019t visible to the eyes of those around them, so he pulled on Shizuna\u2019s arm, who was still smiling nonchalantly. With a small scream, she settled into Ryuichi\u2019s chest. He then tried to play more pranks on her, but she started sniffing his scent very intensely.\u201c\u2026Haaaah. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi put an end to his prank and slowly separated himself from Shizuna. Then, he and a disgruntled-eyed Shizuna resumed running with the rest of their classmates.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Shizuna?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing at all.\u201d\u201cNothing at all, you say\u2026 Ohh, haha~.\u201dShizuna glanced at Ryuichi, then quickly averted her gaze. Seeing this, her friends immediately knew something had happened between them, and they directed indescribably lukewarm gazes toward Ryuichi.\u201cHey, Shishido-kun, a junior of mine looks to be interested in you. If you\u2019re okay with it, could you maybe meet her sometime\u2014\u201dHalfway through her words, the girl became unable to speak due to the pressure Shizuna put on her.And so, their eventful PE class ended just like that. Time passed, and it was now after school.\u201cAh, Shishido.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dSohei approached him as he was getting ready to leave. Their relationship had improved to the extent that he was able to talk to Shizuna as well as Ryuichi in a friendly manner, even though Shizuna was nearby.\u201cYou work part-time at\u00a0that\u00a0place, right?\u201d\u201cYep. It just so happens that I have a shift today, too.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Can I come visit today?\u201d\u201c\u2026Heh, you don\u2019t need to ask for my permission, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cAh, then I\u2019ll come visit too.\u201dThey both stared at Shizuna, but apparently it was now a done deal. They then temporarily parted with Sohei and Ryuichi changed into his casual clothes before heading to Shizuna\u2019s house.\u201cI never would\u2019ve expected Sohei-kun to say something like that\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it means he\u2019s changed too.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true. But.\u201dPerhaps what Shizuna was concerned about was that Sohei\u2019s mother would find out. Sohei\u2019s mother seemed to be quite fastidious and would probably never allow her son to go to such an establishment. Yet despite that, the reason Sohei had decided to come visit was likely because of the kindness and warmth of the manager, Mihara, and the other women.\u201cTo be blunt, I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll get scammed or tricked by some unruly couple in there.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay.\u201dHe was sure Sohei could tell the good from the bad, and besides, the employees of the club where Ryuichi worked were genuinely good people, so there was no point in worrying about it\u2026 Well, there were certainly some people who got completely absorbed in their encounters, but he was sure Sohei would be fine.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201d\u201cYo.\u201dSohei joined them, and the three of them headed for the club. Shizuna and Sohei sat at the counter where they could see the manager, while Ryuichi was hard at work by the manager\u2019s side.\u201c\u2026Why do I feel as if I\u2019m being observed?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. By the way, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come to visit, boy.\u201d\u201cT-Thank you, sir.\u201dSohei still seemed to be nervous. Approaching from behind Sohei was one of the employees, Mihara, who had previously accompanied him.\u201cWelcome, Sohei-kun.\u201d\u201cH-Hi\u2026 Mihara-shan.\u201dHe stuttered on his words a little, but that couldn\u2019t be helped since he\u2019d suddenly been hugged by her from behind. Though in this case, Mihara was standing and Sohei was sitting, so it would be more correct to say that she stuck her body close to his. She wrapped her arms around Sohei from behind, and Mihara\u2019s mounds were directly touching the back of his head.\u201cWhat a naughty boy you are to come to a place like this.\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t call it a \u2018place like this.\u2019\u201dThe manager naturally inserted a retort. Then, Ryuichi and Mihara took their seats to serve Shizuna and Sohei, respectively.\u201cI see. So it\u2019s almost time for the sports festival, huh?\u201d\u201cYes. I did a lot of preparation today, and\u2014\u201dAs Sohei got used to the atmosphere, he slowly got more fluent with his words, but still, he really did seem to be getting used to the place. Was it charming, or was it more appropriate to call it strange and peculiar? \u2026Ryuichi and Shizuna were staring at him when the manager blurted out a few words.\u201cMihara had a little brother, but he passed away a long time ago.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThe manager nodded.\u201cMaybe she sees him in the boy. Well, we\u2019ll just have to see how things change between them from here on out, but I hope something good happens for them.\u201dAlthough the manager had phrased it as such, Ryuichi and Shizuna could tell what he meant by that. They thought about how wonderful it\u2019d be if it came true, and they let smiles show on their faces.\u201cHey, boss, can we have some orange juice?\u201d\u201cSure\u2026 Ah, we\u2019re out.\u201d\u201cSo there ain\u2019t any juice\u2026\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t any juice, huh\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go buy some.\u201dThe manager in charge of the restaurant told them not to leave their seats, and they laughed as hard as they could to stop him from becoming so depressed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71\u201cWith this, I now declare the commencement of the sports festival. All visitors\u2014\u201dThe big event after the summer break, the sports festival, was finally underway. Many tents were set up around the grounds, and they were all filled to the brim by the students\u2019 parents. Since the number of students in the school was quite large, the number of parents was also equally large. Additionally, there were also people from other schools, the neighborhood, and others who\u2019d come to visit the school for a tour, making it very lively.\u201c\u2026So hot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s boiling out here\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hell on earth.\u201dIn the midst of this bustling and joyful atmosphere, Ryuichi and his usual friends were already feeling defeated by the heat. The competition hadn\u2019t even started yet, and they hadn\u2019t moved their bodies at all, so it was worrying to imagine what the future held for them.\u201cHere, have a sports drink.\u201d\u201cThanks, Shizuna.\u201dHe took the drink from Shizuna, who was standing beside him, and chugged it down with big gulps. Shizuna laughed at his overly vigorous gulping, but perhaps she liked the sight of him doing that too as she stared at him.\u201cBut man\u2026they actually ended up coming, huh.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dRyuichi took his mouth off the bottle and looked in a certain direction. There, of course, was Shizuna\u2019s mother, Sakie, but she was also accompanied by Chisa and Satsuki.\u201cI didn\u2019t know they\u2019d come too\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know about Chisa-san and Satsuki-san either. They really stand out, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cOf course they do.\u201dIt went without saying for Chisa and Satsuki, but Sakie also had a very youthful and vibrant appearance that it was hard to believe that she had a child. She was probably too beautiful a woman in the eyes of the other students\u2019 fathers who were present here.Although the same couldn\u2019t be said for Sakie and Satsuki, Chisa was wearing a very revealing outfit, so she was gathering many gazes on her.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dThe three of them noticed Ryuichi and Shizuna and waved at them. Makoto and Kaname grinned widely, but the rest of the students snuck glances at them, seemingly wondering what kind of relationship they had with each other, which made Ryuichi uncomfortable.\u201cWell, I guess all we can do is simply think of them like a peanut gallery.\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like the girls had been trying to deliberately create a fuss, either; they had purely come to see Ryuichi and Shizuna, so they couldn\u2019t just act indifferent toward them.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that Satsuki-san came like this, but it seems she\u2019s only got eyes for you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dShizuna muttered this with a chuckle. It was only a guess, but his\u2026Akira\u2019s\u00a0parents should also be here, so perhaps she\u2019d already spoken to them. Under normal circumstances, Satsuki would\u2019ve come here to see her brother, Akira, but certainly, as Shizuna had said, she was currently only looking at Ryuichi.\u201cBut it looks like he doesn\u2019t really care about her anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true. He really doesn\u2019t seem anxious or uneasy at all.\u201dAkira was by Sohei\u2019s side, but he didn\u2019t seem to care about his sister as he enjoyed conversing with his friends.\u201cThe first event, the scavenger hunt, is about to begin. All participating students, please gather at the entrance gate.\u201dIt seemed the competition was about to begin in earnest. For the scavenger hunt, both Ryuichi and Shizuna would be participating, so they headed for the entrance gate side by side. From there, they were escorted by a committee member to the field.\u201c\u2026Fufu.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dWhile they were sitting and waiting for their turn, Shizuna suddenly burst out laughing. When Ryuichi asked her what was up, she replied with the following:\u201cI still remember last year. Ryuichi-kun, you didn\u2019t participate in any of the competitions\u2026 In fact, it was like you didn\u2019t even exist.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cute how you, a former delinquent known by everybody, is now participating in the sports festival like this. Also, you look cute in your gym uniform.\u201d\u201c\u2026The heck does that mean?\u201dShizuna uttered something unusual: how Ryuichi was cute in his gym clothes. Perhaps Ryuichi would never understand, and only Shizuna would know what she meant by that.\u201cIt really does mean a lot for the both of us to be able to participate in this together\u2026 Let\u2019s have fun.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt would be a loss if he didn\u2019t enjoy himself since it felt like he\u2019d worked hard and helped out in many ways in preparation for this day. As he and Shizuna lapsed into their own world like that, it came time for Ryuichi to go first.Shizuna saw him off, and Ryuichi stood at the starting point. The boys on either side of him were both seniors, but Ryuichi\u2019s physique was overwhelmingly large compared to theirs.\u201c\u2026So huge.\u201d\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lose\u2026\u201dIt seemed like a strange rivalry was stoked in them. The sound of a pistol shot rang out with a bang, and Ryuichi and the boys made a run for the theme box.\u2026The specs on this body are seriously insane.Ryuichi had no idea how many times he was reminded how strong his body was. He was reasonably fast just by running normally, and although there wasn\u2019t that great a distance, he was still much faster than the two people running beside him.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Huh?\u201dIncidentally, it was custom for every year\u2019s scavenger hunt to have a few silly themes in it. It seemed that Ryuichi had drawn one of them this time.\u201cA person who\u2019s emotionally supported you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi froze, albeit for a moment, but then he immediately broke into a run. In truth, when he saw the theme, his body turned toward Shizuna, but it was the image of Chisa that flashed through his mind. He had met her earlier than anyone else that Ryuichi was close to, and in a way, she was the one who had supported his heart emotionally.\u201cMy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dRyuichi went to the place where Chisa and the others were standing and took Chisa\u2019s hand, saying, \u201cCome.\u201d A woman who was watching the whole thing unfold blushed when Ryuichi, in a manner that brokered no argument, told Chisa, \u201cCome,\u201d and a man who was standing next to her, who appeared to be her husband, looked surprised, but Ryuichi did not pay them any heed.\u201cI-It\u2019s been really long since I\u2019ve run, though!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, hang in there.\u201dIt was true that Chisa wasn\u2019t the type to exercise like this, but despite that, she had an exquisite figure that was the envy of all women in the world, which was a huge deal.Running made Chisa\u2019s large, cleavage-revealing breasts sway, which was probably a bit too stimulating for the eyes of high school boys.\u201cGoal! The second-year student Shishido-kun has scored an impressive goal with a beautiful woman in tow!\u201dThe student council president, who simultaneously acted as a play-by-play commentator and analyst, was very hyped up as well.When Ryuichi handed the person in charge the piece of paper with the theme written on it, they tilted their head at him, but they did not ask him about it because it was, in a sense, a private matter. However, Chisa seemed to be curious about what the theme was.\u201cHey, can I have a look?\u201d\u201cSure, here you go.\u201dWhen Chisa saw the paper handed to her by the PIC, she froze for a moment and immediately jumped to her feet, looking like she was about to cry.\u201cRyuichiii!! You thought of me that way? Uwaaaaaaaaah!!\u201d\u201cH-Hey\u2026\u201dApparently, he\u2019d landed a direct attack on Chisa\u2019s heart. With Chisa in his arms, Ryuichi carried her back to where she had been and left Chisa in the care of Sakie and Satsuki.\u201cWhat was the theme?\u201d\u201c\u2026A person who emotionally supported me.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s definitely one for Chisa-san. Although it does vex me a little.\u201dShizuna giggled, and then it came time for her turn. With the sound of the pistol, Shizuna started running. She read the paper with the theme written on it, then came running straight for Ryuichi.\u201c\u2026I feel like I can sorta guess what you got.\u201d\u201cFufu, come on, hurry up!\u201dHolding hands with Shizuna, he started running again after having just run earlier. The theme she got was then read out as per her request, and the committee member\u2019s mouth revealed the contents of the theme.\u201cThe theme is \u2018A person you love.\u2019\u201dI knew it.\u00a0In a way, it was just as Ryuichi had imagined. Fundamentally speaking, when a theme like this came up, if one had a lover, they would likely go to them; otherwise, some people would bring their family members with them.As soon as the theme was read out, there was an annoying whistling noise from Makoto and Kaname, but Ryuichi just glared at them sharply.\u201cDon\u2019t glare at us like that. \u266a\u201dRyuichi was certainly not in a bad mood, but Shizuna had an even brighter smile on her face. Thus, the sports festival had started off on a bit of a turbulent tone, and with Ryuichi\u2019s participation, there was sure to be more chaos\u2026 But, well, since Ryuichi was well received by all but a few people, this sports festival would surely be a fun one.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72\u201cYou had a hell of a showing out there, in more ways than one.\u201d\u201cOh, shut it.\u201dRyuichi shrugged his shoulders as Sohei said this with a smirk on his face. Ryuichi running with Chisa and then with Shizuna had attracted quite a bit of attention.\u201cWhat, did it look like Beauty and the Beast or something?\u201d\u201cNo? I just thought you suited them perfectly: a handsome man running together with beautiful women.\u201d\u201c\u2026You.\u201dHe himself knew that he had a terrifying face, but even so, he had recently been accepted by everyone, so Ryuichi was of course happy about this change. Still, being called a handsome man by Sohei, with whom he\u2019d once had a strained though not hostile relationship, was a considerable change.\u201cI know it\u2019s kinda late for this, but you\u2019ve seriously changed, huh.\u201d\u201cIf you put it that way, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve changed way more than me, Shishido.\u201d\u201c\u2026Heh, for sure.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThen, since their turns were over for the time being, Ryuichi observed his surroundings with Sohei. Shizuna was in a circle of girls, cheering for her friends who were competing, while Sohei who was beside Ryuichi seemed to be restlessly looking for something.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Umm.\u201dHis seemingly embarrassed mannerisms piqued his curiosity.\u201cAre you looking for someone?\u201d\u201c\u2026Mihara-san said she\u2019d be coming.\u201d\u201cDayum~.\u201dRyuichi knew he had been looking for somebody, but he never expected it to be Mihara. He patted Sohei on the back and said, \u201cWell done, man.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t actually ask her to come, though. While you and Shizuna were having dinner at the club, we were talking about the sports festival, remember? And then\u2026things somehow ended up going in that direction.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIn any case, it was surprising that Mihara would take the time to personally show up at the sports festival for Sohei. Although he knew that she had a liking for Sohei, he was surprised that she would go that far. For Ryuichi, Mihara was one of the many people who had helped him in the past, and Sohei had also become a friend of his despite various circumstances.\u201cI\u2019ll help you look, too. Ain\u2019t got nothing better to do, anyways.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201dTaking his eyes off the matches on the field, Ryuichi started walking with Sohei. However, they ended up finding Mihara surprisingly easily.\u201cAh, Mihara-san!\u201dWhen Sohei called out to her, she waved her hand at them. Of course, she wasn\u2019t wearing as flashy an attire as she did in the club because she was going outside; her appearance sat somewhere between Chisa\u2019s and Satsuki\u2019s.\u201cHi there, Sohei-kun; you, too, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cYo.\u201dRyuichi could make eye contact with her as usual, but it was a little difficult for Sohei to look directly at Mihara, who looked different from usual. Perhaps Mihara had found such a Sohei cute, as she approached him with a giggle.\u201cIt\u2019s really hot today, huh? Make sure you two hydrate yourselves enough, okay?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWhat an energetic response from him. After that, Ryuichi didn\u2019t really join in their conversation, instead opting to quietly watch them from the sidelines, but the mood they had was pretty good. From Mihara\u2019s point of view, it may have felt no different than dealing with her younger brother, but it was certainly clear that she held a fondness for him.It just goes to show that love doesn\u2019t come in one form alone, so even if your first love doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019ll always be able to find a new love like this.The fact that even Sohei, who had once been in the throes of despair, could smile again like this was proof that he was looking ahead. In this regard, Ryuichi, who had been haunted by the shadow of his family for years, had been far more chained by his past than Sohei, who had all but recovered in a few weeks.\u201c\u2026Geez, he might be even stronger than me, huh.\u201dHe muttered those few words.\u201cWooooooo!!\u201d\u201cGo, go, gooooo!!\u201dWhile he\u2019d been watching them like this, the games were still going on in the field, and there was a huge commotion. Ryuichi decided to leave the place slowly, thinking that Mihara had been found and there was no need for him to accompany them any further.\u201cThe sports festival, huh\u2026 Well, it\u2019s definitely festival-like.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say he\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0find it a hassle, but he still enjoyed this once-a-year event. It was to the point that he almost wished he\u2019d participated in this event last year.On his way back to where he\u2019d been originally, he found Shizuna scurrying around, looking for someone.\u201c\u2026Ah, right. I just up and disappeared, huh.\u201dRyuichi couldn\u2019t say for sure that she was necessarily looking for him, but when she spotted him, she immediately broke into a smile and ran over to him.\u201cRyuichi-kun! Where did you go?\u201d\u201cDid I make you look for me?\u201d\u201cYes. I want to be by your side as much as possible, you see\u2026\u201dHe apologized, saying, \u201cSorry for that,\u201d as he stroked her head. On the way back, he told her that he\u2019d been looking for Mihara with Sohei. Shizuna was surprised, but she smiled happily.\u201cI don\u2019t know about Mihara-san, but I wonder if Sohei has started on his path toward a new love.\u201d\u201cMaybe. But it\u2019s not gonna be an easy one since she\u2019s an adult.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Love is a wonderful thing, no matter what form it takes.\u201dHe felt a little strange as he looked at Shizuna\u2019s profile while she muttered those words.His and Shizuna\u2019s next turn would not be for a while, so they had some free time, but at times like this, it was probably normal to cheer for your own team. However, he took Shizuna\u2019s hand and headed toward a different direction from the field.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201dHe took Shizuna to the shade of a tree. Neither students nor parents would ever come to a place like this since they would all have their eyes on the field. Shizuna looked up at him with her back against the tree, somewhat bewildered, but he could see in her eyes that she was also expecting something.\u201cI\u2019m not really sure myself, but I\u2019m kind of in the mood for that.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Fufu, that\u2019s just what I wanted to hear. \u266a\u201dNo sooner had she said that than Ryuichi stole her soft lips. Shizuna didn\u2019t try to avoid him or push his body away at all; she simply accepted him. The shouts and cheers faded into the background, and Ryuichi and Shizuna made their own private world.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dShizuna sounded sad when Ryuichi\u2019s lips parted from hers. In all honesty, he couldn\u2019t deny that he\u2019d had\u00a0those\u00a0kinds of intentions in mind when he did this, but of course, he\u2019d changed from last year, so he knew what he could and couldn\u2019t do.\u201c\u2026Ah~, anything more than this is gonna have to wait till we get home.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cOi.\u201dHe lightly gave Shizuna a chop on the head. He knew she wasn\u2019t an unreasonable girl, so she probably wouldn\u2019t push the matter\u2026or so he\u2019d thought.\u201cJust now.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cJust now, you made a face as if you were holding back from letting loose like last year\u2019s Ryuichi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHow could she tell?\u00a0As Ryuichi\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, Shizuna immediately closed the distance between them. Her expression seemed to say that she wanted him to carve her a new memory for herself, and that she would paint over it.\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dIn the end, it wasn\u2019t until 20 minutes later that the two returned to the field. Well, it was a bit of an indulgent experience as a student, but they just laughed, knowing that this too would become another memory of theirs. Incidentally, Shizuna had worked up a sweat\u2014two types of sweat, of course\u2014but it seemed that she still had some pheromones wafting in the air and thus attracted a little bit of attention.\u201c\u2026I wonder if Chisa-san and the others will notice.\u201d\u201cI think they will. They\u2019ll definitely notice.\u201dNow that they\u2019d done it, they had no other choice. If anyone asked them anything, they would just honestly tell them that they couldn\u2019t hold themselves back.\u201cThis concludes the morning events. After a one-hour break, the afternoon events will begin.\u201dWith this announcement from the student council president, the morning games came to an end. Since they had promised to eat the lunch that Sakie had made for them together, they headed for a section of the gym that was open to the public.\u201cAh, Ryuichiii!!\u201d\u201cOof.\u201dThe moment they arrived, Chisa embraced Ryuichi for some reason. He didn\u2019t want her to cling to him too much because he was sweaty and dirty, but Chisa didn\u2019t seem to mind at all.\u201cYou know, Chisa-chan\u2019s been feeling really moved this whole time because of you, you know, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cMoved?\u201d\u201cYou got that theme, \u2018A person who\u2019s emotionally supported you,\u2019 then you chose Chisa-san, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s what this\u2019s about.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s rightt! It really moved mee!!\u201dIt was truly a rare sight to see her really moved to tears like this, even though she usually never showed herself crying. That was just how happy she was that Ryuichi had chosen her.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t cry. Here, wipe your tears.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 Yeah!\u201dBesides, her crying in a place like this would attract even more stares than it already had. When Ryuichi patted her shoulder to stop her crying, Chisa suddenly started sniffing him.\u201c\u2026You did\u00a0it, didn\u2019t you?\u201dShe\u2019d seen through him, just as he\u2019d expected. From there, they all sat down to have lunch and welcomed the afternoon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73The End of the Sports FestivalTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cNext up is the three-legged race. All participants, please\u2014\u201dThe noon section of the sports festival had progressed smoothly, and it was finally time for the big final event, the three-legged race. The competitors had already gathered in the center of the field, and among them were Ryuichi and Shizuna.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ve got this.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe three-legged race was a competition in which two people ran in pairs, and the most crucial factor to achieving victory was for both runners to synchronize their breathing and movements.While most pairs were male-male and female-female, Ryuichi\u2019s partner was, of course, Shizuna. Shizuna tied their legs together with a string and smiled happily.\u201cNow you won\u2019t be able to get away from me for a while, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026Normally those words would be a little terrifying, but since you\u2019re the one who\u2019s saying it, it just comes off as cute. Really cute.\u201dBoth Ryuichi and Shizuna had some free time on their hands since their turn had yet to come, but they were completely flirting with each other while cheering for their own team. Their classmates looked on with smiles, but the seniors and juniors, especially the boys without girlfriends, stared at them with vexed looks.\u201cOh, it\u2019s almost time.\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dFinally, it was their turn.\u201cDo your best out there, Shishido, Shizuna!\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dSohei cheered them on, and they replied back before lining up at the starting point. As usual, the grounds were filled with a lively atmosphere of cheering, and the voices of Chisa and the other girls could be heard quite loudly as the two lined up. Ryuichi and Shizuna both nodded at each other, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t lose this,\u201d and with the sound of the pistol signaling the start, they began their run.\u201cWoah, the Shishido-Shizuna pair is really fast!! Both their starting dash and their follow-up are swift and nimble!\u201dThe two of them were in perfect sync. Since it was a three-legged race, they could not run at full speed, and Ryuichi and Shizuna also had different strides when running, so Ryuichi was basically matching Shizuna\u2019s stride.\u201cOne, two; one, two; one, two.\u201d\u201cOne, two; one, two; one, two.\u201dThe two of them calmly chanted the shouts they\u2019d practiced as they ran. Perhaps the pairs behind them were struggling a bit, but the distance between Ryuichi and Shizuna and the others was quite wide, and they should be able to reach the goal with enough time to spare if they continued at this rate. However, it was then that an unexpected accident occurred.\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was Shizuna\u2019s voice. Ryuichi, drawn by her voice, turned his gaze quickly and saw a child jumping out of the audience seats. It seemed that they had come out to catch a ball that had rolled in front of them, but the timing at which they\u2019d done so was very bad.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cShizuna?!\u201dIt would have been best if they could avoid the kid, but it had happened so suddenly that they had no choice but to stop. Since their legs were connected by a string, stopping suddenly would naturally cause them to lose their balance slightly. Just as it seemed like they had fortunately come to a perfect stop, Shizuna fell to her knees and collapsed.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m okay.\u201dThe surroundings quieted down a little at the cute intruder, but soon a woman who appeared to be the child\u2019s parent said she was sorry and apologized before returning to the audience with the child in her arms.The competition seemingly came to a stop for a brief moment, but no one was angry, so Ryuichi also hoped that the woman wouldn\u2019t be too angry with the child.\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. Shizuna\u2026 Shizuna?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m okay.\u201dShizuna, who had been holding her ankle, slowly stood up. However, upon seeing her acting as if she was enduring some pain, Ryuichi instantly knew what had happened to her.\u201cDid you get a sprain?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dOf course, it didn\u2019t seem to have swollen yet, but it would still be a disaster if it got worse from Shizuna pushing herself to run. Therefore, Ryuichi untied the string that bound them together before Shizuna could even say anything.\u201cRyuichi-kun?!\u201d\u201cLeave it to me. Since all these people were watching, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll forgive me for this much.\u201dWith that, Ryuichi picked Shizuna up. She let out a small squeal and hugged his body, putting her arms around his neck.\u201cShe sprained her foot, so we\u2019re gonna continue like this! You fine with that, student council prez?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dThe president, who was serving as live commentator for the event, gave a thumbs-up.\u201cHang on tight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna nodded her head as her face flushed bright red. Ryuichi tried to run as lightly as possible so as not to put too much strain on Shizuna\u2019s body, but of course, doing so meant that he was overtaken by the slower runners. In the end, Ryuichi and Shizuna were the last to reach the goal.\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe moment they crossed the finish line, they were greeted by a great number of applauses.It was easy to imagine how they must\u2019ve been seen by them: a boy running with a girl in his arms in a princess carry to overcome an accident in front of a large crowd of people watching\u2026 When all was said and done, it was incredibly embarrassing.\u201c\u2026Well, for now we should head to the health committee guys.\u201dJust like that, they headed to where the health committee members were standing by. By the time they arrived, the area where she had sprained her leg was a little red, so it was decided that she would get first aid treatment in the form of a compress.If it had been any more serious, she would\u2019ve had to be taken to the hospital, so Ryuichi was relieved at the news. Sakie, who was standing next to him, was also relieved to hear that it didn\u2019t seem to be too serious.\u201cBut still, you were pretty cool back there, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah~.\u201dIn truth, he hadn\u2019t actually thought about carrying Shizuna princess-style. He knew he couldn\u2019t have her forcing herself, but the instant he saw her staring at the goal, trying to endure the pain, his body spontaneously leapt into action.\u201cI only pray that Shizuna-chan\u2019s leg heals without problems, but I certainly do have a longing to be treated like that someday too.\u201d\u201cTotally. Well, I\u2019d actually prefer fucking like rabbits than romantic novelties like that, though.\u201dChisa\u2019s words shocked the students on the health committee. From there, Ryuichi waited on Shizuna, and the sports festival came to an end after the rest of the events played out.In the end, Ryuichi\u2019s team won first place, and there was talk of having a party after the festival.\u201cWanna come with, Shishido?\u201d\u201cNah, I won\u2019t go. Sorry.\u201dRyuichi said this while looking at Shizuna\u2019s leg, and the male student who spoke to him readily relented and nodded in understanding. After he wished Shizuna a quick recovery, he asked her this question somewhat embarrassedly\u201cBy the way, Rindo-san.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDoes it really make you happy to have your boyfriend carry you like that?\u201d\u201cIt makes me really happy. I feel like I\u2019m falling more and more for Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Gah, strong men really are popular with the ladies, huh.\u201dNot really, that\u2019s just a special case, Ryuichi thought as he gave a wry smile.Chisa and Satsuki would be getting together at Shizuna\u2019s house again today, as they were going to have another evening party to celebrate Ryuichi and Shizuna\u2019s hard work at the sports festival. It seemed they would be coming after they did some preparations, so Ryuichi and Shizuna went home first in the car Sakie was driving.\u201cWait a sec.\u201dRyuichi was the first to get out of the car once they arrived home. He went around to Shizuna\u2019s side and took her hand, holding her up in his arms again.\u201cGeez, you really didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019m doing this because you, a wonderful girl, are now my girlfriend.\u201d\u201c\u2026It feels like I\u2019m getting more and more corrupted with every word you say.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re already corrupted, you know?\u201dSakie launched a direct attack at her with that calm retort.Even though it was only a sprained ankle, if it got worse, it would be painful for her to even move her leg. Therefore, it would be best for her to rest for today and pray that her injury didn\u2019t get any worse.\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll fawn on you more than usual today, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cPerfect. So, what do you want me to do?\u201dRyuichi replied as such to her as she sat on the sofa. When Shizuna heard him ask her what she wanted him to do, she gave him a heated look, and her eyes grew intoxicated for some reason.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIf you ask women what you want them to have you do from up there like that, you\u2019re going to make them tingle, you dummy.\u201d\u201c\u2026So it\u2019s my fault?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course it\u2019s your fault, since you, a wonderful man, have become my boyfriend now, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dThose words were like a kind of payback for what he had said earlier. Later, Chisa and Satsuki joined them as promised, and the evening turned into a lively one.This was Ryuichi\u2019s first time seriously participating in a sports festival, and it would remain etched in his memory forever with wonderful memories.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74That\u2019s Just a Small Worry, You Know?Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cPhew, all done with the\u00a0karaage.\u00a0How are things on your end, Satsuki?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done with the potato salad. Next is\u2014\u201dIt was on a certain night after the sports festival had come to a close. Chisa and Satsuki had come to Ryuichi\u2019s apartment to be with him today, and they were currently cooking in his room.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s been sleeping a lot these days?\u201d\u201cWell, he\u2019s still young and all.\u201d\u201cBut so are we.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Satsuki remarked with a laugh. The two girls stopped cooking and turned their attention to Ryuichi, who was sprawled out and sleeping comfortably. It was late in the evening when they came here, and Ryuichi seemed to have just gotten home from spending time with Shizuna after school, so he was out in a doze.\u201cHe\u2019s so big, strong, and manly, but when he\u2019s conked out like this, he makes a really cute sleeping face. It\u2019s like one of his many gap moes, huh?\u201d\u201cAgreed. I still remember how I couldn\u2019t help but think how cute he was when I first saw his sleeping face.\u201dAs Chisa said that, she recalled the memory of the first time she slept with him. As Satsuki just said, Ryuichi\u2019s body was very manly and strong, and as has been mentioned before, Chisa had felt very comfortable and grew addicted to having sex with him. Although Ryuichi had such a bewitching, ladykiller side to him, his sleeping face was very cute and appropriate for his age, and even that expression of his had captivated Chisa.\u201cHe must\u2019ve been, like, the king of some country in his previous life, no?\u201d\u201cOr maybe he was a famous hero?\u201d\u201cThey do say that great heroes have great appetites in bed, huh? He must\u2019ve had a hundred wives or something.\u201d\u201cObviously a hundred would be a bit\u00a0too\u00a0much, wouldn\u2019t it? Especially at night and stuff.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Ryuichi, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d handle them all deftly.\u201dThe two of them took the opportunity to speak as they pleased while Ryuichi was fast asleep. However, Satsuki suddenly looked at the sleeping Ryuichi and tilted her head. \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dUpon closer inspection, Ryuichi\u2019s expression, which had been pleasantly asleep earlier, looked somewhat pained now. Satsuki stopped cooking and immediately approached him to see what was wrong.\u201c\u2026Stop\u2026 It won\u2019t\u2026come out\u2026anymore\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat did he mean by \u201cIt won\u2019t come out anymore\u201d? He was sleep-talking almost as if he was having a nightmare; Satsuki, who couldn\u2019t bear to see him like that, shook his shoulders and called out to him.\u201cRyuichi-kun, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s eyes suddenly opened wide. He looked around in confusion, and when he saw Satsuki in front of him, he let out a sigh of relief\u2026 Then, he quietly muttered:\u201c\u2026Haaah, right. Of course it\u2019d be a dream.\u201d\u201cDid you have an unpleasant dream?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u00a0was\u00a0unpleasant, but if I had to say whether it was a good dream or not\u2026 Well, it probably wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d\u201c???\u201dHe was being awfully vague in his words.\u201cSo you were just having a bad dream? You made Satsuki worry since you were making a pained expression, you know?\u201d\u201cI see. Sorry \u2018bout that.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201dIf nothing had happened to him, then Satsuki was relieved. Chisa and Satsuki then resumed cooking, and delicious-looking dishes were soon lined up on the table. Satsuki was a good cook by nature, but Chisa had also taken the opportunity to learn a lot from Sakie.\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make a great bride, seriously.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll say that to anyone who makes you good food, huh.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only said it to Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYet you\u2019re saying it to me now\u2026\u201d\u201cFufu.\u201dChisa muttered that she would have loved to be the first he said those words to, but she still seemed very happy to be told by Ryuichi that she would make a good wife. Of course, since those words were directed not only at Chisa but also at Satsuki, Satsuki put her hand over her mouth and smiled.\u201cBy the way, what kind of dream did you have? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, that is.\u201dIt seemed the dream Ryuichi had had earlier was still on Satsuki\u2019s mind, so she asked Ryuichi about it. He hesitated for the briefest of moments, but eventually opened his mouth as he grabbed a piece of fried chicken with his chopsticks.\u201cI couldn\u2019t really move my body in my dream. All of you, Shizuna and Sakie included, were doing as you pleased with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cHooh.\u201dHearing this story, the meaning of the words he\u2019d muttered during his sleep\u2014\u201dIt won\u2019t come out anymore\u201d\u2014finally connected in Satsuki\u2019s mind. Chisa laughed amusedly, but Satsuki felt she had to make a proper correction, so she said in a strong tone:\u201cJust so you know, I wouldn\u2019t do it so much that you\u2019d exhaust yourself like that, okay?!\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s precisely because it\u2019s a dream that I got to enjoy a version of you that I won\u2019t see.\u201d\u201c\u2026That in itself irks me a little.\u201dRyuichi didn\u2019t particularly care about the fact that there happened to be Shizuna, Chisa, or Sakie. However, no matter how much of a dream it was, he would much rather enjoy the Satsuki who was here right now than the Satsuki who existed only in that dream.\u201cYou\u2019re so cute, Satsuki. Your love for Ryuichi has grown so much, so I\u2019m sure that must be why you\u2019re growing\u00a0there, too.\u201d\u201cThis and that are totally unrelated!\u201dSatsuki, who had the second largest bust aside from Sakie, was still growing her already admirable chest to even greater heights.\u201cThe growth makes my lingerie expenses so high\u2026 You get what I\u2019m saying too, right, Chisa-san?\u201d\u201cTotally.\u201d\u201cWell, they do say that women\u2019s underwear cost quite a fair bit.\u201d\u201cBesides, having them big is a huge hassle in and of itself,\u201d Satsuki said. Later, after dinner, Chisa headed to the bathroom to take a shower, while Ryuichi and Satsuki bonded as they washed the dishes together.\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see you washing the dishes like this, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cMaybe. But I always do at least this much when Shizuna comes over.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t back down, saying that this was the least he could do since they\u2019d cooked for him. It seemed as if the room got instantly quieter when Chisa was gone; the only sounds that could be heard now were their breathing and the sound of running water.\u2026I love this space we have right now.It wasn\u2019t anything special; Satsuki was just washing dishes side by side with the person she loved, yet she found great happiness in this ordinary act. Her time with Ryuichi, which had begun on the day she couldn\u2019t refuse her friend\u2019s forceful invitation\u2026was truly a blessing for her.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSatsuki took a peek at Ryuichi\u2019s face. He was cutely humming a tune while earnestly washing the dishes, and it was easy to tell that he was in a good mood. And, staring at his profile reminded her of a certain exchange.\u201cI\u2019ve already decided to go through with it. I\u2019m not going to let the happiness in my hands slip away, so brace yourself, Satsuki. I\u2019m not going to let you go either.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dRyuichi was worried about his current relationship with the girls too, but it was also Satsuki and the other girls who blew his worries away.If Ryuichi wanted it, Satsuki had considered the option of not meeting him for his and Shizuna\u2019s sake. And yet, Ryuichi\u2019s answer then had made Satsuki vow to stay by his side from now on.But, maybe we were the ones who, in a way, made him settle on that decision\u2026When she thought about it that way, she felt a little guilty. Of course, she knew that both Ryuichi and Shizuna had accepted their current relationship, but she still couldn\u2019t help but think about it at times.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t notice Ryuichi\u2019s voice, perhaps because she had been pondering by herself if she was really doing things right. It was all too late when she realized with a gasp that her face was being lifted up by a hand on her chin. She was forced to look up at Ryuichi, who was staring at her with his handsome face and piercing gaze.\u201cWhen you make a face like that, it\u2019s usually when you\u2019re worrying about something unimportant or trivial. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s.\u201dHe called it \u2018unimportant\u2019 and \u2018trivial\u2019, but perhaps he\u2019d called it that precisely because he saw that there was no need to think about it anymore. Ryuichi wasn\u2019t that insensitive a person; if anything, he was more sensitive to the moods of women, as she\u2019d come to know very well from spending time with him.\u201cWill your worries go away if I do this?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dShe was firmly embraced by him. She felt truly at ease from the bottom of her heart when she rested her cheek against Ryuichi\u2019s firm chest.\u201c\u2026Ah~, you\u2019re truly wonderful, Ryuichi-kun~.\u201dShe put her arms around Ryuichi\u2019s back as if to embrace him with all her might. It wasn\u2019t as if it sent her into a frenzy, but when she sniffed him, it was as if she was enveloped in a masculine scent.\u201cKiss me, please.\u201d\u201cYou got it.\u201dShe lifted her face, tiptoed a little taller, and their lips met each other\u2019s. As they repeated their kiss, which was no more than their lips touching, Satsuki felt her body gradually heat up, and she looked at Ryuichi with heated eyes, her heart racing with anticipation.\u201cSo this is what you two were up to while I was in the bath\u2026\u201d\u201cWha?!\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re back.\u201dWhen she heard Chisa\u2019s voice, Satsuki tried to move away, but Ryuichi, perhaps anticipating this, hugged her tightly, so she could not move away. Chisa was still wrapped in a bath towel and standing brazenly before them with a hair dryer in her hand.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head in the bath too, Satsuki?\u201d\u201cS-Sounds good to me!\u201dSatsuki headed for the bath at Chisa\u2019s urging. She felt lonely being away from Ryuichi\u2019s side, even if only temporarily in this case, but the slight worry in her heart had disappeared thanks to her kiss with him.\u201c\u2026I truly do love Ryuichi-kun, huh?\u201dShe muttered this with a smile and headed for the bathroom to take a shower.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75The Awakening of Shizuna\u2019s Sadistic SideTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrOn a certain day off, at a karaoke bar.\u201cSay, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dFor Shizuna, it was a question that was bound to come.\u201cYou see, it\u2019s about the girls who were with Shishido at the sports festival the other day\u2026\u201dShe, Yuuhi, was also one of Shizuna\u2019s friends, and at her remark, Shizuna could make out who those girls she was talking about were. It was probably\u2026no, it was almost certainly Chisa and Satsuki, but this was the first time she\u2019d been asked about their relationship that only she and the others knew about.\u201cSeriously?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Umm\u2026 Shizuna?\u201dPerhaps what she was trying to say was that Ryuichi might be cheating on her, but for Shizuna, she didn\u2019t feel the need to worry at all, so she smiled.\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. As you may have guessed from seeing us at the sports festival, those two are acquaintances of mine. They\u2019ve been good to me, and they\u2019re really important people to Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cSorry for bringing up weird suspicions.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Shizuna replied. That being said, there was a reason she couldn\u2019t tell them off strongly anyway, since if they didn\u2019t fully understand the entire situation, they might have easily had some misunderstandings.She was sure her friends weren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019d seen them; some of their other classmates and even some seniors and juniors had probably seen them as well, but nothing particularly troubling had happened since then.\u201cAre those two girls college students? It feels like they\u2019re a little older than us\u2026 Also, why are all the girls around Shishido such beautiful women? Shizuna, too.\u201d\u201cYes, they are college students. And I\u2019m not a beautiful\u2026no, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a beautiful girl, too.\u201d\u201cUwa, you actually admitted to it.\u201dYuuhi and the other girls were a little taken aback, but for Shizuna, the words she just uttered had meaning. It wasn\u2019t that she was a narcissist, but it was because of Ryuichi\u2019s words that she spoke about her good looks like this.\u201cYou see, Ryuichi-kun is always telling me how pretty and beautiful I am. So I decided to have confidence in myself because I have someone who says such things about me. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to say this to anyone and everyone, you know? I can only say this to all of you girls whom I trust.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shizunaa!\u201d\u201cGeez, you\u2019re seriously the cutest thing in the world!\u201d\u201cThat smile of yours is so charming, it\u2019d even make girls fall for you! I can\u2019t get enough of it!!\u201dShizuna was soon embraced from both sides. It was such a boisterous and noisy atmosphere that you could easily imagine Ryuichi, if he were there, smiling contentedly with a troubled look on his face at how rambunctious they were.\u201c\u2026I wish I could be you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201dAnother one of her friends, Murakami Saya, put her hand on her own breasts. The term \u2018mountain\u2019 couldn\u2019t be used to describe the size of it, which was to say, it was like a cutting board.\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty girl, and you\u2019ve even got the smarts to go with it, don\u2019t you? Besides, you\u2019re going out with someone as cool as Shishido, and more than anything\u2026 More than anything, you\u2019ve got huge boobs!\u201d\u201cEven if they\u2019re big, all they do is cause stiff shoulders.\u201d\u201cOnly a certain level of people can actually say that!!\u201dAlthough her appearance resembled that of a gyaru\u2019s, she was far from the naughty and sexy woman she aimed to be due to her lack of size in certain regions. She, Saya, excitedly reached her hand out toward Shizuna\u2019s big breasts. Shizuna accepted her hand without avoiding it, and Saya\u2019s fingers sank into her soft flesh.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s so soft and warm\u2026 I might get addicted to this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you should. The only person she\u2019d allow that for is Shishido.\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u00a0Shizuna giggled inwardly. As she stroked Saya\u2019s head, seemingly drooping in dejection after having taken a blow from reality, she decided to keep quiet about the fact that her breasts had recently gotten a little bigger again and she had changed her underwear for it.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you were an F cup, right?\u201d\u201cWell, somewhere around there.\u201dShe was actually a G cup, but she decided to keep quiet about that, too.\u201c\u2026Hey, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dYuuhi nervously called out to Shizuna. It was very cute to see the tomboyish-looking Yuuhi fidgeting like this, but it seemed that she had something she wanted to discuss with Shizuna.\u201cThe truth is\u2026 A friend of mine from my junior high school days confessed his feelings for me. The thing is, I\u2019m not sure if I want to go out with him or not.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHuh? Wait, I\u2019ve never heard of that before!\u201dShizuna and Saya were very intrigued by this big news. After that, Shizuna talked a lot about the happiness that came with having a boyfriend, but that only made the two girls exasperated at how Shizuna had instead gone on a rant about her love life with Ryuichi. Shizuna apologized, but to be honest, she was not satisfied and still wanted to tell them much more about Ryuichi.\u201cNever in a million years would I have guessed that\u00a0that\u00a0Shizuna would turn out like this.\u201d\u201cI agree. But Shishido is one lucky man too, being able to get his hands on a girlfriend as incredible as Shizuna.\u201dShizuna giggled when she heard their words. She giggled because everything they said was true, and vice versa, as Ryuichi loved Shizuna just as much as she loved him.\u201cWho has more stamina when you two have sex?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that!!\u201dNow that was definitely something Shizuna couldn\u2019t answer. Well, if Shizuna had to say, she was a masochistic woman and thus loved rough things, but recently, she had been willing to try out some of the techniques Ryuichi taught her, and she too had now gained some experience.\u201cRyuichi-kun\u2019s basically the one who has more stamina. Once he embraces you with those arms of his, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s lewd.\u201dShizuna thought it\u2019d be okay to tell them that much. However, because she\u2019d said those words while imagining her night with Ryuichi, Yuuhi and Saya blushed at the exquisitely sexy atmosphere Shizuna was letting off. After that, they continued their lively girls\u2019 talk before leaving the karaoke bar.\u201cWanna break up for the day?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think so. Is that okay with you, Shizuna?\u201d\u201cAlright. Well then, I\u2019ll see you\u2026 Oh?\u201dShizuna suddenly spotted a couple of familiar rear figures, and with a chuckle, she said goodbye to them and approached the figures.\u201cRyuichi-kun, Mom.\u201d\u201cHrm?\u201d\u201cOh my, Shizuna?\u201dThe two figures she\u2019d spotted were Ryuichi and Sakie. It seemed they were out shopping, as Ryuichi and Sakie were carrying shopping bags.\u201cI was also hanging out with Makoto and the others when I spotted Sakie shopping. So, you know, I couldn\u2019t just\u00a0not\u00a0help her after seeing her like that.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201cFufu, it made me really happy. And also, Ryuichi-kun, you did such a mischievous thing that it surprised me.\u201d\u201cA mischievous thing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dRyuichi turned away, telling her not to ask too much about it. The subtle blush on his cheeks told her that, putting aside its mischievous nature, it must\u2019ve been embarrassing as well, but even after giving it some thought, Shizuna couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201cHey, come on, Ryuichi-kun, tell me.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything important.\u201d\u201c\u2026Muuu.\u201dHe seemed stubbornly unwilling to tell her. Then Shizuna joined them to do some shopping, and when Ryuichi took a bathroom break, Sakie told her all about what he\u2019d done.\u201cYou see, he first called out to me, but then he covered my eyes.\u201d\u201cHe covered your eyes?\u201d\u201cYup. Then he asked me who it was, but I told Ryuichi-kun there was no way I\u2019d ever mishear his voice.\u201d\u201cTrue. Ah, so that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201cHe must\u2019ve been embarrassed by it.\u201dIt was certainly the kind of thing a child would do, so she couldn\u2019t really picture Ryuichi doing it. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d\u00a0Sakie prefaced before continuing.\u201cPerhaps if he\u2019d been close to his real mother, he would\u2019ve had that kind of exchange with her. It\u2019s seeing those cute little moments that make me want to be like a second mother to him.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dWas it because he\u2019d never been given love that he subconsciously seeked love from a mother? It wasn\u2019t that Ryuichi was still dwelling on his past; his actions simply meant that he had opened his heart to Sakie.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with you two?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cYup. It\u2019s nothing.\u201dRyuichi had only just gotten back from the restroom, but he seemed to have guessed what they had been talking about from their smiling faces.\u201c\u2026You told her, huh, Sakie?\u201d\u201cShould I not have?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThen isn\u2019t it fine?\u201d the two of them quipped as they laughed at Ryuichi. Looking at the shy Ryuichi, Shizuna\u2019s feelings of cuteness toward him mysteriously swelled up inside her. She wanted to see more of it; much, much more of it, she began to realize.\u2026Ah, is this what they call a sadistic side?It was at this moment that a new possibility was born within Shizuna.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76A New TeacherTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cI\u2019ll be studying here just like all of you starting today. I look forward to working with you.\u201dThe holidays were over and school had started as usual, but today\u2019s morning started a little differently than usual. Just as the morning assembly was about to begin, the homeroom teacher brought an unknown man into the classroom. Apparently he was a teacher in training called Shinjo, and he seemed to be very popular with the girls.\u201cExcuse me! Shinjo-sensei, are you married?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve always been lonely and single.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of girl is your type?\u201d\u201cThe kind ones, I guess\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think about me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to respectfully decline, because otherwise I\u2019d lose my job.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The whole classroom, including the homeroom teacher, was filled with laughter. If one went with the assumption that this world was originally the world of\u00a0those\u00a0types of mangas, handsome trainee teachers who appeared in schools like this were often the evil villains\u2026but even from Ryuichi\u2019s eyes, he seemed to be the serious, hard-working type.He seems like the type who gets pushed around by students but is still well-liked.Apparently, Shinjo wouldn\u2019t be involved with Ryuichi\u2019s class all the time; he would only be teaching as an intern during world history. After that, he told the class he\u2019d meet them again when he had time and left the classroom. After the morning assembly ended, the usual faces gathered by Ryuichi\u2019s side in the short amount of time they had before the first period started.\u201cPretty unusual to be getting a trainee teacher at this time of the year, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYeah. Pretty suspicious, huh?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s suspicious at all.\u201dShizuna inserted a retort at Kaname\u2019s words. While it certainly did seem odd considering the time of year, Ryuichi\u2019s gut feeling about Shinjo told him there wasn\u2019t anything too suspicious about it.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to worry about. Somehow, I get the feeling that he\u2019s less troublesome than Hamasaki.\u201d\u201cAh, well that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s definitely relieving.\u201d\u201cA relief, indeed.\u201dHamasaki detested Ryuichi, but apparently he wasn\u2019t very well-liked by Makoto, Kaname, or Shizuna either.Well, as far as Shizuna was concerned, Hamasaki\u2019s reputation was at an all-time low because of the incident between him and Ryuichi, and it didn\u2019t help that his actions were based on own self-imposed sense of justice, either.\u201cBut he was pretty handsome, huh? What did you think of him, Rindo?\u201dWhen Kaname asked Shizuna this question, she opened her mouth blankly.\u201cWhat did I think of him? \u2026Hmm?\u201dShe seemed to have no interest in Shinjo at all. It wasn\u2019t a surprising reaction since she had a boyfriend, namely Ryuichi, but in Shizuna\u2019s case, it seemed that she wasn\u2019t even interested in him as a person before she was interested in him as a member of the opposite sex.\u201cMan, when it comes to men other than Ryuichi\u2026it really feels like she thinks of them like mere pebbles on the side of the road.\u201d\u201cI get you. Well, she does talk to you and me\u2026 Oh, and Sohei too.\u201d\u201cDid you call?\u201dSohei, who happened to be nearby, joined the conversation. He, whom Kaname now referred to by his given name, had been talking to Makoto, Kaname, and the others more and more since their meeting at the nightclub. Sohei hadn\u2019t explicitly stated that he was aiming for Mihara, but they could all tell that he had faint feelings for her, so they were rooting for him.\u201c\u2026Hmm, I guess I really am just not interested. If they talk to me, I\u2019ll respond, but that\u2019s about it.\u201dWhilst the boys were noisily conversing with each other, Shizuna leaned in close to Ryuichi and spoke those words.\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than just cutting them off entirely. It\u2019d be one thing if they had bad intentions, but if it\u2019s neither, then your response is all the more appropriate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And besides, there are some people like the manager who seem scary at first glance, but actually have a cute gap between their outer and inner selves.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dRyuichi and Shizuna laughed together.\u201cI\u2019ve also come to know many kinds of adults through you, Ryuichi-kun, so I\u2019ve even wondered if, under those sweet features of his, he\u2019s a pervert who thinks about eating up girls.\u201d\u201cHeh, looks like I\u2019ve been a pretty bad influence on you, huh?\u201dThat Shizuna had now become wary of such men was also a byproduct of her relationship with Ryuichi, even though Ryuichi was originally the one who should\u2019ve been in that position. From Shinjo\u2019s point of view, it was a terrible misfortune, but from Ryuichi\u2019s point of view, Shizuna\u2019s wariness allowed him relief and peace of mind.\u201cOh, and by the way, Sohei-kun\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to Mihara-san, it\u2019s not nice to glance at her chest. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s aware of that, too.\u201d\u201cUrk?!\u201dSohei jumped in shock, and Kaname put his arms around his shoulders to support him.\u201cHey, come on now, Rindo, when there\u2019s breasts before your eyes it\u2019s only natural for your gaze to drift there, don\u2019t you think? Besides, almost all of the women who work at the club have good figures and fully-visible cleavages. You can\u2019t tell a guy our age\u00a0not\u00a0to look at them.\u201d\u201cK-Kaname-kun!\u201d\u201cYou two have really gotten close, huh?\u201dIt was just\u2026 Although it had been conveyed to Ryuichi by Shizuna, apparently Sohei was now on very bad terms with his mother. The cause of it need not be said, but it seemed his mother somehow found out about Mihara.\u201cAre things all right for you? I\u2019ve heard some stuff about the situation you\u2019ve gotten yourself into.\u201dWhen he asked Sohei about it, he laughed with a troubled look, but strongly suggested that he not worry about him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Well, I do get where my mom is coming from, but\u2026 I couldn\u2019t forgive her for calling Mihara-san a vulgar, nightlife woman. I thought it was wrong of her to just reject Mihara-san out of hand without knowing the full story.\u201dAlthough Ryuichi himself had no idea what kind of conversation they had had, he understood that Sohei had opposed her because of his feelings for Mihara\u2026 That was just how much he cared about Mihara.\u201cIf you need anything, just talk to me, okay? I can help you, and so can Makoto and Kaname if you need them.\u201d\u201cOf course, you can consult me too, okay, Sohei-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. Thanks.\u201dAfter that, the teacher for first period arrived, and they broke up and returned to their seats. Time passed, and eventually it came time for their lunch break.\u201cI\u2019mma head to the toilet.\u201d\u201cAlright, see you later.\u201dRyuichi called out to Shizuna, then left his seat and headed for the restroom. When he came out of the restroom feeling refreshed, he just so happened to stumble upon Shinjo walking down the hallway with his teaching materials.\u201cHi there. Haven\u2019t seen each other since the morning assembly, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2018Sup, teach.\u201dWhen Ryuichi answered him, Shinjo\u2019s eyes widened in amazement before he shook his shoulders in laughter.\u201cHaha, I see now. You\u2019re just as Hamasaki-sensei told me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah~.\u201dWith that, Ryuichi could more or less understand the meaning of what he had just said.So he\u2019s been talking about me this much, huh.Recently, he had tried to approach Shizuna and Sakie but his attempts ended in failure every time. Ryuichi thought Hamasaki had given up on him as well, but it seemed that he was still saying things about him behind his back. Well, Ryuichi had blended in quite well in class though, so Hamasaki now seemed to be disliked by the students who had a general understanding of the situation\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you. The impressions Hamasaki-sensei and Someya-sensei have of you is quite different, but, well, I\u2019m not very well liked by Hamasaki-sensei, either.\u201d\u201cHrm?\u201dThere was still plenty of time left for lunch break, so Ryuichi decided to talk with Shinjo.\u201cHamasaki-sensei told me a lot about you, but I don\u2019t intend to say anything about that because I\u2019m basically a delinquent myself. In fact, I used to be unruly and violent back in my high school days too, to the point where I even wonder why I decided to become a teacher in the first place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Seriously?\u201dHe mentioned how he had been an unruly kid in high school, despite the fact that his appearance would lead one to believe that he had been an honor student in school.\u201cWhen I tell people this story, they usually say I\u2019m lying, but I\u2019m not really sure if that should make me happy or not. Well, because of that, when I heard your story, I thought you were just like me when I was young.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dWas it that Shinjo held no prejudice against Ryuichi because Ryuichi resembled his former self? In any case, if he was going to be spending time as a teacher in training from now on, there would probably be more chances for Ryuichi to meet him like this. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d do if he had to deal with another person nitpicking on his every fault like Hamasaki did every time, so it was good to know that Shinjo had accepted him like this.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty considerate, or should I say, you really care about your students, huh?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. If I\u2019m going to become a teacher here, I wouldn\u2019t want to do something that would make my students hate me, would I?\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d\u201cAnd if not that, I think it\u2019s always good to have a friendly relationship with your students.\u201dApparently, he seemed like a very reasonable, down-to-earth man. Then, after a little more talking, they exchanged words of encouragement for each other and parted ways.\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201dThis time, his eyes met Hamasaki\u2019s, who was currently walking down the hallway to his next class. Hamasaki no longer got involved with Ryuichi\u2014he only glared at him, but it still made him uncomfortable.\u201cAh, if it isn\u2019t Shishido-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201dBy chance, he also happened upon Someya who was walking down the hallway with her teaching materials in hand. Someya also noticed Hamasaki and let out a troubled sigh.\u201c\u2026I wonder why he\u2019s so reluctant to trust his student.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s normal, considering what I used to be.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s what you\u00a0used\u00a0to be, right? I think it\u2019s important for him to look at your present self\u2026\u201dRyuichi realized once again that he was really starting to be viewed differently, not only by the students but also by the teachers.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77She Likes the Present Ryuichi, and He Likes the Present ShizunaTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201cHoh, so you\u2019ve got a new teacher, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt was a few days after Shinjo arrived at their school as a trainee teacher. Ryuichi had come to the club, and Shizuna and Chisa were sitting next to him while the ever so stern-faced manager was wiping a cup, seemingly watching over the three of them.\u201cFrom a teacher\u2019s point of view, delinquents are dangerous because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do, and it\u2019s very possible for their career to be damaged because of one. Well, from my point of view, you just seem cute, Ryuichi, but in that sense, that teacher is a pretty good fellow, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cYeah. I totally didn\u2019t expect him to say that about me, either.\u201dIt would be one thing if it had been Someya, who had now revised her view on Ryuichi since she\u2019d gotten to know him, but it was surprising that Shinjo, who had just met Ryuichi and didn\u2019t know much about him, would say such a thing to him. He didn\u2019t know if it was true or not, but apparently he used to be a bit of a delinquent himself, and that was one of the reasons why he accepted Ryuichi.\u201cWell, I appreciate it, but I don\u2019t really care that much. I\u2019ll take anything as long as I can have a peaceful school life.\u201d\u201c\u2026Fufu.\u201d\u201cWow, who knew Ryuichi could say something like that?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything that weird, y\u2019know\u2026\u201dRyuichi\u2019s lips pouted as he thought about how a peaceful school life was what any student would want. Shizuna and Chisa thought Ryuichi\u2019s sulking was cute, and Shizuna patted him on the shoulder to cheer him up, while Chisa teasingly poked him on his cheeks.\u201cThat\u2019s just how much the girls love you. If Satsuki and Sakie were here, they would have poked fun at you the same way, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d\u201c\u2026I feel like I\u2019ve been getting weaker these days.\u201dWhen Ryuichi muttered this, everyone burst out laughing again. Ryuichi\u2019s weakened state was not meant in the physical sense, but in the sense that he wasn\u2019t able to push the girls away because their love for him was too warm. Of course, Ryuichi had no intention of leaving them, but he was afraid that he would lose himself when this warmth overflowed and spilled out of his palm.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ryuichi-kun, you don\u2019t have to worry about a thing.\u201d\u201cRight, right, what Shizuna-chan said.\u201dAlthough he hadn\u2019t said it out loud, the two people by his side noticed the subtleties of his heart as if it were a matter of course. Chisa was still drinking her sake as vigorously as ever, but Shizuna was showing that she was there for him by putting her shoulder up against his without a care in the world.\u2026They\u2019re really such good women.Afterwards, he finished his meal while the two ladies and the manager made fun of him, then went outside. Chisa said she would go home after a few more drinks, so Ryuichi and Shizuna left the club ahead of her.\u201cWhen the sports festival ends, so too does summer\u2026 Well, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s happening, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. Looks like we\u2019ve still got some hot days ahead of us.\u201dDespite the hustle and bustle inside the club, it had been much cooler there thanks to the air conditioning, but once they stepped outside, they were hit by a lukewarm breeze. The nights were still hot and sleep would remain difficult, so it was important to drink water as soon as one felt thirsty.\u201cYou look like you\u2019d be feeling cool in those, but is it still hot?\u201d\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s more warm than hot?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRyuichi was currently dressed in short sleeves and short pants, which should\u2019ve been very light and cool, but despite this, the temperature was still warm enough for it to be noticeable.Ryuichi and Shizuna were attracting many eyes, and Shizuna had noticed that among them were not only those who were gazing upon her as a beautiful girl, but also women who were attracted to Ryuichi\u2019s muscles, his defining trait which clearly displayed his strength as a man.\u201cIt\u2019s a little hot, but can we link arms?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dEven though it was hot, it was nighttime, and as mentioned before, a lukewarm breeze was blowing, so he didn\u2019t feel that hot even as Shizuna happily hugged his arm.\u201cFufufu~. \u266a\u201d\u201cPretty chipper, aren\u2019tcha?\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s always a joy to be together with my beloved boyfriend.\u201dShizuna\u2019s smile made Ryuichi smile as well. Truthfully speaking, Ryuichi had noticed that Shizuna was concerned about the way people were looking at him, so he\u2019d made this suggestion as a way to reassure her. Nevertheless, at the same time that Ryuichi caught the eyes of their surroundings, so too did Shizuna.There\u2019s no way I can ever let her walk the city streets alone at night like this, huh.He glanced at Shizuna, who was happily embracing his arm. She was dressed in a shoulder-length one-piece dress that looked nice and cool. It showed a lot of skin and was a change from her usual toned-down and mature look, but honestly, he felt that Shizuna looked good no matter what she was wearing.\u201cShizuna, don\u2019t dress too skimpily when you\u2019re alone, okay?\u201d\u201cAh, are you worried for me?\u201d\u201cObviously.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201dOf course, Ryuichi knew Shizuna very well, so he didn\u2019t intend to be too harsh on her. Besides, Shizuna herself did not want to cause any worry for Ryuichi in the first place, and was even careful about anything she did that may lead to misunderstandings, so she was a very wary and cautious person.\u201cYou don\u2019t have anywhere you want to stop by, right?\u201d\u201cNope. Let\u2019s just go home.\u201dSince neither of them had anything else to do, they decided to go straight home. On their way to take Shizuna to her home, she said that she wanted to stay with him a little longer, so they sat on a bench lit by a streetlight. There was an ice cream vendor nearby, so Ryuichi bought a chocolate-flavored and a mint-flavored ice cream for him and Shizuna, respectively.\u201cHere.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter handing the mint ice cream to Shizuna, Ryuichi started eating his chocolate one. The ice cream was a little stinging and cold, but it was still delicious to eat in summer, and Ryuichi happily devoured his ice cream.\u201cThis is delicious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cFor sure.\u201dShizuna, though not as vigorously as Ryuichi, enjoyed the taste of her ice cream as well and finished it completely. They then stayed on the bench for a while and made some casual talk, but then Shizuna suddenly stopped talking.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, well\u2026 Can I talk about something weird for a moment, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cSomething weird?\u201dShizuna nodded. She then continued, not with a serious air, but with a casual tone as if she was making some small talk.\u201cLately, I\u2019ve been having these mysterious dreams. These dreams seemingly take place in a world different from this one\u2026 I was dating you in that world too, and the you of that world looked just like the you standing here\u2026 It\u2019s just, it felt like you had a frivolous and superficial air about you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d\u201cAnd the me that was with you also had\u2026a gyaru-esque feel to her, I guess? I know I tried dressing up as a gyaru that one time, but this was even more intense than that, and she even wore her school uniform in a way that showed off her cleavage. She was basically like a flamboyant, promiscuous woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hrm.\u201dIt was certainly mysterious, but for Ryuichi, it was also something he could not help but listen to intently.Could the dream she saw have been\u2026A frivolous-looking Ryuichi, and an extremely gyaru-like Shizuna. There was only one answer that could be derived from these two descriptions\u2014it was the route that this world was originally supposed to follow. However, as he\u2019d thought many times by now, the route of this world had already deviated and was now traveling down its own path. Ryuichi was living as Ryuichi, and Shizuna was living as Shizuna with a proper sense of self-being, which had led to the happy world they were experiencing today.\u201cSo, what did you think about that dream Shizuna?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dShizuna thought for a moment, then looked at Ryuichi and replied:\u201cThe two of us now are different from the ones I saw in that dream. In fact, it would be no exaggeration to say that we and them are like two completely different sets of people. But we did have one thing in common.\u201d\u201cOne thing in common?\u201dShizuna nodded and slowly brought her face close to Ryuichi\u2019s cheek and kissed him. She smiled happily and continued her words.\u201cNo matter the form it took,\u00a0we truly loved each other. The me in that world lived for your sake, too, and\u2026I think I was really happy to be by your side.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna\u2019s dream was not necessarily how Ryuichi had imagined it. If it was as Ryuichi had imagined it, then it would\u2019ve undoubtedly been a bad ending, a tragic outcome that would\u2019ve made anyone who disliked the\u00a0cuckolding\u00a0genre want to cover their eyes.Even Ryuichi as he was now would not accept the idea of a Shizuna with all her common sense and ethics destroyed, and that was largely because the current Shizuna was just so wonderful that he couldn\u2019t fathom the thought of having any other version of her but the one in front of him.\u2026I see. So if you completely disregard all the grief from their surroundings, Ryuichi and Shizuna were happy together even in that world.However, Ryuichi still did not want such a world .As if in return for the kiss she had just given him, Ryuichi put his hand behind Shizuna\u2019s head and, holding it in place so that she could not escape, stole her lips.It was not a simple kiss on the cheek, but a very intense one, seemingly trying to take her entire being. After kissing for a while, Ryuichi finally pulled his face away and opened his mouth.\u201cSure, maybe there was a world like that one, but I definitely prefer the one I\u2019m in now. I prefer this world where you are by my side as you are now, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I feel the same way, too. I love the wonderful Ryuichi-kun before me the most. \u266a\u201dThey then laughed together.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78What Should I Give as a Gift?Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Genghis Khan!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dIn the morning, Ryuichi woke up with this inexplicable shout. He sat up, looked around, and muttered with a stunned expression on his face.\u201c\u2026Why the hell did I shout \u2018Genghis Khan?\u2019\u201dHe tilted his head in confusion as he muttered this question to himself. He didn\u2019t know if he had been dreaming about something strange or if he had been asking for something, but he strongly remembered shouting that in his own voice very loudly.\u201c\u2026Guess I\u2019ll just get ready.\u201dIn spite of the strange mood he\u2019d gotten himself in first thing in the morning, Ryuichi got up and started getting ready. It was the middle of September, and while the hot weather would continue for a little while longer, things would turn cooler if they managed to hold out a little longer\u2026 and then, a cold winter would await them afterward.\u201cMan, that totally sucks.\u201dRyuichi was a little depressed now, as he did not like either the hot or the cold.\u201cAlso, the cultural festival\u2019s comin\u2019 up soon.\u201dThe cultural festival was an event that came right after the sports festival. Each class in every grade prepared a variety of performances for this annual big event, and of course, Ryuichi intended to actively participate in the cultural festival as well following the sports festival.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re doing a maid and butler cafe this year? Definitely better than the haunted house and cafe thing we did last year.\u201dOf course, Ryuichi did not participate in last year\u2019s cultural festival, but when he was a first year, his class put on an exhibit that made no sense at all: a hybrid between a cafe and a haunted house.It had been surprisingly well received though, and Ryuichi was secretly hoping that other classes would come up with some outlandish events this year as well.A few moments later, Ryuichi met up with Shizuna.\u201c\u2026Oh, right.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dActually, Ryuichi had occurred upon a thought related to Shizuna. Namely, about how he\u2019d been whining to her and the other girls a\u00a0little\u00a0bit more often these days.\u201cI was just thinking how it feels like I\u2019ve been saying lots of things that make you worry for me lately.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, though?\u201d\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that.\u201dHe chuckled and placed his hand on her head. He stroked it a little roughly and then gently combed it to fix her messy hair.\u201cI think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been spoiled by all the time I spent with you and the other girls. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that, and well\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be stopping anytime soon.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d\u201cBut, I think I ought to fire myself up a bit more.\u201dAnd with that, he slapped his cheeks with both his hands. It seemed he\u2019d used a little too much force though, as his cheeks turned red, but that pain too would serve to boost Ryuichi\u2019s new resolve.\u201c\u2026You know, you\u2019re kind of like a tiger who\u2019s had its fangs removed, and I think that\u2019s adorable.\u201d\u201cThe heck is up with that fancy simile\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it, stop it,\u201d Ryuichi said as he shook his head. Shizuna giggled at this and muttered, \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying, though,\u201d in a truly regrettable voice.\u201cI love a strong and aggressive Ryuichi-kun, and I really like it when you force yourself on me, but I also love it when you show your weak side, and I love your cute parts, too. So, please show me your weak side regularly, okay?\u201d\u201cIf I feel like it,\u201d came Ryuichi\u2019s reply.\u2026Actually, Shizuna aside, all the other girls are older than me. Geez, I really have to be careful or else I\u2019m gonna get spoiled to death.Although his life as it was now had a certain charm to it, Ryuichi still wanted to be strong. He encouraged himself to never lose heart, never let his feelings get down, and to always be strong and dignified no matter what happened.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201d\u201cMy, how diligent.\u201dWhen they arrived at school, the first thing they noticed was the student council doing a greeting campaign. Among them was Shinjo, who had been assigned to the school as a trainee teacher, and was apparently trying to engage with the students in a variety of lively ways.\u201cG-Good morning, Shishido-kun, Rindo-san!\u201d\u201cYo.\u201d\u201cGood morning.\u201dAfter exchanging greetings, Shizuna and Ryuichi entered the school building. As mentioned earlier, the school festival was coming up soon, so school hours were now being used for each class to plan their exhibit. It was a dynamic unique to this time of the year.\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing a butler and maid cafe for the festival. Is everyone fine with that?\u201d\u201cYep~.\u201d\u201cToo lazy to think of anything else, anyways.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be able to see the girls in maid uniforms, so I\u2019m all for it!!\u201d\u201cThe boys in butler uniforms, huh\u2026 Meh.\u201d\u201cWhy?! Isn\u2019t this where you\u2019re supposed to say you\u2019re interested?!\u201d\u201cYou should look at your own face before you say that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo mean.\u201dAmidst all the giggling and laughter, Ryuichi was still alone with his thoughts. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing that the class was getting rowdy in a good way like this; even Ryuichi chuckled at the way things were progressing. Even though it was too late for it now, the thought occurred to him once more about how dumb he had been in the past for not participating in this since he\u2019d seen it as something useless.\u201cEven those two look eager.\u201dMakoto and Kaname seemed enthusiastic as well and were even actively participating in the discussions. Ryuichi had also been a driving factor behind their change, but unfortunately, Ryuichi wasn\u2019t aware of that at all.The class had already reached a decision on the important matters, so all that was left was to relax and get ready for the big day.\u201cMan, that discussion went really smoothly.\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, I don\u2019t know how it was last year, though.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, right. You didn\u2019t participate last year, huh, Shishido.\u201dIt was now lunchtime and Ryuichi was on his way back from the restroom with Sohei, both having already finished their lunch. Ryuichi could tell from what he just said that he also knew about last year\u2019s Ryuichi, and he gave a wry smile.\u201cOh, and speaking of which, it\u2019s almost time, huh?\u201d\u201cTime for what?\u201d\u201cShizuna\u2019s birthday.\u201d\u201c\u2026Heh?\u201dRyuichi\u2019s mouth dropped open. In all honesty, he had never paid any attention to Shizuna\u2019s birthday. In fact, he had not been aware of it at all, to the point where he wondered to himself why he had never asked her about it until now. That said, however, he did remember from the manga that her birthday was on October 10.How am I so retarded, remembering her birthday at this point in time\u2026Well, in a way, it wasn\u2019t surprising, because he\u2019d never celebrated nor had his own birthday celebrated before. At best, Chisa would take him out somewhere when his birthday came.\u2026I see. So that was Chisa\u2019s way of being considerate to me.Ryuichi was reminded once more that she really cared about him from the moment they met. Now, Ryuichi had to make a lot of preparations.\u201cShishido? You look like you\u2019re seriously worrying about something; what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I was thinking about what I should give to Shizuna as a present.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d\u201cThis is a really serious problem, you know,\u201d he said before sinking into thought. He was sure that she would probably be happy with whatever he gave her, and as long as he didn\u2019t give her anything strange, she would be fine with it. Nevertheless, he\u00a0did\u00a0want to show off a little bit, and he wanted to give her something that she would be truly happy with.\u201cWell, think long and hard about it, Shishido.\u201d\u201c\u2026That kind of pisses me off. But yeah, I understand.\u201dFortunately, thanks to his part-time job, he had a good amount of money at his disposal, so Ryuichi nodded his head and said he would take his time to think about it since he still had another month until her birthday. However, Shizuna\u2019s birthday aside, he also wanted to give something to the other girls as a gift to thank them for always supporting him.\u201cYou\u2019re making a nice face right now, Shishido.\u201d\u201cHmm? I\u2019ve always got a nice face, y\u2019know?\u201dRyuichi laughed, and Sohei gave a laugh as well.When Ryuichi returned to the classroom with Sohei, he found Shizuna sitting in his seat.\u201cOh, you\u2019re back, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dRyuichi sat down as if to take Shizuna\u2019s place, who stood up now that Ryuichi had arrived. Just as she tried to borrow a chair from the adjacent desk, he grabbed hold of her arm.\u201cCome here.\u201dThat was all he said before he pulled her body toward him. He hugged her, who settled nicely in his lap, and buried his face in her hair.\u201c\u2026You smell nice.\u201d\u201cRyuichi-kun, we\u2019re still in the classroom\u2026\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll be staying here for a while.\u201d\u201cFufu, you\u2019re being so aggressive. \u266a\u201dFor the time being, Shizuna let Ryuichi do as he pleased to her. While Ryuichi was enjoying Shizuna\u2019s touch with his whole body like this, an idea for a gift he could give her came to mind.\u2026Yeah, I think this should be good. It might be a little too early for it, though.Something a little early to give right now\u2014That was the kind of gift Ryuichi had in mind.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79I, Shizuna, Am Right Behind You\u2014Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dAfter school, Ryuichi was alone at a certain store. He was the only one around, and even his girlfriend, Shizuna, was not there.\u201cSir\u2026?\u201d\u201cHah?\u201d\u201cHiih?!\u201dPerhaps he\u2019d been pondering things too seriously, but he turned his attention to the woman working at the store with a sharp gaze. The look on his face was ferocious and murderous\u2026 Well, to say that would be an overstatement, but as a person working in this beautiful store, the woman probably had a delicate and fragile heart as well.Man, the people who work at stores like these are all so neat and tidy.All the other store clerks were also dressed in suits, and their hair and makeup were neatly done. In a sense, this was a store that dealt in luxury goods, so the idea was probably to focus first and foremost on the appearance of the store to make sure that customers who came to the store actually bought their products.\u201cSorry, I just naturally look like this, so it causes a bunch of misunderstandings.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s okay.\u201dAs has been mentioned many times before, Ryuichi had no intention to scare other people. It was normal for his gaze to sharpen whenever he thought about something, making the people around him think he was in a bad mood. Of course, this didn\u2019t apply to Shizuna and the other girls, and recently, the reactions of his classmates had changed too, but for those who did not normally interact with him, it was only natural that they would still see him this way.\u201cI\u2019m actually a high school student, just so you know.\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re a high school student?!\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dHer reaction suggested that she didn\u2019t think he looked like a high school student at all. The woman gazed at Ryuichi from head to toe in surprise, and then immediately apologized.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. So, do you mind if I explain things?\u201d\u201cSure. Go ahead.\u201dRyuichi began to tell her about his situation. What he had come to buy without any of the girls around was a birthday present for Shizuna. He had thought about what would be good for her, and after much consideration, he decided on a ring, even though he could not deny that it was a little over the top.\u201cSo\u2026 I\u00a0am\u00a0thinking of buying her another one once we\u2019re older, but I want to give her a gift to thank her for everything she\u2019s done for me until now and in the future.\u201dA ring, also called an engagement ring, was an important and significant item used to pledge a couple\u2019s future with each other. When Ryuichi thought about what he should get Shizuna for her birthday, this was what he came up with. As a high school student, he was limited in what he could afford, but he still intended to buy something reasonable since his part-time job paid quite a lot.\u201cThat sounds wonderful. Fufu, I understand now! Come, let us have a look together!\u201dHearing Ryuichi\u2019s situation, the clerk mysteriously broke out into a grin, and she seemed very eager to help him choose a ring.\u201cI wish I\u2019d met a man who thought of me that way during my high school days too. I think your girlfriend is really lucky.\u201dIf asked whether Shizuna was happy or not, Ryuichi could say with confidence that she was. There were many factors behind it, but he understood that he himself was the biggest one. This was by no means Ryuichi being self-conceited; it was only natural for him to think this way as her boyfriend.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say that, but\u00a0she\u00a0was the one who made me this way. So I\u2019m definitely the luckier one.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dRyuichi nodded his head, sincerely emphasizing his point. Of course, he wanted Shizuna to be happy, but he thought that if he wanted his precious girlfriend to be happy, he himself had to be happy first. As he thought of Shizuna, he put on a wonderful smile without even realizing it himself.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s nothing!\u201dThe woman had been staring at Ryuichi\u2019s face in a daze, but she quickly averted her eyes in a panic. Later, with the woman\u2019s help, he managed to decide on a ring for Shizuna, and he left the store with a bright look on his face.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dOn the way home, he looked at his phone and saw that he had received a call from Shizuna, with a message asking how his outing alone had gone. As a matter of fact, Shizuna had expected to be together with Ryuichi again today, so when he told her he would be going out alone, she was shocked. Well, her actual reaction hadn\u2019t been that dramatic, but he could still tell she\u2019d been disappointed, so he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at her.Geez, what\u2019s gonna happen to this girl if I leave her? Well, not that I ever intend to in the first place.Shizuna\u2026no, it wasn\u2019t just her. Ryuichi fully intended to cherish the present in order to not cause grief and worry to those around him, including Shizuna.\u201c\u2026No, not just the present, but the future, too.\u201dAnd with that mutter, Ryuichi headed back to his apartment. As soon as he got home, he put the ring he had bought on his desk and took a box out of his closet to make sure he did not lose it.\u201cAlright, this should be good.\u201dRyuichi nodded to himself, seeing as the ring would be safe inside the box now. It was too early to be giving Shizuna the ring since her birthday was still almost a month away, and if anything, it was way too early for a high school student to be giving a ring in the first place, but he didn\u2019t care.\u201cTime to get the bath ready.\u201dJust as he was about to head to the bath to fill the tub with hot water, the intercom rang.\u00a0Ding dong!\u201c\u2026Who could it be?\u201dBasically, the only people who ever came to his apartment were women, Shizuna included, so he wondered if perhaps Chisa had come to visit. As he was about to head for the front door, his phone vibrated with seemingly perfect timing.\u201cShizuna, huh? What\u2019s up?\u201dIt turned out Shizuna was the one who had called him.\u201cHi, it\u2019s me, Shizuna. I\u2019m in front of your door right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dRyuichi immediately opened the door without even having to say the popular phrase, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d On the other side of the door was Shizuna, who had a shopping bag in her hand. With her phone held to her ear, she let out a giggle, and Ryuichi chuckled as he invited her in.\u201cDid you miss me that much?\u201d\u201cYes, I did. But even I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be\u00a0this\u00a0lonely.\u201dNo matter how much she missed him, though, he felt dismayed that she\u2019d come all the way to his place alone after dark without telling him. Nevertheless, what came after his dismay was the feeling that she\u2019d been a little too reckless.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll take your scolding, Ryuichi-kun. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it\u2019s okay.\u201dIf nothing happened, then it\u2019s okay. All\u2019s well that ends well,\u00a0Ryuichi thought. He too had become a little soft on her. And so, with Shizuna\u2019s arrival, it was hurriedly decided that she would cook dinner for them.\u201cOh, right. Shizuna.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI can actually make some simple stir-fried veggies now. Next time, I want to try making some fried fish.\u201dAs a matter of fact, Ryuichi was getting better at cooking little by little. Still, when compared to the average person, he was still sorely lacking\u2026 When Ryuichi mentioned this progress to Shizuna, her cheeks puffed out in a somewhat displeased manner.\u201c\u2026You didn\u2019t have to though. I\u2019ll always be here to cook for you.\u201d\u201cHeh, that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna ruin me one of these days.\u201dWell, it wasn\u2019t like she had meant her words seriously either, and she asked him to cook next time so she could see what his cooking tasted like. Ryuichi nodded, clenching his fist at this perfect opportunity to show off the culinary skills he had developed to her.\u201cAight, I\u2019mma take a bath first.\u201d\u201cAlright. See you.\u201dDespite the suddenness of her visit, he was glad Shizuna came to see him. Ryuichi headed for the bath with a smile on his face, then his expression turned grim when he returned.\u201cWha?!\u201d\u201cAh, Ryuichi-kun. What\u2019s this?\u201dShe was pointing to a box on the table. It was the very same box that held the ring for Shizuna\u2019s birthday. Shizuna\u2019s visit had caused Ryuichi to completely forget that he\u2019d left it on the table just like that. It seemed he\u2019d gotten lucky that she hadn\u2019t seen what was inside, but Ryuichi slowly approached her and spoke.\u201cShizuna, give me that.\u201d\u201c\u2026This feels very fishy.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s expression turned strangely grim as he asked for it back, when he should have acted like it was nothing. Shizuna\u2019s suspicion was understandable, but in a good way, she was very perceptive and obediently gave it back to him.\u201cCould it be that there\u2019re porn books or DVDs inside?\u201d\u201cHell no. There\u2019s no need for me to rely on stuff like that when I have a girlfriend like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dShizuna\u2019s cheeks flushed red at Ryuichi\u2019s sincere words. Ryuichi was relieved that he had managed to retrieve the box and stored it securely, stealing a glance at Shizuna as she returned to cooking, embarrassed all the while.\u201c\u2026But man, I can\u2019t wait.\u201dBuying a gift like this also made him eagerly look forward to that day. Ryuichi smiled as he imagined the coming date, watching Shizuna\u2019s back who was cooking while humming a nice tune.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Shizuna\u2019s Not Very Worrying ConcernTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrThe cultural festival was just a few days away. Ryuichi and Shizuna were actively participating and sharing their opinions about the class\u2019 exhibit, namely the butler and maid cafe, along with its setup and operation.It seemed that the whole class working together on a single event had inspired the other classes as well, and it was clear that the whole school was trying to make the coming festival a good one.\u201c\u2026Muu.\u201dIn the meantime, Shizuna, who was leading a fulfilling life both in school and in her personal life, was pondering something in her living room at home. She was intently staring at the TV while thinking about Ryuichi and the box that he had been desperate to get back.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen Ryuichi-kun so desperate to get something back like that. He clearly didn\u2019t want me to see what was inside.\u201dRyuichi was usually very open and upfront a person, something she\u2019d learnt from having dated him until now, but she had never seen him hide something to that extent. It didn\u2019t seem like he was hiding anything serious, but it really made her a little concerned about his behavior.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYou see\u2026\u201dShizuna proceeded to explain her thoughts to Sakie.\u201cHmm, so Ryuichi-kun did that, huh.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m definitely reading too much into this. Phew, I\u2019m all right now.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t trust him, but Shizuna thought it would be better to wait for Ryuichi to tell her before jumping to conclusions. It was a pretty strange thought to come to, but it didn\u2019t bother her too much, and it was almost as if all the worrying she\u2019d done earlier was a lie.\u201cFufu, you know, Shizuna, it\u00a0is\u00a0your birthday next month, so maybe it has something to do with that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dIndeed, Shizuna\u2019s birthday was coming up next month. If it was related to that, as Sakie said, and he had prepared the box for her as a surprise, it was understandable that he\u2019d tried so hard to get it back.\u201c\u2026I still can\u2019t say for sure, but maybe you\u2019re right.\u201dAlthough the thought warmed her heart, at the same time she laughed at the fact that she was a troublesome woman for having worried so much over it. But speaking of which, Shizuna wanted to know when Ryuichi\u2019s birthday was, too. Normally, she would have known this information a little earlier, but she\u2019d been so happy spending her days with Ryuichi that it had completely slipped her mind.\u201cI might as well ask Chisa-san, since it would be a bad idea to ask Ryuichi-kun himself in this situation.\u201dWith this objective in mind, Shizuna returned to her room in a pleasant, relieved mood. Once she got to her room, she climbed into her bed and, with her back against the wall, operated her phone and opened a folder of photos.\u201c\u2026Fufu. \u266a\u201dShe\u2019d recently gotten to looking at her pictures with Ryuichi like this before going to bed. By preserving the days she had spent with Ryuichi in the form of photographs, she would always be able to remember everything they did through each individual picture. Of course, there was still that certain embarrassing photo from way back, but\u2026now, she could laugh at them as one of her memories.\u201c\u2026I feel so fulfilled. I never would\u2019ve imagined that just by having a boyfriend, my days would become so much more enjoyable.\u201dTo Shizuna, everything she felt now was all thanks to Ryuichi being there with her. She had never really loved a person as much as she did now, and could have never imagined that she would love someone so much that even if she gave her entire being to them, it would still not be enough.\u201cI wonder what Ryuichi-kun is doing now?\u201dThen, while looking at the pictures, she began to imagine what Ryuichi was doing.\u201c\u2026A boy at night, alone. That could only mean\u2026 Nah, I don\u2019t see that happening.\u201dA man at night, alone, watching lewd things while\u2026 was something she\u2019d imagined, but she couldn\u2019t see Ryuichi doing that. Well, she knew it was unlikely that he\u2019d\u00a0never\u00a0done it before, and she was sure he\u2019d seen his fair share of adult content too, but\u2026she couldn\u2019t see the present Ryuichi doing that.\u201cI\u2019ll try calling him.\u201dWell, it was one thing to look back on her memories with Ryuichi before going to bed, but hearing his voice in person was, after all, the best way to end the day. It was just before ten o\u2019clock, so Ryuichi was probably still awake. Shizuna called Ryuichi, thinking that it would be okay since he did not have his part-time job today.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s not picking up.\u201dShe tried again several more times, but Ryuichi did not pick up the phone. Thinking that he might be busy or already in bed, Shizuna put her phone down on her bedside\u2026when suddenly, her ringtone for incoming calls played. Shizuna quickly picked up her phone again.\u201cAh\u2026 Fufu. \u266a\u201dOf course, it was Ryuichi.\u201cHello, Ryuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cHey. Sorry I didn\u2019t pick up.\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201dShizuna then chatted with Ryuichi. Sitting on the floor, she closed her eyes and listened to Ryuichi\u2019s voice carefully as they talked, and she could feel her mouth naturally relax as she did.\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you dressed as a butler, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cReally? That kinda gives me mixed feelings, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cDoes it now? But you know, I\u2019m going to be wearing a maid\u2019s outfit too, so we\u2019re even.\u201d\u201cWell, true that. Speaking of which, it\u2019s not often I see you in a maid\u2019s uniform, so how about we slip away later and have some fun?\u201dOf course, the \u2018fun\u2019 Ryuichi was referring to in this case was sex.\u201cTry not to dirty the uniform, okay?\u201dShe, too, was pretty much on board with his idea.Of course, it wasn\u2019t like they would only talk about school and the festival, so naturally, the topic shifted to something else entirely.\u201cHey, Shizuna. Are you interested in hot springs?\u201d\u201cHmm, well, I\u2019m interested in any place so long as you\u2019re by my side, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d Ryuichi remarked and laughed. Then, he continued.\u201cYou see, I actually went out to eat with Satsuki today, and there happened to be a raffle drawing at the restaurant. So, Satsuki just drew one for fun and ended up winning a voucher for a stay at a hot spring inn.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?\u201dApparently, he\u2019d had dinner with Satsuki today and won a voucher for a stay at an inn then. When he asked Shizuna if she wanted to go to the hot spring inn together with him, she immediately said yes.\u201cOf course I want to go. It\u2019s a trip with just you and me, Ryuichi-kun!\u201d\u201cThat was fast. Well, timing-wise, the trip\u2019ll happen in winter, so it\u2019ll be a while until we go.\u201dNo matter how long she had to wait, from Shizuna\u2019s point of view, she felt no other emotion than joy. It would be even more fun if Chisa, Satsuki, and Sakie were there with them, but alas, the voucher was only good for two people, so that was not an option.\u201cLet\u2019s take some other opportunity and go on a trip with everyone together. I want to have fun with everyone, too.\u201d\u201cRight. I feel the same way, too.\u201dBut for now, Shizuna was excited that she and Ryuichi would be having fun together. After that, she and Ryuichi talked about a variety of topics, and before she knew it, the clock hands showed 12:00 AM\u2026 In other words, the moment the date changed.\u201cWe were really immersed in our conversation, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t stop listening to your voice\u2026 I love you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I love you too.\u201dWhile she wished he would stop with his abrupt blows, it was also in her nature as a woman to wish for him to say more to her.\u201cThey do say staying up late is the skin\u2019s natural enemy. Let\u2019s call it a day.\u201d\u201cAlright. See you tomorrow, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah. G\u2019night.\u201d\u201cGood night.\u201dThus, their call ended there. Shizuna felt sadness at no longer being able to hear his voice, but smiled bitterly because, just as she\u2019d said with her own mouth, she\u2019d be able to see him again when she went to school, so all she had to do was be patient for a little bit.\u201cGood night\u2026 Ryuichi-kun.\u201dWith his words still lingering in her head, Shizuna drifted off to sleep. Then, that night, she dreamt about traveling with Ryuichi as quickly as possible.\u201cRyuichi-kun! Let\u2019s go to the hot springs!\u201d\u201cSlow down. The hot spring\u2019s not gonna go anywhere.\u201d\u201cBut my time together with you is slipping away!!\u201dShizuna tugged on Ryuichi\u2019s arm as if she were a child, perhaps a sign that she couldn\u2019t wait for the planned trip. There were many other guests besides Ryuichi and Shizuna, including three women who were so beautiful that Ryuichi turned his attention to them, even if only for a moment\u2026 That was the kind of dream she had.But, nevertheless, their trip to the hot springs would still be a long ways away. The first event they had to face was the cultural festival, for which preparations steadily progressed until finally, the day of the festival arrived.\u201cLookin\u2019 good, you two!\u201d\u201c\u2026Man, you look cool, Ryuichi.\u201dRyuichi was dressed in a butler\u2019s uniform with his hair swept back. Meanwhile, Shizuna, dressed in a mini-skirted maid\u2019s outfit, monopolized the gazes of their surroundings.\u201c\u2026I wanna go home.\u201d\u201cNo can do, Ryuichi-kun. \u266a\u201dAnd so, with their classmates gathered around them, the curtains raised on their cultural festival as second-year students.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Three Bad Boys Make An AppearanceTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrThe cultural festival proved to be just as exciting as the sports festival. Each class from every grade presented a different exhibit, and although some of them were similar, they each had slight differences, so there was a sense of freshness to the festival. Among them was a cafe run by students in unusual costumes which was especially crowded, and the presence of handsome men and beautiful women there alone attracted an increasing number of people.\u201cWelcome home, Master.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sooo cute, Shizuna-chan!!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very endearing, Shizuna-chan.\u201dThis was one scene from the lively cultural festival. The class Ryuichi and Shizuna were in was doing a butler and maid cafe, and Chisa and Satsuki could be seen with Shizuna, who was dressed in a maid\u2019s uniform.\u201cThank you very much, you two. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026God, my heart just skipped a beat.\u201d\u201cWhat destructive power she has.\u201dShizuna\u2019s mini-skirt showed off much of her dazzling legs, and her maid uniform showed her body lines well, highlighting her breasts roundness\u2026 These already made for a very lewd and wonderful sight, but Shizuna\u2019s beautiful and cute smile made Chisa and Satsuki\u2019s hearts melt even further. Her hair, which was usually straight, was now tied in twin-tails as well, which was quite a fresh look.\u201cIf only Sakie-san were here to see this.\u201d\u201cYup. I heard she got called into work?\u201d\u201cSomething urgent came up\u2026so unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t make it.\u201dYes, sadly Sakie wasn\u2019t able to come to the festival today. This greatly disappointed Shizuna, but she also thought that one day, there would come a time when she would show this appearance to Sakie at home too.Of course, when that time comes, I\u2019ll have to call Ryuichi-kun over, too. \u266aShizuna had the faith that Ryuichi would do it, even though he would probably make a begrudged face.\u201cExhibits like these seem like they\u2019d attract some dangerous customers though; will you be okay?\u201d\u201cYes, I think so. So far, there haven\u2019t been any troublesome guests. There\u2019s a teacher standing by too in anticipation of that.\u201dInviting guests from outside was bound to carry some risks. There were certain people who would find fault with the female waiters and needlessly cause a huge fuss over it, which was a real problem. As Shizuna looked around at her classmates serving the guests with their trays clutched to their chests, Chisa giggled.\u201cHeehee, I\u2019m sure the other girls here are cute too, but I think you have to be the most careful, okay, Shizuna-chan?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fufu, thank you.\u201dThat was just how good looking Shizuna was. Well, from Shizuna\u2019s point of view, Chisa and Satsuki were also frighteningly beautiful ladies and attracted the attention of their surroundings, including the students who were here now, so they also had to be careful.\u2026Well, it\u00a0is\u00a0Chisa-san we\u2019re talking about here, so I guess there\u2019s no point in worrying about it.Chisa was a beautiful and sexy college student, but just as Shizuna suspected, it was useless to worry about her since she was a headstrong woman who even asserted herself against Ryuichi from time to time. Now, with two of Shizuna\u2019s important friends here as customers, Ryuichi, who was probably wanted by both of them, was nowhere to be seen.\u201cIs Ryuichi-kun not here?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s on his break right now. I\u2019m pretty sure he should be back any second now, though\u2026\u201dRyuichi was currently taking his break along with Makoto and Kaname. Just as Shizuna said, he should be back soon, so they didn\u2019t need to worry since the two of them would be able to see him too.\u201cFufu, that\u2019s good to hear. \u266a\u201d\u201cWell, not that I\u2019m saying otherwise for you, Shizuna-chan, but I can\u2019t wait to see Ryuichi.\u201dChisa and Satsuki put a strawberry parfait, one of the items served on the menu, in their mouths and tasted it. It was very well made, considering it was made by students.\u201cShizuna, you can leave things here to me. Could you take care of the guests over there?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShizuna had other things to do as well, but since her acquaintances were here, she had wavered over whether it would be right of her to prioritize those over them. Gratefully, she nodded her head and went over to handle a couple of customers. Then, time went by without any problems, and Shizuna and her friends were having a good time\u2014when suddenly, the kind of troublesome guests that the girls had just been talking about appeared.\u201cWowie~! Got a buncha cute girls here, don\u2019t we!\u201d\u201cIs that one a college girl? She looks hella hot.\u201dThe two guys who approached loudly and proudly were a pair of flashy, flamboyant guys by the looks of it. The boys, likely around the same age as Shizuna and students from a different high school, leisurely approached Shizuna and her friends.\u201cIf they\u2019re maids, they\u2019re probably going to service us, eh?\u201d\u201cWonder what kinda service they\u2019re gonna give?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna heaved a heavy sigh in her heart. They had just been having a blast and enjoying their time, and as if ruining that wasn\u2019t enough, the boys\u2019 behavior seemed to put a damper on the hard work everyone else in the class was doing. Perhaps having sensed trouble brewing, the girl in charge quickly moved to call the teacher and left the classroom.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you read the rules before you entered? Pretty sure it says they wouldn\u2019t do anything outside the realm of common sense, didn\u2019t it?\u201dAnd of course, there was no way that the strong-willed Chisa would stay silent. One might think that she should not be reckless, since even though they were still high school students, they were nevertheless men, but Chisa had both the courage and guts to do so.\u201cOh? Got a tough one here, eh?\u201d\u201cBut she\u2019s totally my type. Whaddaya say, wanna head to a hotel with me after this?\u201dThe boys did not seem to care about what they were doing at all, and were even inviting Chisa to a hotel, of all things.\u201cYou look like you have a small dick among other things, so pass.\u201d\u201cPfft?!\u201dA woman who was sitting next to her, drinking her tea while keeping an eye on the situation spit her drink out at Chisa\u2019s words. The boys, offended by her comment, changed their expressions a little and took a step toward Chisa.\u201cOi, oi, aint\u2019cha bein\u2019 a bit rude?\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how you want to play. Now you\u2019ve done\u2014\u201dJust as his hand was about to reach Chisa, the voice that Shizuna and the others had been waiting for with all their hearts was heard from the entrance of the classroom.\u201cDear customers, could you\u00a0please\u00a0not cause a ruckus?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dAll those present in the classroom stopped moving. The owner of this powerful voice, Ryuichi, entered with Makoto and Kaname in tow. All three had their hair swept back and were fitted in their butler uniforms, but their expressions were very stern, partly because they had been delinquents until a little while ago.\u201cUrk\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026The hell is up with these guys?\u201dThe appearance of these three yakuza-like men looked just like the appearance of the main character and his comrades in a manga. Ryuichi, standing in the center of the group, moved his hand to loosen his collar as if to say, \u201cIf you wanna have a go, come at me.\u201d\u201cI get wanting to show off to pretty girls, but you should know your place.\u201d\u201cIf you still wanna get down and physical, we\u2019ll be your opponents.\u201dThe whole class was completely engulfed in the atmosphere created by the three of them. The two boys sensed that they had lost and quickly left the classroom, not even bothering to click their tongues.\u201c\u2026Wooo!\u201d\u201cThat was so cool!\u201dThat very instant, a chorus of applause erupted, as in praise of the three.\u201cI got the teacher\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Missed my turn, huh?\u201dUnfortunately, the teacher who\u2019d arrived late wouldn\u2019t get to make an appearance this time. By no means were they intimated by the boys, but Shizuna smiled in relief and even Satsuki had hearts in her eyes.\u201c\u2026You were very cool.\u201d\u201cSatsuki? I don\u2019t think you should get all enthralled here.\u201dSatsuki\u2019s face turned completely feminine at the sight of Ryuichi\u2019s rare side, and even Chisa was blushing as she gave her warning to Satsuki.\u201c\u2026You were cool.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dRyuichi chuckled at the good impression he made on the two. So, at long last, Ryuichi in his butler outfit was side by side with Shizuna in her maid outfit.\u201cDo you wanna take a pic with us too, Chisa, Satsuki?\u201d\u201cI do!\u201d\u201cI want a pic!!\u201d\u201cR-Right\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat excitement\u2026\u201dRyuichi asked a classmate to be the photographer, and Ryuichi and Shizuna lined up with Chisa and Satsuki in between them. All four of them had their pictures taken with their respective smartphones, and thus another new memory was formed.\u201cOh, I know! Give me a stimulating line, please!\u201d\u201cSatsuki, how far entranced are you\u2026\u201d\u201cA stimulating line, you say\u2026\u201dThen, Ryuichi, seemingly having come up with something, whispered in Satsuki\u2019s ear.\u201cYoung miss, what say you I ravage you senseless?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Fuwaa. \u266a\u201dHer whole body shivered, and she immediately slumped to the floor. Ryuichi slightly regretted it, wondering if he\u2019d gone too far.\u201cSatsuki? Did you get wet?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201dWith a thumbs up, Satsuki replied to Chisa. Incidentally, Shizuna, who was watching what had just happened, was also slightly stimulated and now begged him to say that line to her too.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Don\u2019t End Up Like Me, Okay?Translated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrDuring the festival, each class had their own exhibit to manage, but that didn\u2019t mean they would be stuck there the entire time, as each student was allotted some free time. Ryuichi and Shizuna each took a one-hour break, and went around the school with Chisa and Satsuki.\u201cI guess they\u2019ve got some pretty decent exhibits here for a bunch of high school students.\u201d\u201cFufu, you don\u2019t sound very convincing when you\u2019re clearly enjoying this a lot, Chisa-san.\u201dThe two beautiful women playing around in front of Ryuichi and Shizuna, a pair of college students who were beyond the confines of high school students, were truly mature women. They were also very beautiful and attracted the attention of not only students but also parents just by walking around.\u201cThese two really stand out, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cWell, can\u2019t say that\u2019s unexpected.\u201dIf it were just the two of them walking alone, it would be one thing, but when Ryuichi was with them like this, the girls engaged in a lot of physical contact, even if it was unconsciously. Whenever Chisa said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at that thing next,\u201d Chisa would take Ryuichi\u2019s arm in hers as if to show off her intimacy with him.\u201cAll right, all right, slow down. The exhibits aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\u201cI know. But my time here with you will slip away.\u201dRyuichi chuckled at how she\u2019d used the same words he\u2019d envisioned Shizuna using the other day. Chisa was the eldest of them all, so one would\u2019ve expected her to show a little more maturity and dignity as their senior, but to Ryuichi, she looked very cute when she was excited.Damn, that\u2019s one hell of an adorable face she\u2019s making.It was really rare to see this kind of expression on her face, and it was probably only at events like these that he could see it. That was why Ryuichi wanted to listen to her whims as much as possible, so if she pulled on his arm, he would follow along with her.\u201cSorry, Shizuna-chan, for intruding on your time together like this.\u201d\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s totally fine. \u266a\u201dThat being said, dragging Ryuichi around on her whims also took away Shizuna\u2019s time with him. Chisa wasn\u2019t the only one; Satsuki also felt bad about it, but Shizuna herself was happy and pleased to see them getting along and didn\u2019t utter a single complaint.\u201cAh, it\u2019s a haunted house.\u201d\u201c\u2026Looks pretty realistic, huh?\u201dThey arrived at a haunted house run by another class of second years, and as Satsuki said, it had quite the authentic feel to it. The girls working at the reception desk also had very realistic blood on their faces, so much so that some small children even started crying at the sight of it.\u201cHow about the three of us girls go inside?\u201d\u201cOh, sounds good. I\u2019ll wait outside.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026? Huh?!\u201d\u201cAh, are you perhaps scared of haunted houses, Satsuki-san?\u201dIt seemed Satsuki wasn\u2019t good with things like haunted houses and looked to Ryuichi for help, but Ryuichi was interested to see how she would react, so he had no intention of extending her a lifeline.\u201cHang in there, Satsuki. I\u2019ll hug you as much as I can when you come back.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll do my best!!\u201dSatsuki was now full of enthusiasm as she clenched her fist tightly, and Chisa and Shizuna smiled at her as the three of them went inside together.\u201cAhhhhhhh?!?!?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA ghastly scream could be heard immediately afterward, but Ryuichi chuckled, thinking that this too was just another ordeal she had to overcome. In this chaotic situation, with Satsuki\u2019s screams and Chisa\u2019s laughter, Ryuichi passed the time by playing with his phone until the girls came back.\u201cOh, if it isn\u2019t Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThe person who\u2019d just walked by was Shinjo. Ryuichi lightly raised his hand in response, and Shinjo made his way to his side.\u201cWord is you\u2019ve been walking around with three beautiful women in tow\u2026 Haha, are the princesses in the haunted house?\u201d\u201cYep. Looks like it was scary enough to get a scream from them, y\u2019know?\u201d\u201cI see; guess that just goes to show you shouldn\u2019t underestimate it just because it was made by high schoolers, huh?\u201dIt all made Ryuichi want to experience it too, but if Ryuichi was not there when the girls returned, Satsuki might seriously cry, so he mused that he\u2019d probably have to wait there like a good boy.\u201cSay, Sensei. It\u2019s kinda boring just standing around doing nothing, so talk about something.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s sudden.\u201d\u201cI mean, do you really have nothing? You could talk about your high school days or something.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dRyuichi talked about how it would be boring to just sit around waiting idly. Shinjo pondered for a while, then laughed and said that there was nothing in particular about his youth that he could talk about. He then spoke in a somewhat lonely tone.\u201cAs I\u2019ve told you before, I used to be an unruly kid. I got into a lot of fights in high school, so I squandered any chance I had at a regular youth.\u201d\u201cMan, I seriously can\u2019t picture it just by hearing it.\u201d\u201cIf the people who knew me back then saw me now, their jaws would drop in shock. That\u2019s just how bad and hopeless I was.\u201dShinjo continued to speak further, staring at the palm of his own hand.\u201cBut even then, there was a girl who cared about me. She was a studious and well-mannered student, the kind of girl who shouldn\u2019t have been around me, a delinquent.\u201d\u201cHooh?\u201dThe fact that Shinjo used to be a delinquent was interesting enough, but the fact that he also used to have a woman by his side back then made it even more intriguing. However, Shinjo seemed to have some regrets. And Ryuichi\u2019s hunch turned out to be right.\u201cI rejected the hand she offered me. I rejected her kindness. She was the only one who was looking at me, yet I couldn\u2019t trust her, so I selfishly rejected her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, I guess I was a little jealous of you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShinjo laughed. Since being assigned to this school, it was natural that he would learn about the students here, so he knew the current Ryuichi as well as the past Ryuichi very well. In terms of being delinquents, Ryuichi and Shinjo were similar to each other; the difference was that the present Ryuichi had held the hand that had been extended to him and had changed.\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t ask too much about you. There\u2019s this really talkative girl in your class, and she told me lots of things.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who was it?\u201d\u201cHaha, well, cut us some slack here. So, you used to be a serious delinquent, but one day, with Rindo-san by your side, your atmosphere softened, and now you\u2019re adored by lots of students. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cWell, whether they adore me or not is up for debate, but they do talk to me a lot now.\u201dRyuichi understood what Shinjo was trying to say. Like Ryuichi, Shinjo probably had had the opportunity to change, but regretted not taking it to this day. There was certainly the possibility that Ryuichi would have spent his days regretting like Shinjo if he had taken a wrong step somewhere, but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if that would also hold true if Shizuna had fallen after all.\u2026No, I definitely prefer the way things are now. This present moment when I have Shizuna, Chisa, Satsuki, and Sakie.He had been alone for a long time, but not anymore. Now he could always see them next to him, always talking to him, and he knew they loved him dearly. And conversely, Ryuichi also loved them with all his heart.\u201cHeh, I\u2019ll do my best to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to the happiness in my hands.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s good\u2026 I see now. I understand why you\u2019re liked by so many people. Even Someya-sensei said she would\u2019ve definitely confessed to you if she were a student as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Seriously?\u201d\u201cYeah. If anything, I\u2019m pretty sure she would\u2019ve gone after you if you were single and available.\u201dThat was information he didn\u2019t really want to hear. Someya was indeed a beautiful woman and a good teacher who cared about her students, but he had never been aware of her as a member of the opposite sex until now, so he had mixed feelings about the matter.\u201cI\u2019m gonna pretend I didn\u2019t hear that. I\u2019ve got more than enough women on my plate.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019d love to be able to say something like that too.\u201d\u201cWell, at the very least, if you\u2019re gonna become a teacher, you gotta be careful.\u201d\u201cBecause a teacher has to be there for their students, huh?\u201dThen they smiled at each other. He didn\u2019t mean to use Shinjo\u2019s story as a reference point, but he did think that human connections truly were important for everyone. The connections between people were infinite, but the people one would get to know were limited, and it was even rarer for their hearts to be connected\u2014which was why Ryuichi believed that they must be cherished.\u201cR-Ryuichi-kuun!!\u201d\u201cOof.\u201dIt was Satsuki who hugged him tightly from behind, and it seemed that the princesses had finally returned. As he hugged Satsuki, who was probably quite scared seeing as she was shedding tears, he asked them how it had gone, to which he received three different replies.\u201cIt had quite the impact.\u201d\u201cIt was so-so.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m never coming back!!\u201dLeaving aside Shizuna and Chisa, the receptionist had a wonderful smile on her face when she saw how Satsuki was responding.\u201cSeriously, who wouldn\u2019t get jealous after seeing this? Just what I\u2019d expect from you, Shishido-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it\u2019s often crossed my mind how these girls are too good for me.\u201d\u201cTake good care of them.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe girls are tilted their heads at the sight of Ryuichi and Shinjo. Afterwards, everyone had a good time as they took Satsuki around in various ways to soothe her weary mind from the haunted house. Thus came to an end the cultural festival in which Ryuichi participated in earnest, and a truly irreplaceable memory was created for him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83A Sweet, Passionate Night at the End of the Cultural FestivalTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Today was such a blast.\u201dRyuichi quietly muttered this to himself. The lively atmosphere of the festival had already died down, and a closing party was being held with a blazing fire in the center of the grounds. He never would\u2019ve thought that he would be participating not only in the festival, but also in the after-party, and he objectively thought to himself that he really had changed.\u201cChisa and Satsuki\u2019s already left, and all that remains is Shizuna, but\u2026she\u2019s probably going to take a while.\u201dAt first, they hadn\u2019t planned to attend the after-party, but Shizuna\u2019s friends wanted her to spend some time with them, and she agreed with a troubled look on her face, which was how Ryuichi ended up waiting for her.\u201cThey really adore her, huh? That\u2019s good.\u201dSeeing Shizuna smiling surrounded by her many friends, Ryuichi himself could not help but smile. Some time later, Shizuna slipped out of her circle of friends and returned to Ryuichi, indicating it was time for them to leave.\u201cAlright, see you later, everyone.\u201d\u201cYeah! Bye, bye, Shizuna!\u201cOh, and sorry again, Shishido!\u201d\u201cNo prob.\u201dThey exchanged words with their classmates before leaving the school. As they left the school, the growing silence grew more and more apparent, and a feeling of loneliness descended that made him think that the lively cultural festival had really come to an end.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cThe cultural festival. Aren\u2019t you glad you participated in it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, I am. It was really fun.\u201dRyuichi smiled and thought back to the events that had happened throughout the festival. Working with his classmates to run the cafe, the commotion at the haunted house afterwards, the fun time he spent not only with Shizuna but also with Chisa and Satsuki, and the calming after-party at the end\u2026 It really made him wonder again and again\u2014why he hadn\u2019t attended last year.\u201cI\u2019m really grateful to you and the girls for changing me into what I am now.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got it wrong, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShizuna giggled and uttered this.\u201cWe only gave you a push. Ultimately, it\u2019s all because of you and your efforts that you changed, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026A push is pretty much the same thing, though.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. But I still think that you wanting to change yourself played a bigger role.\u201dHe wondered which one it really was, but felt that if he tried to drag the matter out, the conversation would never end, so Ryuichi meekly nodded his head. They then headed to Shizuna\u2019s house, where a delicious dinner was ready and waiting for them. Ryuichi poured some sauce on his favorite food, pork cutlet, and bit into it. He seemed very satisfied with the flavor of the savory meat as he gobbled it up.\u201cYou know, Chisa-chan showed me some pictures of you two, but I\u2019d really like to see them in person; how you look in your butler and maid outfits, that is.\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019ll show you, Mom.\u201d\u201cI\u2019mma pass.\u201dRyuichi gave an immediate answer. In truth, it wasn\u2019t a problem limited only to the butler\u2019s uniform that Ryuichi wore, but nevertheless, the fact that it was really tight and uncomfortable to wear were among the reasons why he did not want to wear it again. Well, such tight-fitting clothes were what butler uniforms were, but they didn\u2019t suit Ryuichi.\u201cFufu, he was complaining about how tight it was, after all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I thought we could\u2019ve had lots of\u00a0fun\u00a0with you in your butler uniform, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dSakie said this with a look of heartfelt disappointment. It was no surprise that she no longer had any resistance to saying things like these in front of her own daughter, and Sakie stared at Ryuichi intently, hoping that he would change his mind. Unfortunately, even if she, Shizuna\u2019s mother\u2014a beautiful woman with whom he\u2019d had relations\u2014looked at him that way, it did not change Ryuichi\u2019s firm determination.\u201cThen, perhaps I shall become a maid instead and heal you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cHow did you jump to that conclusion\u2026\u201dHe wanted to tell Sakie to think about her age, but her youthful appearance was just unfair, as it silenced those words completely. Sakie smiled contentedly at Ryuichi, who faltered on his words, and Ryuichi had a feeling that she would be showing off her maid\u2019s outfit in the near future.\u201cMaybe you could be like a Victorian maid, Mom?\u201d\u201cMy, that sounds nice. An older maid serving her master, Ryuichi-kun\u2026 Yup, that has quite the nice ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, it might not be too bad.\u201dRyuichi tried to picture it rather seriously. Shizuna had been very pretty in her maid costume, but when it came to her mother, Sakie, she was a mature and sexy woman. If she were to come dressed in a maid\u2019s outfit and heal him both physically and mentally, Ryuichi would probably not be able to resist her.\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019ll be lookin\u2019 forward to it.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dHe wondered if he had been too hasty, but seeing her making a smile very similar to Shizuna\u2019s made him unable to tell her off strongly.\u201cYou know, we actually had some troublesome customers earlier today\u2014\u201d\u201cOoh. So Ryuichi-kun and his friends\u2014\u201dWhile watching the mother and daughter pair conversing amicably, Ryuichi devoured dish after dish, including his pork cutlet and some mapo tofu.\u201c\u2026This really has a nostalgic taste.\u201dThe dish that Ryuichi thought was the most delicious was meat and potato stew, the first meal Shizuna ever made for him and one that had been etched in his memory. The meat and potato stew he had before him now was made by Sakie, but since they were mother and daughter, the seasoning had been reproduced so perfectly that he couldn\u2019t find the slightest of differences, and every bite brought back memories for him.\u201cThanks for the food.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dRyuichi, who had had quite the amount of food yet managed to finish it all, looked satisfied and clasped his hands together, and Sakie smiled broadly at the fact that he\u2019d eaten heartily. Normally, Ryuichi would\u2019ve just gone home after having dinner, but since tomorrow was a holiday, he would be staying at Shizuna\u2019s house today.\u201cCome on, Ryuichi-kun, let\u2019s get in.\u201d\u201cComing.\u201dThen, for the first time in a long time, she suggested they take a bath together, and Ryuichi agreed. After washing each other\u2019s bodies and lightly flirting with each other, they happily soaked in the bathtub together. Shizuna sat between Ryuichi\u2019s legs, her back resting on his firm chest as she wore an ecstatic look on her face.\u201cHaaah, this is so relieving. I like it when I\u2019m snuggled up against you like this.\u201d\u201cHeh, really now?\u201dShizuna let out a pleasant moan, but it was clear that it wasn\u2019t solely due to the wonderfully relaxing temperature of the water. With a beautiful girl right in front of him, completely nude and with her body stuck to his, there was no way that Ryuichi wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201cWhy are girls\u2019 bodies so soft?\u201dWhen he muttered this while rubbing Shizuna\u2019s ample breasts, she turned her head around and sank into thought.\u201cI guess that\u2019s just how things are. Besides, boobs are really just lumps of fat, you know?\u201d\u201cYeah, but\u2026it still feels good to touch them.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 \u266a\u201dAs they soaked in the bathtub, Ryuichi relentlessly used his hands to pleasure Shizuna. Shizuna never once asked him to stop, either, simply surrendering herself to the sweet stimulation Ryuichi was giving her. They decided to continue the act in their room before going to bed, and then left the bath to avoid getting dizzy and fainting.\u201cHmm, hmm, hmm~ \u266a\u201dRyuichi returned to the room and looked at Shizuna, who was humming while drying her hair. Her black hair was free of any bristles and remained straight and silky from the hairline to the ends. She\u2019d told him that she didn\u2019t really do anything special to maintain her hair, but clearly, she seemed to be putting a lot of effort into taking care of it.\u2026Man, being alone with Shizuna like this really makes me feel at easeAfter she finished with her hair, she looked in the mirror and nodded her head in satisfaction when Ryuichi suddenly hugged her from behind. Shizuna squealed cutely in surprise, but soon she too put her hand on his arm that went around her waist and stroked it lovingly.\u201cI\u2019m so happy that I can now make love to the man I love, even at night.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way, too. Hey, Shizuna?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHolding his beloved girlfriend in his arms made Ryuichi want to continue where they left off in the bath right away. He dropped kisses on Shizuna\u2019s neck, and it was as if he could still feel the heat of her body that had yet to cool down from the bath as he opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m not gonna let you sleep tonight.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah. \u266a\u201dRyuichi was a little excited, which made him speak a line that he didn\u2019t usually speak. Shizuna instantly understood the meaning of his words, and the flames of lust rekindled in her gaze on Ryuichi.I love you, Shizuna.I love you, Ryuichi-kun.The same thought was going through both of their minds as they kissed each other intensely, and they spent another hot and intense night together\u2026Sakie joined them halfway in, too.Thus, with the end of the cultural festival, the next event would be Shizuna\u2019s birthday. Shizuna wasn\u2019t worried about whether or not Ryuichi\u2019s gift would make her happy, but of course, the same couldn\u2019t be said for Ryuichi, who was naturally feeling anxious.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Her Birthday, And This Love Once MoreTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJr\u201c\u2026Damn.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSomething up?\u201dIt was the same morning scene as usual, with Ryuichi\u2019s two friends, Makoto and Kaname, by his side. Ryuichi was looking somewhat restless and nervous today; he would sometimes glance at his watch or look in the wrong direction. Since Ryuichi was usually a bold and confident man, it was a new experience for both of them to see him in such an unusual manner.\u2026Why the heck am I so nervous? Why can\u2019t I just do as I always do?Of course, Ryuichi understood his own restlessness\u2026 Now, the reason why Ryuichi was like this was simple: it all had to do with today\u2019s date. It was October 10th, Shizuna\u2019s birthday.\u201cIt\u2019s Shizuna\u2019s birthday, you see.\u201d\u201cAh~.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe two of them immediately showed looks of understanding. In addition, Kaname started grinning and jabbed him teasingly with his elbow.\u201cSo even you get nervous over things like these, huh? Why don\u2019t you just fuck her like crazy and give her a child for her birthday present?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201dHe might consider doing something like that in the future, but for now Ryuichi and Shizuna were students, so he intended to keep things in moderation. He didn\u2019t mean to put things this way, but for Ryuichi, children could only bring cons to a student like him, and besides, he wasn\u2019t old enough to take responsibility yet, so he had to draw a line there.\u201cBut you\u00a0have\u00a0bought her a present, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. And I plan on giving it to her today.\u201dAlthough it wasn\u2019t so extravagant that it had squandered all the money he\u2019d earned from his part-time job, the ring he would be giving to Shizuna was still an expensive purchase for a student.He had been with Shizuna all this time and had gotten to know her pretty well. Therefore, he could easily imagine that she would be absolutely delighted when he gave the ring to her, which took away from the excitement and anticipation, but it still made him happy knowing he\u2019d be able to see her smile.Not to mention Chisa and Satsuki\u2019s act of consideration.Originally, Shizuna\u2019s birthday was to be celebrated with everyone, but the girls had an inkling as to what Ryuichi might give Shizuna, so they decided to celebrate it again on another day.\u201cMake sure to make it a cherished memory, okay?\u201d\u201cHrmm, but it\u2019s a shame I won\u2019t get to see Shizuna-chan\u2019s joy in person.\u201dChisa and Satsuki seemed very disappointed about that point, but he was planning to take pictures of her, so he should be able to show them what she looked like later.\u201cShizuna, happy birthday!\u201d\u201cHappy birthday~!\u201d\u201cThanks, you guys. I\u2019m really happy. \u266a\u201dShizuna looked overjoyed as she was surrounded by her friends celebrating her birthday. However, with this, Ryuichi was now the younger one between them as his birthday was actually later than hers, so although it wasn\u2019t true strictly speaking, Shizuna was now something like an older woman, which was a pretty new feeling. But, well, Shizuna had always been more of a reserved and humble person, so he doubted she would ever act like a big sister if it wasn\u2019t an act.\u201cRyuichi-kun, what would you like big sis Shizuna to do for you?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026Not bad, not bad at all,\u00a0Ryuichi thought, but still, it didn\u2019t quite fit her image.\u201cNow what are you sighing for?\u201d\u201cWho knows. I\u2019m simulating something in my head, so you two scram.\u201dWhen he said this and waved his hand as if to shoo them away, Makoto and Kaname\u2019s shoulders shook and they started laughing.\u201cDid you hear that, Makoto?\u00a0That\u00a0Ryuichi is actually having delusions about a woman!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve really changed, haven\u2019t ya, Ryuichi? Aight, well, good luck, man. We\u2019ll be rooting for you.\u201d\u201cAghhhhh! Just get the hell outta here!\u201dMakoto and Kaname were smiling widely and directing warm gazes at him, so Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but shout loudly to get rid of them. It was only natural that Shizuna, having heard his loud voice, would approach him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothin\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dShizuna tilted her head confusedly, but borrowed a chair from the seat beside him nonetheless and sat down so that she could settle in her usual position. Ryuichi had already wished Shizuna a happy birthday on their way to school together this morning, so there was no need to tell her that now. He\u2019d also made plans to go out and have dinner with her tonight, and asked her for some of her time afterwards.\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to tonight. Anything I do with you feels like it would be fun and wonderful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear. Well, you can look forward to my present too.\u201d\u201cI will. \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShizuna\u2019s smile continued to charm Ryuichi to no end. It made him want to leave school and stay with her to his heart\u2019s content, but he managed to calm himself down.Time passed steadily, and soon, the long-awaited afternoon arrived for Ryuichi. They each returned to their own homes first, then once night approached, Ryuichi left his apartment to pick up Shizuna.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201dHe made sure to bring the ring he would give her, and then looked over the message he got from the manager.\u201cGive my name to the restaurant in front of \u3007\u3007. They\u2019ll let you in as soon as you arrive. Make Shizuna-chan a very happy girl.\u201dThe manager had gone out of his way to reserve an expensive restaurant for Ryuichi and Shizuna too. The restaurant was originally fully booked, but at the request of the manager, the owner of the restaurant managed to force their reservation in, which made Ryuichi wonder again how vast the manager\u2019s connections were.\u201cGood evening, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201dRyuichi had immediately headed for Shizuna\u2019s house and found her waiting for him at the front door. She was wearing a bit of makeup and looked even more attractive than usual, and Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but admire her, even if only for a moment.\u201c\u2026Geez, how beautiful are you gonna get?\u201d\u201cToday is special for me, so don\u2019t you want me to look more beautiful than usual?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need makeup to look beautiful.\u201d\u201cThank you. \u266a\u201dAs they exchanged words like this, Ryuichi took Shizuna\u2019s hand and started walking. They made some small talk on the way like they always did, and eventually they arrived in front of their destination, the restaurant that the manager had reserved for them.\u201cIs this the place?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s incredible.\u201dIt was clearly not a place for two students to be coming to. The building was so magnificent that he wondered if this was really the right place, but a man standing by the entrance called out to Ryuichi as if to offer him a helping hand.\u201cWelcome, are you two perhaps Shishido-sama and Rindo-sama?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you from the manager. Right this way, please.\u201dAnd just like that, they were taken into the restaurant.\u201cDoes he go by \u2018manager\u2019 even here?\u201d\u201cYes, he does. I\u2019ve heard that he and the owner of our restaurant were allies who went through the battlefield together.\u201dWho the heck is the manager\u2026?\u00a0Ryuichi and Shizuna both thought in their hearts. Now sitting down at the table they were led to, Ryuichi faced Shizuna once again.\u201cI feel\u2026kinda out of place here.\u201d\u201cI guess so. But as I said before, I\u2019m happy because I have you by my side.\u201d\u201cI see. That makes me happy too.\u201dThen, some fine-looking food was brought in, and Shizuna gave a wry smile at Ryuichi\u2019s excitement as he eyed the delicious-looking dishes, but she truly did seem happy. With a glass of juice in their hands, they clinked their glasses together and made a toast.\u201cOnce again, happy birthday, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cThank you, Ryuichi-kun.\u201dShizuna gave Ryuichi a dazzling smile that he would never forget.Even in a restaurant like this, both Ryuichi and Shizuna were still students and were at the age when they wanted to enjoy the delicious-looking foods on the menu. While they did enjoy the atmosphere, they were more engrossed with their food when push came to shove, which made the time go by quickly.\u201cThat was really good.\u201d\u201cYup. But at the same time, it really makes me wonder again who the heck the manager is.\u201d\u201cFor sure. He\u2019s a man shrouded in many mysteries.\u201dThey nodded to each other, agreeing to ask the manager for the details one day. After they were satisfied with their food, the man who had shown them to their table brought them something, as if it had been arranged beforehand.\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dWhat the man had brought was cake.\u201cWe have prepared this for you as well. Please enjoy.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cThanks a lot.\u201dWhat an extravagant banquet they had enjoyed, from start to finish. Even though their stomachs were pretty full, as the saying went, \u201cPeople have a separate stomach for sweets\u201d, so both Ryuichi and Shizuna ate the cake with relish.Now then, meal time was finally over, but\u2026 This was where the main event of the day was to begin. That being said, Ryuichi didn\u2019t seem to be as nervous as he had been in the morning; apparently, having dinner with Shizuna like this had helped him get back into his usual groove.\u201cShizuna, I have something for you.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dAlthough she had gotten close to finding out about it at one point, there was no way she could\u2019ve known what the gift he had prepared for her was. Seemingly expectant to see her reaction, Ryuichi pulled out a small box from his pocket.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dAnyone who\u2019d ever watched romantic dramas would immediately know what the box was. Shizuna looked at Ryuichi\u2019s face, then at the box repeatedly as if in disbelief.\u201cI know it\u2019s way too early for this, but this gift also serves to show my determination and commitment.\u201dWith a creak, Ryuichi opened the box to reveal a ring with a small gemstone shining on it. Shizuna was struck speechless, with her hand over her mouth. Ryuichi continued.\u201cI want you to stay by my side from now on. I want you to spend not only the present, but also the future next to me. And I want you to let me stay by your side\u2014I love you, Shizuna.\u201d\u201cRyuu\u2026ichi\u2026kun!\u201dHe had wondered if this was too much, too over-the-top for a high school student. However, his desire to make the woman he loved happy was no lie, and Ryuichi had given serious thought about this gift.Tears welled up in Shizuna\u2019s eyes, and reflected in those moist eyes was Ryuichi. The Ryuichi reflected there was, of course, smiling, and more than anything, it reminded her of his smile from that time.\u201cYeah!\u201dIt was the same smile Ryuichi had had when he\u2019d saved her. That smile was one of the reasons she had fallen for him.For both Ryuichi and Shizuna, today was a day of memories they would never forget. Shizuna looked truly blissful as she received the ring from him, and showed her determination to continue loving Ryuichi forever no matter what.\u201cI\u2019m so\u2026so happy!!\u201dShizuna smiled. She looked truly happy and truly overjoyed.That was the smile Ryuichi wanted to see, the smile of his beloved Shizuna that could make even him happy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85The Story of a Man Who Is Reincarnated as the Shittiest Guy in a Doujin, but the Heroine Keeps on Coming Close to HimTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrIt had been a while since Shizuna\u2019s birthday.That day, after receiving the ring from Ryuichi, Shizuna had been in a daze for a long time, as if she was floating around in a dream. She stared intently at the ring, then looked at Ryuichi, looking embarrassed, but then smiled beautifully before looking back at the ring again. She did this several times, but even that appearance of hers looked cute to Ryuichi.\u201cThis is basically a promise of marriage, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re saying I\u2019m the wife and you\u2019re the husband, right, Ryuichi-kun? No take-backs, okay? I definitely, absolutely won\u2019t let you take it back; I will never, ever, ever leave your side now, okay? I\u2019m going to stay with you for the rest of my life, okay?!\u201dShe\u2019d spitted all those words in rapid succession, and it was only natural that Ryuichi nodded his head as if to affirm all of it. Of course, although she never wore the ring to school, it was basically on her finger all the time aside from that.\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m glad she was so happy.\u201dRyuichi muttered to himself as he thought of Shizuna, who was not with him at the moment. It was already late and all he wanted to do was sleep, but Ryuichi currently had two women by his side.\u201cShe sounded so happy as she told me about it on the phone. Nice going, Ryuichi.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Also, I feel really jealous.\u201dThe women who were beside him were Chisa and Satsuki. They were without their clothes and were leaning close to Ryuichi as if to show off their bare bodies to him, and it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine what they had been doing just a few minutes ago.His relationship with Shizuna had further strengthened when he gave her the ring, but he made sure to give Chisa and the other girls their fair share of attention, too.\u201cI mean, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that, though\u2026 Well, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get you two a gift too one of these days.\u201dThat was something Ryuichi had already decided to do. Of course, he was also thinking of a gift for Sakie, which would be a test for Ryuichi\u2019s heart the same way it had been for Shizuna. This was by no means a present he would be giving her just because he had to, but because he sincerely wanted to give her something with the past and future in mind.\u201cYou look really good right now. You look so happy without a single trace of darkness on your face, something I\u2019ve always wanted to see from you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s definitely thanks to you girls. Not just Shizuna, but\u00a0all\u00a0of you, helped me get here.\u201dThat was something he could say with confidence. Chisa and Satsuki were also the catalysts for Ryuichi\u2019s change, and they had taught him the happiness of being kind to someone and the happiness of being loved\u2026 He had said it many times, but it was clear that Ryuichi could not let go of them either.\u201cBut\u2026 I really think what we\u2019re doing is unfair. Normally, this form of love would not be allowed, but Shizuna-chan allows it\u2026 You even tell me not to worry about it too, Ryuichi-kun, so I feel like I\u2019m taking advantage of your kindness.\u201dSatsuki hugged Ryuichi\u2019s arms tightly as she said this. In fact, she was hugging his arm so tightly that her large breasts distorted in shape, which made him wonder just how conflicted she must\u2019ve been. However, just as she said, their current relationship was something neither Ryuichi nor Shizuna minded; they even wanted it, so she had nothing to worry about. Even if it was a form of love that the world did not approve of, it was a form\u00a0they\u00a0agreed on, so there was no need for her to feel any hesitation about it.\u201cRyuichi.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dChisa tapped him on the shoulder, and Ryuichi turned his body toward Satsuki with a wry smile. He firmly put his arm around Satsuki\u2019s back and took her lips in his, so as not to let her get away with her unimportant worries.\u201cHnng\u2026\u201dSatsuki was surprised, but soon she became enamored and started kissing him back, which made Chisa smile.\u201cYou know, Satsuki, even if you\u2019re strangely hung up on it, I think it\u2019s impossible for you at this point to do anything about it, don\u2019t you think? After all, when you want Ryuichi so badly like that, it proves that you can\u2019t stay away from him no matter what, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026right.\u201dWhen she said Satsuki couldn\u2019t stay away from him, that didn\u2019t mean she was dependent on him, but rather, it meant she couldn\u2019t stop loving Ryuichi no matter what obstacles may come in her way. Even though it may not be accepted by the world, Satsuki\u2019s heart had already recognized their relationship now, thanks to Ryuichi and Shizuna\u2019s encouragement and support.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Our relationship is ours and ours alone. So, Satsuki, stay by my side from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeshh. \u266a\u201dEven if a slight uneasiness still remained within her, it all but dissipated with a single word from Ryuichi. Perhaps her emotions were jumbled with joy and excitement, but Satsuki continued to stare at Ryuichi\u2019s profile for a long time after that. Seeing this, Chisa laughed, but admitted that she too, like Satsuki, was unable to part from Ryuichi.\u201cYou\u2019ve really grown into a fine man. I guess even a frivolous playboy playing as a lone wolf can change.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make myself look that way, though\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, that\u2019s how you looked like to others. It\u2019s all the more reason why I\u2019m so happy right now.\u201dChisa gave Ryuichi a kiss on the cheek. After that, they once again spent a time as sweet as honey with each other in bed, and Ryuichi, Chisa, and Satsuki went to sleep satisfied, all cuddled up to each other.And so, in this way, Ryuichi\u2019s days remained the same. His days with Shizuna as well as with Chisa, Satsuki, and Sakie passed by unchanged. These unchanging days were truly happiness, and they were the peaceful days that Ryuichi had been seeking from the bottom of his heart for a long time.\u201cMom, how\u2019s the seasoning on yours?\u201d\u201cAll good. What about you, Shizuna?\u201dOf course, Ryuichi was happy when he had sex with the girls, but even without that, he would not trade the time he spent with them for anything in the world.\u201c\u2026Heh, this definitely isn\u2019t bad.\u201dRyuichi\u2019s gaze fell on Shizuna and Sakie, who were cooking together amicably.Thinking back on it, when he and Shizuna had yet to sleep with each other, he had been surprised to find out that Sakie was Shizuna\u2019s mother when she appeared at the bar. Ryuichi, who rarely ever showed his surprise, had been truly dumbfounded and hadn\u2019t known what to do.\u201cRyuichi-kun?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making an amused smile; is something up?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, well, actually\u2026\u201dWhen he told them what he\u2019d just reminisced on, they too hummed in agreement and laughed greatly, their shoulders shaking.\u201cWhat a coincidence that was. But, that incident did spur on my will and determination, too.\u201d\u201cYou felt a rivalry with me since I was the one who had sex with Ryuichi-kun first\u2026 didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cG-Geez!!\u201dShizuna then confessed that she had wanted to tell him, \u201cHow could you sleep with my mother but not me!\u201d and Ryuichi\u2019s truly noisy yet fun days continued. Such days were made possible not only by Ryuichi\u2019s rebirth as himself, but also by the existence of these women.\u201cThank you, Shizuna\u2026 Sakie, too. I\u2019m so glad I met you two.\u201dSatisfied, Ryuichi slurped down the juice he had in his hand. However, the expression on his face when he thanked them sincerely seemed to stimulate their hearts, and not just Shizuna but Sakie too stopped cooking and walked up to him.\u201cKiss\u2026\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dRyuichi received a kiss on the cheek from both of them. Afterwards, he dug into a delicious meal served by the girls, took a relaxing bath, and then began his sweet time with Shizuna and Sakie.\u201c\u2026Zzz\u2026 Zzz.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ryuichi-kun\u2026 \u266a\u201dSmiling at the sleeping mother and daughter snuggled up together, Ryuichi got up and approached the window.Looking up at the sky, he saw beautiful stars shining in the jet-black night sky, and although it may be a slightly convenient interpretation, it seemed as if they were illuminating his future. Ryuichi did not know what would happen in the future, but he was not anxious about anything. Even if something happened, Ryuichi already had a source of emotional support, and the strength to protect it.\u201cI really don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen. People change when they interact with other people, and they live while supporting and being supported by others.\u201dFor Ryuichi, the past was not forgotten. Even now, there were still times when faces of his parents and grandparents haunted him, but he no longer dwelled on them.Because, for the second time, Ryuichi now had the girls by his side.\u201cHere\u2019s to our future together.\u201dRyuichi muttered those words and returned to the two with a satisfied look on his face.\u201c\u2026But still, this whole thing feels like such a mystical experience.\u201dHis words referred to how he had been reborn as a completely different person\u2014a manga character at that\u2014and taken on a new life.Thinking about what words could explain this sequence of events in a single sentence, Ryuichi suddenly came up with an appropriate string of words and spoke them.\u201c\u2018The Story of a Man Who Is Reincarnated as the Shi*tiest Guy in a Doujin, but the Heroine Keeps on Coming Close to Him\u2019\u2026 That sounds like a title a web novel would have, huh?\u201dHe laughed, but still, that was exactly how he would describe it. Even if one was reborn as the worst kind of man, their life could change in any direction with just one way of thinking. And even if it may not always be an absolute answer like it had been for Ryuichi, it was possible to bring about the future one desired.Let\u2019s hope that he and the girls will have a happy future, for that is the wish of those who have watched over the reborn man and the women who have been involved with him.\uff5eFin\uff5eAfterwordAnd with that, we have finally reached the end of the story!

    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Hot Springs TripTranslated by HamletJrEdited by HamletJrFor Ryuichi, his days with Shizuna and the other girls were truly blissful and fulfilling. Although there was no denying that they were clearly out of step with the rules of the world, the girls and Ryuichi were still enjoying their days of happiness to no end.The days passed by in this way, and finally the day came when Ryuichi promised Shizuna that the two of them would take a trip alone together\u2014to the hot springs, of course.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Ryuichi-kun.\u201d\u201cNo prob. Alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes. \u266a\u201dIt was no longer unusual for the two of them to go out together like this, but for both Ryuichi and Shizuna, no matter what the moment, the time they spent together was irreplaceable.\u201cTake care, you two.\u201dAfter being seen off by Sakie, Ryuichi and Shizuna made their way to the bus stop. The hot spring inn they were going to visit had quite the good reputation, and people often recommended this particular inn if one wanted to go on a trip to the hot springs.Chisa and Satsuki had also wanted to go with them, but they decided not to third-wheel the two this time and backed down.\u201cIt\u2019s still cold, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. Still pretty chilly even though spring break\u2019s about to come to an end. We should try our best not to catch any colds, alright?\u201d\u201cAlright. But, if you do catch a cold, Ryuichi-kun, I\u2019ll nurse you like last time. \u266a\u201d\u201cI wonder what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ryuichi joked with a wry smile. \u201cBut, if that\u2019s how you want to play\u2026\u201d he continued.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be asking for sex too much, then. You know how you get a little zoned out for a while after you hit your peak? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one of the ways you can catch a cold.\u201dWell, since these words were ultimately just to poke fun at her, Ryuichi wouldn\u2019t really refuse having intercourse with her, and he did not intend to hold back if Shizuna asked him to do it or if he wanted to do it himself.Now, what would Shizuna say to Ryuichi\u2019s words? \u2026Up until a little while ago, she would have blushed and cast her gaze downward, but after months of spending time with Ryuichi, she seemed to have naturally developed a certain tolerance for these kinds of topics.\u201cI can\u2019t do that. Having sex with you feels so good and makes me so happy. And, I know that I\u2019m not the only one who feels happy; you do too, Ryuichi-kun. I can tell through the skin-to-skin contact we make. So, I won\u2019t be stopping anytime soon~ \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026Geez.\u201dHe patted Shizuna\u2019s head, thinking that she had really become a good woman. Underneath the sky where the winter chill had yet to completely disappear, it was as if the temperature rose steeply only around the two of them.In the first place, the two of them had recently been like this even at their school, and there were rumors that they would definitely be voted \u2018Best Couple\u2019 next year.\u201cThe hot springs\u2026 We\u00a0have\u00a0to try the mixed bathing facilities there.\u201d\u201cFor sure. But I\u2019ve read in guidebooks that it\u2019s by reservation only. If someone\u2019s already made a reservation in advance, we\u2019ll have to give up.\u201d\u201cMuu\u2026 If that happens, let\u2019s just make out in the bathtub in our room.\u201d\u201cI mean, that\u2019s just gonna be too cramped\u2026\u201dLately Shizuna had been expressing her love for Ryuichi in a truly non-stop manner. Of course, Ryuichi did not dislike this, and in fact, it was one of his great joys to be desired by the woman he loved.However\u2026since she\u2019d been influenced in no small part by Chisa and Sakie, there was no doubt that Shizuna becoming like this was, in a sense, expected and even inevitable.\u201cAh, it\u2019s here.\u201dThe next few hours or so were likely to be tedious, as they would be traveling by bus. Sitting side by side in the quiet bus with few passengers, the two of them slowly waited for them to arrive at their destination.\u201cI have some snacks with me. Here you go.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dRyuichi popped the chocolate candy offered to him into his mouth. It seemed that Shizuna had prepared a variety of sweets for the trip, and it felt like they were having a children\u2019s picnic.Shizuna put a long biscuit stick into her mouth and held it out toward Ryuichi, who responded by putting the other end of the stick in his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u266a\u266a\u201dRyuichi proceeded to take bite after bite of the snack as he slowly approached Shizuna, who seemed to be showing her joy with her whole body. Incidentally, although there were few passengers on the bus, that didn\u2019t mean there were\u00a0none.In other words, their passionate flirting session was visible to the people seated next to them across the aisle, and two high school-aged girls were blatantly watching them with curiosity.\u2026Alright, guess I\u2019ll go with the usual.Asking for a pocky game like this was nothing more than her indirectly asking for a kiss. So, the moment there was only little left of the stick, Ryuichi went ahead and reduced the distance between him and Shizuna to zero.\u201cMmm?!\u201dHe suppressed his desire to tell the surprised Shizuna not to get too engrossed, and placed his hand firmly behind her head so that she could not escape. Shizuna\u2019s eyes grew more and more intoxicated, almost as if heart marks would appear in her eyes at any moment, and Ryuichi pulled his face away just as her switch was about to flip on.\u201cThe rest\u2019ll have to wait until the inn, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201dBut still, it was going to be a long journey. Needless to say, the two of them had made out enough to let everyone around them know they were lovers, even without kissing or body touching.And then, finally, after a few hours of turbulent shaking, they arrived at the hot spring inn they were looking for. Like the surrounding scenery, the inn seemed to be well cared for and had a really beautiful gate, which impressed not only Ryuichi and Shizuna, but also the other travelers.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThey entered and first told the receptionist that they had made a reservation for two people. While Shizuna was talking with the receptionist about various matters, Ryuichi looked around and saw four people who piqued his interest. There was one man walking with three beautiful women by his side, and they were such beautiful women that they stimulated a man\u2019s instincts because of their figure.\u2026That guy\u2019s a pretty smooth player, huh.However, because Ryuichi himself had relationships with several women, he could clearly understand the kind of relationship between those four.They were indeed beautiful women who made him want to take them to bed, but Ryuichi had absolutely no intention of doing anything like that now\u2014that was just how fulfilled he was with Shizuna and the others.\u201cShizuna, I\u2019mma head to the toilet for a bit.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dRyuichi called out to Shizuna before he headed for the restroom. After finishing his business, he was on his way back to Shizuna, deep in thought on how he was going to spend the rest of the trip with Shizuna. Then he bumped into someone.\u201cWatch it, dammit.\u201dHe\u2019d inadvertently uttered those words on the spur of the moment. They both hadn\u2019t been paying attention, so neither of them could really be faulted for this since they were both in the wrong.\u2026Crap. I\u2019ve got to apologize.Nevertheless, thinking that he might have frightened them for the words that he\u2019d uttered on the spur of the moment, Ryuichi immediately turned around, thinking that he had to apologize. However, the person he had bumped into had already walked away, and Ryuichi lost the opportunity to call out to them.\u201c\u2026Haaah, I hope they don\u2019t mind it too much.\u201dWith a sigh, Ryuichi returned to Shizuna, but for some reason he found her drooping her head.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I told her that the mixed bathing facilities were already fully-booked, and this is what happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dA disaster for sure,\u00a0Ryuichi thought, deciding to console Shizuna later. However, Ryuichi had also been looking forward to taking a mixed bath with Shizuna, so although he was disappointed, he put his hand on Shizuna\u2019s shoulder and said that it could not be helped.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. There\u2019s more to this place than just the mixed bathing.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026 Alright, now that it\u2019s come to this, we\u2019re going to have more fun with the other things this place has to offer!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d Ryuichi said as he smiled.The two of them had not yet decided what they would do on their trip, so that would be the first step. However, both Ryuichi and Shizuna were confident that whatever they did would be a pleasant memory, perhaps because they had the one they loved by their side.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I mean, I don\u2019t like this kind of interaction though. More than anything else, I\u2019m fine as long as I\u2019m with you.][\u2026Ryuichi-kun\u266a]Ryuichi is also Ryuichi after all, he is very sweet to Shizuna. However for Shizuna, just by receiving Ryuichi\u2019s kindness, it makes her face aroused like a woman immediately.It\u2019s because Shizuna has strong feelings for Ryuichi because she likes him too much\u2026 And in a way, it makes anyone wonder if she\u2019s been made to be Ryuichi\u2019s woman from beginning to end\u2014Of course, it wasn\u2019t forced, it was Shizuna\u2019s wish, so it wasn\u2019t a mistake that this was the form of happiness for them.[Let\u2019s go sightseeing leisurely. It\u2019s a long-awaited trip after all.][Okay\u2026 Hmm, I\u2019m curious about that direction?]With that in mind, Ryuichi and Shizuna began to move forward together in order to enjoy their trip from the bottom of their hearts.=========As a result of spending time sightseeing during the day, it seems that both of them were unexpectedly exhausted.It was disappointing that the mixed bathing was already fully booked, but it might have been better not to have mixed bathing when you were exhausted.After bathing separately in the large public baths, they went to savor dishes made with plenty of local delicacies.[It\u2019s delicious.][Yeah, it\u2019s really delicious.]Shizuna took a picture of the food with her smartphone and probably sent it to Sakie and Chisa.When she boasted about it, she seemed to be a little enthusiastic. However, she also showed a glimpse of how she felt lonely when both of them were in this place. That kind of Shizuna\u2019s appearance is so adorable and Ryuichi couldn\u2019t help but love it.(\u2026I want to hold her)Maybe that\u2019s why the man\u2019s instinct wants Shizuna\u2019s body.Although he had slept with Shizuna many times until now, the difference in the atmosphere seemed to stimulate even Ryuichi\u2019s heart, and Ryuichi uncharacteristically gave Shizuna a passionate look.After dinner was finished and all the tableware was put away\u2026 Ryuichi and Shizuna hugged each other on top of the two futons and exchanged a fierce kiss.[I was a little surprised for a moment. It\u2019s suddenly more intense than usual.][I\u2019m sorry. I may be more excited than usual today.]Ryuichi\u2019s face was exactly like that of a wild beast.From an ordinary person\u2019s point of view\u2026it can\u2019t be helped that she would feel scared if someone stared at her like that\u2026but Shizuna didn\u2019t have any fear at all, she had glimmers of anticipation of what he will do hereafter.Shizuna simply continued to stare at Ryuichi, as if a heart mark was floating in her wet eyes\u2026and then unexpectedly provoked him.[What will you do? Ryuichi-kun has been too kind lately and it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s been violent to me\u2026I wonder if it\u2019s okay for me to have high expectations?][\u2026I see.]Even Ryuuichi knew that Shizuna\u2019s words were to incite him.Ryuichi licked her lips with his tongue, while one of his hands was on Shizuna\u2019s breast and the other on her lower body\u2026when touching them, Ryuichi grinned and asked Shizuna.[It wasn\u2019t because we kissed\u2026 It\u2019s been a long time, hasn\u2019t it? Hey Shizuna, you\u2019ve become a pervert too.][Uu\u2026you made me like this! You\u2019re the one who made me into a pervert!][Kuku, certainly. But, I also love that kind of Shizuna too.][\u2026that\u2019s why you\u2019re always unfair\u2026every time you say something kind to me, it makes me happy.]Shizuna said that with a red face, and Ryuichi decided to remove his limiter for the first time in a long time.Well, it\u2019s partly because Shizuna\u2019s nature is quite a masochist.[I\u2019m going to be a little more intense today, Shizuna\u2014don\u2019t break, okay?][\u2026Please break me as much as you want, Ryuichi-kun\u2026 come here\u2661]With that, the two of them came to strongly overlap their bodies.After a certain amount of time had passed, Ryuichi drank orange juice as if to rehydrate.[Puhaa!]The coldness permeates the entire body and cools down his burning body.When Ryuichi turned his gaze, Shizuna was lying down with a sloppy expression, and she occasionally saw her body jolted and trembling\u2026he reflected on whether he had gone a little too far on her.[Ryuu\u2026ichi-kuun\u2026 \u266a\u266a]That being said, Ryuichi laughed as he seemed happy.Well, the end of the first day of the trip somehow ended in their own way\u2026 but it goes without saying that both Ryuichi and Shizuna were happy anyway.A happy moment after overcoming many things\u2026Ryuichi, who has eyes as sharp as a lion\u2019s, now has a kind and soft look.[Have I mellowed down\u2026? Well, it\u2019s already too late anyway?]If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s definitely the girls, including Shizuna, who have changed me.Well, he\u2019s become kinder, but there\u2019s still a ferocious side and a mischievous side\u2014\u2014 Ryuichi approached Shizuna and took a picture of her with her tongue sticking out.[What\u2026are you doing\u2026?]Ryuichi smiled wryly, saying that of course, he had taken a picture of the cute Shizuna.The next day, when he showed it to Shizuna, it was inevitable that she would get very angry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
