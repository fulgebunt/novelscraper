This youth was Mo Fan, the one who only got a single-digit score on the exam.\u201cMo Fan, you should learn from Mu Bai. He was able to score 96 despite the exam being this hard. How could you only get a single digit score on the exams? Don\u2019t sully your own name,\u201d Deng Yongchuan sighed.How could such a troublesome student be in my class? When he first entered the school, his grades were top notch. However\u2014after entering high school\u2014his grades quickly fell, and with his exam scores being such a tragic sight, it caused the class average to drop as well.\u201cTeacher, he doesn\u2019t even live up to his name: Mo Fan. Mo Fan\u2026 he\u2019s not average at all! He\u2019s levels lower than average\u2014he\u2019s practically a dreg. 1\u201d the student called Mu Bai called.\u201cHahaha\u201d\u201cHe really is!\u201d\u201cMu Bai truly lives up to his reputation, he can insult people without swearing. Mo Fan is indeed not average, he has already become trash!\u201dThe entire class began to laugh and it wasn\u2019t until Deng Yongchuan began his lecture that they finally stopped.\u2026..\u201cThis Mu Bai makes me sick. He thinks he\u2019s amazing just because he\u2019s handsome, has good grades, and knows how to play musical instruments!\u201d The person who sits next to Mo Fan\u2014Guan Gu\u2014said.\u201cHe\u2019s just a childish ****.\u201d Mo Fan said with disdain.\u201cDo you want to play volleyball when the school ends?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t go, I\u2019ve got stuff to do.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to help Old Man Ying again? After all, you\u2019re the only one who dares to go to the thatched cottage behind the mountains. Oh right, I got me some Xuanhuan and Mohuan novels, do you want me to lend one to you?\u201d\u201cYou can put it in my bag, however, you should read less novels. You\u2019re addicted.\u201d Mo Fan said.\u2026To a student, the most beautiful bell sound is naturally the one signaling the end of class. After the end of an entire day filled with dull classes, Mo Fan yawned as he carried his bag while walking to the back of the mountain.The back of the mountain was the back entrance of the academy; basically, no one actually used it.Old Man Ying who Guan Gu mentioned was the guard of the academy\u2019s back mountain. In order to ensure the safety of the students\u2014and prevent students from sneaking out to internet cafes\u2014the school had appointed Old Man Ying as the keeper of the back entrance.Old Man Ying had no relatives nor friends. When he had passed away, there were no questions asked about him; thus, the school carelessly buried him.Mo Fan and Old Man Ying were quite familiar with each other. Before the old man passed away, he had also left some stuff for Mo Fan. He only remembered the old man\u2019s good intentions today, hence he decided to take a look at the thatched cottage.Old Man Ying had always said that he was the descendent of some historical big-shot, so he was in possession of a five thousand year old antique ring.Mo Fan have seen that ring before; it was completely pitch black, and didn\u2019t look like some antique. However, the most important thing was that he had brought it to an appraiser to get appraised; the owner had thrown Mo Fan out while questioning how he could have the face to say that this copper ring\u2014smelted from a charcoal stove\u2014was an \u201cantique\u201d. Ever since then, Mo Fan stopped believing in Old Man Ying\u2019s bragging.Mo Fan wanted to take the things Old Man Ying had left behind as something to remember him by.Old Man Ying was a magnanimous gatekeeper; he was very indifferent toward the topics of life and death. Mo Fan wished for him to pass away in peace. Death was not the end of everything, perhaps you can start your life over somewhere else?\u201cWould you believe me if I said that in this plane that holds science in high regards, there is another parallel plane that practises magic? In that plane, you don\u2019t study science, but magic\u2026.\u201dThis was the kind of crazy talk that Old Man Ying would always tell Mo Fan, which was why Mo Fan firmly believed that when he passed away, Old Man Ying had gone to a different plane to restart his life\u2014and live a more extravagant one while he was at it.The ring was easily found within the wooden box under his bamboo bed.As Mo Fan opened it, he felt a faint obscure aura emanating from the box\u2014it did indeed feel quite mysterious. However, Mo Fan is fifteen-sixteen years old, he didn\u2019t believe that there would be something like a cultivation technique in this world. He definitely did not believe the recluse who said that if Mo Fan wore this ring, and practised this cultivation technique, he would be able to save the universe.The pitch-black ring was an ordinary looking ring. If one wanted to know the most peculiar thing about the ring, it would be that the interior had eight very small holes\u2014which any artisan was able to make.The moment Mo Fan put it on, he felt a heart-freezing chill. This thing that made him shake in the heat of summer was quite strange.\u201cStrange my ass.\u201d As Mo Fan thought this over, he denied the idea in his head.Mo Fan was struck with a sudden sleepiness, but he still had to work that night. Thus, he arranged the the bamboo mat and laid down inside the house to sleep first. At 10 PM, he would have to go to the 24/7 supermarket to be a clerk, and he would work till 6 in the morning\u2026\u2026He was extremely sleepy, thus he fell asleep very quickly.A sliver of blood-red light shone through the mountain cracks from the setting sun, dying the forest behind the mountains and the small, thatched cottage red with it\u2019s glow.It was like a colossal door in the dark that was slowly closing. The radiating light in the darkness was slowly being sucked inside the door. As the sunset completely disappeared beneath the mountains and as dusk came to rule the world, the back of the mountain seemed as though it was covered with a misty layer of a bizarre color.From far away, this area seemed like it continued into nothingness. Beneath the blood sun was an indistinct scene around the water, like a mirage!The youth sleeping inside the thatched cottage was still snoring, little did he know that the ring on his finger was emitting an ear-piercing humming sound. It was as if it was reacting to the reflection of the mirage that revealed the world\u2019s true calling.\u201cBum~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201dAs it trembled, so did the entire space!Shui Nan Middle School was located in Nanshan in the city. Nanshan was much taller than the rest of Xia City.The city was already brightly lit up; the streets, shops, buildings, the Grand City of Xia was radiating a magnificent brilliance. Old people who were taking walks after dinner, older ladies who were dancing in the public squares, the children who chased each other in the small valleys, and lovers who were having dates in the park\u2026.The evening didn\u2019t leave people with any insecurity or fear. On the contrary, they were actually enjoying getting off classes for the day, getting off work, and relaxing after dinner. However, if one were to look closely toward the location of Shui Nan Middle School\u2014the south side of the mountain\u2014they would have discovered that the campus that should have been shining bright had been shrouded in a muddled layer.This space was originally peaceful like the water\u2019s surface, but at this moment, a Spatial Tunnel appeared\u2014spiralling like it was being devoured\u2014causing it to be increasingly fierce, although silent!On one side was a peaceful city with glorious lights!On the other was half a mountain swallowed by the black spiral!The northern city that had just entered its summer eve became an incomparably astonishing scene!The entire space-time had changed, and the cause of it was this tunnel that was unexplainable in scientific terms.The center of the Spatial Tunnel was the thatched cottage behind the mountains.The colossal whirlpool suddenly diffused followed by it vanishing into nothingness. It was as if nothing had happened at all.A certain person who was still sleeping soundly had no idea about the colossal changes to the world, that he had fallen into a parallel world.\u2026\u2026The empty mountain experienced a sudden rain, which gave the scorching summer day a fierce cold punch, suppressing the overwhelming heat.The air in the morning was particularly good, and the warm meat-buns by the school gates released an alluring smell. The dazzling golden youtiao gave a mouth-watering scent.\u201cSeventh Uncle, I\u2019d like some soymilk and youtiao.\u201d A youth with a messy appearance sat down on the stool as he said this to the old man who sold youtiao.\u201cComing.\u201d The old youtiao man swiftly served the soymilk, purposely filling up the cup as a smiled radiated across his face, \u201cMo Fan, you are about to take the magic exams, you should put some effort and strive to get into the University of Magicians so you can bring our Clan some face.\u201dMo Fan blankly stared at the Seventh Uncle who was selling breakfast by the school gates. He carefully thought to himself and reckoned that he probably misheard, thus he nodded as he ate.Yesterday, he slept so much that his head felt dizzy; he felt as though he had dreamt about a journey that took several centuries. When he woke up, he felt like a lifetime had passed; he didn\u2019t know where east, south, west, and north were, nor whether it was morning or noon.Mo Fan wolfed down his food, his hand holding half of the youtiao. As he was about to bite into the youtiao, he suddenly felt something heavy at his side. A half-bald man in his thirtys sat down next to him, his body reeking of cigarettes.\u201cMo Fan, eating breakfast, eh?\u201d The bald man smiled as he greeted Mo Fan.\u201cGood morning, Superintendent Hu.\u201d Mo Fan hastily smiled as he greeted him back.This man was the prominent Superintendent Hu, he wore a suit that didn\u2019t suit him every day and his forehead shone brightly.\u201cI\u2019m not wearing my watch, what time is it?\u201d Superintendent Hu asked, exposing his yellow teeth.Mo Fan took out his broken Nokia to look, \u201cStill another fifteen minutes before the bell rings.\u201d\u201cCrap, I\u2019m late. I still haven\u2019t finished my Magic Theory PPT\u2014I don\u2019t have time to finish my breakfast\u2026\u201d As Superintendent Hu stood up all of a sudden, Mo Fan suddenly tilted over.\u201cBoss, I don\u2019t need the soymilk\u2026.Walking to the office is far too slow\u2014whatever\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if I use some magic.\u201d Superintendent Hu stood there talking to himself.Mo Fan was very puzzled, he felt like Superintendent Hu was speaking in an alien language.Just as he thought he heard wrong, the soymilk shop\u2019s canopy turned over in a incomparably strange way. It was as though compressed air had bubbled forth from within the soymilk shop\u2026As the evil wind came by, it messed up Mo Fan\u2019s hair and rustled his clothes.\u201cWind Trail, Fast Stride!\u201dAs Superintendent Hu suddenly muttered to himself, his misfitted suit began to move on his body in an indescribable way\u2014it was as if there was a gale inside his clothes.His tie fluttered, and his trousers began oscillating. How could there be wind on a calm morning such as this, and it ruthlessly blow toward Superintendent Hu?\u201cSssssh~~~~\u201dAn azure light flashed. Mo Fan could see an indistinct thread of a beautiful starlight moving to surround Superintendent Hu\u2019s whole body. The starlight flashed as it moved.\u201cStudent Mo Fan, teacher will leave first. Do your best in studying!\u201d Superintendent Hu turned around and exposed his yellow-toothed smile to Mo Fan.Mo Fan seemed a bit taken back. Before he could come back to his senses, he heard a \u201cswoosh\u201d sound!The slightly plump, bald Superintendent Hu\u2014with the suit that seemed out of place\u2014followed the dust trajectory from the swirling wind and hastily made his way toward the school!His stride was exceptionally quick. The students wearing their student uniforms seemed immobile, which let Superintendent Hu travel in high speed through them, leaving behind a shocking dust trail\u2026During this short period of time, Mo Fan felt like the Superintendent\u2019s face was still in front of him. However\u2014at this moment\u2014Superintendent Hu had already disappeared into the depths of the school, and he was no longer able to see his shadow.The words \u201cDo your best in studying!\u201d still resonated in his ears; however, the person was already gone without a trace. He was chewing on half the youtiao. As the chewing came to a stop, the other youtiao slid from Mo Fan\u2019s hands!Superintendent Hu, are you the successor of Duan Yu, using his ultimate technique of Ripple Tiny Steps???2\u2026\u201cThis is just an illusion, this is definitely just an illusion.\u201d Mo Fan rubbed his eyes after a long while.It must be because I didn\u2019t sleep well last night. It must\u2019ve pressured my cranial nerves or something, how else am I imagining this kind of scene?Let\u2019s finish this breakfast quickly and go back to the classroom to get some more sleep. Heavens, what is this? A bald and prominent Superintendent who can use Ripple Tiny Step?After arriving at the classroom, he lay down onto the desk immediately without saying anything, so he could mitigate the illusion he had seen before.From the front of his desk came the two small voices of the student representatives, one said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one month left, what do I do if I don\u2019t get into a good high school?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really smart though, I\u2019m sure you can enter the Tian Lan Magic High School.\u201d\u201cWhat, you\u2019re the smart one. Your grades for theory classes are so high, I could practically pull out any Magical Beast and you would recognize them and their weaknesses.\u201dMo Fan creased his eyebrows, this wasn\u2019t his first time hearing this whole concept of magic.What happened? Is it possible that I\u2019m having another illusion?I don\u2019t take drugs nor do I smoke!Forget it, it must be because I haven\u2019t had a proper sleep.Mo Fan ignored the crazy talk of the two lads in front of him and quickly entered a deep state of sleep.Mo Fan\u2019s many years of experience in studying gave him a superior ability to fall asleep on his desk in just a single second.\u201cStudents, open your textbooks. Today, we will continue to learn about Magic Release\u2019s preliminary requirements. Do you still remember what I told you before? To complete Primary rank magic, you have to first make the stars in your Magic Stardust link to each other. By doing this, you will be able to form a Star Path and then utilize the power of Magic. I have already explained this theory to you many times before, while at same time, this is also the most important part of the exam,\u201d the Math teacher\u2014Su Qingzhi\u2014said as he maintained his intonation.In the past, Mo Fan could enter a state of deep sleep as he followed the voice of the teacher. However, as he once again heard \u2018Magic Release\u201d and \u201cStar\u201d, he was immediately woken up.\u201cMo Fan, you better listen in class. There\u2019s less than a month\u2019s time, yet you\u2019re still neglecting yourself!\u201d Su Qingzhi saw Mo Fan and immediately reprimanded him.The classmates also turned their heads around and quietly laughed to themselves. Laughing at the trash had already become their favorite thing to do in class.\u201cOpen your textbook.\u201d Su Qingzhi said in continuation.Mo Fan felt helpless as he opened up his textbook\u2026.\u201cShit, what is this??\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help himself from swearing.The pictures, functions, and formulas that were contained in the math book were all gone. Instead, there was a \u201cStar Path\u201d which he didn\u2019t understand at all, the picture of the Star had something that looked like a connecting line with streaking meteors. It looked like\u2026. like\u2026 just like a f**king Magic Formation!Mo Fan forcefully suppressed the astonishment in his heart, and then came to another realization.When the math teacher stopped observing him, Mo Fan kicked his seatmate, Guan Gu, below the table and said, \u201cAre you messing with me? What the heck did you switch out my book for, hurry up and give me back my math book.\u201d\u201cBig brother, what math book are you talking about?\u201d The tanned faced Guan Gu felt wronged\u2014 he didn\u2019t try to provoke anyone.\u201cCome take a look at this crap. Hurry up and give me my book back.\u201d Mo Fan opened up his book and pointed at the strange Star Path, Magic symbols, and the odd incantations.\u201cBig Brother Mo Fan, this is the Magic book for this class. What\u2019s Math? Did you stay up all night again reading Science novels? You\u2019re even saying I\u2019m reading so much that it\u2019s like I am possessed\u2014you\u2019re the same as me.\u201d Guan Gu said.As Mo Fan heard Guan Gu\u2019s retort, his chin almost couldn\u2019t help but drop down to the floor.What is this, and what now?\u201cStop bullshitting me.\u201d Mo Fan said in anger. This brat sure is good at acting, the real question is whether I\u2019m gonna believe you like a madman.\u201cBoss, the novels have actually caused you to go mad. We are in the magic world alright, how could we possibly have something as incredible and mysterious as Math. If there really was, then I wouldn\u2019t be spending everyday studying something as boring as Magic Theory, Elemental Systems, or Magical Beasts. I would have studied Mathematics, Literature, and all these interesting things a long time ago.\u201d Guan Gu said\u2014with a sincere expression and a heartfelt tone\u2014to Mo Fan.As Mo Fa looked at Guan Gu\u2019s expression, he thought to himself, This bastard actually did not even reveal a little bit of a mistake as he said this crazy stuff. It really seemed like it was real.My seatmate has gone mad, not only has he gone mad, but he\u2019s even trying to turn me into a madman!Learning something as boring as Magic Theory, Elemental Systems and Magical Beasts\u2026.Hehe! It\u2019s impressive you can even say that out loud!\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then just listen to what the teacher is saying.\u201d Guan Gu said indifferently as he saw Mo Fan\u2019s peculiar expression.As Mo Fan heard this, he finally carefully listened to what the math teacher, Su Qingzhi, was saying. However, one part was like an alien language\u2014there were terms which Mo Fan had no idea about\u2014 which caused him to feel unwell.Su Qingzhi didn\u2019t mention the familiar \u2018Functions\u2019 nor \u2018Formulas\u2019 at all. On the contrary, he had said the words \u2018Star Path\u2019 and \u2018Star Diagram\u2019 numerous times, he even mentioned things like \u2018Fire- Ice- Water Elements\u2019.\u201cCrazy\u2014they\u2019ve all gone crazy.\u201dMo Fan\u2019s belief was solemn, he would not believe these words.The next class was with his favorite Literature teacher: Mrs Qin. Beautiful, sexy, mature, gentle, big and perky boobs, her very round buttocks won\u2019t use this kind of nonsense to deceive me.\u2026After going through the incomprehensible math class, Mrs Qin\u2014with her slender body and formal black dress\u2014walked into the classroom.Just like before, she gave a slight smile that illuminated the entire classroom. The boys of the class became like kindergarteners; excitement filled their faces as they greeted the teacher.\u201cStudents, today we will be discussing the pros and cons of black magic. Everyone should already know that black magic is divided into three different types; Spectre Type, Curse Type, and Shadow Type. Then, what\u2019s the difference in these three types of Magic?\u201d Mrs Qin said with a gentle and elegant voice.In the past, Mo Fan would have been able to attentively look and listen. However, after hearing these words, his expression made it seem as though he had eaten a housefly.While the crazy seatmate to the side of him made a \u201cSee, what did I tell you?\u201d kind of expression.Shit, you\u2019re not wrong, then your father, I, must be sick!Impossible!Mo Fan finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and quickly slid off his chair and stood up.\u201cMrs Qin, aren\u2019t we supposed to have Literature class?\u201d Mo Fan asked.As his seatmate Guan Gu realized what Mo Fan was going to stand up and ask, he tried to pull him away but failed to do so. After hearing what Mo Fan had asked, he facepalmed himself while saying \u201cOh mai gah\u201d.As the words were said, a roar of laughter arose within the quiet classroom.The whole class, consisting of forty students, were swaying with laughter. Especially Mu Bai\u2014he laughed so much that he began to tear up.Mrs Qin did not laugh. She pushed her glasses with gold traces to the side while maintaining a slight smile. Her clear cat-like eyes looked at Mo Fan as she earnestly said, \u201cMo Fan, this literature you\u2019re talking about is Science, right? Science doesn\u2019t exist here; you must have immersed yourself in those non-existent things instead of earnestly studying magic. You have to become an useful Mage for society, alright?\u201dOne could imagine the Literature teacher was very sincere. When such earnest words were being spoken out loud, one could imagine the expression of a certain youth changing greatly.God, please kill me already!!\u2026Eh, hold on. How come the words Mrs Qin just said was exactly the same as what the already passed, Old Man Ying, had said?Is it possible that there really is a magic plane? And I have actually been dropped right into the magic plane?\u2026\u2026Mo Fan had originally thought that this was all just a dream; however, the following few days were exactly the same.While at same time, his clear conscious had also been telling him that this was definitely not a dream.On the morning of the fourth day, he was once again sitting at Uncle Seven\u2019s place eating youtiao, while feeling conflicted.The two male students next to him were discussing Magical Tools. Mo Fan was unclear on what kind of things these Magical Tools were, however, listening to the way they spoke about it, it seemed to be something incredible. Not only that, it also sounded expensive, roughly about the same price as a car.\u201cMo Fan, why do you seem so down? How about I\u2014your Uncle\u2014buy you something to energize you? The exams are coming up, whether you are able to become a Mage depends on this exam\u2026 \u201d The youtiao vendor, Uncle Seven, said with concern.Mo Fan automatically assumed what Uncle Seven had said was related to his grades in school.\u201cHuhuhu~~~~~~~\u201dA bizarre wind blew onto the small vendor. It swirled some dust onto Mo Fan\u2019s soymilk, thus, he quickly poured it down his throat. His entire being looked dispirited.The wind got stronger and stronger and Mo Fan felt a strange pressure slowly spiralling down on him.The grass was was swaying wildly and the dirt particles were flying everywhere. The girls covered and held their skirts down as they let out astonished cries.Mo Fan had gotten used to it. It was that teacher again using the \u201cWind Trail\u201d magic to stride, and there was more activity among the people this time.\u201cWhat\u2026what in the heavens, what is that??\u201d\u201cOh crap, that\u2019s so cool!\u201d\u201cWings, that person actually has wings behind him. It\u2019s exactly the same as the video in Super Kugen!\u201d\u201cWind Wings, dear lords, I have actually seen the high-level Wind Element magic \u2018Wind Wings\u2019 with my owns eyes!\u201dMo Fan was unable to eat his breakfast peacefully with the surroundings being this noisy.Mo Fan assumed a calm face as he raised his head, however, in the next moment, it was as if his entire being sustained a lightning shock as he stood there. His drowsy eyes widened all of a sudden, unable to move away from what he was seeing!Against a bright blue sky, at the corner of a rooftop, by the swaying trees, and the fluttering flag of the school\u2026.This man who was wearing a silver gown looked like a spirit from a dream; he flew past these exceedingly remote locations and streaked across the sky in a breathtaking arc!Mo Fan sat in the back row in the classroom, so when he was bored he tended to stare at the cloud, the sky, the trees, the flagpole, and the birds who are flying free in the sky. However, he never thought that there would actually be people who would have illusory wings to swoop past him for an unimaginable visual impact.This should be something that only exists in movies, but now it has actually appeared in front of his own eyes!!\u201cWind\u2026..wind\u2026.wind wings!\u201d Mo Fan stared at the silver man with wings in the sky as he mouthed the magic name out loud.Unlike the time he witnessed the Wind Trail, Mo Fan could feel something moving fiercely within his heart; this was him breaking out of the shell of his original mindset, giving birth to a thirst.That\u2019s right, in the past few days, he was unable to accept the changes to everything. Only now did he suddenly realize the great changes, and contrary to one\u2019s expectations, it made his heart race violently. It was as though he fell in love with someone at first sight!After the shock from the silver man flying by had passed, Mo Fan had already stated to himself within his heart: Even if this is a dream, I\u2019ll still learn Wind Wings and hover across the horizon freely before I wake up!\u2026The time that Mo Fan had at hand was very short.If he were to look at things from the perspective of his former world, nine years worth of mandatory graduation testing was happening in twenty days.In the remaining twenty days, all Mo Fan did was confirm some crucial points:The courses were divided into:Magic Foundation Theory \u2013 based on the setup of the subject, it seems to be LiteratureMagic Star Path \u2013 should be geometryMagical Beast Knowledge \u2013 should be biologyMagical Tools and Devices Knowledge \u2013 should be physicsMaterials Knowledge \u2013 should be chemistryMagic History and Magic Geography should be self explanatory.Naturally, Mo Fan also understood one very important piece of information.Basically, there were no students who could release magic yet. This was because what the students had studied during the nine years compulsory education were general theories, concepts, and abilities.This was actually the same as Junior High School graduates in the former world\u2014no survival skills whatsoever.To Mo Fan, this is definitely good news. After all, this world of magic was completely alien to him\u2014he practically had to relearn everything.The most crucial point to become a Mage as a Magic student was the \u201cMagic Awakening\u201d.The \u201cMagic Awakening\u201d was similar to an opening ceremony. During the opening ceremony of Magic High School, every magic students were to receive their one-time \u201cMagic Baptism\u201d which was the Magic Awakening!Different people awakened different elements. Mo Fan had heard from Guan Gu that the awakened elements were mostly chemical elements. These were the ones you usually learn in class: Wind Element, Fire Element, Water Element, Light Element, Lightning Element, Ice Element, and Earth Element.The ones Mo Fan had witnessed before,\u201dWind Trail\u201dand\u201dWind Wings\u201dwere divided into low rank magic and high rank magic. If the people who awakened the Wind Element were to strive hard, then it was possible that they could learn this magic.\u2026Thus, if one wanted to become like the Mage who could fly, then the first thing one needed to do was to get admitted into high school and receive what every high school magic students got\u2014\u2014the Magic Awakening!\u2026\u201cMo Fan, don\u2019t tell me you actually want to take the exams for Magic High School, and become a Mage?\u201d Guan Gu asked sincerely.In Guan Gu\u2019s opinion, Mo Fan never struck him as a person who loved studying, but suddenly he seemed to be genuinely studying magic. This was an atrocious matter.Mo Fan was too lazy to explain to his classmate. However, he had already decided that he would definitely be admitted into the Magic High School and obtain the extremely precious opportunity to awaken.\u201cEven if you were to study now, it\u2019d be useless. You should just stop wasting the time, after all, you\u2019ve missed several years of homework.\u201d Guan Gu said in persuasion.Guan Gu was very clear on the fact that Mo Fan only got six points on the last Magic mock exam\u2014the lowest of the entire year group. How could he get admitted with this kind of grade?\u201cYou\u2019ve already messed up, there\u2019s no use to put in effort now, just accept it.\u201d\u201cGuan Gu, you should be the one to study more.\u201dHaving Guan Gu chattering in his ears made Mo Fan feel somewhat irritated.\u201cWhy?\u201d Guan Gu asked.\u201cGuan Gu, did you know that you look ugly?\u201d\u201cI did,\u201d Guan Gu admitted with a sincere face.\u201cYeah, then there\u2019s a saying that you should know: If one is ugly then one should have more\u2026.hiccups, if one is ugly then one should learn Magic!\u201d Mo Fan said these heartfelt words with sincerity.\u201cF**k off mate!\u201dGuan Gu wasn\u2019t wrong, however. There was only twenty something days left, even if one was a genius, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to compensate for all the classes from years past. Additionally, the content of the exams and what was learned were two different concepts.Mo Fan knew that he didn\u2019t have much hope left, but the reason for him cramming was not because of exams. It was because he was genuinely moved by Magic, causing him to feel an intense desire to study.\u2026\u2026The time passed quickly, twenty or so days flew past in a flash.Mo Fan did not wake up from his so-called Magic Dream, instead, he began to believe in the real existence of this world. Furthermore, he welcomed the Junior High Exam which had turned into the Magic Junior High Exam.On the day of the exams, the people outside of the school were filled with worry. It didn\u2019t matter whether they were having exams on Magic, or Science, the parents of children were still coming to pick them up; those who drove cars came in cars and those who drove pedicab came in pedicabs. This was because the parents were very clear on the fact that the exams this time were going to decide whether their children would come in cars to pick up the next generation, or in pedicabs.As Mo Fan walked out of the exam room, he saw the endless streams of people, and in his heart he thought, \u201cWhy are there cars and electric scooters in a Magic World?\u201d He walked out as he was puzzled over this, but his thoughts quickly returned back to the contents of the exams.After twenty or so days of studying hard, Mo Fan have finally reached the level where he can understand the subjects of the exams. However, whether the answer was correct or not\u2014\u2014 Sigh, as long as I am happy.\u201cMo Fan, Mo Fan\u2026..\u201d Among the crowd, a yellow-faced middle-aged man looked toward Mo Fan with his left hand raised above his head.As Mo Fan saw this familiar face, he accidentally called out, \u201cFather, why did you come here?\u201d\u201cTo pick you up of course. After you\u2019ve finished your exams, you have basically graduated. I found you a job in the next city district as a construction worker, you\u2019ll be under Uncle Guang Feng. Once you\u2019ve worked there for a few years and gained experience, then you can start doing it on your own. If you\u2019re lucky, then there shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you to earn up to four to five thousand RMB. It\u2019s also better if you start working early.\u201d Mo Jiaxing said as he smiled wholeheartedly.The world has changed, but Mo Fan remained bad at studying. Whereas Dad was still Dad; Mo Fan felt like he had retained an unchanged family.If Mo Jiaxing had mentioned the matter of becoming a construction worker to Mo Fan about a month ago, Mo Fan would choosen the road his father had arranged for him without hesitation\u2014this was because he had to walk this road to enter the society.However, the Mo Fan of now was different.In this society, there are cars, mobiles, computers and even refrigerators. However, scientific merchandise didn\u2019t exist because it was replaced by Magic. If you don\u2019t become a Mage, then you will become a worker that handles and produces those kinds of things. Damn, that\u2019s no different than the former world, thus, I will definitely study magic!\u201cDad, I want to continue studying.\u201d Mo Fan remained silent for a long period time before he told Mo Jiaxing about the thought in his mind.\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like studying magic?\u201d Mo Jiaxing said, with a raised eyebrow and his face filled with surprise.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Mo Fan felt caught between a rock and a hard place. How was he supposed to explain this thing. He was so screwed.Mo Jiaxing looked at his almost sixteen year old son as his face once again contained a straight and honest smile, while he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your father won\u2019t blame you for not putting effort into studying magic. Every individual has their own ambitions.\u201d\u201cNo, I genuinely want to study.\u201d\u201cAre you able to pass the exams?\u201d Mo Jiaxing asked.\u201cNo.\u201d Mo Fan said in in certainty.Whether it is having exams in English language or Magic, Mo Fan would definitely not pass, there was no doubting this point.\u201cThen that\u2019s that. Don\u2019t worry, Although the ancient people have said, \u2018Magic is above everything,\u2019 there\u2019s also a saying for those who are a jack of all trades.\u201dAs Mo Fan finished listening to this, he unconsciously smacked his lips.At the moment, there was a lot of information that Mo Fan had to process. However, during the period of time he was processing this information, Mo Fan was particularly silent. For example, Mo Fan remembered there was one time where the history teacher had told the students, \u201cThe Light Element Magic\u2019s earliest user was \u201cEdison\u201d, and at that time, it had caused Mo Fan to curse over and over again in his mind.When Mo Jiaxing patted Mo Fan\u2019s shoulders to console him, he suddenly realised that his son maintained his silence. His son\u2019s expression showed he was not in a normal state.No one understood their son like their father. Mo Jiaxing slowly retracted his smile, his voice turned lower pitched as he asked, \u201cAre you for real?\u201d\u201cYeah, I want to obtain the opportunity to awaken. I do understand that it\u2019s already too late, but I genuinely want to study and become a Mage.\u201d Mo Fan sincerely said.Mo Jiaxing remained silent.Mo Fan also didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cYou really want to continue studying?\u201d Mo Jiaxing confirmed once more.\u201cI do.\u201d Mo Fan nodded his head without hesitation.Originally, Mo Fan also thought it was on impulse. However, it has been a month and the restless sensation the Wild Wings had brought into his heart had yet to cool down. He really was not kidding, he seriously wanted to study!\u201cIn that case, alright, I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d Mo Jiaxing said no more.\u201cDad, I found a temporary job at the Tian Lan Magic High School, looking after the library. It starts the day after tomorrow.\u201d Mo Fan said.Since he has decided to study magic, Mo Fan had no intentions of giving up due to himself being unable to properly study. Whether he could enter the Magic High School and obtain the opportunity to awaken would have to depend on his father, while he would depend on himself to fill in the knowledge that he was lacking. He was very clear on the fact that he had no hope to be admitted into Magic High School\u2014thus, Mo Fan found this job in advance.There was practically no salary, just food and residence. However, to Mo Fan, this was very important as he could find many things he lacked in the library.Mo Jiaxing was astonished, he didn\u2019t know what had caused his son\u2019s great change of mind. However, since Mo Fan has wholeheartedly begged for magic, then he had no reason to be unhappy. After all, in this society, the ones who truly held a status were the Mages. A construction worker could get a house and a car, but their value and respect still couldn\u2019t be compared to a Mage who graduated from a Magic School.\u201cLet\u2019s go home first, we\u2019ll talk at home.\u201d Mo Jiaxing nodded his head, no longer saying anything else. Mo Jiaxing did not worry about his son at all. Mo Fan wasn\u2019t sixteen yet, but in Mo Jiaxing\u2019s heart, Mo Fan had already entered adulthood.1. Mo Fan\u2019s \u2018Fan\u2019 is also used in the chinese \u2018Ping Fan\u2019 which means mediocre/average2.

If one were to follow the road with the iron fences, and walk to the end of that small road, one would find Mo Fan\u2019s home.It was a small, one-and-a-half-story house; the exterior wall had cracked paint, which revealed the red bricks underneath. There was junk in the houses surrounding it.The other houses in the neighborhood were all about three-and-a-half-story tall. After going through renovations and after being decorated, the houses looked more like actual homes. Whereas Mo Fan\u2019s house\u2014furthest away in the corner\u2014seemed even more like a wretched and old-fashioned house.\u201cBrother Mo Fan, you\u2019re back\u2026. I brought you some good news.\u201d As Mo Fan arrived at the entrance to his home, a monkey-like youth sprung out, his face filled with joy.This monkey was Zhang Hou, one of the children of the families that lived near this block. One could say that he grew up with Mo Fan.\u201cWhat\u2019s the good news?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cLittle Princess is back, I saw her when I was by the entrance to the mansion. Wow, you have no idea how much prettier Little Princess has gotten\u2014she\u2019s just like a little angel.\u201d Zhang Hou said with some excitement.Mo Fan glanced at the mansion across the street. The mansion was exquisite to the point where it caused everyone to feel envious. Every inch of the flowers, plants, and trees had been through careful enhancement, causing it to reach the level of a real garden park.However, the beautiful mansion\u2019s garden was currently being surrounded by tall iron fences.When he reminisced back to his childhood, the iron fences were not there. He had regularly brought along the kids from this street to the mansion\u2019s garden to play.At the highest location of the residency, there existed many extremely exquisite european-style villas. In the eyes of these children, they looked like a castle from a fairytale, and within the castle was indeed a Princess so beautiful that made them forget to breathe. She was at a similar age to them and Mo Fan would frequently sneak the Princess out to play with them\u2026..He couldn\u2019t remember when the iron fences appeared around the residency, and the adults in the neighborhood no longer allowed their children to go into the mansion. In addition the make-believe Princess had turned into a real Princess in the castle. Following the passage of age, they became more and more distant, and the number of times they met became less and less.\u201cDid you know? I heard that Little Princess is currently the Ace of the renowned Imperial Magic School, her innate talent toward Ice elements is simply incomparable with her peers. She is able to utilize Ice magic at the tender age of 15.\u201d Zhang Hou said in mystery.Mo Fan was astonished. If Zhang Hou were to tell him that the Little Princess received a medal in the Olympics, then he probably wouldn\u2019t feel anything. However, if it was about becoming an Ice Element Mage, then that was something completely different!Most people had to wait until they turned sixteen\u2014in their first year of High School\u2014to receive awakening before obtaining their first Elemental Magic.After obtaining that, it didn\u2019t mean you had become a real Mage yet. You had to go through a long process of training, obtaining a Magic Book, and diligently practicing before being able to release magic. _Little Princess sure was impressive, she became a real Magician at the age of 15!__Could it be that she is the so-called Child Prodigy? The Child Prodigy of the Magic World!_\u201cBrother Mo Fan, I feel sorry for you. If only you put in more effort to take away the naive and innocent Little Princess back when we were younger. Now she\u2019s talented and good looking, tsk tsk tsk\u2026 it sure makes us quite envious.\u201d Zhang Hou said as he raised his eyebrow.\u201cThat was when we were young, stop talking about useless things.\u201d Mo Fan said cluelessly.As Mo Jiaxing heard the two youths talk about this, he coughed and dragged Mo Fan back home.As he just returned back home, Mo Jiaxing said, \u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit. Xin Xia is living with your aunt, she\u2019s probably not coming home.\u201d\u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d\u2026\u2026After Mo Jiaxing left in a haste, Mo Fan walked around his house and realized his home hadn\u2019t changed at all.Although the world had changed, the bitterness of being poor hadn\u2019t changed. _How come my family didn\u2019t trade with the family with the mansion? Really God? You went through all that trouble to turn Science into Magic but you couldn\u2019t do something as small as changing this?_The only thing he rejoiced over was the fact that his own appearance did not change\u2014it was still as outstanding and elegant as before!Sitting at home was boring\u2014there was nothing to do. Mo Fan was so bored that he decided to go out and take a stroll. He also wanted to see what else had changed.As he followed the mossy road that no one walked on, he saw his father\u2019s pickup truck as he was about to meet the main street.His Old Man was a chauffeur. He used to drive the Master of that Mansion; however, he didn\u2019t know how his father ended up being transferred into the logistics section. There was a day where he went to purchase things on the behalf of the Mansion, and ever since then, the family\u2019s condition had gradually gotten worse.\u201cJiaxing, this request of yours is a bit rude, isn\u2019t it. You should know that I treated your family quite well in the past. Despite the kid from your family committing such a deed, I still left some work for you to do. If it was someone else\u2019s family, I\u2019d just have had them pack up and leave immediately.\u201d A middle-aged man\u2019s tone slowly sounded.\u201cBrother Mu He, just look at this as the last time I request help from you. If I were to try and buy our way into Tian Lan Magic High, then that\u2019d be too expensive. You should already know of the situation of my family, we really can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Mo Jiaxing said, slowly and humbly.\u201cYou\u2014why are you doing this for your failure of a son. He himself doesn\u2019t have the qualifications to pass the exams to enter the Magic High so you might as well let fate run its course, he\u2019s almost 16. Besides, even if I were to help you get your son into Magic High, just based on his character, he will definitely slack and not become a genuine Magician. Becoming a Magician is not that easy, not only do you require talent and hard-work, but those Magic Books, Magical Devices and Magical Tools are not something your family can afford. Without these things to support him, he can\u2019t even become a Primary-level Magician\u2026.\u201d The man called Mu He said with sincere tone, but Mo Fan could hear a sliver of arrogance in it.\u201cThis time, he genuinely wants to study. Brother Mu He, if you help me out this time, then I will move far away from Master Mu per his demand. This way, we would also make Master Mu feel at ease, and I will also guarantee that my little brat will certainly not interact with Lady Mu Zhuxue.\u201d Mo Jiaxing\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cOh, in that case, I\u2019d have to consider it.\u201dAs soon as he heard they were willing to move away, this man called Mu He seemed to have more interest in the discussion.\u2026\u2026A youth leaned onto a wall as he listened to the conversation; his heart felt incredibly complicated.He thought that when the world changed, the many terrible connections he had would also have changed. However\u2026it seemed like nothing had changed.Like a ruler, the rich people of the Mu Mansion were at the very top, whereas the very bottom was this father who had to go through hard work and needed help from other people. This Mu He was the Chairman of Tian Lan Magic High, and the truth was that he only needed to say a single word and it\u2019d allow Mo Fan to enter Tian Lan Magic High.However, after hearing his own father\u2014Mo Jiaxing\u2014being willing to move away, Mu He quickly agreed with a heavy sigh.At the end of the conversation, his father was incessantly thanking Mu He. While Mu He got into his luxurious car and left, he left behind the seemingly old pick-up truck with dust, and his seemingly as dusty and old father, Mo Jiaxing._How is this a dream?_This cruelty was exactly the same as his previous reality. The Mo Fan who was leaning onto the wall with a serious look, he was very aware of the fact that his own family\u2019s condition had not changed at all. Their low status had also not changed at all.In olden times, the older family in the society had power and status; there was no difference at all in the modern world; some families have more heritage, longer history, and their family still occupies positions and identities with power. Even if the common people were no longer called servants to the rich; they were now called workers; and although they no longer needed to kneel and salute, the fates of these common people was still below those of the rich, and their fates could be manipulated easily at the fingertips of these rich people.Mo Fan himself was born into a family at the very bottom, and they were being completely domesticated by a wealthy family called \u2018Mu\u2019.Within his heart, it felt like there was something violently surging\u2014he grasped his fist tighter and repeatedly smashed it against the azure-colored wall.\u201cYour Mu Family took advantage of me when I was young, and when I was lying down!\u201d\u201cWhen I am powerful, I will definitely return the favor tenfold\u2014no, a hundredfold!\u201d* * *Translator: TofuEditor: DOCuinn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those words appeared to be earnest and sincere, however, the disdain he had for the Mo Family, and toward himself, was very evident._Can\u2019t even become a Primary-level Magician?_\u201cYour father, I, will make you eat those words!\u201dMo Fan admitted there was a period of time where he and the Little Princess, Mu Ningxue, were very close with each other. However, the young him did not know what kind of disaster this would bring to his poverty-struck family. From that day on, Mo Fan finally realized that a social class difference existed.\u201cMo Fan, hahaha! I have solved your problem! I gave a call to an old friend of mine, and it turns out he\u2019s doing really well now. He is the chairman of Tian Lan Magic High. He said if you can diligently cultivate magic, then he could allow you to enter Tian Lan Magic High and let you awaken your Elemental Magic. This kind of opportunity only comes once in a lifetime, so you really need to do your best this time, alright? The yellow faced Mo Jiaxing entered the home with a smile, as he patted Mo Fan on his shoulders.Mo Fan looked at his father\u2019s joyous smile. If he was his normal self, he would also be happy and celebrate this by drinking a cup of white wine with his father. However, how could he still believe in his father\u2019s honest and bright laugh after knowing the truth? What made Mo Fan have even less faith in his respectable father was that no one else respected him in their society.\u201cReally? That\u2019s really good! That\u2019s definitely my dad; he fixes whatever issues come our way. Haha!\u201d At last, Mo Fan finally wore a smiling face, as he reached his arms around his father\u2019s shoulders.\u201cOf course! Who do you think your father is?\u201d Mo Jiaxing thought this kid\u2019s bullshit was really well done, so the smile on his face grew increasingly wider.The father and son still had a few cups left. While they were drinking, Mo Jiaxing tactfully said, \u201cMo Fan, you should live in the dorms. I\u2019m planning on renting out the house so we can get a bit more money for ourselves.\u201dMo Fan already knew that this house had basically been sold to Mu He. This lousy house holds no value in itself, however, the land is inside the city area so it\u2019s price was very high.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do that. I don\u2019t come back very often anyway. It\u2019s just\u2026 What about Xin Xia\u2026\u201d Mo Fan said as he pretended to not know the truth.\u201cXin Xia is staying with your aunt. To be honest, it\u2019s not easy for two men like us to take care of Xin Xia. That girl is very sensible, so there\u2019s no need for us to worry about her,\u201d Mo Jiaxing said.\u201cIn that case, I understand. Make sure you come and visit me often in school,\u201d Mo Fan said.\u201cI will. Alright, I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ll head off to sleep first. You should go to school tomorrow,\u201d Mo Jiaxing finished the last cup of white wine and stood up swaying.Mo Fan saw him turn around. Seeing his back made him suddenly remember the article written by Zhu Ziqing._I will live in school, and Xin Xia will stay with our aunt. We_ _have found a place_ _, but where is this man going to live?_Ultimately, Mo Fan didn\u2019t bring up the issue.In fact, Mo Jiaxing was willing to make these sacrifices because he believed it was the duty and honor of a father. He wanted to let his son know that he should study in peace, and that he would help him solve any issues that he couldn\u2019t solve by himself.Besides, Mo Fan also understood that if he were to bring the issue up it would only make Mo Jiaxing feel sorrow and shame. After all, what man doesn\u2019t want to be an awesome father who can fix everything for his son?Mo Fan couldn\u2019t bring it up. Other people might disrespect his father, but he wouldn\u2019t!_This broken house\u2026 So what if we don\u2019t live here? At most in three years_ _,_ _after I have achieved a great level in magic studies, I will have anything I want.__In this society, Magic is respect!__I will become an indomitable Master Magician!_\u2026\u2026The two months of summer break went past really quickly. Mo Fan felt as though he had been dropped into a sea of books.There were all sorts of books in Tian Lan Magic High. Furthermore, the books concerning Magic were just like science books: complicated, numerous and offering a genuine significance to what knowledge they could offer.However, Mo Fan had reaped a great harvest. At the very least, he was no longer an illiterate\u2026 _Oh,_ _M_ _agic illiterate!_ Mo Fan had basically grasped all the knowledge from the nine years of compulsory Magic education. His hidden potential was unleashed as he was pushed to the very depth of his desperation.The school started on the first of September. The opening day held great importance for all the Magic students. This was due to taking part in the most important step for all students entering the world of Magicians; they would determine what kind of Elemental Magician each would become.Awakening, just as the name sounds, involved awakening the hidden powers within your body.\u201cLittle brat! I wish you luck. Best you awaken the fire element. That will allow you to hold an advantage over other Magic students. Although the other elements are quite alright, among the Primary-level Magicians, the Fire element is the best when it comes to battle prowess. Oh, Rock element isn\u2019t bad either\u2026 nor is Wind element\u2026\u201d the Chief Supervisor of the Library, Old Man Gu said.Mo Fan replied in agreement without understanding him. When this Old Man started talking, he just didn\u2019t stop.The truth was, Mo Fan was unable to sleep last night. To him, the awakening today wasn\u2019t just a change of fate for him, but also an unprecedented attempt. In his original world, things like Magic simply did not exist. However, today he was finally able to wholeheartedly grasp this experience.His little heart was leaping and frisking about.\u2026\u2026Mo Fan was placed in class 8, with his student number being 48.There was nothing he could\u2019ve done about it. He practically entered the school from the backdoor.The higher up the student number, the higher the score they received during the Magic Middle School Exams. It was said that when a person of higher number awakened and received an element, their speed in cultivating the magic was much faster compared to a regular person. This was because their understanding toward Magic was much better, thus, cultivating it was also much easier for them.As luck would have it, the number one in class 8 just happened to be Mo Fan\u2019s old classmate, Mu Bai.Mu Bai was actually from the Mu Family. It seemed that he was not from the main family though. The reason as to why Mu Bai always looked down on Mo Fan was, naturally, because of his status within the Mu Mansion. He was considered as a little Young Master, whereas Mo Fan was the son of a servant, thus also a servant.Unfortunately for this lad, he\u2019s just a child of the branch. He was nowhere near a princess like Mu Ningxue. Mu Bai had used every tactic to court Mu Ningxue, however, she only ignored him.Mu Bai\u2019s grades in magic were really good. Within the Mu family, he was one of those who received extra attention. It was said that if he awakened the element of the Mu Family, the Ice Element, his future cultivation speed would increase several times. After all, the Mu Family had many resources they could offer. The other families simply couldn\u2019t compare with what the Mu Family could provide to a child from a branch of the family.\u201cClass, congratulations on admittance. Presumably, many of you have been waiting for the emotional time today, but before that, there are many things I need to say to everyone.\u201d On the Great Magic Grounds, all of the 1500 new students were divided into twenty classes, forming into squads, as they stood neatly next to each other. They looked magnificent!\u201cStudents, do you know what it means to become a Mage?\u201d\u201cNo matter what kind of Mage you turn out to be, do not forget that we magicians exist to further allow humanity to grow. We protect the most important mission of humanity. Do not forget that outside of this safe city, there are countless Magical Beasts watching us like a tiger watches his prey.\u201dAs the Headmaster\u2019s speech came to an end, he finally came to the part everyone was looking forward to most.\u201cAlright, you will begin the awakening ceremony today. I hope you will become rising stars in the future world of magic!\u201dAs the Old Headmaster\u2019s words were said, the students on the grounds could no longer hold back the joy in their hearts.Who doesn\u2019t want to wield flaming fires that brim with the power to destroy your enemies? Who doesn\u2019t want to wield ice and freeze the world over? Who doesn\u2019t want to dominate and gallop across the world with arrogance? Who doesn\u2019t want to wield the power of earth and resist invaders?Within innumerable stories, videos, and movies there are many heroes who are worshipped.

    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Versatile MageChapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0GravityTales\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0GravityTalesThere were twenty different classes that would conduct the awakening.Mo Fan was number 48; he would be the last person to receive the awakening.The Homeroom Teacher, who was also their Magic Advisor, Xue Musheng, was already standing at the very front. The awakening would be conducted in front of numerous people. The student\u2019s name was called out, and then they would go up front to place their hands on the Awakening Stone in front of the Magic Advisor.\u201cHey, the-one-who-entered-through-the-backdoor, you\u2019re not gonna fail the awakening are you? I heard that there are certain incapable people who fail the awakening. A dreg like you should just stop wasting the energy of the expensive Awakening Stone,\u201d on a different line up, an old classmate of Mo Fan, Zhao Kunsan said.Zhao Kunsan was Mu Bai\u2019s henchman. Mu Bai personally didn\u2019t bully Mo Fan because of his background, so instead, he primarily used Zhao Kunsan to do it.It was actually possible for the awakening to fail, so Mo Fan was genuinely worried about this part. Strictly speaking he was\u2026 yeah, a person who had crossed from a different plane. If his physical body was different from the people from here, then that\u2019d be one of hell of a joke.\u201cBrother Mo Fan, just ignore this jerk. Wait until you awaken a Fire element and show him. Then he\u2019ll know the meaning behind the phrase, \u2018Look down on people from a dog\u2019s eyes.[1]\u2019\u201d Zhang Hou, who was placed in the same class as Mo Fan said.Mo Fan didn\u2019t say anything. If it was a different day, he would\u2019ve thrown all sorts of insults at Henchman Zhao Kunsan, however, he wasn\u2019t in the mood today. On one hand, it was because he was truly very nervous. While on the other hand, he didn\u2019t know why the black pendant he wore around his neck was incessantly shaking.The black colored pendant was the remnant of the backdoor gatekeeper of his old middle school, Old Man Ying. Mo Fan suspected that this ring was the reason behind the great changes in the world. That day, Mo Fan was wearing this pendant when he fell asleep on the mountain behind his school.Ever since this morning the broken pendant had been acting like it was possessed, constantly trembling. It shook so much that it made his own hand shake without stopping._Screw your mother! Why do you keep shaking?? You\u2019re just a stupid pendant, so why aren\u2019t you acting like the pendant you are?!_\u201cMu Bai!\u201d the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, called out.\u201cOh, so that\u2019s Mu Bai. He is indeed very handsome, and his grades are the top as well.\u201d\u201cYeah, I saw him this morning, I like it. I wonder what kind of element he\u2019ll awaken? I reckon it won\u2019t be crap elements like Water or Light, will it?\u201dMu Bai stood up and immediately heard a few girls in his class chattering incessantly about him. At same time, he also attracted starry-eyed infatuations from other classes.Mu Bai wore an indifferent expression. His eyes, however, revealed that he was enjoying others discussing him. He walked to the front and stood before the homeroom teacher, a humble and confident smile on his face.\u201cMu Bai, you\u2019re from the Mu Family who is renowned for their Ice element right?\u201d Xue Musheng asked with a slight smile.\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\u201cGood, if you awaken the ice element, then you will be superior compared to others. However, don\u2019t forget to put in effort too. After all, talent isn\u2019t the decisive aspect to everything.\u201dMu Bai nodded, but he thought to himself, \u201cYes, talent can\u2019t decide everything, but without talent and family resources, then one would have to live forever at the bottom of the society.\u201dWith permission from the homeroom teacher, Mu Bai slowly placed his hands on the floating Awakening Stone.A thick, star shaped compass emerged, along with a clear palm print on the Awakening Stone. Mu Bai seemed tranquil, but his heart was nervous as he placed his hands on the Awakening Stone\u2026Thanks to his bloodline, the possibility of him awakening Ice Element was very high. However, there could also be exceptional circumstances. If he awakened the Water or Light Element then the Mu Family was unlikely to continue attaching any importance to him. After all, there was no way they would waste their finances just so they could find resources suitable to a different attribute.He placed his left hand on the stone\u2026The Awakening Stone suddenly emanated a starry radiance. This radiance turned into strips of star marks that appeared to be an extraordinary vein as it landed on Mu Bai\u2019s left hand.This was everyone\u2019s first time seeing the awakening with their own eyes; the students were all tiptoeing as they watched Mu Bai.Mu Bai was standing there unmoving, as though he was suddenly enlightened. He then raised his head slowly\u2026\u201cCreak, creak, creak~~~~\u201dA sudden frosty air curled itself around the Awakening Stone.The air became more and more dense. It actually slowly froze the surface of the Awakening Stone, forming a layer of frost!\u201cIce Element! It really is the Ice Element!!!\u201dSuddenly, a person behind him began yelling. Following this yell, a few girls screeched.As Mu Bai heard the noises, he opened his eyes in joy!It\u2019s actually the Ice Element! With the Ice Element, it would be easier for him to be taken in by the Mu Family. The day where he would soar through the skies was not far. To deal with someone like Mo Fan, the dreg of the society, would be like pinching an ant to death\u2026 Ah, that\u2019s not right. _After awakening the Ice Element, I will become an official disciple of the Mu Family. There is no reason for me to lower myself to the level of a beggar.__I need to set my standards higher. Who knows? I might even have an opportunity to cultivate together with Mu Ningxue!_\u201cVery good. It is a very pure Ice Element. I believe an Ice Element Star Dust should be appearing within your Spiritual World. Cultivate harder, and make it grow even stronger!\u201d the homeroom teacher said, with eyes full of praise.The ability to freeze the Awakening Stone during the awakening meant that the power of his Ice Element surpassed the average person. He was likely to be a very talented Ice Element apprentice, and his future was very promising!\u201cNext, Qiu Yueying!\u201dAfter the homeroom teacher said this, a girl with a somewhat confident look on her face came over.\u201cAlright, Earth Element. The power of your stardust isn\u2019t bad at all. It seems like the effort you\u2019ve put in is showing!\u201d\u201cNext, Xu Qinglin!\u201d\u201cAlso Ice Element.\u201dAt this moment, Mo Fan tiptoed to watch. He discovered that the person who also awakened the Ice Element, Xu Qinglin, caused a layer of faint frosty mist to emerge. It did not freeze the Awakening Stone though.From this, one could tell that even if this was the Ice Element, Xu Qinglin\u2019s talent and cultivation was much lower than Mu Bai.\u201cNext, Lu Xiaobing.\u201d\u201cHm, Water Element!\u201d\u201cAhhh, oh my god, how could I be Water Element? I should be a Fire Element!\u201d suddenly, the classmate called \u2018Lu Xiaobing\u2019 called out in bewilderment. The people within the circumference of a hundred Mi heard this.\u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged. No matter what Element you cultivate, as long as you can become an Intermediate-level Mage, you will obtain even more recognition.\u201dLu Xiaobing had no other choice. He could only return to his own seat in low spirits.In fact, the awakening in the beginning was very important. If it was a Fire Element, then one could possess a certain level of combat prowess as a Primary-level Magician. That allowed future cultivation to happen much more easily.The Primary-level Water Element skill was \u2018Water Shield,\u2019 and its defensive power was not as strong as the Earth Element. If one was not proficient in it, then the effects were not very clear. At the very least, that\u2019s how it worked among the Primary-rank Mages.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: MindLitUp* * *[1] Looking down on people who are far better than you are.*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he put his hands on it, an odd wind vortex appeared on the Awakening Stone, causing the teacher\u2019s clothes to move slightly.\u201cVery good. Wind Element. Your talent isn\u2019t bad at all. Practice hard, and don\u2019t be lazy!\u201d Xue Musheng\u2019s face also revealed a look of satisfaction.The homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, was feeling very happy. This was because he had only reached ten or so of them, and there were already two talented students who had appeared. If they were to cultivate well, then they would definitely be admitted into a good University.Naturally, what made his face light up like a gem was student number 1, Mu Bai. An outstanding Ice Element talent coupled with the Ice Element Family behind him, his future capabilities would be of a great asset!It seemed like the class 8 had an opportunity to become one of the top classes this year.\u201cNext\u2026\u201d\u201cNext\u2026.\u201d\u201cNext\u2026..\u201d\u201cPu~~~~~\u201dAn orange colored fire suddenly lit up on top of the Awakening Stone.This scene caused the entire class to widen their eyes.\u201cFire\u2026 Fire Element!!!\u201d\u201cShit! It turned out to be a girl. What\u2019s her name?\u201dFor a moment, the girl who awakened the Fire Element became the focus of the class. This Element was the most amazing one among the Chemical Elements. This was also the Apprentice-level Mage\u2019s first choice in awakening. If they were able to choose which Elements to get, then\u2026.Unfortunately, the Fire Element was quite arrogant yet tender, and the probability of awakening it was quite low. In a class, there\u2019d be at most three of them; that\u2019s not even one every tenth students.\u201cHer name is Zhou Min. It seems like she\u2019s the daughter of some teacher,\u201d someone said in a whisper.\u201cShe looks really good. We should get to know her better.\u201d\u201cWe should be cautious. This Zhou Min looks like she\u2019s very quiet and obedient, but in reality, she\u2019s very short-tempered and violent. How else could a girl awaken the Fire Element?\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cDaughter is just like mother. If Mrs. Wenhua knows about this, then I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be excited,\u201d the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, said.\u201cThank you teacher.\u201d\u201cNext\u2026.. Wind Element.\u201d\u201cNext\u2026.. Light Element.\u201d\u201cHeavens, I\u2019m going to the roof. Don\u2019t stop me,\u201d the Light Element student said.\u201cNext\u2026.Water Element.\u201d\u201cClassmate with the Light Element, wait for me! I\u2019m coming with you to the roof.\u201d\u201cNext\u2026..\u201d\u2026\u2026Finally when it seemed like the entire class had their Elements awakened, Mo Fan\u2019s hand held the student number 48, as his heart madly skipped incessantly. Perhaps no one else was as nervous as Mo Fan. On one hand, his first interaction with magic was only three months ago, while on the other hand, he was really worried that he\u2019d fail his Awakening!\u201cNumber 48, Mo Fan!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your turn!\u201d Zhang Hou turned his head around and encouraged him.\u201cSacrificing everything to get in here. Just don\u2019t hold any kind of hope. If your luck is good, you could get Water Element. If you can\u2019t reach the Intermediate-level Mage, then you\u2019ll have wasted it. If your luck is bad, then your awakening will fail. Tsk tsk tsk\u2026 and by then you\u2019ll be expelled,\u201d Zhao Kunsan said with sarcasm.\u201cWould you shut your dog mouth?\u201d Zhang Hou said with slight anger.Zhang Hou saw Mo Fan as a big brother. Although his grades in Magic were bad, and he entered Magic High through the backdoor, Zhang Hou absolutely did not wish to see Mo Fan\u2019s awakening be worse than others.The nine year compulsory magic education actually served to build a foundation for the Awakening, as well as the theories for cultivation afterward. If they didn\u2019t study well, then on one hand, the Awakening might fail, while on the other, the cultivation might not advance.Mo Fan took large strides and passed through the crowds of people.\u201cIt\u2019s him. It seems like he entered through the backdoor.\u201d\u201cWho is this? He looks pretty handsome,\u201d a girl asked dreamily.\u201cA dreg of a student. I was originally from the class next to his,\u201d another girl with a mushroom head and large mouth said.\u201cIs that so? Then his awakening might be bad.\u201d\u201cWhether he will succeed his awakening is the real question.\u201d\u201cThose of you who awakened Light or Water Element, don\u2019t worry. Wait till you see this Mo Fan awaken\u2026 then you\u2019ll feel much better. This guy\u2019s exam score was at one digit, and his foundation is completely shit. His awakening is likely to fail,\u201d at that moment Zhao Kunsan spat at Zhang Hou with a straightforward, loud voice that carried a sense of mocking.As he said this, the Light and Water Element students eyes turned bright. If there really was a person that failed their awakening, then that would really make them feel\u2026 relieved.\u201cStop making a racket!\u201d Xue Musheng glared at Zhao Kunsan.The corner of Mu Bai\u2019s mouth slowly curled up. He wanted Mo Fan to be humiliated in front of everyone. _What qualifications did he have to approach Lady Mu Ningxue? He\u2019s just a loser. Someone as handsome as me, with a good talent in magic and who makes great efforts, who is Mu Ningxue\u2019s relation, should be very intimate with her._\u201cDreg\u2026 I heard that your family sold the house so you could do the Awakening. If you really happen to fail the awakening, then you should just find a river and jump into it. That way your problems will be solved. Then you can also save your family from being humiliated,\u201d Mu Bai said with a delicate whisper as Mo Fan passed by.Mo Fan glanced at Mu Bai; he endured the impulse to curse at the idiot as he walked to the front of Xue Musheng.\u201cMo Fan, put your hands here,\u201d Xue Musheng said with a gentle tone.As the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng was very clear on the circumstances of the student in front of him.His middle school exams were essentially at the bottom. He was only able to enter Tian Lan Magic High because of the higher ups pulling strings. From how Xue Musheng saw it, Mo Fan was from a normal family: no background, no talent, his grades were so bad that he didn\u2019t even want to look at them. This kind of student being sent to his class was simply a headache; it was very easy for him to pull down the average of the class._Ah, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I\u2019ll have to count myself unlucky. Hopefully this kid won\u2019t actually fail his awakening, or else he\u2019ll become the laughingstock for the entire year._Mo Fan\u2019s hands was constantly shaking. At the end of the day, he was still a little nervous.\u201cSmooth and steady, don\u2019t shake,\u201d Xue Musheng said as a reminder.Mo Fan used his left hand to grab onto his right hand. In this way, he successfully put his right hand onto the Awakening Stone.It\u2019s cold. He didn\u2019t know if it was because the last person had awakened the Ice Element, causing the entire Awakening Stone to be ice cold.Eh? Something\u2019s not right. Why is it beginning to feel numb and hot?\u201cClose your eyes and feel your Spiritual World!\u201d Xue Musheng said.What a troublesome student; he doesn\u2019t even know the basics.Mo Fan hastily closed his eyes as instructed.This so-called Spiritual World could be seen when one closed their eyes, and within their head, a piece of void would emerge. A normal person would continually imagine in this void, and just like movie fragments, there would be those indistinct scenes. When one emptied their mind and stopped thinking, the mind became a void\u2026 just like a sky without a star.Within the Spiritual World, there was nothing at all. However, when Mo Fan placed his hand on the Awakening Stone, he could feel the power of lightning\u2026This power was transmitted from his hand to his body. Following this, there was suddenly a miraculous power within his empty Spiritual World, which caused a purple colored arc to streak across the world; it was gorgeous, magnificent, and an experience that shocked his soul!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: MindLitUp*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Versatile MageChapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0GravityTales\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0GravityTalesWithin the empty Spiritual World was a little bit of light. Mo Fan carefully tried to focus his awareness on it. Suddenly, he noticed a tiny bit of stardust emerging from the void.Mo Fan felt a burst of excitement.This stardust was extremely important to Mages; it measured the Mage\u2019s cultivation. The stardust existed within the Spiritual World of Mages, and the more that occupied the void, the stronger the power of the Mage!Mo Fan already saw something illuminated within the stardust. It looked like a small, purple colored star cluster. Comparing it to the rest of the Spiritual World, the cluster did not look like dust. While at same time, this meant that his awakening had not failed. The book clearly stated that as long as there was a star cluster within the Spiritual World, no matter how weak and feeble it was, it meant that the awakening was successful!_Hahahaha! Who said that this father, I, would fail the awakening?!__Didn\u2019t I succeed the awakening?____I really want to see the aghast faces of Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai.__Hm?__Hold on, what\u2019s the color of the star cluster?__It\u2019s not red\u2026 How unfortunate. I didn\u2019t awaken the Fire Element.__Red represents the Fire Element.__Green represents the Wind Element.__Brown represents the Earth Element.__Blue represents the Water Element.__Gold represents the Light Element.____Purple represents\u2026____Holy crap!!!_Suddenly, Mo Fan was completely flabbergasted._Purple!!!____He actually had the purple star cluster; the purple color!!!_\u2026\u201cHeavens! Someone in the class next to us awakened the Lightning Element!\u201dOn the training ground, a student suddenly cried out in surprise.\u201cWhat? Lightning Element appeared?? Shit, that\u2019s a whole lifetime\u2019s worth of luck.\u201d\u201cWhere, where? Woah, what a dazzling and ruthless purple. The homeroom teacher of class 7 must\u2019ve been quite surprised.\u201d\u201cUhhhhh, kill me already. Why am I Water Element? Why didn\u2019t I get the Lightning Element? Don\u2019t stop me. I\u2019m going to the roof.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother jumping; you won\u2019t die. Beneath it lies the corpse of a Light Element user.\u201d\u201cThis Lightning Element student will cause an uproar throughout the entire school!\u201dAfter the Lightning Element appeared, everyone felt a shocking sensation.If one said the Fire Element was the first choice of all the common Mages, then the Lightning Element was the beautiful grace bestowed from the Heavens. The Lightning power was more tyrannical than the Fire Element. It allowed Primary-rank Magicians to possess a combat prowess that exceeded others. According to statistics from the teachers, there was a 50% chance for students who awakened the Lightning Element to become Intermediate-level Magicians (unless they slacked off and did not study properly).The Magic Middle School Exam basically eliminated roughly 60% of the students. The remaining 40% became students who were allowed to go through the Awakening.Among the students who went through the awakening, there might be around 60% who were eliminated. This was because during their 3 years at the Magic High, there was a chance that they would not be able to release any magic at all.There\u2019s one thousand five hundred students in school, but only one student who awakened the Lightning Element. This went to show how rare the Lightning Element was!\u2026In that moment, all the teachers and students eyes flew toward the boy in class 7. This boy, coincidentally, wore purple clothes. This made the indistinct purple lightning arc from the awakening seem increasingly dazzling. In that moment, this seemingly confident, yet cold, boy became the focal point for a thousand people as he gave rise to a boiling excitement from the crowd.\u201cWoah, why is it so noisy?\u201d Mo Fan slowly opened his eyes, his face was filled with joy.However, as Mo Fan opened his eyes, he discovered the teacher who was watching over him was completely enchanted with the class next to them.Mo Fan turned his head around and saw the students behind him also looking at the class next to them._What\u2019s going on??__Where are you guys looking??_Soon enough, Mo Fan finally found out what was going on.Apparently, a person in the class next to his had awakened the Lightning Element. In the instant of Mo Fan awakening, the teachers and students gazes were directed toward the lad who awakened just before him!Mo Fan\u2019s face was filled with bitterness as he looked at the Awakening Stone, which was also leaping with a purple lightning arc. He really wished he could just slap the homeroom teacher across the face and tell him, \u201cWhy are you envying the shit in the class next to ours?! Look at me! I also possess the almighty Lightning Element!\u201dAs Mo Fan was about to speak, a starry radiance suddenly lit up again on the Awakening Stone. It was as though blood vessels began forming on Mo Fan\u2019s hands.Mo Fan\u2019s face filled with surprise!_Wasn\u2019t the awakening over? Why was this Awakening Stone starting up again?_Mo Fan wanted to retract his arm, but the magic power had already been transmitted into his body from his palm.Fiery hot.A fiery hot power!Mo Fan himself had no idea on what was happening. However, a small part of the power urged him to once again spread his awareness into his Spiritual World and perceive the second power\u2019s invasion.Within the empty Spiritual World the purple star cluster remained in the same area, sparkling with a faint radiance. Seeing this made people eager to see it dazzle and bloom more brightly.This was the star cluster of the Lightning Element\u2026 the power he had awakened only moments ago.The other power from the awakening charged in like the Lightning Element. Within Mo Fan\u2019s Spiritual World was a blazing arc streaking across like a burning meteor, causing Mo Fan to tremble.\u201cThis\u2026 this is\u2026\u201dWithin his Spiritual World emerged a \u201cRed Star Cluster\u201d!!!Mo Fan was at a loss in the beginning, but he soon felt an excessive joy!_Fire Element!__He had also awakened a Fire Element!__Unexpectedly he had Dual Elements!__He had actually awakened Dual Elements!_One had to understand that among the Primary-ranked Magicians, students could only awaken a single Element. Someone who could awaken Dual Elements was practically non-existent. The probability of it was a million times lower than awakening Lightning Element!_Heavens!!!_Mo Fan felt like he was suddenly knocked unconscious with happiness.The appearance of the Lightning Element had made him go wild with joy. With the Fire Element emerging, and becoming an Innate Dual Element user, he felt like he was about to cry from such intense joy!After acquiring the knowledge surrounding Magic, Mo Fan was very clear on the fact that having an additional Element signified that he\u2019d be one step ahead of others, despite the fact that the cultivation of the Elements would need to be independent of each other.It was like an online game. The people on the server were only allowed to create one account and bitterly battled against monsters to level up. Whereas he himself could create two accounts. The most important factor to this was that he could combine the two accounts and have it on a single character, so his combat prowess would be more than 1+1=2!_This is too good!!__I have an Innate Dual Element. One that was the heaven shattering Lightning Element, while the other was the ferocious Fire Element. Who could stop me at this point?_The guilt over his father selling his house and being humiliated was cleansed in that moment. Mo Fan was very clear on the fact that if he put great effort into cultivating the two Elements, then he would become a Magician who would stand above the others at the same level._Who cared about the Mu Family with a hundred years of heritage? Who cared about the Ice Element family? Is that as amazing as the Dual Element that your father, I, am in possession of?__Hahaha! Hahaha!

This Zhang Jianguo\u2019s face is going to be filled with pride from today on.\u201d Xue Musheng\u2019s own face was filled with envy and jealousy.While in the front, Mu Bai\u2019s face was filled with shock and was followed by a bit of gloom and disdain.The Lightning Element is extraordinary. However, if you don\u2019t know how to cultivate it, then you\u2019ll just stay a loser. Having some strong Element appearing in China which has a large population isn\u2019t anything out of the norm. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a Natural Dual Element user, hmph. You dare to steal my limelight? Watch me trample you flat on the ground in the future.Oh, I almost forgot to check what kind of Element this dreg has. The awakening took so long so it must\u2019ve failed.\u201cWoah, woah. It\u2019s a Fire Element!!\u201d\u201cThis is serious, our class has yet another Fire Element.\u2019\u201cWho said he would fail his awakening? It turns out he awakened the Fire Element, that sure makes me envy him.\u201dAfter the disturbance from the shocking Lightning Element had calmed itself, everyone finally discovered the Element Mo Fan had awakened.The girl, Zhou Min, who awakened the Fire Element earlier seemed a little shocked. She intentionally looked closer at Mo Fan and discovered that there was indeed fire sprouting from the Awakening Stone. The sprouting fire seemed to be a bit more vicious than the one she had herself.\u201cThere\u2019s yet another Fire Element appearing in class 8.\u201d\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not as rare as the Lightning Element, the Fire Element is still incredible!\u201d\u201cFire\u2026..Fire Element\u2026.\u201d Xue Musheng looked dull as he looked at the student before him.The appearance of the Lightning Element almost made Xue Musheng forget about the existence of this troublemaker. Originally, he thought this student would\u2019ve failed his awakening. However, he never thought that he would actually succeed in his awakening, and never did he think that he would even awaken the preeminent Fire Element!This\u2026..this is also a treasure!!Furthermore, judging by the exuberant level of the flames, it seems like his talent was even higher than Zhou Min\u2019s.Xue Musheng never thought that the student he thought to be a liability would unexpectedly give him face instead!\u201cNot bad, not bad, that\u2019s really not bad at all. What\u2019s your name\u2026oh, Mo Fan, right?\u201d Xue Musheng was smiling so wide that his eyes looked as if it was closed.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mo Fan nodded.Mo Fan originally thought that people saw his Lightning Element awakening. However, after looking around himself, he realized that no one had actually taken notice of that\u2026.Either the person who awakened the Lightning Element was exceedingly shocking, or his own Lightning Element awakening\u2019s power was too weak.The pressure emanating from the Awakening in the beginning matters, however, it\u2019s not a decisive factor. Even if the pressure from the beginning was weak, one could still put in efforts to slowly cultivate it, allowing it to grow even stronger.\u201cFire Element student, hmm. You must strive to do well in the future, if you have something you don\u2019t understand, don\u2019t hesitate to ask me.\u201d Xue Musheng happily said as he patted Mo Fan on his shoulders.Mo Fan was still feeling ecstatic.However, he didn\u2019t let himself indulge in this happiness. If it was any other youth, then they would most likely reveal the Lightning Element they had awakened previously, using the credibility of Natural Dual Elements to completely steal the audience\u2019s attention from the other Lightning Element student.Mo Fan was not going to do that. If the heavens can be jealous of a genius, then how would mortals feel?Mo Fan knew that there\u2019s someone who carries hostility toward himself in the Mu Family. Thus, if he were to reveal that he possesses Natural Dual Elements, then either he would have to comply with their wishes, or they would simply get rid of him. Although Mo Fan did possess the peerless Dual Elements, he himself was still too weak. It was not too late to go crazy after he had gotten stronger!Mo Fan turned his head around to see the reaction of Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan.Sure enough, the two lads faces were twitching!\u201cWhat kind of luck does this kid have? Let\u2019s not even talk about the successful awakening, but he even awakened the Fire Element!\u201d Although Mu Bai looked dignified, his heart was harshly cursing him.\u201cWhat the heck, how is this possible? Fire Element\u2026.\u201d The henchman, Zhao Kunsan stared in confusion.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve said it before, Brother Mo Fan is indeed not normal! Fire Element, impressive, it really is impressive. Who cares about you, Zhao Kunsan, with your Wind Element.\u201d Zhang Hou jumped in joy. He saw the henchman, Zhao Kunsan\u2019s face and immediately sensed resentment.Zhao Kunsan\u2019s face was filled with rage. If one were to compare Primary-ranked Wind Element with Fire Element, then Wind Element will definitely be the losing side!Mo Fan turned around with an unrestrained smile on his face as he bathed under the sunlight. Suddenly, it was as though the carpet beneath his foot spread out with two girls squealing. He was filled with confidence.As he walked past Mu Bai, Mo Fan sneakily gave him a middle finger. The entire action was done in a smooth way, it looked like they were just greeting each other.Mu Bai felt as though he had received the full force of Mo Fan\u2019s ridicule, his breathing became so heavy it was practically about to explode.He took a deep breath. Mu Bai told himself to maintain his image, he must maintain his image. He couldn\u2019t stoop down to the same level as this beggar. He himself is the Little Young Master of the Mu Family, whereas this guy is just the son of a part time worker.Let\u2019s not talk about this loser succeeding in his awakening. He had even awakened the Fire Element that has a superiority in its preceding period, I guess even losers have their luck\u2026. Additionally, what made him even angrier was the appearance of the rare Lightning Element in the class next to them. The attention from Mu Bai\u2019s own ancestral Ice Element was completely stomped by him, shit!\u201d Mu Bai whose appearance seemed like a Prince Charming was harshly cursing in his heart.Mo Fan returned to his place while at the same time, he felt the gaze from his surrounding classmates that were completely different from before.\u201cThe Fire Element, we better not provoke this guy in the future.\u201d\u201cProvoke? We should improve our relations with him. If a Light Element user like myself should mix in school, then I\u2019d need a Big Brother with Fire Element to support me.\u201d\u201cOh right, what\u2019s his name? Was it Mo Fan?\u201dThe surrounding students were whispering, but it still somewhat was caught by Mo Fan\u2019s ears. Mo Fan felt his mood turn even better, while at same time, he glanced toward Mu Bai who had also heard this. Sure enough, one could see a little dissatisfaction on Mu Bai\u2019s face.Mo Fan already knew what kind of trash Mu Bai is. From day to night, he just acts like a Green Tea 1. The fake and emotionless expression he keeps on his face means that on the inside, he felt extremely dissatisfied.Green Tea Man. You turn green with envy when your daddy awakens the Fire Element? Just wait till you know that I, Mo Fan, also possess the Lightning Element\u2026. You may even commit harakiri wouldn\u2019t you?* * *1.

The dead leaves whirled along with the wind, as they finally landed on the school grounds.On the side of the school grounds was a dense shade of trees. The afternoon sunlight shone through a gap of in the leaves, turning into threads of light, like a particular autumn stage.For Mo Fan, the time passed by very quickly. It had already been two months since his awakening.Within those two months, Mo Fan had only been doing one thing, which was sitting beneath this tree and meditating!On the first class of the first day, the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, gave all the magic students one very important lesson: the activation of Magic!The activation of Magic consisted of only three very simple steps:Step 1- MeditationStep 2- ControlStep 3- ActivationMeditation, just as the name implied, required one to use their fullest attention to concentrate.When a person closed their eyes, their mind constantly wandered into different scenes.However, if one were to empty one\u2019s mind and remain in an undisturbed state, one\u2019s mind would become an empty space!After their magic awakening, a star cluster corresponding to the Element would emerge within that empty world.In other words, as long as Mo Fan closed his eyes and didn\u2019t think about anything while allowing his mind to enter a dark, cosmos like space, then the star cluster of Lightning and Fire elements would emerge within the empty space.The Lightning Element\u2019s star cluster was purple, and it looked just like other cosmic dust: magnificent and aesthetically pleasing.Within the star cluster of the Lightning Element was seven stars. These stars were recklessly orbiting around within that small star cluster, just like seven mischievous children, energetically running around.For any magic students who had awakened, as long as they could cause the star cluster to appear within the empty space, and see the bright, child-like stars within the cluster, then they would have completed the Meditation step.One could even say that this first step was unexpectedly simple. The homework assigned to the students for the first two months was this alone.Meditation\u2026 They started meditating after dinner, all the way until they were completely exhausted, and then they went to sleep.The second day, after classes had finished, they continued meditating in the same manner. All the way until they were exhausted, and then went straight to bed.Mo Fan did not slack off; he did this for two whole months. He even sat down and meditated on weekends. On many different occasions, he pondered about why the students were assigned this simple task and had them do it for two months._What if I go ahead and try \u2018Control\u2019?_ Mo Fan thought it was very easy for him to enter Meditation, thus, he was eager to begin the next step.The second step of Magic Activation was also very simple.One could see the star cluster after entering Meditation. Within the star cluster was seven lively and energetic stars that were orbiting around frantically.Control\u2026 It meant they had to use their own thoughts to control these stars, making them stop, and placing them into a designated spot to form a Star Path.Once they had successfully formed the Star Path, the Magic Power would be conducted through the Star Path into the Magician\u2019s body, thus becoming genuine Magic as they activate i!\u201cThey sure run fast. Let this daddy touch you,\u201d Mo Fan began attempting to connect the stars.He used his own thoughts to control the stars. At the moment, Mo Fan was locked on an energetic star, trying to make it obediently halt in its place.\u201cWhooosh~~~\u201dThat Star was extremely cold; it didn\u2019t give Mo Fan any attention. It was like a Loli[1] quickly escaping from a strange Uncle.\u201cShit, they\u2019re being tsundere[2]. Forget it, let\u2019s try a different one,\u201d Mo Fan attempted to connect the other Lightning Element star.\u201cBe a good boy\u2026 Daddy is here\u2026 Be an obedient boy, and come here\u2026\u201d\u201cWhoosh~~~\u201dThe second Star acted as though it met a patient with a mental illness\u2026 Thus, it fled quickly, just like the one before it.Mo Fan attempted the same thing on the other stars as well, but the results were the same. Not a single one cared about Mo Fan. There were even a few that started moving faster when they felt Mo Fan\u2019s thoughts trying to control them.You couldn\u2019t conduct the Magic Power when the stars were quickly orbiting.It\u2019s just like an electrical wire. The electric energy is the interior part of the star cluster. If one wanted to use the electric energy, one would have to form a wire with the stars so it could guide the energy into the Magician\u2019s body.Unfortunately, there was not a single obedient one among the Lightning Element stars. If he didn\u2019t touch them, then they were fine, but once he attempted to connect them with each other they would quickly run away. It was like eating five hundred pounds of Stride gum pieces\u2026 they just wouldn\u2019t stop!\u201cHow do I deal with this? How many years and months is it going to take before this daddy learns Lightning Strike?\u201d Mo Fan felt a headache.The Primary-rank skill of Lightning Element was \u2014\u2014 Lightning Strike.This skill should be the most practical one among the Primary-rank magic. After learning it and becoming proficient in controlling it, one would basically have a preeminent combat prowess.Unfortunately, learning skills wasn\u2019t easy.The Lightning Element stars were highly active. Trying to make them stop was not something one could accomplish in just a day or two.\u201cI can\u2019t even control a single star at the moment. To control seven of the stars simultaneously\u2026 This road really isn\u2019t short.\u201dSure enough, studying and learning Magic was the same; it wasn\u2019t something you could do in just a few days.\u2026\u2026The weather turned cold, the short skirts and stockings were replaced with thick leggings and pants. Unknowingly, the season where you turn into a dog if you don\u2019t own a heater had finally come to the south.\u201cAchoo~~~\u201d Shit, if I knew this was gonna happen, then I would\u2019ve just cultivated the Fire Element first. At the very least, I\u2019d be able to pass this winter in comfort,\u201d in the early morning, Mo Fan cursed as he practiced \u2018Control\u2019 on the roof.He had cultivated for yet another month. Mo Fan was now able to control up to four stars._The process of controlling the stars\u2026_ _Well, how to put this?_ _It\u2019s like an advanced domino set up._In other words, if you were to carefully place four domino bricks down, and if there was not even the slightest wobbling, then it would count as completing a small step.If a domino brick wasn\u2019t placed properly, then it\u2019d tip over and you\u2019d have to start all over again!The stars were just like that. Firstly, you would have to target a star and use your thoughts to make it stop. In the process of making them stop, you would have to concentrate all of your attention on it. Even if you experienced resistance from a star that lead to a great headache, you\u2019d still have to grit your teeth and not let it distract your focus.Only when grinding your teeth could you centralize your focus within your mind to control them, and make them stop; only then, could you make some of the violent stars obediently follow your control.After you were in control of one star, then you would have to split your consciousness and do the same thing in order for you to firmly control the second one.If one were to accidentally put too much attention on the second star, and not continue to put in the same focus on the first one, then the originally obedient star would immediately orbit away. Additionally, it would also take away the second star that was in the process of being controlled, and waste the entire effort.The teacher had said once before: the step of controlling the stars was extremely difficult. On one hand, the difficulty of controlling them was exceedingly high, while on the other, the Magician needed to have enough Spiritual Power to spare.If one were to practice \u2018Control\u2019 everyday, like Mo Fan, and every time they failed at it, they would feel their mind become somewhat tired. One could practice for at most, two hours in a single day, and by then one would be in a state where one was nearly mentally broken. One would have tinnitus, blurred vision, and a mind in chaos.At this point, one should not meditate or attempt control again._To be frank, practicing \u2018Control\u2019 was like a thief\u2026 Hell, a waste of mana!_ Mo Fan could only last, at most, two hours with his current mana.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: MindLitUp* * *[1] A minor, basically.[2] Someone who feels the opposite of how they act.*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Versatile MageChapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0GravityTales\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0GravityTales\u201cFour stars is firmly under my control now. The difficulty of controlling five at the same time is much harder.\u201d Mo Fan sighed and thought, _I wonder if I can control all seven of these scoundrels and form a Star Path before the end of the semester? Speaking of which, Monkey said that most people can only practice \u2018Control\u2019 an hour every week\u2026 If they trained an additional five minutes, then they\u2019d collapse. I wonder why I could practice two hours when I first started\u2026 Is it because I awakened dual elements?_The mana usage in taking control of a star should be the same. That means my mana capacity is double the amount of most other people?\u201dThere was a limit to each of the magic student\u2019s spiritual forces, and every time one attempted to control a star, it would deplete their spiritual force. Most of the current Magic Student\u2019s Spiritual force levels only allowed one hour of \u2018Control\u2019 training.Having one more hour advantage, coupled with the great effort Mo Fan put into his daily training, allowed his cultivation speed to already surpass his peers by a lot. According to the henchmen, even the most outstanding student in the class could only control 3 stars.Of the 7 stars, Mo Fan was already able to control 4 of them. Furthermore, he hoped to achieve up to five stars within the month. It seemed like awakening dual elements not only gave Mo Fan double the elements, but also an extended amount of time for him to practice compared to other people!This was an incredible advantage!The time for him to enter the apex of his life and marry a fair-skinned, rich, and beautiful girl was just around the corner!\u2026\u2026The class started at eight in the morning, and the first class was the \u201cMagical Beast Knowledge\u201d class. The one in charge of teaching the \u201cMagical Beast\u201d subject was the homeroom teacher of the class next door, Zhang Jianguo.\u201cMo Fan, you are late again. Can\u2019t you improve your attitude toward school? Your talent has always been worse than the majority of the students, your foundation is also particularly bad, and you\u2019re not even sincere about studying. Take a look at Zhao Ting in my class. He has Lightning Element, a good talent, a good foundation, and his attitude toward studying magic is also very good. He is currently able to control four Lightning Element stars, whereas you\u2026 I heard that you still haven\u2019t been able to control a single Fire Element star. You awakening the Fire Element is simply a waste!\u201d as Zhang Jianguo saw Mo Fan coming in late, he immediately began to reprimand him without holding back.Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but give a conceited look. Teacher Zhang Jianguo really couldn\u2019t stop talking. He brought up that Lightning Element guy during practically every lesson.The so-called classmate, Zhao Ting, was the guy who awakened the Lightning Element during the school\u2019s opening ceremony. Zhang Jianguo talked about him every day. When he lectured someone using Zhao Ting\u2019s name, his face revealed the pride he concealed beneath.\u201cThat guy can control four stars? This daddy can control six stars; I just need one last star,\u201d Mo Fan thought to himself in disdain. He didn\u2019t say this out loud though. Instead, he just walked to his seat in leisure.\u201cAlright, please open the Magical Beast book. Today, I will continue to talk about the common Magical Beasts. As everyone knows, the Magical Beasts are located outside of the city, which we humans reside in, and they are extremely hostile towards humans. They wander all over the place and fight when they encounter each other, as well. If a Magician was to tread outside of the city and encounter a One-Eyed Magic Wolf, then what should he do?\u201d Zhang Jianguo already started talking about this subject with a great delight.One-Eyed Magic Wolf\u2026This was the kind of Magical Beast that resided in the area closest to the human city. Mo Fan had only seen one through the textbooks and videos; they had a vicious appearance.A normal person was unable to deal with this kind of organism. Only a Mage was able to battle them. However, if the group of Magic Students, who couldn\u2019t activate their magic, was to meet a One-Eyed Magic Wolf, then it\u2019d be a bloody massacre.The One-Eyed Magic Wolf was the highlight of the Magical Beast classes. Zhang Jianguo had already spent a month talking about this type of Magical Beast, which by this point, annoyed Mo Fan.Currently, Mo Fan relied on his double cultivation time to reach the control of 6 stars. As long as he could focus his mind, then he could make the six stars obediently form a Star Path.The thing is, the seventh star was particularly difficult to control. It was like a chaste girl, go soft and you\u2019ll suffer. Go hard, and she won\u2019t listen. This made Mo Fan feel particularly anxious!_I\u2019m just bloody missing this one last step!_\u201cBrother Fan, how is the cultivation progress of the Fire Element?\u201d Zhang Hou hastily asked as he saw Mo Fan sitting down.\u201cThe same as before,\u201d Mo Fan answered leisurely.Fire Element\u2026Just like the rumors Zhang Jianguo had heard, Mo Fan was still unable to control a single Fire Element star.That was something he could do nothing about. He had invested all of his energy on the big shot, Lightning Element student this entire semester.\u201cNo way. It seems like your foundation really has affected your cultivation. I heard that guy, Mu Bai, is already able to control four Ice Element stars. If he were to put even more effort in during his winter vacation, then he will most likely be able to activate the Primary-rank Ice Element skill, \u2018Ice Spiral,\u2019\u2019 Zhang Hou said.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cBig Brother, how are you not anxious at all? Let me tell you, him and his henchman, Zhao Kunsan, are already scheming a plan against you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, let them come.\u201dMo Fan\u2019s current mind was full of how to control the seventh star; everything else was treated the same as air.Zhang Hou sighed, \u201cJust be careful\u2026 This semester is almost over. You should really do your best in the next semester. If you can\u2019t complete the Magic activation during the next semester\u2019s end of term Magic Activation exam, then the school could find all kinds of excuses to force you to resign.\u201d\u2026\u2026The school semester quickly ended, and Mo fan faintly felt the seventh star being moved by his sincerity.\u201cDamn it! Cultivation is even harder than awaiting the presence of a Goddess\u2026 trying to communicate and pay my greetings every day and night\u2026\u201d Mo Fan complained as he walked toward the school exit.Mo Fan had practically never left the school during the entire semester. He would spend two hours every day to practice \u2018Control,\u2019 and after practicing that, he\u2019d spend the next ten hours to meditate. Afterward, he\u2019d just go to class, eat his meal, and sleep without ceasing for a single day.Regardless of what happened, this semester was over. After the students received their winter semester assignment, each went their way home, and each went to find their own mom.After exiting the school gates, Mo Fan subconsciously waited for the bus to go home to his house. However, he then realized and immediately became speechless._I almost forgot that dad sold the house; I am essentially homeless now._Father Mo Jiaxing spent most of his time driving, which meant he didn\u2019t have time for a house. The homeless Mo Fan thought about this, It seems like it\u2019s time to see little aunt and pay a visit to Xin Xia.It\u2019s been half a year not seeing Xin Xia; I wonder how she\u2019s doing at Little Aunt\u2019s place.\u201cI\u2019ll just go straight to her school to pick her up then.\u201dMo Fan caught the bus heading toward her middle school.Sitting on the bus, Mo fan had nothing to do, so he continued to practice \u2018Control\u2019 to see whether the seventh star would submit itself or not.A different Element had different stars, and each different star had a different temperament. Some were easier to deceive; Mo Fan only needed to spend a few nights sweet talking them, and most of them would then listen. However, some were especially violent and hard to deal with. If you weren\u2019t careful, you could suffer a rebound in your mind. That kind of rebound carried a dense pain to the mind. The usage of Spiritual Power would also be several times greater.The seventh star that Mo Fan was unable to control belonged to the violent type; it didn\u2019t listen. It attacked brutally, and it was simply as difficult to accommodate as a great aunt.Fortunately for him, recently their relationship had advanced by leaps and bounds. The violent star was slowly displaying a will to listen, otherwise, Mo Fan would really cry. He had spent almost an entire month on this seventh star.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: MindLitUp*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come, get in a line. Number off!\u201dMo Fan calmed himself and put his full focus on once more attempting to control the seventh star.The first star was the most obedient one. After all, it had been caressed everyday. As soon as Mo Fan issued a command, the star immediately stopped its lively movements, leaving it floating in the middle of the star dust.The second star seemed somewhat stubborn. It showed an unwillingness to cooperate, as it quickly followed the first star.Following behind them were the third, fourth, and fifth stars\u2026The sixth star was extremely obedient; it eagerly ran to the formation._Alright, there\u2019s only the last star left!_Mo Fan put all of his focus, all of his Spiritual powers, into the seventh star.The seventh star orbited at a high speed within the star dust before it heard Mo Fan\u2019s thoughts and gradually slowed down. It carried an impatience and unhappiness as it slowly took its place in the Star Path\u2026_GOOD BOY\uff0c_ _G_ _OOD BOY_ _!!__G_ _OOD BOY_ _,_ _GOOD BOY_ _!!_As Mo Fan noticed the seventh star showing signs of submitting, he began to feel a slight excitement.The first six stars are like dogs: if you shout, then they\u2019ll obediently sit down, motionless. The seventh star was like a cat: freaking cold and impatient from head to toe._Since you want me to stay still, then I\u2019ll do my best to make it difficult for you.__Slowly\u2026slowly\u2026_The seventh star finally stopped in its tracks as it followed along the path of the other six stars.Star Path complete!Magic, Appear!Mo Fan, who wore a black t-shirt, was sitting in the back row of the bus; he suddenly had a curved track curling around his body. A purple star dust trajectory flashed past, giving Mo Fan\u2019s body an indescribable force.\u201cLightning Strike!!!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lightning Strike!!!\u201dMo Fan\u2019s heart gave rise to a wild excitement; he couldn\u2019t help but want to laugh toward the sky.\u201cBzzzt~~~~~~~~\u201dOn his right fist an arc of lightning coiled around his arm like a python. The force of the purple Lightning Fist was stored within Mo Fan\u2019s hand; if he were to brandish his hand, lightning would be sent toward the middle of the bus.\u201cOh my god!!\u201d\u201cMage! It\u2019s a Mage!!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a Lightning Element Mage\u2026 Ah, why do I feel my entire body turning numb?!\u201dA surprised voice was heard from within the bus. The older auntie who finished her round of shopping, the old man who finished exercising, the young girl who was playing on her phone with her head lowered, as well as the pervert who was molesting the girl with the phone were all stunned as they saw at Mo Fan at the back of the bus.\u201cGreat\u2026 great mage, I\u2026 I promise I won\u2019t do this again\u2026 I beg of you, please spare me! I have eyes but couldn\u2019t see Mt. Tai,\u201d suddenly, the middle aged man who was molesting the young girl yelled out as he kneeled down, his face covered in tears as he begged for forgiveness from Mo Fan.The middle aged pervert thought the young Mage had seen his own vulgar behavior, enraged him, and caused him to activate his Lightning abilities.This Lightning force was extremely terrifying. All of the people on the bus were intimidated by the Lightning force, causing them to feel numb all over\u2026 especially the pervert who molested the young girl. His hands were numb to the point where he couldn\u2019t feel anything.\u201cI\u2019ll spare your dog life. If I catch you doing it again, I\u2019ll immediately make you lose the use of your hands!\u201d Mo Fan stood up after understanding the situation; his aura was cold as he looked down on the pervert.\u201cYes! Yes, I won\u2019t do it again, definitely.\u201d After saying this, the pervert frantically escaped from the bus as the driver halted.The surrounding aunties and uncles immediately reacted with praise. A few evident middle school girls looked at Mo Fan in admiration.\u201cMom, that older brother is incredible. Am I able to become as unbelievable as him in the future?\u201d an eight year old child dragged at his mother\u2019s skirt and asked faintly.\u201cBecoming a Mage is not something anyone can do, especially a Lightning Element Mage.\u201dMo Fan realized his magic had caused a huge uproar within the bus. In order to avoid the disturbance, Mo Fan quickly departed.After exiting, Mo Fan\u2019s heart was the same as before\u2026 unable to calm down._Shit, that is so freaking cool!!_Recalling the Lightning Strike twirling around his arm and the dreadful feeling of being able to easily eliminate a person was unprecedented. It was like a dream!_This is magic??__This is Magic!!_Mo Fan\u2019s heart throbbed incessantly. Even though he didn\u2019t activate Lightning Fist, Mo Fan could still feel the might of the Lightning force. It came from within his body; he could control it, and it brought a strength he never considered before.The reverence everyone on board of the bus directed at him\u2026 the pervert who was kneeling on the floor, begging for forgiveness, and the mysterious Lightning force that spiralled around his fist\u2026_This really is an inconceivable!_\u201cHahahaha! I have learned the Lightning Strike, and I only needed a semester to do so. I want to see how you guys are going to stand in my way now? Mu Bai, Zhao Ting, all of them will have to kneel before me.\u201dMo Fan was able to control Lightning Fist in just a semester. The fact is, the school gave the students one year to complete this ability.From the beginning of the school year to the end of the semester, Mo Fan had only used five months worth of his available time. If this speed was known publicly, then his classmates and teacher, or even the students and teachers of the entire school, would be completely dumbstruck.It seemed like the student who was favored by the Magical Beast teacher, Zhang Jianguo, had reached the control of four stars not too long ago\u2026 Mu Bai was at the same level as him._Hahaha! This Daddy has already activated Lightning Fist. How can you, Mu Bai, a green tea man, compete against me?__I can feel the power of the Lightning Force being released from it spiral around my arm. I wonder what it\u2019d be like if I were to truly release it? Just thinking about it makes me want to yell out in excitement.__Deep breath, deep breath. I\u2019ll look like an idiot if I laugh in the middle of the road; I need to be calm. I am an incredible Mage!_Mo Fan actually wanted to use Lightning Strike one more time, but after he had finished the Lightning Strike earlier, his body began to feel empty and dizzy.\u201cThis is probably the spiritual exhaustion that the teacher mentioned, right?\u201d Mo Fan asked himself.Generally speaking, Mo Fan could maintain two hours of practicing \u2018Control\u2019. He would only feel Spiritual exhaustion after two hours.He had only practiced \u2018Control\u2019 for twenty minutes when he was on the bus; however, in the moment he completed Lightning Strike, he felt his Spiritual Force being completely drained\u2026Mo Fan still understood this point. While he was practicing \u2018Control\u2019, he wouldn\u2019t complete the Star Path. Normally speaking, that wouldn\u2019t use too much Mana. However, if he completed the Star Path and channeled the Star Force into his body, thus achieving the true effect of Magic, then the majority of the Mana would be gone._I\u2019ve never been a Mage before, but I\u2019ve played all sorts of games like League of Legends, or The Legend of Mir; they all follow the same logic!_* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The most delicate and fashionable girls were assembled there.The difference between this and other schools was this school doesn\u2019t use the dull Magic Theory education, and they definitely didn\u2019t have fools who only knew how to write exams in Magic books. These girls came from families with magic backgrounds, thus, they naturally knew more than the magic students who had to go through nine years of compulsory Magic education. For an instance, some of them would frequently wear a Magic Tool ornament around their chest.This Magic second generation has been wearing Magical Tools that enhance their Spiritual Force since the day they were born. Compared to these people, Mo Fan was just a peasant who has to climb his way up, step by step.The small roads around the school were filled with luxurious vehicles as it was just in time for the end of school. Mo Fan was very clear about Xinxia\u2019s character; she would definitely go around the girls with limousines and go along the small road in the alley. as she smelled the fragrance of the small bamboo by the window which was planted by the residents.Mo Fan walked around the main entrance as he planned to wait for the little sister, Ye Xinxia, by the end of the road in the alley.There weren\u2019t many people who would use the road in the alley. Mo Fan passed through other people\u2019s courtyards as he entered the familiar road.Although the world has changed, the city with which he was so familiar hadn\u2019t changed, neither had the bamboo by the window.Thinking about it, Ye Xinxia shouldn\u2019t have changed either.\u2026\u2026Mo Fan stood in the middle of the alley with his back leaning onto a wall. He looked like a gangster waiting for an opportunity to extort arcade tokens from primary students. He would occasionally raise his eyes to look at the entrance of the alley, hoping to surprise the girl who was about to come over. Who would\u2019ve thought that the beautiful silhouette would not appear for half the day?_How come she\u2019s not coming?_The pose in which Mo Fan was standing made him feel numb.As he slightly closed his eyes, Mo Fan was practically about to enter meditation out of habit.Suddenly, Mo Fan heard a noise coming from the entrance of the alley in the direction of the small hill. Usually, these noises and clamors would be deafened by the high walls of the alley. For some reason, these noises ended up in his ears._Could it be the side effects of Meditation_ _has_ _increased perception?_Mo Fan began walking toward the direction of the small hill in curiosity.As he walked in the direction of the small hill, it became clear all of a sudden. The front side, at the foot of the hill, was roughly a kilometer away from the house that Mo Fan\u2019s family recently sold.Down the hill was a small lawn that looked like a small park. Near an air vent was a swing made of twisted vines.The swing was standing still, without the slightest bit of movement.Sitting on top of the swing was a girl with long, black hair. The winter wind messed her hair, revealing a silky white and delicate face. She had long eyelashes, exquisite nose, and lips glossy like jade.She attentively looked forward in silence. It was as though she perfectly blended in as a portrait with the winter swings and delicate lotus. Cold and lovely, yet alone as her unique temperament blossomed.Mo Fan\u2019s steps halted suddenly, without realizing when he started to enjoy looking at her like this. Seeing her sitting caused a warm current to surge within Mo Fan, flowing down the deepest part of his heart. At which point, he couldn\u2019t help but allow the corner of his mouth to curve.However, in this moment, Mo Fan felt something wasn\u2019t right.His eyebrows immediately creased as he walked toward the elegant girl sitting on the swing.The girl also felt someone walking over; however, as she saw it was Mo Fan, her face didn\u2019t appear surprised at all. She only gently laughed, as though she knew this person would be coming and she was here waiting for him.\u201cBig Brother Mo Fan.\u201d The girl called out with a sweet voice.\u201cIt\u2019s that crap again, isn\u2019t it?\u201d As Mo Fan walked over, a faint anger crept up his face.Xinxia didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cToday, I will definitely deal with them; they\u2019re a group of degenerates!\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s anger multiplied, and he gazed at the staircase on the hill.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of them; forget it.\u201d Xinxia shook her head, advising Mo Fan to drop his anger.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to forget about it. I\u2019m going to deal with these dregs.\u201d Mo Fan said no more and followed the staircase up.Xinxia, who was sitting on the swing, wanted to pull Mo Fan away, but Mo Fan was already climbing up the mountain, seething in anger.Xinxia was familiar with Mo Fan\u2019s temper. He has always fought the neighborhood bullies and ruffians for to reasons related to her. He would fight against multiple people every time and return with wounds all over his body\u2026This was something she wants to see the least.The ones bothering her this time weren\u2019t some small ruffian or bullies. It was clear these people had long ago dropped out of school. The people who messed around in this area were known as the Azure Bear Gang. They were for hire to the wealthy girls living around here; whoever they didn\u2019t like, they\u2019d step on them.There were at least five people over there, and two of them had very sturdy bodies; their bodies were several times bigger than Mo Fan\u2019s. If Mo Fan were to go up there to find them, he would definitely be beaten badly.\u2026\u2026On the pavilion, on the hill.\u201cXu Bing, don\u2019t you think we lack elegance if we do it like this\u2026.\u201d A youth said with a cigarette hanging from his mouth and poker cards in his hands.\u201cHow are we lacking elegance? This is my sixteenth time expressing my sincere feelings to her, allowing her to become my girlfriend\u2026. Can\u2019t I sit here on the pavilion playing cards as she considers this?\u201d The young man called Xu Bing responded.On Xu Bing\u2019s neck was a clear azure colored tattoo and, due to his short jacket that covered half of the tattoo on his neck, it seemed extremely eye-catching. You could tell with a single glance that he was a character that was hard to provoke.\u201cYeah, if she wants to reject you, she would\u2019ve walked away already\u2026. King Flash, hahaha. Give me the money, double up!\u201d Sitting on the other side, a young man wearing a cowboy hat with a hole said.\u201cDamn, this bullshit luck of yours.\u201d\u201cOne more round, one more round. We\u2019ll play till the sky turns dark. I don\u2019t believe the girl won\u2019t panic.\u201d Xu Bing narrowed his eyes, enjoying the position of someone on top.Towards girls, one had to be unyielding. A girl\u2019s natural disposition was to be shy; if one isn\u2019t a bit unyielding, then one would not be able to do anything. This girl Xinxia was becoming prettier with time; seeing her really made one excited. _There\u2019s actually someone who would say that I\u2019m like a toad who wants to eat the meat of a swan. Today, I will claim this girl, and then see who would dare to say anything_.\u201cOh right, I remember this little girl still has a brother; that\u2019s annoying.\u201d The young man in cowboy adornments commented.\u201cHis battle prowess is lacking. Other than having an unyielding character, he is just a meat bag. You can beat him up however you want.\u201d Xu Bing said without caring much.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Before, I would be enough to deal with him. Now, I\u2019ve gained some muscle I\u2019d like try beating that thing up!\u201d* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This girl does indeed look good, however\u2026. Being able to do _that_ is a bit hard to say.\u201d\u201cI think so, too.\u201d\u201cIn this all-girl school, there are numerous of pretty girls. The people are dumb but they have money; just threaten them a bit and they\u2019ll cave in. Why would you go through so much trouble for just this one girl?\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat do you know? It\u2019s is called having good taste.\u201d Xu Bing viciously glared at the group of people.While he was starting to feel dissatisfied with the terrible taste of this group of boys, Xu Bing raised his head and saw a young man wearing a black t-shirt, walking toward the pavilion with a cold aura surrounding him._Eh? This guy seems familiar.__Crap, speak of the devil, isn\u2019t this the brother next door to the girl?__This guy, I\u2019ve been wanting to deal with him for the longest time for obstructing me from trying to hit on this girl. Who would\u2019ve thought that you\u2019d come to me by yourself? It just happens that there are quite a few of my brothers here today; we\u2019ll just let you have a taste of getting beaten and we\u2019ll see if you dare to stand up again in the future!_\u201cBrothers, grab your weapons!\u201d Xu Bing stood, his gaze interlocked with Mo Fan\u2019s cold eyes.The man with cowboy adornment, the young man with a cigarette hanging from his mouth, the man with the headphones, and the man wearing the jacket immediately stood up as they all looked to their side\u2026\u201cBro, we didn\u2019t bring weapons,\u201d The cigarette man moved closer to Xu Bing\u2019s ear as he faintly whispered.\u201cWhat the heck? Do you need weapons to deal with this thing? Beat him up real good. Per the instruction of Brother Zhao Kunsan, if we beat him up then it\u2019s on him!\u201d Xu Bing slapped the talkative brothers on their forehead with his palm as he responded enraged.The man with the cigarette felt wronged. _You were the one who said to grab the weapons\u2026it seems like it\u2019s just a wordplay._\u201cSince it\u2019s something Brother Zhao Kunsan has instructed before\u2026..\u201d The man with the jacket removed his jacket as he chuckled, revealing his white tank top and bustling muscles!Mo Fan looked attentively at the five trash from Azura Bear Gang with a gaze that felt as though he was looking at a domesticated animal.\u2026\u2026\u201cHmph, kid, let put it like this; my interest in a girl like your sister is practically the luckiest thing in her life. Do you think anyone else is like me, Xu Bing, who doesn\u2019t care that she\u2019s a\u2026 a\u2026.cripple? There\u2019s no reason for a cripple to act like a Goddess; if there\u2019s anyone who wants her, then you should burn the money and thank Buddha[1]!!\u201d Xu Bing pointed at Mo Fan as he revealed his true intentions.Xu Bing\u2019s patience had run out after all these years._Look at me, Xu Bing; I have the looks and the strength._ Within the Guangchi District, he was quite the character. _If Ye Xinxia were to follow me, she would be able to live well whether she has it good or bad and she\u2019d always have minions at her service._\u201cThe point is, learn to appreciate favors!\u201d\u201cNow, obediently call me brother-in-law. Seeing how we\u2019re going to be a family, we will be gentle with you. This way, we can tell Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai we beat you up. If you\u2019re still resisting, then we\u2019ll break your legs so you can be a cripple along with your sister!\u201d the muscular man with a white tank top commanded.After hearing this, Mo Fan\u2019s chest began heaving violently.He glanced at the pavilion.In the middle of the pavilion, there was a lone wheelchair with poker cards on top of the seat.Originally, Mo Fan was extremely angry from seeing these dregs using Ye Xinxia\u2019s wheelchair as a table for playing poker. However, now that he had heard these humiliating insults from Xu Bing, Mo Fan felt as though his chest was about to explode._A cripple?_A _cripple_?????_I, Mo Fan, have pledged a vow. If someone were to ever say this kind of stuff to Ye Xinxia, then I will make sure they will regret being reincarnated as a human!_\u201cStop wasting time with this kid; go beat him up!\u201d\u201cI, alone, am enough to deal with him, brothers; you just stand to the side and watch.\u201d The muscular man in white tank top began cracking his fist.Mo Fan looked at them with extremely icy eyes.However, as they were messing around here, they didn\u2019t notice one thing. He was forging a vicious purple colored lightning path within his eyes. The Star Path contained a tremendous Lightning Force that was about to erupt like a volcano under Mo Fan\u2019s rage.\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m still the same Mo Fan who you can take advantage of?\u201dA restless force began to tremble in the atmosphere around Mo Fan. It was like fully armed soldiers who were waiting for the commands from their General!\u201cYou, who isn\u2019t even on the same level as a domesticated animal, are just in time to taste the flavor of Lightning!\u201dThe moment the angry voice transmitted from his throat, the seven stars formed and became a Star Path, causing the power from the Lightning star dust to gather within Mo Fan\u2019s right arm!\u201cBzzt~~~~\u201dAn astonishing arc of Lightning sparked across Mo Fan\u2019s body like a python. In the next second, the restless Lightning in the atmosphere began to assemble within Mo Fan\u2019s right arm, emitting an ear-piercing noise!\u201cHeavens!!!!\u201d\u201cWhat is that???\u201d\u201cWhy is there lightning crackling around his body?!\u201d\u201cThis kid\u2026..Heavens, he\u2019s a Mage!!\u201d Among these people, Xu Bing was the one who had seen the most of the outside world; \u201cMage\u201d was said in certainty.This group was certainly famous ruffians within the Guangchi District, and yet, ruffians still relied on punches and kicks. In front of a real Magician, they weren\u2019t even enough to be called dregs.\u201cHow could he be a Mage!!\u201dXu Bing and the group of people were exceedingly scared by the incredibly shocking scene in front of them.In their perspective, if one could leave a mark after punching a tree, then one would have an incredible existence within the ruffians. However, they have never met someone whose body was enshrouded by a crackling Lightning arcs. Everything within the circumference of a few meters looked just like a destroyed high voltage area. Incorporeal power pressured them, causing their entire bodies to feel numb!\u201cLightning Force, Lightning Strike!\u201dAll the invocations were complete. This time, Mo Fan was genuinely using the Primary rank skill, Lightning Strike!He suddenly raised his arm with his palm, facing the sky.All the trembling Lightning arcs in the surroundings emitted a sharp sound. They were just like a group of elemental warriors in a purple colored armor who had just received a command as they suddenly unsheathed their weapons!\u201cAnnihilate them!\u201d With the unfathomable rage, Mo Fan relied on a feeling to control the Lightning Force that heeded his commands.He ferociously gripped his fist!An arc-like Lightning element emerged and shot toward Xu Bing, who was standing at the very front, as well as towards the muscular man\u2019s location.The Lightning arc came forth from the high altitude. Every strike was like a whip filled with immense power, whipping Xu Bing and the muscular man to the floor. While at the same time, it left behind strands of marks as it continued to whip them on the floor.\u201cPshhhttt~~~~\u201dXu Bing, as well as the muscular man, was beaten down to the floor. Just a while ago, they were still putting on airs but now, in the moment the Lightning Strike fell on them, flesh lacerated from their back, skin burning to a crisp.They wanted to scream out in pain, but not a sound came from them. The Lightning Strike\u2019s strands of power were like small pythons, scurrying around their body. Every time it scurried, one could see Xu Bing and the muscular man twitch in pain.\u201cPudong!!\u201d After feeling this dreadful power, the man with the cigarette was so frightened that he began to kneel on the floor. His body unconsciously began to tremble!The man in the cowboy adornment was completely dumbstruck; it was as though he was turned into a statue.Although the man with headphones was just standing there, without getting hit by the Lightning Strike, his jeans were completely soaked. It even started dripping down on his shoes!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn* * *[1] In Buddhism, you burn fake paper money to thank buddha for the luck or anything god.*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their appearances were too horrible to look at; the insufferably arrogant attitude of the Guangchi District\u2019s ruffians was nowhere to be seen.The other three people were thoroughly scared.\u201cBig\u2026.Mo\u2026..Big Brother Mo Fan\u2026 Seeing\u2026seeing as how we grew up in the same district\u2026could\u2026could you spare us. We\u2026..we will never do this again!!\u201d The man with the cigarette had been so scared that his soul had dispersed. In his eyes, the sixteen-year-old youth in front of him was even scarier than the demons in his nightmares!\u201cYou\u2026you are an honorable Mage.. you don\u2019t need to lower yourself to the same level as dregs like us. I beg of you; don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t do anything to us.\u201d The man in cowboy adornment said with a trembling voice.Seeing the appearances of Xu Bing and the muscular man, it was just too terrifying!The man in cowboy adornments didn\u2019t want to become like them!The whiff of rage accompanied with the completely released Lightning Strike was slowly settling down to the bottom of Mo Fan\u2019s heart.He looked at the miserable Xu Bing and the muscular man and glanced at the other three people who were completely terrified.\u201cTake them to the hospital,\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s said as he calmed down.The truth was even Mo Fan couldn\u2019t imagine that the Primary rank skill of Lightning Element, Lightning Strike would have a might that immense!_This was my first time actually activating it. If I can become even more proficient at it and be able to increase my accuracy in controlling it, I won\u2019t waste a single bit of that scattered energy during the activation. I\u2019m afraid the perfected Lightning Strike would directly cause the five people to die from the explosion._So far, so good, however, there were no casualties out of this or else things would become complicated!\u201cYes, yes, yes! We\u2019ll go; we\u2019ll go now!!\u201d The cowboy looked at this young Mage\u2019s rage settling down; he acted as if he obtained a new life.The other two didn\u2019t dare to think too much about it; they hurriedly supported the two paralyzed people on the ground\u2026The result was, as soon as they touched the two men, the remaining lightning arcs transmitted into their arms from the bodies; causing them to tremble in fear.\u201cCall an ambulance. You\u2019ll handle the medical fees yourselves.\u201d Mo Fan said indifferently.\u201cI\u2019ll call them now; I\u2019ll call them now.\u201dMo Fan\u2019s rage had already dispersed. In fact, his mind still had some enthusiasm which was hard to conceal.Right now, Mo Fan was like a God Killing existence for them; how could he display his extremely joyful appearance to these fools?After walking to the inside of the Pavilion, Mo Fan swept away the cards from the wheelchair. He picked up the wheelchair and followed the stairs back down.These three people were still looking at Mo Fan with fear lingering in their hearts.Suddenly, Mo Fan spun around.The three people were scared and hastily took a step back.\u201cOh right, if someone were to ask, tell them that these two tried to steal electricity. If you dare to spread the matter of me being a Mage, I\u2019ll have you shut up forever. Either way, I heard the police won\u2019t make it difficult for a Mage who accidentally kills someone. Especially the dregs of society who provoked a Mage.\u201d Mo Fan thought of it and turned around to warn these people.The three people nodded their head as though they were pounding garlic; they couldn\u2019t be more obedient.\u201cRegarding Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai, with your IQ, I believe you know what to say, right?\u201d Mo Fan said as he left in a carefree manner.\u201cWe\u2026we didn\u2019t see you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re smart. I\u2019ll think of the matter as done, this time. If there\u2019s anything in the future, you can come and find me. You\u2019ve seen my abilities already.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes! Big Brother Mo Fan, take care.\u201d The three bent over as they nodded their head with fear and reverence.Mo Fan nodded as he picked up the wheelchair and left._First, you need to ruthlessly beat them up, then you give them a little bit of benefit._ Mo Fan believed these lads wouldn\u2019t dare be rash, and believed they wouldn\u2019t spread the word of this matter to the outside.On one side, he has become a Lightning Element Magician that was able to activate his skills. On the other side, it was the Apprentice-level Mu Bai. _I believe these guys understand how to stand for themselves._However, Mo Fan was already clear on the fact that these five people were just lackeys for Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan._When the time comes, I\u2019ll still pay those two bastards back what they deserve._\u2026\u2026Following the stone steps downwards, Mo Fan finally couldn\u2019t help but to laugh out loud.A few years ago, he was just a normal student in a classroom who would occasionally look at the world outside of the window, due to the dullness from the History class. Occasionally, he would also daydream about suddenly being faced with a gust of wind and flying upwards; his foot lightly treading on the flagpole. Soaring through the blue sky and the distant back mountain of the school. He imagined encountering a brute that could cause himself to be thoroughly enraged. When he met fiends and numerous villains, his hands were able to congregate a special force that could directly defeat them.Who would\u2019ve thought that he was able to have a small taste of this today!With the Lightning Force in his hands, the five ruffians who used to bully him became like stray dogs. This has never happened before, and the feeling was fantastic; it was like a dream!\u201cLightning Element, Lightning Strike is indeed impressive. I wonder what kind of power the Fire Element\u2019s \u2018Primary rank skill, Flame Burst\u2019 holds. There\u2019s still half a year before the annual Magic Examination; I should have enough time to grasp the Fire Element\u2019s Primary rank skill, Fire Burst\u2026\u201d Mo Fan got excited._The Lightning element\u2019s primary rank skill, Lightning Strike was indeed ferocious. I wonder how the other element\u2019s skills are._Moreover, Mo Fan knew that the primary rank skills are the lowest type of magic; after the primary, there\u2019s also intermediate and high rank!\u201cRight, right, the Wind element Teacher did mention it during the first class. The Wind Element\u2019s high-rank skill, Wind Wings gives you the ability to soar through the sky\u2026.Damn, if I\u2019m able to learn Wind Wings, then I\u2019d be able to go anywhere!After a long while, Mo Fan was still having difficulties holding down his excitement. His mind was incessantly processing the magic knowledge he learned. He wanted to know what other heaven-defying skills the Mages could be in possession of!\u2026\u2026On the still swing was the long haired, perfectly straight nosed young girl with her head slightly turned upwards. She was carefully observing the pavilion whose view was blocked by trees.\u201cThe purple ray just now\u2026.\u201d Ye Xinxia murmured to herself.She saw a magnificent purple colored light like a remnant of a shooting star flashing by the pavilion. Although it quickly dissipated, it was still an astonishing scene that left a mark in people\u2019s heart.\u201cIs it a Mage?\u201d Ye Xinxia thought to herself.She had a really hard time imagining that there\u2019d be a Mage in a city area this small.However, why would a Mage appear in the same location as Mo Fan and the group of ruffians, and they even used genuine magic!Is Big Brother Mo Fan alright??At this moment, Ye Xinxia was feeling nervous. She subconsciously bit the side of her lip.At last, the familiar figure appeared on the small, stone staircase.

They won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d Mo Fan placed the wheelchair in front of Ye Xinxia.\u201cI just saw\u2026 I saw lightning. It seems to be the primary rank skill of Lightning Element, Lightning Strike.\u201d Ye Xinxia said.As Mo Fan heard this, he began to feel a sense of pride. However, he smiled without saying a word. He used his broken eyes to look at Ye Xinxia.Ye Xinxia felt something wasn\u2019t right; she carefully thought about it before astonishment flashed in her eyes.\u201cThe one activating Lightning Strike was Big Brother Mo Fan??\u201dMo Fan didn\u2019t admit to it; he just stood there with a smile.\u201cIt really was you! Big Brother Mo Fan is a Mage??\u201d Ye Xinxia said with a hint of disbelief.\u201cHaha, you are the first person to witness my true power!\u201d Mo Fan said suddenly with a headstrong tone in before Ye Xinxia\u2019s delicate and cute face.Ye Xinxia didn\u2019t anticipate this sneak attack; her a red flush immediately filled her cheeks; it even reached down to her neck.Only then did Mo Fan realize that he was being a bit too relaxed. He hastily began to explain, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I got a bit too excited.\u201dYe Xinxia replied with a low voice, \u201cThen\u2026did you really become a Mage?\u201dMo Fan nodded.\u201cOur teacher said only one out of a thousand can awaken Lightning element. The primary level of Lightning Element holds a great advantage, so much of it can be said to be the best primary ranked element.\u201d In this moment, Ye Xinxia began to feel happy for Mo Fan.Ye Xinxia was clear on the situation at home, even more so after she became a member of the family and gave Uncle Mo Jiaxing more unnecessary pressure. According to Auntie, Uncle Mo Jiaxing had already sold their house. It seems as if their poverty had reached a definite point.Both her and Mo Fan were still young; it\u2019s difficult for them to help Mo Jiaxing. What Mo Fan could do was study hard and become a genuine Mage; only then would they be able to relieve the current family crisis.It seems like Big Brother Mo Fan was indeed amazing. He had unexpectedly learned Magic in such a short period of time._Eh, that\u2019s not right!_Suddenly, Ye Xinxia came to a realization. She looked at Mo Fan with her beautiful eyes which hinted that she wanted to say something.Mo Fan replied in earnest, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been half a year since you awakened. According to what is known, even people who have a high innate talent require nearly a year to completely activate the primary rank skills.\u201d Ye Xinxia said.Mo Fan was dumbstruck._No way, even people with a high innate talent need nearly a year\u2019s worth of time to go from awakening to activation?__Then\u2026me being able to completely use the primary skills after half a year is indeed a bit too quick!_The thing was, Mo Fan didn\u2019t know anything about this.That blockhead Mu Bai was already able to grasp four or five stars. From how he saw it, wasn\u2019t it normal that he, himself, could already activate Magic?However, why did Ye Xinxia\u2019s surprised face give off the feeling as if she was looking at a Monster?Could it be that being able to learn the Primary rank skill within half a year was an extremely abnormal thing in this world?\u201cThe \u2018Possess a high innate talent\u2019 in \u2018Even someone that possess high innate talent needs a year\u2019, what kind of level does that speak of?\u201d Mo Fan cautiously asked.Mo Fan didn\u2019t want to expose the fact that he knew almost nothing about this world.\u201cMu Ningxue is considered the most talented person within our Bo City. Her talent even surpasses numerous genius-level students in the Empire; however, she needed eight months to go from the awakening to learning the Ice Element\u2019s primary skill.\u201d Ye Xinxia said.\u201cEight\u2026..eight months?\u201d Mo Fan felt a bit stunned when he heard this.What kind of existence was Mu Ningxue?She was the only person who was directly recruited by the Empire Institution in the entirety of Bo City. She\u2019s also the most beloved person of the entire Mu Clan; she had received the entire Mu Clan\u2019s inherited magic training methods. The kind of resources which a common Mage would never receive in their entire life.The reason behind her being viewed as an important figure, as well as her astonishing Magic talent, was closely related to that!Even an extremely arrogant person like her needed eight months to go from awakening to the activation of Primary Magic. What about Mo Fan, who only needed five months?Holy crap!!HOLY CRAP!!!!!!Mo Fan felt his heart viciously surging!If Mu Ningxue shocked the world with eight months and was classified as a heavenly genius by the people, wouldn\u2019t his own five months be completely heaven-defying?!?!\u201cBig Brother Mo Fan, you\u2026.did you learn something bad?\u2026.. I heard from an old scholar that this kind of cultivation speed is only possible with people from the Black Church,\u201d Ye Xinxia whispered.The Black Church had some Demonic Magic Method that could substantially raise a Mage\u2019s cultivation speed. Ye Xinxia really couldn\u2019t think of any other way that could allow someone to complete Primary Magic in just a short five months, even though Ye Xinxia knew her Big Brother Mo Fan\u2019s intelligence surpasses others\u2026.\u201cThe Black Church? How is that possible\u2026 Is, is that so? Oh, right, I actually didn\u2019t awaken on the day of Opening Ceremony. I got to know an old man way before that; he told me \u2018Kid, I see that your bones are unusually good; your talent exceeds others. Why don\u2019t you let me teach you magic?\u2019 and at that time, I asked who he was. He told me was a member of the Magic City\u2019s Magic Association. He could help me awaken in advance\u2026 In short, I actually didn\u2019t learn Magic in five months.\u201d Mo Fan reacted by quickly explaining this.As Ye Xinxia listened to his explanation, she became confused.However, she still replied with a big smile, \u201cOh, so you actually awakened in advance. Awakening too early would cause side effects to the cultivation, however, if it\u2019s the people from the Magic Association, then there shouldn\u2019t be any large issues.\u201dAs Mo Fan saw that Ye Xinxia no longer asked any questions, he finally sighed in relief._Shit, I really am a monster. It seems like I shouldn\u2019t reveal too many things before I completely understand this world._\u201cIs it true,t it\u2019s only those from The Black Church that can finish their cultivation in five months?\u201d Mo Fan asked faintly.\u201cYes,\u201d Ye Xinxia nodded in sincerity.Mo Fan felt cold sweat!Being too amazing wasn\u2019t a good thing. Originally, Mo Fan wanted to surprise Ye Xinxia with the fact that he also possessed the Fire Element, however, now it seemed like it would be better to not be reckless while he still hadn\u2019t understood the circumstances._I should go back and consult the books first and fully understand the situation, just to have some warranty. If not, I\u2019ll be branded as someone from the Black Church and then be dealt with!_* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the kind of feeling that was like playing League of Legends for three days straight without sleep in a Internet Cafe; It was as though his entire being was about to drop dead!_What kind of situation is this??__It\u2019s the feeling of having a low Spirit.__Is it because I used Lightning Strike twice today? Is it due to Lightning Element\u2019s Magic being excessively used that lead to me feeling spiritually fatigued?__Is there a mistake? If we count in the time in the bus where I didn\u2019t completely activate it, then I\u2019ve only used Lightning Strike twice today, and that caused my damn mana to be completely drained?__Originally, I thought spending five months worth of time to meditate would cause the magic capacity within my star dust to be tremendous. Who would\u2019ve thought that using Lightning Strike twice would cause the entire Lightning element star dust to feel completely dismal?_The Lightning element\u2019s star dust used to be gorgeous and colorful within the Spiritual world. The purple radiance reflected by the seven stars were like a beautiful painting of the starry sky. However, right now, the star dust lost its radiance as it sunk into the darkness.At first, Mo Fan was slightly scared. Fortunately, after he loosened up and started to rest, the Lightning star dust began to slowly recover its radiance, although very slowly!\u201cIt seems like the star dust isn\u2019t bright enough. Every time I use magic, the star dust will lose a bit of its radiance. When the star dust is completely dark, it means the energy within it has been completely used up.The star dust contains Magic energy.No wonder why the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, would stress all day, saying, \u201cEven if it\u2019s boring, you still need to maintain meditation. If a talented Mage doesn\u2019t diligently meditate, they could become mediocre.These words could basically mean, \u201cSo what if your skill is incredible? If you don\u2019t have the mana then you\u2019re just a dreg!\u201d_Forget it, let\u2019s not think about this. I should hurry up and sleep or else I\u2019ll really pass out!_\u2026\u2026As he was holing up in his room, he slept until dawn.Ye Xinxia was lovable. It was almost noon, yet she didn\u2019t wake him up.Mo Fan got out of his bed feeling energetic.He easily entered a meditative state and scanned his own star dust. He discovered that most of the stardust was shining brightly. It\u2019d probably completely recover its former radiance very soon.\u201cOh right, I shouldn\u2019t reveal my Lightning element to outsiders. Although this is a society governed by law, it could still cause people to be jealous. An example would be the Mu Family which is capable of covering the heavens with the point of a finger. It seems like I still need to cultivate the Fire element, this way it\u2019d be easier to fool other people.\u201d Mo Fan brushed his teeth as he pondered over this question._However, I only have so much energy in a single day. How can I cultivate the Lightning element while I cultivate the Fire element as well?_The reason as to why Mo Fan was able to activate the Lightning element\u2019s skill in just a mere five months was because he spent all of his cultivation time on the Lightning element. No matter how fascinating and charming the Fire element was, Mo Fan still remained single-minded toward the Lightning element._The annual Magic examination is in roughly half a year. If I want don\u2019t want to reveal the Lightning element\u2019s power this early, then I ought to concentrate all of my attention on cultivating the Fire element in the next school semester and reach the point where I can activate the primary skill of Fire element.__Although, if I were to do this, then that\u2019d mean the progress of Lightning element would be at a standstill for half a year.__I need to meditate. The star dust won\u2019t become stronger without a reason!_\u2026\u2026Mo Fan made a few adjustments to his meditation schedule.There was a bit more than six months left before the annual Magic Examination. Mo Fan planned to distribute ten hours of what he could handle every day; Eight hours on cultivating the Fire element and two hours to gently grow the Lightning element.This way, the Lightning element\u2019s growth may be very slow, but it will at least maintain his proficiency in \u2018Control\u2019.Spending eight hours every day to cultivate the Fire element was already much greater compared to students who were only capable of meditating for five hours.\u2026\u2026His aunt, Mo Qing came back home from work during lunch.Aunt Mo Qing is the most normal woman ever; she\u2019s thin with a yellow face, and she was a very good person.\u201cMo Fan you\u2019re back! I\u2019ve heard from your dad that you\u2019re fully concentrating on cultivating at Tian Lan Magic High. You must really do your best! If you are able to become a Primary Mage, then you\u2019d bring honor to the ancestors of our Mo Family!\u201d Mo Qing said._A Primary Mage and I\u2019d be bringing honor to the ancestors??__How many generations have we been poor?!__Sigh, I don\u2019t know if I am ready!_\u201cWhere\u2019s your husband, why haven\u2019t I seen him around?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cHe\u2019s delivering goods to the hunters in the mountains. I really don\u2019t understand how a normal person like him could possibly have the courage to go into the mountains. If he were to encounter a Magical Beast, it could swallow him in one gulp!\u201d Mo Qing complained.\u201cAren\u2019t the Magical Beasts in the Primitive Mountains quite a distance from our city?\u201d Mo Fan said.This world was different from the world he was familiar with. Outside of the city, in the Magic World resided numerous Magical Beasts that threaten the lives of humankind. Not even to mention, common people were afraid of setting food in those areas; even Magicians tended to lose their lives out there.\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen the warning issued by the Hunter\u2019s Union? Recently, the Magical Beast have gotten restless. There have many been signs of Magical Beasts emerging outside of our Bo City; thus, they have especially been warning the normal folks to not take a step outside of the safety zones.\u201d Mo Qing said.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit too much?\u201d Mo Fan said with a smile.Although Mo Fan was new to this, he still read a lot of books. The Magical Beasts are generally far away from the cities where humans reside; moreover, there were renowned organisations like the Magic Association, Hunter\u2019s Union, and large Magic Families who cleaned up on a regular basis to ensure the safety of the people within the city.\u201cYou\u2019ve studied so much that you\u2019ve become dumb. Think about it, which Mayor doesn\u2019t want their city to prosper in peace? Even if Magical Beasts were to invade, they would still say the situation is under their control in order to avert panic\u2026.The truth is, there have always been Magical Beasts in the vicinity of the city; there are even some within the city. It\u2019s just we, the common people, don\u2019t really see them.\u201d Mo Qing whispered.Mo Fan was surprised as he heard this, but he still said with a forced smile, \u201cAunt, you\u2019re too paranoid.\u201d\u201cLittle boy, you still won\u2019t believe me. Then, let me tell you something that actually happened. This happened; don\u2019t say that your aunt loves listening to gossip all day\u2026You should know that I work in the hospital\u2019s logistics department.\u201d\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Mo Fan nodded.Fortunately, Mo Qing didn\u2019t say she was working at some Sacred Institution, or else Mo Fan\u2019s balls would really hurt as he wouldn\u2019t know anything.\u201cThere was an evening where I went to deliver medicine for wounds to the doctor in charge. However, there was a person in the operation room who seemed to be a Healing element Mage. He chewed out our Dr. Wang saying, \u201cEven if you are a Healing element Apprentice, you shouldn\u2019t be so stupid to not know how to differentiate poison marsh and poison water. Also, these people are under a Demonic spell which is why they look lifeless\u2026 Go, go, go, don\u2019t be a burden here. Go find the people from the Hunter\u2019s Union and have them find the Evil-eyed marsh beast, or else there\u2019ll be more injured people in this area!\u201d Mo Qing moved closer. She spoke with a very cautious tone to Mo Fan.As Mo Fan saw Mo Qing\u2019s expression; he didn\u2019t feel like she was making things up._Don\u2019t tell me the Magical Beasts are actually so close to the city, with some being within the city?_This is quite scary. Magical Beasts were monsters that eat people; if you were to come across one, then death would certainly be imminent!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: Fluffygoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He kept saying that the Hunter Squad lost some supplies while they were following the tracks of a One-eyed Magical Wolf and that he had to personally deliver it. He\u2019s just a logistics employee, yet, he even has the guts to do this kind of life-threatening work. Your dad, no matter what I told him, still wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d Mo Qing answered.\u201cMy dad went as well?\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s face immediately changed.\u201cYeah, they said it would pay a lot. Even Mage Apprentices are too afraid to receive their call, yet, these two normal people\u2026. If nothing happens, then that\u2019s fine. However, if something really were to happen, what\u2019ll happen to us?\u201d Mo Qing said.\u201cAuntie, don\u2019t worry. They must\u2019ve considered this already; there won\u2019t be any problems. They\u2019re just delivering it to a designated outpost, and the roads from the city to the outpost are still within the safe zone,\u201d Ye Xinxia said from the side.\u201cEither way, I just wish the two would just obediently do their job within the city. I get worried when they leave the city,\u201d Mo Qing whispered once again.After hearing Mo Qing\u2019s complaints, Mo Fan began to have a bad feeling.Father hasn\u2019t come to my school to see me for the past six months. It turns out he picked a different road; he went to deliver goods to the Hunter Magicians patrolling outside. This job is indeed very dangerous compared to his former job where he\u2019d only deliver goods to wealthy people.\u2026\u2026Although it\u2019s winter break, Mo Fan wasn\u2019t free at all. After staying at Auntie\u2019s place for a few days, Mo Fan returned to Tian Lan Magic High\u2019s library.The library had the information he needed to replenish, for example, the Black Church which he missed out on.Mo Fan understood what kind of thing the Black Church was after reading about it.Those guys are similar to the terror organizations; a large, Evil cult. They frequently did things that would harm the safety of the people. Additionally, for the sake of their own goals, they would even use living people as cultivation material. The country was not lenient on insane things like that, naturally!In the coming month, Mo Fan wholeheartedly meditated.After knowing the Lightning element\u2019s stardust would dry up and turn completely dark after only using Lightning Strike twice, Mo Fan began to understand the importance of meditation.Thus, this entire month, despite how great the temptation of activating Fire element\u2019s skill, Fire Burst, Mo Fan didn\u2019t rashly try to come in contact with Fire element\u2019s star. He must solidify his foundation first.As he was engrossed in meditation and treated all of this as a habit, the time passed very quickly.Soon enough, it became the start of the school again.Inside the library, Mo Fan swept off the cobwebs that covered his body; ready to meet the new magic school term.In a high spirit, Mo Fan walked into the classroom and sat down in a seat at the very back, just like always.\u201cEh?\u201dThere\u2019s something wrong today.Mo Fan looked at Zhang Xiaohou next to him and discovered this lad didn\u2019t look alright.Normally, this guy\u2019s expression would be just like a curious little monkey, a clever one. Moreover, he would incessantly tell Mo Fan about his past few days during class.Today, however, his eyes looked dull, his mouth was slightly open, and his face was filled with an unfathomable intoxicated gaze as he looked toward the front.As he looked around his surroundings, the two study wrecks, Xu Qinglin and Lu Xiaobing were showing the same expression; it was as though they were being possessed!Shit, don\u2019t tell me what Auntie said really is true. There is a One-eyed Magical Wolf within the city and these lads have all been infected by it!\u201cGood morning class, the teacher for your Practical Magic class has fallen ill and is currently at home recuperating. From today on, I will be in charge of everyone\u2019s Practical Magic classes. My name is Tangyue!\u201d A mature, beautiful and bright sound resounded.After being accustomed to the hoarse and slow voice of an old man, the sudden appearance of a mature woman\u2019s voice with a charming and the sexy tune swept past like the spring wind brushing the grounds; this caused the slightly tired Mo Fan to immediately wake up!He raised his head as he searched for the origins of the voice with expectation. Mo Fan\u2019s eyes were starstruck and his expression appeared enchanted.What the hell, who cares about the Evil-eyed Marsh Monster that can confuse people\u2019s hearts? It\u2019s evident that the souls of the males with the exuberant hormones were attracted by this newly arrived, extraordinarily beautiful female teacher.This teacher, Tangyue, wore a standard, black suit. In between the outer black suit and the white shirt on the inside were a bulging, majestic, and glamorous mountain peaks that were about to burst. This made Mo Fan wonder whether the little buttons on the chest was really capable of holding up this turbulent wave.Annoying, this really is annoying._The early morning has always been the time where the young men are at their most violent. As they were stimulated like this, I reckon the majority will have a rather shameful appearance._\u201cIt\u2019s been half a year since you awakened, and there\u2019s not a single person who has been able to use their magic. However, I hope you understand that being able to control an immense power does not signify that you know how to use it. If you don\u2019t properly control your powers, then they\u2019ll backfire on you,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue quickly entered her teaching state.Originally, the teacher\u2019s earnest and solemn attitude caused many little tyrants to come back to their senses. Who would\u2019ve known that the second she turned around after writing some important segments on the blackboard, the entire class would get nosebleeds?What a disaster. Bulging and round, Mo Fan was definitely a normal male student. At this moment, the exact same scene came to his head.Ahem!How could one let one\u2019s imagination run wild in a sacred school? Either way, Mo Fan wholeheartedly wanted to study; Mo Fan was definitely not the same as this group of people who only thought with their lower body. _In any case, I definitely won\u2019t wear tight pants to the Practical Magic classes again. Not every organism is capable of being like a climbing tiger; move around the obstacle and continue what they\u2019re doing._The Practical Magic classes went on for the entire morning. After finishing theory, Tangyue brought everyone to the field; personally showing everyone the essential keys to Magic Activation.Mo Fan also earnestly listened to this class; for example, what Mrs. Tangyue had said concerning the Magic Activation Link, Mo Fan have already experienced it. It\u2019s just, he didn\u2019t understand how the buttons on the front of Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s chest were so durable; it\u2019s been so long yet they still hadn\u2019t burst?Naturally, the school field isn\u2019t supposed to be used for radio calisthenics.The field was actually just the practice grounds, they had been divided into several independent spaces using a Magic Barrier which Mo Fan didn\u2019t understand. All the overflowing power would be absorbed by the transparent barrier; this was to prevent harming the students who didn\u2019t have any kind of ability.\u201cLook closely; I will demonstrate the primary skill of Fire element, Fire Burst!\u201d Tangyue stood in the middle of the students.The students assembled into a half arc, scattered behind Mrs. Tangyue. Whether everyone really was watching Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s hand seals was something that no one was sure of.\u201cFire Burst, it\u2019s the skill of Fire element. Brother Mo Fan\u2026.wipe your saliva, it\u2019s your element\u2019s skill. Never did I think that Mrs. Tangyue, who looks so tender and virtuous, would actually be a Fire Mage!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou nudged the Mo Fan beside him.\u201cOh, oh, I want to learn this!\u201d Only then did Mo Fan come back to his senses.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: Fluffygoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her elegant, curvy physique outlined the slightly tight skirt which people felt was particularly moving. Perhaps it was because she was new to teaching, that was why her selection of clothing seemed a bit too hasty, resulting in this. This really gave the students a feast for their eyes.\u201cYou have to meditate, be tranquil, and concentrate. Even if I am speaking to you right now, my mentality is wholeheartedly concentrated on the Fire element nebula within me\u2026oh, I mean star dust.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said.Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s voice was transmitted to every student\u2019s ears. When everyone thought Mrs. Tangyue was standing still as a statue, a sudden fluctuation could be seen from her pear blossom hair.There was not a single thread of wind in the field, however, her hair looked as though she was on a steamer, causing it to scatter around!\u201cControl, at this moment, you need to call out so your star can obey your commands and open the doors of the Fire element Magic!!\u201d Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s tone changed from its usual softness to a solemn one; it carried a hint of an arrogance which stated that everything should burn down before her.In this instant, all the males, with their heads filled with dirty thoughts, immediately became dumbstruck.Their eyes widened as they looked at this beautiful female teacher with shock.Aura!!That\u2019s right; they felt a scorching aura emitting from Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s body; swelling over everyone\u2019s faces.There was shock, reverence, and a certain intimidating presence that prevented people from having any form of wicked thoughts!Everyone initially thought the newly arrived Mrs. Tangyue would be your average teacher; be able to give everyone a messy theory lesson just like the old guy before her. When it came to them being able to personally activate Magic, there might even be a mistake in what she taught. However, the young Tangyue in front of them seemed have been able to control this power for a very, very long time. She was able to teach while she controlled the star. After she finished her magic incantations, the emerging fire\u2019s intensity was on a completely different level compared to the old man. It was like comparing a small fire to a pillar of flames!\u201cRemember, after you\u2019ve finished the arrangement of the stars, you can\u2019t relax your thoughts. You must immediately focus on the position of your activation!\u201dThat dignified voice resounded once more.\u201cSearing Flames!\u201dThe sound was like a magical bell, ringing inside everyone\u2019s mind.While at the same time, a dazzling scarlet red Star Path emerged around Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s body before it quickly condensed within her jade-like right hand.Following this, a fiery red power rapidly grew on her half gripped hands; it was incomparably violent!With all of her might, she used her arm to throw it!The flame shot out like an arrow and gave off a scarlet red delicacy. After that, it became like a bullet, accurately and unmistakably penetrating the body of the puppet!\u201cGone?\u201d\u201cHow come nothing happened?\u201d\u201cIt hit the target though.\u201dThe atmosphere grew silent for a period of time. The puppet which was hit by Fire Burst didn\u2019t have any kind of reaction while Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s aura was the complete opposite.Within the confusion, Mrs. Tangyue slowly turned around and faced the entire 48 students of the class with her somewhat young and tender face; however, the corner of her mouth gave off a smirking smile that displayed her high self-confidence.WHEEEEEEWWW!!!!!Suddenly, a shocking scarlet red burst forth from the within of the puppet. It absolutely was not one of those slow ignitions; it was a violent flutter. It looked like something that was able to burn everything in one breath.The intact human-like puppet from just now was engulfed by a scarlet red flame in just an instant!!!Was it one second or two?The fire everyone knew of usually fluttered about; however, this flame was hungry like a wild beast swallowing food. It hadn\u2019t even been two seconds before the entire human shaped puppet was completely engulfed into nothingness.The gaudy scarlet light reflected in Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s beautiful pear blossom hair. Her fair-skinned face was increasingly captivating at the moment.The smile from the corner of her mouth, along with the reckless fire behind her back, enhanced the already stunningly beautiful teacher. There was one way to describe this appearance: unrealistically beautiful!All 48 students of the class were completely starstruck.Mo Fan didn\u2019t know how other people felt about this, but he felt his own heart throbbing. Not only because this teacher was beautiful and charming, but when she wore the power of the flames, her body exuded a grandeur confidence his own blood rose, accompanied by worship, infatuation, and reverence!If a woman is only beautiful, she\u2019ll cause men to have a wild imagination. However, this woman had grasped the authority and power which other people were unable to touch upon. This woman was like poison; men were just unable to free themselves from her!Only the heavens knew how many guys have set Mrs. Tangyue as their Goddess for life after seeing this scene. Even Mo Fan was completely subdued by her temperament.Although they were both teachers in Practical Magic, the old man\u2019s Magic Activation was lifeless; it caused the people watching to feel drowsy.Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s activation caused people to engrave it on to their hearts, making them feel excited and unable to calm themselves.They were on completely different levels!!\u201cAlright, who are the Fire element students in our class? Let me note them down.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue seemed to regard the gazes of worship from students as something normal as she continued to teach her class.\u201cI\u2019m a Fire element user,\u201d a girl whose face carried a heroic spirit took the initiative and stood up; she was Zhoumin, who gave rise to small disturbances during the opening ceremony.Zhoumin\u2019s eyes were constantly fixated on Mrs. TangyueIn fact, Zhoumin didn\u2019t like her in the beginning. How could there be a teacher who would wear clothes that attracted this much attention and possessed a voice so gentle and beautiful?!However, after seeing Mrs. Tangyue finish a Flame Burst, Zhoumin\u2019s heart did a complete 180, and her heart gave birth to a sense of worship.Zhoumin\u2019s mother was also a teacher. However, she was sure that her own mother was unable to do the same thing as Mrs. Tangyue. Whether it was the aura, intensity, accuracy, or the power!\u201cI am! I am one too, Mrs. Tangyue! I am also a Fire element user!! My name is Huang Feifeng,\u201d the other male student who had awakened the Fire element jumped out._Look at this Huang Feifeng\u2019s excited expression\u2026_Who didn\u2019t know that if the Practical Magic teacher had the same element as you, then it\u2019d be like having a small stove, with the master passing useful things on to their disciples[a]?Huang Feifeng felt extremely lucky. He had unexpectedly become Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s disciple. _Who could say if Mrs. Tangyue would appreciate his talent in the future and give birth to feelings toward him; she was his own Little Dragon Maiden!_ _[1]_\u201cDon\u2019t stand in my way; I\u2019m going to the roof. Why didn\u2019t I awaken the Fire element, why?!\u201d Lu Xiaobing, who awakened the Water element, was making loud noises as he cried.\u201cTea\u2026 teacher, I am also a fire\u2026 fire element user. My, my name is Zhao Daniu,\u201d a little man who stuttered stood up. As his eyes met Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s, his face turned completely red.Mo Fan sighed, _you could tell with one glance that it was just an average beansprout that no one cared for._As Mrs. Tangyue looked at this little man, she chuckled as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re clearly very thin and weak. Why did your family name you \u2018Big Cow\u2019[2]\u201d\u201cMy\u2026 my body is weak. Father and mother\u2026 father and mother wish\u2026 wished for me to become sturdy, like a big cow.\u201d\u201cThen you should be named Zhao Blabbermouth,\u201d Zhao Kunsan and his clever mouth immediately mocked.What Zhao Kunsan was mocking was naturally, Zhao Daniu\u2019s stutter.\u201cHm, are there more?\u201d Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s gaze swept over.\u201cThere\u2019s only three Fire element users in a single class?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too little.\u201dJudging by their aura, it seemed like there was only the girl called Zuo Zhoumin whose talent was slightly better, and her cultivation pace was also not bad.\u201cThere\u2019s also me; my name is Mo Fan,\u201d Mo Fan came back to his senses and walked out from the crowd of people.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn* * *[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongn%C3%BC[2] Da Niu in Chinese is big cow[a] T his is a Chinese idiom meant to say that having a teacher with the same discipline as you is a special boon in that they can pass down useful items (and knowledge) since their focuses align.*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While she was probing Mo Fan\u2019s aura, her lips couldn\u2019t help but open up.\u201cMo Fan, you sure have the guts to stand up. A school semester has gone by, yet you haven\u2019t been able to control a single Fire element star. Your star is still dark, so much so that you can\u2019t even see it yet; don\u2019t try to act like you\u2019re something!\u201d Zhao Kunsan immediately said.There was a test during the end of the last semester. This test was to check the tempo of the student\u2019s cultivation. There were definitely no accidents occurring; Mo Fan\u2019s star dust wasn\u2019t any different from when he first awakened it. The entire class knew this, and that totally did not cause Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai laughter!If you\u2019re an idiot, then you\u2019re an idiot. So what if he awakened the Fire element? He would never become a Mage in his entire lifetime.\u201cYour talent in the Fire element is very good, so how come your cultivation is so low? Mo Fan, there are numerous people who wish to become a Fire Magician, and you already have an advantage which many people don\u2019t. You must put in the effort.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue looked at Mo Fan as she said in pity.\u201cI understand, Mrs. Tangyue.\u201d Mo Fan nodded.After going through meditation, a Magician\u2019s Spiritual Force would become powerful. Its power would reach the point where they were able to perceive details which normal people couldn\u2019t. They would also be able to perceive the aura of another Mage.Through the aura\u2019s intensity, one could roughly determine a Magician\u2019s cultivation level.Mo Fan knew from the start it wasn\u2019t possible to hide his cultivation.However, there was this one thing. If Mo Fan were to conceal the power of the Lightning element and only reveal the aura of the Fire element, then others would only be able to sense the Fire element\u2019s aura. Thus, they were only able to determine the Fire element\u2019s cultivation level while being unable to sense the other element.That was why Mo Fan could normally just use the Fire element to fool other people!\u201cThe second I wanted to focus on the Fire element, an amazing Fire element teacher suddenly appeared at my door. It seems like there\u2019s hope for me to complete the activation of the primary skill, Fire Burst, before the big examination.\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s confidence immediately increased._Eh?__Why is this woman looking at me with an odd expression?_It seems like she\u2019s called Zhoumin, the top student in the class and also a Fire element user.Mo Fan was puzzled. _I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever offended this girl, Zhoumin, so why is she looking at me with such a hostile gaze?_On the other side, Zhou Min brows creased. Seeing the study wreck called Mo Fan looking at her, she immediately and ferociously glared at him.Zhoumin was unhappy, extremely unhappy._What qualifications does Mo Fan have to possess a better talent in Fire element than me?_The homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, once said Mo Fan\u2019s talent in Fire element was the best in the entire class. During the awakening, the flames were very clear, and now, this extremely amazing Mrs. Tangyue also commented on how his talent was good._Forget it, there\u2019s no need to get angry over this kind of study wreck. Either way, when the annual examination comes and he doesn\u2019t meet the qualifications, he\u2019ll be asked to leave school. This guy will have one last half year of leisure.__I just really don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s obvious that his family situation isn\u2019t good, they sacrificed everything just so he could enter the Tian Lan Magic High. Yet, after awakening the Fire element, he\u2019s decadent and lazy; how is he able to face his family? Did a dog eat his consciousness?_Thanks to Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai, the entire class basically knew that Mo Fan was squeezed into the class.\u201cYour homeroom teacher has already spoken to me about the importance of the Annual Examination. First, if you don\u2019t meet the requirements, then you\u2019ll be asked to leave the school. Second, they\u2019ll divide you into different classes based on your grades. If you\u2019re placed in the Elite class, then you\u2019ll obtain certain benefits that will give you an advantage on the Magic University\u2019s exams. Thus, this school semester, everyone should have no reason to not put in their utmost effort,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said to everyone.\u201cMrs. Tangyue, will you be teaching the Elite class?\u201d A male student asked.\u201cYeah, if everything goes according to the plans, I will be assigned to be the Practical Magic teacher for the Elite class after I\u2019ve finished teaching you,\u201d Tangyue slightly nodded her head.\u201cTeacher, I, Yangguo\u2026oh, I, Huang Feifeng will definitely do my best!\u201d\u201cMrs. Tangyue, I want to follow you in the future as well.\u201dTangyue maintained a gentle smile as she could tell that her first class today was pretty successful. The student\u2019s passion for studying has been lifted.\u201cOh right, when any of you are able to control seven stars, then you can come and find me in private. I will take some time off of my schedule to teach you some more,\u201d Tangyue continued.Clamor!A wolf howl suddenly resounded from the class.Seven stars, it suddenly became the striving objective for everyone.\u201cI\u2019m not too far from seven stars, Mrs. Tangyue, wait for me\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you for real? How many can you control?\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d\u201cI can do 3, that\u2019s better than you dregs!\u201d Huang Feifeng said with his face filled with pride.\u201cThree stars and you still have the face to stand here and act arrogant. I\u2019m almost at 4; don\u2019t you know that it gets harder as you progress?\u201d Xu Qinglin asked in disdain.\u201cThat\u2019s funny, real funny. You groups of wastes, Mu Bai is already in control of five stars. In the next semester, he could spend three days fishing and two days browsing the internet and he\u2019s still able to reach seven stars. The first one to work with Mrs. Tangyue will definitely be Mu Bai.\u201d Zhao Kunsan immediately said in ridicule.\u201cShit, Mu Bai is that amazing?\u201d\u201cFive\u2026.five stars, how did he cultivate like that? That\u2019s too amazing!\u201d\u201cI heard that the most amazing student in the school, the 7th class\u2019s Lightning student, has only been able to control five as well.\u201dFeeling the discussion surrounding him, Mu Bai felt his entire being beginning to float.However, in order to show his mature and collected temperament, Mu Bai wouldn\u2019t expose his approval for the compliments towards him. That would just make him look like a complete douche.This guy, Zhao Kunsan, he was a little stupid, and he was not reliable when it came to doing things. However, there was one thing that was very good about him; when the Master wants attention, yet can\u2019t display it, Zhao Kunsan would jump in with the right timing._It\u2019s not like I can personally jump out and say \u201cThis daddy can already control five\u201d every time someone is discussing three or two stars and then get shocked by four stars. That\u2019d be cheap, too cheap; it doesn\u2019t conform with the temperament of being the young master of my family. If we put it in Zhao Kunsan\u2019s words; It fits perfectly well._This way he could show everyone he was amazing, and not diminish his manners!_Life is like playing League of Legends; not only do you have to be good at it, it is also very important for teammates to know how to conform to you!_* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was not a single cloud that could be seen for thousands of miles. The nap he took felt the same as the one with which he crossed worlds, a strange gust with the black clouds covering the entire sky. As it became evening, the torrential rain and wind became ice-cold.\u201cIs there a storm coming? This crap weather\u2026It is randomly happening all year round; it becomes whatever season it wants without skipping a beat!\u201d Zhang Xiahou complained from within the dorms.\u201cZhang Xiaohou, aren\u2019t you a Wind element user? Come, you should go out into the storm and see if you can activate the primary skill of Wind element, Wind Trail.\u201d Lu Xiaobing from the same dorm said.\u201cDon\u2019t you freaking have the Water element; why aren\u2019t you going out and showing the Water Barrier, oh magnificent Water Magician. You\u2019re still using an umbrella when you go out; aren\u2019t you ashamed when you go out?\u201dLu Xiaobing\u2019s face turned pale.Truly, A Water element Magician should technically have a wind jacket in the rain.The problem is, it\u2019s almost time for the Annual Examination. Lu Xiaobing could only control four stars; thus, there was still quite a distance from him being able to activate the Water element skill, Water Barrier.\u201cZhang Xiaohou, can you really use Wind Trail? Why don\u2019t you show us? The truth is, other than seeing that violent girl, Zhoumin, using Fire Burst, we haven\u2019t seen anyone else in class use proper magic.\u201d The dorm head, who talked about his lewd thoughts about Mrs. Tangyue every day, said.\u201cIt\u2019s not going so well; I can\u2019t guarantee the 100% succession.\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said with a slight shyness.\u201cMonkey, show it to us. I also wanna see what the Wind element skill looks like,\u201d Mo Fan eyes beamed as he put down the theory book in his hands.\u201cThe place is too small.\u201d\u201cUse the hallway; the hallway is long enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay, let me try. But I\u2019m really not proficient at it,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou nodded his head.It\u2019s already the end of the term, and Zhang Xiaohou had quite the talent. He was one of the very small number of people in the class that could control seven stars.Everyone was curious about the skills of every element; naturally, they also wanted to see Zhang Xiaohou used his.Zhang Xiaohou closed his eyes and began to enter the activation state.He was really slow; it was clear that he wasn\u2019t very good at controlling the stars.He maintained the rhythm of his breathing, and the breathing was audible.Whooosh.Suddenly, the books on the table began to move.The dormitory\u2019s old doors began to creak.The dust on the floor began to rise, and swirled the dirty underwear beneath the bed. As the boss of the dormitory was about to grab it, the underwear elegantly avoided his hands and floated unrestricted in the wind!\u201cWind Trail, Fast stride!\u201dZhang Xiaohou\u2019s entire temperament changed; an azure color emerged within his eyes as his lapel began to brandish.Along with his incantations, the toothbrush, cups, and clothing racks clattering about. They were all moving according to the trail.Mo Fan quickly composed himself to watch this scene. From these pieces of junk and the swirling dust, he surprisingly discovered an unusual air stream in the dormitory. This stream of air originated from Zhang Xiahou\u2019s location; it spread all the way from the hall to the other side of the hallway\u2019s public toilet.Swoosh!!Suddenly, Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s figure disappeared.The former unmoving Zhang Xiaohou standing in the center of the dormitory became as though he used the Ripple Tiny Steps; the speed was as fast as a whirlwind as he frantically charged out of his dorm and followed the indiscernible Wind Track in the air that went toward the toilet at the end of the hallway!\u201cThat\u2019s awesome!!\u201d Lu Xiaobing yelled out.The group of people in the dormitory immediately squeezed themselves out the door and chased after Zhang Xiaohuo.However, as everyone exited their dorms, Zhang Xiaohou had already quickly shifted from the left side of the hallway to the very end of the hall.Too fast!Any 100-meter sprinter\u2019s speed would be pathetic compared to this movement!Mo Fan\u2019s felt a ripple in his heart. The Wind Element\u2019s primary skill was also really cool; the feeling of stepping onto the Wind Track must be amazing.\u201cHelp, help!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou called out.Peng!!!The hallway suddenly trembled. As Mo Fan just finished his envying sigh, the Zhang Xiaohou in the distance hit the door of the public toilet.People began to laugh at him.The crooked faucet began to spray wildly, and a part of the toilet door was broken. A strong and fishy stink quickly spread out throughout the entire floor as there now was no door to prevent the smell. In a split second, cursing voices were heard.The Wind Track finally dissipated. Zhang Xiahou was laying on the ground with his nose bleeding.This appearance was already pretty miserable. Unfortunately, the underwear that followed the flow of the wind lost the wind force and finally landed the poor guy\u2019s face.Lu Xiaobing and the dorm head hastily dragged Zhang Xiaohou back to his dorm.The dorm head took back his underwear and opened it to find a blood stain.\u201cDorm head, I didn\u2019t know you also had menstruation periods,\u201d Lu Xiaobing cracked up.\u201cGet outta here,\u201d The dorm head reluctantly threw his beloved underwear into the bin.Mo Fan silently retracted his head and returned to his bed before the residence manager charged over in a fury; he acted as though nothing had ever happened.The Wind Element\u2019s skill seems good. This movement speed was not any slower than the that of a car. It\u2019s just Zhang Xiaohou hasn\u2019t met the standards; thus, he didn\u2019t know how to pull over and stop.\u201cYou group of brats. The annual examination is near, and you still aren\u2019t properly meditating; instead, you\u2019re here doing these things. If I see this happening again, I\u2019ll skin you alive!\u201d the residence manager\u2019s roar spread across the entire hallway in this wind and rain.\u2026\u2026The annual examination had finally arrived, and for a lot of people, today was a nightmare. This was because there was a chance that they would be expelled from the school, and these people counted as the most tragic and most shameless who had to go back and meet their parents.However, studying Magic was not a child\u2019s game. Every Magic High\u2019s system worked like this: if you were not suited to study Magic, then you would be expelled early, giving them another way so they wouldn\u2019t continue to waste their time in the borderless Magic sea.To those students who had been doing their best in cultivating, today was the day they could show their results. Particularly for those students who could already use their skills!The stormy days had already passed. The morning\u2019s weather was sunny, and the summer air was clear.Within the Mu Manor\u2026Mu Bai specifically wore a white t-shirt with plum embroidery and ironed trousers. His entire being gave off a low profile feeling, not wanting to show off his family background.With his handsome exterior and his low profiled outfit that didn\u2019t fail to show his elegance, he had already captured the affection of many girls.However, with him being a legitimate member of the Mu Family, how could he fancy any of these common and vulgar women. His objective was a proud girl like Mu Ningxue\u2026.Of course, if Mrs. Tangyue were willing to give in, he would be willing as well.\u201cMu Bai, you have to show off today. You have to know that our Mu Family will distribute a few cultivation resources to some of the young disciples. The distribution is based on the contribution of their family and the cultivation grades of the young disciples. You have to work hard for this branch family of yours that has almost been forgotten by the Mu Family.\u201d Mu He personally sent Mu Bai to school in his black limousine this morning.Mu He was the Supervisor of Tian Lan Magic High; he personally arranged the annual examination today.No matter what, Mu Bai was still his nephew. Mu He hoped for Mu Bai to give him some face in front of the other Supervisors.\u201cUncle, please don\u2019t worry!\u201d Mu Bai said with the utmost confidence.As he finished speaking, Mu Bai suddenly thought of something; he turned over and whispered, \u201cUncle, I heard that Mu Ningxue is also coming to Tian Lan Magic High today?\u201d* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It just happens that Mu Ningxue started her summer break early from the Empire Institution. I discussed with the Family Head and had her, the flag of Bo City, come to Tian Lan Magic High to give you guys a lecture, take a look at the annual examinations this year, and have her evaluate the quality of the students,\u201d Mu He said.Seeing Mu Bai bursting with life, Mu He naturally knew what kind of ideas he had. He chuckled as he patted Mu Bai\u2019s shoulders, \u201cDon\u2019t worry; when it\u2019s your turn, I will have her watch with the Family Head. When the Family Head sees you working so hard, he might even distribute more cultivation resources to your family. You know how few disciples we have in our Family, and the outstanding ones are rarer. If the Family Head notices you and you are given a Stardust Magic Tool for two or three months, you\u2019ll reap many benefits!\u201d\u201cStar\u2026tardust Magic Tool?Really? I have a chance to use a Stardust Magic Tool?\u201d Mu Bai\u2019s eyes radiated.\u201cOf course, do you know why we are different from common Magicians? Superior genes? Family influence? No matter how good these are, they aren\u2019t better than a Stardust Magic Tool! If you canbecome a Core disciple within the family, you have a chance to receive a Stardust Magic Tool; your cultivation will definitely be far higher than your peers in school!\u201d Mu He said.\u201cUncle, I\u2026I will definitely do my best to show off!\u201dCultivation being far higher than the peers in school!Mu Bai began to boil up. No wonder why these disciples of the Family were frantically cultivating; it turns out it was for the Stardust Magic Tools.Every Magician has a limited amount of time to cultivate. For students like these, five hours of meditation was their limit, and the remaining time was for studying theory and knowledge.The Stardust Magic Tool was an item which every Magic cultivator yearns for the most.Mu Bai didn\u2019t know the principle behind the Stardust Magic Tool; however, he did know the Stardust Magic Tool could help cultivators to recover their energy more quickly and cut down the amount of fatigue.Normally, after spending 5 hours of meditation, they could only do other things in the remaining 19 hours.They were weary from meditating during the 19 hours. They could only pass this time through doing other things or sleeping.For a lot of students who wanted to advance, 19 hours of fatigue was too long; while at the same time, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. When a person is putting their mind on a constant focus, they need to have an even longer period of relaxation. Otherwise, their mind would collapse.Whereas the Stardust Magic Tool was a divine cultivation tool that was capable of cutting that fatigue time down.With the meditation fatigue period cut down, that would mean the increase of the daily meditation time!There may not be much of an effect with just a day or two. However, a month or two would make a small difference when it was compared to cultivators without a Stardust Magic Tool. If they were to practice with it for two or three months, then they would be in a completely different league compared to their peers.The efficiency of meditation varies from people to people; there are fast and slow ones; so let\u2019s not think about that for now. However, even if the efficiency was exceedingly slow, one could still be in the lead with the help of the Stardust Magic Tool. People who did their best and had talent would only do half the work for twice the effect!\u201cUncle, you mentioned the Elite Class students would have the opportunity to use the Stardust Magic Tool; is this true?\u201d Mu Bai asked with a slight excitement.\u201cThat\u2019s right; since this is a Magic school, naturally, there are also some few cultivation resources. However, the resources are very limited. There are so many students; thus, giving each student the chance to use it is not possible. Therefore, it\u2019s necessary to have the annual examination and the Elite class. This way the students of the Elite class will have an opportunity to use the Stardust Magic Tool for a period. It won\u2019t be a problem for you to enter the Elite class with your grades. When the time comes, I\u2019ll pull some strings from behind the scenes and let you use the school\u2019s Stardust Magic Tool for a little bit longer. For you, this is quite beneficial. The school is an equal place after all; it\u2019s not possible for me to do too much. What would truly allow you to soar to the sky is to use the Stardust Magic Tool from our Mu Family; that is something a common Magician will never be able to obtain in their lifetime. That\u2019s why you must treasure it,\u201d Mu He sincerely said to Mu Bai.\u201cDon\u2019t worry Uncle; I won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d\u201cSaying that to me is useless; you need to prove yourself in front of Mu Ningxue and the Family Head!\u201d Mu He patted Mu Bai\u2019s shoulders as he said this.Mu Bai nodded seriously; his heart couldn\u2019t help but to give a cold laugh, _\u201cXu Zhaoting, so what if your cultivation is on par with mine. So what if you have the Lightning element. Behind me is the enormous Mu Family; you will never be able to contend against me!\u201d_\u201cOh right, how\u2019s the situation with that kid called Mo Fan?\u201d Mu He inadvertently thought of this as if he thought of a begger he didn\u2019t want to give money to. He asked without thinking, as though he had nothing to do.\u201cHe\u2019s trash; he will definitely be expelled from the school,\u201d Mu Bai didn\u2019t need to cover up his despise for Mo Fan.Mu Bai really loathed Mo Fan.When everyone was young, they actually grew up in this area together. However, Mo Fan would always have a group of people following him; he was like the Monkey King. However, what Mu Bai didn\u2019t understand was the fact that the revered and matchless Mu Ningxue was actually blindly mixing with them, and their relations were very intimate.What did he count for? He was like a wild monkey, running around the block and mountain areas every day with a whiff of attitude; yet, his poverty was fully revealed.Did he know what true power was, family status? Did he know what it was to be called laughably poor to the point where people would always look down on him?The son of a servant is just low. Without seeing it, he just didn\u2019t know what vision was, what is called \u2018Ambition.\u2019 He just lived in his slum house, in that mud reeking street and took pleasure in working hard.\u201cHmpf, I\u2019ll sign him off. I\u2019ll have an explanation for Mo Jia Xing as well. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t help; it\u2019s just his idiot a son wasn\u2019t able to become a Mage, even when we gave him a chance to awaken. Sigh, people just aren\u2019t tactful; they just have to spend massive amounts of money to give it a try. The thing is, you are a loser, how can you hope for your son to be an allosaurus? Being poor and useless is something that gets passed down through generations,\u201d Mu He slowly said as he took a drag off his cigarette.At this moment, Mu He\u2019s eyes were half closed. He looked like a grand and graceful old fox; he even revealed his disdain and ridicule for poor people.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019d be bad if we\u2019re late,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou urged Mo Fan\u201cYou go first; I\u2019ll practice Control for a bit longer,\u201d Mo Fan replied.\u201cMaking a last-minute effort, huh?\u201dThe few people in the dorm didn\u2019t wait for Mo Fan; they posed as they went to the examination.The examination wasn\u2019t writing on a paper in the classroom. Although they did have examinations on Magic Theory, the points acquired from it weren\u2019t much. The most important thing was the annual practical examination.Frankly, it was just assessing the student\u2019s cultivation state after a year and once more distributing them into classes.Mo Fan was the last to arrive at the training grounds. On normal days, everyone would be here to attend their Practical classes, but today, it was clear the grounds were set up differently. Other than the examiners\u2019 table that was placed in a half arc, there was also a floating Star Appraisal Stone.The Star Appraisal Stone looked a little similar to a black cobblestone the size of a watermelon. At the moment, it was placed in the very front of the training grounds with the help of a stone pillar.The Star Appraisal Stone was the most important apparatus for the examination for the students.The annual examination was really simple, just like the Opening Ceremony\u2019s Awakening. The students only needed to place their hands on this massive Star Appraisal Stone, and the examiners would be able to determine the students\u2019 cultivation from the past year from the light emitted by the Star Appraisal Stone.It was like high school exams; a paper might determine the students\u2019 fate. This world also had the same quota; either you continued studying and obtained a good opportunity in life, or you packed your things up and found a different path.\u201cRemember what I\u2019ve told you before; the radiance intensity from the stardust represents the power of the magic capabilities within the stardust. Students of the eighth class, the time for you to showcase the efforts of this year has come; release the lights of your stardust!\u201d the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng\u2019s face was filled with passion.\u201cMr. Xue, I\u2019m sorry; I may be expelled from the school,\u201d A seemingly weak girl said with her face filled with tears. Her nervous and worried little appearance attracted the pity from the surrounding classmates.\u201cHow could that be? You\u2019ve always done your best. Don\u2019t be so pessimistic.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m stupid. Even if I were to do my best in cultivating every day, my stardust still seems so weak,\u201d The girl named Zuo Heyu said.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be afraid; even if you don\u2019t meet the requirement, there\u2019s still me. As long as there\u2019s a Mage in the family then we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d the dorm head of Mo Fan\u2019s dorm, Lu Jianhua, patted his chest as he spoke to Heyu.\u201cStop talking crap; you don\u2019t even know if you\u2019ll get kicked out yourself!\u201d\u201cAre you joking? Wait till this daddy places my hands on it; the radiance will blind your titanium alloyed dog eyes!\u201d Lu Jianhua said with pride and arrogance.Soon enough, three examiners from the school finally arrived at the grounds.The examiners were disciplinary teachers; the students were normally really scared of them.\u201cAlright, silence! The annual examination will be observed by a few school supervisors this time; we hope you will display the essence of a Mage today!\u201d Xue Musheng reminded the students.The examiners were to assess the thirty classes of freshmen. The 1500 people who wore the uniform of Tian Lan Magic High gave off a certain aura; it was a magnificent sight as they stood on the training grounds. They were arranged like blocks.Before the assessment, naturally, the principal gave a speech. It was like this every year.Following this, it was the school supervisors\u2019 turn to express themselves.When Mu He stepped onto the platform and passionately painted the beautiful picture of a Magicians future for the students, Mo Fan, who was among the crowd of people, couldn\u2019t help but to give a cold smile.His speech was filled with the lifetime expectations of the young students. However, Mo Fan was very clear on Mu He\u2019s morals and integrity.\u201cToday is an extremely special day.\u201d\u201cThat is because we have invited the most distinguished female Magician of the Bo City. When she was 15 years old, the Empire Magic Institute made an exception and recruited her. I\u2019m sure many of you have already heard of her legacy\u2026That\u2019s right; she is Mu Ningxue! Please, let us all warmly welcome her, who should be the same year as you but is a Magic Genius who has already been promoted to university!\u201d Mu He said loudly.As this was said, the entire a thousand or so people suddenly caused an uproar.\u201cHeavens, it\u2019s Mu Ningxue! I heard when she awakened the Ice Element, the power from it directly caused the grounds to freeze into ice blocks.\u201d\u201cThose are just rumors; I hold the most accurate info. I heard she only needed eight months to learn the primary skill of Ice element, Ice Scatter.\u201d\u201cEight\u2026.eight months?! Heavens, I\u2019ve already been in school for a year, and I have only been able to control five stars! How can the differences between people be so big?!\u201d\u201cThese aren\u2019t even the important points, alright\u2026.the most important point is, she\u2019s also a beauty! She\u2019s good looking and talented; she\u2019s the pride of Bo City!\u201dIn just a moment, the students of the school began to discuss this. From everyone\u2019s reaction, one could tell they were not unfamiliar with Mu Ningxue.They never imagined on the annual examination today; they would meet the legendary Magic Genius!\u201cBrother Fan, brother Fan, it\u2019s Little Princess; it really is her! She actually came to our school.\u201d Zhang Xiaohou was so excited he began to pull the sleeves of Mo Fan next to him.Mo Fan raised his head and gazed toward the platform. He had truly seen a beautiful figure quietly standing there like a proud lotus in the snow. The snow white, skin-tight dress caused her impressive body disposition to appear increasingly more detailed.What really attracted the people\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t the girl\u2019s fascinating body that emitted a sexual charm, but the stunning and long, peerless silver hair.Although the weather was warm and dry, the girl standing proudly on the platform was as like a Snow Fairy who wandered through the snow mountain before stepping onto the secular world. She was undoubtedly beautiful!As the students and teachers saw this girl step up; they were all silently shocked.They\u2019ve heard stories of Mu Ningxue many times, but they had never seen her before. Who would\u2019ve thought her entire being was an ice fairy in a girl form, whether it was her temperament, attire or her inherent graceful, silver, long hair.This is Mu Ningxue?Even her bones were emitting a noble pride.Even Mo Fan himself thought he saw a goddess. This most likely was the first time he saw Mu Ningxue after that thing happened; it had been about three years or so?In the past, the group of children liked calling her Little Princess, and she was a princess in everyone\u2019s heart. She lived in the castle in the mountains, wearing clothes and accessories that were prettier than normal girls by so many times, as well as her enchantingly cute appearance\u2026However, after three years, Mo Fan felt like he couldn\u2019t recognize her at all.Her change was colossal.The originally cheerful and approachable Mu Ningxue, in her prime, gave people an unapproachable feeling.Was it because her temperament had changed, or was it due to her growth throughout the years? Or perhaps it was the colossal difference in status giving rise to the thoughts in his mind?\u201cBrother Fan, you should\u2019ve eloped with Little Princess back then\u2026..\u201d Zhang Xiaohou looked at the manifestly superior Mu Ningxue as he exclaimed this.\u201cDid you hit the toilet door so hard you became stupid?\u201d\u201cEh, I said that without thinking it through.\u201d* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They spoke as though they really could get into the Empire Institution.Empire Magic Institution was naturally the best Magic University within the country. For a city like Bo City, every person who entered it would already be extraordinary.With the recruitment rate so low, it showed how special and how outstanding Mu Ningxue was. She was recruited into Empire Institution without even experiencing Magic High School.\u201cBrother Fan, do your best in the next two years and enter Empire. After entering Empire Institution, even if Mu Family\u2019s arms are long, they most likely can\u2019t reach there. By then\u2026 hehehe\u2026\u201d Zhang Xiaohou chuckled.Just as the words left Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s mouth, that nosy Zhao Kunsan jumped out.\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. After today, your Brother Fan will be directly expelled from the school, so don\u2019t even think about Empire Institution!\u201d Zhao Kunsan exclaimed.\u201cZhao Kunsan, are you sick or something? When did my Brother Fan ever offend you? Do you want to bark like a dog everytime we say something?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou had endured Zhao Kunsan for far too long.In any case, Zhang Xiaohou was currently one of the preeminent students of the class, and also one of the few who was able to use Magic. He didn\u2019t know what kind of qualifications this trash, Zhao Kunsan who was only able to control 6 stars, had that made him confident enough to bark so loud in front of him.\u201cHe didn\u2019t offend me. However, I\u2019m just unable to get used to this little dreg having no sense of shame. I just really don\u2019t understand where you got the guts to befriend Miss Mu Ningxue back in the day. You should be more clear on what kind of thing you are, and stop your wishful thinking. If it wasn\u2019t for you, then the lands of our Zhao Family wouldn\u2019t have been returned!\u201d Zhao Kunsan pointed at Mo Fan\u2019s nose as he cursed.Zhao Kunsan was also from this area of the city, and he counted as the servant of the Mu Family as well.Family servant: these words were quite harsh in modern times. However, if a family\u2019s livelihood was due to the Mu Family\u2019s owner\u2019s fondness of flowers, then how was the Zhao Family, who takes care of the flowers and plants at the manor, not a gardener, a Family Servant?The Mu Manor was too big; it was so big that it was like the land of a noble in olden times. Such places had over a hundred nobles in the Manor, and revolving around these people were farmers, manual laborers, and servants, numbering over a thousand.According to the older generations, this entire city area belonged to the Mu Family. In order to survive, households alike Mo Fan and Zhao Kunsan were naturally orbiting the true powerful and rich.Zhao Kunsan held a grudge against Mo Fan. If he wasn\u2019t so reckless and provoked the Old Master, then the farmers would\u2019ve lived good days!\u201cMo Fan, don\u2019t you have even a little bit of brain? I already knew from early on that there are some people that I can\u2019t touch in my lifetime and remaining at a respectful distance would only benefit the family. You just had to invite trouble; you think a toad can eat the meat of a swan? Do you freaking think this is some tv drama? A cow caretaker marries a princess\u2026 get out of here!\u201d Zhao Kunsan pointed at Mo Fan in disdain.With the appearance of Mu Ningxue this time, Zhao Kunsan also completely released the anger he had concealed within his heart.The stupid thing Mo Fan did back in the day had involved too many people, too many families.A Princess is a Princess\u2026 When you need to show her respect from a distance, then you should.This isn\u2019t a fairytale. When you cross that boundary, the King will increase the taxes in his rage, and this will cause the entire village and town\u2019s farming families to suffer beyond words!Today, standing in the back of the platform, the white-haired, middle-aged man emitting a heroic aura was the King!His name was Mu Zhuoyun. He was the person who could genuinely shake the entire Bo City with the stomp of his foot.This was the person Mo Fan provoked.Mu Zhuoyun was known for being benevolent by not making Mo Fan\u2019s entire family drop to the point where they\u2019d have to beg for food!\u201cZhao Kunsan, could you shut your mouth?!\u201d\u201cWhat, did I say anything wrong?\u201d Zhao Kunsan replied.Mo Fan glanced at Zhao Kunsan.Truth be told, the words he spoke made Mo Fan feel guilty. This matter was far from what he imagined the reality to be.Some people understood things only after they had grown up. Some teased the students with bad grades, but a rich family, that was a silly thing. After entering the society, the ones with money went overseas to study and came back with an incredible diploma. They could easily find a company and earn a tens of thousands per month, and they\u2019d still think it was too little money. Whereas those who had diligently studied, entered university, then submerged themselves in a multitude of jobs still had a quality of life that was simply not on the same level as those who were teased for their family background. Their ideal world was erased; they lost their spirits, yet remained tired, and still more poor than a freaking dog.The words Zhao Kunsan had said did, however, make people understand that his mindset was more mature than his peers. He already knew it\u2019d be better like this than mindlessly pursuing his goals. Or else, failing the dream, and the cruel reality would cause you to lose all the ambitions from the past in just a single moment; it would be an unacceptable nightmare!Naturally, Mo Fan had no reason to admire Zhao Kunsan\u2019s perspective on reality. Instead, he felt like laughing.\u201cZhao Kunsan, you sure have the potential and consciousness to be a dog. That is something I, Mo Fan, would never be able to have in my lifetime. I admire that; I truly do!\u201d Mo Fan said back to him.\u201cWho the hell are you. If I am a dog, then I\u2019d be a posh dog, eating good food, living in a small pretty house, wearing beautiful clothes. You\u2019re just the dog of a dying family; a degenerate dog. A dog that eats from the trash. Why don\u2019t you look at what kind of thing you are, with your body that emits the stench of a garbage heap? The most amusing thing is, you still don\u2019t understand how stinky you are yet. You just had to ruin the last land of your family simply so you could come to the Magic High. But at the end of the day, you just get kicked out anyways. I just want to ask your dad, Mo Jiaxing if he ever regrets giving birth to a person with such shit luck, like yours!\u201d Zhao Kunsan continued to curse.Mo Fan\u2019s cursing had actually directly struck Zhao Kunsan\u2019s weak points. However, Zhao Kunsan wasn\u2019t someone who was easy to deal with; he admitted he was a dog and bit Mo Fan back.Mo Fan looked toward the group of people.Naturally, his eyes caught the vague person who seemed to somewhat take pleasure in this whole ordeal; this person was naturally Mu Bai.This was the young master who lived on someone else\u2019s charity; the same one who Mo Fan had pressed down onto the floor and beaten up in the past.In the past, when everyone was still a child, their retaliation would at most be throwing stones, breaking their windows\u2026 fairly harmless actions.But now, a person\u2019s fate would greatly change under the Magic Awakening and Magic Examination. The Mu Bai who suddenly rose up had finally been given an opportunity to hit Mo Fan back.For now, Mu Bai had released this dog, Zhao Kunsan.

The examination begins now. If there is any more noise coming from any of you, then you\u2019ll lose your qualifications to take it!\u201d\u201cJust thinking about the expression on Lady Mu Ningxue\u2019s face at seeing you being expelled in front of all of the students and teachers, I reckon she would definitely regret wanting to run away with you in the past selfishly,\u201d Mu Bai didn\u2019t feel a need to conceal his objectives anymore as he whispered these sinister words into Mo Fan\u2019s ear.\u201cYour mouth smells like crap. I can\u2019t handle this stink; don\u2019t get close to me,\u201d Mo Fan used his hand to block him.The corner of Mu Bai\u2019s mouth twitched._I\u2019ll let this kid be arrogant for a while more yet!_In the past, Mo Fan had held Mu Bai on the ground as he fiercely beat him up in front of Mu Ningxue. Since then and for the rest of his life, Mu Bai would be unable to raise his head in front of Mu Ningxue; even now, he still felt ashamed.Today, he, Mu Bai, planned on letting Mo Fan suffer even worse.Being expelled in front of the entire school and Mu Ningxue\u2026 In this society where Magic was the ultimate authority was reason enough for Mo Fan to be ridiculed and looked down upon by Mu Ningxue. When he return to his father, Mo Jiaxing, how is he going to explain this to his father who sold their house just so he could enter Magic High, when he returned?Unqualified students being expelled during the annual examination was a very common matter.Being expelled wasn\u2019t something announced to the entire school. The school wasn\u2019t likely to be that unkind.However, there was one exception where the school would directly announce the expulsion. That would be when the magician\u2019s stardust hadn\u2019t shown any progress at all!Under normal circumstances, after the students had awakened their stardust, they would properly cultivate it every day. Even the more clumsy people would slowly make their stardust glow, and develop their magic capabilities unless the student was too lazy to do so!In order to punish this type of student, who wasted the awakening resources and magic books, and to help make the other school students understand that cultivation was not a child\u2019s game where you could waste your time, the school would publicly announce the expulsion of a student whose cultivation was far too low.This kind of public announcement might not happen every year, and it was set up to encourage the students who took the back door to enter the school.During the start of this school semester, the entire class conducted a rough examination. At that time, Mo Fan\u2019s cultivation was practically at zero. Xue Musheng almost made a public slandering of Mo Fan in a fit of fury.Now, the school semester had ended, while also entering the most important annual examination.If things went according to the calculations, then Mo Fan\u2019s cultivation would be very likely approach the line of public expulsion.Naturally, to prevent a miscalculation, Mu Bai and his uncle, Mu He, had also prepared a big present for Mo Fan.This big present was enough to put Mo Fan out of bounds, giving him the honor of receiving the punishment the school hadn\u2019t given for three years.The most fortunate thing was that Mu Ningxue and Mu Zhuoyun would also be present to view this scene!Mu Bai felt much happier just thinking about it.Today was the day to show himself off, and from that day on, soar through the sky with high status. It was also the day for that cheap Mo Fan to be humiliated. _How great, how great!_\u2026\u2026\u201cThe Annual Examination will now officially begin!\u201dAll of the thirty classes in the school began simultaneously.The process of the test was actually very simple. You just had to place your hand on the Star Appraisal Stone while everyone, including the examiners, watched. Then, you concentrated to enter a meditative state, and at that time, the Star Appraisal Stone would emit the same radiance as the examinee\u2019s stardust. They would then assess the level of the cultivation based on the radiance.Every student had three attempts.The final result was based on the attempt with the brightest radiance.Naturally, the more the student concentrated on it, the more the Star Appraisal Stone would accurately display the radiance of the student\u2019s stardust.The order of the examinee\u2019s was random. The first examinee naturally happened to be that weeping beauty, classmate He Yu, who was already standing at the front.The girl was still that timid; she was still extremely shy as she walked to the front of the Star Appraisal Stone under everyone\u2019s gaze. She looked as though she was scared of being expelled.\u201cYou may begin,\u201d the bald examiner said.\u201cGood luck He Yu! Your teacher and your fellow classmates believe in you,\u201d Xue Musheng said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t do well; I will take care of you,\u201d the nutjob of a dorm head, Jian Hua said.He Yu was feeling shy as she closed her eyes; she then placed her small hands on the massive Star Appraisal Stone.The entire class suddenly turned silent. Their eyes were attentively watching the girl who was taking the first test, and it seemed as though they were more nervous than the examinee.For some reason, Mo Fan felt a change in He Yu\u2019s temperament after she began her test. Her expression turned serious; although she was nervous, she wasn\u2019t frenetic.The black Star Appraisal Stone gradually emitted some radiance from within. In the beginning, it looked like the early sunrise. Following He Yu\u2019s intense focus, the radiance gradually spread around the Star Appraisal Stone, causing the radiance to fill the surroundings.\u201cA\uff01\u201d\u201cA\uff01\u201d\u201cA\uff01\u201dIn this moment, the three examinee\u2019s practically announced the results simultaneously.\u201cClassmate, it\u2019s done. Your final result is an A!\u201d the bald examiner said without an expression on his face.He Yu opened her eyes; she looked as though she was unable to believe it, before she excitedly said, \u201cRe\u2026 really? I got an A?\u201dAlthough the scene of a girl happily yelling out she got an A was strange, they had no choice to admit that He Yu\u2019s final results gave everyone a surprise.\u201cI\u2026 freaking hell. A?! That\u2019s the standard for entering the Elite Class!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speechless. Before the test, she was sitting there wailing endlessly. We really thought she was drifting on the borderline of being expelled, but as the final results came out, she freaking got an A!\u201d\u201cMagic B*tch; what a typical magic studying b*tch. I\u2019ll never believe her again.\u201dAfter the results came out, Mo Fan\u2019s dorm head, classmate Jianhua, was completely flabbergasted._Raise her, my ass. It\u2019d be really good if he would be able to get a B. He\u2019s just blindly worrying about someone who got an A._The homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng\u2019s expression was stiff. He was deceived by the female teacher who acted all cute. However, having the first one to take the test and get an A made Xue Musheng feel happy overall.All the grades will be summed up, and after that, the thirty classes will compare the average grades. Xue Musheng felt like his own class had the potential to reach the top three.The biggest competition was the class next door, class 7. With that Lightning Element kid, Xu Zhaoting, who knew how much of a difference there would be between the classes? However, what he wished for was the most outstanding student in his class, Mu Bai, to not be inferior to Xu Zhaoting in any respect.\u201cNext one, do you want to partake the test?\u201d the bald examiner said, as he looked at He Yu.He Yu shook her head in haste as she said, \u201cI\u2019ve only grasped six stars so far, so I\u2019ll let it be.\u201d\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll use the evaluation from your other teachers to decide which class you\u2019ll be placed in,\u201d the bald examiner said.\u201cThank you, teacher.\u201dHe Yu walked out, happily. Originally, she wanted to share this joy with the friends next to her, however, she realized the friends were all a meter away from her. She was puzzled by this.She didn\u2019t do anything wrong; her grades were pretty good, right?\u201cNext, Zhang Xiaohou,\u201d the examiner announced the name.Zhang Xiaohou couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. He didn\u2019t think it would be his turn so soon.\u201cBrother Fan, I\u2019m going,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said to Mo Fan.\u201cMhm, do your best, and stay calm,\u201d Mo Fan replied.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be advising other people; hearing it makes me wanna puke,\u201d without fail, Zhao Kunsan followed, saying this.Mo Fan was puzzled. _Is this Zhao Kunsan on a stalker mode and conversation denial mode? How is it possible that he would just pour cold water along with everything I do?_* * *Translator: TofuEditor: MindLitUp*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was easy to tell that Zhang Xiaohou was slightly nervous, which explained why the Star Appraisal Stone was unable to grasp the energy from his stardust.However, Zhang Xiaohou slowly entered the meditative state.At last, the radiance stabilized. The cyan colored radiance from the Wind Element covered the surroundings of the Star Appraisal Stone, and the radiance was superior to He Yu\u2019s. Other than being a bit unstable, there was no other fuss about it.\u201cA\uff01\u201d\u201cA\uff01\u201d\u201cA+\uff01\u201dThe three examiners seemed to have different views regarding it.\u201cTeacher, let me try one more time.\u201dZhang Xiaohou didn\u2019t seem pleased with this result; thus, he once more entered a meditative state.This time, he was considerably calmer.The intense radiance covered the Star Appraisal Stone\u2019s surroundings; it was apparent that it was much stronger than He Yu\u2019s. Additionally, there didn\u2019t appear to be any unstable flickering from it anymore.The three examiners glanced at each other and nodded.\u201cA+\u201d\u201cA+\u201d\u201cA+\u201d\u201cFinal results, A+!\u201dAfter they announced the results, the students of his class all showed shock and envy.\u201cCrap, A+! That\u2019s a grade that secures your place in the Elite Class! This kid, Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s lifestyle, is just mediocre, so who would\u2019ve thought that his cultivation would be so amazing? We were mistaken; we really were mistaken.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really amazing! If I could get A+, then my dad would immediately gift me a car!\u201dXue Musheng and Tangyue, the two teachers, gave a slight smile as they nodded their heads. Their eyes were filled with praise.Zhang Xiaohou had always been an outstanding student to them, thus, having this kind of result was well within reason.\u201cClassmate, you\u2019re done. We will assess accordingly\u2026\u201d the bald examiner was about to announce the final result.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019d like to attempt the next test,\u201d at this moment, Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s expression was firm, but his face showed a shyness as he said this.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the examiner asked, a bit surprised.\u201cI know that the higher you place in the rankings during the Annual Examination, then the longer you will get to use the Stardust Magic Tool. Thus, I\u2019d like to take the Activation test,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said with certainty.Xue Musheng and Tangyue maintained the smiles on their faces. They already knew that Zhang Xiaohou had reached the level of Activation.The examination consisted of two parts.The first part was the Stardust test.The majority of the students only needed to complete this part to continue to study magic at Magic High.While the second part was set up for the top students, out of over one thousand students, there were roughly only a hundred or so who had touched upon the level of Activation.If one can activate the elemental skill during the examination, then naturally they would be awarded more points for the Annual Examination.To obtain more of the limited resources from the school, the students would have to display all of their powers during the Annual Examination, without hiding anything.\u2026\u2026Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s Activation test didn\u2019t go particularly smoothly. He was so nervous that he was unable to properly link the seven Wind Element stars with each other to form a Star Path.However, the examiners were able to see that this student was capable of Activation, but due to being nervous on the testing grounds he was unable to activate successfully. However, they still gave him some points based on his performance.Feeling somewhat disappointed, Zhang Xiaohou walked out of the testing ground with his head low.Mrs. Tangyue was like a tender older sister when she patted Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t feel discouraged. You will definitely be able to enter the Elite Class with your grades.\u201d\u201cTeacher, I thought I was proficient in \u2018Control,\u2019 but who would\u2019ve thought that a little nervousness would cause the time I spent practicing \u2018Control\u2019 to disappear mysteriously, making me start from the beginning. Teacher, how are you able to accomplish the magic activation so easily?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou asked.\u201cNaturally it\u2019s from practicing. Other than that, the state of your heart is also crucial. Not only does a qualified Magician need to have a solid foundation, but they also need to have a mentality that won\u2019t waver if they encounter trouble.\u201dZhang Xiaohou nodded as he seemed to understand this.\u201cNext, Huang Feifeng.\u201d\u201cB\uff01\u201d\u201cTeacher, I should receive an A! I should be given an A!!!\u201d\u201cIf you make more noise, we\u2019ll cancel your results.\u201d\u201cNext, Luo Si.\u201d\u201cC\uff01\u201dThe student called Luo Si jumped for joy.For a failure of a student like him, receiving C was like New Years.\u2026\u2026The students of eight class were receiving their examinations, one by one. The majority of the students were B and C; there didn\u2019t seem to be many A\u2019s.\u201cLook, the people of the school council are almost here.\u201d\u201cThey are at the seventh class\u2019 exam grounds\u2026 The one taking the test is that Lightning Element guy.\u201d\u201cXu Zhaoting, that is firmly the number one guy in the entire school.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not certain. I heard Mu Bai\u2019s cultivation is also very high!\u201dAs Mo Fan heard his classmates\u2019 discussion, his gaze turned toward the seventh class exam grounds.Sure enough, the School Council group included the particularly outstanding Mu Ningxue, who had already walked to the vicinity.\u2026\u2026\u201cOld brother Mu Zhuoyun, this is our school\u2019s most outstanding Lightning Element student; his name is Xu Zhaoting. When he awakened his Lightning Element a year ago, I, as the Principal, began to pay close attention to him. He\u2019s currently doing the Activation test; care to watch?\u201d the Principal of Tian Lan Magic High said to Mu Zhuoyun.The Principal was very polite toward Mu Zhuoyun; thus, it was obvious that Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s status within Bo City was very high.\u201cNingxue, why don\u2019t you take a look at this student\u2019s performance.\u201d\u201cMhm,\u201d Mu Ningxue nodded.Lightning element, the first of the elements. Its violent, destructive force was enough to make other Magicians take several steps back.Within the examination grounds, Xu Zhaoting, who wore the school uniform, was already there. He adjusted his breathing, as well as trying to make peace with the pressuring gazes coming from the students and teachers of the entire school.Ever since he had entered the school, he had become the focal point for them. These gazes were incessantly urging him to cultivate.\u201cHeed my command!\u201d\u201cThe first of the Elements, Lightning!\u201d\u201cStrike of Lightning!\u201dAs the sounds faded, he raised a hand.The purple Lightning Arc surged; it was as though the Serpent King called out to the violent python soldier. They slithered their shocking body, twirling through the atmosphere and burning everything they touched.\u201cActivate!\u201dThe Electric Arc violently descended upon the human-shaped puppet.The puppet violently trembled. It was charred from the drop of the violent Lightning Strike. The electricity crackled around; covering it with whip prints. The human-shaped puppet exploded with no remains in a single moment by the force of the Lightning.On the floor of the Training grounds, there were strips of black marks. It looked extremely terrifying.The puppet had already turned into a pile of black dust.The heaven-defying Lightning element skill immediately stole the attention of the entire exam grounds, causing the Elite students who were also able to activate skills to take a deep breath._Holy cow, who cares about Wind Trail? Who cares about Water Barrier? What Fire Burst? They are all weak. The tyrannical power of the Lightning Strike was not something the other Elements could compare themselves to. It directly caused the puppet to explode into dregs.

Just how high were this girl\u2019s standards?\u201cHehe, that\u2019s actually not bad. Ningxue is in Empire Institution; all of the geniuses in the country gather there. The activation of the primary skill, Lightning Strike, is the most basic skill there. The reason as to why she thinks its average is because she has a habit of using the standards of Empire Institution to assess,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun smiled as he explained this, giving the Principal and the group of people in the school council a way out of this awkward situation.\u201cIf you put it like that, does that mean Xu Zhaoting has students with the potential to enter Empire Institute?\u201d The Principal was also someone who understood how to deal with situations; he took advantage and asked this.The other people immediately copied what he said.\u201cIf things go well, then Xu Zhaoting\u2019s grades will be the best in the entire school, right?\u201d School director, Chen Guangliang said.\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. From what I know, Mu Bai from the eighth class is also quite capable.\u201d Vice-Principal replied.Hearing them saying this, a smile emerged on Mu He\u2019s face as he immediately spoke to Mu Zhuoyun and Mu Ningxue, \u201cOlder brother, Mu Bai is a disciple from our Mu Family; his grades have always been quite remarkable. From how I see it, it should be his turn soon; should we go and watch?\u201d\u201cMu Bai? Which family\u2019s?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Mu Yang\u2019s son. When Mu Yang passed away, I saw Mu Bai and his mother being bullied by others somewhere; thus, I brought them to live in the manor. Mu Bai is a very intelligent and determined child; he\u2019s no worse than the other kids of our family\u2026 Oh, there\u2019s naturally a huge gap compared to Mu Ningxue, but he\u2019s still a seedling worth raising,\u201d Mu He cautiously said to Mu Zhuoyun.The highest authority over the manor was completely within Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s hands. Mu He counted as a Lord, as well; however, he was just a third or fourth degree Lord. That was simply not on par with Mu Zhuoyun.\u201cOh, that slightly rings a bell. Then let\u2019s go and have a look; how about it, school directors?\u201d Mu Zhuoyun asked.The school director with the split hair that was gradually losing its color said \u201cSince it is a disciple of your Mu Family, we are definitely interested.\u201dThe group of people began to walk, slowly making their way to the exam grounds of the eight class.The aura of this group of people was very strong. In the eyes of the students, the directors may be a faintly discernable existence; however, Mu Ningxue, a genius of the same age as them was something incredible.On the grounds, the male students saw the girl observing from the side.\u201cHeavens, the group of directors is coming here.\u201d\u201cThey really came; my hands are trembling.\u201d\u201cGood timing; just in time for me to show off.\u201d\u201cShow off my ass; your test is already over. You\u2019re just a dreg with a \u2018C!\u2019\u201dThe students of the eight class were unable to calm themselves.Every student\u2019s fate depended on the Annual Examination. While at the same time, the group of school directors who could change their future with just a single, praising glance were coming over. This caused the examination to have an exceedingly heavy atmosphere.Mu He was walking to the very front. The bald examiner immediately raised his head and glanced at Mu He.As Mu He hinted to him, the bald examiner immediately understood what he meant. He first pretended to not see anything before he indifferently said, \u201cNext, Mu Bai!\u201dMu Bai\u2019s eyes were still placed on Mu Ningxue\u2019s body. Even though the two lived in the same castle, it was still so big that Mu Bai has only been this close to Mu Ningxue just a few times before.\u201cMu Bai, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Mu He coughed to remind Mu Bai.Only then did Mu Bai come back to his senses.What could he do? He liked her for far too many years. Even if it were rather impossible for him to walk with her, he still wouldn\u2019t freaking let that trash, Mo Fan, take her away. He would be her bodyguard!It was time to prove the efforts of the past years!Mu Bai nodded before he began walking toward the exam grounds.He had been waiting for this for a long time. Mu Bai took a deep breath.To have the attention of the family and Mu Ningxue, these were things Mu Bai could only dream of, and today was the day where the both would come true.As he placed his hand on the Star Appraisal Stone, Mu Bai repressed his excitement within his heart as much as possible.In this aspect, Mu Bai had actually practiced for a long time. Even if he felt more excited and nervous than anyone, he relied on his past training to complete a proper and stable meditation.A white and dense, icy wave quickly spread out from the Star Appraisal Stone and covered the surroundings.This ice wave was so strong; it overflowed from the Star Appraisal Stone and made even Mu Bai feel its cold on his face.All of the teachers and students watched this scene, entranced.The radiance was overflowing. This was perhaps the first time they have seen something like this happen during an exam. Even Zhoumin, who received an A, was quite inferior to the overflowing radiance of Mu Bai!\u201cS\uff01\u201d\u201cS\uff01\u201d\u201cS\uff01\u201dThe three examiners immediately gave announced their grades, and all of them were \u2018S\u2019s!\u2019\u201cI remember Xu Zhaoting from before had two \u2018S\u2019 and an \u2018A,\u2019 right?\u201d\u201cIn that case, Mu Bai\u2019s stardust is more superior than Xu Zhaoting!\u201d Mu He immediately said.At this moment, Xue Musheng was astonished by this sight. This Mu Bai had hidden his true power?\u201cAs expected of the disciple of a noble family. I thought Mu Bai would only get one \u2018S\u2019 at most, who would\u2019ve thought that he would receive three \u2018S\u2019s!\u2019 \u201c\u201cThree \u2018S\u2019s,\u2019 the final result is naturally \u2018S\u2019s!\u2019\u201dThese were without a doubt the best grades in the school!\u201cShit, Mu Bai is too amazing. He unexpectedly received three \u2018S\u2019s.\u2019 These grades directly shake Xu Zhaoting from class seven off; thus, Mu Bai will be worthy of the title \u2018Number One.\u2019\u201d\u201cI never imagined\u2026\u201d\u201cMu Bai, you\u2019re far too amazing!\u201dA few girls, at this moment, had already become completely infatuated with him.Mu Bai was handsome, and his grades were outstanding. He was simply the Knight on the white horse in their hearts.\u201cBig brother, what do you think?\u201d Mu He laughed as he asked Mu Zhuoyun to his side.\u201cNot bad,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun gave a brief comment.Mu Ningxue, however, didn\u2019t say anything.Seeing Mu Ningxue not react, Mu Bai knew that getting three \u2018S\u2019s,\u2019 in Mu Ningxue\u2019s opinion, was nothing impressive. This was the Activation test; it was also the time for him to show off his true strength!Mu Bai turned around and walked to the middle of the exam grounds.\u201cMu Bai is taking the Activation test!\u201d\u201cNo shit, Mu Bai has definitely grasped the control of seven stars.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the skill of Ice element.\u201dAs they were discussing this, Mu Bai had already fixated his gaze onto the human-shaped puppet.That\u2019s right; the Stardust test was only the basics. The people who had a brain were very clear on the fact that the Activation test was the true assessment test.I will definitely have Family Head and Mu Ningxue take notice of me!He closed his eyes and began his magic incantations.Mu Bai skillfully made the seven Ice element stars connect with each other to form a Star Path.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he finished his Magic activation, those watching suddenly realized there was a layer of frost spreading on the body of the puppet.The ice quickly covered its body, and the puppet now looked as though it was painted in a layer of ice lacquer. It was rather astonishing.The stabbingly cold air pervaded the entire exam grounds.Creak~The Ice Spread didn\u2019t stop after it covered the entire puppet, it even began to spread onto the floor of the exam grounds.The other classes also had Ice element students who had taken the activation exam. Clearly their Ice Spreads weren\u2019t as imposing as Mu Bai\u2019s!The other students felt intimidated and took a step back, feeling like the ice was about to spread to where they stood.The directors and examiners were calm. However, their eyes flashed with praise.This was the equivalent of a proficient Ice element skill, it had reached the standard of a member of the Magic Association.This was actually set up for older students by the Magic Association. A student who only awakened an year ago capable of utilizing the Ice element skill to a proficient level was something extremely rare to come across.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun still gave the same evaluation.Mu Bai didn\u2019t know whether he had entered Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s eyes. With his heart feeling nervous, he shifted his gaze toward Mu Ningxue.As he looked at her, Mu Bai felt as though an arrow had pierced through his heart. It was because his most beloved Mu Ningxue hadn\u2019t taken a look at him from the start. Instead, her gaze had always been attentively watching a certain person in his class.Mu Bai took this opportunity and looked for the person she was looking at, and he felt another arrow piercing his heart.Mo Fan!!She\u2019s looking at Mo Fan!Scoundrel, SCOUNDREL!Why is she looking at him again!!What is there to look at in a guy who is almost covered in trash? Why aren\u2019t you looking at my remarkable display of skill?!Mu Bai\u2019s nervous face was almost completely distorted.On the most important event of his life, all he wished for was to get Mu Ningxue\u2019s attention. But in the end, she still ended up looking toward that little hooligan. That little hooligan was only a clown that existed to entertain the princess, what\u2019s there to see in a clown? When you\u2019re done laughing, move on, why are you still wasting your precious attention on him?\u201cI will make you suffer immensely!\u201d Mu Bai\u2019s face was exceedingly gloomy. He carried a heavy resentment as he left the exam grounds.\u201cYour marks are extremely outstanding. Your stardust is S, and your activation is of B grade!\u201d the examiner gave him his final resultsEven the top students would only receive a C grade or a D grade on the Activation test. The only other person who have received a B was that Lightning element user, Xu Zhaoting!With a grade like this, he deserved the title of the number one in school.\u2026\u2026\u201cNext, Mo Fan!\u201dAs people were admiring Mu Bai magnificently seizing the crown, it was finally Mo Fan\u2019s turn.The truth is, Mo Fan felt like something was strange.Why did it have to be me after that Green Tea Man? Did they scheme this?Mo Fan refused to believe that there was such a coincidental thing in this world.However, it didn\u2019t matter. If one needed sleep, one should sleep. Different situations called for different measures. If you don\u2019t do anything, then there\u2019ll be no clear sky.\u2026\u2026\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Mu He whispered as he watched Mu Bai walking over.\u201cI did what you told me to,\u201d Mu Bai seemed like a scheming woman as he replied sinisterly.\u201cI\u2019m doing this for the good of Mo Jiaxing. By directly sweeping his son out of here, I\u2019ll save him the trouble as a parent tirelessly worrying about him. His son wasn\u2019t someone who was suited to study magic from the beginning, yet, he still had to force his way in,\u201d Mu He said.Mu He and Mu Bai naturally had ways to deal with Mo Fan.Before the examination, Mu He had used his powers as the school director to carefully scheme something.The bald examiner was one of Mu He\u2019s people. Thus, the order of the examinees was something Mu He had arranged.As soon as Mu Bai finished his exams, it became Mo Fan\u2019s turn. After Mo Fan finished his examination, it would be the time for resting and announcement of grades. Thus, within this short break, one could secretly pull a trick. For example, when Mu Bai had placed his hand on the Star Appraisal Stone, he could slip in a Black Stone into it.The effects of the Black Stone were very simple. When the Star Appraisal Stone was emitting its radiance, the Black Stone was capable of absorbing a part of the energy, causing the Star Appraisal Stone\u2019s radiance to dim by a lot.So if Mo Fan was barely able to reach the C grade, then this tiny Black Stone the size of a grain could lower Mo Fan\u2019s grades to a solid D.Either way, he\u2019s just trash. Who cares if we make him look like complete and utter trash? There really was no need for the school to waste its resources on a person like that, expelling him from the school benefitted not only the school, but also his family.Mu Bai had already smiled so much that his face seemed completely distorted.How are you, Mo Fan, going to avoid losing all of your face this time?\u2026\u2026\u201cMo Fan, that sounds familiar.\u201d At this time, Mu Zhuoyun slowly opened his mouth.\u201cBig Brother, he is the son of Madam\u2019s driver,\u201d Mu He reminded Mu Zhuoyun.At that moment, the Mu Zhuoyun whose eyes that seemed like ice and snow this entire time suddenly began to turn.In truth, he had already taken notice of Mo Fan. It\u2019s just he was in doubt. How come the second he got here, it was Mu Bai\u2019s and Mo Fan\u2019s examinations?Mu Zhuoyun took glance at Mu Ningxue to his side.Mu Ningxue quickly recovered her tranquil manner, acting as though she was looking at the mediocre students from before, without any fluctuation to her emotions.Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s eyes gave rise to some satisfaction.A kid will always have a time where they are rebellious. Once they grow up, they will no longer be that childish.\u201cLet\u2019s watch then. He also counts as one of our Mu Family, at least, he was.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s manner of speaking was indifferent as he said this.Mu Zhuoyun was also very clear on the fact that a driver\u2019s son was incapable of being any good, thus, letting Mu Ningxue watch was also beneficial. This kind of person was common within the small Bo City, they would leave our world sooner or later. Mu Zhuoyun didn\u2019t want this kid, Mo Fan, to remain a scar within the heart of his precious daughter.\u2026\u2026On the other side, Mo Fan didn\u2019t listen to what these people were talking about.He had already walked to the front of the Star Appraisal Stone, and just like the people before him, he placed his hand on the Star Appraisal Stone.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m really thankful that he is here. He can save me from setting the standards lower, this way, I won\u2019t be too miserable,\u201d a failure of a student said.\u201cThird Brother, I also got a D. Don\u2019t worry, we can leave the campus together in a natural manner.\u201d said his classmate, Xiao Bing, who was a Water Element from the same dorm.\u201cWhether he can receive a D is hard to say.\u201d\u201cYeah, he probably didn\u2019t make any progress on his cultivation.\u201dIn the same class, Zhoumin, who also possessed the Fire Element, was attentively watching Mo Fan.She wanted to know whether he studied or not. A person who clearly had a higher talent in the Fire Element than her being expelled from the school, this made even Zhoumin feel it was somewhat a pity. At same time, she couldn\u2019t help but loathe Mo Fan, a person who didn\u2019t put effort into improving himself.\u201cThere\u2019s light, there\u2019s light coming\u2026..\u201d\u201cThe radiance seems really weak, it feels like it\u2019s even weaker than a D grade.\u201dOn the Star Appraisal Stone, the radiance felt extremely bashful. It was simply unable to escape from the inside of the Star Appraisal Stone.However, the radiance on the inside had a relatively strong light. It seemed as if the light was being concealed by a shadow; simply unable to escape from the inside.\u201cShit, something isn\u2019t right.\u201d\u201cThat light\u2026.it doesn\u2019t seem to be a D!\u201d\u201cReally? Grade C??\u201d The dorm mate, Xiao Bing looked at it in astonishment. He seemed unable to believe that Mo Fan was actually able to cause a C grade Fire Element radiance to appear on the Star Appraisal Stone.We said that we would leave the school in a natural manner, but you receiving grade C would barely meet the qualifications.What about the trust from one failure to another failure?* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The other examinees had quickly finished their tests, however, this student\u2019s radiance was weak in the beginning, but then it started to slowly become stronger. It went from D to C, and it was still growing stronger even after reaching grade C.\u201cB! This is definitely B!!\u201d\u201cHoly cow, a comeback, the failure is doing a comeback!!\u201d\u201cThat must be a mistake. I only received a B, how could this guy possibly get a B?\u201d The other Fire element user, Huang Feifeng, almost cried.Zhoumin received an A, and that puny little kid called Da Niu also received a B. Out of the four Fire elemental students, only he, Huang Feifeng had received a C. How was he going to receive Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s affections now!Xue Musheng\u2019s eyes immediately began to brighten.As the homeroom teacher, his biggest fear was for someone in his class dragging down the average. Today, all Xue Musheng asked out of Mo Fan was for him to not be publicly expelled, it had not happened for the past three years. If this Great Buddha didn\u2019t do that, then he could drag down the average as much as he wanted!What Xue Musheng never thought of was that this kid would suddenly emerge with a B!!The average of the class was roughly B-.The Great Buddha had unexpectedly increased the average grade, this something he could not even dream about.The current Xue Musheng was happier than seeing an A grade student!The discussion volume this time wasn\u2019t any lower than the chatter about Mu Bai before. After all, Mu Bai was the person who everyone knew had good grades, whereas Mo Fan was the well-known dreg out of the dregs.The dreg suddenly seized a B, there were too many people who didn\u2019t expect this outcome!\u201cHow is this possible\u2026how is this possible!\u201d Mu Bai was flabbergasted.His uncle, Mu He, watched this scene while feeling completely speechless.What kind of situation is this, that kid got a B??\u201cMu Bai, did you really place the Black Stone there? The absorption rate of that Black Stone is really strong, a person who can receive a C would be turned into someone who can\u2019t even get D,\u201d Mu He whispered to Mu Bai.\u201cI did place it, I definitely placed it there.\u201d Even if Mu Bai made a mistake on his examination, there\u2019s no way he would make a mistake on that part.The Black Stone was definitely placed there, but how did this guy get a B??Wasn\u2019t this guy drifting between C and D? Don\u2019t tell me that he was concealing his strength, and then let it all out on the last examination to reach a B?C is passing grade, whereas B would be quite good!Who could imagine that a failure who was supposed to take the penalty that hadn\u2019t been given for three years would suddenly turn into a good student?\u201cMhm, this grade was well within expectations.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s tone was indifferent as it carried a sense of mocking.His own daughter was almost taken away by this kid???If this really happened, then he would have been ridiculed by all of the people under the heavens.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s move on to the next class.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun didn\u2019t want his daughter to pay too much attention to this kid, thus, he said this to the crowd of people.\u201cBig Brother, this Mu Bai\u2026\u201d Mu He wanted to continue talking.Mu He was not satisfied with this outcome. Today\u2019s plan was to let Mu Bai show off his skills in front of the clan and receive the attention of the Family Head. The other one was to let Mo Fan suffer a tragic end. However, the two outcomes hadn\u2019t been attained, how could he just let them leave like that?\u201cOh, distribute a bit more to their family during the New Year to show encouragement,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun replied.As Mu Bai heard this, he was completely stunned.What the hell was \u2018distribute some more to them during New Year\u2019s\u2019 ???Who the hell wanted that charity-like money, what he wanted was attention. What he wanted was for the Mu Family to focus on supporting him. What he wanted was the Stardust Magic Tool. What he wanted was the colossal cultivation resources which the Mu Family distributed to their direct descendant!\u201cThis\u2026Big Brother, I think\u2026\u201d As Mu He was about to say some few words for Mu Bai, another voice suddenly resounded.\u201cThat\u2019s wrong, this radiance is wrong!\u201dSuddenly, someone objected. It was a woman\u2019s voice, sounding soft and sexy.\u201cMrs. Tangyue, what objections do you have regarding our decision? According to the norm, the results of the exams are decided by the examiners. Even if we wanted to object\u2026\u201d Xue Musheng started saying.Xue Musheng was actually extremely satisfied with this grade. He even suspected the Star Appraisal Stone to have some malfunction, how could Mo Fan otherwise receive a B?\u201cMrs. Tangyue, please let this matter go. If there really is a problem, then I reckon I as the homeroom teacher will unable preserve my integrity!\u201d\u201cTeachers have no qualifications to object to the assessment of the examiners. However, they can object to accidents happening during the examination\u2026we can even examine the testing equipment to ensure the accuracy of the equipment,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said.At this time, a school director was secretly shaking his head toward Mrs. Tangyue. At same time, the Principal was also incessantly hinting to Mrs. Tangyue.It\u2019s not that the school director didn\u2019t know there was some concealed trick beneath this, but they didn\u2019t want any unnecessary matter to arise when there were so many school directors present.What was the problem with the result, wasn\u2019t it normal? It was a grade a common student should receive.\u201cWhy do you have an objection regarding this result, honorable teacher?\u201d Mu Zhuoyun became somewhat interested in this, so he began to inquire.Mrs. Tangyue had already walked onto the examination ground, her eyebrows were knitted.Suddenly she closed her eyes, she looked like a Magician who was about to cast magic.The people who had some understanding about Magic knew that she was actually just expanding her senses into the stone.\u2026\u2026Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s action immediately caused Mu Bai and Mu He to panic.According to the norm, after Mo Fan had finished his exams, the examinations would take a break so the students could rest. At same time, they would announce the most outstanding student\u2019s name of the first half of the examinations.Taking advantage of the break, the bald examiner would remove the Dark Stone without suspicion. This way, everything would be normal, the plan was flawless.Everything was going smoothly, but who would\u2019ve thought that there would be a teacher popping out from nowhere who discovered the source of the problem.\u201cMrs. Tangyue, how can you just ignore the rules of the examination grounds? If I was you, then I would immediately leave the examinee\u2019s examination grounds!\u201d Mu He immediately yelled out.Mu He obviously had to be loud. He had to use his authority to intimidate this teacher who discovered the problem.However, Mrs. Tangyue wasn\u2019t afraid at all. She looked as if she found something as she directly walked toward the Star Appraisal Stone.\u201cThe Star Appraisal Stone has a problem, this examination has to be redone.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s incomparably sharp gaze stared at the examiner.The bald examiner was at loss on what to do, he hastily looked at Mu He.Mu He was embarrassed. His expression appeared to be confused.\u201cWhat are you shocked about, go over there and take a look! We must give the examinees an impartial examination environment, if there\u2019s a problem then we must immediately go and fix it,\u201d the Principal said righteously.The three examiners immediately went over to inspect, and they also quickly discovered the hidden Dark Stone.\u201cThat\u2019s weird. We\u2019ve already inspected this before, how could something like this pop up from nowhere?\u201d another examiner said in astonishment.Whenever a student\u2019s examination was over, they would inspect it again. When Mu Bai had finished, the person who had gone over to examine the stone was precisely the bald examiner.This time, the bald examiner was really scared! Covering up for someone framing others on the examination, that was a big crime.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Director Wang, why don\u2019t you go to the storage room and grab another Star Appraisal Stone. Although the Star Appraisal Stone is useful, it\u2019s just a little fragile. After receiving interference of different energies, it\u2019d start having problems. I\u2019d really like to thank Mrs. Tangyue for finding out the problem with just a glance, you\u2019re really covering up for our mistakes.\u201dThis Mu He was really an old fox, he immediately covered up the matter. Thus, the three examiners were simply unable to report the actual problem.Tangyue\u2019s brow furrowed, she knew that this matter probably had something to do with Mu He.If she were to make this matter public, the school directors would be quite difficult to deal with. After thinking it over, it would also affect the student\u2019s examinations, so it was better if she just left it alone.\u201cAlright, redo the test.\u201d\u201cRedo the test!\u201d\u201cStudent Mo Fan, there were some small problems with the Star Appraisal Stone. The grade from before is invalid, we will give you one more chance to redo the examination.\u201d The bald examiner held onto a straw of hope as he quickly said this.Mo Fan looked at these people as though he was looking at a group of clowns. You want to play? Keep on playing, this Father, I, am waiting!\u201cGreat, go take the test again. At most, you\u2019ll receive a D, how could you receive a B? Third Brother, we can once again leave the school in a natural manner,\u201d Lu Xiaobing said with excitement._The heavens didn\u2019t turn his back on I, Lu Xiaobing. I\u2019m so thankful that Mrs. Tangyue discovered the problem. Just like I said, how could Mo Fan, a person who has even worse luck than me, have his luck turned over?_\u201cMrs. Tangyue, why did you even bother? Giving the student another chance isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing.\u201d Xue Musheng didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh as he said this to Tangyue.So it really was the Star Appraisal Stone malfunctioning, this made Xue Musheng feel bad.What should be happening was really coming at last. The penalty that no one had received in three years was finally going to land on a student in his own class!\u201cHaha, how could I, Huang Feifeng possibly be at the very bottom. Mrs. Tangyue, you are a hero, I really admire you,\u201d Huang Feifeng said, as if he was relieved of a burden.On the other side, Mu Bai\u2019s dog of a henchmen was also extremely happy._Almost scared the hell out of me, I really thought this dreg was making a comeback. Even I, Zhao Kunsan, have only gotten a B!_\u201cGood, good, Mu Bai, this broken Star Appraisal Stone almost secured the kid\u2019s entrance. I\u2019ve come to realize that Mrs. Tangyue is increasingly more like the lover of my dreams.\u201d Zhao Kunsan wiped the cold sweat off himself as he continued, \u201cOh, Mu Bai, why do you still have such a long face? Didn\u2019t they say that he only received a B due to the malfunction of the Star Appraisal Stone? Don\u2019t worry, he will definitely get out of here.\u201d\u201cCould you shut up, you\u2019re annoying!\u201d Mu Bai snapped, as his mood was exceedingly bad.Zhao Kunsan withdrew. He didn\u2019t know how he had offended his master.\u2026\u2026The examination of the other classes had basically ended. Due to the examination of the eighth class having some problems, many of the people began to gather around them, including the top students of the other classes.At this time, Mo Fan accidentally became the focus point of everyone.\u201cAlright, Mo Fan, you may redo your exam. Mrs. Tangyue, you\u2019ve also inspected it, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems this time right?\u201d the bald examiner asked with a flattering smile.\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue replied. Her dark eyes might have scorched his face for all the friendliness in them.Mo Fan once again stood in front of the Star Appraisal Stone. This time, he didn\u2019t feel a cold air coming off of it.It really was Mu Bai\u2019s fault!Mo Fan humphed coldly. Thankfully, the sexiest and most enchanting Mrs. Tangyue discovered this so early, or else Mo Fan would appear to be lower than a piece of poop in front of the school directors!Mo Fan closed his eyes and placed his hands on top of the Star Appraisal Stone. The cold Star Appraisal Stone quickly turned warm from the circulation of Mo Fan\u2019s Stardust energy.The radiance began to intensify, and the scarlet radiance looked as though it was burning from within. The radiance this time didn\u2019t suffer from any kind of suppression as it was released. It spread around the Star Appraisal Stone, and it even began to leak out of it!\u201cThis\u2026this radiance!!!\u201dThe first one to reveal an incredibly surprised face was precisely Mu Zhuoyun. The Principal, Vice-Principal, the Disciplinary teachers, and the School Directors also widened their eyes.\u201cThe radiance is flowing out!\u201d The homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng was thoroughly flabbergasted. After being a teacher for so many years, how could he not see the meaning behind the overflowing radiance?In this entire school, only Mu Bai had achieved the state of overflowing radiance. It was not just because the flames were already relatively bright, but the overflowing of the Fire radiance was even a bit stronger than Mu Bai\u2019s Ice radiance!_Damn!!!_The surrounding students from other classes, and the students from the eight class were all trampled to near death by the word \u2018Damn!\u2019 in their hearts._Overflowing radiance, this really is overflowing radiance!_A student who was considered a weak-minded dreg had actually achieved the state of overflowing radiance!!\u201cS\u2026S\uff1f\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s S\u2026it really seems to be S.\u201d\u201cHow about\u2026how about we inspect it once more?\u201dCrazy. The bald headed Director Wang and the other two examiners had gone crazy. The classmates who thought that Mo Fan would get swept out of the school had also gone crazy.Shit, this is the real malfunctioning of the Star Appraisal Stone. How could that guy\u2019s cultivation be at this kind of level??\u201cIt\u2019s an illusion, it must be an illusion!\u201d\u201cI refuse to believe it, I REFUSE to believe it!!\u201d The water element student Xiaobing was wailing like a ghost._What happened to us leaving the school together??__Let\u2019s forget about the fact that you didn\u2019t honor your title as a failure of a student, but you even became a Divine student. This time there will be no one who will stop me in my way, this daddy, I will jump into the river. If Mo Fan can become a Divine student, then I, a Water elemental Magician probably can drown to death?!_The normally expressionless Mu Ningxue was completely showing her emotions at this time. That\u2019s right, not even she imagined that the final result would be like this!For a person like Mo Fan that didn\u2019t have any particularly special talent, or a family property, receiving a B was already quite normal.However, he achieved overflowing radiance, the overflowing radiance of the Fire element. That was already one level ahead of Mu Bai, who had received resources from his family.For some reason, Mu Ningxue\u2019s heart bloomed with a sunshine that was like the overflowing radiance coming from the Fire element.\u201cThat really causes one to feel extremely shocked. I almost missed out on an even more remarkable student,\u201d a school director exclaimed in admiration after seeing this event.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t dare to imagine what kind of disaster would be brought over if we were to only give him a B while also causing our school to lose out on such a prominent Magician.\u201d\u201cBetter late than never! Mrs. Tangyue, we are really grateful to your ability to spot details!\u201dAs Mrs. Tangyue saw the School directors flattering her, she only returned a small smile. The truth was, even Tangyue herself was extremely surprised.All this time, she had been thinking that the most outstanding Fire elemental student in her class was Zhoumin. But to everyone\u2019s surprise, this Mo Fan was even more remarkable. The most important thing was that he had always been calmly cultivating, not having the need to compete nor laying himself bare to others. This kind of temperament was very suitable for becoming a Magician.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her small face was clearly showing her disbelief.This student who she always loathed for not making progress\u2026 he was actually stronger than Mu Bai?She had actually been making a mistake this entire time?All of their shock and disbelief wasactually far inferior to the defeated look on Mu Bai\u2019s face.His expression couldn\u2019t even be described as an expression, it was practically a whole distortion. Even his cramping facial muscles were twitching.What was worse than being completely flipped over by the person they hated the most?The dog of a henchmen, Zhao Kunsan rubbed his eyes over and over again. However, what he saw was still the overflowing radiance. The superiority he was displaying toward Mo Fan was completely obliterated, making him seem like a comical retard, looking all lofty in the middle of the people.\u201cS!\u201d\u201cS!\u201d\u201cS!\u201d\u201cFinal result is \u2018S\u2019!\u201dThe highest score in school was S. However, everyone was very clear on the fact that the magical capabilities within Mo Fan\u2019s Stardust were probably higher than Mu Bai by a bit.\u201cMo Fan, do you wish to continue the exam?\u201d\u201cNaturally!\u201d Mo Fan gave the examiner a slight smile._This daddy, I, have been waiting for this for a long time!__Man, if it wasn\u2019t for the world changing, then I would\u2019ve already have reached this level during the High School examination. Fortunately, the outcome is still good!_Mo Fan naturally wanted to test his activation.Weren\u2019t most of the people bitterly cultivating just so they can appear as that little golden idol in front of others, glinting and shining?\u201cFire Burst!\u201dHis entire aura was moving. After Mo Fan said his incantation, his whole bearing was very self-confident.A searing aura frantically spread from the central point of Mo Fan\u2019s body, washing over the cheeks of hundreds of people. The feel of the scorching heat was very distinct.The Fire Star Path quickly mobilized around Mo Fan\u2019s body after he finished the arrangement of the stars.The obtrusive scarlet red and the staggering fire!The flame scuttled forth from the half-clenched hand of Mo Fan, just like a vicious and impatient animal.\u201cGo!\u201dAs he waved his hand, the flames streaked across the exam grounds like a dazzling scarlet fire arrow. It accurately made its way into the human-shaped puppet\u2019s body.\u201c _Burn!_ \u201dHe raised his hand up high. After a second of silence, the vicious fire suddenly blasted forth from inside the puppet\u2019s body.The more it burned, the more vicious it was. That raging fire engulfed the puppet in matter of seconds.The reflection of the flames were visible on Mo Fan\u2019s face. His face was smiling, and his confidence was soaring.This was Fire Burst, the fire force he was in control of! There was no need to mention its charm!After finishing all of this, Mo Fan turned around.Every single person was dumbstruck.The teachers, students, directors, they hadn\u2019t even completely recovered their senses from the S grade he had gotten from his previous examination. However, then they saw Mo Fan\u2019s extremely smooth casting of Fire Burst.There was no hesitation, and neither was it forced. Additionally, the speed he had completed it at was even faster than Mu Bai!The Fire Element\u2019s primary spell was much more violent than the Ice Element\u2019s. That was why the reaction of the people was much more intense than Mu Bai\u2019s Ice Spread after Mo Fan finished the casting of Fire Burst. Not only was it Mo Fan\u2019s beautiful turnaround, but it was also because of the boundless power of his Fire Element aura.\u201cGive your marks,\u201d Mo Fan glanced at the astonished examiners as he said this in a natural manner.\u201cA!\u201d\u201cB!\u201d\u201cA!\u201dThe grades for the casting test were immediately announced.As expected, Mo Fan\u2019s grades were higher than Mu Bai\u2019s.Mu Bai was already so angry that he felt as though he was about to get a heart attack. If this continued, then he really would stop breathing!How could it be like this, this didn\u2019t conform with the script!!Both of the scores were higher than Mu Bai\u2019s!\u201cIs this really the Mo Fan that we know??\u201d\u201cThis really is the most amazing turnaround in history. He became a divine student in just a second, it\u2019s really blinding my dog eyes!\u201d Xu Qinglin said.Xue Musheng\u2019s mouth had a crooked smile.He didn\u2019t care about the enmity between Mo Fan and Mu Bai. His class suddenly popped up a student with the S grade, and his grades for the activation test were the highest. If everything went well, then wouldn\u2019t he be Number One in the entire school?_From last place all the way to first place. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing more shocking than this, it\u2019s like a dream.__Other than him being Number One, Mu Bai should be able to settle steadily into second place._Thus, the first and second-ranked students were in his class. This would give him a promotion!\u201cAs expected of the Mu Family. Brother Mu Zhuoyun, you really had our small-scaled Magician Organization have an eye-opening experience. If I remember correctly, this Mo Fan is the son of the driver at your manor. Being in a large, noble family sure is great, you even unconsciously influenced a preeminent student in Bo City!\u201d said Deng Kai from the Hunter\u2019s Union.Mu Zhuoyun looked at Deng Kai.Deng Kai was in the upper echelon of the Hunter\u2019s Union, and at same time, he was also a director of Tian Lan Magic High. Amongst the school directors, his cultivation was the highest, and his strength was also the greatest.As a school director, Deng Kai was praising, and the other school directors were continually sighing.\u201cYou can\u2019t help but admire that. A son of a driver is already this amazing, he\u2019s comparable to the magic seedlings which they have carefully raised!\u201dMu Zhuoyun was slowly coming back to his senses from being shocked.He really didn\u2019t think that this Mo Fan would have some ability. Right now, he even heard praise coming from the people in his circle, his face immediately lit up.As his mood got better, Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s heart also began to ponder.Mu Ningxue had carried the flag for the family for many years. However, the other direct successors and branch disciples all required support from the family. Only this way were they able to consolidate power within the family.The Mu Family were very short in Magicians who specialized in the Fire Element.Although this kid had done things that had caused him to feel incomparably angry, he was just young and inexperienced. It had already been so many years since then, there was no need to continue investigating it. It was about time to give some benefit to this kid so he would start to serve the Mu Family.He would definitely not approach Mu Ningxue. However, he could send him to his eldest son, Mu Jiangming, and nurture him into an remarkable Fire Element henchman. That was not a bad plan.A talented person still needed to be recruited!Mu Zhuoyun stroked his beard, feeling somewhat happy. After seeing Mo Fan exiting the examination ground, he opened his mouth to say, \u201cMo Fan, come here.\u201dMo Fan glanced at Mu Zhuoyun, he wasn\u2019t sure what this old scoundrel wanted from him.With some hesitation, Mo Fan walked over in front of the directors. His eyes couldn\u2019t help but take a glance at Mu Ningxue.Damn, I haven\u2019t seen this girl in so many years, how come she looks so\u2026 beautiful!Mu Zhuoyun _hmpfed_.Mu Ningxue also moved her gaze away.Mo Fan also withdrew his gaze.\u201cYou called?\u201d Mo Fan raised his head and looked at the Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s tall and sturdy physique.In front of others, Mo Zhuoyun would have a whiff of the prestige of a King, causing them to feel even afraid to breathe in front of him.Mo Fan was different. Other than raising a beautiful daughter, to him Mo Zhuoyun only emitted the aura of an old scoundrel.__________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your fire-elemental talent is not bad at all; your cultivation even surprised me. Thus, I\u2019d like to give these resources to you. From now on, when you\u2019re not attending classes, you may cultivate with Mu Jiangming,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun said as he stroked his beard.These words were said in public!From Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s point of view, doing this also gave Mo Fan a lot of face!The branch disciples within the manor scheme, wanting to display their abilities to me; yet, I don\u2019t even give them the slightest bit of attention. A person like Mo Fan, who isn\u2019t even a disciple of the Mu family, receiving this kind of opportunity is simply a huge leap in fortune!In this society, there would always be some exceptions. With him being the Head of the Mu Family, he couldn\u2019t just be narrow or small minded and only pay attention to the disciples within.\u201cBrother\u2026this\u2026how could this be? Mu Bai\u2019s talent is even better. Perhaps he was just a bit nervous today; thus he wasn\u2019t able to display his utmost abilities. Also, he is from our family, to begin with\u2026..\u201d Mu He was extremely shocked; he hastily spoke to Mu He.After Mu Bai, who felt as though his heart had been pierced by thousands of arrows, heard this, he seemed as if he were a corpse being viciously whipped all over. It was a hideous appearance!Damn, that was the opportunity to become an inner disciple which Mu Bai was looking for!Mu Bai racked his brain so that he could erase the title of being just a branch disciple. Only after becoming a true core disciple of the Mu Family would he receive even more generous cultivation resources and no longer be that half a young master who freeloads under someone else\u2019s roof.It doesn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t receive it, but it was taken away by the person he hated the most!This corpse was so pissed off; it almost resurrected!\u201cI have already made the decision. Mu He, you do not need to speak anymore,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun waved his hand, his face maintained that slight smile as he looked at Mo Fan.What\u2019s wrong; are you getting too happy?Hurry up and thank this Master for his kindness?Mu Zhuoyun was relatively pleased with the fact that he could forget the former enmity and recruit the student who had no background. It seemed like he was a very understanding ruler.\u2026\u2026\u201cMo Fan, why are you still startled? Hurry up and thank Master for his good grace,\u201d Xue Musheng hastily urged Mo Fan.Zhang Xiaohou, Lu Xiaobing, and Xu Qinglin were admiring him to no end.In the past, Mo Fan was just a small, insignificant thing that one wouldn\u2019t be able to find in the sea of people. In just a flash, he had become Mr. Perfect!Mo Fan looked at Mu Zhuoyun who had a slight smile on his face; his own expression was quite startled.Mo Fan regained his senses; he squished his lips together.After a period had passed, Mo Fan finally opened his mouth, \u201cDid your brain get flooded with water or something?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s face was filled with doubt; it seemed like he didn\u2019t hear what the kid said.\u201cI said, did water flood your brain or something?!\u201d Mo Fan asked what he had before, word for word.Everyone was able to clearly hear these words; however, their expressions were filled with confusion.What???Brain get flooded?He said Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s brain was flooded?Heavens, this Mo Fan has gone crazy!Mu Zhuoyun heard this very clearly. He ferociously blew his beard as he carried a bit of rage and replied, \u201cYour next few words better be a good explanation, or else\u2026\u201d\u201cAn explanation? Of course, I have one,\u201d Mo Fan nodded as he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t suppress my family three years ago with your strong sense of justice. I, Mo Fan, am not someone who you can slap and then give some benefit for me to devote my life to you. Three years ago, you said things to my dad and I that were as if you were looking at a dog. Your memory may be bad, but I remember it very clearly. I\u2019ll just tell you like this, you old scoundrel; don\u2019t say that you want me to join your family as a disciple for my sake. Even if you were to send Mu Ningxue along with a dowry to me so I could enter your family, I still wouldn\u2019t do it! Do you really think that all the people in the world revolve around your Mu Family? And you even expect me to be moved to tears?? Other than your brain getting flooded, I can\u2019t think of what other kinds of problems you would have today!\u201dAs he cursed, it was as though the suppressed anger within his heart was completely spat out. The entire process was completely smooth.The Principal, the school directors, director Deng Kai, Mu He, Mu Bai, Zhao Kunsan, Xue Musheng, the students of eight class, as well as Mu Ningxue were completely shocked.Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s face was exceedingly gloomy at this point.Creak~As he was angered by this, beneath Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s feet grew a frozen, firm crystal ice. The cold aura emanated from the person\u2019s anger was pervading throughout the air!Mu Zhuoyun was angry, really angry!He didn\u2019t know how many years it had been since someone spoke to him like this. Calling him the tyrant of Bo City wasn\u2019t completely wrong. The high tiered people of the same generation, the Principals of the Magic schools, the high-status people from Magic Association, and even Deng Kai from the Hunter\u2019s Union would always treat him with respect. Even the people from the manor would be unable to breathe when they were in front of him. Who just gave this kid, Mo Fan, the guts to talk to him like that??!!The aura filled the grounds.A frightening ice ground!The grounds filled with sand and grains were completely frozen into a solid ice crystal in just a few seconds with Mu Zhuoyun in the center!The icy aura was vicious. The hot, summer day suddenly became winter. The training grounds also turned into an ice floor, like a gigantic mirror!This mind-blowing scene scared the school\u2019s students and caused them cry out in fear!The training ground turned into an ice floor in just an instant. Mu Zhuoyun didn\u2019t even cast any magic; he only relied on his aura to freeze the entire training ground. Just what kind of boundary had his cultivation reached?Comparing Mu Bai\u2019s previous, small Ice Spread, Mu Zhuoyun was simply a huge monster, incomparable.\u201cZhuoyun, control your mood. This is a school, and there are also students with no defensive capabilities,\u201d The school director who was also from the Hunter\u2019s Union, Deng Kai, suddenly stood up, standing between Mu Zhuoyun and Mo Fan.As Deng Kai stood in between them, Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s intimidating power became somewhat weaker. However, the people in the surroundings were still intimidated to the point where they had difficulties breathing.As Deng Kai stood in between them, a few people who could still move and Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s pace came to a halt.Tangyue didn\u2019t permit Mu Zhuoyun to harm her students, even if she wasn\u2019t a match for the Mu Zhuoyun, the Ice elemental Family Head.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: FluffyGoblyn*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What are you saying?! Immediately apologize to Mr. Mu Zhuoyun!\u201d Mu He said with great anger.Was this Mo Fan stupid beyond redemption or something? He even had the guts to act like this in front of Mu Zhuoyun! Was his family tired of living?!\u201cApologize? Of course I will. However, he must also apologize to me regarding the matter from three years ago. Don\u2019t think you can scare me with your high cultivation and authority. This Mu Zhuoyun used his cultivation to bully me, a student who hasn\u2019t even turned 18 yet. Let\u2019s put it like this; if you were the same age as me, I would be able to beat you up real good!\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s fearless gesture was currently being displayed in great detail.\u201cBullshit!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun was getting really pissed off by this bastard kid, so much that he directly began to swear.When Mu Zhuoyun was at his age, even though his talent may not have matched Mu Ningxue\u2019s, he was still a genius. He naturally didn\u2019t place any of the students within Tian Lan Magic High in his eyes!\u201cMo Fan, you really are shamelessly daring! Don\u2019t even mention Master Mu Zhuoyun when he was young, we could randomly grab a core disciple from the current Mu Family and he\u2019d be able to beat you down with a single move!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we don\u2019t even need to use core disciples. I, Mu Bai could duel you in magic. If you lose, then you must kneel down and apologize to Master Mu!\u201d At this time, Mu Bai came to life and jumped down to be used as a dog by Mu Zhuoyun.Mu Bai and Mo Fan were peers, it would be a fair duel. _Let\u2019s see what other excuses you\u2019ll have!_ , thought Mu Bai.With this, Mu Bai would beat Mo Fan to death and firmly ease Master Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s resentments.\u201cNot necessary.\u201dJust as Mu Bai was about to step up bravely, an icy, arrogant voice resounded.Everyone\u2019s gaze immediately turned toward the voice that spoke up.The person who said this was precisely Mu Ningxue. Who would\u2019ve imagined that Mu Ningxue would make a move at this time?Mu Ningxue came between her father and Mo Fan. Her gaze was like an ice mountain that carried a bit of anger.The person she was angry at was naturally Mo Fan.\u201cSince you said my father only knows how to bully the younger generation\u2026since you said that my father used his authority to suppress you, and you relied on your own cultivation to develop your magic\u2026\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m the same age as you, I\u2019ll compete with you!\u201d In Mu Ningxue\u2019s tranquil voice was an icy power.\u201cNingxue??\u201d After Mu Zhuoyun saw his own daughter come out, the anger on his face changed into astonishment.As Mo Fan saw that it was Mu Ningxue who was facing him, his face sprouted a smile that said he\u2019d rather die than surrender_Interesting, even Mu Ningxue came forth,_ he thought.The truth is, facing a worthless person like Mu Bai was completely useless. Mo Fan had already stomped him over earlier today. However, Mu Ningxue had been credited as the number one girl genius of Bo City, and a blessed daughter of the heavens within the Imperial Institution. Thus, having her duel him would prove to be much more interesting.\u201cNingxue, I am enough to deal with this guy, there\u2019s no need for you to\u2026\u201d Mu Bai promptly said with a smile.\u201cMy father has been thoroughly humiliated. My father can be magnanimous and not bother with this sharp tongued little thief. However, I, as his daughter, simply will not let the person who has humiliated my father off! We\u2019ll settle it by using an impartial Magic Duel!\u201d Each and every word said by Mu Ningxue was sincere, there was not a hint of hesitation in her voice.\u201cGood, well said! This icy, lofty and unyielding character makes us, the older generation very gratified! As expected of the number one genius of Bo City! Having an outstanding talent at such a young age while having the ability to distinguish between right and wrong!\u201d School Director Deng Kai immediately began praising her.After he praised her, Director Deng Kai also patted Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s back as he said, \u201cBrother Zhuoyun, having you deal with this rude kid is not necessary at all. Naturally, you can\u2019t return to when you were 16 to duel him, proving whether he\u2019s better than you when you were young. It\u2019s better to let your daughter Mu Ningxue take your place in this matter and silence this kid that does not know the immensity of heavens and earth.\u201dMu Zhuoyun didn\u2019t say anything as he just stared at Deng Kai.As Deng Kai saw that Mu Zhuoyun was still able to control his temper, he gave a slight smile before he walked in front of Mo Fan and said, \u201cMo Fan, right? As the person in charge of the Hunter\u2019s Union within Bo City, I really am not sure on whether your actions today can be described as you being young and inexperienced, or just simply stupid. However, you should apologize to Mu Zhuoyun for your hot-headed action, the contributions he has made to Bo City are far beyond what you can comprehend.\u201d\u201cApologize? That\u2019s not a problem. I can cover my entire body in thorns and use the most traditional method, kowtowing, to apologize to him. I\u2019ll even kowtow until he\u2019s satisfied. However, are the Mu Family in the right to have me apologize to them? Go ask them regarding what they said to my family three years ago. If I were to apologize, then it\u2019d be after they have apologized for the matter three years ago. Since he is a respected person of Bo City, then they should know better than to provoke nobodies. You can slap a nobody to death with just a single palm, but before they get slapped to death, they would definitely curse you till your brain breaks!\u201d Mo Fan said without inhibition.\u201cThis is a society ruled by law. How could this kind of thing happen? At most, we\u2019d just expel you,\u201d the Principal said as he creased his eyebrows.\u201cAlright, since things have come to this point, then it\u2019s not as difficult to deal with as I thought. Then we\u2019ll do according to what Mu Ningxue said, she will have a magic duel with you. If you lose, then you will have to apologize until Mu Zhuoyun is satisfied. If Mu Ningxue loses\u2026\u201d As Deng Kai reached this point, his gaze turned toward Mu Zhuoyun.Mu Zhuoyun said with a cold voice, \u201cHow could Mu Ningxu lose?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to talk spout so much garbage, just say if you dare or not!\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s tone carried a sharp dagger.Dignity wasn\u2019t something that would be grander just because you\u2019re from an aristocratic family. Even moreso if your own family was homeless, miserable, and lower than dirt. Mo Fan was just a nobody, a nobody who sought revenge for his grievance!Have him join Mu Family?Mo Fan was unable to forget the words Mu Zhuoyun said three years ago that sounded as though he was disciplining a dog. And he definitely was unable to forget the fact that Mu He was responsible for them being homeless. If he were to eager to go back to them just because Mu Zhuoyun threw him a bone, then he himself would really be a dog! At that point, how would he be any different from Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai?Saying profanities to him?That should be normal!Three years ago, when he was just thirteen years old, he had the guts to point at Mu Zhuoyun and call him an old scoundrel. Now that he was sixteen years old, how could he possibly be afraid of him?\u2018Once bitten by a snake, three years shy from the rope\u2019; this was a phrase that was well disposed to Mo Fan. If a snake dared to bite him, then he would definitely act like the snake was a rope and swing it away!When you were already being seen as an ant in someone\u2019s eyes, there was no way for you to run away from that colossal foot. You might as well just curse at them until you were satisfied.\u201cBrother Zhuoyun, do you agree?\u201d Deng Kai acted like a mediator.Currently, the argument and cursing had been seen by the entire school. If they were able to direct this ugly affair towards a fair Magic Duel, that would naturally be the best option. If they really were to expel this student called Mo Fan, it would be meaningless. It would cause the school to lose a genius. Being able to take the number one spot in Tian Lan Magic High meant he was indeed a good seedling.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if Mu Ningxue wholeheartedly wanted to help him dissolve this matter, he would definitely not suppress his tone.Yu Ang was the cultivation lunatic of the Mu Family. Whenever someone mentioned this person, their whole body would feel a chill. If they were to let Yu Ang handle this matter, then it was guaranteed that Mo Fan would suffer a miserable death!\u201cThe regulations of the Magic Association state that both of the parties involved in the Magic Duel need to be 18 years old. Thus, allow me, Deng Kai, to act as a witness for this matter. The day when Mo Fan and Yu Ang have both reached the age of 18, they will engage in a Magic Duel!\u201d Deng Kai said sincerely.Mu Zhuoyun coldly humphed.Mo Fan nodded his head, \u201cI\u2019d have a bit of difficulty to make my move against a woman, thus, switching to a man is good. I\u2019ll beat him until his father won\u2019t recognize him!\u201dAs Mu Zhuoyun heard Mo Fan still slandering him, he was so enraged he blew into his beard._Wait and see. During the Magic Duel at the age of 18, we\u2019ll make you lose your pride and cover your body with wounds!_The Magic Association, the Hunter\u2019s Union, and the Magic Schools. These organizations unconditionally protected the Magic students. However, as soon as they reached 18, they came of age. Magicians would then have to hold responsibility for their own actions.At the moment, Mu Zhuoyun had no need to lower himself to the same level as a sharp-mouthed kid. In two years, when he had come of age, Mu Zhuoyun might as well let him hover between life and death.\u2026\u2026Mu Zhuoyun had gotten so angry that he already left. The Principal and the others naturally followed behind him.As Mu Ningxue was leaving, she gave Mo Fan a meaningful look. She wanted to say something but while at same time, she didn\u2019t know what to say.Mo Fan knew Mu Ningxue was helping him.Her trying to deal with this matter personally was far better than Mu Zuoyun personally dealing with it. If someone of Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s level were to make a move, they would bring a deadly strike against Mo Fan and his family.Unfortunately, her plan was seen through by her father, Mu Zhuoyun.Mu Zhuoyun knew that Mu Ningxue would be lenient, and thus he switched to a different person. The cultivation madman of Mu Family, Yu Ang, would deal with Mo Fan. Mu Yu Ang was very obedient to Mu Zhuoyun. If Mu Zhuoyun wanted Mu Yu Ang to kill Mo Fan, Yu Ang would do it without hesitation!Mu Zhuoyun had no reason to be lenient toward a little thing that dared to swear at him. For now, he would just let Mo Fan pass the time at the school in ease for two years. Once Mo Fan graduated, Mu Zhuoyun would have him see that going against the Mu Family was just asking for trouble!\u2026\u2026The disturbance finally calmed down and petered out.All of the students looked at the Mo Fan who had been turned into a Divine student as they were reminded of his actions just now. None of them knew what to say.This Mo Fan was crazy!Against the Mu Family, a magic family household, and a noble one, who could pull out anyone and still be able to pressure Tian Lan Magic High\u2026What made this extremely clear was the fact that Mu Bai, an Elite student within Tian Lan Magic High, was just a branch disciple within the Mu Family!Although Mo Fan\u2019s performance today had indeed startled everybody, however, that did not mean he had the qualifications to provoke a colossal family like the Mu Family.(Sigh) Originally, he could\u2019ve become a dragon. Now, there was basically no difference between him and trash.Who didn\u2019t know of the Mu Family being the largest in Bo City? If you offended the Mu Family, then how could you continue to survive in Bo City?Within the school, there was barely the holy ground to protect you. Once you were out in society, you would definitely be dealt with until you had become a tragic sight!Willful, why was he so willful? The opportunity so many people were hoping for was dropped by Mo Fan\u2019s willfulness, leaving behind a colossal foe.\u2026\u2026\u201cBrother Fan, you are too cool. We are scared to death by Master Mu Zhuoyun, only you would call him an old scoundrel over and over again. Haha, in fact, many of us also call him an old scoundrel on the inside.\u201d Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s temperament was somewhat shy, but he had a particular adoration for Mo Fan.Mo Fan was the king of the children within this area of the city. Back in the days, he could gather masses with a single call, even Zhao Kunsan mingled with Big Brother Mo Fan. Only after that incident did Zhao Kunsan start to rely on Mu Bai, and many others no longer dared to play with Mo Fan.Zhang Xiaohou was devoted to Mo Fan. No matter what kind of over-the-boundary thing Mo Fan had done, he would still lift even his feet to clap in admiration!Zhang Xiaohou knew of the matter from three years ago. And now that he had seen Mo Fan striking back without hesitation or fear, he began to admire Mo Fan even more. He would never be as bold as Mo Fan in his lifetime!\u201cThen, do you think Mu Ningxue has been charmed by me?\u201d Mo Fan said as he raised his eyebrow in satisfaction.\u201cEh\u2026that\u2019s hard to say. After all, that old scoundrel is her father,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou replied.\u201cAh, I feel really good today. When I go to the cafeteria later, I\u2019ll get an extra fried egg.\u201d Mo Fan patted Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s shoulder as he felt a flush of success, before walking towards the cafeteria.\u201cHaha, if you saw the looks on Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan, then you\u2019d definitely feel even better,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said as he vented his resentment.That henchman, Zhao Kunsan, had really been beaten until his face had swollen up. Xiaohue bet Kunsan couldn\u2019t even dream of Mo Fan\u2019s cultivation being higher than his by more than a level.Whereas Mu Bai, there\u2019s no need to say more about that. All he did was act like someone he was not and assault the poor on a regular basis. And what was the result of that? In the end, the Wise Martial God, Brother Fan, still got rid of him.Forget it. Mu Bai really was trying to curry favor with Mu He like a son. He just wanted Mu He to help him enter the Mu Family\u2019s inner court, and cultivate together with the core disciples\u2026In the end, that old scoundrel didn\u2019t even take a look at him at all. Instead, he was fixated on Mo Fan. What really stupefied people was that Mo Fan had directly thrown away what Mu Bai dreamt of like it was trash, while at same time, he even made the old scoundrel lose face. Refreshing, it was truly refreshing!Xiaohou didn\u2019t understand what that old scoundrel, Mu Zhuoyun was thinking. Three years ago, the old scoundrel had already experienced Mo Fan\u2019s viper tongue and vicious temperament. Yet, today, he attempted to dismiss the former debt, which merely resulted in Mo Fan, who didn\u2019t hide any of his cards, slandering him greatly.He reckoned Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s blood pressure today had risen by a lot!\u201cHowever, Brother Fan, if that old scoundrel really gave his daughter to you along with a dowry, while begging you to join the Mu Family, would you really decline?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou whispered.\u201cOf course not!\u201d\u201cDamn, Brother Fan, where are your morals?\u201d\u201cEh, what you said does make sense.\u201d Mo Fan suddenly rubbed his chin as he pondered.\u201cYou also think you don\u2019t have morals?\u201d Xiaohou wondered.\u201cGet out of here, I\u2019m saying that the old scoundrel\u2019s apology is useless. It\u2019d be better if he just gave his daughter to me with a dowry!\u201d Mo Fan answered.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That Yu Ang really is abnormal. We don\u2019t even know if you will see the sunlight of your second day as an eighteen year old. You should just stop wishing to marry the Little Princess.\u201d\u201cYu Ang? Hmph, watch me make him look for his teeth on the floor!\u201dIn the past, Mo Fan would consider whether he was capable of opposing the whole Mu Family, so how could the current Mo Fan be afraid of merely the disciples in the younger generations?The ire in his left hand would scorch their outsides crisp and their insides tender, while the lightning in his right hand would lacerate their flesh!\u2026\u2026The final results of the annual examination had been released. When the large blackboard showed Mo Fan in first place, there were numerous people who madly rubbed their eyes in disbelief.How was this Mo Fan so amazing? His examination results were surprisingly impressive; how did he surpass even the Lightning element\u2019s Xu Zhaoting, and that Mu Bai from the Ice elemental family?The matter with the grades had already caused numerous people to widen their eyes. The matter of Mo Fan cursing Mu Zhuoyun in front of everyone, and challenging a disciple of the Mu Family with the school supervisors being the witnesses had quickly been spread amongst the students. As a result, it didn\u2019t take long before Mo Fan became famous in the school. Not only did he become a divine student of the school in a flash, even more surprising was that he was the most reckless student in all of Bo City!The people who had some experience understood that Tian Lan Magic High wasn\u2019t for your average Magicians. There were some impressive students within the one thousand five hundred student body. Sure. However, it was simply not on the same level as some certain Magic Highs and the noble families with deep foundations. The Hunter\u2019s Union, Magic Association, Big families and noble families; any random Magician from them would be enough to suppress all of them.The school was certainly a good choice for both grassroots and dragons. However, that didn\u2019t mean that you could go challenge those second generation wizards!Mo Fan didn\u2019t care about the gossip happening around the school. Other than meditating and practising spellcasting, he would eat and sleep.The only thing worth mentioning was that Mo Fan was placed within the Elite class.The Elite class had a hundred individuals total. They were all in a large classroom, and practised in a large training ground.The students in the Elite class were generally capable of controlling seven stars, it was just that they weren\u2019t proficient enough in spellcasting.Thus, when it was time for Practical classes, each of the elite elemental students demonstrated their magical prowess!The teacher for the Practical classes remained Mrs. Tangyue. It was said that this newly arrived Practical teacher\u2019s cultivation had far surpassed any of the other Practical teachers within the school. Even though she hadn\u2019t been in the school for more than half a year, the Elite class\u2019 Practical classes were being taught by her.The homeroom teacher of the Elite class also remained Xue Musheng.His class had two S grade students. If he wasn\u2019t the homeroom teacher for the Elite class, who else could it be?It was because of Mo Fan that Xue Musheng obtained so many benefits from the School Supervisors. Naturally, the School Supervisors had repeatedly instructed Xue Musheng to fix Mo Fan\u2019s rebellious temperament.Xue Musheng got a headache over this matter. He felt that whether Mo Fan was a failure in school or a divine student, he was just like Buddha, hard to please.\u2026\u2026The new term went by, yet another month passed in a flash.The homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng was standing in the Elite class and coughed, signalling everyone to control their excitement.Why were the students so excited today?Today was the day where the school distributed the Stardust Magic Tools to the Elite class. There was naturally another benefit to being students of the Elite class other than having the best teachers.The reason behind why those large Magic Associations and ancient Magic families were so much more ahead of them, excluding the fact they had abundant knowledge, secrets, and experience, the most important reason would be due to the Stardust Magic Tool.Let\u2019s put it like this: Experience, knowledge, secrets, and teachings would be the software, whereas the Stardust Magic Tool would be the most important hardware!Other large ancient families had all sorts of software, and their technology was first-rate. Even if an average Magician could learn everything from school, they still wouldn\u2019t have the hardware that could be compared to the ancient families.That is to say, this Stardust Magic Tool was quite qualitative. It was capable of nurturing the soul and cultivation, and it would relieve the fatigue the Magician would experience after meditation, allowing them to continue practising. To put it in a way that made more sense, it was like a cooler, decreasing the cooldown of meditation.There was no way around it, Mo Fan wasn\u2019t a paid player. He naturally had to go through the school to obtain the necessary cultivation resources.The competition in school was quite big, it was simply like gold and sand!Fortunately, he was firmly placed on the first rank. Thus, the magic resources he obtained from the school shouldn\u2019t be a small amount. This way, he would be able to cultivate in peace.\u201cThe usage time for the Stardust Magic Tool will be based on the rankings of your annual examination. The higher you are placed, the longer you will be allowed to use it. Naturally, our school is very fair, and thus we will conduct an examination every quarter of the year and rearrange the rankings. The Stardust Magic Tool usage will then change according to the new ranking..\u201cThe other thing to take note of is that you are currently the students of the Elite class, and you possess an advantage a Common class doesn\u2019t have. However, don\u2019t believe for a second that your position is safe. During the quarter year examination, the last ten people will directly be downgraded to the Common class, and the top ten of the Common class will be upgraded to the Elite class. Thus, the pressure of the competition is increasingly big!\u201d Xue Musheng said.This part was no different than his previous world. Mo Fan didn\u2019t think anything of it.There were a lot of people who didn\u2019t like school, and even more who didn\u2019t like high school exams. However, there was one phrase that wasn\u2019t wrong: How are you going to stand on equal ground with a wealthy second generation if you don\u2019t have an education, nor tests?The school\u2019s cultivation resources were not necessarily worse than the large ancestral families, the only difference was that the schools had gold and sand.You\u2019d also have to agree to one phrase: Only gold is able to shine!\u2026\u2026\u201cMo Fan, as the number one in class, you ought to be the first to use the Stardust Magic Tool, and also have it for the longest duration. However, due to your disrespect toward your elders during the annual examination, the time you are allowed to use it has been changed to ten days, down from a month. This is your penalty!\u201d Xue Musheng said with a solemn face.\u201cAh, from a month to ten days, that penalty is way too high. If he could hold himself back from being so impudent, then the one month worth of time would be enough to pull him apart from many others by a lot.\u201d Some students started to discuss these words.\u201cIf he were to bluntly lower his head and agree to joining the Mu Family, then he\u2019d most likely receive even more!\u201d\u201cYeah, why is he so stubborn.\u201dXue Musheng glared, causing the students to quiet down.\u201cMo Fan, do you have any objections regarding this penalty?\u201d Xue Musheng said.\u201cI do not,\u201d Mo Fan replied.Mo Fan naturally needed a Stardust Magic Tool. His cultivation time was already longer than that of others, and with the help of the Stardust Magic Tool, he would be able to do half the work for twice the results.However, it would only have this effect if used continuously over a long period of time. If it was used only in short intervals, it would bring very little value to Mo Fan. Ten days of use? They would do nothing for him.\u201cGreen Tea Man, let me ask you a question.\u201d Mo Fan approached the table of Mu Bai next to him with a solemn expression.\u201cWhat the hell did you just call me?\u201d Mu Bai\u2019s violent temperament immediately appeared.\u201cUh, Mu Bai, let me ask you a question.\u201d* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unfortunately, Mo Fan was strange. This Mo Fan had something to ask him? The two should be irreconcilable.\u201cThat guy named Yu Ang, is he in possession of a Stardust Magic Tool for all 365 days of the year?\u201d Mo Fan asked.Mu Fan began to laugh coldly as he said, \u201cOriginally, he was only allowed to use it three to four months per year. But thanks to you, he is now permitted to use it for longer than half a year at a time!\u201dMo Fan nodded his head and continued asking, \u201cI\u2019ve already provoked the old scoundrel to this extent, that old scoundrel still doesn\u2019t give it to that guy called Yu Ang for a whole year? Is it that the old scoundrel is too greedy, or is he just underestimating me?\u201d\u201cDo you think the Stardust Magic Tool is just a rock on the sidewalk, something there\u2019s a lot of? The entire family has so many disciples. Thus, the Stardust Magic Tool definitely has to have turns. Within the family, only Mu Ningxue has a Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool which she keeps on at all times,\u201d Mu Bai said as he looked down on Mo Fan.\u201cSpirit grade Stardust Magic Tool? The Stardust Magic Tools have different grades?\u201d Mo Fan asked in shock.He only knew of the effect of the Stardust Magic Tool, he wasn\u2019t aware of the fact that there were different grades of them.Mu Bai looked at Mo Fan as though he was looking at a retard._This retard simply knows nothing, just how did he cultivate to S grade?_Mu Bai was very proud and wanted to display his knowledge. Thus, he was showing how much he despised Mo Fan on one hand, while on the other he said, \u201cStardust Magic Tools naturally have good and bad ones. The Soul Nourishing Magic Tools which we are able to interact with are basically all Common grade. I reckon there\u2019s only a very few of the Spirit grade ones in the entirety of Bo City.\u201d\u201cWhat effects do the Spirit grades ones have?\u201d Mo Fan continued asking.\u201cCommon grade, it is able to roughly increase cultivation time by 20% every day. Spirit grade, it is able to increase the cultivation time by 40%,\u201d Mu Bai sneered at him.As he was talking about the Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tools, Mu Bai\u2019s entire being was unable to hold back on his fascination for it. To people like him who had only just taken their first step onto the road of cultivation, these Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tools were simply perfect. Possessing one would easily allow him to surpass those of the same age!\u201cI see.\u201d Mo Fan nodded his head.One that could cut accumulated fatigue by 20% and one that could cut it by 40%, Mo Fan was quite able to understand this effect!\u201cDon\u2019t get too ahead of yourself. The cultivation Magic Tool you obtained you get for only ten days. Whereas I will have it for a whole month, I\u2019ll quickly surpass you by thousands of miles!\u201d Mu Bai exclaimed without hesitation, pouring a bucket of cold water over Mo Fan.Mo Fan didn\u2019t mind. If he were to quarrel with nobodies like Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan, that would simply lower his social status. His real enemies were the inner disciples of Mu Family that possessed rich resources! He planned to surmount all difficulties and make that old scoundrel promise his daughter and deliver a dowry to the man in front of him!\u201cRemember, the Stardust Magic Tools are very, very precious. You must not in any way damage it. Moreover, once the time is up, you must return it. I have already reminded all of you, this isn\u2019t something you can blindly make trouble for!\u201d Xue Musheng said with a very serious tone.\u2026\u2026On the nightfall, the dormitory had already turned off all the lights. Darkness fell around the entire campus.On the roof of the school building, Mo Fan was sitting on top of a large water storage tank as he played with the Stardust Magic Tool he had received today.The Stardust Magic Tool was a tiny, azure colored dust stone that was set within a very precious casing. One could tell how much the school valued the Stardust Magic Tool.The Tool had been polished, with a white chain passing through it. This allowed cultivators to wear it like a pendant on their chest.\u201cDoes it work as soon as I put it on?\u201d Mo Fan asked himself.Lowering his head a bit, Mo Fan slowly put the Stardust Magic Tool on. Since the chain was a bit long, the Tool ended up laying on Mo Fan\u2019s chest._Ding~_Suddenly, a unfathomable tapping echoed out of Mo Fan\u2019s chest.Mo Fan was stunned before he finally came back to his senses.He was wearing yet another necklace about his neck.This loach-shaped pendant was pitch black. He remembered that on the day he Awakened his element, this thing was vibrating incessantly.The Stardust Magic Tool must have bumped into his loach shaped pendant, explaining the sound from just now.Speaking of which, just what was this Loach Pendant?Mo Fan had actually been trying to research the construction behind it, but ultimately failed. At the same time, he was very convinced that the Loach Pendant was the reason behind the changes to the world.The Loach Pendant was the legacy of the old gatekeeper of the school\u2019s back mountain, Old Man Ying. That day, he was wearing this exact Loach Pendant as he slept in that thatched cottage when the whole world began to mysteriously change, or he transmigrated into a different parallel world, he still wasn\u2019t sure of which.Mo Fan always wore the Loach Pendant, and he was a little worried about removing it, in case everything would return to normal if he were to do so. _Man, I went through great difficulties to learn Lightning Strike and Flame Burst!_\u201cForget it, don\u2019t worry about him. I should pay more attention to my own cultivation. That guy Yu Ang won\u2019t be easy to deal with. Furthermore, if that old scoundrel really were willing to deliver his daughter to me, it will be impossible if I don\u2019t have incredible power!\u201d Mo Fan thought to himself.As he put down the Loach Pendant, Mo Fan used his Intent to enter the Stardust Magic Tool which he had just received.Intent appeared after a Magician\u2019s spiritual mind had reached a formidable level. When you focused the Intent of your spiritual mind and locked it onto something, you could perceive the peculiar fluctuations of Magic Ability, and your senses of hearing, smell, sight, and touch would become stronger than an ordinary person.\u201cStrange, there\u2019s no reaction. Xue Musheng said as long as you enter it with your Intent and leave behind a Spiritual imprint, then the Stardust Magic Tool will transmit its nourishing spiritual energy to your body, allowing a Magician\u2019s body to obtain a nourishing effect as well as relieving spiritual fatigue.\u201dMo Fan attempted this a few times. He didn\u2019t feel the wonderful response from the Stardust Magic Tool, which Xue Musheng had described.Eh?The Loach Pendant had overflowing energy?Mo Fan\u2019s expression was shocked as he hastily probed the Loach Pendant with his Intent.As he probed it with his Intent, Mo Fan\u2019s entire being felt as though he landed in a hot spring. Silky smooth warmth caused his exhausted spiritual condition to slowly disperse, while it also slowly caused his own Spiritual world to become clear and cozy.He felt no agitation, nor anxiety. His state of mind had never been so tranquil and cozy before!Mo Fan had already cultivated for a whole ten hours today. Before this, he would already have gone to sleep. Today, he had the Stardust Magic Tool, and he wanted to try it out.The surging fatigue he felt was alleviated under this balmy sensation, he felt like he could still continue to cultivate for a little while longer._Oh crap.__What is this??_The Stardust Magic Tool given by school was of no use. Instead, the Loach Pendant which he had always brought with him began to show the effect the Stardust Magic Tool should\u2019ve shown._Is it possible\u2026is it possible that this Loach Pendant that I have always worn is actually a Stardust Magic Tool?_Mo Fan began to feel a bit of excitement!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So why did it become a Spirit Nourishing hot spring today?__While at same time, the school\u2019s Stardust Magic Tool that should have some effect just happens to be out of use??_\u201cShit, don\u2019t tell me the Loach Pendant absorbed the Stardust Magic Tool\u2019s internal energy!!\u201d Mo Fan suddenly made an astonished wild guess.Mo Fan immediately concentrated his Intent once more. This time, he quickly probed the fluctuations between the two Magic Tools.As expected!Mo Fan could feel the Stardust Magic Tool had a trace of hidden energy in its deepest parts. However, this trace of energy was currently shifting\u2026_Accurately speaking, this freaking Loach Pendant took a straw and started to suck in the energy from the school\u2019s Stardust Magic Tool. If I only realized this later, then I wouldn\u2019t have been able to find any kind of evidence._\u201cFreaking hell, Little Loach, I never thought that you\u2019d actually have some skill. After hiding it for so long, you\u2019ve finally revealed it,\u201d Mo Fan swore as he grabbed the Loach Pendant with one hand._Little Loach, go die Loach!__Hurry and compensate my Stardust Magic Tool. How am I supposed to cultivate when you\u2019ve drained all of its energy\u2026__However, the Loach Pendant just released some energy for me to use. What I should worry about is how I\u2019m supposed to explain to the school regarding this empty shell of a Stardust Magic Tool!__Furthermore, this little Loach Pendant that I swear at everyday\u2026seems\u2026seems to really be a freaking Stardust Magic Tool!_Mo Fan felt his own brain was not enough to process this!! This information was too explosive!_Calm down, calm down, I have to calm down.__I have to hurry and get to the end of this matter._Mo Fan continued sitting there, studying the two tools. He realized the little Loach Pendant he wore actually seemed to have the same function as a Stardust Magic Tool. Mo Fan tried to make the little Loach Pendant return the energy to the Stardust Magic Tool, but the Loach Pendant had no reaction.Mo Fan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.The great thing about it was\u2026the little Loach Pendant was actually a really amazing Stardust Magic Tool.The real tragedy was that the school\u2019s Stardust Magic Tool had been wasted. There was not a shred of energy left in it, it was just like a pebble by the riverbank.The school gave the Stardust Magic Tool to him for ten days. After ten days, he had to return it to them in its original state. It\u2019s not like he could tell Xue Musheng that he was bored, and thus he decided to remodel the Stardust Magic Tool into a loach shape. He can\u2019t even begin to guess what kind of expression Xue Musheng would have after he saw the small Loach Pendant.\u201cMrs. Tangyue is experienced and knowledgeable, perhaps she knows the reason behind this.\u201d Mo Fan knew that him being blindly anxious would be of no use, so he hastily sought some help.Mrs. Tangyue was Mo Fan\u2019s number one choice. After that time when Mrs. Tangyue had seen through the schemes of Mu He and Mu Bai, Mo Fan and she had established a deep teacher to student trust.\u2026\u2026\u201cMrs. Tangyue, are you sleeping?\u201d Mo Fan called Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s phone.\u201cI just changed into my pajamas, about to sleep. Tell me what you want,\u201d a sexy and gentle voice floated back to him. Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but wonder about Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s amazing appearance when wearing a transparent night gown.\u201cMy Stardust Magic Tool seem to have a small problem, I don\u2019t know what to do right now, I could only call Mrs. Tangyue to consult.\u201d Mo Fan assumed a pitiful student\u2019s demeanor.\u201cWhere are you?\u201d After hearing \u2018Stardust Magic Tool\u2019, Mrs. Tangyue seemed to turn somewhat serious.The Stardust Magic Tool was the most precious item in the school. If there was a problem, then it would be big!\u201cThe third building\u2019s roof, on top of the dam.\u201d\u201cAlright, give me three minutes.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue quickly hung up the phone.After hanging up the phone, Mo Fan began to think to himself, _Three minutes. How could Mrs. Tangyue possibly come here from the teacher\u2019s dormitory? Even if Zhang Xiaohou were to use Wind Trail, I reckon he\u2019d need five minutes._What\u2019s more, Mo Fan didn\u2019t think that Mrs. Tangyue would come here without changing her attire.As Mo Fan was still indulging in his fantasies, a weak movement suddenly appeared on the pitch black roof.This movement was extremely weak. If Mo Fan hadn\u2019t carefully noticed it from the beginning, he would have not seen it. It didn\u2019t seem to be an air fluctuations, nor was it the aura from elemental energy. The noiselessness caused him to feel somewhat terrified.\u201cMo Fan?\u201d At last, a gentle and beautiful voice floated over.\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Tangyue?\u201d Mo Fan jumped in fright, hastily looking toward the open roof from his current location.The moonlight sprinkled over the intersection of the water pipes on the old roof. The black cloud\u2019s shadow was revealing a bright yet dark figure on the roof\u2026The first thing that entered Mo Fan\u2019s vision was an indistinct silhouette emerging from the shadows. Immediately after, Mo Fan saw Mrs. Tangyue wearing a long, woman\u2019s-style coat coming out of the shadows of the dark clouds and into the area of moonlight.It felt like Mrs. Tangyue had simply walked out of another door, extremely shocking!\u201cWhat kind of ability is this?\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath.He didn\u2019t even hear footsteps from the corridor. Just how exactly did Mrs. Tangyue come to the roof, and emerge from the shadows?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your Stardust Magic Tool?\u201d Mrs. Tangyue suddenly leapt down and landed on the dam.The bright moon illuminated Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s impressive physique, it made Mo Fan\u2019s heart ripple.\u201cI don\u2019t know either, I did everything according to what Xue Musheng said. I don\u2019t know what happened, but the Stardust Magic Tool\u2019s energy suddenly disappeared, and then\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd then what?\u201dMo Fan was hesitating. He was wondering whether he should tell Mrs. Tangyue about the little Loach Pendant or not.However, his understanding of this world was far too little, if he did not tell her about this matter, then Mrs. Tangyue might not believe him.\u201cAnd then the energy was transferred into my pendant,\u201d Mo Fan told her.Regardless of what it was, he should put trust in this teacher. On the one hand, it was very likely that Tangyue would see through him. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t know how to explain this whole matter to the school.Him slandering Mu Zhuoyun, the school would turn a blind eye to.However, breaking the Stardust Magic Tool, that would give Mu He enough of a reason to kick him out of Tian Lan Magic High.\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026that the Stardust Magic Tool given to you by the school has had its energy transferred to your pendant??\u201d Tangyue widened her bright eyes as she revealed a somewhat disbelieving expression.\u201cYes,\u201d Mo Fan nodded.\u201cWhere did your pendant come from?\u201d Tangyue\u2019s expression had an obvious change.\u201cHeritage,\u201d Mo Fan replied.Tangyue immediately turned silent. Furthermore, she used her intelligent eyes to look at Mo Fan and then at his pendant.\u201cHave you told this matter to anyone else?\u201d Tangyue\u2019s expression was very serious as she said this to Mo Fan.Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but feel startled. This was like a classic tv show where they\u2019d murder someone for their belongings. Seeing the surroundings, the weather, the dark night, a certain student couldn\u2019t handle the pressure of studying magic, thus, he jumped off the roof. Wasn\u2019t everything conforming to the script?* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If my judgement is really that bad, then having who I thought to be the reliable Mrs. Tangyue help me with this problem, I get whatever I deserve._\u201cYour pendant is also a Stardust Magic Tool.\u201d At last, Mrs Tangyue opened her mouth.\u201cMhm,\u201d Mo Fan listened sincerely.\u201cHowever, it is different from the Stardust Magic Tool we usually see; it is a growth-type Stardust Magic Tool,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said with a severe gaze.\u201cGrowth-type Stardust Magic Tool??\u201d Mo Fan had never ever heard of this concept before. If you were to talk about embedding an attribute via a gem, he would understand that theory as there was lots of it in games\u2026\u201cThis Stardust Magic Tool is an absolute gem under the heavens. This is due to it originally having the same function as other Stardust Magic Tools, but it is also capable of growing. It is able to absorb the magical energy from other Stardust Magic Tools in order to boost its own capabilities. After absorbing enough magical energies from other Stardust Magic Tools, it is able to raise its Spiritual level!\u201d Mrs. Tangyue earnestly said to Mo Fan.As Mo Fan heard this, he felt great waves rolling within his heart._A Stardust Magic Tool that is capable of growing???_An extremely average Stardust Magic Tool was considered a treasure by both the school and ancient families. Even an incomparably preeminent student would need to take turns to use it, it only showed how precious and rare they were.A Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool possessed twice the efficiency of a common grade Stardust Magic Tool. Mu Bai also said that within all of Bo City, one could find very few of them. One of the known ones was in Mu Ningxue\u2019s possession.One wouldn\u2019t need to guess to know that it is most likely a treasure of the Mu Family!The little Loach Pendant actually possessed the ability to grow itself into a treasure of that level._This\u2026 this\u2026_Mo Fan had roughly guessed that this might be an incredible item, but he never thought that it would be incredible to that extent!_Shit!__Shit!!!_With this kind of treasure, even a person with principles would feel jealous and kill another for the item.According to what people said, it was common for Magicians to fight over a treasure!At the moment he was only a small Magician. If Mrs. Tangyue really were to have a change of heart\u2026then the news tomorrow really would have the story \u2018A certain genius from Tian Lan Magic High jumped off the roof due to the pressure from school. More on page Two.\u2019\u201cMrs .Tangyue, I feel like a small Magician such as myself is unable to manage a thing so precious. I\u2019ll give it to you so you can research it\u2026\u201d Mo Fan wasn\u2019t a fool; thus, he immediately said this sincerely.Even if Mrs. Tangyue appeared to be a very righteous person, a person\u2019s character was very hard to predict. Mo Fan wasn\u2019t childish enough to think that Mrs. Tangyue wasn\u2019t a bad person just because she\u2019s pretty.\u201cPsh~,\u201d Tangyue immediately started to laugh at what Mo Fan had said. The lovely scene of her laughing was touchingly beautiful.Mo Fan\u2019s expression was blank. He didn\u2019t know what he did to make a beauty like Tangyue laugh like that.\u201cMo Fan, on the day of the annual examination, when you righteously slandered Mu Zhuoyun from that small family, I thought you were a firm and unyielding man. Just now, I was thinking about confiscating your particular treasure; after all, it is not something a small magician like you is able to manage. However, I never thought that the firm and unyielding you would hand it over; that really makes my impression of you take a one-eighty degree turn.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s laugh seemed like a peach blossom to the ear.Mo Fan awkwardly laughed._An unyielding character is only worth so little, a life is more important._Scolding Mu Zhuoyun, Mo Fan was well aware of the consequences.If one were to integrate themselves into this society, one couldn\u2019t be so naive and stupid. Whether it was the science society or the magic society, maturing early, what\u2019s so bad about it?\u201cThen, Mrs. Tangyue, how do you plan on solving this?\u201d Mo Fan asked her.\u201cAlright, I know you are very reluctant to part with it. It\u2019s good that you told me about this. If it was any other teacher, they really would pull something disadvantageous to you in order to stand above thousands of others,\u201d Tangyue\u2019s smile faded as she spoke seriously.Mo Fan\u2019s eyes shone. It seemed like he floated the right way this time. This Mrs. Tangyue really was different from the other Magic teachers who seemed to be righteous, but were something else on the inside.\u201cFirst, you cannot tell anyone about it being a growth-type Stardust Magic Tool\u2026 Eh, I reckon with your intelligence, you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else, anyway. Second, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m not interested in your growth-type Stardust Magic Tool, but it is because the Stardust Magic Tool is somewhat special. It seems like it has a trace of an unbroken spiritual link with you,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue told Mo Fan honestly._Wow, this thing was a binding equipment?_Mo Fan really felt baffled. No wonder why every time he tried to remove the Loach Pendant, an indescribable resistance arose.\u201cLastly, the growth-type Stardust Magic Tool needs to grow. It uses Spirit Essence and other Stardust Magic Tools as fuel. Currently, it is only a common grade Stardust Magic Tool. Despite the Pendant being equipped with the ability to grow, whether it really will grow is hard to say. Or, the resources it requires to grow might be much larger than a Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool. In that sense, your inherited family treasure might be no different than a trash grade tool,\u201d Tangyue said.Mo Fan nodded his head and thought a bit before asking, \u201cMrs. Tangyue, what is Soul Essence?\u201d\u201cAt the moment a Magical Beast dies, its soul will leave its physical body. A soul leaving the body becomes a Spirit after its life has ended. If the soul remains in the body after death, then it will emit a special Spirit radiance. That type of soul after death would be ten times more pure than a common soul, and is called a Spirit Essence. A Spirit Essence is an important material for refining a Stardust Magic Tool.\u201d As expected of a teacher, her easy explanation made Mo Fan have an urge to write it down.\u201cBasically, if I wanted to make it grow, then the best way would be to collect Spirit Essence. Alright, I better hurry up and increase my strength so I can go kill some Magical Beasts and collect Spirit Essences!\u201d Mo Fan said enthusiastically.\u201cMhm,\u201d Tangyue nodded, followed by saying, \u201cHurry and collect them, remember to send me a Wechat location before you die. I will go to the Magical Beast\u2019s stomach to retrieve your skeleton and the growth Magic Tool.\u201dThe corner of Mo Fan\u2019s mouth stretched, he didn\u2019t know how to reply to that.\u201cGive me the broken Stardust Magic Tool that was given to you by the school, I\u2019ll settle this matter for you. This is me helping you privately, so just look it as you owing me one.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue wasn\u2019t joking as she said this.\u201cThank you, Mrs. Tangyue. If I can be of use in the future, don\u2019t hesitate to tell me!\u201d Mo Fan replied.Asking Mrs. Tangyue for help was indeed not bad, the most headache inducing problem had been solved by her.As long as I don\u2019t get expelled by the school, then I\u2019m alright. Also\u2026 the Little Loach Pendant obtaining the energy of the Stardust Magic Tool signifies that I\u2019ll be able to use it permanently!That was amazing!People like Mu Bai and Xu Zhaoting would only be able to use the Stardust Magic Tool for a month, and even that Yu Ang who was going to have a duel with Mo Fan would only be allowed to use his for half a year. Mo Fan himself would be able to use it non-stop for a whole year, his cultivation would surpass them by a whole street!!He couldn\u2019t help but give the Little Loach Pendant a kiss!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the quarter of your school time has ended, we will bring you to the outside of the city for two months of practical experience. When the time comes for you to meet a real Magical Beast, you will forget about the idea you have today,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said.\u201cPractical experience??\u201d Mo Fan had never heard of this thing. Was this possibly the legendary High School Military Drill?\u201cEvery Magician needs to experience this day. We don\u2019t nurture Magicians so they can stay home and live like princesses, nor is it for you to compete against one another. It is for you to stand off against Magical Beasts during crucial times. The practical experience is a significant test of the student\u2019s temperament,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue explained.\u201cI will treat this seriously.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Tangyue said, \u201cThe practical experience isn\u2019t an exam. I only wish for you and other students to calm yourselves when you encounter a problem and ponder how you\u2019re going to survive it,\u201d Tangyue said with an earnestly profound manner.After Mrs. Tangyue said this, she turned around to leave. When Mo Fan was about to ask for more details, he realized her curvy body had slowly merged with the area where the moonlight didn\u2019t shine. A heartbeat later, there were no more traces of Tangyue.Mo Fan was able to see everything very clearly this time.She really merged with the darkness. Her entire being disappeared as though she was never here.Mo Fan hastily jumped down from the dam and poked his head out of the railings of the roof.What made Mo Fan\u2019s shocked was the fact that Mrs. Tangyue had gone from the roof of the eight floor tall school building and was already on the ground, treading with slow and light footsteps toward the teacher\u2019s dormitory. The gloomy moonlight stretched her shadow out, making her look like a proud night fairy.As Mrs. Tangyue entered the shadow of a messy tree, she suddenly disappeared once again from his line of sight, and he was no longer able to find this mysterious female teacher in the dreary night.Just what kind of skill was that?Out of all of the Elements that Mo Fan knew of, only the Wind Element was able to use Wind Trail to move swiftly. That fact alone made Mo Fan think it was amazing, but Mrs. Tangyue used magic that he didn\u2019t know anything about. It practically let her enter the shadows to move swiftly._That is just too cool, I wonder when I can learn this?_Speaking of which, this Mrs. Tangyue didn\u2019t seem normal.According to the rumors, one would have to reach Intermediate-level Magician to awaken a second Element. In other words, Mrs. Tangyue was at least an Intermediate-level Magician.No wonder why Mrs. Tangyue was able to surpass so many other qualified and older Practical Teachers. For most people, an Intermediate-level Magician had already reached the peak Heaven level!_It seems like Mrs. Tangyue is actually a very thick thigh\u2026I will have to hold onto it tightly!_\u2014\u2014\u201cDid you hear? After our quarter of cultivation time has ended, we will begin the Magician\u2019s Practical Experience.\u201d\u201cWhat is the Magician\u2019s Practical Experience?\u201d\u201cBasically, we\u2019re going to the areas outside of the city.\u201d\u201cNo way, ever since I was a child, I\u2019ve heard those areas have Magical Beasts that eat people, I\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cYou have to go. This Practical Experience is related to our admittance to University, it is the equivalent of a very important subject.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just Practical Experience, what is there to be afraid of? We\u2019re Magicians, even if we were to encounter a Magical Beast, we can just use Ice Spread to freeze it into an ice statue.\u201d\u201cHowever, I heard Magical Beasts are really strong. Didn\u2019t the Magical Beast teacher always stress about how we should never face a Magical Beast by ourselves?\u201dJust like what Mrs. Tangyue said, after the end of their quarter of cultivation time, they immediately welcomed a cruel Practical Experience. If it went as planned, then they would meet a genuine Magical Beast.There had always been a Magical Beast class, and who knows how many years the teachers had been talking about them. However, for the students had never met a genuine Magical Beast, even if they were to secretly watch a video of them on the internet, there was no difference to them between that and watching a Godzilla movie.This time, the students would finally get to meet a genuine Magical Beast. As soon as the news hit, it could be said that the entire school began to discuss this matter.The Practical Experience began with the Elite class.All of the students of the Elite class were basically able to control seven stars after the end of the annual examination. Currently, it had been more than half a year. Thus, every single one of them should be able to expertly control their elemental skill.The school would let the students who could grasp their Magical Skills participate in the Practical Experience. If a common person were to encounter a Magical Beast, they wouldn\u2019t even have a bit of ability to retaliate.\u2014\u2014The time passed by quickly. Mo Fan relied on his Little Loach Pendant to cultivate his Lightning and Fire stars to more than five times their original levels.He was able to cast both Lightning Strike and Fire Burst skillfully.He was able to practice Fire Burst openly in school now, and thus the casting speed of his Fire Burst had gotten even faster; roughly three seconds was enough for him to cast it now. As for Lightning Strike, he would need about four seconds.Currently, most of the students in the Elite class would require five to ten seconds to use a Magic Spell. Thus, Mo Fan was far above them in terms of spellcasting.The entire Elite class had a total of 100 people, they would be divided into five groups with roughly twenty students in each.There would be a teacher with them, as well as two other military instructors.Every group had its own bus. Thus, the five school buses began to drive toward the outer areas of the city with groups of young magicians.The place they were going to this time had more or less been decided; they would be going to the Snowy Peak Mountain station.The Snowy Peak Mountain was an important goods stronghold for the hunters of Hunter\u2019s Union and Bo City. The entire stronghold was constructed in the middle of a valley.\u201cDo you remember when I told you that the stations in Bo City\u2019s surroundings are the boundaries of the safe area? The areas outside of the stations may have a Magical Beast appearing; thus, before you have the abilities to face off against a Magical Beast, make sure you never step out of the safe areas or else you\u2019ll become a pile of skeletons!\u201d the Magical Beast Teacher, Zhang Jianguo told them strongly.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Within the area of the station, we, The Hunter\u2019s Union, and the Magic Association, as well as other large Ancient Families, assign someone to patrol daily and set up warnings. There will definitely not be any Magical Beasts entering the residential areas of humans. However, the capabilities of us Magicians are also limited. Thus, the only places we are able to protect are within the boundaries of the stations. We are powerless outside of the stations; after all, even if we have stronger Magicians, we are unable to eradicate the Magical Beasts hiding under all the complicated and difficult terrains,\u201d the third hunter\u2019s group\u2019s captain, Luo Yunbo, stated.Luo Yunbo was a tanned and very handsome man. After the girls in the groups saw Captain Luo Yunbo, their eyes began to sparkle; it was like the girls were worshipping and infatuated with the handsome military instructor.Luo Yunbo was the military instructor who guided the team this time.The assistant military instructor was a woman named Pan Lijun. She was a tanned, capable, and vigorous type. There was a huge difference between her and the female Magicians from the campus.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In just moments of time, mountain forest appeared in everyone\u2019s sight.The Mountain forest was very green, deep, and its vicinity was luxuriant, sturdy, and vigorous. Weeds were growing, the distant mountain peak was uneven and the clouds were thick.\u201cDo you see it? This lonely and mighty mountain is the Snowy Peak Mountain, and also the border of our Bo City.\u201cOur Bo City counts as a medium-sized city. At the front-line Magic Cities, Empires, and large Demonic Cities, their safe borders wouldn\u2019t be called just a station, or even a small stronghold,\u201d said the assistant Military instructor, Pan Lijun, whose hair was only the length of a forefinger.\u201cSpeaking of which, since you guys regularly have contact with Magical Beasts, then that means you must be Intermediate-level Magicians?\u201d Wang Sanpang said.\u201cIntermediate?\u201d Pan Lijun swept her gaze across Wang Sanpang as she ridiculed him, \u201cWhy would Intermediate-level Magicians guide you little brats around?\u201dAs Wang Sanpang heard this, he got upset and whispered, \u201cThen you guys are just Primary-level Magicians, that\u2019s nothing to brag about.\u201dAs Wang Sanpang said what everyone was thinking, the two military instructors began to laugh simultaneously. It was evident that they thought Wang Sanpang\u2019s words were far too childish.\u2026\u2026As the bus entered the mountain, they had been on the road for more than half a day.Mo Fan wasn\u2019t leisurely sitting around for more than half a day. He was maintaining his meditation at the very back of the bus.He and the bus were fated. When he had completed connecting seven stars and Lightning Strike, he was also on the bus.This time, Mo Fan felt like his Fire element had touched upon something.The Little Loach Pendant was like a Stardust Magic Tool, it allowed Mo Fan\u2019s cultivation time to hugely upgrade. It has been a year since the annual examination, and Mo Fan realized that not only had his Stardust become tremendously bright, but the stars within the Fire element Stardust had gone through a huge change.In the past, the star\u2019s radiance would be occasionally bright and occasionally dark. Currently, the star\u2019s radiance could be said to be extremely steady.It was said that when the stars\u2019 brilliance began to transform, its ability to conduct Magic would also improve. A Spell\u2019s effect and might would also follow this change and strengthen!He spent the entire second year of high school increasing this._I wonder what kind of might the next level of Fire Burst will possess, I can\u2019t wait!_\u2026\u2026At last, they finally arrived at the Snowy Peak Mountain Station.Although they said it was a small stronghold, this place wasn\u2019t just some crude village.The stronghold station used the incomparably precipitous cliff as its sides. The cliffs were at least a hundred meters high, you could only see the sky if you were to fully tilt your head backwards.The cliffs on the two sides formed a natural wall. Additionally, the front and the back of the valley road had two colossal stone doors locked down. The entire stronghold station was just like a small fort garrison within the valley.\u201cSo this is the Snowy Peak Mountain stronghold. It is said that other than the high-leveled flying type Magical Beasts, as well as those that have a climbing ability, this Snowy Peak Mountain fort garrison can obstruct the absolute majority of the evil creatures that are doing bad deeds from the safety zone. Moreover, due to the Snowy Peak Mountain station, we haven\u2019t had any frightening reports about people being hurt within the safety zone for many years.\u201d Zhang Jianguo walked out of the bus as he looked at the large protective stone doors. He couldn\u2019t help but feel deeply moved.\u201cTeacher, I heard that this protective stone door is made by our Bo City\u2019s Construction Master, Earth element Magician Zhang Yuheng. No magic beneath the Intermediate-level is capable of moving it?\u201d The young lady Ba Zhoumin asked while being the good student she was.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The stone door seems a bit old, but the truth is that its firmness is no way inferior to steel.\u201d Zhang Jianguo walked in the front, holding in his hands a flag for the third group. He looked like a tour guide who was taking the students on a walk around an ancient city.Not long after, the other four groups buses arrived in succession. The one hundred elite students of Tian Lan Magic High stood together beneath the tall and sturdy stone door.On the two sides of the stone gate were two sentries. Amongst them was a Battlemage who didn\u2019t wear his uniform; he was leisurely playing with the flame in his hands. The small flame was like an obedient pet; moving actively within his hands. Occasionally, it would float around his body, it seemed wonderfully graceful.As Mo Fan noticed this, he was amazed.From the way he was playing with the fire, Mo Fan could tell that the man was far more skilled than he was. He began wondering how much stronger the plain-clothed Battlemage\u2019s Fire Burst skill would be compared to his own.\u201cHey, Boss Zhankong, how come you\u2019re assigned to this post today?\u201d Luo Yunbo raised his head as he smiled toward the Fire Mage who was fiddling with flames.\u201cI have nothing to do. I heard there would be some high school girls coming here today, so I specifically came here to check it out myself.\u201d The man called Zhankong didn\u2019t hide his characteristics as he smiled to himself.On the side, Zhoumin pursed her small brows. It was because she could already feel this Magician called Zhankong was already gazing at her as he checked her out.\u201cSo handsome.\u201d\u201cYeah, you simply can\u2019t compare the little brats from our school with him, he has such a manly aura to him.\u201d\u201cAnd he\u2019s also very honest.\u201dThe few infatuated girls in the class could no longer maintain their calm and immediately began to chatter continuously.\u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t crease your brow toward our Boss Zhankong. He is one of the rare experts here.\u201d A voice that sounded as though she didn\u2019t like guiding the students came from the Vice Captain, Pan Lijun, and in her voice was a slight note of adoration for Zhankong.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of the name Zhankong. Isn\u2019t that the Fire Magician who slaughtered the most amount of Magical Beasts in the Snowy Peak Mountain station?\u201d Zhang Jianguo immediately raised his head as he loudly said, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d\u201cHe has only killed off a few Magical Beasts, what\u2019s so impressive about that,\u201d Wang Sanpang said.\u201cIt is indeed not impressive. When Deng Kai proposed the idea of having you students come here for practicals, I did reject it\u2026\u201d the handsome mustachioed Zhankong said.\u201cThe warning from a year ago has passed, currently, there won\u2019t be any problem. As a Mage, you still need this practical no matter what. You can\u2019t just extend it just because of a warning from a year ago,\u201d Zhang Jianguo said.\u201cI don\u2019t really mind as long as you don\u2019t let the students wander around. I don\u2019t wanna see this fine and delicate beautiful girl being eaten by a One-eyed Magic Wolf,\u201d Zhankong said with a hearty laugh.Zhang Jianguo smiled awkwardly.The other person was a genuine expert. Even if he were to assail a woman with obscenities, he, a teacher, was unable to do anything.The warning from a year ago?Mo Fan had heard of this matter from Little Aunt. However, as Mo Fan had spent most of his time within the ivory tower of the school, the dangerous matters that occured in the outside world were unknown to him.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Versatile MageChapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0GravityTales\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0GravityTalesThe entry and exit was clearly within the hands of the man called Zhankong. As the hundred Elite students exited the bus, they all began entering the Snowy Peak Mountain\u2019s stronghold.The stronghold was very simple, with only a single main road. On the main road were many shops and vendors, it was virtually no different than the market place for a town.The only difference was that they didn\u2019t sell chicken, duck, or fish meat. They sold the necessities required for a Mage\u2019s battles and cultivation.\u201cCome, come, top-rate Magic Boot Equipment. Let me tell you, this is some good stuff. Do you know what the fastest Magical Beast is?\u2026 That\u2019s right, it is made of the skin of a Speed Beast\u2019s hind legs, with the Wind Trail magic pattern. It also has a pure wind stone increasing its energy. If you were to run using this\u2026you\u2019ll definitely cause the One-eyed Magic Wolf to stare helplessly. If you were to buy this, I will give it to you with a discount, seeing how you and this treasure have interlinked fate.\u201d\u201cSecond Baldy, stop bullshitting. How can this thing be called Magic Equipment? Any random Nike would be be better than your pair.\u201d\u201cBullshit! We lost two people killing a Speed Beast, and I was awarded the skin of the hind legs. It\u2019s definitely a genuine pair of Magic Boots Equipment!\u201d The Second Baldy immediately began a dispute with the person who made fun of him.Further up was a vendor, and they had Magic Stones of all colors.\u2018Magic Stones\u2019 were very simple. They were produced when the elements \u2013 Fire, Wind, Lightning or Earth \u2013 were dense, producing an extraordinary stone. Inhabiting these stones was energy similar to the Magic powers within a Magician\u2019s Stardust. Although they couldn\u2019t be directly used by Magicians, they could still be used by embedding them into Magic Tools and Magic Equipment to supply them with constant energy.This knowledge has already been discussed by the teacher during class, and Mo Fan had earnestly listened to it at the time.They had said that that on many occasions, the purified Magic Stones could also be used as a currency.The consumption rate of the Magic Stones was colossal; in fact, it was the equivalent of a power source in the scientific world.Mo Fan originally thought the mobile, computers, and household appliances used freaking electricity. After that lesson, he understood that the power plants here weren\u2019t some water conservancy that supplied electricity, nor some windmill network, but instead used Lightning Magic Stones.There\u2019s nothing he could do about it. The Light element originating from Edison was something Mo Fan had to accept. Apart from this, Watt, the one who invented the steam machines and helped the entire world enter an Industrial Revolution\u2026that\u2019s right, he was a Fire Magician. The theory behind the Steam machine was a Fire Magic Diagram. They used the Fire Magic Stone as the power source.That is why this world didn\u2019t have oil, hydroelectric power, or electrical energy. They relied on these Magic Stones to survive!And where did the Magic Stones come from?Naturally, they came from nature!The cruel thing is, the Magical Beasts also needed the Magic Stones. The Magic Stones were their most important food, and were a vital source of energy to becoming stronger.Thus, when the humans were searching for, digging up, and gathering Magic Stones, their biggest obstacle wasn\u2019t the nature, but the Magical Beasts who also relied on Magic Stones to survive.Magical Beasts were instinctively hostile toward humans.Think about it. All of the Magical Equipment within the city was simply food to a Magical Beasts. Additionally, humans had always been their prey, which is why human Magicians and the Magical Beasts had never ceased their battles against each other.Perhaps this was the biggest difference between the original world and the current Magical World.In the original world, the humans held a governing position. If they wanted to sweep things away, all they needed to do was send a guided missile.However, in the world of Magic, explosive weapons didn\u2019t exist, there were only Magicians.Perhaps heavy explosive weapons would be unable to achieve their goal, and the Magical Beasts would occupy even more territory.The majority of humans could only live in cities. A city needed the protection of Magicians.This was also the reason why a Magician\u2019s status would always be higher than commoners. Not only do they possess a mighty power, but they also had a divine mission!\u2026\u2026\u201cBrother Fan, on the Practicals this time, we must properly show ourselves off. I\u2019ve heard the Practical\u2019s grades are directly related to our admission to University; It occupies 20% of the total admission grade!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said to Mo Fan.Mo Fan nodded.Their homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng, had already mentioned this matter.The Practicals were basically a part of the \u2018High School Exams\u2019. This is because the grades were set by the military, which is to say the military head of this practical exercise.The evaluation of the Head Military Instructor would be either C or A. This would directly decide whether the student Magicians would end up in a top-rate Magic University, or just a common Magic University!The Imperial Institution which Mu Ningxue was in at the moment would require the students to reach an A before they would bother to recruit them.Mo Fan had not resigned himself to staying in a small place like Bo City. Besides, the higher tiered Magic could only be learned in larger cities and Universities.On the practicals this time, he also wanted to attain a grade of A or higher. Only this way would he have the right to enter Universities of the same level as an Imperial Institution.\u201cThese Military instructors have been bribed by the school. Even if you were to waste your time here for two months, they\u2019d at least give you B or C. That\u2019s why, there\u2019s no need to worry,\u201d Wang Sanpang came over by chance as he said with a smile.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it was like the previous sessions as well.\u201d Another student who knew of the internal stories also nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s about right. The school definitely hopes for the Military instructors to give them a higher grade.\u201d\u201cGather in the plaza.\u201d\u201cGathering!\u201dAfter Luo Yunbo loudly shouted, all the students began to quickly gather within the central plaza of the Snowy Peak Mountain stronghold.The number of people could be said to be of no small amount, there were a hundred of them in all. They all wore the uniform of Tian Lan Magic High.After all of the students had properly lined up, they quickly attracted the attention of the Magicians stationed around the stronghold. They slowly gathered to surround the students. Each one of them seemed to be engrossed, their faces showing an exceptional sneer.\u201cCome and check this out, it\u2019s a new group of interns, hahaha. We can once again see the newbies make a fool out of themselves,\u201d a man with a sharp face like a rat said.\u201cExactly. The period of time where the interns are here are the most lively period of time in this stronghold. Guess which one of these interns will be scared to the point where they pee their pants?\u201d a man who looked like the officer of a small Hunter\u2019s squad said as he stuck his head out.\u201cI guess there\u2019ll be at least 30!\u201d\u201cThen the rest of the 70 will be scared until they faint?\u201dThe students formed a formation on the plaza, but they could easily hear the voices of the veterans of the stronghold.Most of them had a look that made them seem as if they took pleasure in seeing other people\u2019s misfortune. They definitely did not try to cover up their disdain toward the students.The hundred Elite students were divided into five groups, and there were twenty people in each of the five groups. In the front stood two military instructors and one Practical class teacher.\u201cHead Military Instructor!\u201d\u201cThe Head Military Instructor has come!\u201dNot long after, a group of Battlemages wearing uniforms neatly walked to the front of the gathered students, and one could feel a certain prestige emitted from their aura.Leading these people was unexpectedly the mustache uncle who was playing with the flames by the sentry, Zhankong.Zhankong still had that superior appearance. As the Head Military Instructor, his unorganized appearance actually caused people to think otherwise.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You should consider yourselves lucky because you are the first group of examinees that have come here since I\u2019ve taken charge,\u201d the Chief Military Instructor, Zhankong said.The students were standing there with their back straight, none of them dared to say a word.In the past, they\u2019d only interacted with teachers. The knowledge the teachers could impart to everyone was abundant, but it was only theories and data. The Battlemages had remnant auras from killing Magical Beasts! This students who had never seen this aspect of the world were not rash, despite the Chief Military Instructor called Zhankong seeming gentle.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are the first Practical students that I will be responsible for. In order for you to smoothly pass the Practicals that directly influences your high school examinations, I will give you all a special treatment!\u201d Zhankong said with a loud voice.Not being able to pass the practical examination, or getting a low score will influence the grades by a lot! It\u2019s possible that their fate would greatly change due to the assessment of the Practicals this time.\u201cI understand that you are all the most outstanding young magicians of our Bo City, and I also believe you possess the required strength to pass the Practical Examination this time\u2026Thus, the Practicals this time will be extremely easy,\u201d Zhankong said harmlessly.At this moment, Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun couldn\u2019t help but crease their foreheads. Whenever he revealed this kind of smile, it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing!\u201cI just received a bounty, and the difficulty is of the lowest level. There\u2019s 100 Magicians in total from the school right\u2026 How about this. If any of the squad, or individual amongst you 100 people are able to complete this bounty, then you will pass the entire Practical assessment, and acquire grade A,\u201d Zhankong said.Before Zhankong could finish his sentence, an uproar occurred within the small stronghold.The ones most excited were naturally the one hundred practical students.They had heard their senior brothers and sisters mention the matters regarding Practicals. All they needed to do is to waste time at the station and not provoke the instructors, and they\u2019ll basically pass. If you performed well, you could get a B, and an A wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.However, they\u2019d never heard of something like clearing a bounty?Bounties, aren\u2019t these the special missions undertaken by the full-grown Mage squads that are looking for the high reward!Within the plaza, even the hunters who had been at the station for a long time couldn\u2019t calm themselves.What kind of situation was this?Letting these students undertake the Bounty missions?That was retarded. Even our full-fledged Mage Hunting Squads, are unable to succeed, and now these immature and inexperienced students are supposed to finish it?\u201cWhat if none of us are able to finish this mission?\u201d Xu Zhaoting, who was standing further to the front, asked.\u201cThen no one will pass.\u201d Zhankong replied indifferently.All the students and teachers were unable to remain calm after hearing these words.\u201cChief Military Instructor, you might as well fail us all!\u201d At this moment, class representative Zhoumin stood up as she was at the end of her patience.\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no difference between that and failing us right now!\u201dZhang Jianguo, Xue Musheng, Tangyue, and Chen Weiliang, the teacher\u2019s expressions were also exceedingly concerned.What was with this situation? Didn\u2019t they already bribe them, so why is this Zhankong not playing according to the rules?A bounty, was this really something the students were able to do?\u201cHow is it inappropriate? Why don\u2019t you go and find your school director, Deng Kai. Either way, it won\u2019t be easy for you to receive high grades from me. Since Tian Lan Magic High is the best public high school in Bo City, then you shouldn\u2019t have brought a group of wastes here for Practicals. Besides, if all you\u2019re planning on doing is wasting your time here, then you might as well go back to school and read Magic books. What\u2019s the freaking use of bribery, it\u2019d be good if that didn\u2019t happen. That way, you wouldn\u2019t come to a station where danger lurks everywhere!\u201d Zhankong\u2019s tone suddenly turned serious. Just now, he had a gentle appearance; but in a flash, he turned into a fiend._Brought a group of wastes for Practicals?_Those words struck the hearts of the students fiercely.\u201cChief Military Instructor, the examination you used is a bit too much. From what I know, any random Bounty would require a squadron that has been polishing their skills in the outside world for at least three to five years to successfully complete\u2026\u201d Teacher Zhang Jianguo said with lack a of confidence.\u201cYou have one hundred people. If you can\u2019t even finish a bounty mission, then the wastes you mediocre teachers have raised would leave me very disappointed. Are they even Elite students?\u201d Chief Military Instructor Zhankong replied with no trace of politeness.As Zhang Jianguo heard this, his face turned green and white.This instructor had something wrong with his head. Let\u2019s not even mention him issuing an impossible mission, he even slandered all of the teachers and students of Tian Lan Magic High!\u201cNaturally, for the squadron or person that successfully completes the bounty, I will personally gift a reward. This reward is a piece of Defensive Magic Equipment,\u201d continued Zhankong as he raised his voice.As soon the words \u2018Defensive Magic Equipment\u2019 were mentioned, the veteran Hunters outside of the plaza suddenly got excited.\u201cShit, awarding some Defensive Magic Equipment?\u201d\u201cBoss Zhankong, don\u2019t do it. Why don\u2019t you give that opportunity to us, we promise we will be able to smoothly accomplish the mission.\u201d\u201cYeah, we are just in need of a piece of Defensive Magic Equipment. That life-saving thing should definitely be given to us.\u201d\u201cAllow us to have a fair competition with these students, Boss Zhankong, we also want the Magic Equipment!\u201dIn a flash, the small Hunter squadrons outside of the plaza were suddenly shouting out all this.Magic Equipment!Magical Equipment was something that connected with your soul. With your thoughts you were able to activate it, and it would quickly transform into its genuine form. It would then become gear that would assist you in battles.They were just like the Boot Magic Equipment the Second Baldy tried to sell. Only after you wore and activated it would the speed of your body substantially increase. If you really were to meet a foe that you couldn\u2019t fight against, then the Boot Magic Equipment would be a life-saving item.Additionally, if their body were to have increased speed during combat, then it could substantially increase the Magician\u2019s combat power.Defensive Magic Equipment. It was a special type of equipment that was able to directly morph into a Shield or Armor. At a crucial time, it could block the attack of a Magical Beast, and thus was also a form of lifeguarding equipment.Although the Magic Equipment\u2019s price wasn\u2019t as high as a Stardust Magic Tool, to people like Hunters who risked their life everyday in the outside world, it was treated like Divine Equipment. What was more valuable than life?\u201cShit, that\u2019s some good stuff. From what I know, a common Defensive Magic Tool would end up being priced at several thousand yuan!\u201cNo wonder these hunters are going crazy. This kind of money-bustling thing unexpectedly become the reward of the Practical for these immature and inexperienced students.\u201d\u201cThe question is, can those students obtain it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. The bounties are usually really difficult, and even the veteran Magicians can occasionally be caught in life-threatening situations.\u201dMo Fan was still a stranger towards Magic Equipment, but if you were to convert the Magic Equipments into currency, then he would understand perfectly!Even the most common Magic Equipment was worth a good thousand yuan! _Shit, this daddy has never seen that much money in his life before!_* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bitterness they suffered was unbelievable.\u201cThis freaking Chief Military instructor, I really want to curse him for sending us to such a sly place.\u201d Wang Sanpang gasped for breath as he sat his butt down, while fanning himself with his cap.\u201cYeah, freaking crap. Speaking of which, how have we not finished the 30 kilometers yet, isn\u2019t this the tenth day?\u201d Zhang Shuhua with the giraffe neck asked.\u201cThe thirty kilometers is the distance if it was a straight line. We have had to climb hills, cross valleys, and take detours around mountains. This kind of road is more than 30 kilometers,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou explained.The squad Mo Fan was in had a total of twenty people. The Practical Mission needed to be completed by students, and thus no teachers were leading the squads, nor were any military instructors following. All they were given was a map to use.The hardship of the journey for the past few days caused everyone to look like primitives, their faces were covered in filth and they were dripping with sweat.\u201cAfter crossing this river valley, we shouldn\u2019t be too far from the Hundred Grass Valley that Chief Military Instructor mentioned,\u201d class representative Zhoumin said as she held the map.\u201cShit, how are we supposed to pass this river valley? Flying? In any case, it is at least 10 meters wide!\u201d Wang Sanpang was the first to call out.At this moment, there was a cliff in front of them!The cliff on the opposite side of the mountain was right in front of them. However, the rapid and surging river below was fearsome. The roaring sounds of the water splashing against the rocks were very clear!\u201cWhat do we do? We can\u2019t just give up halfway there.\u201d\u201cHow about we just go home. There are still other groups, it\u2019s possible that they could finish this\u2026\u201d Zhang Shuhua the giraffe neck said.\u201cYou lack spirit, how can you place your hope on other people?!\u201d Zhoumin immediately reprimanded him.\u201cThen you tell us what to do. None of us are able to cross this cliff,\u201d Zhang Shuhua complained.\u201cOh right, Zhang Yinglu, aren\u2019t you a Wind Magician, why don\u2019t you try jumping over?\u201d In this moment, Xu Zhaoting looked toward a girl with ponytails beside him.The girl called Zhang Yinglu\u2019s face immediately turned deathly pale as she shyly said, \u201cN\u2026no, I won\u2019t jump. What if I fall?\u201d\u201cWe have ropes. The two cliffs have trees, as long as one person is able to directly jump to the other cliff on this valley and tie the ropes on the trees on the opposite side, then all of us will be able to use the ropes to cross over,\u201d Zhoumin said, her eyes shining.\u201cZhang Yinglu, don\u2019t you want to get an A? You are jumping with a rope, even if you aren\u2019t able to jump over, we are still able to pull you up. It\u2019s only bungee jumping,\u201d Xu Zhaoting continued.\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d Zhang Yinglu was clearly a cowardly girl.\u201cShit, when we need you, a Wind Magician, you don\u2019t comply. What kind of Magician are you?\u201d another Water elemental girl said.\u201cLet\u2019s not force someone to do something they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Zhoumin said.As everyone was still confused as to what to do, Mo Fan glanced at Zhang Xiaohou to his side.Zhang Xiaohou wasn\u2019t a very outstanding student within the Elite class. Everyone habitually placed their hopes on Zhang Yinglu who had the highest score in the Wind element. However, Zhang Yinglu was just a girl, how could she possibly do something that might risk her life.\u201cMonkey, do you dare?\u201d Mo Fan opened his mouth to ask.\u201cWhat is there to be afraid of!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou slapped his chest.\u201cGood!\u201dZhang Xiaohou stood up and said to Zhoumin, Xu Zhaoting, and Zhang Shuhua, \u201cTie the rope around me, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dZhang Shuhua and Xu Zhaoting revealed doubtful expressions as they checked out the not-particularly-impressive Zhang Xiaohou.However, someone volunteering was still better than standing there worrying helplessly.Zhoumin\u2019s movements were quite swift, she quickly tied one end of the rope around Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s waist.\u201cMake way, make way, give Zhang Xiahou room for running.\u201dThe other people immediately gave Zhang Xiaohou thumbs up. There were numerous people standing by the cliff and trembling as the wind blew past. Who would have the courage to jump in this situation?!\u201cMonkey, don\u2019t worry. If you aren\u2019t able to jump across, I will pull you up.\u201d Mo Fan tied the other end of the rope onto a tree trunk, and he also used both of his hands to firmly grab the rope!Zhang Xiaohou smiled at Mo Fan\u2019s straightforwardness.As Zhang Xiaohou took a deep breath, he slowly closed his eyes. No one knew whether he was connecting the star paths or emboldening himself.Suddenly, Zhang Xiaohou opened his eyes. His pupils emitted a green radiance.An indescribable gale began to swirl around Zhang Xiaohou!Under the intent control of Zhang Xiaohou, the gale turned into a Wind Trail leading toward the cliff from the hillside of the mountain.This Trail was invisible. However, the dust it scattered around allowed people to clearly see the extraordinary wind passage!\u201cWind Trail, Swift Current!\u201dAs Zhang Xiaohou yelled out, the star trail radiance around his body achieved an extremely bright level!_Swoosh~_A burst of wind sounded, and their clothes began to flutter!Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s body turned into an indistinct shadow as it quickly passed through the wind passage which he had created, swiftly following the current within the Wind Trail. Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s speed grew increasingly faster!The hill didn\u2019t pose any problem for Zhang Xiaohou.\u201cJump! Jump quickly!\u201dXu Zhaoting, Zhoumin and Zhang Shuhua the three of them were closely fixated on Zhang Xiaohou. That Wind elemental girl, Zhang Yinglu, who was too scared to jump opened her eyes even wider!Zhang Xiaohou arrived at the edge of the cliff and jumped with all his force using his right foot. He shattered a rock by the cliff as his body simultaneously began to leap!\u201cOhh!!\u201dIn the mid-air, Zhang Xiaohou welcomed the whistling gale from the top of the valley, the wind was so powerful that his face almost deformed.His body arced between the two cliffs as he approached the other side.At this moment, Mo Fan tightly grasped the rope. If Zhang Xiaohou didn\u2019t make it, the he would have to pull him or else he might crash into the rugged stones beneath the cliff!The remaining nineteen people raised their heads up as they looked at the leaping Zhang Xiahou, all of them were worried.At last, Zhang Xiaohou began to roll.His foot heavily stomped onto the edge of the other cliff, his body continued rolling forwards._Boom!_In the end, he still crashed into a large tree on the other side of the cliff as everyone on the opposite side stared blankly.Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s eyes were crossed as he immediately turned around to look at the students on the other side of the cliff with a simple and honest smile. His appearance at the time looked extremely funny.Although his appearance seemed funny, the students\u2019 impressions of Zhang Xiaohou were much better.Twenty people, and among them, there were only about four Wind Magicians. The only one who dared to jump over was Zhang Xiaohou.In this kind of situation, so what if the other Wind Magicians\u2019 grades were better?\u201cMonkey, good job!\u201d Mo Fan was the first to yell out.Zhoumin, Zhang Shuhua, Wang Sanpang, and others immediately give Zhang Xiaohou a thumbs up.\u201cWe\u2019re coming over!\u201d Xu Zhaoting was the first to climb the ropes.The remaining nineteen people also successfully climbed over to the other side of the valley. This would be a success on the first test of Practicals because they had arrived at their destination, Hundred Grass Valley!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Within his hand was a scoreboard!After he had registered what he needed, he quickly left the forest and headed off to an empty meadow.\u201cAll three of the groups have passed. Amongst them was a Wind elemental student named Zhang Xiaohou who has been exceptionally remarkable,\u201d the straw hat guy said as he walked into a tent to the man inside it.If the students were here, they would have been shocked as they discovered their Practical teachers as well as the military instructors were all there. They were all sitting comfortably, eating snacks, and drinking wine.\u201cOh?\u201d Zhankong creased his eyebrow.From Zhankong\u2019s impression, there was no Wind elemental student among them called Zhang Xiaohou that had a high cultivation.Whatever, that was normal. Cultivation was just the foundation, the most important part of a Magician was actually their head and their courage!\u201cNote this name, we can give him a high grade,\u201d Zhankong said toward assistant military instructor Pan Lijun seated next to him.Pan Lijun nodded her head as she quickly noted Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s name.\u201cHaha, you Battlemages of the stronghold sure know how to play,\u201d Zhang Jianguo laughed.\u201cYeah, first, we directly put the students on the great mountains and give them a sense of feeling they\u2019d have no help whatsoever. And then, we discreetly follow them and find the more outstanding students during the process of them completing the mission and give them grades according to that\u2026 This idea couldn\u2019t be any better!\u201d Chen Weiliang also smiled.\u201cYeah, compared to the idling from the past, this can clearly reflect a student\u2019s quality,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue also nodded in agreement.If the hundred students who were slandered to the point where they\u2019d sounded like trash knew about that their teachers teamed up with the instructors to do this, who knew what kind of faces they would reveal.Teachers and the Military Instructors naturally couldn\u2019t just ignore them. Currently, the things they were studying were indeed not enough for them to survive in the outer regions of the city. However, if they were not given an environment where they could experience the danger, then they would never be able to reach a state of surviving it. Thus, the best method would be treating them cruelly on the surface and then following them in secret. If there were any accidents, they could quickly lend a hand.\u201cChief Zhankong, I was almost tricked by you. I thought you really were going to be heartless and not allow a single student to pass the Practicals,\u201d Vice Military Instructor Pan Lijun said.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong there. Those who are useless during the Practicals will not pass,\u201d Zhankong stated very directly.\u201cThis\u2026this is a bounty, there\u2019s no way anyone is capable of completing it.\u201d\u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s already exceedingly good for them to be able to pass through the Monster Vine region,\u201d Chen Weiliang said.\u201cNaturally, if it was a real bounty, they would not be able to complete it. Let\u2019s not even talk about them, even the Military Instructors here wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to complete it,\u201d Zhankong said with a smile.\u201cEven Military Instructors wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to complete it? What does that mean?\u201d Zhang Jianguo asked in puzzlement.\u201cIt\u2019s like this. Since we are making the den of the One-eyed Magic Wolf the destination for the students, we would have to ensure that there are no remnants of a One-eyed Magic Wolf. Thus, we placed a Summoner to guard the den. The Summoner Mage is actually the last test for the students. The den doesn\u2019t actually have a Magical Beast, but there is a summoned beast\u2026\u201d Luo Yunbo said with a smile.As the group of teachers listened to this, their eyes began to sparkle.Chen Weiliang, the head of the teachers immediately began to clap his hands.\u201cSmart, very smart! This move is incredibly smart!\u201dXue Musheng also violently nodded his head, \u201cYeah, we can\u2019t let the students face a genuine Magical Beast yet, there would be numerous casualties. The practicals are for the students to temper their reactions towards a Magical Beast. If they don\u2019t face a Magical Beast, then the impact of the Practical won\u2019t be effective. Placing a Summoner Mage there and have him summon a Beast to play the role of a Magical Beast is extremely fitting. This way, they are able to reach the maximum efficiency of students facing a genuine Magical Beast, as well as guaranteeing their safety!\u201cI\u2019m really thankful to you, Boss Zhankong, for coming up with such a wonderful Practical test. I believe the students will definitely reap a harvest this time!\u201d Xue Musheng said with a slight smile.\u201cIt\u2019s my obligation.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, there\u2019s only one summoned Beast. What if the students are more vicious than what we have imagined and defeat the summoned beasts with their combined force?\u201d Mrs. Tangyue couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201c(sigh)., Mrs. Tangyue, you are thinking too much\u2026In our twenty years of teaching at Tian Lan Magic High, there has never been a single student who has been able to properly cast their magic on their first meeting with a Magical Beast. If we were to take a step back, even if they are able to cast their Magic spells, these students are only able to cast their Primary skill, which cannot wound the muscles of a summoned Beast,\u201d Zhang Jianguo said with confidence.\u201cYeah. The strongest amongst elements are Fire and Lightning. Only Xu Zhaoting, the Lightning Mage, is able to give the summoned Beast a slight challenge. Whereas Fire Burst can at most give flesh wounds,\u201d Chen Weiliang said with a laugh.The teachers and the instructors began to laugh one by one.Indeed, they were very clear on the strengths of each student. The mission on the Practicals this time was impossible to complete; all they wanted was for the students to grow during the process of the mission. At least, they would be able to keep notes of all their experiences during the mission!Mrs. Tangyue didn\u2019t laugh at all. She looked toward the valley in the distance that was enveloped in fog.\u201cMo Fan have been in possession of the Stardust Magic Tool for a whole year. I wonder if his Fire Burst has reached a higher level. If that would be the case, then he could be the only student that is capable of wounding the summoned beast, thus, receiving the S grade shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Tangyue thought to herself.Soon after, Tangyue also shook her head.Being able to fully cast a spell when you were up against a ferocious Magical Beast would already be quite good.All Tangyue wished for is for the hundred Elite students to not be wiped out during the summoned Beast stage. This was because, as long as they were able to cast a spell, then Zhankong would be giving them an A on the Practical class.An A was already the highest grade a student was able to receive from an instructor on the Practicals for many years!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you wanted to pass through the ravine, you had to go along those narrow, curved paths.\u201cWhy does this path have so much rattan, they are all dropping down from the top of the mountain, it looks disgusting,\u201d the more delicate girls immediately began to whisper.Tree sticks and grass vines were intertwined on the ground of this narrow path. Some of them looked like a python from a distance, others were tangled on the ground, it looked as though they had walked into a den of black pythons. It was dreadful, it made sense why some of the more cowardly girls were feeling absolutely horrified.\u201cIt\u2019s just some broken vines, what\u2019s there to be afraid of? Come, follow me!\u201d The time for Wang Sanpang to show off his heroic side had come as he walked confidently by himself to the front.Wang Sanpang\u2019s bloated body broke through the wrist-sized vines before him as he strode forward.His physique was indeed very suitable to opening up this kind of path. If he could cross over, then the remaining students could also cross over.\u201cAh! What the heck, what\u2019s going on? Oh crap, help me! HELP ME!\u201d Suddenly, Wang Sanpang let loose a noise that resembled a dog being beaten up from the inside.The students subconsciously took several steps back as they looked around. At same time, they also felt goosebumps creeping up.It seemed like those vines could move!These twisting vines quickly tied Wang Sanpang up as he entered the path. Wang Sanpang\u2019s obese physique was then turned upside down.The vines had thistles and thorns on their bodies, so when it tightened, Wang Sanpang\u2019s fat skin was completely ripped, immediately leaving him bloodied. Seeing this, Zhang Yinglu and the other little girls began to shriek uncontrollably.\u201cWhat are you shrieking for, what can you do other than shrieking?!\u201d the shaky Xu Zhaoting immediately howled at them.Just as he finished what he was saying, Xu Zhaoting returned to where he stood before. The first star emerged as an illusory image in front of Xu Zhaoting\u2019s forehead. The magnificent purple hue fascinated the watchers.The stars emerged one by one and linked with each other under Xu Zhaoting\u2019s adept control.In a split second, a star path was linked.\u201cLightning Strike, Python Scar!\u201dXu Zhaoting\u2019s Lightning Skill executed smoothly; A scorching electric arc suddenly emerged in his surroundings.The electric arcs flew toward the narrow paths under the command of Xu Zhaoting, lashing onto the Demonic Vines that were dragging Wang Sanpang\u2019s plump body away._Bzzzt~_The Lightning Strike caused several scorched stripes to appear on the Demonic Vines. Although the Plant element Demonic Beasts did not fear the lightning attack, it still caused them to slightly withdraw while they continued to drag Wang Sanpang away without fear.\u201cSave me, save\u2026\u201d Wang Sanpang\u2019s shout carried a sobbing tone. However, following this, his mouth was covered by a strip of vine, muffling his cries.Chaos immediately ensued amongst the students.Xu Zhaoting\u2019s Lightning Strike had no effect whatsoever; how would they stop that Demonic Vine now?\u201cAh!!!\u201dYet another screech arose. It turns out the Demonic Vines weren\u2019t satisfied with just Wang Sanpang, as they had already targeted a slender and delicate girl. That girl called Zheng Yunxia\u2019s ankles were caught by the vines.Zheng Yunxia was a Water Elemental Magician. The problem was that she is too scared to even link her stars, and definitely not able to cast a spell.\u201cDon\u2019t panic, let me handle them!\u201d class representative Zhoumin yelled out.A Fire elemental star path was quickly forming next to Zhoumin\u2019s body. This added a somewhat blazing impetuous temperament to the originally brave and threatening Zhoumin.\u201cFire Burst!\u201dA ball of Flames emerged from Zhoumin\u2019s palm before she threw it. The ball of flames was thrown amidst the Demonic Vines, and a burning sound immediately arose.The scorching flames immediately burned out the middle of the Demonic Vines.The flames rose, and the speed they spread at was fairly quick. They instantly swallowed a large number of the Demonic Vines.The Demonic Vines were extremely afraid of flames. After Zhuomin cast Fire Burst, the Demonic Vines quickly withdrew as if they had seen a ghost.The Demonic Vines also quickly loosened Wang Sanpang, and he fell heavily onto the ground. Luckily, he fell on his round, fat stomach, or else his face would definitely have been in a bad state.\u201cThat was amazing, Class Rep!\u201d\u201cFire element is comparatively good, those Demonic Vines immediately ran away pissing themselves.\u201d\u201cYeah, Class Rep is formidable!\u201dAs the group of students saw most of the Demonic Vines retreating, each one of them began to throw in compliments.Xu Zhaoting, the proud Lightning element user, was standing there with an ugly face.Plant creatures had an innate resistance against the Lightning element, it was something he couldn\u2019t do anything about.Mo Fan was also standing to the side watching; he didn\u2019t use any Fire spells at all.Either way, Class Rep Zhoumin was able to handle those Demonic Vines, there was no need for him to pull any moves.Furthermore\u2026Zhoumin\u2019s Fire Burst was still at the first level, whereas his own Fire Burst had changed since the day they left for the Practicals!_A small Demonic Vine, there\u2019s no need for this Daddy to do anything. I was also able to save some mana!_Zhoumin greatly spread her powers, causing all the Demonic Vines who wanted to attack the girls to retreat. At this kind of time, the power of the Fire element was being fully utilized. Fire Burst\u2019s effectiveness was way more tyrannical than the spells from other elements.\u2014\u2014\u201cZhoumin, Fire element girl. Hmm, this lady is definitely to my liking,\u201d said Head Military Instructor Zhankong said as he stroked his moustache back in his tent.\u201cCurrently, the first group should be the fastest. Amongst the first group, there are many exceptionally talented students,\u201d Zhang Jianguo ventured.\u201cThe first group\u2019s Fire Magician is a loser, he was unable to cast any spells when he was up against the Demonic Vines. In the end, it was that student called Mu Bai who froze the Demonic Vines. They are the fastest ones to reach the Hundred Grass Valley. Soon enough, they will encounter the summoned Wolf Beast! The real test for them is finally here!\u201d\u201cThe summoned Wolf Beast won\u2019t injure the students, right?\u201d\u201cBeing injured is inevitable. Breaking a few bones is also very common. However, our Summoner Mage and his summoned Wolf Beast will behave appropriately,\u201d Pan Lijun said.\u201cIn that case, how about we give him a call to remind him. If the students are injured too heavily, it could affects their attempt at University.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no signal in the valley. There\u2019s no need to worry, Baiyang knows the severity of this,\u201d Luo Yunbo said.\u201cBaiyang? Isn\u2019t that the dead Light element Magician?\u201d Tangyue was startled.Zhankong laughed, \u201cThat was made up. He is the Summoner of our Snowy Peak Mountain station that is left within the den of One-eyed Wolf. However, the Blue Bracelet does exist, it\u2019s within that den.\u201dTangyue remained silent. This Head Military Instructor had schemes going everywhere! She didn\u2019t know whether those students would be able to safely pass through.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To the south was a lake that looked like a person\u2019s hand. Towards the north was a bulging mountain pass.The former den of a One-eyed Wolf was right outside of the mountain pass. In fact, you could see it if you were standing in the middle of Hundred Grass Valley.The person who led the first group was naturally the green tea\u2026er, naturally the Vice Class Rep, Mu Bai!Mu Bai was able to successfully subdue every single person in the group on the Practicals this time. The girls were increasingly in adoration of him.Being able to reach the Hundred Grass Valley so quickly this time was definitely thanks to him.\u201cThe cavern is right there. I thought this bounty was going to be difficult, but it seems like we easily found our destination!\u201d Zhao Kunsan said as he laughed.This guy Zhao Kunsan sure knew how to endure. In the very last quarter of the year, heHad charged into the Elite class and was successfully colluding together with Mu Bai once again.\u201cBe careful, the bounty can\u2019t be this easy.\u201d Mu Bai was born into a large and storied family; he was experienced and knowledgeable. He understood that these bounties weren\u2019t something you could easily complete.A squad of twenty people were being lead by Mu Bai. They followed the precipitous hill as they climbed up to the den by the mountain pass.On the outside of the pass was a small spring, its pond looked about half-full.The den was already in sight, its entrance extremely large. It was about the same size as the subway passage beneath the city.The inside of the den was in deep darkness. This kind of darkness could easily trigger a phobia of darkness or the unknown in people. Additionally, a wind filled with ill omens was blowing from the inside of the den, raising goosebumps.\u201cHow about we wait for some more people before we go in?\u201d He Yu asked shyly.\u201cI agree, it looks scary,\u201d Zhao Kunsan spoke up, without even the courage of a dog.Only the heavens knew what kind of thing was inside that den, so walking in just like that\u2026If there really was a Magical Beast inside, then they would lose their lives.As the crowd of students were discussing this,yet another group of students was walking toward that place through the mountains.\u201cIt looks like the third group, that\u2019s good!\u201d He Yu said happily.The first and the third group were the groups with the highest combat power, due to Mu Bai and Xu Zhaoting.Seeing the third group was so much slower than himself, Mu Bai couldn\u2019t help but smile coldly. Although Xu Zhaoting and Mo Fan had both received an S on the annual examination, what was so great about that? The one who had received nurturing from an ancient family would have a larger benefit during the Practical!\u2014Soon enough, the third and first squads were reunited. The other three squads probably weren\u2019t able to pass the Demonic Vine stage. Maybe they were even eliminated during the valley stage.It made sense, not every Wind Magician would be daring enough to jump over the valley.\u201cLet\u2019s go in together. Light elementals, you finally have some use. Light up your bulbs!\u201d Zhao Kunsan felt braver as he saw more people, it was just that his dirty mouth hadn\u2019t changed.Every one of the Light Element students began to complain instantly.There was nothing they could do, however. Their primary spell\u2019s nickname was indeed \u201cMoving Light Bulb\u201d.The Light Element students used their spells and illuminated the craggy and strange cavern. However, the deeper parts were still pitch black, making people\u2019s hearts speed up.\u201cWind elementals, search for paths in the front. You have the Wind Trail spells; if you encounter any situation, you can quickly leave.\u201d As expected, coming from an ancestral clan, Mu Bai knew how to reasonably divide a squad.The Wind elemental students also didn\u2019t say anything more. Zhao Kunsan, Zhang Yinglu, and Yang Xintian also began to walk in the front of the crowd.\u201cBrother Fan, I\u2019m going to the front to find paths\u2026 What are you looking at?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou was a Wind elemental, so naturally he was tasked with the mission to find paths.Inside a cavern with such a large group of people, having no one in the lead was definitely out of the question. If they were to encounter a situation, they would only cause confusion among themselves. Mu Bai\u2019s decision was indeed correct.Mo Fan was still standing by the entrance of the cavern with his eyes fixated on the pond by the front of the entrance.It has been raining for the past few days, so the pond containing water was quite normal.However, Mo Fan discovered a really strange thing.\u201cThere\u2019s traces of water by the side of the pond; this means that the water in the pond was at that level. Traces of water can still be seen, and the decline of the water level should not have fallen this far in the period of half a day\u2026 If it evaporated, then the speed of evaporation would not be this fast\u2026\u201d Mo Fan said to himself.\u201cCould it be that the people from the first squad drew out some of the water?\u201d Zhang Xiao said.\u201cWe all retrieved water from the lake, there\u2019s no reason for us to come all the way to the mountain to get it one more time,\u201d Mo Fan continued.\u201cThen you mean\u2026\u201d Zhang Xiaohou rarely saw Mo Fan being this serious.\u201cThe Head Instructor said, this place used to have a group of One Eyed Wolves dwelling here. This pond by the entrance should be the place where they drank water. The water level has decreased in the past few hours, and the traces of water are still here,\u201d Mo Fan said thoughtfully.Zhang Xiaohou wasn\u2019t stupid, how could he not guess the meaning behind what Mo Fan said? He was so scared that his face turned pale.\u201cBrother Fan, please don\u2019t scare me. You\u2019re saying that there\u2019s still something dwelling inside this cavern, and it came out here not too long ago to drink, right?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou asked, almost stuttering.\u201cWith the water level going down so much, it would mean that this creature\u2019s physique is particularly large. Or, it means there\u2019s more than one,\u201d Mo Fan added.Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s teeth began to chatter.\u201cGo, it could be that I\u2019m just being too paranoid.\u201d Mo Fan clapped his hands as he caught up to the group of people who had just entered the cavern.Zhang Xiaohou hurriedly ran to the front of the group and told Mu Bai, Xu Zhaoting, and Zhoumin about Mo Fan\u2019s discovery.However, before Zhang Xiaohou could finish, a sudden fishy smell blew out from the inside of the cavern, violently swatting the forty students\u2019 faces with its stench\u2026It resembled a large wave coming over to hit them. Their hair and clothes were a mess, and they could feel moisture gathering on their faces!\u201cAwoooh!\u201d\u201cAwooooooooh!!!\u201dTwo frightening and vicious howls came from the depths of the cavern.In that moment, everyone seemed to understand what the great breath that carried a sticky steam was!_Heavens! That was the saliva from the roar of a Magical Beast!_The forty students were all startled, their bodies stiffening up in shock.In the next second, their faces changed into the dread they had kept within the deepest part of their hearts.Magical Beast!It\u2019s a Magical Beast!!!At school, they had to frequently study Magical Beasts. In their heads, they had thought numerous times about their future battles against Magical Beasts. However, once they felt the two insatiable eyes fix on them from the deepest parts of the cavern, their minds went blank.The Light Magician\u2019s light was still hovering in the air, illuminating the cave before them.A hairy blue foot suddenly came out of the dark. Its claws were as sharp as a knife as they sank into the stony ground\u2026Following this, the owner slowly stretched its head over; revealing itself with help of the illumination from the hovering lights!Rows of fierce, saw-like teeth appeared, and green saliva was dripping down from two sword-like fangs, revealing that this thing was starving at the moment.The fierce and terrifying wolf\u2019s head had a neck longer then a camel\u2019s, brimming with even more strength than a normal wolf, as well as a body with rock-solid muscles. It had dark blue fur that was as sharp as needles covering its entire body\u2026This Magical Beast was standing in front of the forty students, its eyes looking at them like they were delicacies voluntarily delivered to it.\u201cR\u2026r\u2026run!!\u201d someone\u2019s voice shivered as he screamed._________________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As they were crushed together and colliding with each other in their hurry to escape, they all staggered as they fled from the mountain cavern.\u201cQuick! Run! Why are you still standing there!?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou looked at He Yu off to the side, who had been literally scared stiff. Without saying anything further, he grabbed the girl\u2019s arm.\u201cWind\u2026wind\u2026wind trail\u2026shit!\u201dZhang Xiaohou attempted to finish casting his spell. However, because his heart was beating so wildly, he was unable to complete his casting.With his prior practice, he was already able to proficiently complete the Star Paths. Zhang Xiaohou thought that magic was something he could handle conveniently. However, when he was twenty meters away from a dreadful Magical Beast, he realized that everything he had learned was complete nonsense!The formerly obedient Stars were like scared wild deer as they spun into chaos within his Stardust. None of the students were able to cast their spells at this time, and each of them obeyed their basic survival instincts and ran toward the exit of the cavern.\u201cBrother Fan, Brother Fan, quick\u2026 run!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou pulled the stiff He Yu and ran toward the exit to the cavern.At this moment, Mo Fan was no different from the rest of the group of students who were running away. The ones who were screaming, crying, and even the ones who had peed their pants, were all mixed up. Under these circumstances, he was the same in the sense that he was unable to completely focus his thoughts on casting magic\u2026_Not good, I have to run as well._Mo Fan was able to complete the linking of the sixth star. But when he was about to link the seventh one, his focus was dispersed by the roar of the Magical Beast. How could he use magic in this situation?As he had no other choice, he grabbed Zhou Min standing next to him.\u201cLet me go, let me stall this One-eyed Magic Wolf! You others need to quickly calm down!\u201d Zhou Min really was a tough girl who didn\u2019t care for her life.\u201cIs there something wrong with your head?\u201d Mo Fan directly grabbed Zhou Min and carried her away.Although Zhou Min looked like she was harsh, she was actually just a frail little girl. After Mo Fan had cultivated the Lightning Element, his physical strength had improved by a little, and thus, carrying Zhou Min while running wasn\u2019t too difficult.It\u2019s not that Mo Fan didn\u2019t give Zhou Min an opportunity to use her magic; it was because under these circumstances even he could only link six stars. With Zhou Min\u2019s cultivation being lower than his by more than a grade, how could she possibly complete her Star Path?At this kind of time, it was better to not have that Class President spirit; if you could run, then run.Mo Fan carried Zhou Min as he madly rushed out. The sound of weeping as well as the panicked shrieks were piercing his ears._Crap! No wonder why those veterans at the station were ridiculing us. Their first reaction was to escape\u2026 However, if we were to ry to escape, then that\u2019d be equivalent of killing us one by one. We used rope to climb up from the mountain pass, thus, we can at most run to the mountain pass. There\u2019s only one rope, thus, the people who can climb down can be counted on one hand._Mo Fan\u2019s thoughts were still a bit messed up; he was doing his best to calm himself down so he could ponder his actions, however. The dread of the Magical Beast far exceeded their imaginations.This kind of feeling was just like watching a horror film. If you just looked at the screen, then the horror film wasn\u2019t exactly that bad.However, if you were to turn on the sound, then the horror of the film would immediately increase by more than a level.In this moment, this kind of situation was not just simply watching a horror film, it was more like the monstrosity just came out of the TV screen. It was right in front of you, so close that you could even clearly see the blood veins in its eyes.In this kind of situation, there was no one who could actually keep themselves calm!Mo Fan was running rather fast. After carrying her out of the mountain pass, Zhou Min was actually already scared to the point where she could no longer stand.Too scary, this was far too scary for them. This was tens or even hundreds of times scarier than their nightmares!\u201cHeavens, the rope!\u201d\u201cNo, no! I don\u2019t wanna die here!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Mu Bai and Xu Zhaoting were still able to reason. However, looking at their sorry figures, it was plain that they weren\u2019t able to use any magic at all.There were about ten people who had fainted from fear, and about twenty or so people who had attempted to climb down using the rope.However, the rope had disappeared!Right now, unless they were to jump down directly\u2026\u201cWhat do we do, are we all going to die here?\u201d Zhao Kunsan was so scared that his entire body was trembling.The thing was, other than the Spirit Wolf\u2019s stinking breath, this place already had a dense, foul smell pervading it. Students with their pants wet could be found everywhere.\u201cThe One-eyed Magic Wolf has chased us out! I\u2019d rather fall to my death than be eaten alive!\u201d a male Water elemental student cried out.\u201cShit, there are so many who completely fainted in that cavern. Why is that guy not eating them, but instead chasing us out here?\u201d Zhao Kunsan said.Although Zhou Min and Xu Zhaoting were afraid, after they heard Zhao Kunsan\u2019s crazy words, they both glared at him.\u201cRunning is useless. We need to unite and deal with it together.\u201d\u201cHow do we deal with that? I can\u2019t even remember what kind of Element I have!!\u201d\u2014\u2014Three hundred meters away from the mountain pass was a stone platform by a mountain wall.On the stone platform was the Chief Instructor, Zhankong, Luo Yunbo, Pan Lijun, as well as the summoner, Bai Yang. They were all observing the students trapped in the mountain pass from afar.The summoner called Bai Yang couldn\u2019t stop laughing and had his hand covering his mouth. This was because they could see a student who had just peed his pants and gone completely limp.As the Chief Instructor saw this group of students who hadn\u2019t even used any Magic at all, he shook his head.Disappointing\u2026He had thought that these students of Tian Lan Magic High had some ability. Who would\u2019ve known that not a single one of them was able to use their Magic.He had already said that these students were a group of useless Magicians, and it seemed like that was indeed the truth. The school expended so many resources to cultivate them, and yet, when they truly faced a Magical Beast, they ended up being like this.The three teachers, Zhang Jianguo, Xue Musheng, and Chen Weiliang, all looked extremely awkward at this time.They were very clear on the students\u2019 potential; the school usually just pursued a student\u2019s cultivation score. That way, at least their reports would look good; however, their Practicals would just pass by.The Practical combat was something they had to learn for themselves through real experience, how could the school teach something like that?\u201cEh? Someone is using magic.\u201d Luo Yunbo\u2019s eyes were good, he discovered that there was a white radiance flickering near the mountain pass.\u201cIt\u2019s Ice Element\u2026 That seems to be Mu Bai!\u201d Xue Musheng immediately began to smile.Chen Weiliang and Zhang Jianguo also hastily looked over. It seemed like the first one to use magic was indeed Mu Bai.A white Ice energy began to swirl around Mu Bai\u2019s area. Those Ice spirits rushed forth like soldiers, quickly covering the four limbs of the Spirit Wolf that had already exited the cavern!\u201cHmm, note that,\u201d Chief Instructor Zhankong said.\u201cThis is the disciple of the Mu ancient family; he has received the family\u2019s training and has a trace of the temperament of the ancient family\u2019s disciples. His mental essence and his ability to adapt is much stronger than the other students,\u201d Xue Musheng quickly said.As expected of a disciple from an ancient family. While the other students were having a mental breakdown, Mu Bai had already calmed his heart and used Magic.Being able to use the Ice Element spell Ice Spread under this kind of dreadful situation, Mu Bai was already able to receive the outstanding grade of A.Currently, they just needed to see if the other students were able to calm themselves.________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Ice power he was in control of had turned into a slow ice frost as it covered the four limbs of the Spirit Wolf.As Mu Bai was about to reveal a trace of relief on his face, he suddenly discovered that the Spirit Wolf\u2019s pace was only slowed by a little; its approach toward the students was unaffected.\u201cIt\u2019s useless?\u201d Mu Bai was dumbfounded.His Ice Spread could freeze three or four people in place even on bad days. As Mu Bai saw it, he could give his other classmates a chance to regain their composure. Who would\u2019ve thought that the strength of the Spirit Wolf\u2019s four limbs would be this strong? His Ice Spread was unable to make it stop._Creak!_The Spirit Wolf stepped onto the ice with one foot and continued to advance.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s objective now was Mu Bai. Its large foreleg was raised high in front of Mu Bai before it viciously slammed down!_Boom~_A vicious shockwave caused the dust and stones to fly away, along with Mu Bai, who was hurled more than five meters back.Mu Bai had no ability to defend himself at all. Under the shockwave\u2019s impact, he was unconscious before he hit the ground, no longer able to get up.\u201cMu Bai!\u201d Zhao Kunsan hurriedly ran over and discovered Mu Bai\u2019s clothes were filled with holes. His skin had been punctured by the sand and stones!He Yu, who had finally regained her senses, saw this scene and was frightened that she started crying like a little infant, unable to move.As she cried like this, it looked as though it offended the Spirit Wolf. The Spirit Wolf strode with disdainful contempt toward He Yu.For the Spirit Wolf, there was no such saying as being nicer to a girl. Mu Bai was sent flying with his body stained with blood, so who knew what would happen to someone as fragile as He Yu.\u201cShit, hurry up and run!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou shouted urgently. As he clenched his teeth, he once again ran toward He Yu in hope of dragging her out of the dreadful sight of the Spirit Wolf.\u201cMonkey, are you tired of living?!\u201d Not far from this, Mo Fan saw this scene and was no longer able to retain his calm.From Mo Fan\u2019s point of view, Mu Bai\u2019s action just now was really stupid. His power by itself was completely unable to move the Magical Beast whose strength was more than just a level higher than the student Magicians. Thankfully, this Magical Beast didn\u2019t fully enjoy massacre, or else its foreleg would\u2019ve directly slammed onto Mu Bai\u2019s body, sending his flesh and blood flying with his life, guaranteed.\u201cFire\u2026Fire Burst!\u201d Under the stress, Zhou Min had basically bitten through her lip before she could finally cast her Fire Element spell!The fireball was flying toward the Spirit Wolf\u2019s body. However, perhaps because it was cast in a hurry, the Fire Burst hit next to the Spirit Wolf\u2019s foot. A large crimson flame began to light up by the side of the Spirit Wolf, turning the nominally blue Spirit Wolf reddish.The Spirit Wolf simply ignored the flame as it continued to walk toward Zhang Xiaohou and He Yu.\u201cYou brute, have a taste of my Lightning Strike!\u201d Xu Zhaoting yelled out as an uncountable number of lightning arcs appeared around his body. These electrical arcs whipped toward the Spirit Wolf at his command.Every purple lightning arc was able to cause the body of the Spirit Wolf to convulse. The Spirit Wolf was no longer able to advance, and it even gave out a deep, pained roar.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s pair of oily eyes immediately fixed on Xu Zhaoting._Awoooooh!_The Spirit Wolf opened its bloody mouth as it howled a roar at Xu Zhaoting.In a split second, a wild wind erupted. The mountain pass originally had a lot of sand and stones, and they were all caught up by the power of the roar. It looked like a Dust Dragon as it flew toward Xu Zhaoting.\u201cSanpang!\u201d Xu Zhaoting hurriedly yelled out as he saw this scene.Wang Sanpang wailed, \u201cEarth Wave, Divert!\u201dWang Sanpang\u2019s plump body unexpectedly bent over and stuck his two hands onto the ground.The ground was filled with grains of sands. In between the time the time of his shout and his hands reaching the ground, the ground about him had suddenly turned into a controled earth wave, like a stone thrown into a clear pond, making it ripple.This ripple appeared on the sand and stone-filled ground. It became a wave of earth that quickly appeared in front of Xu Zhaoting.Originally, Xu Zhaoting was unable to avoid the flying sand and rocks. However, as this earth ripple appeared, it carried Xu Zhaoting smoothly over five meters away, smoothly dodging the flying sand and rocks that would have easily injured him!Xu Zhaoting\u2019s eyes were closed. After he opened his eyes, he found himself moved somewhere else. He smiled as he gave his close friend Wang Sanpang a thumbs-up.Wang Sanpang was also chuckling. He also didn\u2019t think that his use of Earth Ripple would actually produce this kind of benefit.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, everyone! With us being so many, we are definitely able to defeat the One-eyed Magic Wolf if we use magic!\u201d After Xu Zhaoting had demonstrated his astonishing power, he had quickly become a leader as he gestured to everyone.\u201cEveryone! Quickly, connect your Star Paths, the Lightning Strike has an effect that paralyzes the muscles. This One-eyed Magic Wolf is definitely having problems moving, let\u2019s use this time and counterattack!\u201d Wang Sanpang yelled out loudly._(Ed. Note: Yes, they are still so panicked they haven\u2019t realized it\u2019s not a One-eyed Wolf\u2026)_Just like Wang Sanpang said, after the Spirit Wolf had received the lash from the Lightning Strike, it remained in its place with its muscles constantly twitching.This was undoubtedly a life-saving news for everyone, while at same time, a few Magicians who had calmed down also began attempting to connect their Star Paths.\u201cBrilliant Light, Purify!\u201d\u201cIce Spread, Freeze!\u201d\u201cWater Field, Decay!\u201cEarth Ripple, Divert!\u201d\u201cFire Burst, Scorch!\u201dSeven or eight students of different Elements finished casting their spells at the same time. The spells caused different effects as they were sent flying toward the Spirit Wolf.The paralyzed Spirit Wolf received the attacks being sent from all directions and began to howl out in pain.\u201cFire Elements, hurry up! We have temporarily suppressed this One-eyed Magic Wolf, use fire to scorch it to death!\u201d Xu Zhaoting had naturally turned into the leader. On one hand, he was preparing his next Lightning Strike while on the other, he was yelling out loudly.The Fire Element was the damage-dealer. The Light Element\u2019s brilliance was temporarily blinding the Spirit Wolf. Numerous Ice Mages\u2019 Ice Spreads had completely frozen the Spirit Wolf\u2019s lower limbs. At this time, they could only rely on the Fire Element to give the Spirit Wolf a powerful burn.Zhou Min\u2019s little mouth had started to bleed from her biting. She finally cast a proper Fire Burst, the flames igniting on the back of the Spirit Wolf. They could clearly hear that the Spirit Wolf began to howl out even louder from the pain._Awoooh~ Awoooooooh!!_When everybody thought that their all-out attack was effective, the Spirit Wolf roared out twice in succession.Two waves of sands and rocks simultaneously shot out. One flew toward Xu Zhaoting and Wang Sanpang as they engulfed everything. The other flew toward the other five who were able to cast.The two waves of sands and rocks did devastating damage to the students, each of them had flesh torn away from them.The students who had just found an opportunity to survive were suddenly utterly defeated!______________________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were buried beneath the sand and stones, completely unable to get up again.The Spirit Wolf had suffered some damage, but the injuries were not enough for it to lose any of its combat prowess.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s strength had far surpassed their imaginations. Even if more of them calmed themselves, even if they had ten or more people, they would still be unable to deal with it.\u201cIf all forty of us were to join together and cast their spells, then it\u2019s possible that we could win. Bastard, scoundrels, this father will actually die in a place like this!\u201d Wang Sanpang cursed.\u201cMo Fan, your\u2026your Fire Element is\u2026is stronger than mine, quick, make your move!\u201d Zhou Min yelled out from the side.The only things that could truly damage the Spirit Wolf were Fire Burst and Lightning Strike. However, there were too few Fire students.\u201cIt\u2019s no use! This isn\u2019t even an One-eyed Magic Wolf!\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s eyes were fixated on this special Magical Beast.An One-eyed Magic Wolf would only have one eye, this Magical Beast had a pair of verdant eyes.Practically every single person had been scared witless by this Magical Beast, so who would even pay attention to this dreadful creature\u2019s characteristics?\u201cSave\u2026save\u2026save\u2026\u201d He Yu was crouching there with her face gone extremely pale.It was very clear that the Spirit Wolf greatly despised those who kept weeping. After it had blown away those students who were able to use Magic, its objective once more became He Yu!\u201cHurry up and run!!\u201d Mo Fan felt a twitch of disdain. This girl was incurably stupid. Just now, there were other people who were attacking the Spirit Wolf, giving her time to run away. However, she actually did not move a single step!_This is not good. If this continues, then everyone will die under this Magical Beast. We have to get rid of this thing!_\u201cMonkey, are you able to rush forth?\u201d Mo Fan had an idea, and hurriedly asked Zhang Xiaohou, who wasn\u2019t too far away.Zhang Xiaohou nodded repeatedly.\u201cGood, I will attract the attention of the Magical Beast. When I do that, you must carry me and run toward the cavern, do you understand?\u201d Mo Fan said to Zhang Xiaohou with a serious tone.\u201cBrother Fan, what are you planning on doing?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou asked.\u201cSlaughtering it!\u201d Mo Fan clenched his teeth, using the pain to calm himself down.The Fire Element Stardust turned into a cosmic space as it swirled around Mo Fan\u2019s body. Each of the fire elemental stars finally began to link with one another to become a Magical Star Path at the command of Mo Fan.The speed of completing a Star Path for Mo Fan was very quick. After he connected the sixth star, the seventh and most disobedient star finally acknowledged Mo Fan\u2019s command.Completing the Star Path, the Magic was cast!A scorching flame ignited within Mo Fan\u2019s fists. The scarlet flame was erupting between Mo Fan\u2019s fingers.\u201cFire Burst, Burning Bones!\u201dEverything was complete. Mo Fan\u2019s hair was fluttering madly from the airflow.As the fierce flame was thrown, the Fireball whistled through the air. It flew toward the Spirit Wolf\u2019s massive trunk with extreme accuracy.The Fireball\u2019s impact was initially silent. After a second, it looked like a frantically growing scarlet vine. It actually ignited the Spirit Wolf\u2019s body! The intensity of the flame was far more powerful than the Fire Burst cast by Zhou Min!The fierce flames were very bright, and also very ferocious. The Spirit Wolf raised its head and emitted an exceedingly pained howl.The Spirit Wolf seemed to be in agony, running and rolling around on the ground. Finally, it turned and jumped into the pond.The flames from Burning Bones didn\u2019t dissipate even in the the water. The horrifying power of the flame probably burned the Spirit Wolf\u2019s viscera into ashes!Zhou Min, Zhang Xiaohou, Wang Sanpang, and Zhang Yinglu saw this scene, and were completely dumbstruck.The disorganized Elite Students who were outside of the mountain pass were also looking at Mo Fan in disbelief.\u201cBrother Fan\u2026 your Fire Burst\u2026\u201d Zhang Xiaohou stared at Mo Fan, stunned.The power of Mo Fan\u2019s Fire Burst was far stronger than Zhou Min, and even the effects of the flames weren\u2019t the same.Zhou Min\u2019s Fire Burst was at the Scorch level. After the fires struck the Spirit Wolf\u2019s body, all they did was continue searing the surface of its body. This kind of scorching would only burn off the outer layer of the Spirit Wolf\u2019s skin and fur, and not truly damage its muscles and bones.In contrast, Mo Fan\u2019s Fire Burst looked like it had ignited inside the Spirit Wolf\u2019s body. The effects of everyone\u2019s spells together just a while ago didn\u2019t look as effective as Mo Fan\u2019s single Fire Burst!On the stone platform, the summoner called Bai Yang creased his brow at this moment.There was a telepathic link between a summoned beast and the summoner. Bai Yang was able to feel the excessive pain his Spirit Wolf was suffering; he was very clear on the fact that the Fire Burst used by the student had actually thoroughly damaged the Spirit Beast.\u201cFire Burst, Burning Bones?!\u201d At this moment, both Chief Instructor Zhankong, as well as Mrs. Tangyue, revealed astonished looks on their faces!Zhankong and Tangyue were both Fire Element cultivators. How could they not understand Fire\u2019s primary spell?The Fire Element\u2019s primary spell, Fire Burst, was divided into three levels.The first level of Fire Burst was known as Scorch. Scorch was the lowest form of the Fire Burst. The power it possessed was just quickly igniting the target in order to burn them.However, the second level of Fire Burst was completely different.Fire Burst, Burning Bones, worked as the name implied; after the fireball hit the enemy, flames of an increasingly high temperature would directly ignite within the enemy\u2019s body. It was able to burn even the bones to ashes!The external burns of Scorch were unable to deal a lot of damage to the Spirit Wolf. In one aspect, it was because the students had no idea about where to attack, while in a different aspect, the Spirit Wolf\u2019s fur also possessed high resistance to magic.Burning Bones was completely different. The dreadful flames that came from the internal combustion could very well burn the Spirit Wolf\u2019s insides completely away.\u201cThis student\u2026 what\u2019s his name?\u201d Zhankong came back to his senses, his eyes finally revealing traces of praise. Being able to achieve the second level of Fire Element spells, this student was remarkable!\u201cHis name is Mo Fan!\u201d Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s face revealed a slight smile._Mo Fan actually did not let me down. In just a short period of a year, he has already risen to the level of Burning Bones!_The truth was, the first Fire Burst spell she ever shown the students was actually Burning Bones. That was why the effects of the flames at that time were far stronger than the ones the students had seen before.\u201cThis student, we can give him an S!\u201d Zhankong said with satisfaction.Instructor Luo Yunbo and Vice Instructor Pan Lijun also nodded agreement. There was barely anyone of the younger generation who could reach this kind of realm within all of Bo City.Suddenly, the summoner called Bai Yang yelled out, \u201cCrap!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chief Instructor Zhankong demanded quickly.\u201cAfter the Spirit Wolf jumped into the pond, I don\u2019t know why, but for some reason, it is suddenly ignoring me! It seems\u2026 it seems like I can\u2019t control it!\u201d Bai Yang said, his face pale.\u201cDisgraceful! Didn\u2019t I tell you to tame this guy\u2019s wild nature?\u201d Zhankong scolded him sharply.These words from Bai Yang caused Tangyue, Zhang Jianoguo, and Chen Weiliang\u2019s faces to shift quickly.Out of control!?This Spirit Wolf\u2019s combat prowess was a bit stronger than a One-eyed Magic Wolf. If he lost control of it, there was no way to know how many students would fall to it!\u201cQuick, go stop it!\u201d\u201cNot good, it takes some time for us to get there!\u201d\u201cHow could you lose control? Crap, it\u2019s over. There\u2019s gonna be people dying!\u201d Director Chen Weiliang was terrified.The Spirit Wolf had been lenient with its moves, or else some students would have already died within the cavern.Now, they\u2019d lost control of the Spirit Wolf. It would now truly start its slaughter, there would only be a few students who would be able to survive.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I-I don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d the summoner Bai Yang mumbled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of saying that now, quick, go and rescue them!\u201d Zhankong shouted angrily.____________________Translator : TofuEditor : RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its originally green pupils had turned completely scarlet.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s wild nature was very hard to tame. Once it received a strong and fierce stimulation, it could easily go mad. On a battlefield, the Spirit Wolf\u2019s madness could be a useful effect. However, to the students, it would be a disaster!The scarlet red pupils were filled with a dreadful, ominous glint. The exceedingly angry Spirit Wolf\u2019s eyes were fixated on Mo Fan; its killing intent turned into a shivering cold energy as it lunged towards Mo Fan.Mo Fan\u2019s entire body stood motionless.This Spirit Wolf was far stronger and crueler than he had imagined.\u201cM\u2026Monkey!\u201d Mo Fan was barely able to muster up the strength to speak.Zhang Xiaohou also felt this dreadful killing intent as he frantically linked his Star Path.Before, he was unable to complete his Wind Star Path. Now, he had no choice but to do so. If he failed, Mo Fan would be crushed to death in an instant.\u201cAwoooooh\u2026!\u201dThe Spirit Wolf flew up with its four limbs. Smoke and dust swirled up behind it.This explosive power!The transition time between the Spirit Wolf\u2019s immobility to jumping speed was less than a second, the explosive power was exceedingly dreadful!\u201cBrother Fan!\u201dWithin the border between life and death, Zhang Xiaohou firmly grabbed onto the rigid Mo Fan.A Wind Trail became Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s speed tunnel. Zhang Xiaohou almost stole Mo Fan from between the Wolf\u2019s jaws in this crucial situation, and continued fleeing toward the inner part of the cavern._Agh!_The Spirit Wolf\u2019s teeth closed on air with an ear-piercing crunch.As it bit into the empty air, it felt a great humiliation. The dreadful creature once more broke out its astonishing speed as it chased the pair into the cavern.Within the cavern were quite a few students who had fainted. They climbed up with great effort, only to be greeted once more by a mad Spirit Wolf.These students were all promptly sent flying with their blood splashing everywhere.\u201cRun, run quickly! Quick!\u201d Mo Fan looked behind them. He could see that the Spirit Wolf was a bit faster than Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s Wind Trail, Swift Travel.\u201cI-I really am trying!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou was dripping with sweat, and didn\u2019t dare to shift his concentration in the slightest.The wind was whistling by his ear. Behind them was a tremendous monster Wolf madly pursuing them; even jumping would only cause them to slow down at this point.\u201cJust drop me in the front, run away after that. I will deal with it!\u201d Mo Fan regained his calm before he spoke confidently.\u201cHow could I do that, I will not drag Brother Fan down\u2026\u201dA friend in need is a friend, indeed. If he could survive this, then Mo Fan would definitely be moved.The problem was, whether he would still be able to survive or not would depend on this godforsaken cavern.In the deeper part of the cavern was a spacious cave. The ground was ragged, and the ceiling was completely covered in stalactites.This place had no students, and also no place to run. It was a dead end.Zhang Xiaohou has already done his best. His Wind Trail has already given the two of them enough time to fight for their lives. Now, the Spirit Wolf had finally caught up to them, and they had no way to escape now.\u201cBrother Fan, aren\u2019t we quite mighty? We baited the Spirit Wolf all the way here so the others could run away\u2026\u201d Zhang Xiaohou suddenly said with a strange calm.Mo Fan\u2019s back was leaning against the stone wall as he looked toward the Spirit Wolf, who had already found them. He scolded Xiaohou, smiling, \u201cBullshit. I, Mo Fan, would never do something like that.\u201d\u201cCareful!!!\u201d As Mo Fan said this, sand and stones spurted out of the Spirit Wolf\u2019s mouth as it gathered up the sharp rocks within the cavern, before sending them flying toward the pair.Zhang Xiaohou was a Wind Mage, his movement speed was slightly faster. He initially wanted to dodge, but then he noticed that Mo Fan was definitely not fast enough to do so.Clenching his teeth, Zhang Xiahou shoved Mo Fan behind a large rock.At this point, it was too late for him to evade the cyclone of stones. His body was instantly hit by the sharp rocks, leaving behind numerous injuries. Several eye-grabbing bloody holes appeared!\u201cBastard, you bastard! If something happens to Monkey, I, Mo Fan, will definitely stomp you until you become minced meat!\u201d Mo Fan yelled angrily.There wasn\u2019t enough time for Mo Fan to check whether Zhang Xiaohou was alive or not. Taking advantage of the time the Spirit Wolf was recharging, Mo Fan closed his eyes!After he opened his eyes, Mo Fan\u2019s pupils were actually filled with densely packed purple lightning!Eyes like Lightning, hair like Fire!Stars shone inside Mo Fan\u2019s pupils. After the gorgeous purple stars felt their owner\u2019s anger, they unified like never before. They connected into a beautiful, purple path, exceedingly dazzling in the dark cavern.The Star Path was before him, Mo Fan stood proud.\u201cLightning Strike, Python!\u201d As he said this, a Lightning trace that looked like a great snake appeared around Mo Fan. It writhed with the anger in Mo Fan\u2019s heart.He held his arm up high and gripped his hand. Lightning was crackling out between his fingers.The Lightning Python turned into a brave and fierce lightning soldier after receiving the command of Mo Fan. It whipped out in an explosive tangle of voltage!One after another, the arcs of the Lightning Python hit the Spirit Wolf\u2019s body. They electrified the Spirit Wolf\u2019s muscles, paralyzing them, and struck its skin so hard it burst apart.\u201cAwooowooowoooh!\u201dLightning Strike\u2019s power was quite a bit stronger than Burning Bones. This was also one of the few spells that was able to injure the Spirit Wolf.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s fur had already been charred black. Blood was madly dripping from its flesh and skin!Even if the Spirit Wolf was in pain, it was still unable to move due to the Lightning Strike\u2019s paralysis. Its pair of scarlet eyes were still completely fixated on Mo Fan.That\u2019s right, it was killing intent!This mad summoned Beast had already completely turned into a wild Magical Beast brimming with killing intent. That pair of eyes only had a thirst for killing and disdain for human lives!\u201cFire Burst, Burning Bones!\u201dMo Fan\u2019s stars linked once more, his pupils turning from purple to a flaming red.The Fire stars connected quickly under his burning eyes. They quickly formed into a Star Path that was able to draw the magical power from Mo Fan\u2019s body!Staring at this Spirit Wolf\u2019s eyes, Mo Fan\u2019s heart didn\u2019t feel any fear at this moment. What he felt was anger and an unwavering will.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s eyes flashed a trace of contempt toward the weak human. It was like it was saying, \u201cSo what if you use it one more time. Burning Bones won\u2019t be able to kill me! In the second that my muscles are no longer locked, I will slice you in two!\u201dEven though it was exceedingly painful, the Spirit Wolf was still able to endure the internal combustion from Burning Bones.The Lightning Python or the Burning Bones were still not enough to kill it. Thus, the end result would still be humans ending up as its food._You livestock\u2026!_Mo Fan could feel the contempt coming from the Spirit Wolf\u2019s eyes.\u201cLook who\u2019s going to die!\u201d Mo Fan yelled out angrily. The Fire stars turned into a scorching fireball condensing in Mo Fan\u2019s palm._________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why were the flames flying toward the ceiling?The Spirit Wolf was paralyzed by the Lightning Strike, standing in one place and unable to move. In this kind of situation, hitting it with a Flame Burst, Burning Bones would be far too easy. It would be the same as the normal wooden doll which they used to practice with\u2026However, Mo Fan did something that made the Spirit Wolf feel like he was a complete retard.Mo Fan was smiling with his mouth opened. The light from the fire showed his fanatical smile._Boom!!!_Fireburst, Burning Flames was like a meteor in the air as it struck the root of a stalactite.The flames from Burning Bones wouldn\u2019t be useless just because the target was a rock. The internal combustion of the Burning Bones instantly heated the slender root of the stalactite red-hot._Gurgle~_Just a second was enough for the flames that could burn bones into ashes to melt the stalactite\u2019s root away.The stalactite was massive. After it snapped from the heat and its own weight, it turned into a massive stalactite spear falling from the highest point of the cavern.In the beginning, the Spirit Wolf carried only contempt and suspicion. However, after it realized the snapped-off stalactite was right above his own head, it finally displayed panic.\u201cI won\u2019t bother seeing you out!\u201d Mo Fan slowly retracted the hand that threw out the Fire Burst before he smiled coldly._That\u2019s right! Lightning Strike is only able to restrict your movements and Burning Bones won\u2019t be able to kill you. However, this father, I, will use wisdom to crush you!_The stalactite stone was massive, it was like a colossal stone sword had punched down into the body of the Spirit Wolf\u2026It drove right through the Spirit Wolf\u2019s back, piercing it deeply through the abdomen. Just like that, it was fiercely nailed to the ground!Blood started to flow out from the Spirit Wolf\u2019s guts. Following this were some broken stalactite rocks falling and bouncing off it. Soon enough, they formed a large pile beneath the Spirit Wolf\u2019s body.The Spirit Wolf stood there\u2026It wasn\u2019t even able to collapse. The scarlet pupils gradually returned to their former green color as the last seconds of its life passed by.It turned its head to look at the stalactite that had pierced its body, and then glanced at the insignificant human.Other than being unable to believe this, there was no other thoughts that could be seen in its eyes.The Spirit Wolf\u2019s arrogant dignity was completely gone. It became increasingly weak, so much that it was unable to even struggle.Life passes by just like that\u2026By this tiny Magician\u2026\u2014A whistling sound was heard.A wind was racing wildly along from the cave entrance. The students covered in bruises and wounds all raised their heads weakly.A man dropped down from the sky. On his back was a massive pair of wings condensed by the Wind Spirits, covering their line of sight.\u201cWind\u2026 Wind Wings!\u201d Mu Bai, who had finally regained consciousness raised his head,staring at the mustached man in disbelief.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s the Chief Military Instructor!\u201d\u201cHeavens, what am I seeing? An angel!?\u201dThe entire group inside the entrance to the mountain was astonished.They had guessed that Chief Instructor Zhankong was a super-strong Mage. However, they never imagined that he was a high-ranked Mage who was able to control Wind Wings!Wind Wings!That was a spell that allowed a person to genuinely fly around like an angel!Zhankong glanced at this group of students who didn\u2019t seem like they were in a life-threatening situation, and then glanced toward the inner cavern that had a large noise echoing out of it.\u201cI hope that student who used Burning Bones is still alive.\u201d Zhankong didn\u2019t dare to remain any longer, his large Wind Wings flapped with sudden force, and he flew deeper into the cave like an arrow.Ragged stones were slammed to the sides by Zhankong. The Chief Instructor passed through the long path in a stunning manner before he finally arrived at the spacious bottom of the cavern.\u201cFire Burst, Rupture!\u201dFloating within the dark cavern, Zhankong was gripping his hand, and a fireball appeared there.The Fireball was tossed to the mid-air of the cavern before it ruptured like a gorgeous firecracker, lighting up the entire cavern.Zhankong looked around. He only hoped that the Spirit Wolf still had a bit of intellect remaining, so that it would allow that student called Mo Fan to barely stay alive.That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t try to save the mana in his Stardust, he hoped to find that student as soon as possible.The radiance from the flames lit the entire cavern up bright.However, in the next second, Zhankong was completely flabbergasted.The Chief Instructor floated there, his brown eyes filled with astonishment!This\u2026 How could this be possible!!\u2014On top of the stone platform, the summoner Bai Yang\u2019s expression was frantic as he sat there. His heart was only wishing for the Boss Zhankong to get there in time.\u201cFatal\u2026\u201d Chen Weiliang was on the ground, completely weak. If a Student died on the Practicals this time, he would be held fully responsible. The country put a large degree of importance on these Magic Students. Even the tyrant of Bo City, Mu Zhuoyun, would not dare to injure the students in any way.Tangyue bit her lip.She thought back to that day when she was still making jokes with Mo Fan. She had joked about how she\u2019d use the Wechat locator to retrieve his dead body, but she never thought that the day would come so soon.Tangyue was actually very interested in Mo Fan. On one hand, she felt that this student seemed to have a secret other than the growth-type Stardust Magic Tool. On the other hand, she thought that he had potential, and she wanted to see what kind of realm he would be able to reach\u2026A pity, what a pity\u2026\u201cBia Yang, just what happened? How could the summoned beast turn mad for no reason? Even if the Burning Bones was painful for it, there\u2019s still no reason for you to lose control!\u201d Luo Yunbo criticized him angrily.For a summoner, the basics of the basics were about controlling their own summoned beast!\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026 Normally speaking, even if he were to be killed, he wouldn\u2019t start slaughtering the students without my command. I really don\u2019t know why it has turned out like this,\u201d Bai Yang said as he trembled.This whole thing really did not make any sense.Bai Yang never thought that there\u2019d be students who could use Burning Bones and actually oppress his own summoned beast. What he expected even less was losing control of the summoned beast for this reason. There had to be something else involved in this.\u201cYou should just pray for your lost beast to not kill too many people,\u201d Pan Lijun said coldly.\u201cI\u2026I also\u2026Ah!\u201d Bai Yang was about to explain, but suddenly he felt a fierce pain in his head.This kind of feeling was like his soul had been fiercely chopped. It was so painful that it made Bai Yang\u2019s entire face turn pale as he sweated profusely.\u201cWhat happened now??\u201d Luo Yuanbo demanded, as he began to lose his patience.\u201cMy\u2026my Spirit Wolf\u2026 My Spirit Wolf!!\u201d Suddenly, Bai Yang looked as though he had lost his soul. His entire being knelt down on the floor, his empty eyes looking over at the cavern dully.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Tangyue also creased her eyebrows. She had no idea what this summoner called Bai Yang was doing.\u201cMy Spirit Wolf\u2026It\u2026 It died!\u201d Bai Yang barely spit out those words, looking as though he had lost his soul. He sounded like he didn\u2019t believe the words, either.________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if he was faster, there\u2019s no way that Zhankong would kill the wolf. In which case, just how exactly did the Spirit Wolf die?\u201cAfter the summoned beast of the summoner dies, they themselves will receive damage to their spirit and soul. It seems like the Spirit Wolf really died,\u201d Tangyue commented softly.Bai Yang\u2019s appearance just now was very clearly the result of a summoned beast\u2019s death, it was not something that could be faked.\u201cDidn\u2019t the Spirit Wolf chase Mo Fan into the cavern?\u201d\u201cYeah, how come it suddenly died?\u201d\u201cIs it possible that the Spirit Wolf hit a rock and died due to the cavern being too dark?\u201d Chen Weiliang wondered.Bai Yang turned his face around, his eyes brimming with maliciousness. \u201cYou fucking hit a rock and died, your whole fucking family hit a rock and died!\u201d_My Spirit Wolf isn\u2019t some stupid rabbit who would crash into a wooden pole and die! The Spirit Wolf had night vision, and its body was strong! How could it possibly hit a stone and die?!_Even if all forty students were to use their Magic at same time, they would not necessarily kill his Spirit Wolf!\u201cLet\u2019s go and check,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said.\u201cYes, yes, let\u2019s hurry and check it out.\u201d\u201cThe reinforcements will arrive soon, and they\u2019ll take these students back.\u201d\u2014\u2014_Inside of the cavern\u2026_Chief Instructor Zhankong remained dumbfounded; he was unable to believe the scene his eyes were showing him.The student called Mo Fan didn\u2019t die, and at this moment, his entire body was covered in wounds.The Spirit Wolf, who originally should\u2019ve been dealt with by Zhankong, was currently standing beneath\u2026 or more accurately speaking, it was being pierced by a stalactite, directly pinning it to the cavern floor.There were no longer any signs of life.The Spirit Wolf had died!The combat prowess of this Spirit Wolf was in no way inferior to a genuine Magical Beast. The reason why Zhankong let it out was definitely not to defeat the students, it was to allow the fake Magical Beast to give the students some genuine practice!Defeating this Spirit Wolf?!That was something that they shouldn\u2019t have been able to do. Even a genuine squad of Hunters would be defeated by a Magical Beast, and let\u2019s not even talk about those students who turned soft when they saw a Magical Beast.Thus, after Zhankong charged into this place, he only hoped for there to be fewer students dying before he could deal with the Spirit Wolf.However, he saw a scene that he himself could not believe.The Spirit Wolf had died!It was impaled by the stalactite._There can\u2019t be something this coincidental in this world. There\u2019s no way the stalactite would drop by itself and precisely hit the mad Spirit Wolf. Let alone with the Spirit Wolf\u2019s reflexes; before the stalactite could drop on it, it would definitely be able to dodge._\u201cThis\u2026this was done by you?\u201d Chief Instructor, Zhankong didn\u2019t come back to his senses for a long time. At last, he finally locked his gaze on Mo Fan.This student looked like nothing special. He had neatly cut short hair, and a face that you could say was quite handsome. His body and his face that revealed that he was somewhat exhausted. His hands were firmly holding onto the other thin and weak youth covered in bloodstains, as if he planned on carrying him out of the cavern.Mo Fan raised his head, and his eyes also showed astonishment._Wings! The Chief Instructor has wings!_Wind Wings, Mo Fan knew this was Wind Wings. However, he never thought that actually seeing the Wind Wings would stun his heart like this.The shadow hovering in the mid-air, the Wind Wings behind his back that looked like an angel\u2019s\u2026 _Damn it, that\u2019s so cool!_\u201cHow did you do this?\u201d Zhankong still carried some disbelief. After asking this, Zhankong suddenly felt like he was asking too much.From the perspective of following the crime scene and all the signs, it would be that this student used the Fire Burst to snap the stalactite, and made it fall down and pierce the Spirit Wolf.However, Zhankong\u2019s heart was still filled with numerous suspicions, as well as astonishment.First, just what degree of calm did this student have if he could think of baiting the Spirit Wolf into the cavern and using the stalactite as a weapon? Second, just how did he make the Spirit Wolf remain in place long enough to allow the stalactite stone to pierce through it?In short, he was genuinely unable to accept the fact that a second-year high school student was capable of killing a Spirit Wolf whose strength was a bit stronger than a Magical Beast by himself!\u201cChief Instructor, I passed by this blue bracelet in the cavern, does this mean I\u2019ve completed the bounty? Where\u2019s my Magic Equipment?\u201d Mo Fan walked in front of Zhankong and smiled.Zhangkong quickly thought back and suddenly realized something._Goddamnit!!_He had never prepared any Magic Tool!The difficulty of this bounty was extremely high. Since the cavern was guarded by the Spirit Wolf, the blue bracelet was only put there to act as a symbol. There was no hope whatsoever for the students to acquire it!According to Zhankong\u2019s predictions, half of the students would be eliminated at the previous checkpoint, and the remainder would be completely annihilated by the Spirit Wolf.He would never have thought that this heaven-defying student would actually slaughter the Spirit Wolf! Just what kind of demon was this!?Even instructors would not necessarily be able to resist the Spirit Wolf, yet it was killed by a student!As for the Magic Equipment?Magic Equipment was extremely precious, how could Zhankong possibly gift one away?However, now\u2026 This student had clearly completed the bounty.Mo Fan watched the Chief Instructor, whose face had turned incredibly strange, carefully as he reached out his hand to demand the Magic Equipment._Cough_ \u2026 \u201cLet\u2019s save the people first, let\u2019s save them first!!\u201d Zhankong answered awkwardly at last.\u201cOh, oh, that\u2019s right\u2026 I remember you said it was a defensive Magic Equipment, a defense Magic Equipment worth tens of thousands of RMB!\u201d Mo Fan nodded his head, showing his approval.The hovering Chief Instructor\u2019s wings turned rather unstable, and he almost didn\u2019t dodge the fallen stalactite._Student, let\u2019s save the people first!__________________Translator : TofuEditor : RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Following that, Mo Fan watched a woman with a curvy, delicate body slowly emerge from it. The incredible scene caused Mo Fan to feel a despondent awe._Holy crap, just what kind of spell is this, that\u2019s too cool!?_\u201cMrs. Tangyue\u2026\u201d Mo Fan clearly saw this woman\u2019s perfect oval face, willow leaf brows, and Demon Fox eyes!\u201cYou\u2019re okay??\u201d Mrs. Tangyue revealed a joyous smile.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dMrs. Tangyue shifted her eyes and quickly discovered the Spirit Wolf pinned there like a collector\u2019s specimen. Suddenly, she was unable to keep her calm.\u201cThis\u2026This is\u2026\u201d Mrs. Tangyue blurted out, stunned.\u201cYou have nurtured a demonic student. The Spirit Wolf was killed by him,\u201d Zhankong told her.Mrs. Tangyue felt so shocked that she opened her mouth blankly as her gaze fixed on Mo Fan.Mo Fan felt embarrassed from all the looks, coughing before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s save the people first, let\u2019s save them\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014Outside of the mountain pass, Mu Bai, Xu Zhaoting, Zhao Kunsan, Zhang Shuhua, and He Yu were all clear-headed.The other students also gradually regained their senses. Each and every one of them assembled near the pond like refugees, their bodies were also trembling.Not long after, Zhankong and Mrs. Tangyue led Mo Fan out of the cavern.After everyone saw that Mo Fan was actually still alive, each of their faces revealed an expression like they had seen a ghost!They had personally seen Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou lead the Spirit Wolf into the cavern. In that kind of situation, even if they had hundred lives, they\u2019d still be shredded to pieces by the Spirit Wolf.\u201cMo Fan\u2026 Mo Fan\u2026 you guys didn\u2019t die?\u201d He Yu was finally clear-headed. Seeing Zhang Xiaohou and Mo Fan still alive, her tears began to flow.The eyes of class president Zhou Min, seeing the two of them were safe and sound, also began to redden.If it wasn\u2019t for Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou luring the Spirit Wolf into the cavern, there was no telling how many people would have lost their lives. No matter how you put it, it was they who had saved everyone!The other girls who also had wounds on their bodies began to weep. They had always been in an easy and comfortable place like school, they had never experienced this kind of situation.The male students were either laying on the ground, looking blankly into the air, or were rejoicing over the two heroes, Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou.Originally, they thought that as long as they possessed Magic, they could do anything. At school, they would also feel proud and arrogant. At the end of the day, when they truly faced a Magical Beast, they weren\u2019t even able to cast their spells. If it wasn\u2019t for Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou luring the Spirit Wolf away, then the consequences would have been too unbearable to imagine.\u201cOh right, just how did they escape from the Wolf\u2019s claws, and where is the One-eyed Magic Wolf now?\u201d Wang Sanpang and Xu Zhaoting asked.\u201cDo you even need to ask that? The One-eyed Magic Wolf has definitely been killed by the Chief Instructor. Zhankong\u2019s arrival was just in time; if he was even a second slower, then they would\u2019ve already been eaten,\u201d Zhao Kunsan declared.The Chief Instructor glanced at the Zhao Kunsan who was making remarks; he couldn\u2019t help but think it was funny. They were both students, yet the difference was unnaturally large.\u201cSince everyone is not in a life-threatening situation, then I have some things to say,\u201d Chief Instructor Zhankong said, loud enough for everyone to hear.Everyone was sitting outside of the mountain pass. The teachers were helping the students wrap their wounds, and the students were helping each other clean their injuries.\u201cIn the process of you completing this bounty, we have actually been observing you all the entire time. Additionally, we will grade the students who have done well, among them being Zhang Xiaohou, Zhou Min, Mu Bai, Li Yueming\u2026\u201d Zhankong went on.These words immediately caused a disturbance amongst the students.The teachers were paying attention to the students during the process of the Practicals. There were a lot of people who began to regret not doing well.\u201cThen when the Magical Beast appeared\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you guys\u2026 Were you guys going to appear after we died?!\u201d Mu Bai asked resentfully.To be honest, he was almost killed by the Magical Beast!\u201cIf this Spirit Wolf really wanted to kill you, you would already have died. Especially you!\u201d Zhankong coldly snorted.Mu Bai puckered his brow as he thought back to the scene from before. Indeed, if the Spirit Wolf had really slammed down with its foreleg, then his little life would have already dissipated.\u201cWait, Chief Instructor, what did you say that Magical Beast was? A Spirit Wolf?\u201d Zhou Min hastily asked as she suddenly realized something.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that wasn\u2019t an One-eyed Magic Wolf. That was a Spirit Wolf. It\u2019s a summoned beast,\u201d Zhankong continued.\u201cLet me explain things to everyone. The bounty Practical this time was actually arranged by us and the instructors. Even the summoned beast actually belongs to this instructor, Bai Yang. We needed you to face against a Magical Beast, but at same time, we didn\u2019t want you to be killed by one\u2026\u201d the homeroom teacher, Xue Musheng explained.As this was being said, all of the students started crying in relief.So it was actually just practice. Why did it have to be so real, they genuinely thought that they were actually going to die!Additionally, the Spirit Wolf\u2019s combat prowess was far too scary. There were so many of them using magic, yet it was ineffective against the Spirit Wolf.\u201cI was just thinking how Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou could have survived it, it seems like it was a summoned beast\u2026\u201d Zhao Kunsan said with disdain.\u201cThat\u2019s wrong. The truth is, just now, there was something that exceeded our expectations. This Spirit Wolf suddenly went out of control, it no longer heeded the commands of summoner Bai Yang. Just when we thought the Spirit Wolf was going to massacre you all, Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou lured it into the cavern. Thus, your lives was actually saved by the two of them,\u201d Zhang Jianguo stated.\u201cHeavens, then we really are fortunate!\u201d Zhang Yinglu couldn\u2019t help but yell out.\u201cWhat fortunate, it was Mo Fan and Zhang Xiahou who saved us. These two brothers, if there is anything in the future, don\u2019t hesitate to issue me a command. I will not decline it under any circumstances!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re thankful for your bravery. From now on, you will be our eldest brothers!\u201dWang Sanpang and Xu Zhaoting were friends, and very proud and arrogant. However, now they were both expressing their thanks to Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou.Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan were just standing there with their faces pale. How could they accept that the person they despised most had actually saved their little lives?\u201cTeacher, you better give extra attention to this cavern. If that berserk summoned beast were to charge out\u2026\u201d Zhou Min reminded them.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the summoned beast has already died,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said.\u201cMhm, it was killed by Mo Fan,\u201d Zhankong nodded his agreement.\u201cOh, as long as it\u2019s dead, as long as it is dead. That kind of berserk summoned beast\u2026 Wait, Chief Instructor, what did you just say?\u201d Wang Sanpang didn\u2019t immediately come to his senses before he opened his eyes and asked again._________________Translator : TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One could tell that this summoner\u2019s heart had collapsed!A magnificent Spirit Wolf was single-handedly killed by a student participating in his first Practical!Shit, if he knew this would be the result, then Bai Yang would much rather believe that the Spirit Wolf was as stupid as a rabbit, hitting a rock by itself! This was too insulting for a Spirit Wolf\u2019s pride!Instructor Bai Yang had lost his spirit. Presumably, he wouldn\u2019t be able to calm down even if he were to write a paper._(TL Note: Essentially, a form of meditation for him.)_A huge waste!There would be nothing more wasteful than this for the rest of his life!It took a squadron about two months, and immeasurable amount of resources and manpower to finally subdue the Spirit Wolf. However\u2026 it was killed by a second-year High school student. How could these instructors possibly endure that!?Each of the students was increasingly more dumbstruck.They were very clear on how abnormal this Spirit Wolf was, they knew that it would be a one-sided massacre\u2026However, Mo Fan was the same as them, a second-year High school student. He relied on his own powers to kill the Spirit Wolf!_Kneel!__Really have to kneel!_\u201cThe other thing, I\u2019ll tell you some good news. Due to Mo Fan completing this impossible mission, you, the students of the Elite class, will all receive grade A!\u201d Chief Instructor Zhankong said to all the students.\u201cR\u2026really?\u201d\u201cThank God, if I get an A, then I will definitely be able to enter a good Magic University!\u201d\u201cMo Fan, you are simply my greatest benefactor! I will definitely repay you when I\u2019m rich!\u201d\u201cMo Fan, do you have a girlfriend?\u201d a girl who was saved by him asked him with a whisper as she blushed.\u201cMo Fan, do you need a boyfriend?\u201dIn an instant, Mo Fan became everyone\u2019s hero.After all, not only did he save everyone\u2019s lives, he even made it possible for everyone to receive an A grade on everyone\u2019s extremely important Practicals!Zhao Kunsan was going to make a few more sarcastic remarks, but he was encircled by fiendish gazes from the surroundings. He swallowed his words deeply.Mu Bai\u2019s face was still extremely ugly.He was the first student to use Magic; however, it was ineffective. Then he was stuck unconscious by the Spirit Wolf. In the end, his limelight was stolen by Mo Fan.\u2014\u201cAii, did you hear? That bounty was completed by a student. It seems like Bai Yang\u2019s Spirit Wolf was directly slaughtered by a student!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit. We all know of the Spirit Wolf\u2019s prowess. If a student completed it, then I will eat the bounty liquid crystal,\u201d said the incredibly bulky captain of a squad.\u201cThen you should go and eat it.\u201d Pan Lijun spoke up suddenly as she swept her gaze across that man.\u201cGo look at it yourself, the bounty has been completed!\u201dThe veterans in the stronghold all raised their heads. Sure enough, they discovered the bounty was flashing \u201cCompleted\u201d, and beneath it said, \u201cTian Lan Magic High second-year student \u2013 Mo Fan\u201d!\u201cDamn, that youngster sure is courageous!\u201dIn an instant, the veterans within the stronghold were all stunned.The face of the person who said he\u2019d eat a liquid crystal turned exceedingly ugly._Holy crap, there really is a student who completed a bounty which I wouldn\u2019t be able to complete?_Soon enough, the news had spread across the stronghold.Except for the Battlemages of Bo City, most of the people in the stronghold were hunters who wandered the mountains. These hunters relied on bounties and killing Magical Beasts to survive. After the news of this came out, each of the veterans within the stronghold felt a bit ashamed. The ones who ridiculed the students the most at the time were exactly these people.\u201cThat Magical Equipment\u2026 the Defensive Magical Equipment?\u201d the bald meddler asked hastily.\u201cBoss Zhankong is having a headache right now. He never prepared any Magic Equipment because everyone knew the students would not be able to complete this\u2026 Boss Zhankong is a very trustworthy person, he should be buying a Defensive Magic Equipment to give to the student,\u201d Pan Lijun said.\u201cThis student has made a huge profit, even Boss Zhankong\u2019s heart is bleeding! Us who have gone through fire and flames will not necessarily get a piece of Defensive Magic Equipment\u2026 _sigh!_ \u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, could that kid be the Young Master of some super ancient family? His body must be covered in luxurious adornments, how else was he be able to go up against the Magical Beast?\u201d\u201cBullshit, he\u2019s just a common student. I heard that his dad is just a driver who delivers goods to our stronghold.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that really is too abnormal!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve always been a group when we fight against a Magical Beast.\u201d\u2014Within a stone house, Chief Instructor Zhankong\u2019s hands were clasped onto a case as a painful look crossed his face.\u201cShit, that sinister merchant\u2019s starting offer for this Bone Scythe Shield was 550,000!\u201d Zhankong cursed.On the side, Luo Yunbo, Pan Lijun, and Bai Yang said nothing.A few Battlemages were smiling to themselves. Normally within this stronghold, their Boss Zhankong would beat them until cuts and bruises were all over their bodies. Who would\u2019ve known that there\u2019d be a time where even Boss Zhankong would have a headache, too?A Bone Scythe Shield. This thing was really not cheap. It took quite a lot of Boss Zhankong\u2019s salary. He had promised a reward himself this time. Thus, the government would definitely not cover it!\u201cCall the kid over, _hmph!_ \u201d Zhankong ordered, still in a bad mood.\u201cBoss, I\u2019ve been here this entire time.\u201d Mo Fan raised his hand as he spoke up. Boss Zhankong\u2019s head wasn\u2019t very clear.When Zhankong saw Mo Fan, he felt somewhat angry. He still had no idea exactly how Mo Fan had killed the Spirit Wolf!\u201cTake it.\u201d Zhankong handed the Bone Scythe Shield over to Mo Fan.\u201cChief Instructor, could you let go, please?\u201d Mo Fan asked.Zhankong\u2019s mouth twitched before he finally let go.After Mo Fan received this treasure, he felt excited from head to toe.Facing a Magical Beast this time made Mo Fan realize one point. Just having attack power was not enough. Any Magician who only knew how to attack would get killed by a Magical Beast in a single hit.However, if he had some Defensive Magic Equipment, then it would truly be a treasure during this time that he hadn\u2019t learned a single defensive magic spell!\u201cKid, if you can\u2019t find a suitable job after you\u2019ve graduated, you can come here and report to me,\u201d Zhankong said as he tried to present himself as a gentleman.Even if his heart was reluctant, Zhankong had no choice but to admire this youngster\u2019s courage and quick thinking.The reason why so many Magicians were defeated by Magical Beasts was due to their thought processes. They didn\u2019t understand how to properly use their limited Magic Spells.Indeed, within the level of Primary Magician, all the Mages were only in possession of a single spell. But there were many ways to use a single spell. This kid had already grasped the true essence of magic, which many veteran Mages hadn\u2019t truly understood yet.________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard that even higher levels of Magic are only taught at university,\u201d Mo Fan said.When the Chief Instructor heard this, he felt angry._Sneaky kid, this Instructor inviting you to our forces is your luck, you actually dare to reject me!_\u201cTake the things and go. Don\u2019t let me see you again,\u201d Zhankong snarled, as his bad mood grew worse.\u201cOh right, was there only a single Spirit Wolf guarding the cavern?\u201d As Mo Fan carried it away, he was reminded of something and asked a question.\u201cThere wa only one. If there were others, then you\u2019d already have become their food. Why, do you still have some doubts?\u201d Zhankong demanded.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else, I just wanted to ask.\u201d Mo Fan nodded his head and looked towards Instructor Bai Yang at the side, \u201cYour Spirit Wolf sure can drink.\u201dBai Yang was suspicious, but Mo Fan didn\u2019t care.\u201cHurry up and go!\u201d Zhankong said impatiently.\u2014\u2014Mo Fan was kicked out of the barracks, but he couldn\u2019t help but whisper to himself, \u201cThis Advanced Mage got angry just because he gave away a Magical Equipment?\u201dThe Bone Scythe Shield at this moment was in Mo Fan\u2019s hands\u2026The Bone Scythe Shield just about covered Mo Fan\u2019s entire palm. Mo Fan, who knew nothing about Magical Equipment, was puzzled at this moment._Can something that only covers my palm really withstand the attack of a Magical Beast? Do they really think all Magical Beasts have a compulsive obsession to only hit the shield of Captain America?_After going through some research, Mo Fan finally understood how to use the Bone Scythe Shield.When a Mage used their intent to enter the Bone Scythe Shield, the shield would automatically interlink with the Magician\u2019s spirit and leave behind a Magical Equipment imprint within the Mage\u2019s spirit world.After the imprint was formed, the palm-sized shield would immediately assimilate into the Magician\u2019s body.When the Magician used their intent to circulate the imprint, the magical equipment would immediately appear in front of the user. The shield that would appear at that time would not be the size of a palm, it would become a shield wall the size of a man. Effects like the Spirit Wolf\u2019s flying stones skill would then no longer be able to strike him.\u201cNo wonder this thing\u2019s price is so high. If I had this Bone Scythe Shield when I was up against the Spirit Wolf, then I could safely use magic from behind it!\u201d Mo Fan looked at the large rhombus-shaped Bone Scythe Shield in front of him that bore the pattern of a scythe. He couldn\u2019t help but smile.With this Magical Equipment, he would have some resources to duel against Yu Ang of the Mu Family!\u201cSpeaking of which, I possess both the Lightning and Fire Elements. Although Lightning Strike and Fire Burst are very useful, they still don\u2019t have the desired combat prowess when I am truly facing a Magical Beast.\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but ponder over this dilemma.Being able to kill the Spirit Wolf actually involved lots of good fortune. If it wasn\u2019t for the dazzling light that allowed Mo Fan to see the stalactites in the deeper part of the cavern, or Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s Wind Trail, or the student\u2019s unison attack, then he himself would have been shredded into pieces in an instant by the Spirit Wolf. If it wasn\u2019t for them, then how could he have smoothly completed the bounty this time?_I need to learn a spell similar to Wind Trail and Earth Ripple that allows me to move quickly, and quickly change my own position. Or else, with my slow speed, I might get smacked to death by a Magical Beast before I can even finish forming my Star Path._After going through the battle this time, Mo Fan was finally aware of how important a defensive spell and a movement spell was.In the Primary levels, only the Water Element possessed a defensive spell. In school, everyone thought that the Water Element was of little importance; however, in reality, the Water Element was essentially everyone\u2019s benefactor when it came to battling a Magical Beast.\u201cIn my hands, I have a Bone Scythe Shield. It can barely classify as a defense type spell. Thus, the next time I Awaken, I should consider a movement-type Element, like the Wind Element\u2026 or the cool one like Mrs. Tangyue, a spell that allows you to move through the shadows.\u201dThe Wind Element\u2019s primary spell, Wind Trail, was indeed remarkably useful in an actual battle. If you couldn\u2019t break away from a Magical Beast\u2019s attack, then you wouldn\u2019t even have the margin of time needed to use your magic.The Wind Element was a really good choice, but Mo Fan reckoned that the Shadow Element would suit him even better!After doing his research, Mo Fan understood that the spell which Mrs. Tangyue used to move within the shadows belonged to the Shadow Element.At his stage, the spells that everyone was familiar with were only within the basic Element types.In reality, other than the \u201cBasic Elemental Magic\u201d, Magic had three other main types: White Magic, Black Magic, and Dimensional Magic!The Healing Element was a part of White Magic.The Shadow Element was a part of Black Magic.The Summoning Element which Bai Yang wielded belonged to the Dimensional Magic type.The nine years of compulsory magic education and High School classes only had basic elemental magic. If you wanted to learn about the three secondary types of White, Black, and Dimensional Magic, then you had to go to university.Currently Mo Fan was in possession of the ability to control the Fire Element that possessed high attack power, as well as the tyrannical Lightning Element. With the Bone Scythe Shield, he had gained the ability to defend himself. The only thing he was missing now were the movement spells.If one truly wanted to battle a Magical Beast alone, then one needed to have those abilities!Shadow Element!It was evident that this choice was the most suitable for him.\u201cI have to quickly rise to the ranks of an Intermediate Mage; that way I will be able to Awaken yet another Element. If only I can Awaken the Shadow Element!\u201d Mo Fan said, filled with expectation.Most people could only Awaken a single element as a Primary Mage.Mo Fan had innate double Elements, and thus, it could be said that he already had a huge advantage.An Intermediate Mage could not only learn the Intermediate level Magic spells, they could also Awaken a second time, and give birth to yet another Stardust!After they Awakened yet another Element, the Mage\u2019s battle prowess would definitely have an upgrade in quality!Just like Chief Instructor Zhankong; when Mo Fan first met him, he was playing with flames. From that, you could tell that he was a Fire Mage.However, in the cavern, behind his back was a pair of Wind Wings that shocked everyone\u2019s hearts.Thus it was very evident that not only did he cultivate Fire Element, he also cultivated the Wind Element.Moreover, he could also deduce that Zhankong should be in possession of one more Element\u2019s spell.The Wind Wings was a spell that only Advanced Mages could control. Intermediate Mages already possessed double Elements, and when they reached the Advanced level, they would have a third chance to Awaken. They would have a third Element!In short, Primary Mages only had magic of one Element.Intermediate Mage could Awaken one more Element, and thus be in control of two elemental magicks.Advanced Mage could Awaken yet another Element and control three elemental magicks.Mo Fan was an innate double Element, thus, he was already one step ahead of others from the very beginning.Additionally, if Mo Fan hadn\u2019t had the combination of Fire and Lightning Eements, then he would not have been able to kill the Spirit Wolf. Chief Instructor Zhankong didn\u2019t understand why the Spirit Wolf didn\u2019t evade the falling stalactite. This was because he couldn\u2019t imagine that not only was Mo Fan a Fire Element Mage, he also possessed the Lightning Element Stardust. It was the Lightning Strike that paralyzed the Spirit Wolf, causing it to be immobilized!\u201cI have the little Loach Pendant, as well as my cultivation capacity, which is twice as much as others. Thus, the progress of my cultivation will be much faster than other people. However, having both Lightning Strike and Fire Burst is not enough to single-handedly go up against Magical Beasts. I need to quickly become an Intermediate-level Mage; that way, I would have one more set of elemental spells other than the Lightning and Fire spells I have right now. Having more spells doesn\u2019t create a burden on my body!\u201d_Mhm, mhm, I have to do my best.__How did the slogan of the boys of Class Eight go again?__Oh, right! Make money, cultivate, and marry Tangyue!_____________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus, he would only be slightly bit faster than that fool Mu Bai.If he didn\u2019t want to easily expose the ability of his Lightning Element in front of others, he would not be able to rely on that small advantage to play against the Ancient Mu Family and their cash players!The question is, how would he be able to maximize the increase of his strength?As he decided to Baidu the answer, all it said was: Buy a Stardust Magic Tool!This answer was essentially too stupid.Let\u2019s not bullshit, the Stardust Magic Tool was naturally the best tool to increase his cultivation. The question was whether the Stardust Magic Tool was something a person could buy?However, from Mo Fan\u2019s point of view, other than the Stardust Magic Tool, there were no other good methods!\u201cWhat if I were to upgrade the Little Loach Pendant to Spirit rank, just like the one Mu Ningxue is wearing\u2026\u201cA Common ranked Stardust Magic Tool is only able to increase cultivation by 20%. If I were to upgrade it to a Spirit rank, then it would be a 40% increase. That way, even if I were to practice both the Lightning and Fire Element, then I\u2019d still be much quicker than most people. Mu Ningxue\u2019s starting point was higher than mine by too much. Since she was able to get recruited by the Empire early on, that itself would testify that her strength exceeds mine, and most likely has reached the requirement of universities. If I still slowly cultivate like this, then I will get shaken to death by the ancient Mu Family sooner or later.\u201d Mo Fan didn\u2019t regret making this kind of enemy. He was only able to exhaust all his options to increase his strength due to the enemy\u2019s oppression.Presently, the only thing that could increase his strength faster seemed to be a Stardust Magic Tool.Mrs. Tangyue had mentioned it before. The Little Loach Pendant could be upgraded by absorbing the spirits of Magical Beasts after they died. This meant that he would need to go out and slay Magical Beasts. If his luck was good, then a spirit would really show up. Then his Little Loach Pendant could really be upgraded to Spirit Rank!The 40% cultivation addition for a Mage like Mo Fan, whose cultivation speed was already twice as fast as others, was simply riding a rocket!\u201cIt seems like this is the only way.\u201dSince he had made a decision, then he should brazenly do it!The heavens had given him this advantage. If he were to neglect it, then it\u2019d be good for nothing.\u2014\u2014After the Practicals, there still remained about a month of summer vacation. Mo Fan walked down to the Hall of the Hunter\u2019s Union without hesitation.The Hunter\u2019s Union was an organization formed by wandering Hunter\u2019s Squadrons. There were tens of thousands of Hunter Mages who came to the Hall of the Hunter\u2019s Union to search for missions that were suitable for themselves.Mo Fan had already gone through them. A Spirit Essence\u2019s price on the market exceeded 5 million RMB.Searching for Magical Beasts was the only path Mo Fan could choose to obtain wealth. If he really could gather 5 million RMB first was hard to say, but the Soul Remnants and Soul Essences were something you could only obtain through killing a Magical Beast. This was the only path he could choose now.Killing a Magical Beast by himself?Mo Fan immediately shook his head to reject the idea. He simply did not possess the ability to kill a Magical Beast by himself. Thus, he now needed to look for a Hunter Squad that was suitable for him.Practically all of the Mages in Hunter\u2019s Union formed their own little squads. Those who were able to kill a Magical Beast single-handedly were far too few.\u2014The Hall of Hunters. The people came and went, it felt like a large hall of spirals, while at same time like a job fair.On the wall of the Hall of Hunters was a colossal LCD screen. It announced the newest missions, as well as the rewards of the missions. The lowest reward was 100k RMB, and the higher reward missions could go up to millions.Mo Fan looked at the million-level missions, his saliva almost flowing down his mouth.Completing five of those kinds of missions, and he would be able to buy a Soul Essence to upgrade his Little Loach Pendant by a level.Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t something a normal person could do!\u201cIron Hammer Squad is looking for Ice elemental Mages. Required battle experience is three years and above. Have the desire to cooperate in a team. The most important thing is to have adept control of the Ice spell. The mission has already been received, average reward is 20k RMB, estimated two months completion!\u201d\u201cWind Element Mages, the squad lacks an experienced Wind Magician who can lure an One-eyed Magic Wolf. Other Elements are not needed!\u201d\u201cFire Element. Where are the Fire Mages, join our Fierce Wind Squad! Guaranteed to efficiently complete missions, and get wealthy!\u201dMo Fan swept a glance over to the side, and he discovered that those Magicians who had joined squads before had actually brought resumes!On the resume was distinct proof of their time in other squads, how many missions they\u2019d completed, and the levels of the missions.Mo Fan was dazzled by this scene. For a moment, he had no idea on how to pick.It seemed like the Magicians who had just graduated were those no one wanted. After all, they had far too little experience with Magical Beasts; one small mistake and they\u2019d lose their life. Who would dare to have Mages who just graduated?Mo Fan hadn\u2019t even graduated; he was a student who had just entered his second year of High school. Bringing a Magic Student was simply a nuisance, and essentially defrauding his squad mates. He could tell that it would be very hard to find a suitable squad from his time in Practicals.\u201cShit, being a Mage actually needs qualifications, this particular year\u2026\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but curse.As Mo Fan finished cursing, a man hurriedly ran past Mo Fan and bumped into Mo Fan while cursing even more.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. The City Hunter\u2019s Team is currently recruiting. I have to go and give it a try. Excuse me for bumping into you!\u201d a weak youth wearing thick glasses said to Mo Fan.\u201cCity Hunter\u2019s Team?\u201d Mo Fan asked suspiciously.\u201cYeah, don\u2019t you know? They\u2019re specialized in sweeping dangers within the city. They\u2019re a group who kills Magical Beasts that are hiding within the city. The City Hunter\u2019s Team has always been the first choice of Hunter Mages. After all, they are hunters who can stay within the city. Who likes to run around the desolate areas and fight against unknown creatures? Not to mention the City Hunter\u2019s Team\u2019s rewards have always been really high\u2026\u201d the youth said as he pushed his glasses up.\u201cTong Yubin, you should stop wasting your time. A Mage like you who just graduated from a Magic High School doesn\u2019t have experience, nor the strength. There\u2019s no way the City Hunter\u2019s Team would notice you, unless you\u2019re a Lightning Mage,\u201d an older Hunter to the side ridiculed him.\u201cThey\u2019re looking for Lightning Mages?\u201d Mo Fan asked quickly as his eyes lit up.The City Hunter\u2019s Team, they moved within the city. This is something very suitable for Mo Fan, who was still studying in school.If he were to go to outside, then he wouldn\u2019t know how long it would take him to finish a mission.\u201cLightning Mages have always been in demand for squads. Even the Lightning Mages who have no experience whatsoever will be happily accepted into a squad. After all, the Lightning Mages are far too few, their skills are just simply tyrannical. _Sigh!_ If I were to Awaken a Lightning Element, then I wouldn\u2019t have to be ridiculed by those veterans every day!\u201d that old Hunter said._________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[advantage]: by having their erection in contact with her*[ cent bills]: China has cents in bills called jiao*[Guoshu]: Guo here means country and shu means technique*[ 190 centimeters]: Over 6ft tall*[Lake Cui]: Cui Hu, also means Green Lake*[hundred dyuan bills]: 100yuan is their biggest bill*[Daoist Fierce Tiger]: The author of this novel*[Noodles]: made of wheat*[Rice Noodles]: made of rice*[Zhang Tian Tian]: Tian means sweet*[Bajiquan]: Also known as Eight Extremities Fist, but Bajiquan sounds nicer to me*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was only one Lightning Mage per thousand people, and additionally, the Lightning spells\u2019 power were not inferior to the Fire Element. Plus, it carried a paralysis effect. With a Lightning Mage suppressing the Magical Beasts, the speed it took for a squadron to circle Magical Beasts would be reduced by a large margin!Good, he had found a method that would allow him to make money, as well as increase his combat prowess!_However, in order to not expose my innate double Element, I should still do a disguise. On one hand, it\u2019s so people won\u2019t recognize me. On the other hand, I would look more mature. I am still too much of a high schooler!_ After Mo Fan made his decision, he quickly found a black crayon.Changing his appearance wasn\u2019t hard. Mo Fan just needed to dye his face darker and then put on a long, gray hoodie.As long as he put on the hoodie, and showed the distinct jawline of his face, his entire temperament would be entirely different!He found the City Hunter\u2019s Team and saw the long queue standing outside. He couldn\u2019t help but sob a bit._Shit, this even overtakes registration for the officer\u2019s exams!__Let\u2019s just line up. That\u2019s all I can do. Let\u2019s just do the interview first and then go past stage two of it. It seems like the interviewer is a sweet and beautiful woman._\u2014\u201cThey\u2019re all trash. Do these morons thinks we, the City Hunter\u2019s Team, are a job where we just sit on our butts and eat the benefits of the state!?\u201d a tall and sturdy man, who still had gauze wrapped around his head, snarled from behind the recruitment counter.\u201cCaptain, don\u2019t be anxious. There\u2019s a lot of people applying, there will be a good one!\u201d said another man who was wearing a fashionable flower cap.\u201cActually, this one isn\u2019t bad. He has mastered the second level of Wind Trail, Flash Steps. It can be used to track and lure Magical Beasts,\u201d a delicate-looking girl said as she stood behind the sturdy and tall man.\u201cAs long as we have me as the Wind Element, do we still need anyone else?\u201d spoke up a Wind Mage with long hair, looking graceful in his white shirt.\u201cThese are all just considerations. I still haven\u2019t seen anyone I\u2019m completely satisfied with yet,\u201d the gauzed-up Captain said.\u201cIn that case, how about Ah Cheng? This fellow is quite clever. The truth is, the really amazing Mages actually have their own fixed squads. They rarely wander over here. In my point of view, we should just choose Ah Cheng. His Fire abilities should be sufficient enough against a Magical Beast,\u201d the graceful, long-haired Wind Mage spoke up.The Captain helplessly shook his head, \u201cIt seems like this is the only way.\u201dAs he finished saying this, that sweet-looking recruitment girl hastily ran over, her face ramming directly into the Captain\u2019s chest.\u201cA\u2026Ah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The recruitment girl\u2019s cheeks were red as she hastily apologized. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s a Lightning\u2026 a Lightning Mage applying to join our City Hunter\u2019s Team.\u201d\u201cAre you for real??\u201d The tall and sturdy Captain seemed more energized, his eyes beamed as he looked in the direction of the long recruitment line.The other squadmates\u2019 eyes also sparkled.Lightning Mage!Their City Hunter Team was indeed popular, relative to other squads. However, that didn\u2019t mean that Lightning Mages were willing to enlist with them.In the past, Lightning Mages had always been guests among the Hunter Squads. Some of the more Elite squads wouldn\u2019t mind taking in a completely newbie Lightning Mage.You could definitely cultivate newbies. However, an one in a thousand Lightning Mage was extremely hard to find even if you were to turn on a lantern!Too many Lightning Mages had already been reserved, and additionally, they were very easy to absorb into a large Ancient Family or other organizations. The possibility of finding an unattached Lightning Mage was just far too small.\u201cIs that him?\u201d The sturdy Captain was a little impatient, he directly walked out from the back room.\u201cY\u2026yes, Captain. Are you going to personally interview him?\u201d the recruitment girl stuttered.\u201cInterview\u2026 What\u2019s there to interview?\u201d the sturdy Captain turned around, looking puzzled.The recruitment girl, as well as the other teammates, were confused. If the Captain wasn\u2019t going to personally interview him, then why did he run over there?At this moment, you could see the Captain walking to the recruitment desk. He looked at Mo Fan, whose face seemed somewhat dark, before he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re a Lightning Mage?\u201dMo Fan glanced at this tall, sturdy, and ferocious man as he slowly raised his hand. In a split second, an electric arc passed between his fingers before it formed what seemed to be a bug, buzzing as it fell onto the table, before burning a small hole in the table cloth.The sturdy Captain\u2019s face bloomed, he nodded his head excitedly.\u201cYou guys\u2026 no longer need to line up! We have found our person!\u201d The sturdy Captain was also domineering; he directly shouted this out as he looked at the long line.As he shouted that, the long line was not very happy.\u201cShit, why? We still haven\u2019t gone through an interview yet?!\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really strong. I can cast a spell in less than four seconds.\u201d\u201cAre you for real, there are even Magicians going through the back door in recruiting? This world is just too unfair! I don\u2019t want to be in the desolate areas!\u201dThe group of people began voicing their complaints. They had expectations for this position.\u201cIf any of you is also a Lightning Mage, then this Captain will break the rules and recruit you!\u201d shouted the sturdy Captain, maintaining his unreasonable attitude.As everyone heard this, they were stunned.\u201cShit, Lightning?\u201d\u201cAre you for real? A Lightning elementalist ran here and stole our livelihood, how do we even survive now?!\u201d\u201cUgh, a Lightning elementalist, what\u2019s there to interview about? Let\u2019s just go somewhere else.\u201dAs soon as they heard Lightning Element, everyone was like a defeated chicken as they dangled their heads and slunk away.There\u2019s nothing they could do about it. The Lightning Element was the top of the Basic Elements, it had an incomparable advantage. These people no longer had any desire to compete.Mo Fan turned around and saw that the long line immediately disperse. He was a little shocked.Even in school, he knew that the Lightning Element had a particular importance attached to it. However, he never thought that the Lightning Element would possess such a suppressing force in magical society.It made sense when he thought about it. When he was facing the Spirit Wolf, the truly decisive spell was indeed the Lightning Element\u2019s Lightning Strike. Not only was it able to injure the Magical Beast, it was also able to paralyze its muscles!\u201cCome come come, little brother. Welcome to our City Hunter Team, let me introduce you to our members\u2026 Oh, let me first introduce myself. I am the Captain of the City Hunter Team, Xu Dahuang, a Fire Mage,\u201d the sturdy Captain introduced himself.\u201cHello, my name is Xiaoke, I am a Water Mage,\u201d the delicate-looking girl smiled sweetly.\u201cLi Wenjie, Wind Element,\u201d the handsome young man said confidently, as he flung his graceful hair back.\u201cCall me Feishi, I am an Earth elementalist,\u201d the round-faced man with the flower hat said as he smiled widely.Mo Fan looked at these Magicians whose were definitely a few years older than him. He was a bit stunned before he finally introduced himself, \u201cI am Fan Mo.\u201d\u201cFan Mo, from your blank resume, I can tell that you\u2019re a newbie who hasn\u2019t even met a genuine Magical Beast. Thus, I want to remind you of one thing. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re amazing just because you\u2019re a Lightning Mage, be careful of your own life!\u201d spouted a rather beautiful girl.Mo Fan glanced at that young woman, feeling that she was somewhat familiar.\u201cOh, this is my Vice-Captain, Cai Tang, Ice Element!\u201d Captain Xu Dahuang explained with a smile._Cai Tang??__Shit, it\u2019s that girl!_Mo Fan finally recognized this person. This Cai Tang was related to the Mu Family. This girl kept up a princess-like appearance every day, and was hard to interact with!_Shit, how come I meet people from the Mu Family all the time?

We will give you an ID related to the City Hunters Team later,\u201d Captain Xu Dahuang said.\u201cThere\u2019s an ID?\u201d Mo Fan asked, feeling a bit stunned.\u201cOf course!\u201d Feishi explained as he kept smiling, \u201cThis ID has quite a few privileges, you are now equivalent to a enforcement officer within Bo City!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I have now become an honorable enforcement officer?\u201d Mo Fan asked, as he creased his brow.\u201cHahaha, we are precisely City Officers!\u201d Li Wenjie suddenly laughed. Only after he stopped laughing did he continue, \u201cThe only difference is that we don\u2019t deal with those law-breaking peddlers nor profiteers, we deal with the things that emerge at night!\u201dA City Officer of Bo City?Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but smile a little. This position was quite to his own liking; it had a whiff of being Spiderman, The Flash, or Iron Man, a hero that was supposed to save this chaotic city. While at same time, he could be mysterious as he flirted with girls!Mo Fan quickly blended in with the mood. Fei Shi, the older brother who had the most experience, introduced the squad\u2019s current state of affairs as well as their primary responsibilities.\u201cHello\u2026 What, why didn\u2019t you report this to me earlier? What kind of global joke are you making, those police officers are completely useless!\u201d While they were happily discussing things, the Captain Xu Dahuang roared into his phone.Li Wenjie, Xiao Ke, Feishi and the people who were happily talking to Mo Fan suddenly changed expressions as their gaze fixed on Captain Xu Dahuang.At this time, Fei Shi creased his brow as he whispered to the suspicious Mo Fan, \u201cOriginally, we wanted to take you out for some drinks. Who would\u2019ve thought that the second you joined us, we would be assigned work! If we aren\u2019t wrong, then it\u2019s most likely the Cafeteria\u2019s Quaking Door of Mingwen Girl\u2019s Middle School.\u201d\u201cThe Cafeteria\u2019s Quaking Door?\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s eyes widened.He had heard of quaking cars, quaking water, quaking fields, but it was his first time hearing about freaking quaking doors. _You city people sure know how to have fun!_\u201cBrother, you are too wicked\u2026 It\u2019s not what you think it is. Every night, the school\u2019s cafeteria would experience some strange quaking. In the beginning, they thought it was some construction team working in the middle of the night. After that, they dispatched people to check and the report said there was no construction team. Instead, there was a strange story that has been passed down through the Mingwen Girls Middle School,\u201d Fei Shi explained to Mo Fan in a whisper.\u201cDid you say Mingwen Girls Middle School?\u201d Mo Fan suddenly realized something before he inquired further.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a girls-only school, even the teachers\u2026 _tsk, cough_ \u201d Fei Shi returned to being serious.Mo Fan was unable to have sexual fantasies about it. Ye Xinxia was at precisely that girl\u2019s school. Thinking back on it, roughly two months ago when he was on phone with Ye Xinxia, she had told him that her cafeteria was really scary.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s make use of the time when the students aren\u2019t studying to immediately resolve the issue!\u201d Captain Xu Dahuang said.Putting down the phone in his hand, Xu Dahuang\u2019s face was no longer smiling.Li Wenjie, Xiao Ke, Guo Caitang, and Feishi; all four people\u2019s eyes were all fixed on their captain.\u201cThere has been an accident. A second girl has gone missing,\u201d Xu Dahuang said with a calm voice.Everyone\u2019s brows creased.A few months earlier, there was a girl who went missing at Mingwen Girls Middle School. Due to the school being unable to determine whether the girl had disappeared on the school grounds, this matter had been handled by the police. After a few months, there still hadn\u2019t been a single clue.This matter had been in the morning newspapers, but everyone was quick to forget. The city had millions of people, and someone disappearing was not something strange to the police at all.Xu Dahuang and his team had made a trip to the Mingwen Girls Middle School once before. The school, however, didn\u2019t want to make this into a big ordeal. Thus, they didn\u2019t want to let the City Hunters do anything, leaving the matter completely unsettled. Who would\u2019ve known that half a year later, there\u2019d be yet another girl gone missing. This time, she had actually gone missing within the school grounds.The school finally realized that this was a big problem, and they urgently got in contact with the City Hunter Team.\u201cCaptain, if someone were to go missing, shouldn\u2019t they still just contact the police?\u201d Xiao Ke opened her mouth to ask.\u201cA Light Mage found some footprints that didn\u2019t belong to humans.\u201d Xu Dahuang said solemnly.Everyone else immediately turned silent, except for Li Wenjie, who seemed to be bursting with life. It was evident that he felt happy about having work to do.\u201cThey contacted us a week after it happened; they really are a group of morons. If they had contacted us immediately, then perhaps we could have found the missing girl. Now that it has been this long, that girl is definitely gone!\u201d\u201cSome schools are like that. Everyone wants to hide the bad things, but once they realize they cannot hide it, that\u2019s when they know it\u2019s a real problem!\u201d Guo Caitang said coldly.As Mo Fan heard everyone talking, his heart began to beat harshly.Missing for a month?Ye Xinxia hadn\u2019t contacted him for a whole week!Due to him not having the money to buy a mobile, Mo Fan had always used the old telephone booth to call Ye Xinxia\u2019s mobile. He would talk to her at least once a week.He had just returned from Practicals and his heart was filled with how to increase his own strength. Thus, he forgot to check in with Ye Xinxia!Aunt Mo Qing\u2019s house was near Mingwen Girls Middle School. Even during summer break, Ye Xinxia would spend the majority of her time immersed within the school\u2019s library, since it was extremely inconvenient for her to walk to begin with\u2026As Mo Fan thought more about it, his heart grew increasingly more panicked. He urgently borrowed a phone from Fei Shi.\u201c _The number you have called is unavailable_.\u201dMo Fan\u2019s heart jumped.\u201cI will reunite with you guys in a bit!\u201d Not saying anything further, Mo Fan dashed out of the Hall of the Hunter\u2019s Union.\u201cHey, wait! In any case, take my phone with you, this way we can contact you easier!\u201d Fei Shi yelled toward Mo Fan.As he yelled out, Fei Shi tossed his phone toward the running Mo Fan.\u201cBrother, isn\u2019t it a bit dangerous when you throw your phone like that? What if that kid didn\u2019t catch it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that\u2019s a Nokia. It won\u2019t break.\u201d\u201cBrother, I meant as in what if you crushed him to death!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, why does your face suddenly look so bad?\u201d\u201cThe gods know, no matter what, we should start doing our work.\u201d___________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this moment, he really wished he had a movement spell so he could quickly arrive at Mingwen Girls Middle School.Sitting in the slow taxi, he finally arrived at Aunt Mo Qing\u2019s house.As he dashed into his aunt\u2019s house, Mo Fan almost crashed into a girl in a wheelchair as he turned a corner.\u201cBrother Mo Fan!\u201d Ye Xinxia smiled sweetly, she was astonished and delighted that he was there.\u201cXinxia, you\u2019re okay! You scared the living hell out of me.\u201d When Mo Fan finally saw Ye Xinxia\u2019s smile, his heart immediately calmed down.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWhy was your phone turned off when I called you?\u201d\u201cPayment was due, I wasn\u2019t willing to pay.\u201d Ye Xinxia lowered her head as she answered, feeling embarrassed.\u201c\u2026\u201dAlright, the girl only wanted to save a little money.Either way, as long as she was okay, it was good. Mo Fan loosened up.\u201cDid the Practicals go smoothly?\u201d Ye Xinxia handed a rolled handkerchief to Mo Fan.Nowadays, girls who carried a handkerchief were far too few. It\u2019s not that Xinxia was immersed in literature, but it was because carrying one would save money.Mo Fan wiped his sweat as he also smelled the fragrance on the handkerchief. _Hmm, there\u2019s still that alluring body fragrance. The ones I stole before have lost their fragrance\u2026eh, I almost exposed my vulgar actions._\u201cI heard that there are missing girls from your school?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cMhm.\u201d Ye Xinxia urgently nodded several times. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary this time, Aunt won\u2019t even let me go to school.\u201d\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a girl from my next door class, her name is Lin Yun\u2019er. The day she disappeared, I was also in the library, she even told me that she was going back to the dormitory. However, after that, I never saw her again. None of the cameras in school saw her leaving the school, either\u2026\u201d Ye Xinxia said in a low voice.Seeing her turning pale at recalling this, Mo Fan lightly patted her shoulder.\u201cIn this case, you\u2019re the last person to see her?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cYeah, the police have already asked me numerous times, but that is all I know. However\u2026\u201d Ye Xinxia lowered her head.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cAfter leaving the library, I smelled something strange. This smell was similar to the rancid odor that is emitted from a certain place in the school cafeteria. However, our library is far from the cafeteria, and at that time, I felt a strange chill. It was like\u2026 something was staring at me. I was really scared, so I hurriedly left that place,\u201d Ye Xinxia said.Mo Fan\u2019s brow creased. Apparently, she had already been extremely close to danger!\u201cBrother Mo Fan, if I didn\u2019t leave that early\u2026\u201d Ye Xinxia was clearly at a loss.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a good thing that you left early, or else you could possibly have become the missing girl!\u201d Mo Fan was glad inside.Ye Xinxia shook her head as she used a voice that only she seemed to be able to hear to blame herself, \u201cI reckon that scary thing\u2019s initial objective was me. Since I hurriedly left the place, it turned its attention toward the person next to me, Li Yun\u2019er. I\u2026I should\u2019ve gone to find Lin Yun\u2019er and had her leave the school with me.\u201dAs Mo Fan heard Ye Xinxia blaming herself, he was momentarily speechless._This brat, just what is she thinking in her head\u2026_If she hadn\u2019t left early, then it was possible that there would be two missing people. If the school really had something that shouldn\u2019t be there, then neither of the two girls had the strength to defend themselves.\u201cHow can this be blamed on you? Even if you had told Lin Yun\u2019er, she would have just thought you were too paranoid. Your five senses have always been more sharp than others since you were young; however, you are unable to move freely. Being able to protect yourself is already an impressive matter,\u201d Mo Fan conforted her in a soft voice.\u201cBrother Mo Fan, do you think Lin Yun\u2019er has already\u2026\u201d\u201cMost likely\u2026 Oh, no. Definitely not. I\u2019m now working for the City Hunter Team, we will solve this problem. How could I let my cute Xinxia stay in such a dangerous school!\u201d Mo Fan said as he clapped his chest.The words came from Mo Fan\u2019s heart.With such a thing happening inside the Mingwen Girls Middle School, even if he wasn\u2019t a part of the City Hunter Team, he\u2019d still rush over. Ye Xinxia had already lost something very important to her growing up. No matter what happened, Mo Fan would not allow his wheelchair-bound sister suffer even more things.She was pure, beautiful, and kind. When he was young, he\u2019d often hide in Ye Xinxia\u2019s home after having fights with other kids from the area because he was scared of his dad\u2019s scolding. Ye Xinxia would carefully clean and wrap his cuts and bruises for him. She even lied to them for his sake\u2026Ever since then, Mo Fan made a vow to himself that he would definitely take good care of her, and not allow her to suffer anything.\u201cFor the next few days, stay home. Wait until I finish dealing with the perpetrator?\u2026\u201d Mo Fan patted Ye Xinxia\u2019s head.\u201cMmm!\u201d Ye Xinxia nodded her head sweetly.After learning that Mo Fan was a Lightning Mage, Ye Xinxia began to feel safer. Moreover, she could also feel her Brother Fan was becoming stronger and stronger.He went from a common youth to a Magician, and was now a member of the City Hunter Team! He changed practically every time she saw him! She guessed that during the time she hadn\u2019t seen him, he had done his very best to improve.\u201cBrother Mo Fan, did you get exposed to the sun when you were in Practicals?\u201d\u201cNot at all, why do you ask that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so black that I can barely recognize you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014After leaving his aunt\u2019s home, Mo Fan headed for Mingwen Girls Middle School._Shit, a city and a school actually had such a scary thing happening; developing the flowers of this country in this kind of environment. The teachers may be able to endure it, but this uncle won\u2019t!__The beautiful girls of Mingwen Girls Middle School, do not be flustered, do not be afraid. Your prince on a black horse has come to rescue you from this chaos!__Bang!_As he kicked the elegant gate of the school open, Mo Fan was feeling ready to enjoy the admiration and attention from thousands of girls in their short, white skirts. Who would\u2019ve thought that as he looked in, the entire campus was completely empty. A few homeless cats on the flowerbed stretched their heads out as they used their disdainful gazes to look at the intruder by the gate; it looked as though they were saying, \u201cWhere\u2019d this retard come from, you scared the crap out of this daddy!\u201d_Oh, ohhh. I forgot this is the summer break, the girls aren\u2019t here._\u201cEn? You got here before me.\u201d Not long after, a woman\u2019s voice came from behind him.Mo Fan turned around, and discovered it was that extremely arrogant Guo Caitang.Other than this girl having a plump chest and slender legs, her entire body emitted the temperament of an evil woman.________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She said she smelled a rotten odor also found in the cafeteria. I have basically determined that the cafeteria either has a panty-stealing pervert or a Magical Beast.\u201d Mo Fan pushed back his glasses in a move that exuded wisdom, _How did Detective Conan put it\u2026 Oh right, there is only one truth!_\u201cIs that so. Then tonight, you\u2019ll keep watch over the cafeteria. The rest of us will go to the teaching blocks, the Mingwen Mountain Park, dormitory, and the school field,\u201d Guo Caitang replied, appearing somewhat arrogant.\u201cThat\u2026 why am I not keeping watch over the dormitories? I heard that there are a few students who stayed behind. Why don\u2019t you let me take care of their safety\u2026\u201d Mo Fan said.\u201cJust Feishi being there is enough.\u201dMo Fan felt a headache coming on. Feishi looked like a weird uncle that would steal girl\u2019s underwear. Having him keeping watch over the dormitories would result in the girls being in even more danger!\u2014\u2014That evening, Mo Fan really was assigned to watch over the cafeteria.The cafeteria of Mingwen Girls Middle School was immensely large, looking like a huge meeting hall. As this place could be considered an aristocratic school, a cafeteria this luxurious and spacious was well within reason. Unlike the cafeteria of Tian Lan Magic High; if you wanted to hide something there, then you\u2019d be swept out by the aunties at the cafeteria.The dark cafeteria only had a few spots illuminated by the lights in the distance, the chairs and tables were neatly arranged. Mo Fan was squatting in a corner daydreaming about the scene of young girls wearing their short skirts in summer, the sweet fragrances overflowing in the endless radiance of the springtime\u2026_Boom!__Booom!!!__Boom! Boom! Boom!_The noise came from nowhere.A lone spoon which was forgotten on a table was swaying and trembling as it slowly moved toward the edge of the table.As the spoon fell off the table, it hit Mo Fan\u2019s head. Mo Fan quickly grabbed the little spoon that had nearly exposed his location._What the Hell, who would be so bored as to leave behind their spoon after having an ice cream in the middle of the night, it almost exposed my location\u2026__This cafeteria is really weird. Just what is the source of this trembling, it feels like there\u2019s a construction team beneath me. Could it be that they\u2019re building a prison basement? Lately, that kind of thing has been quite popular all across the country,_ Mo Fan stealthily stretched his head out as he looked around._Grrrroowlll\u2026._Suddenly, an extremely strange, deep noise came from the back of the kitchen in the cafeteria.Following the noise, Mo Fan immediately smelled the rancid odor of rotten food. It was some chives, fishy-smelling meat, and salted vegetables._Shit, there really is a Magical Beast?_ Mo Fan tensed up.Before he joined the City Hunter Team, Mo Fan had always thought that the city was a very tranquil and safe world. He thought Magical Beasts were just something the adults made up just to scare kids who refused to go to sleep. Who would\u2019ve thought that the city actually had some Magical Beasts hidden away; what aunt Mo Qing said before was not necessarily fake!Thinking back on it, it made sense. The city was so big, there were too many unknown places. If a Magical Beast really were to appear, and there were human lives involved, the police would still prevent the information from being leaked out and then proceed to resolve the matter in private. The effect of people panicking was far worse than the things that were happening.Mo Fan grabbed a communication device, pressing down on it in his pocket.This communication device was simple. It would notify his team members of his location and let them know that he had a situation.The sound of a stomach growling resounded.As he pressed the communication device, the thing that was behind the cafeteria kitchen acted as though it could feel the signal. A set of deep blue eyes oddly emerged behind the kitchen glass as they directly locked onto the person who let out the signal.Its pupils were as big as a basketball, and the meat tissues around the eyes writhed as it turned around, raising goosebumps on his skin.With the help of the reflection, Mo Fan was able to roughly see a silhouette._That\u2019s a neck-?_The neck was as big as a tree, it was hard to distinguish whether it was a neck or a head. In short, in the place where there should be a head was an eye as large as a basketball, and a mouth that was filled with rotten food._Shit, are these Magical Beasts equipped with a signal receiver? It could even sense when I sent a signal!_ , Mo Fan cursed to himself.As soon as he sent a signal, the big-eyed neck monster immediately locked onto him. Not even those aliens in Hollywood had an amazing ability like that!_Gugu!_Suddenly, the big-eyed neck monster\u2019s pupil looked as though it had condensed, he could see that its basketball-sized pupil was compressing.As the building energy reached its maximum output, a red ray shot out from the monster\u2019s pupil!The red ray pierced through the glass window that separated the students and the canteen aunties, before piercing through the row of dining tables straight toward Mo Fan\u2019s location!Mo Fan nearly peed his pants._This thing doesn\u2019t even greet me before attacking me! Its cold expression is like a cafeteria lady\u2019s annihilating gaze when you hope she will give you a bit more meat\u2026_Fortunately, it was not Mo Fan\u2019s first time dealing with a Magical Beast. Relying on his reflexes, he tumbled toward the cafeteria\u2019s exit.In the next second, Mo Fan\u2019s hiding place was turned into a scorched black hole. If he hadn\u2019t rolled away, then that hole would\u2019ve been his chest!As their Stardusts grew stronger, they would also change a Magician\u2019s physique. Although these changes weren\u2019t extremely evident, they were good enough for a Magician to dodge very evident attacks.Mo Fan was also very clever. He had chosen a location near the exit from the beginning, and thus he was able to successfully leave the cafeteria with just that tumble and roll.However, everything was not as simple as Mo Fan thought it would be. The large-eyed neck monster let out a screeching noise as it rushed out of the back of the cafeteria. Its massive eyes was once again condensing a red light.Mo Fan glanced behind him and felt increasingly shocked._This thing\u2019s attack frequency is too high, I can no longer dodge it!_Mo Fan began to use his intent to activate the Magical Equipment imprint within his soul so he could call out the Bone Scythe Shield to shield him.As Mo Fan was about to finish it, a clear voice called out from the distant basketball court. \u201cWater Field, Dissolve!\u201dFollowing this, Mo Fan saw a stream of water forming in the air. This stream of water was as soft as a ribbon as it floated in front of him. However, it quickly formed into a concave shield.After the red ray hit the water shield, it was completely neutralized. The red energy was immediately dispersed into countless droplets that sprinkled over Mo Fan\u2019s feet.Mo Fan immediately cancelled the activation of the Bone Scythe Shield. He turned his head around just in time to see the girl called Xiao Ke smiling sweetly toward him as she revealed two cute canine teeth._Xiao Ke? Lady, your timing is too good!_____________________Translator : TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leave this animal to me!\u201d Captain Xu Dahuang shouted as he and Fei Shi both arrived in time.The two looked as though they were on a flat escalator. They didn\u2019t take a single step, yet they were moving rapidly along the flat ground.Mo Fan knew that this was the primary spell of the Earth Element, Earth Ripple!Earth Ripple was also a movement spell, it could control the surface of the ground to initiate quick movement. Wang Sanpang was also capable of this. However, he was not as adept at it as Feishi.\u201cThis is a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat, they usually live underground. Thus, they\u2019re experts in digging holes and particularly enjoy the city sewers. They can stretch their neck and their eyes can release a piercing red light beam\u2026 This thing is like a mixed rat, capable of high speed reproduction. Their survival abilities are high. The sewers and garbage lots tend to have quite a few of them. Normally, they eat human leftovers. However, if their hunger reaches a certain degree, they are able to eat humans as well, making them a terrifying and common Magical Beast!\u201d Soon enough, Vice Captain Guo Caitang informed everyone about this creature._(Ed. Note: Ah, comic book combat time. Look at that paragraph. And he said all that in the middle of an attacking giant rat!)_Colossal-eyed Ape Rat?The Magical Beast classes had discussed this creature a few times; this creature was an expert at living underground and hole-digging! It was the Lan Xiang University amongst Magical Beasts!Normally, whenever this kind of Magical Beast encountered a Magician, they would run away peeing themselves. How come this one dared to even initiate attacks!?\u201cThis one is evidently extremely rash. I reckon it\u2019s starving; requiring a large amount of food and energy. Fortunately, we happened to find it!\u201d Feishi said as he smiled.These people were different from the group of students who ran like dogs when they first encountered Magical Beasts. Whether it was the Captain Xu Dahuang, the girl Xiao Ke, Wind Mage Guo Caitang or Uncle Feishi, they wore a different attitude when they faced off against the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat.They were all spread out, but they stood at a distance where they could support each other.They formed an attack formation, while maintaining a distance where they could retreat if they encountered danger.Mo Fan, who had just joined their team as a member, was awkwardly standing there. It looked as though he had told his teammates, \u201cAfter you retreat, I will challenge this creature.\u201d However, the truth was, he was slowly shifting behind his teammates; on the inside, he was cursing Fei Shi for not using Earth Ripple on him.The sound of an empty stomach grumbled out.This Colossal-eyed Ape Rat was indeed extremely vicious, as it didn\u2019t run away despite seeing so many people. Its eyes immediately locked onto the closest person to itself; the Wind Mage, Li Wenjie.It was the red light beam! This animal that lived amongst the human city\u2019s dark corner looked as though it wanted to shoot through the people moving around it presently. Its intense roaring was particularly fierce in the air of the evening school campus.\u201cYou want to attack us?\u201d The Wind Mage Li Wenjie was laid back.Mo Fan practically didn\u2019t see Li Wenjie meticulously focus his mind to link the Star Paths, yet a cyan Wind Track emerged around his body, blowing around his white shirt._Swoosh!_The red piercing beam shot forth, but Li Wenjie left behind only a wild breeze at his former location. His figure had already flashed five meters away. How could one be that handsome?\u201cFool, you dare to come out and harm people with just this little skill?!\u201d Li Wenjie stood in front of a table tennis stand as he coldly smiled toward the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat.When the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat saw its beam was ineffective toward this nimble human, it flew into a rage as it spread its four sharp limbs.With a neck and head that strange, the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat\u2019s speed was actually a few times faster than the Spirit Wolf which Mo Fan had met before. If it used this speed to go against students, even if they were able to stay calm and complete their Star Path, they would still be too late casting their spells!The time it took for students to cast their spells was around four seconds, whereas the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat was able to get to Li Wenjie from a place forty meters away in a short two seconds. Its claws ripped right for Li Wenjie\u2019s face.Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but feel apprehensive; he was scared Li Wenjie would lose his life.Looking at his surroundings, neither the Water Mage, Xiao Ke, nor the Earth Mage, Fei Shi, seemed to have any intention on saving Li Wenjie.\u201cWind Track, Flash Steps!\u201d Li Wenjie was not flustered at all. His gaze was calmly watching the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat dash over as he coldly spouted the name of his spell._Swoosh!_Li Wenjie\u2019s body once again disappeared from his original location. The Colossal-eyed Ape Rat\u2019s claws smacked against the stone table tennis stand, reducing the table to powder that flew off into the surroundings.After the creature realized that its claw had failed, it immediately began to look for Li Wenjie._Swoosh!_Li Wenjie\u2019s took another step, he once again left behind a dust trail before he quickly flashed twenty meters away._Swoosh!!_Li Wenjie stopped behind a cotton tree planted inside the cantina. To Mo Fan\u2019s surprise, the Wind Mage had once again disappeared from his sight.Following this, a red beam fiercely hit the cotton tree Li Wenjie had stopped behind. The cotton tree was pierced straight through by the beam, leaving behind a blackened hole. Ash blew out of the hole from the superheated steam and charred wood, drifting down in a cloud of dark motes.Wind Track, Flash Step!Mo Fan saw this as he gasped in surprise.In school, all the Wind elemental students had only grasped the Wind Track\u2019s Swift Travel. To move fast with Swift Travel was only possible if you were able to create a Wind Tunnel. Although it was indeed quick, it was still not as fast as Li Wenjie\u2019s Flash Step!If Zhang Xiaohou had grasped Wind Track\u2019s Flash Steps back then, he would definitely have been able to thrash that Spirit Wolf around a few times, and get out of the difficult situation of being chased deep within the cavern.Although it was also a primary spell of the Wind Track, its effect felt evidently on a different level. The Colossal-eyed Ape Rat\u2019s sensitivity was even above that of Spirit Wolf. However, at the end of the day it still wasn\u2019t able to touch the corner of Li Wenjie\u2019s clothes.As expected, the things you learned at school were far too limited. Only when you were exposed to this kind of environment and constantly gaining practical combat experience would you truly be able to raise your strength._It was a wise choice to join the Hunters, only when I follow these Hunter Mages who are fearless in front of the Magical Beasts will I be able to grow. Going with those students who pee their pants when they see a Magical Beast is definitely a bad choice._It wasn\u2019t that Mo Fan disliked his classmates, but he had come to realize many things after battling against the Spirit Wolf.Pursuing examinations, grades, target shootings, attending Magical Beast classes, and analyzing battle techniques were completely useless when you actually encountered a Magical Beast. The only way to improve was to fight, to constantly face Magical Beasts like this.\u201cHave a taste of my flames!\u201dCaptain Xu Dahuang flew up confidently. There was already a ball of scorching hot flame in his palm. The flames illuminated the sturdy uncle\u2019s face, which carried some disdain for the creature before him!_____________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had some keen senses to detect the speedy attack by Xu DaHuang\u2026It was obviously going to miss. Monsters wouldn\u2019t stand there like a dummy in school, waiting to be attacked.\u201cHiding? Futile!\u201d Xu DaHuang laughed in mockery.The fireball landed where the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat first stood, missing it completely.\u201cBurst!\u201d he chanted the twist to the technique.In that instant, a ray of light emerged from the extinguishing fireball as it burst open!!_Boom\u2026!_The cloud of fire exploded, waves of fire quickly swallowed everything around the point of impact._Crimson fires!!_The crimson flames engulfed everything in a three-meter radius, including the Rat which thought it had evaded the attack.A tremor appeared in the air, the explosion was blinding!!Through the flames, Mo Fan could faintly see the Colossal-Eyed Rat get swallowed up in crimson. Its fat bulk was thrown five, six meters away, slamming head-first into the canteen walls.Cornered, the Colossal-Eyed Rat thrashed for its life, now stripped of that monstrous air. Now, it was just a half-dead sewer rat.At this, Mo Fan\u2019s lips stretched into a giant \u201cO\u201d!_Unbelievable!_Fire Burst, Burst!!That overbearing burst effect left no chance for that agile Big-Eyed Rat. The burn and cremation effects paled in comparison to that direct and violent burst effect!Mo Fan never would have thought that the squad leader of the Hunting squad had trained the Fire Burst technique to the third level. The burst effect nearly killed the Rat instantly.Man, if he had known Burst during the Spirit Wolf encounter, he could have ended it in a single blast. Would he have needed to run, needed those stalagmites? If those stalagmites weren\u2019t everywhere, and the monster positioned directly underneath one\u2026 Last time, he was lucky._Unbelievably cool!_At this point, Mo Fan\u2019s heart toiled like the raging waves of fire.Thinking about how his fireball could reach this level, his passion for training blazed.As long as he could master Burst, that Yu Ao wouldn\u2019t be his match, that old geezer Mu Zhuoyun could be smacked so hard that his face would swell up!_Yes, no matter what, I have to reach the third level in Fire Burst before I graduate, and blind the titanium dog eyes of those old geezers in the Mu Family!_The experience and skill of the Hunting Squad was apparent when they predicted that the Rat would run after the blast. Fei Shi and Guo Caitang sealed the escape routes of the Rat using their techniques.\u201cKu\u2026!!!!\u201d the Big-Eyed Rat roared, and leapt unexpectedly towards Guo Caitang.Guo Caitang paused, her Ice Vine technique froze the spot where the Rat had just fled. She did not anticipate that the Rat could still thrash so violently.\u201cXiao Ke, Water Meld, now!\u201d Squad Leader Xu DaHuang tensed at this sight.Xiao Ke panicked, frantically linking the Water Star Path. Too nervous, Xiao Ke slowed down and couldn\u2019t cast Water Meld in time.While Guo Caitang, having faced dangers like this before, grit her teeth and leapt to the side.Although she couldn\u2019t dodge it completely, as long as she could save her vitals, losing an arm was better than dying.\u201cLightning Seal, Python Mark!!\u201dMultiple seals swarmed in the distance just as the situation turned for the worse.These seals flogged the Colossal-Eyed Rat and flayed its flesh. The Python marks on the Rat drilled frantically into its muscles, leaving it unable to run.Halfway through its dash, the Rat seized up and slumped to the concrete, rolling to a stop before Guo Caitang\u2019s legs.Guo CaiTang paused as she saw the twitching Rat, before jumping back a few meters away. She stared in disbelief at Mo Fan.\u201cGood Job, Fan Mo!\u201d\u201cMan, this Colossal-Eyed Rat has to be mutated, why is it more violent than a One-Eyed Wolf? Half-dead and it is still attacking rather than running!\u201d Fei Shi exclaimed, still shocked from the ordeal.\u201cI\u2019ve told you so many times, be on your guard, be on your guard!! Guo Caitang almost died\u2026 If not for the Lightning Mage we recruited today, would the monster be paralyzed? How else do we stop the Rat from staking it all?\u201d Squad Leader Xu DaHuang burst into a tirade.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s my\u2026my fault,\u201d Xiao Ke stammered.\u201cApologies wouldn\u2019t help if someone died, they can\u2019t hear it in their graves! As the only Water Mage in the team with defense capabilities, your job is to be on your guard! Be ready with your Star Path at all times!\u201d Xu DaHuang bellowed at Xiao Ke.Mo Fan was slightly surprised, he had expected Captain Xu DaHuang to just nag instead of lashing out at such a cute girl.However, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Magicians of different Elements had different roles to play when forming a Hunting team. A single mistake in a strategy was not only lethal, but would spell disaster for the entire team. Monsters killed in an instant!Xiao Ke bit her lip and said nothing, having realized the severity of her mistake.Guo Caitang did not blame Xiao Ke, instead, she continued to stare at Mo Fan.She was about to die, but this greenhorn had saved her life!_____________________Translator : TofuEditor : RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your spellcasting speed also shocked us. We thought you were the type of newly graduated Magician whose legs would soften up after seeing a Magical Beast.\u201d Li Wenjie walked up to Mo Fan and patted his shoulder a few times.\u201cYeah, I thought we would have to take care of you for the most of the year before you would be somewhat useful; who would\u2019ve thought that your spirit quality was already good enough that you even saved Guo Caitang. Guo Caitang, you\u2019ll have to devote your entire life to him to properly express your appreciation,\u201d Fei Shi said with a laugh.Mo Fan had applied for this position without any practical experience, nor resume. In fact, the Hunter Team\u2019s minimum requirement was to have killed at least ten Magical Beasts. If Mo Fan were of a different Element, then this elite Team of Hunters would definitely not have accepted him. They didn\u2019t even need those with the Fire Element. After all, the City Hunter Team fought off Magical Beasts within the city. If other hunters couldn\u2019t face off against a Magical Beast, then they would just die by themselves. If the Hunters Team couldn\u2019t face off against Magical Beasts, then it was possible that the consequences would spread to people who couldn\u2019t fend off the Beasts themselves.The City Hunters Team\u2019s responsibilities were significant, and thus, its members needed to be the elite of the Hunter Mages.Considering the rarity of a Lightning Mage, as well as the abilities of their spells, the Hunter Team was willing to spend half a year to properly nurture the rookie who knew nothing. In everyone\u2019s eyes, Mo Fan was a definite rookie who wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to cast a spell when faced up against a Magical Beast.Just now, after he had finished his Lightning Strike spell in an instant, his reaction time and control of his Star Path actually gave the Hunter Team a whole new view of him!Especially Guo Caitang. In the beginning, she had aggressively given Mo Fan, a rookie, a harsh scolding. Who would\u2019ve thought that at the most crucial time, it would be this rookie that would save her life? Her heart was exceedingly complicated at this moment.\u201cAlright, Li Wenjie, Feishi, the two of you go and inspect the cafeteria. If there is no other Magical Beast, then we can leave the rest of the matter to the police if that girl is still alive,\u201d Xu Dahuang ordered.\u201cOK!\u201dSearch and rescue required a large number of people. The Hunter Team\u2019s primary objective was to eliminate the danger factors. Following that, all they needed to do was to let Feishi and Li Wenjie assist the police in searching for the missing Lin Yun\u2019er.It was just that it had been over a week, and the girl\u2019s chances of survival were very low._Buzz\u2026_As Mo Fan was about to leave, the Little Loach Pendant suddenly let out a buzz._There\u2019s a Soul Remnant?_Mo Fan was delighted as he hurriedly walked over to the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat\u2019s body.A blue radiance emerged out of the carcass of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat. It looked similar to a firefly. It was as small as a candle flame, and acted like it was being summoned as it slowly floated into the pendant around Mo Fan\u2019s neck.The others were busy with other things, and thus they didn\u2019t notice this scene. Mo Fan successfully absorbed the Soul Remnant of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat into his Little Loach Pendant.The Little Loach Pendant had an ability that allowed it to automatically absorb Soul Remnants. When he had killed the Spirit Wolf, it had also absorbed the Spirit Wolf\u2019s Soul Remnant._(Ed. Note: No, I don\u2019t remember that happening, either\u2026)_Unfortunately, to make the Little Loach Pendant really grow required something even more pure than a Soul Remnant, which would be a Soul Essence. _Who knows if absorbing these Soul Remnants will have any effect whatsoever, I\u2019ll have to go back home and do some research on it._Moreover, the Magic Association and Hunter\u2019s Union also sold Soul Remnants. The price of one was roughly around ten thousand RMB. If it absorbed enough Soul Remnants, then the Little Loach Pendant would also grow. _In that case, is there a need to use the money from hunting Magical Beasts to buy those Soul Remnants? Either way, the top priority is to make the Little Loach Pendant grow; this way, my Fire Burst will definitely reach the level of Rupture!__Hmm? The Lightning stars seem to have transformed some. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026_ Suddenly, Mo Fan felt the stars within his Lightning Stardust tingling excitedly.The excitement here was similar to the time his Fire stars had transformed. The change that time had allowed Mo Fan to reach the level of Fire Burst\u2019s Burning Bones, up from merely Scorch!That is to say, his Lightning Strike was about to make a breakthrough!In the past, when he was meditating, the Lightning stars had no reaction whatsoever. Who would\u2019ve thought that the lightning quick spellcasting today would actually cause them to transform? Mo Fan didn\u2019t know if they had transformed because of the experience from the battle he had today, or if it was due to the absorption of the Soul Remnant._Fire Burst has already achieved Burning Bones. I wonder what kind of effects the heaven-defying Lightning Strike will cause at its second level? It really makes me look forward to it!_\u2014What Mo Fan did not expect was that he would actually obtain a commission from his first completed mission.The school had used 200,000 yuan to ask the City Hunter Team to come there and solve the issue. Mo Fan received 10% of it; after all, he had just joined them. Normally speaking, those who had just joined would only receive the wages of an intern. The commission was given as a token; they considered Mo Fan a special Lightning Mage, as well as his outstanding display today. The team basically gave Mo Fan a full share.10% was around 20,000 RMB. This was on par with six months of his father\u2019s income.Mo Fan didn\u2019t want to play around with this money. He cautiously put it away, as he did not need it for a period of time.Speaking of which, this was Mo Fan\u2019s first time being paid for work. Although it was indeed dangerous, the reward had actually exceeded Mo Fan\u2019s expectations. This was much more than the hunters outside of the city earned; no wonder why so many of them would do their best to join the ranks of the City Hunter Team!\u2014\u2014_The Mu Family Manor\u2026_The sky-blue private pool had a gentle ripple. Mu He, wearing a swimming cap, had swum up on shore. With his body still wet from his swim, he laid down on the recliner with an umbrella shielding him from the sun. He then looked at the private swimming teacher with rye-colored skin as he not-so-accidentally swept his gaze across her chest._Creak, creak, creak\u2026_As Mu He was about to say something, he discovered the swimming pool had a layer of frost slowly growing across it. The surface of the swimming pool quickly solidified.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m going to swim again soon\u2026\u201d Mu He felt a headache coming on. Before he could finish, the entire swimming pool had already been frozen as solid as if it were winter. He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cUncle He, my father wants you to come over,\u201d a tall, slender man with a gloomy look said to him.\u201cYu Ang, your Ice Stardust has gotten increasingly strong, how has your training been?\u201d Mu He asked with a pleased expression.\u201cThe progress is a bit slow,\u201d the youth called Yu Ang replied.\u201cYou still call that slow\u2026\u201d Mu He said with a forced smile, \u201cOther people are only at the first level of Ice Spread, yet, you have already grasped Ice Spread: Condense. With your cultivation speed, you won\u2019t even need two years to attain the third form of Ice Spread, Cover! That is a large-scale Ice Spread, let\u2019s not even talk about a small Fire elemental student, you could even freeze a whole lot of them by yourself!\u201d\u201cTwo years? That\u2019s still too long,\u201d Yu Ang mumbled to himself.\u201cYou\u2019re always so dissatisfied with your cultivation. The truth is, you\u2019re already far more outstanding than other peers your age. Yes, you and that child Mu Ningxue have a definite difference; however, Mu Ningxue is just too special. You should already know that your father, Mu Zhuoyun, has been brooding over that kid Mo Fan. After a year, when you\u2019ve successfully dealt with that kid, then your father will definitely give you an amazing present,\u201d Mu He laughed.\u201cI haven\u2019t even put that little clown in my eyes at all,\u201d Yu Ang stated.____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if his father, Mu Zhuoyun, had arranged a Magic Duel for him a year from now, Yu Ang genuinely did not put this matter in his heart.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head over, I\u2019ll be right there with you,\u201d Mu He told him.Yu Ang nodded as he walked toward the Master\u2019s house.After going through an artificial garden, Yu Ang stepped into an unusual little courtyard.In a European-styled Mansion like this, having an antique tea house was extremely strange.\u201cFather, I don\u2019t understand why you have arranged a boring duel for me.\u201d Yu Ang sat down to one side as he addressed Mu Zhuoyun.\u201cIf we were to only invite high-class people, family members, and people of your age to your Coming-of-Age Ceremony, then that would be extremely dreary. The opportunity of gathering the most important and well-known people of Bo City into a single place is quite difficult. If there is a duel during your Coming-of-Age Ceremony, then I\u2019m sure a lot of people would have a more positive opinion of you. There are certain matters which the older generation like me just cannot interfere with; thus, you need to use your own superior strength to subdue the seniors and peers watching you; this way, you will also gain prestige. Having that will assist you greatly when you control the city later on.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun sipped his tea as he talked about his plans.\u201cThen you should arrange a more suitable opponent for me,\u201d Yu Ang replied.\u201cIn the beginning, I also thought that having a small character like that would be a child\u2019s play for you during your Coming-of-Age Ceremony, so I was also considering about whether I should\u2019ve arranged for someone more appropriate. However, it doesn\u2019t seem that way anymore. After all, it\u2019s essentially a battle between me, Deng Kai, and Principal Zhu,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun told him.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yu Ang asked, confused.\u201cYour opponent, Mo Fan, has already grasped the second level of Fire Burst. The progress of his cultivation has exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations. Being able to achieve this kind of result in just a short year means he\u2019s not just some minor character. Presently, he is the most outstanding student of Tian Lan Magic High, and he has gained the attention of Deng Kai, Zhan Kong, and Principal Zhu. Now, if I wanted to pull anything on this kid, I believe the others most likely wouldn\u2019t let me do it\u2026 This really caught me by surprise. The cultivation of the son of a driver is actually not any slower than the preeminent disciples of the ancestral families. If he was more discreet, than you wouldn\u2019t have to know anything about the matters between Deng Kai and I,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun explained with a cold smile.\u201cIn that case, there might be some interesting things happening.\u201d Yu Ang looked greatly relieved.If a weak opponent were to appear at his Coming-of-Age Ceremony, then he wouldn\u2019t be earning himself any prestige; instead, it would be giving this scoundrel his spotlight, as well as not being able to demonstrate strength that exceeded his peers.The Mu Family regarded the younger generation\u2019s Coming-of-Age ceremonies as their most important, and it could be said that the Coming-of-Age Ceremony was their grandest ceremony. If their youths were strong, then the family clan was strong; this would allow them to claim power in Bo City at an early age. Having the older generations jumping out and showing off their strength wasn\u2019t always appropriate. If they were to have their younger generation of disciples demonstrate their overwhelming dominance to their peers, wouldn\u2019t that be demonstrating the Mu Family\u2019s absolute power?Mu Ningxue was at the Imperial Capital, which was an even higher domain.Bo City also needed an outstanding young Magician who could carry the banner, right?Yu Ang was an excellent successor for controlling the city. Mu Zhuoyun wanted to meticulously nurture him so that he could stand at the peak of Bo City.Whether the path of the future would be smooth would naturally depend on the beginning. Other disciples\u2019 Coming-of-Age Ceremonies could be arranged in a small manner. However, Yu Ang\u2019s Coming-of-Age Ceremony needed to be grand. It had to have grandeur, it had to have guests, and it had to amaze the world!_That brat Mo Fan does indeed exceed our expectations. However, he is only a stepping stone for the growth of an elite youngster like Yu Ang!_However, would this scheming Mu Zhuoyun tell Yu Ang that he was nurturing the young man with a large amount of resources, so that when he reached a high position and held power, he would be someone else\u2019s stepping stone? That person would be Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s biological daughter, Mu Ningxue!Mu Ningxue was the most perfect successor for Mu Zhuoyun. Since Bo City was too small, his only choice was to nurture another trusted aide so he could properly control Bo City and the native lands of the family.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, after the end of the Coming-of-Age Ceremony, I will open up the Underground Holy Spring of Bo City for you. You will have a week\u2019s worth of cultivation time in there. This one week will be enough to allow your cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds; then your peers in Bo City will no longer be placed in your eyes!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun said calmly.\u201cFather, is that Underground Holy Spring really that magical?\u201d Yu Ang\u2019s eyes glistened as he asked this.\u201cOf course! You know what a Stardust Magic Tool is, right? This Underground Holy Spring is equivalent to a Stardust Magic Tool that reinforces your strength countless times. It doesn\u2019t just simply ease your fatigue, it is also a Holy Ground for the nurturing of your cultivation speed! Whether it is meditation or control, the spring is the most perfect place for it. The Underground Holy Spring isn\u2019t something you can open at will; thus, once you enter, you will have to put your entire mind into cultivation. This is because this could possibly be the best opportunity for you to attack the Intermediate level!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun told him.\u201cInt..Intermediate? Aren\u2019t I still quite a bit far from that??\u201d Yu Ang was a bit startled.\u201cIf you don\u2019t enter the Underground Holy Spring, then you would still be quite far from it. However, if you were to obtain this opportunity, then that would be different,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun said as he stroked his mustache.\u201cFather, just how did this Underground Holy Spring of Bo City come to be? How can it have such an incredible effect?\u201d\u201cThe Underground Holy Spring has a long history, there is no need for you to know it. All you need to remember is that the Underground Holy Spring is an amazing cultivation opportunity that you only get once in your life.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun no longer said anything else.Yu Ang nodded several times in understanding.Assuming that it was able to allow a person to break through the Primary level and tread upon the Intermediate level which so many yearned for, this Underground Holy Spring of Bo City was indeed extremely important!______________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was able to stay even calmer as he cast his spells when faced with a Magical Beast.Advancing his battle experience along with his cultivation, Mo Fan unexpectedly discovered that his Stardust\u2019s growth was even faster.As his Stardust grew, the usable stars were naturally also transforming. On the day he started his third year of high school, Mo Fan had successfully transformed the Lightning stars.They had turned increasingly bright, and the radiating stars were able to conduct increasingly stronger Lightning Magic. Thus, his spells naturally changed as well._Next time when I go out on a mission with the City Hunter Team, they will surely be surprised._ Mo Fan was sitting in class, he felt particularly happy.Currently, his Lightning Strike and Fire Burst had both achieved the second stage. This advancement speed far exceeded his peers. If he was able to reach the third stage by his graduation, then that would be even more perfect!It was said that when one\u2019s stars transformed into the third stage, then one would be rather close to breaking through to Intermediate level Mage.Mo Fan had no idea on when he would reach the Intermediate level. However, he would definitely exhaust all methods to make himself stronger!School life was still just like that. After going through the Practicals, the students\u2019 attitudes had clear transformations. On top of that, the Magic entrance exams were near. In particular, those students who were usually slacking were giving their best as they frequently appeared on the training grounds.Mo Fan himself didn\u2019t go to the training grounds.What was the use of hitting a wooden puppet? He had directly changed these meaningless practices and exercises into real combat, real combat against Magical Beasts! His kind of progress was many times more effective than hitting the wooden puppets at the school training grounds!\u201cBrother Fan, did you realize it? Ever since Practicals, the arrogant Class Representative, Zhoumin has been treating you really well,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou whispered into Mo Fan\u2019s ear.\u201cReally?\u201d Mo Fan asked as he raised his eyebrows.\u201cOf course, sometimes, she will even sneakily glance over here.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because I\u2019m handsome?\u201d\u201cIf you put it like that, then I can\u2019t do anything about it. However, if it was because you\u2019re handsome, then she wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh on you when school began. She is harsh on every single person except when it comes to you, and then her entire person changes; she becomes like a next-door little sister, cute and obedient,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou stated.Presently, Mo Fan went to class in the morning and cultivated in the afternoon. At night, he had to wear a uniform to protect the peace of the city. How could he have time to care about a young girl\u2019s heart? Moreover, he already had a heroic spirit that would save thousands of girls from their suffering, thus, occasionally obtaining a few girls\u2019 affections\u2026 Wasn\u2019t that a common thing?\u201cSee, see. She\u2019s coming over here to find you\u2026 Tsk tsk, Brother Fan, I\u2019ll retreat first.\u201d Zhang Xiaohou was indeed a qualified friend. There were certain friends who were as stupid as pigs, they just loved being a Light Mage!(TL Note: This basically means Lightbulb, which also means a third wheel.)Mo Fan raised his head, and saw that Zhoumin really was coming his way.Seeing her appearance, embarrassed yet excited, it truly made one pity her.Zhoumin looked quite elegant, with squeaky clean black hair over her shoulders, and a delicate face that carried the arrogance of many young girls. Normally, they naturally treated boys like devils and so they kept their distance. However, the truth was, it was just impossible for them to conceal their warm hearts.\u201cMo Fan\u2026 Do you have time tonight?\u201d Zhoumin whispered after she walked over.Tonight?He still had to consolidate the level two spell of Lightning Strike._Zhoumin, oh, Zhoumin. As the Class Representative, you should be wholeheartedly focusing on your studies, how could you let your heart focus on the mundane things. We are third year high schoolers who are about to become University students. This year is extremely important, it will affect the future. If you were to let your heart distract you this early, then it will bring nothing good for anyone!_Nevertheless, Mo Fan nodded as he said, \u201cI\u2019m available!\u201d to Zhoumin.Zhoumin immediately opened her eyes wide and said, \u201cWait for me after school, I need to tell you something really important.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Mo Fan nodded, he was wondering if he should have Zhang Xiaohou go and prepare a small umbrella, just in case he needed it._(TL. Note: A small umbrella is slang for a condom.)_\u2014\u2014After school ended, a large crowd of students rushed toward the exit.Zhoumin was indeed true to her words; she was waiting for Mo Fan at the back gate of the school.Mo Fan walked over and as he was about to open his mouth, Zhoumin mysteriously said, \u201cMo Fan, I\u2019m not sure if I should be telling you about this matter, but I also don\u2019t know anyone who is more suitable.\u201dAs Mo Fan heard this, he suddenly had no idea what to expect.\u201cIt\u2019s like this; my grandma\u2019s house is on Rongshu Street. It is an old district that is going to be rebuilt into a new one. During the summer break, I went back to live with my grandmother, and then I frequently felt trembling sounds from the construction site next door. It seemed like there were construction workers doing their jobs. However, I asked some people and they all said that they don\u2019t do construction work at night\u2026 My grandma always said that the large old district that is about be razed has something living there. I tried to get my grandmother to move away, but she refused to leave the place. Therefore, I was hoping you would come with me and see what exactly is happening. Or else, I won\u2019t feel safe leaving my grandmother there alone, I\u2019d feel scared at night,\u201d Zhoumin told Mo Fan sincerely.After hearing Zhoumin\u2019s words, Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but feel shocked.Construction site trembling?Shit, last time there was a cafeteria, and this time, there\u2019s a construction site trembling. This Bo City was getting toyed with too much!\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s another Colossal-eyed Ape Rat?\u201d Mo Fan thought aloud.\u201cColossal-eyed Ape Rat? That\u2019s a Magical Beast, Bo City shouldn\u2019t have those kind of things, right?\u201d Zhoumin blurted out in shock.Zhoumin still had lingering fears from the last time she faced a dreaded Magical Beast.\u201cThat\u2019s not a strange thing at all. The news from the Hunter\u2019s Union states that during this period of time, the Colossal-eyed Ape Rats are acting like they\u2019re entering the mating season, and there are frequent cases of them popping out from dark corners.\u201d Mo Fan was already used to seeing strange things.If he spent his time just lingering around school, Mo Fan would be the same as Zhoumin; thinking that Bo City was one hundred perfect safe and that there would not be any Magical Beasts appearing.However, being in the City Hunter Team, Mo Fan could count as having experience and knowledge._How do you say this\u2026__Little classmate, Zhoumin, you really found the right person! This brother\u2019s other identity is an officer of Bo City, and because we only clean the Magical Beasts within the Bo City, we are definitely more specialized!__Sigh, I won\u2019t be able to receive a commission this time. However, getting a girl\u2019s affection isn\u2019t exactly a bad thing either, let\u2019s go and take a look!_\u2014\u2014Arriving at the old district, it was just as Zhoumin had described. This part of the city had already been demolished, it looked as though it had just experienced a severe earthquake.Dust pervaded the demolished district, and there were temporary walls and holes all over the construction sites. A half-demolished house was just left there, it affected the appearance of the area as they erected another unfinished tower nearby._I heard that the old Rongshu district is going to be rebuilt into a new commercial district. In the end, there was a severe shortage in the investments, and so they left behind its remains. Even the government doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it._Most of the people had already moved away from this district. There were wanderers and vagrants who decided to stay here temporarily due to difficulties. The remaining ones who stayed behind were the old people who refused to move away, like Zhoumin\u2019s old grandmother.____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was it really another Colossal-eyed Ape Rat?It was reported that after eliminating the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat, the other areas around Mingwen Girls Middle School also had slight trembles. The police hadn\u2019t found the reason behind them, and the school had ensured the campus\u2019 safety, so school began as planned.\u201cMy grandmother lives here, and the trembling area is over there.\u201d Zhoumin pointed first at an old house, and then pointed toward a large construction site with more old houses that had already been partially demolished.The construction teams had withdrawn from the site for a while now, a result of not being paid. The entire abolished district could be described as desolate and uninhabited. When night fell, the distant, splendid city in lights was not able to illuminate this place. Black clouds shrouded the night sky.The great city officer Mo Fan was currently being quite daring. With a nimble leap, he vaulted the temporary construction walls, and after he landed elegantly, he discovered Zhoumin walking in through the little gate further down. The atmosphere immediately turned incredibly awkward.\u201c _Cough_ , so what time does it usually start trembling?\u201d Mo Fan asked quickly.\u201cDuring the evening, no specific time.\u201d Usually, Zhoumin would appear like a successful career woman. However, after coming to this abandoned construction site, she couldn\u2019t help but stand closer to Mo Fan.Mo Fan walked forward a few steps, and then took something like a fragrant bag from his pocket.He untied the bag; inside it was sparkling and translucent dust. As Mo Fan blew the dust, it immediately scattered through the air, before it slowly sprinkled down all over the construction site.\u201cThis is\u2026 Beast Seeking Dust?\u201d As expected of the honor student Zhoumin, she could tell what it was from a single glance.\u201cYeah,\u201d Mo Fan nodded. Beast Seeking Powder was a must for city officers when hunting beasts on a dark and windy night.\u201cHow come you brought this kind of thing along, do you really think there\u2019s a Magical Beast here?\u201d Zhoumin asked, surprised.What student would normally bring this along with them? Moreover, this was Bo City, it\u2019s not like they were in the desolate countryside!\u201cLady, you need to trust in experts. Just look for yourself.\u201d Mo Fan pointed at the sparkling, translucent dust that was sprinkled on the floor.The dust he\u2019d sprinkled had gathered about ten meters away from them, and the translucent dust particles looked as though they were glued to the floor, forming an outline there. This outline looked like\u2026 a footprint!As Zhoumin saw this, she was completely dumbstruck.Heavens, Bo City really had Magical Beasts??The odor of a Magical Beast was normally really hard to catch a whiff of, especially the ones that had already left the scene.The specialty of the Beast Seeking Dust was that it was extremely sensitive to a Magical Beast\u2019s odor. If a Magical Beast left behind a footprint ten days ago, the Beast Seeking Dust would still be able to track it!\u201cWhat, what do we do?\u201d Zhoumin was so scared that her face had turned pale.Normally in school, she wouldn\u2019t question what the teachers said, and she would think the city was the safest place. Who would\u2019ve thought that there really were footprints of Magical Beasts, the Beast Seeking Dust didn\u2019t lie!\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at the shape of the footprints\u2026\u201d Mo Fan bravely walked over.\u201cWe-we should hurry and contact the City Hunter Team.\u201d Zhoumin couldn\u2019t help but feel a chill.Mo Fan was completely speechless._I am a genuine officer from the City Hunter Team. Contact them, my ass!_Besides, it\u2019s not like the City Hunter Team had a lot of time. If there wasn\u2019t any concrete evidence, then they wouldn\u2019t dispatch the team.The footprint outline emerging from the Beast Seeking Dust could only count as a suspicion, and not ironclad evidence. After all, a Summoning Mage taking a stroll here was a possibility, too.\u201cThis footprint doesn\u2019t seem like it belongs to a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat.\u201d Mo Fan creased his brow.\u201cMo\u2026 Mo Fan\u2026 We should leave.\u201d Zhoumin was a bit scared.Mo Fan, however, wanted to investigate this to the end, so he continued to walk toward the interior of the construction site.Zhoumin carefully followed Mo Fan.\u201cIt seems like he is hiding in that unfinished mall.\u201d Mo Fan pointed down the road to the building before them.This building looked like it was supposed to be a shopping center. The floor area was gigantic, and there were piles of cement bags, tools, and building materials everywhere. The footprint shown from the Beast Seeking Dust ended at this unfinished shopping center. If there really was something living around here, then it would definitely be living in this place as it terrorized the people!This abandoned construction site had been here for two months, so it was the most perfect spot for hiding.\u201cMo mo mo\u2026 Mo Fan\u2026\u201d Zhoumin\u2019s voice suddenly turned incredibly stiff. She used an extremely strange way to warn Mo Fan.Mo Fan immediately looked towards the place Zhoumin was staring at. On the other side of the brick front wall, the place that was supposed to be the first floor had a wiggling black shadow!It was a creature with very sturdy lower limbs. Just standing there, its head was almost hitting the ceiling of the second floor.Its physique resembled that of a Spirit Wolf; the main difference was that it did not stand with four limbs, it stood on two legs, like a werewolf!The biggest difference was this thing\u2019s head.The gigantic wolf-shaped head had one single eye; it looked particularly terrifying beneath the night sky.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s an One-eyed Magic Wolf!\u201d Zhoumin almost yelled out.A One-eyed Magic Wolf. This was a savage Magical Beast that was mentioned several times by their teachers in Magical Beast class. It was different from a creature like the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat that hid in the corner; the One-eyed Magic Wolf mostly dwelled in the mountains. It was innately hostile to humans, and it really liked eating them!They were greedy, savage, and enjoyed massacre. They hungrily eyed people who tended to live away from the human centers of civilization.\u201cShit, this kind of One-eyed Magic Wolf appeared so close to the city area; even if there are people who don\u2019t care, they won\u2019t be able to anymore!\u201d After Mo Fan saw this scene, his heart also began to tremble.Not too long ago, he was the same as Zhoumin; someone who thought the city was extremely safe.Who would\u2019ve thought that this would be the second Magical Beast he encountered in Bo City?The Colossal-eyed Ape Rat appearing in the city wasn\u2019t too strange. That kind of creature already lived among humanity\u2019s sewers and graveyards. However, how could one explain the savage One-eyed Magic Wolf appearing in this kind of place?\u201cIt\u2026 what is it doing??\u201d Zhoumin was so scared that her face had gone white.\u201cEating midnight snacks,\u201d Mo Fan replied.Zhoumin carefully looked over before she almost fainted.This One-eyed Magic Wolf was chewing. In the shadowy light, Zhoumin saw a chewed-off arm!Heavens, that was a human arm!Mo Fan, that scoundrel, how could he playfully say that the monster was eating its midnight snack?!It was eating people!!It really was eating people!!!*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They wouldn\u2019t be integrated into the population data recorded by the police. This One-eyed Magic Wolf is so sly. It hides in the abolished construction site, and then uses those wanderers that no one takes notice of as food. If I hadn\u2019t found this, then who knows how many people would have become its rations,\u201d Mo Fan coldly snorted.Zhoumin was already scared to the point where she couldn\u2019t talk. Originally, she had come here with the attitude of finding the source of the problem, but she didn\u2019t expect to encounter a Magical Beast that ate people. Even if Bo City had nearly a million people, there were people dying everyday. That, however, did not mean that living people were being eaten by a Magical Beast that hid in a place like this. Dreadful, this whole thing was too dreadful!\u201cSpeaking of which, Zhoumin, don\u2019t you feel like this One-eyed Magic Wolf is different from the ones our teacher described?\u201d Mo Fan commented as he looked at the dreadful animal from afar.How could Zhoumin possibly have the mood to think about this question? At the moment, she was thinking about how to escape this construction site without being discovered, and then immediately notifying the Hunter\u2019s Union of this scary information.\u201cIts physique is at least twice as big as the one our teacher described. This is not your common One-eyed Magic Wolf,\u201d Mo Fan continued.Zhoumin almost went crazy._Let\u2019s think of a way to escape this place first, alright? How can Mo Fan\u2019s courage be at this level!?_Mo Fan himself very quickly realized that Zhoumin was only an arrogant girl while in school. When faced with a horror scene such as this, she lost her will to investigate.\u201cYou can leave this place first and call the City Hunter Team\u2019s hotline. While you\u2019re at it, have the police move the residents and wanderers in this area away,\u201d Mo Fan told Zhoumin.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Zhoumin asked.\u201cI\u2019ll stay here and watch over it,\u201d Mo Fan replied.Zhoumin looked at Mo Fan with the gaze of someone who had seen a monster._We are both third-year high school students, but why doesn\u2019t this guy have any reaction after seeing this? Normal people would be so scared that they\u2019d pee their pants!_After carefully thinking about it, Zhoumin suddenly realized that this abnormal Mo Fan had killed a Spirit Wolf once before; it seemed like Magical Beasts didn\u2019t frighten him much._A freak, he\u2019s a freak._\u201cI\u2026 I already notified them,\u201d Zhoumin whispered, somewhat proud of herself for taking the initiative.Mo Fan was confused as he asked without thinking, \u201cHow did you notify\u2026 Oh, shit!\u201dWithin a heartbeat, Mo Fan realized the trouble he was in.\u201cHnng~!\u201dInside the not-so-distant building, the One-eyed Magic Wolf busy having its meal slowly turned its head around. The lantern-like eye locked onto Zhoumin and Mo Fan\u2019s location.In a split second, the atmosphere froze.Despite hiding behind a brick wall, Mo Fan and Zhoumin could still feel the bone-chilling killing intent released from the savage One-eyed Magic Wolf.An evening wind came through, carrying a dense smell of blood as it blew right into the faces of Mo Fan and Zhoumin.Zhoumin was completely dumbstruck. She never thought that the One-eyed Magic Wolf would suddenly discover their whereabouts. As her gaze met that single eye, it was like her entire being was dropped into a dreadful abyss, and her body was unable to move.\u201cDid your mom not teach you that Magical Beasts have the ability to sense mobile signals!?\u201d Mo Fan grabbed Zhoumin, and with lightning speed, he dashed toward the outside of the construction site.The creatures in this world had one thing that was out of the norm, which was their ability to sense the signals of magical equipment. So even if you were to send a help text to the City Hunter Team with your phone sounds off, it\u2019d be no different than sending your phone GPS location to the Magical Beast\u2019s brain, exposing you instantly!\u201cGrrrr~!\u201dThe One-eyed Magic Wolf also realized that its whereabouts were exposed. It readied its body like a bow, and then it became like a coyote who discovered food as it flew toward Mo Fan and Zhoumin, its speed extremely frightening!Fortunately, Mo Fan and Zhoumin were a good distance away from this thing, or else the two of them would have instantly turned into the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s midnight snack.Mo Fan ran extremely quickly, fleeing even as he was connecting his Star Path.This technique was something he had learned from the few times he had responded to a call with the City Hunter Team. If he stood in his original spot connecting his Star Path like a retard, the Magical Beast could just wantonly throw something at his forehead, and he would lose his life on the spot!\u201cFire Burst, Burning Bones!\u201dWith one hand, he held Zhoumin\u2019s wrist as he ran; on the other hand, he coagulated a boiling fireball.As he jumped over a pile of cement bags in front of him, the fireball in his hands was simultaneously thrown toward the One-eyed Magic Wolf that was charging them._Whewwwww~_The swirling speed of the Burning Bones was extremely fast; in an instant, it ignited the pile of scrap wood. The One-eyed Magic Wolf didn\u2019t dare to charge through the incredible heat.Mo Fan\u2019s Fire Burst naturally wasn\u2019t thrown at the One-eyed Magic Wolf. The nimbleness of One-eyed Magic Wolf was at the same level as the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat. Its sturdy four limbs allowed it to vigorously jump over the ruins while Mo Fan\u2019s skill with his spells hadn\u2019t reached a level where he would be able to accurately hit it.The objective of the Burning Bones flames was simple: to form a firewall to cut off the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s attack route!\u201cGrrroarr~!\u201dHowever, the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s agility far exceeded Mo Fan\u2019s imagination. It\u2019s back legs ferociously stomped the ground, and it suddenly jumped up. It actually jumped directly over the raging Burning Bones flames!_Boom!_ The One-eyed Magic Wolf landed heavily, raising a cloud of dust.Its eye once again locked onto the escaping Mo Fan and Zhoumin. The One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s back legs stomped ferociously, its body lowered and became like an oncoming train as it charged after them. The construction wood, sand piles, and handcarts in its way were all sent flying.Mo Fan turned his head to look back, and was unable to stop himself from cursing.This One-eyed Magic Wolf really was abnormal. Let\u2019s not even talk about its speed, its body was actually so sturdy. If he were to get hit by a One-eyed Magic Wolf like that, then he would would lose his life. It was probably much stronger than any of the other Magical Beasts that he had encountered before._Fortunately, Zhoumin and I were a bit far from it before. We\u2019ll be exiting the construction site soon, we should be safer once we\u2019re outside.__Boom! Boom! Boom!_The temporary outer walls of the construction site were like foam, directly smashed into pieces by the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s body. When Mo Fan and Zhoumin, who had just made it to the old residential area, turned their heads around and realized that the One-eyed Magic Wolf was still chasing them, they were completely dumbstruck._Freaking One-eyed Magic Wolf, this daddy has already entered his pagoda, yet you still want to be that noisy?_Mo Fan had thought that this One-eyed Magic Wolf had some intelligence, because it was hiding in a construction site no one was at while it ate vagrants. Thus, he deduced that the One-eyed Magic Wolf would not chase them all the way to the old residential street. If it was discovered by people, it would become the objective of a manhunt. Who would\u2019ve thought that the One-eyed Magic Wolf was actually so stupid that it directly chased them out of the construction site?_Brother Wolf, attacking in broad daylight would not give you anyone to eat, so you can go and head home. Although it is currently evening and the old residential street doesn\u2019t have many people around, there will still be someone who will see this and report it\u2026 Isn\u2019t it better if we all just go and leave in peace today, split up after we\u2019ve crossed this corner, and none of us turn our heads around?__Shit, you\u2019re still chasing? If you\u2019re still chasing, then don\u2019t blame me for being impolite!_*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Due to the abandoned construction site, there weren\u2019t many people living here to begin with. At this moment, the One-eyed Magic Wolf had dashed out of the construction site as it followed the slightly muddy street. From the shadows of the old banyan tree, you could only see another shadow engulfing everything as it passed by.\u201cHurry up and escape with your grandmother, I\u2019ll try to delay this thing!\u201d Mo Fan told Zhoumin.No matter how fast they ran, they still couldn\u2019t run away from a violent, four-limbed One-eyed Magic Wolf. At this time, Mo Fan was once again reminded of how important it was to have a movement spell.\u201cHow are you going to delay\u2026\u201d Zhoumin asked, her voice trembling.\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit so much!\u201d Mo Fan excoriated her.Although Zhoumin was also a Fire Mage, her Fire Burst: Scorch was completely useless against this kind of large One-eyed Magic Wolf. The signal device had pointed out that his Hunter team members were in the vicinity, so Mo Fan should be able to hold up until reinforcements came.Zhoumin finally stopped wasting time as she hurriedly ran toward one of the houses on the street.However, Mo Fan underestimated this stupid girl\u2019s kindness. Not only did she notify her grandmother, she also wanted to notify the other people who also lived on the street.As Mo Fan realized that there were quite a few old people who still living on the old residential street, his forehead creased.If they hadn\u2019t seen through this thing today, then it was possible that these old people would\u2019ve ended up as the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s food._It\u2019s here!_Finally, the One-eyed Magic Wolf caught up and was only twenty meters away from Mo Fan.The One-eyed Magic Wolf probably didn\u2019t even need a second to cover the twenty meters.(Ed. Note: Ah, the speed of plot. So swift, yet taking so much time to catch up to those waiting for it\u2026)Not to mention, these Magical Beasts were way scarier than how the school described them. The pressure given off by the One-eyed Magic Wolf as it dashed over was about the same as an oncoming car. A normal person would just stand there completely dumbstruck.\u201cI told you to not chase, yet you still had to freaking chase. Do you think that I\u2019m gonna drop some rare loot after I die?\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but curse as he stared at the One-eyed Magic Wolf that was hurtling at him.Cursing was one thing, but Mo Fan had no intention of standing there waiting to get killed.His intent was locked onto the scythe imprint within his Spiritual World; in an instant, a mystical glow from his spirit blossomed from his body.In the front of Mo Fan, the mystical glow materialized a three-dimensional, rhombus-shaped shield that was a bit taller than a human.When the mystical light was at its brightest, the radiance in front of Mo Fan turned into a dark green bone shield with clear corners.Magical Equipment, Bone Scythe Shield!The Bone Scythe Shield was floating in front of Mo Fan\u2019s head as it was enveloped in the mystical light. It appeared extremely fast.The colossal One-eyed Magic Wolf wasn\u2019t aware of the appearance of the Bone Scythe Shield until it was too late, and in its haste to crush Mo Fan into mincemeat was unable to stop in time._Bang!_Because the One-eyed Magic Wolf was leaning forward, it hit the Bone Scythe Shield head-on. The Bone Scythe Shield emitted a fierce trembling sound. The One-eyed Magic Wolf, who had rammed into the Bone Scythe Shield with colossal force, now flew back ten or so meters, and Mo Fan, taking cover behind the shield, was blown away as well.After the Bone Scythe Shield had warded off the vicious attack of the One-eyed Magic Wolf, it immediately turned into fragments of light as it disappeared into thin air. Mo Fan slid along the cement like he was on a skateboard as he was forced away.His stomach felt awful.Mo Fan fought down the urge to puke. Even though the Bone Scythe Shield had warded off the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s strongest attack, Mo Fan still felt like his stomach had been hit by something._What a strong animal!_ Mo Fan was secretly astonished.The quality of the Bone Scythe Shield could be called pretty good, as being able to block the full strength of a Magical Beast and emerge safely demonstrated. However, when the One-eyed Magic Wolf had charged in, it had still caused some damage to Mo Fan. From that, he could tell that if that much power had directly struck his body, it would definitely have caused his bones to shatter.The One-eyed Magic Wolf was lying on the street, its head bleeding.It shook its head as it slowly climbed up in a daze, and then held the area it had hurt with its paw like a human might.\u201cIt can even stand up from that, is its body made out of iron?\u201d As Mo Fan saw that this One-eyed Magic Wolf hadn\u2019t lost its ability to move, his jaw nearly dropped to the ground.Was it that the Magical Beasts he had encountered before were too weak, or this One-eyed Magical Wolf was just particularly strong? If the Spirit Wolf or that Colossal-eyed Ape Rat had charged over like that, then their bones would have fallen apart!Run, hurry and run!Taking advantage of this thing still being dazed, he began to run away without stopping.Just running wouldn\u2019t work, it would quickly catch up. Thus, he would just give it a Lightning Strike so it would lose its ability to move for a bit!With this kind of danger, Mo Fan no longer dared to hide his strength. If Zhoumin saw his Lightning element, then she saw it; convincing her to not tell anyone wouldn\u2019t be too hard.As he took a deep breath, he eased the pain in his stomach. Mo Fan had already begun to prepare for Control of his Lightning Star Path.\u201cIce Spread, Condense!\u201dAs Mo Fan took control of two Lightning stars, a woman\u2019s shout came from afar.A cold air quickly covered this old residential street, and frost fell down from the ominous sky.This frost was formed by command, it quickly gathered on the feet of the One-eyed Magic Wolf, and its surroundings condensed into a block of ice.The ice was spreading. It grew up the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s strong legs, and in just a few seconds of time, the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s four limbs were covered in ice.If the One-eyed Magic Wolf were in perfect condition, then the Ice Spread most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it. However, the One-eyed Magic Wolf was currently in a dazed condition. By the time it was clear-headed, its lower limbs would already be frozen. If it were still able to take a step, then freezing it would be extremely difficult!Mo Fan felt a surge of joy as he turned around, seeing a cold-faced young woman wearing dark purple jeans on her long legs standing at the end of the street. The white Ice Star Path on the side of her body was still emitting radiance, causing the Ice Maga to look even more beautiful.\u201cCaitang!\u201d Mo Fan was overjoyed.She didn\u2019t forget that he had saved her life once before with Lightning Strike, and with her timely move this time, he was able to maintain the secret of the Lightning element.\u201cLittle bastard, how come you are here?\u201d Guo Caitang was suspicious as she looked at Mo Fan.This bastard Mo Fan, how could Guo Caitang not recognize him? With a group of little kids, they peeked at her taking a bath, how could Guo Caitang ever forget about that matter? It made her hate Mo Fan to the bone.If she knew it was him who had attracted an One-eyed Magic Wolf, then Guo Caitang definitely would\u2019ve hesitated when she took action earlier. In theory, a pervert and a Magical Beast should both be the same; in the name of the moon, I will eliminate you!\u201cI\u2026 My girlfriend and I were having a date here. You came just in time.\u201d Mo Fan immediately retreated to a safe distance as he reunited with Zhoumin and her grandmother.\u201cHurry up and get lost! Our Hunter Team is already in the vicinity,\u201d Guo Caitang snapped in a rude tone.______________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s the Beast Hunter Team.\u201d Zhoumin shouted, as if she had obtained a new life.Mo Fan no longer said anything. He took advantage of the One-eyed Magic Wolf being frozen to immediately escape from that place.Right after they escaped the street, he immediately heard Guo Caitang use her Bluetooth-style earphones to communicate with her other teammates, saying, \u201cHave you guys notified Fan Mo? This is an One-eyed Magic Wolf at the Advanced stage! If I\u2019m not wrong, then this should be the thing that sneakily absorbed the Underground Holy Spring, along with the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat! Dealing with the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat isn\u2019t much of a problem, but this One-eyed Magic Wolf has reaped a great benefit and is much stronger than your average Magical Beast! Without Lightning Mages, it will be very hard for us to subdue it!\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s that kind of reckless animal, my father put out a bounty for it a while ago now. Today, it will be seized by us!\u201d Standing beside Guo Caitang was a tall, skinny and gloomy-looking young man, \u201cSince I\u2019m here, then I, Yu Ang, will help the Hunters Team eliminate this animal!\u201d\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t approach it. Let\u2019s use Ice Spread to suppress it from afar first, it seems like it hit something a while ago and hasn\u2019t regained its senses yet. Otherwise, our Ice Spreads most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it. Let\u2019s just wait for our teammates to arrive, especially the Lightning Mage. Against this kind of power-type Magical Beast, Lightning is the best choice to use!\u201d Guo Caitang said sincerely.\u201cOh? Alright, I\u2019ll go with what you say.\u201d Yu Ang nodded his head. He also began to link his Ice Star Path as he stood away, before he continued freezing the Wolf. As it seemed quite easy, Yu Ang turned his head around to glance at Mo Fan, who was escaping with his female classmate. \u201cWho\u2019s that guy you called little brat? Do you know him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Mo Fan, it\u2019s the uncontrollable guy who cursed Uncle Mu Zhuoyun.\u201d Guo Caitang clenched her teeth.\u201cSo that\u2019s Mo Fan, hehe.\u201d Yu Ang couldn\u2019t help himself as a smile of contempt emerged on his face._I thought this guy was supposed to be pretty amazing, but it turns out when he is facing a Magical Beast, he becomes a scared dog. That\u2019s comical. It seems like the rumor of him killing a Spirit Wolf before really was just the luck of a dog. I bet it wasn\u2019t even him who killed it, the people in the stronghold really enjoy babbling nonsense.__Does this kind of a dreg really have the qualifications to appear at my Coming-of-Age Ceremony?__Sigh, let\u2019s not think too much about that unimportant character. I have to think about how to deal with this One-eyed Magical Beast that is at the Advanced stage\u2026_\u2014\u201cMo Fan, why are you going back?\u201d Zhoumin led her grandmother toward a street with more people.\u201cI dropped my phone there.\u201d Mo Fan didn\u2019t care too much about Zhoumin\u2019s question as he hurriedly ran back the way they\u2019d come.As Mo Fan was running, Mo Fan pulled out a fashionable hoodie from his flat backpack. At same time, he used crayons to paint his face black, and to be on the safe side, he wore a face mask!\u201cDamn, Captain America can just rip off his clothes to instantly become the city rescuing hero, whereas my transformation is just too behind the modern times!\u201d_(Ed. Note: Remember, Mo Fan is from another world. Highly doubtful either Captain America or Bluetooth is known here.)_In fact, Mo Fan was just changing from Fire element to Lightning element. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t forget that he had a secret identity of being a City Officer while he was in school, which was why he always brought his tools along.After acting like a brave male student, he ought to become the emissary of the City. He really didn\u2019t know if he was simply amazing, or if he was just a clown.Speaking of which, the person standing next to Guo Caitang should be the adoptive son of Mu Zhuoyun, Yu Ang. Looked like a she-male prettyboy; one glance and you knew that he was not a good person.A One-eyed Magic Wolf who had sneakily absorbed some of the Underground Holy Spring?_Just what is the Underground Holy Spring, how did it turn a normal One-eyed Magic Wolf into something this dreadful?_Mo Fan was already different from Practicals. If it were a Spirit Wolf in front of him right now, then he could actually deal with one or two. However, this One-eyed Magic Wolf was clearly much stronger than the Spirit Wolf\u2026_Lately, there have been vibrations everywhere, as well as an increase in Colossal-eyed Ape Rats that have gone crazy. Is it possible that it has something to do with the Underground Holy Spring?__Forget it, let\u2019s not think too much about that for now. I need to hurry back and defend the peace of the Earth.__It is said that a Variant Beast tends to drop good things\u2026_\u2014By the time Mo Fan returned to the old banyan street, the other Hunter Team members had already arrived.They were basically on call 24/7; as long as there was a situation, they would be the first to arrive, much faster than police.\u201cBrother Fan Mo, you got here quite fast!\u201d When Fei Shi saw Mo Fan arriving, he immediately busted out a smile.\u201cDon\u2019t be distracted, this Advanced One-eyed Magic Wolf can take our lives in just a second!\u201d Captain Xu Dahuang ordered solemnly.\u201cMhm, fortunately, we have an extra helper today. With two Ice Mages present, we will be able to substantially restrict the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s movements,\u201d Li Wenjie said.Guo Caitang and Yu Ang were both outstanding disciples of a great Ice family; with their Ice Spreads conjoined, they had already frozen ten meters around the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s legs. Although the One-eyed Magic Wolf hadn\u2019t been completely frozen over, its movements were still much slower.Ice Spread had a permeating ability; the longer the Wolf was within the area of the Ice Spread, the stiffer its bones and muscles would become. Against a One-eyed Magic Wolf who completely relied on brute force to battle, this tactic was extremely suitable.However, a small problem still remained.Ice and Fire elements had some conflicts with one another. The primary attacker of the Hunters Team was Xu Dahuang; however, Xu Da Huang\u2019s Fire Burst: Rupture could very possibly shatter the Ice Spread from Guo Caitang and Yu Ang.Thus, except for restricting the One-eyed Magic Wolf for right now, they had no other good ideas at the moment.\u201cI have already called for reinforcements, Yang Zuohe from the Mage Association is currently on the way here. We\u2019ll need to maintain the restraints while he is on the way, don\u2019t make a vain attempt to kill this One-eyed Magic Wolf,\u201d Xu Dahuang said with an experienced air.Fire Burst: Rupture definitely was capable of severely injuring this One-eyed Magic Wolf; however, that wasn\u2019t much of a warranty. In case the One-eyed Magic Wolf still was capable of fighting, restricting its movement at that time would be much more difficult. Above all, they definitely could not let it flee to a residential area with people still living there!\u201cYang Zuohe, the Intermediate-level Mage?\u201d Xiao Ke\u2019s eyes lit up, her face filled with admiration.\u201cMhm, with him here, we can safely kill this One-eyed Magic Wolf. If we were to let it escape, then it would bring countless casualties among the civilians,\u201d Xu Dahuang answered.\u201cThat is indeed the case, but we don\u2019t know how long our Ice Spread can last. This One-eyed Magic Wolf is too strong. If we were to advance our Ice Spread to level 3, it would definitely not be able to escape from us,\u201d Guo Caitang told him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s still us here!\u201d Fei Shi and Li Wenjie spoke up.\u201cAre we going to do something?\u201d Mo Fan asked as he looked at the people who had drafted a plan.\u201cYou stay on the side and tend to other lives, your level one Lightning Strike won\u2019t necessarily be able to injure it. However, the paralysis effect should be able to have a significant impact. If this One-eyed Magic Wolf struggles and the Ice Spread shows signs\u2026 Huh, something is wrong. Why is this guy\u2019s aura becoming stronger and stronger?\u201d Xu Dahuang\u2019s expression changed.The air was cold from the magic pervading the old banyan street area. Without any visible cause, a great amount of ferocious aura suddenly converged around the Wolf, before turning into a violent gale that blasted down the whole street.________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This ferocious aura continued to splash out like a great wave, and all the residences on the old street started shaking.\u201cAdvancement, this guy has been pressured by us so much that it is forcing its own advancement!\u201d\u201cAfter absorbing the energy from the Underground Holy Spring, it already possessed the potential to advance. We must stop it! If we let it succeed at its advancement, then even if Yang Zuohe gets here, he won\u2019t necessarily be able to subdue it!\u201d Xu Dahuang\u2019s face turned extremely ugly.After being in the City Hunter Team for so long, it was also Xu Dahuang\u2019s first time encountering a Magical Beast at the advanced stage.An advanced stage Magical Beast wasn\u2019t scary at all; the scariest part was a Magical Beast that had successfully evolved. That was not something these Primary Magicians were capable of withstanding!Moreover, once it started to wantonly massacre everything, the slaughter in this area of the city would be devastating!\u201cThis isn\u2019t good, we are unable to stop it! Let\u2019s use the time before it successfully advances to escape from this place,\u201d Li Wenjie said, his face completely pale.The speed of a Magical Beast that had successfully advanced was not something Li Wenjie was capable of dealing with, the people here would all die. It wouldn\u2019t even take ten seconds for a One-eyed Magic Wolf who had succeeded at its evolution to kill every single person here!\u201cWhat the hell are you saying? Turn yourself around and see what\u2019s behind your back!\u201d Xu Dahuang shouted at him angrily.This area was abandoned because of the existence of construction sites, and the banyan street was also in a semi-demolished state. However, after passing through the old banyan street, there was a business district with flashing neon lights.Sitting in that place were families of old and young watching movies, there were girls who were preparing presents for the Qixi Festival, there were also old couples who were leisurely taking a walk. Resident towers, shops, entertainment centers, plazas\u2026\u201cDo you think these people are capable of protecting themselves?\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that if we were to turn around and leave, then if this One-eyed Magic Wolf completes its evolution, it will definitely be in need of a large quantity of food. Those people are the food!\u201dThis city did have Magicians who were stronger than their Hunter Team. However, Intermediate Magicians wouldn\u2019t be on alert at all times. Even if they were to come here at the fastest speed possible to eliminate the One-eyed Magic Wolf, it definitely did not mean that they would be able to prevent a massacre within that period of time.Just how many humans lives would be lost is something Xu Dahuang did not dare calculate.\u201cAlthough that little scoundrel is extremely annoying, he still has done something incredible today. We were able to discover this One-eyed Magic Wolf that was about to evolve in time; that can be considered as preventing an increasingly large massacre. However, we don\u2019t have to say such disheartening things, it still hasn\u2019t successfully evolved! We are still able to obstruct it!\u201d Guo Caitang smiled coldly.Xu Dahuang had already decided to not run.To be honest, the spirit of the Captain of the City Hunter Team caused Mo Fan to feel some admiration toward him.\u201cFei Shi, prepare Earth Wave to slow it down. If it breaks away from the Ice Spread, we definitely cannot let it run,\u201d Xu Dahuang ordered.Feishi nodded.His palm suddenly smacked onto the cement road. In a split second, the surface of the ground suddenly turned into what looked like ripples on a lake. These ripples moved in a single direction, forcing the frozen One-eyed Magic Wolf away from them, toward a more distant location.However, the Ice Spread\u2019s effects couldn\u2019t be sustained for much longer.A churning heat from the Wolf\u2019s body began to force the surrounding frost to melt, and furthermore that water started boiling.\u201cThis guy really is evolving, its body and blood vessels are boiling!\u201d Feishi swore with an uneasy expression.Li Wenjie clenched his teeth, he didn\u2019t know what to do.To be honest, once this One-eyed Magic Wolf successfully evolved, none of the people here would be able to survive. No one would be able to stop this monster from entering the flourishing business district.Remaining here would be awaiting his own death.Furthermore, the signs of this One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s evolution were already very evident, why were they still remaining, awaiting death?\u201cIt is about to break through!\u201d Li Wenjie said, cold sweat dripping off her.Crap, now it was too late to escape!Xu Dahuang, Xiake, Feishi, Guo Caitang; none of them had any intentions of leaving.Mo Fan at this moment was staring at the One-eyed Magic Wolf; he could clearly see the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s muscles had turned slightly transparent. The veins within its muscles could actually be seen, they were boiling at a high temperature. The blood was quickly flowing through the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s body!The One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s bones were cracking, and bones actually grew directly from its shoulder muscles, becoming sharp shoulder spikes.Its giant-sized backbone was also growing, piercing through the muscles of its back. Bones that still had wisps of blood glued to them had turned into a thorny ridge on its spine. Beneath the cold moonlight, it appeared increasingly dreadful!\u201cFire Burst, Rupture!\u201dXu Dahuang was finally unable to resist. A fireball condensed in his hand. It carried some resentment as he threw it toward this monster._Boom!_Raging flames loudly exploded in front of the One-eyed Magic Wolf, and the fierce tongues of fire immediately engulfed the One-eyed Magic Wolf. The scarlet blaze was shrouding the entire street in choking smoke.A heatwave immediately poured down the old street, and the old banyan trees combusted beneath the fierce flames. Furthermore, the fires began to spread toward the older buildings.The residents of these old buildings had already escaped without a trace. After the explosion, the two buildings to the sides turned into a burning mess.It was a ferocious blast, and presumably, it would be able to cause injuries to the One-eyed Magic Wolf.When the initial intensity of the fires dissipated, a figure with its body completely draped in flames suddenly flew out from the place that had exploded. As it flew out, it knocked aside everything that was in its way.\u201cCaptain, be careful!\u201d Feishi yelled out.Xu Dahuang was completely frozen with shock.After suffering from his Rupture, this One-eyed Magic Wolf had actually emerged safely!\u201cEarth Wave!\u201d Feishi risked his life to use the spell.He controlled the surface of the ground and wanted to use the rippling ground to drag the running One-eyed Magic Wolf backwards. Who would\u2019ve thought that the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s speed was too quick, the rippling ground was of no use!_Awuuuu~_The burning One-eyed Magic Wolf suddenly jumped, showing its unharmed belly. The claw it had poised to strike turned into a streak of cold light as it cut towards the motionless Xu Dahuang.\u201cWater Barrier, Protect!\u201d Xiaoke was still able to complete her Star Path during the calamity, countless strands of water quickly forming a liquid armor as the claw landed on Captain Xu Dahuang\u2019s body.The powerful claw ferociously ripped across this water armor.A spray of blood spurted out. A long wound emerged on the body of Captain Xu Dahuang, it looked like his chest had been completely ripped open!____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could feel the endless ferocity from the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s pupil.Its next objective was her!\u201cLightning Strike, Fierce Whip!\u201dAs everyone sank into a panicked state, traces of purple Lightning covered Mo Fan\u2019s head.He raised his hand up, before suddenly gripping it.In a split second, all of the traces of Lightning turned into a long Lightning Python. The Lightning Python frantically whipped out onto the incomparably malevolent body of the One-eyed Magic Wolf, lacerating its flesh!Every time the Lightning Whip swatted down, an electric arc would follow up and drill itself into the savage One-eyed Magic Wolf, entering its flesh and bones.It was different from the primary Lightning Strike, Python Scars. Once the whip-like Lightning traces hit them, it would leave behind Lightning prints. These prints would then conduct electricity to each other, sustaining the electric shock to the target organism.\u201cAwuuuuu!!\u201dThe One-eyed Magic Wolf was in so much pain that it began to howl.The One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s strong, substantial flesh and its steel-like body was able to endure the formidable destructive force of the Fire Burst: Rupture, and the Lightning Strike\u2019s frantic whipping could only cause superficial wounds. However, its flesh was definitely unable to resist the paralysis caused by the electric shock and the electric arcs that were constantly bouncing around inside its body.\u201cLightning! The One-eyed Magic Wolf relies most on the strength of its body, and is weak against Lightning Magic!\u201d Guo Caitang was suddenly shocked awake.\u201cThis, This is the second level of Lightning Strike!\u201d Feishi was also somewhat stunned.During this time when these Hunter Team members were unable to do anything, who would\u2019ve thought that the newest member of the Hunter Team, who had joined not too long ago, would actually stand out!The most important thing was, this kid had actually cultivated his Lightning Strike to the second level when no one was aware of it!The One-eyed Magic Wolf was already at the stage where its muscles, blood vessels, and bones were transforming. During this kind of transformation, the One-eyed Magic Wolf would directly possess the dreadful combat prowess of a successful evolution. At this time, there was nothing that could be more perfect than a Lightning Mage that was capable of detonating explosives within the creature\u2019s flesh.Even if it was the second level Lightning Strike, the strongest of the basic elements would only be able to vividly display its dominance in this kind of situation. Adding to the Lightning element\u2019s powerful restraining abilities, it even caused the One-eyed Magic Wolf to actually stagger and feel weak across its entire body.Opposite it was Mo Fan, standing at a safe distance and letting loose a long breath.Fortunately, the second level of Lightning Strike was indeed very effective, or else the consequences would have been catastrophic.\u201cContinue, Fan Mo, continue! Your Lightning Strike is causing its flesh and bones to stop growing! As long as we are able to stop its evolution, we will still have a chance!\u201d Guo Caitang urgently shouted.Mo Fan nodded.He connected his Star Path, and the purple traces of Lightning once again emerged on top of Mo Fan\u2019s head.Even if he was still a bit unfamiliar with using the second level of Lightning Strike, Mo Fan couldn\u2019t afford to have even a slightest bit of error when faced with a life and death situation.The Lightning Whip once more viciously lashed onto the One-eyed Magic Wolf, whose body now appeared to be a little deformed. The whip this time not only had the ability to restrict the One-eyed Magic Wolf, it actually caused its body to deflate. Additionally, the growth of the Wolf\u2019s bones showed signs of receding.\u201cGood job, Fan Mo!\u201d\u201cWe suppressed it!\u201d\u201cHit it until it returns to its original form!\u201dEveryone was unable to contain their excitement. To them, Mo Fan\u2019s Lightning Strike had essentially saved all their lives.\u201cThe paralysis effect of the Lightning Strike isn\u2019t sustainable. After the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s flesh and bones have adapted to the electric shocks, it will be able to expand once more!\u201d Guo Caitang reminded everyone.Mo Fan himself was extremely clear on the fact that the Lightning Strike\u2019s paralysis effect wasn\u2019t sustainable.No matter what, he still had delayed it for a bit of time. Mo Fan felt like he had done his best, and at least enough to allow Li Wenjie to pull Xu Dahuang into a safe area. Whether Captain Xu Dahuang was alive or dead was hard to say.\u201cAwooooo!\u201d the Wolf howled out.It had finally adapted to the paralysis of the Lightning Strike. This monster that was brimming with power from its body once again released the aura of a wild beast.\u201cCrap, it is transforming again!\u201dThe color of everyone\u2019s faces changed once more. This meant that they would need to worry about their lives again.After seeing this scene, Mo Fan knew that he really was powerless now.Currently, all he could do was to retreat. His Lightning Strike had given the innocent residents a bit more time, and could also be seen as having saved a few people.\u201cYou evil creature, you still haven\u2019t accepted your death!\u201d an incomparably solemn shout suddenly resounded through the sky above the old street.Before he had even seen the speaker, Mo Fan could feel an enormous elemental force gathering in mid-air, countless drops of misty fog were falling faintly onto his cheeks._Woooooosh~_Mo Fan raised his head, and was shocked to see that there was an incredibly large wave emerging in midair!A turbulent wave in the air?Mo Fan had a hard time believing his own eyes. Yet, this surging wave really was passing through the old houses. Immediately after it did so, it was like a bursting dam as it attacked the body of the One-eyed Magic Wolf.\u201cViolent Wave, Banishment!\u201dFollowing this divine Magic chant, the surging tide directly smashed onto the One-eyed Magic Beast. Furthermore, it turned into a flood as it instantly filled the entire street.All of the banyan trees had practically been broken through, the walls of the old houses also collapsed. The originally violent One-eyed Magic Wolf had no margin to struggle beneath the violent wave\u2019s flood; it was flushed from the middle to the far end of the street.\u201cInter-Intermediate level Water Magic!\u201d After Xiaoke saw this scene, her face turned incredibly red with excitement.Violent Wave!This was precisely the Intermediate spell of Water Element. Seeing the floodwaves rapidly flushing across the street, Xiaoke, who was also a Water Magician, was so excited that she almost fainted.Intermediate level! It was something that people yearned for even in their dreams. No one knew how long it would take a little Magician like her to reach that level.The trembling Violent Wave was surging forwards nonstop, but it didn\u2019t reach any inhabited areas. What everyone could see was that this Violent Wave resembled a ferocious dragon as it overwhelmed the One-eyed Magic Wolf, along with the fact it had almost destroyed the entire street!Mo Fan was also watching this scene attentively. At same time, his heart was also surging!_Intermediate Mage, so this is an Intermediate Mage! Formidable!______________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is Xu Dahuang alright?\u201d A middle aged man with a dark blue shirt was standing on top of an old building, and beneath his feet was a gradually fading Star Map. It looked dazzling.It was very clear that this person was Yang Zuohe, and should be the closest Intermediate ranked Magician to this place. Fortunately, Xu Dahuang and Guo Caitang had notified him in time.Yang Zuohe still had some lingering fears as he looked toward the renovated buildings in the flourishing commercial streets. From his position, he could see the people who were still shopping, completely unaware of the danger they were in.If the One-eyed Magic Wolf had successfully evolved and crossed over to those buildings, then no one knew what kind of living hell this commercial district would have become!Yang Zuohe, who had been with the Magic Association of Bo City for so many years, had seen all kinds of Magicians. Xu Dahuang\u2019s Hunter Team knew this One-eyed Magic Wolf was at the stage of evolving, yet, they stood their ground and did their best to stop it. He really admired this level of bravery!\u201cHis skin was ripped, his internal organs are fine. He\u2019s still alive, thank the heavens and earth for that.\u201d Li Wenjie helped Xu Dahuang cover his blood-coated chest.To be honest, Li Wenjie didn\u2019t quite understand the Captain\u2019s attitude. Could it be that his life as a Magician was less important than those people?\u201cI have contacted a Healing Mage and they\u2019re on their way here. Think of a way to stop Xu Dahuang\u2019s bleeding. I\u2019ll take this animal\u2019s life!\u201d Yang Zuohe said.After saying this, Yang Zuohe\u2019s figure suddenly flashed away. Mo Fan could only see him leaving behind a cyan-colored Star Path before he quickly disappeared. Moreover, with extreme speed, he approached the One-eyed Magic Wolf that had been washed far away by the Violent Wave.Mo Fan subconsciously followed the Intermediate Mage\u2019s path until he arrived at the end of the street, to find the One-eyed Magic Wolf there, covered in debris.An Intermediate Mage\u2019s might was several times stronger than any Element in the Primary level. Where they were unable to do anything against the One-eyed Magic Wolf, he was able to use the Violent Wave to turn it into a half-dead old dog.Thinking about it, it seemed about right. With such a ferocious wave swatting onto you, a few bones should be broken. Adding the subsequent rolling, soaking, and the previous attacks, even creatures with a higher strength would also directly be turned into trash on the beach.Yang Zuohe evidently did not want to let this One-eyed Magic Wolf, who almost became a huge threat, go that easily! He used Wind Track to land in front of the One-eyed Magic Wolf.\u201cWind Disc!\u201dThe sound of Magic was heard, Yang Zuohe instantly transformed from a Water Magician into a Wind Magician equipped with the power of wind.A suppression that caused people to stop breathing emerged from the air.Suddenly, the surrounding air looked as though it was being pulled away from something as it began to frantically circulate.Not too far from there, Mo Fan had just arrived in time to see this Intermediate Mage with a dark blue shirt use a single hand to support the gathering power with all his might. Beneath his foot and above his head were bright Star Maps that were reflecting one another; they looked gorgeous!_Woooooooooooosh!_It wasn\u2019t a gentle wind like the Wind Track, and definitely not the same as the Wind Tunnel that was formed to increase one\u2019s speed. At this very moment, Mo Fan could clearly feel the churning airflow blowing forwards, and circulating at high speed!In a flash, a shocking and turbulent tornado emerged before them.The Wind Disc tornado pulled the immobile One-eyed Magic Wolf into the air. It drew into an arc as it circulated twenty-something meters above the ground.The Wind Disc tornado which stunned Mo Fan quickly dissipated.The One-eyed Magic Wolf, which somehow appeared much smaller, began to drop heavily from the sky as the Wind Disc tornado lost its force!_Boom!!!_The cement floor directly became concave as the impact formed a large crater.The One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s body was completely torn and crushed as it hit, its blood splashed everywhere.From the beginning to the end, the thing did not let out a sound. In just two Intermediate Magic spells, the Wolf had turned into an extremely mournful carcass.\u201cDead??\u201d Mo Fan asked, finding it hard to believe.\u201cDead.\u201d Yang Zuohe saw Mo Fan had come along, and showed his confidence with a slight smile.\u201cI\u2026 Can I go and take a look?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cYou can. Oh, if I\u2019m not wrong, then the Lightning Strike from before should have been cast by you, right?\u201d\u201cIt was me.\u201d\u201cYoung man, you did well. We, the Magic Association, will join with Hunters Union and the Government to give you all a commendation.\u201d Yang Zuohe patted Mo Fan\u2019s shoulder.Mo Fan approached the One-eyed Magic Wolf that looked nothing like its former glory as he slowly fished out the Little Loach Pendant from his shirt pocket.The Little Loach had a strong reaction at the moment the One-eyed Magic Wolf had lost its life. It was like it was beating a pitch no one was able to hear, like it was shouting out for something\u2026A strand of Wolf Soul slowly floated out from the One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s mouth.Mo Fan was able to see this Wolf Soul. It looked like a tiny burning moth that had fluttered up from being frightened, looking unsure of where to go.A radiance emerged from the Little Loach Pendant, and the Wolf Soul looked like it had found its destination as it quickly floated over\u2026The Little Loach Pendant directly absorbed the Wolf Soul, and then let out a shivering sound. It was similar to a little child who was happy after eating its food._This time\u2026 this time, it didn\u2019t look like a Soul Remnant._ After the Little Loach Pendant had absorbed the Wolf Soul, Mo Fan suddenly realized something.Before, when the Little Loach Pendant had absorbed a Soul Remnant, the Remnant basically had the weak, nearly invisible light of a firefly, and additionally, the light was particularly muddy. The Little Loach Pendant simply had difficulty absorbing it; it had the attitude of someone who thought it was barely better than nothing.However, this time, the Little Loach Pendant appeared thirsty with anticipation. When it ate the whole Wolf Soul, the entire Loach Pendant felt happy\u2026Could it be that it was a Soul Essence this time?Thinking back on what Guo Caitang had said before, this One-eyed Magic Wolf had stealthily absorbed the colossal power from the Underground Holy Spring of Bo City before it hid within the human city as it sneakily tried to evolve. In other words, this guy had basically received some good nourishment that had caused it to advance in strength and reach the stage where it was going to evolve.This kind of Magical Beast would have a very high chance of leaving behind a Soul Essence after its death!Only Soul Magicians were possessed with the ability to collect Soul Essence. If the Intermediate Magician, Yang Zuohe didn\u2019t bring along a special Soul Essence gathering tool, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to see this incomparably pure Soul Essence.The Soul Essence of a dead creature would automatically dissipate after three minutes, and it was clear that Yang Zuohe has never collected Souls before. Thus, he didn\u2019t have any interest in the carcass.Perhaps this Intermediate Magician never thought that the coming kid would actually carry a tool for collecting souls. Just when he had turned his back to tell others to clean up the scene, the Soul Essence valued at five million RMB had been taken away by the harmless-looking Mo Fan.The value of an One-eyed Magic Wolf who was on the verge of evolving was very high, but not as valuable as a Soul Essence that had only a very small chance of appearing!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, Xu Dahuang was a Magician and his body had been strengthened by his Stardust. If he had been a common person, then he would\u2019ve died on the spot.After seeing the large bloody scar stretching from Xu Dahuang\u2019s chest to his abdomen, Mo Fan truly realized the importance of a defense spell. At the same time, he also rejoiced over the magical Bone Scythe Shield in his hands, or else he would\u2019ve died already.\u201cMr. Yang, I think we should still sound the alert. The frequency of the appearances of the Magical Beast are somewhat high, it\u2019s a bit unusual,\u201d Guo Caitang said to the Intermediate Mage, Yang Zuohe.\u201cOur Magic Association is already in discussion with the Hunters Union. The government is also contemplating this matter. The only thing is that we already sounded the alert not too long ago, so sounding another one in such a short time could very easily give rise to panic,\u201d Yang Zuohe replied worriedly.\u201cA One-eyed Magic Wolf, a Magical Beast that isn\u2019t supposed to appear in the city, still appeared\u2026 Which is to say, there are some bad things happening,\u201d Guo Caitang retorted.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we are already investigating this matter. We have already reinforced the safety of the city with people. There are still some bizarre situations that we are unable to deal with, that\u2019s why we still need your Beast Hunter Teams to help,\u201d Yang Zuohe answered.\u201cWe will naturally do our best, it\u2019s just the Captain has suffered some injuries, thus, our actions\u2026\u201d Guo Caitang trailed off.\u201cI will let a Fire Magician temporarily fill your Captain\u2019s post until he recuperates. Speaking of which, when did your team add a new member, and it\u2019s actually a Lightning Mage?\u201d Yang Zuohe asked as he smiled slightly at Mo Fan.\u201cRecruited from the auditions.\u201d\u201cRecruited from the auditions??\u201d Yang Zuohe was dumbstruck as he helplessly said, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time hearing of a Lightning Mage going to a recruitment fair.\u201dEveryone began to laugh as their gazes turned to Mo Fan.Mo Fan\u2019s performance had actually surprised everyone. When everyone thought they would get killed by the evolving One-eyed Magic Wolf, he used the second level of Lightning Strike to create a decisive event. The Hunter Team rejoiced over the fact that they had picked up this kind of Lightning Mage who was willing to move around the City with them. One had to understand that Lightning Mages who has grasped the second level of Lightning Strike were mostly employed by the large, ancestral families. Even if they were to go to the Hunters Union, Magic Association or the government, they would still be able to freely choose a position of equivalent level.Yu Ang was standing there as he saw everyone\u2019s gaze lock onto that young Lightning Mage, and he couldn\u2019t help but frown.Even if he had the light from the major Ice element family, or even excelled among the peers of his age, the splendor of the Lightning Element would still be able to overshadow him.\u201cCaitang, in order to prevent Fan Mo from changing jobs, how about you use your body to tie him down. In any case, he has saved your life once already, and you still don\u2019t know how to repay him,\u201d Feishi spoke up.\u201cGet out!\u201d Guo Caitang\u2019s arrogant face was blushing as she viciously cursed back.On the side, Yu Ang\u2019s face also immediately turned increasingly gloomy.\u2014\u2014The disturbance caused by the One-eyed Magic Wolf had finally settled down.After changing his clothes, he returned to the school dorms. When Mo Fan was about to climb over the walls, he discovered a delicate little shadow flashing past by the gate.\u201cZhoumin?\u201d Mo Fan was a little surprised. Why hadn\u2019t the girl returned back home to sleep, what was she doing squatting here?\u201cMo Fan, that\u2019s good\u2026 I thought you\u2026\u201d After Zhoumin saw Mo Fan was safe and sound, her eyes began to tear up.Zhoumin was, after all, a girl at the peak of her prime. She was particularly moved during the time when Mo Fan sacrificed his own life to save everyone during the Practicals. However, she was unable to express herself due to her arrogant pride obstructing the way. This time, due to her grandmother\u2019s matter, she had almost made Mo Fan lose his life again. Mo Fan had once more saved not only her life, but also her grandmother\u2019s, and she had no idea how to repay the kindness.As Mo Fan saw Zhoumin was weeping, he also felt really awkward.\u201cIn short, thank you for saving my grandmother. My parents are always busy, so I grew up with my grandmother\u2026\u201d Zhoumin continued.After consoling her for a good while, Mo Fan advised Zhoumin to return to the female dorms.A boy sending a girl home in the late evening while the girl is crying, this scene would cause many to have ideas.After returning to the dorms, his dorm mates began to question regarding how it was. _Boring, this daddy, I, is saving the world, alright!?__\u2014_After everyone had gone to sleep, Mo Fan ran to the water tower on the roof of the school building.This place was Mo Fan\u2019s holy ground for cultivating. Most of the time, there wouldn\u2019t be any people disturbing him.\u201cHow come the Little Loach Pendant didn\u2019t have any reaction after eating that Soul Essence, it\u2019s like it is sound asleep?\u201d Mo Fan sat down on the roof of the tower as he began to talk to himself.After saying this, the Little Loach Pendant was like an infant as it woke up. It gently trembled as it let out a blossoming radiance that covered its circumference by a finger-length.This radiance looked extremely viscous, it felt like silk wrapping around the pitch-black pendant._Spinning a cocoon to use for rebirth?_Seeing the Little Loach Pendant\u2019s transformation, Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but think of a word.In fact, the Little Loach Pendant was slowly being wrapped up in the radiance, and was indeed undergoing a transformation. Its old surface had some evident transformations appearing; it was no longer as rusty or stained. It now looked as glossy as jade.\u201cThe thing which Old Man Ying had left for me is indeed a treasure!\u201d Mo Fan was entranced.He could distinctly feel the changes to the Loach Pendant. After the transformation had finished, its location on his chest was continually receiving a very comfortable flow of energy.When he was being nourished by the Common grade Stardust Magic Tool, it was like being soaked by a spring. His entire body would relax from the flow of the comfortable heat, the feeling of quickly loosening up his body and mind was extremely evident.However, after the Loach Pendant had transformed, Mo Fan could increasingly feel like he was being covered by something unique. If he really were to describe it, it would be a soft silk\u2026That soft silk would not be a burden to the actions performed by his body. It was tightly stuck to his entire body. Mo Fan, who had just gone through a big battle, instantly felt fresh and comfortable. It was like being an infant, lying down on a soft baby\u2019s bed that carried serenity and peace.Mo Fan was delighted.Even though he had never seen a Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool, he was still able to clearly feel that this kind of effect from the nourishment definitely belonged to a Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool. In addition to feeling his exhaustion quickly dissipating, Mo Fan could also feel his own Stardust being showered with nourishment; this sensation was like he was actively meditating.\u201cIt is able to increase cultivation without meditating?!\u201d Mo Fan was thoroughly shocked!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the assistance of the Stardust Magic tool, he could cultivate for 12 hours a day and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.However, the time a person had was still limited. If an even higher grade of Stardust Magic Tool allowed him to continue cultivating for an increasingly longer period of time, then it wouldn\u2019t mean much at all. It\u2019s not like Mo Fan would meditate for 24 hours a day!After experiencing combat, Mo Fan understood that if a Magician solely relied on meditation to increase their strength, it would not be enough. On the contrary, experiencing combat, being in a life-threatening circumstances and having the thirst to become stronger when faced against a powerful foe, these had a certain degree of inducing a slow but definite range of increase in Stardust.Thus, Mo Fan needed to maintain a long cultivation time everyday while he also had to join the operations of the Hunter Team.If an even higher grade of Stardust Magic Tool only increased a Mage\u2019s cultivation time, then it wouldn\u2019t be very effective for someone like Mo Fan who could already cultivate for ten or so hours everyday.What went beyond Mo Fan\u2019s expectations was that the Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool could allow Mo Fan to continually meditate, but also directly nourished his Stardust to a certain degree.When he was not meditating, his Stardust could still slowly grow.When he meditated, then it would have an even higher effect on the growth of his Stardust than normal!Mo Fan had already attained a longer degree of increase to his meditation time, and if the effects of meditating received a boost, then that was increasing his power like a rocket!_Awesome! If it\u2019s like this, then not only will I be able to advance to the third level of the Fire spell before I graduate, but my Lightning spells will also be able to advance to the third level! If I were to strive even harder, I might even be able to touch the threshold to Intermediate Mage!_When the stars reached level 3, it signified that the Stardust was not too far away from transforming into a Nebula!Mo Fan had already researched many things concerning Intermediate Mages.The element that was first formed within a Magician\u2019s Spiritual World was known as a Stardust.When the Stardust within the Magician\u2019s Spiritual World turned into a Nebula, the star orbit would appear increasingly magnificent and bright. That meant the Magician had reached the Intermediate level!The Nebula was much bigger than the Stardust. If the Stardust was just a tiny, sparkling dust in the vast universe, then the Nebula would be a cloud where starlights converged. The Nebula contained increasingly larger amounts of mana. This would signify that the mighty, formidable Intermediate Magicians could rip open the vast sky, and grandly arrive.When you linked the stars within a Stardust, they would become Primary Magic spells!When you formed a Star Map with the stars within a Nebula, they would become Intermediate Magic spells!Mo Fan definitely did not forget that when the Intermediate Mage named Yang Zuohe cast his Intermediate Magic, beneath his foot was an incomparably mysterious and magnificent Star Map. It was different from the radiance of a Star Path, the Star Map was far stranger and mightier, the power within it was enough to earn the boundless admiration of all the Magicians who were still hovering around the Primary level.The Intermediate Water Magic that was able to wash the entire street, Violent Wave, and the Intermediate Wind Magic that was able to lift a One-eyed Magic Wolf that was as heavy as a car ten or so meters into the sky, Wind Disc; let\u2019s not even talk about how cool they were, but their strength was even more abnormal. It was definitely on a whole different level than a Primary spell!_If just the Wind and Water Elements Intermediate Magic were that amazing, then wait until I have grasped the Intermediate spells of Lightning and Fire; then who would need to be afraid of the Mu Family?__Let\u2019s diligently cultivate!__I, Mo Fan\u2019s, incredible life has only just started!_\u2014\u2014The winter wind was blowing smoothly from the north. Everywhere it went, the trees stripped off the leaves that covered them as they welcomed the breeze with harsh nudity.In the south, the flora wasn\u2019t affected so much by the winds of winter. No matter how strong the wind was, the trees were always suave and green. Having some leaves falling was only giving face to the seasons. The trees were always green, 365 days a year.Mo Fan was in Bo City, a city that didn\u2019t have very clear seasons. Even the clear seasons would change one day, and that would signify that Father Typhoon was coming.Yet another typhoon season. Mo Fan and his friends were all curling up in their dorms. The moist and cold dorm building with a somewhat musty smell was mostly silent. Most of the students were expending big efforts for the Magic High Exams next year.What no one knew was that a mere Magician who graduated High School would still need to struggle within society. If you weren\u2019t able to strive for a higher position, then it would be increasingly difficult to cultivate to a higher level of Magician. If you genuinely wanted to stand out from your peers and become a Magician that would receive people\u2019s reverence, then you had to enter a Magic University. That way, your chances of becoming an Intermediate Magician would be significantly better.Intermediate Magician, that was a Magician\u2019s one chance to completely change their life. All of the students were doing their best to strive for this chance.\u201cBig Brother Mo Fan, I awakened the Healing element. So if big brother Mo Fan receives any injuries, then I can use magic to heal you,\u201d came a text message along with an adorable smiling face.Mo Fan was slightly astonished._What the heck, what is this?_\u201cHealing element? How come you awakened the Healing element? All of us awakened a basic element, so how come you awakened a Light Magic during your primary awakening?\u201d Mo Fan urgently sent a text back to ask.\u201cThe vast majority of everyone\u2019s first element awakening is a basic element. However, there are bound to be some few exceptions. I have heard that others could use some unusual item to conduct their Awakening, this would give them a definite chance of awakening a certain Magic element,\u201d Ye Xinxia texted back.\u201cConduct their Awakening? If I were to reach the Intermediate level and wanted to awaken an element, then couldn\u2019t I use the conducting way that you mentioned to complete it?\u201d Mo Fan was delighted, he felt as though he had gained a whole new view of heaven and earth.\u201cYou can, the prerequisite is that you need to be able to gather the conducting materials.\u201d\u201cXinxia, I love you to death, you have helped me solve a huge and difficult issue.\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s dull mood immediately turned happy.He had always thought that the Awakening was random, whatever element you grabbed would be it. He never thought that there\u2019d be something like Awakening Conduction in this world. In that case, after reaching the Intermediate level and obtaining a chance at Awakening his second element, if he were to use Awakening Conduction, then he could receive the Dark element!The window of Magic was unceasingly opening wider for Mo Fan during this short period of time. Every time it opened, Mo Fan could see a future that he yearned for, driving him to passionately cultivate!The progress of his Lightning and Fire Stardusts had gone smoothly, the speed of their advancement was a few times faster than his expectations. Especially after meditating, and joining the Hunter Teams for combat, he had shaken off many of his peers.However, this kind of thing did not necessarily need to be boasted about. On the day of the Magic High Exams, his peers would definitely be so surprised that their chins would come crashing down to the cement floor!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Fan gave his precious youth to cultivating and hunting beasts as he immensely enjoyed this experience.In just a wink, the number of beasts killed by Mo Fan had already gone past fifteen. In the eyes of the old veterans in the Hunters Union, he would be classified as a extremely experienced Magician.In school, the Magic High Exams, the waterfall that could allow the students to leap onto the gates of the dragons, was slowly approaching.\u201cYour comfortable days are quickly coming to an end, Mo Fan,\u201d Zhoa Kunsan said to Mo Fan, delighting in Mo Fan\u2019s misery.With graduation coming, it would also mean the previous Magic Duel promise which was witnessed by the School Principal was nearing.Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but admit that this guy Mu Zhuoyun sure was cunning. He had set the Magic Duel on a date before the Magic High exams.This would mean that if Mo Fan were to get into some small accident in this Magic Duel, then it could very well influence his performance at the Magic High Exams.\u201cBrother Fan, I heard the neighbors talk about Mu Zhuoyun. He is preparing for Yu Ang\u2019s eighteenth-year Coming of Age Ceremony. Our Bo City has always placed a great importance on the Coming of Age ceremony, and a big family clan like the Mu Family would definitely set up their most important disciple\u2019s Ceremony to be grander than anything,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said.\u201cI know, they will invite rich and powerful guests. All the people of importance within Bo City have been invited, families with status just enjoy doing this kind of stuff,\u201d Mo Fan said.\u201cBut this is so unfavorable toward you, this old scoundrel is obviously trying to cheat you. He\u2019s using you as a stepping stone for that guy Yu Ang. In any case, Brother Fan is currently the number one student of Tian Lan Magic High. If you were to lose the Magic Duel in front of the gazes of all these people, then not only will it give their family an awe-inspiring authority, but it would also mean that the number one student among the fifteen hundred at Tian Lan Magic High was not able to win against the student nourished by their family. Principal Zhu will not be able to leave that stage.\u201dPrincipal Zhu was the most important person in Tian Lan Magic High; he and Mu Zhuoyun could be said to be two old rivals in Bo City.The prestige of Principal Zhu in Bo City was very high; after all, he had earned the trust of the people. All of the grassroot Magicians who were outstanding were unable to succeed without Principal Zhu\u2019s support. Principal Zhu had used the school to dig up many brilliant Magicians with no background.Mu Zhuoyun was more of a typical case of a Magic Family clan. This basically meant the family was more specialized in nurturing their own disciples. By relying on the more outstanding children of the aristocrats, Mu Zhuoyun was able to obtain a long-standing position within Bo City.Every once in a while, the grassroot Magicians and the Clan Magicians would have a contest. The most important time for Mu Zhuoyun every year was when he saw the young Magicians from his own clan completely wipe out the students which Principal Zhu had nurtured from his public school, Tian Lan Magic High.Deng Kai and Principal Zhu were both completely on the side of the school. That was why when Mo Fan slandered Mu Zhuoyun, even if they hadn\u2019t settled the matter down to having a duel with a younger generation of the Mu Family, they would still somehow suppress this matter.A student who is able to take three S\u2019s in the annual examination, that would make him the school\u2019s treasure. How could they let the tyrant Mu Zhuoyun suppress him?After hearing that Mo Fan had smoothly eliminated the summoned beast that went berserk, both Principal Zhu and Deng Kai increasingly felt like they had obtained a treasure.Mo Fan himself didn\u2019t know that Principal Zhu and Deng Kai had always been meticulous about him. The two of them, who put great importance on the grassroot Magicians, had always arranged for people to watch over him.However, a school was still a school, they couldn\u2019t be selfish. They also wanted to give a Stardust Magic Tool to Mo Fan so he could use it all the time. However, they couldn\u2019t be like an ancestral family, favoring one and discriminating against the others!\u2014\u2014When the time arrived for Yu Ang\u2019s holiday-like Coming-of-Age ceremony, Principal Zhu and Deng Kai finally couldn\u2019t help themselves, and called Mo Fan to the Principal\u2019s office.Mo Fan had met Deng Kai before, he had stood up to help Mo Fan before. He was the boss of Bo City\u2019s Hunters Union. He was even stronger than the Intermediate Mage Yang Zuohe!Principal Zhu was someone Mo Fan was meeting for the first time. This old Principal who held a prestigious status in the hearts of the students and their parents actually seemed to have the aura of a hermit. However, when there were big things happening, he would still come out and take charge.\u201cMo Fan, there are some matters we need to discuss with you seriously,\u201d Deng Kai took the lead to say.Mo Fan stood there as he listened attentively.\u201cThe truth is, every now and them, the students of our Tian Lan Magic High and the disciples of the Mu Family will have a session of interaction. In past years, we would always pick the most outstanding one from among the students, and the student with the strongest combat ability would fight against the disciples of Bo City\u2019s families\u2026 Originally, we had put our hopes on Xu Zhaoting; after all, he is a rare Lightning Mage, and thus, he had a higher chance of success in this contest. However, on the annual examination, you had very good grades, and were even presumptuous enough to provoke their family. In order to prevent Mu Zhuoyun from making your life difficult, we intentionally moved the matter toward this fight that was already bound to happen,\u201d Deng Kai sincerely said to Mo Fan.\u201cI know\u2026 Oh, what I meant to say is, thank you, to you two directors, for helping me out of an embarrassing situation,\u201d Mo Fan said.\u201cTo be honest, we have already helped you delay the time by two years. The growth that you have achieved within these two years has been noted in our hearts. But, you still need to pay the cost for being so rude back then.\u201d Deng Kai helplessly shook his head.Deng Kai had already obtained some information from other people. Yu Ang\u2019s cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds in these two years. Additionally, he had real combat practice provided by the family. Even if Mo Fan was more clever, he still might not be Yu Ang\u2019s opponent. Everyone knew that he was lucky when he had killed the summoned beast back then.The principal sighed. \u201cMo Fan, we also know that the heavens are sometimes unfair; they sometimes give people privileges from birth, where others get nothing. However, this does not mean that you can blame the gods and accuse others and boldly vent out the resentments in your heart. Although you may have spoken out about your discontent to these superior characters, and there are many who want to do the same, those words also signify that you are putting yourself on the edge of the abyss. When your strength is far from being capable of contending against a big family like this, swallowing your anger is not a bad thing,\u201d Principal Zhu said with sincere and earnest wishes.Principal Zhu had been a principal for so many years, and had seen many haughty students. Some of them really did accomplish a lot, and had become Magicians who many revered. Some others, however, had sunk so far that they were never heard of again.Talent was important, cultivating was important, but the most important thing was to judge the size of the situation. Don\u2019t do unnecessary things, the school was only able to provide protection for a few years. After joining society, only the words of those at the top mattered.\u201cThank you for the guidance, I was indeed too willful back then,\u201c Mo Fan nodded.\u201cThe reason as to why we called here today naturally isn\u2019t for educating you\u2026 We actually do hope for you to be victorious in the duel this time, and that is because the winner will obtain a chance to cultivate at Bo City\u2019s sole Underground Holy Spring,\u201d Principal Zhu continued.\u201cUnderground Holy Spring??\u201d Mo Fan\u2019s eyes immediately brightened.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It appeared that the One-eyed Magic Wolf from that time had stolen the energy from the Underground Holy Spring, and it had almost evolved into an even higher rank. From that, it was evident that the Underground Holy Spring was the heavenly treasure of Bo City. Even the Magical Beasts would sneak into the dangerous areas where humans dwelled to steal it.\u201cOur Bo City naturally has some special resources, they are specially provided for those who are on the verge of entering the Magic Universities\u2026 Unfortunately, the Underground Holy Spring is an extremely limited resource.

This student isn\u2019t just simply chosen from a school, but the Magic Clans and Ancestral Families also have to fight for the spot,\u201d Principal Zhu said.After saying this, Deng Kai couldn\u2019t help but give off a bitter smile, \u201cPrincipal Zhu, we haven\u2019t had the qualifications to take that spot for many years, I feel like it is always taken by the disciples of the Clans and Families.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not strange at all. The Ancestral Families and Clans are able to focus their resources into a single outstanding disciple. Additionally, the nurturing and training which they can obtain is not something our egalitarian school can compete with.\u201d Principal Zhu seemed quite calm; it appeared he was already indifferent about this matter.\u201cMo Fan, the outcome of this battle is not something you need to put any importance on. Having you realize the might of a disciple from an Ancestral Family is also good. In the future, you will be able to stay calmer on the road of cultivation, and work even harder. As for the revenge from the Mu Family, that won\u2019t be something you need to worry about. After you enter a Magic University, they naturally won\u2019t be able to touch you that easily, and if you were to remain in Bo City, then we are still quite willing to continue carrying on nurturing you,\u201d Deng Kai said.After hearing the two teachers words, Mo Fan felt somewhat moved.No wonder why Principal Zhu and Deng Kai had such prestige within the hearts of the students and their parents. It seemed like they had always been on the side of the common students. They were willing to protect the common students, even from the Ancestral Families and Clans. These kind of people were hard to find, one had to know that the school directors of many other public schools would try to curry favors with the strong.\u201cAlright, the competition is the day after tomorrow; adjust your mindset and perform properly. Even if winning against this Yu Ang who has been carefully nurtured by the Mu Family is impossible, the duel this time is still an opportunity for you. It is not an everyday occurrence that you can gather so many important people of Bo City to watch youngsters have a duel.\u201d\u201cMhm, even after you enter an University, a Magician\u2019s advancement requires a large amount of resources. If you can find someone of influence to watch over you before you enter University, and who is willing to subsidize you, then it will be much better for you after you enter University. After all, the competition amongst the Magicians in the Universities are even fiercer. If you don\u2019t have anything, then you won\u2019t be a match for those students who have an even stronger power behind them,\u201d Principal Zhu told Mo Fan.The two teachers didn\u2019t say anything useless. In fact, they were telling Mo Fan the answers to questions that he would encounter in the future. They hoped for Mo Fan to understand that the road of Magicians wasn\u2019t that simple.Mo Fan once again expressed his thanks to the two teachers.\u2014\u2014The time went past very quickly. The Mu Family was in their manor as they wildly beat their gongs and drums.Mo Fan walked out of the school, he raised his head up at an angle as he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in sorrow. _Shit, three years have gone past so fast!__It\u2019s not long before I will have to leave this school gate.__Three years ago, I walked out of middle school. Three years later, I\u2019m on the verge of walking out of this high school._The school gates had numerous cars parked there today. Most of them were here to pick up their adorable Mage children and return home. The school had given the students ten days of self-cultivation time in order to welcome the Magic High Exams that happened after those ten days.But before the Magic High Exams, Mo Fan naturally still had his duel.In fact, he had been waiting far too long for this day to arrive!He could not forget the high horse attitude which Mu He had displayed when he snatched away their family house, nor his father Mo Jiaxing\u2019s low and petty action that caused Mo Fan\u2019s heart to tighten.He would definitely not forget Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s conceited attitude from two years ago. A long time ago, he had treated them as a dog as he drove them out; yet, on that day, he threw a bone and called Mo Fan back, expecting him to come. Was he born into this society to be controlled at the very bottom by the guys who tyrannically abused him?No one should be born to be someone else\u2019s slave, unless they were willing to lick the shoes of their owner!The him of yesterday was indeed not even worth mentioning, a clown with a mouse as sideshow. Tomorrow, he would enter the gates of the Mu Family and rely on the cultivation which he had bitterly worked on for so many years to defeat the disciple which they had carefully nurtured and let this fool understand what it meant to start a great fire with just a tiny spark!\u2014\u2014\u201cMo Fan, Mo Fan!\u201d a familiar middle aged man yelled toward him.\u201cFather, how come you\u2019re here?\u201d Mo Fan asked as he lowered his head, astonished.\u201cI heard that the school is giving you guys a self-study holiday, so I came here to pick you up.\u201d Mo Jiaxing revealed a spotless row of teeth, his face filled with a silly smile.It felt like he had returned to three years ago when he had walked out from failing the exams. It had also been filled with cars by the gates, and his father, Mo Jiaxing, had been waiting with the crowd, his face sweating.The difference was that Mo Jiaxing was more tanned and skinny, Mo Fan didn\u2019t even need to ponder to understand that his father had been running all over the place for the family in the past three years.The other difference was that Mo Fan himself had gone from a student who was lagging behind the others to a Magician who had grasped the Lightning and Fire element!At the very least, he was worthy to face Mo Jiaxing\u2019s decision to send him to the Magic School without hesitation!\u201cFather, you don\u2019t need to work so hard. Didn\u2019t I transfer a bit of money over to you?\u201d When Mo Fan saw his father this tanned, he began to feel bad.\u201cYou can keep your money to yourself, a Magician needs a lot of money. I have heard from the old Mages in the stronghold saying that there is something called a Stardust Magic Tool that is able to increase the speed of your cultivation. I\u2019ll see if I can raise some money to buy you one, this way you\u2019ll have something when you enter University, or else what would you have to compete against those other kids from the big cities?\u201d Mo Jiaxing said with a smile.Mo Fan was momentarily speechless.Magic had replaced science, yet, Mo Jiaxing was still like a common father, pure and blunt.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that thing has already been provided to me by the school. Don\u2019t worry, take that money and go check out houses with little aunt when you have time. You don\u2019t have to buy it, you can just rent one for now,\u201d Mo Fan said.This year Mo Fan had hunted quite a few beasts, their commission was considerable, from 120-130k RMB.This money was not enough to buy Magic Equipment, nor Magical Tools, but it was enough to allow his father to rest for a period of time and relieve the pressure of their finances.The truth is, Mo Fan didn\u2019t know how to tell his father Mo Jiaxing that a Stardust Magical Tool was actually really, really expensive. It was not something he could afford even if he were to work hard for a few years; this thing was something he couldn\u2019t buy even if he were to work hard for several lifetimes.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re entering University soon, who would be staying in that house? It\u2019s better if Xinxia is at your Little Aunt\u2019s, us big men would have a hard time taking care of her. I give your Little Aunt some money every month\u2026 Speaking of which, the card you gave me has about a hundred or so thousand, plus I have around eighty thousand saved from running all over the place, in total there is two hundred thousand. It\u2019s enough to buy a piece of Magical Equipment, right? I heard that thing is extremely important for Magicians,\u201d Mo Jiaxing continued.\u201cI already have a Magical Equipment!\u201d\u201cOh, oh! I almost forget, you obtained a Magical Tool from Zhankong. Honestly, you\u2019re really giving face to your father. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve heard the old hunters in the stronghold talk about that matter!\u201d Speaking of this thing, Mo Jiaxing\u2019s face was brimming brilliantly as he just now realized it had already been a year.\u201cTomorrow, I will go to Mu Manor to have a Magic Duel with someone called Yu Ang,\u201d Mo Fan said sincerely to his father.\u201cI know, I know. I have implored some elders in Mu Family to have Yu Ang go easier on you. Either way, you\u2019re only there to give some luck to his Coming-of-Age Ceremony. Being able display yourself in front of so many powerful and influential people of Bo City is also extremely rare for you. Speaking of which, I wonder how you even thought of this kind of outstanding method back then\u2026 Anyway, don\u2019t offend Master Mu again, he is still unhappy about the thing between you and Mu Ningxue back then. You little brat, so young yet the pearl of a family almost eloped with you!\u201d Mo Jiaxing said.Mo Jiaxing didn\u2019t blame Mo Fan for the thing that had happened in the past.Mo Fan was too young back then, doing a few stupid things was only normal. Furthermore, the biggest problem didn\u2019t lie in his own son, the problem was the other family was too powerful.Sigh, if only Mu Ningxue was the daughter of a common family; that way, he\u2019d have gained a daughter-in-law. This little brat didn\u2019t have any redeeming qualities, yet, his ability in swindling a lady back when he was a child was outstanding!The Magic Duel this time was seen as a incredibly good thing by Mo Jiaxing.Many other disciples who had better better circumstances than Mo Fan were very eager to appear at this incomparably grand Coming-of-Age Ceremony. Even if they were only there to enhance Yu Ang, it was still a supreme honor. For a fool like Mo Fan, this kind of opportunity was indeed very good, as long as this Mo Fan didn\u2019t have the intention to actually fight for the outcome of the battle. What kind of a background did the other person have? If they were able to be the supporting character, that\u2019d be fine, as well! If Yu Ang really became a great character of Bo City in the future, then they\u2019d at least be able to say \u201cI fought with him once before!\u201d\u201cFather, I will be able to win!\u201d Mo Fan said sincerely.\u201cDon\u2019t be too ambitious, I am already very satisfied with the grades you have gotten now,\u201d Mo Jiaxing said as he patted Mo Fan\u2019s shoulder while laughing.Seeing Mo Jiaxing\u2019s attitude, Mo Fan\u2019s heart was somewhat puzzled._Why do you guys think I am going there to be someone else\u2019s cannon fodder?_\u2014\u2014The Mu Family\u2019s invitations had been sent ages ago. The entire Mu Manor was already surrounded by their distinguished friends and high-class crowds. The employees of Mu Manor were extremely busy; even a stray weed in the flowerbed would cause a huge fuss before they fixed it.Mu Zhuoyun went overboard for the Coming-of-Age Ceremony this time, making sure everyone in Bo City knew about it.Mo Fan had wondered in the past why Mu Zhuoyun had set him to fight against Yu Ang. It seemed like the cunning sly fox had actually planned this whole thing; adding a little good luck charm to the grand banquet this time.Just drinking and eating would have no meaning. Watching the younger generation duel was better. Not only would he be able to deal with a sewer rat like Mo Fan beneath the gazes of everyone, but it would also give his Mu Family some face; what reason would he have to not go through with it?To be honest, Mo Fan really hadn\u2019t thought that the old scoundrel Mu Zhuoyun would give it such wide publicity.Perhaps it really was as Principal Zhu and Deng Kai had said; this was a contest between the disciples of an ancestral family and the students from school.The current Mo Fan was no longer the student with the best grades within Tian Lan Magic High in name only. There was a chance that even if he hadn\u2019t inconvenienced Master Mu, he still would have ended up battling against the disciple of the ancestral family._That\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll deal with the new and old grudges at same time!_\u201cOld scoundrel, since you gave it such a wide publicity, then this daddy, I will make you lose face!\u201d Mo Fan stood in front of his old house, as he raised his head to look at the Mu Manor that was decorated with lanterns and colored banners as it lit up splendidly. It brought a cold smile to his face.\u2014\u2014On top of the Manor, Mu Zhuoyun suddenly sneezed.He was currently sitting inside the tea room as he rubbed his moustache, his face filled with glory as he looked at Mu Ningxue, who had returned a while ago due to summer holidays.\u201cThis Coming-of-Age Ceremony was originally prepared for you. However, your father, I, didn\u2019t think that you were far more outstanding than what we had imagined. This tiny Bo City is no longer something you need to contend for. This Coming-of-Age Ceremony will be given to Yu Ang; he is loyal to our family. In the future, he can become your right-hand when you contest against the disciples of other elemental ancestor families!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun said.For his daughter, Mu Zhuoyun had actually gone through a lot of trouble.\u201cWhy are you still holding onto him so tightly? Even if you wanted to let Yu Ang obtain the opportunity of Underground Holy Spring the proper way, you could still have chosen someone else.\u201d Finally, Mu Ningxue couldn\u2019t help but open her mouth.The him Mu Ningxue was pointing at was naturally Mo Fan.\u201cThat little scoundrel slandered me in front of so many people, how could I possibly forgive him? Doesn\u2019t he think that he\u2019s noble and virtuous, doesn\u2019t he think that he\u2019s amazing? How is it inappropriate of me to give him such an exceptionally good opportunity? I have already arranged it, when the time comes, you just need to sit next to me and watch.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s mood immediately changed when this matter was brought up._Still protecting that kid at this time?_Mu Zhuoyun did not understand. There were so many outstanding disciples from these large ancestral families, yet she didn\u2019t say more than a sentence to them. She just had to care about a poor kid who didn\u2019t know how to admit his mistakes and had no abilities whatsoever.\u201cThen tell Yu Ang to stop before he goes too far!\u201d Mu Nignxue knew that her father wouldn\u2019t budge a single step on this matter, thus, she also spoke of her own bottom line.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have morals. I only want to let this kid who doesn\u2019t know the difference between heaven and earth to understand that the dignity which I stomped on doesn\u2019t mean anything. Whereas tomorrow, he will understand that being completely defeated beneath the gazes of everyone is truly losing all his face!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun couldn\u2019t help but smile._Little thing, you want to play with me, Mu Zhuoyun? When I shook the whole of Bo City, you were still inside your mother\u2019s womb!__I, Mu Zhuoyun, have a variety of ways to make you unable to raise your head again within Bo City!________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The mountains outside of the city were endless.Tomorrow was the day that was extremely important to his life.The children of poor people didn\u2019t have a Coming-of-Age Ceremony. However, from everyone else\u2019s perspective, he already had a decent Coming-of-Age Ceremony, being the supportive role to the disciple of a rich family.From everyone else\u2019s perspective, he was undoubtedly crouching on the floor, acting like a footpad for Yu Ang\u2019s shiny leather shoes, so that Yu Ang could appear even more outstanding amongst his peers.However, was that really true?Lifting the beer in his hand, Mo Fan raised his head to pour the ice cold beer down his throat.In front of him was a tall tower. The hundred-meter tall Global Trade Center was towering in front of him. It was like a prominent sword loftily erected in the center of the city, with glorious lights.Mo Fan sat on the balcony with the wind drifting onto him. In the past, he had really enjoyed sitting here. He was able to see all of the flourishing scenery of Bo City; the Global Trade Center, Mu Manor, Bo River, and Tian Lan Magic High, located on the southern mountain.He was feeling rather rueful. Behind him came the sound of footsteps, rhythmic and slow.An ice-cold wind blew over from behind him, Mo Fan didn\u2019t need to turn around to know who it was.\u201cI asked Xinxia, she told me you were here,\u201d the girl\u2019s bright voice called out. If it wasn\u2019t so cold and detached, then her voice would be as beautiful as a silver bell on a snowy day.\u201cLooking for me this late at night? I won\u2019t be able to elope with you this time.\u201d Mo Fan grabbed a paper used to wrap peanuts and put it next to him, signifying someone should sit there.Mu Ningxue stood there, watching Mo Fan\u2019s familiar movements as she remembered some things from the past.When she was young, he would take her to some bizarre places to play. No matter where he went, he was able to sit on the floor, whereas she would be afraid of dirtying her beautiful skirts, so she\u2019d refuse to sit. At some point, he started to find something clean to put down next to him; even his jacket was a victim, although his jacket sometimes would be filthy.\u201cDon\u2019t go tomorrow, Yu Ang will be harsh on you. He listens to my father\u2019s every direction. Anyone who harms my father, even if it is just cursing at him, he will harbor grudges toward, and he will not stop until you die.\u201d Mu Ningxue didn\u2019t walk over, she just stood there as she said this to Mo Fan.\u201cYour father sure adopted a good dog, I reckon he\u2019d bite anyone your father wants him to.\u201d Mo Fan didn\u2019t have a favorable opinion of Yu Ang.\u201cHe\u2019s really odd, I don\u2019t like him, either,\u201d Mu Ningxue agreed.\u201cThen that\u2019s good, I\u2019ll help you educate him tomorrow,\u201d Mo Fan said with a smile.\u201cDo you not understand me? I don\u2019t want you to go tomorrow.\u201d Mu Ningxue wrinkled her eyebrows.\u201cMiss, have you reached the Intermediate rank yet?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go tomorrow. After avoiding this, go to Magic University immediately. During the time you\u2019re in University, I will slowly take control of the authority of my family, so when you return to Bo City, no one will do anything to you.\u201d\u201cYou want to provide for me? But I will still go.\u201d Mo Fan turned around as he acted surprised.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mu Ningxue was so angry that her chest heaved up and down.She sincerely wanted to help him, yet, he was playing such a joke on her! _Doesn\u2019t he know that offending my father means that he will have no place in Bo City!?_Mu Ningxue realized she was unable to get through to Mo Fan. Thus, she turned around and left.\u2014\u2014\u201cBrother Fan, I heard that Little Princess was looking for you,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou asked through a text.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cShe still admires me, she wanted me to understand the tyrannical and cruel guy named Yu Ang.\u201d\u201cSpeak normally, please.\u201d\u201cAlright, she wants me to run in order to avoid dying, hahaha!\u201d\u201cBrother Fan, I also suggest you run, Yu Ang is abnormal. His entire being is odd.\u201d\u2014\u2014The day arrived in the end.Mo Fan, who had stayed at his Little Aunt Mo Qing\u2019s house, heard the sounds of festivities early in the morning from the Mu Manor not too far from him.One after another, luxurious cars followed the curvy mountain road as they entered Mu Manor. Who knew whether Mo Fan, who was going there by motorbike, was losing face for the title of \u201cYu Ang\u2019s Opponent.\u201dJust when he was about to enter the large iron gates, Mo Fan saw a few familiar figures.\u201cLi Wenjie, Feishi, you\u2019re finally here. Hurry up and come in, our Manor has some of the best chefs of Bo City, I guarantee it will suit your tastes.\u201d Guo Caitang stood by the gates as she welcomed her team members.\u201cHahaha, thanks to you, we, the small City Officers are able to have the opportunity to come to this wealthy Ancestral Family\u2019s home and take a look.\u201d Feishi patted his growling stomach.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that kid Fan Mo had some matters to attend to, so he was unable to come. Or else you could let him understand your extravagant life, and when the time comes, he will definitely pursue you without stopping!\u201d Li Wenjie added.Guo Caitang glared ferociously at Li Wenjie.Guo Caitang actually felt somewhat disappointed. She actually really wanted to invite Fan Mo to her own house._Eh, it\u2019s Fan Mo?_Guo Caitang\u2019s gaze suddenly turned to see a familiar figure. After looking carefully, Guo Caitang immediately felt a twitchy loathing._How is that Fan Mo, it obviously is that little scoundrel, Mo Fan.__I really don\u2019t know where this kid got his guts from, he is actually having a duel with Yu Ang! No matter what, he\u2019s going to be beaten half to death._\u201cHmph, you came?\u201d Guo Caitang looked at Mo Fan sideways, arrogant was not enough to describe her appearance.\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no other place to eat breakfast,\u201d Mo Fan said with a ruffian-like attitude.Guo Caitang got angry; this little scoundrel was making Mu Manor into a buffet!\u201cIf you apologize now, I will tell Yu Ang to go easier on you,\u201d Guo Caitang snorted coldly.\u201cYou\u2019re still brooding over the things that happened when we were young. In that case, how about I take responsibility for it? It\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Mo Fan said.\u201cGo die!\u201dAfter Mo Fan finished teasing Guo Caitang, he laughed as he walked toward Mu Manor.In any case, he was an important character for today, so he should have his own seat. _Forget it, there\u2019s so much to eat, let\u2019s start with everything._\u201cWho is this haughty kid?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the disciple of an ancestral family, he even dares to assail our sister Caitang with obscenities.\u201d\u201cWhat ancestral family, it\u2019s just the son of a chauffeur. The one who cursed our Master Mu, and the one who is having a Magic Duel with Yu Ang today is precisely him,\u201d Guo Caitang snarled, full of disdain.\u201cAre all the teenagers nowadays that arrogant?\u201d\u201cNot all of them, if you look at the Fan Mo in our team, Lightning element with a solid strength. Young, yet not arrogant. Caitang, I advise you to grab Fan Mo as soon as possible. If he is taken by some other girl\u2026\u201d Feishi said once more.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about useless stuff! Hmph, I invited him to my home this time, yet he actually didn\u2019t come, who would understand him!\u201d Guo Caitang\u2019s cheeks turned red as she hurriedly explained herself in a low voice.________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his heart, he thought about what kind of expressions they would have if they knew that Fan Mo and Mo Fan were the same person._Forget it, let\u2019s focus on the matters of the duel today._Entering Mu Manor\u2019s large dinner hall, there were indeed numerous tasty delicacies being placed on the table. Mo Fan, who was just getting hungry, was about to start eating before he came face-to-face with a handsome mustachioed man who was surrounded by young, unmarried women.\u201cGood brat, you really dare to join the banquet!\u201d the mustachioed man glared at Mo Fan.\u201cHead Instructor, you\u2019re also here to eat and drink for free?\u201d Mo Fan didn\u2019t think that Head Instructor Zhankong would be here as well.\u201c _Cough_ , what are you saying!\u201d the mustached Zhankong broke loose from the crowd of young women. He pulled Mo Fan to the side as he asked with his eyebrows cocked, \u201cHow about it, why don\u2019t you join my army when you graduate? If you are able to enter a good Magic University, then our army will be able to support whatever the cost of your Magic University is. I know that you brat has caused trouble for the master. The government can protect you, and guarantee that you will be able to stomp on these second generations if you aren\u2019t satisfied! We will clean up your mess!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time Zhankong wanted to pull Mo Fan into the army, and it was very hard to say if it was only to have Mo Fan give back the precious Bone Scythe Shield.\u201cNo, protecting the borders everyday is boring, I still wanna take a stroll around the big cities,\u201d Mo Fan rejected him.\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about a large city? Reinforced concrete, vehicle emissions, and putrid stench. How is it better than our large stronghold with enchanting scenery, bird songs, and fragrant flowers? If you\u2019re not satisfied with the meals, then you could go to the outside and hunt a few Magical Beasts to bring back home to eat, how free is that?\u201d Zhankong said, his face filled with smiles.\u201cEither way, I\u2019m not enlisting,\u201d Mo Fan replied with certainty.\u201cAlright, alright, you brat sure is unyielding. If you nod your head today, then this Head Instructor will definitely help you settle any big matters in the future. Since it\u2019s like this, then I won\u2019t care even if you get beaten half dead by that guy Yu Ang.\u201d Zhankong started getting angry.With Zhankong\u2019s reputation, he could get any young Magicians he wanted, they all begged him to take them in, yet this kid didn\u2019t even give him any attention!As Mo Fan was about to walk away, Zhankong\u2019s pressed his finger onto Mo Fan\u2019s shoulders.\u201cHead Instructor, what is the meaning of this? Are you going to make me join by force?\u201d Mo Fan asked in confusion.At this moment, Zhankong had retracted that vulgar yet handsome uncle appearance, between his eyebrows showed a hint of seriousness as he whispered, \u201cNot joining my team is fine, but help me with one small matter.\u201d\u201cWhat matter?\u201d Mo Fan was puzzled.\u201cWhen you battle that kid Yu Ang, be mindful.\u201d\u201cMindful of what?\u201d\u201cJust be more mindful.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Before Mo Fan could inquire more, two middle-aged men and women who looked important were walking over.They appeared to be familiar with Zhankong. Zhankong immediately smiled as he greeted them.Mo Fan was completely confused, he didn\u2019t know what Zhankong wanted him to do.\u2014\u2014Not too long after, Principal Zhu, Deng Kai, Yang Zuohe, and the more important characters of Bo City began to appear. Mu Zhuoyun personally brought Yu Ang along to greet all of them.Principal Zhu represented the Magic School, he was the Mt Tai of all the Magic Schools in Bo City.Deng Kai was the head of Hunters Union, his position was naturally aloof.Yang Zuohe represented the Magic Association, his power approached the previous two.The one representing the Military was Zhankong, and it could be said that he was the strongest Magician in this crowd of people, and the true God of War of Bo City!Mu Zhuoyun didn\u2019t need any introductions, he was the head of this Elemental family!Mo Fan unexpectedly realized that he had met all these important characters of Bo City. Did that mean he himself was also an important character?_(Ed. Note: Sure, it\u2019s all about you, Mr. MC)_The fact is, Mo Fan also knew that he was quite a distance away from that group of people. He was able to easily receive the attention of these people at the top of the ladder because of his identity as a student who excelled beyond the common. Once he entered society, and the great tides washed by, he reckoned that they would quickly forget about him.The three instructors, Luo Yunbo, Pan Lijun, and Baiyang, were also participating. Based on what Mo Fan had found out from the mouths of those veterans at the stronghold, these three Instructor\u2019s powers were a bit stronger than the Hunter Team\u2019s Captain, Xu Dahuang. They were all people who were approaching Intermediate Mage.The truth is, those who had reached Intermediate Magician in Bo City could be counted as impressive. Any power would try to offer a powerful person benefits to rope them in.Frankly speaking, if Mo Fan were to reach Intermediate Magician, then Mu Zhuoyun would no longer dare to cause trouble for him. The number of Intermediate Mages in Bo City could be counted on two hands.\u2014\u201cMu Zhuoyun really went all out this time, he invited so many people here. It feels like those who have the slightest bit of prestige are invited, and they came here to give old Zhuoyun enough face.\u201d Inside the banquet, there were already a few people whispering.\u201cHow could that be, the Mu Family has already produced Mu Ningxue, their future position won\u2019t be at the same level as it is currently. Who doesn\u2019t know that old Zhuoyun will quickly be able to cover the skies with his hands? Today, he will introduce his little tyrant of Bo City. Thus, if you want to be able to make something out of yourself in Bo City in the future, how could you not come? If you don\u2019t come despite being invited, then I reckon you\u2019ll be dragged onto the blacklist,\u201d a man who looked like he should be from the Magic Association whispered.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit exaggerated?\u201d another person asked.\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s definitely true. Look at us, at what age did we cultivate to Intermediate Mage level, and then look at Mu Ningxue, how old is she? From that, you can tell the amount of power the Mu Family will be able to grasp in the future.\u201cThat\u2019s why other than Boss Zhankong, someone who has transcended beyond common people like us, everyone will have to treat old Zhuoyun with respect. I really don\u2019t understand what that foolish brat called Mo Fan is really thinking. Even we have to say yes to everything Mu Zhuoyun says, yet he talks back\u2026 He really doesn\u2019t want to stay in Bo City!\u201c _Sigh_ , that\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019ve heard that Mu Ningxue and Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s relationship isn\u2019t too good. If Mu Ningxue says to not touch someone, then Mu Zhuoyun can\u2019t be too excessive.\u201d\u201cYeah, besides, I\u2019ve heard that kid Mo Fan is the student with the highest grades in Tian Lan Magic High, and he obtained the backing of Boss Zhankong during his Practicals. Principal Zhu and Deng Kai would definitely protect this kind of student. Even if the two don\u2019t want to offend Mu Zhuoyun, Boss Zhankong wouldn\u2019t care about that. Who has Boss Zhankong ever been scared of? Whoever touches his soldiers, he would crush everything on his way to their home!\u201dAs Feishi realized these people were discussing this, he immediately went up to them to join them.Not long after, Feishi came back. Xiaoke was curious, so she asked Feishi, \u201cBrother Feishi, why is everyone discussing the matter of Yu Ang and that person called Mo Fan?\u201d\u201cOh, I also just found out. Mo Fan is representing the strength of Magic Schools to a certain degree. He will be using the identity of a student of a Magic School to duel against Yu Ang, who is a disciple of an Ancestral Family. The winner would naturally obtain an opportunity to cultivate at the extremely super ultra precious Underground Holy Spring of Bo City,\u201d Feishi explained.\u201cSo it\u2019s like that, I heard that it has been many years since a student from a Magic School has entered the Underground Holy Spring.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s normal, the schools have many students to tend. Having one or two incredible geniuses appearing occasionally counts as a good harvest. The disciples of the Ancestral Families are the Elites; they may not have as many people as the schools, but they are all Elites. It won\u2019t be too weird if that person called Mo Fan becomes the stepping stone for someone else today,\u201d\u201cIt feels quite lamentable, an outstanding student who emerged victorious from fifteen hundred people is still not better than someone from an Ancestral Family,\u201d Xiaoke sighed. \u201cBeing born into a good family is a skill.\u201d____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As it turns out, it is actually a duel between the powers of Bo City._This battle was indeed not a bad thing for him. Perform well during the duel and he\u2019d make a name for himself, that\u2019s not bad at all!\u201cZhoumin, Xiaohou, He Yu, Zhang Yinglu, Xu Zhaoting, Wang Sanpang\u2026 How come you guys are here too?\u201d Mo Fan suddenly discovered a group of relatively young figures. It turned out they were his classmates.\u201cThe school had a few spots, and Mu Bai helped getting us in here. It\u2019s not every day that you see the school\u2019s number one expert fight with the disciple of an Ancestral Family, how could we not come and see?\u201d Xu Zhaoting sounded a bit sour.To Xu Zhaoting, a great Lightning element user, this spot was originally his. In the end, it was stolen by Mo Fan, who killed his way here.However, after what happened during Practicals, Xu Zhaoting\u2019s scorn towards Mo Fan was no longer as fierce as it once was. Everyone\u2019s lives were basically saved by Mo Fan. In fact, he was actually hoping Mo Fan would perform brilliantly during the duel this time, so he could regain some face for the Magic Schools.\u201cBrother Fan, I just saw Uncle Mo Jiaxing\u2019s name on the invitation list. I reckon it was done by that guy Mu He,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said.\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\u201cMo Fan, you need to do your best,\u201d Zhoumin said with a pure smile.Mo Fan nodded.The Mo Fan from two years would never have imagined that his duel would turn into such a passionate topic among the crowds today._That is also good, the feelings of having so many eyes on you is also a once in a lifetime experience, it\u2019s way better than being in the dark with no one knowing of you!_\u2014\u201cEveryone, everyone, I\u2019m thankful for everyone who made it here to congratulate my son. Time always flies by so fast, some of us will definitely reach a point where we are unable to cast magic. Bo City\u2019s future will inevitably be seized by those younger, and ever more outstanding youths. You may think that I have invited everyone here for my son\u2019s Coming-of-Age Ceremony, that is a mistake. I have always believed in the students surpassing the master, I, Mu Zhuoyun, am only able to do this much for Bo City. I am only able to help preserve the current state of this Bo City that has given birth to many Magicians and outstanding, talented people. However, in the next ten to twenty years, Bo City will be in the hands of the young and will become even more prosperous. Becoming an increasingly more flourishing Mage City is definitely possible. Don\u2019t you think that I should be holding a majestic banquet for the future of Bo City, so everyone can witness it together?\u201d Mu Zhuoyun was the organizer, he raised the goblet with red wine as his face filled with a red aura to hint to the present guests.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s give a toast for the future of Bo City!\u201d Yang Zuohe was the first to stand up as he toasted Mu Zhuoyun.\u201cThe people present are all those who have the qualifications to discuss our Bo City. Master Mu Zhuoyun is not the only one who is looking forward to the future of our Bo City; this toast, I will drink all at once!\u201dThe present guests also stood up as they toasted before drinking it all.Among the people in the hall, Mo Fan discovered that Mrs. Tangyue, who was also present at the banquet, was feeling as sick as he was from what Mu Zhuoyun had said. She even rolled her eyes during the toast.He didn\u2019t know which part of Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s words Mrs. Tangyue was against.Realizing his ambitions, after this feast at the impassioned and mighty Mu Manor, so glorious that it was almost emitting golden rays, had ended, naturally, they welcomed the most important play of the day \u2014 the Magic Duel!Many of these people really did not come here to listen to Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s stereotypical speech. They just wanted to know whose family the Underground Holy Spring would fall on this year.There were numerous Magicians in Bo City who were at the Primary level and had only been able to use the same Magic, so much that their old hands began to develop calluses. Whereas how many were there exactly who had actually taken a step into the realm of Intermediate Mages?Stardust was unfathomable; some people displayed talents from the start, yet at the end of the day, they were unable to cross that threshold. Thus, those who had been Primary Magicians their whole lives could be found everywhere. Hence the heavenly treasure, the Underground Holy Spring, that was able to infinitely increase a Magician\u2019s chances to approach the Intermediate level, became a holy item everyone was yearning for even in their dreams\u2026Unfortunately, it was only opened to the younger generations of Magicians who were filled with unlimited possibilities. Furthermore, only one person could enter every year, and few could win against the disciple of a Ancestral Family.When Mo Fan was just a student, he didn\u2019t know that Bo City had this kind of heavenly treasure. He also didn\u2019t know that time being rude and impetuous would allow him to hit the cultivation opportunity which numerous people within Bo City were thirsting for.It seemed to comply with the saying: If you don\u2019t do your best, then you won\u2019t know how great your strength is.\u2014The time of the Magic Duel finally came. Mo Fan was already waiting in the inner arena of the Magic Duel after hearing the arrangements from Mu Zhuoyun.An elliptical center emerged in the duel arena; it was much bigger than the training grounds of the school. It approached the size of a sports stadium.On both sides were ascending seats, more than enough to contain today\u2019s invited guests from Bo City.Mo Fan was standing in the center of the duel arena. In fact, he had been standing there for a while.Yu Ang was late, it was clear that Mu Zhuoyun wanted to give him a gorgeous appearance on stage.This kind of feeling wasn\u2019t good.This made Mo Fan feel like he was in a bullfighter ring. He was the bull that was released into the ring so everyone could watch him, let the spectators understand what kind of weight this bull had, to see the sturdy physique and sharp bull horns. Then the leading role, the handsome and elegant matador, brilliantly enters the arena a little while later. All kinds of lighting begins to flicker and all kinds of applause screeches out\u2026\u2014\u201cMy son, that\u2019s right, that is my son.\u201d Mo Jiaxing was definitely optimistic, he was cheerfully telling the old employees of Mu Family at the side.\u201cNot bad, Old Mo, it could be said that you brought a change of fortune,\u201d a worker who dealt with the garden said.\u201cIs that right, as long as he doesn\u2019t get completely beaten. I have heard this Yu Ang is normally unusually fierce against his own brothers and sisters,\u201d a worker who was in charge of cleaning mentioned.\u201cThe youths are just testing their skills, how could they be fierce?\u201d Mo Jiaxing chuckled.In Mo Jiaxing\u2019s view, this was just a very common duel. He also thought that a great character like Mu Zhuoyun wouldn\u2019t have the mind of a child. The truth is, a lot of the people knew that Mu Zhuoyun wanted to stomp on this Mo Fan who didn\u2019t know the difference between heaven and earth.\u201cBets, I bet on this kid Mo Fan being beaten in a single move!\u201d\u201cShit, no matter what, he is still the number one student of Tian Lan Magic High, how could that be possible?\u201d\u201cI will bet on it either way, I have heard of Yu Ang\u2019s abilities many times before.\u201dAs everyone was incessantly discussing this, Yu Ang, who was wearing a unique garment, finally emerged.His clothes looked like they were made of leather, but at same time, they also looked like high quality silk. It was sparkling beneath the illumination of the lights. His entire person looked like a prince who was walking into his palace.In terms of the appearance, it was clear that they had put a lot of effort into it. This really caused a huge contrast with Mo Fan, who wore sandals to the arena.After Yu Ang wore high-class clothes, his entire demeanor had immediately risen by a few levels. Adding to his already tall stature and somewhat feminine traits, bedazzling a few girls was natural.On the snowy white clothes was a design that fused the family\u2019s ice magic diagram. Yu Ang brilliantly entered the arena, and the corner of his mouth displayed a confident smile that indicated that he was the main character today.____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wait for my signal to star,.\u201d Deng Kai said.Mo Fan and Yu Ang were facing each other as they both extended their arms.An wisp of ice condensed on Yu Ang\u2019s palm. At the instant Mo Fan shook hands with him, he could feel a cold air penetrating into the depths of his bone marrow.Mo Fan\u2019s response was quick, as his arm turned burning red. The flames were protecting his own flesh, arteries, and bones. With his face remaining the same, he raised his other hand to erect a middle finger toward Yu Ang.\u201cYou really are a little rat that doesn\u2019t know anything. However, that won\u2019t be a problem, I will freeze your brain that is filled with water; that way, it could perhaps make you more clear-headed.\u201d After Yu Ang let go of his hand, he turned around as he let out a cold laugh before taking his position.\u201cIdiot,\u201d Mo Fan replied.After returning to his designated place after turning around, Mo Fan subconsciously closed his eyes for a moment. He opened his eyes again as his gaze swept across his surroundings.When he had entered this manor, he had forgotten how many eyes he had seen that carried ridicule and sympathy, and there were many who were saying to him that he was incredibly brave yet the corners of their mouths let out a shallow smile of disdain that meant \u201cYou\u2019re overestimating your own strength, simply attempting the impossible.\u201dIn this world, there would always be someone who thought they were clever. Using the excuse of being experienced and with schadenfreude tendencies, they would judge you based on every action that appeared to be overstepping your boundaries. They themselves were trapped in a cage of mediocrity, and they were all living in a system they thought no one was able to jump out of. Thus, they thought and hoped for everyone to be the same as them. Furthermore, they used an opinionated and short-sighted belief to ridicule the people who dared to do anything more.These people loved to rejoice over other people\u2019s misfortunes, incessantly gossip, and show off their limited knowledge and sense of superiority\u2026Today was the day Mo Fan would make them all shut up!\u201cDuel, begin!\u201d As the command came, Deng Kai had thoroughly declared the beginning of the Magic Duel which Mo Fan had been waiting for for a long time.In the next second, Mo Fan\u2019s pupils instantly emitted scarlet fire rays. Within the fire rays could clearly be seen the seven flame stars, they quickly connected to each other to form a Star Path.Dazzling Star Path, magic come forth!A ball of flames ignited on top of Mo Fan\u2019s palm. The scorching flame sprites were excitedly jumping around, impatient to scorch all of the flammable materials in the surroundings!\u201cFire Burst, Scorch!\u201dThe speed of Mo Fan\u2019s completion of Star Path was fast, the people could still feel the sounds of Deng Kai\u2019s declaration of battle resounding within their ears.The adept casting naturally startled everyone present.\u201cIt seems like he\u2019s still got some ability, the problem is that this first level of Fire Burst is completely useless.\u201d\u201cStrange, hasn\u2019t this guy already grasped Fire Burst, Burning Bones? Why is he using the first level, Fire Burst, Scorch? The power of Burning Bones is much stronger than Scorch, since he already seized the opportunity of casting Magic first, why isn\u2019t he being more fierce?\u201d Instructor Luo Yunbo immediately revealed the suspicions in his heart.The people who somewhat knew of Mo Fan already knew that Mo Fan was the first person in the entire school to have grasped the second level of Primary Magic. The might of Fire Burst, Burning Bones had already been displayed back in Practicals. In this important duel, why did he decide to cast a Fire Burst, Scorch?On the other side, Yu Ang was not in a hurry at all. He stood there watching Mo Fan finishing his Star Path, it looked as though he was saying, \u201cSo what if you finish your Magic spell first?\u201d\u201cIce Spread!\u201d Yu Ang no longer waited, he also used his intent to control all of his stars.He was just as adept at it as Mo Fan. Spirals of cold air swirled around the expensive white clothing that Yu Ang wore.\u201cIce Spread, Coagulate!\u201dYu Ang continued to chant the name of his magic. In a split second, the entire duel arena\u2019s temperature abruptly dropped. It went from originally midsummer hot to a cold winter season.Snowflakes were floating, there were partially frozen layers of frost and ice motes fluttering through the air.The white snow of frost descended upon Mo Fan. With the speed of the Ice Spread\u2019s freezing, if Mo Fan were to stand more than three seconds within the area of the Ice Spread, the lower part of his body would definitely be frozen.Ice Spread was an extremely advantageous spell during a showdown.At the Primary caster level, only the Wind and Earth elements had any movement spells.The effect of Ice Spread had always been an entire area. Once it arrived and the snow frost fell to the ground, the Magician would have to escape from this area within three seconds or else they\u2019d be frozen stiff. The people who weren\u2019t fast enough were completely unable to escape from the frozen zone.Yu Ang\u2019s Ice Spread covered a large area around Mo Fan. Even if Mo Fan were to do all he could to run from it, he definitely could not escape the range of Ice Spread within three seconds. Thus, after 3 seconds, Mo Fan would become a human target.After that, Yu Ang would continue to cover the place with yet another layer of Ice Spread. Mo Fan would become an Ice Sculpture that would attract the laughter of the people in yet another three seconds.There was nothing to be done about it. Ice Element was basically a no-brainer when it came to dealing with slower Magicians and Magical Beasts. This was because Ice Spread was said to be the spell that required no technique within Primary Magic, yet was still very useful!\u201cShit, did this kid go crazy, why is he still standing there?\u201d\u201cIf it was me, I\u2019d just start running. The second you get frozen, it\u2019ll be over.\u201dMo Fan didn\u2019t run. If it were any other knowledgeable Magician facing Ice Spread, they would start moving so they wouldn\u2019t be easily frozen.\u201cYou want to freeze me?\u201d At this time, Mo Fan burst out with a smile.Mo Fan didn\u2019t throw the flames in his hands at Yu Ang. In fact, he was very clear that the small level one Fire spell was definitely not able to emerge victorious against Yu Ang. This Fire Burst: Scorch possessed another clever function!________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He already had the body of a Fire user, and thus, even if flames were to burn around his body, they would not affect him too much. Furthermore, there were still layers of ice accumulating under his feet. As the frost encountered Mo Fan\u2019s flames, it began to melt instantly!Raising his head as he stood there in the middle of the flames, Mo Fan had a smile on his face, carrying hints of provocation as he looked at Yu Ang.The Ice Spread that was everywhere had melted into water from the effects of Scorch. Mo Fan didn\u2019t even need to move to accomplish a state where he didn\u2019t need to worry about being frozen into an ice cube.\u201cUsing the Fire Burst, Scorch on his surroundings, thus removing the effects of being frozen from the Ice Spread. This guy is pretty clever!\u201d Mrs. Tangyue, who was seated in the audience, had a trace of a smile on her face.Even if the students from the Magic Schools had been learning Magic, their understanding toward the uses of Magic were still incredibly limited. Just like the Fire Burst spell, practically every fire student who cast Fire Burst would subconsciously use the Fire Burst to directly attack their foe\u2019s body by throwing it.In fact, the effects of Fire Burst\u2019s Scorch had many uses. For example, let\u2019s say if you cast it on a fixed area, causing it to ignite a continued fire, it would be able to turn into a Fire Wall that could seal roads and cut them off. If you were to do it like Mo Fan, directly allowing the flames to roll beneath his feet, relying on his natural resistance to fire, that would cause a layer of protection in the form of fire. The protection of these flames could at very least shatter the freezing effects of an Ice Mage\u2019s Ice Spread.\u201cA level 1 Fire Burst broke the level 2 Ice Spread\u2019s freezing effects. This is a little interesting,\u201d Principal Zhu nodded.During the stage where you were lacking in spells, being able to flexibly use what you had was a very profound skill.Clearly, on the first exchange, Mo Fan still occupied some advantage.\u201cMy turn.\u201d Mo Fan stood in the center of the flames that were protecting him, his Star Path connected once more inside his pupils.His speed of connecting the Star Paths was very quick, he casually grasped his hands.One more Fire Burst emerged on top of Mo Fan\u2019s palm, but the intensity of the flames this time was different. You could tell the Fire Burst that emerged within Mo Fan\u2019s hands was impetuous!\u201cFire Burst, Burning Bones!\u201dThe temperature of the raging flames increased, and a dazzling scarlet red Fire Ball was thrown out. It left behind a long flame remnant as it streaked across the line of sight of the spectators before it accurately fell toward Yu Ang.\u201cIt\u2019s the second level of Fire Burst! If you are touched by this, then you will definitely be directly burned into ashes!\u201dThe present number of knowledgeable people was not small in number. After they saw Mo Fan easily cast the second level of Fire Burst, their hearts began to billow.\u201cYu Ang\u2019s Ice Spread was broken, now he will be more passive,\u201d Guo Caitang said, slightly worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Mu He was the opposite.Mu Zhuoyun carried his accustomed smile, as though everything was under his control.Fire Burst: Burning Bones finally fell down. However, the people quickly realized that Yu Ang had suddenly accelerated, he actually moved four or five meters to the side when the flames approached him. The fast speed caused the people to feel dazzled. The people were astonished, as they had no idea how Yu Ang could suddenly change his location.As Mo Fan saw the Burning Bones flames land on a piece of empty ground, his brow creased slightly.He was able to see it clearly. This guy Yu Ang\u2019s leather shoes emitted a dim yellow light, and after that, Yu Ang acted like he had gained the Earth Ripple spell, his body shifted a few paces away.Shit, it was a piece of Magical Equipment!Magical Boots, an Earth Magic Equipment with the Earth Ripple spell!Having the earth element\u2019s Earth Ripple spell appearing out of nowhere caused the plan in Mo Fan\u2019s heart to go awry.Fortunately, this imprint spell within the Magic Equipment needed a Magic Stone every time you used it, and then you needed to recharge it to continue using it. Or else, Mo Fan didn\u2019t need to fight in this duel anymore. The flying speed of the Fire Burst was fast, but it still wouldn\u2019t be faster than the opponent\u2019s monstrous Earth Ripple movement.\u201cIf you think your little flames could cause me to be useless in front of you, then you are too naive. This farce that has been preserved for two years should end. I will let you live, or else I won\u2019t be able to see you kowtow in front of my adoptive father in front of the gaze of all these people!\u201d Yu Ang laughed like a maniac.Yu Ang raised his two hands, and in a split second, the entire field looked as though it was completely engulfed by a snowstorm. Driving snow descended from the sky, the cold pierced the bones and froze every object into an ice cube.The violent snow descended, the temperature rapidly fell. It fell so much that even the flames were unable to continue burning.This kind of cold, it was almost as though it froze the air!\u201cIce Spread, Blizzard!\u201dYu Ang was like a Snow Beast as he arrogantly stood in the middle of this incomparably concentrated snow.The entire duel arena was boundless, the cold snow was grim and ruthless, it was like a disaster had descended in winter. It didn\u2019t allow a way for any of the living things here to survive.The people sitting in the seats to the sides fell into a world of ice and snow. They subconsciously began to hug their own chests as their teeth began to shiver.\u201cHoly crap, the last time I met Yu Ang, he had only grasped Ice Spread: Coagulate. After not seeing him for a whole year, he has actually cultivated his Ice Spread to the realm of third level. Ice Spread: Blizzard is basically an ice disaster falling, extinguishing the flames! No matter where that kid called Mo Fan hides in this duel arena, he will still be frozen into an ice cube in just a matter of seconds!\u201d Feishi was unable to hold himself down no more as he yelled out.Feishi clearly remembered that when they were dealing with the One-eyed Magic Wolf, Yu Ang and Guo Caitang\u2019s cultivation were about the same. Up until now, Guo Caitang still hadn\u2019t grasped the third level of Ice Spread, yet Yu Ang had actually reached this realm. Just what kind of degree of cultivation speed was this?!\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. Can\u2019t you see that Mo Fan\u2019s protective fire has been extinguished? After the snow has completely fallen, we will be able to see a human-shaped ice sculpture,\u201d Li Wenjie exclaimed.Principal Zhu, Deng Kai, Yang Zuohe, etc were all feeling the same. The present guests were gasping one by one.Eighteen-years old, this was Yu Ang\u2019s eighteen-years old Coming-of-age Ceremony. Many old Magicians who had reached forty or fifty years old would brag about their second level of Ice Spread spell, yet he had reached eighteen years old and had already grasped a realm many Ice Magicians were unable to cross in their whole lives. They really had no idea of what to say.\u201cToday should be like this.\u201d\u201cMo Fan also has a Magical Equipment\u2026\u201d Instructor Luo Yuanbo noted.Zhankong shook his head, \u201cA Bone Scythe Shield is useless against a spell like Ice Spread.\u201dThe Bone Scythe Shield was actually a really good defensive Magical Equipment, but so what if its defensive ability was stronger than the Ice element? Either way, the copper-clad iron bone would still be turned into an ice sculpture beneath the Ice Spread.Mo Fan\u2019s Magic Equipment was basically completely useless in this duel.________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he were to freeze Mo Fan\u2019s face, then it would halt his breathing; that would be a danger to Mo Fan\u2019s life.\u201d Principal Zhu looked like he had predicted this result before he spoke to Deng Kai.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, a Fire student won\u2019t die that easily under the snow.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun was so happy that he began to stroke his beard.Looking at the surrounding guests, they all appeared to be completely dumbstruck._Hahaha, I bet you guys didn\u2019t think that Yu Ang, who has just turned eighteen, would have grasped the third level of Ice Spread already!_Generally speaking, if you were able to grasp the second level spell before you graduated from Tian Lan Magic High as a student, then you\u2019d be a top-notch student. If this kind of student also received a good grade on their Practicals, then the majority of them would definitely be able to enter a good Magic University.As for the third level spell, who knew how many years it would take to learn that?His adopted son, Yu Ang had actually grasped it by the age of eighteen, surpassing all of the fifteen hundred students of Tian Lan Magic High, and surpassing all the other powerful disciples._This little thing Mo Fan really is overestimating his own abilities. Later, when you get knocked out, I, Mu Zhuoyun will still not let you off that easily. I\u2019ll let you curse, little brat, I\u2019ll let you do that. Didn\u2019t it feel good that year when you cursed at me? Am I still not able to control you, little bastard?_\u201cNevertheless, the Mu Family can still produce these talents. Admirable.\u201d\u201cOld brother Zhuoyun, this move of yours was a little unexpected. Third level of Ice Spread, you sure hid that one deep. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t let my dog of a son compare himself with your Yu Ang, or else he\u2019d become just like this pitiable student,\u201d an old married woman laughed bitterly to herself._Sigh!_ \u201cWith the third level of Ice Spread appearing, he\u2019s basically now in control of all the younger generations of Bo City. Indeed a hero of the young.\u201dThe intimidation of the Third level of Ice Spread was indeed strong, it essentially caused this duel to no longer have any leeway for the wider number of people. All the guests basically started to congratulate and flatter Mu Zhuoyun.Mu Zhuoyun was enjoying it. Making the Coming-of-Age Ceremony this grandiose was so he could show the people of Bo City how strong the Mu Family\u2019s younger generation was.\u201cDeng Kai, it\u2019s about time.\u201d In the end. Principal Zhu was still relatively worried for Mo Fan.\u201cDeng Kai, how come you haven\u2019t stopped it yet? Mo Fan doesn\u2019t have a single Magic Equipment to resist this. If you delay it any longer, his blood flow will also stop. That will have a great effect on him.\u201dIn the middle of the duel, Deng Kai actually wanted to stop this duel with a huge gap between the powers. However, in that boundless snow round flames were radiating that caused Deng Kai to immediately dispel his thoughts.\u201cOld Zhu, I\u2019m afraid this Mo Fan isn\u2019t as simple as we imagined him to be.\u201d Deng Kai\u2019s gaze was tightly locked onto Mo Fan.Principal Zhu\u2019s heart was filled with suspicion. Just when he was about to say something, incomparably bright and colorful flames ignited within the boundless snow and caught his attention.In this kind of situation, he still wanted to persist and finish a Fire Burst?Fire Burst, Burning Bones\u2019s might would substantially decline beneath the pressure of this large amount of snow. Even if its might didn\u2019t decline, Principal Zhu refused to believe that Yu Ang wouldn\u2019t have any defensive Magic Equipment.In other words, even if Mo Fan was able to complete a Fire Burst before he got frozen, his Fire Burst would still be deflected by Yu Ang, who hadn\u2019t used his defensive Magic Equipment. This kind of struggle\u2026_Huh, something is wrong!__This Fire Burst\u2026_Principal Zhu\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. Using his powerful perception, he was actually able to see the intense and incredibly frantic Fire element energy within the boundless snow!_This isn\u2019t the second level Fire Burst, Burning Bones!_The tiny ball of flames possessed an incomparable penetrative power and boiling temperature, it shot through the snow, which was incapable of cooling off the flames!The Fire Burst once again landed in front of Yu Ang, who was controlling the ice and snow.Yu Ang sneered with disdain, he used his intent to search for the defensive Magic Equipment within his Spiritual World.\u201cIce Dust Shield!\u201dYu Ang awoke the Shield Magic Equipment imprint within his spirit. In an instant, the specks of ice frost quickly formed into a large, curved Ice Dust Shield in front of him. This Ice Shield was enough to completely protect him while he was behind it.As the guests saw this scene, some began to sigh and others started to mock.There was no need to continue this useless struggle. _A free player like you will definitely not able to win against a premium player._\u201cFire Burst\u2026\u201d\u201cRupture!\u201dFrom within the ruthless and boundless snow, Mo Fan\u2019s resounding chant suddenly spread around the duel arena.After the sound faded, a frightening scarlet red emerged from center of the vast expanse of whiteness that was the arena.The scarlet red was only the size of a candle light in the beginning, however, in the next second, an enormous explosion sound was heard.\u201c ~~~~~~~~\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\u201dWithout warning, the raging flames suddenly burst open.Waves of fire began to wash over with the Fire Burst ball in the middle, scorching tongues of fire were frantically fluttering.A dazzling scarlet red, and a boiling heat. The air began to vibrate from the sound of explosion, and the undulations were all transmitted towards the guests who were still seated.As everyone saw this, they were completely dumbstruck. Their eyes sank into that ball of rupturing Fire Burst.Heavens!How is this Fire Burst\u2019s Burning Bones!?Fire Burst, Rupture!_This is the third level of the Fire element spell!_The people hadn\u2019t regained their senses from the shock of Yu Ang\u2019s elevation, far surpassing his peers. Now, they were all being blasted away by Mo Fan\u2019s Rupture. Their hearts were all trembling, unable to calm down.The Captain of the City Hunter Squad, Xu Dahuang, looked as though his eyes were coming off.Fire Burst: Rupture was his ultimate move. With the help of this third level of Fire Burst, he could be counted as an outstanding Magician among the hunters. The problem was that he was a Magician close to thirty years old, and the Fire Burst: Rupture was something he had poured all his strength into to break through. A third-year high school Magic student who hadn\u2019t even graduated yet had actually grasped it\u2026 This really was difficult for him to accept!Principal Zhu and Deng Kai had already sensed Mo Fan\u2019s Fire Burst from the beginning. However, even now, their hearts were still unable to calm down.After running a school for so many years, a student who was able to grasp the third level of Fire Burst before graduation\u2026 They couldn\u2019t even remember how many years it had been since the last one!You had to know that just a few seconds ago, they were sighing about how an Ancestral Family\u2019s Disciple was the disciple of an Ancestral Family. No matter how excellent the student of a Magic School was, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to contend. Who would\u2019ve known that in the next moment, Mo Fan gave them something that exceeded their imagination?Was this kid a freak?He was still capable of cultivating to this kind of realm in school, a place that had a limited amount of resources!Yang Zuohe from the Magic Association was flabbergasted upon seeing this. He swept past the people in the surroundings who were completely stunned and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHas this kid been pulled in by anyone? If not, then I want him!\u201dThe Zhou Family\u2019s Zhou Mingjun was unsatisfied as he immediately said, \u201cYour Magic Association doesn\u2019t have any good Fire elemental resources, you should leave him to our Zhou Family.\u201d\u201cThis kid belongs to our army, don\u2019t you steal him from us!\u201d Luo Yunbo was unable to hold himself back, he hurriedly stood up and said his part.Yu Ang, a disciple of an Ancestral Family, had practically the best resources which Bo City could offer. In this kind of situation, he had cultivated to the third level of the Ice element spell, which caused people to lament endlessly. A student from Tian Lan Magic High who was able to achieve the same realm would definitely disturb the entirety of Bo City!___________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who would\u2019ve known that Mo Fan\u2019s cultivation was like a rocket, freaking learning the third level of Fire Burst already! If it wasn\u2019t for Mrs. Tangyue giving him private lessons, then how could he, Xu Zhaoting, believe it?\u201cI have not. That was all cultivated by himself,\u201d Tangyue denied as she shook her head.Tangyue was the only person who knew that Mo Fan possessed a Stardust Magic Tool. She was able to roughly guess that Mo Fan\u2019s cultivation was much higher than everyone\u2019s expectations. However, she never thought that he would have already grasped the third level of Fire Burst!The face of Mo Fan\u2019s arch-nemesis, Mu Bai, had turned completely dark.He didn\u2019t know when, but now it seemed like he couldn\u2019t even touch Mo Fan\u2019s foot. If this level three Fire Burst were to fly toward his face, then he would\u2019ve lost his dog life in just seconds!\u201cZhuoyun\u2026 Brother Zhuoyun\u2026\u201d Mu He was sitting there, his complexion turned extremely rigid.Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s chest had began to heave up and down a while ago. His face was filled with wrath, but most of it was an endless astonishment!\u201cI really underestimated him!\u201d At last, Mu Zhuoyun couldn\u2019t help but spit these words out.Mu He couldn\u2019t help but take a look at Mo Jiaxing, who was sitting diagonally from him.Was this simple and foolish chauffeur really having his fortunes flipped over? After losing the fortune of his entire family to send his kid to the Magic Academy, he had actually produced a Magic Genius?Third level of Fire Burst! Look at Yu Ang, he only reached the third level of Ice Spread after eating numerous resources!\u2014The guests who were sitting on the seats all had an appearance which displayed their endless shock.In the arena, the frantically fluttering snow finally weakened. The people could gradually see the student Mo Fan standing there proudly.On his opponent\u2019s side, the summoned Ice Dust Shield had already been completely turned into specks of ice stars splattering over the ground, and the Yu Ang which the Ice Dust Shield was protecting had been blasted several meters away. His new Prince-like white clothing had been engulfed by the explosion, turned into ashes. His entire being was like a sorry figure as he lay on the ground, no longer having the boldness of today\u2019s main character!The snow finally melted. Mo Fan waited for his body to warm up before he began to stride toward Yu Ang on the ground._Shit, do you really think you are the only one in this world who has grasped a level three spell?__I\u2019ll let you show off, and then I\u2019ll kill you with an explosion!_\u201cInteresting, haha, it really is interesting! It really is too interesting!\u201d Suddenly, Yu Ang, who had been blasted into a sorry state, stood up from the snowy ground.Mo Fan was somewhat surprised. _This guy is still conscious?_Logically speaking, although the Ice Shield did indeed take the majority of the Rupture\u2019s effect, the exploding fire energy shouldn\u2019t have been blocked. The rupturing force should\u2019ve been enough to cause Yu Ang to lose consciousness.\u201cNo way, a level three Fire Burst still wasn\u2019t able to knock Yu Ang down?\u201d\u201cIs this guy\u2019s body made of steel?!\u201dMu Zhuoyun at this moment began to coldly snort, as he cursed in his heart, _Fortunately I prepared Yu Ang Magic Armor, or else he really would\u2019ve lost to this kid who was deeply hiding his skills._Mo Fan had nearly emerged victorious in this duel. The power of Fire Burst: Rupture was basically unstoppable by anyone at this level. Unfortunately, no one had thought that Mu Zhuoyun would be this cunning!\u201cMagic Boots, Magic Shield, and an extremely expensive Magic Armor. Is there a need to be this luxurious?!\u201d that man with the last name Zhou couldn\u2019t help but call out.Both Principal Zhu and Deng Kai was completely stunned when they saw this.Magical Armor was a defensive Magic Equipment, and its price far surpassed that of a Magic Shield. The block range of a Magic Shield was very narrow, and furthermore there were some spells that you couldn\u2019t block with just a Magic Shield. Magic Armor was able to block absolutely every attack other than spirit attacks! Additionally, it was worn directly on the body, and was able to protect them from the attacks from all angles, truly a divine tool!\u201cI forgot to tell everyone. For my son\u2019s coming of age gift, I specifically gave him an Ice Silkworm Armor, in order to protect him from sneak attacks.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun said slowly to his guests, rubbing his mustache.\u201cWhat the heck, what\u2019s the point of dueling now? His entire body is covered with Magic Equipments! If you really have some ability, then why don\u2019t you fight without the Magic Tools! How shameless!\u201d the worried Zhoumin couldn\u2019t help but yell out.Xu Zhaoting and Wang Sanpang were also feeling indignant.Without Magic Equipments, then that guy Yu Ang would\u2019ve been beaten by Mo Fan so hard that he wouldn\u2019t even look like a person anymore. The third level of Fire Burst would\u2019ve taught him a lesson on how to be a person!\u201cBackground is also a form of strength,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun remained unmoved as he retorted calmly.Mu Zhuoyun had no time to talk about this kind of thing with a group of students. _So what if our Mu Family has the resources, aren\u2019t you a bunch of poor students trying to fight our Mu Family in vain?_\u201cUnfortunate, how unfortunate. This student called Mo Fan is already incredible remarkable, and in the end, he still lost to Magic Equipment,\u201d Yang Zuohe sighed.Many of the present people were pitying Mo Fan.With the level three of Fire Burst he had displayed today, he could proudly laugh at all of his peers in Bo City, and it was definitely enough to cause many of the disciples of the Ancestral Families to feel ashamed. However, a duel was still a duel, a loss was a loss. Just like what Mu Zhuoyun had said, background was also a form of strength, this was a logic that many people would understand after they entered society.\u201cYou sure recognized a good father!\u201d Mo Fan looked at the Ice Silkworm Armor beneath the damaged clothings. His heart also began to feel a trace of rage.Magic Boots, Magic Shield, and yet another Magic Armor piece of Equipment, that was just giving him no way to survive!Yu Ang was still smiling, the look making everyone disdainful of him.\u201cTo be honest, you\u2019re already doing very well. I thought you were a clown who was purposely pleasing the crowd. But it turns out you\u2019re actually purposely hiding your ability, and wanted to use the opportunity this time to amaze the world. How unfortunate, you were just this close, hahhaha!\u201d Yu Ang laughed, he didn\u2019t care about Mo Fan using the Fire Burst: Rupture again.Standing on the side of the field, his face filled with dismay, Deng Kai didn\u2019t know what to do. In the end, he couldn\u2019t help but to remind Mo Fan, \u201cMo Fan, give up. The Ice Silkworm Armor is made to specifically restrain Fire elemental spells. I\u2019m afraid your Fire Burst: Rupture is not capable of injuring Yu Ang.\u201d\u201cDeng Kai isn\u2019t wrong. On my next Ice Spread, you will be turned into an ice cube. It\u2019ll be complicated after you\u2019ve been frozen. You can go in front of my adoptive father and kowtow to him. This can be considered me being a little lenient toward you, who could be considered not a bad opponent.\u201d Yu Ang stood there, wearing his Ice Silkworm Armor, he looked like someone from the top peering down at Mo Fan.Yu Ang\u2019s proud gaze was very high on his horse.The laugh of Mu Zhuoyun, that cunning fox, it also made Mo Fan extremely angry._Background is also a form of strength?_Mo Fan also wanted to laugh, but he was unable to do so right now.He looked around the fully seated guests, he looked at the people who held a high position within Bo City. It appeared that everyone had accepted what Mu Zhuoyun had said, they all carried a bit of sympathy as they looked back at him.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You being one of the characters in the lead of Bo City should be able to dismiss the youngster\u2019s delirious utterance as a laugh,\u201d Principal Zhu still opened his mouth to say at last.The present guests actually all knew of the events surrounding Mo Fan and Mu Zhuoyun, and they also know that if Mo Fan were to lose this duel, he\u2019d have to kowtow in apology until Mu Zhuoyun was satisfied.Mo Fan\u2019s display had caused a sensation among the people. A genius who was able to cultivate to the third level of Fire Burst alone definitely deserved the praise of everyone.At this time, Mu Ningxue also put her two pupils onto Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s face; she also hoped her father would drop it.If it wasn\u2019t for Yu Ang having the advantage in Magic Equipment during this duel, then he would basically have lost against Mo Fan, who had exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations. Mu Ningxue thought that this victory didn\u2019t have any meaning.\u201cJust forget it? How could that be!?\u201d Mu Zhuoyun coldly snorted._If any small thing dared to run up to his face and point at him while cursing him, then how could he, Mu Zhuoyun, continue to meddle in Bo City? A win is a win, what was promised before should be fulfilled!_\u201cMo Jiaxing, what are you happy for? Don\u2019t you know that your son is going to kowtow to everyone?\u201d an old gardener asked from the slanted seats.\u201cWhat kowtow?\u201d Mo Jiaxing asked with a blank face. Mo Jiaxing was happy because he never thought that his own son would actually cause the important characters of the City to feel moved.\u201cShit, don\u2019t you know that your son and Master Mu Zhuoyun had a bet? If Yu Ang loses, then he, Mu Zhuoyun will personally apologize to the two of you for the matters that happened in the past. Whereas if your son loses, he will have to kowtow to Master Mu Zhuoyun until he is satisfied! Our family\u2019s child would only think to himself a few words about Mu Zhuoyun, yet, your son cursed at him several times to his face! For an important character like him, even if he were to tolerate it, he would still be a little angry. Today, he doesn\u2019t plan on letting Mo Fan go!\u201d the gardener told him.Mo Jiaxing had no idea about a bet, he really was a thoroughly confused father.As Mo Jiaxing heard of this, he was stunned. He really did not know of this matter!He was very clear on his own son\u2019s stubbornness and pride. Having him kowtow and apologize in this kind of occasion in front of his classmates, teachers, neighbors, and Mu Ningxue?What kind of children were there nowadays? There were some who would even jump off a roof just because they got slapped. If he were to kowtow at this kind of occasion, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to raise his head again!Mo Jiaxing hurriedly stood up as he ran toward the host\u2019s seat in the middle.\u201cMaster Mu, Master Mu\u2026\u201d Mo Jiaxing yelled toward Mu Zhuoyun.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Mo Jiaxing?\u201d Mu Zhuoyun squinted his eyes, he still recognized this old chauffeur.\u201cSeeing how it\u2019s been so many years, let\u2019s not make it difficult for a child. Think about, today, in front of these many people, and many of them are his classmates, teachers, friends\u2026\u201d Mo Jiaxing hurriedly pleaded.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t talk to me about how many years it\u2019s been. You talk about it as though I didn\u2019t give wages to you, that time I was already lenient toward your feelings. This time, no matter what you say, I will definitely not let him go!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s attitude was firm.Mo Jiaxing immediately began to panic. He really did not think there was such a thing involving apologizing and kowtowing.With the generations nowadays, and being in their prime, what kind of attack would his son\u2019s self-esteem receive if he were to kowtow and apologize in front of this many people?\u201cThen\u2026 then I\u2019ll take his place. Let me take his place. Child was not taught, Father takes the responsibility. I\u2019ll take his place to kowtow and apologize to you. When you\u2019re satisfied, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll get up!\u201d Mo Jiaxing said with panic on his face.Words were just words. This old chauffeur really knelt down in front of the numerous people, his pair of wrinkly eyes looked up to regard the still-sitting Mu Zhuoyun.Everyone\u2019s gazes immediately focused on Mo Jiaxing\u2019s body.As Mo Jiaxing felt these gazes on him, he also felt a great humiliation.However, if they thought about it, if they were to let Mo Fan, who had cultivated his magic to far beyond the same level as his peers, do this kind of stuff, then the humiliation would definitely be magnified numerous times.He had already received the approval of the important characters of Bo City, and he had nearly defeated the Yu Ang whom the Mu Family had carefully nurtured. In these three years, he must\u2019ve been practicing really hard\u2026 He was a very clever young man. The reason why he had gone and made such a bet with Mu Zhuoyun was because he wanted to give his total failure of a father the face he had lost when he was driven away like a dog.His son was way stronger than he was. In the future, he would definitely become an extremely excellent Magician. If he were to let his son kowtow to someone, then it would be a traumatic experience that he would carry for life. He himself was just an old chauffeur, an old man with no future prospects. This kind of thing where you\u2019d lose your face for life didn\u2019t hurt him at all.Watching Mu Zhuoyun, Mo Jiaxing saw that Mu Zhuoyun clearly would not cool his temper. He clenched his teeth as he kowtowed.On the dueling arena, Mo Fan suddenly saw this scene. His heart felt like he was hit by an arrow, receiving a pain he had never felt before.The tall and aloof people will be that way from the start to the end.The lowly people will forever be lowly people.Were people really equal in this society?If it really was equal, then there wouldn\u2019t exist such a thing as being driven away because he and Mu Ningxue was close.If it really was equal, then their house wouldn\u2019t have been taken. That house that blocked the wind and sheltered them from rain was just one of the drops in the ocean for Mu He!If it really were equal, then there wouldn\u2019t be all that Magic Equipment bought using money in a Magic Duel that was witnessed by all these people. It was like a colossal mountain that would make a grassroot like him feel like it was incredibly difficult to cross!In the old days, social rankings were really clear, they would force people to distinctly understand where they belonged in this society. In the current age, the scariest thing lay in the fact that although you were at same level as them, what you were unaware of and no one would tell you before you exited school was that once you entered society, it would be like a bolt from the blue, rumbling down. It would catch you unprepared, and you\u2019d be in so much pain that you\u2019d rather die.The kneeling people? The sitting people?Although you stand most of the time, there\u2019s no difference between that and kneeling!\u201cFather, stand up!\u201d Mo Fan turned towards the place where Mo Jiaxing and Mu Zhuoyun were.Mo Jiaxing turned his head around, but his knees didn\u2019t have the courage to stand up. Mo Jiaxing was too scared of Mu Zhuoyun wanting Mo Fan to personally come and apologize.Mu Zhuoyun remained sitting there, looking indifferent.Mo Fan glanced at his own father, who once again had made a great sacrifice for him, and then at the Mu Zhuoyun who didn\u2019t have any interest in letting the matter go.\u201cFather, don\u2019t return the gift back to Mu Zhuoyun this early, the duel isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d Mo Fan looked at Mo Jiaxing, his eyes filled with icy rage.\u201cReturn the gift?\u201d Mo Jiaxing had no idea on what his own son was saying.Mu Zhuoyun didn\u2019t know what this guy was saying either._Return the gift? Are you saying that I, Mu Zhuoyun, also need to kneel down and apologize to you!?______________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, he laughed once more.\u201cHe\u2019s just returning a gift. My dad is a simple and honest person, he feels that it\u2019s more sincere if he were to return a gift.\u201d Mo Fan turned around, his eyes were coldly gazing at Yu Ang, who was still laughing.\u201cI see you\u2019re not convinced until you\u2019re faced with the reality. In that case, let me turn you into an ice cube first, and then slowly enjoy this kind of ceremony that will cause you to never raise your head again within Bo City!\u201d Yu Ang swore, as his eyes dripped with disdain.The Ice stars began to quickly connect with each other within Yu Ang\u2019s eyes. With the Ice Silkworm Armor on his body, Yu Ang wasn\u2019t worried about being interrupted by Mo Fan\u2019s Fire Burst, even if this guy Mo Fan was faster than him at casting!On the other side, Mo Fan\u2019s pair of eyes were extremely cold.If\u2026 Mu Zhuoyun had a slight intention of letting go of these matters, then he would\u2019ve given up on the matters today. However, the father and son\u2019s arrogance and irrationality had thoroughly provoked Mo Fan.He firmly believed that if he didn\u2019t win this duel, then he would see a scene where his father would kowtow until he started bleeding for his foolish son!However, was he really that foolish?_Today I will let everyone understand what it means for a single spark to start a prairie fire!_\u201cBackground is also a form of strength?\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but start laughing loudly.In the next second, his laugh came to a stop. Replacing his laughter was a domineering aura that no one had seen before!\u201cIn that case, my innate talent is also a form of strength!\u201d_Do you really think that I, Mo Fan will lose just like that?__Have a taste of the might of my Lightning!_Purple-colored pupils suddenly appeared. Within the pitch black eyeballs that seemed like the vast universe was a purple Star Radiance, glinting warningly!Lightning!The strongest of the elements!It represented anger, might, and destruction!This ridiculous social ladder was shattered into pieces by this violent Lightning!The Lightning stars actually had a special connection with the feelings of their owner. The natural attribute of the Lightning embedded its user with a domineering quality that would not cease at any time!It was not because of the user\u2019s petty background!It was not because of circumstances outside of the body!All of the Lightning stars had never been obedient before. That was because Mo Fan\u2019s mental state had never been in sync with the Lightning element\u2019s temperament before today.The Lightning Star Path ignited a raging wrath within his heart as it instantly connected. They also seemed like they wanted to be granted all of the energy of their user.Star Path emerge!The magic that congested the mysterious energy between heaven and earth was of the highest quality._Bzzzt~!_The purple lightning arc was tyrannical as it emerged. It unprecedentedly swirled around Mo Fan\u2019s body, willingly awaiting Mo Fan\u2019s command.Mo Fan raised his head with lightning within his gaze.\u201cLightning Strike!\u201d\u201cWrath Shock!\u201dWithin the lightning, Mo Fan raised one of his hands. Following this action, he violently grasped his hand and the traces of Lightning frantically swirling in the air turned into lightning soldiers. They gave out an angry hissing as they chaotically bombarded Yu Ang\u2019s position._Bzzt!_After the numerous traces of the purple Lightning landed, they began to mutually link to themselves and turned into an even stronger lightning as they ferociously attacked Yu Ang, who seemed completely defenseless.Yu Ang\u2019s Ice Spread spell was still being chanted. In the next second, he was completely wrapped within the dazzling, yet dreadful Lightning force. The shock within his heart could not be described with words.The attack was incomparably volent. Everytime it shocked his body, it would transmit an acute pain. What was even more dreadful was that these lightning traces could enter the body\u2019s flesh and bones while causing the enormous effects of an electrical shock. Even if the Ice Silkworm Armor was resisting it, it still wouldn\u2019t be able to completely block out the all-pervasive penetrating power of Lightning!Yu Ang\u2019s body no longer belonged to himself. His body was acutely twitching as he stood there. The arrogance and superior look on his face was no longer there, all that remained was his eyes filled with questions and disbelief!_Why?__What is this?__Lightning, this is clearly Lightning Strike! Why can you, a Primary Fire Magician, cast a Lightning spell?_The Ice Silkworm Armor didn\u2019t exist in front of the might of Lightning Strike. At last, Yu Ang let out a miserable scream, his entire being began to collapse under the assault of the purple Lightning Strike!This time, it would be impossible for Yu Ang to get up. A third level Lightning Strike was even more powerful than Fire Burst. The Ice Silkworm Armor was capable of restraining Fire spells, but there was no way it could possibly defend against the dreadful ability of a third level Lightning Strike!The Lightning\u2019s roar was still screeching by their ears, but the entire Manor was completely silent!Everyone was completely dumbstruck the moment Mo Fan cast Lightning Strike. Although the Lightning Strike didn\u2019t hit them, the bolt from the sky was still within their minds!What did they just see?_Lightning Strike?__This is freaking Lightning Strike?__You, a Primary Fire Magician, are telling us that you are able to cast Lightning Strike?!_Yu Ang had already collapsed from the attacks. Currently, the people had forgotten about this guy\u2019s existence. Instead, the scene in front of them that was beyond common sense had made them so shocked that they almost went crazy.How could they not go crazy? In this world, any Magician at the Primary level could only control the magic of one element. Magicians were only able to obtain their second element when they reached the Intermediate level. _You, a third-year high school student who hasn\u2019t graduated yet, how can you have acquired two elements?__One is Fire, the other is Lightning-!_\u201cHe\u2026he\u2026could it be that he\u2019s an Intermediate Magician? That\u2019s impossible, that\u2019s definitely impossible! In this world, even if your cultivation is fast, there is no way you would be able to cultivate to the Intermediate level within just three years! This is definitely impossible!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun was the first one among the people to shoot out from his chair, he had difficulty believing what he saw in front of him.In the same way, Principal Zhu, Deng Kai, Yang Zuohe, Zhankong, these Magicians who were at a higher realm, they were all unable to believe the scene they saw in front of them.Third level Lightning Strike, this was clearly the third level of Lightning Strike!However, how was a Fire student be able to cast a Lightning spell?!Was it the result of a special piece of Magical Equipment?That wasn\u2019t right, the magnificent purple Star Path that had emerged around Mo Fan\u2019s body had already proven that this power was something he personally used. It was definitely not possible for him to have been supported by other Magic Equipment!The only Lightning Magician in this place, Xu Zhaoting, was even more dumbstruck.Holy crap, isn\u2019t that the realm that he himself had been thirsting for? The third level of Lightning Strike, that was the objective that he himself was pursuing for the next few years. Why was it being cast by Mo Fan? _You, Mo Fan are clearly a Fire Magician, alright?!_Crumbled, Xu Zhaoting\u2019s heart just crumbled. This something which he, a genuine Lightning user, hadn\u2019t grasped, and was actually achieved by a Fire Magician. _I-I don\u2019t wanna live anymore!______________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It must be because they\u2019d been studying Magic for so long that they became delirious. Not good, they must return back to school to write ten thousand scrolls to calm themselves. Having illusions before the high school exams was not a good sign!The entire place was silent for a very, very long time!As Lightning Strike came out, it was as though the concepts everyone knew had crumbled in that moment, and they were unable to say anything for a long time.\u201cWho\u2026 who can\u2026 who can tell me, this\u2026 just what is going on!\u201d The man with the surname Zhou also jumped out of his chair as his gaze swept past the important characters of Bo City who were completely stunned by the display of Lightning Strike._Is there really no one who can come out and explain, or is it that I really am blind?_\u201cIntermediate Magician, he is an Intermediate Magician. He has awakened a second element, that must be it!\u201d Xue Musheng used words that he himself could not believe.\u201cNo!\u201d At this moment, the one with the highest status, Principal Zhu spoke out.The people watched Principal Zhu attentively. They believed that the unbelievable and blinding scene in front of them could only be explained by someone with virtue and prestige like Principal Zhu.\u201cHe is still a Primary Magician.\u201d Principal Zhu said firmly.\u201cThen how could he possibly possess the Lightning element\u2026\u201dPrincipal Zhu took a deep breath, at this moment, one could tell how stirred up this teacher of Bo City was. He was so stirred up that the muscles on his face were quivering, so moved that he even needed a while to speak.\u201cInnate dual elements\u2026 he\u2026 Mo Fan is an innate\u2026 innate dual element!\u201d Finally, Principal Zhu spoke out his shocked yet definite conclusion._That\u2019s right, it must be an innate dual element!_This student\u2019s cultivation definitely had not reached the Intermediate level. The only explanation as to why he was able to cast Lightning Strike was him being an Innate Dual Element!He Awakened Fire, and also Awakened Lightning!This student who was nurtured within Tian Lan Magic High was one of the world\u2019s incomparably matchless, rarely seen Innate Dual Elements!\u201cInnate Dual Element! Heavens, this world really has an existence like an Innate Dual Element?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\u201cXue\u2026 Xue Musheng, Mo Fan\u2026 isn\u2019t he your student? Weren\u2019t you in charge of the Awakening day?\u201d the Disciplinary teacher Chen Weiliang said to Xue Musheng at his side, while still completely shocked.\u201cI was, but\u2026 But I clearly remember he only had a Fire element.\u201d Xue Musheng tried really hard to recall that day, but unfortunately, he really could not recall the situation back then.This mind-blowing matter made people forget that this was a Magic Duel between the youths. The sensation caused by the Innate Dual Element caused people to forget that the main character today was supposed to be Yu Ang, who came of age! Tonight, there would be no one as dazzling as Mo Fan with an Innate Dual Element, who had achieved the brilliant feat of amazing the whole world!\u201cThis kid\u2026 our army will definitely have him, whoever dares to steal mine, I will raid their home!!\u201d The head of the Army, Zhankong, had jumped out of his chair a while ago.He, the great Zhankong, feared no one in Bo City. Whoever dared to jump out today and steal this kid Mo Fan with an Innate Dual Element, then he, Zhankong would eliminate said person._Holy crap!_ He was dropped in this Bo City here in the south by the higher-ups, and he thought it was just that. Who would\u2019ve known that this little place would have an youth that possessed an Innate Dual Element that rebelled against the heavens! When Mo Fan only had a single Fire element, Zhankong had already wanted him, and wanted to pull him into the Magic Army. Who would guess that this kid had concealed such a heaven-alarming talent! He wanted this kid Mo Fan, Zhankong would take him even if he had to lose his entire fortune!That man with the surname Zhou wanted to stand up and say something. In the end, Zhankong\u2019s words made his entire being abruptly stop._Shit, not like this! Our Zhou Family also wants him!_The man with the surname Zhou was now regretting the fact that he didn\u2019t jump out earlier to forcefully pull this kid away. Now, after the appearance of the Innate Dual Element, the powers of Bo City were completely broken due to this homeless kid!\u201cBoss Zhankong, although there are many things which are in your control within Bo City, that does not mean that as long as you want it, you can take it. I am going to report to the higher-ups. Our enormous Magic Association has never let go of an exceptional genius. Furthermore, what other organization is more specialized in nurturing Magicians than our Magic Association?\u201d Yang Zuohe directly jumped out.Small families and small ancestral families would still have to give face to the Army. However, the great Magic Association did not need to do so.Fight?In this world they had never heard of a power that would dare to contest the Magic Association!\u201cHeh? This kind of student our school actually is very much willing to expend a large quantity of money to nurture. So the two of you no longer need to worry about that, hmm,\u201d Principal Zhu said.Damn them, these two guys Zhankong and Yang Zuohe wanted to snatch away Mo Fan in front of his face before he even graduated. _I, old Zhu have good relations with people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean I will concede this kind of student to others. If you have some ability, then come and contest our Magic School\u2026 Don\u2019t forget, many of your Battlemages actually come from our Magic School, so give me all you\u2019ve got, Zhankong!_Mu Zhuoyun stood there like a fool. He looked at all the guests who were shocked by Mo Fan, and then looked at all these powers contesting each other for Mo Fan in front of his face. At last, he looked at the duel arena, at the Magician who was controlling the dual elements of Lightning and Fire.Mu Ningxue from his family also had a rarely seen talent in Magic. However, if talking about appeal, then the Innate Dual Elements were a few points ahead. After all, Mu Ningxue\u2019s innate Ice-affinity Spirit was definitely above peers of her age. However, those truly rich and powerful Ancestral Families were able to gather treasures to obtain Ice-affinity Spirits, whereas the talent of an innate Dual Element was something you definitely could not find a second of even if you were to turn on the lights to search for one across the world!It could be said that even Mu Zhuoyun wanted this kid!\u201cHurry up and get up, Old Brother Jiaxing, get up. I only wanted to give your son a little lesson, how could I possibly have him do it,\u201d Mu Zhuoyun hurriedly supported Mo Jiaxing in front of him.Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s attitude had taken a 180-degree change.After Mo Jiaxing got up with some support, he looked around his surroundings in disbelief.Perhaps a driver wouldn\u2019t know what an innate Dual Element actually represented, but from seeing the changed expressions of these important characters from before and now, he was able to understand just how incredible his own son was.No, being incredible wasn\u2019t enough to describe it. His son perhaps was enough to cause a sensation throughout the entirety of Bo City!This was very good! Selling off his only family property to let him enter Tian Lan Magic High was not in vain! If he had hesitated even a little, he could\u2019ve killed off an incredible Magician. _Look at all these important characters of Bo City, look at the expressions on their faces, look at them when they\u2019re fighting! Heavens, I, Mo Jiaxing, who do not have any morals or ability, is capable of conceiving such an incredible son!_Mo Jiaxing wiped at his tears of joy as he stood up.A busy life and a petty salary, along with a poor environment, had pressured his back that had always been crooked. Normally, he would drive for these rich, powerful people and nod his head and bow, which was no different from kneeling\u2026 He now understood why his own son had told him to stand up. It was because from now on, the two of them would no longer have to grovel before anyone!____________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His majestic and formal Coming-of-age Ceremony had turned into a day for this brat Mo Fan to cause a sensation in Bo City!What was even more regretful was that they had lost this Magic Duel. This meant that Mu Zhuoyun would have to apologize to the father and son in the front of his distinguished guests!Thinking about this point, Mu Zhuoyun felt something in his chest fiercely rumbling, and his blood pressure rose tremendously.\u2014In the arena, Mo Fan didn\u2019t even feel like looking at Yu Ang, who had turned into something like a dead dog after being bombarded by Lightning Strike._Background, you want to talk to me about background? I\u2019ll use lightning to shock you into a dog that acts rich!_As he turned away, Mo Fan began walking toward the stands.The result couldn\u2019t be more obvious, he had won.Despite the shock that had caused everyone\u2019s flesh to feel numb, Mo Fan was more concerned about that old scoundrel Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s current expression.As expected, the old scoundrel looked as though he wanted to spit blood, but was unable to do so.\u201cMy dad has already given you his gift, old guy, why don\u2019t you decide for yourself what to do,\u201d Mo Fan coldly grunted as he walked in front of Mu Zhuoyun._Waiting for today! I have also been wanting for many years! Today, when people who have status from Bo City are here, I will make you, Mu Zhuoyun, experience how to lower your voice while you deal with that anger!_Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s old face began to twitch severely.In reality, Mu Zhuoyun actually thought highly of Mo Fan. He was afraid that the kid would cause a reversal of fortune, and so he had specially prepared that Magic Armor for Yu Ang. However, Mu Zhuoyun did not even dream that Mo Fan had an innate Dual Element, and that he even had Lightning Strike cultivated to the third level!This entire grandiose Coming-of-age Ceremony had thoroughly had become this kid\u2019s ceremony for shocking the world. It was like making a wedding dress for someone else\u2019s apprentice. This kind of feeling was like wearing a green hat, causing him to seethe with anger.\u201cThat\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. Master Mu Zhuoyun has always been looking after us, Mo Fan, just let this matter go.\u201d Mo Jiaxing was after all a good and honest person. From how he saw it, Mu Zhuoyun kneeling down and apologizing was no different than having him killed. In any case, he was still an important character.\u201cYeah, just forget about this matter. Tonight has caused all of us to expand our horizons,\u201d Mu He hurriedly jumped in, his attitude was completely different from before. It was simply like someone with a merchant\u2019s friendliness, it carried some good intentions._Just forget it?__Shit, if this old scoundrel Mu Zhuoyun had the intention of just forgetting it, then he, Mo Fan, wouldn\u2019t have brought out Lightning to shock them!_\u201cHmph, what does a kowtow apology amount to. I, Mu Zhuoyun, will do what I have promised. If you agree to a bet, then you must be prepared to lose!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun fiercely spat out these words.As these words were said, Mu Zhuoyun really stood in front of Mo Jiaxing.The spoken words was quite bright, yet, Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s actions were somewhat stiff.He really needed to do a kowtow apology to the father and son?After doing this, he, Mu Zhuoyun, would really be unable to raise his head in front of the people of Bo City._Bastard, freaking scoundrels! How could such a heaven-defying talent like the Innate Dual Element possibly be in this little scoundrel, Mo Fan\u2019s body? No wonder why he was so confident when he agreed to this duel bet back then, it turns out he actually had such a trump card in his hands\u2026_The old fox, Mu Zhuoyun was similarly calculating, but he was unable to anticipate his opponent\u2019s Innate Dual Element.Struggling, Mu Zhuoyun clenched his teeth as his knees slowly bent.\u201cOld brother Mu Zhuoyun, you must not! Sigh, we don\u2019t even have any deep animosity, there\u2019s no need to be like this. Besides, what kind of century is this, there\u2019s no need for something like this! Even people in the past were able to laugh and forget the old grudges. We could even count to have known each other for a long time.\u201d Mo Jiaxing hurriedly supported Mu Zhuoyun back up.Mu Zhuoyun looked back at Mo Jiaxing in shock.In his perspective, most people would be enjoying themselves greatly at this time. It was not just anyone in this world who could enjoy Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s kowtow apology, let alone Mo Jiaxing, who had also given him one before.\u201cMo Fan, it\u2019s all right now,\u201d Mo Jiaxing turned around and told Mo Fan.Mo Fan shrugged his shoulders. Even his father had spoken up, what else could he do?Either way, Mu Zhuoyun did kneel just now, and it could be said that he also did kowtow. The grudges of many years could be said to have been drained out with the impetuous Lightning Strike.\u201cWell said, even people in the past were able to laugh and forget old grudges. Today should be a day worthy of celebration! Our Bo City has given birth to a shocking genius with Innate Dual Elements! Not too long ago, we thought that Mu Ningxue\u2019s Ice-affinity Spirit would make the name of our Bo City famous. Who would\u2019ve thought that Mo Fan\u2019s Innate Dual Element is even more shocking! The heavens really are watching over our Bo City!\u201d the prestigious Principal Zhu let out with a sigh.Among the southern cities, Bo City couldn\u2019t be counted as being particularly excellent, nor did it have many excellent Magicians appearing. Thus, it had been silent in the south for a long time.However, Mu Ningxue\u2019s Ice-affinity Spirit, as well as Mo Fan\u2019s Innate Dual Element, could definitely cause a great sensation. It would allow Bo City to become the most-watched city in the south!This matter excited people just thinking about it!\u201cMo Fan, let\u2019s just put it like this. As long as you join our Army, then you will definitely be able to become the chief of a city army in the future! Let\u2019s not even talk about the large amount of cultivation resources, someday you will definitely be able to find success in this career!\u201d Zhankong was first to jump out and make promises with a sincerity he never had before.\u201cZhankong, that should be enough. Being able to choose which faction is an individual\u2019s freedom. What is the meaning behind your forceful recruiting?\u201d Yang Zuohe protested unhappily.\u201cShit, how am I forcefully recruiting him. Mo Fan and I address each other as brothers. He is my sworn little brother!\u201d Zhankong widened his eyes.The two instructors, Luo Yuanbo and Pan Lijun, to the sides, began sweating._Boss Zhankong, when did Mo Fan become your sworn little brother?_\u201cHead Instructor, just what are you babbling about?\u201d Mo Fan was speechless.\u201cOh? You\u2019re not content with that? How about you\u2019re the older brother? You being my sworn older brother is also alright. Either way, join our Army and you\u2019re guaranteed a high position and great wealth,\u201d Zhankong immediately proclaimed.Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun had already begun sweating waterfalls._Shit, you, the grand Chief of Bo City\u2019s Army, are recognizing an eighteen-year old kid as your sworn older brother, that\u2019ll make all the army squads in Bo City collapse. Can\u2019t you have some moral principles, Boss Zhankong?_The two instructors really wanted to drag their Boss Zhankong away immediately, this was far too shameless!____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After hesitating for a while, he finally opened his mouth and whispered to his teammates next to him, \u201cDon\u2019t you guys think that this guy looked like a certain person when he cast Lightning Strike?\u201d\u201cYou also think so?!\u201d Xu Dahuang immediately widened his eyes.On the side, Xiaoke was biting into an apple while she continually nodded in agreement.Li Wenjie had a strange smile as he glanced at Guo Caitang.It was very obvious that Guo Caitang had also sensed something. Her beautiful face was filled with an unwillingness to accept reality.\u201cFan Mo, Mo Fan; shit, it\u2019s him!!\u201d Xu Dahuang yelled out as he suddenly came to his senses.The entire Hunter Squad came to the same realization. The expressions on their faces couldn\u2019t be described with mere words.They always knew Fan Mo was young, but they definitely hadn\u2019t imagined that he was a third-year high school student who hadn\u2019t even graduated yet!The most important thing was, not only did this guy have the Lightning element, he also possessed a ferocious Fire element! The power behind his Fire element was actually not inferior to their Captain, Xu Dahuang!Guo Caitang was probably the person who felt most the complex about this revelation. In fact, after interacting with him for the past year, she had developed a good opinion of their mysterious Lightning element user, Fan Mo.Everyone knew that a Lightning Mage had infinite prospects, and most Lightning Mages chose to head into an easy job with a high income and high position. The young and promising Fan Mo had instead been part of their Hunter Squad, and not only did he excel among his peers, he was also very calm most of the time. Additionally, he had once single-handedly saved her life, and another time he had used his Lightning Strike to save the entire Squad. Thus, having a good opinion of him was a certainty.In the end, Fan Mo and Mo Fan, the two had suddenly turned into one. Combining a person who you have a good opinion of with one whom you loathe and disdain, that was\u2026 That truly made her speechless!\u2014\u201cEveryone, I have something to say.\u201d Principal Zhu spoke out once more.Principal Zhu had a good moral bearing and reputation, so naturally everyone paused to listen to him.\u201cAn Innate Dual Element is an astonishing talent, and the Magic High Exams are coming soon. Our school plans on using this extremely rare opportunity to properly pull off a big move and make the people from other places see the might of our Bo City. Thus, I hope everyone will not leak the matters that happened today. Wait until the national Magic High Exams have started, we will give our incredible Magician of Bo City, Mo Fan, an opportunity to cause a sensation across the country, how about it?\u201d Principal Zhu\u2019s voice echoed in everyone\u2019s ears.This kind of large matter, it would most likely be spread across the media, covering the skies and earth._(Ed. Note: Must ask Tofu if this was written before the true cell phone age. There\u2019s no way a lid could be kept on it nowadays\u2026)_It was almost time for the incomparably important Magic High Exams, and Principal Zhu hoped to use the opportunity of these Magic High Exams to firmly fly the flag of Bo City. It had been far too long since Bo City had this kind of glory.\u201cThat, I don\u2019t mind. However, I can at most postpone the reports to the higher-ups for two weeks,\u201d said the Magic Association representative, Yang Zuohe.\u201cPrincipal Zhu, who would dare to spread news of this kid with me here?\u201d Boss Zhankong agreed.Zhankong wasn\u2019t stupid. If the bigger organizations caught news of this guy, they\u2019d come running here to dig for him. If that happened, then he, Zhankong, could only start crying. No matter what, they had to suppress this matter!With this place having so many people, it was only natural to be unable to control everyone from running their mouths off. However, as long as they were able to control the media and prevent them from spreading this matter outside the city, then those people could run off their mouths as much as they wanted. Either way, they were only keeping this a secret until the end of the Magic High Exams, when they would announce it.\u201cSpeaking of all this, isn\u2019t this a bit exaggerated? They even have to block off the media for the Magic Innate Dual Element?\u201d Wang Sanpang whispered.Mrs. Tangyue was sitting with the students, her heart still hadn\u2019t calmed down from the shock. After hearing Wang Sanpang\u2019s question, Tangyue couldn\u2019t help but explain, \u201cYou have only been in a small place like Bo City, so it\u2019s natural you don\u2019t know how incredible the Innate Dual Element is. If the news were to spread out, then Bo City would be occupied by incredible forces within a day. Furthermore, if Mo Fan were to choose a faction, then some with sinister intentions would rather kill him than let him grow. After all, killing a Primary Magician like Mo Fan in secret is not a big matter to them. By suppressing this information, it will benefit Mo Fan as well as everyone else.\u201d\u201cNo way, there really are people that scary? Doesn\u2019t that make them no different than the Black Vatican?\u201d\u201cWhen a human\u2019s heart is evil, you need to be cleverly cautious,\u201d Tangyue replied.\u201cBrother Fan really caused a sensation this time\u2026 Speaking of which, just how did Brother Fan cultivate? Since he has dual elements, then it should take even longer for him to cultivate, so how could he be so much further along than us with both of his dual elements?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cYeah!\u201dThe corner of Xu Zhaoting\u2019s mouth began to twitch. _Zhang Xiahou, can\u2019t you shut up??_\u201cI reckon Yu Ang will cry until he turns stupid.\u201d\u201cExactly. Did you not see that old scoundrel Mu Zhuoyun? Even though he had some problems with Mo Fan before, now he would immediately accept Mo Fan as his godson\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could that be? Even the Chief Instructor wants to make Mo Fan his sworn brother! With the Chief Instructor, an Advanced Magician, backing Mo Fan, who would dare to touch him?\u201d\u201cSigh, comparisons are odious.\u201dWhile Mo Fan\u2019s classmates were discussing this, Tangyue\u2019s eyes had been watching Mo Fan this entire time.Tangyue finally understood how Mo Fan was able to kill the Spirit Wolf back then.Speaking of which, Mo Fan really gave people endless surprises. He had actually been hiding his Innate Dual Element this entire time\u2026However, doing that was pretty smart of him. Having a low profile while his strength wasn\u2019t high enough was not a bad thing. Now that Mo Fan had people who were backing him enthusiastically, like Zhankong, his future growth would be a lot smoother.It was just that they didn\u2019t know if this guy would be able to properly use his incomparable Innate Dual Element, and be able to distinguish himself from the other exceptional geniuses from across the country.\u2014Tonight, Mo Fan had naturally amazed everyone!The Magic Association, Hunter\u2019s Union, and Bo City Army combined to suppress the news together. It naturally wouldn\u2019t be possible for this matter to spread out in a short period of time._(Ed. Note: Someone has not heard of telephones and the internet age, methinks\u2026)_Of course, this Magic Duel\u2019s biggest profit wasn\u2019t just retrieving his family\u2019s dignity from the past. The most important thing was obtaining the opportunity to enter Bo City\u2019s Underground Holy Spring to cultivate for a whole week.With the Magic High Exams approaching, Mo Fan wanted to advance tremendously in his cultivation with the nourishment from Bo City\u2019s Underground Holy Spring before taking the exams. That way, Mo Fan would be able to have a stunning performance on the Magic High Exams and take away the breath of people across the country!When that happened, he would truly be renowned everywhere. It could be said that it would give Mo Fan a perfect road for his future Magic cultivation.\u201cThe Underground Holy Spring, just what kind of special cultivation ground is it?\u201d Mo Fan couldn\u2019t help but look forward to it.It was reported that many Magicians who were stuck at the Primary rank had broken through to Intermediate with the help of the Underground Holy Spring. An Intermediate Magician in Bo City was seen as very good!Furthermore, Mo Fan was an Innate Dual Element Magician. Once he reached the Intermediate rank, he would possess a third element of magic! That kind of versatility would hold an absolute advantage among Intermediate Mages._Alright, I must definitely use this rare opportunity to substantially increase my strength!____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was because the roof he met Mu Ningxue on was only one building away!This Silver Commerce Tower looked like a straight, towering pentagon. People described it as a skyscraper, but it looked like a big pentagonal pagoda that was located in the center of Bo City.The height of the Silver Commerce Tower was around two hundred meters. The entire exterior was covered in reinforced glass. Beneath the sun, it looked like the tip of an unsheathed sword. When night fell, the entire tower would be filled with brilliant lights and vibrant colors. City areas in the distance were still able to see its swirling rainbow colors in the evening.It was considered a symbolic structure of Bo City. It was said that the super big conference hall on the top floor belonged to Mu Zhuoyun.And Bo City\u2019s heavenly treasure, the Underground Holy Spring, was actually located beneath the Silver Commerce Tower. The white and gold collar workers within the Tower didn\u2019t know that this place even had a fifteenth sub-floor!An elevator that seemed like the ones from a secret services headquarters had taken Mo Fan down to the fifteenth sub-floor of the Tower. Mo Fan was stunned to find out that this place really looked like a secret organization; they had actually dug out a secret protective underground hall.The Underground Hall was built using special crystalline rocks. At one look, you could tell it came from the hands of a very credible construction master.The Underground Hall had only one patrol squad guarding the place. The patrol squad\u2019s Captain was also an Intermediate Magician.An Intermediate Magician was guarding the entrance?This showed just how important the Underground Holy Spring was to Bo City!\u201cBehind this totem door is the Underground Holy Spring. You are allowed to enter for a period of one week to cultivate. The Underground Holy Spring will maintain a cycle by itself, so don\u2019t touch it. All you need to do is to sit in the middle of the Underground Holy Spring, on the leather mat, as you enter meditation or Control.\u201d Mu Zhuoyun was in a bad mood as he said this to Mo Fan.This Underground Holy Spring was originally supposed to be taken by Yu Ang; who would\u2019ve thought that it would be taken by this kid Mo Fan? How could Mu Zhuoyun\u2019s mood be good at this time?Accompanying Mo Fan here was Mrs. Tangyue. Mrs. Tangyue slowly nodded to Mo Fan, hinting that he should go inside and enter his seclusion.\u201cOh, I have something to give you,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue said to Mo Fan as she thought of something.\u201cSomething to give me?\u201d Mo Fan was surprised.Mrs. Tangyue took four different purple and red colored books out from thin air. The books were engraved with what looked like light specks from the stars and Star Path prints. It looked like some kind of completed Magic Diagram.\u201cMrs. Tangyue, you really are magnanimous when you hand things out. This is a precious Star Atlas Book, and you\u2019re even given out four of them! This really is making me, a rich provincial, broaden my horizons.\u201d Standing off to the side, Mu Zhuoyun immediately recognized the books Mrs. Tangyue was giving away, his face turning sour.\u201cWhat is this Star Atlas Book?\u201d asked the confused Mo Fan.\u201cAfter you have experienced the baptism of the Underground Holy Spring, you will surely not be too far from becoming an Intermediate Magician. I\u2019m not certain whether I\u2019ll still be here to teach you. Thus, I\u2019m giving you these Star Atlas Books as parting gift, so you can have some way to protect yourself after you\u2019ve broken through to Intermediate level.\u201d Mrs. Tangyue stopped for a bit before continuing to explain the functions of the Star Atlas Book, \u201cYou already know that Primary Magicians are required to link their stars to form a Star Path. After a Star Path emerges, a spell will be formed.\u201dMo Fan nodded, it felt as though he was listening to his teacher give him an even higher level Magic Class.\u201cAfter you reach Intermediate level, your Stardust will turn into a Nebula. The Nebula will be even more vast than Stardust, and it will have 49 stars in total. Intermediate Magic requires you to connect the 49 stars into a Star Atlas. Intermediate Magic will only be born after the Star Atlas has emerged\u2026\u201d Mrs. Tangyue explained.Stardust turning into a Nebula!49 stars interconnect to form a Star Atlas, which becomes Intermediate Magic!Mo Fan\u2019s heart silently remembered these crucial words.\u201cYou should understand that completing the control of seven stars requires an incomparably long time to cultivate. The 49 stars\u2019 difficulty won\u2019t be just two or three times as hard. Even if you change your Stardust into a Nebula, you will still need a long time before you are able to cast an Intermediate level Magic spell. This Star Atlas Book\u2019s speciality is that when you pour your intent into it, the Star Atlas Book will release a special attraction that will cause your 49 stars to form into the arrangement on the Star Atlas. Even if you don\u2019t have enough power to take control of all 49 stars, as long as your Nebula has enough Magic energy, then it will be able to cast its Intermediate Magic spell!\u201d Mrs. Tangyue explained sincerely.Mo Fan\u2019s jaw dropped: he never thought that this world would have such a magical thing.With something like a Star Atlas Book, what was the point of Magicians bitterly cultivating Control? They could just bring along a few books and they would be fine!Mu Zhuoyun looked as though he could read what Mo Fan had in mind before he coldly humphed, \u201cEven if you had money, you still wouldn\u2019t be able to purchase a Star Atlas Book! Your Mrs. Tangyue isn\u2019t as simple as a regular teacher.\u201dMo Fan looked at the mature and beautiful teacher in front of him, astonishment building in him.Thinking about it carefully, a teacher who was able to casually settle the matter with a Stardust Magic Tool shouldn\u2019t be as simple as just being a High school teacher. Furthermore, Mo Fan had witnessed Mrs. Tangyue\u2019s Shadow spells; this meant that Mrs. Tangyue was at least an Intermediate Magician!\u201cYou possess an Innate Dual Element, it will be hard for you to escape the jealousy of smaller people. These books are given to you to protect yourself. Naturally, if you want to use these Star Atlas Books, the prerequisites are that you need to turn your Stardust into a Nebula, and 7 stars into 49 stars. If not, the Star Atlas Book will absorb your body and turn you into a mummy,\u201d Mrs. Tangyue informed him earnestly._(Ed. Note: Ah, I think Mo Fan totally missed the part about becoming a mummy.)_Mo Fan nodded his head in sincere gratitude, he felt really moved.He and Mrs. Tangyue only had a regular student and teacher relationship, and yet, she was caring for him so much. It seemed he must hurry up and cultivate to the level of an Intermediate Magician, and then earn lots of money so he can marry her; only then will he be able to return this favor.\u201cThank you Mrs Tangyue, I will definitely do my best!\u201d Mo Fan said sincerely.Tangyue smiled, her bright eyes had some expectations of him.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be too proud of yourself. The Heaven and Earth Spirit Pond of this Underground Holy Spring isn\u2019t bad. However, it won\u2019t be able to help you reach the Intermediate level. It will only give you a big push toward the Intermediate level checkpoint, if you really want to break through\u2026 Hehe, still far for you!\u201d Mu Zhuoyun coldly humphed.Tangyue no longer said anything, she had already given him what she wanted to give him, so she turned around to leave.Mu Zhuoyun was too lazy to look at the kid that made his entire being feel like babbling rubbish. He waved his hand to signal to the protectors of the Underground Holy Spring to pull Mo Fan in and lock him inside.\u201cPull yourselves together. Last time, the Ground Gutter Rat almost found this place. If the warm waters of the Underground Holy Spring were to leak out and attract calamity, then you guys will definitely be questioned!\u201d the Captain of the guards, Liang Bin, shouted.\u201cCaptain, don\u2019t worry. That matter will definitely not happen again!\u201d The other guards made a solemn vow.This last thing Mo Fan had heard from the guards before he had entered the Underground Holy Spring made Mo Fan think of that One-eyed Magic Wolf that had almost evolved.The One-eyed Magic Wolf had precisely acquired the leaked warm waters of the Underground Holy Spring, turning it into something dreadful. _With that logic in mind, if I was to cultivate here for seven full days, wouldn\u2019t my entire being soar?_______________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Versatile MageChapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0GravityTales\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0GravityTalesThe Underground Holy Spring was an enclosed area, built with dark green boulders. Each boulder had a strange Magic Diagram and incantation engraved on its surface.In any case, Mo Fan was an educated person. He could understand some of the meanings behind the diagrams, and if he wasn\u2019t wrong, then these must be Advanced level protective-type Magic spells.Thus, it was not just some place built with stone. In fact, even if there was an earthquake, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily affect this place in the slightest; a flawless defense in the truest sense.Originally, Mo Fan thought this Underground Holy Spring was a large bath; he would strip off his clothes and lie in there as he enjoyed all of it. However, after passing through a few erected archways, Mo Fan was amazed to find out that the Underground Holy Spring was only a square-shaped, stone-stepped altar.The stone altar had four layers. The very bottom one had a small hole that acted as a circuit channel. The clear Holy Spring water was practically transparent as it slowly flowed through the small stone channel.Mo Fan observed it for a bit and couldn\u2019t find anything special about it. Just when he was about to sit down on the stone step altar and start cultivating according to the instructions of Mu Zhuoyun, suddenly, the Little Loach Pendant on his chest began to emit strange trills.\u201cWhat are you getting excited for, acting like you can drink all this!\u201d Mo Fan began to scold it immediately.The current Little Loach Pendant was a Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool. Not only was Mo Fan able to maintain Meditation for 14 hours a day, he was also able to obtain the special energy from the Little Loach Pendant that helped nourish his two Stardusts. The pendant was precisely why Mo Fan was able to cultivate two elements to the third level within such a short time.Even in a school with so many people, those who possessed the second level of Primary Magic before they graduated their third year of high school could be considered impressive. Mo Fan was able to exceed them by a level in a circumstance where he had one more element to cultivate! This was enough to display the capabilities of a Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool._Is it possible that the Little Loach Pendant is able to absorb the Underground Holy Spring\u2019s hot spring?_ As Mo Fan felt his pendant\u2019s thirst, his heart couldn\u2019t help but ask this question.The Stardust Magic Tool and Underground Holy Spring should have the same nature, being able to speed up a Magician\u2019s cultivation. The Underground Holy Spring displayed a colossal amount of energy, so much that it could help Magicians attack the Intermediate realm from the Primary level._Should I try? If the Little Loach Pendant really can absorb the energy from this place, then wouldn\u2019t it be able to once more advance to an even higher quality Stardust Magic Tool?_ Mo Fan inevitably had some brazen thoughts floating through his head.The school\u2019s Stardust Magic Tool\u2019s energy was completely absorbed by the Little Loach Pendant. If the special hot spring within the Underground Holy Spring was absorbed, wouldn\u2019t that be equivalent to him carrying around the Underground Holy Spring on his body?The Underground Holy Spring only opened up once a year. It would only be able to supply one promising Magician with cultivation time. With just that, many people admired it. If\u2026If\u2026_Shit, I can\u2019t!_The Stardust Magic Tool from school was absorbed by the Little Loach Pendant and was turned into garbage. He could only thank Mrs. Tangyue, who had helped him settle the matter.This time, if he were to absorb the entire Underground Holy Spring, not only would all of the people in Bo City go crazy, he himself would be put on a stake and burned to death!Carefully meditate, it\u2019s better to not think about this kind of large, illogical matter._Little Loach Pendant, don\u2019t be so impulsive. I know this thing is a big supplement for you. However, if you were to do that, then your grandfather, I, would be stomped by the people of Bo City. Thus, you cannot just do anything you want. We\u2019ll just quietly seclude ourselves here for seven days, and then pass the exams, enter University, and then subdue monsters and kill demons to save the world, with my left hand wrapping itself around Mu Ningxue, and nestling against Tangyue with my right. When the time comes, we\u2019ll even find you a female pendant\u2026_ , Mo Fan dreamed inside.The Little Loach Pendant seemed as though it really understood, as it no longer blindly caused trouble. It returned to obediently laying on Mo Fan\u2019s chest.Mo Fan took a deep breath._Shit, is this really a pendant? Why is it acting like a little demon king in the world of players\u2026_After seating himself on the leather mat, Mo Fan was able to feel an energy gathering to him, similar to the nourishment of the pendant, even if he didn\u2019t enter meditation.The nourishment from the special hot spring was much stronger than Little Loach Pendant. If the Stardust Magic Tools were divided into Common grade and Spirit grade, then the cultivating nourishment which the Underground Holy Spring brought was definitely a first-rate one. It felt like his entire being was getting ready to fly.His Lightning and Fire Stardusts, who were at a saturated state, began to move. They were like two infants who suddenly touched mother\u2019s milk as they frantically began to suck it in. Every time they sucked, their bodies began to expand a little.When he first Awakened, the two Stardusts were really small. In his entire Spiritual Cosmos, they really seemed like tiny Stardusts, their radiance was rather dark and not clear. Sometimes, they were even hard to find. After cultivating for three years, the Stardusts gradually expanded, their radiance distinct and clear. His entire Stardust looked as though it formed its own territory as it exhibited a mysterious energy.At this moment, the two Stardusts had subtle expansions; the change in every hour was about the same as Mo Fan\u2019s bitter cultivating for a whole week!_This is too good, this experience is almost like cheating!_ Mo Fan\u2019s heart was incomparably stirred up.He never thought that he himself would actually accidentally obtain such an exceptional opportunity for cultivating. It seemed like stealing resources from those wealthy second generations was necessary. Even a dumbass would be able to be an expert who exceeded their peers with a cultivation speed like this.Resources. There were too many resources that were in the hands of a small number of people. If it wasn\u2019t for him revealing his Dual Elemental ability, then he wouldn\u2019t have gotten his hands on the Underground Holy Spring.With the nourishment from the Spirit grade Stardust Magic Tool, added with the effects of the Underground Holy Spring, the seven days of cultivation could very possibly allow him to attack the Intermediate Magician level!\u2014\u2014A new guard who came not too long ago, Wang Tonglian, inquired of his commanding officer, \u201cCaptain Liang Bin, is this Underground Holy spring really that miraculous?\u201d\u201cOur Bo City traces back a long time, even earlier than the Age of Qin Kingdoms. The Underground Holy Spring could be said to have survived up until now. Think about it, our Bo City doesn\u2019t have economics, talents, nor development. So why are we a reputable city in the south? It is only because of the existence of the Underground Holy Spring. It could be said that without the Underground Holy Spring, our Bo City would at most be recognized as a village,\u201d Guard Captain Liang Bin answered from his seat on the floor, his face tranquil.\u201cDating from the Qin Kingdoms? Doesn\u2019t that mean it has more than two thousand years of history?\u201d the new guard asked, shocked.\u201cExactly. As long as you\u2019re not a naturally endowed, foolish, incurable Magician, then cultivating inside there for one hour would be equivalent to cultivating for three days on a normal day.\u201d Liang Bin\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help but reveal some fascination.\u201cBut Captain Liang, there are only a few people in Bo City who have entered Underground Holy Spring,\u201d a guard to the side pointed out.Liang Bin nodded. He could never forget about the time he had been in there to enjoy it for seven days. To people who thirsted for a greater power, that place felt even better than having a group of beauties assigned to you to ravage for seven days.__________________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you were guarding it for the long term, even if it was separated by a restricted door, you were still able to receive some of its nourishment. Why else would a grand Intermediate Magician be willing to stay there?\u201cCaptain Liang, the cavern tunnel that was dug by the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat has been found. This cavern tunnel looks extremely deep. We didn\u2019t dare to go too deep in for now,\u201d said a valiant and formidable-looking woman wearing a guard uniform.The beautiful eyes of the female guard carried hints of valor. Paired with that tight white uniform, she commanded an unique charm.\u201cVice Captain Lin Yuxin, you\u2019re thinking too much. The Colossal-eyed Ape Rat is a commonly seen creature within Bo City, being able to dig all the way here through a complicated underground drain is also an occasional matter,\u201d said the rookie guard Wang Tonglian.Lin Yuxin creased her brow; it was very clear that she did not like how laid back this Wang Tonglian was.\u201cThe Magic Association has already sent someone to investigate this, there was nothing particularly strange. It\u2019s better if you just stop worrying,\u201d Captain Liang said with a smile.Lin Yuxin nodded, but it was evident that she didn\u2019t loosen up after those words.\u201cI\u2019ll take a look on the outside.\u201d After Lin Yuxin finished speaking, she brought four guards along and left.Everyone stared at Lin Yuxin\u2019s attractive backside before they couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads.\u201cEver since Lin Yuxin\u2019s sister went missing, her smile has become a rare occurrence. _Sigh,_ even her sister\u2019s skeleton hasn\u2019t been found at this time. Such a good middle school student, if she\u2019s gone then she\u2019s gone,\u201d Tan exclaimed as he sighed.\u201cI heard that it was done by a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, who knows.\u201d\u2014After Vice Captain Lin Yuxin had left the underground hall, her heart was still filled with worry.After her sister had gone missing an year ago, she has been constantly searching for Colossal-eyed Ape Rats. She even entered those caverns left behind by the Colossal-eyed Ape Rats in the underground sewers of Bo City.Even if the Magic Association had sent people out to investigate, Lin Yuxin was still unresigned.She was unwilling to believe that her dearest little sister would disappear from this world without seeing her corpse.Just yesterday, Lin Yuxin found something that was unusual within the caverns of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat.It was water.Having water in the sewers was very normal. If someone else were to see this, they definitely wouldn\u2019t think this was strange at all. However, in the eyes of a Water Magician, that wasn\u2019t just your normal water. Accurately speaking, the water was very similar to the waters of the Underground Holy Spring!Why was the water of the Underground Holy Spring in the sewer tunnels?This was something incredibly inconceivable. The Underground Holy Spring was being protected, even a drop was precious. However, when she investigated the sewer tunnels, the water was like a sewage flow as it was spread all over the quagmire, even as it was being drunk by the nasty rats and cockroaches.Suspicious, Lin Yuxin specifically brought this water over to a specialist who researched substances. The researchers from the Magic Association had told her that the results would come today.Lin Yuxin walked to an empty place and saw it was nearly time to call the number of the researchers at the Magic Association.\u201cHow is it, what did the results say?\u201d Lin Yuxin asked after making her call.\u201cIt is not the Underground Holy Spring,\u201d the researcher calmly replied to her.\u201cI thought so,\u201d Lin Yuxin nodded. It seemed like she was thinking too much.\u201cHowever, other than it not having the same special effects, its other qualities are very similar to the Underground Holy Spring,\u201d the researcher continued.\u201cWhat does that mean? It\u2019s possible to find a second Underground Holy Spring in this world?\u201d Lin Yuxin was puzzled.\u201cThe Underground Holy Spring is a Spirit Pond from Heaven and Earth. Other than it being clean, it is able to bring a great nourishment to cultivators and Magical Beasts. This water that is similar to the Underground Holy Spring was also birthed from a special environment; however, it should have been affected by the darkness in its surroundings. The waters that you found are actually also capable of boosting the strength of cultivators and Magical Beasts for a short period of time. The only difference is that this water seemed more like a stimulant; frantically absorbing the energy in the organism\u2019s body. The creatures would turn crazy and irrational at the cost of their energy,\u201d the researcher said sincerely.Lin Yuxin was startled, as she had never heard of this kind of water existing in this world.Could it be that this water was the cause of the originally vulgar and cowardly Colossal-eyed Ape Rats jumping out and harming people?\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing\u2026 but I hope I\u2019m just thinking too much.\u201d The researcher\u2019s voice suddenly turned exceedingly solemn.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t drink this sewage water, then it could actually be passed off as Underground Holy Spring, as it has similar effects. At the very least, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference between two of them within a day.\u201dLin Yuxin felt a chill over her body.Fake imitations as real?This kind of water had inexplicably emerged within the tunnels dug by Colossal-eyed Ape Rats. A year ago, a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat almost dug through the location of Underground Holy Spring\u2026 was this really a coincidence?\u201cIt could be a coincidence.\u201d Lin Yuxin smiled rigidly, as she herself couldn\u2019t believe that.\u201cI can only hope so\u2026 There\u2019s going to be heavy rain, I\u2019ll come to the Silver Commerce Tower to pick you up, you probably don\u2019t have an umbrella,\u201d the researcher said.\u201cI\u2019m a Water Magician, would I still need an umbrella?\u201d Lin Yuxin said.\u201c\u2026Alright, let\u2019s have dinner together tonight?\u201d\u201cI have to guard the Underground Holy Spring.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201dLin Yuxin hung up the phone with her forehead creased, there remained many doubts in her heart.\u2014\u2014A white pickup truck that was turning gray was climbing up the Snowy Peak Mountain station.Just as it entered the station, torrential rain suddenly began to pour down. In an instant, the entire mountain range was enveloped by the continuous rain. An orange mist emerged on mountain peaks in the distance.\u201cThe goods were almost ruined. Fortunately, I got here just in time.\u201d Mo Jiaxong jumped out from the truck as he looked at rain outside with a lingering fear.\u201cHow can the rain have colors on it? Strange!\u201d a few veterans in the station remarked.\u201cYeah, it looks like the color of urine, hahaha!\u201d another Hunter Magician laughed.Mo Jiaxing passed by them as he greeted some of the familiar faces with a smile. As he heard the people discussing how the rain was weird, he couldn\u2019t help but look at the sky that was covered by a curtain of rain.Either way, this rain really was strange\u2026\u2014The station was normal, the man guarding the northern checkpoint was a direct subordinate of Zhankong, Wan Duanfeng.Wan Duanfeng was the Army Commander of a regiment with a thousand people, an Intermediate Earth Magician. In terms of guarding Bo City, there was no one who was more remarkable than him.Wan Duanfeng wore a conjoined leather raincoat, he stood in the middle of the rain with a dignified and solemn bearing.His gaze was attentively watching the forest that was drenched by the large rain. Suddenly, a light ball flew out from the back of the mountain hill as it broke through the yellow rain. In the dark skies, it let out a weak light.\u201cBrilliant Light?\u201d Wan Duanfeng widened his eyes, and his expression immediately sank.Brilliant Light was the Primary spell of Light Magicians. The purpose of Light Magicians within the Army were very important, as they are able to transmit messages and locations.This Brilliant Light was similar to a primitive signal bullet. Magical Beasts had no perception toward this kind of light, and if they were to watch it, it could easily cause blinding harm to their eyes.If the soldiers were to use any other technological equipment to transmit messages, it\u2019d be like sending the surrounding Magical Beasts their GPS location. This kind of Brilliant Light had became a strategy to expel Magical Beasts and transmit signals.\u201cCommander Wan, that\u2026 that is a warning signal, why is group three sending a signal to us? Could it be that a Magical Beast is escaping?\u201d a Battlemage to the side asked.As he finished speaking, yet another Brilliant Light cut through the rain from afar, once again turning increasingly bright.At this moment, all the Battlemages standing guard at the checkpoint were startled.Two Brilliant Lights!A Blue Alert?____________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The first level was Orange.Two years ago, Bo City had set off an Orange Alert. Back then, there was precisely a Brilliant Light radiating from the back of the mountain. At that time, there were at least three hundred Magical Beast scattered in the vicinity of the safety boundaries!Today, two staggered Brilliant Lights were seen, this meant a Blue Alert.Once this Alert went off, it signified there were hidden threats and a crisis in the city.The Orange Alert was quickly solved by Boss Zhankong back then. However, with the appearance of a Blue Alert today, it meant that there were at least a few thousand Magical Beasts roaming the vicinity of the safety boundaries!Heavens, Bo City hadn\u2019t sounded off a Blue Alert for the last ten years!_Ringalingaling!_A jingling sound arose.Just when everyone thought this was a joke, the phone in Wan Duanfeng\u2019s pocket began ringing.The rain poured down onto the faces of the hundreds of Battlemages, revealing stunned expressions. With the exception of the sounds of rain and Commander Wan Duanfeng\u2019s mobile ringtone, the surroundings were very silent.Wan Duanfeng fished out his mobile beneath the drifting rain and put it to his ear. \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cCommander Wan\u2026 we were attacked by a group of beasts, our Light Magician\u2026The Light Magician died, we are unable to continue firing off the Brilliant Lights.\u201d The voice of Squad Captain Zhou Jin was coming over the phone.Wan Duanfeng felt a chill run through his body, the hand that was holding the phone began to tremble.\u201cIf Bo City is able to survive this disaster, please apologize to Boss Zhankong, and apologize to Pan Lijun.\u201d Zhou Jin\u2019s voice was gloomy and hoarse, carrying reluctance.Wan Duanfeng\u2019s face was fiercely twitching, his eyes carried a deep sorrow and anger._Beep Beep Beep_After saying this, he hung up the phone. In the process of the call, Wan Duanfeng was able to hear clamorous roars. The roars sounded as if they were right next to his ears, his heart was palpitating.Wan Duanfeng put down the phone in his hand with a despairing soul. He tightly closed his eyes, the pouring rain paining him, and it seemed even more swords were stabbing into his heart.Even though they had hung up the phone, Wan Duanfeng was still able to imagine the next second when the Squad Captain Zhou Jin let out a grieving shriek.He was dead, he was definitely dead. There was no one who was more clear about that than Wan Duanfeng; a person who was using a phone in that situation was definitely not capable of surviving!\u201cSound off the Blood Alert!\u201d Wan Duanfeng took a deep breath. His eyes no longer had traces of sadness, it was replaced by the resolve of a soldier\u2019s hard work.\u201cBlood\u2026 Blood Alert?? You\u2019re not joking with us are you, Captain Wan?!\u201d The Battlemage at his post had a disbelief on his face.Beneath the curtain of rains, the Battlemages guarding their posts were all dumbstruck. For them, the second level Blue Alert was already causing turmoil. As for a Blood Alert\u2026That was a calamity!The Blood Alert was the most dreadful calamity. Some people could live their entire lives without seeing a Blood Alert, whereas those who had experienced a Blood Alert might not be able to step out of that shadow for the rest of their lives!\u201cWhat are you being distracted for, hurry up and do what I told you to do!\u201d Wan Duanfeng practically roared.These blockheads. Delaying the sounding of Blood Alert by even a second could cause the death of hundreds of people!_Awuuuuuu!__Awuuu! Awuuu!__Roar!_Suddenly, a series of roars that shook people\u2019s hearts came from the back of the mountain. It was as though the back of the mountain had series of lightning bolts hitting it, making the entire mountain tremble.The aftermath of the trembling reached the station, the giant stone barrier in the station also wavered slightly._Awuuuuuuuuu!_In the vast curtain of rain, a fuzzy figure suddenly jumped out. He emerged on top of an stately pine tree\u2019s utmost summit.Beneath the rain, the proud and aloof creature that resembled a King clearly had the body of a Wolf, yet it was arching its back as it stood there. The three eyes on his fierce skull let out an incomparably vicious red light.The Magical Beast was overlooking this checkpoint station of the human city from afar. It was\u2026 It was like it was looking at penned-up sheep.\u201cThree\u2026 Three-eyed\u2026 Three-eyed Magic Wolf!!\u201d a young Battlemage to the side shouted with a trembling voice.As he said this, the Three-eyed Magic Wolf that was proudly standing on top of the pine tree suddenly had shadows scuttling forth behind it. Those shadows occupied the tall trees as they gathered around the Three-eyed Magic Wolf like it was a military officer.More and more of the shadows appeared. Their red and savage eyes were like stars decorating the dim rain. One glance caused the men\u2019s entire bodies to feel a chill, and their scalps went numb!\u201cThis\u2026 this many!\u201dMultiple packs of One-eyed Magic Wolves began to appear on the hill. They simultaneously raised their heads as they howled toward the sky that was raining down. The entire mountain was covered by their voices.\u201cThey\u2019re calling, they\u2019re continuously calling for their comrades!\u201d A Summoner who had done research into the Beast Language stated, his face completely stunned.Heavens, that place already had over three hundred One-eyed Magic Wolves. With that many One-eyed Magic Wolves calling out at same time, just how many more Magical Beasts were they calling for?!At this moment, the Battlemages who guarded the station finally understood why they sounded off the Blood Alert!The Magical Beasts were attacking!Multiple groups of Magical Beasts were attacking!This was a calamity, an unforeseen calamity!A heavy rain, followed by hundreds and thousands of Magical Beasts who were frantically rushing in!Bo City had been fighting with the Magic Wolves for many years. It was like the Magic Wolves were no longer able to suppress the thirst in their hearts! They were gathering beneath the commands of higher level Magic Wolves before they frantically attacked the defense line of Bo City!A dark green tide covered the mountain, formed by numerous One-eyed Magic Wolves.They were frantically running and howling. The small Snowy Peak Mountain station trembled fiercely.The eyes of the numerous Magic Wolves were filled with hatred and cruelty toward the humans waiting beneath the heavy rain. They planned on eating all the living people!Beneath this kind of frightening sound, even the Magicians seemed incredibly small. At this moment, they were coming to fight off the Magical Beasts!For many of the Battlemages, they would never forget the scene of groups of One-eyed Magic Wolves racing over\u2026 ah, it was unlikely that they would forget it, because there wouldn\u2019t be many who would necessarily survive the day!___________________Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Fan had already deeply experienced this point. However, for his incredible life as a Magician, he was willing to endure this lifestyle.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many days it has been, but I can feel myself touching the doors of an even higher realm!\u201d Mo Fan stopped meditating and began to ponder.The biggest difference between Primary and Intermediate level was the Stardust within a Mage\u2019s Spiritual World turning into a Nebula.During the time his N experience card was activated, Mo Fan cultivated frenziedly.His cultivation time had always been more than twice as long as others, and additionally, he had the nourishment from the Underground Holy Spring. With this, he was able to achieve nearly 24 hours of continuous meditation.After all, Meditation gave Stardust a large boost. Mo Fan was already able to clearly feel the transformation of his Magic Stardust during the past few days.Originally, the higher level Magic Nebula was a strange and odd thing to him. However, after his Stardust had burst out with a weak, pulse-like radiance, Mo Fan vaguely felt that this could be the sign of a breakthrough.Normally, Stardust was very stable. His current Stardust was covered in a mist of a bizarre light shell that looked like an aurora. After going through Meditation in this short period of time, there was a clear thirst and agitation coming from the Stardust. It seemed like a little life within an egg, urgently trying to break open the mist light shell on the outside.With every intense radiance coming from the Stardust, it was an attempt to break through the binding of the shell. Every time the radiance turned dark, it probably meant the Stardust was charging its power.His Lightning element was the first element he had awakened. During this period of time, Mo Fan felt like the Lightning Stardust was going to break through the shells and evolve, even the stars seemed to have some clear changes\u2026\u201cStill not enough, let\u2019s continue meditating so I can get the Stardust to increasingly expand. Only then will they have a hope of breaking through and becoming a Nebula!\u201d After Mo Fan let himself rest for a while, he already began to have the ideas of attacking the next realm._Bzzzzzz!_Suddenly, a fierce trembling came from his surroundings.Mo Fan who had been about to break through in a spurt of energy, immediately opened his eyes as he surveyed the shaking walls of his surroundings._What kind of circumstance is this, an earthquake?_Mo Fan stood up and walked toward the location of the large gate as he put his ears to it. He wanted to hear whether something had happened on the outside.Just as he was going to listen, the restricted gate slowly began to open up.\u201cA week has already gone by? That was fast!\u201d Mo Fan was stunned.The sealed door opened up, a woman wearing a milky white uniform entered Mo Fan\u2019s eyesight as she darted in. At same time, Mo Fan saw the entire underground hall was covered in scarlet red marks of blood.The guards were laying everywhere, their bodies all ripped into several pieces. The blood clots and organs were all mixed in the pools of blood. Seeing this stunned Mo Fan\u2019s entire being._Corpses, there are so many corpses!__What happened to these guards of Underground Holy Spring, what happened to make them so miserable?_\u201cCaptain Liang!\u201d the uniformed young woman yelled out.As she finished yelling, Mo Fan saw movement on the other side. The Intermediate Magician, Liang Weichan, were fiercely thrown toward a pillar of the underground hall like a sandbag. The pillar was directly broken into two.Fortunately, Liang Weichan\u2019s body had a layer of Water Barrier protecting him, or else that kind of collision would definitely have injured him badly._Just what is happening here?_Seeing that made Mo Fan tremble in fear. There was actually something that was capable of throwing a grand Intermediate Magician around like a sandbag!Mo Fan moved to the side so that he could see see the other half of the underground hall obstructed by the stone door. What numbed Mo Fan\u2019s entire body was that there was actually a creature standing there with a body that was bigger than a small truck!This creatures neck and head were indistinguishable, but the big rat\u2019s body was extremely distinct. It was different from a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat, this creature\u2019s body was covered in incomparably sinister, twisted, and numerous blood marks!. It made this pickup-sized Big Rat appear even more dreadful!Mo Fan had been in the Hunter Squad for a year, yet, he had never seen this kind of body. He had never seen a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat with a body full of blood marks, the aura it emitted from its body made him feel as if he had fallen into an ice cavern as he trembled in fear.\u201cThis\u2026 This is a Blood Mark Colossal Rat!\u201d Mo Fan plundered the knowledge he had learned from his Magical Beast classes. At last, he finally remembered the name of this creature.Heavens, the Blood Mark Colossal Rat on the textbooks looked somewhat comical, but the genuine Blood Mark Colossal Rat\u2019s fierce appearance felt like an attack in itself!_Why did this thing appear inside the underground hall, were all of the guards get killed by this Blood Mark Colossal Rat?_\u201cGuguguggu!\u201dThe Blood Mark Colossal Rat seemed to have smelled the odor emitted from the Underground Holy Spring, its massive lantern eye immediately locked onto the location of Mo Fan and the guardswoman.Its sharp claws easily dug into the underground hall\u2019s stone bricks. One could feel that this Blood Mark Colossla Rat was currently charging up its power, just like a pickup truck gunning its engine.\u201cClose the door!\u201d Surrounded by stone fragments, Liang Weichan shouted toward the guardswoman.Lin Yuxin bit her lips, but she had no choice but to fiercely slap the gate.The two restriction gates closed. Just when the opening was reduced to a small crack, Mo Fan was terrified to see the Blood Mark Colossal Rat\u2019s claw coming in. It caused Mo Fan to reflexively stumble back._Too fast!_The closing speed of the gates was extremely quick. The Blood Mark Colossal Rat was clearly over thirty meters away, yet, it charged over in a wink._Booom!_The stone gates trembled, the Blood Mark Colossal Rat had clearly slammed into them.Lin Yuxin\u2019s complexion turned pale as she glanced at the student who was still cultivating here.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Mo Fan asked, a lingering fear in his heart.The scene from before was too scary. If they were one step later closing the door, then they would\u2019ve instantly lost their lives. The Blood Mark Colossal Rat was several times scarier than the nearly evolved One-eyed Magic Wolf. It was definitely not something a Primary level Magician was capable of fighting against!\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die here, then come with me!\u201d Lin Yuxin didn\u2019t have the time or patience to explain to him.All of Bo City had sunk into a crisis, the sewers were filled with Magical Beasts. They appeared to have been planning for it, they all began to frantically attack the Underground Holy Spring.On the surface, all of the Magicians were currently fighting off an invasion of Magical Beasts. The Underground Holy Spring had suffered a surprise attack, and so they wouldn\u2019t be receiving any reinforcements. Presently, they could only rely on themselves to protect the Underground Holy Spring!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: REDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Biting her lip, she pressed it down, and heard a gurgling behind her.Without knowing what kind of button she had pressed, the originally circulating Underground Holy Spring was now continuously flowing into a small hole._Gudu~ Gudu~_A few seconds later, all of the Underground Holy Spring had disappeared. There was not a single drop left within the small stone ditch.Lin Yuxin strode to the very top of the altar and tore up the old leather mat, which was still warm from Mo Fan sitting on it.The board beneath the leather mat could be opened. After Lin Yuxin opened the board, a blue bottle was visible inside. Within the bottle appeared to be the incomparably clear Underground Holy Spring\u2019s waters.Mo Fan was incredibly curious. How could so much Underground Holy Spring be contained within a soda can-sized bottle?Lin Yuxin carefully put away the bottle that contained the Underground Holy Spring and turned around to look at the straightforward student who was about to do his Magic High Exams. She said, \u201cThis is the emergency protection plan for the Underground Holy Spring. There is another passage in this cell, it should lead to the back mountain of your Tian Lan Magic High.\u201d\u201cIt leads to the back of the school\u2019s mountain? Miss, can\u2019t you tell me just what exactly has happened first?\u201d Mo Fan asked anxiously.\u201cYou\u2019ll know once you\u2019ve exited. Come with me first, their objective is precisely the Underground Holy Spring, we cannot let the Underground Holy Spring land in their hands.\u201d Lin Yuxin didn\u2019t want to say too much.\u201cTheir?\u201d Mo Fan was even more confused, he didn\u2019t know what Lin Yuxin was saying.Lin Yuxin walked along the wall. Her fingers actually inserted what seemed to be some kind of password into a section of the stone wall that was indistinguishable from the rest.Mo Fan was stunned as he saw this. He had concentrated hard to cultivate in this cell, so much that he didn\u2019t realize there were so many mechanisms in the Underground Holy Spring\u2019s chamber._Krrrrr~_With a grinding noise, the stone wall to the side suddenly opened up, revealing a pitch black tunnel. He really wondered where the tunnel led to._(Ed. Note: Yes, he\u2019s quite dense at times. It\u2019s all about him!)_\u201cLeaving this place is our priority.\u201d Lin Yuxin said no more as she grabbed Mo Fan and they walked into that dark tunnel.Mo Fan had also realized that there were major things happening on the outside, so, he didn\u2019t dare to hesitate.As they took a few steps inside, Lin Yuxin suddenly thought of something. Her pair of somewhat sharp eyes looked over at Mo Fan.\u201cThis secret tunnel isn\u2019t necessarily safe. The people from the Black Vatican should have me as their objective. I\u2019ll let you carry the Underground Holy Spring, you must protect it.\u201d Lin Yuxin made a decision that she herself thought was rude and impetuous.However, Lin Yuxin had no other choices.The Black Vatican came here prepared, it seemed like they knew the Underground Holy Spring like the back of their hand. If they were to meet people from the Black Vatican during the process of escaping, then their main objective would definitely be her, the Vice Captain, while Mo Fan, a student, would definitely be neglected by the people from Black Vatican.As long as they were able to protect Underground Holy Spring, then there was still hope!\u201cCan I trouble you to just tell me what is going on?!\u201d Mo Fan was a bit impatient.Judging by how Lin Yuxin appeared to have lost her spirit, it meant that a big commotion was happening in Bo City.\u201cBlood Alert One.\u201d Lin Yuxin was unable to clearly explain to this student in a short amount of time. After all, the student was secluded in the room, and completely ignorant of what had happened in the outside world.Blood Alert?A colossal rock hit Mo Fan\u2019s heart ferociously, causing a huge wave of emotion!After coming to this world, Mo Fan had learned some very important pieces of information. It was a fact that humans were not the dominant race in this Magical world. Outside of the city dwelled Magical Beasts hundreds and thousands of times more numerous than humans!The Magical Beasts were also spying on the resources that were occupied by humans. Beneath the command of some Magical Beasts that acted like monarchs, the Magical Beasts would be like a legion as they attacked human cities in a large scale assault. There had been cases where some weak cities disappeared overnight!Thus, the five continents of the world with the strongest Magic Associations called these kinds of attacks against cities Alerts. Furthermore, they would be divided into different levels based on the number of Magical Beasts and their powers.Just like natural disaster warnings from the technological world had different levels, so too the kind of crises where Magical Beasts would invade the humans also had different levels!Orange Alert! That was the first level of Alerts, this meant there were sightings of Magical Beasts within the vicinity of the safety boundaries. Their numbers were above three hundred!An Orange Alert happened two years ago, that event had already alarmed people.A Blue Alert was even more dreadful. For Bo City, this would be a foul wind of blood rain. Who knew how many Magicians and Civilians would lose their lives when the Magical Beasts wantonly invaded.But the higher level, Blood Alert\u2026That was destruction, massacre, a catastrophe for the city. The limited amount of Battlemages would be unable to fend off the invasion of the Magical Beasts. The Magical Beasts would invade the city and start wildly massacring the people. It was not just a few Magical Beasts running around, there would be hundreds or thousands of them!There were many Magicians who would get slaughtered like chickens, let alone the civilians who were completely unable to do anything.Blood Alert, the City would turn into a river of blood, the corpses would be everywhere!Just the descriptions and records from books caused people to tremble in fear. Now that everything was happening in front of everyone\u2019s eyes, just what kind of Hell on Earth would it be?\u2014\u2014After passing through the secret tunnel, Mo Fan, who was still dazed with disbelief, and Lin Yuxin emerged on the north side of the mountain in the city.The heavy rain was still pouring down, the dark and gloomy weather enveloping all of Bo City in a depressing atmosphere. From afar came a roar that shook people as it echoed in their ears. In an instant, their bodies began to tremble in fear.Mo Fan turned his gaze in the direction the roar of the Magical Beast had come from.Heavens, that was a residential area!The ground level houses, and the streets constructed with an outdated cement\u2026 it was like a food market that had scarlet red blood flowing out!All that blood couldn\u2019t be the blood of chickens. That was the blood of once-living people that converged into a stream as it flowed into the sewers from the constant pouring of the heavy rain!Bloody red, an eye-catching bloody red!Standing on the back of the mountain in the middle of the city, he could clearly see bloodstains everywhere in the rain-covered, dusky Bo City.Bo City was an ink-like city with the characteristics of the south. Under the rain, it would normally look even more like a beautiful painting. However, today, Mo Fan saw a painting that was filled with blood stains, like the arrival of a nightmare!_Awuuuuuuuuuuu!~~~~~~~~_A trembling roar suddenly erupted from Bo City, its sound raising goosebumps all over.Mo Fan turned his head around as he looked in the direction of the sound. However, a mind-blowing and terrifying scene entered his eyes!A gray sky was shrouding all of Bo City. Bo City\u2019s symbolic building, the Silver Commerce Tower, was like a crane in a flock of chickens. It almost looked as though it was touching the gray heavens. However, lying on the dome of the lofty Silver Commerce Tower was a colossal shadow!Its tail stretched almost the full length of the dome of the Commerce Tower.Half of its wings were unfurled. One half looked hazy in the rain, the other half covered several floors of the building!Its head was raised high. The roar that shook the entirety of Bo City came from a ferocious mouth that was capable of swallowing clouds!_______________________Translator: TofuEditor: REDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You could see the dome of Silver Commerce Tower from any location in Bo City, that meant that everyone in Bo City was able to witness this ferocious and colossal dark creature!This scene caused Mo Fan to take a deep breath, he was unable to regain his senses for a long time!This was too mind-blowing, this entire thing was too much for Mo Fan.What Spirit Wolf, what One-eyed Magic Wolf, what Blood Mark Colossal Rat? All of these looked like a joke of an army in front of this creature that was sitting on top of the Silver Commerce Tower. Mo Fan\u2019s definition of a Magical Beast had been fiercely overthrown in this moment!It was in the territory of the humans, yet it looked like it had entered its own territory. Humans were only food which it had confined and raised in this city!_Just what exactly happened?__Is this still the Bo City I am familiar with?__Didn\u2019t the Magical Beasts get banished into the depths of the mountains, or were the textbooks always deceiving others? The ones who ruled over this world had never been humans, they were these Magical Beasts that were massacring Bo City!__It\u2019s a nightmare, it\u2019s the underworld!_ He could really feel every inch of his body shivering from fear!\u201cJust what exactly is that?\u201d Mo Fan regained his senses after a long, long time.Not too long ago, he was directly beneath this dreadful creature. If he hadn\u2019t used the secret tunnel to escape from the Silver Commerce Tower, then would he have lost his life there?\u201cDarkwing Wolf, Commander level Magical Beast. Calling hundreds of Magical Beasts with just a howl\u2026 The only person in Bo City who can survive its attack is the Chief of the Army, Zhankong.\u201d Lin Yuxin replied in a stiff voice.\u201cCom\u2026 Commander level?\u201d Mo Fan repeated faintly.In the Hunter Squad, Mo Fan had come to understand a lot of knowledge which was not mentioned in the textbooks provided by school. One such tidbit was that Magcal Beasts were divided into different levels based on the evolved stage.Spirit Wolf, Colossal-eyed Ape Rat, One-eyed Magic Wolf; all those Magical Beasts which Mo Fan had encountered once before were all the lowest level, Servant class creatures!These servant class creatures were like butchers in the eyes of the non-Magicians, they were completely unable to fend them off!\u201cThe Blood Mark Colossal Rat that you saw in the Underground Hall is a Soldier class creature. The Darkwing Wolf is an even higher level Magical Beast Commander, and also one of the reasons behind the Blood Alert. Other than the Blood Mark Colossal Rat, there are hundreds of Three-eyed Magic Wolves outside of the safety border who are commanding numbers of One-eyed Magic Wolves as they\u2019re assaulting the Army. The perimeter which the Army can protect is very limited, there\u2019s roughly a thousand or so Magical Beasts who have invaded Bo City. Deng Kai of Hunter\u2019s Union is already commanding all of the Hunter Magicians to block off their route and kill the Magical Beasts in the city.\u201d Lin Yuxin said, trembling.\u201cWhy are there suddenly so many Magical Beasts attacking Bo City?\u201d Mo Fan was still having difficulty accepting this.\u201cBlack Vatican, it\u2019s the handiwork of the people from the Black Vatican,\u201d Lin Yuxin said.The Black Vatican?This wasn\u2019t Mo Fan\u2019s first time hearing of this organization!\u201cThey manufactured the Violent Spring, a kind of medicine that could come off as a counterfeit Underground Holy Spring. Its effects are entirely different from the Underground Holy Spring, however. Tthis kind of Violent Spring can arouse a Magical Beast\u2019s wild nature; causing them to basically lose control and go on a rampage. We currently do not know how Black Vatican was able to attract the Magic Wolf race to Bo City. However, they sprinkled the Violent Spring into the clouds and waited for a heavy rain to come so the Violent Spring could act as a dreadful catalyst; causing the entire Magic Wolf race to begin frenziedly assaulting Bo City,\u201d Lin Yuxin told him.Back when Lin Yuxin had discovered the Violent Spring waters, she had completely overlooked this point. Only when the calamity had descended did she abruptly come to a realization, causing her to break out in cold sweat.From how Lin Yuxin saw it, this something they had plotted for a long time. There was someone who wanted to use the population of Magical Beasts to thoroughly massacre Bo City!The only force who would do such a cruel thing was the Black Vatican!\u201cThe\u2026 what about now?\u201d Mo Fan asked as calmly as he could.\u201cThe objectives of the Black Vatican is to completely destroy Bo City, and have this place become Hell on Earth\u2026 The Darkwing Wolf is admittedly very strong, but it is not enough to turn all of Bo City into a slaughterhouse in just a day or two. However, if more Magical Beasts of the same class as the Darkwing Wolf appear, then even if our Bo City were to wait for reinforcements to arrive, there would practically be nothing left,\u201d Lin Yuxin said with an ice-cold gaze.Mo Fan turned silent, extremely silent.Facing this calamity, he himself could only turn into someone who ran from this. There was nothing he could do.\u201cMo Fan, you need to do two things now. One, protect the Underground Holy Spring. Do not let it fall into anyone else\u2019s hand in any situation\u2026 I have a premonition that the Black Vatican urgently need to obtain the Underground Holy Spring.\u201d Lin Yuxin\u2019s expression was extremely serious as she looked at Mo Fan.\u201cAnd the second thing is?\u201d Mo Fan asked.\u201cDo your best to survive the calamity this time. My identity is relatively sensitive, the people from the Black Vatican won\u2019t necessarily believe I have the Underground Holy Spring on me. Thus, I will now deliberately attract their attention. What you need to do is to hide as long as possible with the Underground Holy Spring, and survive for as long as possible. Don\u2019t let the people from the Black Vatican find it, and definitely do not let it fall into their hands,\u201d Lin Yuxin said.At this moment, Mo Fan had millions of f**k words firing past in his heart._Why are you putting this kind of hot thing into my hands?!?_Lin Yuxin saw there was some hesitation in Mo Fan, an agonized expression floated onto her face, yet she did not say anything.Lin Yuxin straightened her bloodstained white uniform, and then relentlessly chopped off her messy hair.Wearing the hat while possessing an heroic spirit, Lin Yuxin had already began to stride toward the bloodstained city that was being overrun by Magical Beasts. As she was running, she emotionlessly called back to Mo Fan, \u201cI will draw away all the people from the Black Vatican. As long as you are not stupid, do not meet one yourself, and successfully get to the established Safety area, then you will be fine.\u201dAfter saying this, Lin Yuxin quickly disappeared into the drifting heavy rain.In the midst of running, Lin Yuxin didn\u2019t turn her head around to look back at him.She knew that not everyone had a heart of justice, but she believed that every person had something they would sacrifice their lives to protect. The sister she had depended on had become the first victim of this plot, and thus, the only thing left she could protect was the Underground Holy Spring.\u2014Mo Fan stood there in amazement. Watching Lin Yuxin\u2019s figure from afar, he had no idea about what to say.Unfortunately, Mo Fan wasn\u2019t given any time to think about it. From his location at the very back, he saw a group of something in the middle of running down the back mountain of Tian Lan Magic High.Their bodies were incredibly robust, they easily knocked down several trees.They looked like a group of feral wolves that were rushing into a corral of sheep without fences. Their greed could be seen from their impatient speed._Shit, the school also has Magical Beasts running around, and there\u2019s quite a few of them, too!_* * *Translator: TofuEditor: REDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were Magicians and shelters for protection in there. It was roughly three kilometers from the mountain where Mo Fan was currently located. However, Mo Fan knew that he couldn\u2019t rely on his own strength to safely go through three kilometers of the city that were already crowded with numerous Magical Beasts.\u201cAlthough they don\u2019t have enough experience, they are still Magicians. I have to retreat to the Safety Area with them,\u201d Mo Fan said to himself.If he was to encounter a Magical Beast, Mo Fan could simultaneously use Lightning and Fire elements. Although he couldn\u2019t completely kill it, it wouldn\u2019t kill him, either. However, from how he saw it from his high location, it was clear that the One-eyed Magic Wolves weren\u2019t fighting by themselves. As long as two One-eyed Magic Wolves appeared, then Mo Fan would be unable to do anything._No matter what, let\u2019s first join with the students of the school. The power of a single person is too insignificant in this calamity, unless you are able to reach the same realm of Head Instructor, Zhankong._Mo Fan quickly hurried toward Tian Lan Magic High. At the bottom of this mountain, passing through a few old valleys, was the backdoor of Tian Lan Magic High.What he was happy about was the fact that this part of the city hadn\u2019t been overrun by a large amount of Magical Beasts. The civilians nearby were all either hiding in their basements, or escaping towards the Safety Shelters. The descent of calamity was too sudden, there was too many people who had been woken up from their beautiful dreams. As these people opened their eyes, they sank into the incomparably dreadful reality.The students were all in school today, putting in efforts for their once in a lifetime Magic High Exams. But they weren\u2019t prepared to face blood spilling battles, yet they had to welcome an unexpected Blood Calamity. The students who pissed their pants seeing Magical Beasts for the first time, just how would they react to a city overrun by Magical Beasts? It was truly difficult to imagine\u2026\u2014\u2014\u201cRetreat, you must hurry and retreat. This place is extremely unsafe!\u201d In the office, Xue Musheng slapped the table with a righteous indignation.Principal Zhu and the other School Directors were not present. The decision-making of the school was in the hands of the Head Disciplinary teacher, Chen Weiliang. However, Chen Weiliang persisted on having the students remain in school and form a defensive safety line with the teachers to resist the invasion of the Magical Beasts.Xue Musheng didn\u2019t think this was right. Although the numbers of students and teachers were enough, once more Magical Beasts appeared, the school would be unable to protect itself. The truly strong Magicians in Tian Lan Magic High were currently running around in Bo City. The current students and teachers could only rely on themselves.\u201cDirector, director, there are a large number of One-eyed Magic Wolves coming from the back of the mountain. Mr. Lan\u2026 was torn into a corpse.\u201d Mr. Zhou\u2019s complexion was deathly white.The faces of the teachers in the office completely changed.The truth is, even if they were a mature Magician, they had never encountered a calamity like this. Currently, the Magical Beasts were running amok in the city, they ate and shred anyone they saw. The teachers who didn\u2019t possess the ability to stand off against Magical Beasts were also so scared that their legs began to tremble.\u201cThe school has no shelter. If dozens of Magical Beasts simultaneously appeared, we will definitely suffer a disaster. This is Blood Alert! During Blood Alert, only those who reach a Safety Shelter will have a hope to survive!\u201d Xue Musheng roared hysterically.Did these teachers turn stupid from teaching Magic? There were records on the Blood Alerts. These records told the later generations that they shouldn\u2019t be relying on their own strength to stand off against the Magical Beasts outside of the Safety Shelters, the survival rate didn\u2019t even reach 30%!The first and second years students were all on holidays, so they were home. The third-year students were all called to the school for preparation of exams.Fortunately, the people at school this time were only third-year students. All of these students have gone through the Practicals, and encountered a Magical Beast. Their Magic foundations were very firm; if all of the fifteen hundred students and a hundred or so teachers were to work together, then there was no way they couldn\u2019t reach the Safety Shelters. The Safety Shelters were only three kilometers away from the school!\u201cRetreat, retreat. All homeroom teachers will lead their own class. All of the teaching teachers are to be divided into their corresponding class based on their average. We must reach the Safety Shelter zone as a team.\u201d Chen Weiliang finally made his decision.The school had in total seventeen hundred people. If being outside of the Safety Shelter zone during a Blood Alert only gave a 30% survival rate, then that would mean continuing to stay within the school would cost a thousand or more people their lives. How dreadful would that be?The teacher\u2019s execution during this time could be considered very fast. They quickly walked toward their own classrooms and had all of their students gather on campus grounds, preparing to leave.Not even five minutes after the decision was made, a Wind Teacher ran back to them while looking dejected and depressed as he told Chen Weiliang, \u201cThere\u2019s another forty One-eyed Magic Wolves appearing in the back of the mountain!\u201d\u201cRetreat, hurry up and retreat. Have the Practical Teachers withstand them no matter what, do not let any of these Magical Beast enter the school!\u201d Chen Weiliang turned pale with fright.The Wind Teacher\u2019s face was filled with pain.Fifty or so One-eyed Magic Wolves, and you\u2019re relying on just a few Practical Teachers to delay\u2026 How was that even possible?\u2014Xue Musheng hurriedly ran toward his Elite class.The strength of Elite class was high, the other classes had plenty of students who were still unable to completely cast their magic spells. They said that they have the combat prowess of fifteen hundred Magicians, but the truth was that there were only a few hundred people who were capable of facing Magical Beasts, and that was including those who were unable to cast Magic when faced against Magical Beasts._(Ed. Note: In other words, they\u2019re padding their own numbers and lying to themselves about how much they can fight.)_Just when he was about to enter the class, Xue Musheng crashed into a very familiar student, and was overjoyed over the unexpected good fortune. \u201cMo Fan, how come it\u2019s you?!\u201d\u201cI escaped here from the Underground Holy Spring\u2019s cell, and the school just happens to be close. Let\u2019s hurry and evacuate to the Safety Shelters, or else there will be more people dying. From the tone of the Vice Guard Captain of the Underground Holy Spring, the scariest part isn\u2019t the invasion of Magical Beasts.\u201d Mo Fan gasped for breath as he answered Xue Musheng.\u201cI also think that way, we are currently preparing to leave,\u201d Xue Musheng solemnly nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s good, this matter shouldn\u2019t be delayed, let\u2019s quickly leave this place\u2026 I just came from Qishan Park, I saw there were numerous of One-eyed Magic Wolves in the back of our mountain. I don\u2019t know where they popped up from.\u201d Mo Fan said.\u201cReally, in that case we must evacuate even faster!\u201d Xue Musheng was stunned.From how Mo Fan saw it, the scariest part of the current situation wasn\u2019t as simple as just a thousand Magical Beasts invading Bo City. From Mo Fan\u2019s previous location, he was able to see there were many Magical Beasts who had mysteriously appeared on the grounds. Other than One-eyed Magic Wolves, there were also Colossal-eyed Ape Rats.This meant that hiding in the underground basements was also not safe. The underground is basically the home of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rats, they would all be dug up and eaten!\u201cBrother Fan, it turns out to be you! Seeing you here is good,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou looked at Mo Fan as though he was looking at his own relatives, he was so emotional that his eyes nearly turned red.Recalling when they had encountered a Magical Beast for the first time, many people had lost consciousness from fear.Today, a large number of Magical Beast were leaving behind corpses and bloodstains in the city which they lived in. There were not many who was able to stay calm, there was already many girls who were crying.For the students, all of this came too suddenly. It was too scary, and they had no idea on the circumstances regarding their own families.Seeing the entire class sunken into fear and despair, it made Mo Fan recall the earthquake, tsunami, and storm-like calamities from his former world. In front of natural disaster, humans really were tiny. Even forming a group to fend off Magical Beasts, these people were still helpless.\u201cAwuuuuuuuu~~~!\u201dA howl suddenly came from the basketball court in the back of the mountain. The student who was sitting closest to the window gazed down, feeling an absolute terror as he discovered an One-eyed Magic Wolf had jumped down from the hill. Its vigorous body ferociously stomped on the basketball court.The entire cement court was deeply crushed, immediately broken to bits. That One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s scarlet red eye slowly looked up as it gazed at the delicious students inside the classroom with an incomparable greed.With their own two eyes, they saw this hungry and greedy wolf, and simultaneous shrieks from girls came from the school building.\u201cMa\u2026 Ma\u2026 Magical Beast!!!\u201d The male student sitting next to the window who was usually diligently studying went completely pale.Compared to the Spirit Wolf from before, this One-eyed Magic Wolf\u2019s evil tendencies seemed even worse. Looking at it face-to-face caused their entire bodies to go numb.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wind Magicians, go to the front and find us a path!\u201d Xue Musheng hastily yelled out.The students closest to the window began to frantically escape to the corridor. However, there were a large number of students from other classes in the corridor, they crowded around the place as they all lost their rationality while shrieking.Shrieking, cries, and the yells of the teachers had resounded throughout the entire corridor. It was a situation where it was difficult for even teachers to control.1Mo Fan was still standing in the corridor, cautiously watching those students who were frightened to death. His eyes displayed a bit of grief.They were just like a group of wild deer. As soon as a deer was frightened by a wolf, it would begin run away. Once all of the other deer saw this, they would also frantically try to escape. In reality, there was only one wolf, and as long as the deer stood united and raised their horns, a few more wild wolves would not necessarily be their match.This fear was contagious, even Mo Fan\u2019s former world was similar in this sense. Otherwise, how could so many shocking stampedes happen?The people in the classroom were all so scared that most of them took a step back, the skills they were taught on daily basis had all disappeared in this moment.\u201cLightning Strike, Mad Whip!\u201dA chant was resounded from the classroom. Mo Fan turned his head around and saw Xu Zhaoting had made his move in anger. Traces of ferocious Lightning emerged from the air.The traces of Lightning frantically whipped toward the One-eyed Magic Wolf under the control of Xu Zhaoting. Although the accuracy was somewhat lacking, there was still some lightning traces that hit the One-eyed Magic Wolf.The Lightning Arc pierced through and surged in turns. Every time it swept past the One-eyed Magic Wolf, it caused it to let out low howls of pain. The flesh of its body began to twitch beneath the might of the Mad Whip.\u201cHmph, just an One-eyed Magic Wolf scared them all into dogs, a group of cowards!\u201d Xu Zhaoting swept his gaze past the people who were lagging behind those who ran away, his gaze full of disdain.\u201cThat\u2019s right, we have so many people, why are we still scared of just a few One-eyed Magic Wolves?\u201d Wang Sanpang also stood up.Just as he finished speaking, Wang Sanpang used a short period of three seconds to finish his Earth Ripple spell.His pair of fat hands smacked onto the floor of the classroom, in an instant, a ripple circulated from the classroom all the way down to the cement campus grounds. The paralyzed One-eyed Magic Wolf was ferociously bumped into the other basketball hoop under the quick movements of Earth Ripple.Zhoumin could be considered to have some courage, she quickly finished her Fire Star Path and a ball of Fire Burst emerged in her grasp.Taking advantage of the One-eyed Magic Wolf having fallen down, Zhoumin\u2019s Fire Burst quickly streaked across the flagpole of the school as it accurately hit the One-eyed Magic Wolf that was being pressed beneath the basketball pole.Fire Burst: Burning Bone\u2019s might was naturally powerful. In an instant, it burned the backboard into ashes. The One-eyed Magic Wolf began to constantly howl under the fire as it rolled around the campus grounds.Soon enough, another few Magicians with different elements began to cast their spells from different locations. Judging by the level of their spells, it was clear that it was some Practical Teachers who cast them. Under their cooperation, they quickly turned the rash One-eyed Magic Wolf into a scorched carcass!Seeing the One-eyed Magic Wolf being quickly disposed of, Mo Fan slightly let out a sigh of relief. It seems like not all of the people in school were a group of losers.\u201cCome over here,\u201d Xue Musheng said to the seemingly calm students who remained in the classroom.Xu Zhaoting, Zhao Kunsan, Mu Bai, Zhoumin; these were the people who were able to directly face Magical Beasts back in Practicals. It had been a year since then, their fear toward Magical Beasts was no longer as deep as before.All of them came over. They didn\u2019t know why Xue Musheng had suddenly made them stay behind.\u201cOriginally, this kind of responsibility should be carried by the teachers. However, there are sightings of large numbers of One-eyed Magic Wolves in the back mountains, and the strength of our teachers is limited. Now, we have no choice but to draw support from the strengths of you students,\u201d Xue Musheng said with a seriousness that no one had seen before.\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s not waste too much time in this kind of time. If you have something to say, hurry up and spill it.\u201d Wang Sanpang couldn\u2019t help but speak up.\u201cWe need a Vanguard Squad. I\u2019m afraid the Vanguard Squad will mainly be comprised of students.\u201cThe Vanguard Squad will be separated from the Main Group, practically independent. Furthermore, they have to walk ahead of the Main Group.\u201cThe nearly two thousand people from our school will follow the path opened by the Vanguard Squad. Your group has the strongest combat prowess amongst our entire school, you are definitely not inferior to any teacher. Thus, we hope you can form a Vanguard Squad that can show everyone the way to the Safety Shelters,\u201d Xue Musheng said.As this was said, all of these students turned silent. For a few moments, they were unable to unable to process this plan.The truth is, they themselves didn\u2019t know if they were able to fight against Magical Beasts after they separated themselves from the main group. Having them become the Vanguard Squad, the risk was indeed quite big.\u201cThis decision is up to yourselves, we won\u2019t force you. If you aren\u2019t willing, then I will go and find other students. We will just be delayed for a bit longer and the danger will be a bit larger\u2026 This Vanguard Squad will be led by me, please give me your response as soon as possible, alright?\u201d Xue Musheng said.\u201cMrs. Xue, I\u2019ll join.\u201d Zhoumin had no hesitation, she took the initiative and joined the Vanguard Squad first.\u201cI will also join.\u201d Xu Zhaoting also didn\u2019t ponder over it too much.Wang Sanpang and Xu Zhaoting were good friends. Since Xu Zhaoting have already joined, he could only join with a bitter face.Xue Musheng slightly nodded. With a Lightning Magician here, the Squad\u2019s combat prowess would be one level higher. They should be able to successfully arrive at the Safety Shelters.\u201cI will also join.\u201dMu Bai and his henchman Zhao Kunsan glanced at each other, and then finally chose to join.Following this, an Earth element student with an exceptionally good grade also joined.Zhang Xiaohou however left his gaze on Mo Fan, it seemed as though he was processing this plan.\u201cBrother Fan, are we following the main group or are we choosing the Vanguard Squad?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou asked.\u201cLet\u2019s join the Vanguard,\u201d Mo Fan replied.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Brother Fan was also a man with high principles.\u201d Zhang Xiaohou was really able to find joy in sorrows. He was still able to make a joke in this kind of situation.\u201cGoing with the main group is even more dangerous,\u201d Mo Fan said indifferently.\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhang Xiaohou asked, puzzled.The main group had at least seventeen hundred people. With that kind of colossal number, even if they were to suffer the attacks of a group of Magical Beasts, they still wouldn\u2019t be in much danger. After all, the seventeen hundred people were practically Magicians.\u201cYou saw what just happened. With the appearance of a single One-eyed Magic Wolf, the entire floor panicked. That is the instinct of weaklings; not only are they transmitting fear to each other, they are also able to magnify the fear infinitely. Thus, the Main Group\u2019s battle prowess will be limited. If I\u2019m not wrong, then just a hundred Magical Beasts will completely wipe out the main group. With such a large group of people walking, that is equivalent to easily attracting a group of Magical Beasts, or even higher level Magical Beasts. I don\u2019t want to be associated with a large group of sheep. When their time comes, whether they live or die is not something they are in control of,\u201d Mo Fan whispered to Zhang Xiaohou.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: REDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had never considered this point.Zhang Xiaohou himself was unable to distinguish whether what Mo Fan said was right or wrong, he just subconsciously believed in Mo Fan\u2019s choice.Zhang Xiaohou actually did not know that Mo Fan could be considered a Hunter Magician with experience in hunting Beasts. Being influenced by that kind of environment caused Mo Fan to understand one very important principle, and that was to never think a large number of people would equal being powerful. Why would the Hunter\u2019s Union only form smaller squads to go hunting Beasts in the outside world? Could it be that they didn\u2019t know that the more people there were, the safer it was? The truth was, the more people there were, the easier it was for them to attract the attention of large numbers of Magical Beasts, and easier for them to become livestock for the higher level Magical Beasts.The amount of people in the Vanguard Squad couldn\u2019t be considered that many. If they were to meet a large number of Magical Beasts, they could most likely evade them. Their movements would be less restricted, and the decision to fight or escape could be made very quickly.However, if they were in the main group\u2026If they didn\u2019t meet large numbers of Magical Beasts, then they were safe and sound. However, if they did attract the attention of a Soldier-class creature and its group of Magical Beasts, then the main group would definitely get massacred. In this kind of massacre, your life would no longer be in your own control.\u2014The Vanguard Squad had ten people in total, Xue Musheng was in charge of it.After passing through the gate of the school, they were no longer able to see anyone on the streets.Trashwas everywhere, with shattered goods from the vendor stalls being flipped over and stores with their doors wide open, yet no one was watching\u2026When the Blood Alert was sounded, all of the civilians either hid in their houses, or they began to run toward the Safety Shelters with all their might; causing a complete mess. This was also the main reason why the people from the school were not able to retreat in time.However, there were still a large amount of people who hadn\u2019t retreated to the Safety Shelters. When Tian Lan Magic High began to move toward the Safety Shelters, many of the civilians in the vicinity began to rush over. They wanted to use the strength of the students and teachers of Tian Lan Magic High to safely pass through this three kilometers of dreadful street blocks.The Vanguard Squad was walking at the very front of the main group. Zhang Xiahou moved to the top of a building and quickly saw this scene of civilians gathering toward the school\u2026\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019ll be over four thousand people in this move. In this area of the city, there are many people who didn\u2019t reach the Safety Shelters in time. They didn\u2019t dare to move by themselves, so now they\u2019re like iron dust on magnets as they constantly get absorbed into the main group from different locations,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou said to everyone after he jumped down from the old building.\u201cMmm, with more people, they should be able to prevent the attack of some smaller groups of Magical Beasts. However, they will also become a burden for the entire main group,\u201d Xue Musheng observed coolly.Magic High Schools were different from Magic Universities. The students of Magic Universities had more battle prowess than regular army mages, but Magic High Schools nurtured groups of magic student apprentices who weren\u2019t even eighteen. A student able to protect themselves in this Blood Alert could already be considered good, protecting a mass of people was really too far-fetched.\u201cThis is also something we can\u2019t do anything about, it\u2019s not like we can throw them away and ignore them,\u201d Zhoumin said.\u201cLet\u2019s go, now that the main group has increased to four thousand people, the burden on us has also increased,\u201d Xue Musheng said.Everyone nodded.\u201cZhang Xiaohou, Zhang Yinglu, the two Wind Magicians are responsible for finding us a path. The others will closely follow behind.\u201dIt was clear that Xue Musheng was a teacher who had gone through military training. He had some experience with deploying and troop formation, having some plans on what to do in this kind of situation.\u2014The movement of the ten people could be considered rather quick. Passing through the main street after leaving the school gates and along the pedestrian lane, then going through the small area of houses with elevators would allow them to see the Safety Shelters.The main street was around one kilometer long, and was completely blocked by abandoned cars. Let\u2019s not even talk about a school bus being able to pass through, even a bike would have difficulty finding a smooth path.Vehicle traffic was basically blocked, they could only rely on walking to get there. Three kilometers; it was far, yet not that far. It was short, yet not that short. Whether something would happen was out of their hands.\u201cThere\u2019s a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat in the book kiosk to the front.\u201d Zhang Yinglu\u2019s complexion was white as she ran back with gasping for breath.\u201cIt is chewing on a child,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou added.By the time the two of them had discovered it, the child was already dead. But this kind of bloody scene had fallen into their eyes, sad and frightening.After continuing their advance, they moved past a big bus that was diagonally parked and blocking the street. They were able to see the book kiosk dyed by blood, and the ten or so year-old little boy that was laying in the pool of blood.\u201cWhere\u2019s the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat?\u201d Xue Musheng creased his brow. He was looking around, but he couldn\u2019t even find the shadows of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat they were talking about.\u201cIt was just\u2026\u201d\u201cGugugugu!!\u201dJust when Zhang Yinglu was about to say something, a furred creature ferociously jumped out of the rear of a Volkswagen to the side, its two large incisors biting at Zhang Yinglu, who was caught completely unprepared._Puuuchi~_Zhang Yinglu was a very thin and weak girl. Her neck was torn out by the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat in front of the stunned Squad, her life\u2019s-blood began to spurt out all over the advertisements on the side of the bus.This scene was too sudden!Even Mr. Xue Musheng did not have any kind of preparation for it. He was standing right next to Zhang Yinglu as the blood from her neck splashed over his face.\u201cHide in the bus, hurry!\u201d In the instant the stunning change happened, Mo Fan shouted at everyone.Everyone woke up from their daydreams as they staggered toward the bus.Xue Musheng\u2019s reaction could be considered quite fast, he pulled Zhang Yinglu along as he jumped into the bus. The dreadful Colossal-eyed Ape Rat was going to continue its massacre, but had crashed into the doorway of the bus due its body shape.The other people were also somewhat frantic, they also hid themselves in a bus.As Xu Zhaoting saw Zhang Yinglu being killed like that, he began to chant the power of Lightning in his rage.Mo Fan originally wanted to link his Star Path also. However, the Beast-Seeking powder that he sprinkled had actually floated in different directions, causing him to suddenly realize something!\u201cEveryone, climb onto the bus, there is more than just a single Colossal-eyed Ape Rat here!\u201d Mo Fan shouted. As he said this, Mo Fan interrupted Zhoumin, who was casting magic, dragging her toward the bus.\u201cMonkey, stop looking after Zhang Yinglu, she is already dead. Hurry up and draw that Colossal-eyed Ape Rat away, or else we will all die here!!\u201d Mo Fan ran as he yelled toward Zhang Xiaohou.Zhang Xiaohou could be considered the calm one, he had already cast his Wind Path during the attack of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat. Zhang Xiaohou wanted to go and save Zhang Yinglu. Unfortunately, what he did not know was that after the attack of a Magical Beast, there were not many Primary Magicians who were able to do much.Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s eyes began to redden.He blinked, the girl who had been in the same class as him had died just like that! This godforsaken Magical Beast!!!!* * *Translator: TofuEditor: RED*[Long Taos]: side characters in Chinese operas who perform acrobatics and fight scenes*[12.47 to 13.07]: don\u2019t ask me about the tree sapPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Using the second level of Wind Track, Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s figure nimbly passed through the chaotically parked cars. Whenever the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat wanted to slice open Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s chest with his claws, he always ended up hitting the stream of air left behind by Zhang Xiaohou.\u201cMonkey, be careful, there\u2019s another one!\u201d Mo Fan already climbed on top of the bus. With one glance, he saw the figure with fierce fur arching its body as it hid itself behind the advertisement board by the bus stop.Zhang Xiaohou was moving in high speed as a large rat with fierce teeth was tenaciously pursuing him, how could he have the time to even consider the position of the other Colossal-eyed Ape Rat?Mo Fan had used the Beast-seeking powder to find the unexpectedly sly Colossal-eyed Ape Rat.These Magical Beasts had always lived in an environment where the strong ate the weak. Their methods were much more savage than the humans who had been living safely in the city. Magicians who had not truly gone through hunting beasts would also get killed like Zhang Yinglu. Even being a Wind Magician, she did not know that she needed to have her Wind Track on at all times.\u201cLook, its neck is stretching.\u201d Zhoumin hastily said to Mo Fan as she saw the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat that was behind the public transportations advertisement board.As Mo Fan saw this, he began to curse to himself.Colossal-eyed Ape Rat\u2019s abilities were not just mere biting and scratching, its most dreadful attack was the scarlet red beam that was shot from its eyes. That was a frightening power that was capable of penetrating a person\u2019s body.At this moment, the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat\u2019s gaze was precisely locked onto Zhang Xiaohou.\u201cDazzle, Blind!\u201dJust when Mo Fan was getting extremely anxious, Xue Musheng yelled out as he carried an awe-inspiring power in his voice.Suddenly, a milky white light ball emerged in front of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat that was stretching its neck, and emitted a bright radiance.This radiance was extremely fierce, the paint on the advertisement looked as though it was being melted by the heat of the light. The students inside the buses hastily closed their eyes, yet they were still able to feel the burn from the fierce light.The dazzling light exploded in front of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat, the fierce light was like the edge of swords as it entered the widened eye of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat. You could see the Rat\u2019s cornea began to burn, furthermore, it spread to the entire eyesocket of the rat!The Colossal-eyed Ape Rat who was ready to use its scarlet red light beam was burned blind by the light. It let out sounds of grief as it crashed into everything in its surroundings.At this this time, Zhang Xiaohou finally realized there was one more Colossal-eyed Ape Rat located by the bus stop\u2019s advertisement board. He quickly changed his position, and shook off the monster that was chasing him before returning to everyone.\u201cMr. Xue, thank you!\u201d Zhang Xiaohou panted.This dazzling light directly blinded a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat that was a threat to everyone. As for the remaining rat, when they all had time to link their Star Paths, then this animal would no longer be able to hurt them!The first one to take action was Mo Fan. He was the one who finished his Star Path the fastest amongst them, and his third level Fire Magic could be said as not giving the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat any time to hide. An indignant rupturing flame grandly exploded in front of the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat that had killed Zhang Yinglu._Beep beep beep beep~_As it exploded, it instantly triggered the ear-piercing alarms of the cars. Numerous car windows were shattered beneath Mo Fan\u2019s Fire Burst: Rupture.The Colossal-eyed Ape Rat was sent flying into the iron roll-up door of a milk tea store from the explosion. The fur on its body was burned to crisp, its flesh were split, you could see the shattered pieces of windows were stabbed into its flesh and muscles.Xue Musheng turned his head around and studied the fire-hurling Mo Fan who had hurt the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat. Pleasant astonishment flashed in his eyes.It truly deserved to be called the third level of Fire Burst. Its power had actually caused a Magical Beast to have difficulties getting back up. As long as this Vanguard Squad had a powerful student like Mo Fan, then they probably wouldn\u2019t get completely wiped out.\u201cThat freaking animal, I will skin it!\u201d Wang Sanpang and Zhang Xiaohou appeared exceptionally angry.Just a few minutes before, that animal had bitten their female classmate to death. In just a few more days, she would have entered the beautiful Magic University; however, she ended up being killed by this kind of ugly thing. Just who would be able to suppress the anger from the depths of their heart in this kind of situation?\u201cDon\u2019t go, it hasn\u2019t died yet!\u201d Mo Fan immediately berated them in a loud voice.Just as Wang Sanpang was going to take revenge for Zhang Yinglu, the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat who looked as though it was about to die suddenly jumped up, its killing incisors snapping toward Wang Sanpang.Wang Sanpang\u2019s complexion changed, and he subconsciously rolled to the side.The sharp incisor bit down, and bit off a bloody chunk from Wang Sanpang\u2019s shoulder. As everyone saw this, they couldn\u2019t help but gasp.\u201cAnimal, go die!\u201d Under the rage of Xu Zhaoting, the Lightning traces swirling around his body were like a lightning whip as they lashed toward the incredibly sly Colossal-eyed Ape Rat.Lightning Strike: Mad Whip\u2019s might could be considered quite ferocious. It mutilated the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat further, and adding in the repeated electric arcs running through its body caused it to unable to budge, all it could do was lay on the ground and squeal in pain.Wang Sanpang frantically crawled back to the bus, the blood flowed out from his shoulder. His face was deathly pale and filled with fear.Xu Zhaoting, Zhoumin, and Zhang Shuhua continued to bombard the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat with magic, smashing it into pieces.This time, the Colossal-eyed Ape Rat could not be any more dead. However, everyone\u2019s faces didn\u2019t have a single sign of loosening up.So this was a genuine Magical Beast??It only took them a second to kill people, even a speck of carelessness would send a Magician\u2019s life to the underworld!\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s good that you reminded us, or else Wang Sanpang would have ended up like Zhang Yinglu,\u201d Xu Zhaoting said to Mo Fan in shock.Xue Musheng nodded repeatedly. Even he didn\u2019t imagine that the Vanguard Squad he had formed with the strongest students would have someone dying and wounded on their first encounter with a Magical Beast.\u201cMo Fan, you seem to have some deep understanding of Magical Beast\u2019s characters. Why don\u2019t you take command of the squad, me and He Yu will be responsible for defense. He Yu\u2026 saying these kind of things in this kind of situation is excessive, but you saw with your own eyes how Zhang Yinglu was killed. This is not the time to squat on the floor trembling and crying for the lives of the passed ones. Either way, could you please cast your Water defensive spell when the next Magical Beast attacks any of us, or else the remaining nine of us may not be able to survive until the Safety Shelter\u2026 and the four thousand or so people following behind us would also lose their direction from this point on.\u201d Xue Musheng walked over to He Yu, who was so scared that her consciousness was distracted as he spoke quietly and sincerely.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I really am sorry. I\u2026.I am unable to finish the Star Path\u2026\u201d He Yu\u2019s face was filled with teardrops. She was really afraid, she was afraid that she would end up like Zhang Yinglu.\u201cDo your best. As long as you are able to cast a Water Barrier, then that would mean you are able to save our lives. I believe you can do it,\u201d Xue Musheng said.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: REDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Versatile MageChapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0GravityTales\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0GravityTalesMo Fan glanced at He Yu, who was choking with emotions as she cried, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Xiaoke was also a Water Magician, she had also grasped the second level of Water Barrier. However, when facing a Magical Beast, He Yu was no different from a normal girl, and was unable to cast a spell. If the other people within the squad were like that, then there would be more people dying the next time they met Magical Beasts.At the moment, Mo Fan didn\u2019t know just how many would lose their lives, he could only force himself to advance along this road.\u201cSince Mr. Xue wants me to lead this squad, then I hope everyone will keep in mind what I said. We may not smoothly arrive at the Safety Shelters, but at the very least, we will be able to prevent unnecessary deaths.\u201d Mo Fan looked as though he had lost his spirit as he spoke to the Vanguard Squad.This Vanguard Squad had viewed the Magical Beasts as being too simple, the one in the practicals was just practice. Before the Spirit Wolf had gone berserk, it did not have any intention of killing the students. Genuine Magical Beast were definitely not like this. They would use any and all methods to kill humans, even if they knew that they would die, they would still use their last remaining strength to drag one more down with them. Magical Beast lived in an environment where they killed each other, they understood very well the techniques to kill others.\u201cThe primary Magical Beasts which we will be facing are of two kinds: Colossal-eyed Ape Rats and One-eyed Magic Wolves. Colossal-eyed Ape Rats can be considered easier to deal with, the scary ones are One-eyed Magic Wolves. Their cruelty and slyness is way above that of Colossal-eyed Ape Rats. If we happen to encounter three or more One-eyed Magic Wolves, then don\u2019t hesitate, split up and escape by yourselves. If the luck is on our side, then only three of us will die. If we don\u2019t run, then everyone will die,\u201d Mo Fan said resolutely and decisively.The truth is, if two One-eyed Magic Wolves appeared at same time, that be enough to bring a life-threatening blow to this Vanguard Squad. Currently, Mo Fan only wished to let his classmates understand that the dread of Magical Beasts was thousands of times scarier than what was described in the classes!_This is no longer a practice, nor is this an practical, this is battle that involves life and death! If you win, you\u2019ll live. If you lose, you\u2019ll die!_Xu Zhaoting, Wang Sanpang, Zhoumin, Mu Bai, Zhao Kunsan, Zhang Xiaohou, He Yu, Zhang Shuhua and Xue Musheng were all looking at Mo Fan attentively. The reminder Mo Fan had given them was to allow everyone to avoid casualties their first time. While they were attentively listening to him, they were also thinking to themselves, _Why is Mo Fan, a third-year High School student just like them, so much sharper than everyone else?_Mo Fan told everyone the easier mistakes that could be made, just like the foolish action by Wang Sanpang. _You should not approach any Magical Beast that looks like it is dead, it will use its last remaining strength to drag you down with it!_\u201cMonkey, you\u2019re responsible for finding the path. Execute this cautiously,\u201d Mo Fan warned Zhang Xiaohou.Zhang Xiaohou nodded repeatedly, he would listen to everything Mo Fan said!\u201cMu Bai, prepare your Ice Spread at all times. Remember that your Ice Spread is currently used to protect everyone, don\u2019t count on freezing the faster Magical Beasts,\u201d Mo Fan said to Mu Bai.Mu Bai creased his brow, he wanted to say something, but he ended up swallowing those words back down.He had a huge prejudice against Mo Fan; however, compared to the lives of everyone, including his own, this kind of prejudice was indeed very insignificant. He nodded his head to show he understood how he should be using Ice Spread.After Mo Fan quickly explained things to everyone, he couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath.In fact, he himself did not know whether they would be able to safely pass through this three kilometer-long road of death. He just hoped everyone\u2019s luck would be good and they would not encounter three One-eyed Magic Wolves at the same time.\u2014\u2014The Squad continued to advance. They encountered no other Magical Beasts along this one kilometer-long main street. However, they did find a few old people who were unable to retreat to the Safety Shelters in time within the residential buildings.The Vanguard Squad was unable to escort any civilians, Xue Musheng could only tell these old people to follow the main group after they got here, or else they would really be in danger.Practically every road was blocked. Occasionally, they\u2019d see some people who made a vain attempt to drive their cars to the Safety Shelters. In the end, they had to abandon their car along the blocked roads and switch to walking.Seeing the people on the road, Xue Musheng and Zhoumin would tell them to first find a place to hide and wait for the main group.\u2014After traversing the main street, they quickly arrived at the Mingyuan District.The Mingyuan District could be considered relatively higher end in Bo City, having buildings with elevators. The entire district was decorated like a small park in the city. The space it occupied was quite large. Passing through all four of the ABCD Districts of Mingyuan District would be nearly a kilometer of distance.No one knew how many people there were who hadn\u2019t retreated yet in the large number of buildings, they believed being in the these tall buildings would keep them safe.The fences around the Mingyuan District were useless. Mo Fan could see a few of them broken down already, this meant there were definitely a few Magical Beasts inside this relatively large area.After passing through the backdoor of this area, a pond entered everyone\u2019s eyes. A security guard\u2019s body was floating there, and the water in the pond had also turned crimson red.The heavy rain had started to slow, this meant the bloodstains in this city were increasingly harder to clean. Seeing these bloodstains everywhere, the Vanguard Squad all got goosebumps passing through this place.\u201cDo you hear that? There\u2019s something yelling in this building,\u201d Zhoumin whispered to Mo Fan.Mo Fan walked toward one of the buildings. Through the glass, he was able to vaguely see a shadow that did not belong to a human pass by the window of the building.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and move forwards.\u201d Mo Fan did not investigate further.Zhoumin nodded her head, no longer daring to say anything else.As they walked a few steps forward, their pathfinder, Zhang Xiaohou, who was searching for a way forwards, returned in haste.\u201cThere are more than five Colossal-eyed Ape Rats ahead, we must go around,\u201d Zhang Xiaohou told them.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s use the other road,\u201d Mo Fan agreed as he patted Zhang Xiaohou\u2019s shoulders to show he did a good job.Zhang Xiaohou could only force a smile. If he did not force himself to grow in this kind of environment, then he would only become a burden for the squad. Zhang Xiaohou himself was also prone to panic. However, seeing Mo Fan still able to give a cool-headed response, he subconsciously felt a bit more brave.After going around the five Rats, they had passed through half of the district. The entire process could be considered threatening, but not dangerous.\u201cThere\u2019s a Colossal-eyed Ape Rat drinking by the swimming pool.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go around it.\u201d\u201cWhy, we can clearly kill it and then directly pass by this place.\u201d Zhang Shuhua was puzzled.\u201cDon\u2019t fight insignificant battles. Currently, our mana is more precious than water in a desert.\u201dThe nine of them safely passed through Mingyuan District. Considering that there was a large group following behind them, Mo Fan also chose a route that was relatively spacious and a more sensible, or they\u2019d be congested and would attract an attack from a group of Magical Beasts, which would be dangerous.* * *Translator: TofuEditor: REDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
