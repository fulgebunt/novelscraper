He felt relieved and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeves.\u201cWait\u2026 No!\u201d\u201cThat was not a dream!\u201d\u00a0He was suspicious of what he had seen in the dream.In fact, it was hard to believe that everything he had experienced with Princess Chi Yao was just a dream!Zhang Ruochen was the only child of Emperor Ming, one of the nine great emperors in Kunlun\u2019s Field. Before his death, he was a talented warrior, sophisticated, with an incredible physical quality and thus cultivated the completion of the Heaven Realm, the highest level in Martial Arts, at the young age of 16.However, when he became the first person in the younger generation of Kunlun\u2019s Field, he died at the hands of his childhood sweetheart and fiancee, Princess Chi Yao.Princess Chi Yao was the daughter of Emperor Qing, one of the nine great emperors.Back in the old days, Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing were best friends. They even arranged the marriage between Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao. The childhood lovers grew up and practiced Martial Arts together. Zhang Ruochen was an attractive, talented young man while Chi Yao was a pretty and elegant lady. They were known as \u201cthe perfect match\u201d throughout the field of Martial Arts. Their marriage would have been the hottest subject in the entire Kunlun\u2019s Field.However, Zhang Ruochen had never expected that Princess Chi Yao would indeed put him to death.Unfortunately, he could not prevent what was going to happen to him. Now, it was 800 years later when he arose from the dead.Princess Chi Yao had lived a different life since then. She settled the Incident of the Nine Emperors, united the Nine Empires, and built the First Central Empire. She even dominated the empire and became Empress Chi Yao, the backbone of the entirety of Kunlun\u2019s Field.After all, the Nine Emperors who once ruled over Kunlun\u2019s Field 800 years ago had disappeared among the endless flow of history.The Nine Emperors died and then the empress took over.Every era had its own sovereignty, and this era was no exception\u2014the one and only emperor who conquered the region and led the kingdom was Empress Chi Yao.\u201cWhy did she kill me? How could she be so cruel? Is it true that every woman in this world is ruthless?\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen was desperate and confused.All the suspicions revolved around Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head. His sharp penetrating eyes, heavy disconcerted heart, and a doubtful brain\u2026 but no one could help him.800 years had passed. Everything changed except for Empress Chi Yao, who cultivated her stunning appearance and immortality. Even Zhang Ruochen\u2019s family and friends had passed away and were buried underneath the soil.Not to mention the prestigious and honorable Nine Emperors, who only left over some splendid stories to be read with admiration for posterity.\u201cCreak!\u201dA fragile-looking woman who was dressed in the imperial uniform came into the room while Zhang Ruochen was lying in bed. She looked at him with concern and gently asked, \u201cChen-er, did you have a bad dream again?\u201dConcubine Lin, who was the pretty woman standing in front of Zhang Ruochen, was his mother in this life, as well as the wife of the Yunwu Commandery Prince.Indeed, the owner of this body had died in bed three days ago from an illness.Zhang Ruochen arose from the dead and appeared in this feeble body after being killed by Princess Chi Yao. Without knowing how, he brought the dead young man back to life. What a coincidence, the name of this young man was also called Zhang Ruochen.When Zhang Ruochen first arose from the dead, he was struggling to talk to Concubine Lin. Somehow, in his eyes, she was just a stranger.And yet, after being around her for three days, Zhang Ruochen gradually realized that Concubine Lin indeed thoroughly cared about him. Furthermore, knowing that he had woken up in the middle of the night frightened by nightmares, Concubine Lin rushed to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s room no matter how bad the weather was.In Zhang Ruochen\u2019s last lifetime, he had never seen his mother. It seemed that his mother had died after giving birth to him. He never imagined that after being put to death by someone that he loved the most, he would have been given another chance to live again in another body and have a mother who would take care of him, to let him feel the warmth that he had never experienced.Zhang Ruochen thought.\u00a0\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t know that her own son has already been dead for three days!\u201dIf Zhang Ruochen told her the truth, she might not be able to handle the grievous news. He would rather keep his mouth shut about it and pretend like nothing ever happened. To Zhang Ruochen, it was a \u201ctwo bird, one stone\u201d situation that he got to live again, and additionally, Concubine Lin had her son back.Looking at the beautiful Concubine Lin, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes became gentle. \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry about me. It was just a dream.\u201d he said with a smile to his mother.The thin Concubine Lin was sitting at the bedside of Zhang Ruochen, wearing a red marten fur coat to keep warm. She rubbed his forehead, looking worried. \u201cIt\u2019s the third night that you\u2019ve woken up with nightmares. You keep mentioning the name \u2018Chi Yao\u2019 every time. Who exactly is she?\u201d Concubine Lin whispered.Concubine Lin could not link this name \u201cChi Yao\u201d to the First Central Empire Empress Chi Yao.In fact, Empress Chi Yao named herself the \u201cHoly Queen of Majesty and Morality\u201d after uniting Kunlun\u2019s Field and building the First Central Empire. Since then, no one dared to mention the two words \u201cChi Yao\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing mom, you must have misheard me!\u201d Zhang Ruochen comforted his mother.Concubine Lin said with a sigh, \u201cNever mention the two words \u2018Chi Yao\u2019 again. Not even in your dreams. That was the name of Empress Chi Yao. Saying the Empress\u2019 name is very impolite. If someone heard you say this, you might be subject to death!\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded his head, pinched his fingers, and said as an apology, \u201cNever again, my mother!\u201dZhang Ruochen felt outraged knowing what Chi Yao had done to him, and noticing the fear from his mother talking about Chi Yao, he furiously made a resolution.\u00a0\u201cI will be your nightmare forever after!\u201dLooking at the thin and pale Zhang Ruochen, Concubine Lin exhaled deeply and felt exceptional sorrow.Zhang Ruochen was always sick ever since he was born. Being raised in a Commandery Prince\u2019s family with the best doctors and medication did not help him much. He was 16 years old now, but still needed to rest in bed all the time. Perhaps this would be how he would live for the rest of his life.All of a sudden, there was a great sound of footsteps outside the palace.\u201cWhat are you guys doing here? Who authorized you to come and mess around the Jade Palace?\u201d said a good-looking maidservant who wanted to stop the Eighth Prince from breaking into the palace. Yet she was being pushed, and she fell 10 meters away.The Eighth Prince was a warrior who cultivated himself to reach the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. He could probably knock a 300 pound stone tray 10 feet with nothing but his fist, never mind a maidservant who only weighed 100 pounds.With a slight flick of his finger, the maidservant would seem as if she had been struck with a mighty force.She plummeted to the ground and, breaking her left arm, let out a wild scream.The Eighth Prince was wearing a Golden-Thread dress, covered with a jade belt resting on his waist. He was muscular and strong, making every footstep steady as he walked into the Jade Palace. He stared at the court maid and said, \u201cYou\u2019re blocking my way, slave? You don\u2019t deserve to be in my presence!\u201dBehind the Eighth Prince, there were six royal guards wearing kylin armor, tall and solid. They were all martial arts monks that excelled at their craft and were part of the royal security guards.Concubine Lin noticed the noise outside. She comforted Zhang Ruochen, closed the door, and proceeded to the Jade Palace.With a slight scowl on her face, she stood in front of the Eighth Prince, who was now inside the palace, and said, \u201cThis is the Jade Palace. Even though you are a prince, you still can\u2019t break in here.\u201dEighth Prince Zhang Ji lifted his head and stared at Concubine Lin. \u201cThe queen commands that the place of Concubine Lin and my ninth brother will now move to Ziyi Side Hall. From now on, the Jade Palace will belong to my biological mother, Concubine Xiao,\u201d said the Eighth Prince.Concubine Lin appeared slightly unsettled. She had already anticipated that this day would come but did not expect it to arrive so soon.Concubine Lin smiled sadly and said, \u201cThe queen demands us to leave the Jade Palace. Ruochen and I will move to the side hall tomorrow!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Concubine Lin, but my mother wants to move to the Jade Palace tonight. Please leave here right away!\u201d the Eighth Prince responded.Knowing that Zhang Ruochen was weak and could not bear to move around, Concubine Lin appealed to the Eighth Prince and said, \u201cYou know that Ruochen is very fragile, and it is getting late and colder outside now. What if\u2026\u201dThe Eighth Prince sneered and exclaimed. \u201cConcubine Lin, there are so many poor people in this world and not every one of them is worth the help. If my ninth brother is that weak, then what is the point of him staying alive?\u201d\u201cHe is your brother!\u201d Concubine Lin yelled at the Eighth Prince.Concubine Lin was about to say something, but suddenly the door behind her opened up.It was Zhang Ruochen. Though he was weak and could barely stand, while leaning on the door, he stared at the Eighth Prince and said, \u201cDon\u2019t beg for their mercy, we shall leave now!\u201d Zhang Ruochen looked sick, but his strong determination to protect his mother never wavered.\u201cChen-er, why did you leave your bed? It\u2019s freezing outside! Go back to your room and stay warm!\u201d Concubine Lin was worried at the thought of Zhang Ruochen getting ill, so she immediately helped him back to his room.Zhang Ruochen shook his head firmly and said, \u201cMom, we don\u2019t need to beg anyone. One day, we\u2019ll be back here. We will be back in Jade Palace!\u201dConcubine Lin was touched by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s determination. She nodded her head with tears in her eyes.Concubine Lin held him and left the Jade Palace. Other than the maidservant who had broken her arm from being hit by the Eighth Prince, every one of the helpers had to stay for their own well-being.Everyone in the place noticed that Concubine Lin and the Ninth Prince had completely lost their power. There was barely any chance of them reclaiming back their power in the Commandery Prince\u2019s mansion.The maidservants who were working for Concubine Lin in the Jade Palace had prudently chosen to stay behind and work for the new master, the Eighth Prince.After being kicked out by the Eighth Prince, Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen had been relocated to Ziyi Side Hall. It was usual for the queens who had lost their power. It was quiet, far from the palace, and felt like it had been empty for a long time.The cold wind was bleak on this late night.Sitting on a freezing stone chair, the frail Zhang Ruochen wore a thick coat. Yet, during this frigid winter, he still felt exceptionally cold.\u201cThis body is too weak! The only way to build up this body is through practicing Martial Arts. If I don\u2019t, even with my status as the son of the Commandery Prince, my mother and I will only be manipulated by others.\u201d\u00a0thought Zhang Ruochen.800 years had passed, Zhang Ruochen did not know where he would be welcome. Now that it was arranged for him to live again within this body, he did not care if it was for seeking revenge on Empress Chi Yao, or for the mother who took care of him\u2013he needed to be strong either way.The humiliation they had suffered was all because of the weakness of Zhang Ruochen. With no resistance, he had no control over his own destiny. Even the place that he lived had been snatched away. All of this built up the motivation for Zhang Ruochen to come back as a capable man, to protect his mother and take back control of his own fate.Zhang Ruochen knew that if he wanted people to respect him and wanted a better place to live, then he needed to be a warrior, and prove to everyone out there that he was capable of being a warrior.To be a warrior in Kunlun\u2019s Field, obtaining the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d was the first essential step.The so-called \u201cSacred Mark\u201d was the qualification given by the gods for humans to practice Martial Arts. People who did not open the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d would never cultivate Genuine Qi, and hence, could never be the leader of heaven and earth.Zhang Ruochen was already 16 and still had not obtained the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.People would miss out on the best ages for cultivation after the age of 16. Even if the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d had been opened after that, not a lot of achievements would be made.Both the Eighth Prince and Zhang Ruochen were the sons of the Yunwu Commandery Prince. Why did the Eighth Prince have a more prestigious status that allowed him to kick Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen out of the Jade Palace?The reason was fairly simple. The Eighth Prince obtained the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d when he was only 10. Now, he had reached the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm and became a young warrior.\u201cAs long as I obtain the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019, I can cultivate the \u2018Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u2019. With the mysteries of the \u2018Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u2019, I can still catch up and become a warrior of Martial Arts, even if I have missed the best age of cultivation.\u201dScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean was the highest scripture that Emperor Ming had cultivated. Other than Emperor Ming, Zhang Ruochen was the only one who understood the entire technique of Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean.\u201cTomorrow is the Ceremony of Worship, I hope that I can receive the qualification of the gods and open the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen grasped his fists firmly and faithfully. He had a strong desire to open the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.After tidying up the room, Concubine Lin helped Zhang Ruochen to bed and softly said, \u201cChen-er, get some good rest. We need to attend the Ceremony of Worship tomorrow.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMom, I am sure I will open the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019 tomorrow! Trust me!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen confidently.\u201cOkay, Chen-er, I believe in you!\u201dConcubine Lin looked into Zhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes and gasped.In fact, she did not carry any hope of Zhang Ruochen opening the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. He was already 16, and it was almost impossible to open it up now.However, as a mother, she needed to encourage her child and gave him confidence.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was one of the thousands of commanderies in the Eastern Region of Kunlun\u2019s Field.Commanderies were known as counties in the First Central Empire. Each commandery needed to pay tribute and tax to the First Central Empire every year.The sovereign who ruled the commandery was called \u201cCommandery Prince\u201d.The status of Zhang Ruochen in this reborn life was as the ninth son of Yunwu Commandery Prince.As Zhang Ruochen laid on the ice-cold, hard wooden bed, he could not stop thinking about Ceremony of Worship to be held tomorrow.\u201cThe owner of this body hadn\u2019t yet acquired the Sacred Mark\u2019 by the age of 16, as if gods had abandoned him. What should I do to get a greater chance of obtaining the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019?\u201dIt was believed that if one wanted to acquire the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d and become a warrior in Kunlun\u2019s Field, approval of the gods would be needed at the Ceremony of Worship.This practice was known as passing on Martial Arts for posterity.During the Ceremony of Worship, there would be a bridge linking heaven and earth with the Field of Spirits in Kunlun\u2019s Field. It served as a means for the Spirits to enjoy the oblation prepared by the sincere citizens of Yunwu. Once the Spirits had finished, they decided which humans were talented enough to obtain the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. In this way, they helped the selected humans cultivate the essence of Martial Arts.Generally, the more talent that a human possessed, the earlier they could obtain \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.In Zhang Ruochen\u2019s previous life, he had obtained \u201cSacred Mark\u201d when he was still an unborn child in his mother\u2019s womb. He was a so-called born to be Genius of Martial Arts.Unfortunately, he had not yet had the chance to obtain \u201cSacred Mark\u201d by the age of 16 in this life. In terms of the age of cultivation, the older the person was, the less chance that they would obtain \u201cSacred Mark\u201d, so to speak. Basically, he was classified as being abandoned by gods. Even though he would attend the ceremony, he was unlikely to acquire \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.Zhang Ruochen could not sleep, the thought of how to obtain \u201cSacred Mark\u201d spun around his head. Instead, he sat up in bed and started playing with the white, nut-shaped spinel in his hand. It was sharp at both ends and transparent in the middle without any impurities.Zhang Ruochen was curious about the white spinel. He started studying it, as if it could help him get any one of gods\u2019 approval so he could obtain \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.The White Spinel had meant a lot to Zhang Ruochen in his previous life. It was his 16th birthday present given to him by Emperor Ming for celebrating his transition from childhood to adulthood.Even though Zhang Ruochen did not know what the White Spinel exactly was, he carried it with him all the time. He never expected that it would still be with him after 800 years.\u201cI have arisen from 800 years ago to 800 years in the future. Perhaps that has something to do with the White Spinel.\u201d\u00a0Zhang wondered.He closed his eyes and squeezed White Spinel firmly. The image of his father, Emperor Ming, gradually appeared in his mind. He speculated on whether or not his father was still alive after 800 years.The snow fell heavily this evening in Yunwu City.The next morning, the entirety of Yunwu City was covered by layers of snow. The buildings, a vermilion place, and the surrounding pavilion were also blanketed with frozen coats.With all the snow, the Winter Solstice was always the coldest day of the year.Every year on this day, all of the warriors of Yunwu City gathered together outside Imperial Ancestral Temple and worshipped gods, led by Commandery Prince.Outside Imperial Ancestral Temple, there was an ancient altar made of rocks. Thousands of cattle, sheep, and swine were attached to the altar, as well as the massive savage beasts which were locked up around a formidable iron chain.Countless people assembled together for the same reason\u2014the queen, concubines, princes, princesses, civil servants, and monks of Martial Arts together with an enormous number of teenagers, who were waiting to obtain \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. Even the infants awaited in their babysitters\u2019 arms.The entire city was obsessed with the grand ceremony. It was held in not only Yunwu City, but also in every city, every town, and every village of the Yunwu Commandery.\u201cHey, my ninth brother! You\u2019re already 16. Even though you\u2019re attending the ceremony, you will never acquire the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019. So why do you still bother to come here and embarrass yourself?\u201d asked Zhang Ji, the Eighth Prince, as he giggled at Zhang Ruochen.The Sixth Prince stood next to the Eighth Prince, who put on an arrogant attitude and said, \u201cPeople always say that the king gave birth to nine children and each of them is different in their own way. Our father is such a hero. I can\u2019t believe that he produced such a piece of crap! 16 years old and hasn\u2019t obtained the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019! You completely embarrass the entire Royal Family! What is the point of you staying alive? Why don\u2019t you go to hell?\u201dWhat the Sixth Prince said was quite out of line. Yet, it was exactly what the other princes thought.It fully demonstrated how mean and fragile the relationships were among the Royal Family.In Kunlun\u2019s Field, only one out of 10 people would be able to acquire the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. It could be said that the status of each warrior was exceptionally superior.For the superior Martial Arts warriors, it was certainly a different matter. The stronger Blood Meridians that the Martial Arts warriors had, the greater the chance to pass them on to their offspring. Hence, the likelihood of acquiring the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d would also increase.Among the sons that the Yunwu Commandery Prince had produced, eight of them had already acquired the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. Left behind was Zhang Ruochen, who was already 16 yet still struggling to acquire the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. He then became the joke of the Royal Family.Moreover, many people scorned him with an \u201coutstanding father, cowardly son\u201d status.There were even rumors in the palace saying that Zhang Ruochen was not the son of the Yunwu Commandery Prince. Being the only child who had not obtained the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d had no doubt annoyed the entire Royal Family.That was why all the other princes identified Zhang Ruochen as the shame of the Royal Family. They never treated him like a real brother and even wanted him to die.In recent years, the Yunwu Commandery Prince also started keeping a distance from Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen. After being exiled by other concubines and princes, they had been kicked out of the Jade Palace and were moved to the side hall last night.Zhang Ruochen stood there quietly and did not say a word. He did not care about what the Sixth Prince and the Eighth Prince had said.He believed that, before you acquired any actual strength, people would only look down on you with dismay.Looking at Zhang Ruochen being marginalized, Concubine Lin, who was standing with the other concubines, felt heartbroken. However, she could do nothing to help him.\u201cThe Ceremony of Worship will now begin!\u201dThe minister of the Yunwu Commandery stood at the highest part of the altar, holding a prayer roll and recited it aloud.Then, an elegant maidservant on the altar started playing 16 different types of musical instruments like bianqing, bianzhong, and bozhong.That was then followed by killing the animals that had been prepared on the altar and worshipping gods with blood.\u201cPfft\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the rich Spiritual Blood turned into a thick, strong light column that went all the way up to the vault of heaven. The light column shredded the clouds and crashed into the spacious sky.A star flew in quickly from the sky and reached a six-year-old boy\u2019s eyebrows. It blended in with the boy\u2019s body and turned into a red \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.Everyone in the crowd was so surprised and yelled. \u201cThe little boy is the youngest child of General Xue. He is only six years old and has been given the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018Blaze Sacred Mark\u2019 is classified as the Fourth Class of the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019. This is amazing! This little kid is going to have a bright future!\u201d The crowd continued to praise him.There were different classes of the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d, from the First Class to the Ninth Class.The First Class was the lowest and weakest level while the Ninth Class was the highest and most powerful.Everyone stared at the six-year-old kid with jealousy.This talented and luckiest kid, who had acquired the Fourth Class of the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d at the age of six, was definitely one of God\u2019s favored son. His achievements in the future would certainly be significant.Among all the warriors in the Yunwu Commandery, an excited, massive guy whooped while banging his chest. \u201cWonderful! This is my son, Xue Liang! Everyone, you are welcome to join the celebration party at my place tonight! Haha!\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dAs that sound was heard, the crowd looked up into the sky again. There were a few more stars that hit some more young boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 eyebrows. The stars turned into \u201cSacred Marks\u201d one by one.For all of the \u201cSacred Marks\u201d that had been obtained this year, most of them were the lowest class. Very, very few of the teenagers had acquired the Second-Class mark. The most outstanding candidate was still General Xue\u2019s child, who had gotten a Fourth-Class mark. He left the people far behind, who would need to catch up to him.The people who had acquired the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d were a minority. They were probably only one-tenth of the total population of Yunwu City. The lucky ones who obtained the marks were extremely overwhelmed. They were finally being granted the approval from the gods and given access to the way of making a significance in Martial Arts.On the other hand, those who did not obtain the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d were really upset and disappointed. Some of them were even choked with tears. It could be said that \u201claughter is heard and tears are shed in different households\u201d.The ceremony was moving toward the finish line. Zhang Ruochen had yet to acquire the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.At the age of 16 with no sign of the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d, it was now almost impossible for him to acquire it anymore. Living as a normal person would be the only future that he would have in his life.Everyone in the entire family neglected him as if he was just a speck of dust hiding around the corner and no one even noticed him.At the beginning of the ceremony, Concubine Lin held on to some hope. She hoped that a miracle would happen to her child, Zhang Ruochen, and he would obtain the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. She believed that he did not need to be an outstanding warrior, but he could keep himself healthier and stay away from all the illnesses.As the ceremony drew to an end, Concubine Lin\u2019s hope turned to disappointment and despair.Not only Concubine Lin, but also Zhang Ruochen thought that he could not obtain the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d. At that moment, the White Spinel that he gripped in his hands sparkled slightly.Right before the end of the ceremony, there was one more star that descended toward Zhang\u2019s eyebrows and it turned into a white circular \u201cSacred Mark\u201d.\u201cPfft!\u201dA fierce heat burning from his eyebrows spread throughout his entire body.\u201cIt\u2019s open! It\u2019s happening!\u201d Zhang Ruochen cheered.Zhang Ruochen was absolutely thrilled. He had finally acquired the \u201cSacred Mark\u201d!Indeed, he did not care if it turned out to be a First-Class mark. He would be more than satisfied to have finally obtained it.At one point throughout the ceremony, no one even noticed that Zhang Ruochen was there, but the moment that he obtained his valuable \u201cSacred Mark\u201d, he caught the attention of everyone.\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be the Ninth Prince, he is 16 with a feeble body. I can\u2019t believe his luck to acquire the mark at the final moment!\u201d Most of the people could not believe what they saw and started gossiping.The eyes of the Sixth Prince and the Eighth Prince widened in disbelief, revealing shocked faces as they stood next to Zhang Ruochen.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dConcubine Lin turned around and looked at Zhang Ruochen. She finally saw the mark on his eyebrows. She ran over to him and held him really, really tight. \u201cRuochen, you made it, you finally made it!\u201d Concubine Lin said through tears of joy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was an old eunuch who took care of the Yunwu Commandery Prince that walked towards Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cCongratulations Concubine Lin and my Ninth Prince for acquiring the \u2018Sacred Mark\u2019! The queen wants to invite the prince over to her place. She insists to review the class of your mark personally.\u201d\u201cThe queen!\u201dThe smile on Concubine Lin\u2019s face froze right away, as if she realized that something was wrong. She was so nervous and she pulled Zhang Ruochen behind her.\u201cMom, let\u2019s go to meet the queen!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen recognized the subtle change of Concubine Lin. He instantly knew that the queen was a tricky person. He needed to be more conscious and careful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In Zhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes, the queen was an aged woman and yet she looked like a 28- or 29-year-old lady with an elegant and exquisite character.\u201cHis Majesty has currently secluded himself for refining and, thus, I will be in charge of the ceremony this year. Minister, have you evaluated the class of the Sacred Mark that the Ninth Prince acquired yet?\u201d asked the queen.The minister of the Yunwu Commandery shook his head while he checked the metallic book in his hand. \u201c\u2018The Bible of Sacred Marks\u2019 records all the marks of Martial Artists in Kunlun\u2019s Field. From the First Class to the Ninth Class, all the marks have been documented in this metallic book. However, none of them matches with the Ninth Prince\u2019s.\u201dThe queen then glanced at Zhang Ruochen apathetically and said, \u201cIf there is no matching mark in the book, then I suggest that the mark you acquired carries a Zero Class on it. Indeed, it has happened to warriors from other commanderies in the past. Eventually, limited achievements have been made.\u201dThe Eighth Prince was also inside the tent. He interrupted and said, \u201cThe queen has made a good point! After all, our ninth brother is 16 now. He has missed the best age to cultivate Martial Arts. Even if he obtained a Fourth or Fifth Class Sacred Mark, I doubt he would get anywhere.\u201dThe queen nodded her head to acknowledge what the Eighth Prince had said. \u201cTo preserve refining resources as much as possible for other warriors in the Royal Family, only a bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid will be given to the Ninth Prince, since he only has a Zero-Class mark at 16 years old.\u201dConcubine Lin was shocked and her expression changed after hearing what the queen had said. \u201cMy Queen, it is a fact that the first year of acquiring the Sacred Mark is the most significant year in terms of cultivation. Remember the year that the Seventh Prince acquired the Sacred Mark? He was given 12 bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid in 12 months. Why does my Chen-er only receive one bottle of it?\u201d exclaimed Concubine Lin.\u201cThe Seventh Prince had already acquired a Seventh Class Sacred Mark when he was three. How dare you compare the Ninth Prince to such a genius?\u201d Queen grimly responded.The Eighth Prince, who wanted to ingratiate himself to the queen, said, \u201cOur seventh brother is the son of our queen, who is the first wife of the Commandery Prince. He has a Seventh Class Sacred mark which ensures powerful descendants for the queen. No one is comparable with my seventh brother in the entire Yunwu Commandery! Both the stability and prosperity of the Yunwu Commandery in the future depends on him.\u201d\u201cMoreover, it is impossible to compare the Seventh Prince and the Ninth Prince. The fingertip of my seventh brother is a thousand time more important than my ninth brother\u2019s life,\u201d he added.Concubine Lin bit her lip hard and continued to argue with the Eighth Prince. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that when you obtained your Sacred Mark, you received four bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid. Why can Ruochen only have one? This is so unfair!\u201d shouted Concubine Lin. As a mother, she was trying her best to protect Zhang Ruochen and fought for what he deserved to receive. After all, the more Marrow-washing Liquid Zhang Ruochen had, the better he could cultivate Martial Arts.\u201cThe more talent a person has, the more resources they receive to cultivate their skills. Apparently, the talent of the Ninth Prince is not as significant as that of the Seventh Prince or the Eighth Prince. Compared to his outstanding brothers, surely he should get fewer resources.\u201d Queen angrily responded to Concubine Lin.\u201cBut wait\u2026\u201d Squeaked Concubine Lin, who had led the argument with the queen.However, she had truly annoyed the queen before she asked for anything. \u201cI have already made my decision, Concubine Lin. Don\u2019t you dare challenge me again! Otherwise, I will have you beaten with a rod again!\u201d said Queen in a low voice.\u201cAgain\u2026?\u201d Zhang Ruochen raised his head hearing what Queen said.He wondered if the queen had once beaten his mother with a rod.Concubine Lin shut her mouth at once when she heard what the queen had said. Concubine Lin\u2019s body shook slightly as if she was recalling some frightening memory from the past. Something that had to do with the queen and the rod.While Zhang Ruochen was trying to figure out the story behind the two women and a rod, a bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid was handed to him.After taking the Marrow-washing Liquid, Zhang Ruochen walked toward his mother who stood next to the queen said, \u201cMom, let\u2019s go home!\u201d Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head was still spinning about with what he had heard about the rod. He did not want to spend one more minute in the Queen\u2019s Palace. He even took a quick glance at the queen with hatred as he left.\u201cAlright!\u201d Concubine Lin pursed her lips and bitterly nodded her head. It seemed like Concubine Lin was bothered by something that the queen had said.It seemed that the queen had also noticed the tension between Zhang Ruochen and herself. She stared at Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen as they walked away and muttered, \u201cNinth Prince, you had better practice as hard as you can in preparation for the Year-end Assessment among the Royal Family three months from now. You have to do your very best to reach the \u2018Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels\u2019 stage within these three months so you can become an outstanding warrior. By that time, His Majesty will have finished his self-refining and will attend the assessment. If you can attain that result in such a short period of time, he will be overwhelmed.\u201d\u201cEven if you gave him three bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid, it is impossible to reach the Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels stage in three months\u2019 time. Not to brag, but even with my talents, I still spent six months to cultivate that skill. Since my ninth brother obtained a Zero-Class mark from the gods, I guess he will probably need more than a year to acquire the technique. Haha!\u201d The Eighth Prince claimed contemptuously as if he viewed Zhang Ruochen as a fool rather than a brother.Zhang Ruochen heard everything that the Eighth Prince mentioned about his lack of talent. He did not look back and try to start an argument. Rather, he grasped his fists firmly and thought to himself, \u201cI will never let all of you down! You will see a completely different Zhang Ruochen in three months! I will obtain the Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels technique!\u201d Zhang had never felt so determined. Their anger and the teasing motivated him to succeed.Zhang Ruochen could not wait to start practicing. As soon as he got back to Ziyi Side Hall, he instantly went back to his room and started traveling down the path to success.In fact, he did not understand what obtaining the Sacred Mark meant. Yet, he believed having the Sacred Mark would definitely help him learn how to practice Genuine Qi.The first step was to open up the \u201cQi pool\u201d underneath the Sacred Mark on his eyebrows.The so-called \u201cQi Pool\u201d referred to a pool that stored Genuine Qi power.The larger the pool, the more storage for this power. The \u201cQi Pool\u201d would also expand with cultivation and study.Generally speaking, if Zhang Ruochen wanted to develop a \u201cQi Pool\u201d, he needed to cultivate it under the guidance of an experienced and elder practitioner.In regards to Zhang Ruochen, who was an exceptionally talented Martial Arts warrior in his previous life, establishing the \u201cQi Pool\u201d was a fundamental step as well as the easiest task out of all of the steps of cultivation. In only half an hour, he had already built a \u201cQi Pool\u201d.Yet, for other monks, it took them at least several days to figure out how to build a \u201cQi Pool\u201d.Zhang Ruochen, the genius, only needed half an hour.However, he did not seem satisfied with the performance of this feeble body. \u201cAlthough I only spent 30 minutes to establish the \u2018Qi Pool\u2019, the size of the pool is comparable to an egg. It is definitely too small to store Genuine Qi!\u201d He moaned.He clearly understood that it was too small for a proper \u201cQi Pool\u201d.The \u201cQi Pool\u201d was a storage for Genuine Qi.Zhang Ruochen had to establish his own practice of Meridians in order to allow the Genuine Qi to flow through his body.In order to become an actual warrior with the cultivation of Genuine Qi, the first step was to establish the practice of Meridians.After that was step two, Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels.Zhang Ruochen took out the little jade bottle of the Marrow-washing Liquid. He sniffed the liquid to make sure it was real and then poured the entire bottle of liquid into his mouth.The taste of the Marrow-washing Liquid was relatively cool inside his throat. It only lasted for a couple of seconds, followed by a burning sensation.It felt as if there was a fire burning inside his body.With a trace of flames, Zhang Ruochen could feel the Meridians merging with his body.\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201d Zhang Ruochen screamed.\u201cThe first level of the \u2018Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u2019.\u201dFor Martial Artists, practicing different exercises would open up different Meridians.The more advanced the exercises were, the more complicated the Meridians would be. Basically, there would be even more surprises when the exercises became more intricate.There were a total of 36 Meridians in the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d.Certainly, Zhang Ruochen did not need to build all of the Meridians for the time being. What he needed to do was to build one path out of the 36 so he could reach the Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels stage.As an extraordinary warrior, Zhang Ruochen would not be satisfied with building just one path out of the 36. \u201cThe queen and the Eighth Prince all claim that I will need more than three months to reach the Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels stage. Yet, I will prove it to everyone that I am going to complete it tonight and become a real warrior!\u201d he firmly said.With the experience of cultivating Martial Arts in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s previous life, a strand of Genuine Qi fully broke out of the vessels. Very quickly, half of the first Meridian had been created.However, there was drastic pain coming from his body. It felt like his Meridian was nearly being torn out. He was scared and he shivered. And, as this was just the weak body of Zhang Ruochen, anything could happen to this feeble body.If it were to happen to ordinary people, they would not be able to endure it.Yet, the powerful determination of Zhang Ruochen helped him overcome the pain. Even though he was sweating profusely, he never gave up.\u201cJust\u2026 a little\u2026 more\u2026\u201d He mumbled.Zhang Ruochen was very close to the building the first Meridian. He had to break through!He had to accomplish it. He had to successfully reach that stage!That was the spirit of a warrior. Zhang Ruochen flung himself toward his goal, almost crushing all of the Genuine Qi as he moved it toward his Meridian.\u201cBoom!\u201dA massive noise descended from Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body, loud enough to make a person deaf. The shock of the noise almost made him faint.Eventually, the pain went away. Zhang Ruochen could only feel cool blood circulating around the Meridians. He had never felt anything more refreshing than this.\u201cHaha! I made it! I\u2019m a real warrior now after attaining the Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels stage!\u201d He screamed.To reach this stage, the Eighth Prince had needed four bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid and spent half a year to achieve it.Zhang Ruochen only spent a single night and only needed one bottle of the liquid.The Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels stage had been accomplished, which meant the cultivation of the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm.The Martial Arts Practices were divided into yellow, black, earth, and heaven, corresponding to the Yellow Realm, the Black Realm, the Earth Realm and finally the Heaven Realm.In each realm, there were seven more states: the Initial Stage, the Mid Stage, the Advanced Stage, Dawn State, the Medium State, the Final State, and last but not least, the Completion.Four major realms and seven minor states.The cultivation that Zhang Ruochen had completed within a night was the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm.After building the Meridians and drilling the Genuine Qi in the Initial Stage, the Mid Stage, and the Advanced Stage of the Yellow realm, the power in the body would become stronger. Every time that one would elevate to the next realm, their power would greatly increase.The Eighth Prince had a cultivation in the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. That explained why he could lift a 300 pound stone 10 feet in the air with a single hand. His fist was probably as strong as a bull.Most warriors in the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm were able to cultivate a technique called the \u201cStrength of A Bull\u201d.Above the Advanced Stage, there were four realms, which included the Dawn State, the Medium State, the Final State, and the Completion.After breaking through to the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm, a person then reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, which meant acquiring the technique \u201cStrength of Four Bulls\u201d, which was four times more powerful than the previous state.Therefore, warriors of the Dawn State and the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm were like adults playing with children. Even if one of them fought against 10 people, the warrior in the Dawn State could easily handle them.The other three minor states, the Medium State, the Final State, and the Completion, were even more terrifying. The warriors who belonged to these three states were very likely to have obtained power that no one could imagine.The above realms sounded really far away to Zhang Ruochen. But, fighting firmly and steadily, he knew that this was a crucial part of this life. He believed that \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together step by step\u201d. If Zhang Ruochen wanted to be a warrior, he would need to cultivate each stage gradually, step by step.The Eighth Prince had been practicing Martial Arts for eight years and the furthest stage that he had reached was just the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. He was just an ordinary person.\u201cThe Eighth Prince spent six months to accomplish the Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels stage while I only spent a single night.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen was very proud of himself with the progress that he had made so far.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Eighth Prince spent eight years practicing the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. I have to reach my goal in three months! It\u2019s possible for me to accomplish this. With my previous experience, I can see a way.\u201d\u00a0He thought, setting a target for himself over the next three months.The Year-end Assessment of the Royal Family would be held in three months\u2019 time. In order to examine the results of cultivation over the past year, every single one of the warriors in the Royal Family, including all the princes, princesses, and relatives, had to attend.Zhang Ruochen understood that the only way to be respected, receive more resources for cultivation, and to acquire a certain status in the Royal Family was no doubt by proving to everyone in the family that he was capable of being a warrior. He was determined to show them that he was no longer the coward that people used to tease.Three months!Over the next three months, Zhang Ruochen was determined to practice the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. Deep in his heart, he promised himself that he would never give up until he had redeemed his mother\u2019s dignity. A mother who had taken care of him since he was born, a mother who had suffered so much pain\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was almost as big as a basketball.However, the Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool was still not sufficient, as it was less than one-tenth its total capacity. It was as small as an egg.Zhang Ruochen could not practice the next level, the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm, until the Qi Pool was completely filled with Genuine Qi.He sat cross-legged and closed his eyes. The Sacred Mark between his eyebrows opened and he began to practice \u201cOverlord Yellow Realm\u201d, the first level of the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d.Overflowing from the Qi Pool, the Genuine Qi circulated through his body along the Meridian that had broken out.With the Genuine Qi circulating, he felt as if his body had melted into a vortex and was slowly absorbing the Spiritual Qi between heaven and earth.It flowed into the Sacred Mark between his eyebrows.The Sacred Mark transformed the Spiritual Qi between heaven and earth into Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool. Then the Genuine Qi overflowed from the Qi Pool and circulated in his body along the Meridian.A single circle of Genuine Qi in the body was a complete circulation.Nine circulations passed. When Zhang Ruochen opened his eyes again, he was surprised to find that his Genuine Qi had doubled. It was now at one-tenth of the total capacity.If other warriors had known that their Genuine Qi could double like this in such a short time, they would have gone into rapture.But Zhang Ruochen was unsatisfied. It had taken nine circulations to double his Genuine Qi. It was too slow! If he could obtain a Spiritual Crystal, his practice would accelerate and double.The exercises that Zhang Ruochen was practicing were from the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d. His absorption rate was already faster than warriors with inferior practices.And yet, he was still not satisfied with his current progress.If he could obtain one Spiritual Crystal, he would speed up his cultivation dramatically.A Spiritual Crystal was a spinel formed by Spiritual Qi.It could be a Natural Spiritual Crystal found in a lode under the earth or an Acquired Spiritual Crystal hidden within the body of a savage beast.One Spiritual Crystal was worth 1,000 silver coins or so. Only princes, nobles, and masters from large families had the opportunity to obtain Spiritual Crystals.1,000 silver coins were a gigantic expense, and Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin simply could not afford it.\u201cA Spiritual Crystal!\u201dHis heart shook intensely, and immediately the pit-shaped, White Spinel he had been wearing fell off. He held it in his palm.\u201cCould this be a Spiritual Crystal?\u201dWith Genuine Qi circulating in his body, the Sacred Mark between his glabella instantly appeared and changed into a circular halo.A streak of white Genuine Qi shot out from the mark into the White Spinel.\u201cCrash!\u201dFour ancient characters emerged on the surface of the White Spinel.It was weird.Never had Zhang Ruochen seen such writing before. However, he managed to read the four characters quickly\u2014\u201dTime and Space Spinel\u201d.Zhang Ruochen had injected Genuine Qi into the White Spinel in his last lifetime. However, he had failed to produce the characters.In his last lifetime, though his cultivation had been hundreds of times more powerful, he had never inspired the appearance of characters on the White Spinel. In this lifetime, to his surprise, he managed to change the White Spinel in the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm. This proved that it was the nature of Genuine Qi, rather than its intensity, that mattered.For instance, a warrior with a Flame Sacred Mark could better utilize a Spiritual Crystal that had fire nature. This could help to triple his practicing rate, while a common Spiritual Crystal would only double his practicing rate.In nature, 90 percent of Spiritual Crystals did not have an individual essence. Just like 90 percent of warriors could only unlock the Sacred Mark without nature.\u201cDoes that mean that my Sacred Mark had some kind of nature that corresponds with this Time and Space Spinel? But wait\u2026 What is the Time and Space Spinel?\u201dAs the son of Emperor Ming in his last lifetime, Zhang Ruochen was well-informed and knew about many Spiritual Crystals with different natures, such as the Flame Spiritual Crystal, the Ice of Profound Spiritual Crystal, the Thunderbolt Crystal, the Blood Spirit Spiritual Crystal, etc. But he had never heard of a Spiritual Crystal with a time-space nature.Time and space could not be controlled by humans at all, nor could a god dominate their development. Thus, all life should obey the rules of time and space.While Zhang Ruochen contemplated, a ring of light appeared on the surface of the Time and Space Spinel, melting into a vortex.The vortex kept growing larger and larger, eventually enveloping Zhang Ruochen completely.Zhang Ruochen felt very dizzy as the sky and earth began to reel around him. The next second he found himself in a closed space, slamming onto the hard ground.Luckily, he had already accomplished the processes of Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels. He had attained the level of the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm, which had greatly strengthened his physique. If it had been his former fragile body, this heavy fall could have caused death.Zhang Ruochen got up from the ground, stretched his aching muscles and bones, and began to observe the surrounding space.This space was completely enclosed without any doors or windows, and it was 10 meters high, 10 meters long, and 10 meters wide.\u201cWhat happened? How did I get here? Where is this? There\u2019s a stone platform.\u201dThere was only one single stone platform inside the space.On the stone platform, there was nothing but only a rolled-up painting and a silver iron book.Zhang Ruochen reached out for the painting first and discovered that it was unexpectedly heavy as if it was joined to the stone. The scroll painting remained motionless, no matter how hard Zhang Ruochen tried to move it.Since the scroll painting could not be picked up or opened, Zhang Ruochen could only give up temporarily. So he turned to the thin, silver iron book instead.\u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space!\u201d was printed on the book.But this time, Zhang Ruochen was prepared for it. With Genuine Qi circulating in his body, he mobilized all his strength and opened the first page.\u201cSo\u2026 easy?\u201dHe effortlessly managed to flick through \u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space\u201d.Zhang Ruochen shook his head solemnly and stopped using the Genuine Qi. He picked up \u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space\u201d and held it in his hands, reading carefully.The first page of \u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space\u201d did not document any practicing Mysterium but included the transcripts of Saint Monk Xumi, the last possessor of the Time and Space Spinel.After reading the transcripts of Saint Monk Xumi, Zhang Ruochen had figured everything out.It turned out that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s mark was the Sacred Mark of Time and Space. According to what Saint Monk Xumi said, no one out of hundreds of millions of people could unlock it. Since ancient times, there had been only two people that had gotten it. And now he was the third one.Saint Monk Xumi was the second to unlock the Time and Space Sacred Mark. But based on the recorded time in \u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space\u201d, he died more than a hundred thousand years ago. It was in the Medieval Ancient Times, which was so long ago.The space that Zhang Ruochen was located in was the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.The speed that time passed in internal space was totally different from the outside world. Practicing in internal space for three days was equivalent to one day outside.Zhang Ruochen was overjoyed. He exclaimed excitedly. \u201cPracticing in internal space for three days is equal to one day outside. That means that my practice time will be three times longer than others\u2019! It\u2019s perfect.\u201dZhang Ruochen wanted to turn to page two. However, no matter what he did, he was unable to open it.\u201cI have failed again!\u201dZhang Ruochen had an impulse to throw the \u201cMystery of Time and Space\u201d to the ground. Suddenly, he found a line of small print in the last row of the first page:\u201cOnly when you attain the level of the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm and inject Genuine Qi into the scroll painting can you open it.\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at the painting again and surmised.\u00a0\u201cSome mysterious exercises must be recorded in it. Perhaps it relates to the time and space of practicing.\u201d\u201cI will practice hard and try to break through to the Dawn State as soon as possible. I would like to see what secrets this painting contains.\u201dThe Dawn State was the fourth small realm. Its upper levels were the Medium State, the Final State, and the Completion.Zhang Ruochen was feeling a little hungry. He left the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and returned back to his room.He grasped the Time and Space Spinel in his hands. With this spinel, he had more confidence that he could reach the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm in three months.Zhang Ruochen, Concubine Lin, and maid Yun were sitting together for breakfast.They only had rice and steamed buns without any meat.Warriors consumed more strength than ordinary people, thus, their daily diet was of vital importance.The princes and princesses who had already unlocked their Sacred Marks had stopped eating a normal diet long ago and chose to eat Blood Pills, which were refined from the blood of savage beasts.One Blood Pill could replenish the physical exertion of an entire day. Even if one practiced fist techniques and sword techniques for a whole day, you would not feel hungry.Besides, Blood Pills also had benefits in improving Spiritual Blood, building up the body for Martial Arts and enhancing strength.If this continued, even if Zhang Ruochen ate eight meals a day, with only rice and steamed buns, it would not be enough to supply the lost energy.\u201cChen-er, since you have unlocked the Sacred Mark, you shouldn\u2019t eat normal food anymore. Take these 10 Blood Pills. I\u2019ll find other solutions if you need more.\u201d Concubine Lin took out a jade vase and gave it to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen never thought Concubine Lin would have 10 Blood Pills. He asked curiously, \u201cMom, one Blood Pill costs five silver coins. 10 Blood Pills cost 50 silver coins. How did you get so much money?\u201dConcubine Lin smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s always a way to make it!\u201dMaid Yun stood behind Concubine Lin and said, \u201cOur empress exchanged her favorite gold hairpin for 10 Blood Pills in the Pill Market!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euConcubine Lin gave Yun a slight glance as if to blame her big mouth. Then she added, \u201cChen-er, it doesn\u2019t matter. As long as you can be a real warrior, I will always support you. Even if I have to sell all my jewels.\u201dZhang Ruochen was very impressed, gripping the jade vase. He bit his lip and wanted to tell Concubine Lin that he was already a real warrior.No, he could not tell her.It had taken only one day for him to open up the Qi Pool and finish the process of Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels. It was too fast. If this news leaked out, other princes and queens would definitely find ways to frame them.He was still relatively weak and needed to be more powerful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will practice and become strong as soon as possible. I will protect you with my power.\u201dTaking the Blood Pills, Zhang Ruochen returned to his room and kept practicing.\u201cYour Majesty, it is said that a warrior not only needs Blood Pills but also has to practice skills. Only by practicing can the prince open up his Meridians,\u201d said maid Yun.Concubine Lin watched Zhang Ruochen leave, puckered her lips, and nodded. \u201cI know! But even the exercise of the lowest level will cost over 500 silver coins. There is no way I can afford that. What\u2019s more, the queen and the Minister are in charge right now, who will never allow Chen-er to enter the library to practice skills. There is only one way left!\u201dMaid Yun asked, \u201cAre you going to turn to the Lins? You fell out with them three years ago! They won\u2019t offer the chance to our prince!\u201d\u201cAs long as they help Chen-er, I will go down on my knees and beg for forgiveness.\u201d It seemed to remind Concubine Lin of something, and she could not help crying.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Maid Yun let out a sigh.\u2026The Spiritual Qi in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel was very sufficient\u2014it was almost twice as strong as that outside.In the Yunwu Commandery, if the concentration of Spiritual Qi in one place increased by 150%, it would be seen as a treasured place and all the families would vie for it.Sitting in the center of the internal space, Zhang Ruochen took out the jade bottle. He took out a Blood Pill and smelled it.Blood Pills were made from the blood of savage beasts, but they did not smell of blood. On the contrary, they had a delicate fragrance.When the alchemists were making them, they got rid of the smell of blood and also added Tiger Grass and stramonium.Long-term usage of Blood Pills would provide a warrior with unlimited physical strength, and improve the warrior\u2019s Meridians, bones, and organs, thus making the body stronger.\u201cThis is only a First-Class Blood Pill.\u201d Zhang Ruochen nodded slightly and said to himself, \u201ca First-Class Blood Pill is sufficient for my current cultivation.\u201dZhang Ruochen put the Blood Pill into his mouth. Then he covered the bottle and put it on the stone table.Under the effect of the Genuine Qi, the Spiritual Blood of the Blood Pill quickly melted and provided unlimited physical strength.\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve reached the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm and become a warrior, my body is far too weak and it does not compare to others\u2019. I must strengthen my body, or else I\u2019ll suffer losses when I fight with warriors in the same realm.\u201dFor a warrior, practicing only Genuine Qi was not enough. He also needed to practice martial techniques.\u201cDragon and Elephant Prajna Palm!\u201dThis mysterious and profound palm technique emerged in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s mind. It could be counted among the top three in the Mysterium of Martial Techniques in his memories and was very suitable for him to practice right now.He widened his stance, sank his waist low, and let the Genuine Qi fill his legs. Then, he fixed his body, slowly raised his arms, and started to clap his hands in a mysterious rhythm.In his mind, he imagined himself as an ancient elephant with unlimited power and a magical dragon from an abyss blowing clouds. He put all his power into every single punch, as if releasing all the power in his body.Every muscle was exercised with his punches. The Genuine Qi went into and was integrated with his muscles and bones, making them tough and tensile.The Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was a martial technique of the Inferior Class of the King\u2019s Stage that included a total of 13 movements.Precisely speaking, the 13th movement was equal to the martial technique at the God Stage.The exercises and martial technique were both divided into five stages: Human, Spirit, Ghost, King, and God.The first movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Galloping Elephant, was as powerful as the martial techniques of the Inferior Class of the Human Stage.The second movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Dragon in the Sky, was as powerful as the martial techniques of the Medium Class of the Human Stage.The third movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Naga returning to Earth, was as powerful as the martial techniques of the Superior Class of the Human Stage.The fourth movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Dragon Shape and Elephant Shadow, was as powerful as the martial techniques of the Inferior Class of a Spiritual Stage.\u2026The 13th movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Dragon and Elephant Destroy the World, was as powerful as the martial techniques of the God Stage, which was an unimaginable power.The earlier movements of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm could be seen as inferior martial techniques, not really that powerful. Furthermore, the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was extremely virile and hard. Thus, there were very few people who practiced it, even to the seventh movement.After the seventh movement, each additional movement used up a great deal of time and energy. If one could not resist the virile power in his body, it was very likely that he would burn to death.All of these reasons made the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm a martial technique of the Inferior Class of the King\u2019s stage.Although the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was difficult, it was very suitable for Zhang Ruochen to strengthen his body in a short time.\u201cThe first movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Galloping Elephant.\u201dZhang Ruochen squatted first, and then quickly stepped out and punched.He was as still as a mountain and moved like a brute elephant.He practiced again and again until all the Genuine Qi in his body was used up. Then, he wiped off his sweat and fell to the ground. He used the Sacred Mark in his glabella to absorb the power in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and turned it into Genuine Qi.He practiced for nine days in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel, and finally succeeded in the first movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Galloping Elephant.Outside, only three days had passed, while nine days had passed in the internal space.\u201cI wonder how powerful the first movement will be if I use it with my present cultivation.\u201dZhang Ruochen stepped out from the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and went to the backyard. He stood in the center of the yard and dispersed his Genuine Qi to his legs.\u201cGalloping Elephant.\u201dHis feet moved in a synchronized pattern and suddenly dashed out.With each step, a flow of strong power charged out from his legs, then to his waist, back, shoulders, and finally, burst out from his arms.Although it was only one movement, it motivated the power of every muscle. That was the reason why it was so powerful.\u201cBang!\u201dHis palms punched a huge stone, which was about half of a man\u2019s height. He quickly pulled his palms back, repeated his footsteps, and returned to his original position.Zhang Ruochen looked at that huge stone. He saw two shallow palm prints on the surface, and the stone sank into the earth about two centimeters.Zhang Ruochen was quite satisfied with the power.Although the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was only in the Inferior Class of the Human Stage, it was much more brilliant than the others and its power was also much stronger.\u201cThe higher the classes and stages are, the harder they will be to practice. If I practice the Spiritual Stage\u2019s martial techniques directly, I can\u2019t succeed in only nine days. It may take me at least half a year. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s impossible for me to put the martial techniques at the Spiritual Stage to use due to my insufficient Genuine Qi.\u201dThe time of practicing martial techniques and other skills had to be arranged properly.If one focused on practicing martial techniques and ignored the skills, their cultivation would grow very slowly.But if one focused on practicing skills and ignored the martial techniques, he would suffer great losses during a fight.By succeeding in the first movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Zhang Ruochen finally had the basic ability to protect himself in this era.During these nine days, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation also greatly improved. The Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool was full, and he was ready to develop his second Meridian.To develop Meridians, Marrow-washing Liquid was indispensable. But the queen had only given Zhang Ruochen one share of the Marrow-washing Liquid, which he had already used up when he developed his first Meridian.How could he get a second, or even many, Marrow-washing Liquid?\u201cNinth Prince, Concubine Lin has been looking for you everywhere. What are you doing here?\u201d Maid Yun saw Zhang Ruochen standing in the center of the yard. She was walking toward him with curiosity.As the only maid for both Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen, Yun was a pretty girl of about 17, with bright eyes and a pointy jaw.Zhang Ruochen walked up in front of her, blocking her from seeing the two palm prints on the stone, and asked with concern, \u201cSister Yun, is your wound getting better?\u201dYun shook her head. \u201cIt probably still needs another two to three months.\u201dShe had broken her arm when the Eighth Prince pushed her down, several days before. Hurting a maid such as her, or even killing her, meant nothing to the Eighth Prince, who certainly did not need to take any responsibility.In a world where the strong lead, the weak could only bleed.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you buy some Muscles and Bones Regenerating Ointment?\u201dYun smiled bitterly and said, \u201cEven the ointment with the lowest quality will cost 200 silver coins. A maid like me has no way to afford that. Ninth Prince, it is very kind of you to think of me. Now, please follow me to meet Concubine Lin. We are going outside the palace today.\u201dZhang Ruochen followed Yun and curiously asked, \u201cGoing outside? Where to?\u201d\u201cTo see Ningshan! You must be very happy, for you haven\u2019t seen her for a long time.\u201d Yun smiled brightly and stared at Zhang Ruochen.Every time the name Ningshan was mentioned, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s face would flush and he would look shy like a girl.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho is Ningshan?\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen was just about to ask when he suddenly realized he should not do so.Apparently, Zhang Ruochen surely knew the girl when he was alive and, due to Yun\u2019s attitude, they surely also had a special relationship.If Zhang Ruochen asked about who she was, he would have revealed himself. Therefore, he decided to keep silent.Fortunately, Zhang Ruochen had been ill all these years. So he hardly made contact with others, except for Concubine Lin. Otherwise, he might have already been suspected.Seeing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s calm attitude, Yun felt a little surprised. But she did not pay special attention to it and continued to walk to Concubine Lin\u2019s place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0TransnZhang Ruochen, Concubine Lin, and maid Yun were seated in a roan antelope ancient carriage, slowly moving away from the Yunwu Palace.Different from a real horse, an antelope-horse was a savage beast with a horn on its head. It was like a small elephant at just over three meters tall and it could move five times faster than a normal warhorse. Some strong antelope-horses could run as much as 3,000 miles per day.Without knowing how far the roan antelope ancient carriage had gone, it slowed down and finally stopped.After getting down from the carriage, Zhang Ruochen glanced at the two resplendent gates nearby and the horizontal inscribed board hanging above the gates, on which was written two powerful Chinese characters in gilded calligraphy: \u201cThe Lin\u2019s Mansion!\u201dHe was surprised because the surname of his mother was also \u201cLin\u201d!Looking around the magnificent mansion, it appeared that the Lin family was not humble, but eminent.\u201cIf my mother is from an eminent family, why can\u2019t she get support from her family to save herself from other concubines\u2019 continuous bullying in the Commandery Prince\u2019s Mansion?\u201dThere had to be a story behind it.Concubine Lin also got down from the carriage. Looking up at the gate, which was both familiar and strange to her, she said, \u201cChen-er, I bet you cannot wait to see Ningshan! Now, you have also developed the Sacred Mark and I believe that you and Ningshan may have many things in common. Take advantage of this opportunity!\u201d . .Zhang Ruochen had no idea who Lin Ningshan was. He felt that Yun\u2019s and Concubine Lin\u2019s words were strange.Led by Concubine Lin, Zhang Ruochen and Yun walked into the Lin\u2019s Mansion.Theoretically, a concubine should receive a grand reception upon returning home. However, there was only one elderly butler who came to welcome Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen.Concubine Lin was guided into the inner house by the elderly butler, leaving Zhang Ruochen and Yun in the outer house. Only two maids were left to care for them.Zhang Ruochen could sense that something was off, but he had difficulty finding someone to ask. Thus, he had no choice but to remain silent.\u201cNinth Prince, why don\u2019t you go see Ningshan? She must be in the Drill Coliseum, where all the young people of the Lin Family are practicing,\u201d Yun said\u2026Zhang Ruochen was more and more curious about this girl \u201cNingshan\u201d, who both Concubine Lin and Yun had mentioned several times.\u00a0\u201cI might as well see her.\u201d\u00a0he thought.\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s go to the Drill Coliseum,\u201d Zhang nodded and said\u2026\u2026It was in the inner house of the Lin Family.In the quaint hall, Lin Fengxian, the leader of the Lin Family, was sitting upright in Taishi chairs.He was about 30 years old with a mustache. He took a glance at Concubine Lin, who was sitting opposite to him, and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince is part of the future generation of the Commandery Prince\u2019s Mansion. Even if he has unlocked the Sacred Mark, he should have gone to the Book Collection Pavillion in the Commandery Prince\u2019s Mansion to gather books about practice skills. Concubine Lin, why are you asking for them here?\u201dConcubine Lin bit her lip and said, \u201cI am not asking, but begging, my eldest brother. Could you please give Chen-er a book about practicing skills, even if it is only due to the fact that he is your nephew.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dLin Fengxian growled with disdain as he thumped the table, saying, \u201cNow you need me? How dare you come to discuss kinship with me! Three years ago, I went to the Commandery Prince\u2019s Mansion to plead with you. Why did not you save your nephew, Chenyu? You knew that Chenyu was my legitimate son and also the once-in-a-century genius of the Lin Family. He would have been saved as long as you had begged the Commandery Prince. However, you did not\u2026\u201d\u201cThree years ago, I\u2026\u201d Concubine Lin was extremely grieved and could hardly hold back her tears. She wanted to tell him the truth.However, Lin Fengxian interrupted her and said, \u201cJust go! The family has already cut ties with you long ago. Never come back, Concubine Lin.\u201d\u201cDong!\u201dConcubine Lin kneeled down on the ground, weeping and choking with tears, and said, \u201cMy brother, how can you be so ruthless? I want to see dad.\u201d\u201cFather has gone to Omen Ridge. He will be there for three months. You can\u2019t see him right now,\u201d Lin Fengxian said in an apathetic voice. \u201cOne more thing. The Seventh Prince and Ningshan will be engaged soon. Please tell the Ninth Prince to stay away from Ningshan from now on.\u201dConcubine Lin was desperate and said, \u201cYou know that Chen-er has been so fond of Ningshan. If he knew about their engagement, how sad would he be? Besides, why the Seventh Prince?\u201dLin Fengxian said, \u201cThe Seventh Prince opened a Seventh Class Sacred Mark when he was only three years old. Doesn\u2019t that mean that he is a genius? Based on his current martial cultivation, no one in his entire generation in the Yunwu Commandery can catch up to him. The Lin family will benefit in the future if Ningshan can marry the Seventh Prince. Although the Ninth Prince and Ningshan are cousins who used to be childhood sweethearts in the past, the Ninth Prince is only mediocre. He didn\u2019t obtain the Sacred Mark until he was 16. That means that he will never make any great achievements in his life, and the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm may be the utmost that he can practice. He cannot compare with the Seventh Prince.\u201d\u2026Concubine Lin said, \u201cIs Ningshan willing to be engaged to the Seventh Prince? Will she be happy to marry for the benefit of the family?\u201d Lin Fengxian stared at Concubine Lin and indifferently said, \u201cYou are wrong! It is Ningshan herself who made the decision!\u201d\u2026The Drill Coliseum of the Lin Family was very spacious, about half the size of a football field.Young people in cyan colored Martial Arts robes from the Lin family were practicing martial techniques in the Drill Coliseum. Some of them were practicing fist techniques, other sword techniques, and the rest, broadsword techniques.They were the elites of the Lin family and everyone had opened the Sacred Mark. All of them were dedicated to practicing under the guidance of a senior member in what appeared to be a flourishing atmosphere.Zhang nodded his head and said to himself.\u00a0\u201cThe Lin family can be thought of as a noble family in the Yunwu Commandery.\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Ruochen noticed a young lady who was slim and stunning.The young lady seemed to be only 14 or 15 years old, but she had a petite body, eyebrows like willow leaves, starry eyes, and fair skin. What a pretty young lady!She was holding a sword that was covered by weak starlight and giving off a cyan colored glow. A vast amount of Sword Breath surrounded her and followed her as she walked, which was as graceful as a flying swan and as beautiful as a flying dragon. The subtlety of sword technique had reached its climax.\u201cThe rarefied power has been released. It\u2019s the realm of Sword Following the Heart. Her Martial Arts skills have reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, at the very least, which is much better than the Eighth Prince.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen thought.\u201cWow! Is that the Ninth Prince? Who would have thought that he would come to Lin\u2019s Mansion?\u201d One of Lin\u2019s young followers saw Zhang Ruochen standing outside the Drill Coliseum and sneered with an ironic smile.\u201cHe must have come here to see sister Ningshan. What a pity! She doesn\u2019t want to see him at all.\u201d\u201cI heard that he has opened the Sacred Mark.\u201d\u201cAha! He didn\u2019t open his Sacred Mark until 16. How can he make any achievements? If he wasn\u2019t Ningshan\u2019s cousin, he might not even have a chance to enter the Lin\u2019s Mansion.\u201d\u201cI heard that Ningshan will be engaged to the Seventh Prince very soon. What a perfect match!\u201d\u201cHey! It was said that the Ninth Prince always had a crush on her. What do you guess his facial expression will be when he learns of their engagement?\u201dAll the young warriors of the Lin family stopped practicing and stared at Zhang Ruochen standing outside the Drill Coliseum. They pointed at him, whispered among themselves, and mocked him.Lin Ningshan also stopped practicing and glanced at Zhang Ruochen, waving her arms to precisely sheathe the Splendor Sword five meters away.Lin Ningshan walked over to Zhang Ruochen, looked at his thin body, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for a long time, cousin. I heard that you have opened the Sacred Mark, right?\u201dWhen they were young, Lin Ningshan and Zhang Ruochen were childhood sweethearts. But later, Lin Ningshan unlocked her Sacred Mark and started to spend most of her time practicing, which gradually alienated her from Zhang Ruochen.After the event happened three years ago, she had never been to the Yunwu Palace again. Although Zhang Ruochen had been ill for years, he still visited the Lin family to see her. Even meeting her once still excited him.However, he began to see her less and less. He had not seen her for over half a year. She had always told the maid to send Zhang Ruochen away.\u201cIt turns out that she is my cousin.\u201dActually, it was the first time Zhang Ruochen had seen Lin Ningshan in this life. He felt nothing toward her. Thus, he was very calm and modestly said, \u201cI have indeed opened the Sacred Mark. But the queen said that it was a Zero-Class mark. Therefore, it can\u2019t be compared to yours.\u201dLin Ningshan nodded, tipped her chin as supercilious as a swan, and said, \u201cYou have already turned 16. Unlocking the Sacred Mark may be a blessing for you. You have to work hard in your practice. Although you can\u2019t have strong Martial Art skills, it can still build your body to help you be free from sickness. For you\u2026 you can at least be a normal person.\u201dZhang Ruochen slightly frowned and nodded, saying, \u201cI will practice as hard as I can, and do my best to catch up to your cultivation.\u201dLin Ningshan definitely knew that Zhang Ruochen liked her. When she heard his words, she took it for granted that Zhang Ruochen still had a crush on her and wanted to go after her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell! Cousin, my cultivation has reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, which is very close to the Final State. As for you, you may never reach the Medium State. What you need to do is to practice step by step. You shouldn\u2019t make inappropriate requests and bite off more than you can chew. Otherwise, you will suffer from your actions,\u201d Lin Ningshan said with a double meaning.Zhang Ruochen wrinkled his brows even harder.Lin Ningshan sympathetically looked toward Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cCousin, one more thing. I hope that you won\u2019t be too sad. In three months, I will be engaged to the Seventh Prince when the Commandery Prince completes his refining.\u201d\u201cIt will be interesting! Hehe!\u201dAll the young warriors of the Lin family were amused by this. They turned their eyes, one after another, to see what Zhang Ruochen\u2019s reaction was to her words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt it was boring to talk with an uncongenial person, so he left after a moment.Seeing that Zhang Ruochen had shown no reaction, the young warriors in the Lin family were all greatly disappointed.\u201cHow could it be?\u201dLin Ningshan felt a bit frustrated with the indifferent look that had been on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s face. She stared at his back and full of resentment she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know the reason?\u201dZhang Ruochen had no interest in knowing who would get engaged to Lin Ningshan. Since she insisted on telling the details though, Zhang Ruochen stopped and gently nodded his head. \u201cI will be present during your engagement ceremony to offer my congratulations.\u201d \u201cNow I\u2019m going to see my mom, if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201dHe had hardly finished his words when Zhang Ruochen saw that Concubine Lin had come out of the courtyard of the Lin\u2019s Mansion.It was obvious that Concubine Lin had just been crying. Although she had dried her tears, Zhang Ruochen was quick to notice this upon seeing her red eyes.Zhang Ruochen rushed to comfort her and asked with concern, \u201cMom, what happened?\u201d \u201cIs there someone bullying you?\u201dShaking her head, Concubine Lin said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s just go back.\u201d\u201cThere must be something wrong, judging by that look on Concubine Lin\u2019s face.\u201dAfter meeting Lin Ningshan, Zhang Ruochen had lost his last good impression of the Lin family.And after seeing Concubine Lin\u2019s expression, Zhang Ruochen was even more disappointed in the Lin\u2019s.\u201cWait!\u201dLin Fengxian folded his hands behind his back and walked into the courtyard. Flashing a look at Zhang Ruochen, he pulled a scroll of fell ancient classics from within his sleeve and said, \u201cThis is a set of practice skills called theTaie Formulas of the Inferior Class of the Human Stage, which could open up seven Meridians, through which vital energy can circulate. Take it and practice it. Even though it is not an advanced practice skill, at least it might help you to complete Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels. It should be sufficient for you.\u201dEarlier, Lin Fengxian had ordered two bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid, and said coldly, \u201cAfter all, we share the same Blood Meridians of the Lin family. Take two bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid with you.\u201dConcubine Lin gazed unwaveringly at Lin Fengxian with grateful eyes. Immediately, she held Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand and said, \u201cChen-er, thank your uncle quickly.\u201dSeeing Lin Fengxian\u2019s almsgiving manner, Zhang Ruochen felt disgusted. It was no wonder that his mother\u2019s eyes were red from crying. She must have been humiliated when she begged him for a roll of practice skills.\u201cWe don\u2019t need handouts from the Lin family. Mom, let\u2019s go.\u201dZhang Ruochen did not even look at the practice scroll or take the Marrow-washing Liquid from Lin Fengxian as he took Concubine Lin\u2019s hand and left the Lin\u2019s Mansion.\u201cHe should be ashamed of himself. He did regard himself as the prince.\u201d The younger warriors in the Lin family all sniffed and sneered at him.Lin Ningshan looked at the teenager who resolutely left the Lin\u2019s Mansion and felt very surprised. She had the feeling that her once coward cousin was a bit different now.\u201cNow that he\u2019s obtained the Sacred Mark, he\u2019s naturally become a little unyielding.\u201d \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know that opening the Sacred Mark at 16 years old means that he has passed the golden age for practicing Martial Arts.\u201d \u201cWhy am I thinking so much, we\u2019re destined to belong to two different worlds anyway.\u201dLin Ningshan sighed and returned back to the Drill Coliseum and continued her practicing.After leaving the Lin\u2019s Mansion, Concubine Lin said, \u201cChen-er, you\u2019re too impulsive. If you can be a warrior and build strength through Martial Arts, it\u2019s OK for me to suffer all of these wrongs.\u201dStanding up straight, Zhang Ruochen turned around and stared at the golden horizontal inscribed board that was inscribed with \u201cLin\u2019s Mansion\u201d, then he said decisively, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I can still become a warrior even without the help of the Lins, and I\u2019ll be the superior one among the warriors.\u201dConcubine Lin sighed slightly and refrained from saying anything. Suddenly, she realized something and said, \u201cChen-er, have you heard that Ningshan will get engaged to the Seventh Prince? Don\u2019t be sad!\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled and said, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry! There are so many good girls in this world, and some of them are even better than Lin Ningshan.\u201d\u201cI am glad to hear you say that.\u201d Concubine Lin smiled with relief.Back at the Yunwu Palace, Zhang Ruochen took a Blood Pill and entered the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel, then he started practicing his Dragon and Elephant Prajna again.He sat down and had a short break once he had exhausted himself practicing.\u201cAll the humiliation that mom has suffered from the Lin family, I\u2019ll pay them back double that amount.\u201d \u201cWhat on earth had happened three years ago?\u201d \u201cIt seems that I shall find an opportunity to ask Yun. Of course, my primary goal now is to reach the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm as soon as possible.\u201dTo break through to the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm, one had to drink the Marrow-washing Liquid.It would cost him at least 200 silver coins for one bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid.That was not a small amount for Zhang Ruochen.And his practice was the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d. It was obvious that one bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid was not going to be sufficient if he wanted to break through to the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm.\u201cI got it!\u201dWhile tapping his forehead, Zhang Ruochen was filled with self-pity as he realized that he had wasted too much energy on earning silver coins, forgetting that he actually owned a huge treasury.After all, his last lifetime was spent as the son of Emperor Ming. He once performed many high-level exercises and martial art techniques and kept it all in his mind. He could choose one practice skill and martial technique at will to sell at a high price.\u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d and the Dragon and Elephant Prajna were at a holy level in the entire Kunlun\u2019s Field, and certainly, could not be sold.Tucked into his memories were some other Low-Class exercises and martial techniques. Any of which would surely cause quite a stir in the Yunwu Commandery.Zhang Ruochen immediately got some paper, a pen, and an ink-well. He then wrote down a set of Spiritual Stage martial techniques for the Sacred Sword Skill.The Sacred Sword Skill was the lowest level martial technique in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s memory.Low-Class of Spiritual.\u201cThe martial technique for the Low Class of Spiritual techniques would rank as the top technique in the Yunwu Commandery. Even for a large family like the Lins, their strongest technique would be of the Low Class of Spiritual, and would take one or two sets, at most, as the unique techniques of the family.\u201dIt was common knowledge that many warriors did not have opportunities for practicing martial techniques in the Yunwu Commandery. For them, it was an amazing treasure even if it was an Inferior-Class technique of the Human Stage.The cheapest Inferior-Class technique of the Human Stage would cost at least 300 silver coins, while some of the best Inferior-Class techniques of the Human Stage would cost more than 1,000 silver coins. This price was too high for ordinary Martial Arts cultivators to afford. Some warriors even risked their lives and fought with others in order to get the Inferior-Class techniques of the Human Stage.As for the martial techniques of the Low-Class of Spiritual, once they were sold, even the leader of those large families would be interested and would want to buy them at all costs.Their family\u2019s strength would advance a lot with one more martial technique from the Spiritual Stage.Finishing writing the practice method of the Sacred Sword Skill, Zhang Ruochen also drew some small pictures for one move of the sword technique on the paper.Zhang Ruochen made some Genuine Qi by condensing the pen tip. Combining Genuine Qi with the Martial Arts Comprehensive State allowed him to draw the sword movement picture.Inside, his Genuine Qi had been depleted, and that was only one finished picture.Zhang Ruochen sat with his legs crossed and immediately started practicing. He made his Qi Pool and filled it with Genuine Qi and then he began to draw the second picture.It took him half a day to finish drawing the 12 pictures of the Sacred Sword Skill.Even though his cultivation was gone, his comprehension of Martial Arts and his eyesight were still good. Each sword technique he drew was very exquisite. There were no differences when compared with the initial sword movement picture of the Sacred Sword Skill.\u201cAccording to my knowledge of Martial Arts, drawing the martial technique of the Low-Class of Spiritual is the limit.\u201d \u201cIf I were to draw a picture of the Mid-Class technique of the Spiritual Stage, perhaps I just could draw one-third of its Comprehensive State.\u201dThis rare book of a martial technique could not be easily copied or made monotype.It was unsound for ordinary people to write down the formulas and copy the pictures of the Sacred Sword Skill. Even if they succeeded in practicing the sword technique, it was impossible for them to reach the power of the Low-Class of Spiritual sword technique.Zhang Ruochen was the strongest at performing the Completion of the Heaven Realm in his last lifetime. But he only could draw the essence for the Low-Class of Spiritual sword technique. As for a martial technique of a superior level, he could not draw all of its essences.The sword technique of the Low-Class of Spiritual should sell at a good price.Instead of taking the sword technique of the Sacred Sword Skill to the Martial Market right away, Zhang Ruochen walked toward the palace gate while it was dark.\u201cNinth Prince, why are you here so late?\u201d Two royal security guards inquired.The two royal security guards also knew that the Ninth Prince and Concubine Lin had been evicted and lived in a side hall, which meant that they had lost power and influence within the palace. So their expressions did not look deferential, and they did not even salute Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen was not the same coward Zhang Ruochen from the past. He stared at the two royal security guards with sharp eyes, stuck out his chest and said, \u201cI have to go into the Lin\u2019s Mansion and find my cousin, Ningshan. Can you open the gate right away?\u201dAfter all, Zhang Ruochen was nobility. The two royal security guards could not really deny him. They opened up the gate and watched Zhang Ruochen go out.\u201cIs there anything to be proud of?\u201d \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t the son of the Yunwu Commandery Prince, he\u2019d have died many times over.\u201d One of the royal security guards scornfully commented.\u201cIt\u2019s said that the genius girl, Lin Ningshan, will get engaged to the Seventh Prince. But he hasn\u2019t given up, and that\u2019s so stupid,\u201d the other royal security guard said disdainfully.Zhang Ruochen did not actually intend to see Lin Ningshan, he just used it as an excuse to get out of the palace and avoid suspicion.While walking out of the palace, Zhang Ruochen took a loose black cloak out of the Time and Space Spinel and wrapped it around his body. He then went into the street of Yunwu City among the integrating lights.In the dark cape, nobody could see his face clearly.Not long after, Zhang Ruochen walked through the thriving streets and entered into the Martial Market.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOther places in Yunwu City were only referred to as the \u201ctawdry places\u201d. The Martial Market only occupied one-tenth of Yunwu City, but it was the most prosperous one there.The Martial Market itself was divided into five areas: the Pill Market, Weapon Market, Beast Market, Slave Market, and Central Auction.The Martial Market determined the ups and downs of the Yunwu Commandery to some extent. So the commandery was strict with its management.Each point of entry into the Martial Market was guarded by sergeants. Only warriors or nobility had the qualifications to enter into the Martial Market.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only when they were sold at the Central Auction could Zhang Ruochen maximize their martial technique value.Just after Zhang Ruochen walked into the Auction House, a beautiful maid, who was dressed neatly, sauntered over to him. Without showing any amazement from seeing him in mysterious clothes she asked politely, \u201cSir, can I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting the Superior Deacon of the Central Auction!\u201d Zhang Ruochen had changed his tone into a low and thick pitch, sounding like he was a 30 or 40-year-old middle-aged man.\u201cWho on earth is this guy? Wanting to meet the Superior Deacon when he had just arrived. He should be taken seriously.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell the Superior Deacon, however, he is usually busy receiving VIP customers. I am afraid that he will have no time to receive you. Could you please wait for a moment?\u201dAfter informing him, the maid walked through a big gate and went to inform the Superior Deacon.Zhang Ruochen was not in a hurry and just waited in the lobby quietly.Before too long, the maid returned through the gate with a plump elder who was wearing a gorgeous robe. She pointed in the direction of Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cThat\u2019s him, Mr. Superior Deacon.\u201dThe Superior Deacon glanced at Zhang Ruochen, who was still shrouded in his black cloak, and from far away, the deacon fixed his eyes on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s feet. His wrinkled eyes squinted slightly, lightening with a shrewdness.The pair of boots Zhang Ruochen wore were called \u201ckylin gold-gilded boots\u201d, and only the people in the royal palace had the right to put them on.Zhang Ruochen showed off his boots deliberately because, after all, he was intending to auction a sword technique of the Low-Class of Spiritual, which was inevitably coveted by other people. He had no ability to protect the sword technique with his present martial cultivation.If people recognized him as worthy of royalty, few would dare to question him.It was necessary for him to pretend that he was powerful and to frighten others, especially since he was actually not powerful.\u201cHe has an uncommon background!\u201dthe Superior Deacon thought to himself when he looked at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s boots.Suddenly, the Superior Deacon\u2019s attitude changed, and he respected Zhang Ruochen as if he were royalty. He walked in front of Zhang Ruochen and said in a humble voice, \u201cYour Excellency, this way please!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dIn order to impress him, Zhang Ruochen nodded and put his hands behind his back, pulling back his shoulders and reaching his full height.The warriors in the lobby saw the attitude of the Superior Deacon and they speculated about what great figure had come to the Central Auction.Arriving at the third floor of the Central Auction, Zhang Ruochen sat in the highest position comfortably and took a teacup that was offered by a maid. With a condescending tone, he said, \u201cI have a treasure that I intend to auction here. Please call in your most trusted appraiser to appraise it.\u201dHaving seen Zhang Ruochen\u2019s great attitude, the Superior Deacon further convinced himself that this guy was a key person in a royal palace, so he called in the appraiser promptly.After a short while, a gray-haired old man walked in.He looked like he was at least 70 or 80 years old, with a pair of bright piercing eyes. To his surprise, he found himself unable to figure out Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation.Immediately, the elder bowed to Zhang Ruochen respectfully and said, \u201cI\u2019m the appraiser for the Central Auction. Where is the treasure, Your Honor?\u201dThere were three kinds of situations where someone could not figure out someone else\u2019s martial cultivation. Firstly, if the other person\u2019s cultivation was higher than your own.Secondly, the practices of other person\u2019s exercises were more brilliant than normal ones.For example, warriors who practiced the Human Stage Exercises generally were unable to see the cultivation of warriors who practiced the Spirit Level Exercises. They could only guess at the other person\u2019s cultivation by details and aura.Definitely, if sharing similar exercise levels, people who had a higher cultivation could still outguess the martial cultivation of those lower.And thirdly, was when the other person possessed a treasure that hid his or her cultivation.The second and third cases were uncommon, therefore, instinctively, the elder treated Zhang Ruochen as the first case, thinking that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation was higher than his own, so he saluted him respectfully.It just so happened that Zhang Ruochen practiced \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d, which was equipped with profound exercises. Nobody in the entire Yunwu Commandery could see through his martial cultivation unless he showed his inner Meridians intentionally.Moreover, in his previous life, Zhang Ruochen was superior and reached the Completion of the Heaven Realm. Despite being reborn in a commoners flesh in this life, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s understanding of Martial Arts and soul carried over with his vital essence into this life.Only when one\u2019s Martial Arts realm was higher than the Completion of the Heaven Realm could one figure out Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation.Inside his sleeve, one of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hands touched the Time and Space Spinel. He reached into the internal space of it, grabbed the pithy formula of the \u201cSacred Sword Skill\u201d and handed it over to the elder.\u201cI would like to auction this sword technique of the Low Class of Spiritual!\u201d said Zhang lightly.Hearing what Zhang Ruochen had said, the chief appraiser was greatly surprised when he just handed over the pithy formula of the Sacred Sword Skill.He immediately unfolded the paper scroll and carefully examined it.The Superior Deacon, who had been standing to the side, quickly walked over to consult with the appraiser.Both the chief appraiser and the Superior Deacon were Martial Arts masters, so they soon came to a decision and nodded together.\u201cThis is an authentic pithy formula of a Low-Class of the Spiritual sword technique, and I\u2019m wondering, how many sword movements have you acquired?\u201d asked the Superior Deacon.Only through combined formulas with the sword movement, could the sword technique of the Low Class of Spiritual wield its real power.Even if the Superior Deacon and the chief appraiser were to bear the pithy formulas of the Sacred Sword Skill in mind, without the combination of sword techniques, it was useless.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cThe entire Sacred Sword Skill covers 12 of the sword techniques, the first edition has been lost for a long time. This Sacred Sword Skill that I have was drawn by a superior in the Heaven Realm, and the sword techniques in it are no different than the first edition.\u201dThe chief appraiser meditated for a moment and said, \u201cIn that case, the starting bid for the Sacred Sword Skill would be 200,000 silver coins. But, as a prerequisite, the buyer can verify these are the real Low-Class of Spiritual sword movements, otherwise, the auction will fail.\u201dWhile nodding, Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cAll done according to the rules of the Auction House!\u201dAs the most high-profile and outstanding item, this Sacred Sword Skill could be auctioned tonight.Before starting the auction, the Central Auction would inform all of the major families in Yunwu City as soon as possible.Carrying great fortunes, they would all come to the Martial Market at the planned auction and bid on this of Low-Class of Spiritual sword technique.Zhang Ruochen cared more about the results rather than the process.The auction took about four hours and the final results were known.Eventually, the Sacred Sword Skill was bid on by the Lin family leader and was won at the high price of 1,240,000 silver coins.\u201cThe Lin family!\u201d Zhang Ruochen was amazed when he heard the result.Before long, led by the Superior Deacon, Lin Fengxian, the head of the Lins, Lin De, an elder uncle of Lin, and Lin Ningshan, one of the four most beautiful girls in the Yunwu Commandery, walked in from outside.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is the seller of the Sacred Sword Skill.\u201d The Superior Deacon announced with a big smile, pointing at Zhang Ruochen, who was sitting in the highest position.Observing his \u201ckylin gold-gilded boots\u201d, Lin Fengxian nodded and bowed slightly and then said, \u201cI\u2019m Lin Fengxian, the Head of the Lins. May I know your name, Sir?\u201dBefore entering, Lin Fengxian had received a description of this mystery man from the Superior Deacon, knowing that he could be an important person in the royal palace with a remarkable background.Thus, as the Head of the Lin, he was in the lower position.He was concerned that he would be identified by Lin Fengxian and Lin Ningshan, thus Zhang Ruochen decided to behave more cautiously.He cleared his throat and spoke low, \u201cThere is no need to know my name. Here are the pithy formulas of the Sacred Sword Skill and the sword movement pictures, please verify them.\u201dHe took them out of his sleeve and placed them on the table.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Fengxian did not inspect the formula since he trusted the Central Auction had already done their job carefully before auctioning off the item.He spread the Sacred Sword Skill scroll out on the table, and they saw 12 sword movement pictures in total, each portraying an image of a human practicing with a sword.Ordinary people would not be able to identify the special markings in them, however, to Lin Fengxian, the 12 features appeared to be alive as they were practicing with their swords.Every sword technique was exceptional and they showed a profound Martial Arts Comprehensive State, even one move could have unlimited benefits.\u201cThis series of sword techniques are top class. What a worthwhile purchase!\u201d Lin Fengxian exclaimed with excitement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s indeed swordsmanship of the Low Class of Spiritual. Furthermore, it has sword movement graphics drawn by a predecessor from the Heaven Realm!\u201dWith a smile on his face, Lin Fengxian put the code and the graphics of the Sacred Sword Skill away immediately.It was terrific!The Lin family\u2019s foundation would become much stronger with this sword technique of the Low-Class of Spiritual added to its collection.The Superior Deacon walked over to Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cMaster, the Sacred Sword Skill was sold for 1,240,000 silver coins at auction. Minus the 12,000 silver coins paid to the auction, you will receive 1,228,000 million silver coins in the end. Would you prefer to exchange them for Spiritual Crystals, or Blood Pills, or deposit them in the Martial Market Bank?\u201dWhen ordinary people traded, they usually used copper, silver, or gold coins. However, when warriors traded with each other, they generally used Blood Pills or Spiritual Crystals.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cDeposit 1,200,000 silver coins in the Martial Market Bank, and exchange 20,000 silver coins for Spiritual Crystals, then give the remaining 8,000 silver coins to me.\u201dAn hour later, the Superior Deacon gave a card made from a yellow spinel to Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cMaster, this is the Three-star VIP Card of the Martial Market Bank. The 1,200,000 silver coins have been deposited in it.\u201dA \u201cVIP Card\u201d was a symbol of identity, and few people in the Yunwu Commandery had the Three-star VIP Card.Owning a Three-star VIP Card meant that your wealth was above 1,000,000 silver coins.Then, the Superior Deacon gave a package containing 20 Spiritual Crystals and 8,000 silver coins to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen picked up the package and walked out of the Central Auction without saying a word.\u201cThis guy\u2019s back looks so familiar!\u201dLin Ningshan stared at that dark shadow walking away and had a familiar feeling in her heart.Lin Fengxian said, \u201cI felt that familiar feeling a bit, too. Maybe I\u2019ve seen him in the palace. This is not an ordinary guy. Maybe his true identity is a little scary.\u201dLin Ningshan asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you say that, daddy?\u201dLin Fengxian said seriously, \u201cThe ink of the Sacred Sword Skill is still wet, which means that the graphics were drawn today, but anyone who could draw the Sacred Sword Skill must be a superior of the Heaven Realm.\u201d\u201cThat means that this guy is either the superior of the Heaven Realm or has a connection to a superior of the Heaven Realm. Either way, we can\u2019t afford to offend him.\u201d\u201cA superior of the Heaven Realm\u2026\u201d\u00a0Lin Ningshan was shocked, and she said, \u201cIt seems that even grandpa has not yet reached the Heaven Realm.\u201dLin Fengxian nodded, with some longing in his eyes.There were four realms in Martial Arts: the Yellow Realm, the Black Realm, the Earth Realm, and the Heaven Realm.\u201cThe Heaven Realm\u201d referred to the acme realm of Martial Arts, full of Martial Arts legends. A man from the Realm of Heaven could confront an army of 100,000 alone. They were the truly superiors.When someone surpassed the Heaven Realm, they no longer belonged to Martial Arts, or even to the mortal body. Their capabilities were beyond normal warriors\u2019 imaginations.Lin Ningshan said, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be many superiors of the Heaven Realm in the palace. Maybe if we tried to, we could find out who he was.\u201dLin Fengxian\u2019s face became austere and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t do such a foolish thing. The Lins will pay a heavy price if we offend a superior of the Heaven Realm.\u201dWith sparkling wisdom in her eyes, Lin Ningshan said, \u201cI have a question, daddy! Since he is someone important in the palace, he wouldn\u2019t have run short of silver coins. So, why did he sell a Spiritual Stage sword technique at auction?\u201dLin Fengxian thought carefully for a while and said, \u201cThere are eight Martial Arts of the Royal Family, which are all famous, but the Sacred Sword Skill wasn\u2019t one of them. We\u2019d better not investigate it. The Lin family can\u2019t afford to offend a superior of the Heaven Realm.\u201d\u201cShan, you have the Sacred Mark of sword technique, thus, you are the best candidate to practice this Sacred Sword Skill. You will definitely shine among the young nobles in the Year-end Assessment if you can practice the first art of sword techniques successfully within three months.\u201d\u2026Zhang Ruochen walked out of the Martial Market after leaving the Central Auction. He made a detour in Yunwu City and found a hidden spot to take off his black cloak and kylin gold-gilded boots. He put them into the Time and Space Spinel, then put on a pair of ordinary cloth shoes.He looked just like an ordinary young warrior in this garb.\u201cNow, no one will recognize that I was the mystery man who just sold the Sacred Sword Skill at auction.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked into the Martial Market again to purchase the items that he needed, holding the parcel with Spiritual Crystals and silver coins in it.First of all, he spent 4,000 silver coins on 20 potions of Marrow-washing Liquid.Then, he spent another 1,000 silver coins to buy 200 pellets of Blood Pills. According to his current cultivation, First-Class Blood Pills were quite sufficient. 200 First-Class Blood Pills could support him for half a year.Later, he bought the other two medicines that could increase his cultivation, \u201cRefining Powder\u201d and \u201cEnergy Pills\u201d.Both of them were very expensive, even the genius disciple of the great families could not afford such treasures when they were at the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm.But for a wealthy man like Zhang Ruochen, as long as it could increase his cultivation quickly, he would be willing to spending as many silver coins as he had.Finally, he spent five Spiritual Crystals on five doses of Refining Powder.Another 10 Spiritual Crystals on 10 Energy Pills.He also bought Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment for Yun for 500 silver coins. Apart from the 1,200,000 silver coins that he kept in the Martial Market Bank, he had five Spiritual Crystals and 2,500 silver coins with him.Zhang Ruochen returned to the palace again after he stored all the Pills he just bought into the Time and Space Spinel.\u201cSister Yun, this is the Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment that I bought for you. It will help your arm heal quicker.\u201d Zhang Ruochen took out an elegant ebony box and gave it to Yun.Yun seemed a little shocked for a moment. Then a bit nervously, she took the ebony box and opened it.It immediately exuded a fragrance of the medicine that was inside.She felt grateful and surprised at the same time and asked, \u201cNinth Prince, where\u2026 where did you get the silver coins for the Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment?\u201dIt was common knowledge that the Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment of the lowest quality cost 200 silver coins. The better one even cost 500 silver coins.Zhang Ruochen smiled and said, \u201cSister Yun, I have some secrets that I can\u2019t tell you right now. I hope that you can keep a secret for me.\u201dYun stared at Zhang Ruochen deeply and nodded. She whispered, \u201cMay I tell Concubine Lin?\u201d\u201cNot now,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.\u201cWell, you have my word.\u201d Yun held the ebony box in her hand tightly and felt relieved inside. Since the Ninth Prince could spend hundreds of silver coins to buy her Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment, he certainly had great opportunities.Maybe the Ninth Prince would become a superior of Martial Arts in the future.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cThere is one thing that I can\u2019t understand, and I hope Sister Yun can tell me the truth. My mother is the sister of the Head of the Lins. Why did she break off all relations with the Lin\u2019s? What happened three years ago?\u201dYun sighed and said, \u201cSince you are always sick and weak, and couldn\u2019t stand the shock, it was kept a secret. But you have opened the Sacred Mark now, so I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cYou should remember Lin Chenyu, the top genius of the Lin family. He is your cousin, and also the eldest son of the Head of the Lins. He practiced to the Completion of the Yellow Realm when he was just 17.\u201d\u201cBut three years ago, Lin Chenyu offended another genius, a greater genius than himself. His legs were broken by that genius, and he was sent to the Celestial Prison.\u201d\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked. \u201cThe Lin family counts as one of the top great families in the Yunwu Commandery. Who would dare to send the top genius of the Lin family to the Celestial Prison? Could it be that the genius offended by Lin Chenyu had an extraordinary background?\u201dYun nodded and said, \u201cYes. Lin Chenyu offended the Seventh Prince, the most shining star in the Yunwu Commandery. Compared to the Seventh Prince, all other geniuses mean nothing.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Zhang Ruochen nodded. He finally understood.Yun continued, \u201cThe Head of the Lins came into the palace at once to beg Concubine Lin after Lin Chenyu was sent to the Celestial Prison. He had hoped that Concubine Lin could ask the Commandery Prince for a favor. He would pay any price if only he would spare Lin Chenyu\u2019s life.\u201cNaturally, Concubine Lin went immediately and asked to meet the Commandery Prince, but she was blocked by the queen. They had an argument about it. In a fit of rage, the Queen sentenced Concubine Lin to be flogged 30 times as punishment. Concubine Lin was covered in blood and nearly died when the punishment was over.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dZhang Ruochen smacked the pillar with his palm, biting his teeth, and said, \u201cDid the Yunwu Commandery Prince just let it go without even caring?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun said, \u201cYou should understand that the Seventh Prince was the most talented of the Commandery Prince\u2019s nine sons. The Commandery Prince loved him deeply and had great expectations for him. Commandery Prince did a thorough investigation and found out it was totally Lin Chenyu\u2019s fault, who nearly killed the Seventh Prince.\u201d\u201cThe Yunwu Commandery Prince flew into a rage because of this. He thought that Concubine Lin was unreasonable to even think of asking a favor for Lin Chenyu, a man who had made such a huge mistake.\u201d\u201cThe Yunwu Commandery Prince used to love Concubine Lin very much, but after that, he treated her more coldly.\u201dYun continued, \u201cThe Lins didn\u2019t understand the suffering that Concubine Lin had undergone. They didn\u2019t dare to blame the queen or the Seventh Prince, so they blamed Concubine Lin for all of it. In their opinion, they lost a top genius just because Concubine Lin didn\u2019t ask the Commandery Prince for a favor. The Lins cast Concubine Lin out, and have dissociated with her completely since then.\u201dZhang Ruochen took a deep breath. He felt bitter about the unfair treatment Concubine Lin had suffered. He clenched his fist and hit the pillar again. With a deep voice, he said, \u201cPower! Without great power, you can\u2019t survive in this world. You can\u2019t get fair treatment!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you think that the Seventh Prince would let it go just like that?\u201d said Yun, \u201cLin Chenyu was sentenced to castration and became a eunuch. He was also made a slave by the Seventh Prince.\u201dZhang Ruochen replied, \u201cThe top genius of the Lins is now a eunuch, and was even made a slave of his enemy. This is simply a great humiliation for the Lins.\u201dYun frowned and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t get it. Since the Lins were humiliated so badly, why does their leader still want to marry their daughter to the Seventh Prince?\u201dZhang Ruochen answered, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand. With his talent, the Seventh Prince will succeed to the throne and become the lord of the Yunwu Commandery. The Lins have to repair the relations between their families. An arranged marriage is the best choice.\u201d\u201cSecondly, since the Lins\u2019 top genius has become a servant of the Seventh Prince, the relations between them may not be as bad as we thought. Perhaps this arranged marriage between Lin Ningshan and the Seventh Prince is a plot cooked up by Lin Chenyu.\u201dStaring at Zhang Ruochen, Yun could not believe that the Ninth Prince could analyze all of these situations in such a clear way. Instead of acting like that cowardly boy, he gave off a sense of tact and sagacity.\u201cIt seems that the Sacred Mark has changed all that for him since its opening.\u201d\u00a0Yun thought.\u00a0\u201cIf Concubine Lin learns of this, she would be delighted.\u201dAfter going back to his own room, Zhang Ruochen entered the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel right away.\u201cNow, it\u2019s time for me to open up the second Meridian.\u201dZhang Ruochen opened the jade bottle and drained all of the Marrow-washing Liquid.Under the potency of the Marrow-washing Liquid, all of the blood inside of his body felt as if it was boiling. Using the great potency, Zhang Ruochen immediately started to open up the second Meridian following the instructions in the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d.The more Meridians that one opened, the faster the Spiritual Qi would be absorbed and the faster the running speed of Genuine Qi inside his body would be.The more Meridians that were inside one\u2019s body, the stronger one\u2019s body would be for Martial Arts. In the same realm, he could break out a stronger fighting force.With the help of his past practice experience, Zhang Ruochen soon opened up the second Meridian and the Genuine Qi also ran faster than before.\u201cThe Qi Pool hasn\u2019t expanded, and I didn\u2019t make it to the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm. I must open up another Meridian.\u201dZhang Ruochen took a Blood Pill and regained his strength. After resting for about an hour, he got back in the groove, drank another bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid, and started to open up the third Meridian.After opening up a new Meridian, other monks would have had to recuperate for one to three months, usually to increase the tenacity and activity of their Meridians, before they started to open up the next one.However, Zhang Ruochen could not wait a month. He eagerly opened up his third Meridian immediately to challenge the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm.Doing it this way more than doubled the difficulty.\u201cI can make it. I have to make it. By tonight, I will be in the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm.\u201dHolding a Spiritual Crystal, Zhang Ruochen absorbed the Spiritual Qi inside the Spiritual Crystal while removing all of Genuine Qi in his body, and pushed forward to the third Meridian furiously.\u201cBang!\u201dA thud came from the glabella on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s forehead.His Qi Pool, which was once only as big as a basketball, immediately expanded tenfold and became as big as a vat of water. It looked just like a bathhouse pool, which was about one square meter in diameter.Now, his Qi Pool would be regarded as a real Qi Pool.\u201cThis is the cultivation of the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm!\u201d\u201cThis is just the very beginning of the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm. I don\u2019t have much Genuine Qi left inside. Of course, I can progress now. If I fill my Qi Pool through practice, the Genuine Qi inside my body will be expanded by 10 as well.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Zhang Ruochen felt so excited for making his great martial cultivation progress.The Qi Pool would also be expanded with a new higher realm, which of course, could hold more Genuine Qi.If one could not break through to a new realm, his Genuine Qi would never increase, even with 10 years of practice. That was because the capacity of the Qi Pool was fixed for each realm and it could only hold a certain amount of Genuine Qi in reserve.At the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm, impurities from inside the body were carried out of the body through the pores. The impurities looked like a layer of black slime and gave off a slight odor of rotten fish.Zhang Ruochen immediately fetched a pail of warm water. After bathing, he put on a clean suit and immediately went back into the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.While holding a brush pen in his hand, he smoothly drew a human figure on the scroll.Later, he drew the 36 meridians of the human figure according to his memory alone. The traveling routes for all of these meridians were different from one another.They had one thing in common though\u2014the 36 Meridians all gathered together in the Qi Pool in his glabella.The first time that Zhang Ruochen read through the first level of the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean, he saw this very same \u201cGraph of Meridians\u201d on it without any explanation. It just could be self-perceived.The more superior level exercises one practiced, the more Meridians he would open and the faster the running speed of Genuine Qi inside his body.\u201cThe exercise methods for the Inferior Class of the Human Stage can only open up seven of the Meridians.\u201d\u201cAccording to the \u2018Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u2019, there are traveling routes for the 36 Meridians. Each one will increase the practicing Meridian and help strengthen the Body of Martial Arts. If all 36 Meridians are opened, could I even imagine how strong the Body of Martial Arts would be?\u201dThe word \u201cRealm\u201d in \u201cYellow Realm\u201d referred to the specific extremity of the Meridians.Zhang Ruochen had opened up only 33 Meridians in his last lifetime. There were another three Meridians that he had been unable to open up no matter how hard he tried!With just the 33 Meridians having been opened up in his last lifetime, he was able to defeat his contemporaries. Even Empress Chi Yao, who was ranked number one, opened up just 32 Meridians, one less than he had.\u201cI\u2019ve opened up three Meridians now belonging to the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm. In order to break through to the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm, I\u2019ll have to open up at least three more Meridians.\u201dZhang Ruochen rolled up \u201cThe Graph of Meridians\u201d and put it on the stone table.One had to first fill his Qi Pool with Genuine Qi if he wanted to reach the advanced stage of the Yellow Realm.If he practiced in the usual way, he would need one and a half months to fill his body and his Qi Pool with Genuine Qi, even with the help of Spiritual Qi from the Spiritual Crystals.Zhang Ruochen could not wait that long, so he decided to take his Energy Pill.An Energy Pill was worth 1,000 silver coins. For ordinary warriors, it was a rare treasure. Even the younger children from medium-level families found it hard to get an Energy Pill.Zhang Ruochen had bought 10 at a time, by which his cultivation could be improved quickly.An Energy Pill was as small as a pearl and had a light scent. A plume of Spiritual Qi could be seen flowing on the surface of the Pill with the naked eye.He put an Energy Pill in his mouth.A moment later.\u201cBang!\u201d The Energy Pill exploded inside his body and turned into a cloud of Pill Spirit, moving up and down inside of him.The three Meridians took in the Pill Spirit at a fast speed. Traveling inside his body for a large circle, gathering vital energy, the Pill Spirit then turned into Genuine Qi and then was stored in the Qi Pool.Although Zhang Ruochen tried his best to absorb the Pill Spirit, there was still 70% that ran out of his pores, which meant that he took in only 30% of the Pill Spirit of the Energy Pill.He had spent all day to transform that 30% into his Genuine Qi.After refining all of that 30% Pill Spirit, the Genuine Qi in his Qi Pool doubled.\u201cI opened up only three Meridians, so the transformation speed of the Genuine Qi is still too slow, as 70% of it is lost. If a warrior is in the Dawn State the Yellow Realm, he can transform all of the Pill Spirit of the Energy Pill into Genuine Qi without any waste.\u201d\u201cForget it! As long as I can make rapid progress with my cultivation, spending more silver coins is worth it. Based on the potency of the Energy Pill, I can fill my Qi Pool with Genuine Qi with only four more pills.\u201dLuckily, Zhang Ruochen now had plenty of silver coins and did not need to worry about money. Otherwise, he would be unwilling to buy even one Energy Pill with 1,000 silver coins.Instead of taking a second Energy Pill, he stopped his practice and went back to his room in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.He had practiced inside the Time and Space Spinel for more than one day, but in the outside world, only half a day had passed.It was just noon at the moment.Zhang Ruochen did not disturb Yun or Concubine Lin. He fetched a bucket of warm water and took it back his room.He was not going to take a normal bath, but a medicated bath.For a warrior, practicing with only Genuine Qi was not enough. He also needed to practice his martial skills.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s physical health was weaker than his peers\u2019. If he wanted to make himself strong within a few months, he needed not only fighting practice but medicated baths as well.Zhang Ruochen bought five more portions of the Refining Powder, each of which cost 1,000 silver coins.He poured one portion of the Refining Powder into the barrel.\u201cChi!\u201d A white smoke floated up from the barrel.Zhang Ruochen sat cross-legged in the center of the barrel. His head was submerged under the liquid.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe liquid was as hot as boiling water and it bubbled up and released pockets of steam.A sharp pain shot across the surface of his skin. Later on, that sharp pain permeated into his flesh and blood, and then into his marrow and into his five internal organs.The burning pain ran through his body. If he were any other warrior, he could not possibly bear this pain and would have jumped out of the barrel.Zhang Ruochen was as solid as a rock, sitting cross-legged on the bottom of the barrel without any changes to his facial expression. He endured this pain of his flesh silently.Only by experiencing the most difficult hardships could one rise above the ordinary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He transferred the Genuine Qi in his body to the three Meridians.The pain lessened with each cycle of the Genuine Qi.He could not hold his breath to practice underwater too long due to his current level of martial cultivation, so he had to come up from the water to breathe every five minutes.After two hours, the pain had almost disappeared. A flow of cool air came into his body to regenerate it. The feeling was so pleasant that it almost made him moan.\u201cCrash!\u201dZhang Ruochen stood up and wiped himself dry. He stood in front of a bronze mirror, stared at his own body, and nodded.The 10-day practice and the alleviation from the medicated bath had strengthened his body to some extent. He used to look so ill.Only four days had passed in reality of course, while over 10 days had passed in the Time and Space Spinel.Four days ago, he was a loser driven away from the Jade Palace by the Eighth Prince and was laughed at mercilessly by everybody. Who could have even imagined, however, that only four days later he would have attained the cultivation of the Mid Stage of the Yellow State?It was a miracle!\u201cThat\u2019s not enough! The Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm is only the beginning!\u201d\u00a0With a sharp look in his eyes, Zhang Ruochen clenched his fist.After putting on his clothes, he took a Blood Pill and entered the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel to continue his practice.The reason why he could attain the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm in merely four days was not only because he had Martial Arts experience in his last life, but also because of the help of the Time and Space Spinel.He could practice three times longer than the other warriors with the help of the Time and Space Spinel, which was his unique advantage.\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cGalloping Elephant!\u201dZhang Ruochen bent his legs, stepped out, and punched. Every punch gathered the power of each muscle and every bone.After the medicated bath, one needed to use the fist technique in order to integrate the medicated effects into the body, thus transferring it into their own power.Zhang Ruochen spent the next few days mainly practicing inside the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and only came outside every three days.Concubine Lin knew that Zhang Ruochen had just obtained his Sacred Mark and he needed to seclude himself for refining, open up his Qi Pool, wash his marrow, and break out of the channels. Therefore, she did not get involved with him, but simply asked Yun to take good care of him.She still continued to sell her accessories and used the money to buy Blood Pills for Zhang Ruochen.At that time, Zhang Ruochen asked Yun to secretly buy those accessories back at a higher price.It was a feeling beyond description. Zhang Ruochen was greatly moved by selfless love.Gradually, Zhang Ruochen was accepting his identity in this life and saw Concubine Lin as his real mother.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we tell Concubine Lin the truth? She would be overjoyed if she knew that you are a real warrior now,\u201d said Yun.\u201cNot now. I want to surprise her at the Year-end Assessment. Apart from that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m strong enough now. I need to be even stronger,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Yun now knew a lot of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s secrets.Except for the secret of his last life and the Time and Space Spinel, Zhang Ruochen had told her everything.In Yun\u2019s view, the Ninth Prince was an incredibly outstanding genius of Martial Arts. In only a few days\u2019 time, he had reached the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm, which no other prince could compare with.Perhaps only the best-of-the-best, Prince Seventh, could be mentioned in the same breath as him.After achieving the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm, Zhang Ruochen kept practicing in the Time and Space Spinel for a month, taking an Energy Pill every six days and a medicated bath every 10 days.His other time was spent on practicing the second movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Dragon in the Sky, and understanding the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d and \u201cThe Graph of Meridians\u201d.The Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool was completed but the second movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was not ready yet.\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll try to reach the advanced stage of the Yellow Realm!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.After hearing this, Yun was so surprised and said, \u201cAdvanced stage of the Yellow Realm! But you\u2019ve just reached the Mid Stage only 10 days ago! Are you going to go for the Advanced Stage already? It took the Eighth Prince four years to do that!\u201dYun did not know about the existence of the Time and Space Spinel, so she thought that Zhang Ruochen had only practiced for 10 days. In fact, Zhang Ruochen had been practicing for a whole month.Actually, it should not have even taken him that long. He spent a large amount of his time refining his body, otherwise, his practicing speed would have been even faster.\u201cIt is really that fast? It has just all come when it has needed to.\u201dZhang Ruochen never considered that his practice speed was very fast. He believed that if other geniuses had the good resources that he had, they would also be fast.The Eighth Prince taking four years only proved that he was a man of terrible endowments.Anyway, Yun was very excited now. She said, \u201cI know that you are going to succeed. If you can reach the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm, we don\u2019t need to be afraid of the Eighth Prince anymore!\u201d\u201cYes! Now please leave me alone. I don\u2019t want anyone disturbing me tonight,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Yun nodded her head so hard that she looked like a pecking little chick. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll guard the door tonight. If anyone dares to disturb you, I\u2019ll risk my life to stop him.\u201dHe gazed at her with deep feeling and said softly, \u201cThank you.\u201dAfter Yun left, Zhang Ruochen entered the internal space of Time and Space Spinel right away.\u201cIf I want to break through to the advanced stage of the Yellow Realm, I must open up three Meridians at once, and make these Meridians penetrate the five internal organs, arms, and feet.\u201dZhang Ruochen took out three jade bottles at once and put them in a row. Inside every bottle, there was one portion of Marrow-washing Liquid.After adjusting himself to the best state, Zhang Ruochen drank the first bottle. With the help of the medicating effect, he started to open up the fourth Meridian.After half an hour, the fourth Meridian was opened up successfully.The fourth Meridian flowed from the Qi Pool and came to his neck, chest, left arm, and right arm. It then flowed all the way from his back and rushed to his head. Finally, it came back to the Qi Pool between his eyebrows. A large circulation of vital energy was completed.Without pausing, Zhang Ruochen drank the second bottle and started to open up the fifth Meridian immediately.The fifth Meridian extended from the Qi Pool and went through his chest, stomach, left leg, and right leg, and finally returned to the Qi Pool.This Meridian had a longer route, which took Zhang Ruochen six hours to open up successfully.Half of the Genuine Qi had been used up. Zhang Ruochen was covered in sweat, so he had to take a Spiritual Crystal in his hand and quickly absorb the Spiritual Qi to transfer it into Genuine Qi. Then he stored it in the Qi Pool.The Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool was once again full.Zhang Ruochen immediately drank the third bottle and started to open up the sixth Meridian.This Meridian flowed through the five internal organs, namely: spleen, lungs, kidney, liver, and heart. When the Genuine Qi flowed through them, it would strengthen them. The five internal organs, however, were extremely fragile. Therefore, Zhang Ruochen had to be much more careful.Finally, 12 hours had passed and the Genuine Qi was almost again used up. But there was still one part left to be opened up.If the Genuine Qi ran out, all of his previous efforts would have been in vain, and the five internal organs would even be hurt.Furthermore, it would be 10 times more difficult to open up this Meridian in the future than it was at this time.Zhang Ruochen made a bold decision. He put an Energy Pill in his mouth at a blistering speed.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Pill Spirit of the Energy Pill exploded inside his body.Zhang Ruochen multitasked immediately. On the one hand, he used the five Meridians that were already opened up to absorb the Pill Spirit, transferred it into Genuine Qi, and moved it to the Qi Pool.On the other hand, he carefully controlled the Genuine Qi and continued to break through the sixth Meridian.It was a great test of his Spiritual Power. Fortunately, Zhang Ruochen was a strong warrior of the Completion of the Realm of Heaven in his last life, whose Spiritual Power was strong enough to perform multitasking successfully.The sixth Meridian was opened up successfully!The Qi Pool between his eyebrows glowed white, and its capacity became 10 times greater than before.The Qi Pool at the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm had been only as big as a rice jar.Now, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Qi Pool was about 10 rice jars in size, which was big enough to hold a large amount of Genuine Qi.\u201cI finally made it to the advanced stage of the Yellow Realm!\u201dZhang Ruochen put a Spiritual Crystal in his hand, and then his Sacred Mark between his eyebrows appeared and started to absorb the Spiritual Qi from the Spiritual Crystal.The absorbing speed was doubled when the six Meridians worked simultaneously.Zhang Ruochen stopped practicing when the realm had become stable.He opened his eyes. His pupils became incomparably bright, just like two stars in the sky.Lots of impure substances excreted from his pores with the opening up of the three new Meridians. So the stench was unbearable.Zhang Ruochen went out of the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and took a bath in the prepared bucket. Then he put his clothes on and stepped outside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was already midnight.The feathery snowflakes were dancing in the sky, and the whole courtyard was covered with a layer of silver frost.Yun was sitting on the stairs outside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s room. Her body was curled up and she rubbed her hands and breathed on them from time to time.\u201cCreak!\u201dHearing the door behind her open, Yun quickly stood up and looked at Zhang Ruochen, who had just walked outside. She asked with joy, \u201cDid you succeed?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he said, \u201cI have reached the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm! But why didn\u2019t you take a rest, Yun?\u201dAfter hearing what Zhang Ruochen had said, Yun was so shocked that her heart wildly thumped with unparalleled excitement and she felt like crying.\u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great!\u201d Yun said while wiping her tears, 'since I said that I would guard the gate for you, I would certainly never leave.\u201dTouched by what Yun had said, Zhang Ruochen gave her a Blood Pill.\u201cIt\u2019s snowing. I hope that you can go to bed early to avoid catching a cold. Eat this Blood Pill and you will feel warmer,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said to Yun.Taking the Blood Pill and tightly grasping it in her hands, Yun nodded deeply. She went to her room while thinking that tonight might be a sleepless night.After sending Yun away, Zhang Ruochen went back to the center of the snow-covered courtyard.Although the snow fell on his head and shoulders, Zhang Ruochen stood still.\u201cThe second movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Dragon in the Sky.\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Ruochen made a heavy step on the ground. Countless snowflakes immediately rose up. His arms and legs rotated as quickly as a rapidly rotating turbine, rolling up countless snowflakes.He flew up to seven meters high with the help of the strength in his legs. With the sinking dragon\u2019s roar coming from his mouth, his palm slapped a heavy boulder.\u201cBang!\u201dThe heavy boulder suddenly broke into pieces and the pieces flew in all directions, finally falling into the thick snow.Zhang Ruochen stood in the snow and happily stared at the pieces. Then he thought.\u00a0\u201cFinally. I have succeeded in practicing the second movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, and now it\u2019s as powerful as a martial technique of the Mid Class of the Human Stage.\u201dNow, not only the second movement of the Dragon in the Sky but also the first movement of the Elephant Galloping was as powerful as a martial technique of the Mid-Class Human Stage.If Zhang Ruochen succeeded in the third movement, the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm would be as powerful as a martial technique of the Superior-Class Human Stage.Once he succeeded in the Palm, his martial technique would advance up a level, becoming more sophisticated and mysterious.\u201cThe first movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Elephant Galloping.\u201dZhang Ruochen moved his feet and rushed out as quickly as a brute elephant. Then he slapped in the air and a string of Qi explosion sounds echoed through the air.Countless snowflakes rose up and flew into the air, melting into drops of ice water from the power of his palm.Zhang Ruochen thought.\u00a0\u201cAlthough the first movement of the Elephant Galloping is less powerful than the second movement, it is indeed as powerful as a martial technique of the mid-class of the Human Stage. The Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm is really abstruse.\u201dHis power was not as mighty as a brute elephant, but at least was as powerful as a brute bull.It was called \u201cStrength of A Bull\u201d in the practice of Martial Arts techniques.It was known that not every warrior in advanced stage of the Yellow Realm could unleash the \u201cStrength of A Bull\u201d. The warriors who could unleash it were above average in advanced stage of the Yellow Realm.Zhang Ruochen had just reached advanced stage of the Yellow Realm, but he had been able to unleash the Strength of A Bull with the help of the advantage of the six internal Meridians and the power of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, which showed that he had unlimited potential.With his cultivation increasing and his body becoming stronger, he certainly could unleash more powerful forces.After he cleaned up the pieces, Zhang Ruochen went back to his room and, instead of practicing, just lay in bed to relax and fell asleep.As for him, after breaking through to advanced stage of the Yellow Realm, he finally could have a smooth and steady sleep.He thought that it would take him three months to reach this realm. However, he only spent half a month to reach it with the help of the power of the space-time Spiritual Crystal and a great amount of practicing resources.Before the Year-end Assessment, he had confidence that he could break through to a higher realm.After a night\u2019s rest, the next day Zhang Ruochen had full energy and power.He thought.\u00a0\u201cI need to buy some Energy Pills and Refining Powder in the Martial Market because I only have half of it left.\u201dAfter having breakfast with Concubine Lin and Yun, Zhang Ruochen left for the Martial Market alone.He walked into a store named the \u201cQingxuan Pavilion\u201d in the Pill Market.Located at the crossroads, this store ranked in the top three of all the stores in the Pill Market. The warriors who were passing by there would walk into this store. Some bought the correct Pills and others sold precious medicinal materials that they had just picked.A moment or so later, an old man with a black mole on his lips came close to Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cWould you like to buy some Energy Pills, sir?\u201dWith a little shock, Zhang Ruochen turned to the old man and deeply glanced at him.The old man must have had excellent Martial Arts skills because he could silently get so close to Zhang Ruochen. But for his voice, it might have been hard for Zhang Ruochen to find him.\u201cThe old man must be a master of Martial Arts!\u201dThe old man smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Mo Hanlin, the shopkeeper of this store.\u201d\u201cYou are the shopkeeper? Hello, my first name is Zhang.\u201d Zhang Ruochen nodded and continued, \u201cI would like to buy 50 Energy Pills and 30 Refining Powder. Is there enough stock in your Qingxuan Pavilion?\u201dMo Hanlin was shocked and thought.\u00a0\u201cWhat a big order. Only a great family would buy so much practicing resources at once. It is rare to see just one warrior buy so many Pills.\u201dBoth Energy Pills and Refining Powder were expensive, thus ordinary warriors could not afford them.The shopkeeper said, \u201cIf you were to go to other stores, you might not get so many Pills. But our Qingxuan Pavilion happens to have enough Energy Pills and Refining Powder to meet your needs.\u201dMo Hanlin took out an abacus to calculate how much Zhang Ruochen should pay and then he said, \u201c50 Energy Pills and 30 Refining Powder cost 80,000 silver coins.\u201d \u201cBut because you are buying so much at once, I will sell it to you at a discount. You just need to pay 72,000 silver coins.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cYou\u2019re so straightforward that I\u2019ll buy the Pills in your store from now on.\u201dZhang Ruochen did not have enough money with him to pay such a large sum at the moment, so he went to the Martial Market Bank to withdraw 200,000 silver coins.After spending 72,000 silver coins, now he had a total of 135,000 silver coins with the silver coins that he had left.After completing this big deal, a huge grin came over Mo Hanlin\u2019s face, and he asked, \u201cMr. Zhang, would you like to buy anything else?\u201dZhang Ruochen replied. \u201cI\u2019m certain that there\u2019s nothing that I want to buy.\u201dMo Hanlin asked, \u201cDo you want to buy a handy weapon?\u201dZhang Ruochen thought that the shopkeeper was formidable and said, \u201cYou have a very keen judgment.\u201dMo Hanlin smiled and said, \u201cAs a shopkeeper for several decades, I have seen thousands of warriors, but the warriors who don\u2019t have weapons are few. We have a branch in the Weapon Market, let me ask a fellow to show you the way.\u201dAfter a while, Mo Hanlin found a fat boy, about 15 or 16, and said, \u201cHan Zi, show Mr. Zhang the way to the Weapon Market and tell the hostess to give a discount to our distinguished guest.\u201dHai Zi vigorously shook his head with his eyes opened wide and said, \u201cNo! No! I don\u2019t want to visit that hostess who can seduce a man\u2019s soul. I will be going to my death if I see her.\u201dMo Hanlin got angry and scolded him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a man, you\u2019re just a little boy, what are you scared of? If you don\u2019t go, you won\u2019t get any Energy Pill this month.\u201dHan Zi got nervous and repeatedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that, I will go, I will go.\u201dHan Zi walked over to Zhang Ruochen and respectfully said, \u201cPlease follow me, Mr. Zhang.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded his head and followed Han Zi toward the Weapon Market.Zhang Ruochen thought that the shopkeeper of Qingxuan Pavilion was a little weird and looked like an extraordinary person. Of course, he did not worry that the old man would hurt him. After all, there were army guards and strict management in the Martial Market. No one dared to cause trouble.Han Zi whispered, \u201cMr. Zhang, will you really buy weapons in the hostess\u2019s store? The hostess can seduce a man\u2019s soul. Mr. Zhang, are you a man?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 I am also just a boy,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.With immense relief, Han Zi said, \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dHan Zi looked white and fat, with protruding ears and plaited hair. His eyes were as small as soybeans.Zhang Ruochen felt curious and asked, \u201cYou said that the hostess can seduce man\u2019s soul, so is she pretty?\u201dHan Zi nodded and said, \u201cThe Hostess is a great beauty, she\u2019s very sexy and charming. Only one look from her can make a man\u2019s hearts beat faster. What\u2019s more, you will blush at your first sight of her. But she has married seven husbands.\u201d\u201cSeven husbands?\u201d Zhang Ruochen was shocked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHai Zi continued, \u201cYes, but each of the seven husbands died on their wedding nights.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWho inherited their property after they died?\u201d\u201cThe hostess, of course, inherited their property. Our shopkeeper is just an employee.\u201dHan Zi whispered, \u201cThe hostess is born to be alone. She must be the reincarnation of a soul bringer and fox. Once a man sees her, it\u2019s hard for him to live for even three days. Luckily, we are just boys, so she can\u2019t seduce our souls.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cI hope so.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She said, \u201cChief, a customer introduced by Mo Hanlin hopes that you can see him in person.\u201dA woman in a red, phoenix-embroidered gown was sitting in the center of the pavilion. Her hair was combed high with three golden hairpins. Her bright eyes, red lips, smooth skin, and plump breasts could be vaguely seen through the light veils.She was about 27 or 28, with hints of attraction leaking out of every part of her body.She was the hostess of Qingxuan Pavilion, Qin Ya.Qin Ya rolled her eyes and smiled. She said, \u201cA customer introduced by Mo Hanlin? I bet he\u2019s another presbyter from some kind of suzerain, or another host from who-knows-what family. Forget it! I\u2019m rather tired today.\u201dThe maid shook her head and said, \u201cNo. He\u2019s only a young man, about 16 or 17.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dQin Ya was a little surprised, and she said, \u201cMo Hanlin has always been a reliable person.

She said, \u201cInteresting! All of a sudden I\u2019m not tired anymore. Let\u2019s go and take a look at that boy! Haha!\u201dZhang Ruochen sat in the VIP room and waited patiently, holding a colored glaze teacup. He looked very calm.Han Zi sat on a chair casually and swallowed the tea, he even drank the tea leaves. He kept praising the tea while drinking it.A moment later, they heard footsteps.Then, Qin Ya and two maids walked inside.Han Zi put down his cup immediately and jumped up from his chair, just like a rat upon seeing a cat. He saluted Qin Ya with the utmost respect and said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to see you, hostess.\u201dQin Ya directly passed by Han Zi and stared at Zhang Ruochen. The young man sat there with a calmness that did not belong to a person of his age.Meanwhile, Zhang Ruochen also looked at Qin Ya. He was somewhat astonished by her beauty as well. What a pretty and coquettish woman! If she tried to lure men, nine out of 10 might surrender.Fortunately, Zhang Ruochen had a strong Spiritual Power, which helped him to resist the lure to a large extent. He said directly, \u201cI\u2019m here to buy a weapon. Please take me to your warehouse.\u201dQin Ya walked over to Zhang Ruochen one step at a time. Her breasts shook with each step she took. The scene was too sexy to look at.She smiled prettily and said, \u201cMaster Zhang, you need to tell me what kind of weapon that you desire, so I can prepare it for you, right?\u201d\u201cA sword! It\u2019d better be a sword of Genuine Martial Arms!\u201d Zhang Ruochen smelled a dimly discernible fragrance, so light and so attractive. It was Qin Ya\u2019s body scent.The fragrance was very tempting and fantasy-arousing. It was, however, not vulgar at all.\u201cWhat an attractive siren!\u201dIt was Qin Ya\u2019s first time seeing a man stay calm in front of her.\u00a0\u201cHe was only a teenager! Shouldn\u2019t the teenagers have the weakest temperament and be the easiest to lure?\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes were bright and clear, without any libidinous looks in them.\u201cThat explains why Mo Hanlin wanted me to meet him in person. He\u2019s extraordinary. Other boys\u2019 Spiritual Power can never compare with his.\u201dQin Ya nodded. Now Zhang Ruochen interested her even more. She said with a smile, \u201cThere are a lot of swords of the Genuine Martial Arms in my warehouse. Since you are the respected guest here, I\u2019ll show you there myself.\u201dStanding behind Qin Ya, the heavy boy, Han Zi, shook his head fiercely at Zhang Ruochen. It seemed that he wanted to say: Hey man, never go to the warehouse alone with the hostess! She\u2019ll eat you up!Certainly, Zhang Ruochen noticed Han Zi\u2019s expression. He thought for a while and said, \u201cOkay. Thank you so much, hostess. Please lead the way!\u201dQin Ya\u2019s breasts were very plump, and her waist was as slim as a willow branch. When she was walking in front of Zhang Ruochen with her butt moving, her body outlined a beautiful curve. Her hair fell on her back like a black waterfall, flowing with her movement. Whenever she made a step, her beautiful plump butt would tilt up a little bit.Merely a view of her backside would make it impossible for others to move their eyes away from her.No wonder Han Zi was so afraid of her.Men loved a woman like her if she was gentle. Yet, men were afraid of a woman like her if she was not.But how could a woman like her, who had brought seven husbands to their deaths and held a huge amount of fortune in the Martial Market, be gentle?Zhang Ruochen tried his best not to look at her.\u201cGood day, hostess!\u201dOutside the warehouse, two rows of guards immediately fell on one knee with their eyes gazing at the ground, not daring to even look at Qin Ya.They were all in fear and trepidation, as if the woman in front of them was not a beauty, but a soul bringer.Qin Ya and Zhang Ruochen entered the warehouse, while all the others were left outside.Seeing Zhang Ruochen follow Qin Ya in, Han Zi shook his head and sighed, because he could already predict Zhang Ruochen\u2019s fate.Up to now, there had not been even one man that had left the warehouse with his body intact if he had followed the hostess inside alone.Some had their hands chopped off, some were castrated, some had their eyes gouged out, and some even lost their heads!The hostess never intended to hurt them. However, they just could not hold back their desires and had tried to rape her.In fact, it was the hostess who was the victim in the very first place. She had to rise up and teach them a lesson.Due to that, those who had gotten wounded did not dare to make it public.For respected people like them, it would be a huge disgrace once such things were disclosed.Qingxuan Pavilion\u2019s weapons warehouse was very big and was divided into a sword room, blade room, spear room, mace room, axe room\u2026 Among them, the sword room was the biggest.Because, in Yunwu Commandery, most warriors preferred swords as weapons.The weapons were divided into normal weapons and Genuine Martial Arms.The normal weapons were used by ordinary people.The Genuine Martial Arms were the weapons for the warriors. Only a warrior could bring out the real power of a Genuine Martial Arm.The Genuine Martial Arms could be divided into nine levels based on their materials and the inscription numbers.The first-level Genuine Martial Arms were the lowest.The ninth-level Genuine Martial Arms were the highest.The moment that Zhang Ruochen entered the sword room, he felt a strange wave, which came from a broken sword in the corner.The broken sword was about a hand\u2019s width. Although the sword tip was broken, it still had a length of about four feet.The sword looked plain and even had some rusty spots on it.\u201cAby\u2026 ss\u2026\u201dThe moment Zhang Ruochen saw that sword, he was astonished. Then he quickly walked over to it.Qin Ya smiled and said, \u201cMaster Zhang, what a good taste! That\u2019s a sword with 1,000 years\u2019 history. It\u2019s extremely heavy but incredibly sharp. The material is also very special. No one can tell what it is made of.\u201d\u201cIt would be at least a seventh-level Genuine Martial Arm if it was not broken.\u201d\u201cWhat a waste! A good sword like this\u2026 It was broken, along with the inscription inside. Now, except for its sharpness, it has no value. But if you are interested, I can give it to you at the first-level Genuine Martial Arm\u2019s price.\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201dZhang Ruochen slowly picked the extremely heavy sword up and held it in his hand. He gently wiped the rust on the handle off. Beneath the rust, the ancient characters \u201cAbyss\u201d appeared.The Abyss Ancient Sword.Qin Ya discovered that Zhang Ruochen liked that broken sword very much, and felt a little regret. A first-level Genuine Martial Arm could only be sold for 500 silver coins at most, which was even cheaper than a single Energy Pill.\u201c1,000 silver coins.\u201dShe raised the price a lot.\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen simply.Even if it had cost 10,000,000 silver coins, Zhang Ruochen would have still bought it, let alone 1,000 silver coins.Because this was his sword 800 years ago.It was the sword that had been sent to him as a present from Princess Chi Yao, who was Empress Chi Yao now.\u201cWhen the warrior dies, the sword dies along with him. Now, since I have been reborn, it\u2019s time for the sword to be reborn as well! Abyss, I\u2019ll let your radiance return to this era!\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen softly touched the Abyss Ancient Sword with his eyes blurred, so soft like he was touching his lover.This was the predestined relationship between swords and men!Qin Ya became speechless.\u00a0\u201cIs Zhang Ruochen really a man?\u201d\u00a0He was staying with a peerless beauty alone in a warehouse, yet he only wanted to hold that broken sword tightly.Was that broken sword prettier than her?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAny other man would have pounced on her if they had been alone with her in this warehouse.Although Qin Ya hated those men so much that she wounded them without a second thought, she still liked to see men going crazy and turning into a goat because of her.She enjoyed seducing them first, and then wounded them mercilessly to wake them up and drown them in a tearless state.But now, this Zhang Ruochen would not even look at her!Any woman as beautiful as she would not be resigned to this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her body almost stuck to him, giving off a charming fragrance.Zhang Ruochen recovered from the thoughts of his previous life. The moment that he raised his head, he saw a large patch of white skin on Qin Ya\u2019s chest. Although she was wearing her clothes properly, it still seemed very enchanting.He immediately closed his eyes and held his breath a bit. His heart was pounding. He pinched his fingertips at once and forced himself to look at the sword on the wall.Pulling himself together, Zhang Ruochen pointed at a royal blue sword and asked, \u201cHostess, which level of Genuine Martial Arms is this sword?\u201dQin Ya looked a little disappointed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fourth-level Genuine Martial Arm called the Flash Shining Sword. There are 14 inscriptions on it: four Inscriptions of Power, four Inscriptions of Ice, four Inscriptions of Electricity, and two Inscriptions of Light. In other words, it has three special attributes: ice series, electricity series, and light series.\u201dGenerally speaking, there would only be one inscription on a first-level Genuine Martial Arm.Only swords with over 10 inscriptions could be considered fourth-level Genuine Martial Arms.Whenever an inscription was added, specific powers would be added to an extent. The more interesting thing was that according to the different nature of the inscriptions, the Genuine Martial Arms would have different properties that suited individual warriors.For example, a warrior with the Blaze Sacred Mark had a blast of flame gas in their Genuine Qi. Thus, when they used the fire series of Genuine Martial Arm, they could unleash a stronger power of the arm.\u201cHow much?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.\u201c30,000 silver coins,\u201d Qin Ya said.\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll take it,\u201d he excitedly said.Zhang Ruochen took the Flash Shining Sword in one hand and the Abyss Ancient Sword in the other and quickly fled out of the armory.Staying alone with that enchanting hostess was too dangerous, even for Zhang Ruochen.After all, he had found the Abyss Ancient Sword and bought a random Genuine Martial Arm, which was all that he needed.\u201cWhat a quick getaway\u2026 Haha! But, it won\u2019t be that easy to run away from me again! The future will be interesting when we meet again.\u201d\u00a0Qin Ya smiled. She became even more interested in Zhang Ruochen.\u2026When Zhang Ruochen and Qin Ya had entered the weapons warehouse before, there was a man and a woman led by an old shopkeeper from Qingxuan Pavilion approaching the warehouse\u2019s doorway.They seemed quite respected, even the old shopkeeper had to bow and smile with flattery.The young man was Zhang Ruochen\u2019s eighth brother, the Eighth Prince of the Yunwu Commandery, Zhang Ji.The young woman with Zhang Ji was one of the four young beauties of the Yunwu Commandery, Master of the Red Cloud Sect\u2019s daughter, Shan Xiangling.Shan Xiangling\u2019s temperament was outstanding, as pure and fresh as a lily. She was about 16 or 17, with bright eyes and a nice figure. Wherever she went, she was the most attractive girl.The Eighth Prince smiled and said, \u201cMy mother told me that this is your first time to Yunwu City, so I must take good care of you. Qingxuan Pavilion is one of the biggest shops in the Martial Market. My junior sister apprentice, if you take a fancy to any weapon, do let me know.\u201dThe Eighth Prince\u2019s mother, Concubine Xiao, was a student of the Red Cloud Sect. She was also the junior sister apprentice of Master of the Red Cloud Sect.Therefore, the Eighth Prince called Shan Xiangling his junior sister apprentice as well.Shan Xiangling gently smiled and said, \u201cThank you! However, the main purpose of my time in Yunwu City is to meet some geniuses, especially the top genius, the Seventh Prince. I have heard about him many times and greatly admire him, like many other girls in the Red Cloud Sect. But it\u2019s so hard to even catch a glimpse of him.\u201dThe Eighth Prince said, \u201cIf he was here, I could introduce you to him. Unfortunately, my seventh brother is not currently in Yunwu City.\u201dShan Xiangling looked a little disappointed and said, \u201cIf I remember correctly, the Year-end Assessment is the second biggest pageant after the Ceremony of Worship. Won\u2019t the Seventh Prince be here for the pageant?\u201dThe Eighth Prince laughed and said, \u201cMy seventh brother already got first place in the Year-end Assessment when he was only 10 years old. It doesn\u2019t make sense for him now. However, the Year-end Assessment is a big competition, where only young men from the Royal Family and noble families who are under 20 are allowed to participate. Perhaps my seventh brother will come back. If you want to watch it, I can get you a ticket.\u201d\u201cThank you again,\u201d said Shan Xiangling with a smile.While the Eighth Prince and Shan Xiangling were talking, the old shopkeeper walked up to Han Zi and asked, \u201cHan Zi, who is in the warehouse now? Why is the gate closed?\u201dHan Zi gave him a strange look and whispered, \u201cThe hostess and a young man.\u201dHearing this, the old shopkeeper gasped in astonishment and said to himself, \u201cOh, the hostess\u2026 don\u2019t make anyone die!\u201dThe Eighth Prince and Shan Xiangling also heard what the shopkeeper said.In an astonished voice, Shan Xiangling asked the shopkeeper, \u201cDoes the hostess here kill customers for money?\u201dThe Eighth Prince shook his head and said, \u201cNo! There are just some rumors about the hostess. Rumor has it that the hostess is so extremely beautiful that any man seeing her will fall for her.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also hearsay that the hostess is cruel and merciless. Many men have died by her hands.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s said that she is very licentious and had kept many men. She is also a sadist. Many men had their hands cut off and their eyes gouged out.\u201d\u201cOf course, these are all rumors. I\u2019ve never seen her in person, so it\u2019s hard for me to say what kind of woman she is.\u201d He concluded.After hearing this, Shan Xiangling had a bad impression of the hostess.Everybody could assume what was happening after a woman led a man into the armory in broad daylight with the gate closed.The hostess was definitely not a decent woman and the man with her also had to be disgusting.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe gate was pushed open and Zhang Ruochen came out with two swords in his hands. He was quite surprised seeing his brother, Zhang Ji, in the distance.The Eighth Prince was also surprised to see Zhang Ruochen, but his eyes immediately turned cold and he reprimanded him. \u201cMy ninth brother, what are you doing here? This is not a place that you should come!\u201dHaving heard the Eighth Prince address Zhang Ruochen as his brother, Han Zi and the old shopkeeper were astonished that Master Zhang really did have a great background. Unexpectedly, he was the son of the Yunwu Commandery Prince!At the same time, they were relieved that the hostess had not hurt him. If the Ninth Prince had gotten hurt here, Qingxuan Pavilion would most likely have been shut down the very next day.Shan Xiangling had also heard of the Ninth Prince. It was said that he was the only prince who had not obtained his Sacred Mark.She did not deliberately get to know Zhang Ruochen, so she had no idea that Zhang Ruochen had opened his Sacred Mark half a month ago.\u201cHow could a loser like him walk out of the armory?\u201d\u00a0Shan Xiangling thought.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dWith consideration of what the Eighth Prince said, she looked at Zhang Ruochen again with contempt.Zhang Ruochen frowned and said with displeasure, \u201cSince you can come to Qingxuan Pavilion, why can\u2019t I?\u201dThe Eighth Prince sneered and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to buy weapons. What are you doing here? Can you afford a Genuine Martial Arm? How did you get those two swords?\u201dZhang Ruochen was baffled by his attitude and rudely said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business! Even if I picked them up on the side of the road, it\u2019s still none of your business.\u201dThe Eighth Prince shouted, \u201cStop! You should stay in the palace and behave yourself since you\u2019re a loser without any talent. Don\u2019t come here and shame the family or I\u2019ll break your legs for my father.\u201dZhang Ruochen was even more confused. He asked in a low voice, \u201cAre you even capable of doing that?\u201dThe Eighth Prince burst out laughing.He put his palms together and stretched his 10 fingers. The Eighth Prince then chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what my capability is today!\u201dZhang Ruochen stood there calmly. He pressed his five fingers together and moved his Genuine Qi through his six Meridians.He scoffed. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fight, then let\u2019s fight!\u201dQin Ya stepped out. \u201cOh! Your Highness! What are you doing? This is Qingxuan Pavilion, it\u2019s not an appropriate place to fight. The Ninth Prince is my distinguished guest, so I must step in if you challenge him here,\u201d Qin Ya said with an enchanting smile on her face.Upon seeing Qin Ya, the Eighth Prince was taken aback by her beauty.He would have lost his mind if Shan Xiangling was not here. Seeing an enchanting beauty like Qin Ya, it was impossible for him to keep calm.The Eighth Prince looked away from Qin Ya and stared at Zhang Ruochen. He yelled. \u201cYou are such a disgrace to our family!\u201dIn the Eighth Prince\u2019s opinion, Zhang Ruochen could never afford any Genuine Martial Arms. The only way he could get them was to be the hostess\u2019s secret lover.He was exchanging his body for resources to practice Martial Arts.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn fact, Shan Xiangling shared the same opinion with the Eighth Prince.\u201cWhat a shame! As the son of the Yunwu Commandery Prince, the Seventh Prince is a top genius while the Ninth Prince is a woman\u2019s lover! What a contrast!\u201d\u00a0Shan Xiangling stared at Zhang Ruochen as she shook her head with a sigh.Zhang Ruochen had no idea what his brother was talking about. He decided not to pay any attention to him because he had done nothing indecent. Holding his two swords, he walked outside.Qin Ya was a very clever woman, so she could somehow tell what the Eighth Prince and Shan Xiangling were insinuating.She cunningly smiled and said, \u201cYour Highness, Ninth Prince, if you come here again, I\u2019ll treat you well! If you want any other practice resources, just come by and tell me. Hehe!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He paid 31,000 silver coins for these two swords and then went back to palace.While walking in Ziyi Side Hall, Zhang Ruochen found that the courtyard was entirely covered in white snow.A strange sense of emotion came into his mind as he was holding the four-foot-long broken sword.\u201c800 years have passed. The world is changing all the time for both humans and everything else. I had never thought that the once sharpest Abyss Ancient Sword would also be broken apart.\u201dThe Abyss Ancient Sword, though broken apart, was still far too heavy for Zhang Ruochen. If he had not reached the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm, he might not have even been able to pick it up.\u201cThe sword\u2019s inscriptions were all broken without exception. It\u2019s currently only sharper than other swords. If I want to reconnect these inscriptions and regain its full power, I will have to enlist weapon refiners of at least the fifth rank. But are there any weapon refiners of the fifth rank in the Yunwu Commandery?\u201dZhang Ruochen put his swords away.Even if the Abyss Ancient Sword became a piece of scrap iron, Zhang Ruochen would still bring it along as it could always remind him of the past and motivate him to practice harder. Only when he became strong enough would he be able to get revenge on Empress Chi Yao.Zhang Ruochen took out the Flash Shining Sword, one of the fourth-level Genuine Martial Arms. He gripped the hilt and pulled out the sword from its sheath. A blue and crystal sword body appeared.Zhang Ruochen began to mobilize his Genuine Qi and injected it into the sword body of Flash Shining Sword through his palm.Activated by Genuine Qi, the first inscription quickly recovered.It was an inscription of Power Series! Once it was stimulated by Genuine Qi, it would gain 100 pounds in weight.It weighed 53 pounds originally. But now its weight had increased to 153 pounds after the first Inscription of Power Series was recovered.Such a big increase in weight!His arm trembled slightly as he tried to maintain his posture.\u201cClang!\u201dHe thrust out the sword.However, the sword\u2019s direction was not accurate and it was too hard to control.With his present cultivation, Zhang Ruochen could give out a power like that of one Brute Bull by displaying the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm. He could even throw a 300-pound stone tray 10 meters away.Nevertheless, that was one burst of his power in just one moment!Providing it was a 300-pound sword, Zhang Ruochen could not necessarily lift it up with his present cultivation, let alone demonstrate masterful sword skill.A sword that was 153 pounds was his maximum limit.\u201cWham!\u201d\u201cChop!\u201d\u2026Zhang Ruochen spent his whole afternoon practicing the Flash Shining Sword. Eventually, he began to adjust to its weight.Certainly, it was just a preliminary adaptation!Those Martial Arts masters could stab mosquitoes within 10 meters with great ease. With superb sword techniques, they had already attained the realm of Sword Following the Heart.Zhang Ruochen found himself lagging far behind those masters. Compared with them, he was too clumsy to use this heavy sword.\u201cThere are four Inscriptions of Power Series on the Flash Shinning Sword. Its weight increased to 153 pounds after the first Inscription of Power Series was activated. I can\u2019t imagine how heavy it would be if I stimulated the second inscription.\u201dZhang Ruochen started to mobilize his Genuine Qi and kept injecting it into the second inscription of Power Series.As his Genuine Qi became thinner and thinner, the second inscription of Power Series had not changed at all and showed no sign of any recovery.Zhang Ruochen had to give up.\u201cWith my current Genuine Qi level in my body, I can\u2019t activate the second inscription. It seems that my cultivation is still not powerful enough!\u201dZhang Ruochen withdrew his Genuine Qi from the sword body. Then the Flash Shining Sword immediately became 53 pounds again. Having adapted to the weight of 153 pounds, Zhang Ruochen found it really light to hold.Whereafter, Zhang Ruochen injected Genuine Qi into the Flash Shining Sword again and succeeded in stimulating one Inscription of Ice Series.As the Flash Shining Sword emitted a rush of icing air, his fingers became numb.\u201cThump!\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen swung his sword, some crystal snowflakes came out of the edge of the Flash Shining Sword. That was because small drops of water in the air were clotted into granular snow by Sword Breath.\u201cInscription of Electricity Series!\u201d\u201cInscription of Light Series!\u201dZhang Ruochen continued his attempt to stimulate another Inscription of Electricity Series and Inscription of Light Series.After the Inscription of Electricity Series was activated, a wisp of an electric wire arose on the surface. He thrust out the sword. It looked like a flash of lightning cleaving the sky with a \u201cThwack!\u201d sound.The Flash Shining Sword was enveloped in a white haze and became extremely sharp when Zhang Ruochen succeeded in stimulating the Inscription of Light Series. With white light flashing, the stone cracked instantly.His present Genuine Qi could only sustain one inscription. If he employed the power of the Inscription of Power Series, the power of other three inscriptions would be unusable.\u201cI need to practice harder to improve my cultivation if I want to activate two inscriptions simultaneously.\u201d\u201c30,000 silver coins is worthwhile!\u201dZhang Ruochen withdrew his Flash Shining Sword back into its sheath.\u201cOnly when a total of 14 inscriptions are all stimulated will the power of the fourth-level Genuine Martial Arm be brought out completely. I need to intensify my practice!\u201dZhang Ruochen swallowed an Energy Pill at once and started to practice after entering into the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Energy Pill exploded inside his body, turning into a cloud of Pill Spirit.Six Meridians carried Pill Spirit promptly and soon it was transformed into Genuine Qi within his Qi Pool.It took half a day for Zhang Ruochen to absorb and refine all of the Pill Spirit.Only half of the Pill Spirit was assimilated and converted to Genuine Qi.The other half of the Pill Spirit was wasted as it escaped through his pores.If this had happened to other warriors, they would have been distressed greatly. After all, half of a Pill Spirit cloud was equivalent to 500 silver coins.Conversely, Zhang Ruochen did not think it was a waste of money because he felt that his Genuine Qi had greatly increased. If he had practiced progressively, it would have taken over 10 days to reach his present status.However, it took only half a day for Zhang Ruochen to achieve the desired effect with the help of an Energy Pill.\u201c1,000 silver coins don\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cMoney can be earned if I need more silver coins.\u201d\u201cBut lost time is never found again.\u201dOver the following days, Zhang Ruochen spent most of his time practicing inside the Time and Space Spinel.He took Energy Pills to expand his Genuine Qi and utilized Refining Powder to refine his body.Beyond that, he also spent most of his hours practicing the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm and the Sacred Sword Skill.After the first month of practice in the Time and Space Spinel, his Genuine Qi in his Qi Pool had quintupled.The second month passed and Zhang Ruochen could give a quick burst of the Strength of Two Bulls.After the third month, his Genuine Qi in his Qi Pool was tenfold as much as what he had in the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. He completed the practice of his Genuine Qi and attained the limit of advanced stage of the Yellow Realm.At this time, Zhang Ruochen could have opened up new Meridians and strive for the next realm, the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm.Instead, Zhang Ruochen chose to restrain his cultivation and kept using Refining Powder to refine his body.\u201cConsidering my present physical quality, I need to open up another four Meridians if I want to reach the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. Specifically, there will be 10 Meridians inside when I arrive at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm.\u201dThose warriors who practiced the exercises of the Inferior-Class of the Human Stage could only open up seven Meridians in their body. It was the same with warriors in the Yellow Realm Completion.Anyone who had the capacity to open up 10 Meridians at only the level of the Dawn State was absolutely a genius.Zhang Ruochen was still ungratified.In his last lifetime, he had opened up as many as 13 meridians when he was at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm.\u201cAlthough my present physical quality could not compare with that of my last lifetime, I still believe that I can succeed in opening up 11 channels at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm if I exert myself to refine my body.\u201dThe Time and Space Spinel, which could make his practicing time three times longer than others\u2019, was his biggest advantage at present. Given this, he should naturally make full use of his time to improve himself and become more outstanding than his last lifetime.The fourth month passed by. Tremendous changes took place in his physical quality and he could now give a quick burst of the Strength of Three Bulls by displaying the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Fist.Six months later, his strength increased sharply to Strength of Four Bulls.Reaching his carnal limit, Zhang Ruochen discovered that bottlenecks constrained his physical quality and it was extremely tough to improve.He would be unable to enhance his power to Strength of Five Bulls, even if he practiced for another year.Practicing within the Time and Space Spiritual Crystal for half a year was equivalent to two months outside.\u201cThose who could give a burst of one Brute Bull at advanced stage of the Yellow Realm are considered as strong as Medium- and Superior-Class warriors. Only warriors at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm could practice Strength of Four Bulls.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI could give a burst of Strength of Four Bulls only with the cultivation of advanced stage of the Yellow Realm, which enables me to contend against normal warriors at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. If I enter into the next realm, the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, how powerful will I become?\u201d\u201cHaving reached my physical limit, I could start practicing for the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. How many Meridians could I open up? I have no idea.\u201dIn case of any special conditions, Zhang Ruochen took out a total of six small jade bottles filled with Marrow-washing Liquid, putting them in front of himself neatly.\u201cI\u2019ll try my best! The more Meridians that I open up, the more powerful I\u2019ll become in physical quality and fighting capacity. Come on!\u201dZhang Ruochen grabbed the first jade bottle, drank the Marrow-washing Liquid, and started to open up the seventh Meridian immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was exhausted, and his body was covered with sweat. It consumed 90% of his Genuine Qi.When he managed to open up the 11th Meridian, his body wobbled slightly.A thud came from inside his glabella.\u201cBoom!\u201dHe had reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm!The capacity of his Qi Pool was immediately increased tenfold. Right now, the pool was around 25 square meters, which was almost as large as a real pond.Genuine Qi traveled quickly inside the Qi Pool, forming a thin layer of mist.\u201cAs expected, this body is too weak. I must enhance my physical quality, otherwise, the most I can achieve is to open up 11 Meridians in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm.\u201dIf other warriors knew what Zhang Ruochen was thinking, they would be depressed about their Martial Arts.Above all, those who could open up six Meridians at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm were considered geniuses.Those who could open up eight Meridians were top geniuses.If someone could open up 10 meridians, then for sure, that person was a heathen in others\u2019 eyes, who would be admired by other warriors in the same realm.The Seventh Prince was famous because he had opened up 10 Meridians in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. He was the strongest in his realm and was a big hero in the Yunwu Commandery, making other geniuses look normal.The Seventh Prince had been the first and the only person in the Yunwu Commandery that could open up 10 Meridians in the Dawn State in hundreds of years.Of course, right now Zhang Ruochen was the second!\u201cAnyway, I finally made it! But at what level is my power now?\u201dZhang Ruochen cleansed his body thoroughly and found a blue robe to wear before walking out of his room.He planned to find a place where no one was around in order to test his power.The Manor of the Yunwu Commandery was built around three mountains, Jun Mountain, King Mountain, and Emperor Mountain. Apart from the palaces, which were built close to each other, there were some quiet parks and basins.Zhang Ruochen and his mother, Concubine Lin, were living in the Ziyi Side Hall, which was equivalent to a cold palace. This palace was quite far from those main ones.Outside the Ziyi Side Hall, there was a snow-covered jungle. Beyond the jungle, there sat one of the three largest mountains inside the manor, Jun Mountain.After arriving at the foot of Jun Mountain, it was hard to find a single maidservant or eunuch, or even a royal security guard.\u201cHere it is!\u201dZhang Ruochen stood there and began to test his power.Zhang Ruochen bent both of his knees slightly and assumed a \u201cHorse Stance\u201d. In fact, he was much like a giant elephant standing loftily in the snow.He changed the stances quickly, constantly unleashing his power through his handprint. He moved faster and faster.\u201cThe first technique of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Elephant Galloping!\u201dZhang Ruochen stretched his legs, leaving the bones and muscles tightened, and unleashed all the power through his palm onto the stone wall.\u201cBang!\u201dMany breaches suddenly appeared on the stone wall, becoming increasingly wider and deeper.All of a sudden, the five-meter-tall stone wall collapsed.Zhang Ruochen changed his stances and quickly moved back to avoid being hit by the rocks from the wall.\u201cThe power of this hit is equivalent to the Strength of Eight Bulls!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen as he nodded his head gently.For a normal warrior in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, the Strength of Four Bulls was already his maximum.But he had unleashed the Strength of Eight Bulls immediately after reaching the Dawn State, so he was certainly worthy of praise. With the development of his skills, he could surely unleash stronger powers.\u201cNow let me try my sword techniques!\u201dZhang Ruochen reached in and took out the Flash Shinning Sword from the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel. He held the blade and charged it with his Genuine Qi.\u201cCrash!\u201dThe first inscription, the Inscription of Power Series, was activated now. This led to the increase of the weight of the Flash Shinning Sword, which was 153 pounds now.Then, the second inscription, the Inscription of Ice Series, was activated as well. A blast of icy air was released from the blade, making the air around it a bit colder.With the current skill level of Zhang Ruochen, activating two inscriptions was already his limit.Over the past half year, Zhang Ruochen had spent much time practicing the Sacred Sword Skill and the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, rather than on improving his physique only.Exercises, physique, and martial techniques\u2014each of them was a must.The Sacred Sword Skill, which was part of the Low-Class of Spiritual, consisted of 12 sword techniques.Unlike those Human Stage sword techniques, each one move of that sword technique was subtle and ingenious, with great variations.If warriors in the Yellow Realm would like to fully acquire the Sacred Sword Skill, a great deal of time had to be dedicated. It could take them several months of hard work before practicing even just one move of the sword technique.Even for Zhang Ruochen, who had practiced the Sacred Sword Skill before, it took half a year to get three of the sword techniques.Now the Flash Shinning Sword, which was 153 pounds, was held in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand. However, the sword seemed to be weightless to Zhang Ruochen now. He was amazingly skilled and relaxed when using this sword, as if he was just naturally stretching his arms or legs.He was so skilled at using his sword that it moved the moment he wanted to move his arm in his mind.\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen lifted his right arm and waved the sword.Within a second, a loud sound along with that of the wind was heard by Zhang Ruochen. Meanwhile, he saw a blast of Sword Breath flying out.\u201cCrash!\u201dA seven-meter-long, three-inch-deep icy cold sword mark was left on the ground. Grasses and rocks nearby were destroyed by the Sword Breath and the scar.It was like a sword path!\u201cSacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his arm and waved the sword!The Flash Shinning Sword was turned into a blue light shuttle with seven phantoms. Those seven sounds were like seven swords flying out to stab the enemy.The sound from the seven sword shadows touched the sword tip on the stone wall, causing some \u201cDing, Ding!\u201d sounds.Seven tiny holes, caused by sword tips, were left on the stone wall and displayed a plum blossom.Sacred Breaking Plum Sword\u2014Virtually, it was not about plums, but the glabella.Once this technique was used, seven tiny holes would be left on the enemy\u2019s glabella, which would look like a bloody plum blossom.Only when one whose Sword Comprehension had practiced to the level of Sword Following the Heart could this person finally get the Sacred Breaking Plum Sword.The Realm of Sword Comprehension could be divided into three levels: Sword Following the Heart, Heart Integrated into Sword, and Human Sword.Zhang Ruochen was now in the realm of Sword Following the Heart, which was not far away from the Heart Integrated into Sword level.Apart from the Sacred Guiding Sword and the Sacred Breaking Plum Sword, Zhang Ruochen also practiced one move defensive sword technique, the \u201cSacred Bell Sword\u201d!\u201cSacred Bell Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen continuously charged the Genuine Qi into the Flash Shining Sword. The Sword Breath was moving fast, so he used the sword to guide it to form an illusory image of a light blue bell. This illusory image was spinning quickly and parceled Zhang Ruochen, protecting him from the Bell Sword.Once Zhang Ruochen used this one move, he could be protected from a big hit from the enemy, even if the enemy was a warrior in the Final State of the Yellow Realm. However, if the same enemy practiced the sword techniques at the level of the Spiritual Stage, he could defeat Zhang Ruochen as usual.Sacred Guiding Sword!Sacred Breaking Plum Sword!Sacred Bell Sword!Zhang Ruochen was continuously practicing these three sword techniques in order to reach the \u201cHeart Integrated into Sword\u201d. However, he knew it would be impossible to reach that level in a short period of time.Zhang Ruochen went back to the Ziyi Side Hall after he had exhausted his Genuine Qi.\u201cIn 13 days, we will have our Year-end Assessment. I must further cultivate my skills.\u201dZhang Ruochen sat inside the Mystery of Time and Space with his legs crossed. He ate another Energy Pill before practicing again.As the Year-end Assessment was approaching, all the princes and princesses of the Yunwu Commandery were busy practicing. Each one of them was eager to excel and be respected by all the people.Only scions of the Royal Family or the noble families who were below 20 years old were eligible for the Year-end Assessment. The assessment was for enhancing youths\u2019 motivation and making them more competent.In previous years, Zhang Ruochen was banned from attending the Year-end Assessment, thus, he could only stand in the crowd. Of course, that was an embarrassing moment for both he and Concubine Lin.This year, it could be different.When Zhang Ruochen was making progress, others were also improving themselves.The Jade Palace had belonged to Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin, but now it was for the Eighth Prince Zhang Ji and his mother, Concubine Xiao. Inside a luxurious room of the Jade Palace, Zhang Ji was laughing loudly. \u201cAhahaha! I finally reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm!\u201dA hint of satisfaction played on Concubine Xiao\u2019s face, she said proudly, \u201cGood job, Ji! With your current skill level, although you can\u2019t beat the Fifth Prince or the Sixth Prince, your lord father will surely see your progress and reward your hard work.\u201dZhang Ji nodded. He clearly knew he was far from good enough when compared to these two brothers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Sixth Prince had reached the Peak of the Dawn State at last year\u2019s Year-end Assessment. He could have reached the Medium Stage by now.As for the Fifth Prince, he was even better. It was said that he had reached the Final State.The Eighth Prince smiled coldly and said, \u201cNever mind, there is one who will be at the bottom of the list. He will only make me appear more excellent.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the Ninth Prince? He just obtained the Sacred Mark of Martial Arts, I assume he hasn\u2019t even washed his marrow or broken out of the channels. He won\u2019t be present at the Year-end Assessment,\u201d Concubine Xiao said.\u201cHaha! Whether or not he will be present is not up to him.\u201d A hint of a smile played on Zhang Ji\u2019s face, but it was a cold and disdainful smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then a streak of Sword Breath arose in the air, leaving a seven-meter-long sword path on the ground.A deep crack caused by the sword marred the hard flagstone.\u201cClap, Clap!\u201dWhile walking into the Drill Coliseum, Lin Fengxian applauded and said with a smile, \u201cShan-er, your talent for swordsmanship is really amazing! It took less than three months for you to acquire one move of the sword technique of the Low Class of Spiritual. By virtue of this, you will definitely sweep away all obstacles and become the shiniest one at the Year-end Assessment!\u201dLin Ningshan answered, \u201cI have already practiced to the realm of the Sword Following the Heart. It was my deep understanding of one move of the sword technique practice that accounted for my success in such a short period.\u201dLin Fengxian nodded his head and said, \u201cAcross the entire Yunwu City, there are less than 10 prodigies who have the capacity to practice their Sword Comprehension to the realm of the Sword Following the Heart before their 20s. But, you made it only at 15. Your future is very promising!\u201dLin Ningshan kept on practicing her sword technique after Lin Fengxian left the Martial Arts field.13 days passed quickly.13 days in the Time and Space Spinel was equivalent to 39 days outside.With the help of the Energy Pills, Zhang Ruochen finally attained the Peak of the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm from its Initial Stage. His Genuine Qi Pool was tenfold that of 13 days ago, thus completing his practice again.Now, he could punch and give a burst of Strength of Ten Bulls.If he displayed the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Fist, he could break out the Strength of Sixteen Bulls by enhancement of his martial technique.A normal warrior at the level of the Dawn State could give a burst of the Strength of Four Bulls.For a warrior at the level of the Medium State, he could unleash the Strength of Nine Bulls.And a warrior at the level of the Final State could break out the Strength of Sixteen Bulls.Although Zhang Ruochen was only at the skill level of the Peak of the Dawn State, he could contend against the warriors at the level of the Final State.However, Zhang Ruochen stopped practicing for the next realm, the Medium State. He understood that even if he attained the level of the Medium State, he could only open up 16 Meridians at most.In his last lifetime, he opened up as many as 20 Meridians when he was in the Medium State.\u201cI have to find ways to improve my physique. If I lose at the starting line, how can I ever fight against Empress Chi Yao?\u201dWhile walking out of his room, he saw Yun standing outside the door.\u201cSister Yun-er, is today the date for the Year-end Assessment?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.\u201cRight!\u201dYun nodded her head with a little nervousness and said, \u201cYour Royal Highness, the Ninth Prince, please do take care of yourself! I heard that the Eighth Prince has reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. If he knew you were also a warrior, he would definitely embarrass you on purpose.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. It doesn\u2019t matter so much.\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked with a slight smile, \u201cMother will also show up at the Year-end Assessment, won\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cSure, she will. But, she doesn\u2019t know that you are going to attend the Year-end Assessment,\u201d\u00a0Yun said to herself,\u00a0\u201cIf Concubine Lin knew that the Ninth Prince was already a warrior, she would be very pleased.\u201d\u201cYour Royal Highness Ninth Prince, please let me put the royal boa robe on you. Now, you can go to the Royal Coliseum down King Mount,\u201d Yun said.Then, Zhang Ruochen found that Yun was holding a bronze salver, on which was stacked a suit of gold robes with a Four Claws Huge Python, a cap, one jade belt, and a pair of golden boots.In the Yunwu Commandery, different social classes wore different clothes, and everyone had to obey the rules of clothing strictly. Only the prince could wear a royal boa robe while the princess could wear a royal finch robe.After practicing and refining his body for three months, Zhang Ruochen had already changed into a whole new look. Tremendous changes took place in his somatotype and temperament. He was no longer what he used to be, radiating a heroic spirit of youth.He brimmed over with health and spirits the instant that he put on the royal boa robe and cap. His face was too noble to describe, just like Carps Jumping Over the Dragon Gate and Young Eagle Transforming into Roc.\u201cYour Royal Highness Ninth Prince, you\u2026 you really look more like a prince than any other princes!\u201d Yun stared at Zhang Ruochen with her heart beating continually. With two blushes of red appearing on her cheeks, she could not help being attracted by his temperament.Zhang Ruochen smiled and said, \u201cYun-er, let\u2019s go to the Royal Coliseum!\u201dYun nodded slightly and said, \u201cConcubine Lin set out early to present her respects to His Majesty. We need to hurry up to avoid the gossip from concubines and princes.\u201dThe Royal Coliseum was built beneath King Mount.The Year-end Assessment was a meeting for the Royal Family that ranked only second to the Ceremony of Worship. Even the Yunwu Commandery Prince secluded himself for refining to attend the Year-end Assessment.Before dawn, princes, princesses, and concubines rushed to the Royal Coliseum early enough to wait for the presence of the Yunwu Commandery Prince.With a trimmed mustache, the Yunwu Commandery Prince sat at the highest position of the Martial Arts arena, looking 40 years old. He glanced at those princes and princesses and said with a smile, \u201cThe Seventh Prince doesn\u2019t come back, does he?\u201dThe queen, who was sitting next to the Yunwu Commandery Prince, answered, \u201cYour Majesty, the Seventh Prince sent a letter half a month ago to inform us that he won\u2019t come back, for he has to handle a vital issue. Besides, in light of his martial cultivation, it makes no sense for him to attend the Year-end Assessment!\u201d\u201cThe Seventh Prince\u2019s absence lowers my expectations of this Year-end Assessment.\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince was a little disappointed.Concubine Xiao, the biological mother of the Eighth Prince, stepped forward and said, \u201cYour Majesty, although the Seventh Prince is absent, the Ninth Prince will attend this year.\u201d\u201cOh, is that true? The Ninth Prince?\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince turned his eyes to Concubine Lin.Concubine Xiao said with a smile, \u201cThe Ninth Prince unlocked the Sacred Mark three months ago.\u201d\u201cReally? Haha! Concubine Lin, why didn\u2019t you inform me of this in the first place?\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince was in good mood. After all, the Ninth Prince was his own son and the only prince that had not opened up the Sacred Mark.The Yunwu Commandery Prince was quite pleased since his nine princes had all unlocked the Sacred Mark.Concubine Lin bit her lip and whispered, \u201cI dared not startle you, Your Majesty, as he has only just gotten it.\u201d\u201cIn my eyes, his opening of the Sacred Mark is certainly a thing worthy of our celebration. Even if his future achievement is limited, he is still a warrior stronger than ordinary people. Where is he? Ask him to come see me,\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince replied.\u201cEveryone is here except my ninth brother. Huh! It seems he has changed a lot after opening the Sacred Mark. We all have to wait for him!\u201d The Eighth Prince laughed coldly.At this moment, dressed in a royal boa robe, Zhang Ruochen stepped up along the tall stone steps and said, \u201cMy Eighth Brother, is it really a good thing to say something bad behind my back?\u201dWith an imposing appearance, Zhang Ruochen walked up to the Eighth Prince, giving him a sharp glare.Clenching his fist, the Eighth Prince looked quite furious. How dare Zhang Ruochen speak to him in such a tone? He was so unruly!Zhang Ruochen shook his sleeves and moved forward. When he saw the Yunwu Commandery Prince sitting at the top, he bowed to him and said, \u201cPlease allow me to pay my respects to Your Majesty!\u201dOn hearing what Zhang Ruochen had called the Yunwu Commandery Prince, all those present were shocked by his boldness.There was an air of chill at the meeting. Everyone held their breath and dared not make a sound.\u201cYou called me \u2018Your Majesty\u2019?\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince stared at Zhang Ruochen.The queen snorted and said, \u201cNinth Prince, how dare you speak like that? Do you want to disown your father?\u201d\u201cDong!\u201dTrembling with fright, Concubine Lin kneeled on the ground at once and hastily explained that her Chen-er was too negligent to say the right appellation.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything wrong!\u201dWith sparkling eyes and a straight body, Zhang Ruochen stood out from the crowd. He added, \u201cBeing a father is duty bound to teach his son. I was brought up in poor health. Please ask yourself the following questions. As my father, have you ever taught me? Have you ever helped me? Or have you ever cared about me?\u201cBeing a husband ought to have three qualities: gratitude, affection, and morality. But, Your Highness, when my mother was given a beating with cudgels ordered by the queen, did you have any affection for her? My mom has suffered a lot in the past three years. Did you have any gratitude for her? On a cold winter night, we were driven from our home into the side hall as if we were banished to the side hall. Did you have any morality for us?\u201cSince you couldn\u2019t be a good father or a good husband, am I wrong to call you \u2018Your Majesty\u2019?\u201dIt was the first time that someone had talked to the Yunwu Commandery Prince in such a tone. Trembling with fear, those maidservants and eunuchs kneeled on the ground one after another.The Yunwu Commandery Prince affected a long face and looked at the queen beside him. He asked in a deep voice, \u201cWho gave that order? Who drove them into the side hall?\u201dThe queen sat still, glaring at the Eighth Prince and Concubine Xiao.\u201cDong! Dong!\u201dThe Eighth Prince and Concubine Xiao kneeled on the ground immediately. They became limp with their cold sweat exuding ceaselessly from their foreheads.\u201cIt\u2026 was\u2026 me!\u201d The voice of Concubine Xiao was trembling.Although it was actually ordered by the queen, how could Concubine Xiao dare to reveal the ringleader behind it?The Yunwu Commandery Prince gave her a snort of contempt and asked, \u201cOnly you?\u201dConcubine Xiao glanced at the Eighth Prince beside her, gritted her teeth and said, \u201cYes, nobody is involved but me.\u201d\u201cAlright, since you want to shoulder the responsibility alone, I\u2019ll satisfy your needs. Listen carefully! From now on, move to the Ziyi Side Hall right away!\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince answered.When hearing this, Concubine Xiao understood that she was really banished to the cold palace and it would be hard to turn her status around. Then she became limp and fainted.After Concubine Xiao was carried away, the Yunwu Commandery Prince stood up from his seat. He looked at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cIt seems that you have already accomplished the process of Washing Marrow and Breaking out of the Channels and have become a real warrior. You look quite different now. Okay, for your great courage and uprightness, I will make an exception and forgive you today. Would you like to attend the Year-end Assessment?\u201dWith a firm expression in his eyes, Zhang Ruochen said without being servile or bumptious, \u201cCertainly!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOkay! Haha! This is my son indeed! You are brave enough!\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince roared with laughter.This was a world to honor warriors. The real superiors were those who were strong-willed, backboned, and haughty.If Zhang Ruochen had behaved timidly and shrinkingly at their meeting, the Yunwu Commandery Prince would not have thought highly of him, even though he opened up the Sacred Mark.Kneeling on the ground, the Eighth Prince clenched his fist and glared at Zhang Ruochen. He said to himself.\u00a0\u201cZhang Ruochen, just enjoy it! At the Year-end Assessment, I will ravage you and let you know who the real superior is!\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She let out a long sigh of relief and pulled Zhang Ruochen aside as if she had something to question him about.It was still quite hard for Concubine Lin to believe what she had seen. Zhang Ruochen had not greeted the Commandery Prince Yunwu properly and had criticized him for being an irresponsible father and husband. She asked Zhang Ruochen, \u201cChen-er, have you really become a real warrior? Tell me the truth!\u201dHe did not want to keep his mother in the dark, so Zhang Ruochen nodded and replied, \u201cYes! I have finished the cultivation and now I am a warrior.\u201dConcubine Lin was worried about Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cLike you said, you just became a warrior. What if something happens during the Year-end Assessment? You don\u2019t have enough experience to handle it!\u201d\u201cLook, mom, even though I haven\u2019t joined the Year-end Assessment, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be totally safe. Don\u2019t you worry about me. I promise you that I will try my best and not do anything that exceeds my limits.\u201d Zhang Ruochen could understand why Concubine Lin was anxious, she did not know about Zhang Ruochen\u2019s ability from his previous life. Anyhow, Zhang Ruochen felt confident and ready for the assessment.Warriors under the age of 20 had to be exclusively approved to participate in the Year-end Assessment.The Yunwu Commandery Prince had nine sons and 13 daughters in total.The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth were all aged under 20. Except for the Seventh Prince, who was currently out of Yunwu City, the remaining princes would all attend the Year-end Assessment.Aside from the lineal princes and princess, the relatives of the Royal Family could also pick the three most outstanding warriors to join the Year-end Assessment. For example, the Lin family.The relatives gradually made their way and gathered the boundary of the Royal Coliseum, forming into alignment.There were some significant people in Yunwu City such as Martial Arts warriors of the Earth Realm, the Master of the suzerain, and the leader of a large-scale family. They were all invited to behold the assessment at the Royal Coliseum.The pretty and coquettish woman, Qin Ya, was also invited to the assessment. Mo Hanlin followed behind Qin Ya and asked, \u201cBoss, the Royal Family has sent the invitations to Qingxuan Pavilion every year. Yet, you have never attended. Why do you want to watch it this year? I don\u2019t understand.\u201dDespite the fact it was winter, Qin Ya was wearing a red blooming dress as one would in summer\u2019s heat. It exposed her snow-white arms and sensuous collarbone.There was a faint smile of attraction in Qin Ya\u2019s eyes and her lips were rosy and glittering. She responded to Mo Hanlin, \u201cWhen you meet someone that you are interested in, of course, you want to know more about him.\u201dMo Hanlin was shocked and asked, \u201cThe one you referring to is the Ninth Prince?\u201d\u201cHaha! Do you think there is anyone else apart from him?\u201d Qin Ya responded with a smile.After Zhang Ruochen visited Qingxuan Pavilion two months ago, Qin Ya had sent a secret agent to track him.What shocked Qin Ya was that the young man, who had shown such a strong determination to succeed, had not acquired the Sacred Mark in the past 16 years. Rather, he was as ordinary as any citizen of Yunwu and had always rested in bed due to illness.Qin Ya had also discovered the wretched situation of Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen inside the Royal Family, as well as the conflicts between Concubine Lin and her family.Yet, this young man, who held no power in Royal Family, had spent 100,000 silver coins for a substantial number of Pills and two Genuine Martial Arms at Qingxuan Pavilion.Qin Ya wondered where Zhang Ruochen had gotten all the silver coins from.Despite her high intellect, Qin Ya could not figure out what Zhang Ruochen was hiding.Other people might not have noticed, but from Qin Ya\u2019s point of view, the Ninth Prince that everyone looked down on was mysterious.Out of curiosity, she wanted to watch the Year-end Assessment in person and see how many secrets Zhang Ruochen had hidden. With the Pills and Arms Zhang Ruochen bought from Qingxuan Pavilion, Qin Ya thought that it might be worth going to the assessment to find out more about Zhang Ruochen.\u201cHostess Qin, I didn\u2019t expect you to come to the Royal Coliseum! What brings you here?\u201d Lin Fengxian took the initiative to greet his boss, Qin Ya, in her red dress, whom he recognized from far away. It seemed that Lin Fengxian was eager to ingratiate himself with Qin Ya.In Lin Fengxian\u2019s eyes, Qin Ya was as mysterious as Zhang Ruochen.Lin Fengxian had only seen Qin Ya once, so they were not close friends. However, knowing Qin Ya had control over the massive financial resources that affected the economical operation of Yunwu City, it appeared that she was definitely someone powerful in Yunwu City.It was rumored that five out of every 10 shopkeepers worked for her in the Martial Market. That would explain why she had so much control over the financial resources.Qin Ya had always been secretive and mysterious. No one could ever read her mind. Even if the leader of a superior family wanted to see her, it was relatively difficult.Lin Fengxian did not care how mysterious Qin Ya was, it was her financial status that interested him. He believed that if they could become close friends, it would be of great benefit to his family.Qin Ya finally arrived at the Royal Coliseum. She glanced at Lin Fengxian, slightly raised her eyebrows, and asked, \u201cExcuse me, do I know Your Excellency?\u201dMo Hanlin, who stood next to Qin Ya, whispered, \u201cMy hostess, he is Lin Fengxian, Head of the Lins.\u201d\u201cThe Lins? Oh well, that is interesting!\u201d Qin Ya\u2019s eyes blinked and an elegant smile appeared on her face. She said, \u201cThis is the Head of the Lins! Please forgive my discourtesy!\u201dLin Fengxian had not expected Qin Ya to be a woman that had a way with words. He smiled and responded, \u201cYes! I wanted to talk to you two years ago when I bought some Pills at Qingxuan Pavilion. Unfortunately, you, my hostess, were in a hurry at the time. I only caught a quick look at you from far away. You\u2019re more beautiful after two years, my hostess!\u201d\u201cTwo years ago\u2026\u201d Qin Ya wondered, trying to jog her memory.However, she could not recall anything at all. Yet, her smile never failed to dissolve any awkwardness.Qin Ya turned around and looked at the Lin family warriors behind him. Her attention was caught by Lin Ningshan. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, this is the second daughter of the Lins? Such a pretty lady! Oh, I\u2019m so embarrassed now!\u201dLin Ningshan stood behind her father, wearing a snow-white shirt, her hair swaying on her downy body. She was surely an exquisite, classically pretty, young woman.However, it would be unfair to say she was more beautiful than Qin Ya, the sexy and attractive hostess of Qingxuan Pavilion.All people could say was that they both had great charisma in their own way.\u201cHostess Qin, what an honor it is that you know my little girl!\u201d Lin Fengxian was shocked that Qin Ya had recognized his daughter.Of course, Qin Ya did not actually know Lin Ningshan. However, when she was investigating Zhang Ruochen, she had found out that Lin Ningshan was one of the people who influenced Zhang Ruochen the most.Therefore, this name, Lin Ningshan, was stored in her head.Qin Ya then smiled and expressed herself. \u201cOne of the four prettiest women in the Yunwu Commandery, I\u2019ve surely heard of her. It is said that even the honorable Ninth Prince has been following after Ningshan. I bet many girls are envious of her!\u201dA young warrior from the Lins sneered. \u201cThat\u2019s just the Ninth Prince\u2019s wishful thinking. Ningshan is too high up for him. Even if he were to cultivate for another hundred years, he could never catch up with Ningshan in terms of practice.\u201dAnother warrior from the Lins, who looked slightly older than 17, laughed and interrupted, \u201cAfter the Year-end Assessment, Ningshan will be engaged to the Seventh Prince. The Ninth Prince has overestimated himself. To be with our Ningshan? Such a ridiculous fool!\u201dThe two warriors who had just humiliated the Ninth Prince were Lin Tianwu and Lin Chengwu.Lin Ningshan, Lin Chengwu, and Lin Tianwu were the three outstanding prodigies picked from the Lins to participate in the Year-end Assessment. It seemed that the Lins were extremely confident with their capabilities as warriors. Yet, Qin Ya still found it hard to understand why they were being so harsh toward Zhang Ruochen.Qin Ya rubbed her chin lightly as if she had discovered some sort of secrets throughout the conversation. She said, \u201cOh! Ningshan is getting engaged to the Seventh Prince! Congratulations! This is such wonderful news for the Lin family! I guess that every woman in Yunwu City will surely be jealous of Ningshan once the engagement is announced!\u201dLin Ningshan grinned slightly. You could tell how happy and joyful she was from her eyes. After all, being able to marry the Seventh Prince was no doubt the dream of numerous women in the Yunwu Commandery.Lin Ningshan was only one step away from the dream!There were two parts to the Year-end Assessment\u2014the literary test and the Martial Arts Examination.Yet, the literary test was not as important as the Martial Arts Examination.Even if a warrior got first place in the literary test, there would only be some appreciation. On the other hand, if a warrior performed excellently in the Martial Arts Examination, there would be a rich and generous gift from the Royal Family.The Martial Arts Examination was beginning!The first round of the Martial Arts Examination was a power battle.Inside the Martial Arts arena, there were several black stone trays of different sizes. They were divided into 10 different levels.The smallest the stone tray weighed 100 kilograms with a diameter of half a meter.The largest weighed 1,000 kilograms with a three-meter diameter.Warriors had to take turns testing their power level according to their age, starting from the youngest to the oldest.The first warrior who stepped into the Martial Arts arena was Zhang Yulin, the Young Commandery Princess in the Royal Family, she was six years old. She stood only a meter tall.\u201cPhhf!\u201dPrincess Zhang Yulin walked toward the smallest black stone tray, the Genuine Qi in her body started running in the Meridians. She locked both of her hands on the edge of the stone tray. It seemed heavy for a six-year-old girl, yet Zhang Yulin managed to lift the 100 kg stone tray up.\u201cBang!\u201dShe tried her best to throw the stone stray out as far as she could, and it landed at around one meter.The Young Commandery Princess looked a bit disappointed at her distance for the first stone. She quickly got over it and prepared for the second.The second stone tray weighed 200 kg. Apparently, this was out of the princess\u2019s limits. She could not lift the stone tray up no matter how hard she tried. She did not want to, but she had to give up.Although the young Commandery Princess had failed to lift the second stone, her performance had already impressed the crowd in the Coliseum. They began to whisper, \u201cThe princess acquired the Sacred Mark when she was four years old. After two years of practice, she was able to lift up a 100 kg stone tray. This is absolutely impressive! I can assure you this little girl here is going to be a god\u2019s favored daughter.\u201dThe Yunwu Commandery Prince, who was sitting at the top of the Coliseum, also nodded his head in appreciation. There was no doubt he was joyful discovering that there was one more genius among his own children.Later on, the Tenth and Eleventh Princesses, who were aged 14 and 10 years old respectively, also took part in the first round of the assessment.The Tenth Princess had cultivated to the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm. She was confident and skipped the 100 kg stone. Instead, she walked directly to and lifted the 200 kg stone tray. As she expected, she threw it seven meters away. Then, she tried the 300 kg stone. What a pity! She was unable to lift it and had to give up.The Eleventh Princess was at the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm, the same as the Tenth Princess, and also threw the 200 kg stone to six meters.Given that the Eleventh Princess was four years younger than the Tenth Princess, her performance was outstanding.All three princesses who had finished the first-round of the assessment were under 14. The heaviest stone they lifted was 200 kg. In terms of power, they seemed to be slightly weaker than the princes.Up next, it was the real battle between geniuses.At 15 years old, Lin Ningshan was the youngest competitor, excluding the previous three warrior princesses. Therefore, she was the next genius to enter into the Martial Arts arena.She skipped the first nine stone trays and walked toward the 10th.The 10th stone tray weighed 1,000 kg and had a diameter of three meters.\u201cGo!\u201dLin Ningshan engaged the extensive Genuine Qi in her body. She locked onto the massive stone tray, which was even larger than her body, on one arm and easily lifted it overhead single-handed.People could not believe that with such a tiny body, Lin Ningshan could handle that terribly heavy weight.\u201cShe is only 15!\u201d The crowd was shocked at what they had just seen.Lin Ningshan twisted her finger and threw the massive stone out from her palm. It reached the 15-meter mark and smashed a huge hole into the ground. It was beyond everyone\u2019s expectation!Lin Ningshan had surely shocked every single person in the crowd. Voices were shouting all over the Coliseum. \u201cOh my God! This is absurd! She is definitely a genius from the Lins!\u201d\u201cThis young woman has fully subverted the fact that a woman\u2019s body is incomparable with a man\u2019s. Lifting a 1,000 kg stone with one arm? Wow! I can\u2019t wait to discover which stage she has cultivated to!\u201d The people continued to discuss her.\u2026The Yunwu Commandery Prince who was sitting at the top of the Coliseum was as shocked as the crowd and said, \u201cWhich family is this genius woman from? Comparing her talent with my Ninth Commandery Princess, I believe that there is not much difference between them!\u201dThe queen was more than satisfied with Lin Ningshan\u2019s performance. She grinned and said, \u201cYour Majesty, she is the daughter of the Head of the Lins. Her name is Lin Ningshan. I also think she is outstanding and want to arrange a marriage for her and our Seventh Prince. What do you think?\u201dThe emperor responded, \u201cOh! I recognize this young woman! In my point of view, her talent and family background matches fairly with our son.\u201dThe Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s eyebrows slightly frowned as his sight moved toward Zhang Ruochen, who stood near the edge of the Martial Arts arena. \u201cYet, I remember Ningshan and Ruochen are cousins as well as childhood sweethearts. I have already discussed with the head of the Lins about arranging their marriage. Sadly, what happened three years ago forced us to put the marriage aside.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe queen grinned and replied, \u201cYour Majesty! With Lin Ningshan\u2019s talent, how could she still fall for the Ninth Prince? Apparently, they are no longer a match for each other. The gap between these two will only widen with time.\u201d\u201cWith Lin Ningshan\u2019s talent, she is more than happy to be a concubine of the Seventh Prince. The Lins will not give up the opportunity of fawning over the Seventh Prince. Anyhow, the Lins would benefit if Ningshan was married to any prince.\u201dThe Yunwu Commandery Prince thought about it and nodded his head in acknowledgment. He could not deny the fact that the talent of the Ninth Prince was pretty much incomparable to Lin Ningshan\u2019s.In the Martial World, it was preferred for men to be superior to women.If it was the other way around, that women enjoyed a higher status than men on a large-scale, it was not a good sign for both men and women.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You know that there will be huge rocks everywhere,\u201d warned the Eighth Prince with a sneer.Outside the Royal Coliseum, a warrior laughed and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince, oh my God, he is humiliating himself. How can it be possible for him to lift a stone tray? It\u2019s over 100 kg. He can\u2019t even wash the marrow or break out of the channels. Three months is too short!\u201d\u201cThe Young Commandery Princess Yulin lifted the stone tray and she is only six. But look at the Ninth Prince. He is 16 now, and he can\u2019t even do that. That\u2019s shameful!\u201d\u201cCan he just go back and hide? He\u2019s not supposed to be here to attend Year-end Assessment.\u201dZhang Ruochen was obviously in his own world now. He ignored the malicious comments and walked toward the Martial Arts arena with a calm, steady gaze.On his way, he met Lin Ningshan, who had just come back.They stopped and stared at each other. There were only five steps between them.Lin Ningshan stared at Zhang Ruochen with a close gaze. Shaking her head slightly, she said,\u201dCousin, you shouldn\u2019t be here for the Year-end Assessment. Even if you are able to wash marrow and break out of the channels, it is impossible for you to lift the stone tray. Don\u2019t you know that it is not just about you? It is also about your mother and the entire Royal Family. Why? Why are you here?\u201dZhang Ruochen frowned. He looked at Lin Ningshan and said, \u201cCousin Ningshan, I admit that you are quite outstanding and talented, however, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can denigrate others.\u201dNow Lin Ningshan\u2019s eyes were filled with disappointment. \u201cCan\u2019t you just listen to me? Maybe living a normal life is the best for you. You don\u2019t have to cultivate, it is just not suitable for you.\u201dShe had planned to convince Zhang Ruochen to quit because they had played together many years ago. Their great times together had pushed her to help Zhang Ruochen now.\u201cHe is so stubborn. Who the hell does he think he is?\u201dLin Ningshan felt that there was nothing she could say to Zhang Ruochen, that stupid, stubborn boy.\u201cAll right, take care, Ruochen.\u201d With her head raised high, Lin Ningshan walked toward the exit of the Martial Arts arena.They passed each other, going in opposite directions.The moment that Lin Ningshan left the Coliseum, she was surrounded by many young warriors. These young men admired and praised her, treating her like a diamond.That was because she was just 15 and was able to lift a stone tray weighing approximately 1,000 kg. In addition, she could toss that kind of stone tray to a maximum distance of 15 meters. Many warriors older than her could not do that at all.Most importantly, she was elegant and gorgeous. As one of the top four most beautiful girls in the Yunwu Commandery, she was meant to be loved as god\u2019s favored daughter.\u201cCongrats, Leader Lin, we just witnessed the birth of another genius, Ningshan! We won\u2019t be able to find another one of the younger generation in Yunwu City as talented as her!\u201d exclaimed a famous Martial Artist from Yunwu City.The leader of the Wang Clan smiled and said, \u201cI have heard that Ningshan and the Seventh Prince will get engaged. They are meant to be together!\u201dOthers\u2019 compliments made Lin Fengxian, the Head of the Lin family, feel very proud.Of course, other eyes were on Zhang Ruochen in the Martial Arts arena. It was not difficult to see that they were waiting for this prince to disgrace himself.Families that had close relationships with the Royal Family were all familiar with the name of this prince. He was famous for his poor health.The Seventh Prince and the Ninth Prince had both inherited genes from the Commandery Prince. But they were so different. The Seventh Prince was a genius in people\u2019s eyes, he was a hero of Yunwu City as well. However, Zhang Ruochen was an idiot in others\u2019 minds, people did not expect anything from him.Without any doubt, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s presence today, attending the Year-end Assessment, was considered a joke.However, there was one exception\u2014Qin Ya, who was sitting outside the Royal Coliseum. When she saw Zhang Ruochen walking into the Martial Arts arena, she became very concentrated with her gorgeous eyes wide open.\u201cThat\u2019s exciting. Now surprise me, Ruochen!\u201d A hint of a smile crossed her lips.Everyone watched Zhang Ruochen walk toward the first stone tray.All of a sudden, people from outside the Martial Arts arena burst into laughter.\u201cHe is 16, but he can only choose the first and the lightest stone tray to test his power. Is there anything funnier than him?\u201dApart from Zhang Ji, the Eighth Prince, who had a disdainful look, other princes and princesses were feeling very awkward now. In their mind, Zhang Ruochen disgraced the entire Royal Family, themselves included.However, surprisingly, Zhang Ruochen did not stop at the first stone tray. He walked toward the second stone tray, then the third.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Everyone was confused.Zhang Ruochen did not stop until he finally arrived at the 10th stone tray.\u201cWhat? Is he going to try the 10th tray? That\u2019s ridiculous. From what I can recall, he only obtained his Sacred Mark three months ago.\u201dWith a scornful snort, Zhang Ji commented, \u201cWhat an idiot. How can he lift a tray of more than 1,000 kilograms? Even if he practices for 30 years, he can\u2019t make it!\u201dLin Ningshan was staring at Zhang Ruochen as well. However, she shook her head slightly with a sigh.Now all the people were looking at Zhang Ruochen.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen stamped a foot on the ground and injected his Genuine Qi into the ground through it. Qi Billow, caused by his Genuine Qi, was spreading outward from his foot.Driven by Genuine Qi, the huge stone tray jumped to one meter high immediately.Zhang Ruochen reached out a hand and caught the huge tray easily. He seemed to be like a floating cloud and flowing water. This stone tray had a diameter of three meters, however, he only used five fingers to support it, kind of like holding a plate. He lifted the stone tray over his head easily.Seeing this, the entire Royal Coliseum became so quiet that not even a breath could be heard.Zhang Ruochen stood still like a spear. Although he was lifting a monstrous stone tray, given the relaxed look on his face, it seemed that he was using no power at all.\u201cHow can this be possible?\u201d Zhang Ji looked pale and his lips quivered.Not just Zhang Ji, but other princes and princesses, all of them were shocked. With blank minds, they had no clue how Zhang Ruochen had become so different.Others\u2019 minds were wandering, when Zhang Ruochen suddenly punched out the bottom of the stone tray.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe giant stone tray jumped to five meters high.After that, it fell to the ground at a greater speed.The shock wave along with the weight of the stone tray should have given the landing point a great impact, the force of more than 1,000 kg.But Zhang Ruochen caught it again. Then, he slowly but steadily put the stone tray back to its original place with one hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBoom!\u201dNo one could calm himself down. All the people in the Royal Coliseum were busy chatting now.People could not believe their eyes. Without a doubt, the power demonstrated by Zhang Ruochen was much greater than that of Lin Ningshan.He was only 16, and he had just obtained his Sacred Mark three months ago.It was a mystery and so hard to believe. But it had just happened and everyone had seen it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She could not accept how powerful Zhang Ruochen had become after only three months of practice.Lin Fengxian was also shocked by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s performance. As if he had been petrified, his eyes could not stop staring at Zhang Ruochen.The general warriors were able to tell how powerful Zhang Ruochen was, yet the warriors with cultivation discovered something more than that.First of all, when Zhang Ruochen stamped one foot on the stone tray, he was able to shock a 1,000 kg stone tray up from the ground. This was not merely a kind of re-bouncing power.To be exact, Zhang Ruochen infused the Genuine Qi in his body and directed it underground. Then, the Genuine Qi turned into layers of waves crashing into the bottom of the stone tray.Undergoing several layers of waves, the stone tray eventually got off the ground.Relying only on the power of re-bounce, even warriors from the Completion of the Yellow Realm were not strong enough to shock a 1,000 kg the stone tray.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s mastery of Genuine Qi was extremely detailed and fabulous. He had no doubt surprised a large number of Martial Arts superiors in the Coliseum. Some of them even felt ashamed of their abilities and experiences compared with the obscure Zhang Ruochen.Shocking a 1,000 kg stone tray from underground was difficult. Yet, catching the stone from a five-meter height overhead with terrifying force was simply not something a Yellow Realm warrior would be able to do.Since Zhang Ruochen managed to use Genuine Qi and converted it to layers of waves, it crashed into the bottom of the stone tray and neutralized the force of impact of the falling stone tray.This was the reason why he could successfully catch the falling stone tray.Only Martial Arts warriors with superior vision would be able to identify Zhang Ruochen\u2019s exquisite technique. And because the superior Martial Artists with advanced attainment discovered certain clues throughout Zhang Ruochen\u2019s performance, they were extremely shocked and found him incredible.\u201cThe Ninth Prince\u2019s ability to master Genuine Qi is much better than the warriors of the Black Realm!\u201d\u00a0The crowd started comparing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s competence with that of other warriors.A Genius of Martial Arts had risen!Zhang Ruochen then walked out of the Martial Arts arena. When he passed by Lin Ningshan, she stared at him and said, \u201cYou did a good job of hiding your cultivation! Did you insult me on purpose? Let me tell you, a person\u2019s power could be enhanced incredibly with the use of a treasure!\u201cHowever, power alone won\u2019t ensure that you will win when it comes to a real fight. The Year-end Assessment has just started, you will see the actual difference between us later!\u201d Lin Ningshan added.Yet, Lin Ningshan could not even tell how excellent Zhang Ruochen was in terms of utilizing Genuine Qi. Thus, she thought that Zhang Ruochen had gotten lucky and had taken some kind of treasure for his vigorous power.In fact, even if an ordinary person took some undefined Pills, there was a chance that they would become powerful.Zhang Ruochen shook his head slightly after hearing what Lin Ningshan had said. It clearly did not bother him anyway as he walked toward Concubine Lin.\u201cMom, I did it!\u201d Zhang Ruochen exclaimed.Standing among all the concubines, Concubine Lin\u2019s vision was blurry as if she had just been shot by lightning. She shivered and asked, \u201cChen-er\u2026? Is this my Chen-er?\u201dConcubine Lin hugged Zhang Ruochen firmly and started crying.She had been waiting so long to see Zhang Ruochen become a warrior.Concubine Lin thought that the day of Zhang Ruochen becoming a warrior would never come. She did not believe that Zhang would have made it. But he was now a warrior, he was a young superior! He definitely impressed every single one in the Coliseum and now no one would dare to tease him anymore.What Concubine Lin wanted was very simple\u2014fair and equal treatment.For the other concubines, maidservants, and eunuchs standing aside who had witnessed Zhang Ruochen turn from a feeble boy into a warrior, only one thought came into their minds.\u00a0\u201cFrom now on, we have to flatter Concubine Lin for our own good!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Yunwu Commandery Prince stood up suddenly, looked at Zhang Ruochen with excitement, and said, \u201cMy ninth son! I\u2019m so pleased to know you\u2019ve finally succeeded, though late in your life. No matter what your Year-end Assessment result is, the Royal Family is going to host a banquet for three days to celebrate your cultivation! Ruochen, come closer to me. Let me take a look at my dear son!\u201d\u201cChen-er, go! Quickly go to greet your father!\u201d said Concubine Lin with tears.Concubine Lin wiped the tears from her face, held Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hands, and walked toward the Yunwu Commandery Prince.\u201cGood day, Your Majesty!\u201d Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen saluted the Yunwu Commandery Prince at the same time.The Yunwu Commandery Prince took a deep look at Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cI guess your cultivation has reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm\u2026?\u201dDuring the first-round assessment, Zhang Ruochen fully demonstrated his power. Surely he could not hide the level of his cultivation from the Yunwu Commandery Prince.Zhang Ruochen responded, \u201cYes, My Emperor!\u201d\u201cCultivating from nothing to the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm in just three months\u2019 time is not something a normal warrior could do. Ruochen, what have you been doing recently? Have you experienced anything special lately?\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince asked.Zhang Ruochen said pleasantly, \u201cYour Majesty, I did experience something special, but that is my secret. I have the right to keep it with me rather than sharing it with anyone else.\u201dThe queen was furious about Zhang Ruochen\u2019s response. She shouted, \u201cHow dare you! His Majesty is your biological father, what secrets do you have to hide from your father?\u201dThe Yunwu Commandery Prince moderately lifted his hand and stopped the queen from continuing speaking. Yet, he looked at Zhang Ruochen with appreciation and said, \u201cEvery warrior has their secret of cultivation. If you don\u2019t want to talk about it, I\u2019m not going to force you. Work hard in the rest of Year-end Assessment. I\u2019m so looking forward to it!\u201dUp next in the Martial Arts arena was the Ninth Commandery Princess.The Ninth Commandery Princess, Zhang Yuxi, was a tall, beautiful lady with bright skin, exuding an elegant nobility presence.She was one day older than Zhang Ruochen. Her Martial Arts talent and beauty were comparable to Lin Ningshan. Zhang Yuxi was also one of the four beauties in the Yunwu Commandery. She and Lin Ningshan were called the \u201cTwo Beauties in Yunwu City\u201d.The Ninth Commandery Princess was about to lift the 10th stone tray. She threw it 13 meters away. It seemed that her power was slightly weaker than Lin Ningshan, who made it two meters farther than Zhang Yuxi.Zhang Yuxi frowned and walked out of the Martial Arts arena. She stood next to Zhang Ruochen with an attractive smile. \u201cMy ninth brother, be aware of me when we go hunting at King Mount, I\u2019m one of your competitors!\u201dAs Zhang Ruochen and Zhang Yuxi were at a similar age, they had played together all the time when they were small. After Zhang Yuxi had obtained the Sacred Mark, she had to spend most of the time practicing Martial Arts and thus their relationship was not as close as it used to be.Zhang Ruochen felt even more distant from Zhang Yuxi now, as this was the Zhang Ruochen from the previous life. He did not have any memories of playing with her. He did not say much in front of her and just nodded to respond to what she said.The next person who stepped into the Martial Arts arena was the Eighth Prince, Zhang Ji.Since the Eighth Prince had cultivated to the Dawn State, he expected to easily beat down Zhang Ruochen and be praised by the Yunwu Commandery Prince at the Year-end Assessment.Yet, the performance of Zhang Ruochen was so incredible that it seriously pounded the confidence of Zhang Ji.Zhang Ji was under lots of pressure and started brainwashing himself.\u00a0\u201cI need to lift the 10th stone tray! Zhang Ruochen is just crap. If he can do it, I can surely do it!\u201dThe Eighth Prince Zhang Ji had just reached the Dawn State and did not expect to lift the 10th stone tray. However, he could not lose this round to Zhang Ruochen. Beating Zhang Ruochen became his motivation and he desperately wanted to lift the 1,000 kg stone tray.\u201cCome on!\u201dThe Eighth Prince locked his arms onto the massive stone tray. Every single vein in his body stuck out and the stone tray was going up moderately.Yet, when he lifted the stone tray up to half a meter, his fingers slipped and \u201cBoom!\u201d\u2014the stone tray fell down on Zhang Ji\u2019s back foot.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cMy foot\u2026 Help! Please help!\u201d the Eighth Prince screamed as if he was a hog being killing.The stone that fell caused a fracture on Zhang Ji\u2019s foot.He fainted after a second due to too much pain. He fell down like a dead hog in the middle of the Martial Arts arena. Obviously, it did not go as he had planned.Two royal security guards ran into the Martial Arts arena, moved the massive stone tray away, and carried him down for treatment.Coming up, there was another young warrior walking into the Martial Arts arena.The following warriors were all aged above 16. These were the geniuses being picked out from different families. Most of them could easily lift a 1,000 kg stone tray.Among the warriors, there were three outstanding ones. All of them had cultivated to the Final State of the Yellow Realm and threw the massive stone tray 20 meters away.The Fifth Prince, 19 years old with a Final State of the Yellow Realm cultivation, had shot the 1,000 kg stone tray 20 meters away.The 17-year-old Situ Linjiang, who was the youngest warrior of the Situs, also with a Final State of the Yellow Realm cultivation, performed three meters better than the Fifth Prince.Xue Kai, aged 19, was the grandson of the minister. He had also cultivated to the Final State of the Yellow Realm and even pushed the result further than Situ Linjiang to a distance of 24 meters.Aside from Zhang Ruochen, Lin Ningshan, and the Ninth Commandery Princess Zhang Yuxi, the performances of these three warriors were brilliant among everyone in the first round of the power assessment.Next, it was the second round of the assessment\u2014Hunting in King Mount.Only warriors who had lifted the 10th stone tray were eligible to enter the second-round assessment.There were 43 young warriors who had lifted up the 10th stone tray in the first round.The royal guards led 43 antelope-horses into the Coliseum. Each of them looked like a little elephant, wearing metallic armor with a sharp unicorn-like horn.On every antelope-horse\u2019s back, there was a meter-and-a-half-long wire-bow and five Thunder Arrows.The minister stood at the stone table and loudly said, \u201cYou have all fully demonstrated your ability by lifting up a 1,000 kg stone tray. You are now qualified to fight against first-level savage beasts. However, the power of a first-level savage beast is much stronger than you imagine. Moreover, their speed is also as fast as lightning.\u201cWith your abilities, you might not be able to kill a savage beast with your Martial Arts skills. Yet, with the use of Thunder Arrows, you will be able to pierce through and take the savage beast down.\u201cEvery one of you will be given five arrows.

She glanced at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cMy cousin, I admit that the power assessment is my weaker area. Now it\u2019s my show time! I hope that you can keep up with me in this round of assessment!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dLin Ningshan struck the whip on the antelope-horse\u2019s buttock and it immediately expanded its iron heels and streaked across King Mount.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was high and steep, with waterfalls, cliffs, valleys, and forests all over it. Almost all the savage beasts there were at the first level and a few at the second.Like a handful of sand thrown into the ocean, the 43 young warriors soon vanished into the woods after they were sent into King Mount.\u201cPhhf!\u201dA white shadow flashed through the one-meter-tall brambles. It instantly passed through the open field over 60 meters long and dashed into the distant thick forest.The white shadow was so fast that a man without Martial Arts could never see it clearly.With his ability, Zhang Ruochen saw that it was a rabbit-like savage beast.It was a first-level savage beast, a Lightning Rabbit. It ran fast and had sharp claws and teeth, but was weak in defensive power.Their power and speed were equal to a warrior\u2019s in the Initial Stage and the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, respectively.\u201cIt\u2019s just a Lightning Rabbit, not worthy of a Thunder Arrow.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen had already drawn his Wire Bow into a half-moon-shape, but then he shook his head and put it down.It was known that the higher level the savage beast was at, the higher score a warrior could attain.Lightning Rabbits were only from the inferior class among the first-level savage beasts. To Zhang Ruochen, wasting a Thunder Arrow on a beast like that was not worthwhile.\u201cWhew!\u201dA wind-breaking sound rang out from the other direction.A Thunder Arrow with lightning-like splendor precisely slammed into the Lightning Rabbit\u2019s head.\u201cPfft!\u201dThe Lightning Rabbit\u2019s head was punctured by a Thunder Arrow. The Thunderbolt Crystals inlaid on the arrowhead blasted immediately and turned into fist-sized electric balls. The balls cracked and melted into flows of current.The Lightning Rabbit died at once and fell by a tree.The Sixth Prince rushed over on his antelope-horse. Without getting down, he leaned forward to the ground and lifted the beast by gripping the arrow that was in its head.\u201cMy ninth brother, it\u2019s your first time hunting in King Mount and you don\u2019t dare to kill a savage beast? You need more courage to be a man.\u201d The Sixth Prince sneered at Zhang Ruochen with the Lightning Rabbit in his hand.In his eyes, Zhang Ruochen might be a genius in Martial Arts, but this was his first time hunting and it was normal to be frightened.After all, fighting and killing were completely different.The hunting in King Mount was intended to test not only warriors\u2019 abilities, but also their courage.If a warrior was so timid that he could not even kill a savage beast, he would be of no use, no matter how high his cultivation was.The Sixth Prince reached the peak of the Dawn State when he was 18.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to waste a Thunder Arrow.\u201dThe Sixth Prince gave a brittle laugh and said, \u201cYou are absolutely wrong. There aren\u2019t too many savage beasts, and not everyone can hunt five beasts with five Thunder Arrows.\u201dThe Sixth Prince rode off and vanished into the woods, leaving Zhang Ruochen with these words.\u201cKing Mount is indeed not too large. It seems that I really have to speed up as there won\u2019t be too many savage beasts for me to hunt!\u201dZhang Ruochen rushed in the other direction on his antelope-horse.Zhang Ruochen encountered three Lightning Rabbits in one hour. He, however, did not shoot any of them. Rather, he kept on searching for other higher-level savage beasts.\u201cMoo!\u201dAn earsplitting whine rang out from Zhang Ruochen\u2019s left side.Zhang Ruochen was delighted. He immediately went to look for the sound and found three huge Brute Bulls next to the riverside.Brute Bulls, inferior-class level-one savage beasts, had the power and the defensive power of a warrior at the Advanced Stage and the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, respectively.The Strength of a Bull referred to a Brute Bull\u2019s power.But someone had come here earlier, and now she was standing right in front of the three Brute Bulls.The Ninth Commandery Princess, Zhang Yuxi, sat on an antelope-horse in her royal finch robe. Her black hair dropped to her waist. She smiled enchantingly and said, \u201cMy ninth brother, you are too late. These three belong to me!\u201d\u201cMoo!\u201dThe three Brute Bulls\u2019 eyes were glowing. They pedaled the ground with their iron heels that sparked when they crashed on the stones.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe three Brute Bulls rushed toward the Ninth Commandery Princess at the same time.She took out three Thunder Arrows at once, placed them on the bowstring, and drew the Wire Bow into a full-moon shape.\u201cCrash!\u201dAll three Thunder Arrows were released at once and slammed into their foreheads seven inches deep.Lightning blasted out of the arrowheads. The three Brute Bulls all died immediately and fell heavily into the river, splashing sheets of water.The Ninth Commandery Princess put her Wire Bow away, looked at Zhang Ruochen in the distance and smiled brightly. \u201cMy arrow technique is in the Inferior Class of the Human Stage, and I\u2019ve managed to master it. What do you think, my ninth brother?\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at the water surface behind her and yelled, \u201cWatch out!\u201dShe also recognized the danger. She turned around to find a savage beast, which was twice as big as a Brute Bull, dashing out of the water.It had metal-like skin and two sharp horns. It ran toward her abruptly.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019 antelope-horse roared with pain. Its bones were broken, a bowl-sized bloody hole was pierced in its body by the horn. It fell to the ground heavily.This happened so suddenly that the Ninth Commandery Princess could not react and fell to the ground with her antelope-horse.The Ninth Commandery Princess was overwhelmed. She rolled on the ground and was about to stand up quickly.All of a sudden, a huge shadow appeared above her head. The huge savage beast lifted its iron heel and was going to step on her.If one was stepped on by a savage beast, there was no doubt that his body would break into pieces.\u201cBang!\u201dA Thunder Arrow flew from a distance and dashed on the beast\u2019s neck, knocking the beast away a little bit.Its iron heels brushed past the Ninth Commandery Princess and hit the ground beside her, forming two half-inch-deep pits.\u201cThis is certainly a medium-class level-one savage beast! The Iron Bull! But its defensive power is so strong that a Thunder Arrow can\u2019t break through its skin!\u201dIt was not only because of its strong defensive power, but also the far distance between Zhang Ruochen and the beast that weakened the power of the Thunder Arrow.Zhang Ruochen stood up on the antelope-horse\u2019s back. He quickly jumped up and rushed to the riverside.An Iron Bull\u2019s power was equal to a warrior in the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, and its defensive power was equivalent to a warrior in the Final State of the Yellow Realm, which was quite outstanding among medium-class level-one savage beasts.\u201cMoo!\u201dThe Iron Bull was infuriated by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s arrow. It lifted its iron heel up again and took a huge step next toward the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cCrash!\u201dRising up four meters high, Zhang Ruochen took out a Thunder Arrow, drew the bow, and shot it out.\u201cPfft!\u201dThe Thunder Arrow accurately shot into the Iron Bull\u2019s mouth. The Thunderbolt Crystal exploded in its throat and turned into an electric ball that completely smashed its throat.The Iron Bull stepped back in great pain with blood coming out of its mouth.\u201cBang!\u201dFinally, it fell to the ground heavily with a loud noise.With a long sigh of relief, the Ninth Commandery Princess stood up with her legs shaking. It was so dangerous! She would have died under those iron heels if Zhang Ruochen had not shot the beast.Zhang Ruochen walked toward her and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201dShe shook her head and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be okay if you hadn\u2019t shown up in time. My dear ninth brother, why is your arrow technique so excellent? An Iron Bull is a medium-class level-one savage beast, and has the defensive power of a warrior in the Final State of the Yellow Realm! But you killed it with only two arrows!\u201dZhang Ruochen took a look at the beast\u2019s body on the ground and said, \u201cNo matter if it\u2019s a savage beast or a human, they all have weaknesses. You will easily win if you attack its weakness. Even if your power is weaker than his.\u201dThe greatest advantage that humans have is wisdom. They could use soldiers and weapons, as well as the ability to analyze a savage beasts\u2019 weaknesses.Therefore, human warriors could kill the savage beasts that were a lot stronger than themselves.In fact, the Ninth Commandery Princess also had the chance to kill the Iron Bull with her strength. Yet, the beast surprised her and had put her in a difficult position.She put the Wire Bow on her back and picked up her quiver with only two Thunder Arrows in it. She said, \u201cThere are different marks on our Thunder Arrows. The royal security guard will collect the prey later, so we don\u2019t need to take them out in person. Let\u2019s go.\u201dWhile she was speaking, she walked toward Zhang Ruochen\u2019s antelope-horse.Zhang Ruochen slightly frowned and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dShe smiled and said, \u201cMy antelope-horse is badly hurt. I can only ride on yours now. You won\u2019t let me go hunt on foot, will you my ninth brother?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was wearing a tight, royal finch robe that outlined her nice hour-glass figure, with plump breasts and a tiny waist. Every inch of her skin was white as snow and sent out a light fragrance.She lightly pushed on the antelope-horse\u2019s back and elegantly jumped on it.\u201cCome on, my ninth brother! If we don\u2019t hurry up, other warriors will kill all the savage beasts!\u201d She winked at him and stretched a hand out as an invitation.At last, Zhang Ruochen walked over to her and took her hand in order to jump onto the antelope-horse\u2019s back.The antelope-horse carried both of them off and rushed into the deep woods.\u201cIf we work together, we are powerful enough to kill medium-class level-one savage beasts with our strength,\u201d said the Ninth Commandery Princess with an expectant look in her eyes. One could obtain a very high score if they could hunt down a medium-class level-one savage beast.The calculation equation of the score was as follows: One superior-class level-one savage beast was equal to five medium-class level-one savage beasts.One medium-class level-one savage beast was equal to five inferior-class level-one savage beasts.In other words, although Zhang Ruochen only killed one Iron Bull, it was equivalent to five inferior-class level-one savage beasts.Not everyone could kill a medium-class level-one savage beast. It took at least the cultivation of the Medium State of the Yellow Realm.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFurthermore, medium-class level-one savage beasts had outstanding speed and defensive power. Therefore, it was not easy to hunt them, even with the cultivation of the Medium State.Although Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation was only at the Peak of the Dawn State, his strength was much more powerful than many warriors at the Medium State. That was why he could kill the Iron Bull successfully.With a sharp look in his eyes, Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cIt would be amazing if we can kill a superior-class level-one savage beast!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! The power of a superior-class level-one savage beast is equal to a warrior who has reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm. It will be a disaster if we actually encounter one! We will probably struggle to escape!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess continued, \u201cThe Seventh Prince is the only one who killed a superior-class level-one savage beast in the past 10 years. As for this year, I believe nobody has the ability to kill one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, she knew where those savage beasts would be.\u201cThe Roar Slope is ahead of us. I used to hear a Red Smilodon Tiger roaring over there. You know, Red Smilodon Tigers are medium-class level-one savage beasts, which are even stronger than an Iron Bulls. Because I couldn\u2019t kill it, I didn\u2019t even get closer to it,\u201d she said.Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess got off the antelope-horse and sneaked into the Roar Slope. They planned to find traces of Red Smilodon Tigers.Zhang Ruochen found traces of some dust-ups on the ground.A thick tree trunk had crashed down and its leaves had been burnt to ashes. There was a giant rock nearby and they saw some blood stains near the rock.\u201cSo someone else has killed the Red Smilodon Tiger?\u201d asked the Ninth Commandery Princess.Zhang Ruochen shook his head and said, \u201cThose blood stains are not from a Red Smilodon Tiger, but from humans. We should be careful because Red Smilodon Tigers can be nearby!\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dAll of a sudden, they saw a crimson tiger come hurtling down a steep slope, whose sharp claws were very close to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s neck now.Zhang Ruochen had reached the Completion of Heaven Realm in his last life. Although he was now reborn, his soul and Spiritual Power remained at their previous levels. Thus, he was quite sensitive to any potential risks.He took one step to the right to avoid the attack from the Red Smilodon Tiger. Due to his quick reaction, he made it.After that, he pulled out a Thunder Arrow from the quiver on his back. He quickly injected Genuine Qi into the arrowhead and thrust the arrow into the abdomen of the Red Smilodon Tiger backhanded.Then he immediately jumped from the ground and moved backward.All this happened in just a few seconds. Before the Ninth Commandery Princess knew it, the Red Smilodon Tiger had been attacked and had an arrow in its abdomen.\u201cBang!\u201dThe arrowhead of the Thunder Arrow exploded, which left a palm-sized wound on the tiger\u2019s abdomen. Now the Red Smilodon Tiger was bleeding.However, because Zhang Ruochen had thrust the Thunder Arrow with his bare hand, the impact force was not as strong as that of a Wire Bow.Because of this, the Thunder Arrow did not go deep enough to cause lethal damage to the tiger. The arrowhead was only three inches below the skin.\u201cAwoo!\u201dRed Smilodon Tigers were three times larger than normal tigers. They had two rows of sharp teeth, which were half a foot long. Each single claw could be used as a blade.Their power could be as strong as that of a warrior in the Final State of the Yellow Realm, while their speed was as fast as a Final State warrior as well. If an average warrior met a Red Smilodon Tiger, unfortunately, his life would end there.Now the Red Smilodon Tiger was just 10 meters away and the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s face became even paler.That was a powerful savage beast. At such a close distance, even a Thunder Arrow could not be used well.Bows and arrows were long-distance weapons.Fight!She immediately took out a Thunder Arrow, placed it on a bowstring, and pulled the Wire Bow into the shape of a full moon.\u201cWhew!\u201dThe Thunder Arrow flew out like a bolt of lightning.The Red Smilodon Tiger jumped up at an amazing speed. Without a doubt, the arrow missed the target.One second later, it was in front of the Ninth Commandery Princess. The Wire Bow in her hand was snatched and thrown away by this giant savage beast. It opened its huge mouth and tried to bite her.The Ninth Commandery Princess did a backflip, during which she used one of her fingers to hit the ground in order to do another backflip. Now she was seven or eight meters away from the Red Smilodon Tiger and had managed to avoid the attack.However, the tiger was even faster. It reached out one of its paws and hit the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s head.The Ninth Commandery Princess had just reached the level of the Medium State, therefore, her power was weaker than a Red Smilodon Tiger, while her speed was slower.If the distance was longer, she probably could have used a Thunder Arrow to pose a threat to the Red Smilodon Tiger.However, it was a short-distance battle, she could not use any Genuine Martial Arms as a Medium State warrior. She could not win against a Red Smilodon Tiger.The movement of tiger claws caused a gale which hurt the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s face. What was even worse, the claws were very close to her now.She thought she would die for sure, however, all of a sudden, she saw a man rushing over out of the corner of her eye. It was Zhang Ruochen! He was running toward the Red Smilodon Tiger!\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201dZhang Ruochen hit the back of the tiger with his palm. It seemed that his palm made a huge sound, like the roar of a brute elephant. The power of the hit was equivalent to the Strength of Sixteen Bulls, and the tiger was thrown outward in one second.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Red Smilodon Tiger crashed into a tree nearby and fell to the ground.Zhang Ruochen rushed over there and utilized all of his Genuine Qi, making his palm as strong as a blade.\u201cBang!\u201dHis palm hit on the Red Smilodon Tiger\u2019s neck, crushing its trachea.The tiger was shaking because of its broken trachea. It tried to get up and rush toward the jungle, however, it just died very quickly.The Ninth Commandery Princess stared at Zhang Ruochen in shock. She was amazed that he had killed the Red Smilodon Tiger with his bare hands.\u201cNinth brother, are you really a Dawn State warrior? You obtained your Sacred Mark just three months ago, right?\u201d she asked.Zhang Ruochen said with a calm voice, \u201cLike I said before, both savage beasts and warriors have weaknesses. As long as you can spot their weaknesses, you can easily kill a warrior or a savage beast. The trachea is the weakness of a Red Smilodon Tiger.\u201d\u201cBut I saw the hit, its power was at least as strong as the Strength of Ten Bulls.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess said, \u201cI am a Medium State warrior and I can\u2019t unleash such strong power. You just reached the Dawn State, however. How did you do that?\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cWith a good physique, even a Dawn State warrior can unleash the Strength of Ten Bulls. It\u2019s not strange.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess stopped asking him. Zhang Ruochen\u2019s strong power had left a deep impression on her. This half-brother, who was just one day younger than her, was becoming harder to read.They saw the dead body of that Red Smilodon Tiger in the jungle not far away.A Thunder Arrow was thrust into the abdomen of the Red Smilodon Tiger. Yes, the arrow that was thrust by Zhang Ruochen earlier.\u201cDamn it. If I had my Blue Water Sword with me, I\u2019m sure I could have had a chance to beat it, or even kill it,\u201d the Ninth Commandery Princess said, unreconciled.She was one of the top two beauties in Yunwu City. As a beauty with great intelligence, she had been chased by two savage beasts and saved twice by Zhang Ruochen.All that ruined her self-esteem. This proud princess told herself if she met savage beasts next time, she would hunt and kill them directly, utilizing her great skills.\u201cNinth brother, let\u2019s go and hunt some other savage beasts\u2026\u201dZhang Ruochen tapped the Ninth Commandery Princess on the shoulder with an intense stare. He said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dShe was confused right now. Before she could ask him why, she saw a deer with blue flames walking toward them slowly.It was a Green-Fire Deer. The Ninth Commandery Princess could not stop trembling now and could feel that she was not breathing.\u201cWhomp, whomp!\u201dThat Green-Fire Deer had a pair of eyes that looked like rubies. It was about two meters tall, and its deer antlers were like two coral jade sticks. The deer\u2019s hair seemed to be on fire.Once the deer walked by, the topsoil was burnt by the fire from the deer.As a superior-class level-one savage beast, a Green-Fire Deer could be as strong and as fast as a Final State of the Yellow Realm warrior.The only weakness of a Green-Fire Deer was that it was not good at defending itself. Its defensive techniques were even weaker than those of a Red Smilodon Tiger.Although this deer might not be good at defending itself, it was so fast that not many warriors could even get close to it, let alone attack it.Many warriors could be killed by a Green-Fire deer without having the chance to attack it.\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess dared not to breathe now, feeling that her body was frozen.With their current cultivation, they could not compete against a superior-class level-one savage beast. In other words, they would probably die here.In previous years\u2019 mountain hunting on King Mount, it had happened that some warriors had lost their lives.The Ninth Commandery Princess did not want to die here, which was obvious. She thought hard in order to save her life, however, given that a Green-Fire Deer was so fast, she probably would not even be given the chance to escape.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRight now, unlike her, Zhang Ruochen was still calm, with conviction in his eyes.He took off the quiver and handed it to her and said, \u201cI have two Thunder Arrows left and you have one, so altogether there are three. You may not be able to kill it with the arrows, but with your techniques, you can at least pose some threat to it, right?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dShe watched Zhang Ruochen walking toward the Green-Fire Deer, with her eyes wide open. She was confused.\u00a0\u201cIs he going to hunt and kill that deer?\u201cThat is a superior-class level-one savage beast!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides that, he could not use Genuine Martial Arms, because his Flash Shining Sword and Abyss Ancient Sword were stored in the internal space.Once he used them, others would know that the Time and Space Spinel was with him.Luckily, it was a Green-Fire Deer. If he had met any other superior-class level-one savage beasts, he would have no chance to win at all.But a Green-Fire Deer was different. It was fast, but it was not as strong as other superior-class level-one savage beasts. And a Green-Fire Deer was not good at defending itself.Zhang Ruochen had reached the Completion of the Heaven Realm in his last lifetime. Therefore, his strong Spiritual Power and rich practical experience were his great advantages. He could make quick judgments on a Green-Fire Deer\u2019s movements and attacks. Then he could adjust his strategies flexibly.Thus, although a Green-Fire Deer was fast, it did not mean that the deer could beat Zhang Ruochen easily.\u201cHaa!\u201dZhang Ruochen roared at the Green-Fire Deer provocatively and aggressively.\u201cPhhf!\u201dThe Green-Fire Deer was outraged now, and his flames were becoming even brighter. In a second, it had almost reached the place where Zhang Ruochen was. It was so fast that it looked like a green shadow when it moved. Obviously, this Green-Fire Deer was planning to attack Zhang Ruochen with its giant body.But Zhang Ruochen bent his knees and exerted power by pushing off the ground. He jumped up seven meters high when the Green-Fire Deer was about to hit him.\u201cDragon in the Sky!\u201dHis running Genuine Qi was quickly moving inside his 11 Meridians. His body made a low-pitched sound which was like a dragon\u2019s roar. All his muscles and bones were functioning together now, unleashing great power through his palm.However, the Green-Fire Deer was too fast. Zhang Ruochen could not hit the Green-Fire Deer but hit the ground.\u201cPhhf!\u201dThe deer ran toward Zhang Ruochen like a green shadow. It used its antlers to attack him, targeting his chest.Zhang Ruochen unleashed power from his palm again and competed against the Green-Fire Deer.\u201cBang!\u201dA strong impact force hit his palm. Suddenly, he felt that his right arm had lost feeling.Zhang Ruochen quickly moved backward. He looked toward his arm and saw that his right palm was being burned by the fire from the deer. His sleeves were burnt to ashes, and his wrist and arm were exposed.His Genuine Qi was running inside his Meridians, gradually making his numb arm return back to normal.\u201cWhomp, whomp!\u201dThe Green-Fire Deer ran toward Zhang Ruochen again. Within a second, it had appeared in front of Zhang Ruochen.Right now, two Thunder Arrows were shot by the Ninth Commandery Princess, who was standing far away. These two arrows were shot toward the eyes of the deer.\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dThe deer had such a quick reaction that it hit the arrows back with its hard antlers.\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201dZhang Ruochen seized the opportunity and rushed toward the Green-Fire Deer. With the impact force of his body, Zhang Ruochen unleashed the Strength of Sixteen Bulls from his palm again, hitting on the head of the deer.The Green-Fire Deer whined and its head was bleeding. It was injured and the blood was coming out of the wound on top of its head, which slowed its reaction.\u201cPhew!\u201dAs the deer was distracted, the Ninth Commandery Princess got the chance to shoot the final Thunder Arrow at it. This time the arrow pierced through the deer\u2019s left eye.\u201cBang!\u201dThe arrowhead of the Thunder Arrow exploded and shredded the left side of its head. The Green-Fire Deer\u2019s left eyeball was turned into a mist of blood.Zhang Ruochen tumbled to reach the corpse of the Red Smilodon Tiger. He chipped off a sharp, half-meter-long tooth from its mouth.The injured Green-Fire Deer turned and ran away. The flames surrounding it went out as well.Zhang Ruochen grasped that broken tooth from the Red Smilodon Tiger. The tooth in his hand was like a short blade. He stepped on the tree trunk and leaped with the help of the elasticity of the tree trunk.\u201cCrack!\u201dZhang Ruochen stuck the sharp tiger tooth into the Green-Fire Deer\u2019s forehead and pierced it through the deer\u2019s skull.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Green-Fire Deer struggled, but finally, it failed. It fell down on the ground, becoming lifeless.Zhang Ruochen pulled out the tooth and stuck it into the abdomen of the Green-Fire Deer. All of this finally terminated the deer\u2019s life.The Ninth Commandery Princess came over and saw the corpse of the deer. She could not believe what she had just seen. \u201cNinth brother\u2026 you just killed a superior-class level-one savage beast.\u201dZhang Ruochen glanced at her and stood up. After simply binding up his burnt palm with some cloth, he said, \u201cNot me, but us.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess knew clearly that she had not offered sufficient help. If it was not for the hit on its head slowing the reaction of the deer, she could not have shot the deer\u2019s eye with her Thunder Arrow.However, she was happy because she was involved in the hunt of that superior-class level-one savage beast. More importantly, it was a successful hunt.She was so thrilled that she could not help hugging Zhang Ruochen.\u201cNinth brother, we are the best battle-buddies. We always cooperate so well!\u201dShe hugged Zhang Ruochen around the reck with her soft arms. Her big, soft boobs were pressed closely to his chest. She was so thrilled that she almost shoved him to the ground.Zhang Ruochen raised his arm and held the Ninth Commandery Princess by her shoulder, in order to keep some distance away from her. He said in a calm voice, \u201cWe should go back!\u201dSeeing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cold, indifferent face, she stamped her foot and frowned. \u201cI am your sister. I won\u2019t eat you. Could you just put away your arrogance?\u201dZhang Ruochen left the Roar Slope and mounted the antelope-horse. He glanced at the Ninth Commandery Princess and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dShe rolled her eyes and put her hand in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm to mount his antelope-horse. She sat behind him with her arms around his waist. Her exquisite face was on his back and she laughed. \u201cYour Majesty, would you mind taking your gorgeous sister to a peaceful place without any killings?\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head slightly. He steered the antelope-horse to exit the jungle and rushed to the Royal Coliseum.\u202626 out of the 43 young participants had come back, whilst the remaining 17 warriors were still missing.If a warrior had not come back, he would either have died somewhere, or he had not hunted any savage beast.\u201cMin, how\u2019s your hunt going?\u201d asked Concubine Huo, the biological mother of the Fifth Prince, Zhang Min.Wearing a smile on his face, Zhang Min said confidently, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m confident that nobody can be better than me in this King Mount hunt!\u201d\u201cWell done, Min.\u201d Concubine Huo nodded with a smile.Lin Fengxian looked at his daughter, Lin Ningshan, and asked, \u201cShan, it\u2019s your first time here. I assume that you have encountered many problems, right?\u201dLin Ningshan shook her head and confidently said, \u201cIt\u2019s easier than I expected. No problem at all. I\u2019m confident that I will be on the top 10 list.\u201dLin Ningshan looked toward King Mount. She realized that Zhang Ruochen had not yet come back, which made her even more proud. She secretly grinned.\u00a0\u201cSo, he hasn\u2019t hunted any savage beast. Well, that\u2019s reasonable. Taking those precious medicinal materials can strengthen his power. However, it can\u2019t enrich his practical experience.\u201dRight now, Concubine Lin was becoming nervous. She stared at King Mount wistfully.Later, more warriors came back.But those warriors looked worried. Apparently, they had not hunted any savage beast in King Mount.\u201cWhere are the Ninth Prince and Ninth Commandery Princess? Fingers crossed, they are okay.\u201dPeople started to worry about them because some young warriors had been killed by savage beasts in previous years\u2019 King Mount hunting.The Yunwu Commandery Prince frowned slightly and was about to send a troop of guards to look for his children.All of a sudden, there was a person shouting in the crowd. \u201cThey are back! The Ninth Prince and the Ninth Commandery Princess come back together!\u201dConcubine Lin, Lin Ningshan, and other princes and princesses looked towards King Mount. They saw these two young people coming from that direction, riding on the same antelope-horse. They were getting closer and closer.Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess got off the antelope-horse immediately after arriving at the Royal Coliseum. They walked toward their father, the Yunwu Commandery Prince.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.\u201cYour Majesty. Father!\u201d said the Ninth Commandery Princess.The Commandery Prince laughed, \u201cRuochen, why did you ride on Yuxi\u2019s horse?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess replied on behalf of Zhang Ruochen immediately, \u201cFather, brother Ruochen and I met an Iron Bull. My antelope-horse got injured, so I had to ask him for help.\u201dThe Commandery Prince stared at Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cIs that true, Ruochen?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty,\u201d he replied.The Commandery Prince nodded firmly. Suddenly, he saw that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s right arm had gotten injured. He said, \u201cRuochen, it\u2019s your first time here, and it\u2019s your first time battling with savage beasts. You just obtained your Sacred Mark three months ago, so don\u2019t be upset if you didn\u2019t hunt any savage beast.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI know!\u201dZhang Ruochen did not explain and he did not plan to explain. He just replied calmly.The Ninth Commandery Princess was about to say something. However, she could not find anything to say in this situation.The Fifth Prince and the Sixth Prince grinned secretly when they saw that Zhang Ruochen was injured.A hint of a smile played on Lin Ningshan\u2019s face as well. During the Year-end Assessment, Zhang Ruochen had been outstanding. However, when it came to a real battle with savage beasts, he was still far from good enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes were drawn to a name at top of the list. Gradually, a glimmer of a smile formed on his face. He said, \u201cGe Qian, why don\u2019t you announce the results of the King Mount Hunting Assessment this year? The first place warrior will be awarded a \u2018Heavy Bow\u2019!\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince then passed the booklet to Ge Qian.When the young warriors in the Coliseum heard that the prize for the winner of the second assessment would be a \u201cHeavy Bow\u201d, they became excited.The Heavy Bow was classified as a Fourth Class Genuine Martial Arms, worth more than 10,000 silver coins.To a young warrior, getting a Fourth Class Genuine Martial Arm was an honor. In fact, the Heavy Bow meant a lot more than just a valuable weapon. When the Yunwu Commandery Prince was young, he had won the King Mount Hunting Assessment and had been awarded a Heavy Bow.Who was going to be the winner of the King Mount Hunting Assessment?The kylin armor-clad general opened the booklet in his hand. He looked at the warriors in the Coliseum and said, \u201c43 warriors participated in the King Mount Hunting this year. Two of them died and nine failed the assessment. 32 warriors successfully hunted down a savage beast.\u201dThe general announced the ranking starting from the bottom. \u201cRanking 32nd, Situ Hai of the Situs. He hunted down an inferior-class level-one savage beast, a Lightning Rabbit.\u201d\u201cRanking 31st\u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cRanking 14th, the Sixth Prince, Zhang Mi, hunted four inferior-class level-one savage beasts: three Brute Bulls and one Lightning Rabbit.\u201dThe Sixth Prince frowned after hearing his result. He thought hunting down four inferior-class level-one savage beasts would put him in the top 10. He looked disappointed.\u201cI never expected it would be so competitive this year!\u201d the Sixth Prince said while looking at Zhang Ruochen. All of a sudden, the disappointment left his face. Rather, he had a hint of a smile.The Sixth Prince looked down on Zhang Ruochen, just as everyone else did. He believed that Zhang Ruochen was one of the nine warriors who had failed the assessment.Harassing Zhang Ruochen always made him feel better. He knew there was at least one person in the Royal Family who ranked lower than him.The general continued, \u201cRanking 10th, Lin Tianwu of the Lins hunted down five inferior-class level-one savage beasts: four Brute Bulls and one Lightning Rabbit.\u201dBrute Bulls and Lightning Rabbits were both savage beasts of the inferior-class level-one. Yet, the results obtained by hunting down either Brute Bulls or Lightning Rabbits was certainly different.The general went on, \u201cRanking ninth, Gu Li from the Gus captured five Brute Bulls.\u201d\u201cRanking eighth, Bai Wanli from the Bais. He hunted down six Brute Bulls, five of which were killed with Thunder Arrows. The sixth was killed by a martial technique from the Bais\u2013the \u2018Slaughter Fist\u2019. It is a mid-class martial technique of the Human Stage.\u201d\u201cRanking seventh, Lin Ningshan, also of the Lins, captured one savage beast of the medium-class level-one and four from the inferior-class level-one.\u201dLin Ningshan was quite satisfied after hearing her result. After all, she was only 15 years old and this was her first time joining King Mount Hunt. Her results fully demonstrated her talent.She held her head up high and looked down on Zhang Ruochen, just like the Sixth Prince Zhang Mi had.\u00a0\u201cThis is the first time for both of us to participate in the King Mount Hunt. Yet, he didn\u2019t hunt down any savage beasts. This is the difference between us!\u201d\u00a0she thought arrogantly.Lin Ningshan\u2019s performance definitely impressed the crowd. People started whispering, \u201cThe daughter of Lin Fengxian is absolutely outstanding! She hunted down a savage beast of the medium-class level-one at the age of 15! How talented! She is going to have a wonderful future!\u201d\u201cGive her two more years of practice, I\u2019m sure no one will be able to compete with her in the Year-end Assessment!\u201d\u201cWhoa!\u201d Suddenly, there was a gasp of amazement outside the Coliseum.Some of the warriors looked disdainful, such as Situ Linjiang, the number one genius of the Situs, as well as the Fifth Prince, and Xue Kai.All three of these warriors had cultivated to the Final State of the Yellow Realm, which was the most powerful skill level. All of them were competitive enough to be the hotshot winner.\u201cRanking sixth, Xue Hongqin from the Minister\u2019s Mansion hunted down two savage beasts of the medium-class level-one.\u201d\u201cRanking fifth, Luo Cheng from Zhennan General Mansion. He hunted two medium-class level-one savage beasts and one inferior-class level-one beast.\u201d\u201cRanking fourth, Xue Kai, also from the Minister\u2019s Mansion, captured three medium-class level-one savage beasts and two inferior-class level-one beasts.\u201dXue Kai was quiet and vacant when he heard his result. He could not believe he did not make it into the top three.He thought he would have been first or second.\u201cThis is absolutely miserable!\u201d said Xue Kai, with a cold-blooded look in his eyes and his fists firmly clenched.The Fifth Prince and Situ Linjiang smiled grimly when they heard Xue Kai only came in fourth. They knew the chances of either one of them winning the prize were higher since their strong competitor was not even in the top three. Yet, their smiles soon froze.\u201cRanking third, the Fifth Prince Zhang Min hunted down four medium-class level-one savage beasts and one inferior-class level-one beast.\u201d\u201cRanking second, Situ Linjiang from the Situs hunted five savage beasts of the medium-class level-one.\u201d\u201cRanking first, and the winner of King Mount Hunt is\u2026 the Ninth Prince, Zhang Ruochen! He hunted down one savage beast from the superior-class level-one and two from the medium-class level-one.\u201dAfter the announcement of the top three of the competition, every single person in the Royal Coliseum was completely shocked and speechless. They all stared at Zhang Ruochen. They could not believe that he had beaten all of the strongest warriors in the commandery capital.Within a second, the whole Royal Coliseum became a cacophony.\u201cOh my God! The Ninth Prince hunted down a superior-class level-one savage beast!\u201d\u201cYou know, every single one of the savage beasts of the superior-class level-one is as powerful as the highest of the Yellow Realm warriors. He has just reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. How did he manage to do that?\u201d\u201cThis is amazing! In just three months\u2019 time, his prowess has enabled him to hunt a savage beast of superior-class level-one! How incredible is this?\u201d\u2026In the Royal Coliseum, a lot of people were stunned and bewildered.In the last 10 years of Year-end Assessments, only the Seventh Prince was able to hunt down a savage beast of superior-class level-one. Now, the Ninth Price had become the first warrior to capture down a superior-class savage beast in a decade.The Yunwu Commandery Prince was ecstatic. \u201cGe Qian, get me the Heavy Bow now. I want to hand it over to my ninth son myself!\u201d he said, overjoyed.\u201cWait!\u201dZhang Ruochen walked out among all 43 warriors and said, \u201cHunting down the superior-class level-one savage beast wasn\u2019t just my work. The Ninth Commandery Princess and I both hunted it down together. I can\u2019t take all the credit.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess also walked out and stood next to Zhang Ruochen. She added, \u201cFather, I would not have made it through the King Mount Hunt without the help of my ninth brother. He saved me from the savage beast\u2019s claws! In fact, I didn\u2019t help much when he killed that superior-class savage beast!\u201d\u201cHaha! My ninth son, who should I give the Heavy Bow to? You tell me!\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince was even more pleased when he saw Zhang Ruochen and Zhang Yuxi were both humble.Zhang Ruochen responded, \u201cFather, please give the Heavy Bow to my ninth sister. I\u2019m good at fighting with a sword, not a bow. I may not be able to fully master it.\u201dZhang Ruochen did not wait for his father\u2019s approval. He grabbed the Heavy Bow and handed it to the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cRuochen\u2026 why\u2026?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess was completely flattered.Although she really wanted the Heavy Bow, deep down in her heart she knew that the bow did not belong to her.Zhang Ruochen casually replied, \u201cYou deserve it! Without your help, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill the Green-Fire Deer. Besides, we still have to fight in the Martial Arts competition. If I win the competition, the prizes will be even better!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 if you insist! When it comes to the Martial Arts competition, you have to put forth all your effort to win! With your ability, I\u2019m sure you will easily go into the top five.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess received the Heavy Bow joyfully. She gently stroked the black bow with her tiny, soft hands. Words could not express how pleased she was.Zhang Ruochen had good reasons to give the Heavy Bow to the Ninth Commandery Princess. First, she was there to help when he killed the Green-Fire Deer.Also, he wanted to befriend the Ninth Commandery Princess and turn her into an ally. Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin were isolated in the palace. Even though he had demonstrated some of his power, the distance between the real warriors and himself was still too great.Having an ally would surely improve their position.The third round was the Martial Arts competition.Only warriors who had successfully hunted down savage beasts were eligible to enter the third round of assessments.The top five competitors would receive a huge prize\u2014they would be allowed access to the Savage God\u2019s Pool for skill practice.The winner\u2019s rewards would be even better.Therefore, every warrior who entered the third-round was extremely fixated on the Martial Arts competition.The Fifth Prince groaned and said, \u201cMy Ninth Brother, you are definitely mysterious! Let\u2019s see who is the best in the drill ground!\u201dZhang Ruochen responded courteously, \u201cIf I do come across you in the drill ground, I\u2019m afraid we will have to fight.\u201dZhang Ruochen felt someone\u2019s eyes on him. He looked up and saw Lin Ningshan standing far away.Lin Ningshan was certainly beautiful. Her delicate features, glistening red lips, slender body, and long slim legs always stood out in a crowd.She had not anticipated the speed with which Zhang Ruochen\u2019s skill would rise in just three months. He was even able to kill a superior-class level-one Green-Fire Deer. Although she was one of the people who looked down on Zhang Ruochen, she respected what he had achieved so far.Yet, she had reached the realm of \u201cSword Following the Heart\u201d and attained the Low Class of Spiritual sword technique. If she had to fight against Zhang Ruochen in the drill ground, she was confident that she would defeat him.Those who finished in the top 10 of the King Mount Hunting Assessment would enjoy the advantage of skipping the preliminary contest and going directly to the second round.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe other 22 warriors would need to fight against each other head-to-head, and the top six competitors would enter the final. Altogether, 16 warriors would compete in the second round.After four hours, the preliminary contest had finally come to an end. Six warriors, including the Sixth Prince and the Ninth Commandery Princess, had made their way to the next round!The six winners, along with the top 10 in the King Mount Hunting Assessment, proceeded to the next round.\u201cWithout further ado, the final tournament now begins! Round one, the Ninth Commandery Princess, Zhang Yuxi, versus Lin Ningshan of the Lins,\u201d said the armor-clad general.No one expected that the first round would be a battle between the \u201cTwo Beauties in Yunwu City\u201d. It definitely intensified the entire competition. Everyone in the Coliseum was longing to watch this fight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0TransnBoth Lin Ningshan and the Ninth Commandery Princess, Zhang Yuxi, had just broken through to the Medium State of the Yellow Realm in the past three months. Their cultivations and abilities were fairly equal.The Ninth Commandery Princess stepped out onto the drill ground first, holding a green Genuine Martial Arms sword. Her elegance and delicate figure were as beautiful as an artist\u2019s painting, standing in the middle of the field.Then, Lin Ningshan also made her way out onto the drill ground.A smile touched the corners of Zhang Yuxi\u2019s lips as she said, \u201cNingshan, it is said that you have reached the realm of the Sword Following the Heart. I wonder how strong you are in mastering this technique. I can\u2019t wait to test you with it!\u201d\u201cClang!\u201dWithout further mockery, Zhang Yuxi waved her arm and the sword scabbard dashed out toward Lin Ningshan.\u201cBluewater Forming the Surge!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess clearly knew that Lin Ningshan was a powerful enemy and that she had to be extra careful fighting against her. Therefore, the technique that Zhang Yuxi used first was from the Mid Class of the Human Stage.By releasing the sword, seven shadows of the sword appeared, which gradually turned into 49.The 49 sword shadows eventually connected as a greenish-blue water curtain, while making a sound of flowing water it compressed and flew towards Lin Ningshan.Lin Ningshan stood solid and still, not moving an inch. She grabbed Zhang Yuxi\u2019s hand that held the sword and stared firmly into her eyes.When the water curtain pushed in front of Lin Ningshan, she thrust her sword right into the middle of the water curtain, and it was powerful enough to collapse every single one of Zhang Yuxi\u2019s techniques.\u201cPhhf!\u201dNinth Commandery Princess Zhang Yuxi realized that Lin Ningshan was going to quickly break down her technique, so she immediately changed to another approach. The sword techniques between the two beauties became sharper and intensified.Up to this point, Lin Ningshan was still unshakable. She stood completely still without moving a muscle in her legs as if she had turned into a statue.Lin Ningshan thought to herself,\u00a0\u201cI just need to thrust out a strong sword to break down all of her tactics.\u201dStanding outside of the drill ground, Zhang Ruochen slightly shook his head and thought,\u00a0\u201cLin Ningshan has already reached the realm of the \u2018Sword Following the Heart in terms of Sword Comprehension. Yet, Yuxi has been stuck on the technique of \u2018play it by ear\u2019. When it comes to a real fight, even though they are both in the same realm of Martial Arts, Yuxi is totally the weaker fighter. Within 10 moves, Yuxi is going to lose the fight!\u201dJust then, there was a tremendous change on the drill ground.Lin Ningshan actively attacked Zhang Yuxi. She moved one step forward and whipped her arms until there was a massive sword flower in the air.Zhang Yuxi could not counter and kept stepping backward. Lin Ningshan seized the opportunity to push her harder, step by step.\u201cPhhf!\u201dAfter all of the attacks and counterattacks from the beauties, Lin Ningshan\u2019s sword suddenly stopped. The sharp head of the sword was pointed right at the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s chest.Lin Ningshan said with satisfaction, \u201cPrincess, you have lost!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess retracted her Blue Water Sword and walked off the drill ground. She was upset and confused when she went over to Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cNinth brother, my cultivation is obviously above average. Why did I lose in such a short time?\u201d\u201cYour Sword Comprehension! In terms of Sword Comprehension, you still have a long way to go to catch up to her. Wait until you have put some effort into reaching the realm of the Sword Following the Mind, then you will eventually understand!\u201d Zhang Ruochen explained.Then the second fight began!The two warriors who were now standing in the middle of the fighting field were Gu Li from the Gu family and Situ Linhai, the first ever young genius from the Situ family.The distance between their abilities was very obvious. Situ Linhai kicked Gu Li out of the battlefield with just three moves. Gu Li did not even have a chance to fight back.\u201cThe fifth match\u2014the Ninth Prince, Zhang Ruochen, versus Bai Wanli from the Bai family,.\u201d the general announced the warriors coming up next.Zhang Ruochen and Bai Wanli stepped onto the drill ground at the same time.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s performance in the first two rounds was absolutely outstanding and it shocked several of the other warriors.He attracted attention from all of the warriors who had come for the Year-end Assessment. All of them were curious about how exceptional Zhang Ruochen\u2019s abilities were.Outside of the drill ground, Lin Ningshan, the Ninth Commandery Princess, the Fifth Prince, and the Sixth Prince were all looking at Zhang Ruochen. They wondered how a Dawn Stage warrior could beat a Medium State warrior.Bai Wanli ranked number eight in the King Mount Hunting Assessment. His cultivation had reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm. He was definitely a powerful warrior who could kill a Brute Bull barehanded.\u201cNinth Prince, you have mentioned that you are good at using the sword, and yet this is not my strongest technique. In order to be fair, let\u2019s fight without using any weapons. What do you say?\u201d Bai Wanli asked Zhang Ruochen.\u201cSure! Let\u2019s fight with our bare fists,\u201d Zhang Ruochen responded calmly, as if he did not care about winning or losing the fight.Outside of the drill ground, many warriors and spectators furrowed their eyebrows in confusion as they clearly knew that the Bais were masters of the fist technique. They could not understand why Zhang Ruochen agreed to do what Bai Wanli suggested.It was a fact that the cultivation of Zhang Ruochen was one realm weaker than Bai Wanli. On top of that, he had agreed to give up fighting with the sword technique that he was well versed in. He was very likely going to lose.\u201cSha!\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201d Bai Wanli yelled and shifted all of his Genuine Qi in his body, releasing the martial technique, \u201cSlaughter Fist\u201d, in the Mid Class of the Human Stage.\u201cBang!\u201dThe stone ground on the battlefield was shattered by Bai Wanli\u2019s powerful footstep. He suddenly rushed toward Zhang Ruochen and aimed his fist at his chest.With the power of the Human Stage Mid Class martial technique, Bai Wanli erupted with Strength of Nine Bulls. There was a layer of light, a halo, glimmering on his fist.Zhang Ruochen stood still with both legs slightly bent. The muscles in his legs, his back, and his arms\u2026 the power from every single part of his body all consolidated together.\u201cBang!\u201dThe moment all of the power transferred into Zhang Ruochen\u2019s fist, he thrust out solidly toward Bai Wanli and his fist collided with his slaughter fist.\u201cCrack!\u201dThe sound of bones fracturing echoed loudly!\u201cYou lose!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen moderately, who stood straight while looking at Bai Wanli.Bai Wanli held his arm painfully as if he had lost all the power in his broken arm. He took a few steps back, stared at Zhang Ruochen with panic, and asked, \u201cYou\u2026 you are powerful enough to resist my fist! How did you\u2026\u201dNot only Bai Wanli, but also the young warriors outside the drill grounds, were all confused about what they had just witnessed\u2014Zhang Ruochen just defeated the master of the fist technique!Even though Bai Wanli\u2019s fist had the Strength of Nine Bulls, Zhang Ruochen did not even have to use any martial technique and he shattered Bai Wanli\u2019s arm with just one fist!In the terms of a Dawn Stage warrior, this was impossible!Only the elder warriors, with an advanced cultivation of Martial Arts, would notice the clues from Zhang Ruochen.\u201cMaster Bai\u2019s arm isn\u2019t shattered but twisted out of its socket,\u201d said the general who was in the kylin armor.\u201cDislocated? How is that possible? I\u2019m sure the Ninth Prince only struck out with a palm. How did he manage to twist Bai Wanli\u2019s arm out of its socket?\u201d asked a young frustrated warrior.The general in the kylin armor explained,. \u201cThe mastery of the power of the Ninth Prince is sophisticated when he is at his best. The power from every inch of his muscles and bones all coalesced at the same time. Moreover, when he released his palm, the power of the palm technique actually carried the force of torsion.\u201cThe torsion disappeared within just a second. It is totally normal if you guys can\u2019t figure it out. Even with my cultivation, I still can\u2019t master my power to match Zhang Ruochen\u2019s finest!\u201dThe one who commented on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s technique with courtesy was Ge Qian, the royal guard of the Yunwu Commandery Prince. No one would question the truthfulness of what the experienced and respected person just said.\u201cI can\u2019t believe how powerful the Ninth Prince is! Oh my god\u2026 he just started practicing Martial Arts three months ago! I guess even the Seventh Prince isn\u2019t as incredible as him!\u201d\u201cAfter the Year-end Assessment this year, I\u2019m sure that the Ninth Prince\u2019s name will be scattered all over the commandery capital and he will become the most influential warrior of the young generation!\u201dZhang Ruochen left the drill ground embraced by the crowd\u2019s amazement.Three more fights had finished. The eight spots in the quarter-finals were finally confirmed.The top eight warriors were: the Fifth Prince, Situ Linjiang, Xue Kai, Zhang Ruochen, Lin Ningshan, Luo Cheng, Lin Tianwu, and the Sixth Prince.Following the quarter-final was the semi-final, which was the battle to strive into the top four.That meant that the warrior who won the next fight would surely enter the top five and also be given the opportunity to access the Savage God\u2019s Pool for practice.\u201cThe first round, the Ninth Prince, Zhang Ruochen, versus the Lin\u2019s Lin Ningshan,\u201d the general announced.When Zhang Ruochen heard that his opponent was Lin Ningshan, he lifted his head slightly and whispered, \u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201dHe then glanced at Lin Ningshan.At that moment, Lin Ningshan\u2019s sight had also fallen on Zhang Ruochen.The Ninth Commandery Princess, Zhang Yuxi, stood next to Zhang Ruochen, offered a smile, and said, \u201cNinth brother, I know you like Ningshan a lot but she doesn\u2019t like you! Therefore, don\u2019t be tender toward her, spare no effort in the fight and avenge my loss!\u201dZhang Ruochen calmly stepped onto the drill ground.\u201cOh, my cousin! I never imagined that you would acquire the Sacred Mark at the age of 16 and yet you still catch up at such a fast pace! Given that the best age of practicing Martial Arts has passed, your performance so far is indeed incredible!\u201d Lin Ningshan said softly with a slight smile on her pretty face.She stood opposite Zhang Ruochen elegantly, with her red lips chuckling, demonstrating a fresh and pure beauty.After watching the fight between Zhang Ruochen and Bai Wanli, Lin Ningshan was completely impressed by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s performance and she stopped looking down on him. She clearly knew that the warrior who was standing opposite her was no longer the crappy guy in her mind, but a genius of Martial Arts.Deep down in her heart, she had no confidence that she would defeat Zhang Ruochen. Indeed, she thought that Zhang Ruochen was scarier than the Fifth Prince, Situ Linhai, and Xue Kai in terms of his talent and technique in Martial Arts, which made her even more nervous.Of course, she did not believe that Zhang Ruochen would use any sword strike toward her since she knew Zhang Ruochen had always loved her.Back in the day, Zhang Ruochen had waited outside the Lin\u2019s Mansion for a whole night, on the coldest day in winter, in order to please her.The next morning, when she went outside the mansion to wake Zhang Ruochen up, she realized that his entire body had been frozen, being mindful of the fact that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s physical quality was fragile before the reborn \u201cZhang Ruochen\u201d acquired the Sacred Mark. After that night, his health got worse and, thus, resting in bed was the only thing that he could do.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnce in a while, she would see Zhang Ruochen with disdain. Even though he waited for her the whole night that winter, she considered Zhang Ruochen a fool who did not deserve her attention.However, it was a totally different story now. The Zhang Ruochen in the fighting field was a Genius of Martial Arts. At the thought of having a generally recognized genius love her, Lin Ningshan felt vainglorious, as if all the hatred had left her in a second.\u201cMy cousin, do you think we should fight? You should understand how much it means to me to go into the semi-final!\u201d Lin Ningshan said softly since she was trying to take advantage of his love for her.There was a sense of temptation in her glittering eyes as she looked delicately at Zhang Ruochen.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How about this? I\u2019ll fight without a sword!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dA sense of excitement welled up in Lin Ningshan\u2019s mind. \u201cWell, thank you for being so humble, my cousin.\u201dAs far as she was concerned, Zhang Ruochen had to be so loath to defeat her that he had proposed to fight empty-handed.She had no idea that Zhang Ruochen clearly knew that defeating her did not require a sword.The sword in Lin Ningshan\u2019s hand was the Splendor Sword, a Second Class Genuine Martial Arm.Once she took the combat sword out of the sheath, it immediately emitted radiance. The sword shone like a star and had bright spots flowing on its surface.Lin Ningshan\u2019s eyes sharpened. She activated the Genuine Qi inside her body and channeled it steadily into the blade. Her Qi stimulated the Inscription of Power Series and Inscription of Light Series forces in the sword.\u201cBoom!\u201dLin Ningshan took three steps forward, covering three meters with each bound. She moved first and stabbed toward Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest. A cyan sword flower bloomed out of thin air.Momentarily, the cold tip of the sword pointed at Zhang Ruochen.Lin Ningshan had defeated the Ninth Commandery Princess with the same sword technique. This sword technique was not easy to handle.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s thrust his foot against the ground, dodging to the right immediately.\u201cSwish!\u201dLin Ningshan changed her technique as well. With a twitch of her arm, she rotated the Splendor Sword in the air and made a backhand stab toward Zhang Ruochen\u2019s neck.The Splendor Sword had almost become a part of her, like an extension of her hand. Her technique was sophisticated and her control of the sword was complete.\u201cFloating Clouds and Flowing Water!\u201dLin Ningshan brought out a sword technique of the Mid Class of the Human Stage, stabbing toward Zhang Ruochen repeatedly.Her technique was elegant and gave off an intense light.\u201cWind Sweeping Away the Clouds!\u201d\u201cRain Stops and Clouds Show!\u201d\u2026Lin Ningshan used 13 sword techniques in a row. Every stab was well-executed, but they all failed to touch even the tail of his robe.Her Sword Comprehension, after all, had reached the Realm of \u201cSword Following the Heart\u201d. How could it take that long to defeat a warrior who had a weaker cultivation?\u201cParting Clouds!\u201dLin Ningshan used one last sword technique. Its power was so staggering that Zhang Ruochen was forced to retreat step by step. He almost reached the edge of the drill ground.The attack nearly pushed Zhang Ruochen out of the drill ground.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes emitted two rays of light. Suddenly, he stopped. He stared into the overwhelming sword light and squeezed his index finger and middle finger into a finger sword.All of a sudden, he unleashed his finger sword!\u201cBoom!\u201dThe finger sword had broken through the Sword Breath in the void and pointed at Lin Ningshan\u2019s chest.\u201cBoom!\u201dHe transferred his Genuine Qi through his fingers and struck Lin Ningshan. She fell to the ground three meters away.Zhang Ruochen stared coldly at Lin Ningshan on the ground and said, \u201cYou lose!\u201dLin Ningshan covered her chest with her hand. She gritted her beautiful teeth and stared at Zhang Ruochen with humiliation in her eyes. She grabbed her Splendor Sword and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t! Zhang Ruochen, let\u2019s keep fighting!\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head slightly and turned toward the exit of the drill ground. He did not want to keep arguing with a defeated opponent.\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dLin Ningshan had a grim look in her eye. She channeled all the Genuine Qi and resentment in her body to the Splendor Sword and cast the Low Class of Spiritual Sacred Sword Skill.All of a sudden, the Splendor Sword sprouted a meter-high light sword, emitting a huge stream of Sword Breath.She waved her arm and seven meters of Sword Breath stabbed toward Zhang Ruochen.When Lin Ningshan displayed this sword technique, the warriors gathered outside the drill ground were shocked.They could not believe that Lin Ningshan would attack the Ninth Prince from behind as he was leaving the drill ground. Furthermore, she used a sword technique of the Spiritual Stage, a much stronger power.Had the sword cut the Ninth Prince, he would have been a dead man.\u201cNingshan, stop!\u201d Lin Fengxian\u2019s countenance changed as he roared toward his daughter.If the Ninth Prince died under Lin Ningshan\u2019s sword, their family would be doomed!No one, however, expected that she would attack him after being defeated.Yet, it was too late to stop her.Everyone thought that Zhang Ruochen was going to die under Lin Ningshan\u2019s sword, but he shot into the sky to evade the Sword Breath from Lin Ningshan\u2019s sword.\u201cDragon in the Sky!\u201dZhang Ruochen had risen seven meters high in the air. He twisted his body, let out a dragon\u2019s roar, and his palm struck Lin Ningshan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cBoom!\u201dLin Ningshan\u2019s body shivered. She spat out a\u00a0mouthful of blood. Her legs trembled and she fell to the ground.Zhang Ruochen looked at Lin Ningshan laying in blood and callously shook his head. He was more than disappointed with his cousin.Lin Fengxian rushed over to the drill ground at once. He glanced at Zhang Ruochen and the Yunwu Commandery Prince. Then he begrudgingly said, \u201cThank you for your mercy, Ninth Prince.\u201dImmediately afterward, Lin Fengxian helped Lin Ningshan get up.He put his hands on Lin Ningshan\u2019s back. Lin Ningshan channeled a large volume of Genuine Qi into Lin Ningshan\u2019s body through his palms to help her condition of an injury.Indeed, Zhang Ruochen had shown mercy just now.If he had struck the top of her head instead of her shoulder, Lin Ningshan would have surely died.Lin Ningshan woke up. She opened her eyes and glanced at Zhang Ruochen with heavy resentment. \u201cZhang Ruochen, one day I will return double the humiliation you gave me today.\u201d She vowed to him.But Zhang Ruochen had already walked out of the drill ground.After Lin Fengxian helped Lin Ningshan get down off the stage, the competition continued.The following three competitions were: Situ Linjiang versus Lin Tianwu,the Fifth Prince versus the Sixth Prince,and last but not least, Xue Kai versus Luo Cheng.Lin Tianwu was another young master of Lin family. Although he was only 19 years old, he had reached the martial cultivation of the Medium State of the Yellow Realm.However, Situ Linjiang had already reached the cultivation of the Final State of the Yellow Realm. With only one blow, he struck Lin Tianwu out of the drill ground.The competition between the Fifth Prince and the Sixth Prince had ended with the Sixth Prince\u2019s surrender.The competition between Xue Kai and Luo Cheng was exciting.Although Luo Cheng had only reached the cultivation of the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, his martial technique was powerful enough to compete with Xue Kai.Eventually, the disparity in cultivation allowed Xue Ka to defeat Luo Cheng.So far, the top 4 of the Year-end Assessment this year had all emerged. They were Zhang Ruochen, the Fifth Prince, Xue Kai, and Situ Linjiang.Lin Ningshan, Luo Cheng, Lin Tianwu, and the Sixth Prince would have to compete for fifth place.The following competitions would be quite brutal. The Fifth Prince, Xue Kai, and Situ Linjiang were all in the Final State of the Yellow Realm. Zhang Ruochen was only in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm.\u201cNinth brother, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re in the top four. I definitely underestimated you before. Well, you won\u2019t be able to go any further. The gap between the Dawn State and the Final State is too big for you,\u201d the Fifth Prince said as he laughed.Zhang Ruochen took no notice of him. Instead, he closed his eyes and rapidly recharged his Genuine Qi.\u201cThe next competition: Zhang Ruochen, the Ninth Prince, versus Xue Kai from the Minister\u2019s Mansion.\u201dZhang Ruochen and Xue Kai simultaneously walked onto the drill ground.Xue Kai looked Zhang Ruochen over. He laughed and said, \u201cNinth Prince, if I\u2019m not mistaken, your specialty is swords.\u201d\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Zhang Ruochen responded.\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s fight with swords!\u201d Xue Kai stretched out his arm. Outside the drill ground, a young warrior from the Minister\u2019s Mansion handed him a long sword.Xue Kai had carefully scrutinized Zhang Ruochen\u2019s two previous competitions. He suspected that Zhang Ruochen ability with swords was a facade. Rather, his true specialty was palm techniques.After all, the palm techniques he showed in the last two fights had been astonishing. He did not seem to be a sword master at all.Palm techniques focused on strong power.Sword techniques, however, were about dexterity.Warriors would rarely combine these two abilities.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXue Kai, therefore, proposed to compete with Zhang Ruochen using swords.He believed that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s sword techniques would prove inferior to his own.\u201cNinth brother, take this!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess tossed her Blue Water Sword to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen took the Blue Water Sword. He held the handle of the sword and felt a draft of icy air emanating from it.\u201cA Third Class Genuine Martial Arms combat sword. There are three Inscriptions of Ice Series and three Inscriptions of Power Series engraved in this sword.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen estimated the grade of this sword just by holding it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sword in his hand immediately increased its weight to 175 kg.He held the sword with both hands, waving it valiantly. There was an oscillatory Qi billow wherever the sword went.His sword technique seemed simple, but it was efficient. It was not fancy, but every hit had shocking power.Zhang Ruochen also poured the Genuine Qi into the Blue Water Sword to activate an Inscription of Ice Series and an Inscription of Power Series. The sword emitted freezing ice into the air and the air filled with white frost.Zhang Ruochen knew that he did not have as much power as Xue Kai. He did not plan to confront the tough with toughness.Zhang Ruochen did some mysterious footwork while waving his sword. He dodged almost every attack.Meanwhile, Lin Fengxian, who stood outside the drill ground, watched Zhang Ruochen\u2019s footwork whole-heartedly. With surprise, he silently asked himself how he could be using the footwork of the Sacred Sword Skill?The sword techniques of the Spiritual Stage all had corresponding footwork.Only by combining it with footwork could the sword technique reveal its real power.Right now, the footwork that Zhang Ruochen used matched the Sacred Sword Skill exactly. Seeing Zhang Ruochen using this footwork, how could Lin Fengxian not be surprised?Xue Kai\u2019s sword was extremely heavy. Naturally, it consumed a great amount of Genuine Qi.As the battle continued, Xue Kai began to feel tired. There was sweat on his forehead and his Genuine Qi was halfway depleted.His original strategy had been to defeat Zhang Ruochen in a few movements. But after dozens of movements, he had not even touched Zhang Ruochen\u2019s sword.\u201cCrap!\u201cI fell for his trick!\u201d\u201cHe was depleting his energy and Genuine Qi on purpose.\u201dXue Kai drew back a part of his Genuine Qi the moment that he realized it. As he activated only one Inscription of Power Series, the heavy sword in his hands doubled in weight immediately!\u201cThis is high time.\u201dZhang Ruochen made a move!\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen waved his arm and struck and an eight-meter-long Sword Breath flew from the ground, leaving a sword path in Xue Kai\u2019s direction.Xue Kai did not see it coming. He had never expected that Zhang Ruochen could practice a sword technique of the Spiritual Stage.In haste, Xue Kai could only activate all his Genuine Qi and move his sword crosswise to counter.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Sword Breath hit the sword in Xue Kai\u2019s hands and threw him away. All his clothes were torn into pieces.When he fell back on the ground, he was outside the drill ground.Xue Kai looked at his bleeding hands, then glanced at Zhang Ruochen, who was standing upright on the drill ground. Bitterly, he acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019ve lost.\u201dWhen the battle ended, the audience could not recover from their shock.How could a warrior in the Final State of the Yellow Realm be beaten by one in the Dawn State?\u201cHe\u2019s really practicing the Sacred Sword Skill. It\u2019s impossible!\u201d Lin Ningshan was quite shocked. She could not believe that Zhang Ruochen could practice the Sacred Sword Skill. He even seemed better at it than she was.\u201cCould he be the mystery man we met at the Central Auction?\u201dLin Fengxian seemed serious, and said, \u201cIt is not that simple, Ningshan. Don\u2019t forget that the Sacred Sword Skill we bought is not the master copy, but a hand-written copy by a superior of the Heaven Realm.\u201d\u201cDaddy, do you mean that the reason for Zhang Ruochen\u2019s extremely fast practice speed is the strength of the Heaven Realm hiding behind him?\u201d Lin Ningshan asked in surprise.\u201cHush!\u201dLin Fengxian made a gesture to silence her, and said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s better to keep it in the family. We\u2019ll talk about it when we get back.\u201dLin Ningshan nodded. Her grudge expanded as she stared at Zhang Ruochen. \u201cNo wonder he could so easily dodge the \u2018Sacred Guiding Sword\u2019 that I used. He also practices this sword technique. How many secrets do you have, Zhang Ruochen?\u201d\u201cEven Xue Kai is defeated?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the Ninth Prince has practiced a sword technique of the Spiritual Stage. It is fair that he defeated Xue Kai.\u201d\u201cThe Ninth Prince must have reached the realm of \u2018Sword Following the Heart\u2019. He is indeed a genius of sword techniques.\u201d\u2026No one dared to look down upon the Ninth Prince. Instead, they treated him like an incredible genius martialist. Some even thought his talent was as great as the Seventh Prince\u2019s.The following battle was the Fifth Prince versus Situ Linhai.The Fifth Prince was 19 years old and had reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm with a Third Class Sacred Mark.Situ Linhai, the first genius of the Situs, was 17 years old and had also reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm with a Fourth Class of Blaze Sacred Mark.Situ Linhai had his own reputation within the young generation of the entire Yunwu City. With his talent, he even had the chance to break through to the Completion of the Yellow Realm and reach the Black Realm before the age of 20.Situ Linhai carried a long black spear, standing on the drill ground proudly. He stared at the Fifth Prince across from him and exclaimed with confidence, \u201cFifth Prince, you are no match for me!\u201dThe Fifth Prince said, \u201cWe are both in the Final State of the Yellow Realm. It will not be easy for you to win.\u201d\u201cYou should know better than anybody else that my Genuine Qi has the power of Blaze. I have a Fourth Class of Blaze Sacred Mark. I have no equal in the same realm. You won\u2019t last 10 movements against my spear with your cultivation.\u201d Situ Linhai\u2019s eyes were firm and sharp, full of confidence.Warriors with natural Sacred Marks were indeed more powerful than those with normal Sacred Marks in the same realm.\u201cReally? We should let the battle decide who is stronger.\u201d The Fifth Prince picked up the combat sword in front of him, then activated his Genuine Qi to move fast through his 12 Meridians. He poured all of it into the sword.\u201cPhhf!\u201dHe activated three inscriptions in the sword.It immediately radiated out a one-meter-high light.The Fifth Prince made a move proactively, using a sword technique of the Mid Class of the Human Stage. He waved the combat sword continually to form a vortex of sword light and cleaved at Situ Linhai.To obtain a shining rank in the drill ground of the Year-end Assessment, most of the young warriors had learned at least one, or often several, martial techniques of the Mid Class of the Human Stage. They wanted to achieve fame with one battle in the Year-end Assessment.The Fifth Prince was no exception. He had spent half a year practicing the Heaven Light Sword Skill, a martial technique of the Mid Class of the Human Stage. It contained eight movements in total, and the Fifth Prince had mastered three of them.\u201cThe Heaven Light Sword Skill is mediocre,\u201d Situ Linhai said with a sneer.Situ Linhai seemed at ease under the Fifth Prince\u2019s continuous attack. He waved the long black spear to counter back the Fifth Prince\u2019s every hit.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dThe long spear hit the combat sword and sparks flew out.\u201cSword of Cloud and Rain.\u201dThe Fifth Prince shouted, then he jumped into the sky about six meters high, holding the hilt with both hands, and cleaved.The light of the combat sword became brighter, like a shower of illumination, falling on Situ Linjiang.Situ Linjiang had developed 13 Meridians, one more than that of the Fifth Prince.The Genuine Qi moved fast in Situ Linjiang\u2019s 13 Meridians, gathering at his hands.His hands looked like a burning flame, and the flame rushed to the long black spear, activating the power of the three Inscriptions of Fire Series at the same time.\u201cFire Snake!\u201dThe Flame Snake Spear Technique was a martial technique of the Superior Class of the Human Stage.The spear thrust like a fire snake, breaking all of the sword radiance made by the Fifth Prince.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Fifth Prince flew backward. His royal boa robe caught on fire, burning to ashes immediately.Situ Linhai rushed forward and thrust his spear again. The end of the long spear hit the Fifth Prince in the chest, knocking him out of the drill ground.With a trace of blood in the corner of his mouth, the Fifth Prince raised himself from the ground and stared at Situ Linjiang, who was standing at the center of the drill ground like a reincarnate Spear God. He declared. \u201cFlame Snake Spear Technique! Terrific! If you had practiced it from the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t have lasted three movements.\u201dThe spear technique that Situ Linjiang had just used was extremely amazing. He definitely had reached the Realm of \u201cSpear Following the Heart\u201d. Plus, with the power of Blaze in his Genuine Qi, he had virtually no equal in the Final State of the Yellow Realm.Outside the drill ground, Mo Hanlin said mildly, \u201cOnly the Ninth Prince and Situ Linjiang stand now! It seems appropriate that Situ Linjiang is the strongest of the Situ\u2019s young generation. Maybe we won\u2019t need the final battle.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Qin Ya blinked. Her eyelashes were long and neat. The charming light in her beautiful eyes could attract any man at any time.Mo Hanlin said, \u201cWith his cultivation, Situ Linjiang is absolutely a young superior who has no equal even in the Final State of the Yellow Realm. Although the Ninth Prince is a greater genius than Situ Linjiang, he is only at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. He could beat Xue Kai, but beating Situ Linjiang is out of the question.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlmost everyone present was of the same opinion.They admitted that the Ninth Prince was a Genius of Martial Arts, but they would not believe that he could beat Situ Linjiang right now.\u201cIf the Ninth Prince had another year to practice Martial Arts, it would be easy for him to beat Situ Linjiang. But as of now, there is still a gap.\u201dA small smile showed on Qin Ya\u2019s red lips as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t bet on it. A genius is called a genius because they can create miracles. I hope the Ninth Prince can create a miracle. If that\u2019s the case, I will have even more interest in him! Hehe!\u201dQin Ya\u2019s eyes narrowed a bit, like two bright crescents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet, nobody dared to look down on him now, including Situ Linjiang, who stood across from him.\u201cFight!\u201dSitu Linjiang groaned, and in the meantime, poured his Genuine Qi into the long spear.The long black spear was covered with flames like a fire snake, thrusting toward Zhang Ruochen.Situ Linjiang clearly knew that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation and power were far beneath his own. But Zhang Ruochen\u2019s control over his Genuine Qi and power was subtle, so he was unsettled by that.If he wanted to defeat Zhang Ruochen, he had to attack fiercely so that he would not have the chance to fight back.As long as Zhang Ruochen had no chance to attack, he would surely be the winner!Situ Linjiang was indeed far more powerful than Xue Kai, and his spear technique was also perfect. But Zhang Ruochen stayed calm as usual, so there was not a trace of fear or panic on his face.\u201cFire Snake!\u201dThe spearhead was chasing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back like a fire snake, aiming at his heart.Zhang Ruochen lowered his body to dodge the long spear, then suddenly he thrust the Blue Water Sword directly at Situ Linjiang\u2019s right hand, which was holding the spear.Situ Linjiang stepped back to duck the attack, then he struck back. He used the spear as a stick and slashed at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head.Sparks fell on Zhang Ruochen before the long spear hit him. They burned little black holes on his royal boa robe.Zhang Ruochen whispered to himself, \u201cSuch a fast response!\u201dThere was no time to dodge it now.\u201cSacred Bell Sword!\u201dThe 11 Meridians inside Zhang Ruochen had all displayed. His Genuine Qi kept injecting into the Blue Water Sword ceaselessly to activate the two Inscriptions of Ice Series in it.He twisted his body and countered with his sword crosswise.\u201cBoom!\u201dA nattier blue, bell-like shadow covered Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body, and it spun fast, emitting freezing icy air.Situ Linjiang cleaved the shadow\u2019s surface with his spear, but a powerful force stopped him from breaking the shadow.\u201cHe countered my attack!\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dThe power of re-bounce made Situ Linjiang\u2019s arm numb.At this moment, Zhang Ruochen rushed from the Bell Sword and wielded his sword at Situ Linjiang, causing an eight-meter-long Sword Breath.\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dAnother sword technique of Low Class of Spiritual.Situ Linjiang\u2019s face slightly changed. He immediately drew back to duck the Sword Breath, he then roared and thrust the spear at Zhang Ruochen again.\u201cClap!\u201dThe speed was so fast that it caused violent friction between the Blaze Spear and the air. The spearhead was burnt in red, dropping grains of sparks.Zhang Ruochen did not counter Situ Linjiang directly. Instead, he jumped into the air to evade the attack.\u201cStupid! One can\u2019t borrow power to move when one is in midair. It makes you an easy target. How can you dodge my next attack?\u201dThen Situ Linjiang seized the chance. He also jumped into the air and stabbed Zhang Ruochen at his chest.\u201cWho says I can\u2019t borrow power? I\u2019ll use yours!\u201dZhang Ruochen waved his sword continually, hitting the spear.\u201cBang, Bang!\u201dEvery time the Blue Water Sword hit the long spear, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s direction shifted a bit. In the blink of an eye, Zhang Ruochen hit the long spear nine times with his sword.When the ninth hit was over, Zhang Ruochen was below Situ Linjiang. Now, Situ Linjiang was in midair, becoming an easy target for Zhang Ruochen.All those nine hits happened in a flash. Without a keen eye, one could only see a series of sword glints but had no idea of what was really going on.\u201cCrap!\u201dSitu Linjiang panicked. He did not expect that Zhang Ruochen could control his power in such an amazing way.In just a blink, the situation was reversed.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen thrust the sword.The icy air covered the Blue Water Sword. A layer of Ice Crystals wrapped its body. The cutting edge of the sword emitted white icy air.At this moment, Situ Linjiang had not reached the ground. He could not borrow power and, thus, he could not dodge.\u201cFire Snake\u2019s Eyes!\u201dSitu Linjiang clenched his teeth and also thrust his spear. The Power of Blaze broke out from the spearhead.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe combat sword and the long spear hit each other. The icy air and the flame collided and made a loud crash of metal.A great power went to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s arm through the sword, sending him seven steps backward.Situ Linjiang was in a more embarrassing situation. He was thrown backward and almost fell to the ground. Fortunately, he managed to hit the ground with his spear at the last moment. With the help of the reaction force, he landed smoothly on his feet.He did not realize that his right sleeve was frozen until he got a firm foothold. He activated the Genuine Qi inside and shook his arm. The sleeve broke apart at once and fell to the ground as pieces of ice.They went on fiercely fighting without stopping.An old eunuch wearing a cyan uniform, who was standing behind the Yunwu Commandery Prince, said in surprise, \u201cThis is a true battle between young geniuses. It\u2019s eye-opening! Like father, like son! Although the Ninth Prince is only at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, he is fighting neck-and-neck with Situ Linjiang from the Situs. That is incredible!\u201d\u201cRight! A great talent takes time to cultivate. The Ninth Prince\u2019s future achievements are beyond our imagination. Congratulations, Your Majesty. There is another great genius in the Royal Family.\u201d A senior general wearing armor flattered him from below.Hearing all the compliments, the Yunwu Commandery Prince was surely happy. The truth revealed itself. The Ninth Prince did have an incredible talent in Martial Arts. Had they been in the same realm, the first young genius of the Situs might have lost already!What kind of father would not be happy when his son had incredible talent in practice?The Yunwu Commandery Prince said with a smile, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have such great power by chance. Haven\u2019t you noticed that although he is only at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, he\u2019s already developed 11 Meridians?\u201d\u201cWhat? One at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm can develop 11 Meridians?\u201dThe concubines, eunuchs, princes, princesses, generals, and ministers all stared at Zhang Ruochen, who was on the drill ground.If Zhang Ruochen did not activate his Genuine Qi, nobody could quantify his Meridians. But when he was fighting Situ Linjiang, Zhang Ruochen had to give it his all. The quantification of his Meridians was exposed immediately.Of course, only the powerful elder warriors were capable to see through it.\u201c11 Meridians! Really? Is Ninth Brother that strong? I remember that my Seventh Brother only developed 10 Meridians when he was at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess was so shocked that her pretty eyes were wide open.If that was not said by the Yunwu Commandery Prince, she would not have believed that there was someone even more talented than the Seventh Prince in the entire Yunwu Commandery.The more Meridians that a warrior developed, the more powerful his Body of Martial Arts became, and hence, the more potential he obtained.Taking the Fifth Prince as an example\u2014He was at the Final State of the Yellow Realm, but he had only developed 12 Meridians. Therefore, even if he had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, he could only develop 15 Meridians at most.Which meant that even if he could reach the Black Realm or the Earth Realm in the future, he would only have 15 Meridians inside his body. He surely could not compete with warriors that had 16 or 17 Meridians.The more Meridians the warriors of the Yellow Realm developed, the more potential they gained.Of course, one with 15 Meridians was already more powerful than most warriors.\u201c11 Meridians! He has developed 11 Meridians when he is only at the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. How could it be possible? Does that mean that he has more potential than the Seventh Prince?\u201d Lin Fengxian was shocked. He did not at all expect that Zhang Ruochen could be such a genius.This was beyond genius.Lin Ningshan asked, \u201cFather, has he really developed 11 Meridians?\u201dLin Fengxian nodded with regards. Had he known the Ninth Prince\u2019s amazing talent, he would not have been such a jerk when Concubine Lin went back to the Lin\u2019s Mansion to beg him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe should not have betrothed Lin Ningshan to the Seventh Prince. After all, she could only be a concubine at best if she married the Seventh Prince. There was no chance for her to be a Lady.But if he had betrothed Lin Ningshan to the Ninth Prince, considering the Ninth Prince\u2019s former love for her and their kinship as cousins, she would definitely be a Lady. If they could help the Ninth Prince to become the successor to the throne, the Lins would have much greater influence in the Yunwu Commandery in the future.But it was too late now!\u201cWho said the Ninth Prince couldn\u2019t defeat Situ Linjiang? Can\u2019t you see that the victory still hangs in the balance! Hehe!\u201d Qin Ya smiled.Mo Hanlin nodded. \u201cShowing a great talent like this, the Ninth Prince may obtain a higher achievement than the Seventh Prince.

The sword shadow and spear collided with each other, which let out a deafening bang.\u201cBoom!\u201dGripping a long spear in his hands, Situ Linjiang stabbed it into the ground, shattering the flagstone, turning it into gravel instantly. He spun his spear and then all of the gravel flew toward Zhang Ruochen.\u201cBang, Bang!\u201dZhang Ruochen swung his sword and chopped straight down.All of the gravel was smashed and altered into stone powder immediately.Then Situ Linjiang seized his chance and tried to stab at the chest of Zhang Ruochen through the stone powder.While Situ Linjiang was immersed in complacency since he thought he was sure to win, his eyes then blurred suddenly and a sword shadow flashed before him. All he saw was a streak of blue sword radiance.Then Situ Linjiang felt a pain in his wrist. His long black spear slipped out of his grip and flew from his hand.It was Zhang Ruochen who left a deep wound on his wrist, very close to cutting off his right hand.\u201cI still have a chance to win!\u201d Situ Linjiang said to himself.Situ Linjiang was being absent-minded when his long spear flew out of his fist. He immediately sobered and dashed toward Zhang Ruochen. This time, Situ Linjiang intended to plant his fist in the face of Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen realized that Situ Linjiang was going to strike to win!\u201cWant another round of fighting?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.With one hand holding his sword, Zhang Ruochen used his other hand to use the first palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, Elephant Galloping. He bent his body and charged forward. After giving one palm, he unleashed the Strength of Sixteen Bulls.When Zhang Ruochen shook his arm, a loud screech broke out from the Blue Water Sword. It looked like the landscape of a white rainbow crossing the sun, casting seven sword shadows onto the ground.\u201cThe Sacred Sword Skill! The Sacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dBy integrating his palm technique with his sword technique, Zhang Ruochen used them at the same time.It was almost like Zhang Ruochen had split into two, and he made the attack simultaneously and smoothly with each hand.His fighting capacity was suddenly doubled.\u201cBoom!\u201dWhen Situ Linjiang\u2019s fist made contact with Zhang Ruochen\u2019s fist, he was surprised to find that the palm strength of Zhang Ruochen was quite violent and the equivalent to his fist.After all, Situ Linjiang could manifest the Strength of Sixteen Bulls. He wondered if Zhang Ruochen could also break out such awesome power.Situ Linjiang had no time to really think about it since Zhang Ruochen was thrusting his sword toward him again.\u201cPhhf!\u201dA blast of sharp Sword Breath whipped through Situ Linjiang, leaving a red sword mark on his neck.Zhang Ruochen easily shifted between his palm and sword, forcing Situ Linjiang to keep stepping back.Situ Linjiang had never seen someone separate his left hand from his right hand. They could work independently without any difficulty. He thought that it was like contending with two incarnations of Zhang Ruochen, thus landing himself in a defensive position.It was not long before he had another two wounds caused by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s sword.\u201cI\u2019ve failed!\u201dSitu Linjiang gave in and had no intention to continue fighting.Zhang Ruochen stopped his attack and withdrew his sword, planning to exit the drill ground.Situ Linjiang asked, \u201cCan you tell me how you were able to accomplish that level of multitasking? One hand for the palm, the other hand for the sword? It seems impossible.\u201dTurning around, Zhang Ruochen glanced at Situ Linjiang and answered, \u201cWhen your Spiritual Power is strong enough, you are able to do two, three, or even four things at the same time.\u201d\u201cDo warriors also need to practice their Spiritual Power?\u201d Situ Linjiang asked.\u201cYou can practice if you want. You can choose not to practice if you want. Your choice is your own,\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied coolly.In Kunlun\u2019s Field, only weapon refiners, alchemists, and tamers often practiced their Spiritual Power.Only after your Spiritual Power had become strong enough would you be able to depict the inscription and refine the Genuine Martial Arms and panaceas. In the meantime, only when one\u2019s recorded inscription was in the body of the savage beast were you able to tame them to be your flying mount or warbeast.Generally speaking, warriors did not bother with practicing their Spiritual Power as it was a time-consuming process.Actually, with the enhancement of Martial Arts cultivation, a warrior\u2019s Spiritual Power would also improve, but fairly slowly.If the warrior did not practice their Spiritual Power purposely, they would not attain that level of Multitasking until they arrived at the Heaven Realm.In his last lifetime, Zhang Ruochen practiced both his Martial Arts and Spiritual Power. Notably, the strength of his Spiritual Power had entered into a high realm.In this lifetime, he had been reborn into this weak body. Although he had lost all of his cultivation, his Spiritual Power had been retained.With his present Spiritual Power level, he could achieve Multitasking, doing even three things at one time.When Situ Linjiang gave up the battle, the sound of a triton\u2019s trumpet and a war drum came from the military drill ground, which officially announced an end to this year\u2019s Year-end Assessment.Arranged from high to low, the top five for the Year-end Assessment were: Zhang Ruochen, Situ Linjiang, Xue Kai, the Fifth Prince, and Lin Ningshan.The top five young geniuses would get an extra reward besides the opportunity to practice in the Savage God\u2019s Pool.Zhang Ruochen obtained the armor of a sixth-class Genuine Martial Arm called the Ice-fire Kylin Armour. Recognized for its great value and amazing defensive power, it was said to be refined from the scales of the king of the savage beasts, a kylin.When compared to a warrior from the same class, the armor was considered more valuable than the soldier.Namely, the value of the armor of a sixth-class Genuine Martial Arm was equal to a soldier of the seventh-class Genuine Martial Arm.\u201cAt a cost of at least a million silver coins, this Ice-fire Kylin Armor is comparable to a martial technique of the Low Class of the Spiritual. It\u2019s even scarce for the Royal Family in the Yunwu Commandery. I can\u2019t believe such a treasure was given to me as a reward for first place.\u201d Zhang Ruochen was astonished and looked at the Yunwu Commandery Prince, who was standing on the top.After pondering for just a moment, he understood immediately.After all, Zhang Ruochen was the son of the Yunwu Commandery Prince. The precious Ice-fire Kylin Armor, though it was presented to him, still technically belonged to the Royal Family.If Situ Linjiang had ranked first place, he would not have been rewarded the same treasure. It would have been another treasure, inferior to the Ice-fire Kylin Armor.Perhaps the Yunwu Commandery Prince felt regret for Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin, thus rewarding the Ice-fire Kylin Armor to Zhang Ruochen as a form of compensation for his faults over the past years.The Ice-fire Kylin Armor was an armor that only covered one\u2019s upper body. When Zhang Ruochen injected his Genuine Qi into the armor, the Ice-fire Kylin Armor appeared blue and red instantly, emitting a combined power of icy cold and roaring flame.\u201cHumph!\u201dUpon seeing Zhang Ruochen wearing the Ice-fire Kylin Armor, the queen, sitting at the top, pulled a long face and looked quite serious. With a murderous intent flashing across her eyes, she stood up from her seat.The queen swung her sleeves and turned away, turning her back on the drill ground.The Fifth Prince and the Sixth Prince all glared at Zhang Ruochen with great jealousy and admiration.Harboring resentment in his heart, the Fifth Prince said with a grim smile, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how gifted he is in practice. The more outstanding he does, the sooner he will die. Wait and see. I believe our queen won\u2019t let him reach his potential!\u201d\u201cEven if he is extremely talented, he still falls far behind our Seventh Brother. Huh! Even his favorite woman will marry our Seventh Brother as his side imperial concubine. That\u2019s nothing.\u201d The Sixth Prince laughed coldly.Actually, they just spoke out of jealousy. However, jealousy was the source of their hatred.\u2026The Savage God\u2019s Pool was one of the most precious and treasured places of the Royal Family.It took hundreds of years for the pool to catch tens of thousands of savage beasts and to collect their blood from the past, which then changed into a vast blood pool. That was why it was named the Savage God\u2019s Pool.Only the most outstanding geniuses were allowed to practice in the Savage God\u2019s Pool.The Savage God\u2019s Pool was beneath the Imperial Ancestral Temple.The Ceremony of Worship was held annually in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, where people would kill savage beasts to replenish the Savage God\u2019s Pool with fresh blood.A mysterious power came into being when the blood from the sacrifice blended with the Savage God\u2019s existing pool. Therefore, the young warriors who practiced in the Savage God\u2019s Pool absorbed the essence of blood, and it would build up their body of Martial Arts, opening up more Meridians.The greater the talent of the warrior, the more benefits he would gain.Under the guidance of the minister, Zhang Ruochen, Situ Linjiang, Xue Kai, the Fifth Prince, and Lin Ningshan were brought to the Imperial Ancestral Temple.\u201cAnyone who enters the Imperial Ancestral Temple should kowtow to the great emperors and queens of the past in Kunlun\u2019s Field. Everyone should show respect to them, especially to the Holy Queen of Majesty and Morality, Empress Chi Yao, my lord! She governs the world and enjoys the majesty in all directions. Wish her a forever young and eternal life!\u201dThe minister was piously praying and reading aloud while kneeling on the ground.\u201cEmpress Chi Yao, my lord! She governs the world and enjoys the majesty that is in all directions. Wish her a forever young and eternal life!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSitu Linjiang, Xue Kai, the Fifth Prince, and Lin Ningshan read and prayed. They knelt and kowtowed to the stone statue of Empress Chi Yao.Only Zhang Ruochen stood still showing no respect but was filled with a bitter hatred for her.\u201cChi Yao, wait for me. I will come to see you when I succeed in my cultivation,\u201dZhang Ruochen thought to himself.\u201c800 years have passed. You probably don\u2019t know that the one you killed 800 years ago was reborn anew!\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he walked step by step along the stone ladder behind the door toward the Savage God\u2019s Pool.The Fifth Prince, Situ Linjiang, Xue Kai, and Lin Ningshan stood up and glanced at Zhang Ruochen.\u201cIt\u2019s his untamed characteristic that will hurt him sooner or later!\u201d Situ Linjiang slightly shook his head.After the fight with Zhang Ruochen, Situ Linjiang had come to admire him for his Martial Arts talents. But Zhang Ruochen was so haughty that he should not worship the empress. He would get into big trouble in the future.\u201cWho do you think you are? You just have the cultivation of the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, which can only be counted as the initial stage of Martial Arts. No one can predict whether or not he will be a superior in the future!\u201d said Lin Ningshan.Then, led by the minister, the Fifth Prince, Situ Linjiang, Xue Kai, and Lin Ningshan also walked down the stone ladder and entered into an underworld filled with the smell of blood.In the center of the underworld, there was a giant bloody sacred pool, with both a length and width of more than 100 meters.The bloody waves ceaselessly surged with the rolling pool water.In the center of the blood pool stood an ancient altar made of tons of megaliths with epitaphs and patterns on each of them.A stone table extended straight up to connect the altar on earth.\u201cIt\u2019s time for all of you to practice in the Savage God\u2019s Pool. Please keep in mind that due to the strong power of blood in it, leave it as soon as possible when you can\u2019t stand anymore. Otherwise, it may be life-threatening,\u201d the minister sternly warned.The five young geniuses, Zhang Ruochen, Lin Ningshan, Situ Linjiang, the Fifth Prince, and Xue Kai, walked into the Savage God\u2019s Pool in turns.The water in the Savage God\u2019s Pool seemed hot enough to boil people.\u201cOuch!\u201dThe five young geniuses groaned when the pool water touched their skin and melted them. Immediately, their legs became mangled and bloody.They bit the bullet and held on by operating their internal Genuine Qi to defend against the Power of Blood.\u201cIf you operate Genuine Qi to defend against the Power of Blood, you will stop it entering into the body,\u201d the minister casually said at the poolside.In order to acquire the Power of Blood of the Savage God\u2019s Pool, the five young people had to withdraw their external Genuine Qi. At that time, the familiar painful feeling appeared again to make their Meridians exposed.Due to the strong Spiritual Power, Zhang Ruochen clearly detected that a trace of the hot Power of Blood entered into his body through the wounds and integrated into his blood and bones.\u201cIt is indeed the Power of Blood! Hurray! With it, my physical quality is certain to be improved a lot! I need to take this chance!\u201dSlowly, as he closed his eyes, Zhang Ruochen walked to the center of the Savage God\u2019s Pool step by step.The farther that he walked in, the deeper the water became.After only 10 steps, the bloody water has reached Zhang Ruochen\u2019s waist.The more that he touched the water, the faster the absorption speed of the Power of Blood became. Meanwhile, the pain grew stronger as well.The minister at the poolside was surprised by him and marveled, \u201cAwesome! How strong his willpower is, to walk into the central area the first time entering the pool\u2026 When the Seventh Prince first entered the Savage God\u2019s Pool to practice, it took him two hours to adapt to the shallow area before he went into the central area.\u201dThere were three areas of the Savage God\u2019s Pool: the shallow area, the central area, and the deeper area.The shallow area was also known as the boundary of the Savage God\u2019s Pool, in where the deepest area could just only reach the knee of the warrior.Generally speaking, the first time practicing in the pool, a warrior could only stand in the shallow area. None of them dared to enter the central area.In the last decade, only the Seventh Prince walked into the central area his first time going into the pool.The fact that Zhang Ruochen walked straight toward the central area his first time in the pool indeed shocked people there and caused great pressure on the other four young warriors.It was the second time for the Fifth Prince to practice in the Savage God\u2019s Pool. However, he was still afraid of the central area and stubbornly stayed in the shallow area to take in more Power of Blood to refine his body and build his physical quality.Four hours later, Lin Ningshan was the first to leave the Savage God\u2019s Pool. After all, the female physical quality could hardly compare to that of male warriors.After she left the Savage God\u2019s Pool, the burnt skin of her legs began to heal at a speed visible to the eye. Shortly afterward, they became as flawless as the smooth surface of jade.The insufferable pain disappeared and was replaced with a feeling akin to being immersed in Ice Crystals and milk, which gave her a comfortable feeling that was cool and refreshing.\u201cHow could I recover so fast?\u201d Lin Ningshan was surprised.\u201cIt is the absorbed Power of Blood that helped you recover from the condition of an injury on your legs! Practice, right now. Try your best to refine the Power of Blood into your own power. Otherwise, all your previous cultivation effects will be greatly diminished,\u201d said the minister.Lin Ningshan sat with legs crossed at once and operated Genuine Qi to refine the Power of Blood that remained internally.Xue Kai also quit an hour later and walked out of the Savage God\u2019s Pool.Four hours later, Xue Kai, Situ Linjiang, and the Fifth Prince quit almost at the same time.The moment they walked out of the Savage God\u2019s Pool, they began to sit with legs crossed in order to refine the Power of Blood.Now, Zhang Ruochen was the only one that still practiced in the Savage God\u2019s Pool. Furthermore, he was in the central area.\u201cAmazing! A half day has passed and he still practices in the central area. At that time, the Seventh Prince could only hold on for one day. Incredible!\u201d\u00a0The minister was visibly awed by this.In the Yunwu Commandery, the Seventh Prince, who had opened the seventh-class Sacred Mark at the age of three, could be considered a rare genius, once in a blue moon. He had been using various treasure comprehension abilities to refine his body from childhood, which laid a solid foundation for Martial Arts practice. His talent and perception could be considered number one.Could the Ninth Prince, who just opened the Sacred Mark at 16, be compared with him?After transforming the remaining Power of Blood, Lin Ningshan, Xue Kai, Situ Linjiang, and the Fifth Prince all refined their physical quality, showing that they had benefited a lot from it.No one left the Savage God\u2019s Pool. All of them stood at the poolside and stared at Zhang Ruochen inside the pool.\u201cWhy is there such a great difference between us, even though this is the first time here for all of us?\u201d Situ Linjiang found it incredulous and frustrating.He thought that his willpower was strong enough to bear the pain that ordinary people could not bear. But he could never think that there was such a huge gap between him and Zhang Ruochen.One day later, Zhang Ruochen still firmly stood in the central area of Savage God\u2019s Pool.He did not walk out of the pool until the middle of the third day. Then, he sat with legs crossed in order to refine the remaining Power of Blood inside his body.Zhang Ruochen slowly opened his eyes the moment that he finished the refinement, with a flash of blood flowing in his eyes and quickly retracting back into his pupils.\u201cMy physical quality has indeed improved a lot. If so, I absolutely can open 19 or even 20 Meridians when making a breakthrough to reach the Medium State of the Yellow Realm,\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen thought to himself.After the Year-end Assessment, Concubine Lin had moved back into the Jade Palace again.The moment that Zhang Ruochen arrived in the Jade Palace, he took out 10 small jade bottles with Marrow-washing Liquid in them from the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and put them in a line.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Medium State of the Yellow Realm!\u201dHe emptied a bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid into his mouth, and then Zhang Ruochen began to develop the 12th Meridian.\u2026At that moment, the minister reached the queen\u2019s palace to report everything that he had witnessed in the Savage God\u2019s Pool.\u201cBang!\u201dThe white Genuine Qi from the queen\u2019s five fingers broke the glass into pieces.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s really something. He could practice in the central area of the Savage God\u2019s Pool for two and half days? I never imagined that he was so highly gifted! But it\u2019s a pity that he hasn\u2019t realized that people like to shoot others down before they even stand up,\u201d said the queen in a deep voice.The minister mentioned, \u201cYour Majesty, the Year-end Assessment just ended. Thus, should anything happen to the Ninth Prince, you would be suspected.\u201dThe queen sneered, \u201cDo you think that I\u2019m stupid? We certainly can\u2019t kill him in the palace. But once he leaves the palace, it\u2019s none of my business if he dies out there.\u201dThe minister replied, \u201cActually, no matter how high the Ninth Prince\u2019s gifts are, he\u2019s just at the cultivation of the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, which could never compare with the Seventh Prince. Thus, it\u2019s unknown whether he will fully develop in the future. Your Majesty, it\u2019s not necessary\u2026\u201dThe queen interrupted the minister and said coldly, \u201cWhoever may threaten my son must die! Since he has not become stronger, we must kill the Ninth Prince to prevent trouble later.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He finally reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm.The powerful Genuine Qi quickly ran through the 19 Meridians, filling his whole body, and then an unprecedented strong power came from his Meridians.The Fifth Prince, who reached the Final State, had only developed 12 Meridians.However, Zhang Ruochen, who just reached the Medium State, had developed 19 Meridians. It meant that his Body of Martial Arts had become exceedingly powerful.In his last lifetime, he developed 20 Meridians when he was in the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, just one more than this time.\u201cI have practiced once in the Savage God\u2019s Pool and absorbed a great deal of Power of Blood, making my body more powerful. But it still can\u2019t compare with the one in the last lifetime. Of course, I have some advantages that I never had in the last lifetime: powerful Spiritual Power and a rich practice experience.\u201d\u201cIf I want to catch up with Chi Yao\u2019s martial cultivation, I must do better than that of my last lifetime and open up more Meridians. Therefore, I need to make my body become more powerful than it was last lifetime. I have to open up all the 36 Meridians from the Graph of Meridians in the \u2018Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u2019.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked out of the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel, cleaned up the dirt he made when he developed his Meridians, and then practiced in the yard.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dOnce he slapped, a \u201cBang!\u201d echoed in the air.Now, even if he did not utilize the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, he could also exert the Strength of Sixteen Bulls.If he utilized the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, he could break out the Strength of Twenty-five Bulls with the power of his palm.With his current power, he could defeat Situ Linjiang with three palms. He also could compare well with the warriors who had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s combat effectiveness had advanced to a high level only in a few days.There were more maidservants and eunuchs to serve Concubine Lin and Zhang Ruochen after they moved back to the Jade Palace.Since his gift of Martial Arts was exposed at the Year-end Assessment, Zhang Ruochen had begun to openly practice in the courtyard.A beautiful girl with a flush of shyness on her snow-white face, of about 15 or 16, obsessively gazed at Zhang Ruochen practicing in the courtyard. She thought.\u00a0\u201cThe Ninth Prince is so excellent, and I have heard that he could even defeat the Fifth Prince and the Sixth Prince. He is regarded as a Genius of Martial Arts by the whole palace.\u201dNaturally, people always respected a superior.Girls always admired the geniuses as well.Seeing Zhang Ruochen practicing, an older maidservant with something strange flashing in her eyes slipped away from the Jade Palace to a rockery in the palace.The maidservant knelt down and respectfully said, \u201cMiss Han, the Ninth Prince had released himself from refining! His cultivation has reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm!\u201dThe girl in front of the maidservant wore a light-green dress. She was slender and appeared to be 18 or 19.She was Han Qingluo, one of the four close female guards of the queen.The four close female guards were also the apprentices trained by the queen. With powerful cultivations and special skills in killing, they eliminated dissidents for the queen.The queen had ordered Han Qingluo to assassinate the Ninth Prince.With her hands behind her back and contemptuous mirth on her face, Han Qingluo said, \u201cAt the Martial Arts competition, the cultivation of Zhang Ruochen had reached the Peak of the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. What\u2019s more, he had absorbed the Power of Blood in the Savage God\u2019s Pool. It would be strange if he hadn\u2019t reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm with his talent.\u201dWith a murderous look, Han Qingluo continued, \u201cContinue to observe him, and report it to me once he leaves the palace.\u201dThe maidservant assented. \u201cYes!\u201dAfter saying that, the maidservant returned to the Jade Palace.After finishing his practice, Zhang Ruochen went back to his room and entered the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.Sitting with his legs crossed in the center of the internal space, Zhang Ruochen took out an Energy Pill, ate it, and started to refine.With his current cultivation, he was able to absorb all the Pill Spirit of the Energy Pill without any waste.It only took him two hours to absorb all of the Pill Spirit of the Energy Pill and convert it into Genuine Qi.After Zhang Ruochen reached the Medium State, the capacity of his Qi Pool had become 10 times bigger. But only one Energy Pill\u2019s Spirit could not increase his Genuine Qi much for his Qi Pool.He spent another two hours absorbing the remaining two Energy Pills.The Genuine Qi only increased by 20 percent with three Energy Pills. Zhang Ruochen would have to eat hundreds of Energy Pills to fill his Qi Pool with Genuine Qi.\u201cI must buy some Pills of a higher class because the Energy Pills are having a decreasing effect on me. They will be useless once I reach the Final State of the Yellow Realm.\u201dBoth Energy Pills and Refining Powder were First-Class Pills. They had great effects on warriors in the lower realms.But as the warriors\u2019 cultivation increased, the effects of the First-Class Pills started decreasing, requiring warriors to eat Second-Class Pills in order to maintain their rate of practice.Zhang Ruochen was about to leave the internal space of Time and Space Spinel to buy some Pills of a higher class when he suddenly noticed the stone platform.On the stone platform was a scroll and a silver iron book, \u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space\u201d.\u201cMy cultivation has reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm. Maybe I can open up the scroll.\u201dThe scroll was so heavy that Zhang Ruochen could not even pick it up when he was at the Initial Stage of the Yellow Realm.According to \u201cThe Mystery of Time and Space\u201d, only after Zhang Ruochen reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm would he be able to open up the scroll.Zhang Ruochen operated his Genuine Qi, converged it in his right arm, grasped the scroll, and slowly picked it up.The scroll was so heavy. It had to be at least 1,000 pounds.Zhang Ruochen controlled his power to slowly spread the scroll on the ground.The scroll was a magnificent Catalogue of Reckless Waste with lofty mountains, torrential ancient rivers, steep cliffs, and a giant old tree in the middle of the scroll.The old tree was atop the clouds. Its roots were as big as a mountain and as long as a dragon. Every leaf could cover a lake.With a little smile, Zhang Ruochen shook his head and thought.\u00a0\u201cHow can there be such a giant tree in the world?\u201dSuddenly, he heard a voice. \u201cWho says there can\u2019t be? You are so ignorant that even don\u2019t recognize the divine tree called the \u2018Sacred Prime Tree\u2019 that supports the entire Kunlun\u2019s Field. I\u2019m really disappointed.\u201dBeing slightly astonished, Zhang Ruochen looked around in the internal space only and found no one.\u201cWhere did that voice come from?\u201dIn an alert state, Zhang Ruochen asked in a sinking voice, \u201cWho is speaking?\u201dThe voice came again. \u201cCan\u2019t you see me in the painting?\u201d\u201cIn the painting?\u201dZhang Ruochen felt astonished and asked, \u201cAre you the Sacred Prime Tree? According to history, it was cut down in the Medieval Ancient Times.\u201dThe sound came again. \u201cIn Medieval Ancient Times?\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cThe Medieval Ancient Times was around 100,000 years ago. By the way, are you really the Sacred Prime Tree? Is the legendary tree something that really exists?\u201dThe voice said with a sigh, \u201cHow could it be? As you are saying the Sacred Prime Tree has been cut down, then how could I be a tree?\u201dZhang Ruochen gazed at the scroll and asked again, \u201cWho are you?\u201dThe voice answered, \u201cI\u2019m not a human being.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cEh\u2026\u201dThe voice said, \u201cI\u2019m a cat!\u201dThen it continued, \u201cYou can\u2019t look down on me. I have a famous name: the King of Slaughter. A superior like me is unable to be worn down by time. Even if 100,000 years have passed by, I will still play an important role in history. Young man, you must have heard of my name, haven\u2019t you?\u201dThinking for a while, Zhang Ruochen shook his head and replied. \u201cNo!\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Ruochen found that there was a black cat that was as small as a grain of rice under the Sacred Prime Tree. No one could find it unless they looked carefully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAre you a cat or a painting?\u201d Zhang Ruochen felt strange and asked.It sighed. \u201cEh! I\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m the King of Slaughter. I was sealed in the scroll because I did something wrong in the past. Now, only you can release me.\u201d\u201cWhy am I the only one who can set you free?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.\u201cBecause you have opened up the Sacred Mark of Time and Space. You can drive the power of space to open the seal of the painting. It is known that, from ancient times to now, only a few humans have developed the Sacred Mark of Time and Space. Young man, you are so lucky!\u201dAfter knowing what it was, he laughed and asked, \u201cWhy should I set you free?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wanted me to help the next warrior with a Time and Space Sacred Mark to study\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0so that warrior could become the strongest warrior on earth.\u201dThat voice said again, \u201cIf you don\u2019t free me, how can I show you\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0? And if I don\u2019t show you\u00a0the Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0, how can you become the strongest warrior?\u201d\u201cYou were sealed by Saint Monk Xumi in the painting?\u201d Zhang Ruochen could not believe that cat\u2019s words because they sounded ridiculous.It had to be important for Saint Monk Xumi to seal it in the painting. It could not be that simple that it only had done something bad.Saint Monk Xumi, who had obtained a Time and Space Sacred Mark, wrote\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0. He was a famous Saint back in Medieval Ancient Times and records about him could be found in history.That voice said with a sigh, \u201cWho else can unleash the power of sealing the space except for Saint Monk Xumi? He is the only person who can open up a world in the painting. However, without a doubt, you can do that easily as well after you have become stronger.\u201d\u201cYou said that you could show me how to practice\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space, right? In other words, you can use the Power of Time and Space as well, right?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.That voice said, \u201cOf course, my cultivation is unparalleled. I can do everything. However, without a Time and Space Sacred Mark, I can\u2019t use the Power of Time and Space. \u201cBut, I used to be with Saint Monk Xumi, so I have unconsciously developed a deep understanding of Time and Space. Obviously, I have no problem with teaching you at all.\u201cNow you can finally turn to the second page of\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space!\u00a0\u201dZhang Ruochen picked up The Mystery of Time and Space and turned to the second page. He saw some silver words on this page.\u201cInscription of Space!\u201dOn the second page, eight fundamental Inscriptions of Space, which represented the eight grids of space, were recorded.They were: Inscription of pointy, Inscription of line-type, Inscription of lengthways, Inscription of transverse-type, Inscription of height, Inscription of flat-type, Inscription of strain-type, and Inscription of condensing.In short: pointy, line-type, lengthways, transverse-type, height, flat-type, strain-type, and condensing.A voice came out from the painting. \u201cOnly eight fundamental Inscriptions of Space are recorded on the second page. If you can practice these eight inscriptions well, basically you open up a small space by yourself. However, even so, you won\u2019t be able to attack enemies with the power of the space. You have to learn advanced-level Inscriptions of Space, such as Inscription of Seal, Inscription of Collapse, Inscription of Crack, Inscription of Transmission, etc.\u201cIt is more important for you to practice these eight basic inscriptions well.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhy does this page record eight basic Inscriptions of Space only? What about Inscriptions of Time?\u201d\u201cHaha! Time is flowing continuously. Nobody can create time. Therefore, we don\u2019t have \u2018Inscriptions of Time\u2019. However, for a warrior with a Time and Space Sacred Mark, he can practice his mark of time and utilize the power of time in order to use Time Spiritual Techniques.\u201cIf your Spiritual Power is strong enough, and if you can practice your mark of time well, you can easily cut 10 years off your enemy\u2019s life expectancy with one finger. You can even stop time, speed up time, slow down time, etc. in an independent space. Time has an amazing power.\u201cEven if your cultivation is high, you can\u2019t compete against time, neither can you defend yourself against time.\u201cWell, with your current level of Spiritual Power, you can\u2019t practice the mark of time, you can only do the eight basic Inscriptions of Space.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cSo practicing Inscriptions of Space and the mark of time require amazingly strong Spiritual Power, is that correct?\u201dThat voice laughed. \u201cFree me from the painting first, and then I will let you know!\u201dZhang Ruochen hesitated a bit. He was uncertain whether or not it would be a good thing to do that.\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate. I have great unrivaled cultivation. However, I\u2019m not interested in you at all, young man. Free me and I promise you that I will tell you more secrets about time and space. I will help you utilize the power of the Time and Space Sacred Mark.\u201d\u201cIs this a good thing or bad thing, that\u2019s the problem. However, if it\u2019s a bad thing, it can\u2019t be avoided easily. It will happen anyway.\u201d\u201cIf Saint Monk Xumi considered it a threat, he should have killed it, rather than just sealing it inside a painting.\u201dZhang Ruochen thought for a while and asked, \u201cHow can I free you from the painting?\u201d\u201cJust a drop of blood will be enough. Once you drop it onto the painting, you\u2019ll become the painting\u2019s owner. Inject your Genuine Qi into it, then you will be able to break the seal and free me,\u201d said that voice with great excitement.Zhang Ruochen used his nail to break the skin of his right index finger, leaving a bloody line on his fingertip.A crimson drop of blood from his fingertip dribbled onto the painting, with a \u201cTahh!\u201d sound.The droplet was absorbed by the painting.\u201cBoom!\u201dA light layer of blood covered the painting. The painting suddenly flew into Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand.It should be noted that the painting was 1,000 pounds, however, Zhang Ruochen made it fly to his hand with his Spiritual Power.It was incredible!\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing treasure. Other Genuine Martial Arms can\u2019t be compared to it at all.\u201dAfter having become the owner of this painting, Zhang Ruochen could clearly sense that every line on the painting was an inscription. There were Inscriptions of Space, Inscriptions of Ice Series, Inscriptions of Power Series, Inscription of Earth Series, Inscription of Fire Series, etc. All kinds of inscriptions were on the painting, and they were uncountable.\u201cThat\u2019s why Saint Monk Xumi was the greatest saint in Medieval Ancient Times. Even his painting is beyond others\u2019 cognition.\u201dZhang Ruochen unleashed his Spiritual Power and the painting was turned into a white light and flew into the Sacred Mark on his glabella. Then it reached his Qi Pool.The painting was hung in the middle of the Qi Pool. It was rotating slowly with shallow white light.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen unleashed his Spiritual Power again. Now the painting flew out of the Qi Pool and was back in his hand.The voice said again, \u201cThe painting is called the \u2018Yin-Yang Wooden Graph\u2019. Its paper is made of a tree leaf from the Sacred Prime Tree. It took Saint Monk Xumi 10 years to finish the drawing, and it cost him great Spiritual Power.\u201cYoung man, now you can free me, right?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dAlthough Zhang Ruochen agreed to free the cat, inside his mind he was still uncertain. He could not fully trust the cat.Zhang Ruochen injected his Genuine Qi into the scroll.The scroll was shining and shaking slightly.\u201cBoom\u2026!\u201dA black light flew out of the painting and fell to the ground. It became a one-meter-tall, giant black cat.That cat was as large as a hog and fat with soft black fur. Its golden eyes were even bigger than Zhang Ruochen\u2019s fists.Zhang Ruochen had seen cats before, however, it was his first time to see such a large, fat cat.\u201cHaha! Finally, I am out! It\u2019s been 100,000 years! 100,000 years!\u201d That fat, black, cat spoke like a human being, which was weird.Suddenly, that fat, black cat bared its sharp teeth, with a ferocious gaze in its round eyes. It rushed toward Zhang Ruochen and roared, \u201cKiddo, I\u2019m the King of Slaughter. I can kill you with a claw! Haha!\u201dIt rushed at Zhang Ruochen, reaching out a sharp paw toward his neck.Its body seemed fat and bloated, but it was super fast. It moved like a black shadow.Zhang Ruochen had been vigilant against the cat before the paw was coming toward him.Zhang Ruochen hit the cat with his palm on the its giant face. The cat whined, and his tongue was almost outside his mouth.The cat was thrown backward. \u201cBang!\u201d It hit on the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and fell to the ground like a dead pig.Zhang Ruochen looked at his palm and then glanced at the cat on the ground. He frowned slightly and asked, \u201cAre you really the King of Slaughter?\u201dThat giant, black cat stamped the ground with its paws and gnashed. \u201cYoung man, how dare you doubt my ability? If it wasn\u2019t for my cultivation being sealed in the painting, it would be a piece of cake to kill you\u2026 oh no\u2026 what are you doing\u2026 help\u2026 I was just kidding\u2026 I am such a nice guy, why would I kill others? What are you\u2026 oh no\u2026 no\u2026\u201dZhang Ruochen carried the cat\u2019s tail and dragged it to the center of the space. He stepped on its abdomen with the Flash Shining Sword in his hand.He injected his Genuine Qi into the Flash Shining Sword and all of a sudden, three Inscriptions of Power Series in the sword were activated. The weight of the sword reached 500 pounds suddenly.\u201cFatty, do you really think that I will believe you again?\u201dZhang Ruochen held the sword with both his hands and stabbed abruptly downward.Suddenly, a scary power was unleashed from the cat\u2019s body. The cat turned its body and escaped out of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s control and hid in a corner.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith its tail upturned, the cat shined shallow black lights and said, \u201cYoung man, you must calm down. When you do things, remember not to act on rash impulse. \u201cI was just testing your cultivation. How would I try to kill you? Besides that, with my unrivaled cultivation, if I plan to kill you, do you really think that you can get the chance to fight back?\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201dWith the Flash Shining Sword in his hand, Zhang Ruochen walked toward the cat one step at a time and swayed the sword.\u201cShit, you really think that I am afraid of you? If we really fight against each other, it doesn\u2019t mean that I will be weaker than you.\u201dThe cat reached out his sharp paw and grabbed the Flash Shining Sword. It roared loudly, \u201cMeow!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sword pierced through the breach between the paws of that giant black cat and hit on its glabella. This made a metal crashing sound and some sparks struck out.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Flash Shining Sword was a Fourth Class Genuine Martial Arm. However, it could not break the cat\u2019s defense.\u201cThe cultivation of the cat isn\u2019t that strong. It isn\u2019t more powerful than a warrior in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. Why does it have such formidable defensive power?\u201d\u201cHaha! Although I am one realm lower than you, my indestructibility, great martial technique, and spiteful means can help me defeat those who are three realms higher than me. With my current power, even a warrior in the Completion of the Yellow Realm can\u2019t defeat me. Young man, go to hell! Meow!\u201dThat giant black cat rushed at Zhang Ruochen again and jumped two meters high. It opened its big mouth and tried to bite Zhang Ruochen\u2019s shoulder.\u201cSacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dGenuine Qi was running through Zhang Ruochen\u2019s entire body. He waved his sword at the cat. Meanwhile, the sword had broken out seven Sword Breaths.When the Flash Shining Sword was right in front of the cat, the seven Sword Breaths gathered together and hit the cat\u2019s chin.The cat screamed again and fell to the ground, \u201cAww! That hurts! Young man, why do you have such strong power? You\u2019re just in the Medium State of the Yellow Realm. How can you unleash the power of a warrior in the Completion?\u201d\u201cDo you think you\u2019re the only one who has a great physical quality? If we were in the same realm, I would probably be weaker than you. However, I have a higher realm than you now. You\u2019re not capable enough to fight against me,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen with his sword in his hand.The cat was strong indeed. If they were in the same realm, Zhang Ruochen could barely defeat it because of its strong indestructibility. Being an immortal, there was no blade or spear that could cut through it.Seeing Zhang Ruochen coming closer, it said, \u201cYoung man, as we both can\u2019t defeat each other, why do we still have to fight? We will be wasting our time if we continue fighting each other. Why don\u2019t we sit down and talk peacefully?\u201dThe cat\u2019s defensive power was so strong that even the Flash Shining Sword could not break the defense of its body. If they continued fighting, Zhang Ruochen could only defeat it rather than kill it.Zhang Ruochen stopped and said, \u201cIf you can answer some of my questions, we can probably talk peacefully for now.\u201dThe cat sat on the ground with its belly stuck out. It said comfortably, \u201cGo ahead! I know everything from 100,000 years ago and can predict what will happen in the next 100,000 years. Whether you want to know something up in the sky or underground, or anywhere else on earth, there is nothing that I don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cWhy did Saint Monk Xumi seal you in the Yin-Yang Wooden Graph?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.\u201cWell, that\u2019s a long story! Back then, I had committed horrible crimes. Saint Monk Xumi thought I was sinful, so he sealed me up,\u201d said the cat, with its big ears shaking slightly and eyes spinning.\u201cWhat kind of horrible crimes?\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.\u201cI had killed millions of people, triggered human disasters, killed dragons and took out their gallbladders, set fires in the sky and oceans\u2026 Well, I think that\u2019s it!\u201d said the cat.Zhang Ruochen stared at the cat\u2019s fat body and said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t seem like a killer!\u201d\u201cYes! You read my mind. That monk was unreasonable. He sentenced me incorrectly and sealed me in that graph. I don\u2019t even know to whom to complain to!\u201d The cat lay on the ground, shook its head, and sighed with its belly stuck out.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cThose who don\u2019t look like bad guys can sometimes turn out to be very bad. Likewise, those who don\u2019t look like good people can do great stuff sometimes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a cat, please don\u2019t judge me or misunderstand me\u2026 Hey, young man, what are you doing?\u201d asked the cat.\u201cPhew!\u201d The cat had been sealed in the Yin-Yang Wooden Graph again.\u201cAs expected, the power of the Yin-Yang Wooden Graph can keep you down. Now I am the owner of this graph, so as long as I want, I can seal you in the graph.\u201d Zhang Ruochen smiled with the graph in his hand.\u201cYoung man! You should stay calm and set me free me! I promise you that you\u2019ll have my loyalty forever. If you ask me to catch fish, I won\u2019t dare to catch a rat,\u201d said the cat worriedly.The cat had been sealed in the graph for 100,000 years and had finally regained its freedom. Undoubtedly, it hated to be sealed again.Zhang Ruochen ignored the cat and put the Yin-Yang Wooden Graph aside. He started studying the eight basic Inscriptions of Space.\u201cYoung man! If you want to carve the basic Inscriptions of Space, you must at least cultivate your Spiritual Power up to the 12th level. How old are you now? How can you possess such strong Spiritual Power?! Release me and I\u2019ll teach you how to practice your Spiritual Power.\u201d The cat\u2019s voice came out of the graph.\u201cThe 12th level? Well\u2026 my Spiritual Power has reached the 32nd level already. The basic inscriptions are not difficult to me at all.\u201dZhang Ruochen sat on the ground with his legs crossed. He opened\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0, put it in front of him, and started studying.\u201cHow can it be possible? The Spiritual Power of an ordinary adult is normally at the 10th level. It would be an outstanding achievement to reach a maximum of the eighth level for a young man like you. \u201cEven those with great innate Spiritual Powers can only reach the 15th level at most. How can you reach the 32nd level?\u201d The cat was doubtful.Zhang Ruochen was not interested in talking to it any longer. He started practicing the first basic Inscription of Space, the Inscription of pointy.The voice came out of the graph again. \u201cDid you start practicing your Spiritual Power when you were a child? No! Even if you started practicing from an early age, you could only have reached the 20th level. How can you have reached the 32nd level? Young man, you are better at boasting than me!\u201dWarriors with their Spiritual Power higher than the 15th level would be able to carve basic inscriptions.However, the basic Inscriptions of Space were special. They were more complicated and unstable than the basic inscriptions. Only warriors with Spiritual Power at the 20th level could possibly carve them.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen pushed his Genuine Qi into his fingertip and reached out his finger. A light spot was formed. He wanted to carve the Inscription of pointy in the air.He had tried more than 30 times and yet, none of them were successful.\u201cHaha! I knew it. You were totally boasting! Practicing Spiritual Power to the 20th level is as difficult as climbing into the sky for average warriors. And if they want to carve the basic Inscriptions of Space, that\u2019s even more difficult.\u201d The cat teased him.Zhang Ruochen stopped and whispered to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time to carve it and it\u2019s surely difficult. Let me practice with the Spiritual Paper and the inscription pen!\u201dWhen alchemists and weapon refiners first started practicing the inscriptions, they all practiced with the inscription pens and Spiritual Papers. It took them at least one year to practice before they carved their first inscription on the Spiritual Paper.It was Zhang Ruochen\u2019s first time to practice an inscription. Yet, he wanted to carve it in the air with his finger. It was not surprising that he failed.Zhang Ruochen stood up and planned to purchase some inscription pens and Spiritual Papers.\u201cYoung man, take me there as well! I promise that I won\u2019t make any trouble. I will listen to you\u2026\u201dBefore the cat finished its words, Zhang Ruochen had put the Yin-Yang Wooden Graph back into his glabella and walked out the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.Then, Zhang Ruochen left the Royal Palace and walked toward the Martial Market.Right after Zhang Ruochen had left the palace, a maidservant rushed to the palace where the queen lived and reported Zhang Ruochen\u2019s activity to Han Qingluo.\u201cHe\u2019s finally leaving the palace? That\u2019s wonderful! Get me a troop of soldiers, I\u2019ll take them out of the palace. Tonight is going to be the last night for that genius,\u201d said Han Qingluo with a cold gaze in her eyes. A hint of an evil smile played on her lips.\u2026Zhang Ruochen had arrived at the Martial Market and walked toward the Federation of Inscription.The Federation of Inscription was one of the strongest organizations in Kunlun\u2019s Field, with a long history. Before the First Central Empire was formed, the Federation of Inscription had already been established.There were four Alliances under the Federation of Inscription: Alchemist Alliance, Weapon Refiner Alliance, Tamer Alliance, and Union of Unusual Talent.Inscription pens and Spiritual Paper could only be purchased at the Federation of Inscription.The Federation of Inscription had a monopoly over these two goods. They could not be found in any other place.In Kunlun\u2019s Field, each city had a branch of the Federation of Inscription. The Yunwu Commandery was built magnificently, like a castle.The traffic was always busy outside of the Federation of Inscription. There were warriors as well as alchemists in long blue gowns on the streets.For the alchemists, a tripod was embroidered on the back of their gowns.Other than the alchemists, there was a hammer embroidered on the back of the weapon refiners\u2019 gowns.Apart from the alchemists and weapon refiners, there were some tamers riding on savage beasts walking into the Federation of Inscription.There was a middle-aged man wearing a weapon refiner\u2019s gown. He looked like he was in his 30s, with his chest stuck out. He loftily walked toward the Federation of Inscription.\u201cMy Lord Zuo En!\u201dThe royal guards who stood outside the Federation of Inscription saluted with a gaze of respect in their eyes.\u201cHmm!\u201d Zuo En nodded. He walked into the Federation of Inscription without taking a glance at the royal guards.\u201cIt\u2019s Lord Zuo En, the weapon refiner! It is said that he is an amazing second-class weapon refiner with his Spiritual Power at the 26th level.\u201d\u201cLord Zuo En has altogether 17 disciples, eight of which have become first-class weapon refiners. There are countless warriors who want to be mentored by Lord Zuo En in all of Yunwu City.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Lord Zuo En has a relatively high requirement for his disciples. Warriors will be rejected if either his Spiritual Power has not reached the 12th level, or is aged over 20.\u201d\u201cIt is almost impossible for warriors to cultivate their Spiritual Power up to the 12th level before turning 20 years old. Only the true geniuses can make it.\u201d\u2026At this moment, Zhang Ruochen saw two familiar figures\u2014the Eighth Prince Zhang Ji, and the daughter of Master of the Red Cloud Sect, Shan Xiangling.They had arrived at the Federation of Inscription as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the Year-end Assessment, the status of Zhang Ji had greatly plummeted in the palace.His biological mother, Concubine Xiao, had been banished to the cold palace. Meanwhile, out of the nine princes, he had become the prince with the lowest cultivation. He was so depressed due to these two blows.He had accompanied Shan Xiangling to the Federation of Inscription, hoping that they could apprentice with Lord Zuo En, the second-class weapon refiner.In terms of his Martial Arts talents, he could barely compare to Zhang Ruochen.Therefore, he had to discover some way to surpass Zhang Ruochen so he could retrieve his status back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll buy something in the Federation of Inscription.\u201dStepping off the roan antelope ancient carriage, Zhang Ruochen headed for the Federation of Inscription.A mellow sound came from a distance. A woman said, \u201cPlease wait, Ninth Prince.\u201dZhang Ruochen stopped to turn back, gave a glance at Shan Xiangling who was walking toward him, and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dHaving just met her once at Qingxuan Pavilion, Zhang Ruochen did not know anything about her. He just knew that she was the Eighth Prince\u2019 junior sister apprentice and came from the same suzerain as him.\u201cI\u2019m Shan Xiangling from the Red Cloud Sect. You greatly opened my eyes at the Year-end Assessment, defeating a warrior in the Final State of the Yellow Realm with your cultivation in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. If it\u2019s possible, I would like to discuss Martial Arts with you.\u201dShan Xiangling slowly walked toward Zhang Ruochen with expectation in her eyes, giving off a wisp of soft fragrance.As one of the four beauties in the Yunwu Commandery, Shan Xiangling was really pretty. With slender arched eyebrows, long eyelashes, and exquisite facial features, she was almost as delicate as a work of art.When she first saw Zhang Ruochen in Qingxuan Pavilion, Shan Xiangling considered him a good-for-nothing without any ability to practice Martial Arts. Suspecting he was a catamite of Qin Ya, she deeply looked down upon him.However, Zhang Ruochen showed a marvelous gift for Martial Arts at the Year-end Assessment, by easily holding a heavy stone tray of about 500 kg, killing savage beasts of superior-class level-one, and defeating opponents who were in a higher realm.It was known that it was not easy for a young warrior to do even one of those three things.As a genius martialist, Zhang Ruochen could not be a catamite and a plaything of a licentious woman.Zhang Ruochen glanced at Shan Xiangling and felt a little surprise. She thought,\u00a0\u201cThe girl not only looks pretty but has a high gift for Martial Arts, as she has reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm, which is higher than that of the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan.\u201dActually, the reason why they were all regarded as the four beauties of the younger generation was that they looked pretty and were extremely gifted in Martial Arts.If they did not have a gift for Martial Arts, they could not become goddesses adored by numerous warriors, no matter how beautiful they were.Shan Xiangling was 17, a little older than both the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan, so she had a higher cultivation.Seeing Shan Xiangling expressing kindness to Zhang Ruochen and feeling a sense of crisis, the Eighth Prince quickly walked up to them and said, \u201cJunior sister apprentice, you have forgotten the affairs between the ninth brother and the hostess of Qingxuan Pavilion, haven\u2019t you? You are supposed to stay far away from him\u2026\u201dShan Xiangling raised her hand to interrupt the Eighth Prince, donning a bright smile, and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince is a young talent. He is not the kind of person you are talking about.\u201dThe Eighth Prince felt a greater sense of crisis!\u201cJunior sister apprentice, let\u2019s go! We will apprentice to a master next time,\u201d the Eighth Prince said as he grasped her arm to leave.\u201cBoom!\u201dAs Shan Xiangling quickly operated her Genuine Qi, she lightly waved her wrist, where a strong power broke out, blowing back the Eighth Prince.\u201cEighth Prince, between a man and woman there should be a prudent distance. You should conduct yourself with dignity,\u201d Shan Xiangling said coldly.\u201cJunior sister apprentice\u2026\u201d With pain turning to numbness in his fingers, the Eighth Prince could not raise his arm.Shan Xiangling only caught a fleeting glimpse of him and shook her head slightly.Then she turned to Zhang Ruochen with a mellow smile and asked in a dulcet voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to apprentice to a master in the Federation of Inscription, what about you, Ninth Prince?\u201dSeeing what had happened just now, Zhang Ruochen just calmly answered, \u201cI will just buy some inscription pens and Spiritual Paper to learn inscriptions.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great! I have been learning inscriptions from a very young age. I have already carved some basic inscriptions. With my experience of studying with inscription pens and Spiritual Paper, maybe I can do you a favor if you want to buy them,\u201d said Shan Xiangling.Zhang Ruochen thought for a while, finding that he was not familiar with inscription pens and Spiritual Paper, so he agreed.Looking at the receding figures of Zhang Ruochen and Shan Xiangling, the Eighth Prince became very frustrated.A moment later, his will to fight came back. He thought,\u00a0\u201cAs long as I become Zuo En\u2019 apprentice, a weapon refiner, junior sister apprentice will come back to me again.\u201d\u2026\u201cBoth inscription pens and Spiritual Paper have five levels as follows: Beginner Stage, Medium Stage, Superior Stage, Heaven Stage, and God\u2019s Stage. The five levels correspond with the five levels of inscriptions respectively.\u201cTo carve basic inscriptions, basic inscription pens and Spiritual Paper are enough.\u201cAnd people with Spiritual Power below the 30th level can only carve the basic inscriptions. The higher the Spiritual Power is, the more basic inscriptions can be drawn. The more stable the inscriptions are, the higher possibility it has.\u201dIntroducing inscriptions to Zhang Ruochen, Shan Xiangling said, \u201cI started practicing Spiritual Power and learning inscriptions at a very young age. Now my Spiritual Power has reached the 16th level, but I carve several basic inscriptions with little success, carving 20 times before I succeed once.\u201cA weapon refiner, like Zuo En, with a high success rate can make seven or eight successfully out of 10 times.\u201dThere were weapon refiners that practiced Spiritual Power in the Red Cloud Sect. But their weapon refiner with the highest Spiritual Power had only reached the 18th level. After all, the Red Cloud Sect was just a suzerain of Martial Arts. The weapon refiner in the Red Cloud Sect was unable to guide Shan Xiangling with his cultivation.Therefore, Shan Xiangling visited the Federation of Inscription to take Zuo En as her master as a way to continue to further her study of inscription and weapon refining. That was because she wanted to become a first-class weapon refiner as soon as possible.\u201cYour Spiritual Power has reached the 16th level!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said unexpectedly.It was known that the people who could practice Spiritual Power to the 15th level before 20 years old would be regarded as geniuses. It was great that Shan Xiangling\u2019s Spiritual Power was much stronger than that of her peers.As he mentioned Spiritual Power, Shan Xiangling felt proud with a sense of superiority arising in her mind and said, \u201cGenerally, the people whose Spiritual Power has reached the 15th level have an opportunity to become first-class weapon refiners.\u201dHalting a while, she despondently said, \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t do well in weapon refining and inscription. I failed twice in the first-class weapon refiner\u2019s test. If I can take a second-class weapon refiner as my master, I would become a first-class weapon refiner quickly with his help.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat happens when you become a first-class weapon refiner? Are there any benefits?\u201d\u201cThere are so many benefits! First, as a first-class weapon refiner, you can become a member of the Federation of Inscription. Second, you can study books written about the more esoteric Spiritual Power. What\u2019s more, you can attend a class given by master.\u201cMeanwhile, as a first-class weapon refiner, you can gain a robe refined by the Federation of Inscription. The robe will symbolize that you are a member of the Federation of Inscription. When someone tries to hurt you, as long as it\u2019s not because of a personal grudge or your fault, the Federation of Inscription will help you.\u201cOf course, as a first-class weapon refiner, you can get respect from warriors. Generally, no warriors dare to offend a weapon refiner or an alchemist.\u201dAfter hearing what Shan Xiangling said, Zhang Ruochen also wanted to give it a try. After all, the Federation of Inscription had a long history established in Medieval Ancient Times 100,000 years ago. Even the First Central Empire created by Empress Chi Yao only had a history of 500 years.It could be said that even the cultural details of the First Central Empire ruling Kunlun\u2019s Field could not compare with that of the Federation of Inscription.Nobody knew how strong the Federation of Inscription was and nobody dared to provoke it.Zhang Ruochen nodded and thought that it was not bad to become a member of the Federation of Inscription.Both inscription pens and Spiritual Paper were expensive.An inscription pen of the Beginner Stage would cost 1,000 silver coins.A piece of Spiritual Paper of the Beginner Stage would cost one silver coin.Ordinary warriors would leave immediately once they saw the price.It was simply a waste of money to learn inscription. Only a big family and a strong suzerain could foster a few alchemists and weapon refiners. They carefully picked out the geniuses with strong Spiritual Power to foster.If the person who was picked out could not develop into a first-class alchemist or weapon refiner, they would lose out.Zhang Ruochen spent 20,000 silver coins buying 10 inscription pens and 10,000 sheets of Spiritual Paper. Enough money as he had, he also spent it very distressed.After buying what he wanted, Zhang Ruochen visited Zuo En with Shan Xiangling. And now he knew nothing about inscription, but would just learn by himself through trial and error.He thought that once he got guidance from a master, he would get twice the result with half the effort.Meanwhile, a voice came from the distance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCongratulations, Your Highness, your Spiritual Power has reached the 12th level. You have never practiced Spiritual Power?\u201d Zuo En asked in awe.Zuo En thought that the Eighth Prince deserved to be recognized as gifted because his Spiritual Power had reached the 12th level without any practice at his age.\u201cRight, I haven\u2019t practiced Spiritual Power.\u201dThe Eighth Prince looked at Zhang Ruochen and Shan Xiangling with a smile on his face and said in a louder voice, \u201cIn your point of view, I was born to be a superior of Spiritual Power?\u201dAfter hearing the commendation from Zuo En, the Eighth Prince was so delighted that he could not wait to show off his talent to Shan Xiangling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Here is a letter from my father.\u201d Shan Xiangling handed him the letter.Zuo En opened and read the letter. He glanced at Shan Xiangling from head to toe and said, \u201cYour father mentioned that your Spiritual Power has reached the 16th level. Is that true?\u201dShan Xiangling nodded with consent. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct!\u201dZuo En folded the letter and said, \u201cYour father, Master of the Red Cloud Sect, and I are good old friends. Since you have such talent, I\u2019ll take you as my disciple. From now on, you are my 19th disciple.\u201dShan Xiangling was delighted. She hurriedly bowed and said, \u201cMr. Zuo, please accept my respect!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! Junior sister apprentice, I\u2019m also one of the disciples of Lord Zuo En. We can practice Spiritual Power, learn how to carve inscriptions, and refine weapons together!\u201d the Eighth Prince said with excitement.Shan Xiangling ignored the Eighth Prince and introduced Zhang Ruochen to Zuo En. She said, \u201cMy Lord, this is the Ninth Prince of the Yunwu Commandery. He wants to ask you questions about the inscriptions.\u201dZuo En glanced at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cIf you want to be my disciple, you have to meet the following requirements. First, you must be aged under 20. Second, your Spiritual Power must reach at least the 20th level. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a prince, if you can\u2019t meet these two requirements, you are not qualified to be my disciple.\u201dThe Eighth Prince sneered. In his opinion, no doubt Zhang Ruochen had a great talent for practicing Martial Arts. Yet, his talent for Spiritual Power was not as strong as his.Zhang Ruochen looked at Zuo En and said, \u201cWait! You misunderstand me! I just want to ask you a few questions about the inscriptions rather than apprentice to you.\u201dWhen other warriors saw Zuo En, they all had always behaved respectfully, which made him get used to being a superior. He felt annoyed as Zhang Ruochen stood himself upright to talk to him.Zhang Ruochen was not being arrogant. He just wanted to communicate with Zuo En in an equal manner. In fact, his Spiritual Power was much stronger than Zuo En\u2019s, and he did not need to look up to Zuo En.Zuo En groaned. \u201cHmph! You\u2019re aiming too high, young man! Listen, if you want to carve the inscriptions, you have to practice your Spiritual Power. The higher level of your Spiritual Power, the higher possibility to carve the inscriptions. Yet, you will not succeed if your Spiritual Power is under the 15th level.\u201cYoung man, have you reached the 15th level?\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cDo you mean that once I cultivate to the 15th level, you\u2019ll help me out with carving inscriptions?\u201d\u201cHaha! Only warriors who cultivate to the 15th level can be my disciples. Unless you\u2019ve reached the 20th level, don\u2019t even think about communicating equally with me about inscriptions!\u201d Zuo En said arrogantly.In fact, the person whose Spiritual Power had reached the 20th level usually became a second-class weapon refiner.Every upgrade was extremely difficult after reaching the 15th level. It was as difficult as climbing into the sky as it was to reach the 20th level. That explained why the second-class weapon refiners were rare. Even the Red Cloud Sect could not hire one.\u201cThe 20th Level? Let me try.\u201dThen, Zhang Ruochen stared at the Sacred Testing Stone. He headed over to it and put his hands on it.\u201cThe 20th level? He has never practiced Spiritual Power, how could he have reached the 20th level?\u201d\u00a0the Eighth Prince sneered and thought.Zuo En said, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy! Even a talented genius of Spiritual Power can\u2019t reach the 20th level before 20 years old.\u201dShan Xiangling was curious but she believed that Zhang Ruochen would only do things that he was sure of.\u201cIs his Spiritual Power really that incredible?\u201dZhang Ruochen closed his eyes and injected his Spiritual Power into the Sacred Testing Stone.\u201cBoom\u2026!\u201dThere were circles of light streaks that appeared on the surface of the Sacred Testing Stone.One circle, two circles, three circles\u2026Every circle represented a level of Spiritual Power.When Zuo En saw 20 circles on the rock surface, he was so shocked and stared at Zhang Ruochen with surprise, as if he was a monster.\u201cIt can\u2019t happen, it\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d the Eighth Prince murmured as his face turned pale. He could not believe what he just saw.Shan Xiangling was also shocked. She stared at Zhang Ruochen with adoration in her eyes.When the circles had added up to 20, Zhang Ruochen stopped releasing his Spiritual Power and withdrew his palms.Zuo En knew that Zhang Ruochen did not do his best because his Spiritual Power was definitely higher than the 20th level.He had changed his attitude immediately. He welcomed Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cYour Highness, you are definitely a master of Spiritual Power, please forgive my offense.\u201d\u201cAt the age of 16, his Spiritual Power could advance past the 20th level! His future achievements are going to be beyond imagination. Who knows if I\u2019ll need his help in the future.\u201d\u00a0Thinking about this, Zuo En immediately showed his kindness to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cI just want to consult you about the inscriptions and skills of carving.\u201d\u201cNo problem! Your Highness, please follow me. Let\u2019s go to a quiet place to share the knowledge of Spiritual Power and inscriptions,\u201d Zuo En said happily.Zhang Ruochen nodded and headed for the audience hall of the Federation of Inscription with Zuo En, followed by Shan Xiangling.\u2026The Eighth Prince walked out of the Federation of Inscription. His face was gloomy and his heart was filled with anger.\u201cHow irritating this is! In the past, Zhang Ruochen was a waste who didn\u2019t dare to hit me back when I slapped him. But now, he is stronger than me unexpectedly. How could his talent be so high? How could it be?\u201dThe Eighth Prince was gnashing his teeth in anger when he saw an ancient roan antelope ancient carriage outside the Federation of Inscription.That was the carriage of Zhang Ruochen.At the moment, Yun was silently sitting in the carriage waiting for Zhang Ruochen and looking at the Federation of Inscription now and then.Seeing the Eighth Prince walking toward her, she was so scared that she saluted immediately and said, \u201cGreetings, Your Highness!\u201dHe looked cold-blooded and said, \u201cTake me back to the palace.\u201dYun felt reluctant and embarrassed and said in fear, \u201cBut\u2026 but this is the Ninth Prince\u2019s carriage.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dThe Eighth Prince slapped Yun so hard that it made Yun fly three meters away.Yun\u2019s face was swollen and bloodshot with a five-fingered handprint appearing on her face immediately. She was spitting blood constantly with a dizzy head and a dislocated jaw. And she felt like she was going to die.The Eighth Prince stomped on her and said with a fierce look, \u201cThe Ninth Prince is a prince, am I not a prince? You are just a maidservant, how dare you refuse to follow my order? Believe it or not, I can make your parents become the food of savage beasts and make you turn into a worthless prostitute with just a word.\u201dAfter that, the Eighth Prince got on the carriage and said, \u201cDrive, or I will make your life a living hell.\u201dYun felt so frightened. As she was just a maidservant, her whole family would be destroyed by one word from the Eighth Prince.She stood up hard, sat on the carriage enduring the pain on her face, and drove back to the palace.Sitting on the carriage and wringing his hands with grim eyes, the Eighth Prince thought,\u00a0\u201cZhang Ruochen, you have surely gained some kind of precious treasure. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be able to become so excellent in three months.\u201d\u201cAs long as I have control over Concubine Lin and make use of her life to force him to hand over the treasure, I have a chance to make huge progress in my cultivation and become a master of Martial Arts.\u201d\u201cAfter I become a Martial Arts master, Zhang Ruochen will definitely be the first person who I kill. By that time, Shan Xiangling, that dishonorable woman, will become my plaything. Haha!\u201dThe street was desolate at night, passersby became fewer and fewer.Two men in black stood on the roof beside the street and stared at the roan antelope ancient carriage passing below.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs that the carriage of the Ninth Prince?\u201d the taller and thinner man whispered.He was carrying a wire bow and 10 Thunder Arrows on his back and exuded a murderous coldness.The chunky one sneered and said, \u201cIt must be him. Look at the maidservant who is driving, she looks exactly the same as the portrait given by Miss Han. She is the maidservant of the Ninth Prince. The Ninth Prince must be in the carriage right now.\u201d\u201cHaha! It is so exciting to assassinate a prince. Once we have finished the mission, Miss Han will surely give us a generous reward.\u201dThe taller and thinner man in black drew a Thunder Arrow and fitted it to his bow. Then, he aimed at the carriage, ready to let it fly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It thrust into the ancient roan antelope carriage and passed through the vest of the Eighth Prince.The arrowhead exploded. It turned into a fist-sized ball of electricity and released shafts of lightning that left a bloody bowl-sized wound on the Eighth Prince\u2019s back.\u201cCrash!\u201dA short and chunky dark shadow dashed into the carriage. The sword flashed, and the head of the Eighth Prince had been cut off and put inside a beast-skin bag.The assassin chuckled darkly. He carried the bag with the Eighth Prince\u2019s head and sprinted out of the ancient roan antelope carriage.In an instant, he had disappeared into the dark.Yun noticed that there were strange noises. She stopped the carriage and asked, \u201cMy Eighth Prince, what happened? Is everything okay?\u201dHearing no reply from the Eighth Prince, she lifted the curtain slowly and carefully. Inside, she saw a headless body! The carriage was all covered with blood and looked extremely horrifying.\u201cHelp!\u201d Yun screamed and passed out from fear.\u2026Two dark shadows, one tall and one short, flitted across Yunwu City and soon reached the side of the moat.Han Qingluo crossed her hands behind her back. Her tall figure under the moonlight cast a long shadow on the ground.She stood under the willow next to the riverside. Her eyes stared at the moon reflecting on the river\u2019s surface and she quietly asked, \u201cDid you complete your mission?\u201d\u201cMiss Han, the mission was a lot easier than we expected. We cut off his head with one single stroke. He didn\u2019t even have a chance to fight back,\u201d the tall man in black said.The other man in black laughed and said, \u201cWhat kind of prodigy is he that he can\u2019t even put up a fight? He is a complete joke!\u201dHan Qingluo nodded slightly and said, \u201cBoth of your cultivations are at the Completion of the Yellow Realm as well as professional assassins, killing him is surely not a difficult task. Anyway, have you brought his head?\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019ve brought it here.\u201dThe lanky man in black took out the beast-skin bag, placed it on the ground and opened it. A human head covered with blood was exposed.Han Qingluo looked into the bag. Her countenance shifted slightly and coldly asked, \u201cAre you sure the one you killed is the Ninth Prince?\u201dBoth men in black were frightened when they looked inside the bag. Their hearts skipped when that they realized that they had killed the wrong person.They shivered, kneeled down instantly, and said, \u201cMiss Han\u2026 please give us one more chance! We will make sure to bring back the Ninth Prince\u2019s head!\u201d\u201cYou two have no more chances!\u201dHan Qingluo shook her head slightly and said, \u201cThis is such a huge mistake, killing the Eighth Prince rather than the Ninth Prince. I will be punished for your mistake. Do you really think you two will still have a chance to live?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 Miss Han, spare us!\u201d\u201cSpare us, Miss Han!\u201dAll of sudden, both assassins jumped up high at the same time like lightning and struck out as fast as they could toward Han Qingluo.They had no choice as they had failed the mission and had killed the Eighth Prince instead. Having made such a massive mistake, they would both certainly be killed by Han Qingluo.If they were going to die anyway, why not make a last bid for their lives?Once they killed Han Qingluo, they would escape immediately and hide forever after away from Yunwu City. The world was big enough that even the queen with her great power would never be able to find them.Moreover, Han Qingluo\u2019s cultivation was at the Completion of the Yellow Realm, the same as the two assassins. Indeed, if the assassins cooperated together and took Han Qingluo by surprise, there was a chance that they could kill her.Han Qingluo sneered. She turned five of her fingers into a claw shape with her nails becoming razor sharp.\u201cPfff!\u201dHer claw punched through the lanky man in black\u2019s chest, taking his bloody heart along with it.The lanky man in black looked at Han Qingluo, who was crushing his heart helplessly. He felt a sharp pain in his chest and fell flat on the ground.Next, Han Qingluo struck out with her other hand, wrapping it with a layer of icy cold Genuine Qi.\u201cBoom!\u201dHer palm, which was sharper than a knife, passed through the air and sent the stocky man in black\u2019s head flying away.Although Han Qingluo and the two assassins were at the same level of cultivation, the Completion of the Yellow Realm, Han Qingluo was much more powerful. Even if seven or eight more warriors of the same level attacked her at the same time, they would not be strong enough to defeat her.She specialized in the \u201ckilling technique\u201d. It was well-known that once she fought, certainly there would be blood.\u201cThe Eighth Prince has been killed. This will definitely shock Yunwu City and now there will be no chance to assassinate the Ninth Prince. I need to return to the palace and report what has happened to the queen so that we can prepare counter strategies.\u201dHan Qingluo threw the two dead bodies into the moat. After she wiped the blood from her hands, she turned into a green shadow and flew to the palace.\u2026Through the communication with Zuo En, Zhang Ruochen understood and learned a lot about inscriptions.At the same time, Zuo En mentioned a lot of information about refining weapons, which also piqued Zhang Ruochen\u2019s interests a little.Zhang Ruochen left the Federation of Inscription while Shan Xiangling stayed behind to get better acquainted with the art of refining weapons.When Zhang Ruochen left the Federation of Inscription, he looked around but could not see Yun. He frowned and said, \u201cWhere is sister Yun? Has she left early to return to the palace? But she shouldn\u2019t have done so!\u201dZhang Ruochen did not think too much of it as the Martial Market was a safe place to visit. He thought that Yun must have had something urgent to deal with and left him without notice.Following that, he went to the Pill Market, planning to buy some higher grade Pills to enhance his ability while practicing.This was the second time he had visited Qingxuan Pavilion.When he walked in the front door, Mo Hanlin welcomed him with pleasure and asked, \u201cNinth Prince, are you looking for Pills again? My mistress has already informed me that my Ninth Prince will receive a half-price discount when buying any Pills.\u201d\u201cYour mistress is so generous!\u201d Zhang Ruochen responded with surprise.Mo Hanlin narrowed his eyes, smiling and said, \u201cMy mistress is hardly lavish with her hospitality toward customers. Only the Ninth Prince will be able to enjoy such treatment!\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cHow much is a Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill?\u201dA triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill was classified as a Second-Class Pill. Its effect was the same as the Energy Pill but 10 times stronger in power. Moreover, the Genuine Qi produced by taking a Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill was purer than that of an Energy Pill.\u201c5,000 silver coins for one Pill.\u201d Mo Hanlin extended five fingers and waved them at Zhang Ruochen.It was so expensive!Such a supreme class of this Pill, even the prodigies from the large-scale family could not take it every day. It was said that they were given a Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill every sixth months.Weapon refiners and alchemists sure made a lot of money!\u201cI want to buy 10 of them,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said without hesitation.\u201c10 Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pills.\u201d Mo Hanlin recorded it down in his notebook and asked, \u201cMy Ninth Prince, do you need any other Pills?\u201d\u201cPlease give me 100 Second-Class Blood Pills,\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied.The Blood Pills that Zhang Ruochen had bought last time were already used up. He needed to buy some more this time.With his current Martial Arts cultivation, he was able to digest the Spiritual Blood of the Second-Class Blood Pills.An ordinary warrior in the Completion of the Yellow Realm usually took First-Class Blood Pills. Yet, Zhang Ruochen did not care how much he had to spend in order to buy the Pills. He was more than willing to pay for any Pills that could enhance his cultivation within a short period of time.Although the price of a Second-Class Blood Pill was more expensive than a First-Class Blood Pill, it was also more beneficial toward the human body.The Spiritual Blood of a First Class Blood Pill could only provide the energy that warriors needed for a day. However, a Second-Class Blood Pill could supply warriors with enough energy to last them three days.\u201c30 silver coins for a Second Class Blood Pill. Altogether 100 pills.\u201d Mo Hanlin also marked it down in his notebook.Zhang Ruochen continued searching on the counter. Suddenly, he saw the Elephant Fire Pill, a Third Class Pill that could facilitate a warrior to refine their body.At the moment, Zhang Ruochen needed to reinforce his physique urgently. The stronger the body, the better for practicing Martial Arts in the future.It was said that if practicing Martial Arts was like constructing a building, the most important part was the foundation. The more solid the foundation was, the higher the building could be constructed.Practicing the Yellow Realm meant refining one\u2019s body. Through opening the Meridians, it enabled the warriors to build a solid foundation for practicing Martial Arts.\u201cHow much is an Elephant Fire Pill?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.Mo Hanlin\u2019s eyes flashed and he explained, \u201cThe Elephant Fire Pill is a Third-Class pill. It is made of the marrow and blood of elephants. Moreover, fire lotus, a very expensive ingredient, has been added into the pill. Hence why it costs 80,000 silver coins for one Pill.\u201dZhang Ruochen was going to buy it no matter how costly the Pill was.He asked, \u201cHow many Triple-purity Elephant Fire Pills do you have in stock?\u201d\u201cSeven. This is all we have in Qingxuan Pavilion!\u201d said Mo Hanlin.\u201cGood! I\u2019m buying them all!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.Besides that, Zhang Ruochen bought 20 bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid and a bottle of healing pills.\u201cClick, Clack!\u201d Mo Hanlin was holding an abacus and he calculated for a while. He said, \u201c10 Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pills, 50,000 silver coins.\u201c100 Second-Class Blood Pills, 3,000 silver coins.\u201cSeven Elephant Fire Pills, 560,000 silver coins.\u201c20 bottles of Marrow-washing Liquid, 4,000 silver coins.\u201c10 Saint Stone Pill, 20,000 silver coins.\u201cThe total cost is 637,000 silver coins. With the half-priced discount, that will be 318,500 silver coins.\u201dAlthough Zhang Ruochen had anticipated that it would be costly, the cost after the discount surprised him. He could not believe he had just spent 300,000 silver coins for the Pills. Seven Elephant Fire Pills were very expensive, which brought up the total price. Luckily, mistress Qi Ya offered him a half-price discount, so the final amount was still fairly acceptable for him.\u201cIf I take all seven Elephant Fire Pill and digest them completely, I\u2019m sure that my physical quality will reach the level of my last lifetime!\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen thought.After paying 318,500 silver coins to Qingxuan Pavilion, there were only 800,000 silver coins left in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s total assets. They were also all stored at the Martial Market Bank.When Zhang Ruochen just left the Qing Xuan Pavilion, he saw a group of soldiers clad in armor on horseback. They were rushing through the main street and had kicked up a huge cloud of dust.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was a warrior on the side looking at the rushing soldiers and whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s someone who is brave enough to kill the Eighth Prince. The city is under lockdown now, even the exit and entrance of the Martial Market are closed.\u201d\u201cThe Eighth Prince has been killed?\u201dZhang Ruochen remembered that he saw the Eighth Prince at the Federation of Inscription. How was it possible that he had been killed not long after?\u201cBoom!\u201dA group of soldiers rushed toward Zhang Ruochen and kneeled down neatly in front of him. Among the soldiers, there was an elder eunuch who stood at the front and greeted Zhang Ruochen with courtesy and said, \u201cMy Ninth Prince, His Majesty summons you to return the palace promptly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the generals and soldiers could not find the assassin and punished him severely, all the members of the Royal Family would be in danger!The Yunwu Commandery Prince was inflamed with anger. He summoned 10 generals who had guarded Yunwu City that very night. He demanded that they close the city gate and lock down the Martial Market. He told them that catching 100 innocent suspects was better than letting a single guilty person escape.\u201cIt has been many years since someone dared to assassinate a member of the Royal Family in Yunwu City!\u201d the Yunwu Commandery Prince said.Inside the palace, the 10 Generals felt like they heard a loud boom of thunder. Their eardrums seemed broken as they all shivered and sank down to their knees.Each of the 10 generals commanded thousands of soldiers and horses. Their martial cultivation was tremendously powerful. Yet, the Yunwu Commandery Prince only needed to groan slightly to frighten all of them into kneeling down on the ground.That was because the Yunwu Commandery Prince was a warrior in the Heaven Realm, and he was known as a Martial Arts legend. All the Martial Arts warriors regarded him as a god.Minister Xue Jingtian stood respectfully before him and said, \u201cYour Majesty, do you think this incident is related to the Moon Worship Demonic Sect? Only the Moon Worship Demonic Sect and the Black Market dare to oppose the Royal Family in the Yunwu Commandery.\u201d\u201cAlthough numerous evil and unsavory people gather around the Black Market, they only work for their own benefit. Killing the Eighth Prince does not serve their interests. I doubt if they are involved in the assassination.\u201d\u201cYet, the Moon Worship Demonic Sect worship devils, and they like meddling in high-profile affairs. It is highly possible that they\u2019ve killed the Eighth Prince in order to provoke the dignity of the Royal Family,\u201d the minister added.\u201cThe Moon Worship Demonic Sect?\u201d The Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s eyes sank as he digested what the minister had just said.The Royal Family was no doubt the most powerful group in the Yunwu Commandery. They had conquered the land and they held power over the military.Other suzerains and superior families were subservient to the Royal Family.However, some well-known groups often challenged the Royal Family, such as the Federation of Inscription, the Moon Worship Demonic Sect, the Black Market, and the Martial Market Bank.The Federation of Inscription and the Martial Market Bank had control over all of the alchemists, weapons refiners, tamers, and other unusually talented people in the Yunwu Commandery, as well as more than one-third of the assets of the commandery.The Federation of Inscription and the Martial Market Bank were located all over Kunlun\u2019s Field. They were influential enough to alter the Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s decisions with just one word.Of course, the Federation of Inscription and the Martial Market Bank worked in partnership with the Royal Family to achieve mutual benefits. Under normal circumstances, they would not confront the official power.In such a peaceful era, the Federation of Inscription and the Martial Market Bank symbolized subservience to the official power. They accepted the governance of the Royal Family.Yet, the Federation of Inscription and the Martial Market Bank were left to manage their core interests themselves. The official power did not get involved.The Black Market, like the Federation of Inscription and the Martial Market Bank, had been completely free from the supervision of the official power since ancient times.It was a place specifically for all kinds of illegal businesses. It was the seedy underbelly of the world.They controlled half of the assassins, prostitutes, thieves, wanted murderers, as well as a large number of slave traders and thugs-for-hire in the commandery.To a certain extent, the Black Market was powerful enough to compete with the Martial Market Bank.The official power was somewhat able to suppress the Black Market, but they could not completely eliminate it. In another commandery, the Black Market had dominated the entire government and military, turning it into a dark paradise.The Moon Worship Demonic Sect was even more terrifying. Large numbers of warriors worshiped devils in every commandery. They had established a branch gang for every region to confront the official power there.They even wanted to overrule the First Central Empire, and they took control over Kunlun\u2019s Field.The Moon Worship Demonic Sect had built an assembly hall in every commandery and had appointed a branch chief to run it.The power of the Moon Worship Demonic Sect was no doubt present in the Yunwu Commandery.The chief of the Moon Worship Demonic Sect in the Yunwu Commandery was also a warrior with a cultivation in the Heaven Realm, as well as a Martial Arts legend.\u201cIf the assassin who killed the Eighth Prince is a member of the Moon Worship Demonic Sect, it is definitely a threat. They must be testing the Yunwu Commandery. Perhaps heresy masters are planning to attack the Yunwu Commandery,\u201d Minister Xue Jingtian said.The minister was the brother of the queen. He must have known that her assassins had mistakenly killed the Eighth Prince instead of the Ninth Prince, their intended victim.He had to direct the Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s suspicions away from his sister. Xue Jingtian needed to guide the Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s attention to the Moon Worship Demonic Sect.Assassinating a prince was a serious matter, but the Moon Worship Demonic Sect was even more important.The Moon Worship Demonic Sect had eliminated more than one commandery during the last 800 years. This was a nightmare for many rulers.Even if the Moon Worship Demonic Sect decided to attack the Yunwu Commandery, the Yunwu Commandery Prince would definitely make it a priority.The Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s face grew serious as he listened to the minister. The Moon Worship Demonic Sect was threatening his position as a Commandery Prince.The minister glanced at the Yunwu Commandery Prince and felt a little relieved.He was relieved because he had finally switched the Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s attention to the Moon Worship Demonic Sect. If the Yunwu Commandery Prince ordered an investigation of the Eighth Prince\u2019s murder, it might expose the queen.\u201cIt is impossible that the Eighth Prince was assassinated by the Moon Worship Demonic Sect!\u201d Zhang Ruochen exclaimed while walking into the place.The minister looked at Zhang Ruochen with surprise and asked, \u201cMy Ninth Prince, what\u2019s your opinion?\u201dZhang Ruochen responded and said, \u201cThe Eighth Prince was riding on my carriage. He was assassinated on his way back to the palace. Obviously, assassins were targeting me, not the Eighth Prince! His death was a mistake!\u201dThe Yunwu Commandery Prince nodded and said, \u201cRuochen\u2019s deduction is indeed reasonable. The Moon Worship Demonic Sect has always been high profile. If they wanted to challenge the Royal Family intentionally, assassinating the Eighth Prince would be too simple. This incident must be investigated comprehensively. Also, Ge Qian, you have to leave the palace and discreetly monitor what the Moon Worship Demonic Sect is about to do, just in case.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201dGe Qian, the royal bodyguard of the Yunwu Commandery Prince, left the palace immediately to investigate the Moon Worship Demonic Sect.Zhang Ruochen and the 10 generals also left the palace.They immediately went and looked into the Eighth Prince\u2019s death, hoping to arrest the assassin.Zhang Ruochen went back to the Jade Palace and checked up on Yun\u2019s injury. She had been badly hurt in the incident. Afterward, he went into the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and started practicing.\u201cI was definitely the target of the assassination. Tonight was extremely dangerous! If the Eighth Prince hadn\u2019t forced Yun to send him back to the palace, I guess I would be the headless one.\u201dDuring the Year-end Assessment, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s performance was too outstanding. It had made a lot of warriors jealous.The people in the palace were the most suspicious.Indeed, the Black Market and the Moon Worship Demonic Sect were not completely free from suspicion. A talented Martial Arts warrior who had born in the Royal Family was a threat to their existence. The best way to deal with it would be to kill the prodigy.\u201cStop overthinking! If my cultivation is strong enough, no one will be able to kill me. Moreover, the assassination of the Eighth Prince has caused such a big reaction that the assassin may not try again.\u201dZhang Ruochen stopped overthinking and placed an Elephant Fire Pill in his palm.The Elephant Fire Pill was as big as a longan. It looked like a flame and produced an extremely hot aura.A Third-Class Pill was indeed different. The Pill Spirit inside was surprisingly potent.An Elephant Fire Pill cost as much as a Fifth-Class Genuine Martial Arms. Only Zhang Ruochen would buy seven of these luxuries at one time.On the other hand, only warriors with such a powerful body like Zhang Ruochen had the courage to take an Elephant Fire Pill. If a warrior in the Medium State of the Yellow Realm tried to take one, he would not only fail to digest it, but he might also burn himself badly.Taking an Elephant Fire Pill was like swallowing a mini sun. The pain was even more intense than practicing in the Savage God\u2019s Pool.\u201cPhew!\u201dZhang Ruochen swallowed the Elephant Fire Pill. A current of pill fire and Pill Spirit poured down from the sky. It drilled into his Meridians, flesh, bones, and five internal organs. It purified his body and blood.Zhang Ruochen spent three whole days digesting the Elephant Fire Pill. His body strength had increased drastically. Also, his Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool had doubled.Although Zhang Ruochen had fully digested the pill fire, he had only absorbed 30% of the Pill Spirit.After five more days, Zhang Ruochen had completely absorbed the Pill Spirit of the Elephant Fire Pill. His pool of Genuine Qi had enhanced greatly.At this speed, if I take two more Elephant Fire Pills, I will be able to practice the Genuine Qi of my Qi Pool and reach the Peak of the Mid Stage of the Yellow Realm.The role of the Elephant Fire Pill was to refine one\u2019s body, not to elevate one\u2019s Genuine Qi.However, the Elephant Fire Pill was miraculous because while Zhang Ruochen was refining his body, his Genuine Qi also increased.Zhang Ruochen was in no hurry to take the second Elephant Fire Pill. The Pills were so strong that, even with his physique, if he took them without any interval, they would be unbearable.Rather than taking the second Elephant Fire Pill, he thought.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s start learning how to carve the basic Inscription of Space!\u201dHe took out the inscription pen and the Spiritual Paper. He infused the pen with his Genuine Qi and started drawing on the Spiritual Paper.After wasting 130 pieces of paper and an entire day, he had failed to draw an inscription.Rather than giving up, he kept drawing and practicing until he succeeded.Zhang Ruochen spent almost every day in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel within the next month. He only went out once every three days.The rest of the time, he practiced the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, the Heaven and Heart Sword, and drawing eight types of the Inscription of Space.A month outside the Time and Space Spinel equaled three months in the internal space of the spinel.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen had taken three Elephant Fire Pills in three months time. Finally, he had fully developed his Genuine Qi Pool and reached the Peak of the Medium State of the Yellow Realm. He could start practicing the Final State of the Yellow Realm.\u201cMy physical quality is just about the same as it was in my last lifetime. Indeed, when I broke through the Final State of the Yellow Realm in my previous life, I was only six years old,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen was ready to break through to the Final State of the Yellow Realm in this current life.\u201cI wonder how many Meridians I will manage to open up. In my last lifetime, when I reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm, I had opened 27 Meridians. Will I be able to open more than last time?\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s determination showed in his eyes. No matter what happened, he had to make it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0TransnThere were currently 19 Meridians inside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body, who was classified as outstanding among all the warriors.With a cultivation in the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, Zhang Ruochen was able to fight against warriors in the Completion of the Yellow Realm.If he could open up 27 Meridians when he was breaking through to the Final State of the Yellow Realm, he could not imagine how powerful his fighting ability would be.When Zhang Ruochen took the first bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid, it took him an hour to open the 20th Meridian.The second bottle of liquid took him four hours to open the 21st Meridian.When he took the third bottle of liquid, it took him four days to open the 22nd Meridian.He continued by taking the fourth bottle of liquid. The 23rd Meridian opened after quite a long time.The more Meridians in his body, the more difficult it was for him to open them.Having opened up four Meridians consecutively, Zhang Ruochen had used up half of his Genuine Qi. He felt exhausted and pain went all over his body.As he was an experienced warrior in his last lifetime, he did not force himself to open the 24th Meridian. Rather, he stopped and decided to take some rest.He then took a Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill, and with the help of the Pill Spirit, his Genuine Qi would recover after all the energy that he had expended.Shortly afterward, the Genuine Qi in his Qi Pool had been fully recovered. His entire body was full of power and energy.Later, Zhang Ruochen placed the Graph of Meridians of the\u00a0Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u00a0in front of him and started studying.Zhang Ruochen had memorized all 36 Meridian paths on the scripture solidly. Even when he closed his eyes, the scripture appeared clearly in his mind.In Zhang Ruochen\u2019s last lifetime, altogether he had opened up 33 Meridians. No matter how hard he tried, he could not open the remaining three.The remaining three Meridians were the Chakras, the Vessel of Spiritual Blood, and the Vessel of Spirit.These three Meridians were all mysterious. They overrode either the knowledge of normal warriors or their Martial Arts. Otherwise, with the talent that Zhang Ruochen had in his last lifetime, it was impossible that he was unable to open all the Meridians.The Chakras referred to the growth ring of a warrior.It was known that trees would grow a spiral-shape growth ring. Yet, after practicing the\u00a0Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u00a0, Zhang Ruochen realized that even human warriors would be able to develop a growth ring.The only condition for warriors to cultivate a growth ring was that the warriors had to open up the Chakras under their skin.For each layer of growth ring, there was a layer of leather armor.A layer of growth ring would increase after each year of practice. The defensive power of the skin would also be greatly enhanced.The growth ring of a warrior was incredibly thin, so people would not be able to see it.Even warriors who had practiced a hundred years and cultivated a hundred layers of growth rings, the thickness of their skin had no difference compared to ordinary citizens. The defensive power of their skin had reached a terrifying level, so they were impervious to bullets and swords.The Vessel of Spiritual Blood referred to the Meridians which linked to the blood.Blood was in a liquid state. If warriors wanted to cultivate a gaseous state Meridian inside the liquid state of blood, this was completely beyond their knowledge. Even Zhang Ruochen was suspicious about whether or not the Vessel of Spiritual Blood actually existed.The Vessel of Spirit was even more unexplainable. It was recorded in theScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u00a0that the Vessel of Spirit existed in the Meridians of a warrior\u2019s soul. It linked a warrior\u2019s body and soul together.Once warriors cultivated the Vessel of Spirit, they would be able to see their soul. They could also control their soul apart from their body. What they had to do to make it work was just a thought. When they thought about a certain idea, their soul could fly and see what happened a mile away.The Chakras, the Vessel of Spiritual Blood and the Vessel of Spirit were all incredibly mysterious and exceeded the knowledge of ordinary warriors. Even with the talent and capability in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s last lifetime, he could not open up these three Meridians.In this life, Zhang Ruochen was determined to seize every opportunity to elevate his capability. If he was able to open these three mysterious Meridians, his physical quality would definitely be stronger and much more powerful than it was in his last lifetime.\u201cAmong all three Meridians, the Chakras seem to be the highest possible in existence. Maybe I will be able to open them up!\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at the Graph of Meridians and pondered on the \u201cChakras\u201d. He wanted to open this Meridian up under his skin.After nine days of studying, Zhang Ruochen came up with some ideas. He transferred the Genuine Qi into his skin. However, he failed with every trial and was badly hurt.\u201cDoes it even exist?\u201d Zhang Ruochen questioned himself. No matter how hard and how many times he had tried, he could not open the Meridians. He was sweaty. His shirt was all wet because of the numerous trials.Suddenly, he heard a voice coming from the Yin Yang Wooden Graph. \u201cHey, young man! Let me tell you. The Chakras do exist! Just the way you that you are trying to obtain them is wrong!\u201d\u201cMy method is wrong? So what\u2019s the correct way to open them? Tell me now!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.That voice responded by saying, \u201cHaha! If you let me get out of this wooden graph, I\u2019ll tell you. Well, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to hurt you. The Yin Yang Wooden Graph will suppress me if I hurt you. As long as you think about it, you can put me back into the graph!\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen thought about it, the Yin Yang Wooden Graph dashed out immediately from his glabella.He held the Yin Yang Wooden Graph firmly. He started transferring the Genuine Qi to the graph in order to unleash the sealing stamp and he released the giant black cat.\u201cYou can tell me now! How can I open the Chakras?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.The giant black cat said, \u201cThe answer is already in your hands.\u201d\u201cIn my hands?\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at the Sacred Prime Tree on the graph. It seemed that he figured something out and yelled, \u201cThe Sacred Prime Tree?\u201dThe giant black cat nodded and said, \u201cIf you see yourself as a human being, surely you won\u2019t be able to open the Chakras. Now imagine, if you see yourself as a tree, maybe it\u2019ll be easier for you to obtain it!\u201dZhang Ruochen then walked out from the blind area in the past as if there was a flashlight to guide him out. He sat on the ground and stared at the Sacred Prime Tree in the graph, trying to imagine that he was the tree.It had been two days since he moved an inch, as if he had turned into a thousand-year-old Divine Tree. Even his pulse seemed to have stopped.At this moment, he had already entered a realm which was a mystery of mysteries. He took a bottle of Marrow-washing Liquid unconsciously and started opening up the Chakras.After two hours of practicing, there was a layer of a faint halo shining on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s skin.A white, thin line circulated on his skin as if he had been wrapped by a massive net.The giant black cat widened his eyes with surprise and thought,\u00a0\u201cOh my god\u2026 he made it! Nyima\u2026 do the Chakras really exist?\u201dIn fact, the giant black cat knew nothing about the Chakras. He randomly told Zhang Ruochen that he knew the key to open the Chakras to help himself get out of the graph.\u201cI made it!\u201dHe was extremely excited about the fact that he had finally opened up the Chakras.The Meridians looked like a gleam of light, flowing around on his skin.Once he revolved the Genuine Qi, there would be a transparent armor on the surface of his skin. Even if he were to stand still and let people attacked him freely, random swords would never be able to pierce through his skin.This was his 24th Meridian!By opening the tough Chakras, it greatly boosted Zhang Ruochen\u2019s confidence. He did not waste his time resting but continued opening other Meridians so that he could break through to the Final State of the Yellow Realm.Another four days had gone by. Altogether, he opened up 27 Meridians and reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm.The capacity of his Qi Pool had enlarged 10 times more after breaking through the realm.\u201c27 Meridians\u2026 that\u2019s awesome! If I keep working hard, my capability will go beyond my last lifetime. With my power now, I guess I would be able to knock away the warriors in the Completion of the Yellow Realm!\u201dWarriors who reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm could break out the Strength of 25 Bulls.When Zhang Ruochen first broke through to the Medium State of the Yellow Realm and displayed the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, he successfully erupted with the Strength of 25 Bulls. Furthermore, when he was at the Peak at this stage, he broke out the Strength of 36 Bulls!And now, he had already made it to the Final State of the Yellow Realm.Zhang Ruochen would easily break out the Strength of 36 Bulls with a random palm. If he demonstrated the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, it was sure that his power level would equal 49 Bulls.The best explosiveness of Zhang Ruochen at the moment was 49 bulls, which fairly doubled up the power of warriors who had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm.There was a myth saying that if the warriors in the Yellow Realm could reach the power of 100 bulls, it would be called the \u201cPower of Realm\u201d. However, no one had exceeded such a limit.Not even those with magnificent martial techniques and physical quality.In fact, Zhang Ruochen had never encountered anybody who could break out the Strength of 100 Bulls. There were warriors whose power was close but no one had ever reached 100, the perfect number.When he reached the Peak of the Yellow Realm in his previous life, he could only break out the Strength of 94 Bulls.\u201cYoung man! I have to say, you have almost caught up with me when I was young!\u201d said the giant black cat, flattering him.Zhang Ruochen eventually calmed himself down from the practice. He glanced at the giant black cat and said, \u201cThere are eight basic types of Inscriptions of Space. I can possibly carve six of them\u2014the Inscription of pointy, the Inscription of transverse-type, the Inscription of lengthways, the Inscription of Height, the Inscription of line-type, and the Inscription flat-type. However, I can\u2019t carve the remaining two inscriptions no matter how hard I try. Do you know what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d\u201cWhat?! You\u2019re able to carve six types of inscriptions now? How is that even possible?\u201d The giant black cat could not believe what Zhang Ruochen had just said and kept shaking his head.Indeed, before Zhang Ruochen broke through to the Final State of the Yellow Realm, he was able to carve six basic types of Inscriptions of Space. Such a talented warrior with no doubt about what he had achieved with three months of practice.In order to convince the giant black cat, Zhang Ruochen took out six pieces of Spiritual Paper and carved the inscriptions on the paper using the inscription pen at his fastest speed. Shortly after, six inscriptions were displayed on the Spiritual Paper.The giant black cat crawled toward and stared at the inscriptions on the six pieces of Spiritual Paper. He nodded and praised it. \u201cThis is wonderful! You can surely carve all the six basic types of Inscriptions of Space! You\u2019ve mentioned that you still can\u2019t carve the remaining two inscriptions\u2014the Inscription of strain-type and the Inscription of condensing, right? Well, it\u2019s normal as these two inscriptions are a lot more difficult and complex compared to the other six. Do you have any carved jade with you, young man?\u201d\u201cCarved jade?\u201dZhang Ruochen did not understand what it was saying but he still took down the jade thumb ring from his thumb and placed it on his palm. He asked, \u201cWhy do you ask for carved jade?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe giant black cat quickly glanced at the jade thumb ring. He nodded and said, \u201cThe quality of the jade is pretty good. You can use it for refining weapons.\u201d\u201cRefining weapons?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked with hesitation.The giant black cat responded, \u201cYes! Refining weapons! You have already learned how to carve the six basic types of Inscriptions of Space. You will be able to refine the simplest Genuine Martial Arm of space\u2014the Spatial Ring. In the entire Yunwu Commandery, you are the only one who has the ability to refine the ring!\u201d\u201cWhat is the Spatial Ring?\u201d Zhang Ruochen\u2019s mind was full of questions.The cat continued, \u201cA Spatial Ring is an independent space being constructed inside the ring. If your Spiritual Power and cultivation are powerful enough, the ring you define will be able to store a mountain or even the world! By all means, if you can create a space one cubic meter in size with your cultivation at the moment, that will be a very decent achievement!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed to be only a palm-sized bag, yet it was able to store an entire mountain.The Xumi Primordial Bag was classified as a highly precious treasure. There were less than 10 pieces in all of Kunlun\u2019s Field. It was said that it had been passed on since the Medieval Ancient Times and was refined and worshipped by a saint.Many of the weapon refiners always wanted to counterfeit the Xumi Primordial Bag. Not a single person had succeeded.In Zhang Ruochen\u2019s previous life, he was Emperor Ming\u2019s son. He was well-educated and had a broad knowledge of the world. Hence, he knew that treasures like the Xumi Primordial Bag existed.\u201cOpening an independent space inside the ring\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the same characteristic as the Xumi Primordial Bag?\u201d Zhang Ruochen was shocked by its function.The giant black cat said, \u201cThe Xumi Primordial Bag is a space treasure refined by Saint Monk Xumi. I\u2019m sure there will only be a few pieces left through the progress of passing on the space treasure until this era. Each of them is extremely valuable.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the Xumi Primordial Bag was refined by Saint Monk Xumi! Well, I also want to try refining a space treasure with my capability!\u201dZhang Ruochen was excited. He thought that if he could refine and produce space treasures, by then he could sell them at a very costly price and the profit would be used to buy more spiritual pills for his cultivation.He gripped the inscription pen hard and transferred and implanted the Genuine Qi from his body into the inscription pen.The inscription pen instantly displayed a white splendor. A gleam of white light extended from the top of the pen and entered the jade thumb ring.Zhang Ruochen paid full attention to control the inscription pen and carved the base of the Inscription of Space inside the jade thumb ring.Drawing the inscription was a task that required extreme meticulousness and consumed a lot of Spiritual Power.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe first inscription had been successfully carved!Zhang Ruochen did not stop but kept up the good work. Shortly after, he had finished the second inscription!The third inscription, the fourth one, the fifth one, the sixth one\u2026When Zhang Ruochen finished carving all six inscriptions, there was a layer of a light halo displaying on the surface of the jade thumb ring. A strand of the white inscription was flowing around the thumb ring.Soon, the halo disappeared and the white inscription penetrated into the thumb ring.\u201cHave I made it?\u201d Zhang Ruochen wondered.In order to clarify it, he immediately transferred a streak of Genuine Qi into the jade thumb ring.On the jade thumb ring\u2019s surface, there was a layer of halo and gleams of the white inscription. Zhang Ruochen touched the ring and felt like his entire arm had entered the ring.\u201cI made it! The area inside the jade thumb ring is one cubic meter large. Within the Spatial Ring, it contains six streaks of the inscription, which classifies as a third-class Genuine Martial Arm,\u201d said an ecstatic Zhang Ruochen.Bear in mind that this was his first-time refining a Spatial Ring and he had successfully made it!The giant black cat said, \u201cDon\u2019t be overjoyed with your little achievement! You\u2019ve only learned how to carve six basic types of Inscriptions of Space, yet you\u2019re still unable to control the size of the space when you refine it. Wait until you learn how to carve the remaining two inscriptions\u2014the Inscription of strain-type and the Inscription of condensing\u2014then the space that you refine in the Spatial Ring will definitely larger than one cubic meter!\u201cMoreover, what you have done is to carve the inscription on the jade thumb ring. The inscription is not solid enough. It will probably dispel with a slight bump.\u201cWhat you have to do is to utilize the method of refining weapons. By worshipping the Spatial Ring with fire, it empowers the inscription on the Spatial Ring. However, if you fail properly to manage the heat, you will probably destroy the Spatial Ring.\u201d The giant cat expressed a certain level of seriousness.Zhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cI get it. I\u2019ll head to the Federation of Inscription and borrow the weapon refining stove from Zuo En and, hopefully, I can fully refine the Spatial Ring!\u201d\u201cWait! I\u2019m going with you!\u201d\u201cPhhhf!\u201d The giant black cat thrust its feet and flew out from the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.Looking at the giant black cat who stood in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s room, Zhang Ruochen furrowed his eyebrows and decided to put it back into the Yin Yang Wooden Graph.Such a tricky cat could see through what Zhang Ruochen had in mind. He lay on the ground and cried, \u201cYoung man, I have been imprisoned in the Yin Yang Wooden Graph for more than 100,000 years! Though I have made massive mistakes, all these years I have atoned for my sins. I\u2019m only a cat. I\u2019m longing for freedom, longing for a brand new life! Mew! Besides, I am the one who guided you to open up the Chakras. Without my help, do you think you will be able to refine the Spatial Ring?\u201dConsidering that it had helped Zhang Ruochen to break through the Chakras, he said, \u201cOkay! I\u2019ll let you stay outside of the Yin Yang Wooden Graph for the time being. But, you have to stay next to me the entire time!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d The giant black cat rolled on the ground with excitement.Suddenly, Zhang Ruochen heard footsteps outside his room.\u201cMy ninth brother, are you still secluding yourself for refining?\u201dIt was the Ninth Commandery Princess Zhang Yuxi\u2019s voice.Zhang Ruochen opened the door and left the room. He looked at the Ninth Commandery Princess who waited outside his room and asked, \u201cMy ninth sister, what can I help you with?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was beautiful today. She was carrying a sword in forest green, wearing a silver silk pleated dress with her shiny black hair rolled up on the top of her head as well as a green belt tied around her tiny waist.She was so excited when she saw Zhang Ruochen. \u201cI heard that your cultivation has reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm. Therefore, I want to fight with you as a form of practice.\u201dIt had been less than two months since the Year-end Assessment.She could never foresee that Zhang Ruochen had not only broken through to the Medium State, but had also reached the Final State.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cI guess my ninth sister has also made some improvements and reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm?\u201dShe slightly shook her head and said, \u201cMe? It\u2019s not easy to reach the Final State of the Yellow Realm. I\u2019m only at the Peak of the Medium State. But, I\u2019ve practiced my sword comprehension to the realm of \u2018Sword Following the Heart\u2019. I think that even though I haven\u2019t yet reached the Final State, I\u2019ll be able to defeat warriors in the Final State.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded his head in consent. It was indeed hard for warriors who reached the realm of \u201cSword Following the Heart\u201d at such a young age.In fact, both the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan had just reached the Initial Stage of the Sword Following the Heart. Yet, Zhang Ruochen had made it to the Advanced Stage of the Sword Following the Heart and was thus beyond comparison.With any random sword technique, Zhang Ruochen would easily defeat them.He responded to Zhang Yuxi\u2019s request, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have time to practice with you now. I need to head over to the Federation of Inscription.\u201d\u201cNever mind! I can go with you. Let\u2019s take my cloud rabbit lunar rover.\u201d Her eyes glittered. It seemed that the Ninth Commandery Princess just wanted to spend time with Zhang Ruochen rather than practice Martial Arts with him.Then, she walked toward Zhang Ruochen and held his arms as if she was not evasive to demonstrate a sense of intimacy.Zhang Ruochen looked a bit shy. Although they were brother and sister of different mothers, they were still attached by the blood of the same father. Soon after, he got more comfortable with it.\u201cMew!\u201dThe fat black cat walked out of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s room casually as if it had gone for a walk.At the moment, the cat\u2019s size had been greatly minimized compared to its original size. It was just a bit bigger than a normal cat.\u201cMy ninth brother, you have a cat! It\u2019s so adorable! What\u2019s its name?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess lifted the cat up and touched its skin softly.\u201cMew!\u201dThe fat black cat pretended to behave itself. It rolled its eyeballs, stuck its tongue out, and licked the fingers of the Ninth Commandery Princess slightly.Zhang Ruochen glanced at the cat, shook his head and said, \u201cJust call it Blackie!\u201d\u201cBlackie!\u201dShe stretched out her finger and moderately patted Blackie\u2019s head.She could not imagine how angry it was to be called \u201cBlackie\u201d as it once was King of Slaughter in its previous life.\u201cThat is such an offense to me!\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an insult!\u201cFine! I\u2019ll just tolerate him! If I don\u2019t behave myself, he will send me back into the wooden graph\u2026\u201d\u00a0Blackie thought.Riding on the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019 carriage, Zhang Ruochen arrived at the Federation of Inscription again. He borrowed the weapon refining stove from Zuo En in order to refine and worship the Spatial Ring.The process of worshipping the Spatial Ring went unexpectedly well. Soon after, the first Spatial Ring had been produced and turned out as an actual product.A third-class Genuine Martial Arm\u2014the Spatial Ring.Zuo En stood aside observing the process of refining. He whispered while observing Zhang Ruochen, \u201cThe Ninth Prince is definitely an inborn master of refining weapons! It\u2019s his very first time to refine a weapon and he is able to control the heat with such an amazing technique. This is no doubt admirable!\u201dZhang Ruochen did not act arrogantly, but asked Zuo En with courtesy, \u201cWith my control over the heat, which class do you think my technique in terms of a weapon refiner is?\u201d\u201cThe peak of a first-class weapon refiner!\u201dZuo En continued, \u201cBe mindful, this is your first time worshipping a Genuine Martial Arm and you\u2019ve already fully shown your talent. I believe that you will reach the second-class of a weapon refiner very soon!\u201dBeing a second-class weapon refiner could enjoy a superior status in Yunwu Commandery.Moreover, if weapon refiners were willing to rely on a particular sect or a large-scale family, they could immediately enjoy the same treatment as a presbyter, or a status even more superior than a normal presbyter.\u201cSigh\u2026 my Spiritual Power has reached the third-class of a weapon refiner. Yet, my control over the heat is still not on point. Therefore, I can only classify myself as a second-class weapon refiner,\u201d Zuo En groaned.The Spiritual Power of a first-class weapon refiner was usually between level 15 to 20.For a second-class weapon refiner, it was between the levels 20 to 25.For a third-class weapon refiner, it was between level 25 to 30.Last but not least, the Spiritual Power of a fourth-class weapon refiner was between levels 30 to 35.The most senior master weapon refiner in Yunwu Commandery was Kong Tong, who was a fourth-class weapon refiner. Her Spiritual Power had reached level 34 and thus was called a master of Spiritual Power in Yunwu Commandery.Her status in Yunwu Commandery was more or less the same as Yunwu Commandery Prince.If Yunwu Commandery Prince wanted her to refine his weapons, he had to visit her in person. He had to negotiate with her in a fair and equal manner, because she was not only a fourth-class weapon refiner, but also Chief of the Federation of Inscription in Yunwu Commandery. Her status was extremely magnificent.Zuo En asked with curiosity, \u201cMy Ninth Prince, what exactly is the thumb ring that you\u2019re refining? Is it a kind of defensive Genuine Martial Arm?\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled and said, \u201cWell\u2026 let\u2019s keep that a secret for the time being!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShortly after, he left the weapon refining room. There was something bothering him in his mind, which was that he also wanted to buy a weapon refining stove.However, Qingxuan Pavilion sold the best weapon refining stoves in Yunwu City. If Zhang Ruochen wanted to pay a visit to it, he had no choice but to encounter the attractive hostess who had the ability to steal men\u2019s souls.Qin Ya was a very coquettish, charming, and attractive woman, who took the initiative to seduce Zhang Ruochen. She would make him commit a crime. It gave Zhang Ruochen a headache when he thought of this.By encountering such a lovely woman, he wondered if there was any man who could control himself to not be dominated by her.\u201cIf Yuxi goes with me, maybe the hostess will slightly behave herself.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen finally thought of an idea to prevent himself from falling into the hostess\u2019 seduction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both of them were the startling beauties of Yunwu Commandery and looked slim and pure, displaying a sense of pleasure.At that moment, they were scrambling to play with Blackie.\u201cBlackie, I know that you want to play with me, right?\u201d the Ninth Commandery Princess said with a threat.Shan Xiangling, however, talked to Blackie in a soft voice with her red lips shining and eyes blinking, \u201cBlackie, let\u2019s go to enjoy the best cuisine in the commandery!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess grabbed Blackie\u2019s ears, while Shan Xiangling grasped its tail. They both kept dragging Blackie toward themselves, as if they were going to tear it apart.The pain of being a toy between two pretties was unspeakable. Yet, Blackie was frightened that Zhang Ruochen would send it back into the wooden graph. Otherwise, it would have killed them for what they had done to it.\u201cThis is absolutely absurd!\u201cI once was King of Slaughter! From when have I become two women\u2019s toy?\u201d\u201cCreak!\u201dThe iron door of the refining room opened.Seeing Zhang Ruochen and Zuo En walk out of the room, the Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling let Blackie free almost at the same time. In a second, they returned to elegant ladies.The Ninth Commandery Princess slightly fixed her sleeves and dress, looking classic and elegant, while Shan Xiangling softly touched her long hair, presenting a feminine and pure image.\u201cBoom!\u201dBlackie lost its bearings, falling on the ground heavily with its eyes were full of stars.No one could imagine that two of the four beauties in Yunwu Commandery would scramble for a cat if one did not see it in person.Were they scrambling just for a cat?It was the fact that both of the Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling were beautiful and known as unrivaled beauties of the world. Any warrior would be honored to meet one of them. They wished they could dedicate all their assets just to see them smile.Whether or not they were one of the four beauties, it did not bother Zhang Ruochen. \u201cMy ninth sister, please accompany me to Qingxuan Pavilion. I need to buy a weapon refining stove.\u201d\u201cSure! Let\u2019s go!\u201dWith delight, the Ninth Commandery Princess instantly lifted Blackie up, who was lying on the floor. She blinked at Shan Xiangling as if she was demonstrating her victory of having either Blackie or Zhang Ruochen.\u201cYour Highness, I also need to go to the Qingxuan Pavilion. Can I join you both?\u201d Shan Xiangling\u2019s voice was always soft and displayed a sense of spirituality.\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Zhang Ruochen did not think too much about it and let her join them.The distance between the Federation of Inscription and Qingxuan Pavilion in the weapon market were quite close. Therefore, they did not ride in the carriage, but walked toward Qingxuan Pavilion.Then, something that Zhang Ruochen did not anticipate happened.Everyone knew that both the Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling were exceptionally beautiful and were goddesses for lots of warriors. The people who followed after them were countless, as the line for waiting to meet them had extended from the Federation of Inscription to the gate of Yunwu City.It was as difficult as climbing into the sky for one who wanted to meet any one of the four beauties. Yet, two of them were following behind a young man today. It surely caused quite a sensation in the Martial Market.\u201cIsn\u2019t she the daughter of Master of the Red Cloud Sect, Shan Xiangling, one of the four young beauties in Yunwu Commandery? She is exceptionally beautiful as if she were a fairy coming out from the graph!\u201d\u201cHow about the lady beside her? Her splendor is more or less the same as Miss Shan!\u201d\u201cHow can you not know the Ninth Commandery Princess, Zhang Yuxi? She is called a beauty of Yunwu Commandery, just like Miss Shan. There are numerous followers wanting to approach her in Yunwu City. Most of them are superior with a strong martial cultivation.\u201dNot far away, there were two young men sitting opposite each other on a pavilion. They also glanced at Zhang Ruochen, Zhang Yuxi, and Shan Xiangling as the three of them just walked by.Liu Chengfeng looked cold-blooded and stared at Zhang Ruochen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe both Shan Xiangling and the Ninth Commandery Princess are accompanying him to the market! When did such a young man get so popular in Yunwu City?\u201dThe man sitting opposite Liu Chengfeng was called Situ Ge, Situ Linjiang\u2019s elder brother.Situ Ge chuckled. \u201cOh my brother! Don\u2019t you recognize him? He is Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s ninth son. Not long ago, he obtained first place in the Year-end Assessment. He is now the hottest genius in Yunwu City! Well\u2026 what beauty doesn\u2019t love a genius? Not to mention his superior status. He has surely become the idol of young women!\u201dLiu Chengfeng giggled. \u201cI know who he is. Being first in the Year-end Assessment\u2026 so what? He\u2019s just the first among the Royal Family and their relatives in the younger generation. Compared to the entire young generation in Yunwu City, I guess he can fairly make into the top 10. Yet, I bet ranking in the top 20 in Yunwu Commandery will be too much hard work for him. It makes sense though! His cultivation has just reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm. Haha!\u201dLiu Chengfeng smirked slightly and looked contemptuous.Situ Ge had watched the fight between Zhang Ruochen and Situ Linjiang. He clearly knew that Zhang Ruochen was indeed magnificent. \u201cAlthough his cultivation is in the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm, he is able to defeat the young geniuses in the Final State. He is not someone to mess with! When he breaks through to the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, I guess he can still barely confront the warriors in the Completion.\u201dLiu Chengfeng said, \u201cHow is that possible? The Meridians inside a Completion warrior\u2019s body are all fixed. It\u2019s called succeeding the body of Martial Arts. It\u2019s incomparable to the warriors in the Final State of the Yellow Realm. Even if he breaks through to the Medium State, he will be defeated by the Completion warriors within three moves.\u201dSitu Ge giggled. \u201cWith your martial cultivation, it\u2019s more than sufficient to make it to the top three among the young warriors in Yunwu City. Moreover, you\u2019re in the Peak of the Completion of the Yellow Realm. No matter how talented the Ninth Prince is, he won\u2019t be strong enough to compete with you until he makes it to the Completion Stage.\u201dThe so-called young generation referred to the warriors who were under age 20.Liu Chengfeng had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm at 17 years old. Excluding the Seventh Prince, who had incredible talent and had always been ranked ahead of him, none of the other geniuses were capable of withstanding any of his moves during a fight.There was a delighted smile on Liu Chengfeng\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity that the Ninth Prince is still so weak. Otherwise, he\u2019d be classified as one of my strongest opponents. To be honest, I\u2019m totally not concerned with his cultivation.\u201dSitu Ge chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re only interested in Miss Shan, aren\u2019t you? Unfortunately, she feels like she is more into the Ninth Prince. If you do like her, I suggest you take the initiative and talk to her. Otherwise, she will soon become the Ninth Prince\u2019s woman!\u201d\u201cHmph! My status in the Martial Market Bank is almost the same as the Ninth Prince\u2019s. Is that still a matter if I want a woman?\u201d Liu Chengfeng said with arrogance.Liu Chuanshen, Liu Chengfeng\u2019s father, was the chief of the Martial Market Bank in Yunwu Commandery. The Martial Market Bank was financially powerful and had lured numerous strong warriors to support them.Liu Chuanshen was seen as having a massive control over Yunwu Commandery\u2019s economy.Being Liu Chuanshen\u2019s son, Liu Chengfeng was certainly a famous person in Yunwu Commandery.If he really loved Shan Xiangling, what he had to do was to express his feeling toward Master of the Red Cloud Sect, who would certainly be more than ecstatic to marry his daughter off to Liu Chengfeng. It would only be beneficial if the Red Cloud Sect could socialize with the Martial Market Bank.However, Liu Chengfeng did not want to marry Shan Xiangling. He just wanted to have fun with her and treated her like a prostitute.With his status and talent in Martial Arts, he had already found someone better for marriage. To Liu Chengfeng, Shan Xiangling was just a Master\u2019s daughter and was only worth spending a night with. Afterward, he was going to dump her away.\u2026Qingxuan Pavilion was located in the weapon market.Qin Ya was naked and her snow-white body was comfortably lying in a pool carved out of a jade stone.There was a creamy white liquid in the pool, emanating a vague icy air that completely wrapped her exquisite embossed figure. Her plumpy breasts and buttocks, tiny waist and slim, long legs\u2026 all were partly visible within the air. It was exceptionally attractive.If any men were to see such a beautiful scene, blood from their nose would surely spurt non-stop.At this moment, Mo Hanlin was sitting outside the pool with his whole body clenched tightly. He did not dare to look toward the pool as he asked with a faltering voice, \u201cMy hostess, we\u2019ve eroded half of the financial affairs of the Martial Market Bank. They are no longer our competitor. Shall we start working on Liu Chuanshen and dispeling the entire Martial Market Bank in Yunwu Commandery?\u201dQin Ya squinted her shining eyes, glistened her long eyelashes where drops of water fell from, one by one.Her crystal clear red lips slightly moved. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush! The power of the Martial Market Bank is still strong. It\u2019s not as easy as it seems. Moreover, if we take down the Martial Market Bank, the official power of Yunwu Commandery will also get involved. It\u2019ll only make things complicated.\u201cYunwu Commandery Prince will never allow us to take control over the economy of Yunwu Commandery. On top of that, the Black Market is longing to dismiss the Martial Market Bank. Let them fight first! We\u2019ll wait for the perfect moment and take them down!\u201dMo Hanlin nodded in agreement.\u201cTip, tap!\u201dThe sound of footsteps resounded.A maidservant came inside and bowed toward the pool and said, \u201cMy hostess, the Ninth Prince has arrived at Qingxuan Pavilion. He wants to buy a weapon refining stove, which is a seventh-class Genuine Martial Arm.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Hanlin sat there freezing with his sweat. He had to seize this opportunity to leave the pool, so he stood up and said, \u201cMy hostess, let me welcome him!\u201d\u201cWait! Since it\u2019s the Ninth Prince, how can I not greet him in person?\u201dQin Ya opened her attractive eyes. She walked out of the pool, took a red, thin yarn and wrapped her seductive body. Water dropped on her white back and glided on the jade stone.Zhang Ruochen was the first ever man who was able to deal with her seduction. His Spiritual Power and determination were far greater than anyone else\u2019s, hence Qin Ya was very interested in him.Furthermore, she suspected that there was a superior warrior helping Zhang Ruochen. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to reach the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm within three months.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of them is owned by the chief of the Federation of Inscription while the other one is right in front of you.\u201dQin Ya led Zhang Ruochen to the armory where the three-meter tall bronze weapon refining stove was kept.This time, rather than just the two of them going in alone, the Ninth Commandery Princess, Shan Xiangling, and Mo Hanlin were together as well.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes were fixed on the massive stove in front of him. Nodding in satisfaction, he said, \u201cThis weapon refining stove should be very expensive.\u201dIf it was not expensive, it would have been bought by any weapon refiners long ago.Pursing her lips, Qin Ya chuckled softly and said, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s expensive. I usually set the base price at two million silver coins when other weapon refiners ask about it. Since it\u2019s the Ninth Prince, I\u2019m willing to offer you a half-price. One million silver coins and that\u2019s it. No more bargaining!\u201d\u201cOne million silver coins? That\u2019s way too expensive! It seems like you\u2019re robbing us blind!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said in a slightly displeased manner. She was obviously annoyed with Qin Ya.Even Shan Xiangling was secretly surprised. The Red Cloud Sect only made half a million silver coins for the entire year. Yet, a single piece of weapon refining stove could easily cost one million silver coins, which would be the double of her sect\u2019s annual income.\u201cThis stove was excessively expensive!\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head and said, \u201cNo. Not at all. It\u2019s actually very cheap. A Seventh-Class Genuine Martial Arms weapon is sold for at least one million silver coins. A weapon refining stove of the same class will certainly cost more, with its price exceeding two million silver coins. Madame, if you keep offering low prices, I\u2019m afraid you will go out of business very soon!\u201d\u201cNo amount of money can fill the void I feel within. If the Ninth Prince can spend a night with me, I\u2019m more than happy to give you the weapon refining stove for free.\u201d Qin Ya said flirtatiously as she stared at Zhang Ruochen with eyes full of affection. How seductive!Zhang Ruochen coughed dryly, feeling a little awkward. He replied, \u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019ll collect one million silver coins as soon as possible. I hope you can keep the weapon refining stove on hold for the time being. I\u2026 I\u2019m in a rush. I\u2019ll excuse myself first.\u201dHaving said that, Zhang Ruochen quickly walked out of the armory as if he was running away from danger.The Ninth Commandery Princess ran after Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cNinth brother, are you sure you want to buy that weapon refining stove? A million silver coins is not a small sum! Even though the Royal Family sends silver coins to all our brothers and sisters every month, it\u2019s still impossible to raise a million silver coins from what we get!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting three thousand silver coins a month for basic expenses, which is already the most among all princesses. I guess you can only receive up to five thousand at most for a month?\u201dZhang Ruochen replied calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, ninth sister! I\u2019m not going to rely on the funds allocated by the Royal Family. Very soon I\u2019ll be able to collect one million silver coins!\u201dA Seventh-Class Genuine Martial Arms weapon refining stove was not easily available anywhere. Thus, Zhang Ruochen could not miss the chance of getting it.Once he had the weapon refining stove, he could use it to refine Spatial Rings anytime. By then, he would have an endless supply of the rings and money would no longer be an issue.Now, he only had eight hundred thousand silver coins, which were all deposited in the Martial Market Bank.How was he going to collect the remaining two hundred thousand silver coins?Zhang Ruochen glanced at the Spatial Ring on his thumb out of the corner of his eyes. Suddenly, an idea popped into his mind. He smiled and said, \u201cThe Martial Market Bank!\u201dQin Ya\u2019s face darkened and her smile disappeared as soon as she walked out of the armory. Looking at the direction where Zhang Ruochen, the Ninth Commandery Princess, and Shan Xiangling left, she said in a low tone, \u201cHe\u2019s able to demonstrate the technique of Multitasking during the Year-end Assessment. He must have practiced his spiritual power till level 20 or above.\u201dMo Hanlin stood behind Qin Ya and his expression flickered. He said, \u201cHe\u2019s only 16 years old, I think it\u2019s not quite possible for him to practice his spiritual power up to level 20!\u201d\u201cNeither do I. After all, the spiritual power of a human body is limited. It\u2019s theoretically impossible to obtain such incredible martial arts talent as well as the spiritual power. However, since he\u2019s so determined to buy the weapon refining stove, he probably wants to become a weapon refiner. Perhaps his spiritual power is indeed brilliant!\u201dQin Ya narrowed her eyes as her curiosity grew. Driven by the desire to test out her theory, she said, \u201cMo Hanlin, check with the Federation of Inscription. I\u2019m sure the Ninth Prince has been there for a few times recently. I want to know the exact level of his spiritual power!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll head off now!\u201d Mo Hanlin bowed to Qin Ya and hurried away.\u201cHuh! Boy, you make me even more curious now!\u201d Qin Ya stuck out her soft tongue and licked her red lips while laughing in a coquettish manner.Zhang Ruochen, the Ninth Commandery Princess, and Shan Xiangling rode on the carriage and headed to the Martial Market Bank.The Ninth Commandery Princess asked, \u201cNinth brother, why are we heading to the Martial Market Bank? Do you have a million silver coins kept over there?\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled and responded, \u201cWell\u2026 I did have a million silver coins, but I\u2019ve spent some. Now, there are around eight hundred thousand silver coins left.\u201dShan Xiangling\u2019s eyes lit up with surprise when she heard this. She was shocked by how much assets Zhang Ruochen had at such a young age.\u201cEight hundred thousand? Impossible! Ninth brother, where did you get that massive amount of money from?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess was extremely surprised. She could not believe her ears.Not to mention Ninth Commandery Princess, even if it was a leader from any other large-scale family in the Yunwu City, it was still difficult to come up with eight hundred thousand silver coins right away.Even though the Lin\u2019s could come up with 1.2 million silver coins to purchase the low-class of Spiritual sword skill, it was thanks to the financial capability of the entire family rather than Lin Fengxian himself.It would be good enough if Lin Fengxian could come up with half a million silver coins at once.Zhang Ruochen had nothing to hide. When he purchased the weapon refining stove later, his wealth would still be exposed anyway.Moreover, no one would dare to steal from him in the Yunwu City, knowing that he was one of the superiors in the Royal Family, the Ninth Prince.\u201cEven if the Ninth Prince has eight hundred thousand silver coins with him, he\u2019ll still need two hundred thousand more in order to buy the weapon refining stove.\u201d Shan Xiangling said softly.Zhang Ruochen replied, \u201cThat\u2019s why we are heading to the Martial Market Bank. I\u2019m going to do a business with them. As for what kind of business, I can\u2019t tell you now.\u201dZhang Ruochen had a feeling that the Martial Market Bank would surely be interested in the Spatial Ring.Being able to store treasures inside the Spatial Ring would be very useful for the Martial Market Bank!By doing business with the Martial Market Bank, it would fully maximize the profit he could get from the Spatial Ring.The magnificently constructed Martial Market Bank was tightly guarded. A large number of armored royal guards could be seen watching over all sides of the bank at any time.In terms of the defensive power, Martial Market Bank was second only to the palace of the Yunwu Commandery.The moment Zhang Ruochen, the Ninth Commandery Princess, and Shan Xiangling got off the carriage, a figure quickly approached them.\u201cGreetings, the Ninth Prince and the Ninth Commandery Princess. I\u2019m the Ninth Steward of the Martial Market Bank.\u201d An old man with goatee beard hurriedly walked over and greeted Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess with great respect and courtesy.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cDo you know me?\u201dThe Ninth Steward smiled and said, \u201cIf I can\u2019t even recognize the Ninth Prince, then I\u2019m not qualified to be the Martial Market Bank\u2019s steward.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s great! I want to discuss a huge business opportunity with the Manager of the Martial Market Bank. I was hoping Mr steward could be my referral.\u201d\u201cHa ha! Who do you think you are? You\u2019re just one of the nine princes, how dare you ask the Manager to do a business with you? If so, you should have made Commandery Prince Yunwu come here in person!\u201d Liu Chengfeng walked out from the main door of the Martial Market Bank with his head held high. He had an arrogant expression on his face and his gaze was just as unfriendly.It seemed that he wanted to compare himself to Zhang Ruochen, thus, he brought two young and beautiful maids with him. They appeared to be around 14 or 15 years old.However, their appearance and manner still paled in comparison to the Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling.Liu Chengfeng said with a sense of superiority, \u201cIf you really have a business to discuss, I can do it with you. Given my status, it\u2019s more than enough.\u201dZhang Ruochen was not sure if he should believe his words. He gave Liu Chengfeng a thorough once-over and replied blandly, \u201cThe business I would like to discuss\u2026 With your status, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not qualified enough to do so.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? Do you even know who I am?\u201d Liu Chengfeng\u2019s expression quickly turned cold.\u201cActually, I\u2019m not too sure who you are!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said nonchalantly.Liu Chengfeng said with a hint of pride, \u201cWell, listen up! I\u2019m Liu Chengfeng, the son of the Manager of the Martial Market Bank. Even though you\u2019ve never met me in person, you should have at least heard of my name before!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve never heard of your name!\u201d Ignoring Liu Chengfeng, Zhang Ruochen turned to the Ninth Steward and said, \u201cMr steward, please pass my message to the Manager. If he doesn\u2019t want to see me, I\u2019ll leave right away.\u201d\u201cMy Ninth Prince, please wait here for a moment. \u201dThe Ninth Steward immediately went to notify the Manager about this matter.In fact, if he was the feeble Zhang Ruochen before obtaining the Sacred Mark, he would not have a chance to enjoy such treatment. However, it was different now. His outstanding performance in the Year-end Assessment had successfully aroused the attention and interest of many major powers in the Yunwu City.No one would look down on such an extraordinary genius. Who knew if he would become the king of Yunwu Commandery in the future?Zhang Ruochen\u2019s action had completely enraged Liu Chengfeng. Zhang Ruochen casually dismissed him in front of everyone as if he was someone of no importance. It made him feel like he had lost all his face in front of Shan Xiangling.\u201cHuh! Let\u2019s see! I\u2019m sure my father won\u2019t receive you. With your martial cultivation, you\u2019re just a tiny little ant in my father\u2019s eyes,\u201d Liu Chengfeng said coldly with disdain in his voice.Zhang Ruochen did not bother to respond to him. He stood with his arms crossed, patiently waiting for the steward.The Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling did not hide the contempt they had for Liu Chengfeng, showing a disdainful expression on their faces. They felt that Liu Chengfeng was too rude and lack of manner. He was not even worth comparing to Zhang Ruochen.\u2026\u201cThe Ninth Prince? Does he want to do business with me?\u201dLiu Chuanshen stood next to the lake, his hands clasped behind his back. The aura emanating from him resembled a lofty mountain, giving people a sense of superiority.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes, he does. If my Manager doesn\u2019t want to see him, I\u2019ll ask him to leave. But\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201dThe Ninth Steward kneeled down on the ground and continued to say, \u201cThat\u2019s another matter. I\u2019ve already found out the identity of the mystery man who auctioned the low-class of Spiritual sword skill in the Central Auction. The mystery man is the same person, the Ninth Prince. He currently has eight hundred thousand silver coins deposited in the Martial Market Bank.\u201d\u201cWow! It\u2019s unbelievable for a young man like him to have such fortune! What kind of adventure has he encountered in these few months?\u201dA faint smile broke out on Liu Chuanshen\u2019s face. He said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no harm meeting him. Perhaps it\u2019ll bring me some pleasant surprises!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Manager is waiting for you in the bank.\u201dThe Ninth Steward led the way in the front and accompanied Zhang Ruochen to the Martial Market Bank.The Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling stayed outside the bank. Neither of them was entitled to meet the Manager of the Martial Market Bank.After Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Steward left, Liu Chengfeng frowned and thought, \u201cWhat a bastard! I can\u2019t believe my father wants to see him! What virtues does he exactly have?\u201dThen, he cut out the cold-blooded face and looked over to Shan Xiangling and the Ninth Commandery Princess. He displayed a heroic smile and waved at Shan Xiangling. \u201cMiss Shan, I\u2019ve heard about you a long time ago. I wonder if I have a chance to sightsee the Yunwu City with you?\u201dIn his point of view, the daughter of Master of the Red Cloud Sect would not turn down the son of the Martial Market Bank\u2019s Manager.Once he got to spend time with her alone, he had a great chance to take her down!\u2026Liu Chuanshen was considered as a legendary person in Yunwu Commandery. He had control over all the armed force and financial resources of the Martial Market Bank in Yunwu Commandery and he was classified as one of the top ten in Yunwu Commandery.Except for people like the Commandery Prince Yunwu, it would be as difficult as to climb up to the sky for other ordinary warriors to meet him.When Zhang Ruochen first saw Liu Chuanshen, he was able to feel that his martial cultivation was unfathomable. He had displayed a powerful strength from head to toes.If an ordinary warrior stood in front of Liu Chuanshen, he would have been trembled and fear to look into his eyes.Zhang Ruochen however, was not an ordinary warrior. He said pleasantly, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of your name years ago, my Manager. You\u2019re certainly a legend!\u201d\u201cThe Ninth Prince is such a rarity, I\u2019ve also heard of how talented you are!\u201d Liu Chuanshen stood at the inner part of the living room, intentionally exposed his powerful thrust so as to suppress Zhang Ruochen.He had watched every single move of Zhang Ruochen after he walked into the living room. He praised Zhang Ruochen to himself as Zhang Ruochen had demonstrated a calm and humble attitude. He wondered how nice it would be if Liu Chengfeng, his son, could behave like Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen sat opposite to Liu Chuanshen and said, \u201cMr. Liu, I\u2019ll simply go straight to the point. The reason why I\u2019m here at the Martial Market Bank is, to do a business with you, the Manager of the bank. I believe my Manager won\u2019t disappoint after taking a look at my product!\u201dAt the same time, Zhang Ruochen took off the Spatial Ring, placed it on the table and passed it to Liu Chuanshen.\u201cJust a jade thumb ring?\u201d Liu Chuanshen looked at the jade thumb ring and frowned his eyebrows in confusion.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cPlease, my Manager, try to transfer your Genuine Qi into the ring.\u201dLiu Chuanshen immediately transferred his Genuine Qi into the jade thumb ring as Zhang Ruochen said. He activated six Inscription of Space on the jade thumb ring. A layer of white halo eventually floated out on the ring.Liu Chuanshen put his hand out to the jade thumb ring. His hand disappeared all of a sudden as if it had been swallowed by the jade thumb ring.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThere was a light of splendid in Liu Chuanshen\u2019s eyes. He looked at the ring and said with excitement, \u201cThere is a space inside the thumb ring! I wonder where does my majesty get such a space treasure!\u201dZhang Ruochen answered, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m not available to disclose its details.\u201dLiu Chuanshen recovered his Genuine Qi and calmed his excitement. He said, \u201cThere are less than ten pieces of space treasures among the entire Kunlun\u2019s Field, each of them is incredibly precious. Yet, the class of your space treasure seems to be quite low, my ninth prince. Its space is narrow. I guess it can barely classify as a Third-Class Genuine Martial Arm.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cIf I sell the space treasure to my Manager, what will the price be?\u201dLiu Chuanshen was indeed very interested in such a space treasure. Yet, he acted exceptionally calm in order to keep up his power over Zhang Ruochen. He said, \u201cA normal Third-Class Genuine Martial Arm usually costs between 3,000 to 10,000 silver coins. Since it\u2019s a space treasure, the price will surely be higher. It is worth 10 thousand silver coins.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred thousand silver coins.\u201d Without hesitation, Zhang Ruochen set the price at 20 times more than the original price straight away.Liu Chuanshen smiled while he shook his head, \u201cMy Ninth Prince, you\u2019re not doing a business but robbing me! Let me tell you, this is not how you do business. If the space of the ring is 10 times larger, I\u2019ll be happy to pay two hundred thousand silver coins for it!\u201d \u201cTo be honest, the internal space of this treasure is indeed too small! How about this, I\u2019ll buy your Spatial Ring under my name with twenty thousand silver coins. What do you think?\u201d\u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand!\u201d Zhang Ruochen made another offer.\u201cThirty thousand!\u201d Liu Chuanshen kept bargaining.\u201cA hundred and twenty thousand silver coins!\u201d\u201cForty thousand!\u201dAfterall the bargaining, Zhang Ruochen made the final deal. \u201cOne hundred thousand! This is my bottom line!\u201d\u201cDeal! One hundred thousand silver coins!\u201d Liu Chuanshen laughed out loud and put on the Spatial Ring placed on the table. He took a detailed look at the ring and grinned, \u201cMy ninth prince, do you prefer transferring the one hundred thousand coins to your Three-star VIP Card under the Martial Market Bank or convert it to the Spiritual Crystal?\u201dZhang Ruochen was scolding such a cunning fox in his heart and said grumpily, \u201cJust put it into my Three-star VIP Card!\u201dAfter selling the Spatial Ring, Zhang Ruochen was still in need of one hundred thousand silver coins in order to buy the weapon refining stove.He would have to think another way to collect the rest of the coins.Liu Chuanshen handed over Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Three-star VIP Card after transferring the coins to his account. Zhang Ruochen wondered, \u201cSince I\u2019m here at the Martial Market Bank, I should also pay a visit the Coliseum of the Martial Market. I guess I should be able to make the rest of the one hundred thousand silver coins in the Coliseum of the Martial Market.\u201dThe \u201cColiseum of the Martial Market\u201d was a drill ground operated by the Martial Market Bank with a long history. It represented the martial arts spirits of warriors and was a good place for getting famous.Once warriors who were confident in their cultivation, most of them would fight in Coliseum of the Martial Market so as to prove their abilities.Any warriors who obtained a ten winning streak in the Coliseum of the Martial Market, a massive amount of silver coins would be rewarded. Moreover, they could also earn a place on the ranking operated by the Martial Market Bank.Once warriors who got onto the ranking, they would get fame in the entire commandery.Nonetheless, if the fighting force of the warriors were powerful enough as well as high enough in their ranking in the Coliseum of the Martial Market, they would also be well-known in other commanderies.Martial Market Bank had set up four boards\u2014the Yellow Board, the Profound Board, the Earth Board, and the Heaven Board.Martial Market Bank was located all over the commandery with a flourished intelligence system. Not only they would analyze the performance of the warriors in the fighting ground, but also collected all information of the warriors from the system. It, therefore, would conclude the final ranking of the warriors after organizing the information.As a result, the accuracy of the four boards under the Martial Market Bank was particularly high.In order to become one of the fighters on the ranking, warriors had to participate in the fights in the Coliseum of the Martial Market. Otherwise, the Martial Market Bank would not be able to calculate all the details of countless warriors in such a big commandery.On the Yellow Stage Coliseum, warriors would be eligible to rank in the Yellow Board. The more winning streak warriors obtained, the higher ranking they achieved in the Yellow Board.Same rules applied to the rest of the boards. Warriors would be entitled on the Profound Board if they obtained a ten winning streak in the Profound Stage Coliseum.Entering the Earth Board by getting a ten winning streak in Earth Stage Coliseum.Nevertheless, warriors could go into the Heaven Board by obtaining a ten winning streak in the Heaven Stage Coliseum.Due to the fact that there were only a few warriors of the Earth Realm and the Heaven Realm, therefore, neither the Earth Stage nor the Heaven Stage Coliseum had been constructed in the Yunwu Commandery.With Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation at the moment, he could only be eligible to join the fight in the Yellow Stage Coliseum.Once he obtained a ten winning streak in this Coliseum, he would be awarded the one hundred thousand silver coins that he needed. On top of it, he would also become one of the members on the Yellow Board.There were only 27 warriors of the Yellow Board in the entire Yunwu Commandery. Hence, every one of them was incredible and dominated the Yellow Realm.Indeed, the mobility of warriors of the Yellow Board was high. It was because the warriors of the Yellow Board themselves had reached the peak of the Completion. They would breakthrough to the Black Realm anytime. Once they had broken through it, they would no longer classify as warriors of the Yellow Board.It was seen as a circulation. The older warriors would be replaced by a younger group of warriors of the Yellow Board when they left. In conclusion, the number of the warriors of the Yellow Board in the Yunwu Commandery retained between 20-30.In the Yunwu Commandery, they held their separated ranking of the warriors of the Yellow Board which warriors from other commanderies would not be counted. In other words, the ranking of the warriors of the Yellow Board would be from 1-27 in the entire Yunwu Commandery.Liu Chengfeng was one of the warriors of the Yellow Board. The best result he had achieved was a 13 winning streak in the Coliseum of the Martial Market, ranking 11 on the Yellow Board.Among the younger generation, he was classified as one of the most powerful warriors in the Yunwu City. The ten warriors ranked in front of him were all the elder warriors who had been practicing martial arts for more than ten years.Those elder warriors who were unable to break through the Black Realm, they would rather practice martial techniques so as to enrich their fighting experience. With such astonished techniques, the younger warriors were not strong enough to be their opponents.Zhang Ruochen told Liu Chuanshen his idea about fighting in the Coliseum.\u201cThe Ninth Prince is going to join the fights in the Yellow Stage Coliseum?\u201d\u201cWith my Ninth Prince\u2019s cultivation at the moment\u2026 I\u2019m afraid it may not be a wise idea! When you reach the completion of the Yellow Realm after three to five years of cultivation, you\u2019ll become a strong warrior of the Yellow Board undoubtedly.\u201d Liu Chuanshen said.Liu Chuanshen didn\u2019t even know what Zhang Ruochen\u2019s level was. He only noticed that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation had reached the Dawn State of the Yellow Realm not long ago in the Year-end Assessment.In his eyes, perhaps he had broken through his current cultivation and reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, he still was not capable of being a warrior of the Yellow Board. It would be fabulous for him to obtain a three winning streak in the Coliseum of the Martial Market.\u201cWhether or not I become a warrior of the Yellow Board, we\u2019ll see after the fights!\u201d Zhang Ruochen exclaimed with confidence.\u201cSince the Ninth Prince is full of confidence, your servant wish you good luck! Well, I need to tour the Coliseum of the Martial Market today. Let\u2019s go together!\u201dLiu Chuanshen stood up and left the bank with Zhang Ruochen.Just before the second when they walked out the front door of the Martial Market Bank, there was a great noise crackling.\u201cI wholeheartedly want to invite you to go sightseeing in Yunwu City. How dare you to refuse my invitation? You\u2019re such a dishonor! Everybody, haul this offensive woman, clean her and send her to my room!\u201d Liu Chengfeng demanded with anger.Liu Chengfeng was extremely pissed off by Shan Xiangling who turned him down. He felt like she had totally embarrassed him in public, and therefore, he decided to use a tough method that Shan Xiangling couldn\u2019t even have a chance to refuse.The two royal guards ran towards Shan Xiangling instantly. People surrounded by the bank got used to the fact that Liu Chengeng would use all kinds of method to get the woman he wanted. Didn\u2019t matter if she was the daughter of a Master.The Red Cloud Sect, however, did not dare to offend the Martial Market Bank.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter having fun with Shan Xiangling, the royal guards might have a chance to spend some time with her too.Shan Xiangling changed her countenance and said, \u201cLiu Chengfeng, you\u2019re also one of the warriors of the Yellow Board and the son of the Martial Market Bank Manager. I can\u2019t believe you have such a shameful morality!\u201dLiu Chengfeng chuckled and said, \u201cWhether my morality is good or bad, you\u2019ll have to discover it tonight! I suggest you not to confront. You clearly know what the consequences are if you offend the Martial Market Bank. Otherwise, you or even the entire Red Cloud Sect will disappear in a night!\u201dShan Xiangling was extremely irritated and bit her lips. Yet, she did not dare to outrage the Martial Market Bank as its capability was too powerful that it could vanish the Red Cloud Sect with just a word.While Liu Chengfeng was laughing joyfully about capturing Shan Xiangling, Zhang Ruochen and Liu Chuanshen walked out from the front door of the Martial Market Bank.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, apologize to Ms. Shan!\u201dLiu Chengfeng heard Liu Chuanshen\u2019s words and turned around immediately. His face changed, completely lacking the haughtiness and arrogance of before.\u201cFa\u2026 Father\u2026 I was just j-joking with Xiangling. I will apologize to her at once\u2026\u201d Liu Chengfeng was so afraid of his father that he stuttered.Seeing him act like this, Liu Chuanshen sighed within his mind. With his disappointment growing, he shook his head, and said, \u201cNinth Prince, I\u2019m sorry that my unfilial son has made a fool of himself. Let\u2019s go to the Martial Market Coliseum now!\u201dWith Liu Chuanshen leading the way, Zhang Ruochen, the Ninth Commandery Princess, and Shan Xiangling arrived at the Martial Market Coliseum shortly.The Martial Market Coliseum was a sea of people. There were powerful warriors everywhere.There were also many warriors with little martial cultivation. They stood in the outer ring of the Coliseum to watch and learn from the more powerful ones.Liu Chuanshen departed for the deepest palace in the Coliseum to handle some important business as soon as he entered to the Martial Market Coliseum.Zhang Ruochen, the Ninth Commandery Princess, and Shan Xiangling entered the Yellow Fighting Palace.The Yellow Fighting Palace was an ancient, six-story amphitheater. Each story had 360 bleachers, and every bleacher provided a clear view of the battle in the center of the Coliseum.Whoever threw ten silver coins could enter the Yellow Fighting Palace.\u201cNinth brother, do you really want to fight? Your current cultivation is not strong enough. There is a huge gap between you and a Warrior of Yellow Board.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said.The Ninth Commandery Princess did not disparage Zhang Ruochen. She was just well aware of the ruthlessness of the Martial Market Coliseum. No weak dared to battle in the Coliseum.Shan Xiangling added, \u201cI heard that warriors must sign a Life and Death Agreement before they enter the Coliseum. Because all Coliseum warriors are crazy. They all want to become famous with one single battle, so they all fight so desperately. One tiny mistake, you may get hurt seriously or even die!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Ninth brother, you\u2019d better decide to fight when you\u2019ve practiced to the Completion of the Yellow Realm! You could ask Father for money if you don\u2019t have enough to buy a weapon refining stove. For your talent, our Father is willing to giving you one million silver coins.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess suggested.Zhang Ruochen answered, \u201cWe shall wait and see!\u201dAt this moment, a warrior in his thirties entered the Coliseum. He carried a red, powerful-looking long spear in his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m the first disciple of Tianhe Suzerain, Nie Heng. It is my first time at the Yellow Fighting Palace. Who shall be my first opponent?\u201dShan Xiangling said, \u201cI have heard of this Nie Heng before. He reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm when he was 22. He has been in the Completion of the Yellow Realm for 15 years, so he must be quite powerful. I think he may win seven or eight rounds in a row.\u201dThere were countless Suzerains and Houses in the Kunlun\u2019s Field. Some small suzerains only had dozens of disciples.Some of the huge suzerains had thousands of millions of disciples and ruled the martial arts world of dozens of commanderies. They were extremely powerful.Thus, the suzerains and the families were divided into three hierarchies and nine levels.For example, the Red Cloud Sect which Shan Xiangling belonged to and the Tianhe Suzerain which Nie Heng belonged to were both the seventh level Suzerains.Yunwu Commandery had one Sixth-class Suzerain, five Seventh-class Suzerains, seventeen Eighth-class Suzerains, and countless Ninth-class Suzerains.Every single Suzerain was governed by official powersIf a Suzerain did not submit, it would be treated like a cult and hunted down.Ninth Commandery Princess said, \u201cNie Heng\u2019s cultivation is indeed strong, but there are more powerful warriors in the Warfare Palace. I predict he will win six rounds repeatedly at best.\u201dShan Xiangling said, \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s make a bet!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling rushed to the highest bleacher of the Yellow Fighting Palace together to place bets.\u201cI bet 1,000 silver coins on Nie Heng winning six rounds in a row.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess took out a Spiritual Crystal and placed it in a cell marked \u201cSix\u201d on the betting table.\u201cI\u2019ll bet 500 silver coins on Nie Heng winning eight rounds in a row.\u201d Shan Xiangling dropped a coin purse in a cell marked \u201cEight\u201d on the betting table.\u201cThen I will bet on the middle number!\u201dZhang Ruochen also became interested and placed a Spiritual Crystal in the cell marked \u201cSeven\u201d.Because so many people had bet, a grand fortune could be acquired by winning every bet.Nie Heng was powerful enough that someone even had bet on him winning ten rounds in a row and becoming a Warrior of Yellow Board. Although it was a rare event, the one bold bet would win a massive sum if he succeeded.The first warrior who challenged Nie Heng looked like he had a cultivation in the Final State of the Yellow Realm in his forties.\u201cBoom!\u201dNie Heng stood in the center of the Coliseum, sending the warrior falling down the Coliseum with only a single movement.\u201cRound one, won!\u201d\u201cRound two, won!\u201d\u2026\u201cRound five, won!\u201d\u201cRound six, won!\u201dThe entire Yellow Fighting Palace cheered for Nie Heng during his sixth consecutive win. The warriors watching from the bleacher shouted and yelled in a frenzied manner.It was an extraordinary event in the Yellow Fighting Palace when a warrior acquired a six-win streak in one day.Nie Heng\u2019s possible opponents in the ongoing battle became more powerful.Only warriors who held a record of a seven-round winning streak in the Yellow Fighting Palace had the qualifications to challenge him upon reaching round seven.How could a weak warrior gain such a record in the Yellow Fighting Palace?Nie Heng had finally met a strong opponent in round seven.Huang Zhenlong, a warrior in the Completion of the Yellow Realm, had a record of three different seven-round winning streaks. Unfortunately, he was defeated in round eight each time. He was quite strong.Nie Heng had fought Huang Zhenlong for an hour before employing \u201cSnowflake Spear\u201d, a martial technique in the mid-class of Human Stage. This technique had punctured Huang Zhenlong\u2019s chest, seriously injuring him as he fell from the Coliseum.But Nie Heng had also suffered some damage from Huang Zhenlong, gaining an internal.There was a trace of blood falling from his mouth.At that moment, a man in his twenties approached to the Coliseum while holding a white folding fan in his hand, saying mildly, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a severe injury. There\u2019s no chance that you can win eight rounds in a row. Just throw in the towel!\u201dThe battle was so cruel that it would not allow competitors any time to rest or heal their wounds, it simply continued.It was as difficult as to climb up to the sky if you wanted to get a ten-rounds winning streak.Although Nie Heng was quite powerful, his Genuine Qi was half empty after seven rounds, not to mention his severe injury.It was almost impossible for him to win round eight in such a condition.Nie Heng gritted his teeth, staring back at the man with the folding fan, and said, \u201cWho says I can\u2019t fight round eight? Who are you?\u201d\u201cHehe! I am Xue Bingsheng, from the Minister\u2019s Mansion! I have a record of two eight-round winning streaks in the Yellow Fighting Palace.\u201d Xue Bingsheng smiled lightly, waving the folding fan in his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201dNie Heng galvanized the rest of his Genuine Qi and poured it into the long spear.The spear coalesced an ardent light instantly, then he thrust it at Xue Bingsheng.\u201cBoom!\u201dIn just the blink of an eye, Xue Bingsheng disappeared.Xue Bingsheng practiced a footwork technique in the Superior class of the Human Stage. In a flash, he reappeared in front of Nie Heng. With a wave of his folding fan, Nie Heng\u2019s head flew away with a spray of blood.Xue Bingsheng glared at the corpse and said, \u201cI had told you to surrender, but you didn\u2019t listen, Fool!\u201dA strong warrior in the Completion of the Yellow Realm just died inside the Coliseum like that!Nie Heng\u2019s junior brother and sister apprentices rushed to the Coliseum, crying all along the entire time they carried his body down.There was nothing that could have been done. Nie Heng had signed the Life and Death Agreement when he first challenged the Coliseum.There were several people who died in the Yellow Fighting Palace every day. No one would be shocked.In fact, the main reason was Xue Bingsheng was too stronger than Nie Heng that Nie Heng did not have a chance to concede before Xue Bingsheng killed him.\u201cAlas! Knowing the huge gap between them, he was still too stubborn to concede. Life is far more important than becoming famous.\u201d The Ninth Commandary Princess said, sighing.Shan Xiangling shook her head slightly, and said, \u201cAccording to Nie Heng\u2019s talent, he could have been a Warrior of the Black Realm after ten years\u2019 of cultivation. A lot of warriors with great talents fall just like that.\u201d\u201cWow! Ninth brother, you\u2019ve won the bet. Go and check your bounty.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess exclaimed.\u201cIt was just a lucky guess!\u201d Zhang Ruochen had just bet casually. He did not think he would win.Although Nie Heng had died in the Coliseum, he gained a seven-round winning streak.Zhang Ruochen had put one Spiritual Crystal on the bet and won eight in return.\u201cIt\u2019s about time! I will try my luck in the Coliseum!\u201dZhang Ruochen signed the Life and Death Agreement and paid a Spiritual Crystal. Then he walked to the Coliseum.\u201cNinth brother, I know I can\u2019t stop you. But you must promise me that you will concede at once if you face someone you can\u2019t defeat.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said with concern.The Ninth Commandery Princess believed that Zhang Ruochen had simply wanted to get into the spirit of the Coliseum, rather than being involved in an actual fight.With a cultivation at the Medium state of the Yellow Realm, his was even less then Nie Heng\u2019s. He could win three consecutive rounds at the most.\u201cRelax! I know my limits!\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled lightly. He walked step by step to the Coliseum, looking quite at ease.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moment he reached the Coliseum, the Yellow Fighting Palace clamored.\u201cWho\u2019s that boy? How dare he to fight in the Yellow Fighting Palace at such a young age?\u201d\u201cMaybe he wants to become famous! Dozens of reckless boys die here every month! Big deal!\u201d\u2026At this moment, Liu Chengfeng stood at a higher bleacher of the Yellow Fighting Palace, staring down at Zhang Ruochen. He showed a ferocious smile and said, \u201cHaha! You choose a path to hell instead of the path of heaven. If you die in the Coliseum, even the Yunwu Commandery Prince could say nothing about it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed nearly 20 years old and was at the Medium State of the Yellow Realm.He could be considered as a genius of martial arts since he had practiced to the Medium State at such an early age.The young warrior in yellow held a broadsword, and said in a loud voice, \u201cHao Shiqi from the Hao\u2019s, I am the first to challenge you. Please draw your sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen gripped the hilt of the Flash Shinning Sword with his right hand, shook his head, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need my sword to defeat you. If I draw it out, you may get hurt.\u201d\u201cArrogant!\u201dThe young warrior in yellow poured his Genuine Qi into the broadsword to activate two Inscriptions of Power within it. The weight of the broadsword increased to 143.5 kg.He held the broadsword with both hands, brandishing it, and rushed toward Zhang Ruochen.With his momentum, even a warrior at the Final State of the Yellow Realm would not dare to confront him directly.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen was completely still. With a wave of his arm, the scabbard cleaved at the young warrior\u2019s neck.\u201cDing!\u201dThe broadsword clattered to the ground.The young warrior in yellow screamed, and fell from the Coliseum, out of his bearings.He covered his neck, returning to the Coliseum to pick his broadsword up. He glanced at Zhang Ruochen respectfully, and said, \u201cThank you for not killing me.\u201dHe was quite lucky that Zhang Ruochen had hit him with the scabbard, or his head would not be on his neck anymore.Round two, won!Round three, won!Round four, won!Zhang Ruochen won three consecutive matches.He stood in the center of the Coliseum as steady as rock, never moving his feet at all.Whoever challenged him was struck down from the Coliseum with the same movement, no matter what cultivation they had reached.\u201cHow could the boy be so powerful? Even Luo Tian, whose cultivation is at the Final State of the Yellow Realm, was defenseless against that scabbard strike.\u201d A 16-year-old noble girl stared at Zhang Ruochen curiously.Zhang Ruochen was too young and had such great strength. Warriors at the Final State of the Yellow Realm were unable to force him backward a step, let alone make him draw his sword.\u201cHe must have practiced the Sword Comprehension to the realm of \u2018Sword Following the Mind\u2019. Unless the challenger can deal with his Sword Comprehension, will be struck down from the Coliseum by him with only one move.\u201dXue Bingsheng brandished the fan in his hand, smiled and said, \u201cHaha! Don\u2019t you know who he is?\u201d\u201cDo you know?\u201d Many people asked.Xue Bingsheng said, \u201cHe is the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery. He could beat the geniuses at the Final State with the cultivation of the Beginning State in the Year-end Assessment. According to his practice speed, he must have reached the Medium State by now. Unless warriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm challenge him, nobody can beat him.\u201d\u201cHaha! So it\u2019s the Ninth Prince, the famous genius of martial arts. Let me challenge him.\u201dA bald man kicked off of the grandstand while holding two hammers and covered a distance of 10 meters before falling on the Coliseum.\u201cThe Ninth Prince, I Guo Sihai, will fight you for round five. You should be careful. My hammers weigh 400 kg. Even a man made of iron will be crushed if he gets hit,\u201d said Guo Sihai.Warriors who could gain five repeated victories in the Yellow Fighting Palace were almost all at the Completion of the Yellow Realm. Only a few geniuses were at the Final State of the Yellow Realm.Guo Sihai was a warrior at the Completion of the Yellow Realm. He was 1.85m whose arms were wider than Zhang Ruochen\u2019s thighs and his body was full of palm-sized muscles.\u201cGuo Sihai was born with amazing power. He can burst out with the power of 30 bulls in the Completion of the Yellow Realm. Maybe the Ninth Prince will lose!\u201dHearing the discussion of the crowd, the Ninth Commandery Princess started to worry. After all, it was a warrior at the Completion.A warrior in the Completion and a warrior at the Final State were not at the same level at all.\u201cOw!\u201dGuo Sihai roared, and his bones popped. He swung the two hammers with his arms like a windmill, emitting gusts.\u201cWild Hammer!\u201dGuo Sihai struck out with all his power, using a martial technique of the inferior class in the Human Stage. He swung the two hammers at Zhang Ruochen concurrently.A hammer aimed at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head, and the other at his legs.Under such wild attack, Zhang Ruochen would have needed to step back even if his cultivation was stronger.Once Zhang Ruochen stepped back, he would continue to pressure Zhang Ruochen with his following movements and beat Zhang Ruochen with a thunderbolt-like momentum.\u201cBang!\u201dZhang Ruochen just cleaved with his scabbard just as before, slamming into one hammer.The hammer changed direction immediately, crashing into Guo Sihai\u2019s chest.\u201cBoom!\u201dGuo Sihai fell down from the Coliseum with his two hammers.\u201cHow\u2026 how can that be?\u201dGuo Sihai covered his bloody chest and climbed up from the ground with great difficulty. He stared at Zhang Ruochen, who was standing straight in the center of the Coliseum. He did not see how Zhang Ruochen waved his scabbard at all.All he knew was that he was struck down from the Coliseum by his own hammer.\u201cEven Guo Sihai couldn\u2019t force him to draw his sword! How could he be that powerful?\u201dXue Bingsheng seemed a bit more serious, and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince\u2019s Sword Comprehension is at least at the Intermediate Stage of the realm of \u2018Sword Following the Mind\u2019, maybe it is already in the Advanced Stage.\u201d\u201cImpossible! Even for warriors of the Black Realm, only a few can train to the Advanced Stage of \u2018Sword Following the Mind\u2019 Realm.\u201dXue Bingsheng smiled a little and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see! It\u2019s only round five now. The following warriors will be more powerful as it continues. Eventually, someone will find his weakness. If he lasts to round eight, I will go to the Coliseum to beat him myself.\u201dAt this moment, the Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling were very shocked as well. They didn\u2019t expect that Zhang Ruochen was that strong.\u201cHe beat a warrior at the Completion of the Yellow Realm with just one move! Could my ninth brother\u2019s cultivation have broken through to the Final State of the Yellow Realm?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said.\u201cIt must be the Final State of the Yellow Realm!\u201d\u201cHow long ago was the Year-end Assessment? The Ninth Prince\u2019s cultivation has progressed two levels since then. That is incredible.\u201d Shan Xiangling said.She would not be able to believe that there was such an incredible man in the world if she had not witnessed it.Another warrior at the Completion of the Yellow Realm went up to the Coliseum. It was a woman in her twenties in an indigo robe. She also used a sword.The woman in the indigo robe stood across from Zhang Ruochen, watching his every movement carefully, searching for a flaw.\u201cThere are no flaws at all! I have to force him to reveal one.\u201d\u201cCrash!\u201dThe woman in indigo robe moved fast as a lighting with special footwork. She attacked Zhang Ruochen\u2019s legs with a fish intestine rapier.Even if she was unable to defeat Zhang Ruochen, it would count as an achievement if she could force him to move.Once he moved, he would show flaws; beating him became much easier.Zhang Ruochen finally seemed serious. The indigo robed woman\u2019s sword technique was quite sharp. It had reached the realm of \u201cSword Following the Mind\u201d. Although she was just at the Initial Stage, she was much more powerful than the other warriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm.Zhang Ruochen closed his eyes, only using his ears to catch the sound of the sword breaking air.\u201cDing!\u201dHe waved the scabbard, aiming at the space between them. He parried woman\u2019s attack down to his legs.The woman was a little stunned, but she changed her movements quickly. She used three sword techniques in a row, yet each one was accurately blocked by Zhang Ruochen.There was a \u201cDong\u201d when she was about to start the fourth movement. She felt a sharp pain in her chest and a rib of her seemed broken.Zhang Ruochen pointed the scabbard at the female\u2019s chest and said mildly, \u201cYou lose!\u201dThe scabbard had once again saved a life. If it were the point, her heart would have been punctured.The woman sheathed her fish intestines rapier, made an obeisance to Zhang Ruochen by cupping one hand in the other before her chest, and said, \u201cNo wonder the Ninth Prince is the Genius of Martial Arts. I admit your superiority!\u201dAnother warrior at the Completion of the Yellow Realm had lost without forcing the Ninth Prince to retreat.\u201cHum! Damn it! He is only 16, but his martial cultivation was that high. I can\u2019t let him live, absolutely not.\u201dLiu Chengfeng was very angry. He said to a royal guard standing behind him, \u201cGo get Han Fu. Tell him it\u2019s the time.\u201d\u201cCopy that!\u201d The royal guard rushed off at once.Liu Chengfeng stared at Shan Xiangling, who was standing at the bleacher below. A filthy smile appeared as he said, \u201cShan Xiangling, I\u2019ll see who can save you when Zhang Ruochen dies in the Coliseum. Haha!\u201dDue to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s incredible performance, the entire Yellow Fighting Palace cheered upwards loudly.Finally, Zhang Ruochen met his seventh challenger.Hong Tao, whose cultivation was at the Completion of the Yellow Realm, had developed an Ice of Profound Sacred Mark. He gained a record of seven consecutive victories four times in the Yellow Fighting Palace.In addition, he also had reached the Initial Stage of the Following the Mind Realm.But he used a whip instead of a sword. Whip Followed the Mind.\u201cI, Hong Tao, greets the Ninth Prince. I hope the Ninth Prince will forgive me if I offend Your Excellency later.\u201d Hong Tao seemed refined and courteous. There was always a smile on his face, but his eyes were sharp.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHong Tao touched his wrist gently and uncoiled a long golden whip.The golden whip was 13 meters long, only the width of a little finger wide. It seemed like a Genuine Martial Arm made of some savage beast.Normal people couldn\u2019t even swing the long whip properly.\u201cBang!\u201dHong Tao shook his arm, making the golden long whip flail immediately. It coiled around his body like a flexible spiritual snake, radiating golden lights.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Stepping out, he turned into an afterimage shuttling back and forth among the golden long whip.Zhang Ruochen dashed through the distance in only a second and appeared in front of Hong Tao.Hong Tao\u2019s face changed color. He immediately tried to pull his long whip back and attack Zhang Ruochen again.\u201cBang!\u201dZhang Ruochen smashed Hong Tao on the neck with the scabbard in his hand.Hong Tao stumbled and fell off the Coliseum.Hong Tao somersaulted at the moment he fell off. So unlike the six warriors before him who fell off with a great discomfiture, he landed on the ground stably with both feet.Standing under the stage, Hong Tao stared at Zhang Ruochen deeply and said, \u201cI lost.\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s movement just now was too fast. He was doomed to lose even if they fight again.Another movement!\u201cWith Hong Tao\u2019s cultivation, he couldn\u2019t even block Zhang Ruochen\u2019s one movement! How terrifying!\u201dXue Bingsheng waved his folding fan slightly and smiled evilly. \u201cQuite interesting!\u201d\u201cLet me stop your winning streak in Round Eight.\u201d Xue Bingsheng turned into a white shadow and leaped onto the Coliseum lightly as a leaf.\u201cXue Bingsheng!\u201d shouted Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen had seen the battle between Xue Bingsheng and Nie Heng previously. At that time, Xue Bingsheng killed Nie Heng with only one movement.He was very fast, and indeed a strong opponent.Xue Bingsheng gave a wee smile and said, \u201cAmong the geniuses I\u2019ve seen in my life, you are the most talented other than the Seventh Prince. \u201cOnly two months have passed since the Year-end Assessment, but you have broken two stages and reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm. I admire you. I do.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cAre you from the Minister\u2019s Mansion?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d said Xue Bingsheng.\u201cAre you confident in defeating me?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.Xue Bingsheng laughed and said, \u201cYour biggest advantage is the Advanced Stage of Sword Following the Mind and your biggest disadvantage is the lack of Genuine Qi. I assume that you have just broken through the Final State, right?\u201dZhang Ruochen did not respond.Xue Bingsheng continued. \u201cYou are fast, but I\u2019m not slow. You can defeat others with your speed, but it won\u2019t work on me. And in terms of power, I\u2019m afraid I still outweigh you with my cultivation at the Completion of the Yellow Realm.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Xue Bingsheng nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to take your sword out!\u201d\u201cI will take my sword out if I think you are powerful enough,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.\u201cYou should be careful then! My Iron Bone Fan is a Third-class Genuine Martial Arm. There were altogether nine warriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm died because of it.\u201dXue Bingsheng closed his eyes, and the folding fan suddenly spread. There was a three-inch sharp blade came out of each leaf.\u201cSwish!\u201dXue Bingsheng was extremely fast. He dashed in front of Zhang Ruochen in just a second, like a white ghost.He had been practicing a movement at the Superior Class of the Human Stage, namely \u201cEight Steps in the Air\u201d. Each step he made was ten feet long.He made eight steps, and eight afterimages appeared on the stage.It looked like eight Xue Bingsheng were attacking Zhang Ruochen at the same time.Zhang Ruochen stayed still, like a divine tree which rooted there, and kept wielding the sword scabbard in his hand.Every time their weapons collided, there was a sharp noise, and sparks flew off in all directions.\u201cBang Bang!\u201dJust in a second, Zhang Ruochen and Xue Bingsheng had fought over 20 movements. It looked like a shadow fighting on the Coliseum. Warriors of the lower cultivation could not even figure out how they made their moves, only shadows of shadows were seen.Standing on the highest bleacher, Liu Chengfeng stared at the Coliseum and sneered. He said, \u201cEven Xue Bingsheng went to a duel with him. It\u2019s really hard to predict the result!\u201d\u201cGood day, Master Liu!\u201d Han Fu knelt to Liu Chengfeng with the utmost respect.Han Fu was very tall, about 260 or 270 cm. His one fist was much bigger than an ordinary person\u2019s head. There were leopard spots all over him.He was not a purebred human, rather, he came from Leopard-Human clan and had the blood of the savage beast, Fire Lion-leopard.In Kunlun\u2019s Field, there were many half-humans developing into an independent clan. For example, the strong Dragon-Human clan, Elephant-Human clan, and Ape-Human clan; the beautiful Fox-Human clan and Fish-Human clan.The status of these half-human clans, however, was very low. Many of them were enslaved.Han Fu was a half-human slave and since he had a record of a nine-game winning streak in the Yellow level Colosseum, Liu Chengfeng bought him with a high price.Liu Chengfeng said, \u201cStand up. Did you see the boy on the Coliseum?\u201dHan Fu stood up and stared at Zhang Ruochen. Then he said, \u201cHe is powerful!\u201dLiu Chengfeng said, \u201cOf course he is. So, if Xue Bingsheng loses to him, you should go and kill him in the next round.\u201d\u201cI will never let you down. I will kill him even if it means perishing together.\u201d said Han Fu with determination.Liu Chengfeng nodded and said, \u201cXue Bingsheng has tested his real power. Take a look at them. It will help you to the next round.\u201dHan Fu nodded.\u201cXue Bingsheng is so powerful! I\u2019m really worried about my brother!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess was very concerned.Surely, Xue Bingsheng didn\u2019t dare to kill Zhang Ruochen, but who could make sure no accident would happen?Xue Bingsheng was nothing like other warriors in the Completion. He was a really powerful warrior who suppressed Zhang Ruochen in every field. It was almost impossible for Zhang Ruochen to win.All of the warriors in the Yellow Fighting Palace was very nervous now. They all wanted to know whether Zhang Ruochen could defeat Xue Bingsheng or not.Could he achieve an eight-game winning streak?\u201cThis is it!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s look turned sharp. He stabbed with his sword scabbard and cried, \u201cSacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dThe speed was three times faster than before, making an unusual scene. The Sword Breath turned into the white flash, piercing through the void space and coming directly for Xue Bingsheng\u2019s glabella.Xue Bingsheng changed color and stepped back immediately.But it was too late!\u201cBoom!\u201dThe tip of the sword scabbard dashed onto Xue Bingsheng\u2019s glabella directly.Xue Bingsheng felt dizzy and fell on the ground. He fainted.It was lucky for him that it was just the scabbard. If it were the sword point, his glabella would have been transpierced.An old servant from the Minister\u2019s Mansion quickly rushed towards the Coliseum and bowed to Zhang Ruochen. He said, \u201cThank you for mercy!\u201dAfter saying that, he carried the fainted Xue Bingsheng off the Coliseum and quickly left the Yellow Fighting Palace.An eight-game winning streak!The whole Yellow Fighting Palace was seething! It was very extraordinary for a young man at the age of 16 to achieve an eight-game winning streak.Even Liu Chengfeng, the Warrior of Yellow Board, was not so powerful when he was 16.\u201cMy ninth brother is so powerful! If our father-king knows that, he will again fete the officials to share his happiness.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess let out a long sigh of relief. Her hanging heart finally went back to where it should be.She found that, however, Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t walk off the stage. Did he want a Round Nine?In this moment, the stalwart Han Fu came onto the Coliseum step by step.Completely covered in metal armor, he held a 600 kg battleax in his hand. His metal armor was not simply overlapped onto the body but inlaid in his flesh and bones. It became one with his body.\u201cNo! It\u2019s Han Fu! No!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess turned pale and shouted to Zhang Ruochen. \u201cMy ninth brother, please give in! Han Fu is a martial-addict! No one can survive him!\u201dShan Xiangling\u2019s color also changed. She said, \u201cHan Fu is Liu Chengfeng\u2019s slave. He will definitely kill you on the Coliseum. The ninth prince, please give in. There is absolutely no need to put up a desperate fight with a bloodthirsty lunatic.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHan Fu gave a loud laugh. \u201cDid you hear them, boy? The two women over there ask you to give in. If you don\u2019t, my battleax will cut you into two pieces.\u201dZhang Ruochen looked up to the highest bleacher and happened to see Liu Chengfeng up there.Liu Chengfeng was also staring at Zhang Ruochen. He sneered and said in a clear voice, \u201cIf you fear death, you should better give up. Once you die on the Coliseum, I might find it hard to explain to the Commandery Prince.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cReally? But we need to fight to find out who will die and who will live!\u201d\u201cYou just don\u2019t stop, do you? Very well. Han Fu, show him your real power. Don\u2019t let him look down on you!\u201d said Liu Chengfeng in a somber tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His Genuine Qi revolved in the 15 Meridians, and a gush of strong power burst out from his body.\u201cBoom!\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201d\u2026Holding his battleax, he strode towards Zhang Ruochen. The Coliseum shook slightly with every step he made.\u201cBoom!\u201dHe slanted out the axe towards Zhang Ruochen.The slanting seemed like coming from sheer animal strength. In fact, it was rather tricky which blocked all of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s leeway, leaving him nowhere to hide.It was the realm of Following the Mind!The axe followed the mind.Zhang Ruochen stayed calm, taking it steadily and unoppressively. He lifted his arm and blocked transversely with his sword scabbard, colliding with the battleax.\u201cBang!\u201dA massive deafening sound burst out!The sword and the axe fixed up in mid-air at the same time.Holding the sword in one hand, Zhang Ruochen blocked the axe easily.Seeing this, all of the warriors\u2019 astonishment reached its height. No one ever imagined that Zhang Ruochen\u2019s power was so terrifying.\u201cHan Fu was born with amazing power. He can burst out the strength of 32 bulls without using martial techniques. Is the Ninth Prince even more powerful than him?\u201dStanding on the grandstand, Hong Tao shook his head slightly and said, \u201cIt turns out that the Ninth Prince hasn\u2019t gone all-out. His cultivation is indeed fathomless. I don\u2019t know whether Han Fu can feel the real strength of his cultivation?\u201dIt was indeed heart-shaking. At first, people believed that the reason why the Ninth Prince could defeat those warriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm was that, he was in a high Sword Comprehension realm.No one could have expected that his power was so terrible.He could act as a counterweight with his power alone.\u201cBoy, your power is strong enough. Now, take this!\u201d\u201cMix-world Slay!\u201dHan Fu bounced over 60 meters high and gave free play to a martial technique in the mid-class of the Human Stage. He held the axe with both hands and struck it down again.The martial technique in the mid-class of Human Stage and the 600-kilogram weight of the battleax could burst out the terrifying power of 45 bulls.\u201cSacred Bell Sword!\u201d\u201cCrash!\u201dThe Flash Shinning Sword was finally freed from the scabbard.Zhang Ruochen shifted all of his Genuine Qi into the Flash Shinning Sword and activated all the four Inscriptions of Power Series in the sword.The Flash Shinning Sword weighted 227 kilograms.The dancing Sword Breath turned into an illusory Bell Sword and covered Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body in the center.\u201cBang!\u201dChopping on the Bell Sword, Han Fu failed to cut it open. On the contrary, he was tossed out by a great counterforce.Han Fu felt a great quake at the five internal organs, and the Spiritual Blood tossed over his body. He had an internal injury.Zhang Ruochen could burst into the strength of 36 bulls without using any martial technique. With the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, he could burst into the strength of 49 bulls.The Sacred Sword Skill was not a martial technique to increase the power, but a technique that focused on the delicacy of the sword technique and the sharpness of the Sword Breath.The Sacred Sword Skill, however, was a sword technique of the low-class of Spiritual. Zhang Ruochen still burst out the strength of 49 bulls by putting the defensive technique of the Sacred Bell Sword. In addition, the counterforce of the Sacred Bell Sword was also very powerful. Thus it was impossible for Han Fu to stay safe and sound.\u201cAgain!\u201dHan Fu\u2019s eyes turned blood red. He activated his Fire Lion-leopard blood and traces of fire came out of his pores.\u201cHan Fu is going wild!\u201d\u201cWith the power of the Fire Lion-leopard blood, he is able to burst into the terrifying strength of 49 bulls.\u201dLast time when Han Fu went wild, he tore a warrior apart at the Completion of the Yellow Realm to shreds with his battleax.The fact was, an ordinary warrior at the Completion of the Yellow Realm could only burst out the strength of 25 bulls. Anyone who could burst out the strength of 36 bulls would be regarded as outstanding.Even some warriors of the Yellow Board could not burst into such terrifying strength as 49 bulls.Han Fu could have been a warrior of the Yellow Board as well. He, however, met a warrior of the Yellow Board with a higher ranking in Round 10. Thus he failed to achieve ten-game winning streaks.If he met a weaker warrior of the Yellow Board in Round 10, he could have been a warrior of the Yellow Board now.In other words, Han Fu was no weaker than any other warriors of the Yellow Board.\u201cWell, well! Zhang Ruochen, you can even drive Han Fu wild! It seems that your power is quite strong!\u201d With ridicule, Liu Chengfeng looked at Zhang Ruochen who kept falling back on the Coliseum.He would have been defeated by the wild Han Fu, not to mention Zhang Ruochen.When a man lost to Han Fu, it was not failure that awaited him, but death.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen could clearly feel a wave of warmth blowing on his face before the axe was chopped down. He decided not to confront the tough with toughness. Instead, he chose to step back.Even if they faced each other directly, Zhang Ruochen was also as powerful as Han Fu.However, Han Fu was not the only person Zhang Ruochen needed to defeat. He had to prepare for Round ten with the warrior of the Yellow Board. So it would be unwise to waste too much Genuine Qi and physical strength.Han Fu kept chopping down the axe while Zhang Ruochen kept stepping back. Every chop-and-hide was so close that people could not imagine the consequence if Zhang Ruochen was one step slower.The Ninth Commandery Princess was very worried. It was too dangerous! She really hoped that her dear ninth brother just gave in, for there was no chance of winning when the opponent was Han Fu.At the very beginning, Han Fu indeed suppressed Zhang Ruochen with his great momentum.Han Fu\u2019s power, however, gradually grew weaker. The speed of his axe-waving started to slow down, and the fire on his body had also gotten thinner.\u201cHan Fu has wasted too much of his Genuine Qi. He might lose! The Ninth Prince is indeed a genius with an outstanding talent!\u201d said Liu Chuanshen.After hearing the news that Zhang Ruochen made an eight-game winning streak, Liu Chuanshen came to the Coliseum immediately, wondering how powerful this Ninth Prince would be.Standing beside Liu Chuanshen, a stern look scribe said in a hoarse voice, \u201cIf the Ninth Prince can fully develop his martial arts techniques, maybe he\u2019ll be able to compete with the Seventh Prince.\u201d\u201cEn?\u201dLiu Chuanshen looked at the stern look scribe and asked, \u201cWhat does your means, sir?\u201dThe stern look scribe said, \u201cIf the Seventh Prince is the only unconquerable warrior in the Yunwu Commandery, ten years later, I\u2019m afraid the Martial Market Bank, the black market, and the Federation of Inscription will all be monopolized by the official power as there\u2019s nobody who is capable to confront the Seventh Prince after ten years.\u201d\u201cBut, if there is someone who can pin down the Seventh Prince in the Royal Family, the situation will be very different.\u201dHearing this, Liu Chuanshen nodded slightly as if absorbed in thought. He said, \u201cWell, it seems that we can help him when necessary. It\u2019s the best situation if they can both be defeated and wounded.\u201d\u201cThe Ninth Prince is still too weak compared to the strikingly talented Seventh Prince. We can just place a hand on him for support. But it still depends on his own potential whether he can come to maturity or not.\u201dThe stern look scribe smiled slightly and said, \u201cHan Fu must fall within three movements.\u201dBefore the stern look scribe\u2019s voice had died away, Han Fu was struck down the Coliseum by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s one palm.Round nine, won!Zhang Ruochen won again. Now it came to the last round.If he could win the last round, he could leave his name on the Yellow Board and became the 28th warrior of the Yellow Board in the Yunwu Commandery.Of course, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s opponent in the last round was also a warrior of the Yellow Board.\u201cThe Ninth Prince is so strong! He is only 16 years old and now he is going to be a warrior of the Yellow Board?\u201d\u201cI heard that when the Seventh Prince became the warrior of the Yellow Board, the Commandery Prince Yunwu proclaimed a general amnesty.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s guess, which warrior of the Yellow Board will break his winning streak record?\u201d\u2026The whole Yellow level Colosseum was seething again. Even the audience in the Profound Stage came here specially to witness the birth of a new warrior of the Yellow Board.The very moment of charging the Yellow Board was so rare that happened less than half a month.\u201cMy ninth brother, you must succeed!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess did not realize that Zhang Ruochen was so powerful that he could even defeat Han Fu. Now, she had a lot more confident in Zhang Ruochen.Shan Xiangling\u2019s beautiful eyes blinked. She stared at Zhang Ruochen closely and thought,\u00a0\u201cBoth being the cultivation of the Final State of the Yellow Realm, he is much stronger than me. He\u2019ll probably be a warrior of the Yellow Board.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCrap! Looks like I have to handle him on my own.\u201dLiu Chengfeng walked down from the grandstand and stepped up the Coliseum. He stared at Zhang Ruochen sharply and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince, you have fought nine rounds. How much Genuine Qi have you left?\u201d\u201cMore than enough to defeat you,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Liu Chengfeng grinned and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince, you are indeed a genius. If you can practice to the Completion of the Yellow Realm, I\u2019ll probably lose. But with your present cultivation, you are doomed to fail!\u201dLiu Chengfeng, ranking 11th on the Yellow Board, was classified as one of the strong warriors among the warriors of the Yellow Board.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0TransnZhang Ruochen was not interested in talking to Liu Chengfeng any longer. He held the Flash Shinning Sword and said, \u201cAfter the battle, you will know weather I am good or not.\u201dAfter watching the first nine battles, Chengfeng actually did not look down upon Ruochen. Instead, he considered Ruochen as an enemy at the same level as him.Chengfeng owned a Level Five Icing Cold Sacred Mark and inside his body, there was Icing Cold Genuine Qi. No doubt that his innate gifts were superior to many other warriors.So Chengfeng was a Completion warrior at the Yellow Realm. There was almost nobody who could compete against him among his peers. Had he practiced harder, he would have reached the Black Realm.\u201cMeteor Sword Technique!\u201dThe Genuine Qi in Chengfeng was very strong. He injected his Genuine Qi into the sword. All of sudden, the sword in his hand glowed.Five Inscriptions of Light Series inside the sword were activated by him, so some sharp Light Sword Aura were released.The whole colosseum was surrounded by the running Sword Aura.\u201cYour sword is a Level Five Genuine Martial Arm?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.\u201cYour eyesight is not that bad.\u201dA hint of a cold smile played on Liu Chengfeng\u2019s face as he said, \u201cSpark Fire Flies!\u201dBoth he and the sword flew towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart. The speed was so fast that they looked like a meteor flying over the Colosseum.It was a sword technique at the Superior Class of Human Stage, the Meteor Sword Technique.Ruochen dared not underestimate Chengfeng. He aggregated his Genuine Qi and transferred them to his eyes through Eye Vessel.Within a second, his eyesight doubled in power.Ruochen looked at Chengfeng. He could see that Chengfeng was rather slow when using the sword. However, it was not because Chengfeng was becoming slower. Rather, it was Ruochen\u2019s observation that had improved.Eye Vessel was one of his 27 meridians.It was quite difficult for other warriors to open up their Eye Vessels.\u201cDing!\u201dRuochen swayed the sword towards Chengfeng. His sword slid along Chengfeng\u2019s blade and left a light bloody cut on Chengfeng\u2019s neck.A drop of blood fell from the edge of Ruochen\u2019s sword.\u201cHow can he be faster than me?\u201dLiu Chengfeng touched the cut on his neck, his gaze cold gaze. He shouted, \u201cAgain! Meteor Sword Three Flickers!\u201dThree beams of Sword Aura were released by Chengfeng at the same time.His Sword Aura was with Icing Cold Air, made frosts in the air.\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dRuochen thrusted his sword forward as well, broken Chengfeng\u2019s Three Sword Aura once.The Sword Aura did not vanish, but flew back to Chengfeng instead.Chengfeng dared not to fight against the Sacred Sword Skill directly. He turned himself into a shadow and moved to his right. He then jumped 10 meters high and used his Meteor Sword Three Flickers technique again. Three sharp Sword Aura was smashed onto Ruochen\u2019s head.Liu Chengfeng was placed 11th on the Yellow Board. Obviously, he was a strong warrior. He was even considered as the strongest at the Yellow Realm. Even if he battled with those who had just reached the Black Realm, he would not lose the fight immediately.In other words, with Chengfeng\u2019s combat powers, even if he met Initial Stage warriors who had reached the Black Realm, he could survive. However, if other Completion warriors at the Yellow Realm met Black Realm warriors, they would lose the fight or even their lives.When it came to the Realm of Sword Knowledge, Zhang Ruochen was more proficient than Liu Chengfeng. However, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi was weaker than Chengfeng\u2019s. Besides that, his Martial Arts Realm was lower as well.\u201cHis Genuine Qi capacity is 10 times larger than mine. If I have a long battle with him, I will definitely be at a disadvantage. I need to win against him as soon as possible,\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen thought.Although Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi capacity was smaller than Chengfeng\u2019s, he had opened up 27 meridians while Chengfeng had open up 19 only.His explosive force was stronger!\u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201dRuochen roared with the moves from the Sacred Sword Skill. He thrust his sword with the Sacred Sword Skill technique\u2014Sacred Breaking Plum Sword.\u201cHey! Are you using a Low-Class of Spiritual sword technique again? I see. You want to quickly finish the match, don\u2019t you? But too bad, I won\u2019t let it happen!\u201dChengfeng noticed Ruochen\u2019s intention. However, he had no plans to fight recklessly. Instead, he moved back to keep a distance away from Ruochen.Chengfeng knew his advantages as well as Zhang Ruochen\u2019s disadvantages. He planned to exhaust Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi.Liu Chuanshen nodded and said, \u201cChengfeng finally knows how to use battle tactics. If he can keep using this strategy, he will win.\u201dThe stern-looking scribe said, \u201cChengfeng has a talent for martial arts. If he can practice it more, he may achieve more than you, my lord.\u201d15 minutes later, Zhang Ruochen started to sweat. Beads of cold sweat could be seen on his forehead and the back of his hands. He was exhausted.\u201cGenuine Qi running out?\u201d Liu Chengfeng smirked.All of a sudden, Ruochen made a lethal move with his sword techniques. It seemed that he could not continue any longer.The time has come.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dLiu Chengfeng took the opportunity and initiated an attack ahead of Zhang Ruochen. He thrust the sword towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart.He wanted to not only beat Zhang Ruochen, but to kill him.When Chengfeng was about to make his move, a hint of a smile played in Ruochen\u2019s eyes. It seemed that Ruochen was laughing. \u201cGot you!\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen squatted partially and slid forward. His sword was thrust towards Chengfeng\u2019s abdomen.How could Chengfeng expect that Ruochen could still change techniques with his low Genuine Qi?Chengfeng twisted his arm hastily to crosscut his sword downward.\u201cBoom!\u201dTwo swords met. A huge vibrative power transferred back to their arms simultaneously.The words flew out of their hands at the same time and fell outside the Colosseum.The next second, Zhang Ruochen utilized his residual Genuine Qi to run inside his 27 meridians. He unleashed all the power through his palm.\u201cGalloping Elephant!\u201dIt was released with the strength of a herd of bulls!\u201cPhew!\u201dLiu Chengfeng threw up blood because of his wounded abdomen. He flew backward more than 10 meters before falling. He was severely injured and fainted the moment he touched the ground.Liu Chuanshen shook his head and told the servant next to him. He said, \u201cGosh! He is too impulsive! Take him back and nurse him!\u201dAfter this, Liu Chuanshen turned back and walked out of the Yellow-Level Colosseum.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe palace was filled with loud applause.Another Warrior at the Yellow Board was born!After that, a deacon of the Warfare Palace handed a black iron plate as well as one hundred Spiritual Crystals to Zhang Ruochen as an award.\u201cCongratulations, Your Highness! You\u2019re the 28th Warrior of the Yellow Board in our Yunwu Commandery. Now you\u2019re the 11th on this Yellow Board,\u201d said the deacon.The Yellow-Level Colosseum made a comprehensive assessment on Zhang Ruochen based on his behavior today and finally awarded him this rank.That deacon put a black iron plate into Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThis is a Yellow Board Iron Token. It represents the recognition by the Martial Market Bank, which also symbolizes your identity as a Warrior of the Yellow Board.\u201dZhang Ruochen took the token with words etched on it:\u00a0Yunwu Commandery, the 11th of the Yellow Board, Zhang Ruochen.That deacon also gave those one hundred Spiritual Crystals to Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cBecause of your 10 winning streaks in the Yellow-Level Colosseum, you\u2019re awarded one hundred Spiritual Crystals. They\u2019re worth ten thousand silver coins in total.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, if your cultivation is further improved, you can come here to battle again. If you can have another 10 winning streaks, you will be awarded a million silver coins.\u201dThat deacon continued. \u201cHowever, if you come here again, the warriors you battle will be warriors of the Yellow Board alone. In other words, only by winning 10 warriors can you win a million silver coins.\u201d\u201cIn Yunwu Commandery\u2019s history, there has been anyone who can defeat ten Warriors of the Yellow Board. Even the genius Seventh Prince only won nine at that time. That\u2019s the best record in our commandery.\u201dZhang Ruochen put them away and said, \u201cI\u2019ll come again!\u201dAfter saying this, Ruochen stepped out of the Colosseum and walked towards the Ninth Commandery Princess and Shan Xiangling.The Ninth Commandery Princess, Yuxi, was quite excited. She was like a fragrant breeze and threw herself into Ruochen\u2019s arms. She stretched out her soft, white arms and hugged Ruochen\u2019s neck. She kissed his cheek with her two gorgeous eyes shining. She said excitedly, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re amazing! You\u2019re now a Warrior of the Yellow Board. You just defeated Han Fu and Liu Chengfeng. I have asked my people to bring this news back to the palace. Our father and Concubine Lin will be thrilled as well.\u201dYuxi was 16, after all. She had a nice figure. Right now her big, soft breasts were pressed onto Ruochen\u2019s chest, moving constantly. This embarrassed Ruochen a lot, so he had to turn his eyes away.Yuxi freed Ruochen and said, \u201cBrother, as a Warrior of the Yellow Board, you can go to the Savage God\u2019s Pool again to cultivate. I\u2019m so envious!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cI can go there for the second time?\u201d\u201cOf course! Only a Warrior of the Yellow Board can do that!\u201d replied Yuxi.\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll buy a Weapon Refining Stove first, then I\u2019ll head for the Savage God\u2019s Pool immediately.\u201dRuochen was pretty happy now. He thought,\u00a0\u201cIf I can practice there again, I will be able to absorb more Power of Blood for sure.\u201dBy then, my physique will improve a lot, which can give me a chance to open up 36 meridians when trying to reach the Completion level. If so, I will be stronger than I was in my previous life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He sent these coins to Qingxuan Pavilion.Qingxuan Pavilion then sent someone to take the Weapon Refining Stove, a Level Seven Genuine Martial Arm, to the Imperial Palace.An old eunuch welcomed Zhang Ruochen and Yuxi the moment they arrived at the Imperial Palace, he groveled and said in his sharp voice, \u201cIt\u2019s my honor to meet you, Your Highnesses. His Majesty and Concubine Lin are waiting for you at Sunglow Palace. You may want to go now!\u201dWithout a doubt, their father and Concubine Lin were waiting for him after hearing about him becoming a Warrior of the Yellow Board.Zhang Ruochen ordered the royal guards to send his Weapon Refining Stove back to his place. Afterwards, he immediately rushed to Sunglow Palace with Yuxi.When they entered Sunglow Palace, they heard Yunwu Commandery Prince laughing. \u201cMy son, it has only been a month since the year-end assessment, but you\u2019ve broken through two levels since then. Now you\u2019re a Final State warrior and a Warrior of the Yellow Board. I\u2019m glad to see that.\u201dYuxi said, \u201cFather, Ruochen\u2019s power is unfathomable. We can\u2019t define his real cultivation with normal martial arts terms.\u201d\u201cOh! Really? I am actually quite interested in his true cultivation. Hai Shu, go and compete with the Ninth Prince. I hope you can tell me the extent of his power,\u201d said the Yunwu Commandery Prince.\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201dOn the left side of the palace, a person in an iron armor knelt down in front of Yunwu Commandery Prince. Then he walked towards Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cYour Highness, please!\u201dZhang Ruochen knew that his father would like to know his real cultivation.After all, it had been a month only since the year-end assessment. Even the Yunwu Commandery Prince could not believe that Ruochen could reach the level of Warrior of the Yellow Board in such short time.Concubine Lin sat next to the Yunwu Commandery Prince and said, \u201cRuochen, Lord Hai Shu is also a Warrior of the Yellow Board. He is ranked 23rd on the Yellow Board. You two can spar and learn from each other. At the same time, His Majesty will be able to learn about your ability.\u201dConcubine Lin was rather proud. Truthfully, when she heard the news of Ruochen becoming a Warrior of the Yellow Board, she could not believe it.With no doubt, she also hoped that Zhang Ruochen could become more outstanding and be recognized by his father. It was a common mindset of every parent who wanted their children to excel.\u201cThen, Lord Hai Shu, let\u2019s start!\u201dRuochen did not underestimate Hai Shu at all because all Warriors of the Yellow Board were top warriors.\u201cBoom!\u201dDriven by Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi, his Flash Shinning Sword was drawn out of its sheath with one Inscription of Power Series, two Inscriptions of Ice Series, and one Inscription of Light Series activated simultaneously.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s running Genuine Qi surprised the Yunwu Commandery Prince.That was because he saw more than 20 meridians inside Ruochen\u2019s body. Among these meridians, some of them looked different from others. Even with his great cultivation, he had no idea about these weird meridians.There were at least 23 Meridians, maybe even more.\u201cWhat exercises has he done? How can he open up so many meridians?\u201d\u00a0Yunwu Commandery Prince wondered doubtful.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe battle finally began.Zhang Ruochen used his sword, and Hai Shu took his blade.Hai Shu was also a Completion warrior at his Yellow Realm. His power was weaker than that of Liu Chengfeng. He was even weaker than Han Fu.When it came to the 15th attack, Zhang Ruochen used his Sacred Breaking Plum Sword which forced Hai Shu to drop his blade. He won the game.The space between Hai Shu\u2019s thumb and first finger bled and his whole arm grew numb. He said, \u201cYour Highness, you defeated me. As the 11th warrior on the Yellow Board, you have my admiration.\u201dAfter saying this, Hai Shu picked up his sword from the ground and returned to his original spot.\u201cThe Ninth Prince defeated a Warrior of the Yellow Board with only 15 attacks. It\u2019s truly eye-opening. Congratulations, Your Majesty! Congratulations, Concubine Lin!\u201d The old eunuch next to the Yunwu Commandery Prince flattered.The Yunwu Commandery Prince laughed loudly. \u201cHai Shu, it\u2019s a fair match. Your Blade Comprehensive State is just at the Initial Following the Mind Level, but my son\u2019s sword technique has reached the Advanced Following the Mind Level. With such stark difference, how could you win?\u201dThe Comprehensive State was also called the Heart State. It was about how a warrior interpreted martial arts.The Comprehensive State could be divided into three levels: Following the Mind, Integrating, and Combination.For instance, a sword warrior at the Following the Mind level could be called Sword Following the Mind.If he had reached the Integrating level, he could be called \u201cHeart Integrated into Sword\u201d.If he had reached the Combination level, he would be called \u201cHuman Sword\u201d.The rule of these three realms was also applied to Broadsword Technique, Spear Technique, Palm Technique, and Stick Technique.Generally speaking, Yellow Realm warriors who could reached the Initial Following the Mind Level were considered geniuses.Typically, only Black Realm warriors could reach the Intermediate Stage.Earth Realm warriors could make it.Zhang Ruochen was just 16. Yet he was already at the Yellow Realm and had reached the Advanced Stage. This was incredible. He could easily defeat other warriors in his realm.\u201cWhen I was at that age, I just reached the Initial Stage. But he is already an Advanced Stage warrior now. What a psycho.\u201d Yuxi whispered under her breath.The Yunwu Commandery Prince said, \u201cEveryone, please leave. I would like to talk to the Ninth Prince alone.\u201dWithin a moment, all people including Yuxi and Concubine Lin had left.Right now, there were only Zhang Ruochen and his father in Sunglow Palace.The Yunwu Commandery Prince left his throne and walked to the middle of the hall. He stood in front of Zhang Ruochen and asked seriously, \u201cTell me, how many meridians have you opened up?\u201dZhang Ruochen had no plans to hide the truth. He replied, \u201c27!\u201dIn fact, there was nothing to hide. Once he ran his Genuine Qi, his meridians could be seen from his skin. That could not be hidden from his father\u2019s eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot!\u201dThe Commandery Prince took a deep breath. 27 Meridians were beyond his imagination.The Commandery Prince had a serious gaze and said, \u201cDuring the last year-end assessment, I believed that you had a wonderful experience and gained some powerful techniques. If you don\u2019t want to explain, I won\u2019t force you. But you should learn to hide your ability.\u201d\u201cAfter the year-end assessment, I awarded you an Ice-Fire Kylin Armour. Why didn\u2019t you wear it? Don\u2019t you know that this armor can help cover some of your meridians so others wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dZhang Ruochen was a bit shocked. He did not know the intention behind the Commandery Prince\u2019s award.\u201cIn the future, I will wear this Ice-Fire Kylin Armour when I battle with others,\u201d replied Zhang Ruochen.The Commandery Prince nodded and said, \u201cThe only person in the Yellow-Level Colosseum who can see your meridian number is Liu Chuanshen. I will talk to him and ask him to keep it a secret.\u201dRuochen opened up too many meridians. In order to open them, he must have practiced some incredible techniques.These incredible techniques were desired by every single warrior!If Ruochen was noticed by strong warriors, he would be in danger.The Commandery Prince took out a purple gold box out of his sleeve. He gave it to Ruochen and said, \u201cThis is a Level Four Refining Pill, Kylin Pill. It was made of Kylin\u2019s blood and flesh. It should help you a lot.\u201dEach Level Four Pill was worth more than hundreds of thousands of silver coins. Even a Heaven Realm warrior would find it difficult to get one.Obviously, the Commandery Prince saw Zhang Ruochen\u2019s potential, so he awarded this pill to Ruochen to help him lay a more solid foundation of martial arts.The Commandery Prince said, \u201cWith your current cultivation if you take it directly, you won\u2019t be able to refine and absorb it. Your body will just explode instead. You should take it after entering the Savage God\u2019s Pool. With the help of the Power of Blood in the pool, you will be able to refine this pill.\u201d\u201cYou have just reached the Final State, right?\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded.The Commandery Prince said, \u201cFirstly, practice your Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool fully to become a top Final State warrior, then go to the Savage God\u2019s Pool to practice further! You will benefit from this more.\u201d\u201cI will!\u201d Ruochen nodded.\u201cOff you go!\u201d The Commandery Prince stared at Ruochen, then he waved his hand slightly.Ruochen bowed to the Commandery Prince before walking towards the palace door.He then heard the voice of the Commandery Prince, \u201cRuochen, you were born in a royal family. It\u2019s like a jungle here. Even if I\u2019m the king of this jungle, I won\u2019t be able to protect you forever. If you\u2019re not good enough, you\u2019ll be eliminated. However, if you\u2019re great, you\u2019ll excel at this cruel game. This is the survival of the fittest. Different people have different fates.\u201dRuochen slowed his steps. He did not turn around but said, \u201cI understand!\u201dAfter that, he walked out of the palace.Why wouldn\u2019t he understand it?A king normally had too many children. It was impossible for him to care about all his heirs.Only the outstanding ones would be given attention, while the average ones would never appear in the king\u2019s eyes.If Ruochen was like he had been before without demonstrating any talent in martial arts, he would just disappear in the Commandery Prince\u2019s eyes. However, it was a different story now. As long as Ruochen was excellent, he would get more and more resources in the future. His status would be higher as well.\u2026Another palace in the manor of the Yunwu City.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Queen threw a cup on the ground. The cup was smashed into pieces. She said in a cold voice, \u201cRuochen. He\u2019s a Warrior of the Yellow Board now! He did it in such short time. If we give him time to develop further, what will happen?\u201d\u201cMy Queen, what do you think?\u201d A beautiful servant next to the queen asked.

Then he returned to his place with Blackie.\u201cYou have just reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm but developed 27 meridians. What\u2019s the secret of you to practice exercises?\u201d Blackie asked curiously.\u201cI have no idea!\u201d Zhang Ruochen answered.Actually, Zhang Ruochen knew nothing about the exercise class of \u201cThe Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d, because only he and Emperor Ming had practiced it.Blackie said, \u201cI know that only when warriors cultivate the Inferior Class exercises of the King\u2019s Stage can they develop 27 meridians. However, as you are at the Final State of the Yellow Realm, you still have the space for improvement which means that you can develop more than 27 meridians. Can you tell me, are you practicing exercises of the God\u2019s Stage?\u201d\u201cMaybe!\u201dZhang Ruochen also became serious about it.\u00a0\u201cIt seemed to be necessary to be dressed in Ice-Fire Kylin Armor at any time to conceal my cultivation.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, even the Yunwu Commandery Prince could not protect him from being killed if other people knew that his practice was more advanced than the King\u2019s Stage exercises.\u201d\u201cFortunately, only the Yunwu Commandery Prince and the Manager of the Martial Market Bank, Liu Chuanshen, knew his condition at present.\u201d\u201cThe Yunwu Commandery Prince must keep it a secret.\u201d\u201cThe Yunwu Commandery Prince must have a conversation with Liu Chuanshen and give him warnings.\u201dZhang Ruochen recalled Blackie into the Yin Yang Wooden Graph before his practice.\u201cI have to watch out for the cat.\u201dThen, Zhang Ruochen started to practice after putting on the Ice-Fire Kylin Armor, which ranked sixth in Genuine Martial Arms.\u201cI must reach the Peak of the Final State as soon as possible!\u201dZhang Ruochen took out one Second-Class Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill and swallowed it.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill spilled inside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body, transforming into three Genuine Qi, like three Genuine Qi rivers flowing rapidly.Zhang Ruochen started operating all the Genuine Qi contained in 27 meridians and transforming the Pill Spirit of the Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill into the body\u2019s Genuine Qi stored in the Qi pool.Zhang Ruochen took six hours to absorb all the Pill Spirit from the Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill.\u201cThe Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool increased by seven times after the cultivation of the Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill. The remaining eight Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pills and four Elephant Fire Pills could fulfill my Genuine Qi in the Qi Pool and help me reach the peak of the Final State.\u201dThe practice went on.During the following eight days, Zhang Ruochen took six hours to take in one Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill, eight hours to rest, and the rest of the time to practice drawing Inscription of Space.Eight days passed.After taking in the remaining eight Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pills, the Genuine Qi inside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body has been increased by six times eight days ago.With his present strength, he could defeat Liu Chengfeng in 10 moves in their competition.However, the Qi Pool was not full of Genuine Qi and it didn\u2019t yet reach the peak the Final State required.Zhang Ruochen took out four Elephant Fire Pills and put them in front of him.The Elephant Fire Pill was the Third-class pill which functioned to refine the body, to improve the warrior\u2019s physique, and to increase the warrior\u2019s power.Certainly, a third-class pill, which can increase the storage of Genuine Qi to some extent, was much better than a Second-class pill.Zhang Ruochen took another eight days to take in four Elephant Fire Pills, making a great improvement in the physical quality of his body.At his first time making a breakthrough to reach the Final State of the Yellow Realm, Zhang Ruochen could unleash the power of 36 bulls without using martial techniques.But now, he could unleash the power of 45 bulls without using martial techniques. By using Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, the power of 58 bulls even could arise.Besides, the peak of the Final State was finally reached the moment the Qi Pool was filled with Genuine Qi.In this case, only one move by Zhang Ruochen could defeat Liu Chengfeng, or could even kill him.\u201cIn my case, few can defeat me among the top ten in the Yellow Board, let alone warriors in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm.\u201dPracticing 17 days in the Time and Space Spinel was equal to six days in reality.Considering the fact that he has reached the peak of the Final State, Zhang Ruochen could practice in the savage God\u2019s Pool.Zhang Ruochen couldn\u2019t wait to walk to the Imperial Ancestral Temple with the Fourth-class Kylin Pills.Obviously, guardians in the Imperial Ancestral Temple have received the order from the Yunwu Commandery Prince to let Zhang Ruochen pass. Thus, they didn\u2019t stop him.Zhang Ruochen walked straight to the underground the Savage God\u2019s Pool in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.The bloody pool water has always been boiling like magma.It was the second time for Zhang Ruochen to practice in the Savage God\u2019s Pool, where the water covered half of him the moment he walked in the Central Area of the pool.All the skin from his waist was painful, as it was almost splitting, with a burning and sharp pain caused by the boiling hot water.Fortunately, Chakras have been successfully developed that formed protective streaks of light with Genuine Qi flowing through his skin.Meanwhile, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s pores started to take in the Power of Blood, which has been carried to the Chakras through his pores, and then the Chakras carried it through his whole body.Every 15 minutes, the physical quality of Zhang Ruochen was significantly improved.Two days later, after fully adapting to the Central Area, Zhang Ruochen went to the Deeper Area one step at a time.When he walked into the Deeper Area, the level of the pool water reached his neck and covered his chest.The Power of Blood became stronger in the Deeper Area, with the temperature increasing to a terribly high level.\u201cPhew!\u201dEven though Zhang Ruochen had developed Chakras, it was hard for him to resist the power here. All the skin below his neck almost melted instantly.His body became bloody and badly mangled. If someone stood here looking at Zhang Ruochen, he might find that Zhang Ruochen seemed to be a bloody man.The sharp pain almost made Zhang Ruochen cry.But he bit the bullet and took in the fourth-class pill, the Kylin Pills.\u201cAo!\u201dA snarling of Kylin resounded inside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body.A ball of bloody light dashed out from his head, forming a cloud shaped like a Kylin.At Zhang Ruochen\u2019s present cultivation, he could not cultivate the fourth-class pill. Thus, to cultivate it by force would only kill him.Furthermore, his current cultivation could not resist the Power of Blood in the Deeper Area of the Savage God\u2019s Pool. Similarly, to enter it by force would melt his body into the blood.At present, although Zhang Ruochen was suffering pain, his body could still bear the Power of Blood and was not melted.There were two powers\u2014one from the inside, the other one from the outside.The two powers should achieve a subtle balance.As time passed by, the physical quality of Zhang Ruochen was improved by the Pill Spirit and Power of Blood that was taken in.\u2026Meanwhile, something happened in the Lins.Lin Jingye, the last house leader, returned to Lin\u2019s mansion in Yunwu City from the Omen Ridge.He immediately called in his three sons the moment he arrived.They were Lin Fengxian, the present leader of Lin House, Lin Enbo, the second son, and Lin Xizhao, the third son.Lin Fengxian bowed down to Lin Jingye sitting higher than him and said with respect, \u201cMy distinguished father! May I know your final outcome, whether you have reached the Heaven Realm during your practice in the Omen Ridge?\u201dLin Jingye responded, \u201cIt is easier said than done. But I indeed found some opportunities and improved my cultivation during my practice in the Omen Ridge. Although the breakthrough has not been realized, the method to make a breakthrough has been found. Maybe in three years, I could reach the Heaven Realm!\u201d\u201cGood news!\u201dAll three sons felt delighted about it.As was known, the house with the warrior who reached the Heaven Realm was quite distinguished from the one without this kind of warrior.The position of Lin House in the Yunwu Commandery could reach another level, being the third seventh-class family in the Commandery if Lin Jingye reached the Heaven Realm.Even the Yunwu Commandery Prince could attach great importance to a seventh-class family.At present, there were only two seventh-class families and 12 eighth-class families in the Yunwu Commandery.The Lins was one of the 12 eighth-class families now.The other two seventh-class families were the Xues, in the minister\u2019s mansion, and the Situs.Lin Jingye laughed and said, \u201cThe moment I entered the city, I heard that my grandson, the Ninth Prince Zhang Ruochen, became the genius of Martial Arts and the one who was the warrior of the Yellow Board at just 16. Aha! Ruochen\u2019s late-blooming makes me delighted.\u201cFengxian, the event three years ago was not blamed on Lan-er after all. You were furious with her and blamed it on her. But you are indeed brother and sister, so you need to seek an opportunity to apologize to her to break the ice.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, I am proud of her son, and also my grandson who is the genius of martial arts. You can invite him here to make Ningshan and him stay close. Aha! They are childhood sweethearts and I remember the promise the Commandery Prince made that they would get engaged. This could be true!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAll of the three men standing below seemed to be strange and silent, and no one dared to respond to him.The smile disappeared from Lin Jingye\u2019s face. He immediately realized that something bad happened and said in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? What happened?\u201dLin Enbo sneered and stepped ahead, saying \u201cFather, let me tell you the truth! Several months ago, the fourth sister took the Ninth Prince back here and tried to resume relations with us. However, my brother humiliated her and drove them out of here. Humph! They must hold great resentment of us! Rather than relations, we are enemies now! Look what you have done, my brother! Humph!\u201dThe third son Lin Xizhao also added, \u201cI agree! I thought it was a strong overreaction. They are our sister and nephew. How could you do this?\u201dLin Jingye became more enraged. He glared at Lin Fengxian and said, \u201cMy eldest son, you are the leader who should never be so impulsive! Chen-er is only 16 but is the warrior of the Yellow Board, which means a promising future. If he were to become the leader of the Yunwu Commandery, he would take revenge on us. That would be a disaster. Go to the palace with me to apologize to your sister now! You are an asshole! Damn it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how brilliant the Ninth Prince is, he will serve as a foil to the Seventh Prince. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dAfterwards, a young man in twenties entered.The skinny man\u2019s complexion was fairer than a woman who had glabrous and fine skin and seemed to be more feminine than masculine.His voice was strange, with a perverse yet sharp tone, similar to that of the eunuch\u2019s in the palace.He was the first genius of the Lins, Lin Chenyu.Three years ago, he had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm. However, he was condemned to castration after offending the Seventh Prince.Later, he became a servant of the Seventh Prince.\u201cChenyu, haven\u2019t you been to Yuntai Suzerain following the Seventh Prince? Has he returned as well?\u201d asked Lin Jingye.Lin Chenyu smiled and said in a sharp voice. \u201cMy Majesty found an ancient relic and got a great opportunity. He can\u2019t return temporarily, so he sent me here to solve some problems in Yunwu City. Such as that of my cousin!\u201dLin Jingye\u2019s expression became cold and he said, \u201cThe Seventh Prince sent you to kill the Ninth Prince?\u201dLin Chenyu shook his head and said, \u201cMy majesty is a hero who doesn\u2019t need to take my cousin seriously. The Ninth Prince would never catch up with him, even if he spent his whole life to practice. However, the Queen was worried that the Ninth Prince may fully develop and so my majesty sent me here to kill him.\u201d\u201cHe is your cousin!\u201d Lin Jingye said in irritation.\u201cSo what?\u201dLin Chenyu sneered, \u201cHe must die as my majesty wants. Papa, I have to mention you to be careful about your choice. After my majesty completed his cultivation in the ancient relics, his cultivation must reach a higher level. It\u2019s a piece of cake if he destroys the Lins! Haha!\u201dLin Jingye felt a little frightened about the Seventh Prince with his incredible talent.It was well known that the Seventh Prince ranked first in the Yellow Board at the age of 12.Nobody knew how high his cultivation was after so many years of practice given his immense practicing speed.\u201cWell, my majesty has promised to marry Ningshan as his concubine under my entreaty. I will report it to the Queen in detail to ensure that the engagement is made as soon as possible.\u201dLin Chenyu said assertively and relentlessly without any respect for the four seniors. After these words, he left immediately!\u201cThe Seventh Prince\u2026 will be engaged with Ningshan. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Lin Jingye asked.Lin Fengxian answered, \u201cFather, it\u2019s the decision made by Chenyu and Ningshan. Isn\u2019t it a good news for us if we can depend on the Seventh Prince\u2019s position and power?\u201d\u201cBut why does it give me the feeling that the whole Lins will become the servants of the Seventh Prince?\u201d Lin Jingye clenched his fist bitterly and indignantly.He felt helpless because the Seventh Prince was indeed powerful enough to destroy the Lins if they irritated him.\u2026The savage God\u2019s pool.The red shine around Zhang Ruochen disappeared after seven days and the skin of his face returned to the normal complexion.He had completely taken in the Pill Spirit of Kylin Pills.Zhang Ruochen had never felt so powerful before. At present, his body, even in the deeper area of the savage God\u2019s pool, was melted by the Power of Blood.Zhang Ruochen still remained in the deeper area of savage God\u2019s pool, with the Graph of 36 Meridians in his mind.The Power of Sacrifice integrated with the Savage God\u2019s pool helped him comprehend the heart vessel and Vessel of Spirit.When developing the 36 Meridians, the most difficult thing was to develop \u201cheart vessel\u201d and \u201cVessel of Spirit\u201d. It was as difficultly as climbing up to the sky to develop two Meridians.Three days passed. Zhang Ruochen laughed loud in the Savage God\u2019s pool and said, \u201cI understand! The method to develop the gaseous heart vessel is the same as the Power of Blood in the savage God\u2019s pool.\u201d\u201cIf I compare the Savage God\u2019s pool to the blood inside the warrior\u2019s body, the Power of Blood will be the heart vessel and my body is like the Qi Pool! I got it! I got it!\u201dEight days passed. Zhang Ruochen comprehended the truth of the \u2018Vessel of Spirit\u2019 in the savage God\u2019s pool.Actually, the principle was the same between the Vessel of Spirit and sacrifice.Sacrifice meant the communication between human beings and gods.Vessel of Spirit meant the connection between the body and soul.Vessel of Spirit did not appear at any time and any place. It would only appear when you connected your soul!That meant, the Vessel of Spirit did not belong to Meridians but to the power of sacrifice.What he sacrificed was not gods, but his own power.The power of sacrifice was contained in the Power of Blood. As long as he separated the Power of Sacrifice and kept it in the Qi Pool when he made a breakthrough to reach the completion of the Yellow Realm, he would develop the Vessel of Spirit automatically.Having grasped this fundamental point, the rest would naturally follow it!Finally, Zhang Ruochen completely comprehended \u201cthe Graph of 36 Meridians\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s time to make a breakthrough to the Completion of the Yellow Realm!\u201dZhang Ruochen intended to reach the Completion of the Yellow Realm in the Savage God\u2019s pool. Therefore, he took out one Marrow-washing Liquid from the internal space of his Time and Space Spinel and started to develop the 28th meridian.He continued on as though he was unstoppable.The 29th Meridian!The 30th Meridian!\u2026The 35th Meridian!The 36th Meridian!When the 36th Meridian was developed, a blast of sound came out of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body. The 36 Meridians were like 36 giant dragons flowing inside the body and formed 36 large circles of vital energy.A sacred shadow of god appeared behind Zhang Ruochen, 33 meters tall and bore a golden blaze.At that moment, all the warriors in Yunwu Commandery felt as though they were under incredible pressure, as though an invisible huge mountain weighed down on their heads.The pressure continued for a short while and then dissipated.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe average person took it for granted as a sense of suppression within their chest for a while.While people with strong martial arts had a feeling as though the sky was collapsing, feeling as though there must be something horrendous happening in the Yunwu Commandery.But Zhang Ruochen felt it normal except for the feeling of a tenfold increase of the Qi Pool and his success of reaching the completion of the Yellow Realm.\u201cAha! I can\u2019t imagine developing 36 Graphs of Meridians! Great! But how much power of bulls can I reach now?\u201dOut of the Savage God\u2019s pool, Zhang Ruochen decided to test his present power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then there appeared a pit with a diameter of three meters.Then the pit was surrounded by innumerable cracks.By observing the destruction to the ground, Zhang Ruochen could almost estimate his current power. He could burst out the strength of 78 bulls without the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm! If he used the palm, he could explode the strength of 88 bulls.No one had ever exceeded the extreme power of the strength of 100 bulls at the Completion of Yellow Realm before.Until now, no one could exceed the extreme power of the strength of 100 bulls at the Yellow Realm.However, as long as the Body of Martial Arts was incredible, his power was infinitely close to the strength of 100 bulls, even more than 100 bulls.In his last lifetime, the strongest explosion of his power at the Yellow Realm had reached 94 bulls. And this number was still invincible at the Yellow Realm 800 years later.Since he had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, it was very difficult for him to improve his power. Each time he improved by one more bull was more challengable.In this case, he could defeat the warriors of Yellow Board easily!He decided to test the power of the Vessel of Spirit!The most remarkable of the 36 Meridians, the Vessel of Spirit, connected the body and soul.For the average warrior, the soul was quite mysterious. It indeed existed, but invisible and untouchable.Zhang Ruochen sat with his legs crossed, regulated his breath and calmed himself to feel the power of sacrifice in his Qi Pool.Separate from the Power of Blood, the power of sacrifice was like a bloody river moving through the Qi Pool.It was the Vessel of Spirit!Boom!As the Genuine Qi was embedded into the blood Vessel of Spirit, it started to shake and broke through the head. It looked like a red light column of 21 to 24 meters in height.An illusory soul image identical to Zhang Ruochen appeared ahead. It was completely surrounded by the crimson light and seemed to regulate his breath as well.Certainly, this scene was only seen by Zhang Ruochen.The other people could only see Zhang Ruochen sitting with his legs crossed. They could not see the bloody beam and illusory soul image at all.Influenced by the power of soul, the whole courtyard began to gust waves of chilly wind, howling across the courtyard.It was amazing to connect with the soul!Typically, only warriors reaching the Heaven Realm could separate the soul from the acupoint. He could do it at the Completion of the Yellow Realm!The Vessel of Spirit connected Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body with soul. The longer the Vessel of Spirit was, the further the soul could be separated from the body. There was no limitation for warriors in the Heaven Realm.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s present cultivation was far from enough. His Vessel of Spirit was only 24 meters long, which meant that his soul could only be eight meters away from the body.It was known that the soul of a warrior at the Heaven Realm could only be 150 kilometers away from the body. Only in thought could one see what was happening several kilometers away.Meanwhile, warriors in the Heaven Realm also ran Genuine Qi to refine their soul, make it stronger, and to become a Martial Soul.If they ran the power of the Martial Soul, they could operate things in the universe and borrow Spiritual Qi from the universe to attack enemies.Therefore, every warrior at the Heaven Realm was counted as one of the mythical beings of Martial Arts!It was obvious that Zhang Ruochen had become strong enough to reach the Completion of Heaven Realm. He had cultivated his practice and his soul into the Martial Soul. Furthermore, the rare thunderbolt Martial Soul.It could transform the Spiritual Qi to the power of thunderbolt in the universe.This meant that Zhang Ruochen could operate Spiritual Qi in the universe and exert the power of the thunderbolt. He could only operate the Spiritual Qi within 24 meters with accuracy. If further than this, it would be difficult for him to operate!\u201cWeapon of thunderbolt!\u201dZhang Ruochen operated Spiritual Qi in the universe as in his last lifetime, trying to exert the power of the thunderbolt.It failed! What a pity!\u201cWhy was this? Although he had been reborn eight hundred years later, the power of soul was not reduced. But why couldn\u2019t he exert the power of thunderbolt?\u201dZhang Ruochen was lost in thought. Suddenly, something occurred to him. \u201cDid this mean that the change of his Sacred Mark to the Spacetime Sacred Mark had also changed his Martial Soul?\u201dIn order to make sense, Zhang Ruochen summoned the Blackie out of the Yin Yang Wooden Graph and told it about his doubt.\u201cWarriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm were able to separate the soul from the body and refine the soul to the Martial Soul? Are you kidding?\u201d Blackie did not believe in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s words.Then, it added, \u201cAccording to my knowledge, only warriors in the Completion of Heaven Realm could practice the soul into the Martial Soul. Do you have any common sense?\u201dZhang Ruochen did not explain and sat with legs crossed to implant Genuine Qi into the Vessel of Spirit.Boom!A 24 meter light column of red light rushed from the top of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head.The illusory soul image, indistinguishable from Zhang Ruochen, was suspended in the light column.Soul separation!Other warriors indeed could not see illusory soul image of Zhang Ruochen, but Blackie\u2019s observation was better than the normal one and saw the illusory soul image suspending in the light column.\u201cYour\u2026 your soul\u2026 could reach the realm of separate soul! How could it be?\u201d Blackie\u2019s eyes held a shimmery shine. \u201cYou must have secrets. It\u2019s impossible for normal people to practice the martial soul at the Completion of the Yellow Realm.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. Just tell me what my Martial Soul is.\u201d\u201cYou have developed the Spacetime Sacred Mark, so it\u2019s Soul of Space!\u201d Blackie shook his head and felt that the talents Zhang Ruochen had were too freakish to be accepted.\u201cSoul of Space?\u201d Zhang Ruochen repeated.Blackie said, \u201cTake out The Mystery of Time and Space and turn to page three, where there were introductions to the Soul of Space.\u201dZhang Ruochen immediately took out The Mystery of Time and Space and turned to page three, on which four ancient characters were written: Soul Of Space.The third page was full of dense words, documenting introductions to the Soul of Space.Zhang Ruochen took the whole afternoon to memorize the content.However, his comprehension level was less than one-tenth of the content.\u201cAfter practicing the Soul of Space, I can start to practice Space domain and the mark of time.\u201d Zhang Ruochen closed The Mystery of Time and Space, lost in deep thought.Blackie said, \u201cYoung man! I have to warn you that your present cultivation is too weak. Your Genuine Qi storage could not support Space Domain at all, and you cannot condense mark of time either. You\u2019d better wait to practice Space Domain until you have broken the Black Realm.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cDon\u2019t remind me, I understand this truth. The power of time and space is too esoteric, my present cultivation is too weak to control the two forces.\u201dZhang Ruochen took back The Mystery of Time and Space and said, \u201cI won\u2019t practice space domain until I\u2019ve broken the Black Realm. My cultivation has reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, but I\u2019ve only practiced two palms of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm. It is time to practice the third palm!\u201dThe balance must be reached between practicing skills and practicing martial techniques.Only the successful practice of the third palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm could improve the power of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm to the superior class of Human Stage.Over the next few days, Zhang Ruochen spent most of his time practicing the third palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm.He also spent a lot of time practicing the \u201cInscription of Strain-type\u201d and the \u201cInscription of Condensing\u201d. He wanted to complete the learning of all eight fundamental inscriptions of space as soon as possible.If he grasped the eight fundamental inscriptions of space, he could refine the Spatial Ring to have large internal space. If he sold the space ring, he could get rid of his financial dilemma.Then, he would have many silver coins to buy pills and improve his martial cultivation quickly.He had used all his savings to buy the weapon refining stove. He was as poor as a church mouse and could not take out a single silver coin.If he could not grasp the eight fundamental inscriptions of space in time, he would not be able to afford Blood Pills either!One day, the Ninth Commandery Princess visited the Jade Palace again.She rushed to Zhang Ruochen the moment she saw him practicing palm in the garden and said, \u201cNinth brother, are you in the mood to practice palm? Don\u2019t you know that Lin\u2019s tender heart is engaged to the seventh brother?\u201dZhang Ruochen retracted the internal Genuine Qi, stopped and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Lin?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was at a loss for words for a moment. Then she said, \u201cShe is, of course, your cousin, Lin Ningshan! A little bird just told me that our father and the Queen have recently agreed and decided the engagement will be held in the Red Autumn Festival next year!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and walked to his place without emotion.\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong with you? Don\u2019t you feel sad at all about Ningshan\u2019s future marriage to the seventh brother? From that day, you will call her sister-in-law!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess chased after him.Zhang Ruochen changed into new martial clothes with Ice-fire Kylin armor inside and said, \u201cIs it any business of mine that a member of the Lin family will be engaged to the seventh prince? Why should I feel sad? Now that you are here, let\u2019s go to the Yellow Fighting Palace again.\u201d\u201cWhy are we going to the Yellow Fighting Palace? Could it be\u2026\u201dAn amazing expression appeared on the ninth commandery princess\u2019s pretty face. She covered her mouth with her fine, slim hands, and said in a trembling voice, \u201cI heard that you have been in the Savage God\u2019s pool for 24 days. Could it be that your cultivation has reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm?\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded with a smile.What a freak! How could your practicing be so fast?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess was stunned with her beautiful eyes wide open.It was known that she was a martial arts genius who had reached the medium state of the Yellow Realm at 16. But she felt herself like a mediocrity compared with Zhang Ruochen.Riding in an ornate carriage, Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess left the palace to go to the Yellow Fighting Palace.The Yellow Fighting Palace was a good place to earn money. If one were to have ten winning streaks, he would receive 100 million silver coins as a reward.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuch a great number of silver coins was enough for Zhang Ruochen to buy a lot of pills, he could make a breakthrough to the Black Realm.He could learn the eight fundamental Inscriptions of Space gradually.A watched pot never boils. The more anxious he was, the harder to draw inscriptions.\u201cFinally. Ninth Prince, I have been waiting for you to go out. You won\u2019t be so lucky this time!\u201d Han Qingluo walked out from behind the wall, with her hands behind her and stared at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s carriage riding away with a chilling smile on her face.Han Qingluo, one of the four disciples of the Queen, followed Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s carriage to the Yellow Fighting Palace the moment she saw them leave the palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0TransnZhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess had just arrived at the Yellow Fighting Palace when a deafening cry emanated from the Warfare Palace.After the sound, a headless body was carried out by other people.Zhang Ruochen glanced at the body, and asked the housekeeper of the Yellow Fighting Palace, \u201cSir! What happened?\u201dThe housekeeper was very thin, looking around 30 years old as he answered, \u201cToday, a deadly swordsman came to the Yellow Fighting Palace. All the warriors who fought against him were decapitated by him. That was the eighth.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s expression changed slightly when she added, \u201cJust using a sword?\u201dThe housekeeper nodded and continued, \u201cHe is so excellent! I\u2019ve been here for 10 years, and I\u2019ve never seen a young man whose sword technique is so brutal, merciless, and cold. He strikes as fast as lighting. How horrible it is! Are you able to guess how old he is?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess answered, \u201cThe person who can kill the warriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm with one slash must be 18 or 19 years old at the least.\u201dThe housekeeper shook his head and murmured, \u201cHis name is Le and he is just 15 years old.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was suddenly shocked.\u201c15 years old!? Let me have a look.\u201d Zhang Ruochen walked into the Yellow Fighting Palace with his hands behind his back.At that moment, a sallow and emaciated boy stood inside the Coliseum.He looked 14 or 15, dressed in tattered clothes, and held a rusty sword stained by dripping blood.He held himself straight like a sculpture, but his gaze betrayed fear and murderous feeling.Having continuously killed eight warriors, he had momentum climb to the peak.No one dared to get into the Coliseum under the pressure of his murderous feeling.Zhang Ruochen stared at the boy in the center of the Coliseum. As a young swordsman, he distinctly felt the Sword Comprehension and the murderous feeling of the boy, Le.Zhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cHe is gifted. His Sword Breath followed the Heart. The realm of his Sword Comprehension which is rich in murderous intent has reached the Intermediate Stage of the Following the Mind.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess also looked at the boy and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like a pure Terran, but a Magic Wolf Half-Human of the Half-Human clan.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! He is a Magic Wolf Half-Human! See, his eyes is blood red, just the same as the \u2018wolves\u2019.\u201dAt this moment, a cold laughter echoed from the distance and said, \u201cRuochen. You\u2019ve been three years gone, I really miss you.\u201dZhang Ruochen looked towards the direction of the laughter. He spotted a handsome man with a pale complexion standing in the grandstand and smiling at him.He also saw another acquaintance, Lin Ningshan.Lin Ningshan was wearing a white chiffon shirt with a sachet and a jade pendant on her waist. She looked taller with a graceful body, snow-white skin and long black hair hung over her waist.Lin Ningshan was clearly extremely beautiful. She had blackened eyebrows, big blinking eyes, ruby lips, a slender neck, a stiff bosom and straight legs. She was as perfect as a world beauty walking out of a scroll.\u201cCousin, don\u2019t you even know me?\u201d Lin Chenyu stared at Zhang Ruochen with a coquettish and evil smile.Zhang Ruochen had already known who he was after seeing Lin Ningshan.Since he greeted forwardly, Zhang Ruochen decided to behave himself decently and to them, saying, \u201cLong time no see. I didn\u2019t expect to meet you at here.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess whispered, \u201cRuochen, don\u2019t get too close to Lin Chenyu. He behaves badly and is sinister and crafty. It is not suitable to make friends with him.\u201dNinth Commandery Princess\u2019s voice was very small but was still heard by Lin Chenyu.Lin Chenyu\u2019s ears moved slightly with his eyes gleaming, and said, \u201cHem! Ninth Commandery Princess, you speak ill of me in front of me. How terrible! Is this the decorum of the Royal Family?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess retreated with a complex look on her face and a muffled sound in her throat when she heard the cold hum from Lin Chenyu.She stopped with a trace of blood spilling out of her mouth. She had suffered internal injuries.Zhang Ruochen thought,\u00a0\u201cWhat a great cultivation he has! It must have reached the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm or stronger.\u201dIn each realm, there were seven more stages: the Initial Stage, the Middle Stage, the Advanced Stage, the Dawn State, the Medium State, the Final State and finally, the Completion.A warrior who had reached the Black Realm was a master of Martial Arts. If he joined the army, he would be a general at least.Of course, in the Black Realm, every advancement to a higher small realm grew more difficult.Lin Chenyu deserved to be considered the first genius of Lin family. He had reached such an unfathomable realm at just 20 years old.Finally, the ninth challenger entered the Coliseum to challenge the deadly swordsman.It was known that the former challengers were killed by the deadly swordsman. The person who still dared to challenge him was clearly very brave.\u201cDeadly swordsman, I, Han Fu, have come to challenge you!\u201d Han Fu stood in front of him with an axe in one hand.Every warrior was looking at the Coliseum.The challenger of the ninth battle was Han Fu, who was a Warrior of Yellow Board.Since he had fought against Han Fu, Zhang Ruochen knew about his ability.The Ninth Commandery Princess had wiped away the bloodstain, distanced herself from Lin Chenyu, stared at the Coliseum, and said, \u201cI\u2019m unable to predict how many swords Han Fu can catch.\u201dZhang Ruochen answered, \u201cIf Han Fu can catch his first sword, he can keep his life. Otherwise, he might die!\u201d\u201cHow can only one sword have the potential to kill Han Fu? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said.Zhang Ruochen was silent as he gazed at the Coliseum.\u201cPuff!\u201dIn an instant, Han Fu\u2019s head had flown out of the Coliseum, falling to the ground like a ball.In the ninth battle, the deadly swordsman had won!After a short silence, the entire Warfare Palace broke out loudly in shouts and exclamations.\u201cOnly a single sword\u2026 I didn\u2019t even see his attack clearly and only perceived a shadow of that strike.\u201d\u201cWhat class of sword technique did he use?\u201d\u201cIt was far too fast to see how he employed the sword.\u201d\u201cIn the last month, even the Ninth Prince, a genius, needed more than 80 attacks to defeat Han Fu in a match!\u201d\u201cWill another talented young warrior be rising?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was also startled and asked, \u201cRuochen, did you see his attack?\u201dZhang Ruochen laughed and said, \u201cHis action is quite fast, but it contains a fatal flaw. The others won\u2019t notice it, but I have. Of course, the world of martial arts can defeat everything but speed. His speed can cover the flaw to an extent. If it was a month ago, the result would be hard to predict. But now\u2026Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t continue speaking and stared at the Coliseum.Finally, the deadly swordsman began the 10th battle.The next person who fought against him was Su Heng, an elderly man.Sorrowfully, Su Heng also died, becoming a headless corpse and lying in a pool of blood.\u201cHe must be so invincible!\u201dHe had won ten rounds in a row. Every single match was settled only with one blade.Even no exception for a Warrior of Yellow Board.The young swordsman showed a more incredible talent than the one the Ninth Prince showed within the last month.The principal of the Yellow Fighting Palace quickly provided an assessment of his performance.He was ranked sixth on the Yellow Board!The reason why he was only sixth was that nobody could force him to try his best. If he showed his complete might, his rank would be higher.Le, the deadly swordsman, still looked cold and heartless. He departed from the Coliseum carrying his macabre sword.Completely Emotionless!He had not returned to a mild countenance until he saw Lin Ningshan. He felt his heart\u2019s beat increase, quickly averted his eyes, and said, \u201cMiss Lin, I kept my word and won ten matches without any losses.\u201dLin Ningshan smiled sweetly, touching Le\u2019s shoulder softly as she said, \u201cLe, as your talent is so strong that many great powers would like to draw you over to their side. Why do you choose to remain in our family as a servant?\u201dLe bit his lip lightly, stared at her beautiful face and said, \u201cI\u2019m willing to stand by you forever and remain content.\u201dIn his view, the girl in front of him was so perfect and holy that it was satisfying to stay with her.Lin Ningshan nodded and smiled, but there was contempt in her eyes.Lin Ningshan looked arrogantly at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cCousin, you practice the sword as well. If you fought against Le, how many attacks could you receive?\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at Le, thought a moment and said indifferently, \u201cSince he is so willing to protect you, you should treasure him!\u201dAfter saying that, Zhang Ruochen headed for the Coliseum and didn\u2019t bother Lin Ningshan anymore.When she saw Zhang Ruochen enter the Coliseum, Lin Ningshan thought,\u00a0\u201cHe has become a Warrior of Yellow Board, why did he walk into the Coliseum? Did he\u2026?\u201d\u201cHa! This is fun!\u201d Lin Chenyu smiled with his eyes betraying murderous intent.Maybe he found it humorous that Zhang Ruochen could be slain inside the Coliseum.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Chenyu waved to Le and said, \u201cLe, come here!\u201d\u201cMaster, what do you want me to do?\u201d Le said.Lin Chenyu laughed, \u201cLook carefully. The youth inside the Coliseum is a pursuer of Ningshan. You will possibly kill him later. Are you sure about this?\u201d\u201cIn my eyes, there are two kinds of people: The living and the dead. Either he dies or I die.\u201dLe stared at the Coliseum sharply, his gaze as sharp as sharp as a sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Does he want to challenge the ten warriors of Yellow Board.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cOnly a short time had passed by, even if his cultivation was improved, it would not enhance too much.\u201d\u201cThere was nobody can get the ten-fight winning streaks in the Yunwu Commandery. It was so difficult that even the Seventh Prince couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\u2026Every Warrior of Yellow Board could fight against ten warriors at the Completion of the Yellow Realm at the same time.Some weaker warriors of Yellow Board who could not do that were able to survive under their attacks.So, it was not easy to defeat a warrior of Yellow Board.Took Le, a deadly swordsman, for example, he could kill a warrior of Yellow Board with one single attack, but he could not kill ten with ten attacks successively.\u201cIf the Ninth Prince has broken through the Completion of the Yellow Realm, and doesn\u2019t meet the old men who rank top five on the Yellow Board, it is not difficult for him to win five matches!\u201d\u201cJust wait and see! Since the Ninth Prince dares to come to the Yellow Fighting Palace, he must be confident enough.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe Ninth Prince, you\u2019re here again! Last time, you are so lucky that you defeat me. But this time, you can\u2019t be lucky again!\u201dLiu Chengfeng first got on the Coliseum with cold eyes.Looking at Liu Chengfeng, Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cDo you want to be the first to challenge me?\u201d\u201cOf course, are you afraid of being defeated in the first battle?\u201d Liu Chengfeng said.\u201cOK!\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and reached out a hand to motion him to start.Liu Chengfeng stared at the sword held by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s other hand and said, \u201cDo you try to fight against me without a sword?\u201d\u201cYes, not now.\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.\u201cHow dare you despise me! You have to pay for your arrogance,\u201d Liu Chengfeng got angry as he thought Zhang Ruochen humiliated him on purpose.It was known that he would not have failed if he had not made a wrong judgment in the battle of last month.He must regain his lost face at the same place.\u201cSpark Fire Flies!\u201dLiu Chengfeng directly demonstrated \u201cMeteor Sword Technique\u201d, a martial technique of the Superior class at Human Stage. He whamed quickly, thus making the sound of popping echoed in the air.Compared to the sword technique of last month, Liu Chengfeng got a big progress.The Meteor Sword Technique that he showed was more subtle and was as fluent as Floating Clouds and Flowing Water. The sword screeched.Zhang Ruochen was as steady as the Mount Tai and only lifted his arms and reached two fingers to nip the sword of Liu Chengfeng.\u201cBoom!\u201d\u2013With a slight flick of his finger, a mighty power reached to Liu Cheng Feng\u2019s arms from the sword.\u201cBang!\u201dA sound of bone fracture went off loudly!Both his wrist and arms were broken and his sword fell to the ground.\u201cYou\u2026 Why did your cultivation become so powerful?\u201d Liu Chengfeng stepped back seven steps. His half body was shocked to numbness. He felt like being thumped heavily making it hard to move his fingers.Zhang Ruochen defeated him only with two fingers.He took back his fingers and said calmly, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost!\u201dDefeating Liu Chengfeng with two fingers, Zhang Ruochen had the crowd on their feet.Even the warrior of Initial Stage of the Black Realm could not defeat Liu Chengfeng so easily.\u201cIt becomes more and more interesting!\u201d Lin Chenyu sat upright, stared at Zhang Ruochen with a big sneer.The challengers who fought against Zhang Ruochen in the following six battles were all the warriors of Yellow Board.Hua Shuli was 24 on the Yellow Board.Huo Yi was ranked top 19.Wang Linsheng ranked top 13.Wang Qing ranked 27.Zhang Gengshu ranked top nine.Without exception, all of them were defeated by Zhang Ruochen with one move, and no one was able to force him to use the second attack.Zhang Gengshu, one of the most mighty warriors of Yellow Board, who ranked top nine and could break out the power of 52 bulls was still slapped out of the Coliseum by him.\u201cHe defeated seven warriors of Yellow Board successively with just one move. That was horrible!\u201d\u201cJust one month over, what powerful realm did he cultivate?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t use common sense to treat the Genius of Martial Arts.\u201dThere was a hubbub in the battle venue of Yellow Stage because the crowd felt incredible about what they saw.The beautiful ladies of the nobility stared at Zhang Ruochen with adoration in their eyes.\u201cThe Ninth Prince is so handsome! I would gladly give 10 years of my life to marry him and become his Crown Princess.\u201d A girl about 13 or 15 obsessively gazed at Zhang Ruochen with adoration.\u201cThe Ninth Prince is too noble to choose you.\u201d\u201cHe is not only good-looking and gifted, but also gentle. He is polite to every opponent. As he is a modest phenom, I would even like to be his maid.\u201dHearing what the ladies of the nobility said, Lin Ningshan felt unpleasant and said coldly, \u201cLe, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHe went to the Coliseum carrying his sword with a determined look,A grey figure passed quickly beside him and stepped on the Coliseum before him.He was an old, thin man with a wrinkly face. But his hair was blacker than the young\u2019s and he was in fine fig with bright eyes.The old man smiled, looked at Le, and said, \u201cHa, ha! Sonny, just wait a minute and I will fight against the Ninth Prince first.\u201dThen, he turned to Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cI\u2019m Shui Wenxin, I\u2019d like to see your merit. The Ninth Prince will you use your sword when you fight against me?\u201dAs soon as the old man spoke out his name, the scream echoed in the crowd.\u201cOh my god! Shui Wenxin, the top three on the Yellow Board, he should stay in Yunwu City.\u201d\u201c40 years ago, he was a warrior of Yellow Board. At that time, he was also a genius but because of jealousy from a warrior of the Black Realm, he fell a prey to a plot and been injured, as a result, he never broke through the Black Realm.\u201d\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t been injured, he would have become a superior at the Earth Realm already.\u201d\u201cIt will be interesting! It is not easy for the Ninth Prince to defeat him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s said that Shui Wenxin defeated a warrior of Initial Stage of the Black Realm. His strength was very strong.\u201d\u201cThe warriors ranked top five on the Yellow Board were all have the capacity of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. The two freaks of first and second killed a warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, but they joined together to kill him.\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at Shui Wenxin seriously.The old man, like Shui Wenxin, had been practiced at the Completion of the Yellow Realm for decades. He must have mastered many martial techniques and had various means. The young couldn\u2019t compare well with them.The third of the Yellow Board proved his power.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat weapons do you use?\u201d\u201cHa, ha! I never use a weapon, and my hands and foot are my best weapons.\u201d Shui Wenxin laughed and said.Zhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cIf so, I don\u2019t use a weapon either, let\u2019s fight just with hands and foot!\u201dShui Wenxin gave an approving glance and said, \u201cDon\u2019t boast! I have been drinking blood of savage beast for many years and built up my body by Pill. Although I just reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, I could break out the power of 72 bulls. No one could catch my hands and foot at the Yellow Realm, even the first and second of the Yellow Board.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I am younger than you, but my strength is not inferior to you.\u201d\u201cOK! Ninth Prince, watch out!\u201dShui Wenxin raised his arms, ran the Genuine Qi to his ten fingers, and pinched quickly. As a result, his whole body gave a sound of cracking.\u201cBoom!\u201dSuddenly, he stepped on the ground and punched Zhang Ruochen\u2019s face.His punch was so fierce that unlike fist technique of an old man.Zhang Ruochen slapped and his palm collided with the fists of Shui Wenxin.Shui Wenxin stepped back six steps continuously while Zhang Ruochen stood still.\u201cI punch with the power of 56 bulls, and he can catch it easily and drive me off. Now it is understandable that he dare to compare with me. If he tries his best, he can break out more than 70-bull power.\u201dHe was shocked for a while then continued punching again.He did not plan to fight against Zhang Ruochen with brute force. He decided to use another fist technique.Random Cloud Fist, the martial technique of mid-class of Human Stage.He punched one fist, appearing six illusory images of the fist.He continuously punched 10 fists, there were 60 illusory images of the fist.\u201cIt\u2019s excellent, his fist technique has reached the high level of the Following the Heart.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen spotted his attainment of the Martial Arts at one single glance.Generally, only the powerhouse of the Earth Realm can reach the high Realm where the fist follows the Heart.That was to say if he had not been plotted against, he must have reached the Earth Realm or a higher realm.Zhang Ruochen had to carefully and continuously used palm technique, appearing tens of illusory images of palms, to slap back Shui Wenxin\u2019s fist technique.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBang! Bang!Zhang Ruochen was stronger than Shui Wenxin, making him retreat continuously.\u201cAwesome! Your power is stronger than me. If you can catch me next attack, there will be no doubting that you will be the first of the Yellow Board.\u201dObviously, Shui Wenxin was confident about his next move.He had never used it, a life-saving attack. Once he punched, even the first of the Yellow Board could not catch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Soon after he discovered it was the martial technique of Shui Wenxin.\u201cHaha! That\u2019s right. It is the Vajra Fist!\u201d Shui Wenxin laughed.The Vajra Fist was a common fist technique of martial arts in the Spiritual Stage. It was popular that the Fist Booklet could be found in many commanderies.However, no matter how popular and common the Vajra Fist was, it was a martial technique of the Spiritual Stage which was classified as one of the supreme techniques. Only the Commandery Prince\u2019s Mansion, the Suzerain, and the large-scale family could record it.It was as difficult as to climb up to the sky for an ordinary warrior to practice the Vajra Fist.Shui Wenxin just happened to learn the Flaming King Kong, which was one of fist technique out of 18 Vajra Fists.By demonstrating the fist technique, he had broken out the strength of 78 bulls that even the first of the Yellow Board couldn\u2019t do it.In other words, once he unleashed the Vajra Fist, he would be capable of being the first of the Yellow Board.A female warrior in her 30 from the Yellow Board said, \u201cShui Wenxin has practiced one of the techniques of Vajra Fist unexpectedly. The Black Belle, the first of the Yellow Board, is no match for him if he uses this move.\u201dA warrior of the Yellow Board who had been defeated by Zhang Ruochen mentioned, \u201cShui Wenxin is just a little weaker than the Black Belle before practicing the martial technique of Spiritual Stage. The Black Belle can only defeat him by using the Uncertain Sword Technique of the low-class of Spiritual. As for now, he has cultivated the Vajra Fist with a more powerful force and thus It is not difficult for him to win over the Black Belle.\u201d\u201cIf he can defeat the Ninth Prince, he will become the first of the Yellow Board after this fight.\u201dA young girl asked, \u201cIf the Ninth Prince defeats Shui Wenxin, does that mean he will be the first?\u201dAn old man standing next to her giggled and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince will not win. Shui Wenxin uses the martial technique of Spiritual Stages which means he is confident enough to win the fight.\u201d\u201cThe Ninth Prince is obviously weaker than Shui Wenxin. I guess Le needn\u2019t fight against him.\u201d\u00a0Lin Ningshan thought with disappointment.If Zhang Ruochen fought against Le, the defeat would be more than losing the fight.Instead, he would be killed.Lin Ningshan hated Zhang Ruochen especially when she saw he was in the spotlight and worshipped by others. She wanted him to die in front of her.She didn\u2019t even know why she hated him so much.\u201cFlaming King Kong!\u201dShui Wenxin punched his two fists with enough power.His Genuine Qi was burning and turned into two iron flame fists. At the same time, he broke out the strength of 78 bulls.Shui Wenxin could have repulsed hundreds of warrior only by his momentum at a war.However, rather than retreated, Zhang Ruochen rushed out like a brute elephant. He activated the power of his muscle and bones and transported it to his arms.\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201dHe unleashed one palm and broke out the strength of 88 bulls.The outcome was obvious.As long as his fists met with Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palms, Shui Wenxin flew out and fell on the ground 10 meters away. He almost fell off the Coliseum.Yet, Zhang Ruochen stood in the center of the Coliseum steadily and slowly retracted his palms.It was quite a crush of power.Having looked at his fists and Zhang Ruochen, Shui Wenxin sighed and said, \u201cYour cultivation is indeed beyond mine! Such a talented warrior! From now on, you\u2019re the first of the Yellow Board. With your talent, I\u2019m sure you will break through the Black Realm very soon. I guess you won\u2019t bother with being the first at all! Haha!\u201dAfter a long sigh, Shui Wenxin left the Coliseum and gave in with much desolation.Only himself knew how massive the gap was compared to Zhang Ruochen. He must have been badly injured if Zhang Ruochen hadn\u2019t taken back some of the power in the last minute.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s power was so mighty that beyond everyone\u2019s imagination.Like Shui Wenxin said, Zhang Ruochen was not interested in being the first. Instead, he aimed at the 1,000,000 silver coins reward.After all, the Yellow Board just recorded warriors from the Yunwu Commandery featuring small influence. Yet, all warriors would fight for the ranking of the Profound Board as the reward was at a much higher level.Of course, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s goal was too high. If the other young warriors could win the first place of the Yellow Board, they would immediately become the hotspot in the commandery and get much adoration from young girls.Le, the deadly swordsman at the age of 15, finally got on the Coliseum with the discussion of the crowd. He was the ninth opponent of Zhang Ruochen.The warriors who were watching this felt more expectant.It was known that Le had killed 10 warriors with one single attack in the last 10 battles. None knew how strong he was.On the other hand, Zhang Ruochen had never lost as well. He even defeated Shui Wenxin.Both of them were outstanding young warriors. Who would be more powerful?\u201cThat\u2019s interesting! Both of them are good sword master of martial arts as well as unfathomable. I wonder who will win the fight!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. After all, the deadly swordsman had only displayed one attack so far. Maybe he is stronger than Shui Wenxin.\u201dThere were more and more people placing bets.Zhang Ruochen, winner. Pledge one for three times compensation.Zhang Ruochen, loser. Pledge one for two times compensation.Le, winner. Pledge one for two times compensation.Le, loser. Pledge 10 for one times compensation.Tie. Pledge one for four times compensation.Some bet Zhang Ruochen to win, some bet Le. Of course, some thought they would tie.The Ninth Commandery Princess had confidence in Zhang Ruochen. Without any hesitation, she bet 10 thousand silver coins which were all of her savings for Zhang Ruochen to win.On the Coliseum.The two young warriors stared at each other with ten steps in between.Le held his sword, stood still with eyes wide opened like a sculpture. \u201cYou are indeed so strong!\u201dZhang Ruochen responded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s great for you to reach such high level at your age. But, there is a dead bug in your sword technique. Fighting against me will not only lose, you\u2019ll probably die. You\u2019d better give in.\u201dLe\u2019s sword technique was indeed horrible. Even Zhang Ruochen had to fight at his best.Once he did that, he was unable to hold his hand.Either Le died or he died.Le looked towards Lin Ningshan, then turned to Zhang Ruochen with determination and said, \u201cWho lives who die, will only know until we fight!\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head slightly and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve practiced the \u2018Self-destructive Swordsmanship\u2019, a forbidden martial technique. You\u2019re not only killing people, but also hurting yourself. No doubt you can kill warriors of Yellow Board with one attack, but every attack is harmful to your body as well.\u201dThe Forbidden martial technique was a martial technique which was used at a certain cost of warriors\u2019 health.Took Self-destructive Swordsmanship as an example, every attack would consume users\u2019 own vitality.If Le used 10 times of sword technique continuously, he would end up killing himself.Of course, he had reached a high attainment in sword and far higher than his peers. As long as he didn\u2019t fight against warriors of the Yellow Board, he needn\u2019t demonstrate the Self-destructive Swordsmanship.The so-called forbidden martial technique was a horrible technique that not anyone could cultivate it.Le calmly said, \u201cSince you know what I practice, you should know its strength. Nobody at the same realm can withstand one attack. Not long ago, I\u2019ve killed a warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm with one attack.\u201dZhang Ruochen chuckled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve told you that you have no chance to win if you fight against me because there is a dead flaw in your Self-destructive Swordsmanship. It\u2019s incomplete, isn\u2019t it?\u201dLe calmly continued, \u201cDo you want to destroy my will in this way?\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head and answered, \u201cSince you\u2019re not giving in, well, let me see how strong your Self-destructive Swordsmanship is!\u201dIn fact, Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t hate Le. Instead, he appreciated his sword technique. He thought he would become a super swordsman one day.He had never killed people not only in this lifetime but last. He was very reluctant to end the young man\u2019s life, so he said a little much.Zhang Ruochen also drew his Flash Shinning Sword fighting against Le.Two Sword Breath gave off and collided in the air.Seeing the two guys fight against each other on the Coliseum, Lin Ningshan felt so excited.It was the best ending that if Le could get Zhang Ruochen killed. Otherwise, the death of Le would also make her excited.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA genius fought for her and finally was killed by another genius. Should not she be excited?That would be so wonderful!\u201cSelf-destructive!\u201dLe murmured. He rushed to Zhang Ruochen and quickly stabbed him.Zhang Ruochen stepped out and rushed to Le as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The contact between the two was brief before they crossed each other.After that, they separated at a higher speed.With their positions exchanged, they stood still.\u201cWhy are they so still? Has a victor emerged?\u201d\u201cWhat fearsome speed!\u201d From under the stage, Shui Wenxin stared at Zhang Ruochen and Le.With his cultivation, he was able to barely follow the tracks of their swords. But he was only 40% certain that he could intercept any of their swords.The 60% was the certainty of death.\u201cWho won?\u201d Lin Ningshan stood up. With her beautiful pair of eyes, she stared expectantly at the Coliseum.A standing Le took at his chest and felt a pain burning from inside. Blood gushing from his wound, staining a good portion of his clothes red.\u201cBang!\u201dUnwillingly, he fell down to the ground. One of his hands was tightly gripping his sword and the other was clutching his chest. His gaze was still on Lin Ningshan who was under the Coliseum.In the end, he lost and broke his promise to her.A thin streak bloodstain appeared on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s neck. It was a shallow wound; his skin was merely grazed.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t\u2026 you\u2026 kill me?\u201d Le was lying on the ground, eyes now on Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen, in fact, could have ended the battle unscathed. To do so meant he had to kill Le in a single strike.But he did not. The moment he made his strike, he forcibly altered the direction of his sword, so it was just slightly off. That was why Le\u2019s sword managed to graze his neck.Zhang Ruochen looked at him and said, \u201cI never kill!\u201dIn fact, he omitted the latter half of his sentence: \u201cUnless I meet someone who deserves to be killed.\u201d\u201cI owe you my life\u2026 in the future I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Le clenched his teeth like a stubborn lone wolf. He crawled down the Coliseum, leaving a bloody trail behind him.Zhang Ruochen frowned and glanced towards the direction of Lin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan.The Lin family was indeed cruel and merciless. They actually refused to send any servants to come down and help a heavily injured Le. Instead, they watched him drag himself off the Coliseum alone.Of course, that had nothing to do with him. After all, everyone had their own paths to take.Coming up was the 10th battle.There were two warriors of the Yellow Board in the Yellow Fighting Palace who had not joined the battle yet. They were Sikong Di and Yun Tian who ranked the fifth and 21th respectively.It was Sikong Di who would fight against Zhang Ruochen as he had stronger cultivation.Sikong Di was as strong as a warrior of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. But with both Shui Wenxin and Le losing against Zhang Ruochen, he naturally stood no chance.Without any suspense, Zhang Ruochen defeated Sikong Di with ease. He became the first warrior who obtained 10 winning streaks in the Yellow Realm on the Yellow Board.Not only did Zhang Ruochen win the new Iron Token of the Yellow Board, he was also rewarded with one million silver coins.There were words carved on the new Iron Token: \u201cZhang Ruochen, the first of the Yellow Board, the Yunwu Commandery.\u201d It was definitely an honor for him.As for the one million silver coins, he exchanged them for one thousand Spiritual Crystals. After all, it was more convenient to carry Spiritual Crystals than one million silver coins.Zhang Ruochen deposited 800 thousand silver coins to the Three-Star VIP Card of Martial Market Bank. With 200 Spiritual Crystals, he went and bought some pills at Qingxuan Pavilion as preparation to enter the Black Realm.\u201cNinth sister, you seem to harvest a lot?\u201d Zhang Ruochen walked towards the Ninth Commandery Princess who was cheerfully counting her Spiritual Crystals.\u201cI\u2019ve only won 20 Spiritual Crystals. It\u2019s completely incomparable to you!\u201d With half-lidded eyes, the princess looked overjoyed. After all, both she and Zhang Ruochen had won.For a Commandery Princess, 20 Spiritual Crystals were considered a large sum of money.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Qingxuan Pavilion to buy some pills now. Do you want to come?\u201d\u201cSure! It so happened I hit a jackpot. I can buy a Triple-Purity Genuine Qi Pill to break through the Final State of the Yellow Realm with these Spiritual Crystals,\u201d the Ninth Commandery Princess replied happily.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cSince I won one million silver coins, naturally it\u2019s my treat. Ninth sister, let me know if there are any pills you want.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, ninth brother!\u201d She threw himself at Zhang Ruochen, giving him a kiss on his face.\u201cBoom!\u201dThunder boomed in the sky, followed by violent gusts of wind and pouring rain.By the time Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess walked out of the Yellow Level Coliseum, there was a downpour.The streets were flooded with water. A fallen leaf swirled in the air, before falling into the murky water. It was then crushed into the mud by a passing carriage.\u201cHit him! People, hit him until his legs are broken! This is too infuriating! How useless are you that you can\u2019t even defeat a measly Zhang Ruochen?!\u201d Standing in the rain, Lin Ningshan coolly admonished.A maidservant held an oiled paper umbrella for Lin Ningshan.After receiving the order from Lin Ningshan, the four strong and powerful guards wore grinning expressions and repeatedly hit Le with iron rods.\u201cBang, bang!\u201dLe flopped onto a pool of rain water, with his both legs broken and his head cracked. His body was badly mutilated from the beating.\u201cA deadly swordsman? Bullshit! You\u2019re just a slave! If the mistress hadn\u2019t picked you up, you\u2019d have starved to death in the snow!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you very powerful? Where\u2019s your sword? Come on, kill me! Haha!\u201d\u201cHit him! Kill this useless thing!\u201d\u2026The four guards spared no effort in brandishing their iron rods, cackling as they did.Lin Ningshan stood on one side. With a tall and slender body, paired with a beautiful face, she stared indifferently at Le. There was a hint of contempt in her expression when she said, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for your talent in martial arts, why would I\u2019ve taken you home? Now that your meridians have been broken by Zhang Ruochen, what use I have for you? Hit him! Hit him until this good-for-nothing dies!\u201dLying in the muddy water, Le stared at Lin Ningshan with wide eyes. Then he closed them.His blood flowed out, staining the rain water around him red.A strong guard held a bloody iron rod and walked to Lin Ningshan. Bowing, he said, \u201cMy lady, I think he\u2019s dead!\u201d\u201cTruly a useless thing!\u201d Lin Ningshan spat coldly, eyes on the man lying in the pool of his blood and rain water.\u201cClank!\u201dA luxurious carriage sailed through the rain before stopping in the middle of the street.Lin Chenyu lifted the carriage curtain and poked his head out. With a sneer, he said, \u201cNingshan, we should go home!\u201dLin Ningshan nodded and got on the carriage without looking at Le who was lying in a pool of blood.The luxurious carriage began to move again and disappeared at the end of the street.Shortly after, a vintage carriage drawn by snow-white Lightning Rabbits pulled out of the Yellow Level Coliseum and stopped next to Le.Zhang Ruochen left the vintage carriage and looked at a blood-drenched Le. He reached out his finger and put it underneath Le\u2019s nose.\u201cHe\u2019s still breathing. He\u2019s not dead,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.The Ninth Commandery Princess lifted the carriage curtain and said, \u201cNinth brother, all his limbs are broken and he\u2019s so heavily injured too. He\u2019ll definitely die in a short while. Even his master didn\u2019t save him, why should we bother?\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t bother, he\u2019ll definitely die. Send two guards to take him back to the palace. Whether he lives or not depends on his will.\u201dZhang Ruochen took out a bottle pill containing 10 Saint Stone Pills, a second-class healing pill. Each of the pills was valued at 2,000 silver coins.He put one into Le\u2019s mouth and put away the bottle.The Ninth Commandery Princess immediately sent two guards to carry Le into another carriage. The vintage carriage then headed back towards the direction of the palace.Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess then drove the cloud rabbit lunar rover to the Pill Market.\u201cTick, tock!\u201dThe rain had not stopped.There were fewer people and vehicles on the street. Finally, they had arrived at a desolate street.In the dark, a figure darted past in a flash, falling onto the eaves of a four-storeyed loft from a wooden tower.It was Han Qingluo, one of the Queen\u2019s four disciples.Her green clothes were drenched by the rain, outlining her graceful body with a perky bosom and a slender waist. It was as if a beautiful ghost was haunting in the night.With a veil over her face, only revealing a pair of beautiful eyes, she stared at the vintage carriage.\u201cBoom!\u201dHer hand went to her belt, removing it from her waist. With a flick of her arm, the belt turned into a green Soft Sword.She stepped on the ground, flew off, and caught up with the vintage car.She then leaped and fell from the sky, stopping seven meters above the carriage, and slashed it.\u201cBang!\u201dThe vintage carriage split into two, flying towards both sides.The body of the driving maidservant was split into two.But the vintage carriage was empty. There was no trace of the prince\u2019s body inside.\u201cDid he escape in advance?\u201d Han Qingluo fell onto the ground, before standing in the middle of the street with a puzzled expression.Just as Han Qingluo was still in shock, Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess walked out from a distance in the rain.\u201cWho are you?\u201d the Ninth Commandery Princess asked angrily.\u201cEh?!\u201dHan Qingluo gasped. She really could not understand how they managed to escape her killing strike.The truth was they had been staying in the carriage throughout the ride, not expecting a killer. Yet, Zhang Ruochen felt a murderous feeling when Han Qingluo unleashed her power.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThus, he took hold of the Ninth Commandery Princess, broke out of the carriage through the wall, and escaped from the back.Zhang Ruochen gave Han Qingluo a once-over and asked, \u201cAre you a killer at the Black Realm?\u201dHan Qingluo carried a heavy murderous air and her eyes were ice cold. She was most definitely not a common warrior, but an assassin who had killed countless people.Assassins were fearsome as the master all kinds of killing skills and it was impossible to defend against them effectively. They could even kill a warrior of a much higher realm.A killer at the Black Realm was, naturally, even more frightening!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rain splashed on the Soft Sword.Cold aura rose from the blade, freezing the five raindrops on it into ice pellets as her secret weapon. She flung the pellets at Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess.Four ice pellets flew towards Zhang Ruochen; the last one towards the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen stepped out horizontally, standing in front of the princess. He focused his Genuine Qi onto the palm and unleashed his power. Just three meters away from them, the pellets shattered.\u201cClang!\u201dAll of a sudden, the blade clanked next to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s ear.Han Qingluo who had been standing in the middle of the street disappeared. Like a ghost, she materialized behind him and thrust her sword at Ruochen.The tip of the sword was aimed at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s nape.Zhang Ruochen did not turn around. Instead, he raised his arm and used two fingers to pinch the blade.\u201cDid you think I\u2019m Liu Chengfeng?\u201d Han Qingluo sneered.\u201cWhew!\u201dHer Green Soft Sword was like a spiritual snake, coiling around Zhang Ruochen\u2019s arm and pinning it down.Once Han Qingluo wrapped her Soft Sword around Ruochen\u2019s arm, all she needed to do was retrieve it. This way, his arm would be completely mutilated.Han Qingluo\u2019s sword technique was advanced, but Zhang Ruochen\u2019s intelligence was even more so.He freed the tip of the blade that he was pinching, pressing his two fingers at Han Qingluo\u2019s wrist through the snake-like Soft Sword.Genuine Qi was released through his fingertip, leaving a deep wound on Han Qingluo\u2019s wrist.The arm Han Qingluo used to hold her Soft Sword instantly lost strength. With a clang, the Soft Sword fell out of her hand and onto the ground.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHow was she to foresee that Ruochen not only had deep cultivation but also rich combat experiences?The assassination failed.Han Qingluo tiptoed on the ground, made a leap towards the rooftop of an ancient building on the street, and escaped in the cover of the rain.\u201cYou want to escape?\u201dCarrying his Flash Shining Sword, Zhang Ruochen flew to the top of the building. Stepping on the glazed tiles, he quickly chased after Qingluo.With all his 36 Meridians running simultaneously, he was even faster than Han Qingluo.\u201cHe\u2019s just a Completion warrior at the Yellow Realm. How can he be so fast?\u201dSeeing that Zhang Ruochen was closing in on her, a secretly worried Qingluo unpinned the nine thin Golden Needles from her hair.Her Genuine Qi was coming out of her, surrounding the needles. She threw these needles at Zhang Ruochen who was chasing her.\u201cWhew!\u201dIn the dark and raining evening, it was already difficult enough for a warrior to see his opponent, much less the nine flying Golden Needles. Zhang Ruochen was, however, different. He opened his eye vessel, improving his sight in the rain.\u201cDing!\u201dHe wielded his sword, knocking the needles away.He continued to give chase.It was bizarre to see that a Black Realm killer running away from a Completion warrior at Yellow Realm.Han Qingluo noted that his power was stronger than a Mid Stage warrior at the Black Realm and thought that she must relay this to the Queen.She injected Genuine Qi into her blood immediately.Her blood ran faster, allowing her to run five times faster than she was previously. She increased the distance between her and Zhang Ruochen.\u201cBoiling Animal Spirits! That\u2019s what a real Black Realm warrior has. It seems that she\u2019s at the Initial Stage.\u201dA Yellow Realm warrior mainly practiced his Meridians.A Black Realm warrior mainly practiced his Spiritual Blood.Boiling Animal Spirits symbolized warriors that had reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. Spiritual Blood was like boiling water coursing through the blood vessels of warriors, allowing them to unleash even stronger power.Some of the best warriors at the Yellow Board might defeat Initial Stage warriors at the Black Realm. However, they would find it difficult to kill Black Realm warriors.If an Initial Stage warrior at the Black Realm unleashed his Spiritual Blood to accelerate his speed, a Warrior of the Yellow Board could never chase him down.Even a genius like Zhang Ruochen was now slower than Han Qingluo.Zhang Ruochen stopped and stood on the edge of a tall pavilion. A hint of a smile crossed his lips. He took out some silver coins from the Internal Space of the Time and Space Spinel.\u201cIf you can use concealed weapons, so can I!\u201dZhang Ruochen ran his 36 Meridians and injected Genuine Qi into these silver coins, then he flung the coins.\u201cBoom!\u201dLike silver rain, the coins flew towards the person in front of him.\u201cBang, bang!\u201dTwo silver coins hit Qingluo\u2019s back, piercing through her shirt into her flesh. It left two bloody wounds on her back.\u201cOh!\u201dHan Qingluo spat a mouthful of blood and crashed onto the street.With her face down, she was still like a dead woman.Zhang Ruochen flew there as well and approached Han Qingluo carefully.\u201cWho\u2019s the one wants to kill me?\u201dZhang Ruochen turned Han Qingluo around and lifted her chin. He wanted to unveil her and see who she really was.\u201cOh no!\u201dJust as Ruochen was stretching out his hand, Qingluo\u2019s eyes opened. With a flash of a dagger, she slashed it on Ruochen\u2019s neck.Zhang Ruochen seemed to anticipate this and used his hand to defend himself.\u201cBang!\u201dThe humerus in Han Qingluo\u2019s arm was broken, prompting a painful scream. She said while crying, \u201cNinth Prince, even if you don\u2019t die today, there will definitely be others who will kill you in the future.\u201dZhang Ruochen somberly asked, \u201cWho sent you?\u201dHan Qingluo\u2019s body trembled for a moment, before she became still, no longer moving.\u201cTch!\u201dBefore Ruochen could unveil her, her body melted into a pool of poisonous black blood. It ate away at everything, even her clothes. Nothing was left behind.The Ninth Commandery Princess showed up, having finally caught up. She asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the assassin?\u201dZhang Ruochen pointed at the blood pool on the ground and answered, \u201cShe had a poisonous pill in her mouth. If she fails, she would crunch it and wipe herself out. Who exactly is the perpetrator to have such a loyal assassin?\u201dThe princess was stunned. She handed Ruochen the Soft Sword the assassin and said, \u201cThis is hers!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dZhang Ruochen took the Soft Sword and injected his Genuine Qi into it. It began emitting a cold aura.\u201cIt\u2019s a Level Three Genuine Martial Arm with nine inscriptions.\u201dZhang Ruochen inspected the Soft Sword again and shook his head. He could not find any clue.The princess asked, \u201cWho wants to kill you?\u201d\u201cIf we want to know, there\u2019s actually still a way to find out,\u201d said Ruochen.The princess was confused, \u201cThe assassin\u2019s dead, so the clues all are gone. Can we still find the person pulling the strings?\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled. \u201cOnly we know she\u2019s dead now, but the perpetrator doesn\u2019t. If we want to know who that person is, we just need to set up a trap. Sister, I need you to put on a show for me this time!\u201dThe princess was not sure what he meant. However, she was willing to play along.\u2026Two hours later.Inside the Queen\u2019s chamber, a servant was down on her knees. Panicking, she reported to the Queen, \u201cMy Queen, bad news. Han Qingluo failed her mission.\u201dThe Queen sat calmly on her chair and said, seemingly indifferently, \u201cShe failed even with her level of cultivation. Huh, this Ninth Prince seems hard to deal with!\u201dThat servant continued, \u201cIt\u2019s said that Ninth Prince was injured as well and is now unconscious. But before he fainted, he saw Qingluo\u2019s face.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThere was a slight shift in the Queen\u2019s expression as she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s she?\u201dThat servant replied, \u201cThe Ninth Commandery Princess said Miss Han was caught by one of the Ten Royal Guard Generals, Luo Tong. She was sent to the Celestial Prison. Your Majesty is now aware of this and he\u2019s very angry. He asked Luo Tong to find the perpetrator behind Miss Han.\u201dZhao Lin, the Queen\u2019s first disciple in her 30s, appeared behind the Queen. She said, \u201cMy Queen, Luo Tong is a boor and has never seen Qingluo. Even if he caught her, he can never tell who she is. But if His Majesty arrives and recognizes her\u2026 That\u2019ll be horrible!\u201dThe Queen\u2019s expression worsened. She said, \u201cZhao Lin, you\u2019ve been with me for 30 years! Among my four disciples, your cultivation is the highest and you have also reached the Initial Stage of the Earth Realm.\u201dZhao Lin asked, \u201cMy Queen, what would you like me to do?\u201dThe Queen ordered, \u201cThe Celestial Prison is dangerous. With your cultivation, only you can get in. I want you to rescue Qingluo before Your Majesty sees her, at any expense. If you can\u2019t, then kill her and destroy all evidence.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dZhao Lin paused before continuing. \u201cThe Ninth Prince has seen Qingluo\u2019s face, so he definitely knows that she\u2019s your servant. If he wakes up later\u2026\u201dThe Queen stood up and scoffed. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll send your two juniors to kill him. He\u2019ll never wake up again. Whoever who wants to go against me will never end up well.\u201d\u201cThat puts my mind at ease!\u201dZhao Lin knelt down in front of the Queen and bowed. She then changed into an outfit for the night and rushed to the Celestial Prison.Afterwards, the Queen sent her second and third disciple, Yao Su and Zhao Wuxia, to kill Ruochen before he woke up.Yao Su was a Completion warrior at the Black Realm.Zhao Wuxia was a Medium State warrior at the Black Realm.These four disciples acted as the Queen\u2019s four sharp swords. Besides Han Qingluo, the other three had already been with the Queen for more than 20 years. All of them were top warriors. They had exterminated nearly all the Queen\u2019s enemies for her.As long as the Queen had her four disciples, nobody could sway her status in Yunwu City.The Queen was confident in their abilities.The Queen waited in her chamber for six hours, but she never saw any of them return. Finally, she felt a bad gut feeling that something went wrong.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe finally received some news early next morning.All three of her disciples were ambushed, trapped by a large group of royal guards.In order not to expose the Queen, they all crunched their poisonous pills and killed themselves.Four disciples died in one night.After hearing the news, the Queen almost fell from her seat. She closed her eyes and said, a tremor in her voice, \u201cHurry\u2026 hurry up and send word to the Seventh Prince\u2026 ask him to come back\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Otherwise, Zhao Lin, Yao Su, Zhao Wuxia, and Han Qingluo, none of them would have been set up by the Ninth Prince,\u201d said Lin Chenyu who was sitting at a lower place.That same day, Lin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan were called by the Queen to figure out a counterplan.Lin Chenyu was the Seventh Prince\u2019s servant and Lin Ningshan was his fiancee. So now the whole Lin Clan and the Queen were sort of in the same chariot.Their futures were bound.The Queen recovered very quickly, she was a top warrior after all. She hummed coldly and said, \u201cYou think I overestimated him? You are wrong! I underestimated him, and that\u2019s why I was set up by him. It cost me four disciples. He\u2019s young but he\u2019s quite powerful. If we wait for him to develop further, what will happen?\u201dLin Chenyu said, \u201cActually if we want to kill him, we don\u2019t need the Seventh Prince. We don\u2019t need to do it ourselves. Why not get some killers from the Black Market?\u201d\u201cGood idea!\u201dWith a twinkle in her eye, the Queen said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave this with you. If you can make it happen, the whole Lin Clan will benefit later on.\u201d\u201cFor this kind of stuff, you should leave it to us. I am sure that I can get you his head within the shortest period of time,\u201d said Lin Chenyu obsequiously.Lin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan bowed to the Queen respectfully with their knees on the ground. After that, they left the Queen\u2019s Chamber.The Queen was from the Xue\u2019s which was a seventh-class family. Inside her clan, there was a Heaven Realm who led the whole clan. And the Seventh Prince was a God\u2019s favored son.In their eyes, if they could work for the Queen and the Seventh Prince, they would have a bright future. Besides that, the whole Lin Clan would benefit and become a powerful family in the Yunwu Commandery.\u2026Ninth Commandery Princess sighed and said, \u201cWhat a shame. The one who planned to rescue the prisoner, as well as the other two warriors who planned to kill you, died. They all poisoned themselves. Their bodies were corroded. We couldn\u2019t identify them at all.\u201dWithout a doubt, these three disciples had died because of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s strategies.All of them were scapegoats. They committed suicide by poisoning themselves.Their remains were exactly the same as that of Han Qingluo.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the person who went to the jail was an Earth Realm warrior who killed more than two hundred imperial guards. If it weren\u2019t for General Luo Tong and General Xiao Ling, she probably would have escaped. What a shame, she died as well. We could not find the person behind her,\u201d said Yuxi.Zhang Ruochen laughed with a thoughtful look and said, \u201cThey could send an Earth Realm warrior, I am afraid that he or she is a powerful, horrible person.\u201dZhang Ruochen doubted that the person who wanted to kill him was inside the royal palace.He went to check the recent personnel transfers in the royal palace. Unexpectedly, he found a few clues.Last night, four of the Queen\u2019s maids had annoyed her. So she sentenced them to death.\u201cWhat a coincidence\u2026\u201dZhang Ruochen speculated that the four maids had not been sentenced to death by the Queen. Instead, they were the four assassinators who poisoned themselves last night. The Queen had just found a proper reason to wipe them out.However, this was just Zhang Ruochen\u2019s speculation. Without any firm evidence, he could never prove that the assassinators had been sent by the Queen.The Queen was powerful and was supported by a seventh-class family, the Xue\u2019s.With Zhang Ruochen\u2019s current skills, if he waged a war against the Queen, it would be like using an egg to attack a stone.\u201cThe Queen\u2019s power is so strong that even the Yunwu Commandery Prince is somewhat afraid of her. Now I must be patient. If I am not patient, I am just killing myself.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen was 100% sure that the Queen was the person behind the assassins.But he couldn\u2019t kill her yet.His cultivation was still too weak.Zhang Ruochen frowned deeply. If the Queen intended to kill him, even though he could stay in the royal palace, his security could not be guaranteed. However, if he were to leave the palace, it would be even more dangerous.Yuxi commented when Zhang Ruochen was lost in thought. She said, \u201cBrother, the first deadly swordsman sent back yesterday is awake now. Would you like to have a look?\u201d\u201cReally? Let\u2019s go,\u201d said and laughed Zhang Ruochen.He did not plan to inform Ninth Commandery Princess of his speculation. The more she knew, the more danger would she encounter.Meanwhile, Le was lying on his bed, covered by white cloths. He looked just like a mummy.Although he was awake now, his gaze was blank and unfocused. People could probably not tell the difference between Le and a dead man.\u201cYour Highness, he hasn\u2019t moved an inch since he woke up. He hasn\u2019t even blinked. Is he coming towards the end of the dying process?\u201d Whispered the Maid Yun, bowing to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen came closer to the bed and peered at Le. He shook his head slightly and said, \u201cHe\u2019s alive but his heart is dead! For a warrior, a wound of the heart is more serious than a wound of the body. Have you applied the Muscles and Bones Regenerating Ointment? Once his limbs recover, let him go.\u201dAfter saying these words, Zhang Ruochen left.Zhang Ruochen was planning not to think about the Queen any longer. He prepared to practice further in order to reach the Black Realm as soon as possible.Once he reached the Black Realm, Ruochen would be able to practice the Space Domain and the mark of Time. By then, his power would have advanced rapidly.At least, when the Queen sent others to kill him, he was able to protect himself.In the Yunwu Commandery, Yellow Realm warriors were placed at the bottom.Black Realm warriors were considered stronger.Earth Realm warriors were considered the top masters. They could normally control any situation and were the Masters of Martial Arts.As for Heaven Realm warriors, each one of them was a Martial Arts legend. It was difficult to find them, however, they represented the ultimate power of Yunwu Commandery.If a Heaven Realm warrior wanted to, he could eliminate the entire Lin Clan in one night. As long as he could justify himself, even the official power of the Yunwu Commandery would let him go.Heaven Realm warriors, to some extent, had surpassed the legal system.However, if they slaughtered the innocent, they would be chased by the official power and become wanted criminals.Apart from the hidden warriors, there were only famous Heaven Realm warriors in the Yunwu Commandery. All of them were big shots. They dominated their areas. If they stomped on the ground, the whole Commandery would shake.That day, Zhang Ruochen, surrounded by a troop of royal guards, went to the Martial Market to purchase some Pills.He spent fifty thousand silver coins on 20 Three-Qing Energy Pills.He spent another sixty thousand silver coins on a Dark Blood Pill.A Dark Blood Pill was a top Third-Class Pill. If a warrior took it when they planned to reach the Black Realm, the success rate could increase up to fifty percent.But it was too pricy\u2014one hundred and twenty thousand silver coins. Even princes and princesses could not afford one. This time the Qingxuan Pavilion offered Ruochen a fifty percent discount. However, even with this discount, Ruochen could only afford one.Right now, every time Zhang Ruochen left the royal palace, he was escorted by a troop of one hundred guards.The captain of the guards was called Ge Qian. He was the Yunwu Commandery Prince\u2019s personal captain. He had reached the Earth Realm and was a top warrior in the Commandery.With Ge Qian\u2019s protection, he did not encounter any risk. After a short while, he went back to the royal palace.Mansion, Main Palace.\u201cYour Majesty, the Ninth Prince is a Genius of Martial Arts. His gift is not lower than that of the Seventh Prince. With the protection of General Ge Qian, his safety is guaranteed. However, there are some disadvantages,\u201d whispered an old eunuch.The Commandery Prince asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe eunuch replied, \u201cHow could an eyas grow up and fly high in a completely safe environment? Our royal palace is too comfortable, it will not help the Ninth Prince to grow up.\u201dThe Commandery Prince nodded slightly. \u201cIt makes sense. The Seventh Prince apprenticed to the Yuntai Suzerain and became an external student of the suzerain when he was fourteen. Two years ago, he managed to become an internal student because he was ranked first.\u201d\u201cIn fact, Ruochen should have reached the Completion Stage of the Yellow Realm by now. I am confident that he can reach the Initial Stage of the Black Realm very soon. Maybe he can have a chance to apprentice at the Yuntai Suzerain this year.\u201dThe basic requirement of becoming an external student of the suzerain was reaching the Black Realm before the age of thirty.Yenta Suzerain was a Four-class Suzerain, situated in the Omen Ridge which was a junction of the Yunwu Commandery, the Flame Dragon Commandery, and the Square Commandery. It was the largest Suzerain in the Nine Western Prefectures.A Black Realm could only become an external student of the suzerain.Only an Earth Realm warrior could become an internal student of the suzerain.Six of the fourteen Heaven Realm warriors in the Yunwu Commandery were students of the Yuntai Suzerain. In other words, if a warrior could join the Yuntai Suzerain, it was definitely something to be proud of.The eunuch shook his head slightly. \u201cYour Majesty, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper. If the Ninth Prince joins the Yuntai Suzerain while the Seventh Prince is already there, it won\u2019t be a good thing!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201dWith flames in his eyes, the Commandery Prince nodded slightly and said, \u201cThe Martial Market Bank has a School in the Omen Ridge which accepts students from the Nine Western Prefectures. Besides that, it accepts students from the Nine Eastern Prefectures, the Nine Southern Prefectures, and the Nine Northern Prefectures as well.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLiu Chuanshen once told me that he has strong faith in Ruochen and wanted to recommend Ruochen study at the School of the Martial Market.\u201dThe eunuch\u2019s eyes shone brightly now. He said, \u201cIf the Ninth Prince can achieve something in the School of the Martial Market, maybe he could be a top manager there one day. It\u2019s going to benefit the whole Commandery.\u201dThe Commandery Prince laughed and said, \u201cThe requirements of the School of the Martial Market are harsher and more difficult than those of the Yuntai Suzerain. An average warrior can\u2019t get in at all.\u201dThe eunuch laughed and said, \u201cYour Majesty, you overthink! The Ninth Prince is at the top of the Yellow Board, and he has a reference from Liu Chuanshen, who\u2019s the Manager of the Commandery Branch of the Martial Market Bank. In my humble opinion, the success rate can be higher than seventy percent.\u201d\u201cHaha! I think it\u2019s ninety percent!\u201d said the Commandery Prince, \u201cOnce he reaches the Black Realm, I will ask him whether he\u2019s interested in the School of the Martial Market or Yuntai Suzerain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Swish!\u201d Before dawn, the princes and princesses were already had been practicing their martial techniques there.Yunwu Commandery Prince had nine sons and 13 daughters in total. Once they obtained the Sacred Mark, it was compulsory for them to practice at the Martial arts field every day.Zhang Ruochen had never been there before. He was dragged by the Ninth Commandery Princess to practice with her today.The Martial arts field of the Royal Family was indeed seven to eight times bigger than the Lin\u2019s and was completely paved with one-meter-thick white slates.Inside the field, princes and princesses could practice with each other and the royal guards who had similar cultivation.In addition, a general at the Earth Realm would perambulate the martial arts field every day and instruct the princes and princesses.\u201cYoung Commandery Princess, when you practice the Wind Chasing Sword Technique, the most important part is to have a solid step as well as a smooth sword technique. Raise your left hand a little higher. Look at me, the sword is as fast as lightning.\u201dWhile the general was instructing the Young Commandery Princess on sword techniques of the inferior class at the Human Stage, he also demonstrated for her as an example.The adorable, six-year-old Young Commandery Princess was holding a small sword in her hand. It seemed that she had made some decent progress on learning the Wind Chasing Sword Technique.Having seen the Ninth Commandery Princess and Zhang Ruochen, the Young Commandery Princess\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened. She ran to Zhang Ruochen with her sword in hand and asked, \u201cAre you my ninth brother?\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at the Ninth Commandery Princess, nodded and said, \u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u201cOf course! You got first place in both the Year-end Assessment and the Yellow Board. You\u2019re the genius of martial arts. According to my master, you have already reached the advanced stage of Sword Following the Mind. Even he, himself is incomparable with you. He wants me to set you as my role model to work hard. My dear ninth brother, can you teach me how to practice the sword technique and reach the Realm of Sword Following the Mind?\u201dAlthough the Young Commandery Princess was little, she spoke clearly. She didn\u2019t sound like a child at all.Zhang Ruochen smiled and thought she was adorable. He asked, \u201cWho is your master?\u201dShe pointed to the general who clad in an armor not far away as she said, \u201cMy master is General Huo Si, one of the ten royal guards!\u201dZhang Ruochen observed General Huo Si, who was already walking towards them. He bowed to Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cYour servant Huo Si greets the Ninth Prince.\u201dHuo Si was classified as a warrior at the Earth Realm, superior among the royal guards. His salute to Zhang Ruochen clearly showed that he respected Zhang Ruochen a great deal and dared not to neglect him.No other prince or princess could enjoy such treatment from such a general.No wonder he was such a strong warrior at the Earth Realm. Zhang Rouchen could feel that his aura was like great mountains and seas. It was rather unfathomable. Zhang Rouchen nodded.Zhang Ruochen could figured out Huo Si\u2019s cultivation level with one glance.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s arrival caused the entire Martial arts field to turn lively. All the princes and princesses stopped practicing and gathered around him.The Fifth Prince said cynically, \u201cIt is said that your cultivation has reached the Completion of Yellow Realm and you have obtained a ten-win streak over the warriors of the Yellow Board. I\u2019m interested to know how powerful you actually are. I wonder if my ninth brother can impress us?\u201dThe Sixth Princes sneered and said, \u201cIt\u2019s said that you\u2019ve defeated Shui Wenxin who ranks the third of the Yellow Board. Everyone is saying that my ninth brother has an unfathomable power that can hold against 10 thousand men. I wonder are you more powerful than warriors at the Black Realm?\u201dThe Young Commandery Princess and all the other princesses showed eagerness in their eyes. They\u2019d heard too much about the Ninth Prince recently and wanted to know if he was as strong as was said in the rumors.\u201cRuochen, let me see your techniques. Show our brothers and sisters your capabilities.\u201d The Third Prince stepped out from the crowd and smiled.The 28-year-old Third Prince was wearing a gold-gilt silver robe. He smirked and looked at Zhang Ruochen with his arms crossed.Among the nine sons and 13 daughters of the Yunwu Commandery Prince, the Seventh Prince had the highest talent. The second highest was the Second Prince, then the Fourth Prince, the Fifth, and the Ninth Commandery Princess.The Seventh Prince who was not even 20 yet had already enrolled as an internal student of the Yuntai Suzerain.Both the Second Prince and the Fifth Commandery Princess were also students of the Yuntai Suzerain. The Second Prince was an internal student while the Fifth Commandery Princess was an external student of the suzerain.The Fourth Prince had also become an external student of the School of Martial Market last year.The Third Prince stood opposite Zhang Ruochen. He had attended the examination of the Yuntai Suzerain three times and unfortunately failed all three trials.He was not convinced that everyone said the Ninth Prince was a Genius of Martial Arts who could pass the exam of Yuntai Suzerain. Thus he wanted to prove his power by defeating Zhang Ruochen.The Ninth Commandery Princess said irritably, \u201cThird brother, you\u2019ve cultivated to the mid-stage of the Black Realm while my ninth brother is still at the Completion of the Yellow Realm. It doesn\u2019t mean anything if you defeat him.\u201dThe Third Prince frowned and said, \u201cMy ninth sister, what do you mean? I\u2019m just afraid our ninth brother will become arrogant after he gets first place on the Yellow Board. I want to practice my martial techniques with him. Besides, it\u2019s not humiliating if he loses to me. After all, losing to his brother is also a kind of training.\u201d\u201cClap! Clap!\u201dSuddenly, applause could be heard coming from outside of the Martial arts field.\u201cWell said, Third Prince!\u201dLin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan entered the Martial arts field.\u201cLin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan greet all the princes and princesses.\u201d Although he bowed towards the princes and princesses in the field, there wasn\u2019t any sense of courtesy in his eyes, instead, they sneered.The Ninth Commandery Princess frowned and said, \u201cLin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan, this is the Martial arts field of the Royal Family. You are not allowed to be here!\u201dLin Chenyu took out a waist token and said, \u201cAccording to the Queen, Ningshan and myself are granted to practice martial techniques with all the princes and princesses here.\u201dLin Chenyu then put away the waist token and chuckled. He said, \u201cRegarding what the Third Prince has just said, it does make sense! My cousin, are you afraid of losing? Is this why you dare not fight? Or do you look down on the Third Prince and think he\u2019s not a worthy opponent?\u201dHaving heard what Lin Chenyu\u2019s said, the Third Prince looked cold-blooded, \u201cMy ninth brother, are you going to fight with me? Or like Lin Chenyu said, you look down on me and don\u2019t want to fight?\u201dZhang Ruochen looked around and said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve already put things up. I\u2019ll fight with you.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess shook her head and said, \u201cMy ninth brother, don\u2019t be stupid! Our third brother wants to defeat you to enjoy a sense of accomplishments just because he couldn\u2019t enroll in the Yuntai Suzerain.\u201dZhang Ruochen chuckled and said, \u201cNinth sister, don\u2019t worry about me. I have a plan.\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation had improved considerably after a day\u2019s practice. His strongest force could reach the strength of 92 bulls.There was a chance that Zhang Ruochen would defeat the Third Prince who had reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.Seeing Zhang Ruochen had agreed, Lin Chenyu showed a cunning smile. He thought that Zhang Ruochen was hard-edged and it would be very funny to lose his faith by the hand of the Third Prince.A smile emerged on the Third Prince\u2019s face. He said, \u201cNinth brother, be careful. Don\u2019t lose by my first technique. Otherwise, you\u2019ll lose the reputation of the Yellow Board!\u201d\u201cBrute Bull Fist.\u201dWhat the Third Prince had displayed was Brute Bull Fist, a mid-class martial technique of the Human Stage in the military.There were altogether 10 levels of the Brute Bull Fist.After having practiced the first level successfully, a warrior would obtain the strength of one Brute Bull.The second level, the strength of four Brute bulls.The third level, the strength of nine Brute bulls.Similarly, at the 10th level, warriors would be able to unleash the strength of 100 Brute bulls.In the military, a lot of soldiers had practiced the Brute Cattle Fist, but no one could make it to the 10th level prior to reaching the Black Realm.At the moment, the Third Prince had only reached the ninth level and burst out the strength of 81 bulls.Although Zhang Ruochen had reached the Completion of Yellow Realm, his power had surpassed a number of warriors in the same realm. Even if he didn\u2019t demonstrate the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, he could bring out the strength of 81 bulls.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm collided with the Third Prince\u2019s Brute Cattle Fist.Boom!This was a neck-to-neck matchup.Zhang Ruochen fixed his sleeves and said, \u201cThis is the strength of a warrior at the Mid Stage Black Realm?\u201d\u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dThe Sacred Mark on the Third Prince\u2019s glabella suddenly brightened. He activated his Genuine Qi and injected it into his blood. A reddish Spiritual Blood came out and surrounded his body like a rainbow.Power of Rainbow-like Animal Spirits.Only warriors at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm would be able to do that. The deeper the color of the rainbow ring, the stronger the warrior was.However, the Third Prince\u2019s rainbow ring was rather light which meant that he had just reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.The signal of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm was Boiling Animal Spirits.The signal of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm was Power of Rainbow-like Animal Spirits.Last but not least, the signal of the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm was Soaring Animal Spirits.The power of the Third Prince had doubled since he\u2019d activated the Spiritual Blood. Every fist he dashed out was equal to the strength of 100 bulls, the 10th level of the Brute Bull Fist.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoom!The Third Prince had shaken Zhang Ruochen fiercely with one mere fist.\u201cAnd this is the strength of the genius of the Yellow Board?\u201dThe Third Prince laughed wildly. He kicked up his heel like a brute cattle and dashed out another 18 fists towards Zhang Ruochen.Every fist made Zhang Ruochen retreat a step back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moreover, the Third Prince is comparatively weaker among those at the Black Realm.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen thought to himself.With each fist strike he received from the Third Prince, part of the force would be passed to the ground through his bones and meridians.Therefore, even if the Third Prince could display the strength of 100 bulls, he still could not hurt Zhang Ruochen.If the Third Prince\u2019s opponent was someone other than Zhang Ruochen, the Full Stage Warrior at the Yellow Realm would probably be squashed to death with one strike.\u201cAlthough the Third Prince is an idiot, his cultivation is still strong. It seems that Zhang Ruochen is going to lose,\u201d said Lin Ningshan.Lin Chenyu shook his head in disagreement and said, \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. The cultivation of Zhang Ruochen is powerful beyond imagination. The Third Prince won\u2019t be able to defeat him.\u201dLin Ningshan was confused. \u201cWhy? Zhang Ruochen is beaten up to the point where he can only fall back into retreat. He didn\u2019t even have a chance to fight back.\u201dLin Chenyu pointed his finger toward the ground and said, \u201cLook carefully. Look at the ground where Zhang Ruochen has stamped his feet on.\u201dFollowing the direction of his finger, Lin Ningshan looked down at the ground. She noticed that slate of the ground sunk a little after each step Zhang Ruochan had made, leaving a shallow footprint on the ground. If she had not observed carefully, she would not have noticed it.\u201cHe defuses the Third Prince\u2019s power into the earth.\u201d Lin Ningshan was amazed and added on, \u201cHow can he do that?\u201d\u201cZhang Ruochen has excellent control of his own power. No matter how powerful the Third Prince is, he won\u2019t be able to defeat Zhang Ruochen. If the foolish Third Prince didn\u2019t challenge him, we\u2019d never know the true strength of Zhang Ruochen,\u201d said Lin Chenyu.\u201cIf we want to hire an assassin to kill him, I guess we\u2019ll need to double up on the bounty.\u201dLin Chenyu grinned slightly.Besides Lin Chenyu, only General Huo Si, whose cultivation had reached the Earth Realm, could discern Zhang Ruochen\u2019s true strength. He could not help but nod his head in acknowledgement. Zhang Ruochen was indeed a genius of martial arts.Ninth Commandery Princess was very worried about Zhang Ruochen. She said, \u201cNinth brother, don\u2019t use brute force to fight with him. Take this sword!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess threw the sword in her hand to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen was thinking about fighting the Third Prince in order to practice his palm techniques.Since the Ninth Commandery Princess had thrown him a sword, he naturally caught it and said, \u201cWell\u2026 let\u2019s finish it quickly.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dHolding the hilt, Zhang Ruochen flicked his wrist and displayed a series of gorgeous sword techniques. A dazzling sword radiance could be seen whenever the sword sliced through the air, unfolding a beautiful arc before everyone\u2019s eyes.He swung his sword forward. The sharp end of his sword pointed at the Third Prince\u2019s neck.He subdued the Third Prince in one stroke.The Third Prince\u2019s fist paused in midair, and he did not dare move in the slightest. If he made a wrong move, his neck would be sliced open by the sword instantly.Everybody in the arena was stunned by the scene before them. They could not have been more shocked.Why did the Third Prince lose? He obviously had the upper hand throughout the fight. The Ninth Prince was even pushed back into retreat!\u201cIt was my ninth brother who didn\u2019t unleash his full power. Otherwise, he could easily defeat my third brother from the very beginning.\u201d The Young Commandery Princess said with her hands clasped behind her back. Her big bright eyes were shining, showing her admiration toward Zhang Ruochen.Other princes and princesses belatedly realized that the Ninth Prince was playing with the Third Prince all along.\u201cIndeed, the Ninth Prince is a martial arts genius! He has only reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm and yet, he can defeat a Mid-Stage Warrior at the Black Realm. I can\u2019t imagine how powerful he will be after breaking through the Black Realm!\u201d\u201cIt is said that the power of the Yellow Realm is 100 bulls. I wonder if the Ninth Prince has reached the legendary Power of Realm?\u201d\u201cEven if he hasn\u2019t reached that realm, I would say he\u2019s not far from it.\u201d\u2026The Third Prince was fuming with rage as well as humiliation when he heard people complimenting the Ninth Prince.He was looking forward to obtain a sense of achievement by defeating the Ninth Prince. But unexpectedly, he was easily defeated with a single sword stroke.What a great shame!\u201cI am not convinced! Ninth brother, let\u2019s have another battle!\u201d The Third Prince attributed his failure to his own negligence.\u201cNo more fighting. Does it really matter who wins or loses?\u201dHaving said that, Zhang Ruochen then turned away from the Third Prince, walked toward the Ninth Commandery Princess and returned the sword to her. The Third Prince was left standing like a fool.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier that you could win the third brother?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said angrily and gave Zhang a sideways glance. \u201cI was quite worried about you.\u201d\u201cA guaranteed win? There is no such thing in this world.\u201d Zhang Ruochen chuckled while shaking his head and said.A twinge of displeasure ran through Lin Ningshan\u2019s heart after she saw how intimate Zhang Ruochen and the Ninth Commandery Princess were. She took her sword, strode toward the Ninth Commandery Princess and said slowly, \u201cNinth Princess, I heard that you\u2019ve reached the Realm of Sword Following the Mind. I suddenly feel an itch to have a go. Let\u2019s compete our sword techniques. How about that?\u201d\u201cOkay! I have been waiting for this opportunity for some time. Since we\u2019re already here at the Royal Coliseum, let\u2019s do a battle!\u201d said the Ninth Commandery Princess. A hint of war intent appeared in her eyes.The Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan were known as the Two Beauties in the Yunwu City. But, the Ninth Commandery Princess had lost to Lin Ningshan in the Year-end Assessment. Obviously, she was not convinced of her loss. Since then, she had always wanted to fight again and defeat Lin Ningshan.\u201cBlue Water Listening to the Sea.\u201dThe first to launch an attack was the Ninth Commandery Princess. The moment her sword was swung, a ferocious wave of air was swept up, sweeping toward Lin Ningshan wave after wave.\u201cClank!\u201dRumbling sounds rang out in the air. Her sword waves resembled the surging tidewater, as if they were actually beating against the shore.After the Ninth Commandery Princess had reached the initial realm of Sword Following the Mind, the sophistication of her sword techniques had also reached a new height. Compared to her performance in the Year-end Assessment, she had greatly improved in terms of accuracy and precision.Lin Ningshan stood still and did not move an inch. Her glittering red lips revealed a disdainful smile.\u201cSwish!\u201dLin charged forward with her sword. A powerful wave of icing cold Sword Breath emitted from the sword tip, blocking all sword techniques unleashed by the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cLet your sword go!\u201dLin Ningshan let out a low growl and slapped her sword down onto the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019 wrist.The blow left a bruise on the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019 wrist. She no longer had any energy to hold onto her sword. The sword was sent flying off to the side and clattered down onto the ground.There was a blood mark on her wrist. She staggered a few steps backward as the pain spread through every part of her body. Enraged, she clenched her teeth tightly and said, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dLin Ningshan pulled her Splendor Sword back in a graceful manner. Faking a gasp, she said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the Ninth Commandery Princess a God\u2019s favored daughter? You can\u2019t even hold a sword! I guess the gap between our cultivation is getting bigger and bigger! Aw!\u201d\u201cLin Ningshan! Don\u2019t you dare humiliate me on purpose!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess was irritated. Her face flushed red with shame.The truth was both Lin Ningshan and Zhang Yuxi were regarded as the God\u2019s favored daughter. Being defeated in a single, effortless swipe of Lin Ningshan\u2019s sword had obviously crushed her pride.\u201cI don\u2019t dare,\u201d said Lin Ningshan, laughing, \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect your sword technique would be so bad.\u201dZhang Ruochen picked up the sword from the ground and went to the side of the Ninth Commandery Princess, \u201cLin Ningshan, your cultivation has reached the Final State of the Yellow Realm, which is one realm higher than my ninth sister. Do you think by defeating her can prove that you\u2019re better than her? You\u2019re too immature!\u201dLin Ningshan\u2019s face turned gloomy upon hearing his words. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m being childish? Everyone can see that I\u2019ve defeated the Ninth Commandery Princess with just one sword strike! Her capability was never worth comparing to mine.\u201dLin Ningshan held her head up high like an arrogant white swan.The Ninth Commandery Princess almost burst into tears seeing how Lin Ningshan behaved. She felt extremely resentful, but she could not do anything about it as she was indeed not her opponent.Zhang Ruochen stared at Lin Ningshan and said, \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s fight again after one month. If you can defeat my ninth sister by then, I\u2019ll apologize for what I said earlier.\u201dHis words took the Ninth Commandery Princess by surprise. She looked at Zhang Ruochen and shook her head in disagreement.What if she lost to Lin Ningshan again after a month? Her ninth brother would have to apologize to the disgraceful woman!Lin Ningshan was overjoyed hearing what Zhang Ruochen had proposed. She quickly agreed to the challenge and said, \u201cFine! Zhang Ruochen, mark your words! I am looking forward to hearing an apology from a martial art genius.\u201d\u201cIf you lose, you\u2019ll have to apologize to my sister in front of everyone,\u201d Zhang Ruochen added.\u201cDeal.\u201d Lin Ningshan had great confidence in herself and thus, she agreed without hesitation.Lin Ningshan had been humiliated by Zhang Ruochen in the Year-end Assessment and thus, she hated him so much.If she defeated the Ninth Commandery Princess after a month, she definitely would not go easy on Zhang Ruochen.\u201cAn apology?\u201d\u201cZhang Ruochen, you\u2019re too naive!\u201dSuddenly, she realized that humiliating Zhang Ruochen would be much more exciting than killing him.Then, Lin Ningshan and Lin Chenyu left the Royal Coliseum.Lin Chenyu spoke while leaving the Coliseum, \u201cZhang Ruochen is not as naive as he seems. He must have possessed a certainty of success and hence, he proposed the fight. Ningshan, you better be careful!\u201d\u201cMy brother, stop overthinking. The Qi Accumulating Liquid you brought back from Yuntai Suzerain is going to help my cultivation. I\u2019m sure I can practice till the peak of the Final State after one month. By then, I\u2019ll be much stronger than the Ninth Commandery Princess and our gap will only get bigger.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Chenyu nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that the Qi Accumulating Liquid will boost your cultivation significantly. Work hard then, my sister. Try your best to reach the Completion of the Yellow Realm as soon as possible. I\u2019ll then give you a Dark Blood Pill which will accelerate your progress, so that you can break through the Black Realm quickly.\u201d\u201cThe Black Realm!\u201d Lin Ningshan could not hide the smile on her face.Lin Chenyu added, \u201cWhen you reach the Black Realm, it\u2019s going to be easier for you to enroll into the Yuntai Suzerain. With your talent, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The Ninth Commandery Princess is just a stepping-stone on your way to success. As for Zhang Ruochen, he will die going against the Queen! Haha!\u201dLin Ningshan\u2019s eyes shone with a strange light. She appeared to be very excited, obviously looking forward to the match next month.Her lips curled up into a charming smile as she imagined Zhang Ruochen\u2019s apology.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn\u201cMy ninth brother, I\u2019ve heard that Lin Chenyu brought back a great deal of Qi Accumulating Liquid from Yuntai Suzerain in order to raise their young warriors\u2019 power and attack the Seventh-class Family. That\u2019s why Lin Ningshan could reach the Yellow Realm in such short period,\u201d said Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cI have no hope to win against her in next month since she has the help of that liquid. Brother, you had made a rash decision.\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head and said, \u201cNinth sister, don\u2019t you trust me? Have you forgotten that I leveled up to the Completion of Yellow Realm in half a year?\u201d\u201cYes! What had happened to you, my brother?\u201d Ninth Commandery Princess felt regretful when she finished her question, \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t have to tell me, that\u2019s your secret after all.\u201dAfter these last days\u2019 contact, Zhang Ruochen thought the Ninth Commandery Princess was reliable. To tell her some secrets would be okay.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cOf course practice resources are important. However, the practical skills are indispensable. You are practicing \u2018Ice Formula\u2019, a Inferior-class of Spiritual exercise, right?\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess nodded.There were three Spiritual Stage Exercises in the Royal Family: \u201cIce Formula\u201d, \u201cGod of War Tactics\u201d and \u201cInnate Skills\u201d.\u201cIce Formula\u201d and \u201cGod of War Tactics\u201d belonged to the low-class of Spiritual; \u201cInnate skills\u201d was a mid-class Spiritual Stage exercise.Generally speaking, in the Royal Family, only princes and princesses who had opened the Sacred Mark before five years old could practice \u201cInnate skills\u201d.In other words, only Royal Family members who practiced \u201cInnate skills\u201d could rival for the emperor crown. The earliest one who practiced \u201cInnate skills\u201d was the Seventh Prince and later he got other favorable turns in life and better practice skills.At the age of six, the Ninth Commandery Princess unlocked her Sacred Mark so that she had to choose \u201cIce Formula\u201d as practice skill.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cAs a low-class of Spiritual exercise, Ice Formula will only help you open 16 meridians even if you practice to the Completion of Yellow Realm.\u201dNinth Commandery Princess rolled her eyes to Zhang Ruochen as she said, \u201cWhy do you despise the exercises of low-class Spiritual? Do you know in Yunwu Commandery, there are less than 10 intact books about Spiritual Stage Exercises, and three of them possessed by our Royal Family? It is quite amazing.\u201d\u201cMoreover, a low-class Spiritual exercise book costs about a million, even five million silver coins. A classic book like \u2018Ice Formula\u2019 would cost three million silver coins at a market.\u201dIn Yunwu Commandery, only two seventh-class families and one seventh-class suzerain possessed an exercise book of the low-class Spiritual separately. As to the eighth-class families or suzerains, they merely had fragments of the Spiritual Stage or Superior Class books of Human Stage.Zhang Ruochen smiled and said, \u201cIf you can keep my secret, I shall give you an Inferior Class exercise of the Ghost Level.\u201d\u201cInferior Class of the Ghost\u2026Level\u2026\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess covered her mouth instantly after an exclamation.She was shocked greatly and stared at Zhang Ruochen with two widen eyes.After a long while, she calmed herself down and whispered, \u201cAn Inferior Class Exercise of the Ghost Level? My brother, where did you get this incredible book? It is said that even the most powerful exercise of the Yuntai Suzerain, \u2018Holy Universe Reaching Skills\u2019, just belongs to the Inferior Class of the Ghost Level.\u201dWhat Zhang Ruochen said was so amazing that even the Royal Family couldn\u2019t save him if it had been spread out. It certainly would attract scourges.The Ninth Commandery Princess didn\u2019t dare to desire the Inferior Class of the Ghost Level at all.Zhang Ruochen had even recited some exercise books of the King\u2019s Stage, let alone the Inferior Class Exercises of the Ghost Level.However, if Zhang Ruochen gave the Ninth Commandery Princess the exercises of the King\u2019s Stage, it would harm her rather than help.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cThe exercise that I\u2019m going to give you is\u00a0\u2018Tianhe Scripture\u2019.\u00a0It divides into seven levels. You can reach the Completion of the Yellow Realm if you finish its first level.\u201dZhang then wrote \u201cTianhe Scripture\u201d down and gave it to the Ninth Commandery Princess.She handed it over the instant she began to read it and got completely attracted by it.It took her six hours to keep \u201cTianhe Scripture\u201d in mind.\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s an Inferior Class Exercise of the Ghost Level! Whoever could finish it, he or she would be terribly strong.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess lifted her delicate head up with a pair of bright eyes. She desired to kiss Zhang Ruochen.Reading out what the Ninth Commandery Princess was thinking, Zhang Ruochen cleared his throat as he said, \u201cNinth sister, never tell others! It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I won\u2019t tell anybody even my parents,\u201d said the Ninth Commandery Princess.Finishing it, the Ninth Commandery Princess walked to the candlestick and burnt \u201cTianhe Scripture\u201d to ash.\u201cNow, if you can turn your exercises to \u2018Tianhe Scripture\u2019, the Genuine Qi in your body will soar massively, which may help you to reach the Final State of the Yellow Realm. One month later, you should have 90 percent chance to win Lin Ningshan,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.The higher class the exercises was, the stronger his Genuine Qi and combat power of a warrior were.Just like Zhang Ruochen, who had just reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, could defeat the third prince, who reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. It was possible because Zhang Ruochen had practiced \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d.The Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s confidence had been increased greatly. She smiled at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cNinth brother, I don\u2019t know how to express my gratitude for your giving me \u2018Tianhe Scripture\u2019.\u201d\u201cAhem! As brother and sister, we don\u2019t have to say thanks. But you\u2019d better practice it as soon as possible.\u201d Zhang Ruochen turned around and looked out of the window.The Ninth Commandery Princess hummed and said, \u201cIf you were not my brother, I would marry you.\u201dBut she read out some unnatural expressions on Zhang\u2019s face. Soon afterward, she managed to leave his residence and seclude herself for refining.She knew that her combat with Lin Ningshan was important and she could not lose.After she had gone, Zhang Ruochen entered into the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel to practice.After his cultivation had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, his Qi Pool decoupled and shaped into a giant Qi Pool space, which could contain more Genuine Qi.However, his Genuine Qi now merely accounted for 20 percent of the Qi Pool.Only he had practiced the Genuine Qi completely could he dash to the Black Realm.It would take more than two years for an ordinary warrior who had reached the completion of the Yellow realm to fill the Qi pool fully, with the help of a spiritual crystal.Liu Chengfeng, another genius, who had reached the Completion of Yellow Realm at 17 years old spent three years practicing the Black Realm unsuccessfully.It followed that it was not easy to break to the Black Realm.Even Zhang Ruochen had opened 36 meridians and practiced faster than other warriors, it also would take a whole year to fill his Qi pool.One year was too long.He couldn\u2019t wait, thus he had spent a high price at the polls which could augment his genuine Qi to help his cultivation.The Second-class bill, a Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill, cost 5,000 silver coins.A Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pill could only help to accelerate 20 percent of the filling.He took one and meanwhile used 36 meridians to absorb the pill spirit and turned it into the Genuine Qi.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s cultivation increased by leaps and bounds.Three days later, his Genuine Qi amounted to two fifths, which could break out the power of 94 bulls.Another five days had been passed, his Genuine Qi amounted to three fifths, which could break out the power of 96 bulls.Seven days later, his Genuine Qi amounted to four-fifths, which could break out the power of 98 bulls.His Qi Pool almost had been filled after another 10 days\u2019 practice. Zhang Ruochen could raise 99 bulls\u2019 power; only one ball short of the power of Yellow Realm.Blackie saw the whole process and said, \u201cWhat a pity. Short of Strength of a bull to the Yellow Ultimate Realm.\u201dIf the Completion had the eighth small realm, it would be the \u201cUltimate Realm\u201d.The Ultimate Realm meant unparalleled.The power of 100 bulls was the Ultimate Realm of Yellow Realm.Only young Gods in ancient times could practice to the Ultimate Realm.Since then nobody could reach it even those great emperors, or any lord or Saint who could be close to it.There was a huge difference between reaching it and closing to it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLike Zhang Ruochen now, who seemed to be just short of one bull to the Ultimate Realm.It was a world of difference!That\u2019s why Blackie signed,\u00a0\u201cIf you had reached the Ultimate Realm, you could have attracted echoes from ancient gods, which would be amazing!\u201d\u201cMaybe I still have a chance to reach the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm!\u201d said Zhang Ruochen firmly because he had great faith in himself.Blackie shook his head and said, \u201cYour Qi Pool has been filled, no space for further promotion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It said, \u201cYes! I forgot that there is a martial technique that can increase one\u2019s power. Why did you practice only one martial technique of mid-class Human Stage until now? If the martial technique that you\u2019d practiced was low-class of Spiritual, you could break out 100 bulls\u2019 power.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need a low-class of Spiritual. A Superior-class of Human Stage is enough, which would help me to break out 100 bulls power and reach the Ultimate Realm of Yellow Realm,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.It was odd that somebody opened 36 meridians but still hadn\u2019t reached the Ultimate Realm.Only by practicing martial techniques, exercises and the body of Martial Arts together, one could break out his most powerful power. Any absence would not lead to the Ultimate Realm.As for Zhang Ruochen, he had already reached the Yellow Realm in both exercises and the body of Martial Arts, but his martial techniques were still weak as he practiced Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm merely to the level two, which just belonged to the mid-class martial techniques.The main role of Sacred Sword Skill was the sword, not the man that mattered to the practice of the low-class Spiritual martial technique.If Zhang could successfully practice Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm to level three, \u2018Dragon and Elephant Returning to Earth\u2019, it could be an easy thing for him to add the strength of a bull that he required.The latter stages of Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm would be difficult to practice undoubtedly. For instance, Zhang had practiced three level three \u2018Dragon and Elephant Returning to Earth\u2019 for many days but still couldn\u2019t make any progress.\u201cI require combat experience and in the royal palace, I can\u2019t find others to practice my palm with.\u201d\u201cThus, because of a lack of practice, I haven\u2019t managed to reach the third level successfully.\u201d\u201cIf I leave here and exercise myself outside, I would lose the protection of the Yunwu Commandery Prince and the Queen would attempt to have me assassinated. Bingo!\u2026 I don\u2019t have to go out!\u201dKing Mount came to his mind.The Royal Family reared many savage beasts in King Mount and most of them were first and second level savage beasts. Zhang could fight with them.He hoped to practice the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm successfully as soon as possible, after that he could fight with savage beasts.Zhang Ruochen had practiced in the internal space of Time and Space Spinel for 25 days, which equaled to eight or nine days outside.He walked outside and saw Yun waiting for him.\u201cYour Highness, Le has been recovered, including his arms and foot. But he still looks dull, just sitting on the stone stairs or drawing pictures on the ground for the whole day,\u201d said Yun.Zhang Ruochen sighed and said with pity, \u201cGive him two hundred silver coins and send him away. Whether he could get out of this dilemma or not depends on himself, and nobody can help.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m going to send him out,\u201d Yun said.Seeing Yun\u2019s departure, Zhang Ruochen fell into meditation and he stopped Yun, \u201cWait, I want to see him once more.\u201dYun showed a hint of joy and nodded, leading Zhang Ruochen to Le\u2019s residence.Like Yun\u2019s description, Le was sitting on the stairs and drawing the picture of Lin Ningshan on the ground.Repeatedly.However, his eyes were empty and he was just drawing instinctively.He didn\u2019t even realize Zhang\u2019s approach.Zhang Ruochen looked at this young man and asked,\u00a0\u201cWhere is your sword?\u201dLe sat still and mumbled, \u201cMy meridians are all broken and I have no power to lift a sword.\u201d\u201cSo you are broken too?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d Le answered slackly.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cBut you have the power to draw these pictures? If you possess an aggressive heart, you must succeed. But now you are degenerating yourself.\u201dLe bit his lip tightly and said, \u201cI\u2019m not degenerating myself, I\u2019m not!\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at the pictures on the ground, \u201cYou turned yourself into a waste for this cruel woman. Guess I overestimated you.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked over to the steps and destroyed Lin Ningshan\u2019s drawings with his foot.Le cried with a pair of big red eyes,\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d\u201cShe did not treat you as a man, why do you see her as a Goddess? Are you not better than crap?\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t saved my life twice, I would have killed you.\u201d\u00a0said Le.Zhang Ruochen laughed, \u201cYou piece of crap couldn\u2019t kill me even if you practiced for 10 years, hahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cI AM NOT A CRAP!\u201dLe howled loudly and the Genuine Qi rushed to his hand so that he could handle a bamboo stick, stabbing at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart.His Genuine Qi made the soft stick sharper than an iron sword.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen reacted with one palm.Blasted away in the air, Le spat some blood and then fell down on the ground with the broken stick.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cNow that I\u2019ve beaten you to death and humiliated you. Do you still treat me as your lifesaver?\u201d\u201cAwoo!\u201dHowling like a wolf, Le stood up from the ground with two red eyes. He ran to Zhang Ruochen again and aimed at his neck.With his hand as a sword, Zhang Ruochen chopped Le\u2019s neck and beated him into the air again.\u201cBang bang!\u201dLe became more and more crazy, he attacked Zhang Ruochen again and again with stronger power.However everytime it was he who beaten away by Zhang Ruochen, he could not touch Zhang Ruochen even a little.Standing far away, Yun was very worried but she didn\u2019t do anything.She knew that Zhang Ruochen was trying to beat Le to an awakening.An hour later, Le fell down on the ground and gasped again and again.Zhang Ruochen walked over and planned to punch him once more.\u201cStop!\u201d cried Le.Zhang Ruochen turned happy and withdrew his fist as he said, \u201cYou choose to be a waste still?\u201dLe shook his head and said, \u201cI am a swordsman, by no means am I crap. Honestly speaking, I was clear when your first punch landed, thank you.\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me. It is your own that leads you out from the shadows.\u201dZhang Ruochen helped Le to stand up and smiled,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s your next plan?\u201dLe answered sadly, \u201cMy meridians have all been broken. Currently, I am doomed not to be able to step into the Black Realm. However, I don\u2019t want to give up, I\u2019ll search for Spiritual Dose which can reconnect my meridians.\u201dZhang Ruochen reflected a while and said, \u201cBroken meridians are not necessarily a bad thing for you. I have a roll of special exercises, which common people can\u2019t practice but broken-meridian man can. You may successfully practice these exercises with a strong will.\u201dSuddenly Le\u2019s eyes flashed with light and he asked, \u201cWhat if I do successfully?\u201d If Zhang Ruochen hadn\u2019t told him this news, he might have had no hope.\u201cLike cocoons into butterflies! You might have a bright future,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Falling on one knee, Le said emotionally, \u201cPlease accept my gratitude.\u201dAfter that, Le said firmly, \u201cI now owe you three lives if someday you need my assistance\u2026 I won\u2019t hesitate.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and passed \u2018Nonuple Samsara Magic formula\u2019 to Le directly.Nonuple Samsara Magic formula\u00a0was frighteningly stronger than the\u00a0Tianhe Scripture\u00a0which was given to the Ninth Commandery Princess. But Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t worry about whether or not Le would let it out.Le immediately secluded himself to refine Nonuple Samsara Magic formula and Deaths\u201d Yun took care of his daily life.It was time for Zhang Ruochen to head to King Mount to practice Dragon and Elephant Returning to Earth.Accompanying Zhang Ruochen, General Ge Qian went to King Mount as well in order to protect Zhang Ruochen from any assassination attempts.Zhang Ruochen entered an impenetrable jungle, heading directly towards the first-level-superior-class savage beasts.A common savage beast was no threat to him, and only the superior class savage beasts could be his opponents.Half a day had passed, Zhang Ruochen encountered the first superior class savage beast, Thunderstorm Leopard.Thunderstorm leopard was rather ferocious among the superior class savage beasts and had the power to kill a Yellow Realm warrior.\u201cBoom!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen slapped it to death.Zhang Ruochen was unsatisfied seeing the body,\u00a0\u201cThey are too weak to practice my palm techniques, I have to search a second-level savage beast.\u201dHe walked deeper into King Mount.General Ge Qian hid far away and saw Zhang Ruochen killing the Thunderstorm Leopard,\u00a0\u201cThe ninth prince is so powerful! I was over-worried about his life.

If a Mid-Stage Black Realm warrior was to run into one, it would essentially be a death sentence.Other than Zhang Ruochen, if any other warrior at the Completion of the Yellow Realm had run into the Silver Draong-lion, even if they formed an elite team of 20, they would still be wiped out.\u201cAo!\u201dThe Silver Dragon-lion roared loudly and the sound waves from its mouth became a devastating hurricane. On the ground, dust and rocks flew up, while the surrounding trees were blown crooked, and all the leaves fell down leaving behind only stripped branches.With only a loud roar, it could shock all warriors below the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm into a dead faint.The Silver Dragon-lion was four meters tall and six meters long. Compared to a normal lion, it was many times larger. It was just like a small silver mountain standing in front of Zhang Ruochen.Its pair of silver lion eyes were as big as Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head, and they were emitting a bloodthirsty aura!\u201cBoom!\u201dEach step it made upon the ground made the earth shake slightly.Zhang Ruochen rose onto his toes and leaped up, landing on the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s back. Gathering his Genuine Qi, he aimed a strike at its head.The Silver Dragon-lion, who was very intelligent, instantly realized the danger it was in.Thus, pushing off with all four hooves at the same time, it surged forward, achieving speeds of 30 meters per second, astonishingly fast.Caught off guard, Zhang Ruochen lost his balance and fell off the beast\u2019s back.He struck out with one hand against the ground and instantly righted himself. He backed up until he was three meters away and stopped. However, he remained alert, both legs slightly bent with Genuine Qi collecting thickly in his palms.\u201cIt is indeed an adult Silver Dragon-lion whose speed has reached 30 meters per second.\u201dNormal warriors who had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm could reach speeds of 20 meters per second or so. Talented warriors who had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm could reach speeds of 22 meters per second.Even Zhang Ruochen could only reach speeds of 27 meters per second, an already incredible feat.30 meters per second and 27 meters per second didn\u2019t to be much different, but in reality, the difference was immense.If Zhang Ruochen and the Silver Dragon-lion were competing in a 100-meter race, by the time the Silver Dragon-lion had reached the end, Zhang Ruochen would still be a full 10 meters behind.Which was to say, if Zhang Ruochen\u2019s strength could not defeat the Silver Dragon-lion, then he would die for sure, as he would not even be able to escape.At this moment, Zhang Ruochen and the Silver Dragon-lion were three meters apart, but with the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s speed, it only needed a second to be right in front of Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen watched the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s every move carefully. Once the Silver Dragon-lion prepared to attack, he must strike first to have any hope of success.\u201cAo!\u201dThe Silver Dragon-lion roared. Turning into a silver blur it pounced towards Zhang Ruochen.Silver claws slashed through void space and emitted four sharp beams of power.Zhang Ruochen took a step to the side and dodged the attack.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s claw landed on a tree the thickness of a water barrel and tore a branch of it apart with bits of bark flying everywhere.The branch broke in the middle and crashed down.\u2018Elephant Galloping!\u2019Zhang Ruochen took this opportunity to strike. With all the power in his body, he struck at the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s abdomen and sent it flying.The Silver Dragon-lion was incensed. Clambering up from the ground, it went to attack Zhang Ruochen.But, Zhang Ruochen attacked first, another \u2018Elephant Galloping\u2019.The Silver Dragon-lion flew out once again.\u2018Elephant Galloping!\u2019\u2018Elephant Galloping!\u2019\u2026Zhang Ruochen attacked 12 times in succession, each time it sent the Silver Dragon-lion flying out. When Zhang Ruochen struck for the 13th time, the Silver Dragon-lion was finally wounded, with blood dripping out of its nostrils.The Silver Dragon-lion was finally angered!Its body began to emit a layer of silver light. Opening its mouth, it spewed forth a beam of silver light that flew towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart like a sword.\u201cOh no!\u201dZhang Ruochen pushed off with his legs and jumped over 10 meters into the air, landing on a branch of a thousand-year-old tree, and dodged the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s attack.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe silver light sword hit the place where Zhang Ruochen was standing on just before, making a cacophonous noise. On the ground, it left a crater with a diameter of one meter.\u201cDragon in the Sky.\u201dZhang Ruochen leaped down from the tree branch. All the Genuine Qi from his body surged through the 36 Meridians and focused toward his hands. He let out a deep, dragon-like roar.\u201cBang!\u201dOne hand struck the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s back, creating a sound of bones breaking and splintering. The Silver Dragon-lion let out a wail and fell heavily to the ground.Its spine had been broken by Zhang Ruochen with one strike. Heavily wounded, it lay on the ground, unable to even stand up.Zhang Ruochen was overjoyed. Using just the power in his body, he could heavily wound the Silver Dragon-lion.If he used the sword, he could probably kill the Silver Dragon-lion in just 10 strokes.\u201cAt my current strength, even if I am no match against warriors of the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, I can at least hold my own for a while.\u201dWith this battle against the Silver Dragon-lion, Zhang Ruochen could clearly feel that his control over the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm had become stronger.Zhang Ruochen drew out his Flash Shinning Sword and with one sweep, he slit the throat of the Silver Dragon-lion.Not long after, the Silver Dragon-lion completely died.After that, Zhang Ruochen made a foot long incision into the abdomen of the Silver Dragon-lion and withdrew a fist-sized piece of flesh.This piece of flesh was extremely hard and as heavy as iron. It emitted a silvery light and carried a light fragrance.It was like a Spiritual Dose rather than flesh.\u201cThe Silver Dragon-lion was worthy of being a second-level savage beast, as it was able to actually grow half a catty of Spiritual Brawn.\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen held the silver Spiritual Brawn in his hand, revealing the glimmer of a smile.Spiritual Brawn, was the most precious treasure inside a savage beast.If a warrior consumed Spiritual Brawn, it could increase the power in their bodies and cultivation Realms. If a normal person consumed the Spiritual Brawn, it could strengthen their physique and grant longevity.The half catty of Spiritual Brawn in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand, if taken to be sold at the Martial Market, could be at least sold for 3,000 silver coins.Furthermore, Spiritual Crystal Stones could often be found inside Spiritual Brawn.Even the lowest quality Spirital Brawn was worth 1,000 silver cions.For Zhang Ruochen, this piece of Spiritual Brawn was not very useful. He planned to take it home and give it to Concubine Lin to consume.As long as the Spiritual Brawn was stored within a jade container, even if it was stored for a month, the Spiritual Brawn would not rot or degrade in quality.To refine the Spatial Ring, Zhang Ruochen had purchased a number of jade containers. He took a jade box out from the Time and Space Spinel\u2019s internal storage and placed the Spiritual Brawn inside.There were treasures to be found all over the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s body. The skin, fur, blood, and bone could all be used in medicine, and be sold for a hefty price. However, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s main purpose of coming to King Mount was to practice Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, and so, he did not take the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019 body with him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNot long after Zhang Ruochen left, a group of soldiers wearing armor came to the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s body.General Ge Qian walked out from the group of soldiers, looked at the Silver Dragon-lion lying in a pool of blood, and said, \u201cHe is really strong that he even killed a Silver Dragon-lion. If he enters the Black Realm, who knows how powerful he will become? Let along His Majesty, even I am eager to see!\u201dThe royal guards beside him couldn\u2019t help but sigh, thinking it was unbelievable.It had never been heard of before, that a warrior who was at the Completion of the Yellow Realm could kill a Silver Dragon-lion. This kind of impossible thing was right now staring them in the face.General Ge Qian ordered and said, \u201cDo the same with the bodies of the previous savage beasts. Take the body of the Silver Dragon-lion home, deliver it to the Imperial Finance Department, and convert it to silver coins. Once the Ninth Prince has finished practicing, I will personally hand the coins over to him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had killed another two second-level savage beast and 17 superior-class level-one savage beasts.The second-level and first-level superior class savage beasts in King Mount had probably all been killed by Zhang Ruochen.It seemed that the low-level savage beasts in King Mount knew a killing star had arrived. Once they saw Zhang Ruochen, they all ran away instantly as if they saw a monster demon.\u201cClank!\u201dThere was a seven or eight meters wide river rushing down from the top of the peak and delivered a sound of water rumbling. By throwing a stone into the river, it hit the forceful water current and started rolling in the water.Zhang Ruochen arrived at the riverside. He looked at the rushing of water as if his heart was surging as well.After all the cultivation recently, Zhang Ruochen could feel clearly that he had reached the edge of breaking through the palm technique.\u201cPhhhf!\u201dHe dashed from the ground and jumped into the river. He made use of his powerful body so as to resist the force of the river.\u201cBoom!\u201dHis Genuine Qi had been activated. He unleashed a powerful palm out.The water in the river had stopped slightly because of his palm.Shortly after, the current turned fiercely toward Zhang Ruochen and threw him out. The forceful water flow had knocked out his bearings and threw him on the edge of the riverside.After spitting out a mouth of water, Zhang Ruochen jumped back to the river. He went against the current with different palm techniques in order to a make a way for himself.This time, he unleashed three palms consecutively. Again, he was thrown out by the water waves.Zhang Ruochen kept going upstream every time he was knocked down.Zhang Ruochen hadn\u2019t given up after being knocked down over and over again. The longer he practiced, the longer he could stay in the river.It had been a whole day since Zhang Ruochen had confronted the water. He was exhausted and his entire body was covered in wounds.After nightfall, he uncovered a piece of Spiritual Brawn from a cyan-eyed snake, a second-level savage beast. He ate the Spiritual Brawn, sat down and started meditating so as to absorb the Spiritual Qi which helped to recover his physical strength and energy.The next morning, the wounds on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body were all healed. His body was full of Genuine Qi and vitality. He then jumped back into the river and continued practicing.On the fifth day, there was a long cry from the river. \u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth\u201d.Zhang Ruochen unleashed both of his palms at the same time. A rushing palm force struck out hard and gave out a sound as if dragons and elephants were roaring together. Surprisingly, the water he smacked began to flow backward.\u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth\u201d, the third palm technique of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, cultivated successfully.Zhang Ruochen had exploded out with the strength of 100 bulls and reached the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm.At this moment, the Spiritual Qi in the entire Mount King had activated and gathered toward Zhang Ruochen. It turned into a white light beam and streaked toward the hundred miles tall void space.There were ancient illusory images displayed around the light beam. Some of them were in human and dragon figures, some were like wind and Kylin.Each of the illusory images was sacred. They demonstrated a sense of power as if they were the manifestation of gods.\u201cWe are the manifestation of Gods. Kneel.\u201dGeneral Ge Qian and a troop of royal guards all kneeled down and worshipped the illusory images of the gods devotedly from far away.Such a manifest of gods normally happened only when it came to a large-scale sacrifice.The illusory images of gods had appeared in Mount King and floated above the Ninth Prince\u2019s head. It was definitely a miracle for the entire Yunwu Commandery.\u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019ll arouse the chords of the gods when I reach the Ultimate Realm.\u201d Zhang Ruochen looked at the illusory image of gods in the sky with excitement.Finally, he made his first step on the path of being a powerful warrior.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe illusory images of gods had turned into light beams. They floated to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s glabella and chiseled into his Qi Pool.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe light beams exploded and displayed a white spiritual odor after plunging into Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Qi Pool.The Qi Pool had nearly burst because of the too much light beam. The blood in his body kept rolling and rolling.\u201cIn this case, let\u2019s break through to the Black Realm!\u201dZhang Ruochen surely would not let such a good opportunity go. He sat in the water, and quickly activated the 36 meridians in his body. He then absorbed the strength of gods and started breaking through the Black Realm.Zhang Ruochen had already reached the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm. On top of the help of the gods\u2019 spiritual power, it was no doubt that he would be able to break through to the Black Realm with no setbacks.After an hour, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Qi Pool shook heavily and cracked into breaches.\u201cBoom!\u201dHis Qi Pool smashed and had broken into pieces.Soon after, the broken pieces restructured at high speed and resolved to a much bigger Qi Pool.No\u2026 not Qi Pool.It should be called Qi Lake.Zhang Ruochen had successfully broken through the Black Realm. Therefore, the Qi Pool in his glabella turned into a Qi Lake. It had enlarged 100 times more than when he was at the Completion of the Yellow Realm.The marks of gods were stamped on the wall of his Qi Lake and displayed a gleam of spiritual splendor.Yet, the marks of gods looked so faint and vague that one would probably miss it without taking a closer look.Be mindful, Zhang Ruochen had just reached the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm and had drawn the Chord of Gods for the very first time. Therefore, having a vague mark of gods was seen as normal.It was said that if Zhang Ruochen could reach the Ultimate Realm of the Black Realm, he would be able to resonate the second time of the Chord of Gods. Hence, it would definitely deepen the marks of gods in his Qi Lake.The number of warriors who had cultivated to the Ultimate Realm was scattered after the ancient times. Only a small number of Saints and the great emperor with astonished talent had finished cultivating the Ultimate Realm and resonated the Chord of Gods when they were young.Yet, the Saint and the great emperor didn\u2019t expose many details about what had happened in their young age. It was impossible to record it in history books and thus no one knew any other details.It was no doubt magnificent for Zhang Ruochen to resonate the Chord of Gods after all these years. However, it was beyond the bounds of possibility to make it happen again. Not even the great emperor and Saint.The Ultimate Realm of the Black Realm was far more difficult to cultivate compared to the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm.Even though Zhang Ruochen had already reached the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm, he wasn\u2019t confident enough to break through the Ultimate Realm of the Black Realm.\u201cWreathed in the light of gods, shielded by the gods\u2026 Is this the Holy Light Spirit Lake in the ancient myth?\u201dIn Zhang Ruochen\u2019s last lifetime, Emperor Ming had once mentioned the Holy Light Spirit Lake.It was said that when Emperor Ming was young, he had resonated the Chord of Gods and received the safeguard of gods. His Qi Lake then turned into the Holy Light Spirit Lake.Once the Holy Light Spirit Lake had been cultivated, the Qi Lake would become tenacious. Even warriors of the Earth Realm would not be able to pierce up Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Qi Lake.Moreover, When Zhang Ruochen obtained the higher cultivation, the advantage of having the Holy Light Spirit Lake would be more obvious.Zhang Ruochen had spent the entire day and night to digest the power of the Chord of Gods.The Genuine Qi in the Qi Lake seemed to be filled up.In other words, Zhang Ruochen had reached the Peak of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. Soon after he would be able to break through the Mid-Stage of the Black Realm.\u201cThis is certainly a Holy Light Spirit Lake. Compared to the warriors at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, the capacity of my Qi Lake is 10 times more and the purity of my Genuine Qi is far better. I guess it\u2019s more or less the same as warriors at the Completion of the Black Realm.\u201dThe capacity of the Qi Pool of an ordinary warrior would enlarge 10 times by breaking through from the Completion of the Yellow Realm to the Initial Stage of the Black Realm.Since Zhang Ruochen had cultivated the Ultimate Realm which was one realm higher than ordinary warriors, the capacity of his Qi Pool had enlarged twice.Therefore, compared to the warriors at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, the capacity of his Qi Lake was 10 times more.While Zhang Ruochen was breaking through the realm in the water, General Ge Qian rushed back to the Royal Palace and wanted to report to the Commandery Prince Yunwu the good news.\u201cI have something important to report to His Majesty. Eunuch Cao, please help to inform the Commandery Prince.\u201d Ge Qian looked urgent and said.Eunuch Cao was allied with the Queen. Knowing Ge Qian was responsible for protecting the Ninth Prince, he would no doubt ignore Ge Qian. \u201cHis Majesty is resting at the moment. I\u2019m afraid he will not be able to see you, my general. Please head back to your station and protect the Ninth Prince.\u201dGe Qian stared at Eunuch Cao angrily and said, \u201cCao Shiren, you\u2019d better go inform His Majesty now! If anything happens because of your delay, you\u2019ll surely be dead!\u201dEunuch Cao was known as a warrior at the Dawn State of the Black Realm. Although he wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight against Ge Qian, he wasn\u2019t afraid of confronting Ge Qian.At the same time, the voice of the Commandery Prince Yunwu broke out. He said, \u201cWho\u2019s making so much noise?\u201dEunuch Cao stared at Ge Qian severely and whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s see how you settle for disturbing His Majesty!\u201dGe Qian didn\u2019t even look at Eunuch Cao but greeted towards the palace. He said, \u201cYour majesty, your servant Ge Qian has something vital to report.\u201dThe voice of the Commandery Prince Yunwu broke out to the palace and he said, \u201cGe Qian, aren\u2019t you protecting the Ninth Prince? What\u2019s more important than protecting my son? Or have you encountered another assassin who attempts to kill the Ninth Prince?\u201d\u201cMore important than all of these!\u201d Ge Qian exclaimed and said.It seemed that the Commandery Prince Yunwu had noticed something had happened. He called in Ge Qian right away.Hearing what Ge Qian had said, Eunuch Cao changed his face. He followed Ge Qian and entered the palace.Ge Qian glanced slightly at Eunuch Cao and said, \u201cYour Majesty, what I\u2019m about to report is exceptionally important. I can only tell you, Your Majesty, not anyone else.\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu sat on the top part of the palace holding a golden booklet. He frowned his eyebrows and took a quick glance at Ge Qian, \u201cDismiss everyone. I need some privacy with the General!\u201dEunuch Cao was not willing to leave the palace. Yet, he dared not to disobey the order of the Commandery Prince Yunwu and left the palace instantly.The Commandery Prince Yunwu asked, \u201cGe Qian, you can tell me now. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dGe Qian kneeled down single legged and reported to the Commandery Prince Yunwu what he saw in Mount King without missing any details.\u201cThe Chord of Gods!\u201dHearing this, the Commandery Prince Yunwu couldn\u2019t stay calm anymore. His whole body shivered and stood up all of a sudden.Ge Qian nodded and said, \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure the Ninth Prince has reached the Ultimate Realm like what the myth describes and thus resonate the Chord of Gods.\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu\u2019s countenance kept changing. Having noticed how vital the news was, he asked, \u201cDoes anyone else know about it?\u201dGe Qian answered, \u201cOther than myself, the 10 royal guards who were stationed there with me also notice it.\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu said, \u201cThe Chord of Gods is a tremendous thing. This news has to be completely secret. Ge Qian, what should we do about the 10 people who know about the Ninth Prince?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn other words, what the Commandery Prince Yunwu meant was how to handle Ge Qian.Ge Qian clearly understood how things worked and thought for a moment. There was a sense of determination in his eyes. He said, \u201cKilled!\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu nodded and said, \u201cGe Qian, I know you\u2019ve always been a loyal general. Yet, if the news about my son leaks out, all assassins will no doubt get him killed! Why don\u2019t you and the other 10 royal guards watch over the ancestor temple at Mount Emperor and never come back? In this case, my son, you, and the 10 guards will all be safe.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d Ge Qian answered.Then, the Commandery Prince Yunwu and Ge Qian rushed to Mount King. They wanted to make sure if the Ninth Prince had truly resonated the Chord of Gods.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he turned in the air and landed on the riverside.The white Genuine Qi spewed out from his pores, drying up his wet clothes in a second.Having reached the Black Realm, he was able to drizzle Genuine Qi as the Genuine Qi in his body was so solid, or turned the Genuine Qi into a Qi sword and killed people through the air.Zhang Ruochen activated the Genuine Qi in his body and transferred it to the Meridians on his right hand. A gleam of white gas had gathered at the fingertip of his index finger. He dashed toward the Iron Pine 10 meters away.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe white Qi sword had broken the tree trunk of the Iron Pine and left a fist-sized hole.\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly average Sword Breath with such massive power! No doubt it\u2019s incomparable between warriors at the Black Realm and the Yellow Realm. If I cultivate the \u201cSword Ripple of Ten Channels\u201d, a martial technique of the superior class at the Spiritual Stage and put the Qi sword in use, I wonder how powerful it\u2019s going to be.\u201dIn Zhang Ruochen\u2019s last lifetime, he had cultivated the Sword Ripple of Ten Channels. He had turned all his 10 fingers into swords. With a random point, he would be able to display a sharp Qi sword that could kill people 100 meters away.Yet, the Sword Ripple of Ten Channels was extremely hard to cultivate. Even though Zhang Ruochen had successfully cultivated it in his previous life, it\u2019s surely not an easy task to achieve that technique again.At this moment, he felt like someone was coming over, so he retrieved all the Genuine Qi back to his body.The Commandery Prince Yunwu walked toward Zhang Ruochen and glanced at him from head to toes. He nodded with satisfaction and asked, \u201cDid you break through to the Black Realm?\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t say much but nodded slightly.Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t have much affection toward the Commandery Prince Yunwu. Yet, he could feel how much the Commandery Prince Yunwu cared about him and thus he respected him a lot.The Commandery Prince Yunwu said, \u201cAttack me with your strongest power!\u201dZhang Ruochen took a quick glance at him and said, \u201cOkay!\u201dHaving reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, Zhang Ruochen was eager to test his ability and see how far it could go.Since he clearly knew that the Commandery Prince Yunwu would do whatever it took to protect him and would never hurt him, he was safe to display everything he had in front of the Commandery Prince Yunwu.\u201cSwish!\u201dZhang Ruochen exploded his speed to the highest point that it exceeded 10 meters per second. He unleashed a palm toward the Commandery Prince Yunwu\u2019s chest. \u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth\u201d.The palm he displayed was the strongest with gigantic power. The bones and muscles in his body had all given out the sound of dragons and elephants roaring together.The forceful palm wind forced the sand to flow in clouds.Even though Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm had unleashed on the Commandery Prince Yunwu, he neither moved an inch nor fought back.\u201cBoom!\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen had released the palm on the Commandery Prince Yunwu\u2019s body, a vigorous power exploded from the Commandery Prince Yunwu.Zhang Ruochen was thrown out far. The Spiritual Blood in his body kept rolling and he fell to the ground in an awkward position. He couldn\u2019t help but retreat 10 steps back so as to dissipate the powerful force.The Commandery Prince Yunwu nodded and said, \u201cNot bad! The power of your palm is stronger than most of the warriors at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm. It\u2019s even more intense than some of the weaker warriors at the Dawn State of the Black Realm.\u201d\u201cMoreover, your biggest advantage is not your power, but your mastery of power and your sword technique which is the same as a warrior at the Earth Realm. All in all, I guess the warriors at the Dawn State of the Black Realm will not be able to defeat you. I guess you\u2019ve indeed cultivated the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to obtain such power!\u201dZhang Ruochen thought,\u00a0\u201cNo doubt that I startled the Commandery Prince Yunwu when I resonated the Chord of Gods.\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu looked at Zhang Ruochen with a softness in his eye. \u201cWith your talent, your achievement in the future will definitely be beyond me. Staying in the palace will only waste your talent and stop you from improving. You have two choices now if you want to keep boosting your martial arts cultivation.\u201d\u201cYour first choice, the Yuntai Suzerain. I guess you\u2019ve heard of it before?\u201dZhang Ruochen answered, \u201cThe Yuntai Suzerain is classified as a fourth-class suzerain that was established 720 years ago. They hold massive power and enjoy a particular superior status in the Western Nine Prefectures.\u201d Every princes, princesses, and child from the large-scale family of the commandery were all proud of being a member of the Yuntai Suzerain. The Yuntai Suzerain was known as the cradle of strong warriors. Almost half of the Heaven Realm warriors in the Western Nine Prefectures were the disciples of the Yuntai Suzerain.The Western Nine Prefectures referred to the nine commanderies of the Western Ridge. The Yunwu Commandery was one of them.The Commandery Prince Yunwu nodded and said, \u201cI once was the disciple of the Yuntai Suzerain. The vice chief of the external Yuntai Suzerain is a senior of the Royal Family in the Yunwu Commandery as well as an uncle of mine. If you decide to join the Yuntai Suzerain, I\u2019ll draft a letter to my uncle. I\u2019m sure you only need to demonstrate one-tenth of your talent in order to make it to the Yuntai Suzerain and become an external student of the suzerain.\u201dZhang Ruochen thought for a while and asked, \u201cHow about the second choice?\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu said, \u201cThe second choice is going to be relatively hard. If your talent is high enough and able to stand out among all the outstanding warriors, your achievement will be magnificent. Have you heard of the School of the Martial Market?\u201d\u201cYou mean the School of Martial Market operated by the Martial Market Bank?\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.The business of the Martial Market Bank had covered the entire Kunlun\u2019s Field. Every commandery, every city, and every town was related to the Martial Market Bank to a certain extent.The Martial Market in all the commanderies were controlled by the Martial Market Bank. It is a fact that the Martial Market Bank had control over 30% of the economic systems in the entire Kunlun\u2019s Field.The Martial Market Bank was more powerful than the Yuntai Suzerain to a large extent. It had passed on the power since the Medieval Ancient Times and was regarded as a \u201cMoney Empire\u201d. Not to mention the fourth-class Suzerain, even the first-class Suzerain didn\u2019t dare to confront the Martial Market Bank.With such massive prosperity, the Martial Market Bank surely required a tremendously strong force for protection.Therefore, the Martial Market Bank had established the Coliseum of the Martial Market and the School of the Martial Market.The School of the Martial Market aimed to foster more and more talent for the Martial Market Bank so that it could be powerful ever after and become the money dominator of the Kunlun\u2019s Field.The more outstanding the students were in the School of the Martial Market, the higher their status would be and more privileges they could enjoy after graduation.The huge benefit of joining the School of the Martial Market was, they were always wealthy and would never lack resources for cultivation. The Martial Market Bank was the most powerful backer for the school.Undoubtedly, it was extremely hard to get into the School of the Martial Market. It would only be more and more competitive each year so that a slight mistake would put the warriors to death.Zhang Ruochen clearly understood how powerful the Martial Market Bank was. The Martial Market in the Yunwu Commandery was only a small part of the whole. The headquarters of the Martial Market Bank was larger than the royal court of the First Central Empire, both of whom controlled the fate of the world.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cHas the Martial Market Bank set up a school in the Yunwu Commandery yet?\u201dThe Commandery Prince Yunwu shook his head slightly and said, \u201cNo. Not in the Yunwu Commandery but at the Omen Ridge. They\u2019ve established a one-star school and specially enroll the talented warriors from the 36 commanderies at the border of the Omen Ridge including the Western, the Eastern, the Southern and the Northern Nine Prefectures.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded with consent and said, \u201cOkay! I\u2019ll join the School of the Martial Market!\u201dIt would probably be less competitive for Zhang Ruochen to join the Yuntai Suzerain, and easier for him to cultivate. Yet, the potential of the Yuntai Suzerain was far less than the School of the Martial Market.As far as Zhang Ruochen concerned, he was worried that it would not be competitive enough.In terms of the Commandery Prince Yunwu, he was satisfied with Zhang Ruochen\u2019s decision. He said, \u201cWhen you become a senior of the Martial Market Bank in the future, the Yunwu Commandery will also benefit. There\u2019s one more month until the enrollment day of the School of the Martial Market. You should keep your mind on enhancing the solidity of your realm during this period of time. When it\u2019s about time, I\u2019ll arrange the guards to send you to the Omen Ridge.\u201dAfterward, both the Commandery Prince Yunwu and Zhang Ruochen left Mount King.Zhang Ruochen went back to the Jade Palace, but he didn\u2019t see General Ge Qian.The royal guards who were stationed at the Jade Palace were all replaced. The general in charge was massive and tanned with a beard over his face. When he saw Zhang Ruochen, he bowed and greeted him with his thick voice instantly. He said, \u201cYour servant Gan Li greets my Ninth Prince.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhere is General Ge Qian?\u201dGan Li responded, \u201cGe Qian has been assigned to the Mount Emperor ancestor temple. From now on, your servant will protect my Ninth Prince. Don\u2019t worry, my Ninth Prince. My martial cultivation is above Ge Qian and I\u2019m powerful enough to defeat three Ge Qians!\u201dHe then showed Zhang Ruochen his sturdy arms and muscular body. The muscles on his body were like pieces of iron.Zhang Ruochen was deep in thought. It looked like Ge Qian and the other royal guards knew that he had resonated the Chord of Gods and hence they had all been assigned to watch over at the ancestor temple.Zhang Ruochen glanced at Gan Li and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure no assassin dare to come near the Jade Palace under the protection of General Gan Li!\u201dHaving listened to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s compliment, Gan Li laughed and waved the ax in his hand, saying, \u201cI have fought with His Majesty on the battlefield 10 times. I can even kill a savage beast with one swing of my ax. Any assassins who dare to come to the Jade Palace, I assure you I\u2019ll tear them apart!\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and went into the palace. He wanted to go to the courtyard where Le stayed and see if he had cultivated the \u201cNonuple Samsara Magic formula\u201d.When he walked into the courtyard, he saw Le standing still in the middle of the court.The bamboo leaves of the forest beside him were falling down like a rainfall of leaves.The speed of Le releasing the sword was as fast as lightning. It had pierced through the leaves every time he struck. There were shadows of swords everywhere in the courtyard and there were sounds of swords whistling through the air.None of the bamboo leaves that fell down on the ground was whole.\u201cClap!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen clapped his hands while walking towards Le and said, \u201cCongratulations on upgrading your cultivation! I guess you\u2019ve cultivated the first move of the \u2018Nonuple Samsara Magic formula\u2019?\u201dZhang Ruochen could tell that Le\u2019s cultivation had reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm.Le pulled back the sword instantly, sheathing it with great accuracy.Le\u2019s sight had also fallen on Zhang Ruochen. He asked, \u201cHow about you, my benefactor? Have you reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm?\u201d\u201cI did indeed make it to the Black Realm.\u201d Zhang Ruochen nodded and asked, \u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019s your plan?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I guess I\u2019m doomed to take a slaughter path in my life. Since I\u2019ve cultivated to the Black Realm, I want to test myself at the black market.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cThe black market is surely a path with no comeback for ordinary warriors. Perhaps it\u2019s a good try for you!\u201dThe power of the black market was certainly massive, it had spread all over the commandery. It had enough power to confront the Martial Market Bank, the Federation of Inscription, and the Moon Worship Demonic Sect. Moreover, It was where the depraved and the fugitives assembled.Yun rushed to the Ninth Prince. She bowed and said, \u201cMy Ninth Prince, Lin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan have a message for you from their maidservant. They said the one month time is up. They want to invite you to the Martial arts field of the Royal Family and observe the fight.\u201d\u201cOh! It\u2019s already been one month! Okay, I\u2019ll head to the Martial arts field now.\u201d Zhang Ruochen put up a smile on his face. He glanced at Le and found him exceptionally calm.Zhang Ruochen nodded and asked, \u201cLe, do you want to watch the fight together?\u201dLe said, \u201cGood idea, let\u2019s go!\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen, Le, and Yun arrived at the Martial arts field, all the princes and princesses had already gathered around in the field.Other than Lin Chenyu and Lin Ningshan from Lin\u2019s family, they also brought four guards to the field.Seeing Le walking into the field with Zhang Ruochen, every single warrior of the Lin\u2019s was shocked, including Lin Ningshan.\u201cIsn\u2019t he the slave of Ningshan? He is in real luck that he didn\u2019t die!\u201d One of the four guards sneered.\u201cSo what? Although he didn\u2019t die, all his Meridians have been destroyed. He\u2019s disabled now!\u201d The other guard said with disdain.The four guards who stood behind Lin Ningshan were exactly the four who broke Le\u2019s arms and legs outside the Coliseum of the Martial Market.They all thought that they had beaten him to death. No wonder why they were relatively shocked when they saw Le who was following behind Zhang Ruochen.One of the guards with a hawk nose held a hundred kilogram iron rod, stepped up behind Lin Ningshan and said, \u201cLe, you\u2019re the slave of Ningshan. How dare you not kneel down when you see our mistress?\u201dLe stared at the guard cold-bloodedly.The guard who just spoke out was only at the Advanced Stage of the Yellow Realm. Looking into Le\u2019s eyes, he felt a chill.\u201cAll his Meridians have been destroyed! I shouldn\u2019t be scared! Calm down!\u201dThe guard tried to comfort himself and continued, \u201cA slave who wants to raise a ruckus? Such a degrading slave! I, Lin Zhuosi, have to teach you a lesson today!\u201dThe guard held the iron rod with both hands and swung toward Le\u2019s waist.\u201cBeep!\u201dA sword flashed.The head of the guard had been torn apart from the body and blood sprouted three meters high from the neck.The body without a head fell to the ground heavily.The other three guards were all frozen behind Lin Ningshan. They couldn\u2019t believe that Le would dare to kill Lin Zhuosi.Moreover, the way he swung the sword was too fast that no one recognized how he killed the guard.Even Lin Ningshan with a higher cultivation couldn\u2019t identify Le\u2019s sword technique clearly. Not to mention these three guards behind her.The only person who had distinguished Le\u2019s sword technique was Lin Chenyu. He chuckled and said, \u201cLe, you\u2019re definitely the deadly swordsman of the Lin\u2019s. Your cultivation is much stronger than before with a faster sword technique. I guess you\u2019ve reached the Black Realm?\u201dLe answered, \u201cMaster Lin, I once was the slave of the Lin\u2019s. However, the Le in front of you is just Le. He has nothing to do with the Lin\u2019s anymore!\u201d\u201cHaha! Le, you\u2019re too naive. Once you are a slave, forever a slave!\u201d \u201cIf you dare to betray your master, you\u2019ve violated the regulations of the commandery and will be subjected to death,\u201d Lin Ningshan said. \u201cSince you\u2019ve broken through the Black Realm, why don\u2019t you come back to the Lin\u2019s? You\u2019re will enjoy lots of benefits in the future if you\u2019re loyal to us.\u201dLe looked sharp and said, \u201cMiss Lin, the reason why I agreed to be your slave was you saved my life. Yet, your saving grace has been written off since the moment you decided to kill me outside the Coliseum of the Martial Market. The Le you\u2019re looking at is not going to be anyone\u2019s slave now. I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get to live if you force me to be your slave!\u201dLin Ningshan was extremely irritated and said, \u201cHow dare you! Guards\u2026\u201d\u201cMy cousin, I\u2019ll buy this slave!\u201d Zhang Ruochen walked toward Lin Ningshan and pointed at Le.Although Lin Ningshan was arrogant, she was correct that it was considered as a serious crime for a slave to betray their master in the Yunwu Commandery. They would no doubt be subjected to death.Lin Ningshan looked at Zhang Ruochen and said while smiling, \u201cOh, my cousin. Can I say that you\u2019re begging me?\u201dZhang Ruochen answered, \u201cIf you have to comprehend it that way, you can.\u201d\u201cGreat! Since you beg me, how can I not save you some face as your cousin? Give me one million silver coins and I\u2019ll sell you this slave.\u201d Lin Ningshan lifted up her head and giggled.A slave at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm was valued at a maximum of 10,000 silver coins. No one would spend one million silver coins to buy a slave at such level, including Lin Ningshan.The Ninth Commandery Princess added, \u201cLin Ningshan, you\u2019re robbing my ninth brother! One million silver coins are more than enough to buy 100 slaves at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm!\u201dLin Ningshan laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be good if you don\u2019t have enough coins to buy. Being a good person has a price!\u201dZhang Ruochen interrupted Lin Ningshan and exclaimed, \u201cDeal! One million silver coins are indeed worth it for Le. I\u2019ll send the one million silver coins to the Lin Mansion within a month.\u201dEveryone in the field was amazed by what Zhang Ruochen had said, including Lin Ningshan.No one believed that he would spent one million silver coins just to buy a degraded slave.Only a fool like Zhang Ruochen would do such losing business.\u201cMy ninth brother\u2026\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was about to say something but was stopped by Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen looked at Lin Ningshan. He outstretched one arm and asked, \u201cMy cousin, I guess you can hand me the slave contract now?\u201d\u201cWealth speaks louder than words! My cousin, you have my respect. One million silver coins come in at the right time, it\u2019s going to be my dowry when I marry the Seventh Prince. Thank you, my dear cousin!\u201d A joyful smile was displayed on Lin Ningshan\u2019s face. She took out the beast-skin contract and handed over it to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen responded with a faint smile. He took the beast-skin contract and made sure it was Le\u2019s name on it. Then, he activated the Genuine Qi in his body and transferred it to his five fingers.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe beast-skin contract had been shattered by his Genuine Qi and turned into nail-sized pieces of skin.People were shocked again.Having spent one million silver coins to buy a degraded slave and then he destroyed the contract right away. Was the Ninth Prince insane?Le looked at Zhang Ruochen deeply and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ll repay you 100 times in the future!\u201d\u201cPhew!\u201dA guard who stood behind Lin Ningshan laughed, \u201c100 times? Boasting fool! That\u2019s altogether one billion silver coins. Even warriors of the Heaven Realm are not able to accumulate such wealth in their entire life.\u201dLin Ningshan naturally didn\u2019t believe Le and thought he was being foolish.The Ninth Commandery Princess shook her head and felt sorry for Zhang Ruochen. Le wasn\u2019t worth what Zhang Ruochen had done. Besides, even the large-scale families were unable to take out one million silver coins at once.She sighed in her heart and since her ninth brother had made the decision, she could do nothing but let Lin Ningshan take advantage of Zhang Ruochen.The Ninth Commandery Princess held her sword elegantly in the middle of the Martial arts field and pointed at Lin Ningshan. She said, \u201cLin Ningshan, stop being proud of yourself! One month time is up. I hereby challenge you to fight!\u201dLin Ningshan who had just received a million silver coins was so pleased that no words could explain her feelings. Moreover, she had greatly improved her cultivation level, thus she didn\u2019t bother too much about the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cThe Ninth Commandery Princess is indeed very positive! I wonder whether or not you\u2019ll still be arrogant like this if I defeat you for the third time?\u201d Lin Ningshan sneered.The Ninth Commandery Princess was full of confidence and said, \u201cIf I defeat you, I\u2019m not going to go easy on you!\u201dLin Ningshan who was wearing a white long dress walked towards the Martial arts field looked as pure as lilies. She stood beautifully in front of the Ninth Commandery Princess.Her sight shifted to Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cMy cousin, I want to change the rules. If I defeat the Ninth Commandery Princess, you don\u2019t need to apologize but instead, do me a favor.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201dLin Ningshan looked up slightly and smiled, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it yet. I\u2019ll tell you when I have an idea. You don\u2019t need to worry, my cousin. We are a family and I\u2019m not going to hurt you!\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at the Ninth Commandery Princess. He nodded and said, \u201cOkay, I promise you! I\u2019m sure my Ninth Sister will defeat you, I have confidence in her!\u201dHaving listened to what Zhang Ruochen said, the Ninth Commandery Princess felt more pressure. She thought to herself,\u00a0\u201cI need to win this fight and stop Lin Ningshan from being so arrogant. With my cultivation and the use of the \u2018Tianhe Scripture\u2019, I should be able to win.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess surely understood how important this fight was. She had taken out all the savings she had in order to buy all sorts of resources she needed for cultivation in this month. Therefore, her cultivation had improved greatly.\u201cMy ninth brother, I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess looked toward Zhang Ruochen with a glimmer of a smile in her eyes and the glance had displayed a sense of mystery.\u201cThis look\u2026 has she successfully cultivated the first level of the \u2018Tianhe Scripture\u2019?\u201dZhang Ruochen was shocked slightly by the fact that Yuxi had fully prepared for the fight.\u201cStop chattering, my Ninth Commandery Princess. You are doomed to lose the fight again!\u201dLin Ningshan huffed coldly. She took out the Splendor Sword and released it toward the Ninth Commandery Princess.There was half a meter long sword light pulled through as well as an irritating sword echo while she was releasing the sword.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Completion of the Yellow Realm!\u201d\u00a0Zhang Ruochen frowned slightly. He could tell Lin Ningshan\u2019s martial arts realm when she released her sword.Lin Ningshan\u2019s cultivation had been greatly enhanced in just a month! If she didn\u2019t take any pills, she wouldn\u2019t be able to break through from the Final State to the Completion of the Yellow Realm in such a short period of time.The Third Prince shook his head and said, \u201cLin Ningshan has cultivated to the Completion of the Yellow Realm. Our ninth sister is definitely going to lose!\u201d\u201cIf our ninth sister loses, our ninth brother will have to do Lin Ningshan a favor. What if Lin Ningshan wants him to kneel down? It will no doubt that can stain the reputation of the Royal Family!\u201d The Fifth Prince said with cruelty in his eyes.The Third Prince said, \u201cOur ninth brother is still too young and impetuous. If let him suffer some setbacks. It\u2019ll do him good for his future as a warrior.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So what? I have also made it!\u201dThe corner of the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s lips curved slightly. She started the \u201cTianhe Scripture\u201d. The Genuine Qi in her body became white and even covered her skin with a layer of white brilliance.The Blue Water Sword in her hand reacted and gave off a beam of light around five feet long.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess waved her arms, drawing sword circles above her head. It emitted streaks of white light, and the Sword Breath wound round and round towards Lin Ningshan.\u201cHow can this be?\u201dThat the Ninth Commandery Princess had broken through to the Completion of the Yellow Realm?Also, the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s Genuine Qi also seemed more powerful now. It was very thick and carried with it a light sense of coldness.Lin Ningshan felt her own Genuine Qi may be a little weaker than that of the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201cShe has indeed successfully finished the practice of one part of the Tianhe Scripture. I had no idea that ninth sister\u2019s physique was so suitable for practicing the Tianhe Scripture,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Training exercises were not always the more powerful the better and it is important that the training and the warrior\u2019s physique were compatible.Clearly, the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s physique was very compatible with the Tianhe Scripture, and thus she was able to, in a very short amount of time, completed the training for one part of the Tianhe Scripture.If Le were to train with the Tianhe Scripture, perhaps he would not improve as quickly as the Ninth Commandery Princess. That was not to say he was not as talented as the Ninth Commandery Princess, but because his physique was not as compatible with the Tianhe Scripture.As the Ninth Commandery Princess had also reached the Completion in the Yellow Realm, then the outcome of this match was once again suspenseful.Lin Ningshan was slightly more accomplished than the Ninth Commandery Princess in sword techniques.However, the Ninth Commandery Princess trained with a higher class of sword technique, and so her Genuine Qi was purer. Even when using a lower class sword technique, her attacks would still be very powerful.They were known as the \u201cTwo Beauties of Yunwu City\u201d, possessing beauty beyond that of normal people. Each of the sword techniques is executed with grace and is elegant to behold. It seems as if two the fairies were engaged in a dance of the sword.Their clashes were very dangerous, each stroke of the Sword Breath leaving deep gashes in the earth.\u201cSo what if you have reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm? You are still not able to challenge me.\u201d\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dLin Ningshan executed a low-class Spiritual sword technique. With a wave of her arm, a Sword Breath of eight meters in length flew out from the sword, dragging behind it a long sword path, straight towards the Ninth Commandery Princess.The Ninth Commandery Princess had not trained a low-class Spiritual Stage sword technique but had successfully practiced a Superior class Human Stage sword technique, Ethereal sword technique.\u201cEtherealness and Silence!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess grasped her sword by the hilt with both hands and chopped down towards the ground, meeting Lin Ningshan\u2019s attack head-on.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s hand was scratched by the Sword Breath, blood dripped from her wrists.The power of low-class Spiritual sword techniques could not be compared to Human Stage sword techniques. In the end, the Ninth Commandery Princess was still slightly weaker than Lin Ningshan.Lin Ningshan gave a cold laugh, and once again stepped up her pace, chasing after the Ninth Commandery Princess, once again striking with \u201cSacred Guiding Sword\u201d.Seeing that the Ninth Commandery Princess was being pushed back with nowhere to go by Lin Ningshan, Zhang Ruochen immediately said, \u201cNinth sister, don\u2019t go head to head with her, utilize the strategy of movement, use up her Genuine Qi.\u201dHearing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s words, the Ninth Commandery Princess suddenly understood. Immediately she executed a mid-class Human Stage technique, becoming a shadow and flitting aside, dodging Lin Ningshan\u2019s attack.Although the Spiritual Stage sword techniques were very powerful, they also consumed huge amounts of Genuine Qi. Lin Ningshan had only just reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm, and her Genuine Qi is still very lacking. After, at most, ten strokes of Spiritual Stage sword techniques, her Genuine Qi would have been depleted.Lin Chenyu stood outside the Martial arts field with his hands behind his back, smiled and said, \u201cSince you can advise the Ninth Commandery Princess, then may I advise Ningshan?\u201dZhang Ruochen gestured with both hands, smiled and said, \u201cPlease, go ahead.\u201dLin Chenyu said, \u201cNingshan, since the Ninth Commander Princess wants to escape, then you should follow and win the chase. Use the Lin family\u2019s Killing Sword Technique and cut off her escape.\u201dLin Ningshan took her brother\u2019s words to heart, and following Lin Chenyu\u2019s words, immediately executed the Killing Sword Technique, chasing after the Ninth Commandery Princess and forcing the Ninth Commandery Princess into dangerous straits.On the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s clothes, a few more cuts opened.Zhang Ruochen stood at the other end of the Martial arts field and said, \u201cNinth Sister, use the blue water sword technique, and attack her base.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess immediately acted on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s words, executing a blue water reverse. The tip of her sword sliced past Lin Ningshan\u2019s abdomen.\u201cA hitting!\u201dAt Lin Ningshan\u2019s abdomen, her robe was slashed, showing a small section of pale white skin. The Ninth Commandery Princess almost drew blood.Zhang Ruochen and Lin Chenyu were far more knowledgeable than the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan about Martial Arts, and so with their advice, the fight became even more dangerous.It could no longer be considered a fight between the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan, rather it was a duel between Zhang Ruochen and Lin Chenyu.\u201cLin Ningshan, use Sacred Sword Skill, straight towards her face.\u201d\u201cNinth sister, don\u2019t meet her head on, immediately take three steps to the left then turn back and strike.\u201d\u2026Zhang Ruochen and Lin Chenyu continued to advise the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan. Half an hour passed and yet there was still no winner, both women continued to take more and more damage.Zhang Ruochen saw that the Ninth Commandery Princess already had five wounds, each was dripping blood. He knew that if the fight were to go on, she and Lin Ningshan were sure to be heavily wounded.Were both of them to be defeated and wounded?Zhang Ruochen shook his head and took Le\u2019s sword from his hand, gripping it in his own and said, \u201cNinth sister, look how I execute this move, Sacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen stood outside the Martial arts field and began the move. Striking out with the sword, seven streaks of Sword Breath flew out from the sword.The Ninth Commandery Princess watched closely. She immediately followed Zhang Ruochen\u2019s instructions and struck out, executing the Sacred Breaking Plum Sword, straight toward Lin Ningshan\u2019s glabella.Sacred Breaking Plum Sword was one of the techniques of the Sacred Sword Skill, even Lin Ningshan had not yet managed to learn it.Seeing the Ninth Commandery Princess executing the Sacred Breaking Plum Sword, Lin Ningshan panicked and immediately dodged to the right.Outside of the martial arts field, Zhang Ruochen seemed to have expected Lin Ningshan to dodge to the right and so with a shake of his arm, the sword in his hand immediately dipped down and started swinging to the right.The Ninth Commandery Princess saw Zhang Ruochen change his strike and followed to do the same, and the Blue Water Sword in her hand turned to strike to the right.\u201cSwish!\u201dWhen her sword came to a stop, not an inch more or less, it landed exactly on Lin Ningshan\u2019s neck.Lin Ningshan\u2019s face changed and was about to strike back.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess pushed a little harder on her sword. The edge of the sword slightly broke the skin at Lin Ningshan\u2019s neck, a drop of blood rolled along the edge of the blade and fell down.If Lin Ningshan dared to retaliate, the sword would only plunge deeper.At this moment, the Ninth Commandery Princess was overjoyed. Using the sword at Lin Ningshan\u2019s neck, she used the point to raise Lin Ningshan\u2019s chin, smiled and said, \u201cSister Ningshan, you really shouldn\u2019t move! If by accident, I slice through your face of startling beauty, that would be a tragedy!\u201dLin Ningshan was afraid to move. She was terrified that the Ninth Commandery Princess would slice her face.Given the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s identity, if she sliced her face during a duel, she would at most be scolded by the Yunwu Commandery Prince and the Queen, they wouldn\u2019t truly punish her.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Zhang Ruochen helping you, you would not be able to beat me.\u201d Lin Ningshan bore her pearly white teeth in anger, and said, \u201cWe shall fight again, fairly.\u201d\u201cI have already won, why would I fight you again?\u201d the Ninth Commandery Princess and asked teasingly while innocently blinking.Her sword continued to remain around Lin Ningshan\u2019s neck and face as if at any moment she could strike and ruin Lin Ningshan\u2019s face.Before the fight, Lin Ningshan had never thought she would lose to the Ninth Commandery Princess. Even now, she would not admit that she was not as good as the Ninth Commandery Princess.Lin Ningshan was not satisfied and said, \u201cIf you are willing to fight again, we can raise the stakes. If I lose again to you, I am willing to become your serving girl, and serve you for 10 years.\u201d\u201cNot interested!\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess shook her head and said, \u201cI do not have the time to fight you again. You have lost this fight, kneel instantly and apologize to me, or I will slice apart your face and make you ugly.\u201dZhang Ruochen gently shook his head and sighed quietly.\u00a0\u201cBattle between women was a terrifying thing\u201d.However, he did not feel sympathy for Lin Ningshan!If the Ninth Commandery Princess had lost this fight, Lin Ningshan would use even more extreme methods to humiliate Zhang Ruochen.Lin Ningshan\u2019s eyes carried a dark anger and she said, \u201cI agreed to apologize, but did not agree to kneel and apologize.\u201d\u201cI have won, and I want you to kneel. You can decide! If you don\u2019t kneel, then I will really slice open your face.\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said.Lin Ningshan\u2019s eyes flashed to Lin Chenyu, imploring him to help.Lin Chenyu said, \u201cYour Majesty, one should forgive\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! Who are you? You are nothing more than seven brother\u2019s servant, do you have the right to stand and talk to me?\u201d The Ninth Commandery Princess said.Lin Chenyu\u2019s face darkened, a sense of death flashed through his eyes, but he quickly suppressed it. Politely he bowed to the Ninth Commandery Princess and said, \u201cThis servant dares not. Ningshan, kneel immediately and apologize to the Ninth Commandery Princess.\u201dLin Ningshan\u2019s eyes were filled with murderous intent, her whole body was shaking. For her, to kneel to the Ninth Commandery Princess, it was the greatest humiliation.The Ninth Commandery Princess blinked, smiled and said, \u201cI am not an unreasonable person, if you are willing to pay out one million silver coins, then I can let you go at once, and you won\u2019t need to kneel.\u201d\u201cA million silver coins, where would I find that?\u201d Lin Ningshan said.The Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s eyes fleshed to Zhang Ruochen standing outside the Martial arts field. Her meaning was clear,\u00a0\u201cninth brother owes you one million silver coins. If you will not ask for the one million silver coins, then I will let you go.\u201dLin Ningshan, of course, understood the Ninth Commandery Princess\u2019s meaning, and also looked towards Zhang Ruochen.If she could bring out one million silver coins, she could choose to not kneel.But, the one million silver coins, for the whole family, it was a huge amount. Lin Ningshan could not hand it back.\u201cFine! I\u2019ll kneel!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Ningshan looked like she had made an important decision, unbelievably she kneeled in front of the Ninth Commandery Princess and said, \u201cYour Majesty, the Ninth Commandery Princess, I apologize humbly. Everything was my fault previously, please forgive me.\u201dThe Ninth Commandery Princess was shocked!The Ninth Commandery Princess had not meant to really humiliate Lin Ningshan. She only wanted to force Lin Ningshan to return the one million silver coins.She did not expect for Lin Ningshan to kneel for the one million silver coins, to take such humiliation as kneeling and apologizing.If they had swapped places, the Ninth Commandery Princess would definitely not have been able to do that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019ll die if he steps out of the palace.\u201d\u201cAs for Ninth Commandery Princess, it\u2019ll be easy to kill her.\u201d\u201cNingshan, what\u2019s most important for you is to practice hard to reach the Black Realm. When that time comes, you\u2019ll be able to kill her by your own hands.\u201dAn icy stare flashed in Lin Ningshan\u2019s eyes. She replied, \u201cYou\u2019re right! I must kill her myself to ease my hatred.\u201dLin Chenyu took out a red copper box from his sleeve and handed it to Lin Ningshan. \u201cThis is a Third-Class Dark Blood Pill. It\u2019ll help you increase your success rate by 30% when you challenge the Black Realm. If you can make it, you can go to Yuntai Suzerain with me. It won\u2019t be difficult for you to pass the exam for Yuntai Suzerain then.\u201dLin Ningshan took the Dark Blood Pill with some pleasure. \u201cI can go to Yuntai Suzerain as long as I break through the Black Realm? That\u2019s great! I\u2019ll be able to meet Seventh Prince then.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for certain.\u201dLin Chenyu smiled and said, \u201cThe Seventh Prince is now an internal students of the suzerain and has a high status. If he favors you, you\u2019ll receive many benefits in the future.\u201dHearing his words, Lin Ningshan instantly transformed the humiliation to some expectation in her heart. The Seventh Prince was a great talent in front of whom, Zhang Ruochen was just an extra.At the martial art field of the Royal Family, Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cNinth sister, you\u2019ve humiliated her and made her kneel down in front of the crowd. She definitely will take revenge on you in some extreme ways one day.\u201dNinth Commandery Princess took back her Blue Water Sword and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to humiliate her and I just wanted your 1,000,000 silver coins back. Besides, should I be afraid of her? Even lent her a daring, she did not dare to hurt anyone of our royal family.\u201d\u201cI hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d Zhang Ruochen took out a black copper box and handed it to Ninth Commandery Princess. \u201cA Dark Blood Pill and it\u2019ll increase your success rate by 30% when you challenge the Black Realm.\u201dZhang Ruochen should have eaten the pill that he bought for his Black Realm challenge. But when he practiced Ultimate Realm in Mount King, he brought in Chord of Gods. With the help of the Gods\u2019 power, he directly broke through Black Realm without Dark Blood Pill.He now passed it into Ninth Commandery Princess.She accepted it happily without hesitation.The other princes and the princesses were very envious. It was known that the pill was a Third-class pill, valued at 120,000 silver coins. Those who ate it could save a year\u2019s worth of practice.Ordinary princes and princesses could not afford it.After leaving the martial arts field of the Royal Family, Le bade Zhang Ruochen farewell and left for the black market.\u201cLe!\u201dZhang Ruochen called Le and said meaningfully, \u201cA month later, I will leave for the School of the Martial Market. But, there\u2019s something I\u2019m worried about.\u201d\u201cNinth Commandery Princess?\u201d Le stared at Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen nodded. \u201cHaving suffered such a huge insult, Lin Ningshan will certainly take revenge on my ninth sister. She may even kill her.\u201dLe said, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m in Yunwu City, I\u2019ll protect her from the Lin family.\u201d\u201cI hear you!\u201d Zhang Ruochen laughed.Without any more words, Le walked out the palace, leaving Zhang Ruochen the view of his lonely, but proud back.Zhang Ruochen felt it was the best deal he had ever made to buy Le from Lin Ningshan with 1,000,000 coins.However, one million was a lot of money.He currently had 890,000 silver coins left and still needed 110,000. How could he get the money?\u201cIt seems that I can only depend on Spatial Ring. As long as I refine a Spatial Ring, I must earn 110, 000 silver coins easily.\u201d\u201cMy Genuine Qi has become richer since I reached the Black Realm. I also have the faint power of Gods in my body. This all makes it possible for me to carve Inscription of Strain-type and Inscription of Condensing.\u201dExcept for the two inscriptions, Zhang Ruochen had also carved the other six basic Inscriptions of Space.One must know, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Spiritual Power was powerful. He had already reached level 32.The reason why he couldn\u2019t carve them previously was not that his Spiritual Power was not strong enough, but his Genuine Qi was not thick enough.Now that his cultivation had reached the Black Realm and his Genuine Qi increased, he was sure he could carve them.Thinking about this, Zhang Ruochen could not wait to carve, so he returned to Jade Palace as quickly as possible.When he arrived at Jade Palace, General Gan Li bowed to him, with a hatchet in hand. \u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.General Gan Li laughed and handed a bag to Zhang Ruochen. \u201cThere are silver coins and Spiritual Crystals from Imperial Finance Department. These were exchanged for the savage beasts you hunted in King Mount.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen happily accepted the bag, he felt it was a little too heavy.When he opened the bag, he laughed.There were 143 Spiritual Crystal and 670 silver coins, amounting to 143,670 silver coins.Earlier, Zhang Ruochen had killed three level-two savage beasts, 30 superior-class level-one savage beasts, more than 30 medium-class level-one savage beasts, and some inferior-class level-one ones.A second-level savage beast was valued at more than 20,000 silver coins. For example, Silver Dragon-Lion could be sold for 30,000 or 40,000 silver coins since its whole body was full of treasure.A superior-class level-one savage beast was valued at 5,000 to 10,000 silver coins.A medium-class level-one savage beast was valued at 1,000 silver coins.\u201cAfter half a month in Mount King, I made 143,670 silver coins. The price was low because they were exchanged in Imperial Finance Department. If I sell them in the Martial Market, they\u2019ll pay 200,000 silver coins.\u201dIt seemed pretty lucrative to hunt savage beasts, but the work was not easy.The reason why Zhang Ruochen could hunt so many savage beasts was that King Mount was the hunting ground of royal family. The beasts there were not fierce. There were also no superior class beasts of the second and third levels.If it was in the Omen Ridge or Tongming River, hunting would be dangerous for warriors of Completion in Black Realm, let alone warriors of Initial Stage in Black Realm.Warriors in Earth Realm or Heaven Realm might even die if they ventured too far into Omen Ridge and Dead Reach of Tongming River.Thus it was enough for Zhang Ruochen to earn 143,670 silver coins. At least, he now had enough money to pay Lin Ningshan.Zhang Ruochen immediately entered the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel after returning to his room.He took out an inscription pen and placed a piece of Spiritual Paper on the ground.\u201cI must carve successfully!\u201dHe injected Genuine Qi into the pen and sketched Inscription of Strain-type on the paper.After reaching the Black Realm, Zhang Ruochen felt his carving became more fluid. It took him only 10 breaths to complete his carving.\u201cHaha! I did it!\u201dHe started to draw Inscription of Condensing.He carved quicker this time, using just eight breaths.Zhang Ruochen continued. When he practiced for the 10th time, he could carve both inscriptions in three breaths.\u201cThis is awesome! I can now carve all eight basic Inscriptions of Space. After I brought in the first Chord of Gods, my Spiritual Power increased so much. I wonder which level I am at right now.\u201dZhang Ruochen was very happy and started to refine the Spatial Ring.Last time, he refined a Spatial Ring successfully. But back then, he could not draw Inscription of Strain-type, limiting his ability to expand the internal space in Spatial Ring.That ring was just a basic Spatial Ring with limited internal space of around one cubic meter. It can only store a couple of things.Now he had learned how to draw Inscription of Strain-type and the Inscription of Condensing. Could he refine a Spatial Ring with a larger internal space?Excitedly, he took out a white ring carved in a phoenix pattern.The first step was to carve Inscription of Space on it.Zhang Ruochen spent 15 minutes successfully carving six Inscriptions of Space on the ring.There was an internal space of one cubic meter inside the ring.The next step, also the most important step, was to carve Inscription of Strain-type to expand that space.Zhang Ruochen held the pen, carving carefully. He drew as fluidly as floating clouds and flowing water.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBoom!\u201dOnce he carved successfully, the internal space instantly expanded.One cubic, two cubics, three cubics\u2026The internal space quickly expanded to eight cubic meters and it was still increasing.Zhang Ruochen injected all his Genuine Qi into the ring. He made full use of his cultivation to maximize the internal space of the ring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0TransnWith his unremitting efforts, he expanded internal space of Spatial Ring to 12 cubic meters. Finally, the space became as big as a small house.\u201cHaa!\u201dThe surface of the ring glistened and the internal space quickly turned into a separate space.\u201cWith my current cultivation, the biggest internal space I can make is 12 cubic meters.\u201d12 cubic meters was not that big, but it was enough for a regular warrior.When his cultivation improved, he could refine a ring with a bigger internal space in the future.To carve the inscription was just the first step.The next step was refining the ring.The reason why Ruochen bought a weapon refining stove, which could refine Genuine Martial Arms of the seventh stage from Qingxuan Pavilion, was that he could refine a Spatial Ring. Under the refining fire, the internal space of the ring would stabilize, making the ring Genuine Martial Arms.He put the ring in the stove and lit Fire Nature Spiritual Crystal under.\u201cPhew!\u201dDriven by Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi, the crystal began to burn.Zhang Ruochen needed only to control the strength of the fire, when the crystal was burning. When the stove needed stronger fire, he poured his Genuine Qi into the crystal, making the fire larger.He sat by the stove with his legs crossed and summoned the Sacred Prime Tree painting floating on Qi Lake, placing it in front of him.He stretched one hand over the painting and injected Genuine Qi in it to summon Blackie.A dark light flashed and a giant black cat appeared in front of him.Blackie had a rounded body with a raised tail. His eyes were like two round black crystals. Blackie asked, \u201cYoung man, have you learned all eight basic Inscriptions of Space?\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded. \u201cYes! But I feel like there\u2019s something lacking in the ring.\u201dBlackie said, \u201cA Spatial Ring is just a basic treasure of space. But the ring you refined is the basic ring of the basic treasure.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dBlackie answered, \u201cThe ring you refined lacks Master-Verifying Inscription. Once you lose your ring, anyone can open it and take your treasures from it.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded. \u201cWhat else?\u201dBlackie said, \u201cThe Spatial Ring refined by Saint Monk Xumi can store not only treasures but also have the power to attack and defend.\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s eyes were gleaming. \u201cCan I carve Inscriptions of Attack and Defense on the Spatial Ring?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dBlackie continued, \u201cIf you have high attainments in the inscription, you can carve Inscription of Anonymity on your ring. That way, people can\u2019t see your ring and they won\u2019t covet it.\u201dHe added, \u201cBut both Master-Verifying Inscription and Inscription of Anonymity are medium-level inscriptions. They\u2019re so complicated that you can only carve them after your Spiritual Power has reached level 30. Even if when you reached that level, you must learn and practice a lot before you can carve them. After all, Inscription of Space is harder than other inscriptions.\u201dZhang Ruochen turned\u00a0The Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0to page four where the 16 kinds of medium level Inscriptions of Space were recorded.Master-Verifying Inscription and Inscription of Anonymity were among them.In addition, there was Inscription of Aggression and Inscription of Defense.The easiest medium-level inscription was Master-Verifying Inscription. It was, however, still much harder than Inscription of Strain-type and Inscription of Condensing.It would not be easy for Zhang Ruochen to carve Master-Verifying Inscription with his current cultivation.\u201cMy Spiritual Power has reached the level required for carving medium-level inscriptions. If I work hard, I can carve Master-Verifying Inscription.\u201dZhang Ruochen carefully examined Master-Verifying Inscription and kept it in his mind. Then he practiced on the Spiritual Paper.About an hour later, the weapon refining stove emitted an odd noise.He did it!Zhang Ruochen was impatient to take out the ring out of the stove. He placed it in his hand and stared at it happily. \u201cA Spatial Ring with an internal space of one cubic meter is valued at 100,000 silver coins. This one has 10 times that internal space. How much will it worth?\u201dZhang Ruochen did not sell the ring at once, as he did not lack money. He decided to deal with it later.Now that he had succeeded once, he would be able to refine more Spatial Rings.\u201cThe entrance exam of the School of the Martial Market is in a month. I should try reaching a higher level.\u201dIt was very difficult for him to reach Mid Stage of Black Realm from Initial Stage in just a month.If so, he decided to start to practice Space Domain.Zhang Ruochen turned the Mystery of Time and Space to page three. He devoted himself to studying Space Domain.As for Space Domain, it utilized Soul of Space. Using oneself as the center, one could create a separate Martial Arts space. Zhang Ruochen pulled all strings in Space Domain, for he was its master.His combat effectiveness would triple once he succeeded, at the very least.Zhang Ruochen should have only been able to practice Space Domain once he reached Heaven Realm. But his soul was a warrior of Heaven Realm and he opened up Vessel of Spirit, which meant he can practice Space Domain in advance.Time flew quickly.A month outside the time and space spinel equaled three months inside.For three months, Zhang Ruochen practiced Space Domain. He succeeded at the night before he was supposed to leave the palace.\u201cSpace Area!\u201dZhang Ruochen sat with his legs crossed in the room. He triggered his Martial Soul with Vessel of Spirit to make it float behind him.The Martial Soul uses Spiritual Qi of the heaven and earth to converge into a Space Power. With Zhang Ruochen on the center, it created a sphere with a radius of 10 meters. That was his Space Domain.It was as if Zhang Ruochen was wrapped in a giant white ball. Everything within the ball was under his control.\u201cRise!\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen raised his arm, a red copper lampstand three meters away flew up and floated delicately in the air.\u201cSlap!\u201dThe lampstand abruptly fell to the ground. The flame went out and the oil inside spilled all over.His Space Domain then broke and disappeared.\u201cThe Space Domain I can currently build is frail. I must keep practicing. I feel traces of the power of thunderbolt in my Space Domain. Didn\u2019t my Martial Soul of thunderbolt in the last life disappear?\u201dZhang Ruochen held his Space Area again to watch it carefully and found small sparks of thunder and lightning in it.Just then, a mosquito broke into his domain, flying towards him.He smiled. An idea came to his mind.\u201cSlap!\u201dA thunderbolt from the void space, like a white sword, struck the mosquito into ashes.Zhang Ruochen had discovered an amazing feature. As long as he was in the domain, his eyesight and hearing were enhanced several times. He could clearly see the fine scales on mosquito\u2019s wings and he could audibly hear the most subtle of winds.Was this the beauty of Space Domain?\u201cAs\u00a0the Mystery of Time and Space\u00a0recorded, Space Domain is truly excellent. I just discovered 10 percent of its beauty.\u201dZhang Ruochen wanted to keep practicing and discover more.However, he would have to leave the palace to go to the School of the Martial Market tomorrow. He did not know when he would return again, so he wanted to visit Concubine Lin before he left.Since he showed a powerful gift for the Martial Arts, Concubine Lin\u2019s status in the palace was on a steady rise. More and more maidservants and eunuchs served her, making Jade Palace a livelier place.\u201cChen, I hear the School of the Martial Market is located at Omen Ridge where savage beasts run wild. It\u2019s a dangerous place. You must be careful!\u201d Concubine Lin took his hand in hers, not wanting him to go.But she knew that as children grew up, sooner or later, they would leave the arms of their parents and independently face challenges in the outside world.Zhang Ruochen laughed. \u201cMother, you think too much! The school is on the outskirts of Omen Ridge. It\u2019s not dangerous. Besides, savage beasts dare not attack the school where have many masters.\u201dConcubine Lin nodded. \u201cI heard you and Ningshan became enemies! Ah, after all, she\u2019s your cousin. You\u2019re supposed to spare her life no matter her mistakes in the future.\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s expression turned grim. \u201cDid the head of the Lin family ask you to tell me this?\u201dAfter consuming Spiritual Brawn, Concubine Lin had become more beautiful and youthful. She said in a soft voice, \u201cChen, your grandfather cares about you. But there are many things that he\u2019s forced to do that are out of his will.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded. \u201cMother, I promise you I\u2019ll never touch the Lin family if they don\u2019t bother me again.\u201dConcubine Lin nodded slowly. She was proud of her son as he had truly grown up! The School of the Martial Market would be a bigger world for him.If he achieved great things in the school, those people who undermined them would have nothing more to criticize.Zhang Ruochen then gave her mother 1,000 Spiritual Crystals, asking her to send them to Lin Mansion.1,000 Spiritual Crystal was equal to 1,000,000 silver coins.He did because he knew Concubine Lin had deep attachments to the Lin family. It would mend their relationship if she was the one who sent over the money.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf that family still did not change their attitudes, forcing him to be their enemies, he would not show any mercy.When dawn broke the next day, Zhang Ruochen got on the roan antelope vintage carriage under the protection of royal guards.Ninth Commandery Princess stood on top of the steps. Her body was slender and beautiful. \u201cNinth brother, I\u2019ll practice and reach the Black Realm soon. At that time, I\u2019ll also go to the School of the Martial Market.\u201dSitting on the antelope-horse, Zhang Ruochen laughed. \u201cNinth sister, I\u2019ll wait for your arrival!\u201dZhang Ruochen then left the palace under the protection of General Gan Li and 100 royal guards, embarking on a new journey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She said anxiously, \u201cBrother, Zhang Ruochen has left the palace for the School of the Martial Market. Why haven\u2019t you made your move yet?\u201dLin Chenyu smiled mildly. \u201cDon\u2019t need to hurry.\u201d\u201cIf you let him arrive at the School of the Martial Market, there\u2019s no chance to kill him anymore.\u201d Lin Ningshan said with coldness in her eyes. Her grudge against Zhang Ruochen was so deep.Lin Chenyu was seated in a chair, his palms put together as he practiced an evil art. His entire body emitted a biting, chilling air. He said serenely, eyes closed, \u201cNingshan, even if you don\u2019t trust me, you should have faith in the Hades Department. Don\u2019t worry! He\u2019ll be dead before he makes it to the School of the Martial Market.\u201d\u201cThe Hades Department? It\u2019s the largest assassin guild in Yunwu Commandery. Word on the street says it once killed warriors of the Heaven Realm.\u201d Lin Ningshan\u2019s eyes lit up. If they did hire the assassins from the Hades Department, Zhang Ruochen was dead.Lin Chenyu laughed, \u201cThe Hades Department is not only the largest assassin guild in Yunwu Commandery but also the best in the entire Western Nine Prefectures. In this case, the Hades Department sends two assassins who had at least killed one warrior in the Dawn State of the Black Realm. Under their conjoint attack, Zhang Ruochen has no way to survive even if his cultivation has reached the Black Realm.\u201d\u201cI guess, we\u2019ll get the good news that the Ninth Prince is assassinated before noon. When the time comes, the Queen will reward me greatly for sure. Haha!\u201dWhen Lin Chenyu opened his eyes, his pupils had turned bloody red, giving an extremely savage feeling.Lin Ningshan showed a little smile, and said, \u201cSince the assassins are from the Hades Department, it\u2019s a sure thing.\u201d\u2026There were some other warriors in Yunwu City who would go to the School of the Martial Market for this year\u2019s entrance examination besides Zhang Ruochen.If they could pass the examination and study in the School of the Martial Market, it would be a sudden rising in life for them, just like finding the paradise. They would have access to endless practicing resources. Merely thinking about it was a huge excitement.Those warriors were quite young. They were under their thirties, but all have the cultivation of the Black Realm. There was no weakling. Now, they all were gathering in the Coliseum of the Martial Market, waiting in silence.There had been more than 30 young warriors in the Coliseum of the Martial Market when Zhang Ruochen arrived, including both male and female warriors.\u201cEveryone, look! His Highness Ninth Prince is also here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed the Ninth Prince. They said he just got the first place in the Division of Yellow not long ago. Could it be possible that he had broken through to the Black Realm?\u201cSince he\u2019s come to the Coliseum of the Martial Market, he must have reached the Black Realm. It\u2019s unbelievable! His practicing speed is so fast. No wonder he is the Genius of Martial Arts.\u201d A twenty-something girl in purple with a jade flute in her hand stared at Zhang Ruochen, who just walked out of his carriage. There was a strange light in her eyes.A skinny man standing opposite of the girl in purple exchanged glances with her. They made a little nod and turned their attention towards a nearby Zhang Ruochen. There was a faint trace of malice in them.They were the assassins from the Hades Department. Achieving the Black Realm at such a young age, they could be considered as top talents.The girl in purple was named Zi Qian. She was incredibly beautiful and had some fame in Yunwu City. Yet no one knew that she was an assassin of the Hades Department.The skinny man was named Chen Libing. He seemed a little sick and looked only 25 years old.Before achieving the Black Realm, he had 10 winning streaks in the Yellow Fighting Palace. His best rank was 18th on the Yellow Board.Thanks to his outstanding performance in the Yellow Fighting Palace, he was recruited by the Martial Market Bank to be the captain of the guards. With so many resources at hand, his cultivation grew fast and reached the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm.A Yellow Board warrior who could achieve the Black Realm was definitely the strongest one among those in the same Realm. He could even kill people of a higher realm.Zi Qian and Chen Libing were both considered as genius assassins in the Hades Department. This time, their main task was to assimilate into the School of the Martial Market in preparation for future assassinations.To them, assassinating the Ninth Prince was just an additional task.If the assassination succeeded, they surely would receive great rewards.Even so, it was no small challenge for them to assassinate the Ninth Prince without exposing their true identities.Liu Chengfeng immediately went up to Zhang Ruochen, greeting them with a fist and palm salute. He smiled and said, \u201cYour Highness, I beg your pardon for the things I\u2019ve done in the past.\u201dSomewhat stunned by Liu Chengfeng\u2019s humility, Zhang Ruochen replied, \u201cBrother Liu, what are you doing?\u201dLiu Chengfeng laughed. \u201cEver since I suffered defeat twice at your hands in the Yellow Level Palace, I had been agonizing. Thus, I made up my mind to turn over a new leaf. I didn\u2019t expect that, with this new insight, my cultivation broke through into the Black Realm before long.\u201dZhang Ruochen tentatively looked into Liu Chengfeng\u2019s eyes and smiled. \u201cCongratulations, Brother Liu.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Your Highness inspiring me, I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t have broken through into the Black Realm so quickly.\u201d Liu Chengfeng laughed.Liu Chuanshen, the Manager of the Martial Market Bank, walked into the Colosseum of the Martial Market at the moment, along with other big shots. All eyes were drawn to them.Liu Chuanshen walked towards Zhang Ruochen and smiled. \u201cYour Highness, the Commandery Prince and I were comrades since we were young. \u201cI hope you can forgive Chengfeng and your past enmities for my sake. If you both pass the examination and join the School of the Martial Market, you must support each other.\u201dLiu Chuanshen then turned towards Liu Chengfeng and gave him a sharp stare. \u201cChengfeng, you\u2019re too reckless and not nearly calm enough. I hoped you could learn from the Ninth Prince from now on and take him as your role model.\u201dLiu Chuanshen was so sophisticated that he knew Zhang Ruochen\u2019s talent was way higher than his own son. If his son could have more contacts with Zhang Ruochen, it would benefit him much in the future.Liu Chengfeng retorted, \u201cI\u2019ll learn from the Ninth Prince even if you didn\u2019t tell me so.\u201dIf Liu Chengfeng had really turned over a new leaf, Zhang Ruochen naturally would not mind forgiving and letting him off.Liu Chengfeng was indeed a genius. He had reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm when he was 17 years old. Then, he became a warrior of Yellow Board and broke through to the Black Realm when he was 20 years old.There were only a handful of geniuses like him in the whole of Yunwu Commandery.With Liu Chuanshen standing next to Zhang Ruochen, Zi Qian and Chen Libing had no chance to attack.By noon, there were 68 young warriors who reached the Black Realm gathered at the Warfare Palace. All the warriors who wanted to attend the School of the Martial Market in the entire Yunwu Commandery were there.\u201cWaaa!\u201dThere came an earsplitting howl of an eagle from the sky. More than half of Yunwu City could hear it.A huge blood-feathered eagle flew out of the cloud. When it spread out its wings, the distance between them was more than 70 meters. It looked like a bloody red hill, flying down from the sky.The blood-feathered eagle showed an imposing manner, exerting huge pressure on the warriors below. Some warriors with lower cultivation even felt that their legs weakening and cold sweat all over their bodies.\u201cBlood-feathered eagle was a savage beast in the third superior class. If we only consider the destructibility, its power is scarier than the power of a warrior in the Completion of the Earth Realm,\u201d a young warrior of the Black Realm said in his shaking voice.Another young female warrior said, \u201cI once saw a blood-feathered eagle in the outer-ring of Omen Ridge. With just a mouthful of flame from the eagle, an entire village became scorched to the ground. Everyone there was burnt to death.\u201dHearing these comments, the young aristocrats who had never left Yunwu City turned pale with fright.Yet Zhang Ruochen was perfectly calm and collected. He looked up into the sky and saw a middle-aged man in a silver robe standing on the head of the blood-feathered eagle.The silver-robed man stood still with an ancient sword on his back. He was even more imposing than the blood-feathered eagle.Liu Chuanshen smiled with his hands clasped behind his back. \u201cElder Xie, long time no see.\u201dThe silver-robed man standing on the head of blood-feathered eagle said, \u201cElder Liu, are there only dozens of people from Yunwu Commandery taking the entrance examination this year? I remember there were 103 warriors of the Black Realm from Yunwu Commandery last year, but only three of them passed and became the external disciples of the school.\u201dLiu Chuanshen was the Manager of the Martial Market Bank in Yunwu Commandery, but in the Martial Market Bank, he and the silver-robed man were both Elders.Liu Chuanshen smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elder Xie. There will be more people passing the examination than last year. Who knows if we may even have some surprises.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dHearing Liu Chuanshen\u2019s words, Xie Nantian thought of something and said, \u201cCould it be that some extraordinary genius had popped up from Yunwu Commandery? A genius who can get into top 10 in the examination?\u201dLiu Chuanshen smiled mysteriously and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when the time comes.\u201dXie Nantian knew that Liu Chuanshen was a prudent man. There must be an incredible genius from Yunwu Commandery. He must definitely find the genius and take him in as a disciple in advance.Xie Nantian stared at the 68 warriors of the Black Realm below. When his eyes fell on Zi Qian, he gasped.Zi Qian was only about 22 years old, but she had reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm. She could be considered a genius even in the external School of the Martial Market.\u201cShe must be the one that Liu Chuanshen meant.\u201dXie Nantian showed a little smile in his eyes. Nodding slightly, he said, \u201cSince you\u2019re all here, come and stand on the back of the blood-feathered eagle. We\u2019ll head to the School of the Martial Market now.\u201dThe 68 warriors all demonstrated their martial art to leap to the back of the blood-feathered eagle, finding a place to sit.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen sat beside Liu Chengfeng. All of a sudden, he smelled a faint fragrance.Zhang Ruochen turned around towards his left and saw a girl in purple sitting next to him. She was gorgeous and had a particularly lovely shape. Her breasts were perky and round, looking as if they were going to burst out of her purple dress.Zhang Ruochen just glanced at her, and he drew back his sight.\u201cWaaa!\u201dThe blood-feathered eagle soared upwards to the sky when all warriors were seated on its back.

It was said that one could cover 9,000 kilometers per day, thus many Heaven Realm warriors desired Blood-feathered Eagles as their mounts.Within an hour, it had already flown out of Yunwu City and entered the boundless wilds.Sitting on the back of Blood-feathered Eagle, Liu Chengfeng winked at Zhang Ruochen as if he had something to say.Zhang Ruochen was a little confused and asked, \u201cBrother Liu, what do you mean?\u201dLiu Chengfeng stared at the woman in a purple dress who sat next to Zhang Ruochen, and then he said in a lower voice, \u201cNinth Prince, did you not even know her?\u201dZhang Ruochen glanced at the girl quickly and shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dLiu Chengfeng was handsome, however, he looked perverted when he laughed. He grinned and said, \u201cHer name is Zi Qian. She\u2019s very famous in Yunwu City. Not only beauty but also her talents for practicing Martial Arts. It\u2019s said that she had already reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm and she will probably become a warrior of the Earth Realm in the future.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere are countless sons of the government officials and the large-scale families want to marry her in Yunwu City. Yet, no one had won her heart. Rumor has it that the Third Prince, your brother, has also followed her but she refused him. Haha! I can\u2019t believe we are going to the School of the Martial Market to take part in the exam together. We may perhaps become classmates, who knows? Well, my Ninth Prince, if you\u2019re not interested in her, I\u2019ll go after her!\u201dAlthough Liu Chengfeng spoke as low as he could, being a young warrior at the Dawn State of the Black Realm as well as sitting next to Zhang Ruochen, Zi Qian heard every single word that Liu Chengfeng had said.Zhang Ruochen felt embarrassed and yet Liu Chengfeng acted like nothing happened. He nodded towards Zi Qian and started a conversation with Zi Qian. \u201cMiss Zi, I\u2019m Liu Chengfeng, son of the Manager of the Martial Market Bank. I\u2019ve long heard of you and you\u2019re just as beautiful as I expected!\u201dIndeed Zi Qian was very gorgeous, with long eyelashes and two crystal big eyes. She had rosy lips like a cherry and a fair body like white jade.The Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan were two beauties in Yunwu City, but they were both so young that they could only be seen as teenage girls who were turning into adults. Zi Qian was different. Her figure was perfection when compared to the Ninth Commandery Princess and Lin Ningshan. Every curve of her body was gorgeous.Zi Qian glanced at Liu Chengfeng and said, \u201cSon of a Manager? Your father is just a presbyter in the Martial Market Bank let alone in the whole Yunwu Commandery.\u201dLiu Chengfeng did not feel any awkwardness then he continued, \u201cI think Miss Zi had a bias against me!\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I just heard something bad about your personality, so I don\u2019t want to make friends with you,\u201d said Zi Qian.She spoke frankly and made the young warriors around them laugh, which made Liu Chengfeng feel as if he had been put out.Be mindful, the number of people who had been turned down by Zi Qian was countless. Some of their identities and talents were more or less the same as Liu Chengfeng. Yet he dared to chase after Zi Qian. He deserved to be humiliated.Withdrawing his smiles, Liu Chengfeng said gravely, \u201cHow dare you humiliate me! I have many attendants in the School of Martial Market, I will lesson you there!\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201dZhang Ruochen cleared his throat and said, \u201cBrother Liu, haven\u2019t you decided to behave yourself?\u201dLiu Chengfeng answered, \u201cNinth Prince, didn\u2019t you hear how she insulted me? How dare she say I\u2019m not a good person and she didn\u2019t want to make friends with me?\u201d\u201cCalm down. If you want to build your reputation again, you have to learn how to control your temper and stop being so explosive. Always reflect on yourself before judging others. I\u2019m sure that if you had behaved well previously, Miss Zi would want to be friends with you,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.\u201cBut\u2026 never mind, I don\u2019t want quarrels with a woman. Listen to your warning, Ninth Prince.\u201d Liu Chengfeng bit his teeth and bowed with his hands to Zi Qian as he said, \u201cSorry, Miss Zi! It was my fault.\u201dZi Qian looked at Zhang Ruochen and nodded. \u201cIt is nice to follow the Ninth Prince\u2019s instruction in the future.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Liu Chengfeng answered.Chen Libing, another killer who was sitting behind Zhang Ruochen, looked calm and said, \u201cSince Mr. Liu is the son of the Martial Market Bank\u2019s Manager, I guess you\u2019re definitely the most familiar with the exam of the School. I wonder if you can tell us more about the exam?\u201dLiu Chengfeng laughed and said proudly, \u201cI surely know a lot more about the School of Martial Market than any of you. To be honest, I\u2019ve been to the School of the Martial Market and practiced there seven times before reaching the Black Realm. I\u2019ve gained a lot each time I visited.\u201d\u201cThere were 103 young warriors of Yunwu Commandery that attended the exam of Martial Market School last year. 28 of them died and 37 were injured and crippled during the exam. Only three warriors had passed the exam and become the external students of the School in the end.\u201dHeard what Liu said, many young warriors took a deep breath since they never expected such high death rate.Liu Chengfeng was rather happy to see everybody\u2019s reaction so he continued, \u201cAfter all, Yunwu Commandery is just an inferior commandery with a population of 80,000,000. There are only over 100 people to attend the exam each time.\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019ve all heard of Square Commandery? It\u2019s a medium level commandery with a population of 300,000,000. A few hundred warriors attend the exam each year. There were 36 warriors who had become the external students of the School of Martial Market last year.\u201dHowever, only 36 warriors had passed the exam in Yunwu Commandery. What a huge gap!A warrior that looked 27 or 28 years old gasped. \u201cIn the Western Nine Prefectures, the Square Commandery is the only medium level commandery equipped with the strongest power. She is five times bigger than Yunwu Commandery.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, commanderies, who are bound to Square Commandery, have always been oppressed.\u201d\u201cTwo years ago, near the Mo River, there was a war between us and Square Commandery, which had plotted to capture a mine that located in Omen Ridge of our Commandery. However, the military force of Square Commandery was five times than ours and she sent 400,000 armies out to defeat us. Unfortunately, that mine had been plundered.\u201d\u201cIt was said that Square Commandery had killed 30,000 of our soldiers, taken away seven cities and captured millions of people of our commandery in that fight. Those people who had become prostitutes and slaves worked at the mine without any sunlight. Some of them were living incredibly poorly and even being bullied by the people from Square Commandery. What a hate!\u201dLooking at Zhang Ruochen who sat aside, Liu Chengfeng said, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t fight back and let Square Commandery take away our mine, we would definitely be oppressed even more in the future.\u201dEverybody signed. They all knew that Yunwu Commandery could not compete against Square Commandery.Even Yunwu Commandery Prince was injured seriously and nearly died in the war two years ago.Based on the size of population, territory, and the number of strong warriors, commanderies could be divided into three levels, ranging from the inferior commanderies, the medium level commanderies to the superior class commanderies.Generally speaking, an inferior commandery had a population of less than 100,000,000.Medium level commanderies had a population between 100,000,000 and 500,000,000.Almost all superior class commanderies had populations of over 500,000,000.Besides population size and territory area, the number of warriors should also be taken into consideration. The more Martial Arts warriors a commandery had, the stronger it was.For example, a commandery could also be thought as a medium level commandery with a population of tens of millions, only if she had a huge number of warriors of the Earth Realm and the Heaven Realm.Liu Chengfeng said, \u201cIt is said that Prince Huo Xing will lead more than 600 warriors of Square Commandery to attend the exam of the School of the Martial Market this year. Square Commandery had been managing to gobble up Yunwu Commandery, I guess they\u2019ll once again suppress our warriors during the exam.\u201d\u201cThey said the reason why so many of our young warriors died in the exam last year was that Square Commandery\u2019s students had targeted on them.\u201dA young warrior said, \u201cNo wonder only three of our warriors passed the exam! Square Commandery suppressed us on purpose!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s said that Prince Huo Xing of Square Commandery is a genius of Martial Arts who had reached the Black Realm at the age of 17. He is at the same time a Tamer who had captured lots of strong beasts.\u201d\u2026While some warriors were discussing Prince Huo Xing, some were worried about the exam of the School of the Martial Market this year.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter all, the examinee number of Square Commandery was 10 times than that of Yunwu Commandery. If they were to suppress Yunwu Commandery on purpose, more Yunwu Commandery\u2019s warriors would die.At this moment, Zi Qian who was sitting next to Zhang Ruochen took a thin needle out of her hair and kept it between her two fingers without any trace.Her body moved moderately closer to Zhang Ruochen.There were altogether 68 warriors riding on the back of the Blood-feathered Eagle. No one would notice that if Zhang Ruochen died under the toxin of the Poisonous Bee Needle. None would know who poisoned him.She was about to stab the needle into Zhang Ruochen!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A heightened sense of alertness then arose in his heart.When one\u2019s Spiritual Power had reached the 30th level or above, he could sense an imminent danger in advance. He could also perceive the blessings and misfortunes of his surroundings.The feeling of uneasiness grew stronger, even Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hairs were standing on end. He stood up reflectively, startling Zi Qian who was sitting next to him. She instantly withdrew the Poisonous Bee Needle from her fingertips and hid them.\u201cPerhaps he sensed it? How is it possible?\u201dZi Qian\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She dared not make a move without planning things through.Chen Libing\u2019s eyes narrowed as he saw Zi Qian not taking any action. A murderous light flashed across his eyes.Hiding his fingers in his sleeves, he ran his Genuine Qi and gathered it between two of his fingers. Quietly, he flicked out a Poisonous Bee Needle without making a sound.Chen Libing was actually sitting right behind Zhang Ruochen, and the distance between them was extremely close.In addition to that, the Poisonous Bee Needle was as thin as a cow hair. Even a warrior of the Black Realm would not be able to follow its flying path with their eyes.If he was hit by the Poisonous Bee Needle, Zhang Ruochen would surely die!However, a shocking reversal happened as Zhang Ruochen extended a hand and caught the Poisonous Bee Needle between his fingers.It was worth mentioning that, up to now, Zhang Ruochen had never turned around. It seemed as though he had eyes on his back. He simply twisted his arm, extended two fingers, and caught the Poisonous Bee Needle with ease.\u201cNo way! Even a warrior at the Completion of the Black Realm couldn\u2019t have sensed the Poisonous Bee Needle at such a short distance, never mind catching it.\u201d Chen Libing seemed shocked to his core.Little did he know, Zhang Ruochen had Space Domain. He was aware of everything in his surroundings within a 10-meter radius, as it would be perceived by his Martial Soul.The instant Zhang Ruochen felt a sense of danger, he quickly stood up and released his Space Domain.Zhang Ruochen held the Poisonous Bee Needle between his fingers and turned around. With a cold glare, his eyes found Chen Libing and said, \u201cPoisonous Bee Needle, no wind, no sound and can kill without a trace. Indeed a deadly poison. Are you a professional killer?\u201dOnce Chen Libing knew his identity had been exposed, he immediately struck again. Holding the sword hilt, he sent a beam of sword radiance flying from his sleeve straight to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart with a lightning speed.Fish Intestines Sword Hidden in Sleeve!The sword was hidden in the sleeve.The blade was as slim as a fish intestine.Even though Chen Linbing\u2019s marital cultivation was only at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, he had once assassinated a warrior of the Dawn State of the Black Realm. He undoubtedly had achieved a high attainment in his sword technique.One strike from his sword shed 13 sword shadows.In a flash, the sword\u2019s cold tip landed right in front of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest.Many people around them could not help but gasp in surprise.Sitting cross-legged on top of the Blood-feathered Eagle, Elder Xie let out a roar and said, \u201cHow dare you!\u201d\u201cSwish!\u201dA streak of Sword Breath flew out from Elder Xie\u2019s hand and went through Chen Libing\u2019s body.A muffled shriek escaped Chen Libing\u2019s throat. His body convulsed into spasms, and he fell flat on the Blood-feathered Eagle\u2019s back.Liu Chengfeng placed his fingers near Chen Libing\u2019s nose, and said solemnly, \u201cHe\u2019s already dead!\u201dEveryone\u2019s gaze immediately turned to Elder Xie.Elder Xie\u2019s cultivation was incredibly strong. With just one strike, he killed a warrior of the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm. Adding to that, there was not a single wound found on Chen Libing\u2019s body, which was very strange.Elder Xie sheathed his sword in its scabbard, cast a cold glance at Chen Libing\u2019s body, and said, \u201cSince he used the Poisonous Bee Needle and Fish Intestines Sword Hidden in Sleeve, he must be a killer from the Hades Department. The Hades Department has long wanted to sneak their killers into the School of the Martial Market. Never thought today I would run into one. Death was too good for him.\u201dThen, Elder Xie\u2019s gaze switched to Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cWho are you? Why would the killer of the Hades Department want to assassinate you?\u201dZhang Ruochen did not even have a chance to reply before Liu Chengfeng blurted out and said, \u201cUncle Xie, he is the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery, also known as the Genius of Martial Arts.\u201d\u201cGenius of Martial Arts?\u201dElder Xie gave Zhang Ruochen a thorough once-over. To have reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm at the age of 16 was indeed prodigious. However, that was far from being a Genius of Martial Arts.The Yunwu Commandery\u2019s Genius of Martial Arts, Elder Xie had only heard of one. That was Yunwu Commandery\u2019s seventh son, who had reached the Black Realm at the age of 12.The Ninth Prince who stood before him was far behind in comparison to the Seventh Prince. In Elder Xie\u2019s opinion, even Zi Qian was more talented than Zhang Ruochen.After giving a final glance to Zhang Ruochen, Elder Xie withdrew his gaze and said, \u201cThrow the body of the Hades Department\u2019s killer off the Blood-feathered Eagle.\u201dElder Xie once again closed his eyes and did not say another word after giving his order.\u201cSo strange, I swear I saw the Sword Breath passing through his body. Why didn\u2019t it leave any wounds?\u201d A warrior asked curiously.Liu Chengfeng said in a scornful tone, \u201cWhat do you know? That\u2019s a martial technique of the low-class Spiritual, known as \u201cHeart Broken Sword Technique\u201d. Plus, Uncle Xie has already mastered this martial technique. \u201cKilling only requires severing the heart, and there will be no blood after death. If you don\u2019t believe me, go and feel the killer\u2019s heart!\u201dThe warrior went to touch Chen Libing\u2019s chest and found that his heart had been shattered into two pieces.Even though Zi Qian and Chen Libing were both genius killers of the Hades Department, there was little interaction between them. Therefore, they had no emotional attachment to each other. Zi Qian made no move and appeared very calm even after witnessing Chen Libing\u2019s death.\u201cLuckily, I wasn\u2019t the first one to launch an attack, otherwise, I would be dead by now.\u201dZi Qian stole a quick glance at Zhang Ruochen. Even until now, she still could not understand how Zhang Ruochen managed to catch Chen Libing\u2019s Poisonous Bee Needle.Normally, only a strong warrior of the Earth Realm would be able to tell the sound of the poisonous needle with their heightened sense of hearing. Also, only a strong warrior of the Earth Realm would be able to dodge the Poisonous Bee Needle sent out by Chen Libing.But, Zhang Ruochen was not a strong warrior of the Earth Realm.He must have some other secrets that no one knew about. She could not afford to make any hasty decision before finding out his secret. If she failed, she would probably share the same fate as Chen Libing and die an unnatural death.For Zi Qian, the most important task was infiltrating the Hades Department\u2019s internal operation. As for killing Zhang Ruochen, of course, if she succeeded, that would be ideal. She would receive a great reward for that. But if she could not do it, it would not be too much of an issue either.If Zi Qian could not kill Zhang Ruochen within a month, the Hades Department would naturally assign another more powerful killer to carry out the assassination.\u201cNow that Chen Libing is dead, my identity is even more secured. I must not let my identity be exposed,\u201d Zi Qian murmured to herself.Chen Libing\u2019s body was thrown off the Blood-feathered Eagle. Upon seeing this, the crowd began to discuss the Hades Department. Many of them wore a serious expression that mingled with fear.In Yunwu Commandery, the Hades Department was part of the Western Nine Prefectures and was one of the biggest assassination organizations. They once successfully assassinated a Commandery Prince. It caused a great uproar at the time, and ever since then, the name of the Hades Department had spread far and wide.Of those who had been targeted by the Hades Department, very few managed to stay alive beyond a month.Liu Chengfeng said, \u201cYour Majesty, don\u2019t worry. Once you enter the School of the Martial Market, even if the killers of the Hades Department have supernatural abilities, they won\u2019t be able to get to you.\u201d\u201cHopefully that will be the case!\u201d Zhang Ruochen smiled and said.If the Hades Department\u2019s killers could sneak into the exams and hide among the candidates, they certainly could infiltrate the School of the Martial Market as well. Zhang Ruochen simply did not believe that he would be safe and sound in the School of the Martial Market.Just before this, the Hades Department\u2019s killer was sitting right behind him but he had no idea. If it was not for the fact that his Spiritual Power had reached level 30 and his practice of Space Domain, he would be a dead person by now.To be able to deploy the Hades Department killers, an immense price must have been paid.Zhang Ruochen knew who it was. The Queen was surely involved in this.\u201cWhen I\u2019ve reached the Heaven Realm, I\u2019ll be sure to settle the score with her.\u201d Zhang Ruochen clenched his fist tightly, a gleam of icing air visible in his eyes.Omen Ridge was an ancient mountain range that stretched more than 120,000 miles. It was a vast territory, rich with Spiritual Qi. It resembled a great dragon, reclining at the north of Yunwu Commandery.Including Yunwu Commandery, the 36 Commanderies were all located on the outside of Omen Ridge. They encircled Omen Ridge like a myriad of stars clustered around a moon.Omen Ridge was the land of savage beasts. There were hundreds of millions of savage beasts within this vast territory. The 36 Commanderies would often send soldiers to guard the border of the Omen Ridge all year round. That was to prevent savage beasts from running out from the Omen Ridge and killing peasants.Some large Suzerains were built along the boundaries of Omen Ridge.For one, it was to prevent the savage beasts from invading the land of humans; for two, it was easier to train their disciples.The School of the Martial Market was also built on the outside.The Blood-feathered Eagle flew its passengers to the School of the Martial Market. The students were dumbstruck as they took in the scenery before them.At first glance, they would see the ground dotted with old buildings. Some were colored glaze towers built in deep valleys; some were garrets built on cliff sides. There were also martial training arenas built on mountaintops.Although they had not yet entered the School of the Martial Market, they could already feel great waves of power.Elder Xie rose to his feet and stood tall on the back of the Blood-feathered Eagle. Withdrawing a token, he called out loudly, \u201cI am Xie Nantian. Who is guarding the array now? Why haven\u2019t you opened the doors?\u201dA young man around 20 years old, who was standing on a two-headed griffin, flew up from the ground and said, \u201cGreetings, Master Xie! How come there are so few candidates from Yunwu Commandery this year? Master Situ has brought over 600 candidates from Square Commandery, and among them are some top martial arts geniuses.\u201dMeanwhile, the young man raised his hand slightly toward the ground, and let out a loud whistle.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe seven colored glaze towers located on different sides of the School of the Martial Market emitted a bright stream of light from their tips. The seven light columns were connected to form a huge array.\u201cBoom!\u201dAt the edge of the array, a door of light, more than 100 meters long, was opened.The Blood-feathered Eagle who was carrying the 67 candidates from Yunwu Commandery went into the door of light, and flew toward the White Stone Square built in a valley.The moment the Blood-feathered Eagle flew into the School of the Martial Market, the light from the tips of the seven towers immediately disappeared. With a bang, the door of light also vanished into the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only if he progressed into a higher realm could he reach the Heart Integrated into Sword Realm.Reaching that realm was no easy task, even some powerful warriors of the Heaven Realm could not make it.In other words, if the Sword Comprehensive of a Heaven Realm warrior could reach the Heart Integrated into Sword Realm, he must be among the top-tier Heaven Realm warriors.\u201cIs this what Yunwu Commandery have for the entrance exam of the School of the Martial Market this year?\u201d A disharmonious voice rang out.A handsome young man came into sight. Seeing Zhang Ruochen, Liu Chengfeng, Zi Qian and other young warriors from Yunwu Commandery, he sneered.A sturdy-looking warrior from Yunwu Commandery was irritated by his comment. The man sank his voice and said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThat spirited young man laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m Shen Mengxi from Square Commandery. No offense, but I think the young warriors of Yunwu Commandery are getting worse every year.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dHearing those words, the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s young warriors all grimaced and crowded around him.Shen Mengxi\u2019s expression remained calm and unaffected. He said with a smile, \u201cAm I wrong? It\u2019s true that young warriors of Yunwu Commandery are getting worse and worse every year. Last year, there were at least 100 students joined the exam. Now, only 60 of you are here, which is less than one-tenth of that of our Square Commandery. Ha-ha!\u201dThe strong and sturdy young warrior from earlier snorted coldly and said, \u201cHow dare you insult our Yunwu Commandery\u2019s young warriors. I\u2019ll challenge you and beat you down with my own hands.\u201d\u201cGreat! If you can take three hits from me, I\u2019ll take back what I\u2019ve just said.\u201d Shen Mengxi laughed.\u201cThree hits? How dare you belittle me like that. You\u2019ll regret such attitude!\u201dWith a loud roar, the Genuine Qi in the sturdy young warrior\u2019s body ran fast and surged into his arms through his meridians.Within seconds, his arms turned scarlet, emitting a faint heat wave.Making his hands into a fist, the sturdy young warrior charged forward and gave a punch. Loud cracking sounds could be heard as the air hissed under the pressure of his punch.A young warrior\u2019s expression flickered briefly before saying, \u201cJiang Heng had reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm three years ago. His Genuine Qi is certainly strong. Plus, his practice of Fire-dragon Fist had reached the Small Success Realm. He can totally fight more than 10 rounds against warriors who have reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.\u201dThat strong and sturdy young warrior was Jiang Heng.It must be noted that all the young warriors who joined the exam of the School of the Martial Market were under the age of 30. Therefore, the cultivations of 70 percent of the warriors were in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. As for the remaining 30 percent, almost all of them were in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.Only a very few young warriors were in the Advanced Stage and the Dawn State of the Black Realm.Among the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s 67 warriors, there was only one warrior who had reached the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm and one for the Dawn State of the Black Realm.That young warrior who had reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm was Zi Qian.The other warrior of the Advanced Stage of the Earth Realm was already 29 years old and had nearly no chance to be a student of the School of the Martial Market. Since he was too old, it was impossible for him to reach the Earth Realm before turning 30.If the external students of the school could not reach the Earth Realm before 30, they would not be able to continue their practice in the School of the Martial Market.Shen Mengxi of Square Commandery had also reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. But surprisingly, he was stronger than Jiang Heng in terms of battle prowess.He waved his arms and released a sword-like Genuine Qi blow which landed directly on Jiang Heng\u2019s chest.\u201cBoom!\u201dJiang Heng let out a scream. He was sent flying backward and fell to the ground with a loud thud.His chest was cut by the Genuine Qi blow, leaving a three-meter-long wound. Two of his meridians had been broken. Crimson blood continuously gushed forth from the fresh wound.Jiang Heng was badly hurt by just one hit. He surely could not continue the exam tomorrow.\u201cHaha! A good warrior from the young generation of Yunwu Commandery couldn\u2019t even take one of my hits. That\u2019s so disappointing!\u201d Shen Mengxi laughed and said.The Square Commandery\u2019s young warriors all laughed after seeing the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s young warrior was easily beaten down by Shen Mengxi with just one strike.\u201cOnly three Yunwu Commandery\u2019s warriors made it to the School of the Martial Market last year. I\u2019m afraid there will be none for this year.\u201d\u201cWith Shen Mengxi\u2019s strength, perhaps he can defeat everyone in Yunwu Commandery.\u201d\u201cIf this continues, Yunwu Commandery will be taken over by Square Commandery very soon. Haha.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked over to Jiang Heng, took out a Saint Stone Pill and gave it to him.The Saint Stone Pill was a Second Class healing pill with a rather strong medical potency. Although it could not help Jiang Heng to regain the two damaged meridians, it could heal his external injury quickly. As long as the meridians were not completely broken, they could still be repaired.After taking the Saint Stone Pill, Jiang Heng\u2019s pale complexion turned better with a hint of red. He said gratefully, \u201cThank you so much, Ninth Prince.\u201d\u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s just a pill.\u201d Zhang Ruochen gave a faint smile and helped him to his feet.\u201cThe Ninth Prince? It\u2019s surprising to see a prince among the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s candidates this year. That\u2019s great!\u201dShen Mengxi\u2019s eyes lit up the moment he heard Jiang Heng\u2019s words. He turned to look at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about the \u2018Innate Skills\u2019, the treasure of Yunwu Commandery. Since the Ninth Prince reaches the Black Realm at such a young age, you must have practiced the \u2018Innate Skills\u2019. Do you mind showing me a little bit?\u201dSeeing that Shen Mengxi was ready to provoke Zhang Ruochen, the Elder Xie, who was standing at the edge of the drill ground of Western Yard, frowned and wanted to stop him.After all, Zhang Ruochen was the prince of Yunwu Commandery. His status was much higher than Jiang Heng. If he was wounded badly before the exam, the School of the Martial Market would have to take full responsibility.Elder Situ stopped Elder Xie. \u201cThese young men are learning from each other by exchanging their martial techniques. Why should we intervene?\u201d He smiled and said in a casual tone.Elder Situ was the receptionist for the Square Commandery\u2019s candidates. He was in a good relationship with Square Commandery; of course, he would defend them.The more Square Commandery\u2019s young warriors enrolled in the School of the Martial Market, the more rewards the receptionist could get from the School.Therefore, every exam of the School of the Martial Market was not only a competition among candidates from different commanderies but also a competition among each receptionist.Elder Xie was displeased and said, \u201cHe is the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s prince. If something bad happens to him, do you think they will just let it go?\u201d\u201cElder Xie, you worry too much. Nothing will go wrong. If it did happen, I would take the responsibility. How about that?\u201d Elder Situ laughed and said.\u201cHumph!\u201dElder Xie snorted coldly and stepped back.Elder Xie did not want to offend Elder Situ because his cultivation was one realm higher. Since Elder Situ had said that he would take the responsibility if anything bad happened, Elder Xie would certainly do him this favor.\u201cThe Yunwu Commandery\u2019s young warriors are indeed too weak. I\u2019m afraid no one can be Shen Mengxi\u2019s opponent.\u201d Elder Xie took a quick glance at Zhang Ruochen and shook his head.\u201cReaching the Black Realm at the age of 16, he is definitely gifted. But he is too young to compete with Shen Mengxi. He is going to lose.\u201d\u201cSince Shen Mengxi knew his status, I think he won\u2019t make it too hard for him. He would just defeat and humiliate him so as to bring down the confidence of the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s young warriors.\u201d Elder Xie thought and sighed again.Having heard that Shen Mengxi had asked Zhang Ruochen to exchange techniques, the young warriors of Square Commandery all laughed. They believed Shen Mengxi was undoubtedly going to win.Prince Huo Xing of Square Commandery, who was standing in the center of the drill with his hands folded behind his back, laughed and said, \u201cShen Mengxi, if you can defeat the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery within three strikes, I will reward you with a Genuine Martial Arm.\u201d\u201cWhy three? I need just one.\u201dShen Mengxi wanted to perform well in front of Prince Huo Xing. He fixed his gaze on Zhang Ruochen again, smiled, and said, \u201cNinth Prince, I believe you\u2019ve heard it. If I defeat you within three strikes, I can get a Genuine Martial Arm. So, I will be fighting with all my strength later. If I ever offend you\u2026\u201dZhang Ruochen interrupted Shen Mengxi and said, \u201cShen Mengxi, I\u2019m afraid you misunderstood the situation. I\u2019ve never said I\u2019d fight with you.\u201dShen Mengxi was briefly stunned before he realized something. Sneering to himself, he thought, \u201cThis Ninth Prince surely knows when to yield. He must be afraid of my powerful cultivation after witnessing the fight from earlier. That\u2019s why he rejects my challenge. Well, how can I let you go?\u201dBefore Shen Mengxi could continue, Zhang Ruochen added on and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not even exam yet. You\u2019ve wounded the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s warrior, you have to pay for his medical expenses. I won\u2019t blackmail you. 30 thousand silver coins as compensation for Jiang Heng, and I will let it slide!\u201dIt was a reasonable price. Zhang Ruochen asked neither more nor less.Shen Mengxi was stunned again.\u201cIs the Ninth Prince joking with me?\u201dAll the Square Commandery\u2019s young warriors burst into laughter. They looked at Zhang Ruochen as if they were looking at a fool. The Ninth Prince was too naive.Liu Chengfeng stepped out and scolded him in a loud voice. \u201cShen Mengxi! The Ninth Prince asked you to take out 30,000 silver coins as compensation. Will you do it or not? If you don\u2019t, do believe I will break your legs.\u201d30,000 silver coins were all Shen Mengxi had. How could he take them all out?Shen Mengxi knew that Liu Chengfeng was once a Warrior of Yellow Board. He knew that he himself could not defeat him. So, he turned to Zhang Ruochen again and said as he sneered, \u201cThe Yunwu Commandery prince turns out to be a coward. He doesn\u2019t even have the courage to fight with me. That\u2019s a huge embarrassment to the Yunwu Commandery Prince.\u201dZhang Ruochen frowned slightly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLiu Chengfeng smiled faintly and said, \u201cShen Mengxi, aren\u2019t you too shameless? You think too highly of yourself. You\u2019ll surely lose even if we were to fight. If so, how dare you challenge the Ninth Prince?\u201dShen Mengxi said in a sarcastic tone, \u201cGreat! If the Ninth Prince can defeat me, I will immediately give 30,000 silver coins to the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s wounded warrior as well as apologize to him. If the Ninth Prince loses, well, how can the strong say sorry to the weak? Doesn\u2019t everyone agree with me?\u201d\u201cShen Mengxi\u2019s right. The strong should never say sorry to the weak.\u201d\u201cIf the Ninth Prince doesn\u2019t even have the courage to fight, he should go back to the Yunwu Commandery Palace and suckle! Haha!\u201dAll the Square Commandery\u2019s warriors jeered and mocked Zhang Ruochen in order to provoke him to accept the challenge. If Shen Mengxi really did beat the crap out of the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s Ninth Prince, it would surely be an interesting show to watch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was stronger than a warrior in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.Now that Ninth Prince had reached the Black Realm, his cultivation must now be on another level. How could Shen Mengxi hope to challenge him?As Zhang Ruochen had only become first on the Yellow Board during the past two months, the news had not yet been spread to other commanderies. Shen Mengxi naturally did not know his true abilities.Young warriors of Yunwu Commandery had curious smiles on their faces, believing Shen Mengxi did not know his own limits. However, no one said anything.Zhang Ruochen stared at Shen Mengxi and said, \u201cSince you wish to fight with me, then I agree. However, if you lose, you will not just pay 30,000 silver coins for your defeat, but 100,000 silver coins instead.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Shen Mengxi asked.Zhang Ruochen replied, \u201cYou had so much shooting your mouth off earlier. You think you don\u2019t need to pay?\u201d\u201cHmph! Never mind 100,000 silver coins. It doesn\u2019t matter even if it\u2019s 1,000,000 silver coins. You have no chance of defeating me!\u201dThe Genuine Qi in Shen Mengxi\u2019s body began to circulate, flowing along his arm towards his palms.He closed his fingers, forming a knife with his hand, and struck at Zhang Ruochen.Palm Knife, a Superior-Class Human Stage martial technique.It was Shen Mengxi\u2019s Palm Knife that had heavily injured Jiang Heng.Just as Shen Mengxi\u2019s Palm Knife was about to stab his chest, Zhang Ruochen suddenly struck out with even higher speed. With a flick of his hand, he struck his palm out and hit Shen Mengxi on the face.\u201cSnap!\u201dA well-landed slap on the face.Shen Mengxi flew out and turned 360-degree turn in the air, before landing on the ground with a thud.The smiles of the young warriors became frozen. They could not believe their own eyes. Many of them did not even clearly see how Shen Mengxi flew out.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s strike was too quick!\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201dPushing the ground with two hands, Shen Mengxi raised his head with difficulty. His mouth was full of blood and the left side of his face began to swell purple and red. His head looked just like a pig\u2019s head.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s strike earlier was very harsh. It knocked out Shen Mengxi\u2019s teeth and broke his jaw and cheekbones.At this moment, Shen Mengxi could not even speak clearly. The wind whistled through the gaps in his teeth.Liu Chengfeng laughed loudly. \u201cGood hit! Shen Mengxi, I told you earlier that you should be aware of your limits. With your training, how could you think of challenging His Majesty Ninth Prince? Now that you\u2019ve lost, hand over the 100,000 silver coins.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Shen Mengxi wanted to cry. He only had 30,000 silver coins in total. How could he hand over 100,000 silver coins?He never thought 16-year-old Zhang Ruochen could be so powerful.Liu Chengfeng\u2019s expression darkened after hearing Shen Mengxi\u2019s words. Walking over, he stepped heavily Shen Mengxi\u2019s hand, causing him to scream like a slaughtered pig.Liu Chengfeng spoke in a threatening tone, \u201cThe fourth son of a seventh-class family, the Shen family, can\u2019t even hand over 100,000 silver coins? Do you think I\u2019m stupid? Before you and His Majesty Ninth Prince dueled, you had personally promised the money. Are you going back on your words? Elder Xie, Elder Situ, both of you heard him earlier?\u201dElder Situ looked uncomfortable. He did not expect Zhang Ruochen to be so strong. He only used one strike to send Shen Mengxi flying! Shen Mengxi was too useless.Elder Xie was delighted. Zhang Ruochen rose in his esteem. But his expression was severe as he said, \u201cI\u2019m a witness to this matter. It\u2019s only natural to repay the money you owe.\u201dLiu Chengfeng\u2019s foot remained on Shen Mengxi\u2019s hand. He smiled. \u201cDid you hear? It\u2019s perfectly justified to repay your dent. If you don\u2019t hand over 100,000 silver coins, do you think I won\u2019t break your legs right here and now?\u201dShen Mengxi was truly terrified. He knew that Liu Chengfeng was a brutal man that could do anything. He hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I have the money\u2026\u201dShen Mengxi quickly drew a purple pouch from his chest and handed it to Liu Chengfeng with trembling fingers.Liu Chengfeng opened the pouch and saw 30 Spiritual Crystals and a few hundred silver coins inside.He closed the pouch and kicked hard at Shen Mengxi. \u201cWhere\u2019s the 100,000 silver coins? There are clearly only 30,000 silver coins here. How dare you cheat me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I dare not\u2026 Those are all I have. It\u2019s everything I own\u2026\u201d Shen Mengxi begged for mercy.Liu Chengfeng handed the pouch to Zhang Ruochen. \u201cYour Majesty, he only has this many silver coins. What do we do now?\u201dZhang Ruochen accepted the purple pouch and glanced at Shen Mengxi.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dLiu Chengfeng seemed to understand Zhang Ruochen\u2019s thoughts. He nodded at him and walked towards Shen Mengxi with a wicked smile.\u201cUnderstand? What did you understand? I haven\u2019t even said anything yet!\u201dZhang Ruochen was speechless. He looked towards Liu Chengfeng and wanted to know what he had understood.Liu Chengfeng believed that he had made a correct guess about Zhang Ruochen\u2019s thoughts. Thus, he stopped in front of Shen Mengxi and took away the Genuine Martial Arms grade weapon on his back.\u201cThis sword has 12 lines of inscriptions. It can be more or less considered a fourth class Genuine Martial Arms weapon. I\u2019ll take 10,000 silver coins for it!\u201dShen Mengxi cried. \u201cThat\u2019s a fourth class Genuine Martial Arms weapon and I spent 20,000 silver coins for it\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201dLiu Chengfeng trampled on Shen Mengxi\u2019s hand again, and took his jade belt off. \u201cSea Stone Jade belt, worth 800 silver coins.\u201d\u201cSecond level Genuine Martial Arms chest-protecting mirror, worth 2,000 silver coins.\u201d\u2026Liu Chengfeng took away all of Shen Mengxi\u2019s treasures, even his clothing, and shoes.\u201cWe\u2019ll consider it\u2019s 20,000 silver coins in total. You still owe the Ninth Prince 50,000 silver coins. You can write an IOU!\u201dLiu Chengfeng ripped off the last of Shen Mengxi\u2019s clothes and bit his forefinger, forcing him to write a bloody IOU.\u201cThis\u2026 was what he had understood?\u201dZhang Ruochen found him both funny and annoying. No wonder Liu Chengfeng was considered brutal; his tactics were too extreme.He could only sigh to himself that the wicked would be punished for their deeds.For people like Shen Mengxi, he would learn his lessons only when extreme methods were used.Huo Xing, Prince of Square Commandery, looked extremely severe. \u201cEnough! Ninth Prince, your methods are too extreme. Shen Mengxi is a warrior of Square Commandery. Even if he owes you 100,000 silver coins, how can you humiliate him like this?\u201dZhang Ruochen felt puzzled. From the very beginning, it was Liu Chengfeng who was humiliating Shen Mengxi. Why did they pin the blame on him?Liu Chengfeng folded the IOU and handed it to Zhang Ruochen. He said in a low voice, \u201cYour Majesty, you should be careful! Prince Huo Xing was a warrior of the Yellow Board when he was in the Yellow Realm. Now he has cultivated to the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, and he wields an imperial weapon. He\u2019s a difficult and sly enemy.\u201dZhang Ruochen naturally was not one to be afraid of conflicts. Taking a step forward, he said, \u201cPrince Huo Xing, do you mean that only the Square Commandery warriors can humiliate the Yunwu Warriors? Are we not allowed to retaliate?\u201dPrince Huo Xing laughed coldly. \u201cThe strong can naturally humiliate the weak.\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled. \u201cSince it is so, then what\u2019s wrong with us humiliating a warrior of Square Commandery?\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re triumphant at this moment, so what? Tomorrow is the examination. I will return this humiliation with interest. This year, no warrior from Yunwu Commandery will successfully enter the School of the Martial Market.\u201d Prince Huo Xing swept his gaze across the tens of Yunwu warriors opposite him with a cold huff.A cold gaze flashed through Prince Huo Xing\u2019s eyes. He already had the intention to murder Zhang Ruochen.Afterwards, two warriors from Square Commandery carried Shen Mengxi away.Liu Chengfeng looked at the retreating warriors from Square Commandery and said, \u201cThe situation doesn\u2019t look good! Looks like we\u2019ll be in great danger during the exam tomorrow.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cIs killing allowed in the exam?\u201dLiu Chengfeng replied, \u201cOn the surface, the warriors are of course not allowed to kill each other. But every year the first round of the examination takes place in Omen Ridge. Warriors from Square Commandery will definitely try and assassinate us.\u201dStanding on the side was Zi Qian. Holding her battle sword, she watched the warriors from Square Commandery, and asked coldly, \u201cIf they can try and kill us during the exam, why can\u2019t we return the favor?\u201dZhang Ruochen turned slightly and glanced at Zi Qian.He knew that Zi Qian\u2019s cultivation was very high and she had already reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm. But he did not expect that, as a woman, she would have such a hard side to her. It was rare to see.Liu Chengfeng chuckled and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to strike, you\u2019ll naturally be able to kill many of the Square Commandery warriors.\u201dZi Qian glanced at Liu Chengfeng and turned towards Zhang Ruochen. \u201cNinth Prince, if you\u2019re willing to work with me, we\u2019ll definitely destroy the warriors from Square Commandery. All the humiliation Yunwu Commandery has suffered all these years should be returned.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZi Qian wanted to assassinate Zhang Ruochen. Naturally, she had to get close to him and gain his trust. Only when she found Zhang Ruochen\u2019s secret would she have the chance to kill him.Zhang Ruochen looked like he was deep in thought.Liu Chengfeng once again inserted himself before Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian. \u201cLady Zi, you shouldn\u2019t underestimate the young warriors from Square Commandery. According to reliable news, they have at least three strong warriors at the Dawn State of the Black Realm, and at least 10 warriors in the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm. If you go head-to-head with them, it\u2019d be like attacking a rock with an egg.\u201dZi Qian used her sword to push Liu Chengfeng to the side, appearing very cold. Looking at Zhang Ruochen with her beautiful eyes, she waited for him to speak.Zhang Ruochen rubbed his chin. Looking at Zi Qian, he smiled. \u201cSince Lady Zi has such courage, I\u2019ll naturally accompany her to the end. Tomorrow on the examination field, it\u2019s time for Square Commandery to pay the price!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: The Exam Begins Translator: Transn Editor: TransnIn the Western Nine Prefectures, there were seven more commanderies besides Yunwu Commandery and Square Commandery.Before dark, the warriors from the seven other commanderies were brought in and led to the drill ground of Western Campus. Each made their own camps away from the others.The seven other commanderies were like Yunwu Commandery in that they were inferior commanderies. Some only had about 10 young warriors, while others had a few hundreds.The number of young warriors joining the examinations naturally demonstrated the power of each commandery.\u201cIn the entire Western Nine Prefectures, only Square Commandery is a medium level commandery, which is also the most powerful. Almost half of the young warriors here are from Square Commandery,\u201d Liu Chengfeng said.Zhang Ruochen looked around at the young warriors in the drill ground of Western Campus and estimated there were about 1,500 warriors or so. All of them were martial artists of the Black Realm.Each person in the drill ground was a prodigy in their commandery. No one was a weakling.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhy are there only warriors from the Western Nine Prefectures? Why don\u2019t we see warriors from the South, East, or North Nine Prefectures?\u201dLiu Chengfeng laughed. \u201cThe Martial Market Bank has four campuses. The South, North, East, and Western Campus all examine their students individually. We, the warriors of the Western Nine Prefectures, can only enter Western Campus and become external students of this campus.\u201d\u201cAfter your cultivation has reached the Earth Realm and you\u2019ve become an internal student, you can then engage with the internal students of the other three campuses.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and stopped asking. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the floor and began Practicing.He fixed his gaze on the characters for \u201cDrill Ground of Western Campus\u201d carved onto a rock from a distance, feeling the aura of Sword Comprehension emitting from the carving. He used it to guide his meditation to understand the Realm of Heart Integrated into Sword.Tonight, all the warriors from the Nine Prefectures would have to spend the night on drill ground of Western Campus.Most warriors were sitting cross-legged on the floor, absorbing the Spiritual Qi. They were adjusting themselves in preparation for the examination tomorrow.The next day, when the sky had only just brightened, three ear-splitting chimes rang through the School of the Martial Market.Those who were practicing or sleeping were all shocked awake by the chimes.They only saw a seven feet tall stage in the middle of the drill grounds, where 10 warriors of very powerful cultivation were standing. One of the elders wore a golden robe, while the other nine were in silver robes.The nine warriors clad in silver robes were those who went to the nine prefectures to lead the examinees to the school. All of them were elders of the School of the Martial Market.Liu Chenfeng spoke quietly. \u201cThe Martial Market Bank has a strict hierarchical system. People of different ranking wear different clothing. Only the elders of the Martial Market Bank can wear silver robes. As for the golden robed elder\u2026 only Headmaster of Western Campus can wear it.\u201dHeadmaster of Western Campus was the golden robed elder of the Martial Market Bank.As for Elder Xie, Elder Situ, and Liu Chengfeng\u2019s father, they were all silver robed elders of the Martial Market Bank.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cIf we enter the School of the Martial Market, what color are our robes?\u201d\u201cPlain white robes.\u201d Liu Chengfeng smiled.Headmaster of Western Campus stood on the seven feet tall stage. The robe he was wearing began to emit a golden light as bright as the sun. Many of the warriors could not open their eyes.It was clear that his golden robe was not a simple piece of clothing.Headmaster of Western Campus looked over the entire drill ground, giving off an immense sense of power. \u201cThere are altogether 1,537 warriors in Western Nine Prefecture taking the exam this year. The exam is divided into two rounds, \u2018Hunting Savage Beasts\u2019 and \u2018Breaking Through the Wu Tower\u2019. The 120 will be admitted as external students of the School of the Martial Market in the end. Elder Situ will now announce the specific exam rules.\u201dHe left after making his speech.Liu Chengfeng let out a breath and smiled. \u201cThank God, the exam is the same as the past years.\u201dLiu Chengfeng had prepared beforehand and was very confident in this exam.Even though Liu Chengfeng was the son of a silver robed elder, he must still pass the exam to join the School of the Martial Market.Of course, given his identity, he would be privy to many internal workings of the exam and was able to prepare beforehand. This gave him a better chance than the other warriors.\u201c1,537 examinees and only accepting 120 students. That\u2019s not even 10%. Given my cultivation, I probably won\u2019t make it.\u201d A warrior of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm gasped. He had already lost hope to pass the exam this year.On the stage, Elder Situ bowed to Headmaster of Western Campus. He took a step forward and faced the young warriors below. \u201cThe examination for the School of the Martial Market has always been fair and just. We only accept talented prodigies. Even if your cultivation is slightly below average, you\u2019ll have a chance to pass the examination as long as you\u2019re sufficiently talented.\u201dThose warriors, who had already lost hope, regained their fighting spirits upon hearing these words and gazed towards Elder Situ.Elder Situ continued, \u201cIn half an hour, you\u2019ll enter Omen Ridge. You\u2019ll only be entering the outside boundaries in a specially marked zone. All savage beasts level three or above have already been removed from this zone.\u201cThe first round of the Market School exam is hunting savage beasts. Initial Stage warriors of the Black Realm who can hunt down five low-class second level beasts will pass the first round.\u201cMid-level Black Realm warriors will need to hunt down 10 low-class second level savage beasts to get a pass.\u201cWarriors of the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, 20 low-class second level savage beasts.\u201cDawn State warriors of the Black Realm, 40 low-class second level savage beasts.\u201cIf there are Medium State warriors of the Black Realm, then you\u2019ll have to hunt 80 low-class second level savage beasts to pass the first round of the exam.\u201cOne medium-class second level savage beast equals five low-class second level savage beasts; one superior-class second level beast equals 25 low-class second level beasts.\u201dElder Situ stood above and announced the rules. Below him, the young warriors were all discussing among themselves.One woman in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm smiled. \u201cWe only need to hunt five low-class second level beasts to pass the first round? That\u2019s too easy!\u201dAnother warrior gave a cold laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re underestimating them! The savage beasts of Omen Ridge have long lived in harsh conditions. Not only do they have to fight human warriors, they also have to fight with other beasts for food. They\u2019re much more powerful than savage beasts elsewhere and at least twice as strong. Each low-class second level beast has the same power as an Initial Stage Black Realm warrior. It\u2019ll be very difficult to kill even one, much less five.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cNot only are there low-class second level savage beasts in Omen Ridge, there are also mid- and superior-class second level beasts. If we run into any superior-class beasts, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll survive.\u201dSuperior-class second level savage beasts were even more powerful than warriors who have reached the Completion of the Black Realm. Even if it was Zhang Ruochen who ran into one, it was most likely a death sentence.Everyone turned pale.Liu Chengfeng smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone. The zone marked by the School is massive. Unless you\u2019re unlucky, you\u2019ll probably not run into one.\u201dAn Initial Stage Black Realm warrior said with frustration, \u201cIf I meet even one medium-class second level beast, it\u2019s all be over for me.\u201dThe admission exam for the School of the Martial Market was cruel. Not only did one have to avoid strong beasts, he or she will also have to watch out for other warriors in case of sabotage.Elder Situ continued to announce the rules. \u201cBefore entering Omen Ridge, each person will be given a Kylin Ball. If you meet a life-threatening situation, break the Kylin Ball and the rescue personnel from the School will arrive as soon as possible. Of course, once you break the Kylin Ball, it means you\u2019ve forfeited the exam.\u201d\u201cThe exam will be three days long. Anyone who hasn\u2019t killed the required number of beasts will be disqualified after the third day.\u201d\u201cNow I declare the exam has officially started.\u201dEveryone was handed a fist-sized Kylin Ball. It was said that the ball contained Kylin Smoke. Once the ball was broken, the smoke would rush out of the ball and rise thousands of meters into the air.At this moment, Elder Xie, along with 10 external students of the School of the Martial Market, approached the 66 examinees from Yunwu Commandery.Yunwu Commandery originally had 68 examinees. Chen Libing was killed and Jiang Heng was wounded heavily and sent back to the commandery. Now only 66 examinees remained.Elder Situ said, \u201cThe 10 standing before you are external students of the School of the Martial Market. They\u2019re also your brothers and sisters in training. They\u2019ll lead you to separate entrances to enter Omen Ridge.\u201cYou can now choose to enter Omen Ridge alone or you can team up.\u201dEntering either as individuals or a group had its pros and cons.Entering as a group of two meant that when danger struck, you had someone to help you out. However, at the same time, you had to keep an eye on your teammate to make sure he or she would not backstab you.Therefore, one must choose someone he or she trusted to form a group.But everyone came from different places and many had never met each other before. Therefore no one knew who to trust.\u201cI choose to enter Omen Ridge alone!\u201d a Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm said.Clearly, he did not trust anyone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFollowing that, the warriors of Yunwu Commandery all made their choices. Most of them decided to enter Omen Ridge alone. Only 22 people chose to form groups. Among them were Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian.Under the leadership of the 10 students, the 66 warriors from Yunwu Commandery walked towards Omen Ridge.Prince Huo Xing stared at the departing Yunwu Commandery warriors. He sneered. \u201cEveryone, listen up. After entering Omen Ridge, kill every warrior from Yunwu Commandery you meet without hesitation. For each person you kill, I\u2019ll reward you with a second-class pill. If you can kill the Ninth Prince, I will reward you with a Genuine Martial Arms grade weapon.\u201dHearing Prince Huo Xing\u2019s words, the warriors from Square Commandery all smiled coldly.If they were able to kill all the warriors from Yunwu Commandery, it would probably enrage the Yunwu Commander. It was amusing just thinking about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although they were only in the outskirts of Omen Ridge, they still could hear the roars of savage beasts.1,537 warriors disappeared into the ridge within moments, like sand scattered into the ocean.\u201cYou are a warrior in the Dawn State of the Black Realm. You need to kill 40 inferior-class level-two savage beasts to pass round one. Are you not at all in a rush?\u201d Zhang Ruochen placed his hands behind his back, walking on the fallen leaves. He glanced towards Zi Qian who was in front of him.Zi Qian had a tall figure. Both of her hands were holding her sword, and her eyes were on the surrounding ancient, towering trees. \u201cHow tiring would it be to kill 40 savage beasts? Wouldn\u2019t it be faster to kill warriors of Square Commandery and steal their Beast Eyeballs?\u201dZhang Ruochen looked steadily at Zi Qian and said, \u201cYou must know, this area of the ridge is huge, and everyone is scattered in all directions. It will not be easy to find warriors of Square Commandery.\u201dZi Qian replied, \u201cI have my ways!\u201dSuddenly, Zi Qian\u2019s ears moved a little.With a swish, she became a purple shadow and flew out, crossing a distance of 100 meters.SWISH!Her arm shook, and a streak of sword light flew from her hand, striking with great force into the ground.Under the ground, there came a beast\u2019s terrified cry.A fountain of blood spouted from the earth.Just as the fresh blood was about to stain her hand, her fingers twisted, and she changed her pace. Moving like floating clouds and flowing water, she returned her sword to her scabbard.The entire process happened in mere seconds.Sword out, strike, and sword returned, all in the time it took to take a breath. No flourishes, perfectly executed.Zhang Ruochen squinted and stared at Zi Qian. Her sword technique was already at the Intermediate Stage of the Sword Following the Heart, not far from the Advanced Stage!\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen stomped on the ground, sending his Genuine Qi into the ground. With a boom, the earth split open. The body of an Iron Shell Rat about the size of a basin rose from the ground.The Iron Shell Rat was an inferior-class level-two savage beast. Its entire body was covered in scales and it had 10-centimeter-long teeth that were as sharp as knives. It had a huge appetite and could eat an entire living person in one sitting, so it was known as a Death Rat.If a normal warrior of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm met an Iron Shell Rat, it was likely that before they could even react, the Iron Shell Rat would sneak up on them and bite their legs off.For a warrior, if both their legs were broken, it was pretty much a death sentence. It would be impossible for them to escape.Zi Qian\u2019s sword managed to pierce through the Iron Shell Rat\u2019s neck arteries. It was extremely precise.\u201cHer hearing is incredible. She\u2019s able to hear the Iron Shell Rat from 100 meters away beneath the ground.\u201d Zhang Ruochen indeed found this difficult to believe. He raised his alertness subtly. Zi Qian\u2019s background was not common, and she was definitely not a normal warrior.Without rigorous training, a warrior of the Dawn State of the Black Realm would not have such incredible hearing.\u201cEveryone has their secrets, it\u2019s no big deal. Your Majesty, since you are the one who could catch a Poisonous Bee Needle, you must also have secrets you cannot tell?\u201d Zi Qian casually probed with her question.Zhang Ruochen naturally could not tell her about the Space Domain, so he only smiled lightly and nodded gently.\u201cSwish!\u201dZi Qian\u2019s sword swept out and removed the Iron Shell Rat\u2019s two eyeballs. She used a 10-centimeter-long box to store the eyeballs.It must be remembered, a warrior of the Dawn State of the Black Realm needed to kill 40 inferior-class level-two savage beasts to pass through this exam.The warriors would not be able to carry the bodies of 40 beasts. They could only take out the eyes and use those as proof of their kills.Zi Qian then removed from within the Iron Shell Rat a walnut-sized piece of Spiritual Brawn.It only weighed half a kilogram. It was snow white, and crystal clear. It had no scent of blood, rather, it carried a very light fragrance.She hefted the Spiritual Brawn and looked towards Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cMy cultivation has already reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm, eating a half-kilo of Spiritual Brawn won\u2019t help me much. Here, you have it!\u201dFinishing her sentence, she handed the piece of Spiritual Brawn to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen did not refuse. He took the Spiritual Brawn and swallowed it straight away.After consuming the Spiritual Brawn, it was very quickly absorbed.Zhang Ruochen felt his spirit becoming full, his body felt energetic, and all the Meridians inside him widened. Even the flow of his Genuine Qi increased in speed a little.Zi Qian walked ahead. She walked and talked. \u201cFor a warrior who has just reached the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, consuming about two kilograms of Spiritual Brawn will allow them to break through to the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.\u201d\u201cYou were able to rank first in the Yellow Board while you were in the Yellow Realm, your Body of the Martial Arts must be far beyond that of those in the same Realm as you. If you want to break through a Realm, you will need to burn through more resources. You probably need three kilograms of Spiritual Brawn to be able to break through to the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.\u201dZi Qian assumed Zhang Ruochen had only just cultivated the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. She did not know that Zhang Ruochen had already reached the peak of the Initial Stage.Zhang Ruochen estimated, according to his current Realm, he would need to consume at least five kilograms of Spiritual Brawn to be able to break into the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.His Body of the Martial Arts was far more powerful than Zi Qian believed.Suddenly, Zi Qian stopped and gently bent down. Stretching out two slender fingers, she picked up a broken leaf and placed it under her nose to smell it. Delight spread across her face. \u201cThis is the scent of a warrior of Square Commandery. A quarter of an hour ago, he passed by here. This leaf was stepped on and crushed by him.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cYou have studied the Tracking Occult Arts?\u201d\u201cA little,\u201d Zi Qian replied.Zhang Ruochen asked again, \u201cHow do you know the scent of a warrior from Square Commandery?\u201dZi Qian answered, \u201cLast night, while you were all practicing in the drill grounds, I snuck into the camps of the warriors from Square Commandery and memorized all 667 warrior\u2019s scents.\u201d\u201c667 people\u2019s scents, and you can tell them all apart? Even a warrior of the Heaven realm does not have this ability,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.Zi Qian asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cUnless you are the descendent of a Saint, and have saintly blood in your veins, you could only have such incredible hearing and sense of smell after rigorous training.\u201dZi Qian said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. One of my ancestors was a Saint. It is unfortunate that after they passed away, our family soon fell into ruin. Now, there is only me in this clan.\u201dZi Qian\u2019s words were both lies and truths.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Zhang Ruochen nodded his head gently.If Zi Qian really was a descendent of a Saint, she could indeed cultivate a special physique and possess some supernatural abilities. It would not be so strange then.Zi Qian and Zhang Ruochen sped forward, trying to catch up to the warrior of Square Commandery.Zi Qian\u2019s cultivation was at the Dawn State of the Black Realm and so naturally she was very fast, reaching a speed of 36 meters every second.What she did not expect was that Zhang Ruochen was not much slower than her. He could reach speeds of 34 meters per second, and followed closely behind her.\u201cSo fast. Only an Initial Stage warrior of the Black Realm and already so fast. If he reached the Dawn State, he would definitely be faster than me.\u201d Zi Qian thought to herself.A normal warrior at the Dawn State of the Black realm could run at about 36 meters per second. Zi Qian was actually much faster than the usual Dawn State warriors, but she held back in front of Zhang Ruochen and did not run as fast as she could have.Very quickly, they caught up to the young warrior.That warrior was currently battling an inferior-class level-two savage beast.Zhang Ruochen slowed his pace and looked ahead. \u201cIndeed, it is a warrior of Square Commandery. His cultivation has already reached the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, he is definitely a strong opponent.\u201dZhang Ruochen seemed to recognize the young warrior. He was one of the elite warriors of Square Commandery.Zi Qian\u2019s five senses were indeed very powerful, much stronger than those of normal people.Zhang Ruochen had to use the power of his Martial Soul and extend the Space Domain to be on her level.The battle ended quickly. The warrior chopped through the Silver Dragon-lion\u2019s neck with one move and removed the beast\u2019s eyeballs.The warrior from Square Commandery held the eyeballs and with delight on his face said to himself, \u201cAnother pair of eyeballs. With this Silver Dragon-lion, I have already killed three savage beasts.\u201dAbruptly, he sensed something. He quickly put the eyeballs away, hefted his Third-class Genuine Martial Arms grade weapon, and called out. \u201cWho\u2019s there? Come out immediately!\u201dZhang Ruochen stepped out.The warrior of Square Commandery saw Zhang Ruochen and his face overcame with delight. Laughing he said, \u201cIs that the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery? Haha! This is great, I didn\u2019t think my luck would be so good.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cIs there a need to be this happy seeing me?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, you have no idea! Prince Huo Xing has set a price for your head. If someone brings him your head, he will reward them with level-five Genuine Martial Arms. Now you know how valuable you are, don\u2019t you? Now you know why I\u2019m so happy?\u201d The warrior of Square Commandery smiled.Zhang Ruochen frowned slightly and said, \u201cAre you so confident that you can kill me?\u201dThe warrior of Square Commandery gave a loud laugh. \u201cYou can defeat Shen Mengxi with one strike, but I can kill him with one strike. You must know, I\u2019m a warrior at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm.\u201dZhang Ruochen replied, \u201cOK, let\u2019s battle!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not running away? Since you are so confident, then I will show you the difference between an Initial Stage warrior of the Black Realm and one at the Advanced Stage.\u201dThe warrior of Square Commandery concentrated his Genuine Qi into his sword, immediately triggering five lines of inscription. The flat of the sword glowed with fire.He cut the air with his sword and a wave of heat billowed out, causing the leaves on the ground to be whipped into the air.\u201cPhew!\u201dThe leaves caught fire, like fire rain caught in the void space.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPieces of the fiery leaves joined together and became a giant dragon, surging towards Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen held one hand behind his back, and used his other hand to collect a thick layer of Genuine Qi. Striking out once, he pushed out an invisible wave of Qi.\u201cBrute Elephant Return to Field!\u201dIt was Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm, the third strike.Affected by the power of the strike, the leaves on the ground flew up and circled in the air. Hundreds and thousands of leaves joined together to form a five-meter-tall brute elephant, which charged forwards furiously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had sustained severe internal injuries. He could feel the Spiritual Blood flowing inside him, like a huge hammer thumping him on the chest.Zhang Ruochen, however, stood calm and still, with ease. Not even a fringe of his garb was damaged.\u201cIt can\u2019t be! A warrior in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm can\u2019t be this powerful!\u201d The warrior from Square Commandery clenched at his chest, staring at Zhang Ruochen in disbelief.Zi Qian appeared behind him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know he once ranked first in the Yellow Board in Yunwu Commandery? Ignorance is also a crime.\u201d\u201cAnother powerful warrior?\u201dThe warrior\u2019s face changed color, and one word came to him.Flee!He immediately used a body martial technique. He stepped on the ground with his soles and dashed out suddenly. His speed reached 32 meters per second.But Zhang Ruochen was even faster! He soon overtook the warrior and attacked him with one finger on his spine.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe warrior gave out a shrill cry and fell to the ground.\u201cYou\u2026 you destroyed my Mid-heaven Meridian\u2026\u201d Lying on the ground, the warrior shivered all over and stared at Zhang Ruochen with strong hatred.If a warrior\u2019s Mid-heaven Meridian was destroyed, he would never make further progress in his cultivation. In other words, he could be seen as a half-wreck from now on.\u201cPuff!\u201dZi Qian beheaded the warrior with a slash. Red blood gushed out of his neck.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at Zi Qian. \u201cHe would have been disqualified from being in the School of the Martial Market, because I destroyed his Mid-heaven Meridian. He was no longer a threat to us. I don\u2019t see the necessity of killing him!\u201dZi Qian put her sword back with a cold look. \u201cSince he could practice into the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm at such an age, there must be some sort of strong power supporting him behind the scenes. If he survived, he would seek revenge.\u201dZhang Ruochen could not respond to that.To be honest, Zi Qian had done nothing wrong. But Zhang Ruochen still believed the warrior\u2019s death was completely unnecessary. The destruction of his Mid-heaven Meridian was a serious punishment for any warrior.Zi Qian searched the warrior\u2019s body and found 21 Spiritual Crystals, 500 silver coins, and a box with Beast\u2019s Eyeballs in it.She opened the box. Then her pretty face beamed with delight. \u201cSix Beast\u2019s Eyeballs! That\u2019s three inferior-class level-two savage beasts.\u201dZi Qian put the box away immediately. Then she glanced at Zhang Ruochen and asked, \u201cYou are a prince, so I assume you aren\u2019t hard up?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll take all the Spiritual Crystals and silver coins!\u201d Zi Qian did not stand on ceremony and put the 21 Spiritual Crystals and 500 silver coins in her bag.Zhang Ruochen was a little curious and asked, \u201cAre you hard up?\u201dZi Qian said seriously, \u201cEven a warrior with high talent can\u2019t become powerful without Practice resources. But the resources cost a lot of money. Of course, a lofty prince like you who has never lacked any resource since birth, can\u2019t understand the importance of money.\u201d\u201cYou can take his war knife.\u201dZi Qian kicked the war knife, a Third-class Genuine Martial Arm, towards Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen caught the war knife unceremoniously and put it away in his Spatial Ring.Zi Qian was slightly astonished seeing his ring. She stared at it and asked, \u201cA spatial treasure?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dZhang Ruochen simply told her the truth. \u201cYes. I can give it to you if you like it.\u201dZhang Ruochen took the white phoenix-carved ring off and passed it to Zi Qian. He said with a smile, \u201cTo be honest, there are too many decorative patterns on this Spatial Ring. It suits women more!\u201dZhang Ruochen felt nonchalant about it. It was just a semi-finished Spatial Ring. He did not love it dearly. He could make a new one anyway.But to Zi Qian, a spatial treasure was priceless and extraordinarily rare.\u201cHe could give it to me? For free! Was the Ninth Prince so short-sighted?\u201dZi Qian stared at Zhang Ruochen intensely and found a gentle smile on his face. It seemed that he meant it from the bottom of his heart.Zi Qian glanced at him coldly and did not take the Spatial Ring. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that men can\u2019t give women rings at will?\u201dAfter saying this, Zi Qian walked up to the Silver Dragon-lion and dug about a kilogram of Spiritual Brawn out.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand stretched halfway in the air. He felt a little surprised at first, and then he laughed. \u201cI want to give it to you simply because you are carrying too many things. It will be easier to store them in the Spatial Ring. What are you thinking about? I\u2019m only 16. How can I have any other intentions?\u201dZi Qian\u2019s look grew even colder. She threw the Spiritual Brawn to Zhang Ruochen, and then stretched out a hand. She said, \u201cPass me the space treasure.\u201dZhang Ruochen took the Spiritual Brawn and handed the Spatial Ring to Zi Qian.\u201cHow does it work?\u201d she asked.\u201cJust transfer your Genuine Qi into the ring,\u201d he replied.Zi Qian transferred her Genuine Qi. A layer of white light began to glow immediately on the Ring\u2019s surface.She put her hand into the ring and found that the internal space was not that big, only the size of a small house. It was different from the legends, which said you could put mountains, even heaven, and earth in these treasures.But it was enough for putting away some personal belongings.Naturally, Zi Qian liked the Spatial Ring very much and hated to part with it. She glanced at Zhang Ruochen with her beautiful eyes and asked, \u201cWhat will you use if you give it to me?\u201d\u201cI have others!\u201dWith a gentle smile, Zhang Ruochen took all the things in the Spatial Ring out, and put them into the Spatial Crystal\u2019s internal space.Zi Qian took the Spatial Ring again and started to put all her belongings into it. Soon, she had nothing on her hand but a phoenix-patterned jade ring.\u201cThis is indeed a spatial treasure! How wonderful!\u201d The more Zi Qian looked at the ring, the more she liked it.She took out 30 Spiritual Crystals from the Spatial Ring and handed them to Zhang Ruochen. \u201cI won\u2019t have it for free,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, take these.\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head, \u201cIf I wanted to sell it, I\u2019d sell it for at least 200 Spiritual Crystals.\u201dZi Qian\u2019s face became cold. She looked at the Spatial Ring. \u201cIf that\u2019s the price, I won\u2019t take it.\u201dZhang Ruochen laughed. \u201cIf I wanted to sell it, of course, you\u2019d have to pay me that much. But now, I want to give it to you, so you don\u2019t have to pay me even one silver coin.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dZi Qian flashed her pearl-white teeth. \u201cOkay! I\u2019ll take it! But why must you give me such an expensive treasure?\u201dZhang Ruochen kept walking ahead. \u201cBecause we hit it off,\u201d he said blandly.Zi Qian asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry that I\u2019ll kill you and rob you of your other treasures?\u201dZhang Ruochen glanced at her. \u201cMost people don\u2019t return kindness with ingratitude. After all, there are more good people in this world than bad. I just don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be so unfortunate to meet a bad person\u2026 What are you doing?\u201dNobody knew when Zi Qian\u2019s sword was drawn from the sheath and pointed at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s neck. If she struck a little bit forward, Zhang Ruochen would lose his head.But Zhang Ruochen stared at Zi Qian calmly.He secretly transferred his Genuine Qi into the Vessel of Spirit, which formed a 10-meter Space Domain.If Zi Qian ever dared to do anything, Zhang Ruochen could kill her faster.Zi Qian, however, was not conscious of the Space Domain. She stared at Zhang Ruochen closely with a struggling look, and then put her sword away. \u201cI just want you to know, you are too naive! People are dangerous, and one should always guard against the harm others might do. I suppose this is your first time practicing outside the palace?\u201dSeeing Zi Qian put her sword away, Zhang Ruochen scattered the Space Domain as well. He simply said, \u201cYes.\u201dZi Qian was speechless. She did not feel like talking to him about it anymore, so she said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep hunting the warriors from Square Commandery!\u201dStaring at Zi Qian\u2019s receding figure, Zhang Ruochen rubbed his chin and smiled. \u201cHer movement is exactly the same as Chen Libing from Hades Department. Only professional killers can train their hearing and smell to such an extent. I was right. She is also a killer from the Hades Department.\u201dHow could Zhang Ruochen be naive when he was a man who had already died once?He was on guard against her when she got close to him intentionally. The only thing he wasn\u2019t sure about was whether she came from the Hades Department or not.After constant probing, Zhang Ruochen was finally sure of her identity.But even knowing the truth, Zhang Ruochen wasn\u2019t frightened at all. He saw it as a kind of experience.\u201cMiss Zi! Wait for me! Don\u2019t be so fast!\u201dZhang Ruochen trotted after her.The first round of the exam would take three days.Before the first day darkened, Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian met another two warriors from Square Commandery. Needless to say, Zi Qian killed them both.Beast\u2019s Eyeballs, Crystals, and silver coins were taken by Zi Qian.All the weapons and Pills were taken by Zhang Ruochen.\u201cIt\u2019s night. We can finally have a good rest,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZi Qian rolled her eyes at Zhang Ruochen. \u201cMost warriors will do the same as you at night. They will find somewhere safe and prepare to sleep. This is the perfect time to hunt them down. We need to kill at least twenty warriors from Square Commandery tonight to finish the task.\u201d\u201cTask? What task?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.\u201cIt\u2019s the task we set for ourselves,\u201d Zi Qian replied. Square Commandery robbed Yunwu Commandery of our mines, and even seven of our cities. Countless soldiers and people died brutally. Don\u2019t you want revenge for them? What\u2019s more, Prince Huo Xing said publicly that he will kill you one day. Don\u2019t you want to kill him? Don\u2019t you want to teach Square Commandery a lesson?\u201dZhang Ruochen could not respond to that at all.After a while, Zhang Ruochen finally replied, \u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2026 puff\u2026\u201d\u2026The warriors from Square Commandery intended to kill those from Yunwu Commandery as a cruel lesson. They were killed, however, by two mysterious warriors first.A foul wind and a rain of blood came overnight.No matter how secretly-hidden a warrior was, he would be eventually found out and slaughtered with Zi Qian\u2019s outstanding Traking Occult Arts and smelling.By midnight, Zi Qian had already killed eight warriors. Blood dyed her purple outfit red.Zhang Ruochen did not mind killing, but he would not easily kill someone who did not deserve death.\u201cI\u2019ve killed eight. There are 12 to go.\u201dHolding her bloody sword, Zi Qian was ready to hunt more.\u201cLook out!\u201dZhang Ruochen caught her by the shoulder and dragged her three meters backwards.\u201cSwish!\u201dA purple Thunder Arrow pierced through the void and crashed into a weighty stone.With a huge \u201cBoom!\u201d, the stone burst into pieces.If Zhang Ruochen had not dragged her away, that stone might have been her head.Zi Qian was cold and sweating. She glanced at Zhang Ruochen with gratitude, and looked up from where the Thunder Arrow came. She said, \u201cWhat splendid arrow technique! They almost managed to kill me. Among all the young warriors in Square Commandery, there is only one person who can do this. He\u2019s Feng Zhiyi, from the Feng family.\u201dThe Feng\u2019s were one of the eight seventh-class families in Square Commandery. They settled where archery was famous in the Nine Western Prefectures. The Feng\u2019s were known as The Family of Archery.Feng Zhiyi was one of the top prodigies among the Feng family. He was only 24 years old, but he had already reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm. What\u2019s more, his archery also reached the Intermediate Stage of Following the Mind.Among all the young warriors in Square Commandery, there were only three who have reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm.A man\u2019s voice came from the dark. It said, \u201cWell, you deserve to be called the top one among the younger generation in Yunwu Commandery, because you know it is me. But the Ninth Prince surprises me more. I am really curious, how did you sense me in the dark?\u201dFeng Zhiyi was astonished, because few could escape from his arrow in the same realm.Moreover, it was a sneak attack just now.Of course, Zhang Ruochen would never tell Feng Zhiyi how powerful his Spiritual Power was.Zhang Ruochen released his Space Domain and covered the 10-meter surrounding area with it, in case Feng Zhiyi shot another Thunder Arrow. He said, \u201cOf course you can\u2019t shoot us, because you are so bad at archery.\u201d\u201cYou are the first one to laugh at our family\u2019s archery! Don\u2019t you know that during the Mohe Battle two years ago, it was my grandfather who injured your father, the Yunwu Commandery Prince, with Deer Threatening Bow and Stele Breaking Arrow? Haha!\u201d laughed Feng Zhiyi. \u201cUnfortunately, he missed a little bit, or your loser father could have been a dead man!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s look became stone-cold. He said, \u201cLooks like you are quite proud of it?\u201dFeng Zhiyi laughed and said, \u201cOf course! Our generous king granted us a city for injuring the Yunwu Commandery Prince. There are over all 80,000 slaves in it!\u201cYou know, that city originally belonged to Yunwu Commandery, and the 80,000 slaves once were the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s people. If we destroy you completely, our family will get more rewards. At that time, even you will become a slave in our family. If I asked you to bark, you wouldn\u2019t even dare to say a human word.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cDo you want to irritate me and find my weakness?\u201d\u201cHaha! So what? You can\u2019t even kill me!\u201d laughed Feng Zhiyi.Zhang Ruochen replied, \u201cThat being the case, I\u2019ll kill once today.\u201d\u201cSwish!\u201dZhang Ruochen took out the Flash Shinning Sword, and rushed into the dark woods at an extremely fast speed.In only one breath\u2019s time, Zhang Ruochen found Feng Zhiyi who was hidden in the dark.Of course, Feng Zhiyi didn\u2019t think Zhang Ruochen could be this fast. He was a little surprised, but quickly drew his bow and shot three times.It was the unique martial technique of the Feng family, Triple Cloud-splitting Arrows, which was in the Superior Class of the Human Stage.Three Thunder Arrows dashed out like three streams of purple light.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dZhang Ruochen struck three times as well. Three shadows appeared in the air, and then the three Thunder Arrows were all knocked away.\u201cNo!\u201dFeng Zhiyi was very confident of his archery. Even a warrior at the Medium State of the Black Realm could not survive all three arrows at such a close distance.Zhang Ruochen, however, didn\u2019t hide. Rather, he knocked them all away.Zi Qian just arrived, and she was also shocked by the scene. Even for a powerful warrior like her, she couldn\u2019t guarantee she would survive all three arrows at 20 meters.Of course, they knew nothing about Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Space Domain. When the three arrows came into it, Zhang Ruochen could easily see their flight paths, so it was not that hard to knock them away.After knocking away the arrows, Zhang Ruochen did not stop but kept rushing toward him.In a single instant, Zhang Ruochen came to be right in front of Feng Zhiyi. He stretched his arm straight out and stabbed.Zhang Ruochen burst out the Sword Comprehension at the Advanced Stage of Sword Following the Mind. It looked like he was possessed by the god of sword, and a strong radiance about two meters high shined from his blade.Feng Zhiyi knew he had no chance of using the Thunder Arrow now, so he used his bow as a weapon and struck towards Zhang Ruochen.After all, he was a warrior in the Dawn State of the Black Realm. There was no way he would be afraid of a warrior in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm.\u201cBoom!\u201dThey were both shaken backward due to the clash of their weapons.Feng Zhiyi looked at his scratched wrist. He slightly changed color and said, \u201cWhat an outstanding sword technique! If I were a warrior at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, my arm would have been chopped off.\u201d\u201cYour family took our city, but now I\u2019ll send your family\u2019s prodigy to hell,\u201d said Zhang Ruochen.Feng Zhiyi sneered and said, \u201cMy grandfather almost killed your father. Who do you think you are? I was only a little inattentive just now. The battle begins, now.\u201dThe word \u201cnow\u201d had just finished, and Feng Zhiyi spat a silver thin needle from his mouth.The silver thin needle flew towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart unexpectedly.One had no chance to survive if the needle pierced the heart.But who could he have known Feng Zhiyi had a needle in his mouth?Any other warrior, even another warrior in the Medium State of the Black Realm, would have been killed by this ambush.But Zhang Ruochen was not any other warrior. When the needle came into the Space Domain, Zhang Ruochen sensed the danger and blocked it with his sword.The needle flew backward and scratched Feng Zhiyi\u2019s neck, leaving a shallow blood stain.Feng Zhiyi touched his wound, and became even more surprised. He said, \u201cDid you just block my Archery Tongue?\u201dArchery Tongue was a technique that allowed a person to shoot weapons from their mouth with their tongue. It could be very surprising, and it could kill people while talking.Archery Tongue was a secret technique of the Feng family. It was said that no one had ever survived it, and many warriors with higher cultivations than the users were killed by it.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn!\u201cSacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen stepped out and stabbed!The gorgeous radiance was split into seven, like a plum blossom blooming in the void.Feng Zhiyi quickly stepped back. But no matter how hard he retreated, the seven streaks of radiance kept approaching him like shadows.Feng Zhiyi finally panicked. He widened his eyes and said, \u201cThe Spiritual Stage\u2026 How can you\u2026\u201d\u201cPuff!\u201dSeven Sword Breaths pierced Feng Zhiyi\u2019s glabella, penetrated his head, and flew away from the back of his head.A small, bloody plum blossom appeared on his glabella. Seven drops of blood overflowed from there, looking like one stamen and six petals of a plum blossom.Zhang Ruochen put away his Flash Shinning Sword. He walked towards Feng Zhiyi\u2019s standing body, and touched his body with his sword scabbard.\u201cBoom!\u201dFeng Zhiyi\u2019s body fell flat to the ground.Staring at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back not far away, Zi Qian let out a long sigh. After a long while, she finally said, \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t kill!\u201dZhang Ruochen replied, \u201cHe would kill me if I didn\u2019t kill him. What else can I do? What\u2019s more, you heard him, he asked for it. This is not my fault.\u201dZi Qian said, \u201cYou are in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, but you can kill a warrior in the Dawn State of the Black Realm. If you don\u2019t get yourself killed, with your talent, you can definitely become a Warrior of Division Profound one day.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cIn fact, I won because Feng Zhiyi was an archery master. He had the advantage in long range combat, but not in short range combat. In short range combat, he could only be seen as a warrior at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm.\u201dZi Qian nodded. She was also confident that she could kill Feng Zhiyi in three movements in short range combat.\u201cFeng Zhiyi was a top prodigy of the Feng family, and they have spent a huge amount of money in cultivating him. They have great expectations for him. Now that he has died in an exam of the School of the Martial Market, the older generations in his family will fly into a rage,\u201d said Zi Qian.Zhang Ruochen squatted and found a small box from Feng Zhiyi\u2019s body. There were eight Beast\u2019s Eyeballs in it, which equaled to four inferior-class level-two savage beasts.\u201cI need 10 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs to pass this exam. Now there are only two to go.\u201d Zhang Ruochen smiled. He did not suffer from psychological trauma after his first killing.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s psychological predisposition was even stronger than many warriors in the Heaven Realm.Later on, Zhang Ruochen found 32 Spiritual Crystals and one two-star VIP card.One had to save 100,000 silver coins in the Martial Market Bank to get a two-star VIP card.\u201cHe was indeed a genius from a seventh-class family. Look at how rich he was!\u201dBut there was no use in simply getting this card, because the owner had to drip a drop of blood on it to unlock the special Prohibition.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnly when the Prohibition was unlocked could the owner draw money from the Martial Market Bank.There was no use in collecting Feng Zhiyi\u2019s blood now. After all, Feng Zhiyi was dead, and his blood would lose its essence of life very soon. But without blood activity, the Prohibition couldn\u2019t be unlocked.Seeing the two-star VIP card, Zi Qian said, \u201cFeng Zhiyi\u2019s lineal relatives\u2019 blood may unlock the Prohibition! According to what I know, one of his brothers is practicing as one of the external students of the Martial School. He is also a prodigy.\u201d\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll take it with me!\u201d Zhang Ruochen put the two-star VIP card away.For him, 100,000 coins was not a small fortune.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: Green Devil Hand Translator: Transn Editor: TransnGrievances ran deep between Yunwu Commandery and Square Commandery. Warriors of both places were natural enemies and held grudges.While Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian went on their killing spree of warriors from Square Commandery, warriors of Yunwu Commandery were also being hunted down by those from Square Commandery.Eventually, even other commanderies were involved.At dawn of the second morning, Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian found a female body floating in a small creek. The body was naked, covered in bruises, and there were spots of blood on her legs. It was clear that she had suffered inhumane humiliation while she was alive.The fatal wound on her body was on her neck; a small cut had been made on her arteries. Fresh blood continuously flowed out, dying the creek red.The air held the scent of blood.\u201cSuch a brutal way to kill someone.\u201d Zhang Ruochen pulled his brows together tightly, feeling anger ignite in his chest.He waded into the small creek and carried the body onto the shore.He also recognized this female. She was the daughter of one of the elite families in Yunwu Commandery. Her cultivation had reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm and was highly talented. It was likely that she would have made it through the examination.Zi Qian had long become used to murder and said, \u201cThis style of killing should be that of the prodigy of the Qing family from Square Commandery. Also, there are definitely remnants of his scent!\u201dZhang Ruochen was not familiar with the warriors of Square Commandery and so asked, \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u201cQing You. He is considered the most outstanding prodigy of the Qing family in the last hundred years. At age 15, he reached the Completion of the Yellow Realm. At 16, he became a Warrior of the Yellow Board, and at 17, he broke into the Black Realm. And now, he is only 21 and has already reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm.\u201dZi Qian continued, \u201cRumor has it, he has cultivated a dark power that can absorb the Genuine Qi from women\u2019s bodies. That is why his cultivation increases so quickly.\u201dZhang Ruochen closed the woman\u2019s eyes and buried the body near the creek. \u201cThere are only three warriors from Square Commandery who have reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm. I can\u2019t believe we would meet another one so quickly!\u201dZi Qian asked, \u201cDo you want to kill him?\u201dZhang Ruochen replied, \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYou should know that Qing You is not the same as Feng Zhiyi. He\u2019ll be difficult to defeat.\u201dZi Qian continued, \u201cAlthough Feng Zhiyi was a prodigy, he is miles worse than Qing You. Qing You\u2019s cultivation has reached the peak of the Dawn State. Even warriors of the Medium State of the Black Realm are not his equal.\u201dFeng Zhiyi had just broken through the Dawn State, while Qing You had already reached the peak. The difference between the two was not usual.Zhang Ruochen looked serious. He looked around and said, \u201cDanger is coming close.\u201dZi Qian\u2019s ears twitched and her face changed. She drew her sword immediately and adopted a defensive pose. Staring into the forest, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been ambushed.\u201d\u201cHaha! You are very aware. I didn\u2019t expect you to discover it so quickly!\u201d A clear laugh rang out.\u201cSwish!\u201dPrince Huo Xing flew out on the back of an inferior-class level-two savage beast, a green-shelled eagle, circling above Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian.He stood arrogantly on the back of the green-shelled eagle, staring down at the two people below and said, \u201cYou two are quite incredible. There were at least 15 warriors of Square Commandery that died at your hands last night, right?\u201dZhang Ruochen raised his head slightly to glance at him and asked, \u201cHow did you find us?\u201d\u201cTap tap!\u201dFootsteps rang out.From the forest, out walked a man with a cold face. Wearing a red robe and holding a foot-long, curved machete, he laughed coldly and said, \u201cOnce we found the first person you killed, do you think it would be difficult to catch up to you? Haha!\u201dZi Qian stared at the man in the red robe, and her eyes darkened. \u201cQing You.\u201dQing You\u2019s mouth curved up slightly. His gaze slid up her body before landing on her beautiful face. He leered and said, \u201cWhat an exquisite specimen with a high cultivation. If I can absorb the Genuine Qi in your body, perhaps I can break through to the Medium State.\u201dZi Qian\u2019s gaze chilled and said coldly, \u201cSince you\u2019ve already laid an ambush, then show yourself, everyone!\u201d\u201cSwish!\u201dFrom the forest, there was a chain of rustling.In a flash, another seven streaks of human shadows flew out. Among them, three were at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, and four at the Initial Stage.The seven young warriors all stood at different positions, blocking all of Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian\u2019s escape routes.Prince Huo Xing stood on the back of the green-shelled eagle and laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you break the Kylin Ball? Do you think you still have a chance to live?\u201dZhang Ruochen immediately sent out his Space Domain, sweeping his eyes across the nine people present. His heart sank a little.Qing You\u2019s fighting force itself was more powerful than both Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian combined. It would be as difficult as climbing to the heavens if they wanted to defeat him.Not to mention that Prince Huo Xing, who was circling in the sky, was more or less as powerful as Qing You. He could strike at Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian anytime and send them scrambling.Other than that, there were another seven Black Realm warriors who had already blocked Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian\u2019s escape routes. They did not even have a way to escape.Prince Huo Xing laughed. \u201cEven if you did break the Kylin Ball and send up the Kylin Smoke, no one will come to save you. The external student guard of this section is a young prodigy of Square Commandery. I have already had a chat with him, and so even if he does see Kylin Smoke, he will not come.\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cPrince Huo Xing has thought of everything. I guess we must die today?\u201dQing You\u2019s gaze became lecherous. Shaking his head and smiling, he said, \u201cNo! Your Majesty, only you will die without a doubt. As for that beauty in purple, it would be a shame to kill her. Haha!\u201dA Mid Stage warrior nearby leered and smiled, saying, \u201cMr. Qing, after absorbing her Genuine Qi, you must let us brothers have some fun.\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201dZi Qian turned into a deadly purple shadow. Moving at 40 meters per second, she charged with her sword towards the Mid Stage warrior.Be mindful, a normal Initial Stage warrior could only reach 36 meters per second.Only warriors of the Medium State could erupt to the speed of 40 meters per second.It could be said that Zi Qian was truly angry. She demonstrated her fastest speed and aimed to kill the warrior with one strike.Qing You huffed coldly. He moved even faster, reaching 44 meters per second, surpassing the speed of a warrior in the Final State of the Black Realm.He was like a ghost appearing before Zi Qian.He extended a green hand. His palm was covered with green scales, grown as if it was the claw of a savage beast.\u201cClap!\u201dQing You\u2019s hand-claw was as strong as iron clashing against Zi Qian\u2019s sword and sent up a giant shower of sparks.\u201cBoom!\u201dQing You closed his fingers and caught hold of Zi Qian\u2019s sword bare-handed.Zi Qian\u2019s countenance changed and tried to pull back the sword immediately. But Qing You\u2019s fingers were like iron and held tight to the sword. No matter how much strength Zi Qian exerted, she could not move his claw.\u201cGreen Devil Hand!\u201d Zi Qian called.Qing You laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right! It is indeed the low-class Spiritual martial technique \u2018Green Devil Hand\u2019. I have already practiced this and have a little success. Swords will not pass, and flames will not melt.\u201dZi Qian immediately gave up her sword and pulled back.Qing You moved even faster. Stretching out his hand, he tried to grab her neck. A green shadow of his hand appeared in the air, striking together towards Zi Qian\u2019s neck.A breath of poisonous wind spread out from Qing You\u2019s hand-claw. It gave off a slight stench of blood.Zi Qian bent and dodged Qing You\u2019s claw. Her hands hit the ground and a pair of long legs kicked out, landing a blow on Qing You\u2019s chest.\u201cBoom!\u201dQing You took the kick from Zi Qian and retreated three steps back. However, he was not injured. Rather, he gave a crazy laugh, ran his tongue across his lips, and said, \u201cHow interesting!\u201dZi Qian immediately picked up her sword and began to circulate the Genuine Qi in her body, triggering the eight lines of inscription in the sword.The surface of the sword began to glow with a pale light and gave off a bone-chilling aura.\u201cStrong Wind and Flying Snow!\u201dZi Qian\u2019s arms moved continuously, her sword drawing circles in the air and creating a strong wind. An endless stream of cold air spread from the sword. There were particles of frost appearing in the air.The particles of frost continued to grow bigger, merging into flakes of snow.\u201cSpiritual Stage Sword Technique!\u201dQing You\u2019s eyes became very grim and yelled loudly. \u201cGreen Devil Hand!\u201dQing You became a green shadow, flying as straight as an arrow towards Zi Qian\u2019s sword circle.With a bang, the green devil\u2019s hand suddenly attacked the tip of the sword, emitting a gust of Qi billow.Zi Qian let out a muffled yell. Her sword flew from her hand, falling into a small creek.\u201cBoom!\u201dQing You\u2019s strike landed on Zi Qian\u2019s right shoulder, sending Zi Qian flying over 10 meters away.In mid-air, she spat out a mouthful of blood and her face turned very pale. She had taken heavy internal damage.\u201cHaha!\u201dQing You opened his mouth and laughed, and once again rushed forward. He grabbed Zi Qian\u2019s ankle with one hand, wanting to trap her.At this moment, Zhang Ruochen appeared in a flash from behind Zi Qian. Wielding the Flash Shinning Sword, he struck towards Qing You\u2019s glabella.\u201cSacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dQing You sensed the danger and immediately released Zi Qian\u2019s ankle. With a light smile on his face, he extended his hand to block the sword in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand.Suddenly, Zhang Ruochen changed his strike, switching from piercing to chopping, calling out loud, \u201cSacred Guiding Sword.\u201dA streak of Sword Breath, 10 meters long, flew out from the sword. In a flash, it was chopping towards Qing You.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQing You\u2019s eyes narrowed. Immediately holding out both hands, he concentrated all his Genuine Qi on his palms.A green ball of Genuine Qi gathered between his hands.\u201cGreen Devil\u2019s Cry.\u201dHe sent out the green ball of Genuine Qi and created in front of him a green fog, clashing with the streak of Sword Breath.Zhang Ruochen felt a great wave of power coming towards him and immediately held up his sword to block it, but still flew out seven meters from the powerful hit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The blood that flowed out was green and carried a deadly toxin.\u201cHaha! Your Highness certainly has unexpected depths. You managed to slice open my Green Devil Hand. Very interesting, truly quite interesting!\u201dQing You circulated the Genuine Qi in his body and threads of Qi seeped out of his pores. They melded into a green light and enveloped both of his arms.The green light flowed towards his hands.Shortly after, the cut inflicted by Zhang Ruochen healed at a rate visible to the naked eye.\u201cVery powerful self-healing!\u201dZhang Ruochen remained aware of Qing You while he looked towards Zi Qian and asked, \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201dZi Qian\u2019s face was white and a trickle of blood stained the corner of her mouth. The most serious injury was on her right shoulder.Qing You\u2019s palm contained a deadly toxin. It had burned a handprint into her clothes. The skin showing below was turning a green-purple color.\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Zi Qian gritted her teeth, with coldness rife in her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s work together and kill our way out. I\u2019ll keep Qing You occupied while you go get rid of the other seven warriors. I can, at most, hold Qing You off for 10 strikes, so you must kill the seven people before that. After that, we will work together to defeat Qing You. Only this way will we have an opportunity to escape.\u201dZhang Ruochen saw Zi Qian\u2019s face grow even paler and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Qing You. You go to kill the other seven.\u201d\u201cNo! Qing You won\u2019t kill me. That\u2019s why I can hold him for 10 strikes. But Qing You will definitely kill you. Forget 10 strikes, you will die at his hands within five strikes,\u201d Zi Qian said.\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure!\u201dZhang Ruochen flashed a smile at Zi Qian. One hand lifted the Flash Shinning Sword while the other removed a long, black spear from the Space and Time Spinel.This long, black spear was taken from the hands of a warrior of Square Commandery. It was a level-four Genuine Martial Armament.Moving into his paces, Zhang Ruochen charged towards Qing You at his highest speed.At the same time, Zi Qian also started attacking. Crossing the creak in a single step, she struck one warrior of the Initial Stage of the Black Realm in the throat.That warrior\u2019s throat caved. He vomited blood and immediately collapsed into the creek.In a flash, Zi Qian attacked another warrior.Qing You stood on a two meter tall stone, staring at the charging Zhang Ruochen. He smiled delightedly and said, \u201cPerfect! I\u2019ll kill you first! Then I\u2019ll ravage that beauty.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see if you have that ability!\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied.Qing You stared at Zhang Ruochen and said dismissively, \u201cA sword in one hand and a spear in another, do you think you can multitask? If you can\u2019t, using two weapons will actually be a disadvantage in a battle.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see once you try me!\u201d Zhang Ruochen challenged.While Zhang Ruochen and Qing You were talking, Zi Qian had already killed two people in a row and was charging towards the third.Qing You stopped wasting time talking to Zhang Ruochen. Jumping down from the giant rock, he prepared his Genuine Qi and slapped one hand against the rock.The rock, weighing over 10,000 pounds, flew towards Zhang Ruochen.He could not retreat. He must delay Qing You.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s gaze sharpened. He circulated the Genuine Qi within his body, triggering four of the Inscriptions of Power series on his Flash Shinning Sword. The weight of the sword became 200 kilograms.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen swung his sword and chopped straight down.The giant stone was split open, flying off to both sides.\u201cHaha!\u201dQing You flew out from behind the stone, grinning. He aimed a strike at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head.It must be noted, Zhang Ruochen had already activated the Space Domain. Naturally, he knew Qing You was behind the giant rock. When Qing You struck, Zhang Ruochen preemptively attacked with his spear, aiming it towards Qing You\u2019s chest.Qing You did not think Zhang Ruochen would react so quickly. He had no choice but to withdraw his attack and instead strike at the long spear.\u201cBoom!\u201dQing You was very strong, with one strike he knocked the long spear aside.After that, Qing You turned, his body suddenly moving like a poisonous snake. He followed the spear, getting closer towards Zhang Ruochen. He stretched out two fingers to stab at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s throat.Two green fire sparks spouted from the extended fingers.It must be noted that Qing You\u2019s speed was at 44 meters per second while Zhang Ruochen could only reach 34 meters per second.From Qing You\u2019s perspective, his fingers would definitely strike Zhang Ruochen\u2019s throat.But, just at this moment, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s sword struck. Coming up from the bottom, it was directed at Qing You\u2019s throat.If Qing You wanted to strike Zhang Ruochen\u2019s throat, his own throat will certainly be pierced. The final result would be death on both sides.Qing You frowned slightly, again forced by Zhang Ruochen to retreat. \u201cHow is this possible? Your speed and strength are both no match for mine. How can you continuously avoid my killing strikes? Perhaps you really can multitask and simultaneously control the sword and the spear?\u201dZhang Ruochen held a sword in one hand and a spear in the other and said, \u201cI told you earlier. It won\u2019t be that easy if you want to kill me!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s speed indeed could not be compared to Qing You\u2019s, but he had the help of the Space Domain. Once Qing You came within 10 meters of him, Zhang Ruochen could clearly see Qing You\u2019s next moves. He was completely able to move one step ahead and block Qing You\u2019s killing strikes.At this moment, Zi Qian had already killed three people.\u201cThen let\u2019s see how many strikes you can block.\u201dQing You was angry. Both of his arms turned a dark green color. He executed a Superior-class Human Stage martial technique. He became three green shadows and charged towards Zhang Ruochen simultaneously.A normal warrior would not be able to tell which of the shadows was Qing You\u2019s true person.Once the three shadows had come within 10 meters of Zhang Ruochen, he could see clearly that all three shadows were the true person. Only, Qing You was moving too fast and using a mysterious step, causing it to appear that he had become three people.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s sword struck out and blocked the first shadow.Another blow blocked the second shadow.When the third shadow approached, Zhang Ruochen blocked it with both spear and sword. It was another mutual death strike, forcing Qing You to retreat again.\u201cBoom!\u201dFrom a distance, it appeared that Zhang Ruochen was standing in the same place, continuously striking out with sword and spear and battling three Qing You at once.They had exchanged more than 20 strikes, yet Qing You was unable to defeat Zhang Ruochen.Prince Huo Xing was standing on the back of the Green-Shelled Eagle. He looked down at the battle disappointedly and said. \u201cLooks like I will have to do it myself!\u201dPrince Huo Xing raised the Silver Bone Crescent Bow and drew out a golden Carriage Breaking Arrow. He drew on all the Genuine Qi in his body, pulling the 300-pound bow into a full moon instantly and making it creak.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the battlefield, the Carriage Breaking Arrow could destroy a 30-man chariot.Prince Huo Xing stared at the Zhang Ruochen who was battling Qing You. His mouth revealed a small smile, and he pointed the arrowhead at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back, \u201cNinth Prince, farewell!\u201dHis finger relaxed, and the Carriage Breaking Arrow flew out.\u201cWhew!\u201dThe arrowhead caught alight, like a flaming meteorite.

He coldly huffed and said, \u201cMind your own business!\u201dHe wanted to personally kill Zhang Ruochen, not have him be killed by Prince Huo Xing.Since Prince Huo Xing has intervened, Zhang Ruochen was definitely going to die.Qing You pushed off the ground with his toes, becoming a green shadow. He flew off, retreating far away.Naturally, Zhang Ruochen felt the Carriage Breaking Arrow streaking through the air. All the hair on his body stood on end like a hedgehog, a chill went down his spine, and his scalp tingled. It felt like the sky was crashing down.\u201cIce-fire Kylin!\u201dZhang Ruochen felt Genuine Qi rush through 36 Meridians, all flowing towards the Ice-fire Kylin Armor he was wearing. Almost instantly, he triggered 10 lines of inscription within the Kylin Armor.Ice-fire Kylin Armor was a level 6 Genuine Martial Arm. There were 38 lines of inscription in the Armor. However, with Zhang Ruochen\u2019s current martial cultivation, he could only activate 10 at most.\u201cSwish!\u201dThe armor on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body emitted red and blue light, spreading both cold and heat energy.The roar of a Kylin emanated from within the armor and a seven-meter tall illusory image of a Kylin appeared. It shielded Zhang Ruochen with its body.\u201cBoom!\u201dCrashing into the illusory Kylin, it was clear that the force of the Carriage Breaking Arrow weakened slightly as well as slowing down.By the time the Arrow had made it to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back, 90 percent of its power had been depleted, and only 10 percent was left.Even this 10 percent of power was terrifying. It managed to send Zhang Ruochen flying into a nearby tree, which was one meter in diameter. The impact caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood.Luckily the arrow was blocked by the armor. Otherwise, Zhang Ruochen would have been impaled.\u201cThe Carriage Breaking Arrow is so powerful! It\u2019s at least 10 times stronger than the Thunder Arrow.\u201dZhang Ruochen used his sword and spear to hold himself up and spat out another mouthful of blood.Prince Huo Xing stood on the back of the Green-Shelled Eagle holding the Silver Bone Crescent Bow. He softly exclaimed and said, \u201cIce-Fire Kylin armor! I had no idea he was wearing such a treasure, this is amazing! Qing You, kill him, and take the Kylin armor from him.\u201dQing You let out a cold laugh and walked towards Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cEven the arrow couldn\u2019t kill you. Looks like I\u2019ll still have to do it personally.\u201dZhang Ruochen glanced slightly at Zi Qian. She had already killed five of the Warriors of the Square Commandery. If he could delay just a little longer, she would be able to kill all seven.\u201cI\u2019m leaving first, see you never.\u201dZhang Ruochen turned and ran like an agile monkey. In a flash, he disappeared into the forest.Escaping into the forest not only drew out time, it also provided a little cover against Prince Huo Xing. This prevented him firing another Carriage Breaking Arrow.\u201cEscape? In your dreams!\u201dQing You chased after Zhang Ruochen, rushing into the forest at a speed of 44 meters per second.As Zhang Ruochen could only move at 34 meters per second, he had no speed advantage. In a few seconds, Qing You had caught up and the two resumed their duel.Qing You removed a foot long hooked knife from a bag at his waist, reminiscent of a scythe. He moved his fingers and the scythe rotated in the air, creating tens of knife shadows with a 'swish\u201d sound.\u201cA hit!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s clothes were sliced open at the chest. Luckily, it did not pierce through the Ice-fire Kylin Armor. Zhang Ruochen was fortunate it had blocked the scythe as otherwise, his chest would definitely be bleeding from the cut.\u201cHeh heh! Your Highness can go die!\u201dQing You was as fast as a ghost and there was a cruel smile in his eyes. With a wave of his arm, the cold, curved blade slashed towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s neck.At this critical moment, all of the Genuine Qi within Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body moved towards the Vessel of Spirit Meridian, communicating with the Martial Soul.The space in front of Zhang Ruochen shimmered slightly.It seemed as if Qing You\u2019s curved knife was about to slice open Zhang Ruochen\u2019s throat. But, because of the small spatial distortion, the trajectory of the knife changed slightly. It had sliced in front of Zhang Ruochen but did not touch his body.This was one of the powers of the Space Domain, called the Space Warp.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Qing You hesitated briefly, feeling as if his eyes had played a trick on him and somehow Zhang Ruochen managed to survive.At that brief moment Qing You hesitated, Zhang Ruochen struck with his sword and pierced through his left arm.\u201cPfft!\u201dQing You let out a muffled cry, his teeth clenched as he kicked at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest and sent him flying back.At the same time, Qing You was retreating rapidly. His left arm was in great pain and blood poured down it. In just a moment, half his body was numb.\u201cUnbelievable, you actually pierced through the Meridian of my left hand!\u201dQing You\u2019s eyes were filled with rage. He had not expected to be harmed at the hands of a warrior at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm.Even though he had remarkable self-healing powers, he was unable to reconnect the Meridians in his left hand in so short a time.At this moment, Zi Qian walked out from the forest. Holding a bloody sword, she stood behind Qing You.She had already killed the other seven warriors. The fresh blood drenched her clothes, causing it to stick to her body. It outlined her curves, hugging her slight waist, and outlining her long legs. Her black hair was also dripping with crimson blood.Clearly she was a figure of great beauty, but right now she seemed more like a messenger of death, her whole body radiating murderous feeling.Qing You laughed coldly and said, \u201cEven if I only have one hand, it will still be easy to kill both of you.\u201dFrom the air came Prince Huo Xing\u2019s voice. \u201cQing You, I will give you a hand.\u201dPrince Huo Xing drew out a flute. Infusing his Genuine Qi into the flute, he began to play a melodious tune.Following the sound of the flute, a rustling came from the forest. A fist-sized poisonous bee flew out, straight towards Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian.A medium-class level-one savage beast, a Poisonous Bee.Once poisoned by the Poisonous Bee, a warrior would have hallucinations.If poisoned by three of them, a warrior would be in life threatening danger.Even a warrior in the Dawn State would die within a quarter of an hour, if stung by five Poisonous Bees.Although the Poisonous Bee was only a medium-class level-one savage beasts, Prince Huo Xing\u2019s flute had summoned over a hundred of them. Never mind a Dawn State warrior, even a warrior in the Final State would have to run for their lives.\u201cRun!\u201d Zhang Ruochen yelled at Zi Qian.After saying these words, Zhang Ruochen ran ahead to avoid being surrounded by the Poisonous Bees.\u201cCan you escape?\u201dQing You chased after Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian.He had practiced Green Devil Hand and naturally had poison in his physique, so he was not afraid of the Poisonous Bees.Zhang Ruochen glanced at the rapidly approaching Qing You and also glanced at Prince Huo Xing on the back of the green-shelled eagle and thought. \u201cPrince Huo Xing is a Tamer. Although he is only an Advanced State warrior, he is more dangerous than Qing You. We must first get rid of him, otherwise, we are sure to die today. But he can ride on a green-shelled eagle, hovering in mid-air, how can we attack him?\u201dJust at this moment, a lazy voice spoke from within Zhang Ruochen\u2019s forehead. \u201cYoung man, if you can promise me one condition, I may be able to lend you a hand.\u201dIt was Blackie\u2019s voice.Blackie was sealed within the Yin Yang Wooden Graph, and the Graph was suspended in the Qi Lake within Zhang Ruochen\u2019s glabella.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat conditions?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, you will not seal me within the Graph!\u201d Blackie said.Zhang Ruochen replied, \u201cAs long as you behave better, I can agree to this condition.\u201d\u201cFine! We have a deal!\u201d Blackie said happily.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Sacred Mark flared. An art roll flew out from his glabella and landed in his hand.He waved his arm, and a giant black cat flew out from within the art scroll. It landed beside Zhang Ruochen like a massive black ball of yarn on the ground.Dissolving the seal, Blackie was ecstatic and said, \u201cYoung man, I will aid you and get rid of the person flying in the air.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cYou can attack him?\u201dBlackie rolled his eyes at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cMy title is the King of Slaughter. If I can\u2019t take on the sky and the earth, how can I be the King of Slaughter?\u201dBlackie began to glow darkly, making sounds like small firecrackers. His body grew larger and now was about the size of a lion.A pair of black wings also grew on his back.The black wings flapped, and Blackie rose into the air. He charged towards the flying Prince Huo Xing.\u201cHe can transform!\u201dZhang Ruochen was slightly shocked. It was his first time seeing a cat who could fly.Behind him, Qing You was also shocked. Staring at Zhang Rouchen he thought. \u201cIs he also a tamer?\u201dAt this moment, the Poisonous Bees caught up.\u201cSlap!\u201dZhang Ruochen swiped with his sword, and sliced a Poisonous Bee in half.More Bees flew up.\u201cSacred Bell Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen used a Spiritual Stage sword technique. Creating a three-meter tall illusion of a clock, it shielded his body in the middle.The big clock rotated, sending out tens of lines of Sword Breaths.Another dozen Poisonous Bees were struck by the Sword Breath and fell to the ground.\u201cGreen Devil Hand!\u201dQing You caught up and leaped. Crossing over 10 meters of distance, he struck towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest.Zhang Ruochen struck with his spear in one hand while the other held his sword. He used both at the same time to block Qing You.\u201cBoom!\u201dQing You was too strong. He shocked the spear from Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand.Zhang Ruochen backed up a dozen steps to dissipate Qing You\u2019s hit. He spat out another mouthful of blood. Already having taken some serious damage, Zhang Ruochen could no longer defend a full-strength attack from Qing You.\u201cNo choice, the difference between our cultivations is too large. If I could break through to the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, it would be nowhere near this difficult.\u201d Zhang Ruochen wiped the blood from his mouth. He did not feel discouraged, rather his feelings of bloodlust strengthened.\u201cBoiling Animal Spirits!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Genuine Qi in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body began to move; all the blood in his body began to boil.Boiling Animal Spirits was the mark of an Initial Stage warrior of the Black Realm.Qing You laughed coldly and said, \u201cWhat about Boiling Animal Spirits? Warriors of the Initial Stage are weak. They are no competition for warriors of the Dawn State\u2026 you\u2026 broke through!\u201dQing You\u2019s expression changed. He watched Zhang Ruochen\u2019s pores secrete threads of blood fog, becoming a blood rainbow and enveloping the body.Power of Rainbow-like Animal Spirits was the mark of a Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That allowed him to store a lot more Genuine Qi.A large amount of Genuine Qi he had already consumed recovered rapidly and became even more energetic. It flowed throughout his 36 Meridians and it soon created a large circle of vital energy.\u201cSwish.\u201dHe had released his Martial Soul and demonstrated the Space Domain.When he was at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, the Space Domain could only cover a space with a surrounding area of 10 meters. Now at the Mid Stage, the size of the Space Domain had enlarged to 30 meters.At the same time, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s mastery of the Space Domain had matured.A Poisonous Bee suddenly flew into the Space Domain and attacked Zhang Ruochen. He thought for a second and activated the power of the space warps, attemping to change the flight path of the Poisonous Bee.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s mastery of the Space Domain was so sophisticated that 10 Poisonous Bees would not be able to harm him even if he stood still.\u201cSwish!\u201dZhang Ruochen swung his sword. The Poisonous Bee was cut in half and fell to the ground.Qing You was standing nearby. He chuckled. \u201cEven though you\u2019ve broken through the realms, it won\u2019t change your final destination\u2014dying by my hand!\u201d\u201cIs it now?\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.\u201cPower of Rainbow-like Animal Spirits.\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s body was surrounded by a light Blood Aura. With the stimulation of the Blood Aura, he dashed out and attacked Qing You with an explosive speed of 38 meters per second.The speed he obtained surpassed most of the Dawn State warriors of the Black Realm.\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201dThe Genuine Qi inside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body surged towards his arms. His palms were filled by the Genuine Qi; even the air moved with his hands.\u201cGreen Devil Hand!\u201dEven though Zhang Ruochen had reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, Qing You wasn\u2019t afraid of him. There was only one thing Zhang Ruochen could do\u2014die.\u201cBoom!\u201dTwo powerful forces clashed together and created a deafening sound.A strong wind circled around them, stripping the nearby trees of their leaves.\u201cPuff!\u201dQing You spat out a mouthful of blood. He felt a powerful force roll through his arms that shook his internal organs.Zhang Ruochen pressed his palm on top of Qing You\u2019s. The power of his palm was getting stronger and stronger and kept forcing Qing You back.\u201cBoom!\u201dQing You slid back 10 meters and bumped into the trunk of a huge tree. Again he spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cYour power\u2026 How is your power stronger than mine? You are definitely going to die today!\u201d Qing You\u2019s face was distorted and he yelled. \u201cAnimal Spirits Fixing Beasts!\u201dThe blood inside Qing You\u2019s body seemed to burn. A large blood fog appeared behind his back. It combined together and turned into a two-meter tall image of a wolf.\u201cAnimal Spirits Fixing Beasts\u201d was the signature move of reaching the Dawn State of the Black Realm.Boiling Animal Spirits, Power of Rainbow-like Animal Spirits, Soaring Animal Spirits, Animal Spirits Fixing Beasts\u2026For each Black Realm a warrior passed through, the Spiritual Blood in their bodies would be greatly increased and all sorts of phenomenal changes would occur.If warriors at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm exploded out the power of Spiritual Blood and reached the \u201cBoiling Animal Spirits\u201d, their fighting force would be increased by 10 percent.Warriors at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, who used the power of Spiritual Blood and reached the \u201cPower of Rainbow-like Animal Spirits\u201d, would see a 30 percent increase.Warriors at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm could raise their fighting force by 50 percent if they used the Spiritual Blood power of the \u201cSoaring Animal Spirits\u201d.When warriors reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm, the Spiritual Blood inside their bodies would condense into the shadow of a beast, and their power would be incredible. Once the warriors unleashed the power of their Spiritual Blood, their fighting force would double quickly.Even if warriors of the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm were extremely talented, they would have difficulty defeating warriors of the Dawn State of the Black Realm.It was said that by reaching the \u201cDivinity of the Spiritual Blood\u201d at the Completion of the Black Realm, the power of the Spiritual Blood of the warriors would be able to double in a short amount of time.The power of Qing You had now doubled and all the Meridians in his body had thickened. He unleashed a palm towards Zhang Ruochen and sent him flying seven meters.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dQing You didn\u2019t allow him to catch his breath. He had a sharp sickle in his hand and ran towards him. In a flash, he stood before him.The inscriptions on the sickle had been activated and displayed a dazzling blood light. Together with the powerful knife energy, he swung towards Zhang Ruochen, aiming for his neck.\u201cSpace warps!\u201dSpace distorted again. Qing You swung the sickle over the top of his head.Qing You had finally realized that something was wrong. His facial expression changed and said, \u201cHow is it possible? What technique did you use? No! You didn\u2019t escape from the attack of the Death Sickle. There was a distortion in space.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you finally understand. Anyway, you\u2019re finished!\u201dZhang Ruochen Whamed his sword back-handed. It passed through Qing You\u2019s throat and pierced through his body.Qing You\u2019s eyes widened and he couldn\u2019t reconcile he had lost. His entire body shook severely and blood poured out from his mouth.\u201cBang!\u201d His body fell heavily to the ground.The most outstanding genius of the Qing family in a century fell to the sword of Zhang Ruochen.If he hadn\u2019t encountered Zhang Ruochen and with his talent, he would have definitely reached the Heaven Realm in 20 years, and become a martial arts legend.Fortunately, Zhang Ruochen had broken through the Mid Stage of the Black Realm before the fight. Otherwise, it would have been hard to tell who would have lived and who would have died.After killing Qing You, Zhang Ruochen felt relieved. He soon felt a feeling of weakness emerging. His sight darkened and he almost passed out.\u201cHe is seriously injured and lost a lot of blood!\u201dZhang Ruochen couldn\u2019t stop himself from falling to his knees. He supported himself with his palms on the ground and tried to keep himself awake.He took the Saint Stone Pill for healing and sat cross-legged on the ground. Then he activated the Genuine Qi in his body in order to refine the Pill Spirit of the Saint Stone Pill.Within a minute, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s injury was 20 percent recovered, but he was still very weak.He would be in grave danger if he encountered any other warriors or savage beasts.Suddenly, there were rustling sounds above his head.A massive black shadow plunged from the sky and landed in front of Zhang Ruochen.He looked at the shadow closely and saw that it was a giant black cat, as big as a lion. It had a pair of black wings.\u201cMeow!\u201dBlackie made a cat sound. His body contracted gradually and returned to its normal size. He moaned. \u201cI\u2019m so exhausted! That guy\u2019s cultivation was beyond my expectations. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s a Tamer and called for a number of carrion crows. Otherwise, I\u2019d definitely have killed him!\u201dWhen he recognized that it was Blackie who was standing in front of him, he felt relieved and asked, \u201cPrince Huo Xing escaped?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI almost consumed all the Genuine Qi within my body just to fight him. Young man, give me a Spiritual Crystal. I need to recover my Genuine Qi,\u201d Blackie said.Zhang Ruochen took out a Spiritual Crystal and threw it to Blackie. He asked with curiosity, \u201cHow has your cultivation improved so greatly?\u201dWhile Zhang Ruochen had cultivated the Medium State of the Yellow Realm, Blackie\u2019s fighting force had just reached the Medium State of the Yellow Realm. He was also weaker compared to Zhang Ruochen.Yet the fighting force that Blackie had just demonstrated was powerful enough to confront warriors of the Dawn State of the Black Realm. Surprisingly, he fought well against Prince Huo Xing and was able to escape.\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, my power has been sealed in the Yin Yang Wooden Glyph. You are the only person who can open that seal. The stronger your cultivation, the more seals you will be able to open, and my power will also grow stronger,\u201d Blackie added.\u201cWhat happens when your seals are fully opened?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Blackie looked up and said with pride, \u201cThat will be the time when I return to earth. Everyone will have to heed my command. All you have to do is follow and serve me. I will make sure that all the people of the Kunlun\u2019s Field will fear and obey you.\u201dBlackie sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, the cunning monk has a backup plan in case someone like you opens up the seal. With your cultivation, you\u2019ll never be able to open up all the seals. Now I will go to the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel to recover my Genuine Qi. Young man, give me a Spiritual Crystal.\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t respond to what Blackie had said and instead asked, \u201cThere are lots of Spiritual Crystals in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel. Take them if you want. By the way, how much time will you need to recover your Genuine Qi?\u201d\u201cWith the help of the Spiritual Crystal, I will need half a day,\u201d Blackie replied.After Blackie went into the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel, Zhang Ruochen stood up and started searching the battlefield. It seemed that even Blackie himself knew that he would never be able to escape from the seal of the Yin Yang Wooden Glyph.Moreover, he dared not harm Zhang Ruochen. If he were to die, it would again be forever sealed in the Yin Yang Wooden Graph.Qing You was dead as well as the other seven warriors from Square Commandery. Only Prince Huo Xing escaped.Zhang Ruochen searched Qing You\u2019s body and found 18 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs which equated to nine inferior-class level-two savage beasts that he had hunted down.There was also a Two-Star VIP Card, 38 Spiritual Crystal, and 300 silver coins.Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t place too much hope in the Two-Star VIP Card. If he couldn\u2019t find Qing You\u2019s blood relatives, he wouldn\u2019t be able to withdraw them, so it wouldn\u2019t matter how many silver coins were on the card.He picked up the Death Sickle Qing You had used and transferred Genuine Qi into it. He discovered that there were altogether 23 inscriptions carved on the Death Sickle which classified it as a fifth level Genuine Martial Arm. Its value was at least 10,000 silver coins.The Death Sickle was indeed an expensive and precious weapon. He would make a lot of money once he sold it.He kept searching the other seven warriors and found Beast\u2019s Eyeballs, weapons, Spiritual Crystals, and silver coins. He stored it all in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel.He knew that it wasn\u2019t the right time to count the treasures. Prince Huo Xing could come back anytime. With his current condition, he was surely not strong enough to defeat him.He had to leave right away to find a safe place to rest and count all the items he had collected.Suddenly he thought of Zi Qian, so he entered the forest where he fought with Qing You to see if he could find any trace of her.\u201cAhh\u2026 Help\u2026\u201dHe heard a woman sobbing and moaning.He separated the dense, thick grass and saw Zi Qian laying on the ground. She put her hand to her chest and shivered when she saw Zhang Ruochen. Her face turned red and said with a weak voice, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m poisoned\u2026 Help\u2026 me\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to be asking for help with her usual soft and tempting voice, but more moaning the request.She didn\u2019t look like she was in good condition. Her eyes were fuzzy, her eyelashes trembled, and her red lips were slightly open. A layer of pink covered her snow-white skin which smelled of sweat.\u201cPoisoned? What type of poison?\u201dZhang Ruochen saw there was a mark of a black palm on Zi Qian\u2019s right shoulder that was caused by Qing You\u2019s Green Devil Hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was the toxin of Green Devil Hand!\u201cWait\u2026 It seems like there\u2019s more than one type of toxin!\u201dZhang Ruochen kept checking her body. He found a bloody wound on her stomach, caused by Poisonous Bees.There were three wounds on her body in total. On her neck, stomach, and left leg.Her long legs shivered slightly and twisted together so hard that her culottes looked like they were going to be torn apart. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the pain or something else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She scratched holes in her clothes, exposing her snow-white skin.\u201cThe Martial Arts that Qing You cultivates is relatively demonic. It specializes in absorbing the Genuine Qi inside a women\u2019s body to build itself up. Green Devil Hand is a toxin that makes women go crazy with lust in order to make female warriors more easily defeated. This is going to be tough to handle!\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t know how to detoxicate Zi Qian. He gave her a Red Pill to swallow.He knew that it wasn\u2019t safe to stay in the forest, so he grabbed Zi Qian\u2019s arms and carried her on his back to search for a safer place to treat her.Zi Qian was a killer and was most likely sent to kill Zhang Ruochen. It would have been completely understandable for him to leave her there to fend for herself.Yet they had fought together before. If Zi Qian couldn\u2019t kill the seven warriors, he wasn\u2019t powerful enough by himself to fight his way out.\u201cAh\u2026 Help me\u2026\u201dZi Qian\u2019s entire body was limp, as if she was intoxicated. Her beautiful face was rubbing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s and she was short of breath.Zhang Ruochen couldn\u2019t help but be seduced by her soft hands. She slid her hands inside his clothes and started touching his chest.He rushed inside the woods very quickly with Zi Qian on his back. He wanted to get away from where they had just fought.Zi Qian kept touching his back. She started kissing his cheeks and left strawberry lipstick marks on his neck.\u201cWhen is she going to stop\u2026\u201dHe moved her face away from his head in order to stop her from kissing him.Zi Qian\u2019s hallucinations were getting worse.\u201cBoom!\u201dShe tore off her clothes and wore only her white skintight underwear. Exposing most of her snow-white skin, she squeezed her plump chest towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back.She started breathing faster. Her body was boiling hot. She kept rubbing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back and kissing his cheeks, leaving traces of her moist lips.\u201cBeep!\u201dAll of a sudden, a Kylin Hawk roared above Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s facial expression changed as he sensed something dangerous was coming. He stopped running, lay down in a hole, and concealed himself with grass and leaves.He held his breath and looked up towards the sky.He saw that Prince Huo Xing was standing on the Kylin Hawk\u2019s back. He circled in the air as if he was looking for something.Besides Prince Huo Xing, there was another man in the sky, riding on a two-headed gryphon dressed in white.They were both looking down at the ground as if they were looking for something.\u201cHelp\u2026 Help me\u2026 Please\u2026\u201dZi Qian\u2019s sight was blurred. She hugged Zhang Ruochen tightly, breathing heavily and reached her hands into his clothes again.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dZhang Ruochen held her from behind beneath him. He covered her mouth with one hand while he held her arms with the other. Otherwise, Zi Qian might yell or squirm around, alerting the two people in the air to their position.If someone walked past both of them right now, they would have thought that Zhang Ruochen was doing something terrible to Zi Qian.Even though Prince Huo Xing stood on the back of the Kylin Hawk and circled in the air, he couldn\u2019t find any trace of Zhang Ruochen or Zi Qian. He had a cold-blooded look on his face and said, \u201cThey escaped! Square Commandery has suffered a great loss this time. Both Feng Zhiyi and Qing You were killed by Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian. The hate inside me will never go away if we don\u2019t kill them both!\u201dStanding on the two-headed gryphon\u2019s back, Feng Zhilin also had a cold look on his face and said, \u201cThe Ninth Prince from Yunwu Commandery, right? He killed my brother and I\u2019ll make sure he will pay!\u201dFeng Zhilin was Feng Zhiyi\u2019s older brother. His cultivation had reached the Final State of the Black Realm. He had become the external student of the School of the Martial Market two years ago.He was also one of the members of the inspection team in the first-round examination of the School, and was responsible for saving the new students should they be in danger.\u201cSince they\u2019re gone, I should probably head off. If other members of the inspection team realize that I\u2019m with you, they\u2019ll report to the presbyters of the School that I\u2019m committing a crime,\u201d Feng Zhilin said.Prince Huo Xing nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right! You should go, Brother Feng! They are lucky to have escaped this time, but luck won\u2019t always be on their side. We will hunt them down next time!\u201dPrince Huo Xing and Feng Zhilin separated and flew away in different directions.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that he is Feng Zhiyi\u2019s brother. I have to find him, so I can withdraw the silver coins from Feng Zhiyi\u2019s Two-Star VIP Card.\u201d Zhang Ruochen began to memorize Feng Zhilin\u2019s features so that he would be able to recognize him in the future.Suddenly, a massive force from Zi Qian shook Zhang Ruochen off and pressed him down underneath her.Zhang Ruochen shook his head and moved his finger towards Zi Qian\u2019s glabella.Zi Qian\u2019s Qi Lake shivered severely. She closed her eyes and fell limply on top of his body.\u201cThis truly is a horrible toxin if it is able to turn a cold-blooded killer into a person with such dissipated behavior. You\u2019re lucky I saved you! Otherwise, you would have been dead!\u201dHe helped her stand up and carried her on his back again.After having spent an hour getting 100 kilometers away from the forest, Zhang Ruochen had finally found a relatively safe cave to rest.He put her down on the ground. He saw that her lips had turned purple, and her face was pale. If she didn\u2019t get medical help right away, she would undoubtfully die.He helped her to sit up and walked to her back.He sat down cross-legged behind her and activated the Genuine Qi in his body. The second level of the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d was floating in his mind.\u201cThe Ming\u2019s Jade Heaven, the second level of the Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean!\u201dWith the Genuine Qi running, the Genuine Qi inside his body had started to spin gradually and turned jade-white.\u201cBeep!\u201dHe thrust both of his palms towards her naked back.The jade-white Genuine Qi had been released from his palms. It went through the Mid-heaven Meridian on Zi Qian\u2019s back and entered her body.\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Heaven, the first level of the Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean.\u201d\u201cThe second level of the Scripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean, the Ming\u2019s Jade Heaven!\u201dThe quality of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi would change after each level of cultivation. Not only was the purification of his Genuine Qi far better than of other warriors in the same realm, but it also had a certain nature.For example, the second level of the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d allowed warriors to cultivate a Pure Jade Genuine Qi which could cleanse unhealthy substances and toxins from the body.In other words, once he had cultivated the second level of the \u201cScripture of Emperor Ming\u2019s Empyrean\u201d, he was able to detoxicate most of the poison in his body, if not all.The Pure Jade Genuine Qi in Zi Qian\u2019s body had activated a large circle of vital energy. It flowed back to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm and returned to his Qi Lake.After 36 circulations, the poison inside Zi Qian\u2019s body had subsided greatly. Her lips soon turned red again and her face looked blushed.\u201cAww!\u201dZi Qian spat out a mouthful of the toxic black blood.She woke up slowly and felt a sense of coldness from her body. She looked down and discovered that she wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes and her body was completely exposed.Both of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palms were still pressing on her back. He exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t move! Activate the Genuine Qi inside your body with me now. It\u2019s the only way to fully discharge all the poison in your body.\u201dHaving heard what Zhang Ruochen said, it was hard for her to stay calm.\u201cBoom!\u201dShe exploded a massive force from her body and pushed Zhang Ruochen away.She covered her chest with one hand to protect her privacy while she grabbed the sword with her index and middle finger of the other hand. She pointed the sword towards Zhang Ruochen glabella and asked coldly, \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201dZhang Ruochen felt absurd and said, \u201cStay calm, will you? If I wanted to take advantage of you, I would have done so a long time ago! I didn\u2019t do anything to you! Look at my neck, my clothes, and the scratches on my chest! These are all because of you. If I hadn\u2019t stopped you right away\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201dShe stared at the red marks on his neck and her face turned pink. She bit her lip and took a few steps back.Her body was still weak and she couldn\u2019t stand still. She fell to the ground and breathed heavily.Zhang Ruochen stood up and gasped. \u201cI warned you not to mess around in your current condition. You are such a stubborn woman! The poison inside your body hasn\u2019t been cleaned yet. They\u2019ll take hold again if you don\u2019t do as I say!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201dZi Qian didn\u2019t believe what he had said. She removed a small bottle from her Spatial Ring, took a Detoxification Pill out, and swallowed it.Suddenly, she saw Zhang Ruochen walking towards her. He covered her tiny body with a large piece of cloth.Zi Qian shivered and looked down at the ground. There was confusion in her eyes. She finally got the courage to ask, \u201cOther than the marks on your neck, nothing happened between us right?\u201dZhang Ruochen laughed. \u201cWhat else could have happened? Haha!\u201dZi Qian\u2019s cheeks blushed. Looking at the handsome youngster in front of her, she bit her lip and looked embarrassed. She wanted to run away and hide, because she felt so awkward.\u201cOh yes, one more thing!\u201dZhang Ruochen took out the fish intestines sword hidden in the sleeve and handed it to Zi Qian. \u201cI found it in your clothes. Take it.\u201dZi Qian face suddenly changed. She stared at the fish intestines sword hidden in the sleeve that Zhang Ruochen was holding and said, \u201cYou\u2026 You already know I\u2019m a killer from the Hades Department?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe took a closer look at the fish intestines sword in his hand. He nodded and smiled. \u201cWho else would use this type of sword except the killers of the Hades Department?\u201dZi Qian\u2019s beautiful eyes stared at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019m a killer from the Hades Department, you must have known that I was sent to kill you. Why did you save my life?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just sit there and watch you die, could I?\u201dHe continued, \u201cEven so, if you did try to kill me, you would have died slowly. There\u2019s no way that you\u2019d still be alive standing in front of me. Since you can\u2019t kill me and didn\u2019t kill me, why couldn\u2019t I save you?\u201dZi Qian felt ashamed after hearing that. She almost bit through her lip and said, \u201cZhang Ruochen, did anyone ever tell you that you\u2019re a jerk?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: End of First-round Examination Translator: Transn Editor: TransnAs for Zi Qian\u2019s question, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s answer was surely no.Who would admit to being a jerk?The following day, Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian hid in the cave to recover.With the help of the healing pill, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s condition of an injury had recovered 70-80% by nightfall. Even though he hadn\u2019t fully recovered yet, he was confident that he could defeat Prince Huo Xing should he encounter him.Although both Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian almost died, they had gained a lot this time.On top of the 14 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs that Zhang Ruochen now owned, there were 18 and 26 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs found on Qing You and the seven warriors\u2019 bodies respectively.Altogether Zhang Ruochen had 58 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs which equated to hunting down 29 inferior-class level-two savage beasts.\u201cSince I\u2019m at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, I only need to hunt down 10 inferior-class level-two savage beasts in order to pass the examination, which means I\u2019ve already exceeded the target.\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled slightly and looked over at Zi Qian. \u201cMiss Zi, how many Beast\u2019s Eyeballs do you have?\u201dZi Qian sat cross-legged on the ground, retreated her Genuine Qi and said, \u201c68 in total, which equals to hunting down 34 inferior-class level-two savage beasts.\u201dWarriors at the Dawn State of the Black Realm were required to hunt down 40 inferior-class level-two savage beasts in order to pass the examination.Zhang Ruochen took out 12 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs and handed them over to Zi Qian. \u201cHere you go.\u201dZi Qian took the 12 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs without hesitation and put them inside her pocket.\u201cYou really don\u2019t care I was sent to kill you? Do you know how much your head is worth on the black market?\u201d She asked.He was counting the Spiritual Crystals, silver coins, and Genuine Martial Arms placed on the ground. \u201cHow much?\u201d He asked without looking at her.\u201c150 Spiritual Crystals, equal to 150,000 silver coins.\u201dShe chuckled. \u201cWith that many silver coins, I could hire a master of the Earth Realm to kill you!\u201dHe turned and passed her a bag. He said, \u201cHere, 150 Spiritual Crystals. Keep them safe.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dShe was shocked. She took the bag from him and opened it.The bag glittered in different colors. A strong Spiritual Qi surged out from it and the density of the Spiritual Qi in the air rapidly increased.It was indeed 150 Spiritual Crystals!Zhang Ruochen gave her a faint smile and said, \u201cI found them on Qing You\u2019s and the other seven warriors\u2019 bodies. Like we agreed before, I take the Genuine Martial Arms and Pills and you take the Spiritual Crystals.\u201dZi Qian bit her lip slightly and stared at Zhang Ruochen. She took the 150 Spiritual Crystals and put them away.Every young warrior who had joined the examination of the School of the Martial Market was a genius of Martial Arts. They came from either a large family or powerful Suzerains.Their resources and properties for practice were no doubt abundant. 10 of their properties would equate to the family property of a master of the Earth Realm.Zhang Ruochen put away all the Genuine Martial Arms and dozens of elixir bottles. He said, \u201cMission complete! We can finish the first-round examination in advance. Let\u2019s go back!\u201d\u201cNo! Although we\u2019ve killed 24 warriors of Square Commandery, we didn\u2019t harm their foundation. Two of their best warriors, Feng Zhiyi and Qing You, have already been killed by us. We can attack the remaining warriors from Square Commandery as we please!\u201d Zi Qian had a cold-blooded look on her face and didn\u2019t want to finish the first-round examination yet.He rubbed his chin softly and asked, \u201cYou really think that killing all the warriors of the Square Commandery will earn you more than the title as a killer, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI do! So what?\u201dZi Qian made no secret of the fact that she wanted to kill them all. She continued, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to protect Yunwu Commandery seeing as you\u2019re its Ninth Prince? If we both leave Omen Ridge now, the other young warriors of Yunwu Commandery would not be able to confront the warriors of Square Commandery and end up dying in the woods!\u201dZhang Ruochen responded. \u201cWell\u2026 Seems like I really shouldn\u2019t stand by and just watch them die!\u201dZi Qian put a sweet smile on her face while her long eyelashes glittered. She said softly, \u201cFighting in wars will also greatly increase our cultivation. The more resources we collect, the faster we cultivate after entering the School of the Martial Market.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it! I don\u2019t want any of the warriors of my Commandery to die!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said with a determination to protect his people.Darkness had covered the woods. Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian turned into two shadows and dashed into Omen Ridge.Zhang Ruochen had reached the speed of 38 meters each second which was similar to Zi Qian\u2019s.A rain of blood covered the woods that night.Another 35 warriors of Square Commandery were killed by Zi Qian\u2019s sword.They had again collected a lot of resources: the Beast\u2019s Eyeballs, Spiritual Crystals, silver coins, tens of Genuine Martial Arms, numerous pills, and more than 10 kilograms of Spiritual Brawn.During the day, they hid and rested in the cave in order to heal and recover their Genuine Qi.Zhang Ruochen had refined seven Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pills. He had finally stabilized the cultivation of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. His body was fully healed as well as looking sharp and fresh.Times passed and nightfall came.The sky was gloomy, soon it had turned to night.This was the last night of the first-round examination.There was a roar in Omen Ridge that lasted the whole night. Some candidates grasped the Kylin Ball and called for help with the Kylin Smoke.Yet when the inspection team arrived, the candidate had already died. The killer had disappeared into the woods.\u201cThat\u2019s strange! The examination this year is such a tragedy. 20 young warriors of the Square Commandery have been killed!\u201d A member of the inspection team said with a long spear in his hand.Another inspector crossed his arms, stood next to the dead body and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid there are more than 20.\u201d\u201cI wonder what kind of trouble Square Commandery has encountered this year!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go! The examination is going to end tomorrow afternoon anyway!\u201dThe two inspectors rode on their two-headed gryphons, turned into two massive shadows and left the woods.The slaughter had continued until noon the next day. 49 warriors in total had been killed by Zi Qian.Since Zi Qian was a warrior of the Dawn State of the Black Realm, the warriors of both the Initial Stage and Mid Stage of the Black Realm had no way to fight back. They all died with one strike of her sword.Zhang Ruochen followed behind Zi Qian and did nothing.That was because there was someone sweeping and searching for the treasures. Besides, that person was more than happy to do so.To be more precise, it was a cat, not a human being.\u201cHaha! Two kilograms of Spiritual Brawn, it\u2019s really worth the search!\u201dBlackie found a jade box on the body of a Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm. He opened the jade box and a strong fragrance emerged.Stored inside the jade box was Spiritual Brawn.\u201c21 Spiritual Crystal, 300 silver coins. This warrior is way too poor!\u201dBlackie shook his head with disappointment. He threw the bag full of Spiritual Crystals and silver coins to Zhang Ruochen and caught up with Zi Qian.While Zi Qian continued killing the warriors of Square Commandery, Blackie searched for treasures. A human and a cat worked exceptionally well together.Zhang Ruochen followed behind them moderately. He lifted his head and looked at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon. We should head back, otherwise, we\u2019ll be late and be disqualified.\u201d\u201cGo back? For what? I want to try to kill two people at the same time!\u201d Blackie looked fierce and exposed his sharp teeth and claws.He stared at Blackie coldly and said, \u201cDo you want me to seal you back to the Graph right now?\u201d\u201cRelax! I\u2019m just joking with you!\u201d Blackie covered his teeth and claws, and looked gentle again.Zi Qian was curious about Blackie when she first met him. Soon after, she got used to how Blackie and Zhang Ruochen talked. She glanced at Blackie and quickly shifted her attention away.If a savage beast learned to speak the language of humans when they were young, those clever savage beasts could indeed communicate with humans.Savage beasts that were able to speak the language of humans were very rare.\u201cI\u2019ll keep your treasures for now. We\u2019ll share them when we get back to the School of the Martial Market.\u201d After she wiped the blood off her sword, Zi Qian put it back in the sword scabbard.Zhang Ruochen could clearly feel that the Martial Arts realm of Zi Qian had enhanced a lot after three days of hunting. She was not far away from cultivating the Sword Following the Mind, the realm of an Advanced Stage.At her current practice pace, she would definitely reach the Advanced Stage of the Sword Following the Mind before cultivating to the Earth Realm.\u201cShe should cultivate the Slaughter Kendo!\u201d Zhang Ruochen thought.\u201cMew!\u201dBlackie shrank his body to the size of a fist. He jumped onto Zhang Ruochen\u2019s arm and went inside his pocket.Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian left Omen Ridge for the School of the Martial Market.Shortly after, they met an Outer Palace student of the School of the Martial Market along the way.The Outer Palace student let them sit on his two-headed gryphon\u2019s back and led them back to the School of the Martial Market.The generous Outer Palace student was called Wang Qi and had cultivated to the Final State of the Black Realm.Wang Qi glanced at Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian. He couldn\u2019t help staring at Zi Qian. She was beautiful and elegant, and could definitely be called an Iceberg Beauty.She was as pretty as Three Beauties of Western Campus.Wang Qi moved slightly towards Zi Qian and said, \u201cI started practicing at the School of the Martial Market three year ago with a ranking of 238 among all the external students of Western Campus. Which Commandery Prince do you two belong to?\u201dZi Qian\u2019s eyes were cold. She grabbed her sword and stood on top of the two-headed gryphon\u2019s back without responding to Wang Qi. She had encountered numerous men hitting on her before. She didn\u2019t bother talking to anyone of them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m the Yunwu Commandery Prince.\u201d\u201cYunwu Commandery!\u201dWang Qi shook his head slightly as if something was wrong. Yet his eyes were still focused on Zi Qian and he gasped. \u201cThings are getting tough for the warriors from Yunwu Commandery in the School of the Martial Market. They have always been suppressed by Square Commandery, especially the freshmen. They are always bullied if none of the stronger warriors at the School protected them. Some of the freshmen have strangely disappeared over the past few years. Rumor has it they have been killed by the students of Square Commandery. My junior sister apprentice, if you encounter any problems just say my name, Wang Qi. People in Western Campus honor me and won\u2019t dare cause you any trouble.\u201d\u201cThank you for your kind reminder, Wang Qi. We will be careful when we arrive back at the School.\u201d Zhang Ruochen responded with courtesy.While they were chatting, they had already flown above Western Campus of the School of the Martial Market.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Many of them had injuries and their faces were full of disappointment.Some were in high spirits, laughing and talking happily. It was apparent they had completed the first round of the exam, which explained their confidence.People were discussing vividly in the drill ground, mostly about the thrilling experience of hunting the savage beasts.\u201cI heard there are two killing stars in the exam this year. They caused a foul wind and a rain of blood in Omen Ridge, killing many young warriors.\u201d\u201cI heard that too! The killing stars targeted warriors from Square Commandery, killing at least 50 of them.\u201dA warrior from Yunwu Commandery sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that the two killing stars fended off warriors from Square Commandery so that they didn\u2019t have the energy to fight us. I don\u2019t think I would pass the first round otherwise.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked past those warriors with a small smile on his face and hand over 20 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs to the disciple in charge of counting them.Zi Qian handed over 80 Beast\u2019s Eyeballs.They both passed the first round of the School of the Martial Market exam and returned to the drill ground to join the others from Yunwu Commandery.They both kept the extra Beast\u2019s Eyeballs to themselves.The eyeballs of savage beasts all had medicinal value. They could be used for making Pills. If they sold them, they could make a hefty profit.It was now noon, and the first round of the exam was over.Standing on a dais, Elder Situ held a scroll made of animal skin and began reading the names of the warriors who had passed the first round.\u201c1,537 people took part in the first round of the exam, 468 passed. The names are as follows: Jiang Ying, Liu Chengfeng, Xia Hao\u2026\u201dThe young warriors who had passed left the drill ground after Elder Situ finished reading their names. The others were sent back to their own commanderies.Elder Situ continued, \u201cWarriors, who have passed the first round, will rest in the drill ground tonight. The second round, \u2018Breaking Through the Wu Tower\u2019, will start tomorrow morning. The top 120 who finish the second round will pass. The others are all eliminated.\u201cYour two seniors will keep order here tonight. Whoever dares to make trouble before \u2018Breaking Through the Wu Tower\u2019 round will be punished severely.\u201dElder Situ walked off the dais and left the drill ground.Two pretty ladies, one tall and the other short, walked into the drill ground of Western Yard from the ancient building after Elder Situ left.The external students of the School of the Martial Market seemed alarmed when they saw the two ladies and bowed immediately.\u201cGreetings, Senior Huang and Senior Duanmu!\u201d\u201cGreetings, Senior Huang and Senior Duanmu!\u201d\u2026Wang Qi, the external student who escorted Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian back to the School of the Martial Market earlier, also bowed to the two ladies in respect.Senior Huang was tall and slender with royal blue hair that reached her waist. Her skin was fair and smooth, like the petals of the pear blossom.Senior Duanmu appeared only 13 or 14 years old. Her facial features were quite delicate, with long and fine eyelashes and a pair of bright eyes. Despite her youthful appearance, her body was fully grown. Her breasts were perkier than Senior Huang\u2019s.More importantly, they were both devastatingly beautiful, with appearances that could topple nations.They climbed up the stone stage and glanced at the young warriors in the drill ground. They sat with their legs crossed on the stage and closed their eyes, as if they were practicing.In the drill ground of Western Yard, everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to those two ladies. No one could look away.But the external students of the School of the Martial Market who had studied here for one or two years dared not look at them, as if it was a taboo.Zhang Ruochen also glanced at those ladies and said with a little surprise, \u201cThey\u2019re wearing colorful robes!\u201dGenerally, external students of the school could only wear white robes.Only the internal students of the school could wear colorful robes.Liu Chengfeng stared at the ladies and replied quietly, \u201cEven external students of the school could wear colorful robes if they become Warrior of Division Profound or earn enough merits.\u201dLiu Chengfeng\u2019s eyes would typically light up and he would be impatient to make a move when he saw pretty ladies.But he showed no trace of being a player when he saw the two ladies. Instead, he seemed a little afraid.Zhang Ruochen was a little curious. \u201cAre they Warriors of Division Profound?\u201dLiu Chengfeng nodded at once. \u201cIt\u2019s always the Yin that flourishes while the Yang declines in the West House of the School of the Martial Market. Females are extremely powerful while males hardly have any say in Western Campus. They\u2019re called the imperial consort of Western Palace inside the School of the Martial Market. They control the whole Western Campus. If any men offend them, they\u2019re dead meat. Alas!\u201dZhang Ruochen looked serious. If those two ladies were indeed Warriors of Division Profound, they were very powerful.It was harder to enter the Profound Board than to enter the Yellow Board.The Yellow Board was only the ranking list of the top warriors of the Yellow Realm in one commandery. Firstly, the Yellow Realm was quite low. Secondly, the Yellow Board\u2019s territory was very narrow.The Profound Board was different. Only the top warriors of the Black Realm could enter it.Moreover, the Profound Board involved the 36 commanderies around Omen Ridge.In other words, only the top warriors of the Black Realm of the 36 commanderies could enter the Profound Board.In a manner of speaking, any warrior who could enter the Profound Board had the power to fight warriors of the Earth Realm. The top ranking people of the Profound Board were even more powerful than warriors of the Earth Realm.If the two ladies on the stone stage were indeed Warriors of Division Profound, could it be that they could fight the top warriors of the Earth Realm?No wonder that the external students were all afraid of them.Zhang Ruochen withdrew his gaze. Instead of staring at the two ladies, he looked around and saw there were 31 young warriors from Yunwu Commandery who had passed the first round.In previous years, no one dared to expect such an achievement.There were 162 people from Square Commandery who had passed the first round. It was still the best result of the Western Nine Prefectures. Of course, it was still not as good as the previous years.Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian had killed 98 warriors from Square Commandery. Many of them had been very powerful. It surely shocked the other martial artists of Square Commandery.Prince Huo Xing sat among the warriors from Square Commandery with his legs crossed. He shot Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian a cold glare, with strong malice brewing in his eyes.Zhang Ruochen also stared at Prince Huo Xing who sat afar and noticed his Spiritual Blood had increased a lot. Even his eyes looked sharper.\u201cPrince Huo Xing has broken through to the Dawn State of the Black Realm!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.\u201cWhat?\u201dLiu Chengfeng\u2019s faced changed as he cried out in surprise. \u201cPrince Huo Xing is incredibly talented and he\u2019s also a genius tamer. He must have strong Spiritual Power. With his breakthrough to the Dawn State of the Black Realm, maybe he\u2019ll be ranked first in this exam.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat happens if you become the first in the exam? Are there any benefits?\u201dLiu Chengfeng said, \u201cNever mind being first, you\u2019ll be well-rewarded if you get to the top 10.\u201cEven the 10th place would get 100 points of merits. The ninth would get 200 points, and so forth. The fourth would get 700 points.\u201cThe third ranked would get 1,000 points.\u201cThe second would get 2,000 points.\u201cThe first ranked would get 3,000 points.\u201dA young warrior beside them scoffed. \u201cThe first only gets 3,000 points of merits. It\u2019s not much!\u201dLiu Chengfeng rolled his eyes. \u201cThe merits of the School of the Martial Market can be exchanged for any Practice resources, like Pills, Genuine Martial Arms, savage beast mounts, slaves, buildings\u2026 The limitation is your imagination. There\u2019s nothing the School can\u2019t give. It\u2019s beyond your wildest imagination.\u201cIf you have enough merits, the School of the Martial Market could help you buy a commandery.\u201cOne merit of the School of the Martial Market equals one Spiritual Crystal. The reward for the first ranked equals 3,000 Spiritual Crystal, in another word, 3,000,000 silver coins.\u201d\u201cThree\u2026 million\u2026 silver coins\u2026\u201d Those young warriors from Yunwu Commandery were all shocked.Zhang Ruochen was surprised too. He had heard of the wealth of Martial Market Bank, but he did not truly comprehend it until this moment.Even seventh-class families like the Lin family had to use up all their savings and unite all their forces to gather 3,000,000 silver coins.Now, to obtain 3,000,000 silver coins, all he had to do was to get the 3,000 points reward for the first ranked new disciple.With such a fortune, one could surely trade for massive Practice resources to speedily increase one\u2019s cultivation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe \u2018Breaking Through the Wu Tower\u2019 round tomorrow is the key. The better your performance is, the higher your marks are.\u201dLiu Chengfeng continued, \u201cAlthough it tests your cultivation, it tests your talents and comprehension even more, such as Spiritual Power, Five Senses, willpower, judgment\u2026\u201dZi Qian\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019m going to get into the top three tomorrow.\u201dLiu Chengfeng glanced at Zhang Ruochen thoughtfully. \u201cWhat about you, Ninth Prince?\u201dZhang Ruochen smiled. \u201cI know nothing of the Wu Tower.

He had no idea how many floors and levels he would be able to get through.Beside him, Liu Chengfeng seemed excited. He lowered his voice and said, \u201cLet me tell you guys a secret. I\u2019ve practiced at the Wu Tower three times before the exam.\u201cGiven my current Realm of Martial Arts, I\u2019m very confident I can pass the three obstacles on the first level. As for the second level, I should be able to pass one or two.\u201cAccording to the previous results, as long as you can pass the three obstacles on the first level, you\u2019ll stand out and be accepted as an external student of Western Campus.\u201cPeople who are able to pass the three obstacles on the second level are incredibly rare. There is either one or two in a year or no one at all.\u201d Liu Chengfeng laughed. \u201cGiven my talent and the practice I\u2019ve had, I have a chance to be in the top 10.\u201dWarriors from Yunwu Commandery all looked at Liu Chengfeng with envy.\u201cMaster Liu, please tell us more about the situation in the Wu Tower! At least we know what to expect when we get inside. I have eight Spiritual Crystals here, please take it.\u201d A male warrior pressed the Spiritual Crystals into Liu Chengfeng\u2019s hands.\u201cMaster Liu, we are all warriors from Yunwu Commandery. If we get into the School of the Martial Market, we can look out for each other! Please tell us more! Here are five Spiritual Crystals. Please keep them.\u201d Another warrior reluctantly held out five Spiritual Crystals and passed them to Liu Chengfeng.Everyone started taking out their Spiritual Crystals for Liu Chengfeng to learn more information about the Wu Tower.Shortly after, Liu Chengfeng had collected a small pile of Spiritual Crystals. The smile on his face got even brighter. Clearing his throat, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem to tell you about the Wu Tower. First, the Tower has seven levels with three obstacles each.\u201cWhen I first entered the Wu Tower to practice, I was only at the Completion of the Yellow Realm. I didn\u2019t even make it through the first obstacle. When I entered the second time, I passed the first obstacle, but failed on the second. The third time, I got through the first two obstacles, but failed again in the third.\u201dA warrior asked, \u201cWhat are the three obstacles on the first level?\u201dLiu Chengfeng smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t reveal too much, but I can tell you this. The first obstacle tests your battle strategy, the second tests your agility and speed, while the third tests your Spiritual Power and willpower.\u201dLiu Chengfeng\u2019s answer was vague and everyone was still confused. They did not know what they were going to face in the Wu Tower.While the warriors below were discussing the Wu Tower, the two beauties sitting crossed legged on the stone stage were also talking to each other.Senior Huang swept her eyes around her and said, with a voice as cold as ice, \u201cThe cultivations of the new students this year are pretty good. 15 of them have reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm while 47 are in the Advanced State. If nothing goes wrong, the top 10 of this year\u2019s exam should come from these 62.\u201dSenior Duanmu\u2019s eyelashes were long and curved and her eyes sparkled when she smiled. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure though. The obstacles within the Wu Tower are more about testing the warrior\u2019s talent, battle strategy, willpower, and Spiritual Power. Perhaps there will be a prodigy from the Initial or Mid Stage!\u201dSenior Huang said, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s said that the Wu Tower tests talent, the higher the cultivation, the larger advantage. Let\u2019s see if there will be a prodigal warrior this year who can pass the third obstacle on the second level!\u201d\u201cA freshman passing the third obstacle on the second level? That\u2019s far too difficult!\u201dSenior Duanmu spoke again. \u201cThere are three people who might succeed: Prince Huo Xing of Square Commandery, Chi Minghai of Flame Dragon Commandery, and Yao Yintong of Moon Commandery. Qing You of Square Commandery was also a competitive warrior, but unfortunately, someone killed him in the first exam.\u201dSenior Huang\u2019s mouth twitched upwards. \u201cThen, isn\u2019t the one who killed Qing You more powerful?\u201dSenior Duanmu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou\u2019re right! I wonder who killed him!\u201dDuanmu\u2019s eyes started searching through more than 400 young warriors below. To be able to kill Qing You, they would have to be one of the strongest among the new students.Senior Huang once again closed her eyes. \u201cSince you\u2019re so curious, let\u2019s make a round at the Wu Tower tomorrow and see what kind of prodigies there are.\u201d\u201cGreat idea!\u201dDuanmu was very excited and began anticipating the breakthrough of the Wu Tower tomorrow.At dawn, when the first light shined at West Campus of the School of the Martial Market, 468 young warriors were brought to the foot of the Wu Tower under the guidance of the nine presbyters.The Wu Tower was seven stories tall. The entire tower radiated in a golden glow. It did not resemble a tower built by man, but more like seamless Genuine Martial Arms.Not only were there the nine presbyters, there were also a number of external students of the School of the Martial Market who came to watch the competition. They wanted to see what kind of prodigies would be revealed among the new students.The School of the Martial Market only admits new students once a year. The exam was naturally a major event.Three days ago, the students of Outer Palace who took Zhang Ruochen and others to Omen Ridge were mostly male students.However, that was not the case today. Over 70 percent were female students, with the male students as the remainders.The female students were all wearing white robes. Many of them were good-looking as if they were the beauties who had just walked out of an art piece.Zhang Ruochen stood at the foot of the Wu Tower and asked Liu Chengfeng, \u201cWhy are there so many female students of Outer Palace today?\u201dLiu Chengfeng responded. \u201cThe Yin flourishes while the Yang declines at West Campus of the School of the Martial Market. The female students have far more say than the male students. For example, taking us to and back from Omen Ridge, patrolling Omen Ridge. All these laborious jobs are given to the men.\u201dZhang Ruochen replied, \u201cThat\u2019s so unfair!\u201d\u201cExactly! But who dares to rebel? Who dares to challenge them? If you confront with them, you\u2019ll be dead. Especially the three female devils. One is worse than the last. If we become the students of Outer Palace of West Campus, we\u2019ll have to be careful when we see them.\u201d Liu Chengfeng wouldn\u2019t stop shaking his head and sighing.Zhang Ruochen smiled, but he did not take Liu Chengfeng\u2019s words seriously. As long as he was strong enough, he would not be afraid of being bullied by women.At this moment, the \u201cBreaking Through the Wu Tower\u201d had begun. 10 people entered the Wu Tower at a time.Elder Situ stood outside the main door to the Wu Tower, announcing the names of the first 10 people to enter the Tower. Those who were not called had to wait for the next round.After about three minutes, the first warrior who failed an obstacle walked out from the Wu Tower. His chest had a blood hole that bled continuously. It was a serious injury.Everyone was shocked and said, \u201cThat person\u2019s cultivation is at the Initial Stage of the Black Realm. He only lasted for three minutes before failing.\u201dThe warrior who had failed an obstacle said depressingly, \u201cI failed at the second obstacle on the first level. One moment of oversight, and I was attacked by\u2026\u201dHe was about to reveal his experience in the Wu Tower, but a presbyter standing far away gave a cold grunt and an invisible sound wave flew from his mouth. The young warrior\u2019s face turned white and he immediately swallowed the words he was about to say.Within only a quarter of an hour, the first group of warriors who entered the Tower had all came out one by one.Out of the 10 new students, three of them had passed three obstacles on the first level. Five had passed two, and two had only passed one.Yet, no one made it to the first obstacle on the second level.Those three who passed the first level had a large chance of passing the exam and becoming external students of the School. Of course, the final ranking would be determined by exactly how well they performed in the Tower.The next group of people entered the Wu Tower.There was a prodigy emerging from the second group. He made it through the second obstacle on the second level and almost passed the third obstacle.Someone recognized the prodigy, Chi Minghai of Flame Dragon Commandery. He was only 22 years old and had already reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm.A presbyter wearing an emerald gourd at his waist let out a gentle sigh. \u201cWhat a pity! He almost made it through the third obstacle on the second level.\u201dElder Xie said, \u201cThat\u2019s already remarkable for a new student. Looking at his performance inside the Tower, he\u2019ll definitely make into the top five, perhaps the top three.\u201dAnother presbyter smiled and said, \u201cIf no one else makes it through the third obstacle on the second level this year, does that mean he\u2019ll become the first of the new students this year?\u201dElder Situ stared at Prince Huo Xing standing in the crowd. He smiled slightly. \u201cThere\u2019ll definitely be someone who will pass the third obstacle on the second level. Just watch!\u201dElder Situ had great confidence in Prince Huo Xing. Given his current cultivation of the Dawn State, passing the third obstacle on the second level should not be a problem. He might even be able to pass the first obstacle on the third level.The second round continued. Soon after, it was Prince Huo Xing\u2019s turn.In just 10 minutes, the lights on the second level of the Wu Tower lit up, meaning Prince Huo Xing had already made it to the second level.\u201cTo make it to the second level in just 10 minutes, Prince Huo Xing is indeed extraordinary. He truly lives up to the name of a young prodigy of Square Commandery. Rumor has it, he\u2019s also a talented Tamer. Given his talent, he\u2019ll surely pass the third obstacle on the second level. The first place this year will surely belong to him!\u201d said a beautiful external female student, her eyes glowing with admiration.\u201cHuo Xiuxiu, are you thinking of becoming a Crown Princess?\u201d Another female student laughed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe female student of Outer Palace called Huo Xiuxiu said, \u201cSo what if I am? Prince Huo Xing is not only a Prince, but also a highly talented warrior. As long as you\u2019re a woman, who doesn\u2019t want to marry him?\u201d\u201cSwish!\u201dAfter an hour had passed, the lights on the third level of the Wu Tower lit up.This meant Prince Huo Xing had made it to the third level!At the foot of the Wu Tower, all the warriors were shocked and surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I heard that when the three female devils of the School of the Martial Market took their exams, they all passed the first obstacle on the third level.\u201d\u2026Everyone was discussing excitedly.Another 10 minutes or so passed and Prince Huo Xing finally walked out of the Wu Tower.Elder Situ immediately approached him and asked, \u201cDid you pass the first obstacle on the third level?\u201dPrince Huo Xing looked arrogantly towards the other young warriors with a smile on his face. His eyes focused on Zhang Ruochen, he smiled and said, \u201cI passed the first obstacle on the third level, but unfortunately I failed on the second.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Elder Situ was very pleased.After Prince Huo Xing spoke, excited chatter erupted from outside.\u201cIncredible!\u201d\u201cHe managed to pass the first obstacle of the third level! His talent is probably comparable to the three female devils who currently rule West Campus, or at least it\u2019s not far off.\u201d\u201cAmazing! Given Prince Huo Xing\u2019s incredible talent, he may break the current state of the Yin flourishing while the Yang declines,\u201d a male external student said excitedly.\u201cFirst place amongst the new students will surely belong to him.\u201dWith the cheers of the crowd, the next group entered the Wu Tower.In this group of warriors was not only Zi Qian, but the God\u2019s favored daughter of Moon Commandery, Yao Qingtong.10 people entered the Wu Tower at the same time.Four minutes later, the first warrior had failed an obstacle and walked out.10 minutes later, another five warriors walked out.Soon the light on the second level of the Tower ignited.The nine Elders under the Wu Tower all nodded. One of them said in praise, \u201cThis group of warriors is good. Four of them managed to enter the second level. I wonder how far they will go.\u201d\u201cYao Qingtong has been a prodigy since she was young. Her Sacred Mark was activated when she was four, and it was a sixth grade Blizzard Sacred Mark. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult for her to pass the third obstacle of the second level.\u201dElder Xie had full confidence in Zi Qian. He also thought that she had a chance to pass the third obstacle of the second level.An hour had passed. The light on the third level of the Wu Tower lit up.Only eight warriors had come out from the Tower. That meant two warriors had passed the third obstacle on the second level.In fact, those two had continued on to challenge the first obstacle of the third level!\u201cThose two are Yao Qingtong of Moon Commandery and Zi Qian of Yunwu Commandery. I didn\u2019t expect that West Campus would have two additional outstanding females this year.\u201dThe facial expressions of the nine presbyters were rather strange. After all, West Campus had seen the Yin flourish and the Yang decline for almost 100 years.They thought that there might be a chance to change this trend with the emergence of Prince Huo Xing. However, no one would have expected these two female prodigies to perform so well.It was getting dangerous now!If they passed the first obstacle of the third level, West Campus would continue to be ruled by female students for the next few years. It would be difficult for the male students to turn the tide.Prince Huo Xing gave a cold laugh and said, \u201cThe first obstacle of the third level is extremely difficult. Even I myself almost failed. They will definitely fail to pass it.\u201dZhang Ruochen was confident in Zi Qian\u2019s abilities. After all, she was descendant from the bloodline of Saints. She possessed an amazing physical quality with extremely good eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell.Her talent was definitely not inferior to that of Prince Huo Xing. Perhaps she was even slightly stronger than him.Shortly thereafter, Yao Qingtong and Zi Qian seemed to walk out of the Wu Tower at the same time.The nine presbyters immediately went to ask them what happened.Yao Qington replied, \u201cI passed the first obstacle of the third level, but failed on the second.\u201dZi Qian nodded and said, \u201cAs did I.\u201dThe nine presbyters all laughed together. The new students were very good this year. Three prodigies managed to pass the first obstacle of the third level.Throughout the history of West Campus, 10 years could go by without a single prodigy being able to pass the first obstacle of the third level.In recent years, however, it had become frequent.This was a great omen!If nothing went wrong, Prince Huo Xing, Yao Qingtong, and Zi Qian would be the top three students of this year. Their actual rankings would depend on their performance in the Wu Tower.\u201cMiss Zi is very powerful. She actually managed to make it passed the first obstacle of the third level. She will definitely receive a lot of training.\u201d A warrior of Yunwu Commandery said with great admiration.Liu Chengfeng\u2019s face revealed a bitter facial expression and said, \u201cThis year\u2019s new students are all freaks. I thought I could make it into the top 10, but now chances seem pretty slim.\u201d\u201cThe next round of Breaking Through the Wu Tower consists of Liu Chengfeng, Zhang Ruochen, Xie Zhaowu\u2026\u201dIncluding Liu Chengfeng and Zhang Ruochen, 10 young warriors walked out of the crowd and stood in front of the nine presbyters.A total of six warriors in the Initial Stage of the Black Realm, three in the Mid Stage, and one in the Dawn State.The Dawn State warrior was Xie Zhaowu, a prodigy from the Xie Family from Square Commandery.Xie Zhaowu glanced at Zhang Ruochen contemptuously and thought. \u201cTheir cultivation is rather weak. In this group of warriors, I\u2019m sure to stand out and have the best result.\u201dPrince Huo Xing stared at Zhang Ruochen with a furrowed brow. \u201cHe was able to kill Qing You, so he must be very talented. However, he is only a warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. He should at most pass the third obstacle of the second level.\u201dThe 10 warriors walked into the first level of the Wu Tower.Walking into the front door, another 10 small doors appeared inside.Above the 10 small doors were three ancient, carved characters, the First Obstacle.Zhang Ruochen looked very relaxed. He walked straight through the second small door. The other nine warriors also chose a door and walked through.As soon as he had only just entered the small door, Zhang Ruochen came to a closed Martial arts field. All four sides consisted of metal walls.This closed Martial arts field was quite large. It had a length and width of 20 meters, and a height of 30 meters. On the four metal walls were 16 alcoves each with a bronze light inside.Zhang Ruochen walked to the center of the Martial arts field and looked at the rock wall above.A young warrior about 20 years old walked out from the rock wall. He faced Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201cI am Luo Xu. I represent the most powerful force in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. If you can withstand three of my strikes, you will pass this first obstacle.\u201dThe Luo Xu standing in front of him was not a real person. It was a Spiritual Body created by the Wu Tower through the convergence of Spiritual Qi.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cYou represent the most powerful force in the Mid Stage?\u201dLuo Xu laughed and said, \u201cThe School of the Martial Market in Omen Ridge has been open for 460 years. Every year young warriors come to break through the Wu Tower. It not only includes new students like you, but also older students who have been practicing at West Campus for some time. I am the West Campus\u2019 strongest warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.\u201dZhang Ruochen seemed to understand something and said, \u201cIf my cultivation had reached the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, I would have met the strongest Advanced Stage warrior of the last 460 years?\u201dLuo Xu laughed. \u201cExactly.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and asked, \u201cWithstand three of your strikes, and I will pass this first obstacle?\u201d\u201cYou are correct.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat if I defeat you?\u201dLuo Xu replied, \u201cThen you will enter straight into the second level. You will also take my place and become the challenger to the Mid Stage warriors, but defeating me won\u2019t be an easy task.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s give it a try!\u201dZhang Ruochen lifted the Flashing Shining Sword. While holding it, he became one with the space surrounding him.He did not use the Space Domain, because he wanted to fight the strongest warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm in the last 460 years in an equal battle.At the center of the Wu Tower, two beautiful girls sat in a secret room.The woman surnamed Huang and the girl surnamed Duanmu sat cross-legged in the center of the secret room. In front of them were 10 Spiritual Qi mirrors floating in the air. The mirrors allowed them to see the progress of the 10 warriors.Normally, two silver robed Elders from the Martial School would watch the Wu Tower.The woman surnamed Huang and the girl surnamed Duanmu wanted to see the talents of the new students this year, so they made a deal with the two Elders that they would help watch the Wu Tower.The woman surnamed Huang had an aura of coldness and long jewel blue hair hung straight alongside her face, in contrast to her fair skin. She stared at the 10 Spiritual Qi mirrors and said coolly, \u201cAfter seeing Prince Huo Xing, Yao Qingtong, and Zi Qian, there\u2019s no point in watching the rest of the warriors in the Wu Tower. Even if prodigies do appear again, they won\u2019t be stronger than those three. Overall, this year\u2019s new students are good. I\u2019m going back to practice!\u201dThe woman surnamed Huang clearly seemed uninterested. When she stood up, her tall and elegant figure was very obvious. She walked towards the exit of the Wu Tower.The girl surnamed Duanmu continued to stare at one of the Spiritual Qi mirrors. Her eyes grew brighter and brighter, and she exclaimed. \u201cInteresting! So interesting!\u201dWalking almost to the door, the women surnamed Huang stopped and asked, \u201cDuanmu Xingling, are you going to keep watching?\u201dThe girl who appeared to be 13 or 14 years old was one of the three female devils of West Campus, Duanmu Xingling.The woman surnamed Huang was also one of the three female devils. Her name was Huang Yanchen.Both of them were in the Warrior of Division Profound. They were the masters of West Campus and no one dared challenge them.Duanmu Xingling waved to Huang Yanchen and said, \u201cSister Chen, come here. That warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm is battling Luo Xu, and actually holding his own.\u201d\u201cHow could it be? Luo Xu is the most talented prodigy that the Martial School in Omen Ridge has seen in the last 460 years. He\u2019s the ghost prodigy of a generation. Is it even possible that someone in the same realm can match him?\u201dHuang Yanchen was in disbelief, but she still went back and looked at the Spiritual Qi mirror.In the mirror, two males were engaged in a tense battle.They moved extremely fast, leaving behind streaks of shadows.Huang Yanchen\u2019s facial expression changed slightly. A pair of beautiful starlight eyes revealed a trace of delight, as if they had discovered a new land. She said, \u201cHow many strikes have they exchanged?\u201d\u201c74 strikes!\u201d Duanmu Xingling said.Huang Yanchen sat cross-legged on the ground again. Picking up a copy of the list, she looked at it and said, \u201cHe must be the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery, Zhang Ruochen. His name actually has the \u2018Chen\u2019 character. Doesn\u2019t he know that that is taboo?\u201dDuanmu Xingling laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make him change his name, are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait until he passes the Wu Tower.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIf he can withstand 100 strikes from Luo Xu, he\u2019s an outstanding prodigy. As long as he changes his name, I\u2019ll spare his life,\u201d Huang Yanchen said coldly.Huang Yanchen had a great appreciation for outstanding prodigies.Suddenly, the image on the Spiritual Qi mirror changed. Zhang Ruochen\u2019s sword technique became harsher, forcing Luo Xu to retreat continuously.\u201cHow could it be?\u201dBoth Duanmu Xingling and Huang Yanchen held their breath and stared closely at the mirror.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Striking out with his sword, he pierced Luo Xu\u2019s glabella.Luo Xu\u2019s body froze, and a cut appeared on his forehead.Zhang Ruochen withdrew the Flash Shining Sword and took three steps back.\u201cAmazing, you win. Your talent is superior to mine!\u201d Luo Xu said and laughed.His body became more and more dreamlike, disappearing into wisps of Spiritual Qi until he vanished completely.\u201cLuo Xu\u2019s cultivation was truly powerful. He managed to withstand 93 of my strikes. He lives up to the name of the strongest Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm in the last 460 years.\u201d\u201cOf course, if I\u2019d have used the power of Space Domain, I most likely would have defeated him within 10 strikes.\u201dZhang Ruochen put the Flash Shining Sword into its sheath. Opening the metal door, he went straight to the second level.Having defeated Luo Xu, Zhang Ruochen did not need to continue to the second and third obstacles on the first level. He could go directly to the second.Duanmu Xingling and Huang Yanchen let out a sigh of relief. Looking into each other\u2019s eyes, they could see their shock reflected back at them.\u201cHe managed to defeat Luo Xu within 100 strikes!\u201d Duanmu Lingxing still could not believe it.\u201cNot only defeated, but killed. He managed to kill Luo Xu who was in the same Realm as him within 100 strikes. That\u2019s scary.\u201d Huang Yanchen replied.\u201cI want to see how many levels and obstacles he can pass.\u201d Duanmu Xingling said and narrowed her eyes. She felt a great deal of curiosity towards Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen entered the first obstacle of the second level in the Wu Tower.It was a sealed Martial arts field, much like the one on the previous level.\u201cSwish!\u201dAnother Spiritual Body warrior emerged from the rock.It was Luo Xu again.Luo Xu looked at Zhang Ruochen and smiled. \u201cWe meet again!\u201dZhang Ruochen was surprised and asked, \u201cYou are the guardian of the second level as well?\u201dLuo Xu nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re correct! Now, if you can withstand one of my strikes, you pass the first obstacle on the second level. However, there\u2019s one thing I must tell you. I\u2019m now at the cultivation of the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm. I\u2019m also the strongest of the Advanced Stage warriors.\u201d\u201cThe strongest amongst the warriors in the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm?\u201d Zhang Ruochen said seriously. He dared not underestimate Luo Xu.Luo Xu was the strongest of the Mid Stage; now he is the strongest in the Advanced Stage?Given Luo Xu\u2019s current cultivation at the Advanced Stage, he shouldn\u2019t have any trouble defeating a warrior of the Dawn State of the Black Realm.Perhaps given his ability, he could even fight against warriors of the Medium State.If you were a warrior of the Mid Stage, it would be easier to try to climb straight up into the sky than to attempt to withstand a strike from a warrior of the Medium State.However, Zhang Ruochen was not your average warrior of the Mid Stage. Facing Luo Xu, he felt no fear at all and asked, \u201cWhat if I defeat you?\u201dLuo Xu smiled and said, \u201cIf you can defeat me, you can not only pass the other two obstacles on the second level, but you can also pass the first obstacle of the third level.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to use a weapon?\u201d Zhang Ruochen drew out his Flash Shining Sword and pointed it at Luo Xu.Luo Xu replied, \u201cIf I used a weapon, few people would be able to pass the first obstacle on the second level.\u201dIn fact, when other warriors were facing the first obstacle on the second floor, they were considered to have passed as long as they could stand after taking a strike from Luo Xu.\u201cOK! Let\u2019s fight!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.\u201cFirst strike, Water Luo out of Sea.\u201dLuo Xu\u2019s fingers clenched into a fist. Moving into his paces like a gust of wind, he reached a speed of 42 meters per second, a bit faster than that of normal warriors of the Mid Stage.A normal warrior of the Mid Stage probably wouldn\u2019t even see Luo Xu\u2019s shadow properly, much less withstand a strike from him.Zhang Ruochen did not use the power of his Space Domain. Instead, he moved his Spiritual Qi into his Eye and Ear Meridians, and determined where Luo Xu would strike using his sight and hearing.Zhang Ruochen moved his body one step to the left and avoided Luo Xu\u2019s fist. Zhang Ruochen swung out with his sword, aiming towards Luo Xu\u2019s waist.\u201cThe second strike, Water Luo Returning!\u201dLuo Xu\u2019s body leapt like a flying fish, bending into an arc with his fist aimed towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest. There seemed to be a little more power behind this strike than the previous one.His fist appeared in an instant in front of Zhang Ruochen.He would certainly be seriously wounded if he were to be hit by the fist.\u201cSacred Bell Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen blocked the fist with the flat side of his sword. His great Sword Breath converged into the illusion of a huge bell.\u201cBoom!\u201dLuo Xu\u2019s fist connected with the surface of the illusion. The bell was immediately dented and shattered. The strength behind the strike sent Zhang Ruochen back.Luo Xu did not give Zhang Ruochen any time to breathe. He immediately followed up with a third strike.\u201cThe third strike, Water Luo transfering Sword!\u201dLuo Xu struck out with his fist and flew towards Zhang Ruochen like a Sword Breath.Fist into sword.Only after having practiced the fists technique to a very high level could a warrior strike like a sword with their fists.\u201cLuo Xu is very powerful. If I hadn\u2019t practiced the Yellow Realm to the Ultimate Realm, we would be very evenly matched in the same Realm.\u201dAs Zhang Ruochen had practiced the Yellow Realm to the Ultimate Realm, he practiced one Realm higher than Luo Xu. That was why he was able to defeat Luo Xu before.Now Luo Xu was one Realm above Zhang Ruochen. If would be almost impossible to defeat him.\u201cSacred Guiding Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen swung out with his sword and broke Luo Xu\u2019s attack. Following the strike, he did not retreat. Instead, he took the initiative and attacked Luo Xu.Meanwhile, in the secret room inside the Wu Tower, Huang Yanchen stared at the Spiritual Qi mirrors and said, \u201cLuo Xu is using a low-class Spiritual grade martial technique, \u201936 Fists of the Water of Luo\u2019.\u201d\u201cSister Chen, while Luo Xu was in the Advanced Stage, how many fists of the \u201936 Fists of the Luo Water\u2019 did he learn?\u201d Duanmu Xingling asked.\u201cNine.\u201d Huang Chenyan replied.Duanmu Lingxing nodded and said, \u201cHow many fists do you think Zhang Ruochen can handle?\u201d\u201cHard to say.\u201dHuang Yanchen shook her head slightly and said, \u201cZhang Ruochen\u2019s talent is incredible. If he can withstand Luo Xu\u2019s nine fists, he can force Luo Xu to a draw.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Luo Xu is an incredible warrior. Few in the same Realm can challenge him, never mind defeating him across Realms.\u201d Duanmu Xingling said.\u201cWe\u2019ll find out! Zhang Ruochen has already withstood six of his fists.\u201d Huang Yanchen also found it incredible and had difficulty believing her own eyes.Luo Xu had been undefeated for the last 200 years. He has long been a legend of West Campus.It was already unbelievable that Zhang Ruochen had defeated Luo Xu in the same Realm. It would definitely shock the campus if news got out.If Zhang Ruochen managed to cross Realms and defeat Luo Xu, the result would be unimaginable.\u201cThe eighth strike, Water Luo transferring dragon!\u201dLuo Xu\u2019s strength became increasingly powerful. Waves of Genuine Qi circulated around his body forming layers of water waves.It was as if he was punching on top of a massive river, releasing the sound of flowing water in the air.\u201cHowl!\u201dThat giant river became a long water dragon over 10 meters long, surging towards Zhang Ruochen.\u201cSacred Breaking Plum Sword!\u201dZhang Ruochen struck out with his sword and struk the glabella of the water dragon.His strike did not pierce the water dragon\u2019s forehead. Instead, it seemed as though it slammed into a metal wall, screeching.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Flash Shining Sword in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand received a powerful shock, and almost flew out of his hand. His entire right arm went numb and he could not summon any strength into it at all.Luo Xu struck with his ninth Fist.\u201cThe ninth strike, Water Luo Crushing!\u201dZhang Ruochen gritted his teeth and would not admit defeat. Raising his left arm, he sent all the Genuine Qi in his body surging to his arm and cried, \u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth!\u201dThe third palm, Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe two fists collided.Two powerful forces clashed together, resulting in an ear-splitting sound.Zhang Ruochen spat out a mouthful of blood and flew backwards. He forced his body to recover its balance, taking a few steps back. Although he was hurt, he did not fall down. He summoned all the strength he had and remained standing.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hands were sore and cracked. If Luo Xu were to strike again, he would certainly be defeated.Zhang Ruochen stared at Luo Xu standing in front of him and said, \u201cYou win!\u201dLuo Xu shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s you who have won! I only learned nine of the \u201936 Fists of the Luo Water\u2019 when I was in the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm. Now I\u2019ve attacked with all nine fists, but still failed to knock you down.\u201d\u201cIn your first strike, you only used 20 percent of your strength. In your second strike, you used 30 percent. With each strike you increased your strength by 10 percent, only on your ninth strike did you use all of it. If you had attacked with all your strength from the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to block your nine strikes.\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied.Luo Xu smiled and said, \u201cThat may be true, however, other warriors of the Mid Stage only have to withstand one of my strikes at 20 percent and they will pass this obstacle.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded. He didn\u2019t feel disheartened at all. After all, his opponent was one of the strongest warriors in 460 years. Being in a Realm inferior to him, there was no shame in being defeated.Zhang Ruochen also hadn\u2019t used the Space Domain.If he had, it would be hard to say who would win.The Luo Xu he saw now was only an illusion created with Spiritual Qi by the Wu Tower. He was not a real person. The battle ability of this illusion could never represent Luo Xu\u2019s true abilities!There was no point guessing who would have won.Zhang Ruochen rested a while until he felt mostly recovered. Then he walked to the metal door and went to the second obstacle on the second level.Zhang Ruochen did not defeat Luo Xu, so he had to pass the second and third obstacles on the second level.The second obstacle on the second level was a corridor 30 meters long and only three meters wide. On the wall of each side were small round holes.\u201cWhew!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWalking into the corridor, short arrows in the length of a hand shot out of the holes.Zhang Ruochen did not draw his sword. Instead, he waved his sheath in the air knocking all the arrows aside.He walked slowly down the 30 meter long corridor. His feet never stopped moving and he seemed quite relaxed.This obstacle was easy only for him.If it were any other warrior of the Mid Stage, avoiding the dense rain of arrows would not be an easy task!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A line of words appeared on the jade tablet. \u201cCount the number of ripples in the pool, no more than 10 ripples error\u201d\u201cCount the ripples, what does that mean?\u201dHe didn\u2019t react as he heard the splash.\u201cSplash!\u201dA silver coin had fallen onto the calm surface of the pool.Immediately, ripples appeared in the center of the pool where they radiated to the outer edge.Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t understand the purpose of this pass, but he concentrated on counting the ripples on the water\u2019s surface. \u201cOne, two, three\u2026\u201dThe ripples became thinner and weaker, making them more difficult to count.\u201cThis is to test the ability of the warriors\u2019 Spiritual Power, observation, judgment, and willpower.\u201d Zhang Ruochen thought.His eyes became dry and started to sting, but he continued to stare at the surface without blinking.While the task seemed simple, it contained some great truths about martial arts.The First truth was Spiritual Power. If your Spiritual Power wasn\u2019t strong enough, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the slight changes in the ripple.The second truth was observation. Only those, who were observant, were able to see every ripple because the ripples spread from the center and then returned after hitting the wall, which could affect the warrior\u2019s observation. Warriors who lacked observation would get nervous when the ripples returned. Then they would fail.The third truth was judgment. As the ripples became fainter and fainter and the surface returned to calmness, this was the time to test the warrior\u2019s judgment. The warrior must decide when the ripples had disappeared and the water was considered calm.The final truth of this test was willpower. As a warrior concentrated on counting the number of ripples, their eyes would tire and a warrior that lacked willpower would give up before the end.After 15 minutes, the surface finally returned to its former calmness.Zhang Ruochen felt a pain in his eyes and closed them for a while. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019ve opened up my eye vessel which facilitates the ability of my eyesight. Hence my eyesight is stronger than warriors who are in the same Realm. My Spiritual Power reaches level 30, so I can distinguish each ripple. It\u2019s not difficult for me to complete this pass.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked towards the jade tablet, picked up a pen and wrote down a number on it.2765 ripples!\u201cWaaa!\u201dA white light lit up the tablet and displayed this word: pass.Zhang Ruochen smiled slightly. \u201cJust like I had thought. But, this is a messed up pass. It\u2019s no wonder not many can\u2019t successfully complete this task. This tests the warrior\u2019s overall ability.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dThe door to the third floor opened.Zhang Ruochen went straight through the door, climbed the stairs and arrived at the third floor of the Wu Tower.The lights on the third floor of the Wu Tower were lit up.Right now, all the young warriors and the nine presbyters outside the tower were shocked again.Eight of the 10 warriors that had entered the tower with Zhang Ruochen, were all defeated. Only Xie Zhaowu of Square Commandery and Zhang Ruochen of Yunwu Commandery still remained in the tower.\u201cThere are warriors that made it through the third pass on the second level and they entered the third floor. Who do you think it is?\u201d\u201cIt must be Xie Zhaowu, warrior of Square Commandery.\u201d\u201cYes! It must be him! Although he\u2019s less famous than Prince Huo Xing and Qing You, he\u2019s still a genius with his cultivation of the Dawn State of the Black Realm. How can he be mediocre since he\u2019s young and has reached the Dawn State of the Black Realm!\u201dNo one believed that Zhang Ruochen would have the ability to pass the third pass on the second level. After all, he was only 16 and had just reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.Even Elder Situ nodded and said, \u201cXie Zhaowu must have hidden his actual strength in the past in order to set the world on fire when he breaks through the Wu Tower. He\u2019s going to obtain great achievements with such wise thinking.\u201dThe other presbyters all gazed coldly because they didn\u2019t like to see Elder Situ\u2019s proud look.Elder Situ was the receptionist of Square Commandery. The better the warriors\u2019 grades, the more rewards Elder Situ received.When he saw the third level illuminate, he couldn\u2019t help laughing with smug satisfaction.However, the next second, he was frozen.\u201cCheeka!\u201dThe gate opened and the one who emerged in despair was not Zhang Ruochen, but Xie Zhaowu.When Xie Zhaowu raised his head, he noticed that the nine presbyters were looking at him. He was so surprised that he stepped backward.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he thought.Elder Situ immediately approached him and asked, \u201cHow many barriers did you get through?\u201dXie Zhaowu stepped back again as if he were scared by Elder Situ\u2019s overbearing look. Once he was able to stand steady, he said, \u201cI broke through the second pass on the second level, but I failed at the third pass. Elder Situ, what has happened?\u201dElder Situ\u2019s face turned red. He was angry and shouted. \u201cSince you failed on that level, why has the light on the third level turned on?\u201cWhat, the light is on?\u201d Xie Zhaowu was more surprised than Elder Situ.Standing not far away, Elder Xie laughed before saying, \u201cYou should know that there\u2019s still another young warrior in the Wu Tower. Since Xie Zhaowu failed, the other warrior must have broken through the third pass of the second level.\u201d\u201cZhang Ruochen, the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery.\u201dFinally, all of them recognized what was happening and displayed a look of shock.It was unbelievable that a warrior who was in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm could break through to the third pass!Only Zi Qian remained calm because she knew how strong Zhang Ruochen was. It would have been strange to her if he didn\u2019t break through.\u201cBack-off!\u201d Elder Situ glared at Xie Zhaowu and said, \u201cSomebody, get me Zhang Ruochen\u2019s information.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe a warrior at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm could break through to the third pass. He wanted to know more about Zhang Ruochen.Shortly thereafter, an external student of the school handed over Zhang Ruochen\u2019s information to Elder Situ.\u201cHow can this be?\u201dAfter reading his details, Elder Situ was so shocked. He looked as if his eyes were going to fall out of his head.The other eight presbyters looked curious and wanted to know what it was about Zhang Ruochen\u2019s details that made Elder Situ look so surprised?\u201cCalm down! Calm down! Elder Situ, you are mature enough to keep calm. It\u2019s just information about a genius. Why are you so surprised?\u201d Elder Xie laughed.Elder Situ looked serious and said, \u201cStop saying those irresponsible and sarcastic remarks. Come and take a look yourself.\u201dThe eight presbyters looked at each other blankly before walking towards Elder Situ, looking at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s information.After reading it, they all showed the same expression as Elder Situ. They were shocked and speechless for a long time.\u201cHe didn\u2019t open up his Sacred Mark until he was 16. I guess it has been less than a year since then? After less than a year of practice, he was able to reach the Mid Stage of the Black Realm?\u201d\u201cLook at this, after only six months\u2019 practice, he became a warrior of the Yellow Board and ranked as first. Oh, god! What a magnificent genius he is.\u201dElder Xie was the receptionist for the young warriors of Yunwu Commandery, but he hadn\u2019t read Zhang Ruochen\u2019s information.This was the first time that he read it and he shouted. \u201cLiu Chuanshen, you\u2019re a jerk! Why didn\u2019t he tell me that Zhang Ruochen was so incredible? What a pity! What a pity!\u201dElder Xie was so upset and regret filled. If he had known that Zhang Ruochen was so talented, he would have taken him as his apprentice on the way to the School of the Martial Market.But, it was too late now!A genius with this gift must be accepted by the dean of Western Campus as his own disciple. He\u2019d have no chance.Elder Xie scolded Liu Chuanshen.Standing not far away, Liu Chengfeng felt displeased and whispered, \u201cUncle Xie has always been polite. Why did he scold my father all of a sudden? Well, just let it go. He is an elder, and I\u2019m not going to argue with him.\u201dLiu Chengfeng was also depressed.\u2026Zhang Ruochen walked into the first pass on the third level. It was still a sealed Martial arts field, much like the one on the previous level.\u201cWaaa!\u201dThe Spiritual Body of Luo Xu walked out of the wall again.Luo Xu looked at Zhang Ruochen and laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fight me again. You\u2019ve already defeated me on the previous level.\u201dZhang Ruochen could sense that Luo Xu was still at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm. He asked, \u201cHow many strikes do I have to catch in order to pass this barrier?\u201d\u201cThree strikes,\u201d Luo Xu answered.The first strike of Luo Xu was at 20% power, the second at 30%, and the third at 40%.He only needs to catch three attacks of Luo Xu and then he would be able to pass the first obstacle on the third level.It was known that Zhang Ruochen had caught all nine strikes in the first barrier on the second floor, so he should pass this barrier quickly.Zhang Ruochen stared at Luo Xu and said, \u201cI have a question!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI can answer one question for you.\u201d Luo Xu laughed.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been the most powerful warrior of the Mid Stage and Advanced Stage of the Black Realm for 460 years in Western Campus. Are you also the most powerful warrior in the seventh Realm of the Black Realm?\u201dLuo Xu said, \u201cIt was true before you appeared, but now that you have shown up. I believe that you\u2019ll replace me and become the new gatekeeper of the Wu Tower for every Realm.\u201dAfter that, Luo Xu turned into a wisp of Spiritual Qi and disappeared in the Martial arts field.Zhang Ruochen laughed lightly and walked towards the second barrier on the third floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It must be more difficult than the one on the second floor.\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at the rules for breaking through blockades on the wall.\u201cEasy job.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and opened the door to the second pass on the third floor.It was a 30-meter-long enclosed corridor that was only three meters wide. There were nine bronze metal statues on both sides of the corridor.There were 18 bronze statues in total.According to the rules, every bronze statue was refined by a weapon refiner and weighed around 1,000 pounds. There was an inscription and a Spiritual Crystal embedded in their body, as hard as the Genuine Martial Arms.The weapon refiner named them the refining warriors.The power and speed of each refining warrior were equal to a warrior at the peak of the Advanced Stage in the Black Realm.Be mindful, the refining warrior\u2019s body was as hard as iron and its strength was mighty, without any bug. When it came to a real fight, a refining warrior could defeat a warrior of the Dawn State in the Black Realm.That\u2019s to say, Zhang Ruochen was facing 18 refining warriors who were equal to the warriors in the Black Realm\u2019s Dawn State, in such a narrow corridor.It\u2019s nearly impossible for a warrior in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm to pass this corridor.\u201cZi Qian, Prince Huo Xing, and Yao Qingtong, whose cultivation are in the Dawn State of the Black Realm, must have been defeated by these 18 refining warriors of the Final State of the Black Realm. This pass is exceptionally freaky!\u201dZhang Ruochen retracted his Flash Shinning Sword, because weapons were not allowed in this pass.\u201cLet\u2019s fight!\u201dZhang Ruochen rolled up his sleeves. With a determined look, he stepped into the corridor.At the head of the corridor stood two refining warriors. They moved their bodies slightly, with gleaming fire in their eyes.The sound of metal hitting metal echoed, as the two refining warriors woke up.\u201cBang!\u201dThe two refining warriors attacked at the same time.The refining warrior on the left punched at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s face. His fist puffed fire like the Flaming Fist and exploded the horrible power towards Zhang Ruochen.The refining warrior on the right reached out one leg with the icing cold power and swept towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s lower body.Their speed was so fast that Zhang Ruochen couldn\u2019t avoid their attacks in such a narrow space.Zhang Ruochen leaned back and dodged the metal fist while quickly punched the refining warrior\u2019s chest.\u201cBoom!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s powerful palm slapped down the refining warrior and its whole body was knocked against the wall, making the wall shake slightly.But, the refining warrior wasn\u2019t hurt and quickly fought back.\u201cAn immortal?\u201d Zhang Ruochen thought.His speed was faster than that of the two refining warriors. He walked three steps forward to avoid their continued attack.However, there was a bigger crisis.Zhang Ruochen had woken up another two of the refining warriors as he walked forward.Zhang Ruochen was surrounded by the four refining warriors and they were attacking at the same time.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dFour refining warriors, eight metal arms, and eight legs all attacked towards Zhang Ruochen simultaneously.He was surrounded by palms and foot shadows.Zhang Ruochen quickly ran his Genuine Qi, moving his legs to attack and sweep, while his palms waved to attack and defend.\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201dZhang Ruochen unleashed four palms at a fast speed.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe four refining warriors were knocked hard, and they landed far away from Zhang Ruochen. Some hit the wall, while the others fell to the ground.Zhang Ruochen continued ahead. Two more refining warriors struck him, together, the former four refining warriors again caught up with him.An idea flashed through his mind. \u201cI have to end the battle quickly. If I\u2019m surrounded by 18 refining warriors, there\u2019s no doubt that I\u2019ll lose.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dWhile squatting, Zhang Ruochen waved his arms to slap down the refining warrior on his left, which knocked down the four refining warriors who were chasing after him.He quickened his pace and rushed forward.\u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth!\u201d\u201cDragon in the Sky!\u201d\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201d\u2026\u201cBang Bang!\u201dZhang Ruochen went through the long corridor extremely quickly.Once he had made it through the long corridor, the 18 refining warriors returned back to their position and stood still.Looking at his bruised arm, Zhang Ruochen sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s wasn\u2019t wise to fight against the refining warriors with my fleshy body. However, I made it.\u201dZhang Ruochen kept walking towards the third pass, on the third floor.\u201cThe freak! He just passed the second pass without being wounded. Perhaps he\u2019ll make it through the third pass with his abilities.\u201d Duanmu Xingling crossed her arms tightly, stared at the mirror, and felt unpleasant.It was known that she didn\u2019t pass the second pass on the third floor when she first entered the Wu Tower.According to the Western Yard\u2019s history, only three people have gotten through the second pass on the third floor for their first time entering the Wu Tower.Zhang Ruochen was now the fourth one.Duanmu Xingling asked, \u201cSister Chen, do you think that he can pass the third pass on the third floor?\u201dAfter thinking for a second, Huang Yanchen said, \u201cIn the history of the Western Campus, only one freshman has passed the third pass. That\u2019s Luo Xu, the warrior who currently guards the pass. Since Zhang Ruochen has defeated Luo Xu, in the same Realm, he might break through the third pass.\u201cMoreover, if he passes the third pass on the third floor, he doesn\u2019t need to pass the first pass on the fourth floor, because he had already passed it when he made it through the first pass on the second floor.\u201dThe first pass on the fourth floor was to catch the nine fists of Luo Xu.Zhang Ruochen had made it through that on the first pass on the second floor.Duanmu Xingling blinked lightly as if she was thinking and said, \u201cIf he passes the first pass on the fourth floor, he must cover our limelight and become the spotlight of the School of the Martial Market. I guess he\u2019ll also shock the Internal of the School.\u201dHuang Yanchen asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dDuanmu Xingling smiled and said, \u201cIf he passes the third pass on the third floor, we\u2019ll keep him from entering the fourth floor.\u201dHuang Yanchen nodded and said, \u201cRight. Since the male students of Western Campus called us the devil, we should do what a devil would do. For example, to suppress the freshmen.\u201d\u201cInstead of suppressing him, we are saving him. It\u2019s not a good thing for him to show such an incredible performance.\u201d Duanmu Xingling convinced herself, nodded slightly and said to herself, \u201cEverything I do is good for him.\u201dBut, the evil smile on her face betrayed her.She looked like a devil, rather than a little girl around the age of 13 or 14.The second pass on the third floor was just like the third pass on the second floor. There was another pool, nine square meters, and what the warriors had to do was count ripples.The difference was that two silver coins fell into the pool at the same time, forming two sets of ripples.A warrior must focus his mind on the two ripples without any negligence.When the two silver coins fell into the water at the same time, it would interfere the progress of counting and increase the difficulty.If a warrior wanted to keep his mind focused on two things at the same time, his Spiritual Power must have reached level 20.If he wanted to clearly count the number of ripples, his Spiritual Power must reach level 25 since level 20 isn\u2019t good enough.It was known that except for the weapon refiner, the alchemist, and the animal trainer, whose major is practicing Spiritual Power, none of the warriors would waste their time on Spiritual Power.If a warrior didn\u2019t practice their Spiritual Power purposely, their Spiritual Power would only reach level 20 to level 25, even if he was a warrior of the Heaven Realm.It was impossible for a young warrior to pass this pass.Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for Zhang Ruochen, whose Spiritual Power had reached level 30.When the surface of the water was completely calm, Zhang Ruochen wrote down the number of ripples on the jade tablet. As expected, he passed it easily.Zhang Ruochen thought. \u201cThe most outstanding freshman only passed the first pass on the third floor. Now, I\u2019ve passed the third pass on the third floor. Surely I\u2019ll be the number one freshman this year. In this case, I don\u2019t think passing the fourth floor is a good idea.\u201dHe was not a person who liked to show off. Since he wouldn\u2019t be gotten more prizes for passing the fourth floor in the Wu Tower, he decided to leave.When he was about to leave, two beauties walked out from the golden gate and blocked his way.\u201cZhang Ruochen, you\u2019re not supposed to go to the fourth floor.\u201dHuang Yanchen stood upright, lifted her chin, and looked at Zhang Ruochen arrogantly with her hands behind her back.She was about 1.75 meters tall. She stood on a step which made her look even more slender with her long legs. Her figure was perfect.Zhang Ruochen looked at her beautiful face and said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go to the fourth floor since I\u2019ve broken through the third pass on the third floor?\u201dHe didn\u2019t plan to go to the fourth floor. But, he didn\u2019t want to be blocked by others.\u201cWhat did they want?\u201dZhang Ruochen had heard about them. They were both masters of the Profound Board. They had a powerful cultivation and were absolutely flawless. Even the seniors were afraid of them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, this meant nothing to Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen wasn\u2019t afraid. He was in the Wu Tower and he didn\u2019t need to have the worry that they would kill him.Huang Yanchen said seriously, \u201cWe are saving you, rather than hurting you. If you perform too well, of course, you will get a great number of resources and become a key person which will be trained by the school. But, if you go too far, you\u2019ll suffer a fatal disaster.\u201d\u201cThat sounds like a little bit of truth.\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cBut, we\u2019re neither relative nor friend. Why are you concerned about me? Why are you being unreasonable? What exactly do you want? Just spit it out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Transn Editor: TransnHuang Yanchen, a beautiful woman with an unapproachable expression on her face, said, \u201cTo tell you the truth, it doesn\u2019t matter. I assume you\u2019ve heard of the three she-devils of Western Campus?\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cA little.\u201dHuang Yanchen continued, \u201cDid you know that one of them is a descendant of Luo Xu?\u201dSurprised by her words, Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cA descendant of Luo Xu?\u201dZhang Ruochen had a lot of admiration for Luo Xu because he was difficult to defeat in the same realm. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible at all had he not practiced the Ultimate Realm of the Yellow Realm.When she saw the expression on his face, she said with a faint smile, \u201cOne she-devil is called Luo Shuihan. She is the seventh generation down from Luo Xu. She sees him as a role model and is determined to become a strong Martial Arts warrior as great as her predecessor. I wonder whether she would kill you if she knew you\u2019ve defeated her predecessor in the same realm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say!\u201d he responded.According to Zhang Ruochen, women were unintelligent and difficult to understand. Princess Chi Yao in his previous life for example, and Lin Ningshan in the present.He still couldn\u2019t figure out why they wanted to kill him.\u201cDo you know what the two most intolerable things are for Luo Shuihan?\u201d Huang Yanchen asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.\u201cAccording to her, first, nobody is a better warrior than Luo Xu; second, no one was superior to her.\u201d\u201cShe only got through to the second obstacle of the third floor the first time she went into the Wu Tower. You, however, got to the third obstacle of the same floor. If she ever finds out she will surely challenge you to a duel. But your present cultivation is far from hers. One attack from her could kill you 10 times over.\u201dAlthough what Huang Yanchen said seemed to be true, Zhang Ruochen was not at all afraid. \u201cI hardly think she would dare to kill me in the Martial Market\u2019s School,\u201d he said.\u201cWell!\u201d She smiled, blinked her eyes and said, \u201cNinth Prince, do you think that \u2018devil\u2019 is just a random title? Luo Shuihan\u2019s has the power to kill you without anyone noticing. Even the presbyters of the Martial Market\u2019s School would not be able to find your body.\u201d\u201cYou have spent a lot of time persuading me to give up, but neither of you have answered my question. You don\u2019t even know me. Why do you care so much about my life? Or do you want to stop me from breaking into the fourth floor of the Wu Tower?\u201d He replied.Both Huang Yanchen and Duanmu Xingling felt awkward. It was their first time talking to such a tactless freshman of Western Campus.If only they weren\u2019t in the Wu Tower. Then they would break his legs to show him how powerful devils really were.The expressions on their faces showed Zhang Ruochen that he had guessed correctly. They did want to stop him from breaking into the fourth floor of Wu Tower. Both of them were Division Profound warriors who were very powerful on Western Campus. Even if they weren\u2019t devils, their power was almost equal to that of the three devils.It was not easy for Zhang Ruochen to take control over of the situation due to the fact that their cultivation was much more powerful than his.\u201cActually, I might fail to pass through to the fourth floor,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.Huang Yanchen nodded slightly and smiled, implying that Zhang Ruochen was very perceptive.\u201cBut you have to meet my demands!\u201d Zhang Ruochen added suddenly.The smile on Huang Yanchen\u2019s face disappeared instantly.How dare this freshman negotiate with her! It seemed that the only means of teaching him the meaning of the word \u201cdevil\u201d was to punch him very hard.Although he sensed that something was wrong, Zhang Ruochen remained confident and said, \u201cPlease allow me to continue to the fourth floor if you have no intention of meeting my demands.\u201dDuanmu Xingling whispered, \u201cSister Chen, we cannot break the law of the School in the Wu Tower. We can teach him a lesson when we get out of here. Let\u2019s hear him out. If it is a reasonable demand, why not give it to him?\u201dHuang Yanchen withdrew her power with a sneer and said, \u201cGo ahead! What\u2019s your demand?\u201dZhang Ruochen seemed to predict their compromise and said, \u201cIt is well known that I am the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery, which has always been the rival of Square Commandery. The power of Square Commandery in the School of the Martial Market is relatively strong. Their warriors will attempt to attack me considering my status. Thus, my demand is that you two save me if I\u2019m in danger.\u201dDuanmu Xingling giggled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so cute! Although the power of Square Commandery is indeed strong in Western Campus, they still need to take us seriously. Rest assured, Ninth Prince! From now on, you just need to say my name, and no one will dare attack you!\u201d\u201cSo you accept my demand?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of cake,\u201d Huang Yanchen said in a cold voice.\u201cIf others besides warriors of the Square decide to cause me trouble?\u201d Zhang Ruochen continued.Duanmu Xingling laughed and said, \u201cAnyone who wants to trouble you in Western Campus will be driven away by us.\u201dZhang Ruochen let out a slight sigh of relief when they agreed.He wasn\u2019t so much worried about the Square Commandery\u2019s warriors, but he did need to defend himself against killers from the Hades Department.Since Zi Qian had failed to kill him, more terrible killers from the Hades Department would be sent to assassinate him. With his present cultivation, his recklessness was likely get himself killed.Now that Huang Yanchen and Duanmu Xingling had promised to protect him, he felt much safer from the assassination attempts of the Hades Department.Zhang Ruochen hadn\u2019t intended to get to the fourth floor of the Wu Tower anyway. Now he had the bonus of getting a promise from two Division Profound warriors.Zhang Ruochen had another question. \u201cWhen I was on the first floor of the Wu Tower, I defeated Luo Xu at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. Doing so meant that I would become the guard instead of Luo Xu, testing warriors in that Realm\u2019s Stage. Once I become the guard, the devil Luo Shuihan will know I have defeated her ancestor. What should I do when she finds out?\u201dHuang Yanchen answered, \u201cThe Wu Tower is a Genuine Martial Arm without wisdom. If you want to be the guard and test warriors in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, you must draw inscriptions of your power, speed, and martial technique. Only then can your Spiritual Body be formed in the Wu Tower.\u201d\u201cHow many people know that I have defeated Luo Xu in the same realm?\u201d\u201cOnly the three of us.\u201d Huang Yanchen replied.\u201cThat means that if you don\u2019t tell the presbyter I have defeated Luo Xu, he will still be the guard of the Wu Tower?\u201d he asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Huang Yanchen answered.Zhang Ruochen murmured, \u201cThe presbyter would let two students guard the tower on such an important reception day? He seems unreliable!\u201dHuang Yanchen heard what he said and sneered. \u201cThe presbyter of the Wu Tower is a normal person, who wants to spend more time practicing and trying to break through to a higher realm. He is delighted to have someone else guard the Wu Tower. Besides, the Wu Tower is able to record each warrior so it doesn\u2019t matter if there is a guard here or not.\u201dThat explains that.\u201cCan you tell me your name?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.\u201cHuang Yanchen.\u201d she responded indifferently.He remembered the names of Huang Yanchen and Duanmu Xingling. Then he leisurely walked towards the exit of the Wu Tower.Duanmu Xingling let out a long sigh of relief after he left and said, \u201cIt was very difficult dealing with him!\u201dHuang Yanchen gave a sweet smile and said, \u201cLet\u2019s give him a lesson in Dragon Martial Temple later. A freshman dares to negotiate with me? Let\u2019s see how strong he really is.\u201dNine presbyters and many young warriors had been waiting for a long time outside the Wu Tower. They did not however, see Zhang Ruochen come out.\u201cWhy is he still in the tower? Could he have gotten through the first barrier of the third floor?\u201d\u201cHow? Maybe he died in the tower!\u201d A Square Commandery warrior sneered.Prince Huo Xing smiled and said, \u201cThe Wu Tower is indeed full of dangers. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he died in there.\u201dZi Qian, Elder Xie, and the Yunwu Commandery warriors were starting to get anxious. They thought maybe he had had an accident.\u201cCheeka!\u201dZhang Ruochen suddenly walked out of the Wu Tower. He was not only alive but wasn\u2019t injured at all.A smile appeared on Elder Xie\u2019s face. He immediately walked to him and asked, \u201cHow many levels have you broken through, Zhang Ruochen?\u201d\u201cThe second obstacle of the third floor.\u201d he responded.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. After all, you have only just reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm\u2026 Wait a second! What did you say? You got passed the second barrier on the third floor?\u201d Elder Xie was stunned. He had bloodshot eyes and goosebumps all over his body.The other eight presbyters were all stunned as well.In the history of Western Campus, only three people had successfully passed the second obstacle of the third floor on their first attempt in the Wu Tower.Could Zhang Ruochen be the fourth?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euElder Situ was annoyed and said in a muffled voice, \u201cZhang Ruochen, you should never lie to the nine presbyters. Do you know the consequences of lying?\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t care. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why getting passed the second obstacle of the third floor is such a big deal.\u201dElder Situ was really angry. A junior in the Mid Stage of the Black Realm told him that getting passed the second obstacle was not such a big deal? Doesn\u2019t he realize that he is making everyone uncomfortable?It was well known that Elder Situ had passed the second obstacle of the third floor on his first attempt.Elder Situ still didn\u2019t believe it and said, \u201cI need to take a look at the record of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s grades in the Wu Tower. I propose to open the mirror of the Spiritual Qi in the third floor of the Wu Tower.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They did not know how many obstacles Zhang Ruochen had passed.Not only was Elder Situ in disbelief, but most of the young warriors outside were also highly skeptical.After all, for a new student, to pass the second obstacle on the third floor was startling news for everyone.Elder Situ walked to the main doors of the Wu Tower and pressed his hand into a dent in the metal wall where he injected his Genuine Qi.The Wu Tower was a Genuine Martial Arms. With the energy of Elder Situ\u2019s Genuine Qi, the inscriptions on parts of the Wu Tower came alive.\u201cBeep!\u201dThe Spiritual Qi mirror on the third floor instantly began to glow white.The image of Zhang Ruochen attempting the second obstacle on the third floor appeared on its surface.The nine presbyters, 468 new students, and many senior students stood outside the Tower all staring at the Spiritual Qi mirror.It showed Zhang Ruochen fighting against 18 refining warriors. He was fighting bravely. Each of his movements was as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. He cut through the 18 refining warriors like a hot knife through butter and defeated them all.Seeing the battle, the warriors all grew envious, and wished they were Zhang Ruochen fighting against the 18 refining warriors.The female students stared with glittering eyes and had expressions of surprise on their faces. By the end of the battle, they all looked at Zhang Ruochen with admiration.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s performance in the Wu Tower was incredible.In a world where martial prowess was highly respected, young men like Zhang Ruochen had a lot of girls going crazy over him.\u201cDespicable! He actually managed to get through the second obstacle on the third floor!\u201dPrince Huo Xing stood amongst the freshmen and gazed coldly at Zhang Ruochen. He decided that he had to get rid of the Yunwu Commandery\u2019s Ninth Prince.Prince Huo Xing, Zi Qian, and Yao Qingtong were all rare talents, but compared to Zhang Ruochen, they were in different leagues altogether.They were almost entirely outshined by Zhang Ruochen.He was the fourth person in the history of Western Campus to accomplish this feat. Who can compare to him?None of the other freshmen or geniuses managed to pass the third obstacle of the second floor.By nightfall, Breaking Through the Wu Tower finally ended and 120 of the most talented students became external students of Western Campus in the School of the Martial Market.The rankings of the new 120 students were quickly assessed. Not surprisingly Zhang Ruochen was ranked number one out of the freshmen.Zi Qian was second, Prince Huo Xing was third, and Yao Qingtong ranked fourth.There were six females and four males in the top 10 of the new students.Luckily, Zhang Ruochen was the top student or this year\u2019s female students would have trumped the male students again.A total of 15 warriors from Yunwu Commandery and 38 from Square Commandery became the external students of Western Campus.Overall, in terms of freshmen, Square Commandery had a definite advantage in numbers. However, Yunwu Commandery won first and second place which gave them the better turn out.Western Campus accepts 120 new students each year and more than half were from Square Commandery. However, they didn\u2019t represent even one-third of the new students this year, which made Prince Huo Xing look bad.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian hunting down 10 of the prodigies from Square Commandery in the first round this year, we would have far more than 38 warriors become external students of the school.\u201d Prince Huo Xing\u2019s expression was very serious, and he did nothing to hide his murderous gaze.\u201cYour Majesty, no matter how genius Zhang Ruochen is, he is only at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. Given the power of Square Commandery on Western Campus, getting rid of him will be an easy task. As for Zi Qian, killing her seems like such a waste. Why not have her as a concubine?\u201d Xie Zhaowu said.Prince Huo Xing\u2019s mind clicked, and his eyes narrowed. He smiled and said, \u201cZi Qian is very talented, she is even ranked above me. If I could have her as a concubine, it would make me even more powerful. But she is very close to Zhang Ruochen, would she agree to this?\u201dXie Zhaowu smiled and said, \u201cZhang Ruochen is the prince of an inferior commandery. If Square Commandery attacked them, he wouldn\u2019t even be a prince. Zi Qian is a smart woman, I believe she will make the right decision. If she continues to resist, we can always take more extreme measures and force her to submit. Faced with violence, I don\u2019t think she will resist.\u201dPrince Huo Xing\u2019s face revealed a pleased expression and he shifted his gaze to Zi Qian. He noticed she was indeed very beautiful. It would be wonderful if he could have her as a concubine.When Prince Huo Xing\u2019s gaze again fell on Zhang Ruochen, the smile on his face disappeared. \u201cZhang Ruochen must die! Xie Zhaowu, go tell Feng Zhilin to come see me tonight.\u201dFeng Zhilin was the older brother of Feng Zhiyi. He had become an external student of the Martial School two years ago, and his martial cultivation had already reached the Final State of the Black Realm.Prince Huo Xing decided to use Feng Zhilin to deal with Zhang Ruochen.Feng Zhilin\u2019s own brother died at the hands of Zhang Ruochen. Being the elder brother, how could he not avenge his sibling?Becoming an external student meant they must collect the specific robes as well as a waist token and residence key.The robes of the external students were all plain white robes.The student\u2019s waist token was more elaborate. It was a piece of carved white jade, inscribed and refined into a Genuine Martial Arms. It was about the size of a palm.The waist token not only recorded the information of a student, it also recorded their merits.For example, Zhang Ruochen was this year\u2019s top new student and was awarded 3,000 points, so his waist token displayed his merit as 3,000 points.Zi Qian was the second best student and was awarded 2,000 merit points, which were also recorded on her waist token.As for Liu Chengfeng, he was ranked 14th, so his waist token showed five merit points.Each month the external students are given five points of merit. Those who did not rank in the top 10 were also given five points.In the School of the Martial Market, all Practice resources were exchanged for merit points.Without merit points, progress would be slow and difficult.They were a measurement of your contribution to the Martial School. Other than the five merit points given out each month, additional merit points had to be earned.The waist tokens also recorded each student\u2019s ability ranking.Zhang Ruochen infused his Genuine Qi into the waist token. His ability ranking of 670 appeared on the token.Zi Qian also infused Genuine Qi into her waist token, 597.\u201cWhat\u2019s the ranking on the waist token mean?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Liu Chengfeng clearly knew more of matters relating to the Martial School than both Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian and said, \u201cThe ranking displayed on the waist token is the ability ranking of all the external students of Western Campus. It mostly reflects the cultivation of the warrior, how many tasks assigned by the school that have been completed, the results of the seasonal exams, and the results of the annual Four Campus conference. That is how they measure the rankings.\u201dLiu Chengfeng added, \u201cWestern Campus rankings have little meaning. Those who can enter the Profound Board are the truly powerful ones.\u201dBeing able to enter the Profound Board was the mark of a strong warrior.\u201cYour Majesty, which key do you have?\u201d Liu Chengfeng asked.Zhang Ruochen looked at the bronze key in his hand and found that his was not quite the same as Liu Chengfeng\u2019s residence key.\u201cDragon Martial Temple, Yellow No.1,\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied.\u201cDragon Martial Temple\u2026\u201dLiu Chengfeng\u2019s expression changed greatly. He shivered slightly and said, \u201cI knew it, I knew it\u2026\u201dZhang Ruochen looked curiously at Liu Chengfeng and asked, \u201cIs there something wrong with Dragon Martial Temple?\u201dLiu Chengfeng shook his head vigorously and said, \u201cDragon Martial Temple is the place with the most Spiritual Qi on Western Campus. Only the first student of each year lives there. Also, practicing in Dragon Martial Temple has benefits beyond the better Spiritual Qi.\u201dZhang Ruochen felt a sense of false alarm and said, \u201cIf that is true, that would seem like a good thing.\u201dLiu Chengfeng continued to shake his head and said, \u201cThere is a rumor on the West Campus if a male enters Dragon Martial Temple, he becomes either disabled or useless. Rumor has it two years ago, the first of the freshmen was the son of the Square Commandery\u2019s Prime Minister, Yuchi Tiancong. Upon entering Dragon Martial Temple the first night, he had both his legs broken and was thrown out the front door. From then on, Yuchi Tiancong never dared to step into Dragon Martial Temple.\u201dIt seemed impossible. A prodigious new student having both his legs broken and thrown out of Dragon Martial Temple. That sounded horrible!Zhang Ruochen suddenly remembered the words of Huang Yanchen and Duanmu Xingling.Looking at the key in his hand, he felt a cold wind, chilling him from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.\u201cThey are so brutal and broke the legs of the new student prodigy. Didn\u2019t the presbyters punish them?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Liu Chengfeng held his hands up and said, \u201cWhat can they do? One of the devils accused Yuchi Tiancong of entering her room and trying and peek while she was bathing, so she got angry and broke his legs and threw him out of Dragon Martial Temple. The fault lies with Yuchi Tiancong; the school Elders can\u2019t do anything!\u201d\u201cIf he knew the three devils all live in Dragon Martial Temple, why would he dare peek at them bathing?\u201d Zi Qian asked.Liu Chengfeng laughed and said, \u201cEven if he had 10 times the courage, he still wouldn\u2019t dare. But one of the she-devils had accused him of the crime, what could he do?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen he just admitted to the crime?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Liu Chengfeng replied, \u201cHow could he dare not to? If he didn\u2019t admit to it, next time it wouldn\u2019t just be broken legs. He would no longer be breathing. Yuchi Tiancong was afraid of them, so he admitted to it, but it was not enough to admit the crime. He had to compensate the she-devil. The 3,000 merit points Yuchi Tiancong received for being the first of the new students was given to her. Whatever you do, don\u2019t fall into the hands of the devils!\u201dZhang Ruochen drew a cold, sharp breath. He felt that Dragon Martial Temple should be the most forbidden place on Western Campus. Calling it the dangerous place did not seem like such an understatement.\u201cYour Majesty, you have to be careful! Try to survive like Yuchi Tiancong. Even if they break both your legs, so what? If you receive medical care quickly, you\u2019ll still be able to walk again. Men can bend and flex, right?\u201dLiu Chengfeng patted Zhang Ruochen\u2019s shoulder sympathetically. He let out a sigh and began walking towards his own residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, she stood shoulder to shoulder with Zhang Ruochen holding her ancient sword in her arms, wearing the phoenix carved Spatial Ring.She gave Zhang Ruochen a stare and said, \u201cIf need be, you can stay at my place tonight.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied.Zi Qian\u2019s face turned red but her eyes turned cold and said, \u201cWhat are you thinking? I was only worried you would get both your legs broken and be thrown out of Dragon Martial Temple.\u201dZhang Ruochen laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine! Although Dragon Martial Temple is a dangerous place, your room may not be safe either. What if you chop off my head while I fall asleep, and sell it on the black market the next morning for 150,000 silver coins as reward? That would be unfair!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dZi Qian\u2019s gaze became even colder. She wished she could cut off Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head and kick it like a ball. She just wanted to save him but ended up being misunderstood.\u201cBut\u2026 why should I help him?\u201dShe was here to kill him. She was a killer, so why would she want to save the person she was sent to assassinate?Zi Qian went deep into a dilemma. Her fists unconsciously tightened and her heart pounded. She realized she was a little reluctant to kill Zhang Ruochen now. This was not a good feeling!As a person who makes a living killing people but is now unable to kill, she was in dire straits.Zhang Ruochen saw Zi Qian\u2019s face paled and thought his words had hurt her, so he laughed and said, \u201cI was just making a joke. Don\u2019t take it to heart. How about I stay at your place tonight and we can also split up the practice resources we got in Omen Ridge?\u201d\u201cNo! Why do you think you can just enter my dormitory like that?\u201dZi Qian\u2019s attitude took a u-turn and rejected Zhang Ruochen coldly. She turned and left, but added again, \u201cNext time you should watch out when you leave your room because I could assassinate you at any time!\u201dZhang Ruochen was briefly stunned. She stared at Zi Qian\u2019s retreating figure and said, \u201cIndeed it is hard to understand a woman. She changed her mind so quickly.\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head lightly and walked towards Dragon Martial Temple.Even though it was the dangerous place, Zhang Ruochen would still go try his luck. As a warrior, without this courage, he could only achieve little in the future.Dragon Martial Temple was at the center of Western Campus. There are large mountains to the east and west with steep cliffs. It was extremely dangerous.It had to be said that the martial Market Bank was indeed rich and powerful. It was only the student\u2019s dormitory that was like a palace, showing a feeling of grandeur.Seen from afar, the three main halls and eight side halls were arranged in a mysterious way like a tactical formation.By the time Zhang Ruochen made it to Dragon Martial Temple, night had fallen.Not far away, external students of the school could be seen. They were all looking in the direction of Dragon Martial Temple.\u201cHe\u2019s coming! He\u2019s coming! The first ranked new student is coming!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the one who passed the second obstacle on the third level? Zhang Ruochen? Does anyone want to make a bet on whether he will be beaten worse than Yuchi Tiancong?\u201d\u201cFor sure! Those female devils specifically beat up prodigies. The more talented you are, the harder they beat you. I think they won\u2019t be just breaking his legs, and they might even break his hands.\u201d\u201cWait and see! It won\u2019t take two hours and he\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u201dLiu Chengfeng, with the new students from Yunwu Commandery, also rushed to the outside of Dragon Martial Temple. They stared at Zhang Ruochen in pity.Liu Chengfeng said, \u201cWhen the Ninth Prince is thrown out, you go pick him up. I\u2019ll have medicine ready. I exchanged for some high-grade Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment.\u201dThe new students standing beside him nodded their heads, all watching Zhang Ruochen stand outside Dragon Martial Temple. They couldn\u2019t stop sighting and only hoped that Zhang Ruochen could keep his life.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s ears were very sensitive and could hear everything the crowd said. However, he still pushed open the front doors of Dragon Martial Temple and walked inside.\u201cIndeed the Spiritual Qi is very strong.\u201dWalking into Dragon Martial Temple, Zhang Ruochen could feel the surge of Spiritual Qi from all sides. It was at least twice as concentrated as it was outside.Practicing inside Dragon Martial Temple would definitely be faster than practicing outside.Below Zhang Ruochen\u2019s feet was an enormous White Stone Square about 200 meters long. In the distance, there was a grand main hall. On the roof of the hall, there was calligraphy writing with the words \u201cDragon Martial Temple\u201d.Behind Dragon Martial Temple, there were two other palaces named Observatory Palace and Divine Power Palace.Around the three main halls, there were eight side halls called Heaven No.1, Heaven No.2, Earth No.1, Earth No.2, Black No.1, Black No.2, Yellow No.1, and Yellow No.2 respectively.\u201cThe students who may enter Dragon Martial Temple are all carefully nurtured students of the school. Even their living area is not the usual.\u201dZhang Ruochen walked towards Yellow No.1 and fitted the bronze key into the lock. After opening the door, he walked straight in.Ever since he entered Dragon Martial Temple, Zhang Ruochen had been very alert. He had even sent out his Space Domain.Walking into Yellow No.1, Zhang Ruochen finally let out a breath. It seemed Dragon Martial Temple was not as terrifying as the rumors had it.Suddenly, Zhang Ruochen saw that the garden in front had a light on, and there was also sounds of water splashing.\u201cYellow No.1 is where I live. Did someone already claim this area?\u201dZhang Ruochen was not happy and decided to go out and have a look. Who was it that was so arrogant?Having just walked into the garden, he could smell a light floral scent floating through the gates. Walking a few more steps, Zhang Ruochen finally saw something that would cause countless men nosebleed.In the center of the garden was a bathing pond. Petals floated on the surface of the water and a pale skinned female sat in the bath. It was merely a view of her back, but it was so delightful as to steal away one\u2019s breath, and not a flaw could be found.Although much of her pale skin was concealed under the water, her figure was still tantalizingly visible, as was each droplet of water falling from her skin.Under the light, she was very beautiful.After seeing the woman, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s heart leaped and he realized something was amiss. \u201cSh*t! They actually used this trick, now what do I do? If I get caught, I\u2019ll definitely have both my legs broken and my eyes dug out.\u201dAlthough Zhang Ruochen was unusually talented and had a high cultivation, he was still at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. How could he hope to be a match for the female devil who had reached the Completion of the Black Realm?They were too cruel!Zhang Ruochen stared at the back of the female in the bath and felt it seemed somehow familiar. But, at the moment, he could not think too much. He sighed silently and said, \u201cThese female devils really committed themselves to defeating me. They even took off their clothes for me to see. The would do anything to get at me!\u201dFlee!He must immediately flee!Zhang Ruochen looked around and found no one rushing out to capture him. He took one slow step back and prepared to leave without a sound or trace.\u201cYou only just came?\u201d The female still has not turned around. Sitting in the bath, she seemed highly relaxed and was enjoying the bath.It could not be denied that her voice was very beautiful. It was like a nightingale, particularly melodic.Zhang Ruochen was startled slightly and immediately stopped his steps.\u201cSince she knows I\u2019m here, why is she so calm? But\u2026 her voice sounds so familiar.\u201dAbruptly, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s gaze became resolute. Since he was already being discovered, he would go head to head with her!Since she dared to lay a trap to frame him, he dared to fight with his life on the line.Zhang Ruochen began to circulate the Genuine Qi in his body and prepared to use the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm. He wanted to heavily wound her as fast as possible. Only through this way would he have a chance to escape.Of course, given Zhang Ruochen\u2019s current cultivation, it was highly difficult for him to harm the woman in the bath who was at the Completion of the Black Realm. It would only be possible if she had no defenses at all and allowed him to strike her.Even if there wasn\u2019t any hope of success, Zhang Ruochen still had to try.Zhang Ruochen would not resign himself to being like Yuchi Tiancong and have both his legs broken and thrown out of Dragon Martial Temple.\u201cBeep!\u201dZhang Ruochen stepped into his paces, exploding outwards at a speed of 38 meters per second. In a flash, he was next to the bath.The woman in the bath had no defenses. She turned her body and said, \u201cXingling, since you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you say something\u2026\u201dThe woman did not finish her sentence before seeing Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm appear before her face. The shadow of a young man grew larger and larger in her pupils.Her expression suddenly changed, and she was about to circulate the Genuine Qi in her body to defend herself.However, it was too late.\u201cElephant Galloping!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s palm hit her chest, and a great explosion of power sent her flying backward. She flew out 10 meters and fell on the steps beside the bath.The woman was wearing nothing and her slim figure was flawless. Only her chest had a blood red hand print.\u201cAww!\u201dThe woman spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed onto the ground, with her whole body shaking. Her chest felt like it was on fire and it was clear she had been heavily wounded.Even if she was a Warrior of Division Profound, to be struck by Zhang Ruochen like so without any warning would at least result in heavy wounds if not death.Luckily at the last moment, she circulated her Genuine Qi and protected her chest. Otherwise, she would already be dead.Zhang Ruochen looked at the collapsed woman and then looked at his palm. He never thought it would be so easy to heavily wound a Warrior of Division Profound.Of course, Zhang Ruochen did not have any pity. After all, it was the opposition who first sought to frame him, and he struck out only in self-defense.Zhang Ruochen walked towards the woman next to the bath. Seeing her naked, he felt a little sympathy for her. He removed his robe and laid it on her body to cover her figure.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Ruochen said sincerely, \u201cAlthough your methods are despicable, I will not take advantage of the situation. Ah! You are Huang Yanchen!\u201dZhang Ruochen finally saw clearly the face of the beautiful woman lying on the ground. It was Huang Yanchen whom he had seen once in the Wu Tower.Huang Yanchen heard Zhang Ruochen\u2019s words and was so angry that her whole body shook. Opening her pair of beautiful eyes, she ground her teeth, and then said with a quiver, \u201cB\u2026 bastard, you dare to enter my residence without permission\u2026 I want\u2026 I want to kill you\u2026 oww!\u201dHuang Yanchen spat out another mouthful of blood and fainted.Zhang Ruochen furrowed his brows. \u201cUnbelievable! Yellow No.1 is my residence. Clearly, it was her who entered without permission, and now she wants to frame me. Now she has even fainted? This woman, who does not know right and wrong, merciless in her tactics, is definitely not well-meaning. Luckily, I have injured her greatly, otherwise, I would certainly be sabotaged by her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn\u201cIt seems that she is seriously injured!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s finger lightly pressed on Huang Yanchen\u2019s wrist, and he sent a trickle of Genuine Qi into her Meridians. Her body\u2019s Genuine Qi made one large circle of vital energy.Using Genuine Qi to check for body injuries was common for warriors.\u201cShe is a warrior at the Completion of the Black Realm. Her Genuine Qi is very rich and strong. How could she be so heavily injured?\u201dAfter inspecting Huang Yanchen\u2019s injury, Zhang Ruochen realized he had struck too hard. He had broken three of the Meridians in Huang Yanchen\u2019s body.At that time, Zhang Ruochen did not expect that she would be completely defenseless, so he struck her with all his force.\u201cSince she tried to entrap me on purpose, why was she not prepared? Has there been a misunderstanding?\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s eyebrows drew tightly together. He looked at Huang Yanchen lying on the ground and shook his head lightly. He removed a bottle of Meridian healing Pills from the Time and Space Spinel and took out a Pill, feeding it gently into Huang Yanchen\u2019s mouth.It had to be said, Huang Yanchen was truly beautiful. In particular, her luscious red mouth was absolutely flawless. It seemed to be filled with endless allure, making others want to kiss it.Although Huang Yanchen, Duanmu Xingling, and Luo Shuihan were the three devils of Western Campus, they were also the three beauties. It was as if God had blessed them with all the advantages.Not only were they given talent in practicing martial arts, they were also given unparalleled beauty.Countless students in Western Campus had dreamed of kissing Huang Yanchen, but unfortunately, none had the nerve to do it.Right now, the opportunity was in front of him. Zhang Ruochen only needed to lower his head slightly, and he would be able to steal Huang Yanchen\u2019s first kiss.Zhang Ruochen was not one to take advantage of such a situation, and he quickly averted his gaze. He pressed one hand against Huang Yanchen\u2019s back and pushed his Pure Jade Genuine Qi into her body, helping her absorb the Pill.The next day, when Huang Yanchen woke up, she found herself lying on her familiar bed. Her whole body ached, and even moving one finger was difficult.What on earth happened last night?She thought hard about it.Slowly, Huang Yanchen began to remember the events of last night.Last night, while she was bathing, she was peeked at by the Ninth Prince of Yunwu Commandery, Zhang Ruochen. Being peeked at was already bad enough, but the pervert even attacked her and caused her to blackout\u2026 wait, that pervert couldn\u2019t have gotten ideas after seeing her and did something unspeakable to her while she passed out, could he?Otherwise, why would that pervert peek at her while she was in the bath and then attack her?It must be because he had ideas about her.Having reached this point in her thoughts, Huang Yanchen\u2019s face instantly paled.\u201cWhy am I on the bed? Whose clothes am I wearing?\u201dHuang Yanchen\u2019s mind became blank. Having suffered the worst blow in her life, she almost fainted again. If she wasn\u2019t already heavily injured, she would kill Zhang Ruochen.She raised her head in pain and saw that Zhang Ruochen was just sitting in the room. With his back towards her, he seemed to be counting something.The most unbearable thing for Huang Yanchen was that Zhang Ruochen was only wearing an inner robe, while his outer robe was on her.There was no need for guessing. He must have already done what he wanted to do.Huang Yanchen\u2019s last hope died, and a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye. She felt very regretful. If she knew what it was going to be like, she would have gotten rid of him the first time she met him.After Zhang Ruochen used his Genuine Qi to heal Huang Yanchen and saw that her condition was stable, he picked her up and moved her into the room. Placing her on the bed, he let her recover in peace.It must be noted, at the time, Huang Yachen was not wearing anything while taking a bath. Zhang Ruochen was not a lowly person, so once his emotions had stabilized, he took off his outer robe and laid it over her body.It was because of this that there was such a misunderstanding.At this moment, Zhang Ruochen was naturally taking stock of all the Spiritual Crystals, silver coins, Genuine Martial Arms, Pills, Spiritual Brawn, Exercise manuals, and martial technique instructions he had picked up from the warriors of Square Commandery.It was certainly a bountiful harvest!It must be noted, all 98 warriors who had died at Zhang Ruochen and Zi Qian\u2019s hands were each young prodigies. They were talented Martial Artists of the Black Realm and all had plenty of resources for practice.Of course, most of the people had been killed by Zi Qian.After taking stock, the bounty this time surprised Zhang Ruochen greatly.2,483 Spiritual Crystals.174 Genuine Martial Arms. Among them, 21 were second level Arms, 107 were third level Arms, 45 were fourth level Arms, and there was even one fifth level Genuine Martial Arms.There were 368 bottles of Pills, Triple-purity Genuine Qi Pills, Congealing Blood Pills, Saint Stone Pill\u2026 and all sorts of other Pills. Among them, they were mostly second-class Pills, although there were a dozen bottles of third-class Pills. Furthermore, the Blood Pills that the warriors carried haven\u2019t been included yet.There was a total of 48 pounds of Spiritual Brawn. All were stored in jade containers.Other than these, there were a dozen manuals for exercises and martial technique. As all of them were Human Stage ones, Zhang Ruochen did not consider them worthwhile at all.Compared to the other Practice resources, these warriors carried little in terms of silver coins. Altogether there were only 30,000 silver coins. It was not to say the warriors were poor, but that the warriors had exchanged the silver for Spiritual Crystals and Blood Pills, making it easier to carry around.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how many resources we collected. There\u2019s plenty to use for a long time. No wonder Zi Qian was adamant about hunting down warriors from Square Commandery in Omen Ridge. This is an amazing deal! If we missed this opportunity, it would be difficult to come across it again.\u201dThe 2,483 Spiritual Crystals were equivalent to 2,483,000 silver coins. That was roughly the fortune of a seventh-class family.The 174 Genuine Martial Arms could sell for at least 3,000,000 silver coins.Hundreds of bottles of Pills, huge quantities of Blood Pills, dozens of pounds of Spiritual Brawn, and dozens of books of exercises and martial techniques added together could sell for millions of silver coins.The bounty from the killing of the warriors of Square Commandery was incredible. The amount of wealth in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hands was comparable to that of a top seventh-class family.All of the Lin family\u2019s wealth might not compare to what he had.It must be noted, the wealth in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hands right now was the combined wealth of almost 100 warriors of the Black Realm. They were all prodigies of the Black Realm and would be wealthier than normal warriors of the Black Realm.\u201cZi Qian only cares about Spiritual Crystals and silver coins. It should be enough to give her 2,000 Spiritual crystals. I\u2019ll keep the remainder for myself. As for the 30,000 silver coins, she probably won\u2019t consider them worthwhile.\u201dZhang Ruochen placed the 2,000 Spiritual Crystals in a separate bag to give to Zi Qian tomorrow. After all, of the 98 warriors of the Black Realm, she killed 96 of them. Zhang Ruochen only kept a small number of Spiritual Crystals and silver coins.After tidying up, Zhang Ruochen picked up the only fifth-level Genuine Martial Arm, a half-moon shaped blade, and held it in his hands.This was Qing You\u2019s weapon, called \u201cDeath Sickle\u201d.Even without injecting his Genuine Qi to trigger the inscriptions, Zhang Ruochen could clearly feel the chill radiating from the Death Sickle.It lives up to being a fifth level Genuine Martial Arm. It\u2019s even sharper than the Flash Shinning Sword, and stronger too. It\u2019s worth more than 100,000 silver coins.The Flash Shinning Sword was only a fourth level Genuine Martial Arm, and could not compare to the Death Sickle.At this moment, Zhang Ruochen heard Huang Yanchen\u2019s voice behind him. \u201cBa\u2026 stard, what\u2026 what did you do to me?\u201dZhang Ruochen saw that Huang Yanchen was awake and felt his heart rise. He walked over, wanting to ask and clarify what happened last night.Maybe last night, it really was him being reckless.However, Zhang Ruochen forgot to put down the Death Sickle. Holding a sharp, cold, and flashing sword, he walked towards Huang Yanchen. On his face, there were traces of a smile.Zhang Ruochen had intended it to be a friendly smile, but Huang Yanchen did not see it that way.She thought Zhang Ruochen was going to kill her to prevent her from speaking out.Seeing the Death Sickle in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand as well as his sinister smile, Huang Yanchen paled in fear. She curled slightly, and pretended to be calm. \u201cWhat\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d she asked.Even though she was a warrior at the Completion of the Black Realm, she was also a young and beautiful woman. Right now, she was at her most vulnerable moment. How could she not be afraid?From her perspective, Zhang Ruochen was a cruel and heartless demon. Clearly, he was able to rape her and kill her.Zhang Ruochen stared at Huang Yanchen and revealed a kindly smile. He gently waved his hand and said, \u201cMiss Huang, don\u2019t be afraid! What happened last night was not entirely my fault, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201dWhen Zhang Ruochen waved his hand, the Death Sickle he was holding moved too.What was originally a friendly move immediately became threatening.Huang Yanchen gritted her teeth, staring at the Death Sickle in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand. She sighed in her heart. As the situation was difficult, she would calm him down first.Under Zhang Ruochen\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d, she was helpless. Huang Yanchen nodded her head in humiliation. She gritted her teeth and replied quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re right, it was all my fault.\u201dHow humiliating! How humiliating!Not only did this demon humiliate her, but he was also forcing her to say it was her fault!Huang Yanchen already hated Zhang Ruochen to the next level.\u201cI will keep him calm. Even if I had to take the blame, once my cultivation has recovered, I will have the opportunity to avenge him for this humiliation.\u201d Huang Yanchen thought in her heart.Zhang Ruochen nodded. He thought Huang Yanchen wasn\u2019t all bad. At least her attitude in admitting her mistake was sincere.He continued to smile and said, \u201cDo you know what you did wrong?\u201dHuang Yanchen thought he went too far and got even angrier.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, seeing the Death Sickle in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hand, she once again subdued herself and replied in a slightly trembling voice, \u201cI\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have been in the bath\u2026 I was wrong\u2026 it was me who seduced you. It had nothing to do with you.\u201dHuang Yanchen swore that once she recovered, she would certainly tear Zhang Ruochen apart.Zhang Ruochen nodded again. Thinking in his heart, it was just as he expected. She wanted to sabotage him. Luckily he struck first and injured her, otherwise, he would end up worse than Yuchi Tiancong. She would definitely have broken his legs beyond repair.Zhang Ruochen looked at Huang Yanchen thoughtfully. Then he sat on the side of the bed, and said, \u201cKnowing your mistakes is good. It wasn\u2019t anything big anyway, and I won\u2019t take it to heart. Ah! While you recover, I have some things to do, so I\u2019ll go out first. I\u2019ll come back later to see you.\u201dWatching Zhang Ruochen walk out, Huang Yanchen\u2019s face became even whiter. Was this demon going to come back tonight?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her beautiful eyes couldn\u2019t stop blinking. \u201cHow are you still alive?\u201d She exclaimed.Zhang Ruochen looked fairly confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Sister Chen kill you?\u201d asked Duanmu Xingling.The question frustrated Zhang Ruochen even more. \u201cWhy did she want to kill me? Wait\u2026 How did you know she wants to kill me?\u201dDuanmu Xingling acted as if she had done something wrong and tried to cover it up. She narrowed her eyes with a smile and said, \u201cNo\u2026 Nothing. I\u2019m just guessing.\u201dDuanmu Xingling was unhappy and untruthful. Were the bad things that I did last night have been discovered? Duanmu Xingling looked rather upset. She wondered if they had figured out what she did last night.Afterward, she took a closer look at Zhang Ruochen from head to toes. She asked again, \u201cIs sister Chen still in there?\u201dZhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cThere was some misunderstanding between us last night. She is badly injured now. You should go see her!\u201d\u201cHow could she be injured?\u201d Duanmu Xingling exclaimed.In her mind, Zhang Ruochen should be the one who got injured last night!Duanmu Xingling didn\u2019t bother to listen to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s explanation. She turned into a shadow and rushed to Yellow No.1 within a second.Zhang Ruochen shook his head slightly and walked out of Dragon Martial Temple.When his first stepped out of he palace, there was a massive noise.\u201cLook, look! Zhang Ruochen is walking out of the palace!\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 he is not injured or wounded!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t have his legs broken?\u201d\u201cThis is impossible! He must be suffering from an internal injury. Perhaps his cultivation has already been destroyed!\u201d\u201cI guess he\u2019s been castrated!\u201d\u2026In the past hundreds of years, none of the male students who entered Dragon Martial Temple would be able to come out without getting hurt.Therefore, the external students had been waiting outside Dragon Martial Temple since last night, to see how he made a fool of himself.Yet, when Zhang Ruochen came out intact and stood in front of everyone, no one could believe it.More than a dozen practitioners in the Yunwu County immediately greeted and Liu Fengfeng squeezed out from the crowd and asked, \u201cHis Highness the Prince Nine, you did not suffer from internal injuries?\u201d Tens of students from the Yunwu Commandery ran and welcomed Zhang Ruochen. Liu Chengfeng squeezed out from the crowd and asked, \u201cYour Majesty, you didn\u2019t suffer from any internal injury, did you?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Zhang Ruochen shook his head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Zhang Ruochen shook his head and responded.Liu Chengfeng continued, \u201cDid you encounter the three devils last night?\u201dZhang Ruochen answered, \u201cWell, I did come across one of them.\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d Liu Chengfeng asked sincerely.\u201cHuang Yanchen.\u201d Zhang Ruochen replied.Hearing this name, students who gathered together in the distance took a deep breath.Liu Chengfeng\u2019s countenance changed. He said, \u201cTwo years ago, Yuchi Tiancong, the number one freshman had both of his legs snapped and was thrown out of Dragon Martial Temple. How come she didn\u2019t do anything to you?\u201dZhang Ruochen stopped and thought about what happened last night. He thought he shouldn\u2019t tell others about it, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened in private!\u201dZhang Ruochen and Liu Chengfeng passed through the crowd and went to a quiet walkway.Out of curiosity, Liu Chengfeng asked again, \u201cHuang Yanchen is a well-known female devil of the Western Yard. No one comes to a good ending after offending her. Are you sure she didn\u2019t harm you?\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s countenance changed and said, \u201cI have to say, she set a trap and wanted to hurt me!\u201dLiu Chengfeng looked worried and asked, \u201cWhat kind of trap?\u201d\u201cSomething similar to what Yuchi Tiancong had suffered.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dZhang Ruochen responded. \u201cShe was bathing in the tub and I saw her!\u201dLiu Chengfeng widened his mouth. He was very shocked at what Zhang Ruochen had said, \u201chow much have you see?\u201d\u201cPretty much everything, I guess\u2026\u201d Zhang Ruochen gasped.Liu Chengfeng touched Zhang Ruochen\u2019s entire body to make sure he was saying the truth and that he was completely fine. He asked again, \u201cBear in mind that Yuchi Tiancong didn\u2019t see anything two years ago but he got his legs broken. Yet, you saw her naked\u2026 Do you think she\u2019ll just let you go like this?\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cIt\u2019s not really a big deal. She admitted that she made a mistake so I\u2019ve forgiven her.\u201d\u201cWhat? You forgave her?\u201d Liu Chengfeng was astonished.No words could explain how much Liu Chengfeng admire Zhang Ruochen for being able to force a devil to acknowledge her fault. Thus, he found Zhang Ruochen more mysterious than ever.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cYou\u2019d better not tell anyone what happened. Since she has admitted her fault, I can\u2019t ruin her reputation!\u201d\u201cRight! Reputation is the most important for women!\u201d Liu Chengfeng nodded and exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! Your secret is safe with me!\u201d\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll head off to Zi Qian.\u201dZhang Ruochen crossed his arms behind his back and walked towards Zi Qian\u2019s room.He didn\u2019t plan to stay long. He just wanted to return the 2,000 Spiritual Crystals to her before heading back to Dragon Martial Temple.He decided to seclude himself to practice for a while, and hoped to have a breakthrough to reach the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm as soon as possible.\u201cPhhf!\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s ears shivered slightly. He heard a sharp wind-breaking sound close to him. He quickly retreated two meters as he thought something dangerous was coming in.A jade-white long spear dashed above Zhang Ruochen\u2019s head and struck on where he was standing a second ago.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe force of the long spear was powerful. It shook and cracked the ground open.Zhang Ruochen gave a stern face and asked, \u201cWho is this?\u201dA group of students in white robe walked out from the woods. More than 20 of them surrounded Zhang Ruochen.There were both freshmen and older students.Every one of them was wearing a creepy smile and looked at Zhang Ruochen as if he was a dead man.Feng Zhilin appeared from among the 20-year-old students. He picked up the long spear that stuck to the ground, shook his arm and transferred his Genuine Qi to the spear.With fierce eyes, he sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re Zhang Ruochen?\u201dZhang Ruochen glanced at the students around him and his face didn\u2019t show the slightest bit of fear. He replied. \u201cYes, I am Zhang Ruochen!\u201d\u201cDo you have any idea who I am?\u201d Feng Zhilin asked.Zhang Ruochen surely knew who Feng Zhilin was as he saw him at Omen Ridge before. He responded. \u201cYou\u2019re Feng Zhilin, God\u2019s favored son of Square Commandery.\u201d\u201cHaha! Since you know my name, you should have known that Feng Zhiyi is my brother, the one you killed in Omen Ridge. I guess you don\u2019t have any problems if I kill you now, do you?\u201d said Feng Zhilin with anger.One of the students who stood beside Feng Zhilin sneered and said, \u201cAn eye for an eye. We have to take revenge for what happened, and even the presbyters of the school will not able to intervene!\u201dAnother student added, \u201cZhang Ruochen, this is your destiny. Fight with elder brother Feng if you dare!\u201dIn the distance, a student from the Yunwu Commandery passed by. Noticing that more than 20 students were surrounding Zhang Ruochen, he rushed towards the crowd and said in a deep voice, \u201cFeng Zhilin, don\u2019t go too far. My ninth brother has only cultivated to the Mid Stage while you\u2019re already in the Final State of the Black Realm. If he fights with you, death will be his only way out!\u201dZhang Ruochen was shocked. He couldn\u2019t believe that there was someone who spoke up for him at this moment.He turned around and looked at the person who just spoke. He was as chubby as a ball that weighed 300 pounds.\u201cHe just called me his ninth brother. Is he Zhang Shaochu , the fourth son of the Yunwu Commandery Prince?\u201d Zhang Ruochen wondered.Zhang Shaochu enrolled in the School of the Martial Market last year.Zhang Ruochen stared at the fat man in front of him. His figure didn\u2019t look like he was the Fourth Prince of the Yunwu Commandery.Most of the princes Zhang Ruochen met were handsome and graceful. None of them looked as fat as Zhang Shaochu.Yet, other princes didn\u2019t leave Zhang Ruochen a good impression, but the Fourth Prince did. After all, it took a lot of courage to speak up for him at such a dangerous moment.In fact, Zhang Shaochu used to be very close with the feeble Ninth Prince. Yesterday when he knew that Zhang Ruochen became the No.1 freshman of the year, he was so excited that he couldn\u2019t sleep the entire night.Early this morning, he planned to visit his outstanding brother.While he was on his way to meeting Zhang Ruochen, he realized that Feng Zhilin had led more than 20 students to surround Zhang Ruochen, and they kept yelling at him.Being his elder brother, Zhang Shaochu couldn\u2019t sit there and them bully his little brother. So he squeezed out from the crowd, wanting to protect Zhang Ruochen.Feng Zhilin glanced at Zhang Shaochu. He exposed a disdained look and giggled, \u201cPiggy Zhang, you do love being punched, don\u2019t you? Let me tell you, no one can save Zhang Ruochen today, he must die! I\u2019m not going to deal with you now, get out of my way!\u201dZhang Shaochu was so irritated that his face turned red. Normally, he didn\u2019t dare to provoke Feng Zhilin. When he saw that the one who was being bullied was his ninth brother Zhang Ruochen, he took courage and said loudly, \u201cI\u2019m Zhang Shaochu, not piggy Zhang!\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dThe 20 students all burst into laughter.Feng Zhilin also sneered and said, \u201cHow can you say you\u2019re not a pig? You are fatter than a pig!\u201d\u201cThe prince of the Yunwu Commandery is a pig! I guess his mother has slept with a pig and now we have a piggy Zhang here!\u201d A warrior from the Square Commandery laughed recklessly.They knew Zhang Shaochu too well. Although he was a prince, people always bullied him with offensive words and punched him. They even peed on his head, but sadly he didn\u2019t dare to fight back.The warrior of the Square Commandery widened his legs and chuckled. \u201cPiggy Zhang, come over here! If you crawl under my crotch in front of your brother, I\u2019ll let you go. Otherwise, you clearly know what is going to happen!\u201dZhang Shaochu had tolerated them for the entire year and he suffered enough. He yelled. \u201cNie Xuan, I\u2019ve had enough with all the humiliation! Bring it on!\u201dZhang Shaochu completely exploded. His chubby body became even bigger after activating Genuine Qi in his body. He stuck out a palm towards Nie Xuan.With a cultivation at the Dawn State of the Black Realm, Zhang Shaochu was surely not a weak warrior.Nie Xuan sneered. He stretched out his arm and caught Zhang Shaochu\u2019s arm with one hand, and struck him hard on his chest with the other hand.It was known that Nie Xuan had cultivated to the Medium State of the Black Realm, and Zhang Shaochu was not his opponent.\u201cPuff!\u201dZhang Shaochu spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying.Yet, Nie Xuan didn\u2019t want to let Zhang Shaochu go. He smirked and said, \u201cSince you want to stand out, I\u2019ll satisfy you. I\u2019ll let you know what your fate is going to be!\u201dNie Xuan quickly dashed forward. He threw Zhang Shaochu up to the sky, grabbed his arms and released three punches in a row.\u201cPuff!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPuff!\u201d\u201cPuff!\u201dZhang Shaochu spat blood after each punch and fell to the ground heavily.Nie Xuan stepped one foot on Zhang Shaochu\u2019s head and chuckled. \u201cSomebody come over and hit this fatty\u2019s legs until they\u2019re broken. Take off all his clothes and throw him into the savage beast septic tank. See if he still dares to stand out in the future!\u201dLooking at Zhang Shaochu whose face was covered with blood, Zhang Ruochen was filled with extreme anger. He grasped his fist firmly with red eyes and shouted. \u201cNie Xuan, I\u2019ll destroy you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He turned around and looked at Zhang Ruochen, yet kept his foot pressed on Zhang Shaochu\u2019s head. He chuckled and said, \u201cExcuse me, what did you just say? Destroy me? Haha! Everybody, he said he wanted to destroy me!\u201dThe surrounding students all laughed and thought the two princes from the Yunwu Commandery were absolute fools.Zhang Ruochen was indeed the number one freshman of this year but his cultivation was only at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm.A Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm claiming he will destroy one at the medium stage of the Black Realm. Is he not a fool?Nie Xuan lifted his arms towards Feng Zhilin and said, \u201cElder Brother Feng, please let me teach the Ninth Prince a lesson. What do you think?\u201dAs for a Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm, Feng Zhilin couldn\u2019t be bothered to fight himself. He stood there arrogantly with coldness in his eyes. He nodded and said, \u201cSince he wanted to destroy you, I think you should destroy him first!\u201dNie Xuan displayed a knowing smile. He kicked Zhang Shaochu aside and said, \u201cPig, get out of my way! I\u2019ll handle you myself after killing your brother!\u201dNie Xuan rolled his shoulders and all the joints of his body cracked.He walked steadily toward Zhang Ruochen, laughed and said, \u201cZhang Ruochen, you said you wanted to destroy me. Here I am, come on!\u201dThe students who surrounded Zhang Ruochen all stepped aside with excitement in their faces.Zhang Ruochen glanced at Zhang Shaochu who was crawling on the ground, and shook his head at him, signaling him not to fight.If Zhang Ruochen bore the humiliation now, he would still have a chance to stay alive. If not, he would die a horrible death today.Feng Zhilin didn\u2019t want the presbyter of the School to intervene, because he wanted to take his revenge on Zhang Ruochen for killing his brother.Zhang Ruochen shook his head at Zhang Shaochu, fiercely determined. He looked at Nie Xuan and said, \u201cNie Xuan, do you think I should amputate your hands or your legs first?\u201dNie Xuan sneered and said, \u201cBoy, you over-estimated yourself!\u201dHe stopped fooling around with Zhang Ruochen. He thrust against the ground and dashed towards Zhang Ruochen at a speed of 40 meters per second, as fast as a blast of wind.The greatest advantage of Mid Stage warriors of the Black Realm is their speed. Compared to warrior at the Medium State of the Black Realm, they are able to kill an opponent in one strike before he can even respond.Yet, Zhang Ruochen was no ordinary warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. In terms of speed, he was not much slower than a medium stage warrior of the Black Realm.As Nie Xuan charged toward Zhang Ruochen, Zhang Ruochen countered with an outstretched palm, jade-white Genuine Qi flowing between his fingers and exploding with powerful force.\u201cBoom!\u201dTheir hands slammed together. Nie Xuan\u2019s countenance fell. He could feel the shock of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm penetrating his arm, a pain as if it had split.Realizing his prospects, Nie Xuan stepped back immediately and kept his distance from Zhang Ruochen.Nie Xuan\u2019s arm was trembling inside his sleeve. He was lucky that he had retracted it in time. Otherwise, the Meridians in his arms would surely have been severed.\u201cWhat overpowering Genuine Qi, what level do you train at?\u201d Nie Xuan asked.It was obvious to Feng Zhilin and the other students that Nie Xuan was in an unfavorable situation fighting against Zhang Ruochen.Everyone clearly knew that even though Nie Xuan had just broken through the medium stage of the Black Realm, none of the warriors of the Mid Stage were strong enough to confront him.The students murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t believe the Ninth Prince of the Yunwu Commandery is so powerful!\u201dFeng Zhilin had noticed the jade-white splendor glittering in Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm. He cracked a smile, \u201cInteresting! Looks like the exercises he practices are extraordinary otherwise how could he defeat Nie Xuan!\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at Nie Xuan and said, \u201cYou should take my move too!\u201dAfterwards, Zhang Ruochen tightened his entire body like a fully-stretched bow. The Genuine Qi in his body was circulating rapidly. His legs thrust against the ground and he dashed towards Nie Xuan like a shot arrow.The power of his bones and muscles was fully activated and exploded through his palm with full force.\u201cGalloping Elephant!\u201dAs Nie Xuan had just been humiliated by Zhang Ruochen, he didn\u2019t dare to look down on him anymore.When the palm wind came through, Nie Xuan displayed the Vajra Bone Breaking Finger, a Human Stage Superior class martial technique.He transferred the entirety of his Genuine Qi to his extended middle finger, which revealed a faint golden splendor glittering upon it.\u201cVajra Bone Breaker!\u201dNie Xuan\u2019s arms seemedd to turn into phantoms. He pointed his finger and struck at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe finger and palm clashed together. Nie Xuan and Zhang Ruochen both felt uneasy and retreated a step back.Fortunately, Zhang Ruochen had cultivated a pure Genuine Qi and was therefore able to withstand Nie Xuan\u2019s technique. Otherwise, the finger Nie Xuan released would have pierced through his palm.As soon as Zhang Ruochen had stepped back, he attack again. He thrust against the ground, lept seven or eight meters into the air and unleashed a palm.\u201cDragon in the Sky!\u201dAlthough Nie Xuan\u2019s finger was still in pain, he had had no choice but to release another finger at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm.\u201cBoom!\u201dNie Xuan retreated three steps back from the power of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s movement was coordinated. He immediately hit the third palm .\u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth!\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dNie Xuan\u2019s finger was broken. He moaned and stepped back devastated.He stared at Zhang Ruochen from faraway with an intense shaking arm. The pain on his finger caused a sweat on his forehead. His middle finger had been broken.In fact, Zhang Ruochen was also in pain. There was a burning ache coming from his palm. Drops of blood seeped from his palm. He grasped his fist tightly as blood dripping to the ground.The fighting force of Nie Xuan was indeed more powerful than Qing You.Prince Huo Xing had been paying attention to the fight between Nie Xuan and Zhang Ruochen from far away. He looked coldly and said, \u201cZhang Ruochen has just reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, and he\u2019s already able to confront a warrior of the Medium State of the Black Realm. We can\u2019t let him live. He\u2019s definitely a threat to the Square Commandery.\u201dStanding next to Prince Huo Xing, Xie Zhaowu sneered and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry your Highness. Nie Xuan hasn\u2019t demonstrated the real strength of a warrior at the Medium State of the Black Realm yet. I\u2019m sure if he fully demonstrates his power, Zhang Ruochen will never be able to stop any of his moves.\u201dPrince Huo Xing nodded and said, \u201cA warrior at the Dawn State of the Black Realm can demonstrate the Animal Spirits Fixing Beasts, while a warrior of the Medium State of the Black Realm can perform the Animal Spirits Fixing Arms. Once Nie Xuan puts forth the power of these two Meridians, defeating Zhang Ruochen will be an easy task.\u201dXie Zhaowu chuckled and said, \u201cNie Xuan must have a backup plan and won\u2019t demonstrate these two powers easily. Anyway, he is fighting with a warrior of the Mid Stage of the Black Realm!\u201dIt was no doubt that this was all due to Prince Huo Xing\u2019s manipulations. Yet he\u2019s still a freshman, and Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t attack or provoke him, thus why would he use Feng Zhilin to handle Zhang Ruochen. He only needs to monitor behind the scenes.Nie Xuan tolerated the pain of his finger and said, \u201cGreat! The number one of the freshman is definitely beyond an ordinary warrior at the Mid Stage of the Black Realm. Since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll let you take a look at the Ghost Hand, a Low-Class Spiritual martial technique!\u201dNie Xuan was stepping on his legs as he flapped his arms until they formed into phantoms.Zhang Ruochen blinked. Even though he had transferred his Genuine Qi into the eye vessel, he could hardly identify Nie Xuan\u2019s technique.Zhang Ruochen had no choice but to release the Space Domain. He could take control of the area within 30 meters of the Space Domain.With the power of the Space Domain, Zhang Ruochen could finally recognize Nie Xuan\u2019s handprints and techniques.\u201cNie Xuan is a Medium State warrior of the Black Realm. I\u2019ll no doubt lose if I fight recklessly with my cultivation. I have to defeat him before he demonstrates the power of his Meridians, or even destroy him!\u201dAs a talented warrior, Zhang Ruochen clearly understood the difference in cultivation between Nie Xuan and himself. He only had one chance to strike. If he doesn\u2019t make use of it, his end will be worse than that of Zhang Shaochu, the Fourth Prince.Zhang Ruochen\u2019s sight focused on Nie Xuan, who was dashing towards him at a high speed. He grasped the Time and Space Spinel in his hand firmly and hid it in his sleeve.\u201cZhang Ruochen, it\u2019ll be a fairly outstanding loss under my Ghost Hand!\u201d Nie Xuan sneered with a creepy face. A dozen palm shadows hit Zhang Ruochen at the same time.Zhang Ruochen moved to his left slightly and took out a foot-long Death Sickle from the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel at his fastest speed.He swayed his arms, swung the Death Sickle in the air and cut off Nie Xuan\u2019s Ghost Hand.Blood squirted everywhere!A bloody hand fell to the ground.\u201cAhh\u2026 My hand\u2026\u201dNie Xuan screamed. He put pressure on his wrist where the blood was flooding out. He almost fainted away under such pain.Zhang Ruochen wouldn\u2019t let go of such a good opportunity to take Nie Xuan down. He kicked Nie Xuan in the chest and sent him flying tens of meters.When Nie Xuan was about to stand up, a heavy leg stepped on his chest. The bones made a cracking sound as if his chest would cave in.Zhang Ruochen put the Death Sickle on Nie Xuan\u2019s throat and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move! Otherwise, you\u2019re going to lose more than your hand!\u201dNie Xuan was furious. If Zhang Ruochen hadn\u2019t suddenly taken out the sickle from his sleeve, he would never be defeated by a Mid Stage warrior of the Black Realm.\u201cHow dare you to destroy my left hand! You\u2019re definitely going to die today!\u201d Nie Xuan exclaimed, clenching his teeth.Far away, Feng Zhilin and other students had finally realized what had just happened. They rushed towards Nie Xuan and surrounded Zhang Ruochen.\u201cSwish!\u201dEvery single one of them looked murderous. They all took out different levels of Genuine Martial Arms, as if they were going to tear Zhang Ruochen into countless pieces.\u201cBastard! Let Nie Xuan go!\u201d One of the students who was carrying a sword, pointed it at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest. If he took one step closer, he would drive the sword into Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest.Zhang Ruochen sneered. He put the Death Sickle on Nie Xuan\u2019s neck and exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll cut his head off if any of you move an inch!\u201d\u201cReally? You don\u2019t think I\u2019ll break this pig\u2019s skull first!\u201dFeng Zhilin grabbed Zhang Shaochu\u2019s neck hard and dragged him to Zhang Ruochen.Feng Zhilin activated his Genuine Qi with a cunning smile and put his palm on Zhang Shaochu\u2019s head. \u201cZhang Ruochen, put down your sickle and let Nie Xuan go right now! Otherwise, I\u2019ll make sure my palm is powerful enough to kill your brother!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Shaochu was extremely scared and his lips trembled as he said, \u201cNinth\u2026 My ninth brother\u2026 Don\u2019t do it! If you let Nie Xuan go, you\u2019ll be a dead man!\u201d\u201cSlap!\u201dFeng Zhilin put his fingers together into a palm sword and chopped Zhang Shaochu\u2019s arm, breaking his right shoulder.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dZhang Shaochu screamed. The pain distorted his face, his body was sweaty and his lips turned black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His five fingers combined together again and aimed at breaking Zhang Shaochu\u2019s the other hand.\u201cEnough!\u201d Zhang Ruochen exclaimed.Feng Zhilin stopped his strike at the Fourth Prince and sneered. \u201cMy Ninth Prince, have you finally made up your mind?\u201dZhang Ruochen looked irritated. He released the Death Sickle from Nie Xuan\u2019s throat and threw it on the ground, \u201cLet my fourth brother go!\u201dZhang Ruochen clearly knew that even though he had threatened Feng Zhilin with Nie Xuan\u2019s life, it wouldn\u2019t work as Feng Zhilin didn\u2019t care about whether Nie Xuan was dead.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dWhen Feng Zhilin noticed that Zhang Ruochen had let Nie Xuan go, there was a cunning smile on his face. His hand still struck Zhang Shaochu ruthlessly and broke his arm.Then Feng Zhilin threw Zhang Shaochu, who had fainted away because of the serious pain, aside. He stared at Zhang Ruochen and chuckled. \u201cYour Highness, bear in mind this is the School of the Martial Market, not Yunwu Commandery. Every word you say, you must mean. When it\u2019s time to back down, you have to back down. Come on guys, destroy his arms and legs, now!\u201dThe 20-odd students all attacked Zhang Ruochen at the same time as if they wanted to tear him into pieces.Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t bother to look at those who were rushing towards him. He stared coldly at Feng Zhilin and walked towards him little by little.One of the students, who was at the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm, rushed and attacked Zhang Ruochen. Zhang Ruochen caught the student\u2019s arm with one hand and smacked him with the other hand. The student\u2019s arm was broken by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm.\u201cBang bang!\u201dZhang Ruochen straightened out his palms and seized the three swords in front of him. The jade-white Genuine Qi exploded from his body, blasting the three students out, and he rolled the three swords into his sleeves.He swung his sleeves and released the three swords. They pierced through the legs of the three students and stabbed them to the ground.\u201cAhh\u2026 \u201dAll three of them screamed loudly.\u201cBang!\u201dA student at the Dawn State of the Black Realm slashed his sword across Zhang Ruochen\u2019s back and let out a sound of metal crashing together.Fortunately, Zhang Ruochen was wearing Ice-fire Kylin Armour that prevented the sharp sword from injuring him.The student who had just attacked him was fairly shocked. At the same time, he noticed that Zhang Ruochen had turned around and was staring at him fiercely.Yet, the student wasn\u2019t frightened by his cold stare. He looked disdainfully and swung another sword at Zhang Ruochen\u2019s arm.\u201cBang!\u201dZhang Ruochen unleashed a palm on the student\u2019s chest as well as grasped his wrist tightly in order to snatch the sword away from his hand.Then, he took the sword and snapped hard on the student\u2019s left face. Bang! The student passed out right away.In terms of the mastery of martial technique, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s application was indeed sophisticated. Yet, he was facing more than 20 students and most of them were experienced warriors. There were quite a number of bloody wounds on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body after a series of fights.A large number of students had been attrracted by the excitement of the fight.All of their attention focused on Zhang Ruochen, who had been surrounded by the 20 students. They all showed a sense of sympathy. It was obvious that the genius, the number one freshman\u2019s life was hopeless.Fighting was not forbidden in the School of the Martial Market. They even encouraged fights between students under one circumstance: the outcome of death was never allowed during the fights.If any student killed on purpose, the School of the Martial Market would no doubt put him to death. No matter how talented the students were, they would be put to death if they murdering other students.This was the reason why Prince Huo Xing refused to show up himself, but instead, he made use of the help of Feng Zhilin to get rid of Zhang Ruochen.Other than that, there was another rule of the School of the Martial Market. If two students appeared to hate each other, revenge was allowed in the School. For example, if one killed the other\u2019s loved one.Therefore, it was legitimate for Feng Zhilin to take revenge on Zhang Ruochen as he had killed Feng Zhilin\u2019s brother.It was suggested that the presbyters of the School should stay away from the fights.Revenge and resentment should be dealt with by students themselves.When everyone thought Zhang Ruochen would die, a tiny woman squeezed out from the crowd.Her soft hands lifted her snow-white chin slightly and stared at those 20 students surrounding Zhang Ruochen. She chuckled. \u201cInteresting! Very interesting!\u201dSeeing the tiny shadow walking out from the crowd, the students were all frightened and saluted right away. \u201cGreetings, senior sister apprentice Duanmu!\u201dDuanmu Xingling didn\u2019t pay attention to any of the saluting students. Rather, she put a smile on her face and walked towards Zhang Ruochen and the 20 students who had just fought with him.The students all stopped when they saw Duanmu Xingling heading over. Even the arrogant Feng Zhilin had shown fear on his face. He quickly greeted Duanmu Xingling with courtesy and asked, \u201cMy senior sister apprentice Duanmu, I wonder what makes you honor us with a visit?\u201dDuanmu Xingling extended a thin finger and pointed at Zhang Ruochen. \u201cI\u2019m looking for him!\u201dZhang Ruochen was still surrounded by tens of students at this moment. There were numerous cuts and wounds on his body and his white robe was almost covered in blood.Yet, 11 students were lying on the ground with severe injuries. Some had their arms broken, some had fainted from Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palm, and some had their legs pierced by swords. The situation was horrible!Feng Zhilin\u2019s countenance changed after hearing what Duanmu Xingling had said. He saluted again and said, \u201cMy senior sister, Zhang Ruochen killed my only brother! I have to seek revenge for him! Where is the justice if we spare him? If we don\u2019t kill him, I\u2019m sure the soul of my brother will not rest in peace. If we don\u2019t kill him, I, Feng Zhilin, cannot be classified as a warrior with the Spiritual Blood!\u201dFeng Zhilin put up an irritated attitude so as to arouse people\u2019s sympathy for him and anger for Zhang Ruochen. Yet, what he had said wasn\u2019t true.In fact, although Feng Zhilin and Feng Zhiyi were brothers, their relationship was never harmonious. They had already fallen out with each other when they were scrambling for the inheritance of the Feng\u2019s long ago. They were so eager to put each other to death.When Prince Huo Xing found Feng Zhilin, he promised him that once he killed Zhang Ruochen, he would definitely help Feng Zhilin become the leader of the Feng family.Therefore, revenge for his brother was just an excuse for Zhang Ruochen.Feng Zhilin added, \u201cMoreover, I\u2019ve already informed Elder Situ that I want to seek revenge for my brother. Since Zhang Ruochen slaughtered almost 100 candidates in the first-round examination, Elder Situ has also been critical that with such poor conduct, he is not suitable to become a student of the School of the Martial Market despite the fact that he is a talented warrior. Most importantly, Elder Situ will allow me to take revenge on Zhang Ruochen!\u201dDuanmu Xingling nodded and responded. \u201cOh, I get it. Are you threatening me with the name of Elder Situ?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dare! Even if you give me power, I would not dare offend you!\u201d Feng Zhilin said with fear.Duanmu Xingling straightened out one of her soft hands and tapped Feng Zhilin on his shoulder. He was so scared that he bent his legs and almost kneeled down on the ground.\u201cWhy are you so scared?\u201d Duanmu Xingling asked with curiosity.Feng Zhilin\u2019s forehead was covered in a cold sweat. He said, \u201cI dare not be unafraid in front of senior sister.\u201dDuanmu Xingling nodded with satisfaction and said, \u201cI understand your feeling, Zhilin. Anyhow, your brother was killed by someone. If I were you, I would seek revenge for sure. To be honest, I don\u2019t want to make you feel bad, but Sister Chen has sent me here for Zhang Ruochen. She said no one can touch Zhang Ruochen. The kill is hers.\u201dFeng Zhilin looked shocked. He couldn\u2019t believe that Zhang Ruochen was connected to the female devil Huang Yanchen.This was absurd! If Feng Zhilin had killed Zhang Ruochen today, he would have offended both Duanmu Xingling and Huang Yanchen.By offending two female devils, Feng Zhilin would have no way to live in Western Campus.Duanmu Xingling walked towards Zhang Ruochen and giggled. \u201cWell, you are the one who killed his brother as well as bringing trouble here. Why don\u2019t you think of a way to settle it?\u201dHearing what Duanmu Xingling said, other students then understood what was going on instantly. Duanmu Xingling was completely on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s side,so she let him decide what to do.With the appearance of Duanmu Xingling, even if Feng Zhilin invited 100 more students to come over, no one would dare kill Zhang Ruochen.No matter how many Black Realm warriors there were, they would be easily defeated by the warrior of Division Profound.Feng Zhilin had no choice but to give in before such massive power.Zhang Ruochen stared at Feng Zhilin and said, \u201cFeng Zhilin, I admitted that I killed your brother. If you want revenge, I\u2019ll offer you a chance. One month from now, I\u2019ll fight you on the life and death platform!\u201dFeng Zhilin\u2019s eyes showed a smile and said, \u201cSenior sister, this is what Zhang Ruochen said. I didn\u2019t force him.\u201dThe crowd was absolutely shocked by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s decision.The life and death platform of the School of the Martial Market was similar to the Coliseum of the Martial Market. Warriors had to sign the life and death contract to make sure no other people were involved if either party died.\u201cSince Zhang Ruochen is under the protection of senior sister apprentice Duanmu, Feng Zhilin doesn\u2019t dare get close to him. Why does Zhang Ruochen still want to fight?\u201d One of the students was confused.Another warrior laughed. \u201cYou kids know nothing. A grown-up man never wants a woman\u2019s protection. This is indeed a smart move by Zhang Ruochen. If he doesn\u2019t fight with Feng Zhilin, everyone in the School of the Martial Market will look down on him. Not to mention, Zhang Ruochen is an outstanding genius who is proud of himself and is confident in defeating Feng Zhilin.\u201d\u201cI get it now! Yet, if a Mid Stage warrior wants to fight against a Final State warrior of the Black Realm on the life and death platform, he actually will court death, right? Moreover, senior sister apprentice Duanmu can do nothing to help when Zhang Ruochen fights on the platform. Feng Zhilin will surely kill him!\u201d\u201cZhang Ruochen, I\u2019ll see you on the life and death platform in one month! Don\u2019t get frightened and not show!\u201d Feng Zhilin said confidently.Zhang Ruochen responded. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry! You avenge your brother\u2019s death and I avenge my fourth brother. I\u2019ll have your arms broken in no time!\u201d\u201cHaha! Looking forward to it! Let\u2019s go!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFeng Zhilin swung his arms and led the injured students back to the School.The life and death platform was not a place for fun. Defeating Feng Zhilin with just one month\u2019s preparation was an impossible task!Zhang Ruochen\u2019s decision was out of Duanmu Xingling\u2019s expectation. She asked, \u201cAre you sure you want to do this? Going onto the life and death platform is a serious matter! It may cost you your life!\u201dZhang Ruochen responded with a faint smile, \u201cSenior sister, thank you for stepping up just now. However, the hatred between Feng Zhilin and myself need to be handled. Perhaps the life and death platform is quite a good place for both of us!\u201dDuanmu Xingling\u2019s impression of Zhang Ruochen improved instantly. All of a sudden, she felt pleased with the number one freshman as if the misunderstanding between them had dissolved to a certain extent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her breasts were high and round. She stared at Zhang Shaochu with a look of disdain and furrowed brows. \u201cIs he really your brother, Zhang Ruochen? I don\u2019t see a prince in him.\u201dZhang Ruochen had met the Eighth Prince, the Sixth Prince, the Fifth Prince and the Third Prince, but he never felt any kinship with them.Although Zhang Shaochu was not as handsome as the other princes, he had stepped forward to help when Zhang Ruochen was in the greatest danger and at the time of his most need. That action alone was worth Zhang Ruochen\u2019s respect.Duanmu Xingling continued, \u201cZhang Ruochen, you won\u2019t carry that fat guy to Dragon Martial Temple, will you?\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cHe is seriously injured. Can\u2019t I take him back to recuperate?\u201dDuanmu Xingling blocked Zhang Ruochen at once, with arms akimbo, saying, \u201cNo. No man is allowed in Dragon Martial Temple.\u201dZhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWho says that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Western Campus\u2019s rule!\u201d Duanmu Xingling twisted her face, seeming arrogant.Zhang Ruochen ignored her entirely and walked past her to enter the door of Dragon Martial Temple. \u201cI can enter Dragon Martial Temple. So can my fourth brother.\u201dDuanmu Xingling followed up and said, \u201cYour talent was the only reason that we didn\u2019t go tough on you. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have left Dragon Martial Temple in one piece last night.\u201dZhang Ruochen acted like he didn\u2019t hear Duanmu Xingling at all, and walked directly to Yellow No.1.Suddenly, Zhang Ruochen stopped. He let out a light sound in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s odd! It should be Yellow No.1, but now it\u2019s Earth No.1. How could it be?\u201dThe horizontal inscribed board of the side hall clearly read \u201cEarth No.1\u201d.Zhang Ruochen had a good memory so that he knew that he didn\u2019t take the wrong way. Then, there was only one explanation\u2014someone had changed the horizontal inscribed board of the side hall.Who was so bored that they would change Yellow No.1 to Earth No.1?Zhang Ruochen took out the bronze key and inserted it into the keyhole, only to find out that it didn\u2019t open. Apparently, someone had also changed the lock.Duanmu Xingling seemed uneasy. She blinked and said in a low voice, \u201cYou took the wrong way, Zhang Ruochen. This is Earth No.1 where Sister Chen lives. Yellow No.1 is across from it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. I visited here last night. I wouldn\u2019t have made that mistake,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said firmly.Duanmu Xingling said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. It was too dark last night. Maybe you remembered the wrong way.\u201d\u201cThere is no possibility.\u201dZhang Ruochen drew back the bronze key and turned around, staring at Duanmu Xingling. \u201cIf it\u2019s Earth No.1, then, there\u2019s only one possibility\u2014someone switched the horizontal inscribed boards and the keys of Earth No.1 and Yellow No.1 to lure me into Earth No.1. Am I right?\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at Duanmu Xingling firmly.Duanmu Xingling had a guilty conscience so that she looked at the ground and asked, \u201cWho is that bored?\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201cNo one inside Western Campus dares to break into Dragon Martial Temple, and outsiders never dare to come in. There are only three devils that live in Dragon Martial Temple, Luo Shuihan, Huang Yanchen, and Duanmu Xingling. Surely, Huang Yanchen wouldn\u2019t have done such a thing. Then, only you and Luo Shuihan are left. We could easily find out the truth by asking Luo Shuihan.\u201d\u201cNo need to do that. It\u2019s me!\u201dDuanmu Xingling finally admitted it. She forced a smile. \u201cTruth be told, I just wanted to make a joke with you. I didn\u2019t expect it to go wild last night.\u201dZhang Ruochen sighed. \u201cI thought you were acting strangely when I met you this morning. It really is you. Why did you do such thing? Do you know you nearly got me and Huang Yanchen killed last night?\u201dThe truth was out there!Duanmu Xingling felt a little guilty. She put on a pitiable look and said, \u201cI\u2019ve told you that I just wanted to make a joke. Who could foresee that you would peep at Sister Chen bathing? What\u2019s more\u2026 you took a huge advantage. By the way, what happened between you two last night? She was crying when I visited her. I never saw her cry before.\u201dZhang Ruochen felt a little guilty. After all, he misunderstood Huang Yanchen and injured her badly last night.To be honest, Huang Yanchen was the one most wronged.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cA Warrior of Division Profound is still known as the devil. She would cry?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Duanmu Xingling nodded. \u201cShe was! She was crying very badly. Did you do some unspeakable things after you injured her?\u201d\u201cDid she say so?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.\u201cOf course not!\u201dDuanmu Xingling continued, \u201cI asked her, but she didn\u2019t tell me. That\u2019s why I am asking you!\u201dAfter all, Zhang Ruochen had seen Huang Yanchen naked, and injured her seriously last night. He thought for a while and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d\u201cDid you really do unspeakable things to her?\u201d Duanmu Xingling gaped, looking surprised.\u201cMaybe.\u201d Zhang Ruochen nodded slightly.In fact, Zhang Ruochen was an innocent boy, so he didn\u2019t really understand the true meaning of \u201cunspeakable things\u201d.In his last lifetime, he had always focused on Martial Arts and seldom had time to develop romantic relationships. Even when he was with Princess Chi Yao, they had only held hands.Due to that, he knew even less about romantic relationships than Duanmu Xingling.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cI should explain it to her face to face.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dDuanmu Xingling blocked Zhang Ruochen again and said, \u201cIf Sister Chen knows that she fell into that situation because of me, she would definitely hate my guts!\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at Duanmu Xingling, saying, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that I will take the blame for you?\u201dDuanmu Xingling thought for a while and then said, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, there is no use in explaining it to her. She will kill you the moment she sets eyes on you. With just a move of her finger, you will be a dead man before you can explain. How about a deal? You hide the truth about last night from her for me, and in return, I will persuade her to spare your life. What do you say?\u201d\u201cDoes she have to kill me?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Duanmu Xingling nodded, saying, \u201cYou should blame yourself. If you did such a thing to me, I\u2019d definitely tear you to shreds, too. But if I put in a good word for you, maybe she will let it go.\u201d\u201cWill she let it go so easily?\u201d Zhang Ruochen asked.Duanmu Xingling laughed. \u201cAlthough the students call her \u2018the devil\u2019 and \u2018Iceberg Beauty\u2019, I know that she\u2019s always fond of the top geniuses, and she made an oath to marry the greatest man in the world.\u201cFor example, she thinks highly of Zhang Tiangui, the top genius of the 36 commanderies of Omen Ridge, and mentions him frequently. Although you are not as talented as Zhang Tiangui, you will have great achievements in the future if you work hard.\u201cMaybe Sister Chen will have an interest in you, then you can stay alive and marry a beauty at the same time. What a lucky guy! After all, you have done that thing already.\u201d\u201cThe Seventh Prince, Zhang Tiangui!\u201d Zhang Ruochen said.Duanmu Xingling\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cRight! How could I forget that the Seventh Prince of Yunwu Commandery is your seventh brother?\u201d\u201cIs he the top genius of the 36 commanderies of Omen Ridge?\u201d asked Zhang Ruochen.Duanmu Xingling said with rare admiration, \u201cZhang Tiangui is much more powerful than you! He achieved the third rank of the Profound Board when he was 16 years old, and has become an example to all the youth of this generation.\u201cHe broke through to the Earth Realm and became the internal disciple of Yuntai Suzerain with the best score when he was 17 years old.\u201cNow, he is 20 years old and no one knows how high his cultivation will go. There has not been such a talented prodigy like him in a century. Zhang Ruochen, you didn\u2019t achieve the Mid Stage of the Black Realm until you were 16 years old. You are far away from your seventh brother.\u201dZhang Ruochen said mildly, \u201cI will surpass him someday.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit! If you have the desire to advance, you will definitely become a warrior of Division Profound after 3 to 5 years of practice with your talent. Sister Chen will have a completely new appraisal of you when you become a warrior of Division Profound.\u201d Duanmu Xingling smiled with her mouth closed. \u201cThen, we have a deal!\u201dZhang Ruochen thought for a while and said, \u201cOK. That\u2019s settled for now. I\u2019m going to take my fourth brother to Yellow No.1 to heal his wounds. Are you OK with that now?\u201d\u201cOK, of course.\u201d Duanmu Xingling smiled.Zhang Ruochen carried Zhang Shaochu to Yellow No.1 on his back and put him on the bed. Then he applied the Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment to his arms.A warrior\u2019s physical quality was much better than that of ordinary people. Although Zhang Shaochu\u2019s arm bones were broken, with the help of the Muscles and Bones Regenerating ointment, his bones would fully recover in half a month.\u201cZhang Tiangui!\u201dZhang Ruochen said the three characters, and then shook his head.The most important thing for him now was preparing for the fight in one month against Feng Zhilin at the Life and Death Platform.Feng Zhilin\u2019s cultivation was at the Final State of the Black Realm. Only if Zhang Ruochen upgraded his cultivation to the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm would he have the chance to beat Feng Zhilin.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMaybe other warriors couldn\u2019t break through to the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm in just one month, but Zhang Ruochen definitely could do it, because he had the Time and Space Spinel.If one practiced inside the Time and Space Spinel for three months, only one month\u2019s time would pass. That meant Zhang Ruochen had three months to practice.\u201cWith my massive amount of practicing resources, it won\u2019t be difficult for me to achieve the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm in three months.\u201d\u201cMy biggest weakness now is my martial technique. If I can successfully practice the fourth movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm or the whole set of the Sacred Sword Skill, it will be a piece of cake to beat Feng Zhilin.\u201dWith that thought, Zhang Ruochen entered the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel to begin his practice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: Dragon Shape and Elephant Shadow Translator: Transn Editor: TransnZhang Ruochen sat in cross-legged in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel. He took out half a kilo of Spiritual Brawn from a jade vessel and started to take it.The Spiritual Brawn, which condensed the Spiritual Qi of savage beasts and the essence of Spiritual Blood, had countless benefits for warriors, such as to gain force, to strengthen flesh and blood, and to prolong life.Generally speaking, for a warrior who had just reached the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, eating about five kilograms of Spiritual Brawn and practicing diligently would allow him to break through the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm in half a month.As the Body of Martial Arts of Zhang Ruochen was much stronger than many other Mid Stage warriors, if he wanted to break through to the Advanced Stage, he had to eat at least 20 kilograms of Spiritual Brawn.\u201c24 kilograms of Spiritual Brawn is enough to help me practice the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm in a short time.\u201dAll 24 kilograms of Spiritual Brawn were looted from the bodies of Square Commandery warriors who died in the first exam of the Martial School.So much Spiritual Brawn was worth at least 200,000 silver coins, which was definitely a huge wealth.The Spiritual Brawn was very precious, so normal warriors did not dare to eat it. However, Zhang Ruochen did not care and quickly ate half a kilo of it.After consuming the Spiritual Brawn, Zhang Ruochen felt full of strength while both his blood flow and the circulating speed of his Genuine Qi had accelerated a lot.Zhang Ruochen stood up and began to practice the fourth palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm. At the same time, he accelerated the absorption of the Spiritual Brawn into his body and turned it into his own power.The fourth palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was called \u201cDragon Shape and Elephant Shadow\u201d.With one foot in front and slightly bending of his body, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s two hands were like dragon claws or elephant palms.\u201cBang, bang!\u201dHe struck out repeatedly and palm prints all around.He had at present only practiced three palms successfully, Savage Beast Galloping, Dragon in the Sky, Dragon and Elephant Returning to Earth, which was only equivalent to the martial technique power of the Human Stage Superior class. Of course, it definitely belonged to the top martial technique in the Superior class of the Human Stage and could even contend with some martial techniques like the low-class Spiritual.However, once he had practiced the fourth palm successfully, the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm could transform into a genuine low-class Spiritual martial technique. At that time, the power of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm would be comparable with some weaker martial techniques of the mid-class Spiritual Stage.Time flew by very fast. Zhang Ruochen had practiced in the Time and Space Spinel for half a month.He spent most of his time every day practicing the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm. And after half a month of hard work, he could apply the fourth palm, Dragon Shape and Elephant Shadow, smoothly.One palm struck out and a stream of Genuine Qi surged forward.In his palms, you could hear dragon\u2019s roaring and elephant\u2019s howling.However, there was still a huge gap before he succeeded fully in the fourth palm, Dragon Shape and Elephant Shadow.If Zhang Ruochen succeeded, his body would turn into two shadows, exploding out with double the power when he wielded the palm. One shadow would be a dragon claw and another one would be an elephant palm.Although he hadn\u2019t practiced the fourth palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm successfully, his power had enhanced a great deal.During this half a month, Zhang Ruochen took half a kilo of Spiritual Brawn per day, a total of seven and a half kilos, and his Martial Arts realm had raised rapidly.Half a month ago, Zhang Ruochen had just entered the Mid Stage of the Black Realm, and his Genuine Qi only accounted for 20 percent of his whole Qi Lake. Until now, his clear jade Genuine Qi became more vigorous, accounting for 70 percent of his Qi Lake, not far from the Completion of the Black Realm Mid Stage.He was able to easily defeat Nie Xuan with his current cultivation.Only five days had passed in the external world of course, while half a month had passed in the Time and Space Spinel.Walking out of the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel, Zhang Ruochen went back to his room of Yellow No.1 again.\u201cMeow!\u201dSitting on a copper chair, Blackie, like a black fuzzy ball, was reading a yellow book with his two paws.On the book cover read five words: Ancient History of Kunlun\u2019s Field.Having seen Zhang Ruochen walk out of the Time and Space Spinel, Blackie closed his book and stared at Zhang Ruochen with his two big bright eyes. \u201cYoung man, have you reached the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm?\u201d\u201cnot so fast, it still takes some time!\u201d Zhang Ruochen kept a close watch on Blackie and asked curiously, \u201cWhere did you steal this book?\u201d\u201cSteal?\u201dBlackie said unhappily, \u201cI went to the Scripture Tower in the School of Martial Market and took a book out with me. After I finish it, I will give it back. I didn\u2019t steal anything.\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t intend to quarrel with him. \u201cHow about the condition of my fourth brother\u2019s injury?\u201d\u201cThat fat guy\u2019s cultivation is common, but his wounds recover very fast, and one arm can be lifted up. I think it will take at most another 10 days to heal,\u201d said Blackie.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\u201cHe has gone!\u201d answered Blackie.Zhang Ruochen asked, \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cAfter hearing that he was at Dragon Martial Temple , he ran away quickly,\u201d answered Blackie.For many male warriors who lived in Western Campus, Dragon Martial Temple was a forbidden area which had lots of scary legends. When Zhang Shaochu heard that he was in here, his face turned green and he ran away as soon as possible.Zhang Ruochen dared to stay in Dragon Martial Temple, but Zhang Shaochu didn\u2019t.\u201cLet him go then!\u201dZhang Ruochen decided to seclude himself for refining and to break through to the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm as soon as possible.In the days after, he practiced in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel for another half month and took half a kilo of Spiritual Brawn per day as usual. He spent most of the time practicing the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm and less time on the Sacred Sword Skill.Finally, after his Genuine Qi filled the Qi Lake, Zhang Ruochen could begin to break through to the Advanced Stage of the Black Realm.However, Zhang Ruochen was not in a rush. He decided to continue consuming Spiritual Brawn, and build up his strength so that he could break through to the realm in one go.Zhang Ruochen had practiced in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel for one month, which was equal to 10 days outside.The duel between Zhang Ruochen and Feng Zhilin was 20 days away.\u201cI can\u2019t break through the fourth palm of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm yet because I still have some deficiencies, which would be found out by fighting with the master.\u201dZhang Ruochen stopped secluding himself for refining and planned to fight with Blackie and to find out his own deficiencies.When Zhang Ruochen walked out of the Time and Space Spinel, he heard the cold voice of Huang Yanchen from outside the door. \u201cFat cat, move away! If not, I shall kill you too.\u201dStanding outside the door, Blackie erected his tail high and said to her without any vigor, \u201cZhang Ruochen is secluding himself for refining. Even if you break in there, you still can\u2019t see him. Little girl, follow my advice, and go away quickly! If you infuriate me, then no one on earth can save you.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then I\u2019ll attack you and see!\u201dAfter Huang Yanchen\u2019s injuries healed, she intended to get even with Zhang Ruochen at once and went to Zhang Ruochen\u2019s room indignantly. But she never expected she would be headed off by a talking cat.She was in a rage, feeling both Zhang Ruochen and this stupid cat were assholes. She drew out a royal-blue, archaic sword and stabbed at Blackie.\u201cSwish!\u201dIn no time, Blackie magically changed into a black shadow shunning Huang Yanchen\u2019s sword and threw himself back at her.A surprised look emerged on Huang Yanchen\u2019s face since she didn\u2019t expect this fat cat to escape her sword and move at a speed which equaled a medium-class level-two savage beast.But for her, the speed of Blackie was still too slow.She sneered and shot a palm, hitting Blackie more than 10 feet away. Blackie\u2019s body slammed into the wall and fell flat on the ground, which made him feel dizzy.\u201cBitch! You are too cruel!\u201dClimbing up from the ground, Blackie showed his sharp teeth with great wrath. Even if he couldn\u2019t defeat Huang Yanchen, he would teach her a lesson.This stupid fat cat was so mean to Huang Yanchen that she intended to cut its tongue as soon as she caught it.Zhang Ruochen pushed the door open and came out. He smiled at Huang Yanchen. \u201cSenior sister, your injuries have recovered?\u201dSeeing Zhang Ruochen, Huang Yanchen\u2019s eyes became even colder. Huang Yanchen didn\u2019t want to say a single word to Zhang Ruochen and directly stabbed her sword at him.It happened that Huang Yanchen was a Warrior of Division Profound. They could compete with the top masters of the Earth Realm.Huang Yanchen\u2019s sword techniques could instantly kill average warriors of the Completion of the Black Realm.Looking at the swiftly moving sword, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s face changed and he thought. \u201cDuanmu Xingling was right. Huang Yanchen hates me so much that she won\u2019t listen to any words from me.\u201dZhang Ruochen looked at Duanmu Xingling who was not far away, and she nodded to him, understanding his meaning.\u201cSwish!\u201dTransforming into a petite gorgeous shadow, Duanmu Xingling dashed in front of Zhang Ruochen and stopped Huang Yanchen.With two jade-white slender fingers, Duanmu Xingling clamped Huang Yanchen\u2019s sword tip between them. \u201cCalm down, Sister Chen. Zhang Ruochen is the new first ranked student. If you kill him, you will get a serious punishment from the school.\u201dHuang Yanchen shouted. \u201cStep aside, Xingling! I have to kill this pervert today!\u201dHuang Yanchen\u2019s five fingers twisted and she turned the blade around. It emitted some Sword Breath that shook Duanmu Xingling\u2019s fingers off.Immediately, Huang Yanchen struck again and created a white, four-meter-long Sword Breath.Duanmu Xingling had reached an agreement with Zhang Ruochen so that she would prevent Huang Yanchen from killing Zhang Ruochen.Thereupon, Duanmu Xingling also drew out of a sword and stopped Huang Yanchen once again.\u201cXingling, why do you stop me from killing him?\u201dSuddenly, Huang Yanchen struck out with nine sword techniques one after another in the air, stabbing towards nine key parts of Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne special feature of Huang Yanchen\u2019s Genuine Qi was its wind nature. A seven-meter-diameter storm vortex emerged with her strikes automatically, like a series of blades flying from a whirlpool.\u201cWhew!\u201dOne of the blades flew by Zhang Ruochen\u2019s armpit and cut into a pillar. It left a four-centimetre-deep gash there.\u201cShe probably triggered the Gale Sacred Mark, so her Genuine Qi would carry the wind nature.\u201dStanding on top of the stairs, Zhang Ruochen watched the sword techniques wielded by Huang Yanchen and Duanmu Xingling carefully and pondered the flaws and weaknesses in them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she unleashed her Genuine Qi, it became extremely cold, and snowflakes danced in the air.Other warriors who opened up the Sacred Mark of Ice cold wouldn\u2019t be as powerful, even if they were at the Black Realm\u2019s Completion. Only a great master like Duanmu Xingling, was able to condense snowflakes within a 30-feet radius, once her Qi was unleashed.Duanmu Xingling was just at the Black Realm\u2019s Completion, and could only condense snowflakes within a 30-feet radius. If she cultivated the Earth Realm, she would be able to condense snowflakes within a 100-feet radius when she unleashed her Genuine Qi.If she cultivated the Heaven Realm, she\u2019d be able to condense snowflakes within a 1000-feet radius. When she\u2019d fight against others, there would be snowflakes all over the sky for hundreds of miles. That\u2019s the making of a true Martial Arts myth.Zhang Ruochen nodded and said, \u201cThey are worthy of being Profound Division Warriors and are so powerful. I guess they\u2019ve reached the Sword Following the Mind Intermediate Stage. Maybe they\u2019re close to the Sword Following the Mind Advanced Stage.\u201dOnly warriors who have reached the Sword Following the Mind Intermediate Stage had a chance to go to the Martial Market\u2019s Coliseum and become a Profound Division Warrior.\u201cXingling, if you stop me again, I\u2019ll not be polite to you!\u201d Huang Yanchen attacked more and more quickly. Because her Genuine Qi was rich in wind nature, her speed advantage was gradually displayed.Duanmu Xingling said, \u201cSister Chen, you should calm down, if you kill him on a spur of the moment, the Martial Market\u2019s School will punish you heavily. Why would you destroy yourself along with him? And Even if you don\u2019t do that, the rogue won\u2019t live a month!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Huang Yanchen asked curiously. She pulled back her sword and stopped attacking.Duanmu Xingling also withdrew her sword and smiled. \u201cHe is going to get a final battle with Feng Zhilin on the life and death platform. It will take place in 20 days.\u201d\u201cHow could it be? Feng Zhilin has cultivated to the Black Realm\u2019s Final State. In Western Campus, he isn\u2019t a top master, but he is a strong middle-class warrior. Zhang Ruochen might defeat him with another two years of practice, but he\u2019ll die if he fights against him now.\u201dDuanmu Xingling nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right! So you needn\u2019t kill him by yourself. In 20 days, he\u2019ll be killed by Feng Zhilin.\u201dHuang Yanchen still didn\u2019t believe Zhang Ruochen would be that stupid. She gazed at him coldly and asked, \u201cAre you going to fight against Feng Zhilin on the life and death platform?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Zhang Ruochen responded indifferently.He didn\u2019t think it was a big deal!\u201cSwish!\u201dHuang Yanchen took back her blue sword, stared at Zhang Ruochen as if he was dead, and said, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll let you live more 20 days.\u201dThen Huang Yanchen walked towards the gate of Yellow No.1 and was going to leave. Suddenly she stopped and turned to Zhang Ruochen, \u201cIn 20 days, if you can defeat Feng Zhilin on the life and death platform, I will spare your life. If you lose and Feng Zhilin lets you live, I will kill you myself.\u201dAfter that, Huang Yanchen stepped forward with a wisp of Genuine Qi appearing on her feet. Each of her steps was a meter long and only her shadow could be seen.Seeing Huang Yanchen leave, Duanmu Xingling took a deep breath and asked, \u201cZhang Ruochen, you have 20 days. Are you sure you can defeat Feng Zhilin?\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t reply, stared at Duanmu Xingling seriously and nodded, \u201cSenior sister, what\u2019s the rank of your Ice cold Sacred Mark?\u201d\u201cClass six!\u201dDuanmu Xingling became proud of herself and hugged herself. \u201cI opened up my Ice cold Sacred Mark at age of two.\u201dThe earlier warriors open up the Sacred Mark, the earlier they were able to practice.Zhang Ruochen nodded. \u201cNo wonder you reached the Black Realm\u2019s Completion at 13 years old. You\u2019re very talented.\u201d\u201cHow could it be? I\u2019m 18.\u201dDuanmu Xingling cast a contemptuous glance at Zhang Ruochen, blinked and said, \u201d What an incredible warrior he was that he could reach the Black Realm\u2019s Completion at 13. Even the first genius of Omen Ridge, Zhang Tiangui didn\u2019t reach it until 15.\u201dIn order to prove her age, Duanmu Xingling lifted her chest slightly to show her rounded breasts.One had to admit, Duanmu Xingling\u2019s breasts were bigger than Huang Yanchen\u2019s. They were well developed.\u201c18?\u201d Zhang Ruochen was a little shocked. Except for her breasts, the rest of her body didn\u2019t give away her age.Duanmu Xingling said, \u201cThe exercises I practice were special when I achieved the first level, my body will stay the same as at that time. I succeeded the first level at 13, so I look like I\u2019m still 13 years old. I can\u2019t gain the look of 18 years of age unless I clear my Genuine Qi.\u201dZhang Ruochen immediately understood. All of a sudden, he seemed to be thinking of something. \u201cIt reminded me of the \u2018Vast Universe Gong\u2019, a Moon Worship Demonic Sect exercise. It\u2019s similar to your exercise.\u201d\u201cYou know \u2018Vast Universe Gong\u2019?\u201dDuanmu Xingling exclaimed with a little shock. As she realized she was being rude, she asked, \u201cIs there this kind of exercises in the Moon Worship Demonic Sect? How have I never heard of it?\u201dZhang Ruochen said, \u201c\u2018Vast Universe Gong\u2019 is a top Moon Worship Demonic Sect exercise. Only high-status warriors have the right to practice it. Of course, outsiders don\u2019t know it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you know it? Are you an undercover agent from the Moon Worship Demonic Sect to the Martial Market\u2019s School?\u201d Duanmu Xingling asked tentatively.\u201cI just heard of it!\u201dZhang Ruochen had seen many practical skills including Vast Universe Gong. Of course, Vast Universe Gong\u2019s last chapter was kept in the Moon Worship Demonic Sect\u2019s headquarters, so Zhang Ruochen hasn\u2019t seen it.Not wanting to reveal the secrets of his past life, Zhang Ruochen changed the subject and asked, \u201cWhy did you get so surprised when you heard Vast Universe Gong?\u201d\u201cReally? No!\u201dDuanmu Xingling shook her head rapidly and said, \u201cI was just frightened by the Moon Worship Demonic Sect. In the Kunlun\u2019s Field, they are taboo. We\u2019d better not talk about it or we\u2019ll be regarded as Moon Worship Demonic Sect followers.\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t want to continue this topic anymore and said, \u201cSenior sister, I\u2019m practicing a palm technique and I have encountered some obstacles. Would you like to try it with me? I want to find out the palm technique\u2019s weakness from actual combat.\u201d\u201cNot a problem!\u201dThere was a faint fragrance on her body which spread to the center of the courtyard. She stood upright and crooked her finger to beckon him. \u201cCome on, attack me with your palm technique.\u201d\u201cSenior sister, you should be careful!\u201dZhang Ruochen stood three meters away from Duanmu Xingling. He stepped forward and moved his hands with all his bones and muscle taut.Zhang Ruochen pushed off his foot and rushed in.Duanmu Xingling was a little astonished. \u201cIn just 10 days, he has made great progress. 10 days ago, his speed was only 38 meters per second, and now it\u2019s 40 meters per second. The Black Realm\u2019s Medium State Warriors move at just 40 meters per second.\u201d\u201cDragon Shape and Elephant Shadow!\u201dHis arms rang out with crying dragons when he exploded all his energy through his powerful palm technique punching towards Duanmu Xingling.The rushing Genuine Qi surged from Zhang Ruochen\u2019s palms and turned into a gust of wind which set Duanmu Xingling\u2019s robe rustling.Duanmu Xingling nodded once again. \u201cHis palm technique is powerful and ingenious indeed. It is remarkable that he had the ability to converge all his power into his palms.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dDuanmu Xingling attacked faster than Zhang Ruochen. Just a shadow of her repelled Zhang Ruochen.Zhang Ruochen immediately released the second palm, the third palm\u2026\u201cBang, bang!\u201dZhang Ruochen attacked quickly and his continuous handprints were like sets of waves.Duanmu Xingling stood still with one hand behind her back and withstood Zhang Ruochen\u2019s handprints with the other hand.Zhang Ruochen continuously unleashed more than 100 palms until his Qi Lake was running out of Genuine Qi. Then he stepped back immediately and stopped attacking.Duanmu Xingling stared at Zhang Ruochen and said, \u201d Your palm technique was so powerful and flawless!\u201dZhang Ruochen\u2019s body was covered in sweat. He laughed. \u201cThis palm technique hasn\u2019t succeeded yet.\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t succeeded?\u201d Duanmu Xingling was shocked and said, \u201cI planned to guide you, but I find there is no need. I think your palm technique has reached the perfect Realm.\u201dZhang Ruochen shook his head slightly and said, \u201d I have already know the weakness! Again!\u201dAfter that, Zhang Ruochen released the fourth palm \u201cDragon Shape and Elephant Shadow\u201d to attack Duanmu Xingling.Be mindful, Duanmu Xingling was a perfect training partner as she was a Profound Division Warrior.He didn\u2019t stop until he ran out of energy. After sending Duanmu Xingling away, Zhang Ruochen went back to the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel and ate half a kilo of Spiritual Brawn. His energy and Genuine Qi recovered quickly.Zhang Ruochen began to recall the weakness he found when he fought against Duanmu Xingling and practiced again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe next day, he visited Black No.1 and asked Duanmu Xingling to fight him to practice his palm technique.The third day, the fourth day\u2026On the fifth day, the fourth movement of the Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm was not yet successful, but Zhang Ruochen broke into the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage.It was normal for him to break through to a Realm at such a high speed. After all, he had the Time and Space Spinel and his Practicing time was three times as much as other warriors.Also, he ate 24 kilograms of Spiritual Brawn. That was to say, reaching the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage was simply a matter of course.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: The Palm Technique\u2019s Success Translator: Transn Editor: TransnZhang Ruochen was in a good mood, because he had reached the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage and improved his cultivation greatly.As soon as the day was breaking, he visited Black No.1 and asked Duanmu Xingling to fight against him as a way to improve his palm technique.As his palm technique improved, Zhang Ruochen felt he was not far away from the success of \u201cDragon Shape and Elephant Shadow\u201d. He just needed an opportunity to break through it. This feeling was wonderful.Zhang Ruochen didn\u2019t rashly break into Black No.1. He stood outside and channeled Genuine Qi into his voice. \u201cSenior sister, I want to practice palm technique with you again. Are you in there?\u201dA moment later, Duanmu Xingling opened up the door and stared at Zhang Ruochen with a drowsy look. \u201cDon\u2019t you sleep?\u201dOf course, warriors were also normal people who needed to rest but they just needed less. A Black Realm Warrior only needed two hours of sleep to recover energy.As for Zhang Ruochen, he had powerful Spiritual Power, so it was enough for him to rest for an hour and he used the remaining hours to practice. Even if he had not slept for three days and nights, he maintained a good mental state.Zhang Ruochen laughed apologetically and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you. In that case, I\u2019ll visit you at noon!\u201d\u201cWell, anyway, I\u2019ve rested enough. Let\u2019s start now so that I can avoid your bother at noon. Did you have progress in your palm technique?\u201dDuanmu Xingling led him into the square of Dragon Martial Temple, stood upright with her one hand on her back and crooked her finger to beckon him, \u201cToday, we fight in this place! I will still use one hand and you can attack me with all your power.\u201dZhang Ruochen stared at Duanmu Xingling, and nodded softly. He was very grateful to this beautiful sister who was only 13 or 14 years old. She is a Warrior of Division Profound. How can the average person find her to practice?He was able to make so much progress because Duanmu Xingling helped him a lot.\u201cAwoo!\u201dZhang Ruochen roared and circulated his Genuine Qi. Finally, a stream of blood flowed from his pores and condensed into a faint blood column soaring into the sky.\u201cSoaring Animal Spirits, he reached the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage so soon!\u201d Duanmu Xingling blinked fluttering her eyelashes, and she was shocked by his rapid improvement.For just five days, Zhang Ruochen had made huge progress. Duanmu Xingling could easily see that every day was a new step forward for his cultivation.It\u2019s unbelievable that he could make such a huge advance at such a high speed, even if he had enough practice resources.The rattling bones and muscles sounded like a dragon\u2019s cry as well as an elephant\u2019s roar. The Spiritual Blood he let out got thicker and thicker.\u201cSwish!\u201dHe moved, turned into a fast wind and dashed out.His speed reached 44 meters per second, a whole new level.\u201cHow fast! his speed is equal to the Black Realm\u2019s Final State Warriors.\u201dDuanmu Xingling\u2019s eyes became brighter with the shock of his talent. If she hadn\u2019t witnessed what happened herself, she wouldn\u2019t have believed he could become so powerful within half a month.Finally, she had enough confidence that Zhang Ruochen could defeat Feng Zhilin!\u201cGiven the speed of his progress, it will not be difficult for him to defeat Feng Zhilin in half a month.\u201dDuanmu Xingling put out her hands and gave off Genuine Qi from the hollow of her hands. Her footsteps were flowing like treading on the wind. She attacked Zhang Ruochen directly with one single palm and a faint billow of Genuine Qi quickly appeared in front of her palm.Boom!\u201dZhang Ruochen took three steps back after receiving Duanmu Xingling\u2019s strike.Her Genuine Qi was so cold that it made a layer of white frost form on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s hands, which left his hands numb.It was the first time that Duanmu Xingling had attacked him proactively. Zhang Ruochen wasn\u2019t frightened but overjoyed and clapped towards Duanmu Xingling.Pure Jade Genuine Qi inside Zhang Ruochen\u2019s body surged out and quickly thawed the frost on his hands.Duanmu Xingling moved as quickly as a ghost and unleashed a dexterous palm technique. She forced Zhang Ruochen to step back continuously without any chance to attack back.After three strikes, Duanmu Xingling slapped on Zhang Ruochen\u2019s chest making him fly out 10 meters.Zhang Ruochen slapped the ground, turned over in the air, and landed on the ground firmly.Under the palm attack of Duanmu Xingling, his five internal organs and six hollow organs had been strongly shocked and he\u2019d gotten a little hurt.Duanmu Xingling laughed. \u201cCan you guess how much power I used?\u201dZhang Ruochen just shook his head.Duanmu Xingling continued, \u201cI just used half my power which was equal to that of a Black Realm\u2019s Final State Warrior. It\u2019s great that you could catch three strikes.\u201dZhang Ruochen laughed bitterly. \u201cBut you just used one hand.\u201dDuanmu Xingling shook her head and said, \u201cI know more about Martial Arts than a Black Realm\u2019s Final State Warrior, so it\u2019s only fair to use one hand.\u201dThe reason why Duanmu Xingling held back her cultivation to the Black Realm\u2019s Final State was that Feng Zhilin\u2019s cultivation was at that level.Duanmu Xingling said, \u201cIf you have the ability to force me to use the other hand or if you can force me back, you will defeat Feng Zhilin.\u201d\u201cOK! Let\u2019s do it again!\u201dHaving a strong fighting spirit, Zhang Ruochen attacked Duanmu Xingling again.At this time, he not only used the fourth movement of Dragon and Elephant Prajna Palm but also used the first three palms.\u2018Elephant Galloping!\u2019\u201cDragon in the Sky!\u201d\u201cDragon and Elephant Returning to Earth!\u201d\u201cDragon Shape and Elephant Shadow!\u201dAfter he unleashed the four palms, Zhang Ruochen\u2019s Genuine Qi decreased. He was hit, flew out, and nearly fell to the ground. This all made him feel very dispirited.\u201cAll the four palm techniques are powerful, well, very well.\u201d Duanmu Xingling wore a silvery smile.\u201cAgain!\u201dZhang Ruochen didn\u2019t get discouraged, and attacked Duanmu Xingling again.This time, he caught six strikes. After that, Duanmu Xingling grasped his chest and threw him off.Zhang Ruochen turned in the air and steadied his body. He pushed down with his legs, and one hand caught the ground, but he did not fall.\u201cIncredible!\u201dDuan Xingxing stared at Zhang Ruochen and felt that Zhang Rushen\u2019s breath became stronger and stronger. It was like a prone figure lying on the ground.Zhang Ruochen had an unwavering look with the jade-white Genuine Qi running quickly through the 36 Meridians inside his body and his 10 fingers turned pale like white jade.\u201cSlap!\u201dThere was a splitting sound from under his feet and hand. The stone tablet had actually cracked.\u201cDragon Shape and Elephant Shadow!\u201dZhang Ruochen flew up and attacked towards Duanmu Xingling.In Duanmu Xingling\u2019s view, Zhang Ruochen divided into two and became two people. One unleashed the dragon\u2019s claw; the other unleashed the elephant\u2019s palm. They came from two directions.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dDuanmu Xingling changed her expression slightly and channeled Genuine Qi into her index finger. She pointed out it towards the Zhang Ruochen on the left and repelled him.Suddenly, Zhang Ruchen from the right side attacked and slammed his hand on her chest.Duanmu Xingling bent back into an arch with her hands on the ground. She then raised her leg to kick towards Zhang Ruochen\u2019s wrist.Suddenly, the right and left Zhang Ruochen merged into one and he unleashed his two palms at the same time.Duanmu Xingling converged her Genuine Qi and slapped out her palm.Boom!\u201dZhang Ruochen stood steadily while Duanmu Xingling catapulted backward about 16 meters. She dug in her feet and steadied her position.Duanmu Xingling looked at Zhang Ruochen with shock and asked, \u201cIs the power you\u2019re using a successful level of \u2018Dragon Shape and Elephant Shadow\u2019?\u201dZhang Ruochen withdrew his palms and nodded. \u201cWhat do you think of this power?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s equal to the palm technique of a mid-class Spiritual Stage.\u201d Duanmu Xingling laughed and continued, \u201cYou have a 70% chance of beating Feng Zhilin with your current power.\u201dIn the beginning, Duanmu Xingling didn\u2019t believe that Zhang Ruochen was able to defeat Feng Zhilin in one month.The reason why she helped him was that she wanted to give him a better chance of saving himself. After all, it was difficult for Western Campus to bring up a genius like Zhang Ruochen and it would too bad if he died on the Life and Death Platform.She did not expect that Zhang Ruochen had developed the ability to defeat Feng Zhilin within half a month. She had witnessed each step of his progress, and it was incredible.However, she didn\u2019t know that the Space Domain was Zhang Ruochen\u2019s biggest advantage which he kept to himself. If he displayed the power of the Space Domain, then he had a 100% chance of beating Feng Zhilin.Zhang Ruochen said, \u201cThanks for your help, I couldn\u2019t have Practiced to a successful level in such a short time without your help.\u201dDuanmu Xingling laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid you will lose face for Dragon Martial Temple. For of this reason, I helped you practice palm techniques. After all, you belong to Yellow No.1. I\u2019m curious about how strong your cultivation will be after half a month.\u201d\u201cYou will know it when I fight on the Life and Death Platform in half a month. Since my palm technique has reached a successful level, I won\u2019t bother you anymore. See you,\u201d Zhang Ruochen said courteously and walked towards Yellow No.1.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDuanmu Xingling stared at his back, her eyes flashing. \u201cHe is very talented and it will not be long before he practices to the Black Realm\u2019s Completion. Sister Chen picked up a treasure. Why can\u2019t I pick up a genius like this?\u201dZhang Ruochen went back to Yellow No.1 and continued to practice while grasping two Spiritual Crystals in his hand.He was absorbing Spiritual Qi to consolidate his Realm.Practicing in the internal space of the Time and Space Spinel for three days could consolidate the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage thoroughly.Of course, as he had just reached the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage, his Genuine Qi was only 20 percent of the Qi Pool and there was a huge space to fill. The capacity of his Qi Pool had enlarged 10 times when he reached the Black Realm\u2019s Advanced Stage and could hold much more Genuine Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
