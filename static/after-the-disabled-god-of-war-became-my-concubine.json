    "Chapter 1": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs night fell, the stars in the Milky Way wandered about.The King\u2019s Mansion in the middle of Qinghe Square was decorated with red silk and lanterns early in the morning. Once the sky darkened, the lights were immediately lit, and from afar, they projected a bright golden red. The busy servants went in and out of the threshold and the thick layer of firecracker debris in front of the steps were all illustrative of a festive atmosphere.When the soft breeze of early spring coming from the south of the Yangtze River blew, the red candles in the lanterns flickered, shaking the auspicious characters on the lanterns.There was a joyful event taking place at the King\u2019s mansion today. The third day of February was an auspicious day appointed by His Majesty.His Majesty said that on February 3rd, everything was suitable, especially marriage.As for whether this day was indeed an auspicious day, it didn\u2019t matter. The most important thing was that the emperor must let the King marry on this day. Even if a funeral was underway at the King\u2019s mansion today, they must put the coffin on hold and first finish marrying the person into the household.A word from the emperor was as powerful as tens of thousands of pounds.Even if this emperor, who was assailed by a rebel army two years ago in Yecheng, the capital of the country, fled like a drowning dog with officials of all ranks all the way south in distress and dragged out an ignoble existence in Yuhuang.Despite this, the emperor was still the emperor, even if he resembled a stray dog. What was more, this emperor won a huge victory just a few days ago. He was now riding on the crest of success, like a cat that swallowed the canary.After all, who in this world did not know that His Majesty caught the invincible and fearsome General Huo of Northern Liang and broke both his legs?It was indeed a great joy.There was grand jubilation in Jing, as in the King\u2019s mansion. This double happiness spread to the King\u2019s mansion, but the people in the mansion couldn\u2019t cheer. Instead, each of them were grief-stricken as if bereaved of parents.After all\u2026Captured generals were commonly killed or mutilated.However, a general dressed in a wedding dress to be married into their King\u2019s mansion as a concubine\u2026.This, what the hell was this!?Therefore, although the King\u2019s mansion was beating drums and blowing trumpets today, gay with lanterns and festoons, and had been lighting off firecrackers for most of the day, none of the faces in the King\u2019s mansion bore a trace of a smile.Everyone bustled about and watched the excitement, but each tacitly bowed servilely and dared not speak.This kind of silence permeated amidst the joyful atmosphere, making the atmosphere in the King\u2019s mansion a little depressing. The further you went in, the drearier the atmosphere became.Especially in Anyin Hall.Anyin Hall was where His Highness lived, and the word \u201cAnyin\u201d was the name that the great master in the palace gave him from the Lotus Sutra.This wasn\u2019t unusual. After all, His Highness was born sick and weak from the womb, and his body had never been very healthy. The fact that he had lived to this day in such a sickly manner was thought to be because he had borrowed some of the Buddha\u2019s light.At present, the silence in Anyin Hall was ablaze with lights.The entirety of the King\u2019s mansion was hung with red silk, but there was no red silk in Anyin Hall. Under the curtain of the night, the courtyard was filled with candlelights with a warm breeze blowing. Several tall, century-old birchleaf pear trees scattered white fallen flowers in the wind to the ground.The maids in the courtyard shuttled in and out, acting invisible with bated breath.Everyone knew that His Highness was in a foul mood today. His Highness has always been reticent and rarely smiled. He always looked gloomy and utterly unfathomable. They couldn\u2019t guess what was on his mind.And even more so today.All things considered, although His Highness was homosexual, he was also a man who feared no one. When has there ever been a crippled general of an enemy country bestowed to a King as a concubine?Regardless of how dangerous the man was, he was akin to a trapped beast. The Emperor\u2019s decree alone was beyond absurd. It was like writing humiliating words into an imperial decree and slapping the King in the face.Hence, it was only natural that His Highness was in a terrible mood. They, the servants, only had to serve cautiously, lest they\u2019d court bad luck and end up losing their heads at this moment.The room was quiet.Because His Highness married a concubine, he did not have to welcome her personally, but the nuptial chamber was necessary.Therefore, His Highness cleaned up early in the morning, changed into a gold and red wedding robe, and bound his jet-black hair with his jade crown.He was sitting on the couch, holding a book in one hand.People stood by his side silently, and no one dared to disturb him.A young maid who was waiting in the courtyard entered cautiously. She had been ordered by the chief concierge to come in and take away the basin of water by the dressing table.She kept her head down with her hands clasped in front of her, not daring to let her eyes roam around. The atmosphere in the courtyard was already suffocating enough, but she didn\u2019t expect the King\u2019s room to be even worse.The incense was quietly burning in the furnace; the furnishings were simple and solemn; and the lamps were as bright as daylight. It should be an elegant and tranquil place, but it was like the netherworld surrounded by demons, making her legs tremble in fear.She tried hard not to make a sound while giving a silent salute to the King on the couch, and then flew to carry the copper basin on the floor.But because she didn\u2019t always get to serve inside the house, she was not very skilled. When she got up with the basin, the rim of the basin accidentally hit the edge of the ebony table, made a muffled sound, and splashed some water out.The thud broke the dead-like calm.The young maid\u2019s hand shook; her body tensed up, and she hastily raised her eyes to look at her master on the couch.She saw King raising his eyes, and his gaze fell on her quietly.How beautiful those eyes were. The shape was long and narrow, and the tips of his eyes lazily tilted upward. Combined with his long eyelashes and a slightly raised long eyebrows, he appeared languid and enchanting, the embodiment of the androgynous devil in books who could suck souls.There was a small scarlet mole adorning the tip of his beautiful eye. In the flickering of the lights, it was almost as if one\u2019s soul would be taken away.However, the young maid felt chilled to the bone.His eyes were so dark, they were bottomless. Beneath the beauty, they were haughty and ice-cold, as if looking at a dead soul.Her legs went weak, and she fell to her knees. The copper basin also crashed to the ground with a bang, splashing water all over the floor.\u2014Jiang Suizhou stiffly waved his hand, motioning for the young maid to retreat.As if she had received an amnesty, she incessantly kowtowed to him and apologized for her offense. She then picked up the wet copper basin on the floor and stumbled as she fled away.Jiang Suizhou looked after her fleeing helter-skelter and felt somewhat confused deep inside.\u2026Who am I? Am I so scary?However, he dared not ask this aloud. Naturally, no one could explain it.He remembered that he had just finished replying to the student\u2019s message and turned off the computer in preparation for sleep. For him, it was just an extremely ordinary day \u2013 except for the paper he received today, which was just a little too amateurish.After all, he had been a lecturer at J University for several years, and also taught graduates. He had seen all sorts of odd papers, so he believed he had a wide range of experience. When he was dealing with students, he could always keep calm and be good humored, answer them with ease, and maintain a benign countenance.\u2026But it was the first time he saw a history student, based on unofficial records, writing his thesis like a commentary on the ups and downs, singing it with a beautiful voice and rich emotions.He wrote that Huo Wujiu, the founding General of the Liang Dynasty and the Marquis of Dingbei, had an unspeakable secret in leading the army to destroy Jing. The whys and wherefores of this was that when he was held captive in South Jing, he was once taken as a concubine by a sickly King whose name was untraceable and whose title was \u201cJing\u201d in South Jing. He endured three years of humiliation, Therefore, when he returned to Northern Liang, he raised an army to swiftly destroy Jing. It was also because of this that he harbored a grudge.As a result, the King of Jing, who died prematurely due to illness in the few entries in the official history, also died an unnatural death.He did not die of illness, but was beheaded by the Marquis of Dingbei. To avenge those years, the Marquis of Dingbei even hung his head on the walls of Lin\u2019an and left it hanging there for three whole years.Jiang Suizhou felt at that time that the kid probably chose the wrong profession. He should have been a screenwriter.For history majors, it was basically the same as using My Fair Kings\u00a0to study the history of the Qing Dynasty.Hence, Jiang Suizhou criticized the paper mercilessly, and finally gave his own suggestions for revision: change the topic and rewrite the thesis.That student was also quite stubborn.\u201cHow do you know that an unofficial history is false? You can\u2019t say that my paper is a fabrication just because of this! Even if you have studied a lot of historical materials, you have not personally experienced and seen it with your own eyes!\u201dAfter receiving this reply, Jiang Suizhou sneered.I study history, so do I have a need to experience it myself? If I were to study paleontology, then would I still have to go into the mountains and become a monkey?He coldly pushed his glasses up and replied, \u201cFair enough, but the paper, rewrite it.\u201dAfter sending the reply, he rubbed his sore shoulder and neck with a smile and turned off the computer.And at that very moment, the surroundings went abruptly black.\u2026Power outage?But it was dark all around. There wasn\u2019t even a faint light that would normally come through at night.Jiang Suizhou froze and tried to reach out to find the power source on the table.But before he could stretch out his hand, the surroundings suddenly lit up.There was a lamp, but it was jumping and flickering.Lamps illuminated the area around him.He found himself sitting in a room, under a warm yellow light. The surrounding furnishings were all ancient, with screens, partitioned treasure display shelves; a place of charm and beauty, noble and dignified. Although there were no bright colors around, and it looked ancient, the shine reflected by those objects was of a reserved and solemn luxury.The house was extremely spacious. There were a lot of maids standing around, seven or eight of them at a glance, and each was standing with their eyes downcast. It was not crowded at all.Jiang Suizhou was a bit confused.\u2026Illusion?He lowered his eyes.At this time, he was actually wearing a bright red robe with wide sleeves. The silk draped on him felt luxurious to the touch, and the gold silk embroidery with intricate cloud patterns glittered under the lamp.Based on this, Jiang Suizhou concluded it was late Jing and early Liang.The book in his hand was printed from right to left in vertical rows, in traditional Song characters. Looking at the ink traces, they were still in the stage of engraving and printing.The low table beside him was Chinese rosewood, and he had seen the tea cup on the table in the museum.[Sweet white glaze cup with camellia pattern from the tomb of the King and Marquis at the end of Jing.]Jiang Suizhou\u2019s gaze was vacant.\u2026Who am I? Where am I? How did something dug up from the ancient tombs end up on my desk?It was also at this time that the reckless maid bumped and produced a thin sound, drawing his attention to her.But as soon as he glanced over and before he could think about what to say, the girl about ten years old fell on her knees in fright. She spilled water all over the floor and kept kowtowing.On the contrary, Jiang Suizhou was dumbfounded.He tried to remain calm and raised his hand, signaling her to retreat.He watched the little girl gratefully clutch the basin and run away. After running only a few steps, she nearly slipped by the water underfoot, and ran right into the man coming in.\u201cHow dare you! Get out, now!\u201d the man scolded.A eunuch\u2019s voice.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes to look at him, and saw this man trotting all the way over, with a clean face and a smile on his face.His smile was quite sincere, with a trifle of ingratiation.\u201cMaster.\u201d He skillfully saluted in front of Jiang Suizhou, approached his side, and bowed down to whisper in his ear.\u201cThat bridal sedan chair has arrived, Master. Don\u2019t let the auspicious hour slip by.\u201dJiang Suizhou looked at him quietly, and the hand hidden in his sleeve pinched himself severely.He did not believe that he suddenly crossed over in time.Also, without fully understanding who he was and his circumstances, he was about to have\u2026A wedding night.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQuality Checker: CharmThe pain from the palm of his hand shot through his central nervous system, and he was in such pain that his spirits cleared, but the picture in front of him did not change at all.Due to the pain, his eyes even turned chilly for a moment, making the eunuch in front of him shiver in fright.\u2026He did seem to have somehow become a man from ancient times.This man should be a royalty in the last years of the Jing Dynasty. As for the rest\u2026he didn\u2019t know anything.Oh, he knew one more thing.This person was marrying a concubine today. But because he had now become\u00a0him, the concubine, too, had become his.That was all the information he got. The eunuch in front of him was still all smiles while standing here with a bow, waiting for him to go into the nuptial chamber.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s head was on the verge of exploding.\u2026What was this all about?!He was frantic deep inside, but none of it showed on his face.The eunuch seemed a little anxious, and his smile turned somewhat bitter. He lowered his voice, and his tone grew painstakingly persuasive.\u201cMaster, this servant knows you\u2019re unwilling, but it is the Emperor\u2019s decree after all\u2026\u201d He advised, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t like it, just go through the motions! That person\u2026I heard that his martial arts have been abolished earlier on, and he is now a cripple. It\u2019s very safe, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u2026Someone\u2019s martial arts was abolished, and he became crippled?Jian Suizhou\u2019s eyes showed bafflement.Was this a game of power play?He alone knew that at the end of the Jing dynasty, the dynasty was rotten, and the emperor was muddleheaded. In particular, Emperor Jingyou, the last emperor of Jing, was notoriously absurd and fatuous, a self-indulgent ruler. History recorded that he was obsessed with beauty and treated imperial affairs as child\u2019s play. He was especially partial to his relatives and allowed his uncle Pang Shao to run amok.However, the Jing Dynasty had only a few heirs. By the time Emperor Jingyou came into power, most of the royal children of the same generation had died prematurely, leaving only Jingwang, an invalid who died in the prime of his youth.Because of this, the Jing Dynasty fled south for a few years before it was wiped out by the rising Liang Dynasty.But now\u2026it seemed that he was also a part of this chaotic and despotic court.Jiang Suizhou had a bitter taste in his mouth.What evil deed did he commit that made him go from being a corporate with a comfortable life to being a noble aristocrat of a doomed dynasty?Was it because he had just scolded his student a little too hard?How was that possible?Just then, there was a call from outside.\u201cQianshan-gongong 1 , the bridal palanquin has already been carried into Yincui Pavilion,\u201d informed a maid.The eunuch gritted his teeth and raised his voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry!\u201dThe maid immediately shut her mouth.The eunuch turned his head and looked earnestly at Jiang Suizhou again, his eyes full of pleading.Jiang Suizhou knew that in this situation, he was bound to face the nuptial chamber, and he\u2019d die either way. But since the lady married him against her wishes and was also disabled, he thought he could easily muddle through today\u2019s wedding night.As for the rest\u2026Wait until he survived today first, and then he could slowly figure out his identity and situation before making plans.He mumbled a faint hum and stood up.The eunuch\u2019s eyes lit up, and he quickly reached out to help him.Jiang Suizhou was unaccustomed to being served. He didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion, but when he stood up, he felt weak, tired, and a little dizzy.He could only let the eunuch support him.He stepped off the platform. Next to him was a floor-to-ceiling western mirror. Jiang Suizhou glanced at it sideways and saw his reflection in the mirror.\u2026He actually looked exactly the same as himself, but looked two or three years younger. He appeared to be about twenty-four or twenty-five.His students had previously complimented him on his good looks and said he looked like a villain. Jiang Suizhou originally denied it, but looking at the person in the mirror now, Jiang Suizhou agreed\u2026He didn\u2019t look like a good person.He was already beautifully cold and appeared extremely heartless to begin with. Along with his long hair and wide sleeves, he looked even more exquisite and far removed from the masses. His eyes, in particular, were inherently cold. A faint glance at people could freeze their hearts.Jiang Suizhou retracted his gaze, and out of the corner of his eye, he found a small vermillion dot adorning the tip of his upper left eyelid.This mole was something he didn\u2019t have originally.However, before he could take a closer look, the eunuch led him past the mirror and towards the door.Someone was waiting outside with a thin cloak ready in his hand. Seeing Jiang Suizhou approaching, that person skillfully wrapped the cloak around him.Jiang Suizhou was puzzled and frowned.He was already dressed thicker than the people around him, so why did he wrap him in another layer?The eunuch next to him keenly sensed his expression and immediately clarified kindly, \u201cIt\u2019s windy at night. Your Highness can\u2019t bear it, so it\u2019s better to wear one more.\u201d\u2026Your Highness?Before Jiang Suizhou came back to his senses, he was led down the steps and onto the palanquin stationed in front of the room.Once out of the room, he felt it. The wind was supposed to be warm, but it felt cold when it blew on him. This was different from being sick. It was more like being congenitally deficient and having a low immunity.Combined with the eunuch\u2019s \u201cHighness\u201d address just now, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart felt anything but reassured.At the end of the Jing Dynasty, there was only one invalid who was called \u201cHighness.\u201dIt was His Royal Highness Jingwang, whose name had been erased from the history books. He was said to be congenitally deficient, and he died early due to illness.When the palanquin was lifted, Jiang Suizhou felt a little dizzy.In accordance with the course of history, he would live for three to five more years at most and die of illness.Even if he didn\u2019t die of illness, the Northern Liang would exterminate Great Jing, and he would not be kept as a remnant of the previous dynasty.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s gaze was empty. He slowly leaned back in his chair.Anyone who suddenly realized that he only had a few years to live wouldn\u2019t be ecstatic.After calming down, he turned his head, looked at the eunuch beside the palanquin, and decided to confirm with him again.What did he call him just now?\u201cQianshan,\u201d he called.But to his surprise, upon hearing his call, the eunuch beside him raised his head in disbelief and looked at him blankly.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart thumped.From his reaction, he knew that he must have called him wrong.In ancient times, those who served nobles were always sensitive and sharp-minded. Having committed such a huge gaffe the moment he came, he was afraid\u2026However, before he could finish his worries, a flattered look surfaced on the eunuch\u2019s face, to the point where he was at a loss what to do.\u201cYour Highness, please give your command!\u201d His eyes glowed, like a dog wagging its tail and spreading its joy. \u201cYou-you should still call this servant, Meng Qianshan\u2026\u201dJiang Suizhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dAll right, he was overthinking. This personal attendant of Jingwang\u2019s didn\u2019t seem to be too bright.He averted his eyes, hummed, and asked with an air of calmness, \u201cHow long has it been since she was carried to Jingwang\u2019s residence?\u201dMeng Qianshan didn\u2019t hear any of the probing in his words. He just thought that the Prince was worried about delaying the auspicious time, and told him honestly, \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry. Madam Huo has just arrived. You will arrive just in time.\u201dHe didn\u2019t refute the phrase \u201cJingwang\u2019s residence,\u201d so Jiang Suizhou was sure.He has indeed become the short-lived ghost who wasn\u2019t penned much in the history books.Wait\u2026He frowned.Madam Huo?This new concubine was surnamed Huo?Although he knew that unofficial history was nothing but nonsense, he couldn\u2019t help but think of what was on that student\u2019s paper.He was crippled and was married into King Jing\u2019s mansion, plus his surname was Huo\u2026This new concubine\u2014why did she sound so much like the General Huo of the history books?However, Jiang Suizhou immediately shook away this thought.What was he thinking? Even TV dramas wouldn\u2019t dare to play the plot of that unofficial history like this. It was a fabricated vulgar gibberish to please the public at a glance. It must not be true.\u2014Jiang Suizhou confirmed the theory in his mind, and shut his mouth. But Meng Qianshan, who was next to him, chattered on and on with him the whole way.Jiang Suizhou gradually realized that this servant, who had little brains, must have been usually left out in the cold. Today, he mistakenly treated him graciously, and he began to revel in it.It was good that he was silly.Listening to him rambling, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s originally heavy heart eased a little, and between the lines, he grasped a general idea of the situation in the mansion.Since I\u2019m already here, I should take one step and look around before taking another,\u00a0he sighed inwardly.The palanquin trip lasted for about a quarter of an hour before stopping in front of a courtyard.A red lantern was hung at the entrance of the courtyard, and under the light, there was firecracker debris all over the place.Through the courtyard door, a palanquin could be seen parked in front of the main house. Many servants were waiting in front of the gate, and when they saw Jiang Suizhou coming, they knelt and bowed.Jiang Suizhou was not quite used to the sight of people worshipping him, so he raised his hand and let them all rise.An old granny who looked to be the matchmaker 2 stepped forward in welcome and smilingly said to Jiang Suizhou, \u201cCongratulations, Your Highness. The lady is already waiting in the room, just waiting for you to lift her veil.\u201dJiang Suizhou responded.He knew the customs of Jing Dynasty. The ceremony of taking a concubine was much simpler than taking a wife. The moment the bridal sedan chair was carried into the house through the side door, the husband would lift her veil and drink the nuptial wine, and then it was done.He nodded and walked past the crowd to the main house.His pace was smooth and slow, and his clothes fluttered as he walked. He gave off a cold and calm atmosphere with quite a superior bearing.Only Jiang Suizhou knew how panicked he was at this moment.After all, he transmigrated into the Jing dynasty in a daze, becoming an invalid who would die soon. At present, he also had to go to the nuptial chamber and face the poor lady who was forced to marry Jingwang.She was pitiful, but he was not much better.With this in mind, he climbed up the steps at a seemingly smooth but heavy pace and pushed the door open.Inside the door, the red canopy fluttered, and the wedding candles flickered. The maids on either side smiled radiantly and bowed to him as they chorused their congratulations.Someone guided him into the inner room.In the midst of a charming scene, he saw the man sitting upright in the chamber.He was dressed in layers upon layers of red, his head topped with a veil embroidered with a phoenix and affixed with an ornament. He was sitting upright in a wheelchair, with his shoulders straight, like an unbreakable spear.Yes, a spear.This man was tall, had broad shoulders, and a pair of long legs that hardly fit in the wheelchair. He was, unmistakably, a man!A man. A disabled man. A man who married Jingwang.\u2026This \u201cMadam Huo\u201d that I married, don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s Huo Wujiu!Jiang Suizhou stopped in his tracks.His gaze fell on the hands that the person placed on his knees.The bones of his fingers were distinct, with bulging veins on the back of his hands. Although they were only quietly resting on his knee, they exuded a murderous aura, as if they could snap a person\u2019s neck at any time.For some reason, Jiang Suizhou recalled a fragment from his student\u2019s paper.\u201c\u2026After Huo Wujiu, Marquis of Dingbei, was captured, the Hou Zhu\u00a0of Southern Jing damaged his meridians, maimed his legs, and married him to Jingwang, who was known for his identity as a cutsleeve, to humiliate him. He endured humiliation in Jingwang\u2019s residence for three years and then managed to escape back to Northern Liang to heal his legs.After that, in order to avenge those days, he personally beheaded Jingwang after he wiped out the Jing Dynasty and hung his head on the city gates for three years.It was for this reason that Jingwang was not mentioned in historical records. Even his name was erased.\u201dJiang Suizhou\u2019s hands shook a little.If he was Huo Wujiu\u2026if he was indeed Huo Wujiu\u2026.Then three years later, the one who Huo Wujiu would behead wouldn\u2019t be that Jingwang, but him, Jiang Suizhou.He stared at the man in the wedding dress in front of him, trying to find any trace from him to prove that he was not a man.But, nothing.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s mind went blank.\u201cYour Highness? Your Highness!\u201dMeng Qianshan, who was following, saw him stop in place with a cold expression. He couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking, so he quickly whispered to nudge him.Jiang Suizhou turned his head sideways.He saw Meng Qianshan standing beside him, carefully whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s time to lift the veil.\u201dRight, lift the veil.Before seeing the face, who could guarantee that he was Huo Wujiu?Jiang Suizhou walked forward, comforting himself inwardly while forcing himself to calmly stretch out his hand and uncover the flimsy veil.The red candles flickered.In the midst of the gorgeous red, he met a pair of intense black and ruthlessly cold eyes.Footnotes:1.

    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Suizhou stepped back involuntarily as the red veil floated down to the ground.He felt his heart beating rapidly with shock, and even the blood in his ears surged in the wake of it.\u2026Just a mere glance.His eyebrows are sharply shaped and low set, so his eyes appear especially cold and hostile, with a splash of undisguised bloodthirstiness and ruthlessness.In the midst of his panic, Jiang Suizhou seemed to be looking at a dying beast. Although he was prostrate in front of him, he could pounce on him at any time, bite his throat and die with him.A bloody smell mixed with the sweet fragrance of the red candles wafted in the air, a little bit like the putrid and cold smell of a cell.Now, he knew who this person was without asking.\u2026Wasn\u2019t he the famous God of War of Great Liang, who was crippled by the Hou Zhu of Southern Jing, who would chop his head off and hang it out to dry on the city walls three years later?Jiang Suizhou pursed his lips and suddenly wanted to apologize to that student of his.Let him go, please. He wanted to leave.Jiang Suizhou stalled in place, while Meng Qianshan who was beside him was about to go crazy with trepidation.What was His Highness doing?! He lifted the veil, but threw it away.\u00a0At this point, Jiang Suizhou did not utter a single word and stared at Huo Wujiu coldly.Meng Qianshan cautiously glanced at Huo Wujiu.He once only heard that the only son of Marquis Dingbei was a young hero rarely seen in the world. Right now, it seemed that the rumors were true. The emperor caught him back and locked him in the imperial dungeon. Those who were locked in there usually did not survive more than three days before being tortured to death.Yet this Madam Huo survived inside for more than a month.His lips were abnormally white, and bruises adorned the corners of his lips, along with some dried bloodstains. Not to mention, he was indeed good-looking. He had deep set facial features, exuding aggressiveness. He was the image of a strategic general. Even with injuries, he didn\u2019t look pitiful, but rather conveyed a sense of decadence and fragility.A visible scar peeked out from a dip in the neckline of the wedding robe. Its muted shade of dark red wasn\u2019t easily discernible against the crimson robes he was wearing.He decided to take the risk to conclude the ceremony.With this in mind, Meng Qianshan carefully bowed in respect and brought Jiang Suizhou the nuptial wine.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d He bowed beside Jiang Suizhou.When Jiang Suizhou glanced sideways, he saw that the tray held in Meng Qianshan\u2019s hand had two golden cups with wine in it.He did need to get over his shock.So, he picked up one of the cups, tilted his head, and drank the wine in the cup clean.Meng Qianshan\u2019s eyes almost popped out.\u2026Your Highness! That\u2019s the nuptial wine, the nuptial wine!Meng Qianshan looked at Jiang Suizhou and then at Huo Wujiu in panic.One looked as indifferent as a statue, and the other was cold and arrogant as Yanwang. They stuffed the words that were pouring out of his mouth back into his throat.At that moment, he saw his master turn around and put the golden cup back into the tray.\u201cWithdraw,\u201d he ordered.Meng Qianshan froze. \u201cUh, Master\u2026\u201dHe saw his master glance at him lightly, and the flickering candle light illuminated the small mole at the corner of his eye.\u201cAll of you, withdraw.\u201d\u2014\u2014After the cup of wine was downed, Jiang Suizhou finally calmed down.By now, he was all but certain that he had become that unfortunate Jingwang who had married Huo Wujiu in the unofficial historical records described in that student\u2019s paper.After he was sure of this fact, he calmed down a bit.All in all, this person he suddenly became would die early no matter what. Being killed by Huo Wujiu, on the contrary, was a good thing for him.After all, an illness was uncontrollable, but relationships between people could be mended.Huo Wujiu was also regarded as an illustrious figure in history. He defeated the world, but his uncle went to sit on the throne. After his uncle died, it was also his uncle\u2019s son who inherited the throne. On the other hand, Huo Wujiu led his troops back to Yangguan alone and remained there for life.He believed that if he didn\u2019t humiliate such a righteous man and respected him a bit, Huo Wujiu definitely wouldn\u2019t kill him three years later.It was just\u2026He looked at Huo Wujiu.His identity at present was that of Southern Jing\u2019s prince, and the Huo Wujiu in front of him was an enemy, a traitor.If he stepped forward and deliberately expressed goodwill, it would certainly attract suspicion, which would be counterproductive.So\u2026Jiang Suizhou slowly took a breath and spoke coldly.\u201cYou reek of blood; it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said with a sneer.Although his childhood wasn\u2019t happy, his upbringing was quite strict, so he grew up courteous and polite. He had never uttered such words to anyone.Thus, he sounded strangely awkward and lacking in confidence.Fortunately, his voice was cold and carried a dab of condescending arrogance, so he barely covered it up and bluffed his way through.Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t take up the thread of the conversation.He looked down and faintly glanced at the red veil that fell to the ground.He was exceedingly indifferent, with an innate pride. He was obviously at anyone\u2019s disposal, but he was so awe-inspiring that he deterred anyone from taking a single step forward.Jiang Suizhou pulled himself together and then said, \u201cThey sent you to benwang\u00a0right after dragging you out of prison? Does my Emperor brother really think that benwang has no preferences and can swallow anything in my mouth?\u201dHe tried his best to be harsh but after these cutting words left his mouth, he felt a shiver down his spine from the unease.Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze moved away from the red veil on the ground and swept lightly over Jiang Suizhou.He saw the man standing in the light, his back straight, his gaze sullen and cold. His pair of fox eyes with upturned tails were brimming under the red candles, and his red attire set off the small red mole at the tip of his eye, making him even more enchanting.His tone was quite fierce, awkwardly fierce, even with a dash of regret and shame, as if he had never been mean before.He has fought with Southern Jing many times, so naturally he has also heard of His Highness Jingwang\u2019s name.He was an invalid, born from a concubine who devastated the country. He was filled with evil tricks and was in no way a person of good character.Jingwang had a long-standing reputation for being a sinister and vicious man. As early as when he was twelve or thirteen years old and still a young prince, there were always corpses being dragged out of his palace, and their cadavers were totally ghastly. Once he was suddenly enlightened as a cutsleeve, a lot of the male pets he gathered in his backyard died for his entertainment, and there weren\u2019t many left alive now.But now it seemed\u2026those were exaggerations.Meanwhile, Jiang Suizhou was only concentrating on deliberating his words, and did not notice Huo Wujiu\u2019s fleeting gaze.He paused and then said, \u201cI\u2019ll find a physician to examine you tomorrow. If you\u2019re going to die, do not die in my place.\u201d After saying that, he turned around and added, \u201cThereafter, stay here honestly and give benwang less trouble.\u201dAfter speaking, Jiang Suizhou secretly sighed in relief.\u2026That should have been mean enough, right?Not only must he retain the ferocity to the enemy and not really hurt him, he must also find excuses to heal his injuries.It was so difficult.Naturally, he was thinking of treating Huo Wujiu\u2019s injuries tonight.After all, he had only just come out of prison, and Hou Zhu would never extend him medical treatment. Skin trauma wasn\u2019t fatal, but it was unwise to delay treatment. Moreover, Jiang Suizhou, as a modern man who had never seen any bloody scenes, was a bit frightened even by the smell of Huo Wujiu\u2019s blood.But he knew that was out of the question.As the only prince in the dynasty, he was still not sure what kind of people were in his manor. It was for this reason that he ordered everyone to retreat just now.It was naturally unreasonable for him to rush to treat the enemy\u2019s injuries as soon as he was sent in. But if they have spent the night alone, it would be reasonable enough to request a physician for him tomorrow.So\u2026Jiang Suizhou looked around without leaving a trace.This was a chamber specially used for wedding events. Except for the red lacquered bed with gold edges, there was only a narrow couch left for people to lie on.There was no other place to sleep.The couch was delicate and unique, with carved corners and a total width of no more than two handspans. It was more like an ornament than a piece of furniture.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes showed a sense of resignation.He knew that he could only spend the night on this couch tonight.Before lifting his steps, he did not forget to turn around and give Huo Wujiu a cold look.\u201cGo and lie on the bed. Stay away from me, and don\u2019t taint me with your bloody smell,\u201d he said.Unbeknownst to him, his condescending and arrogant countenance, coupled with his overly delicate face, made him appear more or less seductive beneath the flickering red candlelights.After speaking, Jiang Suizhou turned around and went straight to the couch and laid down.He had to make do with it all night.He faced the wall and didn\u2019t notice that after he laid down, Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze fell onto his back.His cold scrutiny was as icy as a blade buried in the snow and ice of Yangguan.A moment later, Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze and lowered his eyes. His left hand, which had been resting on his knee, slowly turned over, then he unfurled his palm.That hand was stained with fresh blood. Under the swaying light of the red candles, he held a wood chip as sharp as a blade in the palm of his head.It was something he broke off from the inner wall of the palanquin on the way here.Originally, the wood chip should have been used to slash Jingwang\u2019s throat at an opportune moment earlier on.But\u2026He glanced faintly at Jiang Suizhou\u2019s back.Just now, at the moment he was about to make a move to kill him, he met those eyes.Bright, clean, yet totally flustered, as if he was scared of him.Huo Wujiu closed his eyes.He had clenched the wooden chip tightly in his palm, but at that moment, he made no move.He seemed to have never had a penchant for bullying the weak.After a few moments, he slowly opened his eyes. He placed both hands on the sides of the wheelchair, and with a little force, moved himself from the wheelchair to the bed.Pain erupted all over his body, causing his muscles to tremble uncontrollably. He was not aware of it at all. With a slight movement of his hand, he hid the bloodstained wood chip under the bed, concealing the sound amidst the rustling of his garments from when he transferred himself to the bed.His gaze swept over Jiang Suizhou and saw that he was lying uncomfortably. His back was stiff, as if forcing himself to sleep.\u2026Tch.Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze smoothly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not only was it painful to look at, it was even more painful to lie on. He could only turn on his side with a thin cloak that was barely a quilt draped over him.This sickly body was so delicate that it was beyond his expectation.The narrow couch made his back sore, and despite it being springtime, his hands and feet were freezing cold.He tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep until the red candles burned out in the room and the sky outside the window grew brighter.By the time he sat up early in the morning, he was so sore that his body felt like it was falling apart. His throat was a little itchy, giving him the urge to cough.He coughed twice softly in an attempt to suppress the sound and rubbed at his temples dizzily.Outside the window, there were already many maids waiting on the porch. Jiang Suizhou looked up and saw Meng Qianshan standing in the doorway with his hand in his sleeves. Presumably, he was waiting for him to wake up before entering to serve him.He couldn\u2019t let him in. Once he entered, wouldn\u2019t the fact that he and Huo Wujiu were not in bed together be exposed?Jiang Suizhou immediately came to a decision in his heart.Gotta run, and run fast.He glanced at Huo Wujiu.There was an empty wheelchair on the other side of the bed, and Huo Wujiu was lying motionless on his side, facing him.The window allowed in some light, shining on his face. His raven feather-like eyelashes cast a shadow over his cheeks.He was indeed very good looking.His facial contours were sharp, and his features were deep. His nose was straight, and with his eyes closed, his long lashes hid that pair of ruthless, menacing, black eyes. His heroic spirit seemed to be displayed ostentatiously.With the help of the sunlight, Jiang Suizhou saw a tiny old scar that abruptly cut off the edge of his left eyebrow.It was akin to a scratch on a divine weapon, causing it to fall into mortal dust, tainted with drops of blood.He was sleeping soundly.Jiang Suizhou breathed a sigh of relief and carefully got up from the couch.It would be best if Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t wake up yet.After all, he\u2019d been so harsh last night before hiding to the side to sleep for the night. It was now dawn. For him to run away with his tail between his legs now was a bit humiliating no matter how one looked at it.This kind of embarrassing thing was better done without anyone knowing.With this in mind, Jiang Suizhou straightened his robe and stood upright. His posture seemed candid, but in reality, walked out cautiously.With the sound of footsteps drifting away, the door opened with a sound, and then closed again.The only subtle sound in the room also disappeared, leaving nothing but an empty silence.Huo Wujiu opened his eyes.Those gloomy eyes were awake and sharp and hardly looked like he had just woken up.His eyes landed coldly on the couch under the window.Daylight from the open window fell onto it, and dust particles fluttered in the light.The couch was empty.What was more, it was carefully tidied up. Just by looking at the folds that were clumsily smoothed out, he could still make out the effort the person took to cover up the traces of his sleep.Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze paused.He has always been highly vigilant and has a keen sense of hearing and vision. Therefore, King Jing\u2019s every move last night had not escaped his eyes.Huo Wujiu watched as he squeezed down on the couch and listened to him toss and turn all night long, believing that he was moving noiselessly.Seconds ago, Huo Wujiu listened to him as he tiptoed outside like a thief.\u2026It was unbelievable.Before he came here, Huo Wujiu envisioned what he might face in King Jing\u2019s residence. King Jing was a vicious and insidious person, cunning and vindictive; plus, he was originally at odds with Emperor Jing. Emperor Jing seemed to be rewarding him, but in reality, he was using Huo Wujiu to humiliate King Jing, so it was impossible for King Jing not to hate him.His situation would only be more tortuous than in the imperial prison.But King Jing did not do anything and, instead, avoided him, as if he were utterly terrifying.Huo Wujiu involuntarily lowered his eyelashes, and his gaze fell on his legs.The people of South Jing were indeed terrified of him.\u00a0 It was due to this fear that his meridians were damaged and his legs crippled.Even though he had become a cripple who couldn\u2019t stand up, they were still afraid. Take yesterday as an example. It was just a matter of taking him out of prison, but the majority of the imperial guards were dispatched, and the streets along the road were strictly cordoned off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only when he reached the point where he was within a step from death\u2019s door would they be relieved.They were also right to do so. After all, as long as he still had a breath in him, then he, Huo Wujiu, would never sit around and wait for death.But this Jingwang\u2026Huo Wujiu frowned.He had never seen anyone like Jingwang. Jingwang was clearly afraid of him, and he had plenty of ways to dispose of him, and yet, he did nothing.Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t believe in the slightest that Jingwang was purely benevolent, but it seemed that he didn\u2019t need to act on him yet.Huo Wujiu closed his eyes.He worked out a lot of the traps of his opponent as early as in the prison, preparing himself to defend against them. He knew there was bound to be a change, but he never thought\u2026The change he encountered was Jingwang himself.\u2014\u2014Meng Qianshan, who was waiting at the door, was startled when he saw Jiang Suizhou pushing the door open by himself.He looked at the sky and hurriedly greeted him saying, \u201cMaster, there\u2019s still more than an hour before the grand court assembly. Why don\u2019t you rest a bit more?\u201dJiang Suizhou closed the door.Grand Court Assembly? He knew that the Jing Dynasty didn\u2019t practice a daily morning court session, but rather had one court session every five days, which was called the Grand Court Assembly.It came as a surprise that the day after he came here, he would come across it.He nodded his head and spoke gently, his voice a bit quiet, \u201cI woke up early. It\u2019s nothing.\u201dMeng Qianshan hastily answered, turned his head and ordered the servants to go to the King\u2019s courtyard to prepare the meal, while he himself helped lead Jiang Suizhou out of the courtyard.Jiang Suizhou hadn\u2019t slept all night and was now dizzy and lightheaded, so he didn\u2019t refuse and let Meng Qianshan help him.Meng Qianshan carefully inspected him with a glance as they walked.\u2026Oh boy!Dark blue eye bags, waxen face, unsteady gait; there was also a hidden exhaustion in the eyes.Err\u2026The Prince had quite an intense night, didn\u2019t he?Meng Qianshan took a look, then cautiously withdrew his gaze. But he couldn\u2019t control himself, and looked back a second and third time.He peeked too frequently that even Jiang Suizhou took notice.Just as Jiang Suizhou boarded the palanquin parked at the gate of the courtyard, he found Meng Qianshan sneaking a peek at him again.Jiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t help but frown and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dMeng Qianshan quickly withdrew his gaze and replied with a smile, \u201cNothing, nothing. I just wanted to ask Your Highness if there was anything you wanted to eat this morning.\u201dJiang Suizhou shook his head. \u201cFeel free to prepare whatever you wish.\u201dMeng Qianshan promptly responded, commanded the servants to carry the palanquin, and went in the direction of Anyin Hall.Jiang Suizhou pondered for a moment and asked, \u201cMeng Qingshan, have the arrangements been made for the courtyard where Huo Wuj\u2026Madam Huo is moving to?\u201dAlthough his head was spinning, he still remembered his plans last night. The place where they slept last night was the ceremonial chamber used for wedding events in the royal residence. Today, Huo Wujiu was to move into his residence.Since Jiang Suizhou had made up his mind not to provoke him, then Huo Wujiu must not be mistreated and lack these basic necessities.Meng Qianshan was dumbfounded.What? When did His Highness ask about such trivial matters in the residence?Jiang Suizhou heard no response for a while, and when he turned his head sideways, he saw Meng Qianshan staring at him dumbfounded.\u201cMeng Qianshan,\u201d he prompted.Meng Qingshan answered, \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry. I arranged it ages ago!\u201dJiang Suizhou paused and then said, \u201cHe seems to be badly injured. Ask someone to examine him later.\u201dGood lord, I can\u2019t believe I have to find a doctor for someone else.Meng Qianshan nodded repeatedly, \u201cI\u2019ll go find a doctor later to take a look at Madam Huo.\u201dJiang Suizhou grunted and said, \u201cServe him snacks.\u201dAfter saying that, he withdrew his gaze, closed his eyes and supported his head with one arm as he took a nap.He did not notice that Meng Qianshan, who was following beside him, had long been stunned silly by his command.He was already screaming deep inside.He was sent to serve the Prince since he was ten years old and had been with him for many years, but when had he ever seen him ask after these matters?!It was not that there were no other ladies in the mansion, but even if they were favored, he had never seen such care for them from his master!He did not forget that when the Prince arrived last night, he was as cold as frost with anger. He threw the veil down and drank the wedding cup alone yesterday. Just looking into his eyes sent cold sweat down Meng Qianahan\u2019s spine.But in just one night, h-he actually began to care about the Madam inside!What else could let people change their attitude so quickly? He knew these things even if he was just a eunuch.But come to think of it\u2026The Prince\u2019s appearance of overindulgence and excessive lust today showed him a glimpse or two of the methods used by the Madam inside.Thinking of this, Meng Qianshan couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Unexpectedly\u2026unexpectedly, that cripple had such skills!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 5.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Jiang Suizhou and his party left, the courtyard became completely silent.Huo Wujiu sat up, pulled the wheelchair closer, propped himself up on the edge of the bed and moved himself into the wheelchair with a little effort.He quietly gathered his hair, tied it up sharply behind his head, and looked out the window.It was dawn.He has always been very adaptable. When he was in Yangguan in the past, he was very tolerant of the airborne dust and sand in the north and could ride his horse on the Gobi desert to his heart\u2019s content; he stayed there until his father raised his army. He also adapted quickly to the successive years of war and learned how to climb out of the mountain of corpses and blood, lead his subordinates and be a sufficiently qualified general.Now, he also learned how to live with a pair of legs that had lost all functions in a very short time, and how to fight when alone in the enemy camp.The sun gradually rose outside the window, and the light fell through the window onto the ground. With the rising sun, the rays advanced little by little toward Huo Wujiu.When that light was about to envelop the edge of his wheelchair, a knock sounded at the door.Huo Wujiu looked in the direction of the door, and his gaze sank without a trace.He knew that if he wanted any answers, now was a good opportunity.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou was unaware that Meng Qianshan had secretly drafted some nasty thoughts behind his back. He closed his eyes, but wasn\u2019t very sleepy, so he contemplated the grand court session later.At the Grand Court Assembly, not only did the hundred officials pay their respects, but they also had to discuss official business in the court. But\u2026But considering the South Jing Emperor\u2019s professional level as recorded in history books, he reckoned they wouldn\u2019t be able to discuss any business matters in the courtroom.What worried Jiang Suizhou was his identity.After all, the King Jing he had become now had scarcely any records in literature, not even a few words in total.He was the only surviving younger brother of the emperor, the sickly man who died an untimely death. To add to that, he was also gay.It was practically blank. So, he had no idea what his current position was, much less what kind of people the original owner knew, what kind of friendships he had, and how to deal with them.What was more worrying was that he married the infamous General Huo only yesterday. Hence, he was sure to become the target of criticism today.Facts proved that his fears were spot on.He wondered if there was a way to solve his official post. All in all, once Jiang Suizhou changed into his official robe, he realized what his official rank was; when Meng Qianshan brought him the ivory court tablet, he knew where he should stand when he was in the court later.The major he studied was unduly fitting, giving him more or less an advantage in this matter of crossing.However, his major didn\u2019t teach him how to face various strange glances from civil and military officials.From the moment he got off the palanquin and entered the Kaiyang Gate, many of the officials nearby were given a start, and countless eyes looked him up and down non-stop. One or two people looking at him was just fine, but almost everyone looked at him a few times. Thus, it was inevitable for Jiang Suizhou to be on the tenterhooks.Those gazes were a mixture of Schadenfreude, abhorrence and disdain, and also grief. Some wanted to speak but then hesitated.A bold official even went to Jiang Suizhou\u2019s side, bumped him with his shoulder and said with a smile, \u201cYour Highness must have been exhausted last night. When it comes to luck with romance, you are indeed blessed!\u201dFrom his official uniform, he wasn\u2019t a high-ranking official from the third rank.Although he wasn\u2019t in a high official position and was only idly working in the Ministry of Rites, he was also a first-rate prince. If he dared to drip acid with sarcasm on him,\u00a0 there must be someone backing him up.The treacherous minister, Pang Shao, who was well-known in history books, was in this dynasty.Jiang Suizhou gave him a casual look, but made no response.His cold and arrogant eyes have always been a strong deterrent, so with a touch of warning in them, he immediately rendered the official frightened and stunned. The wretched smile on his face, which was a bit of schadenfreude and improper intimacy, was also put away awkwardly.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze from him, speeded up his pace, and walked away from him.His appearance somewhat deterred some people and made the second half of his journey to the imperial court much smoother.It also spared him some energy to scrutinize some things on the side.Before the Jing Dynasty fled south, the capital of the country was in Yecheng. Three years ago, Huo Wujiu led the Liang army and invaded the capital. The previous emperor, Emperor Jing Ling, fled south in haste with his family and numerous officials and died on the way. The present ruler, Jiang Shunheng, hastily fled to Yuhang and changed his name to Lin\u2019an, which became the new capital of the country.At present, it has only been three years since the capital was established here, and the palace has been hastily built up.The palace was roughly built, and the blueprint was also a mess. It took a glance to see the result of the rushed work. According to historical records, after the emperor fled to Lin\u2019an, he insisted that wouldn\u2019t be emperor without a royal palace, which forced South Jing to build the Imperial City in a hurry within half a year.Rough as it was, the cost was, by no means, paltry. Along the way, it seemed that the whole imperial city was resplendent and decidedly extravagant. At first glance, a large sum of gold and silver was spent.Jiang Suizhou could not help but sigh in his heart.There was no bias in the historical records of the preposterous deeds of the Emperor of South Jing.He walked up the long white marble steps in front of Guangyuan Hall and saw that many courtiers were already standing inside. Because they studied historical materials in the school, everything was fine and detailed, so Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t have much trouble finding his position and stood there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 5.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe one standing in front of him was an old minister around his 50s or 60s. A look at his court uniform told him that he was second-ranked, a whole rank higher than Jiang Suizhou.When he saw Jiang Suizhou coming, the old minister turned his head and nodded at him, as a greeting.\u201cYour Highness King Jing has come early today,\u201d he said with a light smile.As he turned around, Jiang Suizhou read the writing on his court tablet.Minister of Rites, Ji You; he was Jiang Suizhou\u2019s immediate boss.He was detached and amicable, so he was probably not close to King Jing. Jiang Suizhou smiled in response, also nodded at him and greeted him good morning.Ji You glanced around and found that the surroundings were quiet. There wasn\u2019t anyone nearby, so he whispered, \u201cYour Highness has suffered from an injustice. Just bear it, and it will pass.\u201dAfter saying that, he nodded at Jiang Suizhou with goodwill and then turned around once more.Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t quite understand his meaning, so he responded and ended the conversation with him.\u2026However, he soon understood what Ji You meant.When the hour arrived, the morning sun jumped on the glorious golden glazed roof, the drums sounded outside the Zhengyang Hall, followed by the eunuchs singing loudly.History\u2019s most famous fatuous and self-indulgent ruler, South Jing\u2019s Emperor, Emperor Jing You, His Majesty Jiang Shunheng, has arrived.In the thousands of years of history, there were few who could be dubbed \u201cYou\u201d by posterity. After all, most emperors rendered great service. It was ultimately rare to have muddle-headed ones whom the later generations would take their posthumous titles to point at their noises and ridicule.Jiang Shunheng and his father, whose posthumous title was \u201cLing\u201d, accounted for two.Jiang Suizhou followed the civil and military officials with the salute, then looked up to the throne.He only saw a puffy fat man in his thirties sitting in the middle of the throne. He was wrapped in a twelve-chapter pattern black imperial robe. He was sitting crookedly, and hangings on top of his head swayed to and fro, tinkling loudly.Before Jiang Suizhou could take a closer look, he locked eyes with the latter.The fat man\u2019s small eyes patrolled the courtiers, then precisely found Jiang Suizhou. All at once, he revealed a look that harbored evil designs, yet with an extremely joyful glow.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart thumped.As expected, the next moment, the Emperor of Jing spoke.\u201cFifth brother, I gave you that beautiful concubine, did you enjoy him well last night?\u201dHe asked in a deliberately ambiguous measured cadence, and half of the court ministers laughed along with him. The original solemn atmosphere of the court hall suddenly became ludicrous.Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth.The five-day dynasty will not be used to deliberate, was wrecked into this way, not blame the history books scold you faint king, not blame you Jing dynasty died.The Great Court Assembly held once every five days was not used for discussion, but was wrecked into this state. He shouldn\u2019t blame history books for calling him a fatuous and self-indulgent ruler, or the fall of the Jing Dynasty under his rule.However, from that sentence, Jiang Suizhou pinpointed a different undertone.The Emperor of Jing arrived, harboring evil intentions, and the courtiers either followed suit, or looked unsightly and kept their mouths shut. It was obvious that the original owner wasn\u2019t popular in the court. The matter of the emperor giving him a concubine was also killing two birds with one stone, humiliating him on both.Hence, he naturally couldn\u2019t show happiness.With this thought, Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth and showed a humiliated look, as if reluctant to mention yesterday\u2019s incident. \u201cThis younger brother thanks Brother Emperor for your reward.\u201dThe Emperor of Jing laughed uproariously.\u201cNo thanks, no thanks! Hey, I heard that yesterday, you did not come out of his room all night?\u201d He said.Jiang Suizhou, \u201c\u2026\u201dThis fatuous emperor hasn\u2019t had enough yet.As expected, there were indeed spies of the latter in his house. Moreover, the latter also did not hide it in the slightest and said so openly.\u2026In all likelihood, it isn\u2019t that this fatuous ruler is frank and righteous, but is indeed dim-witted.Jiang Suizhou slandered silently, but his expression matched his words, with traces of embarrassment.When the latter saw his appearance, he really became more excited.\u201cWhen you got up early in the morning, did you call for a doctor? Fifth Brother, you should take care of your health. You were born with this ailment, so how can you stand the torment?\u201dAfter speaking, he also greeted a certain official in the front row, \u201cUncle, did you see? My fifth brother\u2019s face is so white that I can see the dark circles under his eyes from afar! Last night, there must have been a lot of tossing and turning. Hahahahaha!\u201dHearing this title, the minister he addressed was definitely Pang Shao.Pang Shao was the brother of Empress Dowager Pang, and he has the official rank of Grand Minister over the Masses. According to historical records, he was restrained in the previous dynasty. After Jiang Shunheng ascended to the throne, he revealed his true form and only focused on seizing power by hoarding money. For Jiang Shunheng, he was a connivance. For Jiang Shunheng, it was all but connivance and flattery.Therefore, the empress also liked this uncle very much.Seriously, upon hearing the Emperor of Jing\u2019s words, a low, muffled laughter came from the front row of officials. There was no comment, nor the slightest intention of admonishing him to restrain himself.Jiang Suizhou even heard dashes of pleasure in his laughter.It immediately became clear to him.It turned out that not only did he have an ancestor who was going to kill him sooner or later, but he was also in a tight spot in the court.No matter how bitter Jiang Suizhou was deep inside, he no longer wanted to dwell on it.He stood there and listened indifferently to the emperor\u2019s wanton mocking and sarcasm, responding now and then. The more he talked, the more excited he became. It was obvious that he had exhausted his pitiful brain to come up with this wonderful marriage, waiting for this day.Jiang Suizhou was too lazy to retort and let him kick up a fuss.Just then, there were a few faint, throat-clearing sounds coming from the front row of officials. The Emperor paused and immediately looked in that direction.Then, he immediately showed a look of understanding and laughed out loud some more.\u201cFifth Brother, I have thought about it yesterday,\u201d he said.Jiang Suizhou raised his head and saw him narrowing those small eyes and smiling maliciously at him.\u201cThe father of that Madam Huo in your house, wasn\u2019t he the Marquis of Dingbei Marquis of our Great Jing back then? After all the ups and downs, we\u2019ve become a family again. Our Great Jing is also considered Madam Huo\u2019s maternal family,\u201d he said.\u201cIn that case, the rule of visiting the bride\u2019s home after three days can not be abolished. I\u2019ve decided. After three days, bring Madam Huo to the palace to return to his maternal home. What do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were already at odds and ends, so how could he claim that they were Huo Wujiu\u2019s family?He said it was returning to the bride\u2019s home, but his unabashed tone clearly showed his desire to find an excuse to taunt and humiliate Huo Wujiu.With his knowledge of thousands of years of history, Jiang Suizhou also had some understanding of this fatuous ruler.The Hou Zhu, as stupid as he was, certainly couldn\u2019t have come up with this humiliating trick to force Huo Wujiu back to his maternal home.Jiang Suizhou caught the look shared between the Emperor and Pang Shao.Nine out of ten, it was Pang Shao who was in cahoots with the Hou Zhu. The latter wanted to take Huo Wujiu out, and Pang Shao wanted to please him, so Pang Shao must have come up with this idea for him.The two of them hit it off immediately. They would each happily obtain their desires. He, on the other hand, would end up suffering.Regardless of who wanted to humiliate Huo Wujiu, in Huo Wujiu\u2019s perspective, he, Jiang Suizhou, and they were jackals of the same lair.Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t want to drive someone to their death. He could turn a blind eye to it, but he didn\u2019t want to use his own head as a bargaining chip.Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth.He had to refuse for Huo Wujiu, and he had to come up with a sound reason.He paused, and his exquisite, almost lush face showed tinges of revulsion and embarrassment.\u201cBrother Emperor, that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d He lowered his eyes, his slender eyelashes blocking the emotions in his eyes and aptly posing a gesture of refusal. \u201cA cripple is hardly presentable and would only provoke Brother Emperor\u2019s disgust.\u201dHe spoke slowly, exhibiting his disgust between the lines.Jiang Suizhou wove his words beautifully, and each word was seemingly in consideration for the latter. However, the people around him knew when they heard him that he himself was disgraced in saying these words.Of course, he was also a Prince of the country. The mere thought of entering the palace with a prisoner of war \u201cto return to the bridal home\u201d was too funny and too humiliating.Many courtiers had a look of schadenfreude on their faces.And when the Emperor heard this, he became even more spirited.\u201cWhat? Are you unwilling to bring him out? Fifth Brother, you\u2019ve only been with him in the bridal chamber last night. How come you are so heartless today?\u201dWhen Jiang Suizhou heard his loony tone, he was inevitably disgusted, but he had to continue acting.He paused, as if totally embarrassed that he had been intimate with the other party. After a while, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cBrother Emperor, this is different.\u201dThe Hou Zhu dissolved into laughter, and a cheerful atmosphere permeated the entire courtroom.Pang Shao cleared his throat again.The Hou Zhu glanced at him and saw Pang Shao winking at him from below, reminding him of the plan.Long before the court session, his uncle told him that he could severely humiliate Jiang Suizhou by proposing to let Huo Wujiu return to his maternal home. That idea was fine. However, it was paramount to use this matter as a bargaining chip in exchange for the goodies in Jiang Suizhou\u2019s hands.Although he was not interested in whatever good things Jiang Suizhou had in his hands, he was ultimately delighted in the act of snatching things away from him.Even if he was now no longer the poor First Prince who was ignored by his father and could only watch how loved Jiang Suizhou was, even if he was now the Emperor, his hobbies remained unchanged.He cleared his throat, shifted into a more comfortable sitting position, raised his leg and stepped on the throne floor cushion.\u201cAll right, since Fifth Brother is reluctant and wants to hide your wife in a golden house, I will not force you.\u201d He stretched his voice and smiled. \u201cBut then, since you want to hide your beauty, you\u2019ve got to give something in exchange. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dJiang Suizhou frowned.Sure enough, he had guessed right. Pang Shao was behind the Hou Zhu\u2019s evil tricks. Since he had made the Hou Zhu happy, Pang Shao naturally wouldn\u2019t be without payment. If the Hou Zhu didn\u2019t plan on giving this remuneration to him, then Pang Shao would obtain it himself.But\u2026He seemed to be merely an idle Prince with an idle post. What was worth their scheming?Jiang Suizhou paused and tentatively answered, \u201cBrother Emperor, please enlighten me.\u201dThe Hou Zhu cleared his throat.\u201cI have thought about it. If I want to build an ancestral hall in the palace, the Ministry of Works should do it, not the Ministry of Rites. It just so happens that Luan Zhaoyi has been begging me these days, wanting her father to come and share your burdens. Fifth Brother, no matter what, we can\u2019t let the beauty be sad, right?\u201dJiang Suizhou\u2019s brow jumped.Oh, I see.During the reign of Emperor Jing You of Southern Jing, the corruption of the court reached its peak when Pang Shao was in power. Officials have been corrupt since ancient times, and construction projects were the easiest way to launder money. The largest ill-gotten fortunes were certainly from the construction of palaces.For this reason, Pang Shao would let the Emperor build a palace whenever he made a fuss about building a new one. In any case, when a palace was built, the money would flow from the national treasury to his own pockets.At present, the renovations of the palace must still be underway, so Pang Shao was coveting this lucrative job. Nevertheless\u2026Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t quite understand how such an obvious piece of fat meat fell into his hands.He did not say anything for a while, his eyes roamed around the assembly room.Some people remained calm and composed as they watched the show, while others were cold-faced and silent. A few officials looked nervous, glancing straight at him.Under the turbulent dark tide, there were clear distinctions, as if there were two factions in the dark.A terrible conjecture suddenly sprouted in Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart.From this situation\u2026It seemed that he also had some hidden power in the court. It was those people who found ways to stuff this errand into his hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he retreated at this juncture, he might harm more than his own interests.But\u2026Firstly, he was in the dark and had no clue about what was going on in the court. He didn\u2019t even know who was under his command. Even if he took over the job, he was afraid there would be trouble.Secondly, the question before him was making him choose between a rock and a hard place. Either give up this hard-earned benefit of Jingwang, offending all his fellow officials, or bring Huo Wujiu into the palace for some humiliation, offending Huo Wujiu.Jiang Suizhou sighed.This was simply grilling him. But in contrast, his life was more important.On top of the throne, the Hou Zhu was still urging him strangely, \u201cFifth Brother, why aren\u2019t you saying anything? The beauty or the cushy job, you have to choose one.\u201dJiang Suizhou raised his eyes, and this time, the revulsion and anger on his face was no longer faked.\u201cAs Brother Emperor said, I shouldn\u2019t overstep my bounds,\u201d Jiang Suizhou opened his mouth and replied unhurriedly.He saw the emperor smile all the more smug.\u2014\u2014The sky brightened, and the trees outside the window swayed about. The sun shone brightly through the thin green branches, spreading mottled shadows onto the smooth dark floor tiles.Dust particles danced silently in the air, making the rays show a bit of yarn-like essence.It was a dazzling tranquility.In the mansion, Doctor Zhou was paralyzed on his knees with his back straight and a thin layer of cold sweat dripped down onto his forehead.He was wide-eyed, and his neck was stiff, not daring to move.Against the pulsating veins in his neck was a sharp, blood-stained wooden chip.The blood was not his, but he could feel how sharp the piece of wood was. It was capable of cutting his throat and killing him instantly.\u201cMadam\u2026General! General! What exactly do you want to ask? Just ask!\u201d He trembled and shivered.A low voice rang out above his head.That was Huo Wujiu in his wheelchair. He sat there, bent over and with one arm lazily resting on his knee. His other hand was holding the blood-stained wooden chip.He held it firmly against Doctor Zhou\u2019s throat.\u201cWhat did he send you here for?\u201d he asked. He tilted his head, eyes downcast and looking down condescendingly at the man kneeling before him.Doctor Zhou shivered and told the truth, \u201cI\u2019m here to treat your injuries on the order of Qianshan-gonggong!\u201dHuo Wujiu said coldly, \u201cTell the truth.\u201dDoctor Zhou was on the verge of tears. \u201cI am telling the truth!\u201dHuo Wujiu coldly looked him up and down for a moment.He didn\u2019t appear to be lying, but that didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of him pretending either.Just now, as soon as this person came and said he was the doctor of the mansion, Huo Wujiu had a conjecture deep inside.The Emperor of Jing was a fool, but Jingwang was not. Jiang Shunheng caught him and only wanted to torture for fun, but Jingwang didn\u2019t have this only purpose.He hadn\u2019t made a move, but he certainly had plans. Jingwang might want to get something from him, maybe the Liang army intelligence, or he might try to use him to fight against Jiang Shunheng.Although his performance yesterday was inconsistent with the rumors, rumors were not groundless.Therefore, if Jingwang wanted to relax his vigilance and control him, the best way was to prescribe medicine to him with the help of doctors.Huo Wujiu looked at the mansion doctor who was shaking like a sieve, his gaze cold and unmoved.\u201cThen open your mouth,\u201d he ordered indifferently.The manor doctor trembled and obeyed.The next moment, a pill suddenly fell into his mouth, and before he could react, his jaw was tightly pinched and jerked upward.The pill fell into his belly.The doctor\u2019s pupils trembled, and immediately, he felt a sharp burning pain that rose up from his stomach.In front of him, the handsome, god-like General slowly and methodically withdrew the wooden chip and sat up with his knees propped up.The bottomless abyss that were his eyes were calm and waveless, akin to the impermanence of hell that tortured lives.He leaned on the backrest of his wheelchair.It was clear that he was sitting in a very simple wooden chair, but his bearing was like sitting on the tiger skin in the Prince\u2019s tent.He lowered his eyes, looked at Doctor Zhou, and said, \u201cThis medicine can corrode the five organs in less than a moment. While I still have the antidote in my hand, tell me. What exactly did they want you to do when they sent you here?\u201dDoctor Zhou cried bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m really not lying to you!\u201d The burning pain in his abdomen had already made him tremble with fear. He was so anxious and scared that he woefully fished over the medical kit he had thrown aside and shivered as he turned it over to Huo Wujiu.\u201cI really have orders to treat your injuries! These are all wound medicines. If you don\u2019t believe me, I can use any of them on myself to prove it to you!\u201dWhile speaking, he hurriedly poured out the stuff in the medical kit and was about to open them one by one for Huo Wujiu to see.Huo Wujiu sized him up quietly.This time, he believed that this man was telling the truth.He was actually sent to treat his wounds?For some reason, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s appearance under the red candles last night flashed before his eyes.There was no doubt that he was like a rabbit who was scared of his own ears atop his head, yet he had to pretend to be vicious.\u2026Besides, he probably didn\u2019t have the guts to even drug him.Huo Wujiu quietly looked at the mansion doctor who was on the ground. A moment later, he took out a vial from his sleeves and threw a dark brown pill at him.\u201cOne lasts for three months. Don\u2019t say a word about today\u2019s affairs. Come back to me for the medicine after three months,\u201d Huo Wujiu said.Doctor Zhou quickly picked up the pill and stuffed it into his mouth.\u201cSince you\u2019re here to treat my injuries, then get up and take a look.\u201dHuo Wujiu said indifferently and glanced down at the small medicine vial in his hand.He only had a total of two medicines on him. When he was imprisoned, the soldier who escorted him was Lou Yue, an old friend of his father, so he stealthily stuffed it in Huo Wujiu belongings during the search, leaving him something to save himself with.One of them could quickly stop bleeding when seriously injured, but after swallowing it, it would cause severe pain in the five organs. However, the pain would disappear after only a moment. The other was to boost qi and enrich blood. It was most useful when trekking long distances in the snow. He glanced at the mansion doctor who wiped his tears and stumbled up from the ground, withdrew his gaze and quietly put the vial back in his sleeves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 7.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPerhaps before today, Doctor Zhou\u2019s understanding of the word \u201cdesperado\u201d was only in the literal sense.But today, he finally understood profoundly what \u201cdesperado\u201d meant.The man on the bed was clearly wounded all over. He was half dead, and his pulse was weak, yet he was still able to ignore it. Huo Wujiu calmly allowed him to remove his rotting flesh and sprinkle a powder on him, and had time to remind him not to try to play tricks and to resist stealing the antidote from him in advance.The Doctor did not dare to tremble as he administered the medicine to him.When he removed his upper robe, the whiplash marks on his tightly muscular body crashed into his eyes. He was tortured so heavily that his flesh was torn to shreds, with new injuries overlapping old ones. Perhaps because the torture devices were dipped in salt water, those wounds almost had no scabs and had the tendency to fester.After over a month of imprisonment, it was obvious from the sight of his body that a day must have crawled by like a year.If these injuries were on someone else, even if they weren\u2019t in immense pain, they must have long been immobilized. Yet just by looking at his face, this man would appear uninjured if he had a robe on.In all of Doctor Zhou\u2019s years of medical practice, he had never seen such a ruthless man.It was said that people who were cruel to themselves would never be soft on others. Therefore, the doctor did not doubt the authenticity of his poisoning and had to resign himself to his fate. From now on, in all likelihood, he would have to follow Huo Wujiu\u2019 orders.The process of applying medicine was quite tedious. Only when Huo Wujiu\u2019s upper body was almost wrapped in gauze did it come to an end.\u201cYour injuries are too severe, and you have already lost qi and blood. Afterward, while your wounds heal, you might develop inflammation or fever, which can be life-threatening in serious cases. I will prescribe a few oral medicines for you. You\u2013\u201cHuo Wujiu, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly spoke and interrupted him.\u201cTake a look at my legs,\u201d he ordered.Manor Doctor Zhou froze at the interruption before realizing what he was talking about.However, before he could react, Huo Wujiu had quietly leaned down, tugging his robe up with one hand and pulling his trouser legs up with the other.It was a pair of long, straight legs that looked full of strength.However, under the scars and blood stains, the horrific wounds on them were bone deep and vividly clear.Those were wounds that cut through flesh and blood and severed the meridians.Doctor Zhou only took a glance, and then averted his eyes in panic\u2014\u2014 His medical skills might be good, but he wasn\u2019t a peerless genius doctor. With just one look, he knew that there was no cure or remedy for such an injury.He looked towards Huo Wujiu, just to see those deep black eyes quietly looking at the wound that exposed his bloody flesh.Huo Wujiu was so calm that he scared Doctor Zhou.\u201cCan I still stand up?\u201d He heard Huo Wujiu ask.Doctor Zhou trembled and deliberated for a moment before carefully replying, \u201cI\u2019d better bandage your legs as well. If the wounds fester, they\u2019ll be difficult to deal with.\u201dHe carefully avoided Huo Wujiu\u2019s question, which was another way of telling him that it was hopeless.Huo Wujiu fell silent.After a moment, he grunted, let go of the fabric clutched in his hand, sat up, and leaned back into the backrest of his wheelchair.Huo Wujiu was extremely quiet.Doctor Zhou did not dare to look at Huo Wujiu\u2019s face again, but as he bowed forward to apply medicine to the latter\u2019s leg, Doctor Zhou saw his hand resting on his knee.The veins in the back of his hand bulged, and his five fingers were tightened, clenching the old wounds on his hand.\u2014\u2014After Jiang Suizhou uttered those words, he distinctly felt the Hou Zhu\u2019s satisfaction.Or rather, what the Hou Zhu was satisfied with wasn\u2019t the words he uttered, but the displeasure that showed on Jiang Suizhou\u2019s face when he replied.His Majesty seemed to be particularly malicious toward Jiang Suizhou, and liked to base his pleasure on the latter\u2019s pain.With Jiang Suizhou\u2019s agreement, the matter naturally came to an end. His Majesty seemed to no longer be interested in the court. Several officials presented memorials, but he listened to them with a lack of interest, then waved his hand and said to let the Grand Minister of the Masses decide.The courtroom seemingly turned into Pang Shao\u2019s turf.Hence, the morning court session did not last long and ended with a yawn of His Majesty.Jiang Suizhou followed the officials out of the Guangyuan Hall and pursed his lips.He really didn\u2019t expect that the purpose of the Hou Zhu\u2019s trip to the court was to taunt and jeer at him.But so far, the Hou Zhu hated Huo Wujiu and, at the same time, didn\u2019t treat Jiang Suizhou any better. Currently, Jiang Suizhou and Huo Wujiu were tethered to a rope, so it could count as saving trouble by letting the Hou Zhu vent his anger.Jiang Suizhou cast his eyes down and descended the stairs step by step.He initially thought he would breathe his last breath, but to his surprise, he was able to walk arduously up till now.Just then, someone passed by him.\u201cI\u2019m really bitterly disappointed with Your Highness\u2019s move!\u201d The voice was old and gloomy.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes, and saw an old minister with white hair two or three feet away, walking toward him .As soon as he turned around, Jiang Suizhou froze.\u2026He\u2019s practically identical to the portraits in history materials!This man was, without a doubt, the only remaining good minister at the end of the Jing Dynasty, the Minister of Ceremonies, Qi Min.This man served as a minister for three generations of the Jing Dynasty. He was honest and upright. He held to his principles and never yielded to pressure. He was a rare courtier who dared to stand up to Pang Shao in court in the late Jing Dynasty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 7.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Suizhou looked at him, somewhat stunned and speechless for a while. Qi Min showed him no mercy, and after a glance at him, he flicked his sleeve and said, \u201cHow can Your Highness give away the efforts of your colleagues in the Ministry of Rites for the sake of your dignity?!\u201dAfter saying that, he stalked off without a backward glance.Jiang Suizhou returned to his senses.\u2026He did not expect that the speculation he deduced in the courtroom just now was actually true.Although Jiang Suizhou seemed to be just an idle prince, those silent ministers in the court imperceptibly regarded him as their backbone. Qi Min\u2019s rebuke totally confirmed his suspicions.Seeing that Qi Min was about to walk away, Jiang Suizhou took two steps to catch up with him and hurriedly spoke.\u201cDoes the Minister of Ceremonies think that I only did that for my own dignity?\u201d he countered solemnly.Having confirmed this, Jiang Suizhou knew that at this moment, he definitely couldn\u2019t stay silent or do nothing.All ministers who joined factions had purposes. They secretly gathered under his command, and even got Qi Min involved in the muddy water. Eight out of ten, their goal was to fight against Pang Shao.Jiang Suizhou still had three years to spend with these people. If he didn\u2019t pacify them, he would die in the court battle before Huo Wujiu could chop his head off.So\u2026What he had to do now was to fool them.Take this Qi Min for example. Although he was a three-dynasty veteran minister and the respected Minister of Ceremonies, in the end, he was only an official in charge of the rituals of the ancestral temples. This kind of high-ranking official, though high in position, had no real power. If he conducted himself upright, he should not have engaged in any power struggle to secure personal gain.People like him were quite scary.Sure enough, Qi Min paused when he heard Jiang Suizhou\u2019s words and slowed down.Seeing this, Jiang Suizhou sneered and put on an unfathomable tone.\u201cThe Grand Minister over the Masses openly manipulated His Majesty in the court today to compete with me. Do you think he isn\u2019t capable of doing other tricks in the future?\u201d He said, \u201cThe construction of the ancestral hall concerns the clan ancestors. If something happens here, this is not something you and I can afford.\u201dAs expected, Qi Min did not make another sound.Jiang Suizhou gave a faint smile, quickened his pace, and brushed past him. \u201cMinister, my plan isn\u2019t to save my dignity,\u201d Jiang Suizhou said. \u201cRather, it\u2019s to protect all your lives.\u201d\u2014\u2014He left such a meaningful sentence and walked away without looking back.After all, leaving the rest unsaid and giving him room to ponder and speculate would bring out the best effect.Not to mention he was still a conservative old man.When Jiang Suizhou got on the carriage waiting outside Kaiyang Gate, he secretly peeked back and saw Qi Min standing in front of the Zhengyang Gate, looking solemn and pensive.\u2026He truly fooled him.Jiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t help but smile a little.Although he was now at a dead end with wolves in front and tigers behind, he found pleasure in this adversity\u2026It was pretty exhilarating.For example, he bluffed to the famous loyal minister and let the old man go. The minister probably wouldn\u2019t eat well for several days because of Jiang Suizhou\u2019s ambiguous words.This feeling was quite marvelous.Although he originally chose to stay in school just to try to be an idler disguised as a high intellectual, studying history was his hobby.After all, his family had been chaotic since he was a child. His father relied on what little money he had to change wives more frequently than changing cars. There were not only many children in the family, but each also had their own mothers. Those children had cherished their childhood, but Jiang Suizhou was rather miserable. He was too quiet and uncommunicative.Whenever his father\u2019s other children played court schemes at home, Jiang Suizhou hid in his room alone to read books.But when all was said and done, books were books and were nothing more than words. Now, he could see those characters in history books thousands of years ago, walking to and fro in front of him. It seemed\u2026 quite intriguing.Jiang Suizhou has always been very good at finding the silver lining in things.So he put the curtain down in high spirits and sat back.As the carriage set off, he looked at the scenery outside through the floating brocade curtain while devising plans deep within.He must not neglect the main ministers of the dynasty, but above all, there was still Huo Wujiu in his manor. He has traveled from the future and had read enough \u2018spoilers\u2019 to know that no matter how much they fought against it, the dynasty would still perish, and the country would be destroyed after three years.Since this was the case, there was no point in fighting Pang Shao to death. Therefore, Jiang Suizhou just needed to appease and fool them enough to get through these three years.The carriage rocked as it wandered through the wide streets of Lin\u2019an, turned around Qinghe Square and finally stopped in front of Jingwang Manor.Jiang Suizhou got off the carriage and headed to Anyin Hall where he was staying.He was an idle official, and he also didn\u2019t have to go to the government office to work today after attending the Grand Court Assembly. He wanted to rush to Jingwang\u2019s study to go through the letters and folders in his room to get a better understanding of everything.But at the entrance of Anyin Hall, a sobbing maid stopped him.\u201c\u2026Your Highness!\u201d The maid looked exquisitely dressed and must have been someone\u2019s personal maid.\u201cMadam Gu was wronged this morning and is crying at this moment. Please be the judge, Your Highness!\u201dJiang Suizhou was stunned.\u2026Who\u2019s Madam Gu?!He frowned and asked solemnly, \u201c\u2026What happened?\u201dThe maid answered, \u201cThis morning, the new Concubine Huo moved courtyards and happened to run into My Lady. My Lady just casually chatted with him, but he raised his hand against her. He injured My Lady!\u201dJiang Suizhou\u2019s relaxed expression stiffened little by little with the maid\u2019s report.\u2026He did not expect that the original owner had other concubines in the harem in addition to marrying Huo Wujiu.It was even more beyond his imagination that a man would fight a woman in his manor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hence, at this moment, only two maids and a tall brawny manservant went.The two maids should have been assigned to serve Huo Wujiu. When they came in, their faces looked surly. They looked down and indifferent.Seeing that Doctor Zhou was applying medicine to Huo Wujiu, one of the maids opened her mouth and said, \u201cDoctor Zhou, how much longer will it take you to treat him?\u201dThey didn\u2019t look at Huo Wujiu in the slightest, much less salute him, as if they didn\u2019t see him.While bandaging Huo Wujiu, Doctor Zhou replied, \u201cHold on, ladies. He\u2019ll be ready in no time.\u201dThe maids grunted, turned around, and said, \u201cThen be quick. We\u2019ll wait outside.\u201dAfter saying that, the few of them turned around and went out.They went out of the room but didn\u2019t close the door, and left it ajar instead. The maid who didn\u2019t say anything before spoke up, \u201cHow annoying. If we wait a little longer, it will be noon, and we will have to walk in the sun again on the way.\u201dThe other maid said, \u201cYou don\u2019t say. We\u2019re unlucky.\u201dHearing this, the maid laughed a couple of times and said, \u201cUnlucky? The sun is not bad luck. We\u2019re only unlucky that we were assigned to this job.\u201d\u201cRight? Who wants to come and serve a disabled enemy? It\u2019s just not our luck today.\u201dThey made no effort to tone down in the slightest, as if they were afraid that the person inside the room couldn\u2019t hear them. The sharp, clipped voices of the girls reached Doctor Zhou\u2019s ears.Doctor Zhou\u2019s legs started to tremble.Others might not know, but he knew that the man sitting in a wheelchair in front of him was the King of Hell, who could kill without batting an eye.Doctor Zhou was so petrified that he broke out in a cold sweat and carefully raised his eyes to look at Huo Wujiu.He only saw him sitting in place. There wasn\u2019t a lift in his eyes, nor a bit of reaction, as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything.The sunrays fell gently onto the side of his face.Perhaps the sun was so bright that it gave the impression that the motionless cripple in front of him should be an extremely proud man.Doctor Zhou dared not say more. He swiftly withdrew his gaze and bandaged his legs properly.\u201cAfterward, you mustn\u2019t let your wounds get wet. The dressings must be changed once every three days. I will report this truthfully to His Highness,\u201d Doctor Zhou said.Huo Wujiu made no response.The doctor then packed up his medical kit and retreated.Not long after, the two maids came into the room. They instructed the brawny manservant to push the wheelchair forward, so they could take Huo Wujiu away and send him to his future residence.The wheelchair was in no way easy to push.The wheelchair was originally large and heavy, and because it was for Huo Wujiu, it was only a tool for transporting prisoners. The wheelchair was terribly rough, and the two wheels on the chair taken from a prison wagon were barely installed.From the room to the backyard where the wives and concubines live, they had to pass through the gardens of the King\u2019s residence if they wanted to take a shortcut. The gardens in the sunny south have always been a sceneric place for strolls. There were streams and ponds everywhere, and small bridges or gravel paths were built for people to walk on.The two maids loathed their job and didn\u2019t want to bake in the sun, so they insisted on walking through the garden. Even if the manservant was strong, pushing the wheelchair took great effort.After walking for a while, he couldn\u2019t keep up with the two.The two maids only cared about moving forward, and only a while later did they turn around and find that Huo Wujiu had fallen behind.They have long been resentful because they were assigned to serve Huo Wujiu. He was not only a cripple, but an easy target to bully. Hence, when their master did not say a word from the beginning to the end, they became increasingly presumptuous.One of them turned around and said to the manservant, \u201cWhy are you walking so slowly? Is it because she is a lady of an eminent family, so you\u2019re afraid of dirtying her embroidered shoes?\u201dThe manservant pushing the wheelchair was simple and honest. Upon hearing this, sweat dripped down his forehead in anxiety, and he hurriedly explained, \u201cSister, it\u2019s not my fault. The road is really bumpy\u2026\u201dThe other coldly retorted, \u201cWho\u2019s blaming you? Hurry and keep up.\u201dSince it wasn\u2019t his fault, then whose was it? There was no fifth person present.The manservant did not dare to say anything and could only diligently push the wheelchair. The wheels were not sturdy enough to move steadily. In his nervousness, his hands lost control, and the wheelchair suddenly tilted down and was about to tumble to the ground.But then the man in the wheelchair, who remained silent the whole time, raised his hand lightly and pressed it on the armrest.The wheelchair stabilized.The manservant promptly bowed to apologize and thank his master, but out of nowhere, he heard a mellow voice from the front.\u201cWhat\u2019s all the noise about?\u201dWhen the manservant looked up, he saw two people standing under the weeping willow by the pond ahead, followed by a group of servants. One of them was dressed in green, with pale, delicate and pretty features, looking as gentle as jade. The other one was utterly gorgeous. He was a man, but was naturally enticing. He was dressed in red.They were the two concubines in the mansion.The manservant hurriedly followed the two maids and saluted, \u201cGood day, Madam Gu. Good day, Madam Xu.\u201dThe red-clad Madam Gu waved his hand and told them to get up. He stepped forward and said in a lazy voice, \u201cI thought it was someone. So it\u2019s the new Madam Huo who joined the household yesterday.\u201dAs he spoke, he walked up to Huo Wujiu and stopped in his tracks.But Huo Wujiu acted as if he didn\u2019t see the man.\u201cHow old are you, Madam Huo? You must be 23 years old, right?\u201d He spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re a few years younger than me, so just call me elder brother in the future.\u201dWith that, he smilingly stood in front of Huo Wujiu. His stance suggested that he would block the path and wouldn\u2019t go away if Huo Wujiu ignored him.Huo Wujiu did not lift a single eyelid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The green-clad Madam Xu nearby paused and came forward, saying, \u201cChang Yun, let\u2019s go.\u201dGu Changyun didn\u2019t appreciate this and smiled slowly, \u201cXu Du, don\u2019t let him get away with it. He\u2019s newlywed, but he doesn\u2019t even greet his elder brothers. What kind of etiquette is this?\u201dXu Du glanced at Gu Changyun and frowned.He watched as Gu Changyun stretched out his hand, trying to pinch Huo Wujiu\u2019s chin.\u201cHe\u2019s handsome. Raise your head and let Brother have a look\u2026\u201dHis voice came to an abrupt halt.Huo Wujiu was looking down, but he seemed to have eyes on his forehead. He raised his hand without warning, accurately grasped Gu Changyun\u2019s wrist and stopped his movement.The next moment, he exerted force and twisted it ruthlessly.His bones made a fragile cracking sound.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou naturally did not want to care.He dared to vouch with his own head that General Huo wasn\u2019t the one who started the quarrel from jealousy. It must be the other party who provoked him first. If so, why would he want to offend Huo Wujiu because of this person\u2019s foolish provocation?Fight if you want to fight. What was the use of crying? Even women from other houses\u2019 knew how to pull hair. If they were beaten, they would fight back. If he was so capable, he should fight back.Jiang Suizhou glanced at the maid indifferently, and said, \u201cI have important business.\u201d After speaking, he tried to bypass the maid and enter the courtyard.Unexpectedly, the maid actually took two steps forward and stopped him.\u201cYour Lord, my master is badly hurt! The mansion doctor said that person was a hairbreadth away from breaking my master\u2019s wrist!\u201dThat wasn\u2019t even close to the truth.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes impatiently, and was about to speak, but he saw the expression of Meng Qianshan next to him.This little eunuch was silly and simple. All his emotions were written on his face.At this moment, Meng Qianshan was staring at him blankly in astonishment, as if he had done something unbelievable.And in front of him, the tearful maid still stopped him, not the least bit afraid of him flaring up.Jiang Suizhou remembered that when he transmigrated last night, a maid bumped into a water basin and was so terrified, as if she\u2019d die.The maid before him dared to behave arrogantly only because of his favor.He believed that the \u201cMadam Gu\u201d they were referring to was probably the original owner\u2019s favorite concubine.Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth. He could hardly contain himself and cursed the original owner secretly.\u2026It\u2019s fine if you wanted to spoil a man, but you could have spoiled someone who caused no trouble!He took a deep breath and counseled himself inwardly. He came here all by himself, and if there were no accidents, he would have to stay here for some years. Hence, even if he hid, he would have to meet the people close to the original body sooner or later.\u2026Including his messy concubines.While inwardly letting off steam, Jiang Suizhou tilted his head and said lightly to the maid, \u201cI\u2019ll go and see him during dinner.\u201dThe maid immediately stopped her tears and melted into smiles. She saluted and thanked him. Meng Qianshan also breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.Everyone was happy, but Jiang Suizhou\u2019s mouth tasted of bile.He turned around, quickened his pace, and strode into the original owner\u2019s study.Once he entered the study, he shut everyone out and forbade anyone from entering.This afternoon, he brought out his academic skills in checking and analyzing historical materials and browsed through all the folders and letters in the original owner\u2019s study.As expected, although the original body pretended to be an idle prince, he actually had private dealings with many ministers in the court.However, because Pang Shao currently had sole authority over the court and had a lot of henchmen, it didn\u2019t matter even if he could see the original owner\u2019s painstaking work in the court. He only roped in a ragtag team, which was simply mediocre against Pang Shao.It was probably for this reason that Pang Shao had not bothered to scheme against him.In addition, Jiang Suizhou also dug up the two wives in his own harem from the account book.One was called Xu Du, an ideal match that Jiang Suizhou met after he went south to Lin\u2019an; the other was named Gu Changyun, a prostitute he bought from a brothel two years ago.Xu Du was not favored, but had a good relationship with Gu Changyun; on the other hand, the original owner favored Gu Changyun very much. Every few days, he would go to Gu Changyun\u2019s room to rest. Each time he went in, he wouldn\u2019t let others follow.Furthermore, there were many concubines in his house. He bought some of them himself, and some were sent by his associates.However, they either died of illness or suffered punishment. In just a few years, only these two were left.Jiang Suizhou frowned.He did not expect that the original owner was such a brutal man. He knew there was a reason why the servants in the house were terrified of him.The sun glided a bit to the middle of the sky and fell inch by inch. The sunset pierced through the window, sprinkling molten gold of warmth in the room.Meng Qianshan knocked on the door and informed Jiang Suizhou that it was time for dinner.Jiang Suizhou stored the letters away in his room, then left the study and got on the carriage that Meng Qianshan had prepared a while ago.On the way to Madam Gu\u2019s courtyard, he had already figured out how to respond.The original owner was gay, but he wasn\u2019t, and would not do anything to someone else\u2019s concubine \u2014\u2014 despite that \u201csomeone else\u201d now being himself.The concubine surnamed Gu was from a brothel, so he must not have much power. Therefore, once Jiang Suizhou got there, he intended to let the other party complain tearfully. However, he would maintain a cold countenance, put on a look of annoyance from the crying, admonish him with a few sentences, and leave. Afterwhich, he would take this as a reason and pretend that he detested fighting in his harem and ignore the other party, then put the matter behind him.He planned everything and made psychological preparations. He just had to wait for the other party to rush to cry.He followed the original owner\u2019s example and dismissed his servants, but when he walked into Gu Changyun\u2019s courtyard and pushed the door open to his room, he did not expect to see such a scene.Gu Changyun was reclining lazily on a couch in the inner room, holding his bandaged wrist in one hand and rubbing it slowly.Xu Du was also there beside him.Seeing Jiang Suizhou enter, Xu Du got up, clasped his fists and gave him a salute.Madam Gu, who was rumored to be a vixen from the brothel, looked familiar but wasn\u2019t the least bit subservient. He got up and smiled. \u201cToday, I suffered a lot to find an excuse to see Your Highness \u2013 that General Huo, he\u2019s really ruthless.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The large chic houses were divided into courtyards, where the concubines of the palace lived.Jingwang\u2019s residence was originally the residence of an affluent and powerful gentry in Lin\u2019an. The entire residence occupied an extremely large area and was overly luxurious and exquisite. The imperial court fled south, and the gentry were afraid of attracting attacks, so they forfeited a lot of properties. This family homestead was also handed over on a silver platter.Since then, this place became Jingwang\u2019s residence.Jingwang was not like that magnate, whose family lived under the same roof and thrived for generations. The huge residence was simply dissatisfying. Therefore, although the houses in the backyard were numerous, most of them were empty. They were so empty that after a long time, many houses were left unattended.As night fell, a few remaining lamps in the corner were lit in an old and dilapidated courtyard.The door of the room opened with a creak.The maid carried a food container and strode in after entering the threshold. The main house was not spacious, and the objects inside have not been cleaned for a long time. Upon entering, dust would fly everywhere, causing one to choke.The maid frowned in disgust and quickened her steps. She walked to the table in the room, and put the container of food down heavily on the table.\u201cThe food is here. Please help yourself, Master.\u201d Her tone was cold and icy, and the word \u201cmaster\u201d carried a bit of venom, which was quite harsh in the quiet of the night.The person in the wheelchair in the room did not respond to her.The maid had already noticed that this man was not only a cripple, but also a mute. As long as people didn\u2019t touch him, he wouldn\u2019t react to any bullying.He was naturally the best punching bag.The maid had only been in Jingwang\u2019s mansion for a few months and finally got a chance to serve a master.Although several people in the house were considered masters, the gap was huge. Madam Xu\u2019s place, for instance, wasn\u2019t an ideal place.She has long been seeking ways and tried every means to serve Madam Gu in his courtyard, but she did not expect that she would be assigned to this disabled person.What benefits could she gain by coming here? The cripple himself was living in a dilapidated house that leaked.The maid had a stomach full of grievances, and when she saw his wheelchair, she felt even more unlucky.Seeing that the cripple was silent as usual, she sneered and said, \u201cYou probably don\u2019t know it yet. After what happened at noon today, Madam Gu\u2019s maid went to His Highness\u2019s courtyard to complain. Once His Highness heard the news, he immediately said that he would go to Madam Gu\u2019s room tonight.\u201dHuo Wujiu didn\u2019t move a muscle.The maid\u2019s voice turned a bit sharp: \u201cDo you know what kind of person Madam Gu is? You hit his beloved. Do you think His Highness will let you go? When His Highness punishes you, we might even be implicated. I am truly unlucky to be assigned to such a shabby courtyard: on my first day here, I ran into such a thing.\u201dAfter saying that, she coldly snorted, turned around and stomped out.\u201cA mere cripple, yet you want to fight with others. You really overestimated yourself.\u201dThe door was heavily slammed shut.Huo Wujiu slowly closed his eyes.His forehead was burning badly at this moment, and he was already having a fever because of his wounds.His mind gradually clouded with a layer of chaos, despite himself being sober.He hid all emotions back into the depths of his eyes.In those eyes, a savage beast was forcibly shut into a narrow cage by reason, scraped by the iron cage till it bled all over.He had endured pain and humiliation since he was a child.He knew that a defeated foe ought to be trampled upon at will; it was rightly so. He also knew that he had to stay in the green hills and lie on faggots and taste gall. So long as he had one last breath, there would always be a day that blood would be paid in blood.He knew that there was no hardship he couldn\u2019t endure and overcome, but he never realized that to kill a tiger, there wasn\u2019t really a need for a knife.Just let him sustain some injuries, lock him up, and sprinkle a handful of flies on his injuries that couldn\u2019t be dispersed or avoided.The tiger would then naturally die, little by little. No matter how strong it was, it wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou looked at them blankly and saw Gu Changyun stepping forward and asking him to sit down. Then he asked, \u201cMaster, what did Pang Shao do in the courtroom today?\u201dGu Changyun\u2019s question rendered Jiang Suizhou dumbfounded.He assumed many possibilities, but never considered that the vixen was not a vixen, and the ideal marriage was not an ideal marriage. These two people were actually the original owner\u2019s staff who were kept in the house under the name of concubines.For a time, many things became clearer.It turned out that the original owner\u2019s so-called \u201chomosexuality\u201d was nothing but a guise. It was a no-brainer. It must have been to deceive the emperor and Pang Shao and reduce their reservations against him. The so-called concubines who died because of his brutality and viciousness must have been spies that others sent to test him, and therefore died tragically at his hands.Jiang Suizhou admired the original owner for a moment.Bearing disgrace and a heavy burden, while meticulous planning\u2026had he been the one who sat on the throne, the Jing Dynasty wouldn\u2019t have perished so quickly.He slowly sat down on the Taishi chair 1 in the middle of the room while digesting the huge amount of information that came out of nowhere.In a moment, he deliberated his words and spoke briefly, \u201cHe asked me for the right to repair the ancestral hall through His Majesty\u2019s mouth.\u201dAfter saying that, he picked up the cup of tea that Gu Changyun just poured for him on the table and took a sip.He had forgotten to drink water when he was in the study and read through the information earlier. Now that he took a seat, he felt parched.Jiang Suizhou took two sips of tea, but the room remained quiet. The two people did not speak.Footnote:1 Taishi chair \u2013\u00a0a symbol of the master\u2019s status and identity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is no other way.\u201dNext to him, Gu Changyun spoke, \u201cSince he has borrowed the mouth of His Majesty, it is indeed difficult for Your Highness to refuse. It\u2019s just a pity that the money will fall into Pang Shao\u2019s hands again.\u201dXu Du said, \u201cThere is still a chance later on, so just wait. But the Ministry of Rites\u2019 officials, can Your Highness appease them?\u201dGu Changyun nodded. \u201cIndeed. Those lords have done a lot of work for Your Highness this time. If we annoy them, your agreements with them recently will become a threat against you in their hands.\u201dAfter speaking, the two of them turned sideways and looked at Jiang Suizhou.They were straightforward, clear and logical. It was easy to discern that all the information the original owner usually obtained was shared with them. These two people were extremely trustworthy to him.But the premise was\u2026They didn\u2019t find out that another person swapped over Jingwang.Hence, Jiang Suizhou was quite cautious. After taking down what they said, along with the names of those ministers discreetly, he nodded and said concisely, \u201cI know. I\u2019ve also advised Lord Qi today.\u201dThe two nodded.Then, Jiang Suizhou briefly told them about the rest of the memorials in the courtroom. Fortunately, the Huo Zhu was a consummate fatuous ruler and nothing useful was discussed during the early morning court session, so Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t have much trouble.Both naturally discussed with him.What they considered was what Pang Shao would do under this dynasty, and what chances they had to interfere and reap profits by the way. Jiang Suizhou gradually realized that these two people must be the original owner\u2019s think tank. They would analyze and deduce for him, and then it was up to him to make the decision.It was mainly because the original owner had a weak single power that his means in fighting against Pang Shao were not so glorious. \u2014\u2014 For example, in the case of repairing the ancestral hall, the original owner\u2019s intention was to also embezzle from the inside. The difference with Pang Shao was in whose hands the money would fall.Jiang Suizhou understood him. After all, the imperial court has reached such a point. It was simply useless to blindly remain upright and clean.Jiang Suizhou then listened carefully to the two\u2019s discussion and wrote down the useful information for future use when fishing in troubled waters.Time flew by. When they finished discussing things, half of the lamp oil was used up.They stopped. Jiang Suizhou said he was somewhat thirsty and again picked up a cup of tea, drinking two sips of tea.Then Gu Changyun spoke again.\u201cMaster\u2026how do you feel about Huo Wujiu?\u201d he asked.Jiang Suizhou froze.\u2026What do you mean, feel? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re still competing with him for favor?He looked at Gu Changyun. He wanted to say something but stopped and did not speak for a moment.Then he saw Gu Changyun rubbing his wrist and puffed out a laugh.\u201cMaster, don\u2019t think too much. I have discussed with Xu Du today, and I think on Huo Wujiu\u2019s side\u2026There are still things that you must do yourself.\u201dJiang Suizhou did not understand, so he inclined his head, signaling him to continue.Xu Du and Gu Changyun exchanged glances.Gu Changyun then expounded, \u201cIn the last couple of years, Pang Shao and His Majesty haven\u2019t stopped planting spies on you. However, you\u2019ve disposed of all those people, and none of them were left. Now, there are only two of us in the house, and you brought both of us in yourself\u2026Therefore, when Pang Shao proposed the plan to His Majesty to give Huo Wujiu to you as a concubine, I think it must have been with the intention of testing you.\u201dJiang Suizhou frowned: \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201dGu Changyun nodded. \u201cHis Majesty doesn\u2019t care about it for the time being, but Pang Shao still has doubts about your homosexuality. The people he sent in before were all spies, but this time, Huo Wujiu is different\u2026He is neither His Majesty\u2019s nor Pang Shao\u2019s. He was born with outstanding looks, so Pang Shao must have sent someone to secretly spy to see if you\u2026will still favor Huo Wujiu.\u201dJiang Suizhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dAh, let me spoil Huo Wujiu to prove that I am a gay? Why don\u2019t you guys just cut off my head and hand it over to Huo Wujiu?He immediately refused, \u201cIf I don\u2019t spoil Huo Wujiu, will that prove that my homosexuality is fake? That\u2019s an inappropriate move.\u201dBut Xu Du, who has been silent, seconded.He said, \u201cBut if you pamper him several times, that can prove that you\u2019re gay \u4e00 Otherwise, I think it will not be long before Pang Shao\u2019s party will still send people in. If you kill anyone who enters one by one\u2026I think it won\u2019t be long before it\u2019s exposed.\u201dGu Changyun nodded, \u201cWe discussed and felt that this is the most appropriate way to go. Your Highness does not need to worry. Just spend more nights at Huo Wujiu\u2019s place during this period of time.\u201dThey implied that it didn\u2019t matter whether he did or didn\u2019t do something to him.It was enough to physically let Pang Shao know that he, Jiang Suizhou, could bear to sleep with even the most loathsome men as long as they were good looking.Xu Du then added, \u201cToday is quite good. Changyun has just clashed with Huo Wujiu, and it makes sense for you to visit him today.\u201dFor a time, two pairs of extremely serious eyes looked at Jiang Suizhou one after another.Jiang Suizhou looked at them and fell into silence.He had made a lot of preparations, just so he could not sleep with the original master\u2019s concubines.It never occurred to him that the original owner\u2019s concubines would look at him eagerly and ask him to sleep with Huo Wujiu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shall we play a game of chess and then go back?\u201d He suggested lazily, blowing on the floating leaves on the water.Xu Du, however, made no sound.Gu Changyun raised his eyes and saw that Xu Du was sizing him up.They had worked together for a long time, and with a single look, Gu Changyun understood what he was thinking.He held his tea and let out a snort of laughter.Xu Du opened his mouth and said, \u201cYou can see it too.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, but a statement.That, although clearly the King looked like the King, he was in no way the King.Both of their lives were tethered to His Highness, so His Highness never worried that they would defect, let alone had to pretend in front of them\u2026He had never treated the two of them so calmly.Especially when Pang Shao snatched away what was his, he was too calm.As for Huo Wujiu\u2026His Majesty bestowed their marriage through a decree, so His Highness had loathed him before even seeing him. His Highness transferred all his hatred for Pang Shao and His Majesty to Huo Wujiu, wishing to let Huo Wujiu die a violent death in his residence like those scouts, and let people drag him to a mass grave.After all, to His Highness, Huo Wujiu was a symbol of the emperor\u2019s wanton humiliation of him. A day that Huo Wujiu stayed in his house meant a day he was trampled under the feet of the good-for-nothing he had always despised.Therefore, at a glance, Xu Du saw through Gu Changyun\u2019s scrutiny with his\u00a0 proposal just now.Gu Changyun put down his cup of tea.\u201cWhat do I see? The one who came just now, isn\u2019t he the King?\u201dHe spoke breezily. While speaking, he took out a chessboard and two chess baskets, one black and one white, from under the table where he sat, and placed one of them in Xu Du\u2019s hand.\u201cNo matter what, the lives of my whole family are in His Highness\u2019s hands.\u201d Gu Changyun drawled as he slowly and orderly moved the chess pieces.\u201cAs long as we obey the King\u2019s orders, we don\u2019t have to worry about anything else, right?\u201dSaying that, he dropped a piece on the chessboard and raised his eyes at Xu Du.Flickers of excitement shimmered in those exquisite and delicate eyes, that were as cold as a bottomless abyss.\u2014\u2014Those two lulled Jiang Suizhou. After weighing the pros and cons, he still went to Huo Wujiu\u2019s residence.He had killed those previous spies sent in as concubines, but the more of them he killed, the more suspicious he\u2019d become. What was more, he was a modern man and couldn\u2019t send someone to kill another.This time\u2026he could only rely on Huo Wujiu.Along the way, Jiang Suizhou was chagrined.He regretted speaking too harshly.Last night, he had warned Huo Wujiu not to be an eyesore, yet today, he himself rushed to his residence to be an eyesore.Before he even arrived at Huo Wujiu\u2019s residence, he had already felt embarrassed for himself.The palanquin traveled for a long time before it finally arrived at a dimly lit courtyard.Jiang Suizhou sat in the palanquin and only glanced at it briefly before withdrawing his gaze.Next to the courtyard, it was pitch black with some faint lights in the distance. That must be the house where the servants lived.But unexpectedly, the palanquin stopped in front of this courtyard gate.Jiang Suizhou looked askance at Meng Qianshan, who was beaming at him from the side. Meng Qianshab stepped forward and tried to help him get out of the palanquin.As Jiang Suizhou walked down, he frowned and asked, \u201cHere?\u201dMeng Qianshan nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re here! This is the courtyard that Your Highness has arranged for Madam Huo. Did you forget?\u201dJiang Suizhou stood still and looked up.From a distance, this courtyard and the surrounding houses were in harmony. He couldn\u2019t see anything special.But when he stood closer, he could see that the courtyard was barren. There were weeds everywhere and several big trees that had never been pruned looked like they were baring fangs and claws in the yard. The ground was covered with a layer of leaves that should have fallen in the autumn of last year.Through the dim light coming from the window, he could vaguely see the broken window panes and window paper, rustling and trembling under the breeze.\u2026This place was uninhabitable!King Jing had driven Huo Wujiu to the corner of the palace and gave him such a dilapidated house to live in. A quick glance around and it was clear that the original owner never wanted Huo Wujiu to appear in front of him for the rest of his life. He even deliberately made things difficult for Huo Wujiu, so that he would live a bitter life in the King\u2019s residence.The original owner was struggling in Southern Jing; he was probably limited to seizing power from the Emperor and Pang Shao. For him, Huo Wujiu was a traitor and an enemy he would never consider to win over.\u2014\u2014How could he have known what Huo Wujiu would do three years later?Jiang Suizhou fell into a complicated mood for a while and couldn\u2019t help but thank his two \u201cconcubines\u201d in his heart.If not for today\u2019s timely arrival, he probably would have had to shoulder the original owner\u2019s blame again and be a credit on Huo Wujiu\u2019s account.He sighed inwardly, and grunted, \u201cI mentioned it offhand. I can\u2019t remember.\u201dAfter speaking, he lifted his feet and walked towards the courtyard.Next to him, Meng Qianshan clicked his tongue in wonder.How could he not remember? A few days ago, when he asked His Highness where Madam Huo would live, His Highness\u2019s eyes were frighteningly cold. He specifically said to throw Huo Wujiu a little further away and never let him see him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Faced with such ardent love, the disgust of before naturally did not count\u2026Meng Qianshan jogged all the way and followed behind Jiang Suizhou.Not only was this courtyard on low terrain, but all the used water from the residence was also dumped here. As soon as Jiang Suizhou entered the yard, he felt damp and cold. Even the wind blowing on his body was several degrees lower.\u2026Truth be told, this sickly body is just too sensitive.He went straight to the room in the middle but found no one in the corridor.Before he could speak, Meng Qianshan beat him to it. He raised his voice and said, \u201cWhere have all the people in this courtyard gone?\u201dA few moments later, two maids scurried out from the side room, looking like they had already hit the sack.As soon as they saw them, both showed surprise and fear on their faces. They quickly stepped forward and knelt down in front of Jiang Suizhou: \u201c\u2026Your Highness!\u201dJiang Suizhou\u2019s brow furrowed.Although he was still unaccustomed to the ancient concept of masters and servants, he knew that one should do their job when paid wages. On top of that, one shouldn\u2019t bully their employer.They were obviously bullying Huo Wujiu.Beside him, Meng Qianshan caught a glimpse of his reaction and sternly rebuked, \u201cWhy is there not even a night watch at the door? So, did you just leave your master to sleep like this? Did you come here to serve the Madam or to be the master yourself?\u201dThe two maids did not dare to raise their heads at all, kowtowing one after the other to admit their mistakes.Jiang Suizhou raised his hand and rubbed his temples.It was apparent that the original owner\u2019s death in the unofficial history was not only because of his own actions, but also because everyone in his house, from top to bottom, flattered the superior and trampled on the lowly. He insistently formed a deep-rooted enmity with Huo Wujiu that solidified his end.He waved his hand and said indifferently, \u201cHandle it.\u201d Then he turned and went into the room.Meng Qianshan agreed and ordered, \u201cMen, drag them both away and give them a beating. Tomorrow, send them back to the slave trader along with their deeds of sale and sell them wherever!\u201dThe two maids cried for mercy but were dragged far away.However, Jiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t care less about them.As soon as he entered the room, he choked and coughed violently.There was dust everywhere, filling the air. After just one breath, Jiang Suizhou felt like his fragile lungs had been hit hard. He was coughing so hard that he couldn\u2019t distinguish between the north and the south, and tears welled up in his eyes.The servants who followed behind were terrified. They entered in a flurry, helping to pour tea. But there wasn\u2019t even a place to sit in the room, and the pot on the table only contained half a pot of cold water.Everyone rushed around. Amidst the chaos, Jiang Suizhou vaguely heard the sound of a wheelchair, low and mute, which was instantly drowned in the sound of people.Someone helped him to sit at the side. After coughing for a long time, he downed the hot tea that people had taken the trouble to find, suppressed it, and barely stopped coughing.Only then did he open his teary eyes and saw Huo Wujiu, who was sitting diagonally in front of Jiang Suizhou looking suspiciously at him.His dark eyes were like whirlpools.Jiang Suizhou involuntarily coughed a few more times, and the physiological tears in his eyes fell in response.As the tears fell, Jiang Suizhou also closely beheld Huo Wujiu.He wasn\u2019t sure if it was his illusion, but Huo Wujiu\u2019s dark eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of fog.But the next moment, those eyes moved away and did not look at him again.Jiang Suizhou was naturally unaware of how pitiful he appeared in the eyes of others.A cold and beautiful sickly man with reddened eyes, teary eyelashes, and a heavy cloak wrapped around him; when someone took in his tearful appearance, why did he feel like he was somewhat inviting a ravaging?Jiang Suizhou was completely oblivious. When he finished coughing, he gathered the cloak that Meng Qianshan had just wrapped around him, sat up straight and said indifferently, \u201cMeng Qianshan, is this the arrangement you said you had made?\u201dThe cough sobered him up. He knew that he had to shift the blame first, so that he could logically take charge and give Huo Wujiu a new residence.Hearing this, Meng Qianshan trembled and guiltily pleaded, \u201cIt\u2019s all my negligence \u2013 it\u2019s all my negligence! Tomorrow\u2026um, no, immediately! I\u2019ll immediately let people tidy up another courtyard and have Madam Huo move there!\u201dJiang Suizhou gave a hum of approval and took another sip of tea.He thought to himself; it would be best if Huo Wujiu was moved closer to him. After all, he had just taken the advice of those two minions and had to frequent Huo Wujiu\u2019s place in the coming days\u2026He drank his tea with a start.Didn\u2019t the Anyin Hall where he lived have a lot of spare rooms?Not only could he see Huo Wujiu daily and prevent others from secretly bullying him, but he would also have a way to sneak back to sleep in his own room. Once this reached the Emperor and Pang Shao\u2019s ears, his goal would be achieved\u2026What better way to have the best of both worlds than this?!Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes all but lit up.He put down his teacup and spoke gently.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to clean up another courtyard,\u201d he instructed, \u201cMove him directly to my place.\u201dFor a spell, the servants around him froze when they heard this command.But Jiang Suizhou remained motionless.Anyway, as the head of his own house, he needn\u2019t explain his decisions to them. He just needed to pretend to be unpredictable.However\u2026He noticed under the dim light that Huo Wujiu\u2019s face looked somewhat abnormal.He wasn\u2019t even listening to what Jiang Suizhou was saying. One of his arms was resting on the armrest of his wheelchair, while the other hand was laboriously supporting his drooping head.\u2026Was he sick?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 11.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMeng Qianshan did not succeed in helping Madam Huo move courtyards today.Once his master found out that Madam Huo was not quite right and did not respond after calling out to him twice, Meng Qianshan raced all the way back and personally went to look for the mansion doctor.Jiang Suizhou, who remained in the room, ordered the rest of the servants to push Huo Wujiu to the inner room and help him lie down on the bed first.Huo Wujiu seemed to be running a fever, a severe fever. Although he was still sitting, his reaction was much slower.He reacted only when someone tried to help him.The servant was just about to touch his leg when he reflexively raised his hand and blocked the man.That servant was overwhelmed with astonishment. Then Huo Wujiu looked down and said hoarsely, \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dCalm but resolute. The servant hurriedly looked at Jiang Suizhou and waited for the King\u2019s own order. However, he found that Jiang Suizhou, who was sitting beside him, didn\u2019t look at him and instead fixed his gaze on Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t pay attention to them. Instead, he braced his hands on the armrests. Although he moved skillfully, it was obvious that he was weak at this time and his movements were somewhat sluggish.He slowly propped himself up and moved to the bed.After sitting on the bed, he did not lie down, but propped himself up with the bedpost.He sat straight and still.Although Huo Wujiu said nothing, Jiang Suizhou saw some innate pride in his movements.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s gaze paused and suddenly he couldn\u2019t help but think of Huo Wujiu from the history books.He was born in Yangguan as the son of the Marquis of Dingbei of the Jing Dynasty. He learned equestrian and archery at the age of six, and hunted tigers at the age of ten. He turned thirteen in the 20th year of Southern Jing, when the Emperor of Jing forced his father to rebel and rise against Southern Jing. In the 23rd year of Southern Jing, his father died in the Battle of Xunyang. His uncle who joined his father in the uprising was also besieged and surrounded by the army.It was he who took over the commander-in-chief banner in the rebel army and rescued his uncle from the sieg. He won against his stronger enemy and became famous from one battle. Afterward, he defended his uncle and became the commander of the Liang army step by step.Prior to his capture, he had not lost a single battle and was an irresistible power. In just four years, he invaded Yecheng and drove the Emperor of Jing across the Yangtze River, from which the Liang dynasty divided the river and ruled.He was a finely dressed young general, riding on a dashing horse. Even if historians wrote about him impartially, they couldn\u2019t deny his legendary character.He was a hero that Jiang Suizhou had studied countless times through yellowing historical materials, thousands of years apart.Huo Wujiu was right to be a proud man.Jiang Suizhou suddenly understood why the emperor broke Huo Wujiu\u2019s legs.This seemed to be the only way to make him kneel down.Jiang Suizhou fell into a trance and didn\u2019t notice that he was staring at Huo Wujiu the entire time. He also didn\u2019t notice that even though Huo Wujiu was already burnt out, he was still acutely aware of Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes and frowned slightly, staring right back at him.By the time Jiang Suizhou came to his senses, Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes had already turned hostile.Jiang Suizhou read his eyes at a glance.Huo Wujiu seemed to be asking him wordlessly:\u00a0Why don\u2019t you get lost?Jiang Suizhou: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe rare bit of emotion that rose in his heart dissipated cleanly.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze without giving away what he intended to hide. He masked his guilty conscience with coldness, gathered his cloak with one hand while walking to the bedside, and looked condescendingly at Huo Wujiu from above.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the mansion doctor arrived yet?\u201d He coldly asked the servants nearby.The maids and servants around all knew that His Highness had a terrible temper and was difficult to serve, so they didn\u2019t dare to say a word. Silence reigned in the room for a while.Nonetheless, only Jiang Suizhou knew that he felt quite embarrassed under Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze. He was a paper tiger in a hasty search for a remedy to redeem himself.From the corner of his eye, he looked at Huo Wujiu, but the man had long since lowered his eyes and wasn\u2019t looking at him.\u2026Even in sickness, you\u2019re extraordinarily unpleasant.Fortunately, Meng Qianshan came right on time, gasping for breath with the mansion doctor.It was still Doctor Zhou.As soon as he entered the room, he saw His Highness standing cold as ice by the bed, as if confronting Huo Wujiu who was seated there. When His Highness saw him enter, he inclined his head slightly, and a pair of icy eyes shot towards him.Doctor Zhou has always been timid, so he immediately lowered his head, not daring to take another look.\u201cCome and check him out.\u201d He heard the King\u2019s cold command.\u201cLook at how sick he is. Don\u2019t let him die in my mansion.\u201dThat voice sounded so nice, the tone arrogant and gentle, but with some faintly audible fine wheezing. From the sound of it, he was in bad health and was out of breath midway.The doctor hurriedly responded and came forward with his eyes downcast, just in time to see Huo Wujiu sitting on the bed, subtly lifting his eyelids and giving the King a meaningful glance.He was about to withdraw his gaze, yet as if something had attracted him, his gaze paused and fell on the King again.Doctor Zhou was about to take another look when his eyes suddenly collided with a cold, hostile and gloomy gaze.Huo Wujiu had caught him peering.Those eyes were evidently feeble and cloudy, but they still scared Doctor Zhou. He quickly dropped his gaze, walked over to Huo Wujiu\u2019s bed, put down his medical kit, and began to diagnose him.Jiang Suizhou sat back again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 11.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMeng Qianshan stood on his side, skillfully filling a pot with fresh, hot tea. He placed it beside him and asked carefully, \u201cWhere is Your Highness staying tonight?\u201dWith Madam Huo\u2019s appearance today, he definitely could not serve His Highness in bed. Moreover, he had a fever, and His Highness was weak. What if he passed his illness to His Highness?Jiang Suizhou watched Doctor Zhou and did not speak for a while.Meng Qianshan sensed that His Highness wasn\u2019t in the mood to speak, so he also quietly waited at his side and asked no further.A moment later, Doctor Zhou turned around and knelt in front of Jiang Suizhou.\u201cYour Highness, Madam Huo is suffering from a high fever due to wound inflammation\u2026\u201d He added hurriedly, \u201cMadam Huo endured it, but he has been burning up for some time. His injuries are quite serious, so if this continues, I\u2019m afraid it will endanger his life!\u201dJiang Suizhou frowned, \u201cIt\u2019s that serious?\u201dDoctor Zhoufu nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll immediately boil some medicine and change his bandages later. As long as his fever subsides in time, it won\u2019t be a big problem.\u201dJiang Suizhou nodded. \u201cTell Meng Qianshan to boil the medicine, while you change the bandages for him now.\u201dDoctor Zhou agreed promptly.Jiang Suizhou propped one hand on his cheek, turned his head sideways and looked at Huo Wujiu, who was sitting on the edge of the bed.Although Huo Wujiu was sitting upright, he was already dizzy from the fever. His eyes that were glaring at everyone just now were also shut heavily.Doctor Zhou carefully unwrapped his bandages to clean his wounds. Blood had soaked the gauze, making it stuck to the flesh. Even when he carefully unwrapped the gauze, the wounds were still inevitably torn.Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes were closed, but his brow was furrowed. He pursed his lips and still restrained himself from gasping even in his muddled state. Only the trembling of his brow as his bandages were ripped open revealed that he was in pain.Jiang Suizhou suddenly remembered something.When he was a child and still living in his father\u2019s house, his brother, born from a younger woman he didn\u2019t know, once pushed him down the stairs and caused him to twist his ankle. His mother was in a bad mood those days and always crying, so he did not dare to let her know. He limped back to his room and endured the pain all night.The feeling of enduring the pain alone was so torturous that no amount of reading could distract him from it.But for Huo Wujiu, it seemed to have become a habit engraved in his bones.Jiang Suzhou couldn\u2019t resist staring at Huo Wujiu\u2019s body, unable to extricate his eyes for a second.It was covered in crisscross injuries,\u00a0 fresh, bloody, and very deep.\u2026It must hurt like hell.He sat there quietly, watching Doctor Zhou clean Huo Wujiu\u2019s wounds, rewrap them in gauze, and help him lie down.Doctor Zhou then reported to Jiang Suizhou. He knelt once more, and said, \u201cYour Highness, his bandages have been changed. Later on, just give Madam the medicine and sponge him with cold towels to cool him down. Once his fever subsides, there\u2019ll be no serious problem.\u201dJiang Suizhou nodded and raised his hand, signaling him to go and do it himself.Doctor Zhou went to prepare a handkerchief and placed it on Huo Wujiu\u2019s forehead.Not long after, Meng Qianshan came back with the medicine.He handed the medicine to the doctor and returned to Jiang Suizhou\u2019s side, bowing down and asking, \u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s getting late. Why don\u2019t you go back to Anyin Hall and rest for now?\u201dSeeing that Jiang Suizhou was staring at Huo Wujiu, he did not forget to add, \u201cIf you are not at ease, I will leave some more people here to keep watch.\u201dHe naturally knew that Huo Wujiu would not burn to death, and that there was nothing to worry about.However, he could not help but think of the original Huo Wujiu.Back then, there must have been no one to bandage him or change his dressing. To survive such a high fever like this one, it was a wonder how many days and nights he burned up. He had forcibly dragged his life back from Yama\u2019s hands.Having experienced what it was like to exercise patience in pain alone, Jiang Suizhou suddenly felt reluctant to leave.A few moments later, he ordered lightly, \u201cGo find a book for me.\u201dMeng Qianshan was stunned. He forged ahead and replied without thought, \u201cIs Your Highness not going to leave\u2026?\u201dJiang Suizhou raised his eyes and looked at him, forcing the second half of Meng Qianshan\u2019s words back into his mouth.Meng Qianshan could only nod repeatedly and go find him a book.\u2014\u2014When Huo Wujiu woke up, it was already late at night.He opened his eyes in the dark, feeling something on his forehead. He raised his hand and pulled it off, and saw that it was a damp, cool handkerchief.He frowned.It seemed that he has been feverish since the afternoon today. This was nothing unusual. He was wounded so many times on the battlefield and occasionally suffered fevers. A good night\u2019s sleep was all it took.In the evening, King Jing seemed to have visited, and before he figured what the latter was going to do, Huo Wujiu had fainted from the fever.Huo Wujiu lifted his hand and touched his forehead.A cool patch.He was fully sober at this point, but an extremely surreal feeling arose deep within him.He was a prisoner of war captured by the enemy, a tool sent to King Jing\u2019s residence to humiliate him. However, he was now lying peacefully on a bed. His wounds were treated and now clean and fresh; his forehead was covered with a cool handkerchief; and the air was filled with a faint smell of medicine.It was distinctly bitter, yet calming and soothing.He was born at the border where life was gruelling. He was extremely resistant to any fall, and had never been so cared for in his life.He turned his head sideways and saw a man sitting in the dim light.The man was asleep, holding a book in one hand on his lap while supporting the side of his head with the other. His eyelashes were long, covering a pair of eyes that were always cold and arrogant.The light shone on his side profile, coating him with a soft glow.Huo Wujiu realized that he was guarding him.His breathing hitched uncontrollably.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 12.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Suizhou did not sleep well again tonight.He was sleepy from reading, not knowing when he fell asleep, and Meng Qianshan also gave him a blanket to prevent him from catching a fever.But when he opened his eyes, he still felt dizzy and lightheaded, especially because the couch was extremely hard. It was very uncomfortable after sitting for a long period of time. He sat there all night, making his body sore all over.Jiang Suizhou felt somewhat infuriated.How did the original owner arrange such a room for Huo Wujiu? With such simple furniture, did he not consider that Huo Wujiu would sleep on the sofa here one day?He sat up and found that the sky was getting brighter. The aroma of food drifted in. It should be Meng Qianshan directing the people to prepare breakfast.Jiang Suizhou stood up and glanced at the bed.It was empty. Where was Huo Wujiu?Jiang Suizhou had just woken up and was still a bit confused, so he froze and looked around.He was caught off guard when his gaze collided with a pair of cool, dark eyes.Jiang Suizhou was startled to see Huo Wujiu sitting by the window in the faint daylight. He was holding the book Jiang Suizhou had read halfway last night, flipping through it at random.Just by looking at his movements with the book, it was evident that Huo Wujiu wasn\u2019t a man who could read at all.He raised his eyes to look at Jiang Suizhou, his gaze cold and his face expressionless.His eyes looked like they could see right through people.Jiang Suizhou suddenly felt somewhat embarrassed. He didn\u2019t do anything, but for some reason, he felt a little guilty.\u2026Perhaps because of his choice to keep watch all night, his persona was more or less in ruins.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze as if nothing had happened and coldly called out, \u201cMeng Qianshan?\u201dWhen Meng Qianshan who was outside heard his call, he trotted inside to wait upon Jiang Suizhou.Meng Qianshan had always been garrulous. As long as Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t interrupt him, he could talk like nobody\u2019s business for hours on end. Jiang Suizhou happened to be embarrassed, so he let him nag. Afterward, as if Huo Wujiu was nonexistent, Jiang Suizhou finished breakfast, then fled.Today, there was no grand court assembly, so he could go to the office.Before leaving, he remembered to remind Meng Qianshan, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to move Madam Huo into my courtyard.\u201dMeng Qianshan repeatedly assured him.After Jiang Suizhou left, Meng Qianshan returned to Huo Wujiu\u2019s courtyard, bringing some people with him.The courtyard was remote and dilapidated, and Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t bring anything with him. Furthermore, he only stayed there for one night, so there was really nothing to move.However, Madam Huo\u2019s status obviously wasn\u2019t the same as when he first entered the mansion. It would be negligent to just bring him to the King\u2019s courtyard, right?So, Meng Qianshan served Huo Wujiu breakfast with great care. After Huo Wujiu had eaten his fill, he smiled so much that he couldn\u2019t see his lips and asked, \u201cMadam Huo, is there anything else you want to buy? I\u2019ll have someone fetch it.\u201dHuo Wujiu didn\u2019t speak.This servant was noisy and always currying favor, a bit of an eyesore.Even more so because Meng Qianshan already regarded Huo Wujiu as a favored concubine, making him sick.Meng Qianshan was completely oblivious. Hearing no response from Huo Wujiu, he made arrangements by himself. \u201cRobes for all seasons must be made. I\u2019ll go and invite the tailors in a little while. And Madam\u2019s wheelchair, I\u2019ll also find a carpenter to build a new one, all right? As for the servants who\u2019ll attend to you\u2026\u201dHe met a pair of dark eyes.Seeing that Huo Wujiu was looking at him, Meng Qianshan hurriedly bowed and stepped forward, only assuming he had something to order: \u201cMadam?\u201dHowever, Huo Wujiu only gave him a faint glance with eyes as cold as a bottomless pool, a glance that chilled his heart and lungs.\u201cI don\u2019t need anything,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cYou, just get away.\u201dMeng Qianshan choked, and his enthusiasm was doused with cold water.He fled in embarrassment.\u2026I never thought that Master would like someone as fierce and unreasonable as him.He was too difficult to serve.\u2014\u2014Although there was no grand court session, Jiang Suizhou had to go to the government office every day, but the Ministry of rites was more leisurely than other places. In addition, his job was sinecure, so he had nothing to do all day long.On top of that, his boss, Ji You, was a good old chap.From the records about this man in history books alone, it was clear that he was an idle official averse to trickery and was only fond of the four forms of poetry. Although the late emperor appointed him Number One Scholar, he was always a lukewarm official and spent his time writing beautiful poetry.Ji You wasn\u2019t at all close to Jui Suizhou, and at first glance, wasn\u2019t in their camp, but nor was he hard on him. Even seeing that he looked unwell, Ji You said with a smile that there was nothing important\u00a0 for the day, and that Jiang Suizhou could go home earlier to rest.Jiang Suizhou breathed a sigh of relief.For him, whether it was the imperial court, or his own harem, the water was a little too deep, so he had to always be alert and vigilant.On the contrary, working his shift at the government office was a rare breather.For the first time, he took a good rest in the government office with the mentality of a middle-aged man who didn\u2019t want to face the family pressure after work and hid in the car to smoke for a long time before going upstairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt that the air in the Ministry of Rites was very fresh.So much so that he was in a very good mood. When it was time to leave, he stopped to exchange pleasantries with Ji You when passing by his table.\u201cLord Ji, what are you looking at?\u201d He looked at the book in Ji You\u2019s hand and asked.Ji You looked up and saw that it was Jiang Suizhou. Ji You smiled and passed the book over to him: \u201cIt\u2019s just some unofficial history without basis. It\u2019s just to kill time.\u201dJiang Suizhou took the book and flipped through it roughly, and indeed he was right.Not only was it unofficial history, but it was also extremely boldly written unofficial history. It was almost like a written script with the same surname and name of the former emperor.Jiang Suizhou flashed a bland smile, handed the book back to Ji You, and said with a smile, \u201cThe content is interesting.\u201dJi You smiled and raised his eyebrows in surprise: \u201cIs Your Highness also interested in this?\u201dThe literati in this world have always been more sanctimonious. History books written in biographical style were orthodox, so privately compiled history like this with flourishing imagination was for the commoner\u2019s amusement. The ordinary literati and aristocrats scorned them.Jiang Suizhou shook his head.He muttered inwardly:\u00a0Of course I\u2019m not interested in unofficial history, but you wouldn\u2019t believe me even if I told you. I\u2019m standing here and talking to you because I\u2019m currently suffering for looking down on unofficial history.\u2026Of course, you yourself may be living in unofficial history.These kinds of words could only be said to himself and naturally couldn\u2019t be voiced out. Jiang Suizhou smiled gently and said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested. But history books are always written by people, and the later generations will comment on them, so who knows who is telling the truth and who is telling lies?\u201dHe saw Ji You\u2019s eyes light up when he heard his words. His eyes twinkled with a glow of seeing a confidant.Jiang Suizhou hurriedly nodded to him in farewell, and then turned around and left.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou thought he couldn\u2019t afford such a high opinion from the Minister. After all, he could say such things, all thanks to a student who pitted him into an unofficial history.Jiang Suizhou left the Ministry of Rites, got into the carriage, and returned to the King Jing Mansion.Once he entered Anyin Hall, he saw people coming and going. Meng Qianshan happened to send two tailors out with cloth in their arms. Seeing that Jiang Suizhou had returned home, Meng Qianshan quickly welcomed him.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Meng Qianshan approached him grinning from ear to ear. \u201cI\u2019ve already brought Madam Huo here for you, and I\u2019ve just asked the tailors to sew clothes for him. Tomorrow, the craftsman will come. I think his wheelchair is shoddy, so it should be replaced.\u201dJiang Suizhou looked at him with some confusion.\u2026I haven\u2019t said anything yet. Why is this kid so enthusiastic about Huo Wujiu?But Meng Qianshan\u2019s eyes sparkled at him, as if waiting for his praise.Jiang Suizhou paused: \u201c\u2026Hmm, not bad.\u201dMeng Qianshan was instantly happy.Jiang Suizhou felt blindsided by his silliness. He turned around and walked towards his room.He walked at a relaxed pace as he tugged off his cloak that was in the way. Just as he stepped into the threshold, he suddenly remembered something. He was about to turn around to ask which room Huo Wujiu had been assigned to, when the man himself entered into his vision.The man was sitting in a wheelchair surrounded by elegance and luxury, which made him seem particularly out of place.Jiang Suizhou stopped undressing.\u2026Huo Wujiu.How could Huo Wujiu be in his room?!He froze in place, and after a moment, abruptly turned around and stormed off.He bumped into an ambiguous and joyful Meng Qianshan. His face was brimming with reserved smiles, waiting for his compliments.Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth.\u2026Praise you? I wish I could beat you up.\u201cMaster?\u201d Seeing Jiang Suizhou staring at him, Meng Qianshan smiled, waiting for him to speak.Jiang Suizhou paused for a moment and whispered, \u201c\u2026Is this what you arranged?\u201dMeng Qianshan froze, and then it dawned on him.\u201cAh, yes! Look at me, I forgot. Madam Huo came here, but there is no one to serve him yet!\u201d He said. \u201cI expelled the two maids from the mansion who were originally arranged for him. Currently, there\u2019s only a young manservant left, but he seems to be honest. Your Highness, you see\u2026\u201dMeng Qianshan halted there, waiting for Jiang Suizhou\u2019s instructions.Jiang Suizhou was livid.Who asked you this! I am asking you why Huo Wujiu is living in my room!Is it possible that no other place is habitable in such a huge courtyard?!When the words reached his mouth, he moved his lips, but no words came out.The door was wide open, and Huo Wujiu was inside, so he could definitely hear whatever he would say.If Jiang Suizhou brought him here and then kicked him out, wouldn\u2019t he offend him again?\u2026I originally made this decision thinking that it could reduce the difficulty a little, but I didn\u2019t expect this foolish Meng Qianshan to lift it to a hellish level.Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth, glared fiercely at Meng Qianshan, and swallowed the words at the edge of his mouth.\u201cThere\u2019s one left?\u201d He picked up where Meng Qianshan left off and said, \u201cWhere is he? I want to go see him.\u201dMeng Qianshan smiled and hurriedly led him down the steps.The people in the courtyard were busy, and the manservant was moving things with others. Beads of sweat reflecting the light in the sun dripped down his forehead from over exertion.When he saw Jiang Suizhou coming, he hurriedly put down his things and bowed to him.Jiang Suizhou stopped in his tracks and remembered something else.He surmised that the reason Huo Wujiu was able to escape from here after three years was definitely because an insider was coordinating with the outside. However, the original owner would have never provided him with this opportunity, which was why it dragged on for three full years.But\u2026what if Jiang Suizhou helped him?Wouldn\u2019t that be a big favor to him and save himself from having to deal with Pang Shao\u2019s group for another two years?He pondered for a moment and said to the young manservant, \u201cCome with me.\u201dThis was to give him some private instructions.The manservant hurriedly followed, and Meng Qianshan had the good sense to stay where he was.Unbeknownst to everyone, a pair of pitch-black eyes fell on Jiang Suizhou\u2019s back through the gap in the window pane.He watched as Jiang Suizhou sought out his sidekick and took him to the side to talk alone.As a King, what could he say to a young manservant?It was definitely to ask him to do something. Huo Wujiu was well aware that the servant, apart from spying on him, couldn\u2019t do anything else.Why exactly did he suddenly move him to his residence?\u2026The answer seemed self-explanatory.He was in the most heavily guarded place in the King\u2019s residence.As for why he was living in the main house\u2026the look of surprise in King Jing\u2019s eyes alone when he came in just now told him that his men had made the wrong arrangements.Huo Wujiu prided himself on his calmness, never letting petty gains affect his reason, let alone losing judgment because his opponent was showing him a bit of goodwill.His face was expressionless and his gaze cold and bland, as he quietly watched the man\u2019s every move outside the window.He rested his hand on his wheelchair, and his fingertips tapped on the armrest twice with some annoyance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He scanned the empty surroundings, then spoke.\"What's your name?\" He asked.The manservant hurriedly wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, \"My name is Sun Yuan, Your Highness.\"Jiang Suizhou nodded and then gave him a few instructions.It was nothing more than telling him to serve carefully and not to make any mistakes.The manservant appeared honest and timid. While listening to Jiang Suizhou-, he kept squeezing the corners of his coat.Jiang Suizhou scrutinized his every move.Such a simple and honest man was quite suitable.After a pause, Jiang Suizhou opened his mouth and asked, \"Since yesterday when serving Madam Huo's side, has anyone ever asked you to bring anything to him?\"Sun Yuan was stunned, then a look of fright took over his face as he waved his hands repeatedly.\"N-No!\"That meant yes.Jiang Suizhou took everything into \u00a0consideration and realized something. Although Huo Wujiu was a person of the Northern Liang, his father was a general of the Southern Jing. Some people dealt with him in the court, so it wasn\u2019t surprising if there were one or two secretly making moves.Jiang Suizhou nodded: \"Even if there is, I will not punish you.\"Sun Yuan said in a panic: \"Your Highness, someone asked me to bring a letter, but I refused!\"Jiang Suizhou tried his best to put on a pleasant look, and said lightly, \"So there is?\"Sun Yuan was so scared that his legs went weak.He knew it. His Highness must have had a purpose for suddenly pulling him aside! Who didn't know who Madam Huo was originally? How could Sun Yuan dare to correspond with outsiders on his behalf? But unexpectedly, His Highness had guessed correctly. Hence, whether Sun Yuan had helped deliver the letter or not, he must be silenced\u2026The calmer His Highness's voice was, the more Sun Yuan felt that something terrible was about to happen, which made his legs weaken in fear.\u201cYes, there is...but I-I will never\u2026\u201d\"The next time someone sends a letter, you give it to Madam Huo. You don\u2019t have to report it,\" Jiang Suizhou said.After all, Huo Wujiu was not stupid. If a letter was so smoothly delivered to him, not to mention in Jiang Suizhou's courtyard, someone must have deliberately done it. Huo Wujiu definitely would be suspicious.Sun Yuan, who was halfway through his speech, was dumbfounded.\u201cI will never...huh?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe his ears.Jiang Suizhou paused and restored that icy serious look.\"Just do as you're told and don't tell anyone,\" he returned.\"You should know what happens...if you ever tip anyone off.\u201d\u2014\u2014After intimidating Sun Yuan a bit, Jiang Suizhou walked away with his hands behind his back.The mess in his room was all Meng Qianshan\u2019s foolish doing. Jiang Suizhou took a glance at the room and felt a headache coming on. The thought of Huo Wujiu sitting in the room made him reluctant to go back.He promptly decided to pass by the door of the room without entering and go to hide in the study for a while.With that in mind, he calmly walked up the steps, then went around the corridor toward the study.But at that moment, he caught a glimpse of Huo Wujiu in the room out of the corner of his eye.Huo Wujiu was the most out of place amidst the lively, bustling room, sitting in a wheelchair in the corner as silent as a grave.Huo Wujiu was born beautiful, but his eyes were a bit fierce. Every time he looked at people, he always frightened them in a snap.But this time, Huo Wujiu dropped his eyes pensively. His long eyelashes covered that fierce glint. For a moment, he seemed so quiet, as if entirely detached from the world around him.Jiang Suizhou stopped in his tracks.Just then, a maid carrying a box passed by Huo Wujiu's side, and inadvertently kicked Huo Wujiu's wheelchair.Huo Wujiu only swayed slightly, but the maid stumbled from the bump and almost dropped the box.The maid stood still and complained loudly, \"Why are you getting in the way? Don't you know to sit farther away?\"With that, she glared at Huo Wujiu and walked away.Jiang Suizhou frowned.His feet uncontrollably turned away from the study, and he crossed the threshold of the main room and walked in.\"What did you just say?\" He asked with a frown.Why were these people, whose names he didn\u2019t even know, so good at making trouble for him? He was trying every means to secretly please Huo Wujiu, but this group of people were doing the exact opposite. They were openly bullying him!The servants in the room were all stunned and looked towards Jiang Suizhou.They saw Jiang Suizhou's icy eyes fixed on the maid.The maid holding the box was startled. The moment she saw Jiang Suizhou looking at her, she immediately realized that he heard her words. She did not dare to argue. She hugged the box and kneeled in front of Jiang Suizhou with a thud.He looked at the maid with downcast eyes and said coldly, \"Do you know you're wrong?\"The servant girl nodded her head repeatedly and answered yes.Jiang Suizhou then asked, \"To whom should you confess your mistake?\"The maid hurriedly put down the box, kneeled down in front of Huo Wugou, and kowtowed to him: \"I was momentarily rude. Please forgive me, Madam!\"But Huo Wujiu sat there, leaning sideways without even raising his eyes, as if everything in front of him had nothing to do with him.Jiang Suizhou faltered.He knew that this maid deserved punishment for saying such things. But...At this time, Meng Qianshan was not by his side. He had just arrived, and he still didn't know the rules of the mansion about punishing servants. He did not know how severe the penalty should be, and as a modern man, it went against his morals to issue an order to have her kneel or be beaten.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 13.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 13.2After a moment\u2019s contemplation, he said indifferently, \"Go find Meng Qianshan and receive punishment.\"The maid hastened to salute him.Jiang Suizhou found that the roomful of servants were silent and dared not make noise, so he thought his reprimand was useful. At least the people in this courtyard would no longer dare to bully Huo Wujiu easily anymore.He breathed a sigh of relief, turned and left.He did what he had to do, and now, he was going to the study to enjoy a happy time without Huo Wujiu.But he didn't see that after he left, the maid who was kneeling on the ground revealed a look of resignation.Her name was Tao Zhi. His Highness originally thought highly of her in this room, and except for Meng Qianshan, she usually attended to His Highness.She never imagined that His Highness would reprimand her for such a cripple, so it was quite humiliating.However, although His Highness lectured her on such a big mistake, he did not punish her personally, so she assumed that her master still cherished her. He just happened to hear and so reprimanded her a bit.She looked up and coldly glanced at Huo Wujiu.It was all this cripple's fault.Jiang Suizhou also did not see how cold Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes were hidden beneath his drooping eyelashes, as he sat in the corner.When Jiang Suizhou walked out of the room, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and gave him a cool, icy look.He just thought King Jing was quite funny.If King Jing wanted to send people to spy on him, he should just do it directly; why bother to pretend to defend him in front of him?...He even put on a play, spending the night in front of my bed.These actions were unnecessary.\u2014\u2014Night had fallen, and it was time for dinner.The King entered the study and dismissed everyone from the room, even Eunuch Qianshan was no exception, but this was nothing unusual. Usually, when the King was busy, he disliked disturbance from others.Because there was now an additional master in the room, the kitchen still prepared the evening meal one after another, even when the King had not come out of the study.In a short while, someone sent news.\u201cTwo Sirs have invited His Highness to dinner, so His Highness isn\u2019t going to eat in the house today,\u201d a young servant reported.Meng Qianshan was waiting outside the study room, so Tao Zhi had the final say in the room. The maids looked at her one after another. They saw her looking around, her eyes finally falling contemptuously on Huo Wujiu.He was currently sitting under the window, reading a book in his hand.\"Then what are you still standing there for? Serve the meal.\" She said coldly. \"His Highness is not going to eat in the house today, so do you want to starve the master in the room?\"The people around her did not dare to provoke her. At her order, they went about their business.Seeing this, Sun Yuan, who was waiting next to Huo Wujiu, hurriedly stepped forward to push Huo Wujiu's wheelchair, leading him to the table.Huo Wujiu didn't say anything, only put the book aside.Only he knew how much he hated reading books.Huo Wujiu grew up annoyed at the sight of words, so he either skipped class to ride horses in the barracks, or found ways to torment the teacher for fun. When he was around seven or eight years old, two teachers quit in a fury. Yangguan was remote, and it was difficult to find a teacher, so his father chased him angrily with a horse whip for a long time.Even now, he had a headache after reading a book. But laughable as it might be, he couldn't do anything else now other than flip through the things that gave him headaches.Huo Wujiu glanced at the book.After Sun Yuan saw him put down his book, he pushed Huo Wujiu\u2019s wheelchair to the table.Several dishes were already laid out on the table, and Tao Zhi had also given the word earlier, so hot dishes were brought in one after another. The evening meal was very rich and exquisite because it was prepared with Jiang Suizhou in mind. The dishes were warm and appetizing under the bright lights.Tao Zhi stood watching, her face as cold as frost.She was born beautiful, and when she came to the royal residence, even the dealer said that she might become a concubine if she was lucky. Then she could rise from servant to master.She climbed step by step to her present position, but did not realize that her master only liked men.What was so great about men? \u00a0Even if he was a man, Madam Gu was nothing more than that. Yet how could the tall and big cripple in front of her still get into her master's harem?!Because of the disgrace Tao Zhi suffered this afternoon, she became more displeased the more she looked at Huo Wujiu.What was the use of his beauty? What was the use of being a general? He was maimed and had to go to someone's harem to serve men, Tao Zhi thought with hatred.Just then, a maid came with soup. When she crossed the threshold, she was careless and almost spilled it....Besides, His Highness was not here tonight.Tao Zhi walked forward with a cold face and took the soup with one hand.\"Why are you so rash?\" She gave the maid a cross look.The maid apologized evenly.But she saw Tao Zhi give her a glaring quick glance, and with the soup in her hand, she turned around and walked towards the table.The next moment, she rather deliberately bumped into the table, and tipped the bowl of hot soup downward, pouring all the content onto Huo Wujiu's lap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 14.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 14.1The steam rose, and the whole bowl of soup was suddenly splashed all over Huo Wujiu's legs, dripping down along the fabric of his robe.The maids all around the room cried out in alarm. Sun Yuan at the back also jumped up in shock and hurriedly grabbed a cloth towel to help wipe him.Huo Wujiu was the only one sitting there motionless.Even if the boiling hot soup spilled on his robe and not directly on his skin, it still hurt.But the pain of the flesh was nothing to him. He only lowered his eyes and looked at his legs.He watched as she deliberately poured the soup over him. That move in the eyes of martial arts practitioners was the most clumsy slow motion, but he could not avoid it.Because his legs could not move.This kind of humiliation was much harder to endure than physical pain.A moment later, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and gave Tao Zhi a faint look.If she hadn't been a woman, he would have returned the hot soup a hundredfold, pouring it all down her throat.But he would never raise his hand against a woman.However, this cold and sinister glance also made Tao Zhi shiver with fright, and she retreated back involuntarily.Then, she came back to her senses.What was she doing? This cripple glared at her, and she actually got scared?What was so scary about him? The King was not in the residence today anyway! She was the only one in the courtyard who had the final say right now. She didn't believe that other servants dared to rat her out to the King, nor did she believe that this cripple had the face to go to the King to complain!Tao Zhi immediately glared back and sneered: \"Blame me for being careless and tripping accidentally. It's just that Master didn't know how to dodge. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have been scalded.\"Then, she raised her eyes and looked at Sun Yuan at the back of the room.\"Why are you so stupid, you servant? I asked you to serve here and push Master\u2019s wheelchair. What are you doing standing there? Since you\u2019re so stupid, you should go out and sweep the yard tomorrow!\"The King usually stayed in Anyin Hall for a short time, and Meng Qianshan would accompany him everywhere he went, so she was used to playing the tyrant in this courtyard.Naturally, she scolded everyone around her to her heart\u2019s content. After the scolding, a few bolder ones would step forward to pacify her and smooth things over.However, this time, when she finished scolding, the room was so quiet that even a pin drop could be heard.She took a few breaths and looked around with a frown.The room was full of maids, each with their heads hung low, like a group of quails.Tao Zhi sized them up and frowned unhappily.What? Was it because a concubine was in the room today that they were scared like this? He was just a cripple who couldn't even walk. What was so scary about him?She snorted coldly and turned around to leave.But just as she whirled around, she spotted two people standing in front of the door of the room.Tao Zhi's legs went limp, and she dropped on her knees.\u201cY-Your Highness!\u201d\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou stayed in the study until twilight.An invitation was sent to him early, and two officials from the Ministry of Works invited him out to drink at night. Jiang Suizhou was new to this place and didn't even know how well he could drink, so he weighed his options and chose to abstain from the banquet.He stalled for a while and simply asked Meng Qianshan to personally take the post back, saying that he did not sleep well last night and caught a cold; he was recovering at home today.Fortunately, he was notoriously known for being sick, so the excuse went quite well, and the two did not press the issue any further.After dealing with this matter, Jiang Suizhou left the study.Although his room was now stuffed with a ferocious sick tiger, he couldn\u2019t take this excuse to skip dinner.To his surprise, just as he reached the door of his main room, he happened to hear Tao Zhi reproaching Huo Wujiu cryptically.The maid was standing in front of the table, blocking Huo Wujiu, who was sitting in his wheelchair. She stood with arms akimbo, and her shrill voice could be heard from a distance.When Meng Qianshan saw this picture, his face changed drastically. He was about to speak, but Jiang Suizhou raised hand to stop him.Although Jiang Suizhou couldn't see the maid\u2019s face, he could tell from her clothing that she was the one who bumped into Huo Wujiu when carrying a box at noon today. He thought that she would no longer dare to act out after he had scolded her, but he didn't expect this maid to be so arrogant.Jiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t tell if she thought her own life was too long or if she had lived long enough.He just quietly watched her arrogantly fly off the handle, and then watched her turn around and look at him in surprise. Then her legs went jelly in fright, and she collapsed to the ground.Jiang Suizhou looked at her shivering appearance, a little speechless.What was the use of being afraid now? Why didn't she know how to be afraid when facing the fiendish-looking Huo Wujiu just now?He had always loathed people with these deep-rooted bad habits.As a man transmigrating back a thousand years, he thought he retained the respect he should have for life and personality. However, there were some people who were respected for their personality, but wanted to trample on others'; originally, they were enslaved, but turned their heads to put on a superior air to enslave others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you still remember that Madam Huo is the master? Seeing you like this, it seems that you regard yourself as the master!\"Tao Zhi tremblingly kowtowed one after another and hastily resorted to sophistry, \"Your Highness, this servant hasn\u2019t! I-It\u2019s the manservant, pushing Madam\u2019s wheelchair! He pushed the wheelchair and bumped into me, so I accidentally spilled the soup on Madam...\"\u201cAm I blind?\u201dJiang Suizhou scowled and interrupted her.Tao Zhi shivered in terror. She kowtowed and knelt on the ground, not daring to raise her head.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze and said indifferently, \"Meng Qianshan.\"Meng Qianshan immediately understood, and said: \"Are you still going to keep her here to obstruct His Highness's eyes? Drag her out!\"Immediately, two servants from the corridor came forward and dragged Tao Zhi away.Jiang Suizhou knew that Meng Qianshan would handle it for him. He massaged his brow and walked to Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu\u2019s legs were wet, and the soup bowl next to him was still steaming.Being splashed with a bowl of soup was extremely humiliating. What was more, the maid splashed it deliberately on Huo Wujiu's leg, which was like sprinkling a handful of salt on someone\u2019s wound.Looking at him sitting in a wheelchair without saying a word, Jiang Suizhou inexplicably felt choked up.He struggled to withdraw his gaze.He had let the man suffer here, so he definitely couldn\u2019t do nothing. Nonetheless, as a proud and cold King, he couldn't just apologize to him either.Jiang Suizhou had a headache.He paused and said, \"Go, first push the Madam to the back to change into a clean robe.\"He needed to organize his thoughts.Sun Yuan immediately responded, pushing the wheelchair behind the screen in the inner room.Jiang Suizhou sat down at the table, raised his hand and rubbed his forehead.He was planning to stay quiet when he saw Sun Yuan, who had just gone behind the screen, coming back alone again.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes: \"What's the matter?\"Sun Yuan stood there empty-handed and at a loss: \"Madam said, there is no need for a servant.\"Jiang Suizhou's gaze involuntarily fell on the screen.He could vaguely see a seated figure through the screen.He paused, grunted in reply, and said nothing more.For some reason, he could clearly understand Huo Wujiu\u2019s mood at this time. Because he has studied history for nearly a decade, and wrote several papers on Huo Wujiu alone, he knew that Huo Wujiu didn't need anyone.Even if Huo Wujiu was crippled, he did not need others to take care of him as one would a disabled person. He was a falcon born in the sandstorms of Yangguan, with an irrepressible vitality, and was especially independent and proud.He wasn\u2019t so easy to kill, but it was even harder to keep him in a cage and serve him feasts of delectable dishes every day.He didn\u2019t need these either.Jiang Suizhou pondered. He was supposed to think about his wording and countermeasures for a while, but his mind drifted away uncontrollably.The room was quiet, except for the faint sound of clothes rustling and the sound of the wheelchair shifting behind the screen.Not long after, Huo Wujiu changed into a clean robe and emerged from behind the screen while steering his wheelchair.Sun Yuan hurriedly went forward to push his wheelchair for him.Huo Wujiu had no clothes to change into here, and none of the several masters in the mansion had such a tall figure as he did. He was now wearing a makeshift rough top and trousers worn by servants.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes to look at him.This man was handsome and a walking mannequin. It was obviously just gray, coarse clothes, but on him, it exuded a warrior's aura.Sun Yuan quickly pushed Huo Wujiu's wheelchair to the table. Jiang Suizhou picked up the chopsticks and stole a glance at Huo Wujiu.He remembered that Huo Wujiu still had injuries on his legs. Although they were on his calves, they were also likely splashed by the hot soup.But looking at Huo Wugou's silent demeanor, Jiang Suizhou lost his confidence.If nothing was wrong with him, it would be inappropriate to call for a doctor rashly. However, he knew that Huo Wujiu was particularly forbearing. Whether he was truly scalded or not, Jiang Suizhou was not quite sure\u2026With that in mind, he couldn't help but peek at Huo Wujiu a few more times.But at that moment, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes at him, catching his sneaky gaze with precision.Jiang Suizhou averted his eyes in an attempt to cover up, but unwittingly exposed himself. Huo Wujiu, on the other hand, remained poker-faced, quietly looking straight at him, seemingly waiting for him to speak....I was caught red-handed. There\u2019s no hiding it.Jiang Suizhou cleared his throat, and while chucking vegetables, he spoke faintly, \"Were your bandages soaked?\"\"No,\" Huo Wujiu replied.His voice was quite low and nice, diffused in the night, like a mellow liquor.Jiang Suizhou gave a faint grunt.\"That person has taken things too far and won\u2019t reappear here in the future,\" he informed.Huo Wugou didn't make a sound.Jiang Suizhou also did not expect him to respond to him and only signaled Meng Qianshan.Meng Qianshan quickly nodded and bowed: \"Don't worry, Master! There will be no more next time!\"Jiang Suizhou gave an \u201cHmm\u201d and said no more.He thought to himself that he should show a guilty stance because of today's incident, and then slowly change his attitude towards him.As for the people in the room, there was no need to worry. After today's incident, no one would dare to neglect Huo Wujiu again.He knew that Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t need this kind of care, but he needed to use this to shine a light on his attitude - at least let Huo Wujiu know that although he didn't like him, Jiang Suizhou had no intention of targeting him.The meal was extremely silent.When the meal was finished, the maids took the dishes off the table and went to the inner room to clean up.The books that His Highness read at night and the beds that the masters slept on must be properly organized.Jiang Suizhou sat by, holding a book in his hand and watching Meng Qianshan lead the servants to the bedroom to tidy up.His gaze was a little stiff.Today, he was too comfortable being alone in the study, so he accidentally forgot about this important matter.His gaze fell on Huo Wujiu who was beside him, and lowered his eyes heavily, looking at the book in his hand....If Huo Wujiu sleeps in my bedroom, where am I going to sleep?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then glanced at the inner room.Madam Huo was washing and cleaning up alone there.Meng Qianshan replied with a meaningful glance and led everyone to retreat.No servant was left in the room, and before leaving, Meng Qianshan \u00a0also thoughtfully closed the door for Jiang Suizhou.Everyone withdrew, and in a blink, the large room was dead silent, with only the sound of splashing water in the inner room.There was no one else.Jiang Suizhou let out a sigh of relief. He relaxingly put the book down, and slumped onto the couch.It was too sad. Jiang Suizhou thought he would only use the couch for one night, but he did not expect that he would not have the opportunity to sleep on a bed again after transmigrating.He inwardly formulated a plan.He must improve Huo Wujiu\u2019s impression of him and earn his trust as soon as possible, and then find an opportunity to quickly expel him from his room.But until then...he couldn\u2019t escape the fate of sleeping on the couch.After calming down on the couch for a while, Jiang Suizhou resignedly picked up the book and sat up straight again.He held the book in one hand, but could not register the contents. After reading two lines, he involuntarily lowered his head and patted the couch beneath him.Hmm...Fortunately, the couch in my room feels quite comfortable.With that in mind, he propped himself up on the couch again with one hand and looked behind him.It was quite wide and around a meter and a half. He was sure he could use it for naps during the day. There were several pillows that looked pretty solid against the backrest, so he didn\u2019t know whether they were soft or not.Jiang Suizhou leaned forward, grabbed one in his hand, and squeezed it a few times.Eh, quite soft.Jiang Suizhou grew up with no worries about food and clothing, and never thought he would one day be happy to have a couch to sleep on with comfortable pillows for him to use....In fact, I wasn\u2019t able to sleep soundly on the first two days, so sitting on this couch is somewhat of a stress reliever.The corners of Jiang Suizhou\u2019s mouth couldn't help but curl into a smile at the soft touch in his hand, then he squeezed the pillow some more.Suddenly, a creak sounded.Jiang Suizhou was caught off guard. He was startled and turned his head on instinct.He realized that Huo Wujiu emerged from the inner room at some point, and was sitting at the door of the inner room. His pair of pitch-black eyes locked quietly on Jiang Suizhou.The creak came from his wheelchair.Jiang Suizhou tossed the pillow away....I was too relaxed just now and forgot for a moment that there was another person in the room!Jiang Suizhou was suddenly at a loss for words. He grabbed his book in one hand and hurriedly sat up straight. But behind him, the original neatly stacked pillows had been tossed around, and a quick glance revealed what he had just done.Jiang Suizhou was so embarrassed that his scalp began to tingle.But fortunately, Huo Wujiu was still indifferent to him.Huo Wujiu's eyes didn't linger on Jiang Suizhou for long. Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t care about what he did in the slightest. He only swept a faint glance over him, then turned his eyes away and steered his wheelchair out.Jiang Suizhou suddenly felt grateful for his perpetual indifference.Jiang Suizhou cleared his throat and propped one hand on his forehead, posing as if nothing had happened while blocking the expression in his eyes.His eyes were dead set on his book, and he spoke coldly, \"Go to bed.\"After saying that, he never looked up again.Although he put on the appearance of concentrating on his book, Jiang Suizhou's ears were a hundred percent on alert, tuning in to Huo Wujiu's movements.He heard Huo Wujiu swing his wheelchair to the side of the bed and listened to him slowly crawl into bed. Then, Huo Wujiu laid down quietly and did not make another sound.Jiang Suizhou heaved a sigh of relief.He thought inwardly: As long as Huo Wujiu doesn't mention it, what do I have to be embarrassed about? I'm not embarrassed.But this brainwashing was futile. Afterward, for most of the hour, he could not register a single word of the book in his hand and kept replaying what just happened.Huo Wujiu probably didn\u2019t see the way he squeezed his pillow like a fool, right? The sound Jiang Suizhou heard just now was the rattling of the wheelchair, which meant that Huo Wujiu just came out at that time and did not necessarily see what he was doing\u2026Jiang Suizhou\u2019s was having a war deep inside, wishing his stare could dig a hole in his book. He was oblivious to the light glance that Huo Wujiu, who was lying on the bed, gave him.When Jiang Suizhou lowered his head and covered his face in mortification, all this fell into Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes.A rabbit in a fox's skin accidentally revealed his short little tail.The corner of Huo Wujiu's lips twitched.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, as soon as he touched the pillow, he sunk into a deep sleep, and had a dreamless night.Until the day dawned.Jiang Suizhou was sleeping when he felt someone carefully patting him. When he opened his eyes, he saw a shocked Meng Qianshan standing in the hazy morning light.Fright instantly awakened Jiang Suizhou.He sat up and saw Meng Qianshan bowing in front of him with an envelope in one hand. With a surprised look, he glanced at the bed, then at Jiang Suizhou, and spoke in a stammering voice, \"Master, why are you sleeping in...\"Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth and lowered his voice to interrupt him, \"Is something the matter?\"This Meng Qianshan was fine everywhere else, but he was a bit foolish.What other servant would, having seen his master sleeping on the couch, ask him, \u201cWhy are you sleeping on the sofa?\u201d!Meng Qianshan froze, handed the envelope to Jiang Suizhou, and said, \"This came last night...\"Jiang Suizhou paused and immediately raised his hand, signaling Meng Qianshan to shut his mouth first.He glanced at Huo Wujiu on the bed.At this time, the sky was only slightly bright, and it was far from time to get up. Huo Wujiu looked to be sound asleep, so their talking would surely wake him up.Meng Qianshan followed Jiang Suizhou's line of sight and instantly understood.Meng Qianshan hurriedly and soundlessly followed Jiang Suizhou outside.The two of them walked all the way outside of the bedroom and closed the door before they spoke again.\"What is it?\" Jiang Suizhou asked.Meng Qianshan handed him the envelope in his hand and said, \"Your Highness, the two lords who asked you to have a drink last night asked someone to secretly deliver this before dawn this morning, saying that they had intended to hand it to you yesterday, but you were unwell, so they rushed to deliver it today.\"Jiang Suizhou took the envelope.He had a rough idea what it contained. The two people who had asked him to drink yesterday were both minor officials of the Ministry of Works. He believed that the information they had sent him was most likely related to the repair of the ancestral hall.He took the envelope, gave a hum, and turned around to leave.But at this moment, Meng Qianshan actually stepped forward and stopped him.Jiang Suizhou frowned at him, then saw righteous indignation written all over Meng Qianshan\u2019s face.\"How can Madam Huo let you sleep on the couch?!\"Jiang Suizhou was a bit speechless.How dare you ask! I interrupted you so you wouldn\u2019t say anything, yet you still asked!Jiang Suizhou answered indifferently, \"Is it your business?\" Then, he turned around in an attempt to go inside.But he saw Meng Qianshan face death unflinchingly.\u201cIt should be none of my business, but Your Highness is so sick and weak. How can I allow him to bully you to this extent!\"Jiang Suizhou could hear the tremor in Meng Qianshan\u2019s voice. At first glance, he was scared. But he forcibly stopped himself and whispered, \"Is Madam Huo bullying you because of his superior martial arts skills? Your Highness, don't be afraid, this is not their Northern Liang, where he can run wild...\"Jiang Suizhou helplessly raised his hand and cut his words short.He knew of Meng Qianshan\u2019s sincere loyalty, but this man...he really had a one-track mind!Jiang Suizhou asked coldly, \"Why are you shooting in the dark? Mind your own business.\"After saying that, he went around Meng Qianshan and pushed the door of the room open.But behind him, Meng Qianshan's voice sounded aggrieved and puzzled.\u201cYour Highness is sleeping on the couch. Why do you want to get this person into your courtyard?\"...If I don't make it clear, is there no way to get over this?Jiang Suizhou took a deep breath, closed the room door and turned around.\u201cI want to sleep by myself,\u201d he said.Meng Qianshan was filled with surprise.Then he saw his own master's face as frosty as ice as he spoke stiffly, \"Although he is a concubine, my heart fell for him, and I do not want to insult him at will. Understand?\"Meng Qianshan's eyes were about to pop out: \"You, Your Highness! But you only...you only met him for the first time two days ago!\"\u2026.And now you also got to the bottom of it.Jiang Suizhou just wanted to quickly fool this rash young man, and made up nonsense, \"How do you know it was the first time? When the Marquis of Dingbei returned to the capital, I had seen him at that time and had long been attracted to him. Since then...time has passed, and although I have not seen him in person, I frequently received news about him.\u201dMeng Qianshan was dumbfounded.It was obvious to Jiang Suizhou that Meng Qianshan believed him, so he stopped talking and warned, \"No one else knows about this matter, and I haven\u2019t revealed a hint of it in front of Madam Huo. Therefore, even if you know, you must keep it to yourself. Remember?\"Meng Qianshan's eyes were frozen straight at this point, and he nodded his head stupidly.Jiang Suizhou faintly glanced at him, turned around and pushed the door open again.It was still early, and instead of arguing with Meng Qianshan there, he might as well go back and sleep for another half an hour.With this in mind, he gingerly returned to his couch. As he was lying down, he did not forget to shoot Huo Wujiu a few glances.Huo Wujiu remained motionless and still hadn\u2019t awakened.Jiang Suizhou laid down in relief and closed his eyes.Unbeknownst to him, the moment he closed his eyes, a pair of pitch-black eyes slowly opened in the darkness.The man frowned, his face brimming with surprise. His eyes fell on Jiang Suizhou\u2019s back with extreme complexity.What Jiang Suizhou didn't know was that Huo Wujiu had been in the army for many years, and even in his sleep, the slightest noise could wake him up immediately.He also didn't know that Huo Wujiu had extremely sharp eyes and keen ears. Even through the door, even when he lowered his voice, Huo Wujiu heard every word he said.Not a single word was left out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, he got up early, and Meng Qianshan prepared breakfast in advance.Huo Wujiu also got up very early.Although they shared the same bedroom, there was basically no communication between them. Meng Qianshan waited for Jiang Suizhou to finish washing up, while Huo Wujiu went to the inner room to clean up. When Huo Wujiu returned with his wheelchair, Sun Yuan pushed his wheelchair to the table.The breakfast meal was already on the table, and Jiang Suizhou was sitting there reading a book.He didn't necessarily have to wait for Huo Wujiu to eat together, but the table manners ingrained in him since childhood forced him to wait for everyone to gather before he could start eating.Upon seeing Huo Wujiu, Jiang Suizhou put down his book and automatically picked up his chopsticks.Even when they were eating breakfast together, they looked at each other without saying anything.But today, Jiang Suizhou had a feeling that something was wrong.He felt like Huo Wujiu kept sizing him up, but whenever he looked at him, Huo Wujiu was eating with his eyes down. He didn't even spare him a glance at all.It was quite weird.But Meng Qianshan, who was waiting on the side, caught his master peeking at Madam Huo all morning. He only took it as his master being unable to help himself in front of his sweetheart.At this time, as a qualified servant, he naturally shared his master's worries.With these thoughts in mind, Meng Qianshan smilingly spoke, \"Master, a carpenter has already come yesterday. I remember you had mentioned that Madam's wheelchair was not working well, so I asked him to hurry up. The new wheelchair will be delivered to our courtyard within the day.\"Jiang Suizhou looked up and saw Meng Qianshan blinking at him vigorously.It was a no-brainer. This kid was showing off for Jiang Suizhou in front of Huo Wujiu, making innuendos to inform Huo Wujiu how good Jiang Suizhou was to him.Jiang Suizhou was somewhat speechless. However, on second thought, all roads lead to Rome. Just say Meng Qianshan was pleasing Huo Wujiu on his behalf.So, he grunted and replied offhandedly, \u201cNot bad. If it arrives early, take it out for a spin and try it out to see if it works.\"Just as well. Anyway, he worked in the Ministry of Rites while this bigmouth Meng Qianshan was also idle; might as well let him help Jiang Suizhou push Huo Wujiu out for a breath of fresh air.Meng Qianshan agreed with a broad grin.\"If Your Highness comes back early, we can also go out for a walk together!\" He said....That\u2019s asking for too much.Jiang Suizhou glanced at him warningly.Meng Qianshan promptly shut his mouth with a grin.But as Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze, he suddenly collided with Huo Wujiu's gaze.Huo Wujiu was looking at him. His eyes were still cold, but there were dashes of complexities that Jiang Suizhou couldn't understand.Huo Wujiu\u2019s brow was also furrowed.Jiang Suizhou was caught off guard. Huo Wujiu averted his eyes and didn\u2019t look at him again.Jiang Suizhou was momentarily dazed.Er...Did he provoke him with what he just said?\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou didn't bother to care what was wrong with Huo Wujiu. After breakfast, he went straight to the Ministry of Rites\u2019 office to slack off.Only the extremely diligent Meng Qianshan was left behind to serve Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu coldly watched Meng Qianshan bustling around him until the carpenter who sent the wheelchair arrived. The eunuch left temporarily, finally allowing Huo Wujiu to clear his mind for the time being.He raised his hand and rubbed his temples.Meng Qianshan was so noisy.Just then, Sun Yuan, who had been waiting behind him, cautiously stepped forward and slipped something into his hand.Huo Wujiu looked up at him and saw that Sun Yuan was stiff, and nervousness was almost written on his face.\"This is..Someone asked me to give it to you,\" Sun Yuan lowered his voice and stuttered.He had never done anything like this before, and it was too much for him to handle.The day before he pushed Madam Huo to the courtyard, someone stopped him on his way out of the house and slipped a silver ingot to bring a letter to Madam Huo.What kind of person was His Highness, and what kind of person was Madam Huo? He naturally did not dare to do it. He hastily refused and ran. Fortunately, that person was not a vicious person. When Sun Yuan refused, he didn't force him nor silence him.As a result, His Highness instructed the next day that any letters and articles, as long as someone sent them, should be given to Madam Huo in private.This in turn scared Sun Yuan silly.However, he dared not go against the King\u2019s command.Last night, Sun Yuan met the man again on his way home from the residence.\"Just think of it as me begging you to send this letter in,\" the man said. \"General Huo is not an imprudent man. Just deliver it, and he will not leave any evidence behind to implicate you.\"Sun Yuan halted.S-Since the King ordered it\u2026Seeing him hesitate, hope immediately surfaced on the man's face: \"What about it? I can add more money; this is negotiable!\"Sun Yuan had always been honest, so upon hearing this, he stammered in fright.I-It wasn\u2019t about money either. However, it seemed that Sun Yuan couldn\u2019t just say that it was the King who asked him to deliver the letter\u2026Sun Yuan stammered for a moment and then replied, \"Okay, pay me more.\"The man hurriedly asked, \"How much?\"\u201c...Add two more silver coins, I guess.\u201dThe man: \u201c...?\u201dSo, ridden with the doubt of \"how did this man raise the price so affordably\", the man handed the letter over to Sun Yuan, who in turn handed it to Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu glanced at the envelope in his hand and raised his head. His scrutinizing gaze fell on Sun Yuan.Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze made Sun Yuan feel so guilty that he didn\u2019t risk taking a breath. Sun Yuan just stood there like a bamboo pole.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But, thinking about King Jing\u2019s performance in the past few days, it really did seem to be the case\u2026There seemed to be an explanation to his sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing appearance, his attempts at being fierce and tough, and his inexplicable good treatment of Huo Wujiu.But\u2026King Jing just had to insist on stirring some messy thoughts, huh. These past few days, King Jing was akin to a fuel guzzler, prudently paying attention to him and attending to him. Huo Wujiu witnessed all of this. But...He slowly rubbed his hand on the envelope\u2019s paper cover.He was a prisoner of war escorted here by an enemy country, yet King Jing dared to send this kind of thing to him. He wondered for a moment whether King Jing was too bold, or whether he was too stupid. Or maybe\u2026Huo Wujiu frowned in confusion.Could emotions really deceive people to the point that even their family, country and life could take a back seat?Huo Wujiu had always been proficient in the art of war and power, but when it came to such things, he was a blank sheet.His inexperience made him lose his judgment for a while.His position suddenly became a bit chaotic.As if whatever plans and calculations he had, it was all like bullying him wantonly on account of his preferences.\u2014\u2014After Sun Yuan tactfully retreated, Huo Wujiu opened the envelope in his hand.The letter paper was crumpled and wrinkled, and it was faintly visible how righteously indignant the person was when he wrote the letter.Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and looked out the window.Meng Qianshan was talking to the carpenter who brought the wheelchair in the courtyard. The carpenter was hurriedly taking notes with a pen and paper, so Meng Qianshan was probably asking him to modify it. As soon as Meng Qianshan saw Sun Yuan come out, he hastily greeted him and let him sit on the wheelchair, then pushed him around in the courtyard.He was probably testing to see whether the wheelchair was sturdy.Huo Wujiu lowered his eyes and unfolded the letter.[It had been more than ten years since this lowly official parted ways with the former Marquis. Speaking of the Battle of Xunyang, I\u2019m both distraught and angered, but had no way to help. I have no other choice but to feed on His Majesty\u2019s official salary. And now, even though I am in Lin'an, I have no face to see you, General.]Teardrops in flower forms had blurred the words there.Huo Wujiu frowned and first turned the letter to the last page where it was addressed.Ji Hongcheng.He did have some impression of this person. Southern Jing currently had a few generals, and his father's old friend, Lou Yue, was one of them. This person, who wrote the letter, was probably Lou Yue\u2019s subordinate in the army at that time, and now held a job in the Ministry of War.Huo Wujiu turned the letter back over.This man's remorse and guilt was hinted at in between the lines, but Huo Wujiu did not take it to heart.In those years, the previous emperor was afraid of the Huo family. Hence, back when the war was tight, he intended to cut off reinforcements, cut off food and grass, and also made up a crime to exterminate the Huo family after the war. His father raised an army because of his deep hatred for the late emperor. It had nothing to do with his home country, so naturally, he didn\u2019t involve other colleagues, nor did he need them to join in the rebellion.Subjects were duty bound to the emperor and to the country. Only talents in the Jianghu could do something such as rising together righteously on account of the code of brotherhood.Huo Wujiu's gaze faintly swept over the lines of heartfelt words and looked straight back.Then, his eyebrows slightly rose.[I know that the General is now in a difficult situation. I hope the General can grin and bear it and maintain your resolve for revenge. King Jing is by no means a good person. Today at the court, he even spoke obscenely with His Majesty and shamelessly shared his joyous intimacy with you in the court. Afterward, His Majesty ordered to have you face him, but his disgust was so overwhelming that he even gave up the right to repair the ancestral hall just to keep you imprisoned in the backyard.It is obvious that this person is dirty and despicable, so I hope you will take care of yourself. General Lou is currently suppressing bandits in Lingnan, so this lowly official\u2019s thoughts count for little. I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end, so I can't repay the old marquis for his kindness. However, the General can rest assured. If there comes a day when I can be of use to you, I\u2019ll do my best.]That was the end of a short letter.Huo Wujiu held the letter over the lamp on the table that Sun Yuan had specially lit for him.The fire licked the letter and immediately burnt one corner to ashes.Huo Wujiu suddenly jerked the letter back from the fire.He took the letter, which had been burned and mutilated, and after a pause, his gaze fell on the penultimate paragraph again.He actually couldn't help but read that passage several times.By the time he came back to his senses, he was on the verge of memorizing it. He subtly froze and passed the letter to the fire, burning it cleanly along with the envelope.The flames danced slightly in his eyes.Huo Wujiu stared at the fire, his brow furrowed in several gullies.He really did not expect\u2026Even his father's old friends knew what it was to be worldly-wise and play safe. However, such a timid white rabbit, who had nothing to do with him and was fierce in appearance but faint in the heart, could contend in the court on his behalf, even in exchange for the power in his hands....Just so that I would suffer less humiliation from the emperor.He never thought that he would one day be protected by a person with such thin shoulders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 17.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 17.1Jiang Suizhou naturally did not know how Huo Wujiu received that secret letter scolding him. He happily basked in a round of idleness in the Ministry of Rites, then returned to his house and went to his study.Due to that day's conversation, Ji You's attitude towards him became much better. Today, Ji You also lent him two books, saying that they were for him to read.Of course, it was two books of unofficial history.Jiang Suizhou was not very fond of unofficial history because of his personal experience, so after thanking Ji You's kindness, he collected the two books and put them on his desk like nothing.Who would want to read them? He didn't want to take the risk of somehow transmigrating again.What was more, he had other things to do \u2014\u2014For example, the secret letter that the two ministers sent him.He was extremely cautious and put the letter away when he received it early in the morning. It was only now when no one was around that he unfolded and read it.\u2014\u2014Similar to his conjecture, the letter did not provide much useful information.These two courtiers were not high officials, but happened to be in the Ministry of Works. Therefore, when the Ministry of Works took over this project, they figured out the budget amount and the person in charge with some inquiries. They also did some calculations for Jiang Suizhou, and figured out how much spoiles Pang Shao could get here.The amount was really hefty.The two courtiers must have felt anxious because of this, and asked him in the letter if they should plant some of their own people in the project.Jiang Suizhou fell into deep thought.According to his current understanding of the original owner, he would definitely do something. Even if there would be no return or even loss, he must try it.But Jiang Suizhou knew that it was all useless.Pang Shao would never let any official he was not comfortable with handle the money. Thus, even if they slipped their own officials in, they could never touch the money allocated by the court. In this case, all their spies could do was to collect evidence of corruption and report it to the court\u2026But, how was the relationship between Pang Shao and the Emperor, and how was his relationship with the Emperor?This was obviously courting destruction.Moreover, the officials who have been inserted would be pushed to the cusp of the storm, making it easy for Pang Shao to persecute them.Before transmigrating, he had read history books and found that a lot of Southern Jing officials suffered accidental deaths in certain projects, and those accidents were left unsettled.Jiang Suizhou did not dare to risk lives.He pondered for a moment, and read the letter carefully. He wrote down some numbers and names, and then put the letter into a secret compartment on the side of the table.There were already a lot of letters in there.All of them were saved by the original owner. Jiang Suizhou took a lot of effort to find this secret compartment.He also roughly determined the original owner's sphere of influence based on the letters in it.Most of the information collected in the letters stored there were fragmentary and of little reference value. But according to the positions of the officials who wrote the letters, it was clear that these people had little real power in their hands, and these fragmentary and pitiful pieces of information were the results of their best efforts.These officials would painstakingly collect information and give it to the original owner, and the original owner did not disappoint their efforts. There were always traces of circled annotations on the letters in the box, which showed how diligent the original owner\u2019s regard to them was.Jiang Suizhou stored this letter together with the rest. He carefully locked it up, and then began to write his reply to the two officials.He did not refuse directly, but only said that they should stay put, and he would act accordingly. If he found a chance to plant them in as spies by then, he would notify them as soonest possible.Fortunately, there were several letters in the study that the original owner had not yet sent, so Jiang Suizhou barely learned his manner of speaking and finished writing the letter.After writing, Jiang Suizhou read the letter through and waited for the ink to dry.He couldn't help but sigh.It had been three years since Southern Jing fled across the Yangtze River, and gradually came out of the fear of the country\u2019s destruction. They appeared to have accepted the current division of the river and governing countries on either side. Until a month or so ago, Huo Wujiu led his troops to the south and disrupted the original balance. But then, he was besieged and captured when the reinforcements were cut off during the river crossing.This time, even General Huo of the Northern Liang was gone, so the Southern Jing courtiers were naturally more at ease.It was precisely for this reason that Pang Shao comfortably embezzled and sought power, while the emperor was only devoted to worldly pleasures. The original King Jing and the courtiers behind him were trying their best to seize power from Pang Shao's party, searching for a clear way out of that dark cloud.However, none of them knew that the dynasty was nearing its fated end, and the edifices were on the verge of collapse.They were struggling to climb a skyscraper that was about to topple over.Jiang Suizhou looked out the window.He gradually accepted the fact that he was brought into this period in history. At the same time, he was also caught in this mighty torrent.He gradually kind of wanted to help them.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He handed the secret letter to Meng Qianshan, and then saw him stuffing it into his sleeves quite skillfully.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze with ease.Perhaps because he possessed a weaker body, he looked awful after sitting for a long time. When Meng Qianshan saw that his lips were pale, he asked thoughtfully, \"Master, you must be tired. Do you want me to prepare a warm bath for you?\"Jiang Suizhou also felt a little tired after hearing his suggestion, so he nodded in agreement.Meng Qianshan responded repeatedly.Jiang Suizhou walked all the way back to his room and saw that dinner had already been prepared. Under the brilliant light, Huo Wujiu was sitting there reading a book.How many books were there in the room? They were all prepared by Meng Qianshan for the original owner as a way to relieve his boredom before going to bed. The original owner preferred obscure Confucian ancient texts, which were all about the ways of governing the world. \u00a0Jiang Suizhou was used to reading ancient prose, and he didn't find it boring, but Huo Wujiu was different.How could a man who danced with swords appreciate these?With that thought in mind, Jiang Suizhou sat down at the table and asked, \"Are you reading?\"His tone was cold, and he made it clear that he was not interested in what he was doing.He didn't expect Huo Wujiu to pay attention to him either, so that question was nothing more than a conversation opener. When his words fell, he paused, and was about to order Meng Qianshan to send some leisure books to Huo Wujiu, when he suddenly heard a low, mellow voice.\u201cI\u2019m just skimming through it,\u201d replied Huo Wujiu.Jiang Suizhou was startled.He looked at Huo Wujiu with some disbelief, and saw him eating his meal with an air of complacency.The words he had prepared reached his mouth, but were blocked by Huo Wujiu's sudden response. For a spell, Jiang Suizhou was rendered speechless.He saw Huo Wujiu raise his eyes and look at him indifferently.He wasn\u2019t sure if it was his illusion, but he had this feeling that the aggressiveness in Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze this time has faded a lot despite his same old icy, unapproachable countenance. Even the oppressive air dissipated for the most part.For a while, he was so calm that Jiang Suizhou felt that he must have misread it.He froze, hastily put away his astonishment, lowered his eyes to grab some food, and said, \"I see. What kind of books do you usually read? You can ask Meng Qianshan to bring you some.\"As he spoke, he signalled Meng Qianshan with his eyes.Meng Qianshan nodded repeatedly right after.But Huo Wujiu spoke up again. \"No need,\" he declined. After a pause, Huo Wujiu looked at him indifferently and then said, \"I'm not used to being taken care of.\"He implied - not only the books, but also the sacrifices Jiang Suizhou made in the court and the letter he had people send to him in the previous days, which he naturally knew in his heart.He had no control if King Jing insisted on liking him, but he didn't want to accept King Jing\u2019s favor and kindness.Benefits received from someone should be returned, but he couldn\u2019t reciprocate this kind of sentiment.He saw Jiang Suizhou raise his eyes opposite him with a fleeting look of bewilderment in his eyes. Then he smiled coldly and said, \u201cHow have I ever taken care of you? I'm just looking for something for you to do, so you won't give me any trouble.\"Jiang Suizhou was ecstatic deep inside.How can you not get used to it? For the sake of my life, there are many places of yours I can take care of in the future!You\u2019d better get used to it sooner!Huo Wujiu frowned and was about to say something when he saw Meng Qianshan next to him bursting with joy. Meng Qianshan was smiling and nodding his head, saying that he would go and pick out some more for the Madam later and let him choose.Obviously, the master and servant duo did not intend to listen to his opinion.Huo Wujiu looked down while Jiang Suizhou also did not speak again. After eating dinner, he went to the side to drink tea to aid with digestion.He was in a good mood.When the night was getting late, Meng Qianshan approached him and told him that the bath in the back room was ready, and that he could go and bathe.Jiang Suizhou responded, put down his book and went to the back room.He bypassed the silk screen, and the steam heat rushed to his face. Under the heavy veil, there were flickering candle flames, exuding a bit of charming ambiguity in the misty steam.A sunken carved copper pool was built in the middle of the back room. It was not too big, only about three to five square feet. At this time, hot water filled the pool along with floating layers of flower petals that permeated a subtle delicate fragrance.A few maids were standing next to it, presumably to serve Jiang Suizhou in his bath....This was too inappropriate.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze and waved his hand, gesturing for them to withdraw.The maids then obediently retreated. There was not even the sound of footsteps between their actions, and in no time, they completely retreated.Jiang Suizhou turned his head again, looked at Meng Qianshan, and said, \"You can also withdraw.\"Meng Qianshan was stunned: \"Huh?\"Um...when did his master ever bathe without someone serving? Except when in Madam Gu's room\u2026When this thought popped up, it suddenly dawned on Meng Qianshan.How could he be so blind! There was another master in the room, so his service was not needed!He nodded repeatedly and beamed. \"Aye! I'll leave now!\"Jiang Suizhou wondered if Meng Qianshan was having delusions again. Meng Qianshan\u2019s expression...how should he put it? It bore a sprinkle of unspeakable lewdness.When he exited, Jiang Suizhou approached the pool, he leaned down to test the temperature. Then, he removed layers of robes and placed them on the side of the rack.There was no one around at this time, so his mind relaxed, and he started to ponder things again.The next day of the Grand Court Assembly was in a couple of days. It seemed appropriate to find a way to confer with the two ministers about today\u2019s secret letter\u2026He thought about it while undressing. Just as he was untying the sash of his loincloth and about to remove his robe, he heard a rattling sound behind him.Jiang Suizhou whirled around.He saw Meng Qianshan pushing Huo Wujiu's wheelchair in, and sitting on the wheelchair was Huo Wujiu, who was expressionless, like a Buddha being pushed in.Behind him, Meng Qianshan smiled crudely and implicitly.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s mind went blank, and the next moment, he immediately understood what this grandson, Meng Qianshan, was planning.How dare he bring Huo Wujiu here and let him take a c-couple bath with him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt blood rushing straight to his head, causing the roots of his ears to turn red from fury.The next moment, he clenched his teeth and growled, \"Meng Qianshan!\"He felt that Meng Qianshan should be thankful that he was not the original owner. Otherwise, he must have spilled blood on the spot today. A straightforward kill was a light end for him.Meng Qianshan was stunned. He realized that his bootlicking had swatted the horse\u2019s hoof.He was startled and stammered an explanation, \u201cI-I...Seeing that Master doesn't want to be served by others, I just thought the bathing pool is quite large and also convenient, so...just...\"He couldn't even compose himself.Having his bare skin out made Jiang Suizhou\u2019s a bit cold, so he gathered his inner garment together. He took a deep breath and tried to keep his tone calm: \u201cDid you forget that the doctor only changed his bandages two days ago? You want to soak him in hot water again? Meng Qianshan, if that brain is of little use, I\u2019ll ask someone to dig it out for you.\"Jiang Suizhou was physically sick and weak, so his breath bore tremors.Meng Qianshan could no longer care about anything else. He was so scared that he pushed the wheelchair away and ran.Even as he fled, he didn't dare to touch Huo Wujiu one bit. He stumbled all the way and pushed Huo Wujiu back to his bedroom.Jiang Suizhou breathed a sigh of relief and took off his robe again.Meng Qianshan fled in such a fright that Jiang Suizhou\u2019s thoughts were also abruptly disrupted. But the pool was indeed exquisitely prepared, and the water temperature was also utterly satisfactory. Soaking in it would be the ultimate treat.So Jiang Suizhou soaked in the pool to his heart\u2019s content. It wasn\u2019t until he was a little tired of being in the water that he got up and changed into new bed clothes and went back to the bedroom.Meng Qianshan ran away in fear, and only Huo Wujiu, who was sitting in a wheelchair reading a book, was left in the bedroom.Jiang Suizhou was a bit embarrassed.It was all that silly Meng Qianshan\u2019s fault\u2026.He insisted on pushing Huo Wujiu inside while he was taking a bath.Jiang Suizhou wiped his hair while walking to the couch and sat down. Perhaps because Huo Wujiu replied to him out of the blue just now, Jiang Suizhou was also more relaxed. So, at this time, Jiang Suizhou also opened his mouth directly to speak.\"It's Meng Qianshan who's fooling around,\" he said.Huo Wujiu put down the book and replied indifferently, \"It doesn\u2019t matter.\" Then, he swung his wheelchair and went to the back room to wash up.Jiang Suizhou sighed quietly with relief.He really wasn\u2019t hallucinating...Although Huo Wujiu still treated him coldly, he was willing to respond to him.\u2014\u2014Although it's a refusal.But it also proved that the efforts Jiang Suizhou had made were effective \u2014\u2014 at least, Huo Wujiu felt that he was taking care of him.Jiang Suizhou watched his back disappear behind the screen and withdrew his gaze. He took the book which he was halfway through reading, and leaned back on the couch to continue reading.As soon as he laid down on the couch, he noticed the difference.The cushions were a full layer thicker. The pillows had been changed, and an extremely comfortable quilt had even been laid.It seemed that Meng Qianshan believed his nonsense this morning. Fearing that he would suffer as a result of sleeping on the couch, Meng Qianshan specially prepared these for him.Jiang Suizhou immediately forgave Meng Qianshan's presumptuousness just now.Was there anything in the world better than being able to get a good night's sleep?Currently, there was none.\u2014\u2014Unbeknownst to him, once Huo Wujiu went around into the back room, his wheelchair paused in place.His hands slipped inaudibly.In front of him, hot and humid steam rushed over his face. Amidst the dense white mist was the empty bathing pool, and the water stains left on the floor.The flower petals in the pool gently rippled with the subtle waves of water, and the man's dirty robes were hanging on the copper rack next to it.This scenery easily evoked the picture he had seen just now.For example, that man's scattered ink black hair; his tunic that was untied midway; and when he turned around, his glistening chest and abdomen.Huo Wujiu had been in the military all year round, and had seen too many men's limbs. In the summer, a group of older men would go to the river to bathe together.But...he had never seen such a man.He didn\u2019t know for sure if it was because he hadn't been exposed to the sun and rain, or if his appearance was just too outstanding, but with just one glance, Huo Wujiu hurriedly averted his eyes.He had never seen...such a man. He couldn't even think of an appropriate and non-erotic adjective for him.Come to think of it, of the men he met, even if they frankly looked at each other, it didn\u2019t feel wrong. There has never been someone like King Jing, who swiftly wrapped himself with his clothes before speaking and whose ear roots turned red from shyness....Like a grown girl.Although Huo Wujiu\u2019s impression of girls was also nonexistent, this terrible depiction suddenly popped into his mind when he thought of Jiang Suizhou.Along with it was his heart that also skipped a couple of beats.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He slept continuously until the next morning, waking up refreshed and his spirits a bit lighter.Meng Qianshan prepared breakfast early in the morning. Perhaps because he upset Jiang Suizhou last night, the dishes on the table were particularly rich. On top of that, all were also arranged according to Jiang Suizhou's most favorite dishes.Jiang Suizhou swept Meng Qianshan a quick glance, and saw him smiling awkwardly and flatteringly.He said nothing, coldly withdrawing his gaze.He\u2019d better scare Meng Qianshan a bit, to prevent him from committing such smart-ass deeds again and getting himself into trouble.Hence, it wasn\u2019t until Jiang Suizhou finished eating that he opened his mouth coldly and spoke to Meng Qianshan.\"Isn't it time for Madam Huo to change his bandages?\" He asked.Meng Qianshan nodded repeatedly: \"The mansion doctor will come later today, so don't worry, Your Highness.\"Jiang Suizhou snorted, paused, and then said, \"What's the date today?\"Meng Qianshan replied, \"Your Highness, it's the eighth day of the month.\"Jiang Suizhou nodded.\"It's the fourth day. Send someone to Madam Gu's courtyard later and inform him that I will have dinner there tonight.\"Meng Qianshan was dumbfounded.Your Highness! You...how can you say this in front of Madam Huo!Meng Qianshan stared blankly at Jiang Suizhou for a time, until Jiang Suizhou, who received no response, glanced askance at him. Only then did Meng Qianshan nod blankly, \"Yes...I will do so in a while...\"Jiang Suizhou looked at him and frowned.What was with this kid\u2019s expression? In front of Huo Wujiu, Meng Qianshan was staring at him as if he betrayed his lover!What if Huo Wujiu saw him like this and thought wrong?Jiang Suizhou hurriedly stole a glance at Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu was eating with his eyes downcast, as if he hadn't heard anything.\u2014\u2014Well, since I married Huo Wujiu, I have been at peace with him and haven't done anything out of the ordinary. I think Huo Wujiu also has an idea in mind and knows that my relationship with him is not the same as my relationship with Gu Changyun and the others....Although my relationship with Gu Changyun is also extremely innocent. Exactly.With this thought, Jiang Suizhou was relieved. Seeing that the hour was almost up, he got up and went to the Ministry of Rites to continue slacking.Only Meng Qianshan was left, looking at Huo Wujiu worriedly.He finally knew what it meant by the emperor was not anxious but his eunuch was. 1Men, their upper and lower bodies were really separated. Just like His Highness; he told him yesterday of how deep his love for Madam Hou was. His Highness said that he was so smitten that he couldn\u2019t bear to defile him. Yet today, he said that he was going to his concubine\u2019s room right in front of Madam Huo.Meng Qianshan fretfully looked at Madam Huo, who looked indifferent and unaffected.How should he console Madam? Although Madam still looked indifferent, it was unwise to leave a bad impression of His Highness\u2019s philandering ways in his heart.After a moment of deliberation, he went out of the room. He found a maid and asked her to pass the King's order to Madam Gu's room. Then he returned and stood in front of Huo Wujiu.\"Madam Gu entered the mansion earlier, as you know, Master,\" he carefully said with a smile piled on his face.This \"master\" was already an address of Meng Qianshan's utmost respect for Huo Wujiu.Usually, it was the servants who served the concubines in the rear court who addressed their own concubine as master. He, the grand eunuch by the King's side, naturally would not be so placating.Huo Wujiu lifted his eyelids and gave Meng Qianshan a look.Meng Qianshan showed him a flattering smile and consoled him, \u201cMadam Gu is delicate in nature and will make a fuss when he doesn't see His Highness for a few days. His Highness is impatient of the like, and is even more resistant to him making trouble. I don't think he really loves that Madam.\"Huo Wujiu frowned.What was he trying to tell him? What did it matter to him what King Jing was going to do?Meng Qianshan spoke as if Huo Wujiu was a concubine in the harem, competing for favor.He heard Meng Qianshan rambling on, \"Besides, that Madam Gu is not a reasonable one either. Although His Highness keeps you in the yard day by day, it doesn't necessarily prevent jealous men from storming to you to vent his displeasure, does it? \u00a0His Highness will sleep there overnight, but it\u2019s also all for your benefit\u2026\u201dHuo Wujiu listened to his gossip and found it noisy. He was about to tell him to shut up when he was caught off guard by the word \"overnight\".The picture he saw last night surfaced in front of him again for a moment.He recalled the man's moist and slender waist and belly; his thin red ears when he was shy and angry; and his soft whispers through the door that day when he said his heart fell for him a long time ago; that clear and magnetic voice.What would a man like him look like when he spent the night with another man?He was stunned....What am I thinking!The thought struck without warning. After he recovered, he was so surprised and caught off guard that he was inevitably a little annoyed.He raised his eyes and gave Meng Qianshan a cold look.With only one look, Meng Qianshan's throat choked with fright, and he immediately shut his mouth.He looked at Huo Wujiu in trepidation.Huo Wujiu stared back at him. Although Huo Wujiu was looking up from below, his ruthless eyes made people want to kneel down in front of him involuntarily.Huo Wujiu faltered....He wasn\u2019t interested in fighting with a eunuch who was missing a string in his head.He withdrew his gaze.Although he was now Jiang Suizhou's nominal concubine, to him, it was just a change of jail locations. He didn\u2019t succumb to the imperial dungeon of Southern Jing, so naturally, he would never be assimilated in this kind of place.Of course, he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to treat a eunuch viciously for such a thing.With that in mind, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and looked at Meng Qianshan again.\"Get out,\" he ordered.There was no gentleness, only ferocity.Footnote:1 one himself does not worry but another person worries in vainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 19.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 19.1When Jiang Suizhou arrived in Gu Changyun's room that night, he was surprised to find that the bedroom was still occupied by Xu Du.The food was already placed on the table, and no one was left to serve them.When he saw Jiang Suizhou enter, Gu Changyun saluted him and poured tea for him.Jiang Suizhou sat down at the main seat.\"Master sent word of your visit earlier this morning, so I had someone cook a dish of Squirrel Mandarin Fish,\" Gu Changyun said with a smile while moving the plate of fish in front of Jiang Suizhou.\u201cWould you like to try it, Master?\u201dJiang Suizhou couldn't help but feel a little puzzled.He himself originally did not like sweets, especially this kind of sweet and sour southern dish. After staying in the south for a few days, the dishes on the dining table in his room were always mostly northern.Could it be that the original owner loved sweets?He looked at Gu Changyun with some suspicion and saw him raise his eyebrows, a hint of surprise on his face.\"Won't you eat it, Master?\"Jiang Suizhou didn't make a sound and stretched his chopsticks to take a piece of the fish off the plate.The fish was so sweet and fragrant in the mouth that Jiang Suizhou's eyebrows could not help but wrinkle.His chopsticks froze.Although the soul of King Jing was now him, his body structure was still King Jing\u2019s. The one thing that could affect one's eating preferences, besides experience, was the taste buds. Since he was originally born without a sweet tooth and also had no psychological barriers, then his body\u2019s reaction to the fish must be from the original owner himself.The original owner didn\u2019t like sweets, so Gu Changyun\u2019s move was clearly to test him.Jiang Suizhou chewed a few times and looked at Gu Changyun faintly.A smile surfaced on Gu Changyun's face. He seemed to be relieved after his doubts about Jiang Suizhou were dispelled.Jiang Suizhou did not say a word, only looked at him coldly. His gaze carried two points of scrutiny and warning.Gu Changyun immediately sensed it. He blinked and said with a smile, \"Sure enough, Your Highness still doesn't like sweets. It's just a pity that this famous southern dish has not been able to enter your eyes for three years.\"Jiang Suizhou, however, slowly put down his chopsticks.\u201cYou have a lot of guts,\" he lowered his eyes to the tabletop and said indifferently.Gu Changyun stared at him and did not speak for a moment.Jiang Suizhou asked, \"Did you get the result you wanted?\"Gu Changyun stiffened, and then gently laughed out loud.\"Master, what are you talking about? I was just looking at the fresh Mandarin fish that was shipped to the mansion recently, and I wanted them to cook it for you to try.\"Jiang Suizhou's knuckles slowly knocked on the table, one at a time.If the people who knew him well were present right now, they would have registered that this was his habitual action whenever he saw through someone\u2019s lies and was thinking about countermeasures.Jiang Suizhou knew that they had noticed that he was not the original owner.He had been mentally prepared. After all, these two people were trusted aides of the original owner. Not to mention that they\u2019ve spent a lot of time together, and must also know each other through and through. Moreover, since the original owner was able to bring these two under his command, they were absolutely not idlers. Trying to fool them would be very challenging.Nevertheless, he did not expect that they would begin to test him only on their second meeting.This proved that from the first time they met, these two people had sensed that he was different from the original owner.The sound of his knuckles knocked against the wooden tabletop, one after another. The sound was soft and gentle, and it swept through the quiet room.Just then, Xu Du, who had been waiting by, spoke.\"Master, please forgive him. Changyun was just being naughty.\" He rose to his feet.Jiang Suizhou glanced at Xu Du, and saw him bowing deeply before him.\"But rest assured, Master, that no matter what happens, his loyalty to you is evident in heaven and earth.\"This was a promise of loyalty.Jiang Suizhou knew that he was telling him that no matter who he had become now, as long as he remained their master, they would both be loyal to him.He looked down and took a sip of tea to wash the sweetness that filled his mouth.He naturally would not believe what he said.But he also knew that at present, his identity was evident among the three. He issued a warning, and they also expressed their loyalty. At this point, further persecution was useless.He needed facts to prove that Xu Du's claim of loyalty was true or false. Until then, what he had to do was to find something that could restrain them or prevent them from betraying him.Jiang Suizhou picked up his chopsticks again, as if the confrontation had not happened, and calmly talked to them about the letter he had received yesterday.Xu Du and Gu Changyun also discussed the contents of the letter with him as if nothing had happened.As with their last meeting, these two were methodical. They hit all the right notes and were quite insightful. When they proposed countermeasures, they usually hit the nail on the head. Their proposals coincided with the analysis Jiang Suizhou made based on historical data.He gave off the impression that he really was the original owner, doing his best, without any reservations.Jiang Suizhou couldn't tell if they were deliberately disguising themselves, or if they really didn't care whether the person in front of them was the original King Jing or not. But whatever the reason, the analysis they presented was desirable. Jiang Suizhou deliberated and wrote down the parts he thought were useful.After finishing the meal and discussing the major and minor matters that happened in the past few days, Jiang Suizhou got up and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 19.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 19.2\u2014\u2014 Although it was not a big deal to spend the night there, he was now a person whose real identity got exposed. If he were to stay overnight in the name of the original owner, it would be torturous just thinking about it.The two men got up after him, saluted and sent him away.It was not until the servants flanked Jiang Suizhou out of the courtyard yard that the two sat down again at the table.Gu Changyun gently burst out laughing.\"He found out,\" he said.Xu Du gave him a disapproving look, \"I warned you earlier not to tease him.\"Gu Changyun brushed him off.\"I just didn't expect that he could be so perceptive,\" he said. \"But look, he didn\u2019t get angry either, did he?\"Xu Du glanced at him. \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d he replied.Gu Changyun laughed a few more times.\"Whatever,\" he said. \"I just want to see what this smart and soft-hearted new master will do next.\"\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou returned to Anyin Hall, but did not go back to the bedroom. Instead, he took advantage of the still early time to head to the study.In addition to letters, there was plenty of other information the original owner stored in the study that could be examined. However, because it was extremely hidden and large in quantity, Jiang Suizhou had not thoroughly checked the information in the original owner\u2019s study until now.Now, he had a suspicion in his mind and wanted to try to find out something from the information stored in the study.This search lasted two hours, until about midnight.He found an account book that the original owner had placed deep within his desk.The account book was nothing special, but Jiang Suizhou found that the amount of expenditure on the account was very large. Each time, an account was issued on the 15th of the month, and the money was handed over to Xu Du by the original owner himself.In addition to this, there was an expense in the book that fluctuated slightly each month, but the amount was insignificant.The original owner shouldn\u2019t have kept records of such paltry sums. But since it was recorded in the book, the use of the money must be very important.The date of the monthly disbursement was also the 15th.Jiang Suizhou formulated a plan in his heart.He brooded over it for a long time until Meng Qianshan came knocking on the door. He was here to remind Jiang Suizhou of the late hour and that he had to go attend the Grand Court Assemble the next day. Only then did Jiang Suizhou put the account book away and return to his bedroom.By then, it was already deep into the night, and most of the servants had gone to bed early, leaving only a few on night watch.Meng Qianshan opened the door of his room for him. When Jiang Suizhou stepped in, he found Huo Wujiu sitting under the lamp and reading a book.He was frowning. One of his hands supported his forehead as he read through lines again and again. It appeared that he didn\u2019t quite understand the content of the book, and he seemed irritable.Hearing the sound at the door, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and saw Jiang Suizhou taking off his cloak while walking indoors.He shot a faint, obscure gaze which stopped on Jiang Suizhou....Why is he back?Jiang Suizhou tossed his cloak to Meng Qianshan's hand. When he turned his head, he saw Huo Wujiu sitting there holding a book in one hand, as if he didn't see him.Jiang Suizhou's heart inexplicably relaxed a bit.Even if he was an idler in the Ministry of Rites, he still must guard against all his colleagues and always act like King Jing; when he returned to his residence, his two sharp-eyed aides were enough for him to deal with.On the contrary, this Huo Wujiu, who was always indifferent to him, seldom spoke to him, and did not even give him a look, made him feel relaxed.Under this atmosphere, a vague feeling of \u201creturning home\u201d even sprouted deep within Jiang Suizhou.This thought made Jiang Suizhou give a self-depreciating sigh.How much did he suffer that he actually found Huo Wujiu's face lovely?Hearing him sigh, Meng Qianshan only thought he was tired and hurriedly supported him, guiding him to the back room to wash up.When the two figures disappeared behind the screen, Huo Wujiu, whose gaze was fixed on the book, slowly raised his eyes and looked up....Must be difficult for him.This morning, he heard Meng Qianshan say that \"he went to Madam Gu's place for you\" and thought that the eunuch was muddled. But looking at how late at night it was, yet King Jing still rushed back, Huo Wujiu also felt that something was not quite right.This man just purely wished to please him. Now, even his earlier concubines lost his favor, and he eagerly rushed back to sleep on the couch\u2026Huo Wujiu frowned, and his finger slowly tapped on the wheelchair.Could it really be because of him?He has never liked to owe others, whether materially or emotionally. Therefore, he especially hated it when others wishfully gave him something he didn't need. He never appreciated it.For example, King Jing.Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze, lowered his eyes again, and looked at the book in his hand again.This book was written by a great scholar of the Jing Dynasty. It was full of benevolence and morality, and the speech was long-winded. Huo Wujiu was already annoyed from reading the book, and King Jing's sudden return should have turned his mood for the worse.But upon reading this book again, Huo Wujiu's brow inexplicably wrinkled up.It seemed that this trite and fatuous great scholar had suddenly become less repulsive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 20.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 20.1The next day was another Grand Court Assembly.The thought of honoring the emperor made Jiang Suizhou deeply conflicted. After a hasty meal early in the morning, he went out.To his surprise, just as he crossed the Zhengyang Gate, he bumped into someone head-on.\"What a coincidence, Your Highness Jing.\" The man originally forced himself to smile, but because he was too ugly, he looked vicious. Moreover, he couldn't hide the revulsion and malice in his eyes.Jiang Suizhou took a quick look at him.He was wearing the official uniform of a fourth-rank military official. He was around 30 or 40 years old, tall, and especially dark, with unkempt hair and beard. His round eyes trained on him were quite like Zhong Kui\u2019s 1 .Jiang Suizhou took a quick glance at his court tablet.Ministry of War, Ji Hongcheng.Ah, so it was him.The Lord Ji in front of him was so ugly that it was recorded in history books. Records written about him in the history of Jing claimed that he was \"ugly.\u201d Now, it seemed that...it was no exaggeration.In ancient times, the preliminary round of imperial examinations also took into account the exam candidates\u2019 appearance. If this Sir wanted to enter the imperial examinations to be an official, he naturally wouldn\u2019t pass the examination even if it took his whole life. He only became an official by relying on his military background. He was promoted by Lou Yue, the famous general of the Southern Jing.This man\u2019s entire life passed through Jiang Suizhou\u2019s mind at railway speed.His superior, Lou Yue, was an old friend of Huo Wujiu's father. When the Northern Liang army rose, the Emperor and the Empress dreaded him to the point where they did not even dare to let him fight with the Liang army. From this, it showed that Lou Yue and Huo Wujiu's father had a deep friendship. So, he believed that Ji Hongcheng\u2019s scowl directed at him was also partly because of Huo Wujiu.Therefore, Jiang Suizhou coldly glanced at him. He did not speak, only walked around him.He found Ji Hongcheng following him.\"I have heard that Your Highness is of good character. Now that I have seen you, it is indeed the case,\" Ji Hongcheng remarked.Jiang Suizhou didn't bother to turn his head.He heard Ji Hongcheng add, \u201cAfter all, it's only when you browbeat the weak and the disabled in the harem that you show the true qualities of a gentleman, right?\"Anger coated his tone, and one could tell that he had held back for some time. This man probably had been holding a grudge against him since the last assembly and specifically waylaid him here today to tell him off.This man was rather bold among the ranks, brave but lacked wisdom and tact. Now it seemed that this was indeed the case.Fortunately, Jiang Suizhou was not the original owner and did not dare to do anything to Huo Wujiu. If the person who heard his words was the original owner, Huo Wujiu's situation in King Jing\u2019s mansion would probably only worsen.Jiang Suizhou turned his head back and gave him a faint look.Ji Hongcheng was staring at him with copper-bell like round eyes, seemingly waiting for Jiang Suizhou to retort so he could pick a ferocious fight with him.Jiang Suizhou smiled gently.\"I've troubled Lord Ji,\" he said. \"This king's harem, naturally, is at my own disposal. Whether I want to kill, flay or defile someone, it's none of your business \u2014\u2014 wouldn\u2019t you agree?\"\u2014\u2014The sight of Ji Hongcheng's face turning red with anger, him standing in place and unable to make a sound, improved Jiang Suizhou\u2019s mood. He turned around and walked away.He knew that Ji Hongcheng had good intentions and was worried about Huo Wujiu, but he didn't mind railing against him and teaching him a lesson so that Ji Hongcheng wouldn't do such a disservice next time.He walked all the way to the Guangyuan Hall.When the hour arrived, drums were beaten. Then came the eunuch\u2019s singing cry.Solemn silence and reverence settled outside the door. The ministers in the hall stood grandly, but the hall remained quiet, and no one appeared in sight for a long time.The Emperor didn\u2019t show up.Jiang Suizhou could not help but look around, but saw that the surrounding ministers appeared used to it. They quietly stood and waited.Jiang Suizhou followed suit and waited.This waiting actually lasted for a short half an hour, until the sun was high up in the sky. Jiang Suizhou's vision was a little blurry when the emperor entered leisurely.\"All of you arrived here so early, huh?\" His Majesty slumped crookedly on the throne, yawning while lazily saying.Jiang Suizhou scrutinized him and noticed that his eyes were dark, and his complexion was blue. He looked worn out. At a glance, it was due to overindulgence and excessive fornication.The courtiers did not dare to say anything.His Majesty then said, \"Is there anything important today, Uncle?\"He directly addressed Pang Shao.In the front row, Pang Shao smiled in response, and then opened his mouth to present memorials. In fact, he already made decisions regarding the big and small matters of the court. Every time he mentioned something, His Majesty just nodded and then had people follow Pang Shao's arrangements.His Majesty didn\u2019t even ask in detail how much funds the Ministry of Revenue had to allocate in some of the issues he asked money for. He just instructed the minister of the Ministry of Revenue to allocate the money.Jiang Suizhou frowned while listening. He wrote down the general matters and lamented that Southern Jing\u2019s extermination was really deserved.Once Pang Shao finished presenting some memorials, a sparse line of courtiers also presented memorials. His Majesty heedlessly listened to them and then directly asked Pang Shao what to do. In the end, the issues presented by these ministers were handled according to Pang Shao's suggestions.Footnote:1 Zhong Kui - a deity in Chinese mythology, traditionally regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After thinking it over, I decided to put him by my side and keep an eye on him,\" he said.His Majesty propped up himself the throne and leaned forward. \"But I also heard that since General Huo entered your harem, he has never left your bedroom?\"Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes and saw that the emperor\u2019s eyes were shining, seemingly filled with the words \"forbidden-domain.\"Jiang Suizhou was a little speechless, but still obliged and lowered his head. He held a fist against the front of his mouth with some embarrassment and cleared his throat.His Majesty took it as a tacit admission of his speculation.For a time, His Majesty roared with delight.\"It seems that I've decreed the right match, didn\u2019t I?\" He said, \"Fifth Brother is very satisfied with General Huo!\"Jiang Suizhou held back his nausea and hurriedly explained along with his words, \"That\u2019s not quite the case...his wild nature is difficult to tame, so I can only use some tactics. Brother Emperor, please don\u2019t mention it again.\"His Majesty discerned the relish in his tone and laughed heartily.\"Good, good, I won't mention anything in Fifth Brother's room anymore,\" he said.\"However, in another half month, it will be my birthday banquet. Fifth Brother, there is no royal consort in your house, so why not let Madam Huo accompany you to the banquet?\"Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth.Here we go again.The last time he asked Huo Wujiu to enter the palace to \"return to maternal home,\" he rejected it for Huo Wujiu, but he didn't expect that His Majesty would continue to persist on the matter. It seemed that he had to bring Huo Wujiu into the palace once before he would stop.Jiang Suizhou was busy thinking of countermeasures, pondering for a moment, and did not reply for a while.The look of distress on his face made His Majesty think that he was embarrassed again. In an instant, he became more spirited and smilingly said, \"Fifth Brother, although I married him off to you, you shouldn\u2019t keep your concubine in your love nest like this, you know? When everyone comes with their families by then, what will you look like alone?\"Before Jiang Suizhou could say anything, he saw His Majesty grin and ask, \"Uncle, don\u2019t you agree?\"Pang Shao echoed, \"Your Majesty is right. I heard that His Highness's two concubines, one from a brother and the other a commoner, are not worthy to grace your table, so how can they be brought before Your Majesty?\"The two echoed each other, making His Majesty all the more elated.Jiang Suizhou pursed his lips. He knew that this time, he could not avoid it.He paused and answered in a low voice, \u201cThis minister will comply with your decree.\"His Majesty beamed in response: \u201cThat\u2019s more like it \u2014\u2014 Alas, Fifth Brother, I don't know what is so wonderful about men that makes you reluctant to part with them so much!\"He sighed with emotion and did not expect a reply from Jiang Suizhou.But Jiang Suizhou felt suffocated this time. Upon hearing his sigh, he raised his eyes to him and breezily said, \"As for the mystery, Brother Emperor will know once you try it.\"Hearing his words, the emperor subconsciously looked at him, and his gaze swept over the court of men.They were all middle-aged and old men, with wrinkles all over their faces. Among them were a few particularly ugly, such as that big man, Ji Hongcheng. He was dark and tall, and was quite conspicuous in the crowd. From a distance, he was as ugly as a ghost.His Majesty was rendered speechless for a moment and felt his stomach churn a bit.\u2014\u2014Ever since His Majesty ascended to the throne, his annual birthday has become the most important banquet of the year for the Jing Dynasty. Not only should the banquet be held extravagantly, but the ceremonies before the banquet should also be held with the grandest pomp; so half a month in advance, the Ministry of Rites became busy.After Jiang Suizhou left the court, he rushed to the Ministry of Rites and did not return until nightfall.The lights flickered, and an invitation was placed on the table in front of Huo Wujiu.It was sent by a court official named Chen Ti. Huo Wujiu had no impression of this person, but he was probably young and with a low official post.Chen Ti invited Huo Wujiu to his residence in a month\u2019s time for a flower appreciation banquet hosted by his wife.The handwriting on the letter was pretty regular script in lower case \u00a0calligraphy. There was a layer of fragrance floating on it, which was undoubtedly used by the ladies for socializing.Without having to think about it, Huo Wujiu knew that this person was trying to please others and had invited him there specifically to humiliate him.These people, however, had always been proficient at packaging such ugly thoughts magnificently \u2014\u2014 They pretended to be ignorant of Huo Wujiu's original identity and who he was. Instead, they regarded him as the beloved lady in King Jing's mansion and wrote a letter to him, as if they really wanted to invite him to enjoy the flowers together.Huo Wujiu knew that as a prisoner, he should be able to endure any humiliation. But the incense on the letterhead drifted to his nose and still made him irritable.Just then, Sun Yuan came in from outside. He saw that Meng Qianshan was not beside him, and hurriedly stuffed a thin object into Huo Wujiu's hand.It was another letter.The envelope was not signed and was discreetly folded tightly, resembling the letter sent by Ji Hongcheng a few days ago.It had only been a few days. What kind of secret news was there to send him?Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze and opened the letter.Then a line of extremely scrawled, angry words jumped to his eyes.[King Jing is shameless and really inhumane!]Huo Wujiu gave a start, and the irritation that was suppressed in his heart dissipated somehow. Even an untraceable arc rose in the corners of his lips.He moved his hand and turned the letter to the next page.He was a little expectant. He wanted to see what inhumane words His Highness Jing had said during the court today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the letter, Huo Wujiu figured that Ji Hongcheng wrote it for Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes.After all, even if Ji Hongcheng was stupid, he would not believe that his letter could be delivered to Huo Wujiu so easily, especially right under Jiang Suizhou's eyes.In the letter, he detailed the evil deeds of Jiang Suizhou this morning; from the time he met Jiang Suizhou to the impudent remarks Jiang Suizhou made in the court. Ji Hongcheng castigated each of them at length.Because he was a military official with little culture, his emotions got the best of him, and he wrote several crude profanities in the letter that couldn\u2019t be spoken in public.The letter was used to scold Jiang Suizhou.The corners of Huo Wujiu\u2019s mouth involuntarily rose as he read on.He did not expect that His Highness, King Jing, who was careful in front of him and had to deliberate on his words for a long time, would be so arrogant behind the scenes. He was so self-confident in his righteousness to the point of lying to all the civil servants of the court.He said he defiled him? And that he used some \"tricks\" because his wild nature was untamed?Huo Wujiu's fingers involuntarily rubbed the edge of the letter slowly.He suddenly wanted to see what Jiang Suizhou looked like when he blatantly said these words.Sun Yuan, who was standing behind him, was alarmed.Beneath the candlelights, he didn\u2019t know what Madam Huo read, but the curvature of his mouth actually stretched wider and wider. He was born cold and sharp, so his smile at this moment was rather like a wild beast in the dark, ready to pounce and bite off his prey's throat.Huo Wujiu quickly finished reading the letter.But then, Sun Yuan saw him pause. He glanced up to the beginning of the letter, and carefully read it again....Huh?!Sun Yuan even thought for a moment that what he had sent to Huo Wujiu was a secret letter to assassinate the present emperor.\u2014\u2014 Otherwise, how could he be so interested?...Should I notify His Highness?Just then, the candle flame on the table jumped slightly, and some footsteps sounded faintly outside the window.Jiang Suizhou has returned.Sun Yuan also heard the faint sound. He quickly stepped forward, took off the lampshade for Huo Wujiu, signaling him to quickly burn the letter.Huo Wujiu brought the letter to the lamp, but stopped when the fire was about to lick the edge of the paper.Sun Yuan looked at him in surprise.He witnessed Huo Wujiu pause and actually take back the letter.He folded the letter again and put it into his sleeves.His behavior struck Sun Yuan dumb.Huo Wujiu raised his eyes to him, his gaze quiet and indifferent. The curvature of his lips also disappeared.\u201cWhy are you standing frozen there?\u201d He asked.His eyes were pitch-black and deep, as if they could dig out a person's heart and see through it. Sun Yuan was stupefied, but he hurriedly reattached the lampshade amidst the sound of approaching footsteps.\u2014\u2014It was already very late at night when Jiang Suizhou returned to his house.The morning court session had exhausted him enough, and he was busy at the Ministry of Rites. By the time it was dark, he was already drifting a bit on his feet.Fortunately, Ji You knew that he was unwell, so he did not make things difficult for him. Ji You transferred a large part of the work that Jiang Suizhou should have been in charge of to his disciples.Because of this, Jiang Suizhou was able to return home at this time.He rode all the way back to the courtyard in his palanquin. He felt parched as he entered the door heavy-headed. Sitting down at the table, Jiang Suizhou asked Meng Qianshan to pour him tea.Meng Qianshan noticed his pallor, so he quickly brought the teacup into Jiang Suizhou's hand. He bowed and asked, \"How are you, Your Highness? Shall I send someone to call the doctor to check your pulse?\u201dJiang Suizhou waved his hand and when he spoke again, his voice was hoarse and was a bit breathless. \"No need.\"He felt dizzy and exhausted at the moment. Instead of asking the doctor to toil until midnight, he should just rest earlier.Meng Qianshan complied uneasily and retreated to the side.Jiang Suizhou took a few sips of tea, moistened his throat, and felt much better.He put the cup back on the table and was about to get up to wash, when he saw an envelope on the table.It looked beautiful and exquisite, like a love letter from a girl to her crush.Jiang Suizhou couldn't help but be a little curious. \"Who sent this letter?\"Meng Qianshan had brought this letter to Huo Wujiu today, so he knew the content of the letter. Once Jiang Suizhou asked, it was as if Meng Qianshan had found a place to complain, so he quickly stepped forward and cut in, \"Your Highness, it's from Mrs. Chen, Lord Chen Ti\u2019s wife!\"Chen Ti?Jiang Suizhou frowned.Although he was only a fifth-rank official, he was a distant relative of Pang Shao's. He was not much else, but was an expert at toadying for personal gain. He was the best at kissing Pang Shao's ass, so he was making a good living in the capital.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a letter of invitation inside inviting Huo Wujiu to go to his family's back courtyard in a month\u2019s time to enjoy the flowers.Jiang Suizhou frowned deeper and deeper, and before finishing reading the letter, he stuffed the letter with the envelope into Meng Qianshan's hand.All of them were bad news.That fatuous emperor and those bunches of bootlickers in the court were entirely to blame for why the Jing Dynasty was on the verge of collapse.They were plagued with leisure all day long and didn\u2019t know how to enhance national strength against Northern Liang. On the contrary, they were obsessed with finding ways to humiliate the captive of the enemy country.The emperor forced Jiang Suizhou to let Huo Wujiu take part in the palace banquet earlier this morning, and now there was an insignificant official also strutting around to have fun with Huo Wujiu. Jiang Suizhou was already tired, and the irritation that he had accumulated throughout the day burst out uncontrollably.He rarely displayed his anger, but his tone even contained a thin layer of it. \"Send it back to where it came from.\"Meng Qianshan was startled: \"Your Highness...\"Jiang Suizhou swept him a sidelong glance: \"What? I don't want him to go see the rubbish flowers in his garden. Is there a problem?\"Meng Qianshan shook his head repeatedly, and even though he had some reservations, he did not dare to say anything.But at that moment, Huo Wujiu spoke up.\"Pang Shao must have authorized him to do so, and they will not rest until they achieve their goal.\"Jiang Suizhou was about to pick his teacup on the table, when he heard the low voice out of the blue. He moved with a start and looked at Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu remained seated in his wheelchair, and when he saw Jiang Suizhou staring at him, he quietly continued. \"They are targeting me. It's none of your business,\" he said.Huo Wujiu knew that since he was in Southern Jing, such things would definitely not be rare. He was lucky to escape once or twice before, all because Jiang Suizhou defended him behind the scenes.For every time Jiang Suizhou held them off, that group of people would take the opportunity to rip a piece of flesh off of him. How many valuable things could King Jing have on him that would be enough to keep them at bay in front of him?He did not want to be this shrinking tortoise, nor did he want to let another person be a shield for him.After saying these words, he distinctly felt Jiang Suizhou's stunned gaze. This made Huo Wujiu's heartbeat inexplicably skip a couple of beats. Huo Wujiu hastily averted his gaze and did not look at him again.He hoped King Jing wouldn\u2019t think too much of it. He just wanted to clarify that he could do without Jiang Suizhou\u2019s self-sacrificing goodwill\u2026But then he heard Jiang Suizhou\u2019s hoarse voice sink.\u201cNone of my business?\u201d He sneered. \"You\u2019re married to me. How can it be none of my business? Is it not my dignity that\u2019s trampled upon when you, a big man, mingle with women to enjoy the flowers?\u201dAfter saying this, Jiang Suizhou went to the back room to shower.As he walked out, he was still inwardly cursing.If you let me live and don\u2019t cut off my head after three years, then it\u2019s naturally none of my business!Of course, he knew that Pang Shao was behind the little official who dared to send such a letter to his palace. As for why Pang Shao supported him \u2014\u2014 it was naturally because this move would please the emperor very much.Of course, Pang Shao was also more than happy to see it.During this period, that group of people tortured Jiang Suizhou, and he learned how to understand their tricks. In any case, if he could stop something, he would stop it. If he couldn\u2019t, he would put it off for a later time.With that decision, Jiang Suizhou cleaned up and took a bath, before coming out of the back room.He was exhausted from the day. Once cleaned, he felt as if he was treading on air from the fatigue. He just wanted to fall into bed and get a good night's sleep.But as soon as he returned to his bedroom and was about to go to his couch, he found Huo Wujiu sitting on his couch, quietly reading a book....What is he doing?Jiang Suizhou was a bit confused and stopped in his place.Huo Wujiu heard his footsteps and raised his head. He pointed in the direction of the bed with his chin, poker-faced.\"Go sleep there.\" His tone was crisp and sharp, as if he was giving orders to his soldiers.Jiang Suizhou was a bit overwhelmed. He looked in the direction of the bed. He saw that the bed was neat and tidy. Moreover, there was a pill on the low table next to the bed.\"And the medicine on the table, eat it.\u201d Jiang Suizhou heard Huo Wujiu say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 22.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 22.1Jiang Suizhou decided that Huo Wujiu wasn\u2019t going to poison him to death.But...Why was he giving him medicine?He looked at Huo Wujiu suspiciously and stood motionless for a while.Right at that moment, a breeze blew in from the open window. It was perceptibly a refreshing warm breeze, but it swept the water vapor on Jiang Suizhou's body and made him cough violently.He had a hacking cough, \u00a0probably because his immunity was already poor. Plus, he was drained today, so his body was even weaker.When he stopped coughing a few moments later, his voice was hoarse, and his eyes were covered with a layer of mist.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes in a daze, and through the hazy mist, he found that someone had closed the window.Huo Wujiu sat under the window reading a book, without raising his eyes.Jiang Suizhou regulated his breathing before sheepishly heading to the bed and sitting on the edge of it....My bed, so comfy!The bed was spacious; the quilt was thick; the material used was also thick and soft. The mere touch of it made him feel like half of his soul was going to sink in.Jiang Suizhou was somewhat moved. After all, since his arrival in this world, he still hadn\u2019t experienced what it was like to sleep in bed.His original intention of excusing himself and letting the handicapped person return to sleep in the bed was thus forsaken.\u2014\u2014Since Huo Wujiu gave it to him, it would be fine for him to sleep for a night. He wasn\u2019t a bully.With this in mind, he lifted the quilt. As he moved, the tiny object placed on the table caught his eyes again.His eyes fell on the medicine on the table.What kind of m-medicine was it?Jiang Suizhou was totally uncertain. He looked at the medicine, and then looked at Huo Wujiu who did not say a word.Jiang Suizhou didn't really want to eat it. After all, he didn't even know what it was. But he also knew that even if Huo Wujiu wanted to poison him, he would not use such a direct method.What if Huo Wujiu was well-intentioned, and Jiang Suizhou upset him because he didn't eat it?After weighing his options for a moment, Jiang Suizhou still believed in Huo Wujiu's character and ate the medicine before laying down on the bed.It was so comfortable. How could there be such a thing as this bed?Jiang Suizhou was so tired and dizzy that he pulled the covers over him and disappeared into dreamland.He did not see Huo Wujiu, who was sitting on the couch, quietly staring at him after he drifted off to sleep....He looks shrewd, but he dares to take the medicine given by an enemy without knowing what it is.The medicine he put on the table was exactly the one he brought out of prison. This pill was the most beneficial for boosting qi and blood. He took one in prison when he was disoriented from the pain, hanging on for dear life. A month down the road, he had a few pills left in his hand. Last time, he also used two pills to intimidate Doctor Zhou.He saw that Jiang Suizhou had fallen into a deep sleep on the bed....He\u2019s a bit stupid.Huo Wujiu raised his hand and extinguished the candle flame at the table.For a time, the bedroom fell into a quiet darkness, leaving only the window paper blowing in the breeze, quietly drumming.Huo Wujiu glanced at the window....I wonder how he turned so weak like this. A gust of wind that I didn't even feel could blow the man straight into a coughing fit and cause him to cough up tears.Jiang Suizhou was in such a condition, yet he was still thinking of protecting him?\u2014\u2014When Jiang Suizhou woke up the next day, he felt refreshed, feeling like he had never slept so well before.He didn\u2019t know if it was because of him finally sleeping in a bed or because of the medicine Huo Wujiu gave him. Regardless, Jiang Suizhou woke up this day, feeling that his breath was a lot lighter.However, the affairs of the Ministry of Rites still needed to be completed.Jiang Suizhou has studied the ritual system of the Jing Dynasty. He knew how cumbersome it was, but never imagined it to be troublesome to this extent.It was all because of the emperor\u2019s lavish extravagance.Recently, due to the need to compare various details, Jiang Suizhou had obtained the previous birthday banquet book records of the emperor.When the emperor held a banquet in the first year of his accession to the throne, it was less than a year after the death of the former Emperor, and the palace in Lin'an was only half built. It was a time of war and chaos, and the treasury was empty. But even then, the emperor's birthday banquet was extremely extravagant, twice as much as the previous emperor's customs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 22.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 22.2In the past two years, Southern Jing gradually settled down in Lin'an, and the specifications of the banquet also rose every year.Consequently, the Ministry of Rites was also thrown off their feet.Under such circumstances, even though Jiang Suizhou received a lot of care from Ji You and did not have to work until midnight, he was still only able to return to his house on time, not early. And even so, when he returned to the house every day, he was still so tired that he felt like he was walking on air. He felt dizzy, and he was so sickly that he wished he could throw himself down.However, he rested well every day.Huo Wujiu seemed to have forgotten that the bed was his turf. Every day when Jiang Suizhou wanted to rest, Huo Wujiu would take the couch so that Jiang Suizhou could sleep on the bed.Jiang Suizhou wanted to remind Huo Wujiu every day to switch back with him, but he was so beaten every day and the bed was so comfortable that he put off the idea again and again.Because of this, although Jiang Suizhou was tired during this period, he slept soundly every night. When he got up the next morning, he was more or less recharged and wouldn\u2019t be really burnt-out.To a certain degree, this credit was all due to Huo Wujiu. Even when Jiang Suizhou looked at Huo Wujiu every day, he felt that the latter was quite pleasing to the eye.He also gradually formed a delicate balance with Huo Wujiu.The two of them still had little communication, but because they lived in the same courtyard, they would have two meals together every morning and evening. After they finished eating, if it was early in the day, they would stay on their respective side in the bedroom, each doing their own thing.It was quite peaceful.This lasted until the 15th of the month.Although Jiang Suizhou was busy, he still kept in mind the account book that he found in the study.On the morning of the 15th, he called Meng Qianshan aside as soon as he had eaten breakfast.\"Have you brought back the account book for this month?\" He asked in an unclear and meaningful way.Of course, he fooled Meng Qianshan. Hearing him ask, he hastily took out a thin piece of paper from his bosom.\"It was only delivered last night, so I thought I would give it to you when you return from work today,\" he reported with a smile.Jiang Suizhou took the account and saw that the details were noted in it, which consisted of the entire diet and living expenses of a family of two in a month. Because these two people never went out, their expenses were very little. There wasn\u2019t much money spent a month down the line.Jiang Suizhou glanced at Meng Qianshan and said, \"This month's expenses are a little less.\"Meng Qianshan replied, \"Is it? That young lady doesn't spend much money, and the old lady's wind chill has been treated. Hence, she doesn't even need money for medicine.\"Jiang Suizhou paused, then tried: \"That's good. If they need to spend money for something, there\u2019s no need to save. These two people are important and must be taken care of.\"Meng Qianshan immediately took the bait.He smiled naively, nodded repeatedly and echoed, \"Don't worry, Master. I will save you the trouble! I will definitely not let Madam Gu\u2019s family suffer an ounce of hardship!\"Jiang Suizhou was stunned....Madam Gu?Unexpectedly, the original owner had actually detained Gu Changyun\u2019s family in the house in order to make him obey him.It was no wonder that among these two people\u2019s expenses, there were no travel expenditures. On the contrary, a huge amount of money was spent on the hiring of guards. It was no wonder that Gu Changyun didn't resent him a tiny bit even after testing him. It was as if he didn't have any master-servant relationship with the original owner\u2026Jiang Suizhou paused and put the account book away.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you know.\u201d He gently nodded, then turned around and walked out.He finally got to the bottom of Gu Changyun\u2019s details. Now, he desperately wanted to know in what way Xu Du was brought under the original owner\u2019s command.He had not forgotten that on the 15th day of every month, he had a money exchange with Xu Du. From this, he might be able to get a glimpse of Xu Du's bottom line.After returning from the Ministry of Rites tonight, he needed to make a trip to Xu Du's courtyard.While Jiang Suizhou internally devised plans, he walked out of the courtyard and entered the palanquin parked outside the courtyard.There were still a bunch of chores waiting for him at the Ministry of Rites, and he also obtained important news about his staff at this time. So many things occupied his mind that he forgot to tell Meng Qianshan that he would not be returning to the courtyard for dinner this evening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Afterwards, he returned to the royal residence.He didn't forget about Xu Du's matter and went to Xu Du's courtyard as soon as he returned.Gu Changyun didn\u2019t know of his visit beforehand, so he was absent \u2014\u2014 This was precisely Jiang Suizhou\u2019s purpose for not informing him. There were some things that he needed to discuss with Xu Du in private.Xu Du had just prepared dinner in his courtyard, and when he saw Jiang Suizhou, he acted very calmly, asking the serving maids to add a set of bowls and chopsticks, and then dismissing them all.Once the servants withdrew, only the two of them were left.Xu Du's residence was quite quiet, with bamboo shadows swaying outside the window and the fragrance of ink lingering in the room. There was a chess game on the table in front of the window, with an unsolved game on top.Jiang Suizhou sat at the table and looked at Xu Du, and saw Xu Du smiling gently.\"Master actually knows that there are matters to be handed over to me on the 15th of every month,\" he said. \"I am not as resourceful as Changyun, and was thinking of what method to use to see you in case you were unaware.\"Xu Du said this bluntly, laying Jiang Suizhou\u2019s identity on the table.Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t dodge the accusation. Relying on the lack of audio and video equipment in ancient times, he stated outright, \"There are a number of records in the study from which I glimpsed a clue or two from, and know that I have a transaction with you today.\"Xu Du froze, not expecting him to be so blunt.\"I have only seen this kind of spirit possession in books since childhood. I never imagined that this speculation was true,\" he said slowly.Jiang Suizhou gave a faint smile: \"I didn\u2019t want to be here either. It was a coincidence, so I really had no choice.\"Xu Du laughed.\"It is fascinating. Witnessing this unheard-of phenomenon makes my birth and walk in life worthwhile,\u201d he said.Xu Du acted open-minded and natural. Jiang Suizhou looked at him for a moment and said, \"Now then, I still don't know what the scheme with you is.\u201dXu Du smiled and asked, \"Which aspect of the plot is Master talking about?\"Jiang Suizhou replied, \"You already know. Although I became King Jing, I am \u00a0not him. You all have your own purposes for being his wingmen. I know now that Gu Changyun\u2019s family is under duress, so what about you?\"A momentary surprise flashed across Xu Du\u2019s face.\u201cMaster even found out about this?\u201d Xu Du asked.Jiang Suizhou regarded him quietly.After a while, Xu Du burst into laughter and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed because of this for Gu Changyun. His parents died early, so he, his grandmother and younger sister depended on each other. At that time, our Master approached him, but he did not want to get involved in the strife of the court, so our Master used some tricks,\" he said. \"Unexpectedly, you\u2019re so astute that you even discovered this.\"\"What about you?\" Jiang Suizhou asked him.Xu Du paused and raised his eyes to look at him, his gaze clear and bright.\"I come from a merchant background and had no way to enter the officialdom,\" he answered, \"But I aspire to be part of the country\u2019s annals. All I want in life is fame and fortune.\"Jiang Suizhou knew that the Jing Dynasty had just started the imperial examinations, and the requirements for the family background of those who entered the service were extremely strict. Within the five categories, as long as you were a merchant, opera singer, or prostitute, you were barred from participating in the examination.Jiang Suizhou paused and then asked, \"So, you then joined King Jing's command?\"Xu Du laughed a couple of times.\"I\u2019m a nobody, and apart from His Highness King Jing, who is in a tight spot, I really had no other means,\" he said.\"Moreover, although I want to achieve fame and fortune, I shouldn\u2019t stoop to low levels. If I join Pang Shao's sect, won't I have to do something that will leave a dirty mark for years to come?\" He stated frankly.Jiang Suizhou believed 80% of his words. He pondered for a moment and asked, \"So, what is the money given to you on the 15th of every month used for?\"He knew that the credibility of a person's words depended on his actions. Whether Xu Du was honest with him or not depended on these important matters.Jiang Suizhou quietly looked at Xu Du, then saw him turn around. Xu Du went to the hidden compartment in the bookshelf and took out an account book. He returned to the table and handed it to Jiang Suizhou.\"His Highness has saved up money over the past few years and raised a batch of dead soldiers,\" he informed. \"There are a few with a total of ten or so. Since dead soldiers need to be personally trained for many years before they can be used with confidence, His Highness sought me out and handed the matter of raising and training dead soldiers to me.\"Jiang Suizhou was inwardly surprised, but nothing showed on his face as he took the record and flipped through it carefully.He committed each man's serial number and expenditure to memory, along with the date. The detailed notes in a month accumulated into a thick book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After a long time, Jiang Suizhou put down the account book. He took out the money he had prepared and gave it to Xu Du according to the amount in the account book.This was to tell Xu Du through his actions that he trusted him.Xu Du smiled and reached his hand out, taking the silver bills.\"You have done extremely well,\" Jiang Suizhou commended. \"There are still many places where you can be used in the future.\"Xu Du smiled lightly. \"Master, just give me the order.\"After a moment, Jiang Suizhou looked up at him: \"But, have you ever thought about the future?\"Xu Du did not say a word and tilted his head, indicating him to continue.Jiang Suizhou spoke unhurriedly.\u201cRise and fall is a natural law,\u201d he began, \u201cIf a dynasty\u2019s days are numbered, and another rising sun gradually ascends, how can you obtain the fame and fortune you want?\"When Xu Du heard this, he did not say anything for a long time.After a spell, he laughed, clear and crisp.\"Everyone is convinced that the division of the two dynasties into the north and the south of the river is a foregone conclusion and will last for hundreds of years \u2014\u2014 Under these circumstances, even if Northern Liang still has Huo Wujiu, it will not change. Why do you think that the Southern Jing\u2019s days are numbered?\"Jiang Suizhou asked, \"Why was Huo Wujiu captured?\"Xu Du replied, \"He faced the enemy alone, and his reinforcements were cut off.\"Jiang Suizhou continued, \"Then, what about the Southern Jing's court now?\"Xu Du faltered and then laughed, \"Master is saying that Huo's defeat is because his horse tripped, and Jing's defeat is because its foundation is rotten?\"Jiang Suizhou\u2019s silence was his tacit approval.Xu Du was rendered speechless for a while. Then he stood up and gave a deep salute to Jiang Suizhou. \u201cIn this dire straits, I originally didn't have much hope, but I\u2019d like to wait and see. Every step is a last resort,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, it is my good fortune to have met a wise master. I'm sure my Lord already has plans for what the future holds. I will follow your orders and be your right arm.\"Jiang Suizhou paused and was momentarily tongue-tied. Xu Du had spoken to him and was willing to believe in him, which was naturally good. But the hat that Xu Du put on him was too high, which made him vacillate for a while.What about the future? What were his plans?He just knew that in the near future, they would be wiped out by Huo Wujiu in one go.\u2014\u2014Silence reigned in Anyin Hall.Dinner time had passed, but their Master had not returned.Meng Qianshan was so anxious that he paced around, and at every turn, he sneaked a glance at Huo Wujiu.Meng Qianshan saw Huo Wujiu sitting at the table quietly reading a book. He didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion, but he felt that even after half an hour, Madam Huo still hadn't turned a page of the book in his hand.Meng Qianshan sent someone to ask.A few moments later, a young servant sprinted back all the way into the main house and ran to Meng Qianshan, panting.\u201cEunuch Qianshan, His Highness has gone to Madam Xu's room,\" he reported, \"A maid in Madam Xu's courtyard just came to report, saying that His Highness hadn't left instructions in advance. As soon as he returned to the house, he headed straight there.\"Aigoo! How can this be!This servant reported in the room while Madam Huo was sitting nearby, hearing everything clearly. Now, even if Meng Qianshan wanted to contrive a lie to coax Madam Huo, it was impossible.Meng Qianshan waved his hand quickly and drove the servant out.When the servant retreated, Meng Qianshan mustered up a flattering smile on his face. He went to Huo Wujiu's side and told the maid beside him: \"Why are you so thoughtless? The dishes are all cool, so why don't you go heat them up...\" He swallowed the rest of the words in his belly.Madam Huo, who was sitting there, put down his book without looking up. He picked up his chopsticks and used them to take food from the cold dishes.He ate the meal alone.Meng Qianshan felt an indescribable feeling for a moment....It wasn\u2019t just the roomful of servants who were waiting for His Highness\u2019s return for the meal. Madam Huo, who usually ignored His Highness, was actually also waiting to eat with him.Moreover, Madam Huo was obviously...totally unhappy at the moment.If so, Meng Qianshan knew that only the mischief maker could undo his mischief. Madam Huo's spirit was a little low at the moment, and this was something that servants like them couldn\u2019t handle. They could only wait for His Highness\u2019s return from the dinner, and then personally coax this ancestor.With this in mind, Meng Qianshan warily served Huo Wujiu until he finished his meal. He, however, never imagined that after dinner, His Highness still didn\u2019t return.Until a long time later...a maid from Madam Xu's place arrived.\"Eunuch Qianshan, His Highness will rest at Madam Xu's place today,\u201d said the maid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he returned home, he had a showdown with Xu Du, so he ate merely a few bites of the dinner.When the dinner was cleared, and he was ready to leave, he had a dizzy spell when he stood up, making him almost plunge to the ground.Xu Du held him up.\"Your Highness is weak, so you mustn\u2019t overwork,\" Xu Du advised.Jiang Suizhou steadied himself and took a few breaths before he regained his strength. He propped himself up on the table with one hand and waved his hand feebly. \"Because of His Majesty\u2019s birthday banquet, the Ministry of Rites is busy day in and day out.\"Xu Du helped him sit on a couch. He then turned around and lit up the soothing incense. He said, \"Yes, at this time every year, the court is very busy. Should I send someone to ask the mansion doctor to come and check you out?\"Jiang Suizhou shook his head.\"No need,\" he declined. \"A troubling round trip will only tire unnecessary people.\"Xu Du nodded. \"Indeed. Then I'll ask someone to brew a calming soup for Your Highness \u2014\u2014 Why don\u2019t you rest here today?\"His proposal was reasonable. After all, the back courtyard was far away from Anyin Hall, and there was a vast garden in between. Wherever Jiang Suizhou went, he had to ride in a palanquin. It was inconvenient to walk around the garden in a palanquin, so he had to take a detour.Enduring a bumpy ride while the wind blew was too tiring.Jiang Suizhou was moved, but then suddenly thought of something and hesitantly asked, \"Do you have an extra bed in your room?\"Xu Du smiled: \"Don't worry, Your Highness. There is a Bisha cupboard 1 in the room. Changyun usually comes to stay here and sleeps there.\"Hearing that both of them had beds to sleep on, Jiang Suizhou nodded in relief.So long as there was a bed to lie in, why should he care where he slept?So, that night, he rested in Xu Du's room.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou did not sleep well that night.He didn\u2019t know if the ink fragrance in the room was too light, or if the bed Xu Du used to sleep on was a bit hard. In short, Jiang Suizhou felt like something was missing in the room.He tried to sleep, but kept waking up all night long. When he got up in the morning, the soles of his feet were like stepping on cotton, and underneath his eyes were a little blue.There was also a Grand Court Assembly today.The moment Jiang Suizhou rose from the bed early in the morning, his head felt heavy and his feet light. He was also groggy.He was a bit chagrined. If only he hadn't been lazy last night and gone back to sleep in his own courtyard.Meng Qianshan was waiting outside the courtyard early in the morning.Meng Qianshan didn't deliver him his court uniform because he had to go through the front courtyard to get out of the house from here anyway. Jiang Suizhou had a casual breakfast at Xu Du's place and went back to Anyin Hall.When he entered the door, he found a tall and straight figure sitting at the table in the main hall.The bright daylight elongated his shadow until it touched the ink bamboo painting hanging in front of the hall. He was akin to a sharp blade chopping into the depths of the bamboo forest.It was Huo Wujiu, having his breakfast.Jiang Suizhou crossed the threshold and saw Huo Wujiu eating by himself, sitting straight and upright, with no intention of paying attention to him.This kind of cold treatment was all too familiar to Jiang Suizhou. It was so familiar that it felt a little homely, which dissipated a bit of his irritation for having a troubled sleep all night.He didn\u2019t fuss about Huo Wujiu, nor rush to greet him. He only acted as if he didn't see this man, and then let Meng Qianshan support him as he bypassed Huo Wujiu to change his robes in the inner room.While walking, Meng Qianshan also rambled and complained, \u201cMaster, did Madam Xu serve you well yesterday? I find Your Highness\u2019s complexion terrible\u2026\u201dJiang Suizhou immediately interrupted him when he heard this. \u201cShut it,\u201d he ordered.Meng Qianshan repeatedly nodded.Jiang Suizhou paused and said, \"The window paper in Xu Du's room is a bit old, so ask someone to go there later and see if there are any items that need to be changed. Replace them with new ones.\"The window papers were indeed in disrepair. Whistling wind blew in all night. Although other people could not feel it, Jiang Suizhou suffered from it. When he got up early in the morning, his nose felt clogged.Meng Qianshan again repeatedly nodded.The two talked while heading to the inner room.Jiang Suizhou did not see that the moment he walked around the screen, Huo Wujiu raised his head and frowned at his back.His footsteps were unstable, and his eye bags were blue. He looked exhausted at a glance.Usually, even if Jiang Suizhou slept all night on the couch, Huo Wujiu had never seen him in such a tired state.If he got this exhausted overnight, what else could have caused it?Huo Wujiu inexplicably felt that the chopsticks in his hand were unmanageable. He could hardly use them to pick at a dish, and the force on his hand inevitably rose a few degrees heavier.He tried hard to focus on the food on his plate, but it didn't work.Jiang Suizhou's appearance just now kept popping up in his mind. He obviously only took one glance, but it got deeply imprinted in his mind. It hooked him so hard into guessing what Jiang Suizhou had done last night.The chopsticks in Huo Wujiu's hand seemed to have grown a blade, because he shredded the sauced beef in sauce in a couple of strokes.Footnote:1 Bisha cupboard - first used as a shelter from the summer heat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whether it was the wind and sand whistling like wolves howling in Yangguan, or the ice and snow covering and freezing his armor and flesh, he had always slept peacefully.It was only here, when there was just one less person at night, that he actually couldn\u2019t fall asleep....It\u2019s all about that King Jing.The sick man, who could hardly breathe after only taking a few steps by himself, didn't return to his room to rest, but had the energy to fool around in his concubine's room?Didn\u2019t he say that he fell for him and that he couldn\u2019t bear to put his hand on him? He called on someone else in his harem, and on the contrary, withstood it very much. When he returned afterwards, he was still thinking about changing window papers for others.What a plausible liar, with a mouthful of nonsense.King Jing was indeed a deceitful man.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou changed into his court uniform early in the morning and left in a hurry.Courtiers weren\u2019t allowed to bring attendants when they entered the palace, so Meng Qianshan sent Jiang Suizhou all the way to outside the palace gates and returned to Anyin Hall to serve the expressionless \"favored concubine\" who was sitting rigidly upright.This master was usually silent, and he did everything by himself. He was easy to serve. But today...Meng Qianshan felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right.As for what was wrong? Meng Qianshan also couldn\u2019t pinpoint it.This master normally didn\u2019t like to talk, and he didn\u2019t utter a single word today, either. He usually just sat in the corner reading by himself, and today was the same. Nothing was different from the usual.But Meng Qianshan always felt...that the air pressure in the house today was particularly low.This made him uncomfortable. He just felt breathless, like a flying insect that could not find a place to go and could only fly around the room.After careful consideration, Meng Qianshan inwardly reasoned that although Madam Huo wasn\u2019t fond of His Highness, he had thrown a tantrum from yesterday to today. Hence, there was no harm in pleasing this master and making him happy.With this in mind, Meng Qianshan cautiously walked to Huo Wujiu's side and stepped forward.\"Master, it\u2019s a perfect day today. Shall I accompany you to the garden for a walk?\"Sun Yuan, who was waiting by Huo Wujiu's side, heard the words and looked up at the sky outside the window, which was gray and cloudy.Lin\u2019an in the spring was rainy, and the sky had been cloudy for a while now. Therefore, there was no such thing as perfect weather.Sun Yuan looked down and saw Huo Wujiu looking at his book, not saying a word.Meng Qianshan knew that as long as this master made no objection, it meant that they were allowed to do whatever they wanted.Meng Qianshan was as happy as if he had received an imperial decree and hurriedly gave Sun Yuan a glance. \"Your master wants to visit the garden. Why don't you move faster?\"Sun Yuan promptly pushed the wheelchair and followed Meng Qianshan out of the courtyard.The layout of King Jing's residence was exquisite, and Anyin Hall was in the best location in the mansion. After leaving the courtyard and turning south, they entered the garden of the residence.The former owner of this garden was rich and sophisticated. There were 18 scenic spots in the garden, each of which had its own wonderful view and exquisiteness.Meng Qianshan had been serving here for three years and could walk through this garden with his eyes closed. Now that he was bent on pleasing Huo Wujiu, he went into a long, vivid monologue about the scenery everywhere they went.However, Huo Wujiu never applauded his performance.He sat in his wheelchair with a cold face without responding in the slightest. He was rather like a deaf man who could not hear a sound.Sun Yuan, on the other hand, pushed his wheelchair and listened with gusto. He looked wherever Meng Qianshan pointed and sometimes couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue and marvel at the beauty, earning looks of daggers from Meng Qianshan.However, Sun Yuan had always been a bit dense and failed to register Meng Qianshan\u2019s displeasure. He just followed and enjoyed the sights.They strolled through the garden until they crossed a stone bridge and went to a bamboo forest.\"Madam, look! That is the \u2018Youhuang Tingquan\u2019 2 in the mansion! That is not only a bamboo grove. After we cross the bridge and walk to that forest, you can see...\"Just then, Meng Qianshan\u2019s rich eloquent voice came to an abrupt halt.Sun Yuan did not understand, but he quickly followed his gaze.In the middle of the bamboo forest, there was a gurgling stream and a winding path. An open-air chess couch was set under the hundreds of green bamboos with a stone-carved chess board, which was very elegant.Right at this moment, two people were sitting on top of the chess couch.One was dressed in red, and the other in a green robe. They were playing a game in the grove.Meng Qianshan was so annoyed that he called upon his ancestors, wishing to slap himself in the face. He slammed the brakes under his feet and grabbed Sun Yuan's shoulder, forcing him to make a U-turn on the narrow and delicate stone bridge.\u201c...I remembered it wrong! It\u2019s but a ruined bamboo grove. There\u2019s nothing to see. It\u2019s a dead end in front. Turn around, and let's go to another place...\"But at that moment, the ancestor in the wheelchair, who had been silent, spoke up.\u201cIsn\u2019t there a Tingquan?\u201d He said. \"Why are you turning around? Keep going.\"The deep, cold voice sounded like it was squeezed out of his lips.Qianshan almost kneeled before him.You ignored me the entire way, but you were actually listening to me!Meng Qianshan quickly bowed down in an attempt to persuade this ancestor not to \"listen to the springwater\", but the moment he bowed, Huo Wujiu\u2019s side profile hit him straight in the eye.Meng Qianshan saw that Huo Wujiu\u2019s cold and sharp pitch-black eyes were devoid of his usual indifference and lack of interest, and was instead as sharp as a falcon\u2019s, looking straight ahead.For a moment, Meng Qianshan felt that this man was on the battlefield, with thousands of soldiers and horses behind him. Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes were burning like torches, as if in the next second, he would take off the head of the enemy himself.Meng Qianshan followed his eyes....This ancestor was looking at Xu Du.Footnote:2 Youhuang Tingquan \u00a0- a bamboo grove where you can listen to the sound of spring waterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they heard the sound of the wheelchair, they looked up. Both of them remained calm and composed, waiting for them to approach.Huo Wujiu in the wheelchair swept the two with a cold glance.He had a little impression of the red-clad man. He took after a lady, and his hands tended to wander. The first time they met, he reached out to touch his face.The other one\u2026Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes sharpened a bit coldly.Was he the one who mediated the last time they met? He twisted the claws of the man in red, and it was this man who methodically stepped forward to persuade and send someone to fetch the mansion doctor....So King Jing likes someone like him?Huo Wujiu coolly withdrew his gaze, and there were shades of disdain in his eyes that begged to disagree.In their barracks, the most annoying thing was this kind of scholar who would waste time chirping and smoothing things over. Just listening to people like him could make his head spin. However, considering King Jing\u2019s questionable character and his poor taste, it was normal for him to take a fancy to a man like him.Huo Wujiu fired a cold shot deep inside without realizing that he had included himself, whom King Jing had \"secretly admired for many years\", in the scope of his attack.He took a single glance and then withdrew his gaze. He looked upon them frostily, and hadn\u2019t had the slightest intention of greeting them.It was Gu Changyun who smilingly spoke first.\"The last time I saw this Madam Huo was some days ago, right?\" With fox eyes as soft as silk, he looked Huo Wujiu up and down for a good while. \"The feng shui of our King Jing Mansion is just nourishing. Look at you, Madam Huo. You look much better.\"Xu Du faintly glanced at him.He knew that before the fall of Gu Changyun's family, there were several concubines in his father's house. Gu Changyun had been influenced since childhood and knew the way of fighting in the harem. When he came to King Jing's residence, he especially loved to perform this tart play in front of outsiders.He usually didn't take up much of a fight, so he thought Huo Wujiu wouldn't take him up on it either.As expected, Huo Wujiu didn't say a word, but Meng Qianshan at the back bowed smilingly and said, \"Of course! After Madam Huo came to the mansion, everything was fine. Thank you for your concern, Madam Gu!\u201dWhile speaking, Meng Qianshan secretly elbowed Sun Yuan and smilingly continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that the Madams were playing chess here. I\u2019m slow-witted and disturbed your good mood...Sun Yuan, why aren\u2019t you bidding goodbye to the Madams?\u201dSun Yuan heard his cue, and obediently bowed to the two right away.However, before he could say the words of farewell, Gu Changyun interrupted him with a smile.\"What's the hurry?\" He said, \"Coming and going like that. Meng Qianshan, am I a man-eating tiger?\"Xu Du glanced at him.He had advised Gu Changyun many times not to fool around, but he also knew that Gu Changyun had experienced great ups and downs in his early years, and had developed this temperament of playing with the world and teasing everyone he met without fear of death. It was something that couldn\u2019t be easily changed.Seeing that Meng Qianshan smiled after he was asked, Xu Du opened his mouth and said, \"If you have no important matter to attend to, there is no hurry to leave. Does Madam Huo know how to play chess? If you do, why don't you come and see how to break this game?\"Huo Wujiu glanced at him. He hated playing chess the most.His father was a stinky chess player, but his military advisor was a national Go player. Since Yangguan was remote, his father did not want to let go of any resources to educate him, so he forced him to learn chess from that smiling tiger master.Huo Wujiu was so impatient with the uninteresting black and white pieces that he always messed up, and was so angry that his father confiscated his favorite Dayuan 1 horse as blackmail to force him to learn.Just because he knew how to play didn\u2019t mean he liked it.Huo Wujiu's cold eyes swept over Xu Du in front of him.A talkative mud stick, the boring black and white chessboard, and the provocative annoying one gathered together.When Sun Yuan, who was behind him, heard Xu Du's words, he looked left and right, not knowing who\u2019s order to follow. Then he saw Huo Wujiu raising his hand, signaling Sun Yuan to wait in place.Sun Yuan hurriedly did as he was told. He watched as Huo Wujiu rolled the wooden wheel of the wheelchair and approached the chessboard by himself.Xu Du looked at him.Huo Wujiu sat beside the chessboard with his eyes faintly drooping. He swept a glance around the game, and without half a second thought, he stretched out his hand, picked up a black piece and landed it on the board.Xu Du froze.However, Huo Wujiu didn't give him a chance to speak to him. After landing that piece, he withdrew his hand and pressed it on the wooden wheel. After he gave a push, the wheelchair turned around and drifted straight away.\"Go,\" he said.Sun Yuan immediately pushed him on, while Meng Qianshan hurriedly saluted the two and followed.Gu Changyun watched them all the way until they went far away, then he said to Xu Du with a surprised look on his face, \"Look at that, he\u2019s worthy of being a general. Even if he was locked up in the back courtyard, he\u2019s still this wild and rude. He cares for nobody.\"But Xu Du remained silent and didn\u2019t say a word.Footnote:1 Dayuan horse- known as heavenly horsesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw Xu Du staring at the chess game on the board, expressionless and lost for words.Gu Changyun smiled and teased him, and followed his gaze to the chess board: \"What's so captivating about this chess board? It's just...\"His speech came to an abrupt halt.On the board, Xu Du's white piece had forced his black piece into a desperate situation, but after Huo Wujiu's piece had settled, the black piece, like a trapped beast, bit down on the white piece's throat.The situation on the board had turned tables. The black piece recovered from its losing position and was gaining momentum.Gu Changyun froze and laughed.\"He's quite good at chess, huh?\" He said.Xu Du, however, shook his head.Just now, Huo Wujiu dropped that piece and raised his eyes to look at him when he withdrew his hand.His deep and cold black eyes, akin to the black chess pieces, were raging and ruthless; they were so cold that it made him feel like he had \u00a0plunged straight into a cold pool.For a moment there, Xu Du felt a chill down his back. It was as if Huo Wujiu wanted to kill all the white pieces on the chessboard.A moment passed, and he shook his head.Gu Changyun asked, \"What are you thinking about?\"Xu Du stayed silent for a moment.\"Nothing,\" he said, \"I just wonder...when did I provoke General Huo?\"\u2014\u2014After noon, it drizzled a bit.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes were blue underneath. After the morning court session, he wearily rushed to the Ministry of Rites again.Even though Ji You had taken great care of him, he couldn\u2019t just do nothing. Today, seeing that Jiang Suizhou looked terrible, Ji You took a look at the early morning sky outside and asked him to go outside the city to inspect a batch of materials needed to decorate the venue.Ji You smiled and told him that after he had made an inventory according to the account book, Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t have to return to the Ministry of Rites; he could just have the carts carrying the materials driven to the courtyard of the Ministry of Rites.Jiang Suizhou knew that Ji You was deliberately letting him off the hook so that Jiang Suizhou could return to his house early after his official work.He was very grateful. He not only thanked Ji You for his gentle nature and being a good man, but also thanked himself for shooting his mouth that day and chatted with Ji You more.However, after he left the Ministry of Rites, the rain fell heavier and heavier.Just as he left the northern city gates, someone came to report that the carriage transporting the materials had gotten stuck in the mud ten miles outside the city and could not get free.Now, that was a good deal of torment.The rain outside the city was worse than in the city, plus Lin'an roads were muddy outside. After the emperor arrived in Lin\u2019an, he utilized what little money he had left in his hands to repair his own imperial city and had never considered repairing the roads.Thus, the materials that could have been delivered in the afternoon didn\u2019t make it to the city gate until it was dark.Jiang Suizhou tagged along in the damp and cold wind outside the city for a whole day. When the caravan arrived, he had to command his men to count the goods and clean up the mud.By the time he returned to the royal residence, it was already the second night watch 1 .He ate something for dinner outside the city. When he returned to the house, he felt so tired that he could barely open his eyes. The moment he completed a little cleaning, he fell asleep.Meng Qianshan carefully waited for Jiang Suizhou to lie down on the bed, and then raised his eyes to look sideways.Madam Huo was sitting on his wheelchair next to the couch by the window. He lowered his head and quietly flipped through the book in his hand.Meng Qianshan roughly remembered that Madam Huo usually would not sleep so late...was it because the book he was reading was particularly interesting, and not because he was waiting for the King?Meng Qianshan didn't dare to ask, he just walked out quietly.The door to the room closed.The book in Huo Wujiu's hand rustled to another page.In the book, a poor talented scholar climbed over the courtyard wall of the Prime Minister's house and had a private tryst with a beautiful young lady under the moon. The young lady shyly handed him a silk handkerchief that she had embroidered herself, but the scholar grasped her soft hand\u2026Huo Wujiu's eyes fell on the page, but his gaze was empty.He was halfway through the book, but he didn't even understand what kind of book he was reading.A moment later, he raised his eyes and glanced in the direction of the bed.Jiang Suizhou was lying there, seemingly asleep.Huo Wujiu's fingers slowly crumpled the pages of the book.From the time he finished his evening meal alone at nightfall today, he was inexplicably annoyed, so annoyed that he couldn't register a single word.Huo Wujiu only thought that this irritation came from his legs.The injuries on his legs were gradually healing, but he hadn't been able to feel anything. It wasn\u2019t until a few days ago when the sky began to turn gloomy that he felt a twinge in his legs.But it was a vague tingling pain from the damaged meridians in his legs.The pain was different from the severe pain of being cut. It wasn\u2019t too severe, but felt more like a dull knife scraping his bones. But because that pain wasn\u2019t all that intense, a few days down the road, Huo Wujiu also did not suffer from it.Until it rained today.The dampness was provoking, and it was as if his injuries had sensed something. It affected his meridians all the way to his lumbar spine, and produced a bone-eating kind of pain.Huo Wujiu quietly endured it.Footnote:1 Second night watch - 21:00-23:00Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sat quietly with his book, but whenever footsteps came in or out, he would subconsciously concentrate and listen to the sound of those footsteps.He didn't know what he was waiting for, but every time he listened, irritation rose deep in his heart.Occasionally, he heard Meng Qianshan sending other servants out to ask when Jiang Suizhou would return. Multiple servants were sent several times, only for them to return saying that the king was busy.Huo Wujiu frowned without a trace.It wasn\u2019t until the sound of rain outside the window diminished and the hour-glass struck the second night watch that Huo Wujiu finally heard the particular sound of footsteps.It was somewhat floaty and not at all fast. As soon as it fell into Huo Wujiu's ears, he knew that Jiang Suizhou had returned.He lowered his eyes and turned a page of the book.Was he not going to spend the night at his concubine's today?An inaudible cold snort escaped from Huo Wujiu's lips. The irritation that had accumulated all night in his heart dissipated little by little with this sneer.Even the corners of his mouth were raised in an arc.However, Jiang Suizhou did not talk to him today, and after cleaning up a bit, he fell asleep on the bed.Now that no one was around, Huo Wujiu finally raised his head. His gaze quietly fell on him.Sick man. It was only yesterday, but after spending the night with that wimp and mud stick, you ended up this sapped. You\u2019re this weak, yet you still want to fill your harem aplenty?You\u2019re going to get yourself killed.Such a sickly man should be content with his lot and be protected under his wings. He should be kept in a safe house, away from the elements. He wouldn\u2019t let him suffer, and would never let him give birth to those flowery thoughts that would, in turn, attract others.These thoughts actually made Huo Wujiu\u2019s heart beat faster. It was as if the thoughts kindled something that made his heart itch a little.He stiffened, quietly withdrew his gaze, and picked up the book in his hand again as if trying to squash something.[Zhang Sheng clutched the soft and beautiful hand of the woman. It felt so soft and boneless that it made his heart and soul flutter. He found that a rosy tint had flown up to the lady\u2019s cheeks. Her eyes blinked timidly, and as the saying went\u2026]... What kind of messy books did Meng Qianshan find!He threw the book aside.The person on the bed was startled by the light clatter, and his shoulders trembled.Huo Wujiu heard the slightest sound and looked at the person on the bed who was wrapped tightly in the blanket. He appeared startled, but didn\u2019t wake up. He just turned over and continued sleeping....How strange. When Jiang Suizhou slept in the past, I have not seen him wrapped so tightly under the quilt.Huo Wujiu frowned, then heard heavy breathing from the bed, which sounded more strenuous than usual.Could it be that he was sick?Huo Wujiu didn't really want to care and was too lazy to cause trouble. He thought he\u2019d better call Meng Qianshan in.But his hands seemed to rebel against his command. He clearly should have maneuvered his wheelchair toward the door, but he inexplicably went straight to Jiang Suizhou's bedside.The man on the bed was wrapped tightly, and only his dark, silky hair could be seen scattered across the pillow.Huo Wujiu hesitated and stretched out his hand to touch Jiang Suizhou's shoulder through the quilt.The man was thin and so were his shoulders. Even through the heavy quilt, Huo Wujiu easily enveloped it with one hand.Huo Wujiu didn't have to exert much effort to turn him around....His face is abnormally pale. He\u2019s shaking, and his breathing is quivery.His eyes were tightly closed, and there wasn\u2019t much blood on his lips. His eyelashes fluttered, and his breathing was labored.When Huo Wujiu saw his extremely fragile appearance, he froze. And then, as if he was electric shocked, Huo Wujiu hastily let go of his shoulder in fear that he would hurt him.Then, he raised his hand somewhat clumsily and placed it on Jiang Suizhou's forehead....I think this is how to test whether a person has a fever, right?The temperature under his hand wasn\u2019t hot at all; instead, it was cool. He was probably frozen and hadn\u2019t warmed up yet.Huo Wujiu wanted to withdraw his hand and leave to call Meng Qianshan in.But at that moment, a cold hand strenuously stretched out from under the blanket and grabbed his hand.It was ice-cold and soft, and entirely frail, yet Huo Wujiu's hand froze in place.\"Don't go\u201d The man\u2019s voice in the bed shook. He was clearly lying on his bed, but he sounded as if he had fallen into an ice cave, shivering and holding a life-saving straw.Huo Wujiu heard Jiang Suizhou's chattering voice.\"Don't tell my mom. I'll be fine after a good night's sleep,\" he said.Huo Wugou didn't know who this \"mom\" was, but he could hear fear and confusion in Jiang Suizhou's almost inaudible voice.Jiang Suizhou sounded scared of making trouble.Huo Wujiu paused and somehow grasped Jiang Suizhou's hand back.His bony hand was quite long and slender. Huo Wujiu effortlessly wrapped the thin and weak hand into his.The unconscious Jiang Suizhou on the bed seemed to have found a heat source. He sighed softly, and actually struggled to pull that hand closer.The next moment, a cold and delicate cheek pressed against the back of Huo Wujiu's veiny hand.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He went to his mother with his grievances, but through the door, he saw his mother sitting alone in the room crying silently, as if she had lost her soul. It made him timid and afraid to share any of his grievances.The next moment, there was the disgusting smile of the emperor, and a bunch of courtiers he had only seen in portraits. They were staring at his every move with various expressions, making him nervous, fearful, and reluctant to speak out.A moment later again, Huo Wujiu was holding a bloody knife in his hand. His eyes were as cold as the day Jiang Suizhou took off his veil. Huo Wujiu was staring at him as if he would immediately cut off his head and take it to the city walls to air-dry.Jiang Suizhou wanted to run, but his legs were rooted in place. He watched as Huo Wujiu drew nearer and stretched out his blood-stained hand at him\u2026Jiang Suizhou simply closed his eyes tightly and waited for death, but unexpectedly, Huo Wujiu did not kill him....He actually reached out and touched my face.Jiang Suizhou only thought he was trying to figure out where to bury his knife on his neck, and he touched his face because it was crooked.But to his surprise, Huo Wujiu's hand pressed against his face and wouldn't let go.Jiang Suizhou also woke up groggily at this time.Like in a dream, he was muddled, and his body was burning. He opened his eyes in a daze and could only see a candle flame swaying, so bright that he could not open his eyes.Hl body felt unbearably heavy. He slowly inhaled and choked out a hoarse cough before he could speak.\u201cMaster!\u201dIt was Meng Qianshan's voice.Jiang Suizhou had a coughing fit that blurred his eyes. Just then, something he was holding in his hand suddenly gripped his hand.It was quite cold and very strong, and a hand pulled him to sit up.Then, another other hand fell on his back, slowly patting him until his cough gradually eased.Only then did Jiang Suizhou open his eyes that were blurred by tears.He saw Meng Qianshan kneeling in front of his bed and lying on the edge of the bed under the bright lights. His eyes were red with anxiety, and he was staring at him closely. His mouth quivered, but he didn't dare to make a sound.Also, he was holding a large, bony and veiny hand in his own hand.Jiang Suizhou was feverish, and his brain was sluggish. When he saw the hand, he froze and looked up at the arm of the hand.Then he met a pair of cold, dark eyes.Jiang Suizhou was so scared that he let go of the hand.Huo Wujiu calmly stopped patting him on the back and pulled a pillow behind him. He pressed him down and had him lean on it. He then turned his head and said in a low voice, \"You\u2019re awake.\"A young doctor hurriedly came forward, knelt down in front of the bed, and took Jiang Suizhou's pulse.Huo Wujiu rolled his wheelchair back and retreated.No one noticed that his right hand which Jiang Suizhou had just held was placed in his lap. He slowly curled his fingers and clenched his fist.As if retaining some kind of touch.When the people around them saw that Jiang Suizhou had woken up, they stopped what they were doing and gathered around the bed.The doctor diagnosed his pulse for a moment, got up and said, \"His Highness is weak and overworked. The dampness and cold invaded his body, and he is suffering from windchill. I have boiled the medicine outside. In a moment, let His Highness drink it and have him go to bed. I think his fever will get better early tomorrow morning. He just needs to rest in the house for a few days. He shouldn\u2019t go anywhere until his windchill is gone.\"Meng Qianshan replied repeatedly beside him and ordered a maid nearby to bring the medicine quickly.Jiang Suizhou leaned on the soft pillow and rubbed his temples painstakingly before he roughly digested the words of the doctor....Oh, so I\u2019m exhausted. It rained today, and the cold made me sick.It was already spring, and the rain was not cold. There was probably no one else except him who would catch a cold without getting caught in the rain this season.Jiang Suizhou sighed in resignation.However, that was also good news. He was sick, so he could rest peacefully in the house for a few days. He wondered if he could stay sick for a longer period, preferably until the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet. That way, he could peacefully claim to be sick and not attend. Huo Wujiu naturally wouldn\u2019t have to go as well\u2026Reminded of Huo Wujiu, Jiang Suizhou's muddled brain paused.Just now...was he h-holding Huo Wujiu\u2019s hand?But he did not have the slightest impression of how Huo Wujiu came to his bedside, and how he took his hand with him.Jiang Suizhou felt that he was really sick and confused.However, before he could delve deeper into it, an extremely domineering bitterness drifted in from afar.Jiang Suizhou frowned in the wake of it.Then he saw a bowl of medicine soup as dark as ink. It was filled in a white jade bowl and brought to him.The bitter taste wafted to the end of Jiang Suizhou's nose and immediately triggered a cough. The coughing caused a dry retching in his throat, which scared Meng Qianshan to pat his back and call out to his master repeatedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You'd better drink this medicine!\"Jiang Suizhou held his breath and said nothing.The medicine was right in front of him. He was afraid that if he took one more breath, he would choke and lose half his life.Meng Qianshan was so anxious that he was about to cry.\"Master! If you don't take the medicine, how can you recover from this illness?!\"Jiang Suizhou froze....That\u2019s right.If he didn\u2019t take this medicine, he wouldn\u2019t get better, right?If he was ill...would he be justified not to take Huo Wujiu to the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet?\u2014\u2014Since that day, Jiang Suizhou had rested in the mansion as a matter of course.Many courtiers from top to bottom of the court sent him gifts of sympathy, and even the emperor rewarded him with an imperial doctor, grandly in the name of diagnosing and healing him.Jiang Suizhou knew that the emperor was afraid that he was pretending to be sick, so he sent someone to take a look.But Jiang Suizhou was indeed seriously ill. The imperial doctor also went back and reported that His Highness King Jing's body was really unfit for anything. The next spring rain would probably drench off half his life. The emperor was so happy that he rewarded Jiang Suizhou with a pile of worthless gold, silver, and jewels the next day. He allowed Jiang Suizhou to take a good rest, and he didn\u2019t have to worry about anything in the court.Ji You from the Minister of Rites also heard that Jiang Suizhou was down with a cold and became ill because of the assignment he assigned to him. That day, Jiang Suizhou asked Meng Qianshan to bring a letter to Ji You. Ji You was so guilty that he asked Meng Qianshan to bring back several books of unofficial history as his apology.Jiang Suizhou was between tears and laughter. He asked Meng Qianshan to quickly put those faulty books away and store them somewhere he couldn\u2019t see.The next day, his fever went down, but he still hadn\u2019t recovered from his wind chill.Jiang Suizhou had never been so uncomfortable with a cold.The original owner must have had a particularly weak respiratory system. When he caught a cold, his throat and lungs felt extremely uncomfortable. Because of his poor health, his illness has always recurred these days. His body was as cold as ice one moment, and he would be suffering from a low fever the next.Jiang Suizhou was viciously tormented, but did not forget to secretly ask Meng Qianshan whether they should move Huo Wujiu out, so as not to infect him.This was just an excuse. Jiang Suizhou wanted to use this excuse to move Huo Wujiu out.After all, the emperor and Pang Shao were now thoroughly convinced that he was gay. They even thought that he was a gay with a penchant for some excitement. If that was the case, there was no need for him to keep Huo Wujiu in his room and let him sleep on the couch every day for nothing.But Meng Qianshan shook his head repeatedly.Hearing Jiang Suizhou\u2019s words, he smiled so broadly that he ended up with a toothy grin.\"No need, Madam Huo doesn\u2019t mind this.\" He relied on the fact that Huo Wujiu was not in the room at the moment and whispered his reply to Jiang Suizhou.Jiang Suizhou frowned.Meng Qianshan said, \"You might not know this, but the day you fell ill, it was Madam Huo who discovered it. From the time the servant came in, Madam Huo kept holding your hand and didn't let go until you woke up!\"Speaking of this, Meng Qianshan was already laughing ecstatically.Jiang Suizhou was a bit speechless.He had an impression that perhaps..., it wasn't Huo Wujiu who was holding his hand, but him holding onto Huo Wujiu and refusing to let go.However, even if he shared these thoughts, Meng Qianshan would not believe it. Even if Huo Wujiu was deprived of his martial arts skills, he could definitely remove himself from a sick man with a fever such as him, right?Then he heard Meng Qianshan smilingly continue, \u201cMaster, I think Madam Huo treats you somewhat...Ah! No difficulty is indeed insurmountable if you're sincere. Sincerity can make metal and rock crack!\u201dJiang Suizhou maintained his composure and drove him away.Sure enough, once you tell a lie, you will pay for it sooner or later.Looking at Meng Qianshan's triumphant backside, Jiang Suizhou gritted his teeth and shook his head. He could only put away the thought of moving Huo Wujiu out for the time being.Although his illness was recurring, he was getting better day by day.Initially, the emperor had sent an imperial doctor, but there was no more movement after that. Then, unexpectedly, another imperial doctor from the palace came within a few days.This time, Jiang Suizhou saw the obvious difference in this doctor.The one that the emperor sent before only diagnosed his pulse. When he saw that Jiang Suizhou was seriously ill, he bade farewell and left.But this doctor was different. After he came, he gave Jiang Suizhou a detailed diagnosis. He even clearly checked what medicine Jiang Suizhou had eaten in the past few days.Jiang Suizhou guessed that this imperial doctor was 80% sent by Pang Shao.The emperor merely wanted to see Jiang Suizhou fall ill. Since he really was ill, the emperor was happy and didn\u2019t care about him anymore. But Pang Shao was different. He was keeping an eye on Jiang Suizhou to see how he was, to see when he would get well, and to see if he could take advantage of it to pull other tricks.Jiang Suizhou was dead tired of this kind of surveillance.But he couldn\u2019t drive this imperial doctor away. He came once every few days.Until today.It was the third visit of the doctor. After diagnosing Jiang Suizhou, the doctor smiled meaningfully and said, \"Your Highness has recovered well. I think you\u2019ll be well in two or three days. Just as well, the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet is in four days\u2019 time. His Majesty has been concerned about you every day. Now that you can attend, His Majesty will not be disappointed.\"After saying that, he raised his head and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was so furious that his breathing was unsteady.He knew that this was Pang Shao threatening him. Pang Shao was telling him that he knew about his health condition, that he could not escape, and that he must bring Huo Wujiu to the palace to amuse and entertain the emperor.At this very moment, Meng Qianshan came in with the boiled medicine.Jiang Suizhou took a look at the medicine, and then turned his eyes away.For this period, he felt that he had soaked in bitter medicine, and there was a bitter taste all over his body.He might as well not drink this medicine and continue to stay in poor health instead. If worse came to worst, he\u2019d just stay sick for a few more days. It was better than having those people get their way and subject Huo Wujiu to humiliation again.With this in mind, Jiang Suizhou said to Meng Qianshan, \"Put it down. I will drink it later.\"Meng Qianshan watched him cautiously.He knew that his master was not in a good mood at the moment, so he assumed that he lost patience drinking medicine. However, Jiang Suizhou was quite proactive in drinking medicine these recent days, except the first time, so Meng Qianshan didn\u2019t express his refusal.Meng Qianshan was at ease with him. Hearing him say so, he put the medicine aside obediently and withdrew.Jiang Suizhou and Huo Wujiu were the only two people left in the room.Jiang Suizhou glanced at Huo Wujiu, and saw him sitting quietly alone at a distance, looking down at a book.He got off the bed and picked up the medicine on the low table next to him.Unbeknownst to him, when Huo Wujiu nearby heard the noise, he immediately raised his head and looked at him.He saw the oblivious Jiang Suizhou wearing thin bedclothes and carrying the medicine bowl with one hand. His pace was a little slow as he walked towards a purple sand clay pot with an ornamental tree in the corner.Jiang Suizhou thought that as long as he poured out his medicine for two days to ensure the recurrence of his old disease, he could only be carried there if they wanted him to attend the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet.With that in mind, he walked over to the purple sand clay pot and tipped the jade bowl over.But when he was about to pour the medicine down, a hand suddenly reached over and took hold of his wrist.Jiang Suizhou looked back and saw that Huo Wujiu appeared next to him at some point.He sat in his wheelchair and clamped a hand on Jiang Suizhou's wrist to prevent his hand from moving. Although Huo Wujiu was looking up at him, his sharp black eyes were cold and awe-inspiring.His gaze made Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart inexplicably guilty.\"What are you doing?\" He heard Huo Wujiu ask.Jiang Suizhou got a grip of himself and replied coldly, \"Mind your own business. Get out of the way.\"Huo Wujiu didn't let go.\"Drink it.\" The declarative sentence came out of his mouth, especially like an order.\"Are you talking to me?\" Jiang Suizhou took out his fierce bearing typically used toward Meng Qianshan. His countenance turned chilly, and he looked arrogantly down at Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu didn't make a sound, but the force of his hand increased. He yanked Jiang Suizhou's hand inch by inch, holding his wrist and forcing him to bring the medicine back to the front.Huo Wujiu was using his actions to order him to drink the medicine.The bitter taste blew against Jiang Suizhou\u2019s face.Jiang Suizhou frowned at the fragrance and looked down. Huo Wujiu looked cold and tough, as if he wasn\u2019t leaving him any room for discussion.For some reason, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart was flooded with grievances.He was well aware that the emperor loathed him. Since he came here, he had suffered quite a bit of humiliation and had been enduring it for long.He also knew that being sick was unbearable. During this period, he suffered terribly every day from his illness. In all his life, he had never been so sick for so long and so serious.For him, rather than being so ill, he might as well let the emperor have a taste of his quick tongue.What was he afraid of? Wasn\u2019t he afraid that the ancestor in front of him would be humiliated and put it on his account and then offset it with his life?Jiang Suizhou laughed coldly.\"General Huo, why do you think I\u2019m dumping the medicine?\" He asked.Huo Wujiu did not make a sound and only quietly held his wrist, confronting him with silence.Jiang Suizhou continued, \"You heard what that doctor said just now, right? Why does he always come to see me and remind me of that? It\u2019s because the emperor ordered me to bring you to attend his birthday banquet. He wants to see you.\u201dIt had been a long time since Jiang Suizhou said such long sentences in a row that he was out of breath. After he spoke, he choked and coughed a few times. He forbeared and then added, \u201cWhy does he want to see you? You don\u2019t need me to say it, do you? Although I don\u2019t want to care about it, I don\u2019t want to humiliate myself in front of the officials. Dumping this medicine and letting me stay sick for a few days is beneficial both for you and me. Do you understand?\"After speaking, Jiang Suizhou took a few labored breaths to even out his breath.He lowered his eyes to look at Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and looked at him indifferently. He listened to him finish his speech, but his expression remained extremely calm.It was only after Jiang Suizhou smoothed out his breathing did Huo Wujiu speak quietly.\"I know,\" he said, \"So, drink the medicine.\"Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyebrows knitted.He found that Huo Wujiu\u2019s deep black eyes were firm and quiet.He was obviously unable to stand up anymore. He was in an enemy country and a prisoner of war that everyone had trampled on, but those eyes were somehow reassuringly powerful to Jiang Suizhou.\"They won't kill me, so I have nothing to fear. If he asks me to go, then I'll just go,\" he said.After a pause, Huo Wujiu spoke somewhat stiffly and awkwardly. \"So, don't be afraid either.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if he was considered a War God that killed gods and Buddhas, he was now just a clay statue. Any hot-tempered person with rough hands and feet could smash him to bits.However, when these words came out of his mouth, they sounded extremely convincing. For a while, Jiang Suizhou felt that Huo Wujiu was really trying to keep him safely behind him.Jiang Suizhou was a bit overwhelmed for a while.Under his grip, Huo Wujiu felt Jiang Suizhou stop struggling. When Huo Wujiu looked up, he found that the man's expression was still cold, but his eyes were a bit empty.He couldn't help but sigh deep inside.This man; he was obviously harmless, but he just had to wear the mask of a vicious tyrant.He let go of Jiang Suizhou's wrist and took away the jade bowl he was holding in passing.Only when Jiang Suizhou\u2019s hand was emptied did he snap back to his senses.He found that Huo Wujiu had taken his bowl away, and was now holding the medicine in one hand. He raised a pair of cold, calm eyes and regarded him quietly.\"Go back to bed.\" He heard Huo Wujiu speak.His tone was still brusque and cold, quite like giving orders to his soldiers.That was when Jiang Suizhou realized that he was wearing only thin pajamas with his ankles exposed.It was not too cold in early spring, but it was much for his sickly body to endure. In just a while, he was completely frozen.Jiang Suizhou could only return to the bed and sit in embarrassment.Huo Wujiu rolled his wheelchair with one hand and moved to the bedside. He placed the medicine bowl on the low table beside him.Huo Wujiu put down the medicine, but did not leave. When Jiang Suizhou looked at him, he saw Huo Wujiu looking at him indifferently. Although he was silent, his stance told him that he was waiting to see him drink the medicine before withdrawing.Jiang Suizhou secretly gritted his teeth....Are you the King or am I?In any case, Huo Wujiu was only a concubine. His arrogance was evidently an offense to his superior.Jiang Suizhou muttered his grievances in his heart, and pursed his lips. He took the medicine bowl, tilted his head and drank it....It\u2019s bitter as hell.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou's illness had really been cured.After that day, he also thought it through. Anyway, Huo Wujiu had already known what the emperor wanted to do and also said he was not afraid. No matter how the emperor courted death, it was none of Jiang Suizhou\u2019s business.After all, what he really feared was that Huo Wujiu would settle accounts with him later. With this arrangement, he naturally could sleep in comfort.However, he and Huo Wujiu shared the same room day after day, and sometimes when Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes, he could see Huo Wujiu in the room.Recently, when he met eyes with Huo Wujiu, he couldn't help but contemplate. What would General Huo do on the day of the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet?The emperor\u2019s birthday was a big day for him, so no blood would be shed at the banquet, and Huo Wujiu was unlikely to be hurt physically.The emperor was a fool with no brains. Once Huo Wujiu was really in front of him, the emperor would come up with some humiliating slurs, but the harm would only be superficial.But Jiang Suizhou didn't forget that Pang Shao, who was beside the emperor, was treacherous, and had a belly full of evil tricks.Needless to say, Jiang Suizhou knew that he would definitely suggest to the emperor a dirty trick or two.Of course, all these tricks were aimed at Huo Wujiu. Since Jiang Suizhou had already chosen to wash his hands off of it, he didn\u2019t have to be afraid. But he was still a little worried. The closer the birthday banquet approached, the more unsettled he was.Jiang Suizhou could only attribute this mentality to the fact that he and Huo Wujiu were grasshoppers on a rope. They were bound together for good or ill.What other reason could there be?Three days passed quickly. When Jiang Suizhou's wind chill had recovered, it was close to the day of the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet.A day prior, Jiang Suizhou once again welcomed the imperial doctor that Pang Shao sent.When the doctor arrived, Jiang Suizhou was no longer bedridden. He was already dressed properly, draped in a thin cloak and sitting in the main hall reading a book. The doctor stepped forward and diagnosed his pulse, then took two steps back and knelt down.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his hand, picked up the cup of tea on the table and glanced at him lightly.Then I heard the imperial doctor kneeling on the ground say, \"Congratulations, Your Highness. Your health has improved greatly. I can report to His Majesty when I return to the palace that you can attend tomorrow's banquet without any delay...\"Jiang Suizhou raised an eyebrow.The next moment, the teacup in his hand shattered in front of the imperial doctor with a resounding clang.The servants in the room were frightened. Even Huo Wujiu, who was by the window, raised his eyes and looked at Jiang Suizhou.He saw Jiang Suizhou sitting crookedly on a spacious wooden armchair. His arms were resting on the armrest, and his overcoat spread out. He was quite relaxed and indolent.Jiang Suizhou was born extremely delicate with an ice-cold countenance. When he was looking down at someone, he looked arrogant and aloof, but also exuded an inexplicable poppy-like attraction. Once people laid eyes on him, they would be scared, but at the same time, wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the desire to get closer.In front of him, the teacup shattered into pieces on the ground, and hot tea splashed onto the doctor's robe, making him tremble with fright. Even the words he was about to say got stuck in his throat.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s voice slowly reverberated: \u201cThe emperor\u2019s birthday banquet...His Majesty\u2019s birthday banquet. Why are you reminding me one after another? Do you think I am reluctant to go?\"He knew that this doctor was the dog that Pang Shao kept. While monitoring his health in the name of consultation, Pang Shao instructed him to annoy him even further, one way or another.The first time, Jiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t rebel, but the next time...Pang Shao thought Jiang Suizhou was easy to bully, so he deliberately let others flaunt his power.Of course he couldn\u2019t leave it alone.T/N: Starting this chapter, the chapters onward will be re-numbered, so it'll be more difficult and less likely of a chance for it to be stolen.

Hearing this, he promptly replied, \"Naturally not! His Majesty ordered me...\"\"Did Royal Brother tell you that we are at odds, and that I am reluctant to go to his birthday banquet?\"This was naturally the truth. However, having a mutual understanding about this truth was enough, and it must never be laid outright on the table.Whoever expressed it first would be unfilial and unbrotherly. But if the underlings underneath said it...it would be equivalent to provoking the relationship between their masters.The doctor did not dare to admit it. He knelt in place and kowtowed, and then hurriedly denied, \"His Majesty naturally did not! It's just that I...\"Jiang Suizhou laughed icily.\u201cOf course, my royal brother will never say such things. It's obviously your self-assertion as a servant,\u201d he said, \u201cSince my royal brother has asked you to come treat me, you should perform your duty as a doctor properly. Don\u2019t speak out of turn and tarnish my royal brother\u2019s reputation. I also must punish you on behalf of my royal brother.\"The imperial doctor was flustered and quickly attempted to defend himself.Inside and outside the palace, was there anyone who thought highly of this unpopular King Jing? Even the powerful man, who sent him to treat his illness, instructed him to beat him.From the start, King Jing remained silent and submitted meekly to his insults, so he took him as a soft persimmon. It never occurred to him that he was gathering momentum, waiting for the right moment.Jiang Suizhou did not give him a chance to speak.\"Meng Qianshan.\" He opened his mouth and ordered.Meng Qianshan, who was waiting at the door, hurriedly came forward.Then the doctor heard Jiang Suizhou say, \u201cBeat him and personally send him back to the palace. Say that this man deliberately provoked the relationship between me and my royal brother. I\u2019ve already punished him, so the rest is up to my royal brother.\u201dMeng Qianshan had viewed the doctor as an eyesore several times before, so upon hearing Jiang Suizhou's command, he was so happy that his eyebrows danced with pleasure. He quickly called in the manservants outside the room to drag the doctor out.Jiang Suizhou gently added, \"Drag him far away before beating him. Don\u2019t dirty my ears.\"Meng Qianshan nodded repeatedly and commanded the servants to drag the doctor out.When the room quieted down, a maid stepped forward, carefully cleaned the floor, and poured a new cup of tea for Jiang Suizhou. Jiang Suizhou picked up the teacup.He was well aware that Pang Shao sent the doctor. After Jiang Suizhou sent the doctor back, the doctor would not lose his life, though he would certainly be deprived of his official position and expelled from the palace just to spare someone's feelings.As a university teacher, he had never even executed corporal punishment to his students, much less let someone take a beating because that person committed a mistake and provoked him. He would have gotten sacked from his official post without Jiang Suizhou\u2019s interference, anyway.Yet, he must do it.Those people pressed hard on his heels and picked on him. If he didn't retaliate at all, they would become more aggressive and unscrupulous. He was caught in the dilemmas of the original owner, so if he couldn\u2019t bear to hurt his opponents, it would definitely be him who would die.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes and looked out the door.Under the gloomy sky, the exquisite and gorgeous eaves spread out layer upon layer, seemingly trapping him in a chess game.Jiang Suizhou slowly sighed and once again picked up the book he placed on the table.He had long been used to Huo Wujiu's living in his room, so he didn't notice that Huo Wujiu had captured all his emotions in his eyes.Sickly man; it was just giving a man an overdue beating, yet he was the first who couldn\u2019t bear it.Fortunately, he was born in a beautiful and peaceful place. He didn't see blood and didn't go to the battlefield. Otherwise, if he really witnessed a murder, how scared would he be?Huo Wujiu looked down and collected all these emotions in his eyes....He deserves to be pampered in a lifetime of prosperity.\u2014\u2014February 24th was the birthday of the emperor.Early that morning, it was drizzling outside the window.Raindrops continuously pattered until dusk, and the rain outside the window didn\u2019t stop even when the time to enter the palace arrived.The lamps were lit up early in the room. Jiang Suizhou was waited upon as he put on a winding and complicated imperial robe. When he turned around, he saw Meng Qianshan pushing the properly dressed Huo Wujiu out from the back room.Because of Huo Wujiu's special status, Jiang Suizhou had instructed Meng Qianshan not to dress him too ostentatiously. However, despite his lavender blue robe and a simple hair crown, the man\u2019s awe-inspiring aura was still outlined. There was no hiding the noble aura that shone from his head to toe.The candlelights were shining brightly all around, but the man seemed to have a natural glow.Jiang Suizhou stood riveted for a moment, and it took him a lot of effort to barely withdraw his gaze. He cleared his throat to cover up his gaffe.\"When we enter the palace later, be smart,\" he glanced at Meng Qianshan and instructed.Meng Xiangshan naturally knew what he meant. Jiang Suizhou was asking him to take care of Huo Wujiu.Meng Qianshan nodded.The two went all the way out of the royal residence and got into the carriage waiting at the entrance of the residence.The carriage was not too spacious, and Huo Wujiu's wheelchair was a bit bulky, so once it was placed on the carriage, the two were extremely close to each other.As soon as the curtain of the carriage was lowered, silence suddenly settled over the four corners, and only the sound of their breathing remained.This kind of breathing in a narrow space where one breath fell and another rose gave off the illusion of intertwined breathing. It was particularly audible in the silence when nobody talked.In such an atmosphere, Jiang Suizhou suddenly and inexplicably felt cornered.He was sitting beside Huo Wujiu, and with just the two of them so close to each other, he suddenly did not know where to put his hands. He wanted to speak to break the silence, but had nothing to say. He only heard Huo Wujiu\u2019s steady breathing, one after the other, bringing his heartbeat to a slower pace.Jiang Suizhou urged himself to think of something, such as what the emperor might say once they arrived at the banquet, and how he should respond\u2026But at that moment, the carriage suddenly lurched forward.Jiang Suizhou was distracted, and in his inattentiveness, the carriage jostled him askew, and he fell aside.He happened to pitch headfirst onto Huo Wujiu's shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 29The bones and muscles on his shoulder were firm and hard, and with the sudden lurch, they collided with Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes.After a brief period of dizziness, a hand gripped Jiang Suizhou's arm.The hand was quite strong, so the moment it gripped Jiang Suizhou, he felt pain in his bones. Immediately after, he was lifted steadily and placed into a stable seat.\"Sit still.\" He heard Huo Wujiu's voice close to him.Jiang Suizhou rubbed his temples with some embarrassment and cleared his throat.\"Sorry.\" He tried to keep his voice as calm and indifferent as possible.Huo Wujiu answered with a faint muffled grunt.When the carriage started, the wheels rattled. The sound echoed in the four corners, and the wind gently blew on the curtains, making the atmosphere seem less awkward.After a moment of silence, Jiang Suizhou secretly glanced at Huo Wujiu.He was sitting beside him with his head turned slightly sideways, looking calmly out the window. The curtains were slowly lifted, and the rain drizzled in. A few strands of light from outside shone on Huo Wujiu's face, dropping warm patches of light on his cheeks.Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t know if it was his imagination, but he felt that Huo Wujiu's lips were a little white, which was absolutely abnormal.But the light in the carriage was too dim, so for a while, Jiang Suizhou couldn't tell if he had seen it wrong.He couldn't help but glance again.Coincidentally, Huo Wujiu turned his gaze back and looked at him.Caught in the act, Jiang Suizhou faltered and asked a bit stiffly, \u201cAre you cold?\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t be. It was now past early spring. The rain outside was a bit cool, but it was certainly nothing to Huo Wujiu. After all, not everyone was like him, a paper-mache body.Huo Wujiu slowly opened his mouth and replied, \u201cNo.\u201dHuo Wujiu\u2019s eyes swept across his legs without a trace.From this morning when it rained, his legs began to tingle. The pain, which he was accustomed, suddenly became more severe after they had left the house.Like an iron saw or a blunt axe, the pain cut into his meridians, little by little, tugging at his legs like an endless torture. It was so painful that his scalp was numb. His hand that was resting on his lap clenched tightly into a fist.Naturally, he would not tell Jiang Suizhou about it, because he neither felt it necessary nor wanted to scare him....However, King Jing seems quite bent on chatting with me.From the time Jiang Suizhou got into the carriage, he was distracted, and was \u00a0even stealing glances at him just now.Huo Wujiu casually glanced at Jiang Suizhou.\"Are you cold?\" he fired back.Jiang Suizhou shook his head: \u201cI saw you...you\u2019ve been looking outside, so I thought it was because the wind was too cold.\"Huo Wujiu softly chuckled.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you suppose I was planning an escape?\u201d he asked. The corners of his mouth were somewhat arched. The curtain stirred slowly, so that the light in his eyes was extinguished. For a moment, they seemed to contain dashes of humor.Jiang Suizhou was stunned, then inexplicably a little flustered. He hurriedly turned his eyes to the window.\"You can try to run and see if the emperor has sent someone to spy on you in the shadows,\" he retorted coldly....I just said a few words. Why did you panic?Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze, and the smile on his lips deepened more.\u2014\u2014The carriage stopped outside the Kaiyang Gate.Jiang Suizhou was assisted off the carriage. He found that many carriages had been parked around him, and the officials and female relatives kept shuttling to and fro. It was especially lively.As soon as he disembarked from the carriage, he felt a lot of eyes falling on him; other people also had their eyes behind him - Jiang Suizhou knew that these people were waiting to see Huo Wujiu.With an indifferent and arrogant expression, he stood by the carriage while servants hurried forward to move the wheelchair in place for Huo Wujiu.Seeing the crowd slow down, Jiang Suizhou frowned impatiently.Want to see the fun, do you? Okay, let me show you.He swiftly turned around and sternly said to the servants, \"Be quicker. How long do you want me to wait?\"The few servants hurriedly bowed to their waists to apologize and hurriedly brought Huo Wujiu out from the carriage.Jiang Suizhou withdrew his gaze, and his piercing eyes scanned the ministers around him.His exceedingly irritable appearance gave off the impression that innocent bystanders might get caught in the crossfire at any time. Everybody withdrew their eyes in succession. It was as if they saw nothing, and they walked away respectively.Jiang Suizhou readjusted his gaze with satisfaction, put his hand behind him, and walked directly through Kaiyang Gate.Meng Qianshan hurriedly pushed Huo Wujiu and quickly followed after Jiang Suizhou.Because His Highness King Jing was in a foul mood and seemed he would fly into a rage at any moment, the ordinary courtiers dared not strike up a conversation, despite wanting to approach him and exchange pleasantries. Hence, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s trek went a lot smoother.However, all sorts of scrutiny, explicit or implicit, fell on him and especially on the man behind him.Huo Wujiu.In the past, this name was like a fatalistic evil spirit to them.This was the man who had led the troops all the way from Yangguan to Yecheng, driving them out of their centuries-old ancestral foundation and all the way to the south of the Great River. Late last year, he was the same person who suddenly rose up with tens of thousands of soldiers and horses gathered by the river, looking to cross the river and kill them all.Fortunately, the Great River was easy to defend and difficult to attack. Also, the advanced troops of the Northern Liang somehow crossed the river, the troops afterwards did not follow. That was how the generals guarding the river picked up the slack and surrounded Huo Wujiu with more than a thousand soldiers and horses.Even so, that battle lasted for seven to eight days, all the way until their enemies ran out of food and ammunition. Only then was Huo Wujiu barely captured.What did this mean to the Great Jing?It was simply like placing one foot into the jaws of death, but was killed by the Impermanence 1 instead.Now, this Impermanence\u2019s legs were crippled, and he was being pushed around, following His Highness King Jing. He came to His Majesty's birthday banquet as a part of His Highness\u2019s family.More or less, the crowd wanted to see what the legendary General Huo looked like, with a green face and jagged teeth like a saw.However, he didn\u2019t resemble the black faced, round eyed, and bearded man they had in their minds.Footnote:1 Impermanence - described as the messenger of the soul in deathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 30On the contrary, he was extremely handsome and outstanding.He sat quietly in a wheelchair with a slender and tall figure that appeared a bit aggrieved no matter which way they looked. However, he sat extremely upright. He was dressed simply. There wasn\u2019t much blood in his face, but his facial structures were as sharp as a sheathed blade, and it made people not dare to freely approach.Just then, the atmosphere around underwent a slight change.Jiang Suizhou saw a man in his peripheral vision.He was tall and sturdy. He was obviously wearing a wide-sleeved imperial robe, but appeared instead like a mountain bandit. His grim face was very conspicuous. His copper bell-like large eyes were now filled with grief and anger and were even a little red. He was giving him the evil eye....Oh, Ji Hongcheng.Jiang Suizhou secretly took a deep breath.Ji Hongcheng was a reckless and straightforward man. Seeing Huo Wujiu at this moment, he would probably say or do something.Jiang Suizhou prepared himself and waited for Ji Hongcheng to launch an attack.Ji Hongcheng really did stride towards him. His robes fluttered, personifying a black bear that drilled through the cloth store, wrapped in silk and satin, baring its teeth and claws as it pounced to eat people.However, Ji Hongcheng abruptly stopped three steps away from him.Jiang Suizhou halted and frowned at him. He saw Ji Hongcheng standing there motionless....What is he doing?Jiang Suizhou was somewhat confused. Then, Ji Hongcheng fiercely glared at him with his large bell-like eyes, turned around and left. The delicate and pretty lady beside him turned around rather apologetically and saluted Jiang Suizhou....He just left?Jiang Suizhou gave him a puzzled look and just assumed that the guy didn\u2019t dare to go crazy at the birthday feast of the emperor.Little did he know that when Ji Hongcheng was about to charge towards him, a tiny paper-wrapped ball flew out of the air as sharp as an arrow and steadily hit Ji Hongcheng's chest, then fell into his arms.No one saw this small fly-sized object, and no one saw who did it.Only Ji Hongcheng, who hastily hid in the latrine and carefully unfolded the paper ball to look at it, knew.Strong and soft calligraphy graced the paper. At first glance, it was General Huo's handwriting.[Don't send letters again. Bide your time for a better chance.When Lou Yue returns to the capital, send Zhi Liu to me.]Ji Hongcheng immediately understood what he meant.It turned out that, without him having to say it, General Huo had already planned ahead. He had not done anything, but was just waiting for the right time.The timing... depended on General Lou.But General Lou was bent on loyalty and service to the kingdom while General Hou was a rebel...Would General Lou really help him?Ji Hongcheng\u2019s heart was beating drums. He stuffed the note into his mouth and swallowed it.\u2014\u2014Huo Wujiu had figured that he would meet Ji Hongcheng at the banquet today.Although this person said he wanted to help him, he didn't help much. On the contrary, the frequent letters he sent were all useless news which would more likely attract attention and cause trouble for King Jing\u2019s mansion.To Huo Wujiu, Ji Hongcheng\u2019s only role was to contact Lou Yue for him.Huo Wujiu sat quietly in his wheelchair, his gaze extremely profound.He persisted on staying alive, not to let the emperor humiliate him for a few more years, but to wait for the right opportunity to leave here. In the whole of Southern Jing, he couldn\u2019t find someone he knew, and the only person he could use was Lou Yue.Although Lou Yue stood opposite his father's camp and was now hostile to him, he owed Huo Wujiu a life in his early years, which could be considered a personal favor.He didn't want to coerce grace for reward, and he would never let Lou Yue do anything against his principles. But now that he was trapped in the enemy camp, he could only use this favor to find a way out.With this in mind, he raised his eyes and looked at Jiang Suizhou.Jiang Suizhou was walking one step in front of him, with a tall and slender posture and fluttering robes. He must have been sporting a fiendish look at the moment, which made those around him cautiously look in their direction, but not dare to step forward.If there really was such a day...Jiang Suizhou most probably wouldn\u2019t sit idle.Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze.If the heavens really spared him; if he still would have a semblance of power lef, he\u2019d see if he could save this rabbit. King Jing was still good-hearted and harbored some inexplicable infatuation for him.Jiang Suizhou, the man in front of him, did not know what Huo Wujiu who was behind him was thinking.He was led by the palace staff all the way to Qiuwu Palace Hall, where he saw a eunuch waiting for him. When the eunuch saw him, he immediately welcomed him with a smile and gave him a big salute.\"Greetings, Your Highness. I will show you to your seat.\"After speaking, he turned sideways and moved to invite Jiang Suizhou inside.Just then, his gaze fell behind Jiang Suizhou.At once, the flattering smile on the eunuch's face flickered for several seconds before he stepped forward and said, \"Please, Your Highness. There are rules in our palace - family members need to sit separately in the women's seats.\"With that, he raised his voice and said behind him, \"Someone, come here quickly. Lead His Highness's wife to the west banquet hall...\"However, Jiang Suizhou coldy raised his hand, interrupting his order.Send Huo Wujiu to sit there with female relatives? Seriously?Needless to say, Jiang Suizhou knew that this was the method the emperor thought of to humiliate Huo Wujiu. Moreover, this would also leave Huo Wujiu alone. By then, any dirty trick played would be like shooting fish in a barrel.Therefore, he definitely could not agree.As for how he could argue\u2026Jiang Suizhou paused and gave Huo Wujiu a gloomy glance, then his gaze returned to the eunuch.His eyes were as cold as a viper. With a shadow of a smile, he suddenly displayed a somewhat unspeakable, eerie, perversion.He spoke unhurriedly.\u201cI need to personally keep an eye on my wife. He is very wild, and only I can control him...Please make an exception for me, eunuch.\"He spoke softly, but inexplicably made the eunuch's back shudder. The eunuch cautiously scrutinized King Jing and saw him standing backlit, with a cool smirk at the corners of his mouth.His bearing and delivery clearly wasn\u2019t asking him to bend the rules, but was more like telling him that he had to bring his extra portable plaything to fiddle with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone said that he took after his enchanting concubine mother, born to suck the Yang energy of men.The eunuch was shocked, and his eyes involuntarily drifted toward Huo Wujiu.Although the man in the wheelchair looked tall, his lips were quite pale.He was looking down without any expression on his face. He was evidently bold and sharp in appearance, but under Jiang Suizhou\u2019s shadow, he appeared somewhat pitiful.Look, there was even a wound on his eyebrow. Was it inflicted by King Jing himself?After a quick glance, the eunuch immediately averted his eyes, and failed to notice what kind of mood the poor man sitting behind King Jing was hiding under his drooping eyelashes.The eunuch bowed and was caught in a dilemma: \u201cUhm\u2026\u201dHe hesitated for a moment and said with a forced smile, \"Your Highness, this is truly against the rules.\"Jiang Suizhou turned cold and was about to speak\u2026Just then, out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of a crowd of people climbing up the steps, drawing nearer.Many officials clustered around and were lively. They followed a courtier in a vermilion court dress all the way up the stairs as if he was the sun.A red court dress, the highest rank.There was no other person who could have worn this robe except Pang Shao.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart tightened.He knew that the little eunuch in front of him was easy to fool, but Pang Shao was a thousand-year-old fox. Jiang Suizhou was fighting for Huo Wujiu to stay by his side, but one careless move would let Pang Shao see the clues.He went rigid, his heart hammering.The next moment, amidst the noise of approaching people, he turned sideways and grabbed Huo Wujiu's chin, roughly lifting his face up like an object on display.With cold eyebrows and a shadow of a meaningful smile on his lips, he looked at the eunuch and said, \"Against the rules? Then let me see whether he is male or female.\"Jiang Suizhou heard the weakening of the approaching voices behind him. That group of people must have noticed the dispute on their side.Jiang Suizhou was so nervous that his hands trembled a little.However, he hoped that nothing was revealed and also hoped that Huo Wujiu knew this was only a desperate measure\u2026The eunuch froze.He stared at Jiang Suizhou's movements in a daze, and then found that His Highness King Jing, whose lush feminine beauty carried an evil air, tightly pinched General Huo\u2019s chin and forced him to raise his face to directly face him.The man's eyes were still downcast, and as he raised his head, a hideous scar was revealed at his collar.It lay across his clavicle, and although it had scabbed, the edges were still red. It looked a bit appalling in the vibrant light.The eunuch\u2019s legs went limp in fright.\u201cH-He\u2019s a man of course\u2026\u201d he stammered.His Highness King Jing gave a cold laugh and flung Huo Wujiu's face away.\"Isn't that right?\"He slowly and methodically took a handkerchief out of his bosom and slowly wiped up the hand that had touched Huo Wujiu.\"You\u2019re sending him off with a bunch of women; are you not afraid of accidents? I\u2019m even more uneasy.\"He slowly wiped his already clean fingers one by one, and the moment his hand loosened, his handkerchief fluttered to the ground.\u201cI\u2019m afraid of getting dirty, you should know that,\" he looked up and said.\u201cThis...This\u2026\u201d \u00a0the eunuch clammed up for a while.Just then, Jiang Suizhou heard a burst of laughter behind him.\u201cI was wondering who the official here was. It turned out to be Your Highness King Jing!\u201d The man laughed aloud.Jiang Suizhou turned around.Pang Shao was standing there, just a few steps behind him.Although this old bastard frequently persecuted him recently, it wasn\u2019t until today that he came face to face with Pang Shao for the first time.Unlike his repulsive appearance in portraits, this old bastard was born with an upright appearance. When dressed in a court robe, he exuded quite a majesty that reached the high heavens.Only his eyes were exceedingly deep with a touch of an elusive gleam.Jiang Suizhou tensed up.He coldly swept Pang Shao a glance, put on a look of disinterest, and faintly said, \"Pang-daren 1 .\"His gesture could be regarded as very rude. Although Jiang Suizhou was a prince, Pang Shao was also his biological granduncle with the highest official rank as the Grand Minister over the Masses. In terms of status, the two of them were not much different, not to mention Pang Shao\u2019s power.But Jiang Suizhou knew that this attitude was what the original owner should have had.As expected, Pang Shao remained amiable and wasn\u2019t the least bit indignant. Instead, he bowed, leading the courtiers around him to salute Jiang Suizhou. Then he smiled and asked, \"Your Highness, why are you standing here?\"Jiang Suizhou's expression cooled further, and after a faint glance at Huo Wujiu, he quickly averted his gaze in disgust and no longer looked at him again.\"It's nothing.\" He turned sideways, seemingly unwilling to talk more. \"Pang-daren, you first, please.\"Pang Shao, however, did not move, but instead addressed the eunuch, \"On His Majesty's joyous day, how did you displease His Highness King Jing?\"The eunuch hurriedly stepped forward, knelt down and said, \"Pang-daren, the King...the King wants to bring his wife to the table.\"There naturally was no need for him to explain because Pang Shao had noted Jiang Suizhou's every word and action just now.Pang Shao looked at Jiang Suizhou with a smile.\"Let His Highness take him with him. The king and his wife are very much in love. Do you want to separate the lovebirds?\"He spoke slowly.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s face immediately turned ugly, as if he had swallowed something dirty. He could barely hide his disgust.Still, his face wasn\u2019t stretched taut and he only softly scoffed.The eunuch repeatedly said yes and bowed to invite Jiang Suizhou to his seat.Pang Shao\u2019s words seemed to have disgusted Jiang Suizhou. He no longer spared him a glance again, turned around as if no one was in his sight and left.Pang Shao stood in place and watched him leave.Seeing Jiang Suizhou drifting away, an official nearby said discontentedly, \"His Highness is really rude.\"Pang Shao smiled and shook his head. He didn't think much of it, and his eyes even flashed with a gratified smile.\"Your Highness is just young,\" he replied nonchalantly.\u2014\u20141 Daren - honorific for high-ranking officials or nobilitiesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Huo Wujiu was also in a wheelchair, so there was no need to add a chair, just bowls and chopsticks.Jiang Suizhou sat abandonedly before his table. The eunuch saw that when His Highness King Jing took his seat, he turned his head and gave the general a cold and disgusted glare.The eunuch hastily retreated.He didn\u2019t see that when His Highness King Jing looked at Madam Huo, he quickly apologized. \"Forgive me.\"Jiang Suizhou was in a cold sweat just now, not only because of his fear that something would go wrong during his first contact with Pang Shao, but more importantly, the series of actions he subjected Huo Wujiu to.It was like pulling the tiger\u2019s whiskers!Jiang Suizhou was petrified, so as soon as he found an opportunity, he immediately apologized to Huo Wujiu.He didn't expect Huo Wujiu to respond to him at all. He also thought about how to logically explain it to him again later on their way back.But Huo Wujiu looked at him and winked slowly.He seemed to be conveying: I know.Jiang Suizhou was startled, and he could hardly retain his ice-cold visage.He quickly averted his eyes, picked up the teacup on the table and took a sip to calm his nerves.His wink just now...Was it a response to him? It shouldn\u2019t mean, \u201cYou\u2019re dead tonight,\u201d right?Jiang Suizhou's fingers trembled a little.Behind him, Huo Wujiu shot him a pensive glance, concealing a bit of deep meaning that was extremely difficult to detect in the depths of his eyes.Jiang Suizhou was so calm and composed in front of so many people just now, so why did he look at him and start acting scared again?Nonetheless, this was the first time he saw Jiang Suizhou in front of people.He was a superb actor, seeing how he even fooled Pang Shao. Jiang Suizhou\u2019s performance indeed incited hatred. No wonder Ji Hongcheng flew into a rage because of him and wrote obscenities in his letter.But\u2026Huo Wujiu surprisingly found it a bit cute.When Jiang Suizhou looked at him with that seemingly hostile stance that actually hid pinches of nervousness, he felt like a paw was scratching his heart somewhere, causing a tickling itch.Huo Wujiao involuntarily raised his hand and gently stroked his chin with his knuckles.Jiang Suizhou\u2019s cold and soft touch seemed to linger there.His hands had trembled gently, as if he tried his utmost best to control it, but all to no avail.Consequently, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s supposed insulting ferocity unexpectedly acquired a piteous touch, making his viciousness like a paper tiger that would break with a poke. On the surface, he railed candidly, but in fact, he swayed tremblingly, as if looking for support.Restraining himself from grabbing Jiang Suizhou\u2019s hand into his own demanded more determination than enduring the pain of cruel torture.\u2014\u2014Outside the door, the rain pattered incessantly, but brilliant lights filled the inside of the hall.Amidst the gold and jade splendor, all high-ranking officials and lords were celebrating with songs and dance. If Jiang Suizhou were someone else, he really would have been dazzled and thought that the imperial court was at the peak of its power and had centuries left to live.But Jiang Suizhou knew that this prosperous gaiety in front of him was the result of emptying the national treasury and also plundering countless surrounding states and counties. It was barely scraped together.Beneath the glitz was a rickety, empty frame.It was getting late. The court eunuchs sang and drank, then silence suddenly settled down everywhere.His Majesty had arrived.Jiang Suizhou rose to his feet with the courtiers and quietly waited for the emperor to sit down on the throne. Afterward, with the eunuch's cry, he, along with the ministers, knelt thrice and kowtowed nine times towards the emperor, performing the most solemn of salutes.When the last salute was over, the ministers kneeled in place, waiting for the emperor to let them rise.The grand eunuch inclined towards the emperor nearby with a horsetail whisk in his hand waited for a moment, but he didn\u2019t hear a sound from the man on the throne....What was he up to now?The grand eunuch felt a bit apprehensive, so he cautiously looked up. On the magnificent throne, the resplendently-dressed emperor sat askew, touching his chin with one hand and looking thoughtfully at the bottom of the step.What is\u2026?The grand eunuch followed his gaze and saw that among the kneeling courtiers, there was only one person who stood out from the crowd, sitting there quietly and silently opposite the emperor.His gaze was calm and indifferent, and he stared directly at His Majesty without any fear.Huo Wujiu.The grand eunuch knew this man. When Huo Wujiu was escorted back to Lin'an, he went to the dungeon with His Majesty once. That was the first time that man met His Majesty. Several officers and soldiers tried to force Huo Wujiu down on his knees, but were unsuccessful.It was also on that occasion that His Majesty ordered his hamstrings to be picked off.T-This man indeed can\u2019t kneel now...but the look on His Majesty seems like he still wants to launch an attack, doesn\u2019t it?The grand eunuch's heart throbbed uneasily.Just then, he heard His Majesty speak lazily.\u201cMy dear subjects, you may rise,\u201d he said.Having received his decree, the ministers at the bottom of the stairs stood up and returned to their seats.The grand eunuch sighed with relief.His Majesty was truly foolish. In the past, the previous emperor suppressed him, so he was still restrained. However, now that he was the emperor, the Grand Minister over the Masses blindly obeyed him, making him sometimes ridiculous regardless of the occasion. Hence, servants like them were also in constant fear.It would be best if His Majesty didn\u2019t fly into a rage and instead, spent his birthday smoothly\u2026However, he was just halfway relieved when he heard His Majesty speak again.\u201cHiss...Fifth Brother.\u201d The emperor rested his cheek on one hand. Without announcing the start of the feast, he picked up a shrimp ball from the table in front of him and stuffed it into his mouth.\"All the ministers have kneeled just now...except your wife. Why didn\u2019t he kneel before me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let me break your legs, and you try kneeling.He raised his head to look at the emperor. Then his eyes swept through the room. He saw that most of the courtiers around him were looking at him with a touch of schadenfreude, looking calm and composed amid the mess.Watching the emperor persecute him and Huo Wujiu must have been a long-awaited show for them.Jiang Suizhou paused and stood up. He turned around with grace and bowed toward the emperor.\u201cMy wife has been rude. Please forgive me, Royal Brother,\u201d he said.Hearing his apology, the emperor slowly chewed the shrimp ball in his mouth and languidly smiled. \"All right, I\u2019ll forgive you. But how do you intend to make me forgive you?\"Jiang Suizhou glanced at Huo Wujiu who was beside him.\"Although this thing is crippled, our intentions must be given priority and can\u2019t be lacking.\" Jiang Suizhou\u2019s gaze was cold and contemptuous, as if he had been tainted by a turbid object. A sprinkle of impatience and abhorrence even tinged his tone.After speaking, he raised his eyes to look at Meng Qianshan at the back, and said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bringing him over? Today, even if we drag him, we must let him kowtow to my royal brother.\" The last few words were almost squeezed out from between his teeth.It was evident that His Highness, King Jing, indeed harbored an undying hatred and disgust for Huo Wujiu, who had been stuffed into his mansion.If that was so, did he still lock him up in the room for torture?The emperor became more and more excited, while Meng Qianshan, who was standing behind the seat, was stunned.He knew that His Highness wanted to pretend to hate Madam Huo...but was he going to do it for real?H-How could he do this!Just then, Meng Qianshan saw Jiang Suizhou frowning gently and looking at him with an icy gaze.\"Be careful when you move,\" he said. \u201cDon't let the dirty blood on his legs get on the carpet and bring bad luck to the emperor.\"During palace banquets, especially one for the emperor's birthday, one should \u00a0never shed blood. This had always been the precept of the Jing Dynasty.Sure enough, the emperor opened his mouth to ask when he heard these words, \"What dirty blood?\"Jiang Suizhou glanced at Meng Qianshan, slowly blinked, and then spoke nonchalantly, \"It\u2019s nothing, just be careful.\"After saying that, Jiang Suizhou addressed Meng Qianshan again.\"If you dare stain the ground, even just a spot, I\u2019ll ask for your head.\"Meng Qianshan shuddered in fright, and in the next moment, he met Jiang Suizhou's eyes.He was immediately enlightened.That\u2019s right...Before leaving the residence today, His Highness had cautioned him!Meng Qianshan promptly turned around and kneeled down with a poof toward the emperor.\"Your Majesty, please help! Madam\u2019s leg...Yesterday, His Highness was...His Highness was just careless! The wound on Madam's leg now bleeds when touched, and it has not yet scabbed to this day...This servant does not dare to cause bad luck for Your Majesty!\"Meng Qianshan finished stammering while trembling. When everyone heard this, they immediately thought that Jiang Suizho must have tortured Huo Wujiu yesterday. He took him out for fun, to let other people toy with the cripple some more.The emperor felt somewhat chilled deep inside.Sure enough, his uncle was right. The most interesting thing was not to beat the dog, but to put two dogs into a kennel and watch them tear at each other.But\u2026It was pleasurable, but really forcing Huo Wujiu to kowtow in blood at his banquet was also something he couldn\u2019t do \u2014\u2014 He wasn\u2019t afraid of his ancestors\u2019 decrees, but of bad luck. He feared that the Heavens would see it and jeopardize his predestined lifespan.However, he must regain his dignity and not lose it.In the next moment, the smile on the emperor's face deepened, and his gaze flickered between Jiang Suizhou and Huo Wujiu.Finally, he looked at Jiang Suizhou and said, \"Then forget it. He\u2019s bloody, and I'm not such an unreasonable person either,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou breathed a sigh of relief, but he still didn\u2019t forget to display a look of reluctance on his face. He even coldly glared at Huo Wujiu.However, before he could be completely relieved, the emperor spoke again.\"However, since he is your concubine, you two, more or less, are one and the same, right?\" The emperor said with a smile.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes to look at him.The emperor smiled smugly and said, \u201cYou kneel for him.\"All the courtiers sat at the edge of their seats, all eyes centered on him....There was no doubt that the emperor was taking the opportunity to trample on Jiang Suizhou\u2019s dignity again.Jiang Suizhou took a deep breath and grit his teeth.He knew that this accursed fatuous ruler would never give up after receiving Pang Shao's guidance.Forget it. Had he suffered any less from the emperor for Huo Wujiu's sake? It was now just one more kowtow. It was just a disgrace and was no big deal.Jiang Suizhou quickly completed a good psychological construction, not forgetting to show humiliation on his face. He looked at the emperor, waiting for him to force him again. He would then kowtow like a duck driven to a perch and end the matter.But at that juncture, a low voice reverberated in the silent hall.\"Who is he to take my place?\" This was said with a pinch of contempt.Jiang Suizhou froze.What was Huo Wujiu doing!He looked behind him in surprise, and the ministers in the hall also looked at Huo Wujiu, one after the other.Jiang Suizhou saw Huo Wujiu on his wheelchair with his head raised, looking at the emperor in the distance.Just then, Huo Wujiu curled one corner of his lips and lazily showed a provocative smile to the emperor.For a moment, he was like the sun shining into the deep valley. His flamboyant and sharp appearance suddenly glittered, and it called to mind a war flag raised again by the wind, akin to the beacon fire roaring up in the city.This seemed to be his original appearance, dressed in fine clothes and leading a luxurious life, arrogant and failing to show restraint.Jiang Suizhou listened to Huo Wujiu, who continued, \u201cI, Huo Wujiu, as a minister, only kneel for my own monarch,\" he questioned slowly. \"What qualifications does he have to replace me?\"The raised end note of his voice sounded smooth and condescending.The emperor was so livid that his eyes were almost popping out.\"Your monarch?\" He gritted his teeth. \"You, Huo, are originally the vassals of my Great Jing, the watch dogs I raised. What kind of monarch do you have?\"Jiang Suizhou saw Huo Wujiu laugh and shake his head, as if he had heard some kind of joke.It was the first time Jiang Suizhou saw Huo Wujiu laugh.He was a bit wild, but extremely dazzling, like a blade buried in the mud and sand, reflecting the brilliance of the blazing sun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yecheng was defeated by his self-proclaimed loyal Huo family!This was clearly a grandiose slap on his face! He wished he could have someone tie Huo Wujiu down immediately, tear him to pieces, and feed the chunks of him to dogs.But he couldn\u2019t. His uncle had said that keeping this man would still be of great use. Besides, only by keeping him alive could he have him tortured and make his life worse than death\u2026The emperor\u2019s eyes were on the verge of splitting. He took a few deep breaths and looked at Pang Shao like a plea for help.Meanwhile, Jiang Suizhou, who was standing at the bottom of the steps, was already so ecstatic that he could barely hide the smile at the corners of his mouth.Although he knew that the emperor had left Huo Wujiu alive and wouldn\u2019t let him die so easily, he did not expect that Huo Wujiu would actually rely on this fact to openly challenge the emperor at the banquet.Was he inherently good at angering people? No wonder he was usually reticent. It turned out that he was keeping his weakness unexposed!Jiang Suizhou felt nothing but utter gratification. However, he was distinctly aware that he must say something at this time. Otherwise, if he remained silent, the emperor would take action.Even if the emperor didn\u2019t kill Huo Wujiu, it wouldn\u2019t end well for him today, either. Jiang Suizhou grabbed a jade cup on the table and smashed it straight onto the table in front of Huo Wujiu.A small jade cup didn\u2019t have much killing power, but when it suddenly hit the corner of the table, the resounding clang was enough to jolt everyone around them.Jiang Suizhou turned to Huo Wujiu, gnashing his teeth. He looked gloomy, like he was concealing his fury.\u201cVery good.\u201d He snarled one word at a time, and because of his extremely frail physique, even his breath began to quiver from restraining his anger. \"It seems that I haven\u2019t taught you how to shut up.\"The last few words, uttered between clenched teeth, were so gloomy that it made people\u2019s blood run cold.All the ministers felt that if it hadn't been for the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet, the furious King Jing would have rushed forward and strangled Huo Wujiu.Upon seeing this, the emperor\u2019s rage finally dropped a couple of notches.Right, there was still King Jing. There was no need for the emperor to take action himself and spoil the joy of his birthday.Huo Wujiu dared to spout a stream of empty rhetoric, but once they returned to King Jing\u2019s mansion, he was sure to beg for life and then death.Under the high platform, his uncle also shook his head at him, signaling for the emperor to suppress his anger and not to get angry.He grit his teeth and squeezed a few words out in between them.\"Spoilsport,\" he said. \"All right, I'm hungry. Let's start the feast.\"At once, the courtiers all around hastened to raise their cups as if nothing had happened. An orchestra of traditional Chinese stringed and woodwind instruments sounded, and grandsounding, peaceful music immediately echoed, like a desperate attempt to chase away the thick tension in the hall just now.The emperor took a sip of wine.Strange.Although it was a dog-eat-dog situation, and dripping fresh blood was very nice, why did he have this feeling that...although they bit each other, he couldn\u2019t take advantage of them at all?\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou vaguely figured out why Huo Wujiu did this.He didn't quite dare to believe it.Could it be that Huo Wujiu really took such a big risk just to keep him from kowtowing to the emperor alone?Huo Wujiu must know better than he did that the emperor was a wretch. Regardless of the occasion, he would most likely, in a fit of anger, drag him back to the Imperial Prison in front of all the civil and military officials to be drawn and quartered.Jiang Suizhou's heart was quite shaken.But he did not dare to look at Huo Wujiu more than once.He still needed to put on a cold look at this time, treating Huo Wujiu who was next to him as if he was air. He barely took a few bites of the food on the table and only occasionally drank a glass of wine.Moreover, none of the officials in the hall dared to offend him. When they walked to and fro to toast, they tacitly bypassed Jiang Suizhou's table.On the contrary, this saved Jiang Suizhou from a lot of trouble.Outside the door, the pattering rain didn\u2019t lessen at all. Amidst the glittering lights, toasts went gaily around, and the faces of the people were gradually dyed the drunken color of pinkish red.Some ministers began to go forward to give the emperor a toast.Jiang Suizhou was bored silly, sitting at the table listening to their exaggerated birthday toasts. He occasionally stole glances at Huo Wujiu out of the corner of his eye, involuntarily replaying what had just happened in his mind.Just then, he heard a voice from the front of the steps.That person\u2019s eloquence was quite remarkable. He jabbered on and on, without finishing his benediction. Jiang Suizhou was quite amazed when he heard him, and glanced at him....Chen Ti?The man who had his wife hand Huo Wujiu an invitation to enjoy the flowers.Jiang Suizhou picked up his cup of tea and took a sip.In terms of ass-kissing, this man was indeed an expert at everything. It was no wonder he was making a living under Pang Shao.Just then, Jiang Suizhou heard Chen Ti, who had drained his cup of wine, speak. \"Your Majesty, today is a day of rejoicing, so I\u2019d like to brazenly ask for a grace from Your Majesty,\" he said with a grin.Then Jiang Suizhou heard the emperor ask, \"What is it? Tell me.\"Then he saw Chen Ti holding his cup and saying with a smile, \"A few days ago, my humble wife handed a written invitation to King Jing's residence, wanting to invite Madam Huo to enjoy the flowers. But Madam Huo is a newcomer and was a bit reserved, so he rejected the invitation.\"After he said this, Chen Ti turned his head and looked at Jiang Suizhou's table with a smile.\"For fear of slighting His highness King Jing, my humble wife specifically asked me to beg Your Majesty to allow Madam Huo to come to my humble abode in half a month's time for a flower viewing banquet.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Inviting Huo Wujiu to his courtyard to appreciate some rotten flowers was a pretense. Seeing that the emperor suffered a defeat, Chen Ti purposely provided the emperor a comeback at his own banquet. What he was really doing was sucking up to the emperor\u2019s ass.After all, Chen Ti had been under Pang Shao's command. His official position was not high, so there were few opportunities for him to really show his face in front of the emperor. Last time, Jiang Suizhou turned down his invitation, but in turn gave him a raft, giving him a chance to win a laugh from the emperor.As expected, the emperor responded readily, and gave Jiang Suizhou no chance to refute. He even promoted Chen Ti half a rank higher on the spot, rewarding him with a cushy job.The banquet was, of course, to everyone\u2019s delight and satisfaction, except that Jiang Suizhou\u2019s pretend coldness had turned real cold.At the end of the palace banquet, the rain fell even harder outside.And with the sudden downpour, a gust of wind blew, whistling and stirring the brocade curtains on the carriage. Droplets of rain also blew into the carriage.Shortly after, half of Jiang Suizhou\u2019s shoulders were wet, but he did not feel anything. He only stared frostily out the window.Jiang Suizhou knew that although the palace banquet was not a Hongmen Banquet 1 , those people had long been fully motivated to take them for the sheer pleasure of the emperor.He definitely couldn\u2019t counterattack all overt attacks and covert means. However, when such a bootlicker suddenly took advantage of him, he was still upset.Especially...What about Huo Wujiu?Jiang Suizhou had always been afraid that Huo Wujiu would hate him, and planning for him had become a habit. Although the matter today had nothing to do with him, Jiang Suizhou was still irritated by it.Just then, a cold wind whistled in, making Jiang Suizhou shiver from the cold.His throat itched, and he coughed.But before he could cough, a soft and heavy cloak fell on him without warning. The cloak carried a nice and warm body heat that bundled him up in a split second.Jiang Suizhou was stunned. He raised his head and saw Huo Wujiu sitting next to him, as silent as a post.It was he who took off his cloak and draped it onto Jiang Suizhou.\"You...\" Now that he took off his cloak, Jiang Suizhou found that Huo Wujiu was already thinly dressed, so Jiang Suizhou moved to take off the cloak and give it back to him.It was just then that he heard Huo Wujiu speak: \u201cYou\u2019ve just recovered.\u201dJiang Suizhou clutched Huo Wujiu's cloak in his hand: \"Hmm?\"Huo Wujiu turned his head sideways and looked at Jiang Suizhou.\"Drape it properly over your shoulders,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou awkwardly draped the huge cloak over himself.Although he was not in good health now, he had at least been a healthy person for more than twenty years, so he often forgot that he was a sick man. He never expected that Huo Wujiu was more mindful of it than he was.Seeing that Jiang Suizhou obediently retracted into his cloak, Huo Wujiu tucked in the corners for him, and then turned around with satisfaction.Jiang Suizhou glanced at him.He somehow felt that Huo Wujiu's lip color was not right. When they had arrived, his lips were a bit pale, but they seemed a bit whiter now.\u201c...Are you not cold?\" He asked.He heard Huo Wujiu snort and glanced at him: \"What kind of cold is this?\"When it came to coldness, Yangguan was called cold. The snow in winter could bury tent doors overnight, and they had to dig and kick to open the doors.In the dimly lit carriage, Huo Wujiu raised his eyebrow slightly as he looked sideways, revealing a touch of rare juvenile spirit.His appearance was a bit similar to how he looked in the palace hall earlier. However, it was less aggressive, and even somewhat showing off.Jiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t help but follow him with a chuckle, wrapped in the big cloak.\u201cForget it if you\u2019re not cold,\u201d he said.Seeing him smile, Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze couldn't help but stay on him. He stared at Jiang Suizhou a couple more times.In a dim corner of the carriage, the robe on his leg had long been drenched. The dampness seeped into his injured leg, and it felt like a blade was digging into his bones. It hurt so much that he started to shiver uncontrollably.It was because of the bumpy ride that Jiang Suizhou was unaware that something was astir.However, it was just right that he took no notice.Although taking off his cloak and wrapping it around his legs might alleviate the pain to a certain degree, Huo Wujiu could not bear to see the sick rabbit shivering. For him, he just had to endure the pain, and it would soon pass. But if King Jing were to freeze and fall ill again due to the wind and rain, he\u2019d have to take fever medicine when they \u00a0returned. He was afraid he would cry again because of the bitter decoction.Now, it was really not a loss in exchange for his not half bad smile.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou slept lightly at night.He went back to his room, changed his robes and laid down, still thinking about what happened today. He mulled over everything as the rain outside the window was pouring, and he fell asleep in a daze.He was awakened by the sound of a small, crisp object falling to the ground.He opened his eyes, and found that only a night lamp was lit outside the canopy. What was brighter was the lightning flashes outside the window. He looked sideways at the window and saw a tall silhouette amidst the lightning flashes and rumbling thunder. He sat up from the bed with some effort, seemingly to pick up something.Jiang Suizhou quickly got up.\"What's wrong?\" His voice sounded hoarse from having just woken up.Huo Wujiu didn't respond to him for a moment, and only with great effort did he manage to sit up straight.Jiang Suizhou hurriedly got out of bed, put on his shoes and walked to the couch.It wasn't until Jiang Suizhou was in front of him that Huo Wujiu seemed to notice that he was awake. Huo Wujiu's eyebrows were tightly furrowed as he raised his head to look at him. He asked in a dumb voice, \"Did I wake you up?\"In the dim light of the night, his face was exceptionally white, and his forehead was covered with a layer of fine sweat, which soaked the strands of hair on his forehead.Footnote:1 Hongmen banquet - a metaphor for a banquet that hides murderous intent and attempts to harm guests.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed a little disoriented by the pain.His hand was also shaking.Jiang Suizhou had never seen Huo Wujiu like this before, not even when he came out of the prison, feverish and with his wounds still inflamed.\"Where are you hurting? I'll ask Meng Qianshan to fetch the doctor!\"Huo Wujiu just shook his head.\"I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s raining, which makes my legs uncomfortable.\"He didn't seem to know how wretched he looked at this point, and still stubbornly strained to speak.\"My medicine fell on the floor; just help me pick it up,\" he said.When Jiang Suizhou heard him say medicine, he hurriedly bent down to pick it up for him. A small medicine bottle fell to the ground two steps away. The material was plain but especially sturdy, so it did not break.Jiang Suizhou handed the medicine to him.He watched as Huo Wujiu tremblingly and slowly poured one out, put it in his mouth and swallowed it. Then, he stuffed the medicine bottle into his arms and laid down with his eyes closed.It looked like he was going to go back to sleep.Jiang Suizhou was stunned and asked, \"What is this medicine for?\"According to the normal course of events before Huo Wujiu\u2019s capture, he couldn\u2019t have possibly known that his legs would be crippled. How could he have brought leg curing medicine with him?Huo Wujiu frowned and opened his eyes again.Although he was dizzy with pain this time, and his eyes were blurry to the point where he could not even feel his body shaking, he knew the cause of his leg pain.His meridians were damaged, so when it rained on a cloudy day, this kind of pain was naturally indispensable, not to mention the humid and rainy Southern Jing. This pain was not life-threatening, just a little trying to endure. There was no doubt that when the rain stopped, he would naturally feel better.\"A kind of medicine that keeps people from dying.\" Hearing Jiang Suizhou ask him anxiously at the side, as if he had encountered something serious, the corners of Huo Wujiu\u2019s lips curled up. Huo Wujiu\u2019s voice was hoarse, mixed with a touch of nonchalance.Huo Wujiu hadn't felt anything yet, but why did King Jing get so scared that his hair stood on ends?Hearing his reply, Jiang Suizhou's eyes widened.You're in such pain, yet you're still taking medication indiscriminately?It's obvious that you think you\u2019ve lived long enough!\"Nonsense!\" Jiang Suizhou blurted out, turned around and hurriedly went outside.\"Meng Qianshan!\"Huo Wujiu sat crookedly on the couch. His ears were buzzing, and he vaguely heard Jiang Suizhou's anxious voice. Tch, this was a trivial matter for him to be causing such a fuss about.\u201cYou\u2019re making a fuss over nothing.\u201dHuo Wujiu grunted impatiently. However, he could not control the corners of his lips, which wanted to curl upwards.\u2014\u2014Lights were lit up all over Anyin Hall, bringing a melting warmth in the midst of the cold rain.The mansion doctor, Zhou, listened to Huo Wujiu\u2019s pulse and examined his injury carefully. After a long time, he stood up.\"How is he?\" Jiang Suizhou asked beside him.Doctor Zhou bowed to him and answered, \"Your Highness, Madam\u2019s symptoms are what were left behind by his damaged meridians. Whenever it is cold and rainy or snowy, the pain will be excruciating.\"Jiang Suizhou frowned: \"Is there any cure?\"Doctor Zhou shook his head.\"There is no other way, unless Madam's meridians are restored to their previous state\u2026But, the meridians on Madam's legs are completely damaged. It is truly incurable.\"Jiang Suizhou frowned deeper and deeper.He naturally knew that Huo Wujiu's legs could be cured, but the doctor in his mansion didn't have the ability to do so. He originally thought that it would be enough to wait for the doctor who could cure Huo Wujiu's leg to appear three years later, but he never thought that these three years would be so difficult for Huo Wujiu.A mere rain had already rendered Huo Wujiu this tortured. The air in Lin'an was humid, and it always rained. Wouldn't Huo Wujiu suffer three years of punishment in a row?Jiang Suizhou didn't say anything for a while.Doctor Zhou carefully observed his expression and said, \"However, if you wrap Madam\u2019s legs with the bedding and a bed warmer 1 , it will more or less relieve his pain.\"As soon as Jiang Suizhou heard this, he quickly instructed Meng Qianshan, \"Why don't you go and prepare it?\"Meng Qianshan hurriedly answered and directed the maids to get busy.Doctor Zhou excused himself, and soon after, the maids brought a heavy quilt over and covered Huo Wujiu's legs.Jiang Suizhou asked, \"Do you feel any better?\"Huo Wujiu sat on the couch and stared at Jiang Suizhou.King Jing was still wearing his pajamas. He just put on an outer garment and sat on the chair in front of his couch.It was late at night, and he was obviously not in good spirits. He looked exhausted, and his complexion was not good. Perhaps because he was sensitive to the cold, Meng Qianshan also gave Jiang Suizhou a hand warmer to warm his hands. He was now unconsciously squeezing the warm fluffy thing in his hand, frowning at him.Huo Wujiu really didn\u2019t feel if the quilt had any use...He only felt a pressing panic.Since his legs were disabled, his meridians were not very smooth. His legs were often cold, and even if covered with a quilt, it was difficult to warm them back. Moreover, the dampness was pervasive. If it could penetrate even his flesh, the brocade cotton meant nothing. However, he seemed reluctant to see King Jing disappointed. Although he felt it was useless deep inside, he perfunctorily said, \"Better.\"Sure enough, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s fox-like eyes lit up.Immediately afterwards, King Jing seemed to have realized what he was holding in his hand and looked down at the warm fluffy hand warmer.It was white and made of rabbit fur. It was soft, akin to holding a rabbit.Huo Wujiu watched as King Jing carefully lifted his quilt and placed the white, rabbit-like hand warmer onto his lap.Then, he paused, as if he thought of something else.The next moment, a hot hand that had been warmly heated by the hand warmer was placed on his leg and the warmth was felt through his thin layer of Huo Wujiu\u2019s pants. Then Jiang Suizhou rubbed up and down slowly and clumsily, and slowly massaged his legs a few more times.\u201cThis...Is this better?\u201dHuo Wujiu heard King Jing ask.Huo Wujiu couldn't answer him for a while.Although his legs were crippled, they weren\u2019t without senses.Huo Wujiu couldn't perceive whether he was feeling better. He just felt an electric current rushing up from there and numbing half of his body.Footnote:1 Tang Po/bed warmer - a copper round pot filled with hot water and placed in the bed to increase the temperaturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only felt that the leg he was rubbing under his hand was cold as hell.He rubbed Huo Wujiu\u2019s legs tentatively, and massaged them a few times. The muscles under his palms were rock hard, and it took a lot of effort to massage them. Nevertheless, it seemed that as Jiang Suizhou massaged, Huo Wujiu\u2019s legs gradually warmed up a bit.Jiang Suizhou's eyes lit up.\u201cIs this any better?\" He looked askance at Huo Wujiu.However, Huo Wujiu sat there with a cold face and didn't speak....Does it mean he\u2019s feeling better or not?Jiang Suizhou was momentarily baffled, but his hands underneath took action and massaged Huo Wujiu again.Just then, a hand suddenly grabbed his wrist and pulled his hands out of the quilt.Jiang Suizhou was startled when he saw those deep black eyes looking at him coldly.\u201cWhy are you touching me?\u201d Huo Wujiu scowled.He startled Jiang Suizhou, who withdrew his hand posthaste.He...He just massaged his legs a couple of times; why was he getting angry?!Jiang Suizhou was stunned, but soon came to his senses.He forgot that Huo Wujiu\u2019s legs were disabled, so he probably hated others touching him. Jiang Suizhou must have been stroking the tiger's whiskers.For a while, Jiang Suizhou was a little at a loss.He was inwardly chagrined and didn\u2019t notice that Huo Wujiu struggled to support his body on the couch, leaning slightly sideways.Next to him, Meng Qianshan had already led a group of maids, who found bed warmers for Huo Wujiu, stuffed them, steaming hot, into his blanket, and then withdrew along with them.Jiang Suizhou also followed suit and stood up.\"...I\u2019m sorry,\" He apologized and then paused and said, \"I didn't mean to touch your legs just now.\"Hearing his apology, Huo Wujiu who was on the bed opened his mouth, as if to say something.A moment later, Huo Wujiu lowered his eyes and said in a low voice, \"It's okay. Go to sleep.\"Jiang Suizhou sighed with relief when he heard him say that.Although Huo Wujiu\u2019s tone was still quite blunt...this meant that he wouldn\u2019t mind him anymore, right?Jiang Suizhou was not afraid of others being angry with him, but he was afraid of this ancestor. After all, unlike others, when this ancestor got angry, the consequences were fatal.With this in mind, Jiang Suizhou replied and was about to return to his bed when he turned around and said, \"This couch is a bit close to the window; why don't you go sleep on the bed?\"Hearing this, Huo Wujiu only closed his eyes and didn\u2019t respond to him.It meant that he was averse to the idea.Although Jiang Suizhou was still a bit worried, he couldn't force Huo Wujiu to the bed. Seeing that the bedding on him was thick and durable and thinking that it would be of some use, Jiang Suizhou did not insist.He went back to the bed, changed his robe and lay back under the covers.Before closing his eyes, he did not forget to remind Huo Wujiu, \"If it hurts again, just call out to me.\"Huo Wujiu remained silent.Jiang Suizhou had long been used to talking to this log unilaterally, so after speaking, he closed his eyes again.Huo Wujiu, who was sitting on the couch, did not move at all.He waited until Jiang Suizhou\u2019s breathing on the bed became steady. He made sure that the man was asleep before raising his hand to lift the quilt covering his legs and dragged out the hot bed warmer while at it.It was thick and heavy, and covered with a few stove-like stuff, as if for fear of not roasting his legs.Sure enough, it was a stupid thing that Meng Qianshan did.Huo Wujiu didn't want to admit that the warmth brought by the thick bedding and the steaming pile of bed warmers were no match for the hand that had clumsily massaged his legs a few times.But the feelings brought on by those hands were somewhat complicated. Besides warmth, it also added something else, which made him flustered and want to escape immediately.He even ended up scaring King Jing.Huo Wujiu\u2019s complexion turned ugly, and he tossed several bed warmers out of the quilt.Until he came across a fluffy thing which Jiang Suizou had stuffed in just now.He faltered, let go of the little white rabbit and covered it back with the quilt back, letting the little thing snuggle in his lap and softly warm him up.However, something still seemed to be missing.A few moments later, Huo Wujiu skeptically placed his hand underneath the bedding and covered his leg, rubbing it a few times....It didn\u2019t work at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But the object was so soft that it passed straight through his hands and landed softly on his bed.When Jiang Suizhou looked down, he saw that it was the hand warmer that Meng Qianshan stuffed in his blanket yesterday.The hot water inside had long since lost its heat, except for the fluff on the surface, which carried a faint temperature, like someone's body heat.Jiang Suizhou looked up and heard Huo Wujiu faintly say, \"Many thanks.\"\u2014\u2014 Oh, he\u2019s thanking me for this bed warmer.The corners of Jiang Suizhou's mouth couldn't help but curl up into a smile.He said it. This General Huo Wujiu was indeed a remarkable man. Yesterday, Meng Qianshan clearly gave him so many bed warmers, yet Huo Wujiu still remembered that he gave him this. He even thanked him for it.\"Don\u2019t mention it.\" Jiang Suizhou's voice was tinged with smiles.Huo Wujiu merely looked at him indifferently and withdrew his gaze coldly.The sun was getting higher, so Jiang Suizhou rolled over and got off the bed.Although yesterday was the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet and officials of all ranks were to rest today, the Ministry of Rites could not rest. All the things prepared for yesterday's banquet needed to be sorted out and sent to the registry.Ji You had said that Jiang Suizhou was not well enough to go, but Jiang Suizhou did not want Ji You to make an exception for him. He would just drop by to see if there was anything he could do.While considering all this, he also thought of the books that Ji You lent him days ago.The two books of unofficial history were not too thick, so counting the days, he could now return them to Ji You.With this in mind, he stood up and intended to ask Meng Qianshan to come in.But at this time, the door was opened in a panic.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes to see Meng Qianshan hastily stumbling in.\"Your Highness, something has happened, Your Highness!\" Meng Qianshan immediately reported.Jiang Suizhou frowned: \"What's happened?\"Meng Qianshan was gasping for breath when he said, \"Something has happened to the Ministry of Rites! Just now, someone from the court came to report that Lord Ji You was impeached and taken away by the Ministry of Justice!\"Jiang Suizhou was stunned.\"On what charge?\"He remembered Ji You's life, and there should not be such a thing. Although Ji You had no great achievements, his life could be considered smooth-sailing. After the fall of the Jing Dynasty, the Northern Liang originally wanted to recruit him, but he refused. After that, he resigned and returned to his hometown to enjoy the landscape to his heart\u2019s content.How could he be arrested out of the blue?Just then, Meng Qianshan said, \u201cAn official from the Ministry of Justice said that Lord Ji embezzled the budget on the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet, using second best material and cutting corners. Someone discovered it this morning!\"This was even more unlikely.Jiang Suizhou frowned: \"Has he already been arrested and taken to the Ministry of Justice?\"Meng Qianshan immediately nodded.Jiang Suizhou's face turned serious as he raised his hand and said, \"Change my clothes.\"Meng Qianshan was stunned: \"Your Highness, you are...\"Jiang Suizhou interrupted, \"I'm going to the Ministry of Justice.\"Meng Qianshan stomped his feet anxiously when he heard his words: \"Why on earth are you going there?! At present, all the officials in the Ministry of Rites are in hiding, fearing that the officials and soldiers will come to their doors. Why are you rushing to go there?\"Jiang Suizhou remained expressionless.\"Cut the crap.\"Meng Qianshan did not dare to defy, so he could only step forward to change Jiang Suizhou\u2019s robes.Jiang Suizhou's gaze turned sullen.He knew that since the Ministry of Rites was in trouble, after arresting Ji You, the officials of the Ministry of Rites were bound to be arrested and interrogated one by one. As a King, taking the initiative to clear himself of suspicion was nothing unusual and would not attract suspicion elsewhere.But what he wanted to do, naturally, was not to clear his suspicion.He wanted to know why Ji You, who had not met with a mishap so far, was arrested.Was it because this was an unofficial history, which was different from the official history? Or because he translated and had contact with Ji You, which had become a variable in Ji You's life track?\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 39The news that Jiang Suizhou was going to the Ministry of Justice had already spread. When he got off the carriage, the Minister of Justice was waiting for him outside the door.When the Minister of Justice saw him get off, he greeted him with a smile and, seeing that Jiang Suizhou was walking weakly, even reached out to help him.Jiang Suizhou didn\u2019t show him any deference and evaded him sideways, as Meng Qianshan was steadily supporting him.\"I\u2019ve been waiting for Your Highness for a long time. Your Highness, please,\" the Minister of Justice smiled, moved sideways and said.Jiang Suizhou spoke indifferently: \"You and I are of the same rank, so there is no need to be polite. Besides, I\u2019m here today to be tried.\"When the Minister of Justice heard this, he laughed and replied, \"What are you talking about, Your Highness? Our Ministry of Justice is investigating this case, but because Your Highness had a sickness some days ago, you had no part in this matter. Even if we want to investigate, we also can not investigate Your Highness...\"Jiang Suizhou raised his hand to put a stop to his speech.\"There are some things that I have handled.\" He said indifferently. \"Even if you do not check, I need to personally ask.\"Hearing him say this, the Minister of Justice responded repeatedly and invited him in.The cause and effect was just an ordinary case of embezzlement. The funds received by the Ministry of Rites were approved by the Ministry of Revenue. The total sum and where it was spent were all recorded in the accounts. However, when sorting the accounts this morning was coming to an end, someone suddenly found that many of the gold and jade arranged as banquet furnishings were all substandard. After accounting for all of it, there was a considerable discrepancy in the numbers.\"Our Ministry of punishment has roughly calculated that Lord Ji has embezzled at least this number!\" The Minister of Justice held up for fingers at Jiang Suizhou.\u201cBe frank, and don\u2019t speak in riddles with me,\u201d Jiang Suizhou said coldly.The Minister of Justice replied, \"At least four thousand taels.\"Four thousand taels, though not an enormous amount, was taken from the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet. Embezzling behind the emperor\u2019s back, no matter if it was only four thousands taels, was a major crime for ordinary officials, with sentences ranging from exile to beheading.Jiang Suizhou did not say anything.On the other hand, the Minister of Justice continued chattering, \"Your Highness, there is no need to worry. From now on, even if our Ministry of Justice goes to your house to investigate, it will only be a routine check. This matter is mainly about Ji You and has nothing to do with you...\"However, Jiang Suizhou returned lightly, \u201cI need to see Ji You.\u201dThe Minister of Justice was stunned, and a bit of reluctance surfaced on his face.\u201cThis...Ji You is currently being detained\u2026\u201d he faltered.Jiang Suizhou remained unperturbed.\"There is a batch of raw materials that I took over,\" he said. \"I need to ask him privately about this matter before I can be at ease.\u201dHearing these words, the Minister of Justice probably understood.Ji You was corrupt, but King Jing wasn\u2019t a good man either.King Jing was probably not at all clean about handling His Majesty's birthday banquet, so he was so anxious and rushed to the Ministry of Justice. Moreover, he also wanted to interrogate Ji You privately.However, the Minister of Justice had long received an order from the top that this matter today must be settled and pinned on Ji You. Well, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if His Highness King Jing wanted to pass the blame to Ji You.After all, what could His Majesty say even if His Highness King Jing, his royal relative, embezzled some silver?With this thought in mind, the Minister of Justice also put his guard down and reluctantly agreed to take Jiang Suizhou to the Ministry of Justice\u2019 prison.Most of the criminals held in the cells of the Ministry of Justice were those who were still under suspicion, still on trial, or were relatively guilty of minor crimes. Therefore, the security of the Ministry of Justice\u2019s prison was not so strict compared with the Imperial Court\u2019s Prison. The environment was also better. There were even small windows everywhere for light and ventilation in the cells.Jiang Suizhou followed the Minister of Justice all the way to the depths of the prison. After turning a corner, he saw Ji You, who was detained in a cell.Ji You was sitting alone on a straw-covered bed in his cell. As he had only just been imprisoned, his clothes were still tidy, and he was in good spirits.Hearing someone coming, Ji You lifted his head.Then he saw Jiang Suizhou, who stopped at the door of the cell and raised his hand to signal the Minister of Justice to go out and wait.\u201cErr\u2026\u201d The Minister of Justice hesitated.\"Half a stick of an incense,\" Jiang Suizhou said.The Minister of Justice hesitated for a moment and nodded: \"Then Your Highness must cut the long story short. I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the entrance of the cell.\"The minister thought to himself: after all, Ji You had already been sent to prison, so His Highness King Jing must have nothing too important to ask him. Ji You was not a high ranking official and did not have any backing, so it would not be worthwhile to provoke King Jing over this trivial matter.The Minister of Justice retired.Seeing that he was far away, Jiang Suizhou stepped forward: \"Lord Ji.\"Ji You got up from the bed and walked to the door of the cell, staring at Jiang Suizhou through the iron bars.\"Your Highness King Jing..?\" He was awashed with disbelief.Jiang Suizhou paused and said unhurriedly, \"...I originally wanted to return your books today.\"His words caught Ji You off guard, and then he smiled bitterly.\"Your Highness doesn't need to return them,\" he said, \"Unexpected situations may happen any time, and people have their own destiny. I guess my destiny is right here.\"Jiang Suizhou felt deeply uncomfortable when he saw Ji You\u2019s appearance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In recent days, I have had some dealings with you, so this time, they must be taking precautions.\"His tone was calm, and he didn\u2019t mean to blame Jiang Suizhou at all. However, the hands that Jiang Suizhou placed by his sides were clenched tighter and tighter....He had guessed right.Ji You himself didn't know, but he knew that for Ji You, he was a drop of calamity from heaven.The original owner and Ji You did not cross paths. Ji You never wanted to side with any party or group, plus he had no real power in his hand. Pang Shao naturally wouldn't pay attention to him. However, because of Jiang Suizhou who transmigrated and had a few chats with Ji You, Ji You had some intersections with him. Ji You even took care of Jiang Suizhou because of his poor health. It was only then that Pang Shao was alerted and thus decided to dispose of Ji You.Seeing that Jiang Suizhou was silent and did not speak, Ji You froze and then smiled gently.\"Your Highness, you don\u2019t need to blame yourself,\" Ji You said, \"Ever since I refused to join Pang's faction, I knew that this day would come sooner or later. I am a lazy person with mediocre natural endowments. I have been an official for more than ten years, but I have not achieved much. Now that I\u2019ve landed myself in this situation, it has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s only because I hold office at court and maintain my dignity alone.\u201dBut Jiang Suizhou, who had been silent for a long time, shook his head.He raised his eyes to Ji You.In the dimly lit cell, Ji You met a pair of jet black eyes through the wooden bars.Those eyes were somewhat white, and coupled with their charm and exquisite outlines, they were downright flattering. But at this time, there was something firm and bright glimmering in his eyes.\"The matter has not been thoroughly investigated, so you will not be immediately convicted.\"Ji You heard Jiang Suizhou\u2019s lowered voice, which carried a natural magnetism.\"Your Excellency, rest well in the prison. I swear that you will not suffer injustice.\"\u2014\u2014The day was getting late, and a light drizzle was falling outside.Meng Qianshan was a little uneasy. He\u2019d been wandering around at the door of Anyin Hall, repeatedly sending young servants to the door of the house to ask if his master had come back.This morning, the King asked his company for a trip to the Ministry of Justice. After he came out of the jail, he looked gloomy and did not say a word.When they arrived at Changping Street, a mile away from Qinghe Square, the King called the carriage to a halt and got off.\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone follow me,\u201d the King commanded, \"I will return to the residence after a stroll around by myself.\"Meng Qianshan hastily tried to persuade him, but when met with Jiang Suizhou's cold face, he didn\u2019t dare to speak a word.Meng Qianshan had no other choice and could only help Jiang Suizhou get out of the carriage, and then send two guards to follow him from afar.Unexpectedly, the King got off the carriage and never came back.Seeing that the time was getting late, Meng Qianshan's heart jumped in his throat.He hated himself for being too obedient, but this was a habit he ingrained in him since childhood. He was dull, and the King didn't like him since he was a child, but he also didn't drive Meng Qianshan away because Meng Qianshan was sent to him by the previous emperor.Meng Qianshan grew up being cautious and obedient to the King's orders, thinking that this could make up for his dumb head. It had never occurred to him, however, that he would commit an evil deed because of this.As he turned around for an unknown number of revolutions, he heard the sound of a wheelchair approaching.Meng Qianshan looked up and saw that Huo Wujiu had already stopped before him.\"What's wrong?\" He heard Huo Wujiu ask.Meng Qianshan immediately answered, \"Madam, I was too stupid to have let His Highness go out alone. He hasn't returned yet...\"Huo Wugou raised his eyes and glanced out the door.The rain was not heavy, but it was drizzling and had not stopped for a long time.\"You are indeed stupid.\" Huo Wujiu said.He spoke in a calm tone, but with an indefinable pressure. Meng Qianshan got scared. He was unable to say anything, looking cautiously at Huo Wujiu.Huo Wugui's gaze shifted from the rain outside the window to Meng Qianshan's face.\"It's so late, so why didn't you send someone to look for him? What's the use of circling around here?\" His voice was deep and cold.As if awakening from a dream, Meng Qianshan said repeatedly, \"Right, right! How did I forget?!\"While speaking, he immediately rushed into the rain.But at that moment, a young servant braved the rain and ran all the way into Anyin Hall.\"Eunuch Qianshan, His Highness is back!\" Before the servant reached the front of the hall, he reported the news urgently.Meng Qianshan hurriedly welcomed him to the veranda.The servant drew closer in a sprint, panting.\"The Highness is back. Although the mansion guard gave him an umbrella, he was still fairly drenched in the rain,\" said the servant.Meng Qianshan asked urgently, \"What did His Highness do?\"The servant paused, and his voice weakened. \u201cI don\u2019t know where His Highness went...he drank too much wine,\u201d he whispered.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just because of only a few moments of goodwill to him, Ji You was implicated and was sent to prison, with his future uncertain and even his life and death unknown.And all this was because of Pang Shao.For Jiang Suizhou, Pang Shao was just a treacherous minister recorded in history books, but now he was a villain with a butcher's knife in hand, casting his greedy eyes on his prey and eager to persecute the people around him at any time.Jiang Suizhou actually naively thought that he could temporarily circumvent him and survive these three years.Jiang Suizhou felt like a boulder was weighing down on his heart, making him feel out of breath.He wanted to find a place to vent his frustration, but he had just transmigrated and didn\u2019t even know anyone he could talk to. He just held on until the carriage drove through Changping Street.Changping Street was full of merchants and people, coming and going. It was very lively. The smoke from the restaurants curled up. People passed by, and the merchants shuttled to and fro, giving the impression of a peaceful and quiet world that was completely different from the noble and cold King Jing Mansion.Jiang Suizhou called the carriage to a stop there and walked away.At that second, he felt desperate to get away from King Jing\u2019s identity, from this world, and return to the multitude of people to which he originally belonged.However, there was nowhere for him to be accepted by the masses.He walked aimlessly on Changping Street. People came and went around him, but he seemed to be clearly isolated.After walking for a while, Jiang Suizhou raised his head and saw a fluttering wine flag.He went to the wine shop, asked for some wine, and drank alone until late at night.The wine was not strong, but was a common southern apricot wine. It had its own sweet aroma and wasn\u2019t intoxicating. But when Jiang Suizhou got up, he felt dizzy. His feet felt floaty, and he was already drunk.He propped himself up on the table and stood firm.It was fine to be drunk, he said to himself. He had had enough of being sober day after day since he transmigrated here.He staggered out of the wine shop and walked step by step back to the royal residence.It started raining outside at some point. It wasn\u2019t heavy, and he didn't mind getting wet in the rain. When he reached the door of the royal residence, he realized afterwards that someone had been holding an umbrella behind him.When he looked back, he saw a guard who he had never met before. Seeing him looking at himself, the guard's legs went weak, and he almost dropped to his knees before him.Jiang Suizhou frowned and waved his hand sluggishly.Yes, here he was, just the King of Jing who was feared like a tiger and wolf.Someone brought a palanquin, but he didn't climb up. He trudged on the wet stone brick ground all the way back to the Anyin Hall.He had just entered the courtyard gate when he saw Meng Qianshan, braving the rain and running all the way towards him.\"Your Highness!\" Meng Qianshan was so anxious that his voice trembled. \"Where have you been? You scared me...\"\"Didn't you send someone to follow me.\" Jiang Suizhou's voice sounded a little dumb.Meng Qianshan was startled and thought that Jiang Suizhou was going to blame him.But before he could speak, Jiang Suizhou raised his hand.He walked straight up the steps, stopped at the bottom of the porch, and turned back to say, \"Don't mind me, wait outside the door.\"Meng Qianshan ventured nothing but responded affirmatively.Jiang Suizhou lifted his feet and entered the room. He closed the door, took a few steps forward, and leaned on the side partition.He then titled his head up, closed his eyes, and took a few deep breaths.When he woke up from this drunken sleep tomorrow, he would need to plan how to absolve Ji You of his charges.But right now, he just wanted to be alone for a while.He closed his eyes and leaned there for a while until he gradually calmed down in the dizzying punch of the wine, and then slowly opened his eyes.Then he saw a person sitting in front of him, quietly looking at him.Jiang Suizhou looked at the man, stunned, and then gave an unguarded, drunken smile.\"There you are,\" he said lethargically, \"I've forgotten.\"Then he saw Huo Wujiu open his mouth and ask, \"Why did you drink so much?\"Jiang Suizhou shook his head with a smile and said, \"I didn't drink much. It's all because I can\u2019t hold my liquor.\"Huo Wujiu frowned.Jiang Suizhou was indeed drunk.His face was flushed, and his gaze was lax. His robe was still wet, and although the upper half of his body hadn't gotten wet, the hem of his robe and the legs of his trousers were damp with water.Huo Wujiu said, \"Go change your clothes first.\"Jiang Suizhou smiled, raised his hand and rubbed the corner of his forehead. He uttered an \u201coh\u201d, and then straightened up on the partition.However, he had been leaning on the partition for too long, and because the booze had already soaked his mind, he had not much strength. After he took a step, his feet softened, and he dove straight forward.Jiang Suizhou later registered that he was falling.But he was too slow to react, and couldn\u2019t promptly, so he fell straight to the ground.However, the pain that he had expected did not befall him, and instead, he fell on a hard warmth.He opened his eyes drunkenly, and saw Huo Wujiu's handsome face well within reach. His dark eyes were staring at him quietly from very close by.Huo Wujiu caught him.He was lying in Huo Wujiu's arms, and because of how he supported his body, Huo Wujiu's action at this time was like embracing him into his arms.Jiang Suizhou was unaware of it.Looking at Huo Wujiu's face, he paused as if he remembered something and asked slowly.\"Do your legs still hurt today?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Suizhou\u2019s eyes were lax, staring at Huo Wujiu drunkenly, which immediately softened the latter\u2019s heart. It was as if Jiang Suizhou was gently poking on his soft spot.It seemed that his scent had gotten him somewhat intoxicated too.Huo Wujiu paused and whispered, \"It doesn't hurt anymore.\"Jiang Suizhou was still staring at him when he said, \"But it's raining outside.\"Huo Wujiu took a deep breath.For the first time, he felt that a drunk person was difficult to deal with, but also for the first time, he felt that, while this man was clearly so difficult to manage, he was not annoying at all.He patiently and slowly said, \"So you got wet. Get up and go change your clothes.\"Jiang Suizhou paused before he said as an afterthought, \"Oh...I got wet.\"With a casual push of his hand, he propped himself up on Huo Wujiu's shoulder and struggled to stand up. But once drunk people lost their strength, it would be difficult to get that strength back, so he tried several times, all in vain.Back and forth, it was akin to rubbing himself coquettishly in Huo Wujiu's arms.Huo Wujiu's face gradually became a little ugly.All of a sudden, Jiang Suizhou felt a hand holding his arm tightly, lifting him upwards and picking him straight up.Then, the man carried him in just one hand, while his other hand rolled his wheelchair. Huo Wujiu supported him all the way. He brought Jiang Suizhou to the bedside, and with the one hand carrying him, pressed him to sit on the bed.\"Change your clothes first,\" the man said.Jiang Suizhou let him carry him all the way, only to feel a dizzy spell on his head. When he sat down in bed, he somehow couldn't tell southeast from northwest.But he was obedient. When he heard Huo Wujiu\u2019s order, Jiang Suizhou clumsily peeled off his soaked outer robe and casually tossed it to the floor.\"I\u2019m not that wet...\" While stripping, he also muttered under his breath.After completing that task, he had no more strength and leaned sickly to the side against the bedpost.Seeing that Jiang Suizhou\u2019s inner clothes were dry and he most likely wouldn\u2019t catch a cold, Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t force him anymore. He pressed the wheelchair under his hand to go back to his own couch.But he heard Jiang Suizhou, who was leaning against the bed, sigh softly.The sigh was very soft, but Huo Wujiu could hear the exhaustion and bewilderment Jiang Suizhou was trying to hide.Huo Wujiu came to a stop, and the hand that was supposed to roll his wooden wheel also stopped in its place.He turned his head sideways and looked at Jiang Suizhou.Huo Wujiu saw Jiang Suizhou leaning sideways, his forehead against the bed frame. His eyes were drooping pensively, and he didn\u2019t utter a single word.The surroundings were quiet under the warmth of the lamp. Beautiful pearls and jades were everywhere. The man was clearly sitting in his territory, but he seemed to float in the void with no one to rely on.\u201c...What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Huo Wujiu, who had never been nosy, asked for some reason.It took Jiang Suizhou a moment to realize that Huo Wujiu was talking to him.He opened his eyes, and under the candle flames, those eyes were flooded with starry watery light.\"I've harmed someone.\" Speaking of this, his voice choked a little. \u201cHe was framed because of me.\"Huo Wugou most likely knew who he was referring to. After all, he was also present when Meng Qianshan rushed in early this morning.\"It has nothing to do with you,\" Huo Wujiu said.Even though he had been in the military for many years, he knew that some innocent people would always be sacrificed in the struggle to frame each other at court. Even if some people were not sacrificed because of Jiang Suizhou, it would be very difficult for them to wisely protect their own hide.Jiang Suizhou shook his head. \"It's my fault,\" he said, \"I must get him out.\"Speaking of which, a thought seemed to have occurred to him. His eyes blinked, and a tear suddenly rolled down from his eyes.Huo Wujiu panicked for no reason, and his movements were rather cramped.As the tear slid down, Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled tightly. His hand on his knee was also clenched into a fist.\"If you want to save him, save him. Why are you crying?\" Huo Wujiu said. After a pause, he added, \"Is it because you don't know how to save him?\"Although Huo Wujiu didn't know much about Southern Jing\u2019s imperial court, corruption cases had always been very flexible. After all, the flow of a sum of money had to go through many people\u2019s hands. It was not too difficult to save a person who was originally slandered.Jiang Suizhou, however, shook his head and raised his eyes to Huo Wujiu.Jiang Suizhou didn't seem to notice that he was crying. Now that he was looking tearfully at Huo Wujiu, he didn\u2019t even wipe the teardrops from his face.Such a gaze directed at Huo Wujiu made his chest a little tight. But for some reason, his heart became inexplicably active, one beat followed another, pounding especially fiercely. After staring at Huo Wujiu for a while, Jiang Suizhou sighed softly.\"Huo Wujiu, when will your leg heal?\"Huo Wujiu had no expression on his face, but his clenched jaw betrayed some emotions....When people got drunk, their speech would become incoherent.One moment Jiang Suizhou said he was going to save an unrelated person, and the next he wanted to heal his legs. Now that this man was drunk, he acted as if he could manage all other people\u2019s business under the heavens.However, Huo Wujiu was not too bothered when Jiang Suizhou\u2019s concern was on him.He seemed to have gotten used to this silly rabbit's stupid habit of putting him first in everything.A moment of silence later, Huo Wujiu lifted his hand and stretched his rough knuckles to wipe off the tears hanging on Jiang Suizhou's face, as if to wipe away those things that made him worried.\"It's alright,\" he said, \"Sleep.\"\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Huo Wujiu told him to sleep, he lay down obediently and let Huo Wujiu put down the bed curtains for him and extinguish the lights in the room.While lying in bed, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s thoughts were still in a mess. How great would it be if Huo Wujiu's legs healed right away?He would let him kill Pang Shao quickly and change the course of history, so that the latter\u2019s pawns would die an early death.With that in mind, Jiang Suizhou dizzily fell asleep.He slept for a long time, and when he opened his eyes again, the sky was already bright.The sun shining on Jiang Suizhou\u2019s face made him squint. He had a headache and got dizzy when he sat up....I drank too much yesterday.He could only recall memories from when he was still in the wine shop. When he had left out and let the cold wind blow on him, his thoughts were jumbled. Jiang Suizhou sat on the bed and rubbed his head, but he couldn't remember how he got back to the house yesterday.Right on cue, Meng Qianshan came in.Seeing that Jiang Suizhou had already woken up, Meng Qianshan hastily ordered a maid to bring hangover soup while he greeted him, \"Your Highness, you\u2019re awake.\"Jiang Suizhou rubbed his temples and nodded.Meng Qianshan said, \"Where is Your Highness uncomfortable? It\u2019s early in the day, so you can sleep a little longer. Officials from the Ministry of Justice have now gone to the Ministry of Rites to investigate the case. Early this morning, an official came to report that you don\u2019t have to go to work today.\"Hearing the words Ministry of Rites, Jiang Suizhou paused, but shook his head.\"No more sleeping,\" he said.Meng Qianshan hastily responded, took the hangover soup handed to him by a maid nearby and delivered it to Jiang Suizhou's hand.\"Your Highness, have a bowl of soup first,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou answered and picked up the soup.After a few mouthfuls of soup, his spirit indeed cleared and brightened in a few moments, and his vision wasn\u2019t as blurry.He then began to ruminate about Ji You's matter.Ji You was imprisoned because of him, so he must not ignore, but with his pathetic power at present, there weren\u2019t people that he could mobilize and rely on. Pang Shao's spearhead was now pointing directly at Ji You. With his weak forces facing the enemy\u2019s strong ones, it was honestly very challenging.Therefore, he must find every advantage he could use, try to start from the shadows, and attack his opponents by surprise.If that was the case...he might have to utilize the two \"concubines\" in his house.Gu Changyun seemed to be quick witted. Although he was not loyal, Jiang Suizhou had blackmail in his hands; Xu Du had spoken to him frankly and was also raising some dead soldiers for him. If he wanted to attack from the dark, these people might come in handy\u2026Just then, Jiang Suizhou heard the sound of a banging wheelchair.He looked up and saw Huo Wujiu, who had just finished washing up and was coming out of the back room. The hair on his forehead was damp with some water droplets, and when the sun shone, they glistened.Feeling Jiang Suizhou watching him, Huo Wujiu turned his head and frankly locked eyes with him.\"Awake?\" He heard Huo Wujiu ask.That was right...he came back drunk yesterday and couldn\u2019t even recall what he had done, but Huo Wujiu had always been in this room. Presumably, he knew exactly what Jiang Suizhou did yesterday.Jiang Suizhou was a little worried, but still uncertain. He carefully surveyed Huo Wujiu's expression.He shouldn't have said anything that shouldn't be said, right?Perhaps the sun was pleasant today, because when he looked at Huo Wujiu's inscrutable face, he felt that the latter was in a good mood.He probably didn't provoke him yesterday.This time, Jiang Suizhou was relieved. Meng Qianshan waited on Jiang Suizhou as he changed his clothes and robes and removed the smell of alcohol from his body. Then Jiang Suizhou sat down comfortably at the table.Huo Wujiu sat opposite him.The two had been living together for some days and had developed some natural tacit understanding on trivial things. The daylight outside the window was bright, and they had their breakfast without saying a word. In a while, a touch of tranquility and warmth settled in the air.Jiang Suizhou's appetite was not good because of last night\u2019s wine, and he only drank half a bowl of porridge before setting down his chopsticks.Meng Qianshan hurriedly went forward, and while handing him a copper basin for washing hands, he asked, \"Your Highness, will you go to the office or to the study later?\"Jiang Suizhou pondered for a moment and remembered what he had intended to do this morning.The matter should not be delayed.\"Neither,\" he answered, \"Send someone to Gu Changyun's courtyard now and inform him that I will go to his place later. Let him prepare.\"Um...early in the morning?Meng Qianshan cautiously glanced at Jiang Suizhou then at Huo Wujiu. He responded cautiously, and then withdrew.Jiang Suizhou picked up the tea on the table and took a sip.But before that sip of tea entered his mouth, a crips clang echoed. It wasn\u2019t resounding, but it\u2019s abruptness caused Jiang Suizhou's hands to shake with fright.He looked up and saw Huo Wujiu expressionlessly putting down his bowl. Then, he turned the direction of his wheelchair and expressionlessly left on his own....He\u2019s done eating?Jiang Suizhou looked at the bowl Huo Wujiu placed on the table.Huo Wujiu had always had a good appetite, and the rice in his bowl was usually never wasted. But today, he had a large portion of porridge left in his bowl, and the main course on the table was only half eaten.Jiang Suizhou turned his head in surprise and looked at Huo Wujiu, who had entered the bedroom.He thought Huo Wujiu was in a good mood just now. Why did he suddenly look sullen, as if someone had provoked him?----The author has something to say: Jiang Suizhou straight guy three companies: Angry? So what?

    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 44Jiang Suizhou initially wanted to ask Huo Wujiu why he was angry, but when the words reached his mouth, he couldn\u2019t utter them.After all, Huo Wujiu was poker-faced every day. In real terms, no one could tell whether he was happy or angry. What if he wasn\u2019t angry at all when Jiang Suizhou asked? Wouldn\u2019t that be too embarrassing?Thus, Jiang Suizhou gave him a couple of glances, but swallowed the words that wanted to escape from his lips.After eating breakfast and changing clothes, he went straight to Gu Changyun's courtyard.Like every time before, Gu Changyun and Xu Du were waiting in the room together.They were about to get up and salute him when they saw Jiang Suizhou waving his hand and sitting down at the main seat.\"Sit,\" he ordered lightly.The two looked at each other and sat down on the chairs beside him.\"Yesterday, Lord Ji was arrested for embezzlement. You both should have known about this, right?\" Jiang Suizhou said.The two nodded.Next to him, Gu Changyun said with a smile, \"Your Highness, there is no need to worry. This Lord Ji has never stood on our side, and we have persuaded him several times to no avail. Now that Pang Shao has disposed of him, there is no damage to us, so you don't need to take it to heart.\"Jiang Suizhou looked at him and said bluntly, \"I want to save him.\"Gu Changyun was stunned.Then, he smiled and said, \"I\u2019m naturally happy that Your Highness is kind-hearted. It's just that...\"\"Xu Du,\" Jiang Suizhou abruptly interrupted him.Xu Du answered, \"Your Highness.\"Jiang Suizhou looked at Xu Du: \"Did you still not tell him anything?\"Xu Du was taken aback, and then understood what Jiang Suizhou was talking about. Xu Du gently smiled and said, \"Without Your Highness\u2019s order, I don\u2019t dare to speak.\"Jiang Suizhou hummed and said, \"Gu Changyun, now that you are under my command, your grandmother and younger sister will also be kept in the mansion, which is safer.\"Gu Changyun froze, and the smile on his face also gradually disappeared into thin air.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dJiang Suizhou raised his eyes and looked at him.\"I, unlike him, have no intention of detaining your family. But since they are already living in the royal residence, there is no need for them to move out. From now on, if you want to see them, you can just go to that courtyard,\" Jiang Suizhou said.Gu Changyun went rigid for a moment, and gradually, his eyes turned reddish.He had never mentioned it to others, but since his family was threatened and forced into the royal residence by King Jing, he had not been able to see his family again until now.\u201c...Your Highness is kind-hearted and wants to save him, so naturally I will do my best.\u201d A few moments later, Gu Changyun said to Jiang Suizhou with red eyes and a smile.Jiang Suizhou nodded.His two subordinates were smart people. He didn\u2019t have to be too direct. Pointing them to the destination would suffice.The two had guessed that he wasn\u2019t the original owner, and now, Jiang Suizhou had confessed the bargaining chip that the original owner had used to blackmail Gu Changyun, which was a way to show the latter his sincerity: Jiang Suizhou would help him take care of his family, and would not use them as blackmail.After all, Gu Changyun had already entered his house and had become tied to him. At this juncture, there was no turning back for him. Only with this arrangement could he get the best result for himself.Seeing that Gu Changyun understood, Jiang Suizhou said bluntly, \"It's not just my kindness.\"He looked at the two of them.\"Pang Shao now covers the sky with one hand, and if he wants to deal with any minister, he can do so without effort,\" Jiang Suizhou said. \"I thought that if we let him kill Ji You today, he can kill whoever he wants tomorrow. Today, many ministers are waiting for my protection. If I can\u2019t even protect one person, I'm afraid that the others, too, will become dissidents.\"After a pause, he continued.\"Of course, deep inside, I also want to save one and count one. I can't let Pang Shao keep getting what he wants.\"Hearing this from him, Xu Du frowned.\"It is naturally a good thing that Your Highness can think this way,\" he said, \"However... Does Your Highness have a solution at present?\"Gu Changyun followed suit and nodded.\u201cPang Shao\u2019s faction has no shortage of people in the Ministry of Rites. Contriving a fictitious sum of embezzled money and blaming it on Lord Ji is as easy as a pie. However, if we want to exonerate Lord Ji from it, there is still nowhere to start.\"Jiang Suizhou paused. \"It's easy to pin the blame on him, but the whereabouts of the stolen money...should we also check it?\" he asked.Gu Changyun nodded. \"That goes without saying. But according to the Great Jing\u2019s current laws, even if the whereabouts of the embezzled money cannot be traced, the perpetrator must be convicted when he should be convicted.\u201dJiang Suizhou pondered for a moment.Gu Changyun was right. Throughout the ages, there had been countless cases of corruption, of which many people had been convicted in careless search for a lead.So, what advantage did he have as a latecomer?Jiang Suizhou fell silent for a long time, and his two subordinates also looked grave. For a while, no one spoke.After a long time, Xu Du spoke unhurriedly. \u201cNow that the case has reached this point, the only way to save Lord Ji is to find a scapegoat,\" he proposed, \u201cBut...you can no longer frame a good man.\u201dHearing this, Jiang Suizhou's eyes lit up.A scapegoat?He had an epiphany.Of course the court couldn\u2019t trace the whereabouts of the imposed embezzled money. However, what if he could find the money for the court?After all, he studied the history of Jing. Although he couldn\u2019t recite the biographies of the officials in the dynasty backward by heart, he was still clear about what kind of things each of them had done.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By then, the embezzled goods would be retrieved and Ji You would escape the jaws of danger.Jiang Suizhou hastened to speak.\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent solution,\u201d he said.Xu Du was taken aback. \"Does Your Highness already have a candidate in mind?\"His question earned a light smile from Jiang Suizhou.Of course he had. Not only was he a good candidate, but also someone who hit his muzzle.Chen Ti.He curried favor with Pang Shao and indeed dredged up a lot of benefits from his relationship with him. It just so happened that before Jiang Suizhou transmigrated, a colleague happened to have written a paper on corruption at the end of the Jing Dynasty, in which Chen Ti was mentioned. He could even remember clearly that he had purchased several large mansions in Lin'an City.Didn\u2019t he also want to invite Huo Wujiu to appreciate the flowers?Why didn't he also invite the officials of the Ministry of Justice to come appreciate the mansion he purchased?\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou consulted the two and schemed until the afternoon. After their plan was fully laid out and they made sure that there was no flaw, the three took a break and had some food together.During the meal, Xu Du asked curiously, \"How does Your Highness know so much about Chen Ti's family assets?\"Jiang Suizhou smiled faintly.\u201cI have my own way,\u201d Jiang Suizhou answered indifferently.He couldn't tell these two that he came from a thousand years later and also happened to be dedicated to studying them, right?However, Gu Changyun laughed at his reply.\"Do you still have to ask?\" He smiled. \u201cIsn't it all written in the script? People like His Highness...have more or less different abilities from us. Even if you wish to know these, you probably wouldn\u2019t understand.\"Listening to his jest, Jiang Suizhou smiled and knocked his chopsticks on the back of Gu Changyun\u2019s hand.After the three bantered around for a few minutes, Jiang Suizhou paused and said, \"However, I have another matter.\"The two people looked at him.Jiang Suizhou pondered for a moment, and said, \"I want to find a way to cure Huo Wujiu's legs.\"For a time, the two men looked at each other, but neither of them said anything.A few moments later, Xu Du asked, \"Your Majesty...why so?\"Jiang Suizhou slowly said, \"I\u2019m well aware that Pang Shao's roots are deep and the emperor is absurd and dim-witted. What can really bring them down completely is not us, but the Northern Liang.\"Upon hearing this, the two were silent for a moment.Gu Changyun said, \"Although...that\u2019s indeed accurate, have you considered it for yourself?\"Jiang Suizhou looked at him.He heard Gu Changyun add, \"Pang Shao is our enemy, but the Northern Liang is also our enemy. How can you conclude that Huo Wujiu will kill Pang Shao, but not you?\"Hearing his question, Jiang Suizhou was rendered speechless for a moment.He had been thinking about this matter since this morning. He knew that after three years, everything in Southern Jing would disappear because of Huo Wujiu, but he didn't want to really wait these three years in silence and tangle with Pang Shao for three years.He wanted to shorten this time.But, like Gu Changyun said, what guarantee did he have that Huo Wujiu would not kill him?In his innermost being, he firmly believed for some reason that he would. But when he heard Gu Changyun questioning him, he found that the matter of Huo Wujiu killing him sounded quite absurd.Was it because Huo Wujiu had been too amiable toward him during this period?After a long time, Jiang Suizhou spoke up.\"There's still time,\" he said. \"As long as we can cure him, then I can guarantee it.\"He had never gambled or bet before, but what he said at this time was a real bet.His heart even gave birth to a conviction that only a gambler would have at this moment.Jiang Suizhou felt that he would not lose.He quietly surveyed the two people in front of him.After a long silence, Gu Changyun took the lead and sighed.\"Since Your Highness is so sure, then I'll also believe in you,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou nodded slowly.Gu Changyun continued, \"Since we want to cure him, we need to find a famous doctor. However, there is a need to announce a reason for our search for a doctor in the world.\u201dJiang Suizhou agreed.\"I do have a solution,\" Gu Changyun said.Jiang Suizhou nodded his head, signaling for him to go on.Then he heard Gu Changyun say, \"Your Highness is already in poor health, but it can now become an advantage. If word gets out from the mansion, say that because of the incident at the Ministry of Rites, Your Highness was worried. You got drenched yesterday, returned to the mansion after a few hours in the rain, and fell ill. That way, looking for a doctor would be justified.\"This man was indeed quick-witted.Jiang Suizhou nodded, pondered for a moment, and then frowned. \"But, if we want to say so, I will certainly have to get sick. The emperor and Pang Shao are keeping a close eye on me. If I am ill, they will certainly be the first to send people to investigate.\u201dGu Changyun laughed.\"Did Your Highness forget where I came from?\"Jiang Suizhou was taken aback: \"The brothel?\"Gu Changyun nodded.\"I also learned some unorthodox medical prescriptions there. Although they can\u2019t cure people, they can also make people look sick, and ordinary doctors cannot diagnose them.\"Jiang Suizhou was quite amazed.\"Is there such a thing?\" He said, \"Then if you can do so, ensure that everything will be safe. When the doctors in the mansion aren\u2019t able to cure me, the mansion can naturally post a notice seeking a doctor. You two can then sift through them and find the one that can cure Huo Wujiu.\"Gu Changyun nodded.\"However, that being the case...\" he faltered.\"What?\" Jiang Suizhou looked at him.Gu Changyun smiled ambiguously.\"It takes some time to administer the medicine. Moreover, for external prescriptions, you need to soak in a bathtub... In this case, you will have to suffer a bit, Your Highness. You will spend these next two nights in my room.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, the corrupt official must be severely punished.The Emperor didn't care whether the culprit was severely punished or not. If anything, in order to compensate him, his uncle stealthily found him two Yangzhou skinny horses 1 , changed their names and disguised them as noble women, and then stuffed them into his harem.Women who came out of brothels had a charm that women from noble families lacked. Hence, the emperor, who got intoxicated in his pleasure harem 2 recently, felt that since his uncle said the culprit would be severely punished, it must be right. Severe punishment it was.Then, within two days, an even bigger good news reached his ears.His consumptive Fifth Brother suddenly had a high fever and couldn't get up from bed.The emperor was so happy to hear this that he immediately jumped up from his pleasure harem and sent an imperial doctor to King Jing's residence to see if his brother\u2019s illness would kill him.It didn't take long for the imperial doctor to return and report on the completion of his task.\"His Highness King Jing does not have a fever,\" the imperial doctor started.When the imperial doctor came, Pang Shao was accompanying the Emperor to play a trick-taking card game 3 . Upon hearing this, the two\u2019s complexions turned ugly.\"What's wrong with him then?\" Pang Shao put down the cards in his hand and asked in a deep voice.Then they heard the doctor continue, \"Although he\u2019s not feverish, he\u2019s bedridden. I\u2019ve diagnosed His Highness\u2019s pulse, and I believe it is a weakness caused by palpitation and restlessness, plus weakness caused by excessive drinking and the cold.\u201dHearing these words, Pang Shao went into deep thought.The Emperor said discontentedly, \"Then why did he report to me that he\u2019s got a fever? He\u2019s already so sick, yet he still made an effort to deceive me. He\u2019s got the nerve\u2026\u201dBut then, Pang Shao raised his hand: \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\"Uncle?\" The Emperor looked at Pang Shao.Then he saw Pang Shao's pensive face gradually reveal a hint of a smile.\"If I have not guessed wrongly... the secrets in this matter perhaps call more for Your Majesty's rejoicing,\u201d he said.\"Why?\" The emperor was puzzled.Pang Shao replied, \"Does Your Majesty know Ji You?\"The Emperor thought for a long time before he could barely recall the somewhat familiar name: \"Ah, the official who embezzled my money?\"Pang Shao smiled and nodded.\"On the morning when he was detained, King Jing hurriedly went to the Ministry of Punishment's prison and met him in private,\" Pang Shao informed.The Emperor frowned: \"What happened after?\"Pang Shao grinned and looked at him.\"Then, His Highness King Jing braved the rain and got drunk alone. Within two days, he fell ill. Your Majesty, what do you think this 'palpitation and restlessness' of his could be due to?\"After thinking for a long time, traces of surprise gradually surfaced on the Emperor\u2019s face.\"Are you saying that...he must have embezzled as well and is afraid that he will be investigated?\"Pang Shao smiled and nodded, but still he said, \"I am only guessing.\"The Emperor\u2019s eyes almost burst out with excitement.\"Then why don't you go quickly and have someone investigate him?!\" He said, \"As a minister, he actually dared to swindle me. Do you think this can be considered deceiving the king and wanting to rebel?\"The more the Emperor spoke, the more excited he became, as if he could sentence Jiang Suizhou to death on the spot. Speaking of this, he excitedly slammed the card in his hand on the couch and said, \"Uncle, let me investigate this matter, alright?\"Pang Shao looked at him.He knew best how much His Majesty hated his Fifth Royal Brother.In those years, the late emperor did not have an abundance of children, and several of his sons died at a young age. Only the fifth born to the late emperor\u2019s beloved imperial concubine was raised on his knee and cared for in every way, so he didn't suffer at all.On the contrary, although His Majesty was the first son back then, he was transparent in the eyes of the previous emperor and had never received his attention. People in the palace had always been snobbish. They bowed to the high and trampled on the low. When His Majesty was young, Pang Shao knew how much injustice he had suffered and how much he hated his Fifth Royal Brother.Therefore, if he wanted to please His Majesty, there was nothing wrong with making a move on King Jing.However, King Jing was also a descendant of the royal family. Although Pang Shao could torment and insult him, it was not so easy to get him killed. Now, even if the embezzlement case was found on Jiang Suizhou's head, and he was indeed found guilty; even if he was found to be corrupt, he could not be convicted of any capital felony.That being the case, he\u2019d better hand him over to His Majesty and please him with a cricket-fighting pleasure.With that in mind, Pang Shao gently smiled.\"His Majesty, King Jing is noble. I do not dare to overstep my bounds,\" he said.\"Since Your Majesty wants to investigate the case, I will immediately deploy my staff and be at Your Majesty's disposal.\"\u2014\u2014Footnote:1 Thin/Skinny horses - a term from the Yuan Dynasty referring to beautiful girls bought from poor families.

But this time, it seemed much more serious than the previous time. Hence, he was alarmed and on eggshells all day in Anyin Hall but couldn\u2019t pinpoint the cause.Deep inside, he thought he must let His Highness return.However, His Highness stayed at Madam Gu's place for one day, and stayed for a second day immediately afterwards.This was something that had never happened before.On the third day, His Highness would surely return no matter what happened, right?But to his surprise, on the third night, news of His Highness\u2019s illness came from Gu Changyun.Meng Qianshan was so anxious that he promptly rushed to Gu Changyun's courtyard. It never occurred to him that King Jing would bar him from entering.The person who threw him out was Gu Changyun.Gu Changyun was leaning against the door frame and looking quite gorgeous and charming clad in red. Seeing Meng Qianshan being stopped at the door and anxiously pacing in circles, Gu Changyun smiled and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? His Highness only drank too much wine these two days and is somewhat deficient in health. You just have to send the news to the palace and the Ministry of Rites and ask for a few days\u2019 leave for His Highness. As for the rest...just take care of Madam Huo for His Highness.\u201d\"This...\" Meng Qianshan looked in anxiously.Gu Changyun raised his hand and blocked his gaze.\"His Highness has orders not to let you in,\" he said, \"Ah, has it been raining for the past few days? His Highness ordered you to go back quickly, boil dilong extract 4 in An Yin Hall, and burn some fire. Don\u2019t neglect that cripple.\"After speaking, he arrogantly glanced at Meng Qianshan, turned around, and shut the door.In the room, Jiang Suizhou was lying on the bed. His breath was uneven, and his face was a bit white.\u201cHave you given my orders?\u201d he asked.Gu Changyun stood at the edge of the bed and nodded.Jiang Suizhou closed his eyes.He didn't let Meng Qianshan in, purely because he was afraid the latter would talk too much and ask something he shouldn't ask.He initially thought that after these two days, he would go back to Anyin Hall, but never expected that the effect of the medicine would strike so suddenly and fiercely and make it so that he could not get up, let alone return to his own courtyard.Gu Changyun comforted him on the side, \"Don't worry, Your Highness. After the first few days, the effect of this medicine will gradually become milder. By then, the symptoms that manifest will simply be having a weaker constitution due to palpitations.\u201dJiang Suizhou nodded on the bed.\"Tomorrow, when the palace gets the news, they will send someone over,\" he said.Gu Changyun nodded and said, \"Yes. After the imperial doctor from the palace diagnoses you, let him administer medicine. You naturally can not be cured from that, and we can post a notice to seek medical help under that pretext.\"Jiang Suizhou nodded and closed his eyes.Seeing that he wanted to rest, Gu Changyun sensibly retreated to the outer room.However, the atmosphere in Anyin Hall, where boiling of the dilong extract was in full swing, was one of condensation.The servants and maids were busy going in and out, trying to finish the dilong extract for the night and burn some fire to drive away the dampness in the room. The man who was standing beside Huo Wujiu, Meng Qianshan, prudently kept his mouth shut and dared not utter a word.Huo Wujiu was holding a book in his hand, but hesitated to turn the pages.\u201cSpeak if you have anything to say,\u201d he coldly said.Meng Qianshan whispered, \"Madam Gu said in the courtyard...that His Highness is bedridden, so he\u2019s going to rest there.\"Huo Wujiu did not move.A moment later, he asked in a light voice, \"What kind of illness?\"Meng Qianshan lost his tongue for a moment.Huo Wujiu waited for a while but didn't hear him make a sound. A moment later, he raised his eyes, a pair of dark, bottomless eyes, and stared quietly at Meng Qianshan.\"Speak,\" he commanded.Those eyes sent chills down Meng Qianshan\u2019s spine. He trembled all over and hurriedly responded, \"He said that His Highness drank too much wine these two days, and...is deficient in health...So, he got sick.\u201dHuo Wujiu remained motionless. Only his hand, holding the booklet, sharply clenched tight and crumpled the pages of the book.Drank too much and was health deficient?Huo Wujiu gripped the book, and an indescribable irritation flooded his heart.Well done...good on that sickly man.Braving the rain and drinking outside that day weren\u2019t enough. He must go to his concubine's room to drink, and must fool around until he suffers from \"health deficiency\" before stopping.Huo Wujiu never knew that a person could be so hateful.Jiang Suizhou was unlike the emperor and Pang Shao, who were rotten to the core but were still people who could not make him lose his calm.Jiang Suizhou was akin to a cat. He would crawl his way into your heart and sprinkle joy, making you unable to tear your eyes off him, and then he\u2019d do something nasty to provoke you again.They were petty things that people wouldn\u2019t take to heart, but because Jiang Suizhou was the one who did this kind of thing, it inexplicably triggered Huo Wujiu\u2019s bottom line. It stirred up his emotions all at once, making him jittery and anxious.Huo Wujiu's fingers fiercely crushed the pages of the book under them.Meng Qianshan, who was standing next to him, felt uncomfortable. Huo Wujiu\u2019s fingers that crushed the book were like a noose around Meng Qianshan\u2019s neck, causing him to gasp for air.At this moment, even as dumb as he was, Meng Qianshan rough had an idea what the \"Madam\" in front of him was thinking.Huo Wujiu was inwardly seething, or rather, he was jealous.\"...Madam Huo?\" A few moments later, Meng Qianshan strenuously called out in a squeak.Then he saw his master pause and casually toss aside the book that was crumpled and torn.He said, \"Withdraw.\"Meng Qianshan whispered anxiously, \"Are you all right? Please be at ease. His Highness is really weak. When he drinks and gets exposed to the wind, it\u2019s common for him to...\"Huo Wujiu, who was sitting on his wheelchair, interrupted Meng Qianshan with a cold snort.The next moment, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes at Meng Qianshan.\"I'm fine,\" he said. \"I just didn't expect that the rules of your King Jing Mansion could be this bad.\"Meng Qianshan was puzzled.Then he saw this master looking out the window with a cold expression. His voice sounded so deep and cold as if it was squeezed out from his teeth.\u201cThis kind of concubine, who pleases and confuses the master, would have been beheaded if in the Marquis of Dingbei Hou House.\u201d Huo Wujiu said slowly.---The author has something to say: #MadamHuoisjealousFootnote:4 Dilong extract - literally earthworm powder - a medicinal preparation based on abdominal extracts from the earthworm species used in traditional Chinese medicine for a wide variety of disorders, from convulsions and fevers to rheumatoid arthritis and blood stasis syndromesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it wasn\u2019t only because His Highness was missing, but also because he was lodged elsewhere and left a person behind.Although the daily diet and daily life of the person left behind remained as usual, he was exuding a do-not-come-any-closer air from head to toe against any approaching stranger.Because of this, Meng Qianshan was walking on eggshells for several days, fearing that this ancestor would vent his anger on anyone who performed poor service.This lasted until the day Huo Wujiu had to leave the manor.Today was the day Chen Ti\u2019s wife invited Huo Wujiu to enjoy the flowers. Jiang Suizhou had already returned the first invitation, but it was resent because of an imperial decree issued during the emperor\u2019s birthday banquet some time ago.Meng Qianshan didn't dare to forget. Early in the morning, he waited upon Huo Wujiu to wash and change his clothes.Huo Wujiu naturally refused his service. Meng Qianshan could only leave the robes and accessories together and waited in the side for Huo Wujiu to wear them properly.When the time came, a carriage left King Jing's residence and traveled all the way to Chen Ti's residence.The wives of colleagues in the court, especially officials in the same ministry, would often host some banquets in the rear courtyards, inviting each other as an expedient way to socialize.This practice was very common in all dynasties. However, the banquet at Chen Ti's Residence today was definitely different from the past.After all, who among the influential officials in the capital didn\u2019t know about King Jing\u2019s penchant for that kind of food? The Jing Dynasty was also particular about the distance between men and women. The ladies were gathering for tea and snacks, so they couldn\u2019t just invite a man to mingle, right?Ordinary officials wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. Only the wily old fox, Chen Ti, who was used to flattering Pang Shao, knew that if he wanted to please his master, he had to give up his face.His wife, of course, would advance and retreat with him.Chen Li stood in front of the house early in the morning, on pins and needles deep inside.Her husband had already instructed her a few days ago. The purpose of inviting King Jing\u2019s male concubine in their residence as a guest was not to befriend him, but to get him into trouble and have him make a fool out of himself. It was best to cause a stir that would reach His Majesty\u2019s ears.As a lady from an eminent family, Chen Li was raised in the rear courtyard since she was young. Before she married, she had barely even met a few stranger men. Now that she was suddenly asked to invite a man to the house and also to manipulate said man into making a fool of himself in her house, Chen Li momentarily panicked and didn't know what to do.After all was said and done, how else could a man make a spectacle of himself in the rear courtyard? The guests who would come to appreciate the flowers were all wives of officials. Damaging anyone's reputation because of it was something Chen Li didn\u2019t dare to do.Consequently, Chen Ti felt exasperated at her failure to meet his expectations. He chastised her in a fit of anger and asked Qin Liu, his concubine, to step forward with her to host the banquet.This meant entrusting the affairs of King Jing's concubine to Qin Liu.Chen Li was somewhat relieved and led Qin Liu to wait at the door for the guests\u2019 arrival.When the day dawned, the ladies of each family arrived in their carriages one after another. Qin Liu welcomed each of them, while Chen Li directed her maids to wait in front of the door.After a long time, a carriage came around the corner and stopped in front of Chen Ti's house.The carriage\u2019s design was unique to the royal family.Chen Li held her breath, and with a smile on her face, she stepped forward to welcome Huo Wujiu.The young eunuch sitting outside the carriage jumped down from the carriage, commanded the coachman and the servant to open the curtain, and lifted a wheelchair from the carriage.There was a tall man sitting in the wheelchair.Chen Li's gaze only drifted cautiously towards him, with a hasty sweep.She found that although the man\u2019s eyes were downcast and he exuded an indifferent demeanor, he had a very handsome appearance. His sharp and bold eyebrows, angular face, and the sharp edge-like scar across his eyebrow were as incisive as a sharpened sword, making people too scared to take a closer look.It was as if the general she had read from a book in her boudoir had come to life.Chen Li hastily retracted her gaze. She didn\u2019t dare to look any further and only cautiously averted her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re here, Madam Huo. All the ladies have arrived, so please follow me into the house as well, Madam Huo.\"The man in the wheelchair didn't lift his eyes, let alone respond to her.Instead, the eunuch following him diligently responded with a smile, \"Sorry for bothering you, Mrs. Chen.\"Chen Li nodded, and with her maid\u2019s support, she led the way.\u2014\u2014The Chen Residence\u2019s garden was not too big. It had a pond inside, but it wasn\u2019t the lotus blooming season yet. The lively garden was set up with flowering trees and bonsai that were common in Lin'an City everywhere.At this time, a lot of people had gathered in the yard. From a distance, they were dressed in beautiful clothes and hairdos. The crowd of women chattering together pleasantly was even more eye-catching than the flowers and plants.The ladies in the capital knew each other quite well, so when they arrived, they chatted animatedly.Just then, a subtle sound of a wheelchair rang out from the courtyard entrance.For a moment, the crowd stopped, and a brief silence fell over the garden.Several gazes fell on Huo Wujiu, and then moved away instantly as if they hadn't seen him.The ladies in the courtyard also had a score in their hearts.Lord Chen was trying to secure a personal gain. In order to please His Majesty at his birthday banquet, he asked His Majesty to bestow a decree to get the man in the rear courtyard of King Jing\u2019s residence to attend the flower viewing. The man who arrived wasn't just any man, but a captive from Northern Liang; the same man who fought on battlefields and killed people like one killed flies.Men and women were seated separately at banquets, so none of the ladies had ever seen Huo Wujiu. But just from his reputation they heard in previous years, he probably resembled Qin Shubao 1 , the door-god they stuck on doors.But never did they imagine\u2026Some of the close noble ladies exchanged looks with each order while maintaining their composure.General Huo...How could he be so handsome?Footnote:1 Qin Shubao - a general from China's Tang Dynasty that was later deified in Chinese mythology. As legend goes, the emperor asked them to stand guard over his sleep to ward off a ghost that had been troubling him in the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lord Chen most likely didn\u2019t have any good intentions when he requested this man\u2019s presence here. They must hide far away and not get involved, lest they\u2019d be contaminated with filth.With this in mind, everybody averted their eyes and treated Huo Wujiu like air.Unexpectedly, a young lady tugged on the sleeve of her close friend and whispered, \u201cThe heavens is really jealous of a heroic genius 2 like him. It\u2019s God\u2019s will to torture him like this\u2026\u201dHer close friend promptly grabbed her and stopped her from talking nonsense.On the other side, Qin Liu saw that everyone invited had arrived, so she asked all the ladies to take their seats in the garden.She had been in Chen Ti's rear courtyard for almost three years. Although she got into this mess because of the main wife\u2019s cowardice, she still had to find a chance to make an entrance. Today\u2019s event was the opportunity that Lord Chen provided Qin Liu, so wasn\u2019t this her lucky chance? She had to win everybody\u2019s favor at today\u2019s banquet and carry out what Lord Chen wanted her to do well, so that everyone could see who the wise helper of her husband was.Chen Li was faint-hearted and wasn\u2019t as clever as her. Shortly after, Qin Liu shuttled between the ladies, ushering them in various positions and asking them to sit down. She then asked the maids to step forward to serve tea and snacks.After all these were arranged, Qin Liu walked enchantingly in front of Huo Wujiu.\"Good day, Madam Huo.\" She smiled and bowed to Huo Wujiu.As early as just now, Qin Liu had secretly sized up the man in the wheelchair. He had an outstanding appearance, a noble temperament, and was heard to be a deadly warrior. Unfortunately, he was now just a prisoner of war subjected to indignities, and a cripple.Since she wanted to use today\u2019s opportunity to rise in status, then she had no choice but to offend him, and also trample on him.With this in mind, Qin Liu smilingly remarked, neither light nor heavy but genuinely meant to offend, \"I had only heard that you, Madam Huo, are a man of striking appearance. I\u2019ve never expected that seeing you in person once is a hundred times better than hearing it from the mouth of others. Today, you\u2019ve visited our residence. Although we are also considered sisters, there are still differences between men and women regardless. So, I arranged a distant seat for you. Please don't take offense.\u201dOf course, Huo Wujiu ignored her.Meng Qianshan behind him smiled and said, \"Thank you, Concubine.\"Qin Liu covered her lips and smiled, saying that it was no big deal. She guided them to a table by the pond and asked Huo Wujiu to take a seat there.Just then, the maid in charge of pouring tea greeted them.Qin Liu's mind turned a hundred times and already came up with a trick. She naturally reached out and took the teapot from the maid's hand, then smiled and walked over to Huo Wujiu's side and quite naturally poured him tea.She didn\u2019t see, however, that Huo Wujiu, who had his eyes downcast, frowned indistinctly.The next moment, Qin Liu deftly exclaimed and knocked over the tea. The ladies were attracted by this alarming cry and saw that Qin Liu seemed to be embraced by someone. She looked as if she\u2019d been molested and fell straight towards Huo Wujiu.Everyone turned pale.But Huo Wujiu, who was sitting there, frowned tightly. His hand pressed his wheelchair to the side and turned, cleverly avoiding her.Hence, Qin Liu\u2019s initial attempt to pose as a victim of the man's forced embrace instead turned into deliberate leaning toward him, and was unreservedly exposed to the crowd.Immediately after, she leaned into empty air. In her failure to stand firm, she plunged straight down, head first into the pond.\u2014\u2014Shrieks ensued from the crowd of women.The maids jumped into the pond to save Qin Liu, and chaos reigned everywhere. Only Huo Wujiu silently pressed his wheelchair and moved a few steps forward to give the pond an icy glare.That trifling trick was so obvious. He sensed that something was wrong as early as when she leaned towards him.Meng Qianshan beside him was scared silly.Qin Liu was rescued in no time and wrapped up tightly in a robe and blanket. Chen Li rushed forward to have her sent down to rest. However, Qin Liu, who was rescued, struggled and was unwilling to let go.Qin Liu knew that since she started it, she must carry it out to the end. She had just failed her trick and paid the price, so now, she absolutely couldn\u2019t neglect any bit of advantage.The eyes of the crowd fell on her.She cried, \"How could Madam Huo do such a thing? Not only did he despise me, but he also pushed me down the pond!\"Everyone around was well aware that she was framing Huo Wujiu. However, they kept their thoughts to themselves, and no one dared to stand up and expose her.Qin Liu knew that this method had worked, so she performed more and more vigorously.\u201cI have lost my chastity. My Lord, I have no dignity to see you anymore! You guys let go of me. Let me knock my head to death here, then I\u2019ll be clean!\"Chen Li stood by with trepidation.She knew exactly what Qin Liu was thinking. If she made a scene like this today, word would immediately get out, and tomorrow, her husband could use this as an excuse to face His Majesty.She wanted to stop it, but as a married woman, she had to obey her husband's orders.She cautiously glanced at Huo Wujiu.He was sitting upright, expressionless and cold, quietly watching the farce Qin Liu was performing.Like a steel gun that no one could bend.Chen Li had never seen a military officer fighting in a war, but at this time, she somehow felt that an indomitable general should resemble him.It was a pity that the Heavens were jealous of him and left him chin-deep in danger. Under such circumstances, no one naturally could help him\u2026But at this stage, a concierge came running anxiously.\"Madam...Madam!\" The concierge shouted.Chen Li looked behind her and saw the concierge stopping at the garden door, looking frightened and discomfited.\"What's wrong?\" Chen Li asked.The concierge immediately replied, \"King Jing is in the mansion hall!\"---The author has something to say:Jiang Suizhou: I think I am very handsome, I fell from the sky, a hero to save the beauty.

She said, \"His Highness Jingwang is here? His Highness has not notified us in advance. Our residence is full of ladies at the moment, and I have not prepared, not prepared...\"The servant quickly interrupted, \"His Highness Jingwang s-said...\"\"No need to prepare.\"Right at that moment, a clear and chilly voice came from behind him.Everyone hurriedly looked in his direction.He saw a noble young childe, walking slowly to the garden with the support of a manservant.It was clearly a spring day when all sorts of flowers were blooming, but he was wrapped in a snow-white cloak with a circle of white fur at the collar.The man had wide fluttering sleeves and a jade crown. When he approached slowly, he looked like a god descending from the clouds, with a noble and inviolable bearing.But looking at his overly exquisite face, everyone felt that there was a bit of charm in his arrogance, resembling the essence of a white fox.The crowd froze for a moment before they hurriedly got up and bowed to greet him.The man was none other than Jiang Suizhou.Seeing the garden filled with a bevy of women bowing to him, Jiang Suizhou raised his hand, signaling them to rise.He scanned the garden without a trace, and then paused on Qin Liu.Sure enough. He thought to himself.He knew that Chen Ti had gone to great lengths to get Huo Wujiu to come to his manor and would not do nothing. However, he didn't expect that Chen Ti would be so open-minded as to make such a move that would cost him his wife and his troops just for the sake of tormenting Huo Wujiu.He quietly glanced at Huo Wujiu.As he expected, this person still looked aloof from the matter, and did not even glance at Jiang Suizhou when he arrived.But fortunately, seeing that the crying woman was quite far from Huo Wujiu, she must have tried to frame him but failed. The situation was not too bad.Jiang Suizhou took a rough stock of the current situation deep inside. He slowly walked up to Chen Li, stopping at a position three steps away from her.\"I've come without informing you. I'm sorry for disturbing you, Madam Chen,\" he said slowly.Chen Li hurriedly bowed to him and forced a smile: \"What is the Prince saying? Your gracious presence here is a great honor to our humble abode...\"Jiang Suizhou looked around at the garden of Chen's residence.His own house was indeed quite simple and ordinary. It could not be compared with those magnificent love nest manors Chen Ti bought with the money he embezzled.\"Humble abode...\" Jiang Suizhou pointed out with a smile that expressed volumes surfacing on his face.Chen Li inexplicably felt deeply flustered.Then she heard Jiang Suizhou shifting the topic, saying with a gentle smile, \"It\u2019s going too far to say my presence brings light to your humble dwelling. My visit today is merely because I don't trust the man in your residence. I came to check if he's caused trouble again.\"After saying that, his eyes leisurely roamed around the garden and finally landed on Qin Liu.\"Now it seems that I have come at a good time, eh?\"His tone was gentle and sounded quite kind. But for some reason, the hearts of everyone in the courtyard jumped to their throats, and they dared not make the tiniest sound.Qin Liu, who was shivering in her robe, cautiously raised her eyes and looked at Jiang Suizhou.Then she saw His Highness Jingwang, whose beauty transcended mortals, gave Huo Wujiu a cold look and walked straight forward. The young eunuch behind Huo Wujiu seemingly understood what he meant in an instant. He trotted forward and brought him a wooden armchair.His Highness sat unhurriedly on the armchair with his cloak fluttering, graceful and noble.Qin Liu saw that when His Highness was seated on the chair, his eyes fell on her.His cold and haughty eyes bore semblance to standing atop the clouds, looking disdainfully at the mortals in the dust below. Nonetheless, his eyes radiated an inexplicable charm, as if to suck people in. It was akin to a moth flying into the flame, crashing into him.For a spell, Qin Liu stared at him and felt her breathing stop.But at that moment, His Highness Jingwang spoke. \"Tell me about it,\" he said, \"What happened?\"It was only then that Qin Liu woke up as if in a dream and hastily looked at the people around her. But to her surprise, she only stared blankly at His Highness Jingwang for a few breaths, and that Madam Huo, who hadn't spared her a single glance since he entered the garden, was actually looking at her.His eyes were ice-cold, and his brow was furrowed. He was looking down at her, as if looking at something dirty.Qin Liu took a deep breath and tried to calm herself down.Since His Highness Jingwang was here, the development of the situation would definitely change. As for whether the situation would become more serious or quashed depended on Jingwang's attitude.Now it seemed that Jingwang detested Huo Wujiu, so she only needed to add more fuel to the fire to make things worse.She gulped and boldly shook off the maids on either side of her, and greeted Jiang Suizhou, kneeling in front of him.\"Your Highness Jingwang.\" Her eyes welled up with tears, and she choked up as she spoke, \"The matter involves this lady servant's reputation. Although it happened in public, this servant feels disgraced to speak of it!\"After saying that, she couldn't help herself anymore. She lifted her sleeve to wipe her tears. While wiping her tears, she choked with sobs, \"Why don't you just let this servant die? At least, I'll die innocent!\"She knew that men succumbed to this the most.As long as she showed weakness and became the victim, people would become softhearted. A man's heart has always been biased. Once it melted, the man would become increasingly partial. At this juncture, he would believe whatever she said, wouldn't he?While Qin Liu wiped the tears of her effort, Qin Liu didn't forget to peek at Jiang Suizhou.But she saw His Highness Jingwang acting as if he hadn't seen her tears at all. He stretched out a slender, white hand from his cloak, picked the cup of hot tea handed by the eunuch next to him, and drank it slowly.\"Forget it if you don't want to say it.\" he said indifferently.Qin Liu froze.Then His Highness put the tea aside, raised his hand and pointed randomly in the crowd. Next, he named a lady and said unhurriedly, \"My lady, please come and give this Prince an account.\"Qin Liu was completely dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 51She had forgotten that the man in front of her was a man who did not like women. Her drama was clearly performed for the blind.Qin Liu hurriedly turned her head back and saw that Jiang Suizhou was pointing at the wife that the heir of the Duke of An Guo had just married.She had interacted with the woman just now, and from the few words she exchanged with her, she figured that she was a young pampered lady of a rich family. Her husband's family also spoiled her, and she had never suffered any hardship all her life. Her mind was as simple as a blank sheet of paper.Sure enough, hearing that Jingwang named her, the noble heir's wife was dumbstruck. For a moment, she looked between Jingwang and Qin Liu, standing there at a loss.\"Just now...\" she opened her mouth cautiously, not knowing what to say.Then Jingwang gently smiled at her. \"Madam, just tell the truth,\" he coaxed.The lady hesitated for a moment, but still whispered, \"It's nothing. It's just that Concubine Qin didn't stand firm and leaned towards Madam Huo. But Madam Huo dodged, and she fell headfirst into the lake...\"\"Is that so?\" Jingwang then asked.The surrounding ladies exchanged glances, but none of them refuted.Qin Liu's heart dropped to the soles of her feet.She watched as Jingwang smiled lightly and nodded at the lady, and then looked at her.There was a trace of satisfied smile in his seductive fox-like eyes.It was only then that Qin Liu came back to her senses.It seems that Jingwang, who rushed here with overweening arrogance to denounce Huo Wujiu publicly, was simply a false shot.He came today to clean her up for Huo Wujiu.But everything was so logical that she had a hard time saying anything.--On the carriage back to the manor, the only sound was the rolling of the wheels.Jiang Suizhou leaned on the wall of the carriage, his breath still a bit uneven.In fact, he could not get out of bed until today. Chen's residence was not too big, but he didn't even have a palanquin. He had walked all the way to the garden and already couldn't bear it.Fortunately, everything was dealt with flawlessly.He didn't give the woman who did the harm a chance to speak, but pointed to a girl he'd had his eye on for a while. The girl looked young. She was dressed in a gorgeous dress, and her emotions were all written on her face. At first glance, she was a naive lady with a powerful backer, who could not lie.Sure enough, by exposing the concubine's lies, she had also let the main wife dispose of her rightfully on the spot.Although not to the point of killing her, the woman ruined her reputation herself.Because of this farce, he was also able to take Huo Wujiu away in advance. He didn't have to stay there and choke on the rouge powder smell.With this in mind, Jiang Suizhou was in a good mood and asked, \"Are you alright?\"His relationship with Huo Wujiu now was not so stiff. Naturally, he talked a lot with him. As long as he started a conversation, Huo Wujiu would definitely respond to him...But silence answered him.The carriage quieted down again after Jiang Suizhou finished asking. Huo Wujiu next to him seemed to have not heard him, and didn't say a word.Hmm?Jiang Suizhou looked at him in confusion.What's the matter?Huo Wujiu, who was sitting there, turned his head and met his gaze coldly.\"Are you feeling better?\"Instead of answering his question, he asked a rhetorical question, abruptly and at once, confusing Jiang Suizhou.\"What?\" Jiang Suizhou was nonplussed.Huo Wujiu suddenly raised his hand, directly covered his forehead, rough and direct, and messed up the hair in front of his forehead.Jiang Suizhou reflexively dodged to the side, but the space in the carriage was narrow and he was not as strong as Huo Wujiu. Hence, before he could resist, Huo Wujiu pinned Jiang Suizhou down and freely let his rough hand press against his forehead.A few moments later, he retracted his hand.\"What are you doing?\" Jiang Suizhou got up from the carriage, breathing unevenly.Huo Wujiu, who had withdrawn his hand and also withdrawn his gaze along with it, looked ahead. He had a cold expression, looking neither right nor left.\"You're much better,\" he muttered.Jiang Suizhou felt a little amused for a moment and retorted, \"I don\u2019t have a fever. What's the use of touching my forehead?\"Huo Wujiu gave him a sideway glance.Jiang Suizhou was weak because of the drug. At this time, he was solely preoccupied with holding onto the carriage to sit straight. He didn't know that his pale appearance, unstable breathing, and disheveled hair were all captured by Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu paused, opened his mouth, and gruffly spoke. \"Now that you can move, come stay in your own courtyard,\" he said coldly.\"What?\" Jiang Suizhou was taken aback.Although Huo Wujiu was not the same as an ordinary concubine, he was, at best, a prisoner of war detained in Jiang Suizhou\u2019s house. But ...How could Huo Wujiu sound so justified in arranging where he could stay?Huo Wujiu said in a low voice, \"If you die of consumption in your concubine's room, I'll be sent back to the imperial prison.\"After speaking, he turned around and did not look at Jiang Suizhou again.Jiang Suizhou froze and returned to his senses.Whoa! This man actually dared to openly curse him to death!As expected, Huo Wujiu didn't often speak, but once he opened his mouth, he would most likely anger people to death.Jiang Suizhou glared at him with hatred and sat upright in the carriage.I'm not going to die! As long as you don't chop my head off, I'll live a long life!With this thought in mind, he turned his head to look out the window and ignored Huo Wujiu.He failed to see that the hands Huo Wujiu placed on his lap were tightly clenched into fists.It was a man, hastily fending off his raging jealousy.Even Huo Wujiu himself could not have imagined that just one glance, just one glance at Jiang Suizhou's messy and frail appearance was enough to upset him. His eyes burned. He was even irritable to the point of wanting to shoot through the chest of the person who had shared this look with Jiang Suizhou.In the silence, an evil dragon seemed to be awakening in his chest.The evil dragon was greedy and irascible, and his eyes were fixed unwaveringly on a certain treasure.---The author has something to say:Gu Changyun: You may not believe me, but if it weren't for luck, I would have died 800 times over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that he finally got better, he naturally wanted to return to his own place.\u2014\u2014He had to face Huo Wujiu's scowls, though.He also had no idea where he had provoked Huo Wujiu. However, knowing that this man was as capricious as the weather, with an utterly unpredictable temper, he didn't pay him any mind.When he returned to Anyin Hall, he and Huo Wujiu remained in their own space as in the old days, and no one provoked anyone.He also quietly waited for his arrangement with his two staff to take effect.True enough, from the time Jiang Suizhou fell ill, the palace sent imperial doctors. Nonetheless, the imperial doctors only said that his illness was due to weakness and palpitation, and they couldn't cure it. Hence, even after taking bitter medicine for several days, he never got better.Treatments did not work, and gradually, the news that the imperial doctors brought back to the palace became stale.They told the Hou Zhu that His Highness Jingwang's health was deteriorating, and now he could only rest in bed. Perhaps because the illness struck too swiftly and damaged His Highness Jingwang's foundation, his already fragile constitution became even worse.This was something worth celebrating for the Hou Zhu, more than the New Year.Of course, sharing the joy with others was better than enjoying it alone. After knowing this, the Emperor immediately told the imperial doctor that there was no longer a need to treat him. However, he must go to Jingwang's Manor again and inadvertently reveal the matter to His Highness Jingwang. Tell him that his frail self might be running out of time.The Imperial Doctor naturally did as he was told.So, early this morning, when the Imperial Doctor from the palace checked Jiang Suizhou's pulse, he showed a look of swallowing the words on the tip of his tongue back.\"What's wrong?\" Jiang Suizhou saw his feigned serious expression at a glance, leaned on the headboard, and coldly asked.The Imperial Doctor sighed and hesitated for a while. Afterward, Then he sighed again and knelt down in front of Jiang Suizhou.\"Although this servant is reluctant to speak bluntly...\" he sighed, \"Your Highness better stop taking this medicine.\"Jiang Suizhou knew it very well.As expected, this serious doctor still couldn't deal with Gu Changyun's unorthodox methods. The doctor must have found that he couldn't cure him and ran to tell the Hou Zhu. He then got orders from the latter to stop giving him medical treatment in the future.Then, their own recruitment notices for doctors could also be posted out.Even the dead soldiers Xu Du kept on his behalf could act as servants. They could dispatch several of them to seek medical advice in remote places.With this in mind, Jiang Suizhou was deeply at ease, but he still maintained an impatient expression. He frowned and asked, \"Why should I stop it?\"The Imperial Doctor cautiously glanced at him.\"The truth is...\" he stammered, not knowing how to say it.Jiang Suizhou scowled: \"This Prince dislikes hearing nonsense.\"The Imperial Doctor criticized inwardly: I know you don't like to listen to nonsense, but I'm afraid you won\u2019t be able to accept this concise truth.He made up his mind and said cautiously, \"The truth is, Your Highness is seriously ill. Your roots and bones are already damaged, so it's difficult to cure you.\u201dJiang Suizhou was stunned.What? Was Gu Changyun's medicine so good that it had fooled a wily old fox of the Imperial Hospital?He was only focused on the doctor and didn't notice that when Huo Wujiu, who was nearby, heard this, his head snapped up. Huo Wujiu frowned and looked in Jiang Suizhou\u2019s direction.He listened as the Imperial Doctor stammeringly continued, \"Your Highness also...also doesn't need medical treatment. If you have any tonic, bird's nest and ginseng, you can just take them, by all means. Maybe you can...can...\"\"Can what?\" Jiang Suizhou frowned.The Imperial Doctor gulped his saliva and relayed the words the Hou Zhu had told him.\"Your days are numbered.\"Right after his words fell, the room fell into a deathly silence.The Imperial Doctor kowtowed on the floor and did not dare to move.After a long time, he heard Jiang Suizhou's slightly tremulous voice.\"Get lost,\" he ordered.The Imperial Doctor froze and looked up at him dumbly.Then he saw Jiang Suizhou on the bed with a frosty face, towering over him and squeezing out a couple of words between clenched teeth.\"Get out.\"As if given a second life, the Imperial Doctor rolled and crawled as he fled.Soon, the only two people left in the room were Jiang Suizhou and Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu's brows were wrinkled and rigidly tight....What did that Imperial Doctor just say?He stared closely at Jiang Suizhou.He saw Jiang Suizhou, sitting on the bed, raising his hand and rubbing his temples. It was as if he was trying to suppress some emotion. The corners of his mouth were twitching and almost trembling.Just because he stayed at Gu Changyun's place for a few days, he...The hand that Huo Wujiu placed on his knee clenched tightly, and the veins on the back of his hand throbbed.He no longer cared to grumble and ridicule Jiang Suizhou for abandoning himself to sensual pleasures.Now he not only wanted to kill Gu Changyun, but also hated his own disability and uselessness. He could no longer turn the world upside down and find a doctor who could cure Jiang Suizhou for him.He stared fixed at his hand.He suddenly had an urge to initiate contact with Ji Hongcheng, risk finding Lou Yue in advance, blackmail him for his life-saving grace, and kill his bloody way out in advance.--Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just that the Imperial Doctor's performance surprised him too much. He and Gu Changyun originally only wanted to fool him for a while, but never thought it would have such a remarkable effect.It even made people think that his days were numbered?Jiang Suizhou wanted to laugh.He saw Meng Qianshan kneeling in front of him with tears in his eyes. Just as he opened his mouth, he burst into tears.\"Master!\" Sorrow enveloped him.He made Jiang Suizhou tremble in fright. For a spell, he felt that he was no longer a living person, but a piece of memorial tablet placed on the bed.\"Control yourself.\" He frowned.Meng Qianshan wiped his tears in a flurry. However, the more he wiped, the more tears fell, like a bottomless river.\"Master, surely we can find a doctor who can cure you!\" he cried, \"If anything untoward happens to you, I won't live, and I'll serve you underneath...\"\"All right, all right.\"His weeping gave Jiang Suizhou a headache.\"Okay, in a moment, you will go out and look for people to put up notices for me. Afterward, send some troops to the surrounding counties to find a doctor,\" he instructed, \"Anybody with excellent medical expertise, whether they're famous or practice unorthodox methods, must be brought back. Understood?\"Meng Qianshan nodded repeatedly.Jiang Suizhou casually yanked a silk handkerchief and lightly flung it on his face.\"If you understand, go and do it. Don't mourn in front of this Prince,\" he said.Meng Qianshan whimpered and nodded again. He wiped his tears and ran out to do his job.Jiang Suizhou watched his back with some amusement.Although his own 'dying' was fake, Meng Qianshan's reaction...still moved him.He withdrew his gaze and happened to meet Huo Wujiu's eyes out of the corner of his eyes.Jiang Suizhou froze and turned his head to look at Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu frowned and looked straight at him sullenly.With no one else in the room, Jiang Suizhou uttered a snorting laugh heedlessly and curled his lips in a smile: \"Did you also think I am about to die?\"Huo Wujiu frowned and looked him up and down.A few moments later, he said slowly, \"Don't take it to heart. The doctors in the capital have encountered very few difficult cases, so don't dwell on their diagnosis.\"Jiang Suizhou was stunned, and then he seemed to realize that Huo Wujiu had thought he was a little out of sorts from anger.He froze and was about to speak, when he saw Huo Wujiu approach him with his wheelchair pressed. He said indifferently, \"You'll eventually be cured.\"Jiang Suizhou was momentarily stunned.Whether it was his illusion or not, he heard a clear affirmation from Huo Wujiu's mouth, as if he was promising him something.At present, he was obviously just a captive...Jiang Suizhou did not know how Huo Wujiu had already contrived plans in this very short period.He had shifted all the early and step-by-step plans he had in mind forward, and changed a safe and smooth road into a thorny shortcut.And all this was to break free from his cage in advance, to step into the blood mud of all those enemies who bullied and humiliated him, and guide his sword toward the Jing Dynasty. While at it...while at it, he would search all over the world and find someone who could save this dim-witted and invalid Jingwang....It was just in passing.Jiang Suizhou was totally in the dark about this, but he somehow felt the firmness in his tone.He was momentarily stunned, then spoke steadily, saying words that made him feel a little out of bounds himself.\"Of course, I'll be fine,\" he echoed.\"...I can heal you too, do you believe it?\"--After that day, Jiang Suizhou recuperated in his residence with peace of mind.He looked too content, and within two days, Huo Wujiu noticed the signs. He didn't resemble a terminally ill patient, but rather like a hunter who was waiting for his prey to fall into the trap.And why exactly was he doing this?Huo Wujiu would always remember the words he said to him that day.Jiang Suizhou said he would heal him, and he asked him whether he believed it or not.Huo Wujiu couldn't possibly not grasp what he meant. But, for the first time, he, who had always been bold, did not dare to delve deeper.How could someone harm himself in order to seek medical treatment for him?The notion was like a little animal that broke loose and rampaged its way to his heart. He was so flustered that he hurriedly shut the little thing back to its cage and randomly found a corner to tuck it in.This was the very first time in his life that he had done such a cowardly deed.Jingwang Manor was sedate and peaceful, but in the Ministry of Rites, there was turmoil and chaos of war in recent days with everyone feeling imperilled.The Ministry of Justice thoroughly investigated Ji You, but only found that he embezzled and could not find the whereabouts of the money. So, in accordance with the court's practice, officials of the Ministry of Justice dropped in and questioned all the officials up and down the Ministry of Rites who had contact with the matters of the Emperor's birthday banquet.Few people, who held office at court, were spotless. Moreover, His Majesty was in charge of investigating the case, so no one dared to neglect it.Those innocent bystanders also had some calculations. They must hide under such thorough scrutiny for fear of being caught in the crossfire.Jingwang Manor wasn't spared either.After scouting all the way down, an official finally went up to the door of the Jingwang Manor.Everyone in the court knew that Jingwang was unwell these days and had been recuperating in his house. There were also rumors abounding that His Highness Jingwang was seriously sick this time and might be to the point of death.Naturally, the official did not dare to touch Jingwang's bad luck. When he arrived at the residence, he conducted a routine inquiry, and then left.After all, His Highness Jingwang was not short of money, so why would he be greedy for more? Even if he embezzled this four or five thousand taels, His Majesty would never blame him for the sake of brotherly love.The official just wanted to go through the motions.Unexpectedly, as soon as he left King Jing's Anyin Hall and passed by the garden of the manor, he heard a restrained voice from an elevated lane. The voice with a trace of exasperation reached his ears.\"Can you blame me for this? Isn't it because the Prince has bought a house outside and raised a younger one? I don't even know where the Prince got the money to build a 'golden house' for that little fox!\"The official from the Ministry of Justice paused and looked in that direction.In the corner of the garden, a beautiful gentleman in red was standing in the corner with arms akimbo, ranting in a whisper to the maid at his side.-----The author has something to say:Jiang Suizhou: Speaking of this good wife, we have to look at our Chang Kyun...Huo Wujiu rocked his wheelchair and moved out gloomily.Jiang Suizhou: Why are you leaving?Huo Wujiu: To kill the dog Emperor and be your good wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing that he was heading straight in his direction, the Ministry of Justice official immediately sought the cover of a nearby tree and hid his figure.The next moment, the maid hastily pulled the red-robed gentleman back.\"Master, you can't go!\" She hurriedly said. \"The Prince is sick. If you go now, what are we going to do if the Prince's health worsens from irritation?!\"The red-robed gentleman laughed furiously.\"Piss him off? I don't think so. Since he has the energy to fool around with vixens outside, I think he's in good health,\" he countered.The maid said, \"Why do you say that, Master? Besides, the courtyard where that gentleman outside lives might not have been bought by the Prince.\"The red-clad gentleman laughed grimly.\"The Prince redeemed him, so where can he get the money to buy a house? Moreover, the mansion in the center of Changle Square faces the south. Without a few thousand taels of silver, can he afford it?\"The maid was rendered speechless.The red-robed gentleman seemed to be getting more and more angry as he spoke, and his voice rose a few decibels.\"The manor's money has always been under my control. Say, there is no turnover in the house, so where did the Prince get so much silver to buy a mansion for that little vixen? Today, I must go to the Prince and ask about it. Otherwise, I might as well tell him to sell me quickly. It is better than suffering from this kind of confusion here...\"The maid hastened to stop him. They played tug of war and went straight into Anyin Hall.A long time later, the Ministry of Justice official slowly came out of the dark.He was so shocked that his hands shook.He absolutely did not expect that a routine investigation, which was just a formality, would let him run into such a big secret.So was the silver embezzled by His Highness Jingwang? He broke the law and embezzled His Majesty's birthday banquet funds because the concubine in his residence was violent. He embezzled the money to keep a mistress outside?The official was not qualified to make decisions. In his shock, he just knew that he had to rush back to the palace without delay and inform His Majesty of this major discovery.--Inside Anyin Hall, there was a pleasant radiance of spring.When Meng Qianshan saw Gu Changyun leading a maid straight into the courtyard, he was startled as he hurriedly welcomed him. Meng Qianshan wanted to stop Gu Changyun but didn't dare to.Although Madam Gu was usually domineering, Meng Qianshan had never seen him visit His Highness' courtyard to meet him before.Seeing how dumbfounded he was, Gu Changyun raised his eyebrows and smiled at him: \"What? Meng Qianshan, are you so happy to see this Madam that you can no longer speak?\"Meng Qianshan forced a smile on his face and greeted him.\"Madam Gu, has something good happened today? Unfortunately, His Highness has just gone to rest. If you need anything, it'll be better for this servant to let His Highness know on your behalf...\"He kept apace with Gu Changyun, putting in a good word while attempting to stop him.Gu Changyun frowned. He glanced at Meng Qianshan and pushed him away, then went straight to Jiang Suizhou's main room.\"Still trying to deceive me? Do you think I didn't see that someone just happened to come out from here?\"As he spoke, he walked up the stone steps and pushed the door to Jiang Suizhou's room.Hearing the creak of the door, Jiang Suizhou glanced sideways in that direction. He saw a bright red figure making a beeline to his room.Jiang Suizhou heaved a sigh of relief.He knew that Gu Changyun had come to report to him after the deed was done.Gu Changyun met his gaze, and while walking in, he cast an amorous wink at him.Jiang Suizhou felt so sour his teeth almost fell out.He glanced at Gu Changyun and was about to withdraw his gaze when he saw the man smile and greet him at the side of his bed.\"This concubine came here unannounced. Your Highness won't blame me, will you?\" he smiled.Jiang Suizhou looked at him indifferently and let him continue his act.After bowing, Gu Changyun stood up and sat at the edge of his bed.\"Your Highness, please don't blame me. It's really because I haven't seen Your Highness for several days and was worried, so I took the liberty to come and visit you,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou said indifferently, \"Is it done?\"Gu Changyun knew what he was asking about.He smiled and bumped his shoulder against him: \"Your Highness, do you still not trust me?\"After speaking, he swept his gaze across the bedroom, paused on Huo Wujiu who was in the corner, and retracted his subsequent words.After all, there was someone else in the room. If he wanted to say more, he had to exercise restraint to some extent.Following Gu Changyun's gaze, Jiang Suizhou also saw Huo Wujiu, who was sitting there without saying a word.This was usually how they coexisted in the room during the day. His bedroom was extremely spacious, and each of them were on either side of the room, not disturbing the other.But at the moment, Jiang Suizhou felt that Huo Wujiu's body looked somewhat misshapen.Where exactly was he misshapen...he couldn't put his finger on.Gu Changyun, who was sitting beside his bed, turned around and reverted to his innate habit of teasing again.He laughed: \"Yo, this concubine's eyes are blind. How didn't I notice that Madam Huo is also here?\"Jiang Suizhou watched as Gu Changyun stood up from his bedside and went towards Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu lifted his head and looked at Gu Changyun.Huo Wujiu\u2019s gaze was heavy, and the cold emotions in it were hidden deep in the swirls of his eyes.Gu Changyun was oblivious to it and stood still in front of him.\"It must be exhausting for you, Younger Brother, to serve the Prince everyday,\" he said smilingly.Huo Wujiu didn't say a word.But in the next moment, Gu Changyun extended his hand.Then he grasped the book in Huo Wujiu's hand.\"Ah, what book is Madam Huo reading?\" Gu Changyun smilingly asked while trying to pull that book out of Huo Wujiu's hand.Once, twice.The book didn't budge at all.Gu Changyun blinked and looked at Huo Wujiu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After retracting his hand, he subconsciously placed his hands behind his back.For a moment, Gu Changyun had an inexplicable suspicion.He felt that if Jiang Suizhou was not watching from behind them, the man in front of him would have snapped his neck.He embodied a ferocious beast ready to strike, and the only thing that confined him was Jiang Suizhou's eyes behind him.For the first time, Gu Changyun acutely realized that he had played with and touched someone he shouldn't have.He stood frozen in place for a moment, motionless.Just then, Jiang Suizhou's cold voice rang.\"This Prince is fine. If there's nothing else, go back,\" he said indifferently.Only then did Gu Changyun gradually regain his strength. He felt a layer of cold sweat on his back.He was about to take a step back when he heard a soft snap.He looked up and saw that the book was tossed lightly on the side table. The person sitting in front of him lowered his eyes, pressed the wheelchair with one hand, turned a bit, and headed straight out.It was only when the sound of the wheelchair faded away that Gu Changyun managed to withdraw his gaze.Then he saw Jiang Suizhou, who was sitting on the bed, looking at him disapprovingly.\"Do you have nothing better to do than to provoke him?\" Jiang Suizhou lowered his voice and asked.Gu Changyun returned to the bed and sat down, his expression a bit pensive.Jiang Suizhou was far away and did not see the lightning bolt eye-contact held between them just now. But Gu Changyun sat down slowly beside his bed, his eyes a little empty.Jiang Suizhou raised his finger and pointed at him.\"I won't be responsible for saving you if you provoke him.\" Jiang Suizhou gnashed his teeth.But Gu Changyun shook his head.\"I feel that Huo Wujiu wasn't angered by this servant.\" Gu Changyun muttered.Jiang Suizhou frowned: \"What?\"Gu Changyun raised his eyes and looked straight at him.\"It's not like that,\" he said, \"Madam Huo is not so small-minded. I usually provoke him a few times, but as long as I don't touch him, he treats me as if I'm non-existent.\"Jiang Suizhou glanced at him.Gu Changyun looked back at him and suddenly chuckled a couple of times.\"Today, however, he's...\" he paused.\"He's like jealous of me.\"Jiang Suizhou was stunned.The next moment, he raised his hand without mercy and landed a smack on Gu Changyun's head.\"You're crazy,\" he said.--That day after, some doctors gradually visited Jiang Suizhou's residence one after another.Whatever skills the doctors had, Jiang Suizhou needn't investigate; everything was handed over to Gu Changyun. Gu Changyun drove some of those who were not talented and were looking for fame and fortune out of the house early on, and he also contrived some excuses to send the ones who were inept at treating disabilities and injuries out.For a few days, Jiang Suizhou met several people one after another. After testing them, they didn't have any dependable skills.He also knew that the doctors around Lin'an who had some actual skill all ran to the Imperial Hospital. To find an excellent doctor, he needed to wait a little longer and see the results of the people he dispatched to the field to investigate.Little by little, the flowers and trees outside the window gradually withered and turned into lush green leaves.Every two days, Gu Changyun would report the results of the search for doctors to Jiang Suizhou. In the past few days, his reports gradually turned more into complaints. He said that there was a doctor who sent himself to the door, claiming to be the living Hua Tuo and saying that he could eliminate all diseases, like a charlatan.Just look at the tall and strong apprentice who resembled a hired thug behind him, and one would think he was unreliable.But this man seemed to have some deceptive skills. Gu Changyun wanted to expose his lies, but after several days, he couldn't find any flaws in him. He merely listened to the man's hype and also his insistence on seeing his master.Gu Changyun told Jiang Suizhou that he couldn't stand it, so he asked him to meet him. It would also be better if he could drive this charlatan away quickly, so that he could return to quiet. Jiang Suizhou's interest was piqued. He wanted to see with his own eyes what this charlatan looked like.So, he agreed. The next morning, someone brought the doctor over to Jiang Suizhou\u2019s room.He was an old man in his sixties with gray hair.Because of Gu Changyun's news in advance, Jiang Suizhou's eyes couldn't help wandering around behind the old man.Then he saw the disciple behind him. He was in his twenties. He was tall and broad-shouldered. He looked powerful. His facial features were sharp and hard. He didn't have the making of a medical apprentice, but rather a soldier.Jiang Suizhou felt inwardly amused, so he took another look.The two kneeled down in front of him and bowed. Jiang Suizhou casually waved his hand to let them get up and asked lightly.\"I heard Changyun say that you have the ability to eliminate all diseases. Is that right?\" He lazily lifted his tea and said indifferently, \"You should be aware, this Prince hates being cheated.\"After saying that, he glanced at those two. His gaze swept and actually found that the apprentice behind that old doctor looked backwards, seemingly looking at Huo Wujiu.Jiang Suizhou frowned: \"What are you looking at?\"The disciple hastily withdrew his gaze and lowered his head, as if he was suddenly reprimanded and frightened.But Jiang Suizhou's frown deepened.In that moment when the apprentice quickly withdrew his gaze and lowered his head, Jiang Suizhou seemed to have caught a glimmer of tears in his eyes.He had the appearance of a person trying to hold back tears, his eyes reddening from the restraint.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This boy was originally a farmer. He fled from the north some years ago and came here. I saved his life, so he followed me.\"The old man glanced at his apprentice and said, \"He's from the countryside. He hasn't seen anything in the world, so I hope Your Highness won't blame him.\"Jiang Suizhou chuckled lightly but did not speak again.A moment later, the doctor withdrew his hand that was taking the pulse and knelt down respectfully in front of Jiang Suizhou.\"Speak.\" Jiang Suizhou lifted his hand and accepted the hot tea that Meng Qianshan handed.The doctor replied, \"I have diagnosed Your Highness's pulse and have some humble opinions, but...\" he paused and then said, \"Your Highness needs to dismiss the crowd.\"Jiang Suizhou glanced at him with downcast eyes: \"Why? What must be said in private?\"The doctor answered unhurriedly, \"Although Your Highness's pulse is weak, your pulse is weak and unstable on the surface. It appears that there are possible causes other than contracting an illness.\"At this point, he cautiously stopped talking and raised his eyes to Jiang Suizhou, quietly waiting for the latter\u2019s next instructions.His gaze was calm and penetrating, which stunned Jiang Suizhou.Jiang Suizhou immediately understood that this old doctor had seen the fishy origin of his illness.His heart skipped a beat; his gaze was a bit flustered, and for the first time, he looked toward Huo Wujiu.He did not expect that this doctor, who was seemingly a charlatan, actually had a few tricks up his sleeve.Fortunately, Huo Wujiu sat there quietly, reading a book with his eyes cast down, and was seemingly oblivious to their exchange. Jiang Suizhou assumed he did not hear the hints in the doctor's statement.Presently, his room was full of people. In addition to the silly Meng Qianshan, there were many maids and servants. The matter of him poisoning himself was a private discussion between him and Gu Changyun, and no one else knew about it. Of course, it was inappropriate to make it public for more people to hear.He pondered for a moment and lightly ordered, \"All of you, go out.\"Meng Qianshan was stunned. \"Your Highness?\"Jiang Suizhou's eyes traveled between the old doctor and his disciple, and he said lightly, \"Since this old gentleman wants to talk to me in private, let me talk to him. You lead this gentleman's disciple to the side room, and let him drink a cup of tea for now.\"Meng Qianshan immediately replied, dismissed the servants, and bowed to invite the doctor's disciple out.Then he realized that Huo Wujiu was still left in the room.Meng Qianshan hesitated for a moment.Er...Madam Huo had stayed in his master's room day after day and now although his master wanted to dismiss everyone, he wasn't sure if his Madam was considered among the people to dismiss.He promptly looked askance at Jiang Suizhou.However, before he could make a move, Huo Wujiu, in the corner, put the book aside, pressed his wheelchair and rolled out in silence.Meng Qianshan sighed with relief.This master, whom the Prince placed on the tip of his heart, was one he couldn't provoke. But fortunately, although this master was aloof, he was very conscientious, leaving him, a servant, with a lot of room to perform his duties.--According to Jiang Suizhou's instructions, Meng Qianshan led the doctor's disciple all the way to the side tea room and asked him to take a seat for the time being.Madam Huo was also 'kicked out' with the rest, so Meng Qianshan naturally couldn't leave him alone. As soon as Meng Qianshan went out, he diligently invited Madam Huo to the tea room and poured a cup of tea for both of them.After pouring the tea, Meng Qianshan hung his hands and stood by his side.Huo Wujiu's gaze swept over the man sitting in a restrained manner at the other end of the tea table, then raised his eyes to look at Meng Qianshan.This kid's face had always been unable to hide anything. He'd better fool him.Although he was waiting here at the moment, he couldn't hide his anxiety. At first glance, he was worried about Jiang Suizhou's situation in the room. He wanted to go and stand guard, but because he received no order, he had to endure it here.Huo Wujiu spoke gently, \"Go and do what you ought to do.\"Meng Qianshan was taken aback, and snapped a glance at him.Madam Huo, who was sitting there quietly, put down the tea cup without lifting his eyes and said, \"You're not needed here.\"Meng Qianshan felt as if he was granted an amnesty.When he heard the doctor, who appeared skilled at seeing patients, express his opinion, his heart was already hanging by a thread. He just wanted to stand guard at the door and wait for the Prince to call him. But the Prince drove him out together with the others. He had to take care of his other master, too, so he naturally didn't dare to leave easily.But it was different now. His master had spoken!Meng Qianshan was aware that in the absence of the Prince, nothing definitely could go wrong in obeying this master. He just assumed that this master must have considered him too much of an eyesore. When he hurriedly exited, he still didn't forget to be grateful and thanked Madam Huo repeatedly.However, Madam Huo didn't spare him a glance.Huo Wujiu looked down at the tea on the table, and out of the corner of his eye, he quietly watched Meng Qianshan exit from the tea room and thoughtfully close the door after him.The sound of footsteps drifted away.Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and looked at the man sitting across the tea table.He did not say anything and only fixed a pair of dark eyes at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I deserve to die!\"His voice was lowered with great effort, and as he knelt down, two beads of hot tears suddenly slipped from his eyes and dripped to the floor.Huo Wujiu slowly closed his eyes.\"You're still alive?\" His tone sounded calm, but his voice trembled slightly.The man in front of him was Wei Kai, his lieutenant, who had been following him since he was at Yangguan.This time, Wei Kai's troops were the first batch of advance troops to follow him across the river. When he was ambushed, and the reinforcements were cut off, the army split up, and Wei Kai brought up the rear for him. Since then, Huo Wujiu never heard from him again.He never dared to hope that this person was still alive, and he never thought that he would see him alive in front of him one day.Huo Wujiu looked calm, but his hand on the wheelchair tightly gripped the wooden armrest.Wei Kai kneeled on the ground and wept, \"This subordinate is still alive, but I'm ashamed to face you again, General!\"Huo Wujiu took a deep breath: \"Get up and talk.\"Wei Kai wiped a handful of tears and got up from the ground. He stood three steps away from Huo Wujiu, and then sobbed while attempting to step forward to face him.Huo Wujiu slowly instructed, \"Sit back down and wipe your tears clean.\"Wei Kai had no choice but to stiffly move back.He sat down at his original position at the tea table and wiped his eyes a few times before he could stop his tears.Huo Wujiu lowered his eyes, unmovingly suppressing the heat that had risen in his eyes.Perhaps it was because he had been detained in an enemy country for too long. He seemed to have been cut off from his original years with shining spears and armoured horses. He was born in the sands as a child, and soldiers and weapons were his hands and feet. He'd been steeling himself for revenge and quietly biding his time, but never thought that there would still be some strength left from the wounds of his severed limbs.It was the feeling of something that belonged to him, slowly returning to its place.This feeling could have driven people to tears, but Huo Wujiu had never been accustomed to shedding tears, let alone showing even a hint of fragility in front of people.He lowered his eyes for a moment, and when he raised them again, there was only composure and calmness left in his eyes.He asked, \"How many people are left?\"Wei Kai swallowed the choke in his throat and whispered, \"There are less than 20 men left. At that time, the battlefield was chaotic. Southern Jing's military forces only cared about catching you and bringing you back to receive rewards, so a few of my men hid among the piles of corpses and saved themselves. In recent days, I have thought of some ways to sneak our men into Lin'an City. Now, although we are few in number, we can be at your disposal at any time, General.\"Huo Wujiu gave a muffled grunt.Wei Kai continued, \"After we entered the city, we tried every means to inquire about you. We learned that you were detained in the palace, and then heard no more news afterward. Until a few days ago... General, I have just learned that this Jingwang humiliated you... \"At this point, Wei Kai choked up again, unable to speak.When Huo Wujiu raised his eyes at him, he saw Wei Kai, covering his face with one hand. He was about to start crying again, looking as if he had suffered some unprecedented shame and humiliation.They had known each other from childhood. When Wei Kai was seriously injured, with broken arms and legs, he just gritted his teeth and carried on. He never saw him shed a tear. It was only until today that Huo Wujiu realized for the first time that his subordinate was also a man made of water.He was somewhat speechless and said without mercy, \"Control yourself.\"Wei Kai gave a stifled sob in response.Huo Wujiu sighed slowly.\"I wasn't insulted in any way. Don't have to take it to heart,\" he said.\"But General, your leg...\"\"Didn't you bring someone here?\" Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and glanced at him.Wei Kai nodded repeatedly.\"I found this man outside Lin'an City. He is a highly skilled doctor, especially in treating injuries. He can heal withered bones and connect meridians. General, don't worry, he will definitely be able to cure you!\"Huo Wujiu responded with a hum. After a pause, he drawled awkwardly, \"If Jingwang hadn't asked for medical treatment this time, you wouldn't have sneaked in so easily.\"Wei Kai nodded repeatedly once more.\"After I found this doctor, I have been trying to find you at Jingwang Manor. But since the Jingwang Manor is heavily guarded and surrounded by people sent from the palace to monitor you, it's been impossible to find a chance.\"Speaking of this, Wei Kai seemed to have determined a very important realization. He pressed one hand on the edge of the table, raised his eyes to Huo Wujiu and said firmly.\"General, it's considered this dog Jingwang's mistake that has allowed me a chance to save you. Grandpa Huo has taught me since I was young to know how to repay kindness. After this matter is completed, I will remember his grace today and leave his corpse intact!\"He looked firmly at Huo Wujiu, just waiting for a compliment from his unsmiling general, who had always been clear in his rewards and punishments.However, he found that Huo Wujiu's face, which was already expressionless, gradually became colder and colder.Wei Kai was at a loss for words.Then he heard Huo Wujiu's words that were slowly squeezed out from the gap between his lips.\"I haven't seen you for months, but you're now better at deciding everything by yourself,\" he said.Facing the ice-blade-like eyes of his own General, Wei Kai had a rough thought in mind.He didn't do anything wrong that could cause such hatred from the General. It must be that Jingwang did something behind his General's back and tormented him to death!Wei Kai clenched his teeth and compromised.\"Alright...if leaving his corpse intact isn't okay, then we can cut him to pieces, too. This subordinate is the best at it. Don't worry, General!\"The author has something to say: Real steel, straight man Wei Kai muttered in confusion: Why is the General getting more and more angry?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was indeed poisoned some days ago. I just don't know if you have a cure for it.\"The doctor pondered for a long time and said, \"Although Your Highness is poisoned, the poison is very strange. It's floating on the surface and messing with Your Highness's pulse, but not hurting your body. During this period, you only need to recuperate and wait for the effects of the medicine to subside. Just...\"He paused and raised his head to look at Jiang Suizhou.\"Your Highness has been weak since childhood, right?\" he asked.Jiang Suizhou nodded: \"Indeed.\"The old doctor frowned and said thoughtfully, \"Although Your Highness's weakness is seemingly congenital, honestly... it's a bit like it's caused by drugs.\"Jiang Suizhou was stunned.\"You mean...?\"The old doctor nodded.\"For the specifics, I still need to prepare some medicine for Your Highness. After taking the medicine, only then can we know where the crux of Your Highness' physical weakness lies,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou was rendered momentarily speechless.He really did not expect that the original owner's so-called congenital weakness was also tampered with. But on further consideration, the mother of the original owner was favored by the previous Emperor at that time, and her beauty was unparalleled. It was only right to assume that a tall tree attracted the wind 1 and incurred the jealousy of others.So, since it was not congenital, was there a cure for his weakness?Jiang Suizhou didn't want to be this weak for the rest of his life, coughing after taking only two steps.He was surprised for a moment, and only after a while did he find his voice and ask, \"If you say so, Doctor, is there a cure for my illness?\"The old man shook his head and replied, \"I am only thirty percent sure.\"This was promising for Jiang Suizhou.He wasn't at all affronted, and so he said, \"Thirty percent is fine. From today onward, you can stay in Jingwang Manor with peace of mind and just treat my illness. If there is anything you need, just ask.\"The old man bowed and thanked him for his favor.Then he heard Jiang Suizhou pause and asked, \"Do you have any other specialties?\"The old man was stunned and asked, \"What is Your Highness asking about...?\"Jiang Suizhou cleared his throat; his expression indifferent; and his tone calm and waveless.\"There is a cripple in my room, as you have seen,\" he said indifferently.The old doctor lowered his head in response.Jiang Suizhou frowned, and then said: \"This man is just crippled. Every cloudy and rainy day these days, his legs will hurt. It's really annoying to hear him toss and turn in the middle of the night. Doctor, please examine his legs. If you can find a way to relieve him some, it'll save him from disturbing my rest.\"The old man, kneeling on the ground, obviously froze.Jiang Suizhou only thought he was surprised because he wanted to let him heal a prisoner of war. He pondered for a moment and said unhurriedly, \"Heal him, by all means. I love peace and quiet. If you can cure him of his disease, your reward will be indispensable.\"After saying that, he lowered his eyes and looked at the old man.The old doctor, kneeling on the ground, kowtowed: \"I'll be at Your Highness's disposal.\"--After the consultation, it was the first time in a while that the doctor was given a place to stay.Knowing that this doctor was quite capable, Meng Qianshan naturally treated them both as guests. When the consultation was finished and Jiang Suizhou asked him to make arrangements, Meng Qianshan generously invited the two guests into a spacious courtyard, and also assigned a few maids to wait on them.This treatment gave off the impression that they were distinguished guests.After arranging the courtyard, Meng Qianshan didn't forget to ask someone to prepare all the daily needs of the two. It wasn't until it was late in the day that he smilingly bade farewell.The old man led his disciple into the room.The moment the door was closed, Wei Kai turned around and hurriedly asked what had happened between the old man and Jiang Suizhou in the room.The old doctor sat down at the table, poured himself a cup of tea, and told Wei Kai one by one what he had talked to Jiang Suizhou just now.\"So Jingwang was really drugged?\" Wei Kai couldn't help but ask.The old doctor nodded.\"Someone had drugged him from the time he was born. Otherwise, how can any child who has been pampered and born from his mother's womb in good health fall ill with such an unexplainable disease?\" he said, stroking his beard.\"However...it's a bit fishy that he was drugged this time.\"\"How so?\" Wei Kai asked urgently.The old doctor pondered for a moment and shook his head.His mysterious reaction made Wei Kai anxious, and he said angrily, \"Li Changning, don\u2019t beat around the bush!\"The doctor named Li Changning snorted when he heard his words, and replied, \"Can't I speculate? Who knows who inflicted such painless poison on him?\"His remarks rendered Wei Kai speechless.Then Li Changning said, \"But...it seems so coincidental.\"\"What?\" Wei Kai did not understand.\"Jingwang isn't seriously ill, but he asked for medical treatment. We had no way to find the General, but we were able to take this opportunity to get close to him,\" Li Changning said slowly, \"Just now, Jingwang specifically mentioned that the General\u2019s leg injury always flares up, and asked me to examine the General's legs in the next couple of days. Say, how can everything be so coincidental that it all turned out to be beneficial for the General?\"Upon hearing this, Wei Kai fell into deep thought.\"It is indeed too coincidental...\" he echoed, \"And just now, the General was also a bit strange.\"\"What?\" Li Changning asked.Wei Kai looked at him with doubts all over his face.\"Just now, when I told the General that Jingwang had been kind to us, so I would leave his body intact later on, the General was a little upset,\" he said. \"I also said that I would tear him to pieces, and the General's eyes seemed to have turned even more frightening.\"Speaking of this, Wei Kai paused and hissed.\"Then...the General also asked me whether you can cure the Prince's illness.\"He looked at Li Changning.\"You say, what exactly does the General want, ah?\"Li Changning showed disdain.\"Why are you asking me when you're the one who has been with the General for so many years?\" he said, \"I've only met him for the first time today, yet you expect me to guess what's in his mind?\"Wei Kai frowned and shook his head.\"If I must guess, it would be that the General wants to cure him and then torment him to death with his own hands.\" he said. \"And then, later on, he'll chop his corpse and hang it on their Southern Jing's walls.\"\"But ...\"His words took a turn.\"Why do I feel, again, that it's not quite like that?\"--Footnote:1 a person in a high position is liable to be attackedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 59It was nighttime at Anyin Hall.Jiang Suizhou was in a festive mood, and many things worthy of happiness were emerging.The arrival of a doctor, who had excellent medical skills and was even expected to cure Huo Wujiu's legs, was already worth celebrating. And just now, Xu Du sent him news that the Hou Zhu took the bait.The Ministry of Justice official returned to the palace that day and reported the news he heard at Jingwang Manor to the Hou Zhu at the first opportunity. The Hou Zhu must have been very excited after knowing this. Within a few days, he appointed the same official to lead the troops and seize the manor in Changle Square.In the middle of Changle Square, facing the south; the information he gave to Hou Zhu was detailed enough.Xu Du had arranged for people to monitor Changle Square, and in the past few days, there were already several informants from the Ministry of Justice stepping in there. Presumably, when they have completely determined their target, it would be time for the real owner of the manor to be arrested.Jiang Suizhou felt refreshed.He went to the study, and when he came back, he saw Huo Wujiu sitting on the edge of his couch, reading a book.Thinking of the rather reliable doctor who had come to the house, Jiang Suizhou sat on the edge of the bed, and his gaze couldn't help but fall on Huo Wujiu's body.He didn't know how skilled the doctor was, but could he perhaps heal Huo Wujiu's legs in advance? As long as his meridians could be restored to before, then neither the Jingwang Manor nor the Southern Jing could confine him.If that were true, then the Southern Jing would be finished in less than three years. What Hou Zhu? What Pang Shao? None of them could flaunt their power around him anymore.Jiang Suizhou could not help but feel a little happy.However, when he thought about it, by then, he would not have the opportunity to spend time with Huo Wujiu as he was doing now.Although he was afraid of Huo Wujiu from the beginning, Huo Wujiu was really a good man. During this period, although they had little communication, they coexisted peacefully. Even now, with only one look in his eyes, he could roughly guess what Huo Wujiu was thinking.Thinking of this, Jiang Suizhou felt a little empty inside for a while.After all, in addition to his servants, Huo Wujiu was the only person who had the closest relationship with him for so long after transmigrating into this era.Nonetheless, when all was said and done, a golden cage couldn't hold a falcon forever, and Huo Wujiu originally didn't belong to this place either...Jiang Suizhou was lost in thought for a moment, and did not notice that the person he was watching raised his dark eyes as soon as he felt his sight and met his gaze straight up.The sudden stare scared Jiang Suizhou into a shiver.He realized that Huo Wujiu had, at some point, raised his eyes from the book in his hands and was looking at him quietly.Jiang Suizhou felt a momentary embarrassment.But he immediately calmed down and looked lightly at Huo Wujiu. He said, \"The doctor who came today will take a look at your leg injury tomorrow.\"Huo Wujiu did not make a sound for a while.Jiang Suizhou continued, \"However, you should not expect too much. The doctors in the palace can't cure you, so he doesn't necessarily have the ability either.\"After speaking, he withdrew his gaze and was about to lie back on the bed.But at that moment, Huo Wujiu suddenly opened his mouth to speak.\"My legs were crippled under His Majesty's orders,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou was given a start: \"What?\"He looked at Huo Wujiu and saw that Huo Wujiu was staring at him silently.\"His intention was for me to suffer a fate worse than death in your place, and you know it,\" Huo Wujiu said.This was something that the two of them had never said outright, but was a fact that they both tacitly knew.Jiang Suizhou sat up straight and said, \"So what?\"Huo Wujiu slowly let out a breath, seemingly somewhat helpless.\"After my legs are cured, have you ever thought about how to explain it to him?\" he asked.Jiang Suizhou inwardly laughed.Explain? What would I explain to a dead man? You, Huo Wujiu, are the butcher's knife hanging over his head. I have shifted dropping your knife down at an earlier date to get this incapable ruler killed; that is to give an explanation to the people of today.With this in mind, a smile also surfaced on his face.\"I won't explain.\" The corner of his lips curled, and under the dark and gloomy light, he radiated a rippling brilliance. \"I would like to see how he will deal with me.\"After saying that, he faintly glanced at Huo Wujiu and lay back on the bed.Jiang Suizhou felt that his eyes were full of the wisdom of someone from the future who knew the spoilers.It never occurred to him that Huo Wujiu, sitting in a wheelchair, wouldn't return to his senses for a while because of the look in his eyes.It took a long while before he lowered his eyes.Perhaps the lights in the room were too bright. He thought.Otherwise, how could it illuminate those eyes of that silly rabbit, who was courting his own ruin, so brightly?----The author has something to say:Jiang Suizhou: I'm so crazy, oh.Huo Wujiu: He loves me so muchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just asked him to prescribe his medicine daily according to his diagnosis, and then observe the aftereffect.Li Changning naturally did as he was told.And on the first day of dispensing medicine to Jiang Suizhou, Jiang Suizhou retained him.\"Go check his legs,\" Jiang Suizhou, who had received the decocted soup, said to Li Changning.There was no one else in the room except for Meng Qianshan. Li Changning contemplated his stern voice and then saw Wei Kai secretly winking at him.As early as yesterday, when he first consulted with Jingwang, he mentioned his 'Madam Huo's' leg problems. Yesterday, Wei Kai and he also discussed this matter in private.When he met his eyes, Li Changning understood. After bowing towards Jiang Suizhou, he moved toward Huo Wujiu's couch.Meng Qianshan served Jiang Suizhou. He drank the soup and then waited for Li Changning to examine Huo Wujiu.He watched as Li Changning kneeled in front of Huo Wujiu, fiddling and examining him up and down. He asked Huo Wujiu a few questions from time to time, and then retrieved a booklet from his medical kit. He wrote some notes and drew pictures on it.After a long time, Li Changning packed up his things and stood up.\"How is it?\" Jiang Suizhou hurriedly asked.Li Changning gathered up the medical kit by his side and handed it over to Wei Kai. He got up and turned to Jiang Suizhou, bowing. His tone was tinged with a bit of hesitation when he spoke, \"Madam's leg problems...I'm afraid it's difficult to heal.\"Jiang Suizhou's brow wrinkled, and his complexion gradually turned heavy.Then he heard Li Changning sigh and continue, \"The meridians in Madam's legs are damaged, and I'm afraid it will be difficult to heal them. With all my life's work, I can only relieve him of one or two ailments.\"Hearing these words, Jiang Suizhou asked, \"How are you going to relieve them?\"Li Changning replied, \"I know the art of acupuncture and moxibustion, so I can help Madam to relieve his pain. That way, when it's cloudy and rainy, he will suffer less.\"Jiang Suizhou heaved a sigh of relief deep inside.He knew that Huo Wujiu's legs would unlikely be cured, but he also placed a lot of hope on the doctor in front of him. It was just a pity that the doctor he sought early wasn't the person he really wanted to find.He could only comfort himself inwardly.Forget it, didn't this doctor say that he could relieve Huo Wujiu's illness? This wasn\u2019t entirely useless. After all, every time it rained, Huo Wujiu's legs hurt badly. It was good to alleviate his symptoms a bit.With this thought in mind, Jiang Suizhou nodded. His expression remained indifferent, and he said impassively, \"It doesn't matter. I also have no intention to cure him. Since this is the case, feel free to give him medical treatment. Whatever the results, I won't pursue it.\"Hearing these words, Li Changning seemed to be relieved and bowed to thank him.Jiang Suizhou waved his hand to let him get up. The words that came out of his mouth carried a bitter taste, but deep inside he was palpitating. Did the doctor say just now that he could give Huo Wujiu acupuncture?Since needles would be used, a more spacious place was, of course, needed, for him to perform the procedure freely. Although the couch in the room wasn't narrow, there was no reason for the doctor to treat Huo Wujiu on it every day.In that case...Jiang Suizhou held his cup of tea and pondered over it.Could he take this opportunity to have Huo Wujiu move out?--When Huo Wujiu first moved into his mansion, Jiang Suizhou let him stay in his room temporarily because he couldn't find an excuse otherwise.However, this time, a legitimate excuse was handed to him.Jiang Suizhou began to seriously think about the feasibility of this matter.After all, he initially got Huo Wujiu to his side, all in order to protect him on his own turf. Now that Huo Wujiu had gotten used to living here and became more familiar with him, it would be perfectly reasonable and safe if he took this opportunity to arrange another residence for Huo Wujiu in his manor.In passing, he could also have a little showdown with Huo Wujiu to try his luck and sound him out.Thus, Jiang Suizhou made up his mind and dismissed all the people who were waiting for him during the evening meal that day.Beneath the glowing candle flames, Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and looked at Jiang Suizhou.Jiang Suizhou's stance told him that he had something to tell him.Huo Wuguo thought to himself, Just in time.He also had something to say to Jiang Suizhou.Just listening to what the old man said to Jiang Suizhou today, he knew that those two people had reservations about Jiang Suizhou today.Huo Wujiu knew that Wei Kai would never do anything that he wasn't sure of. The doctor he brought with him would never fail to cure his leg.The two of them said this, all to guard against Jiang Suizhou, fearing that when they could cure his legs, he would take precautions against them. Similarly, the old doctor must have been able to cure Jiang Suizhou's illness, but was fishing for his words. He was 80% sure he was waiting for his orders.However, they didn't know that Jiang Suizhou had never been a threat to them.Even yesterday, Jiang Suizhou directly told him he would cure his leg, and even was prepared to confront Jiang Shunheng on his behalf after curing him.Huo Wujiu could no longer hold himself back.He wanted to tell Jiang Suizhou that the doctor could definitely cure him and also himself.He also wanted to tell Jiang Suizhou that he didn't have to be afraid. Jiang Shunheng, whether to him or to Jiang Suizhou, would always be a threatening enemy. Once he had recovered the strength to contend with him, he wouldn't let Jiang Suizhou be caught in the crossfire.In contrast, he would protect him well.Huo Wujiu had always been cautious and meticulous. In the past, he would never let people in the rival camp find out the tiniest bit of the actual situation.But for some reason, Jiang Suizhou was different.Perhaps becaused Jiang Shunheng picked on him, so even if he was in the enemy camp, he would never be in cahoots with them; or perhaps it was because this person was very simple. Although Jiang Suizhou insisted that he was a bad person, he was devoid of the least bit of lethality and was worthy of trust.Or perhaps...it was because he seemed to, well, really like him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This Jingwang took the liberty of liking him and sacrificed so much for him, making him unable to bear deceiving him. He even wanted to entrust all his unsavory background to him.Not just because Huo Wujiu trusted him, but more because he didn't want to hide it from him.This \"not wanting to hide from him\" thought had been poking around in Huo Wujiu's heart since yesterday when Jiang Suizhou told him that he would let the doctor treat his legs.It was a spark of fire that flared up in Huo Wujiu's heart, scorching his heart to a frightening degree.He had hidden that tongue of flame in the depths of his heart, and at this time, only a pair of extremely well-disguised black eyes quietly looked at Jiang Suizhou.When there was no longer a third person in the room, Jiang Suizhou deliberated before speaking.\"You have heard the doctor's diagnosis today,\" he said indifferently.Huo Wujiu responded with a hum.He paused and was about to speak, but heard Jiang Suizhou continue.\"Although he can't cure you, it's more or less a two-way street of hope,\" he said, \"Anyway, since acupuncture and moxibustion are required, this Prince thought it would be more convenient for you to live in another place.\"A gust of wind seemed to blow by, puffing the tongue of flame burning in Huo Wujiu's heart into a flicker.He faltered and again answered with a hum.\"Indeed,\" he said.Jiang Suizhou nodded his head.\"This Prince has asked Meng Qianshan to arrange a room for you in the courtyard, so you can just stay there and get well at ease. When this Prince told the doctor to heal you at will, it was nothing more than covering up the scene. If he really dares not to do his best, you just tell Meng Qianshan,\" he said.Oh, he would still live in his courtyard, ah.The fleeting gust of wind dissipated without a trace.Huo Wujiu looked indifferent and said, \"En.\"Jiang Suizhou assessed his expression and tentatively opened his mouth next.\"I never told you before why I moved you to Anyin Hall, right?\" he said.Jiang Suizhou knew that it was most appropriate to say these words at this time.Had he told Huo Wujiu from day one that he wanted to treat him kindly, Huo Wujiu wouldn't have believed him, and instead became more wary of him. If he also didn't say it now, they'd be meeting less afterward and have no way to talk about it. It'd be painstaking to talk to him next time.At this moment, telling Huo Wujiu that he wanted to help him and cooperate with him was the most appropriate opportunity. After all, his recent circumstances and good deeds were all visible to Huo Wujiu.But then he faltered when he saw Huo Wujiu's unpleasant expression, which looked as if he had beat someone up.After a moment, he raised his eyes to him with his brow furrowed and softly said, \"No.\"Jiang Suizhou was about to speak when he heard Huo Wujiu then say, \"...Don't say anything.\"How can this work! Jiang Suizhou was anxious.I must tell you clearly, ah! If I don't, how can you know my good intentions? How can you see how I swallowed humiliation? How can you be grateful to me, ah?!He hurriedly said, \"I have to say it. Since things have reached this point, I think you've understood a thing or two of what I want to do.\"Huo Wujiu's brow furrowed even deeper.What exactly did this Jing Wang want to do?Is he going to use today to express his feelings to me?For some reason, Huo Wujiu felt a little flustered and couldn't even think of a countermeasure for a while. But strangely enough, that spark of fire that he hid blazed even hotter, as if oil was poured on it.This made Huo Wujiu's heart beat faster.How could this Jingwang be so stupid? Wasn't he afraid of being rejected and losing face? This in turn made Huo Wujiu's heart soft. He even felt that, no matter what he said, he couldn't say no...But then, he heard Jingwang speak.\"My royal brother humiliated you and wanted to use the method of raising Gu to make me fight you. Naturally, I don't want to give him what he wants.\"That clear and fresh voice sounded like a mountain spring, cool, calm and gentle.\"I moved you to the Prince's courtyard to protect your integrity. Although I am a man of the Southern Jing, I am regarded as a thorn in the eye and a thorn in the flesh by my royal brother, and he wishes he could get rid of me right away. Although I can drag out my ignoble existence here, I also know that I will be killed sooner or later.\u201d\"As far as I am concerned, wiping out the Jing Dynasty is my way out. General Huo, these days, I think you've seen that I'm different from them. I have no intention of killing or humiliating you, but want to cooperate with you.\"That cool and refreshing voice akin to a mountain stream flowed into Huo Wujiu's heart.For a moment he only felt empty in his heart.He only heard Jingwang slowly say, \"I can keep you safe for the time being, and I can help you heal your legs in the future. All I'm asking for is a way to survive, nothing more.\"\"Zzz,\" came a sound.The spring water suddenly dripped over Huo Wujiu's limbs and bones, gently flowed through his heart, and then suddenly extinguished that raging fire.Huo Wujiu's voice sounded a bit muffled.\"...Nothing else?\" he asked.The next thing he knew, he met a puzzled pair of clean and unadulterated eyes.\"Nothing else, ah.\"----------------The author has something to say.Jiang Suizhou: What's that sound?Huo Wujiu [expressionless]: The sound of a young man's heart breaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, flickers of happiness arose within.Could it be? He knew that Huo Wujiu would be suspicious of him and would never believe that he was just trying to save his life from the Hou Zhu.It was true that he did not want to save his life under the Hou Zhu. After all, although the Hou Zhu tormented him, he would not torment him to death.What he wanted was to retrieve his head from being under Huo Wujiu's butcher's knife.This made no difference to Huo Wujiu whatsoever.Luckily, I said it at this moment. Jiang Suizhou thought to himself.Looking at Huo Wujiu's deepening frown, Jiang Suizhou was convinced that it must be because he could not trust him yet. That meant Huo Wujiu still doubted what he had said.This was as it should be. After all, for Huo Wujiu, he was in the rival camp. It would have been strange if Huo Wujiu believed him immediately after he said so.With that in mind, Jiang Suizhou composed himself seriously and said, \"This Prince knows that you may not believe my words. When all is said and done, it sounds somewhat absurd to you. But...\"Huo Wujiu, however, suddenly interrupted him.\"I believe you.\" His voice was smooth, but seemed colder than usual.Jiang Suizhou was stunned: \"This Prince is saying...\"Huo Wujiu raised his eyes to look at him and said, \"Cooperate. What you were going to say is for us to cooperate, right?\"Jiang Suizhou nodded: \"Yes, but...\"But, why was there something indescribably strange when the words came out of Huo Wujiu's mouth?Huo Wujiu looked at him with deep eyes and then said in a slow voice, \"You're trying your best to protect me. I can see that, although I don't know why you have such confidence in me. If there really is a day like you said, I would never return kindness with ingratitude.\"Jiang Suizhou listened blankly.Huo Wujiu's remarks were reasonable, which was not only in line with his open and aboveboard personality, but also the attitude Jiang Suizhou had always wanted to win.But...Jiang Suizhou felt a lingering abnormality deep inside, but he couldn't put a finger on it. Huo Wujiu's remarks obviously were positive, but when they came out of his mouth, he felt a kind of unspeakable pent-up frustration. It even carried a trace of a piercingly cold chill.Jiang Suizhou was in a daze when he saw Huo Wujiu glance at him lightly and asked, \"Are you relieved?\"Jiang Suizhou nodded woodenly.Huo Wujiu gave him an unfathomable glance, then put down the chopsticks in his hand. He placed one hand on his wheelchair, turned directions, and moved straight away.Jiang Suizhou came back to his senses only a few moments later.He picked up the cup of tea on the table and took a sip thoughtfully.He didn't doubt that Huo Wujiu would go back on his word, but...After contemplating for a moment, he shook his head.Maybe people like him who conquered the sands and fought in wars are so cold and fierce when they make promises to others?\u2014\u2014Huo Wujiu didn't regain his senses all night.Absurd?Indeed, he was a Prince of an enemy country, and although his situation wasn't favorable, he was still pampered. His life was at least safe. It was indeed quite absurd that such a person would say such things as placing his hopes on an enemy general and even cooperating with a crippled prisoner of war....But even more ridiculous was, didn't he believe him, too?Huo Wujiu only felt that he was smitten by some spirit. His mind was obviously perfectly normal, but it was like he was struck with a stifling blow on matters related to Jingwang. He felt wooly-headed without rhyme or reason.Now it seemed that what Jiang Suizhou said to the eunuch was nothing but a prevarication, and shielding him, as he had claimed, was also to prevent Jiang Shunheng from getting what he desired. He had nothing to rely on in this land, and it was only right to put his hopes on him.But he himself was confused and believed in that nonsense that couldn't stand up to scrutiny.Huo Wujiu barely slept throughout the night. As soon as the day dawned, he immediately moved to the wing room that Meng Qianshan had arranged for him.He knew that he should feel humiliated.But the emotions that permeated his heart seemed not quite similar to humiliation.Something surged up from the pit of his stomach and soaked the meridians in his chest till it numbed, like being densely pricked by a row of small needles. Although it didn't hurt much, it made him uncomfortable all over.Before this, he hadn't yet experienced what it meant to be 'aggrieved'.The Anyin Hall courtyard was so large that it was easy to find a comfortable and spacious room. Coupled with Meng Qianshan's attentiveness, it only took one night to arrange a vacant room on the east wing, facing the sun.The room was nearly as big as the main house, and the light was especially bright. It was the best room for sunbathing among the wing rooms.When Meng Qianshan prepared the room, he, more or less, wanted to please Madam Huo.But Madam Huo didn't look the least bit happy.The ancestor still had a cold face, and even the aura around him seemed a bit more intimidating than usual. Although Meng Qianshan did not know the reason, he still knew how to discern expressions, so after sending the ancestor over, he hurriedly retreated with the others.The sun gradually rose, and Li Changning took Wei Kai to Anyin Hall.It would take a few days for the herbs he prepared to have a noticeable effect. After taking Jiang Suizhou's pulse, Li Changning adjusted several of the medicines he used, then handed the prescription to Meng Qianshan and asked him to concoct the medicine for Jiang Suizhou.After performing all these, a maid led the two of them to the room where Huo Wujiu was staying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When only the three of them were left in the room, Li Changning carried his medical kit over and walked to Huo Wujiu's side.\"General Huo,\" he bowed and saluted Huo Wujiu.Huo Wujiu put down the book in his hand and raised his eyes to look at the two of them.\"General, Doctor Li has come to check your injuries!\" Next to him, Wei Kai pushed the wheelchair beside the bed for Huo Wujiu with a smile.\"General, you still don't know, right? Yesterday, Doctor Li's words were used to fool Jingwang! Yesterday, he checked your injuries and knew with certainty that he could cure you of this kind of disability caused by sharp weapons!\"Huo Wujiu glanced at him lightly.Wei Kai immediately understood what he meant and scratched the back of his head, laughing, \"I know, My Lord must have guessed it a long time ago.\"Just then, Huo Wujiu suddenly asked, \"What about Jingwang's illness?\"Both men in the room were taken aback.For a moment, Wei Kai and Li Changning looked at each other.They both knew in their hearts that treating Jingwang was just a pretense, just a way to penetrate the Jingwang Manor.Why did the General ask this?After a short silence, the two of them met Huo Wujiu's dark eyes.\"Can he be cured, perhaps?\" he asked.Li Changning replied, \"General, Jingwang's weakness was caused by a drug that was administered since childhood. It's impossible to cure it immediately, but as long as the right herbs are used and slowly regulated, we should be able to extract the root of his disease in about three to five years.\"Huo Wujiu lowered his eyes and no longer spoke.Li Changning glanced at him, and then at Wei Kai, and was momentarily at a loss deep inside.\"Then...Do you want me to cure him or not, General?\"Huo Wujiu hesitated, but when he raised his eyes again, his gaze was tinged with shades of cold intent.Did he want it? What did he have to think about? He and Jingwang were now only in a 'cooperative' relationship. He just needed to protect him in the future. Who drugged him, or what illness he contracted was none of his business, right?With this in mind, he spoke coldly.\"What has it got to do with my intentions?\" he questioned.Li Changning was left even more clueless.Then he heard Huo Wujiu say, \"Since you came to his house to treat him, shouldn't you be thinking about how to cure him? Could it be that you're waiting for him to take vengeance on you?\"Li Changning's heart shivered.Sure enough. He knew that Jingwang was not a good stubble.Nonetheless, why did the General's words sound like...like he wanted Jingwang to be cured?Li Changning couldn't figure it out, so he could only follow Huo Wujiu's orders: \"I understand! I will do my best to cure Jingwang!\"Wei Kai's eyes were about to pop out, and he itched to kick Li Changning.Didn't you hear how much the General hated Jingwang? How dare you say that you want to cure him? What a thickhead!But then he heard Huo Wujiu anwer with a hum.\"Don't tell him,\" he added.Li Changning answered evenly.Wei Kai was dumbfounded: \"General, why is this?\"Huo Wujiu's lips moved, but he swallowed back the words that were on his lips.He said so, naturally considering that the fewer people who knew about it, the better. After all, it would take a long time for Jiang Suizhou's body to heal, so Jiang Shunheng wouldn't notice it for a while. However, the moment he caught the least bit of wind of it, Jiang Shunheng would definitely try every means to stop it.But...Why was he considering so much for Jingwang?!Waves of irritation surged inexplicably deep in Huo Wujiu's heart.After a pause, he said coldly, \"As a bargaining chip. It will be useful in the future.\"The two faces in front of him showed the look, That explains it. They thought that the General was superior in strategy. His foresight was truly beyond the reach of subordinates like them.Only Huo Wujiu himself knew how chaotic his heart was.Jingwang had none of those messy intentions towards him and only wanted to cooperate with him. This should have been an uncomplicated and worth celebrating matter for him. He was a little upset at first, and he thought it was just because he was confused like that silly eunuch, Meng Qianshan.However, this feeling, which should have been forgotten in the blink of an eye, actually intensified with the passage of time.Huo Wujiu couldn't figure out why he felt like he had lost something important.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou woke up early in the morning and found that a person was missing from his room.Huo Wujiu was gone.Meng Qianshan told him that Madam Huo had woken up and had moved out early \u00a0when he learned that his room was tidied up.Jiang Suizhou felt that he should be relieved.After all, as an adult, who didn't want to have their own personal space? The torment of being forced to eat and live with Huo Wujiu for so long finally came to an end today.Huo Wujiu moved out, and before he left, they also cleared things up between them. Huo Wujiu promised him that he would no longer have to worry about being killed by Huo Wujiu himself, so for him, it should be a good day all in the same day.However, he somehow felt that something was missing.It might be because as soon as he transmigrated, he was forced to live with Huo Wujiu. At the same time, Huo Wujiu was too quiet and disciplined, and didn't add any trouble to him.Because of this, when the person disappeared abruptly, he felt that the room was a little empty, as if something was missing.This feeling haunted Jiang Suizhou's heart. He didn't notice it, but he unconsciously ate a lot less for breakfast.But Meng Qianshan, who was waiting by his side, took everything in with a sharp eye.When Jiang Suizhou drank his medicine and sat on the edge of the bed to read a book absently, Meng Qianshan came to his side and said with a smile, \"Your Highness, you have nothing to do today anyway. The day is perfect outside, so why don't you go out to catch some rays, and while at it, go to the wing room to see how that doctor is treating Madam Huo's legs?\"----------------------------------------------The author has something to say:Li Changning: I have this lingering feeling that the General is speaking sourly.Wei Kai: ? You know nothing! That's the General mapping out a strategy. It's called being unfathomable. It's called being cold and ruthless!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn't help but be stunned, and he put down the book in his hand.He had made it clear to Huo Wujiu, and Huo Wujiu had promised to shelter him in the future, so there was no need for him to either brush up his presence in front of him or inquire about his well-being.But...Jiang Suizhou hesitated and was about to refuse, but his eyes involuntarily drifted to the couch beside the bed.The couch had already been tidied up, smoothed out without a single wrinkle, and the beddings resting on it had also been put away.It looked too neat, as if something was missing.Jiang Suizhou's gaze stopped in that direction and suddenly felt that his bedroom was particularly large, so large that it felt a bit empty.He remained silent for a moment, making Meng Qianshan who stood next to him show a look of surprise.Look-look! His Highness is missing his wife!He was pleased with his excellent proposal. Grinning ear to ear, he didn't wait for Jiang Suizhou's next instructions. He turned around and found a robe for Jiang Suizhou to wear outside. Meng Qianshan handed it to him, intending to wait for him to put it on.Jiang Suizhou's eyes fell on Meng Qianshan's hands.For a moment, he secretly persuaded himself inwardly.Forget it. Isn't it just going to Huo Wujiu's place to check him out? This is my own territory. I can go wherever I want to go. There is no need to be overcautious and indecisive.With this in mind, he stood up and put on the outer robe that Meng Qianshan handed to him.Somehow, it might have been that the material of the robe was really comfortable on his body, because after putting it on, his mood that was cloudy and empty all morning seemed to have receded a lot in an instant.Jiang Suizhou looked out the window.I really ought to bask in the sun outside. He thought to himself.\u2014\u2014Li Changning took out the acupuncture instruments in his medical kit. He asked Huo Wujiu to lie down on the bed; then, he rolled up Huo Wujiu\u2019s trousers for him, exposing his unhealed legs.Huo Wujiu's legs had recovered quite well, but his epidermal scars still looked appalling. With just one glance, Wei Kai's eyes turned red, and he averted his gaze to the side with difficulty.Li Changning examined him and said, \"General, the injuries on your legs have not yet healed, so they should be easier to treat. If they were delayed for a year or a half, I'm afraid that even if they were cured, the root cause will remain.\"Huo Wujiu didn't make a sound.He knew that for him, this was what he owed Jingwang.If Jingwang had not pretended to be ill and given Li Changning and Wei Kai the opportunity to enter the manor, it would have been even harder for them to meet. Even if Li Changning was capable of curing him, it would have been nowhere in sight and definitely not as effective as it was right now.His father had taught him long ago never to owe others unless it was a last resort. The more you owe, the more entanglements you would have in the future, and the more you would have no command over yourself.It was inadvisable to owe someone a favor.Huo Wujiu closed his eyes.But what he owed Jingwang now was already much less than he had thought. For him, this kind of favor could be easily repaid in the future. On the contrary, the unrequited love he once thought was the most indefined thing...He should be glad, but he couldn't pep himself up.It felt like there were a bunch of threads that bound him and sent his mind in a whirl. When it was suddenly withdrawn and gave him too much freedom, he didn't feel relaxed, but instead, somehow felt forsaken.This kind of fluttering mood ruffled his feathers.Li Changning continued speaking beside his bed, \"It's just that you will suffer a lot if you want your leg injuries to heal. From now on, I will apply acupuncture and medicine to you every day, General. The needles are to unblock the meridians and blood vessels, and the medicine is to reshape the broken meridians.\"After a pause, Li Changning then said, \"General, the stabbing pain of restoring your meridians is entirely different from the skin and flesh injuries around. The degree of pain is no different from scraping your bones. I've reconsidered it time and time again and plan to reduce the dosage by half. Although the speed will be slower, you, more or less, won't be so tortured...\"But Huo Wujiu interrupted him with his words.\"No need,\" he said.Li Changning was stunned.Then, he hurriedly explained, \"General, the severe pain of reshaping meridians is very different from the abrasions around them. The pain level is no different from scraping bones. Even if the General has flesh and bones of steel, a person would take his own life to avoid suffering like this every day!\"But Huo Wujiu asked, \"If you use normal medicine, how long would it take to heal them?\"Li Changning said, \"Less than 20 days, more than a month.\"Huo Wujiu asked, \"What about halving it?\"Li Changning answered, \"It takes about three months. But rest assured, General...\"Huo Wujiu spoke out and interrupted him.\"That won't do,\" he raised his eyes to Li Changning and rejected.\"We don't have that much spare time to spend here,\" he said. \"Just heal me normally. No need to cut it in half.\"Li Changning was a little puzzled.Er...Although the Jingwang Manor wasn't a conducive place, it seemed to be calm and quiet nowadays.Why was the General in a hurry?He took a peek at Huo Wujiu again, but he saw that the latter had already closed his eyes and started to recuperate.Li Changning could only obey. He turned around to sort out his silver needles.He failed to notice that Huo Wujiu's left hand, which was hidden in his sleeves, was tightly clenched with some irritability.He naturally had nothing urgent to do.The Southern Jing wouldn't kill him for a while. The Northern Liang had just established a court and the treasury was empty. There were no outstanding generals except him, and nobody had the ability to save him in a short time.But he just wanted to return Jingwang's favor quickly.He only thought that he was now distracted, all because he had some debts and involvement with Jingwang. He believed that when these were paid off, he, Huo Wujiu, would still be the same Huo Wujiu, and wouldn't be tied up by an irrelevant person every day. It rankled him to no end, making him always wanting to kill someone.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wei Kai was guarding the small clay stove, watching the medicine for Li Changning.He fanned the fire with a fan, and glanced at the bed from time to time, watching as silver needles were gradually inserted into his General's legs, one by one, faintly glowing in the daylight.He felt a bit creeped out, looking at them from a distance.What would it feel like to have so many needles stuck in your body? The mere imagination of these things greeting his body made Wei Kai's spine tingle.However, he had always had a blind confidence in his General, as if believing in a God.From the time he had followed their General, what could the General not do well? What hurdle could their General not overcome?None.Even their capture this time after crossing the river was because of problems in the army of the Northern Liang, not because of their General.Reminded of this, Wei Kai's mood was a bit heavy.Wu Qianfan.Wei Kai and Wu Qianfan were formerly the old Marquis's men. After the Marquis was killed in battle, the two of them followed the General and could be considered the General's right-hand men.Others were stupid, but Wu Qianfan was much smarter than him. Wu Qianfan had always performed more appropriately on the things entrusted to them.Because of this, he followed the General's side when they crossed the river this time, while the subsequent hundreds of thousands of troops were entrusted to Wu Qianfan. According to their plan, they would lead their troops to cross the river overnight and lay in ambush outside the Southern Jing city. After which, Wu Qianfan would lead the army. After the large force crossed the river, the General would command the attack.However, the Southern Jing had somehow armed in defense in advance, and trapped them south of the river. And they hadn't heard a word from Wu Qianfan, who should have led his troops to follow them.Did something go wrong?Wei Kai and Wu Qianfan were both orphans adopted by the old marquis in Yangguan. They grew up together, so he had no doubt about Wu Qianfan's character. As he fought to stay alive and led the few remaining troops around to gather information, he also spied on information from the Northern Liang all the time.Perhaps they encountered an ambush when crossing the river. Or did a turbulence occur in the river, sweeping them into some sort of situation?But there was no news at all.Wei Kai gradually got lost in thought while watching over the medicine stove until a crisp voice broke the silence in the room.\"His Highness Jingwang is here,\" a servant girl came in to report.Wei Kai was startled, and he quickly looked at Li Changning. Then he found that Li Changning had almost finished inserting the needles, and was now also looking at him.Li Changning waved his hand at him.Wei Kai hurriedly looked in the direction he indicated, and saw that the medicinal soup on the stove had started to boil.He hurriedly brought the medicinal soup from the stove.While they were busy, footsteps arriving at the door sounded. They both looked up and found Jingwang, who was gracefully wrapped in a dark cloak, walking straight into the room.Wei Kai followed Li Changning and bowed to him.But before they could kneel down, Jingwang waved his hand slightly and said, \"Get up. Get on with what you're doing. I have nothing better to do, so I just came to take a look.\"Wei Kai sneaked a peek at him.He watched as Jingwang walked to the bedside. He only took a glance at their General's legs, and then quickly withdrew his gaze. With a short glance, Wei Kai surmised that Jingwang was scared by the silver needles on their General's legs, so much so that he didn't dare to look at them directly.Wei Kai sneered inwardly.Hmph, these Southern Jing bigwigs were always like him, extremely ruthless but cowardly. They didn't even know how many people they had harmed, but in reality, they couldn't even look at a shed of blood.His kind was the most annoying paper tiger.How could he compare to our General? He's hurt and got needles stuck in his legs, but his expression remains unchanged, and he keeps his eyes closed...Um? General?Wei Kai inwardly lauded, but then his eyes accidentally fell on the General's face.The General, who had been quietly closing his eyes, opened his eyes at some point. Although his face was hidden under the curtains, Wei Kai happened to be standing in the corner and could see him through the gap in the curtains.He saw through the heavy brocade curtains that their General was actually looking at Jingwang.Wei Kai had never known that his ice-cold and arrogant black eyes could actually...surprisingly could show such a look.It was as if he had been looking forward to meeting Jingwang, but at the same time, wanted to conceal this emotion. Although he was expressionless, Wei Kai vaguely felt that he seemed a little happy. However, it was mixed with what felt like a trace of resentment, with a thousand twists and turns that made his eyes particularly deep.Wei Kai froze in place.At that moment, he heard Li Changning's voice.\"Silly boy, what has got you dazed?\"Only after receiving Li Changning's lecture did Wei Kai come back to his senses. He realized that Li Changning had walked up to him at some point and carried the pot of medicine away.Li Changning walked away with a smile and explained to Jiang Suizhou, \"This medicine is meant to nurse Madam's health. Madam stays in his room all day, so his body is more or less weak. If he doesn't take medicine, I'm afraid he can't withstand this level of acupuncture...\"Wei Kai stood in place, his gaze drifting to their General's face again.This time, the General was looking at him.Those obsidian-like eyes were cold and hard, as if the deep hundred twists and turns he saw just now were all his illusion.With just one glance, it froze Wei Kai awake.Illusion, he said to himself.It must have been an illusion.What deeper meaning could there be when their General looked at Jingwang?Even if there was, it would be a deep meaning of wanting to kill him in one shot afterwards.-----------------------------------------------------------The author has something to say.Wei Kai used the passive skill: The Eye of a Straight GuyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The injuries on Huo Wujiu's leg weren't healed, and after the needles were applied, they looked even more alarming.With just one glance, Jiang Suizhou's eyes felt like they had been burned, and he hurriedly turned his gaze away.How painful must this be, huh?He felt as if he was in Huo Wujiu's shoes. Although he only took a glance, he felt like the needles were piercing his own body.Beside him, Meng Qianshan helped him sit down on the couch beside Huo Wujiu. He then poured Jiang Suizhou a cup of hot tea and placed it in his hands.However, Jiang Suizhou didn't spare him even a glance. His eyes only fell on Li Changning at the side of the bed.He watched as Li Changning waited quietly at the bedside for a moment, until all the sand in the hourglass on his medical kit fell. Only then did he step forward and skillfully but quickly remove the needles on Huo Wujiu's legs.After he wiped all the needles clean and stored them back into his medical kit, Jiang Suizhou opened his mouth and asked, \"Is it over?\"Li Changning nodded and said, \"I just need to serve Madam with the medicine, and then everything's done.\"When Jiang Suizhou heard that, he asked, \"Hmm. What medicine?\"Li Changning smiled and said, \"They are for nourishing the body. Madam hasn't been active these days, so I'm worried that he won't be able to withstand the acupuncture. That's why I need to use some herbs to nourish his qi and blood.\"Jiang Suizhou nodded and did not ask any further.Li Changning turned around and ordered his disciple to take the medicine, but he didn't know what his disciple was thinking. His disciple remained unresponsive even after he called him twice.Li Changning hurriedly went forward, brought the medicine over, and gave it to Huo Wujiu on the bed.Huo Wujiu sat up on the bed and received the medicine bowl.Jiang Suizhou couldn't help but look at him twice more.But just like when he lived in his room, Huo Wujiu didn't lift his eyes. He ignored Jiang Suizhou as if he didn't exist.Jiang Suizhou felt rather relaxed and warmed by it, as if something that had been missing this morning had finally returned to its place.The corner of Jiang Suizhou's mouth couldn't help but curl up, and even he didn't notice it himself.Seeing that Huo Wujiu had finished drinking the medicine on his own, Li Changning's thoughts turned. He turned around and knelt down in front of Jiang Suizhou.\"Your Highness, the treatment for Madam is done for today,\" he said. \"If Your Highness has no other instructions, we'll be taking our leave first.\"Li Changning was the most clear. His bowl of oral medicine worked quickly, and it would take but one incense stick at most to take effect.This effect was naturally not only on the restoring of meridians, but also on the pain of flesh and bones.Since he started his medical practice, he had treated several cases of the same patients. When the medicine took effect, the pain was always unbearable for them. He administered only half of the dose for the first few, but each grimaced hideously and tossed all around. Some were lucky enough to have fainted from the pain.Jingwang, of course, mustn't witness this kind of scene, lest he'd be suspicious.After all, what he told Jingwang was that he was only able to relieve the pain in Huo Wujiu's limbs. If Jiang Suizhou saw that the more he healed him, the more he was increasingly pained, it would be difficult to explain to him.Therefore, he must be dismissed as soon as possible.Li Changning had made plans. As soon as Jingwang let him go, he would immediately pretend to remember something and ask Jingwang to return to his room. He would then take his pulse and issue a prescription.But then, he saw Jiang Suizhou, leaning against a throw pillow on the couch.\"Well,\" he said indifferently, \"How is the treatment today?\"Li Changning was stunned.Why didn\u2019t Jingwang play his cards according to common sense?!He carefully raised his eyes to look at Jiang Suizhou, then saw him leisurely sitting there, short of lazy and relaxed. However, his face was unfathomable, as he quietly looked at him....He didn't know if Jiang Suizhou really cared or if he was testing him.Not knowing that Jiang Suizhou just wanted to stay in the room a little longer, Li Changning didn't dare to slack off in the slightest. He deliberated his wording, and carefully but quickly reported to Jiang Suizhou.He reported in a roundabout way, but watertight and very concise. Even if Jingwang had suspicions, he couldn't possibly grasp at any clues.After finishing his report, Li Changning lowered his head and counted the seconds secretly while begging Jingwang in his heart to leave quickly.Then he saw Jingwang on the couch raise his hand.Li Changning was prepped to go. He was just waiting for this master to swing his hand, so he could slip away, and while at it, fool this master away, too...But Jiang Suizhou only picked up the cup of tea on the table and took a sip.What was more, he went on to ask more questions.From how long the medicine would take effect, to whether the acupuncture had side effects, and even what acupuncture points to pierce; he just had to ask.Li Changning murmured to himself, It's over.He answered Jiang Suizhou's questions with trepidation while counting the time.An incense stick burned very fast, and the time was almost there.Li Changning's heart jumped to his throat.However, he watched an incense burning time pass, but the bed remained peaceful. The time passed little by little, but except for the sound of the two of them talking, no other movement was heard in the room at all.Gradually, Li Changning relaxed.Sure enough, this General Huo couldn't be judged by the standards of ordinary people.Since he had the stamina, then there was no need to cover up.So, Li Changning talked to Jiang Suizhou with confidence, answering his questions glibly and replying quite freely.However, he didn't notice that Jiang Suizhou, who was sitting on the couch, was a little distracted.His eyes drifted towards the bed from time to time.Huo Wujiu indeed usually ignored him, but not as bad as today. He just laid there, as if there was no one else there but himself.Since the showdown that day, Huo Wujiu seemed to have always shown such an attitude toward him. Jiang Suizhou didn't know where he had misspoken.How about...finding an excuse to take care of him a few times?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 67Jiang Suizhou was talking to Li Changning casually, but he couldn't help thinking about Huo Wujiu on the bed.A few moments later, he made up his mind.I'm already here. What else is there to be ashamed of?With this in mind, he raised his hand, stopping Li Changning from speaking.Li Changning was describing to Jiang Suizhou what blood vessels his acupuncture method could penetrate and what effects it would have, when he was interrupted. He looked up at Jiang Suizhou.He saw Jingwang stand up and walk over to the bed.\"How are you? Do you feel better?\" He heard Jingwang ask.Li Changning couldn't tell if it was an illusion, but he felt that when Jingwang spoke to General Huo, his tone was a little milder than just now.Then he heard General Huo on the bed giving a hum. His voice was a little mute, but it sounded smooth.At this turn, Jingwang must definitely not see what kind of pain the General was enduring at this time.Sure enough, Jingwang followed with a response.Li Changning heaved a sigh of relief.But at that moment, he saw Jingwang's back stiffen.Immediately after that, he heard Jingwang's voice, like falling into an ice cellar.\"Why is his face so pale?\"\u2014\u2014It wasn't until Jiang Suizhou walked closer that he discovered how abnormally white Huo Wujiu's lips were. The latter\u2019s forehead was covered with a layer of fine sweat. Huo Wujiu's eyes were shut at the moment, and only when he walked in did he realise it as an afterthought, struggling to open his eyes to look at him, still with that expressionless look.But Jiang Suizhou could see at a glance that he was holding out despite the pain.Jiang Suizhou was so startled that he hastily dragged Li Changning over. Li Changning stepped forward trembling, checked Huo Wujiu's pulse and said, \"Your Highness, there will be some pain after the acupuncture. This is normal.\"Jiang Suizhou didn't believe a word of it.\"Normal?\" He questioned in a cold voice. \"Then why didn't you tell me just now?\"What was more, he didn't believe that this was only a 'little pain'. Huo Wujiu was a person who could endure a lot. If he was sweating from the pain, it was by no means a pain that ordinary people could withstand.Before Li Changning could reply, he stepped forward, grabbed Li Changning's lapel, and threatened in between gritted his teeth, \"If something happens to him, this Prince will kill you.\"Jingwang was weak, and his hands had little strength. But facing that pair of cold frightening eyes, Li Changning still couldn't help but shiver.Doesn't this Jingwang detest the General? Why does he look like he really will kill for the General...He shivered and said, \"Your Highness, don't be angry! It will indeed be painful when the needles are first applied to unblock the meridians, but after a period of treatment, the pain will be greatly relieved...\"But Jiang Suizhou asked again, \"How long will this last?\"Li Changning replied, \"About a month...\"Jiang Suizhou flung him away and laughed coldly: \"So you're going to torment him for a month in a row? Your acupuncture is only to relieve the pain, but now it not only can't relieve it, it even worsens it. Yet, you still dare to swindle this Prince with such words?\"Li Changning trembled, unable to speak, and scrambled to find words in his head to deal with the situation.Just then, a hoarse voice rang out from the bed.\"It doesn't matter.\"It was Huo Wujiu's voice.Jiang Suizhou raised his eyes and saw Huo Wujiu supporting himself to sit up on the bed.\"That's how I'm supposed to be treated. No need to make things difficult for him,\" Huo Wujiu added.Li Changning thought he was finished.He was worried about arousing suspicion of Jingwang. He just explained it himself moments ago, and now even the General was helping him. This was probably only adding fuel to the fire...Li Changning's legs went limp.He didn't dare to raise his eyes to look at Jingwang and only waited for him to hit the roof.Instead, he heard a slow, deep breath.\"Get lost,\" Jingwang said, \"If after one month, it doesn't match what you said, this Prince wants your head.\"Li Changning knelt down on the ground, his face full of disbelief.Er...the exposure's just like that?\u2014\u2014Li Changning took Wei Kai and fled. In a blink, the room fell into silence, leaving only Jiang Suizhou, who was standing by the bed, and Huo Wujiu, facing each other.Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and looked at him.Jingwang seemed truly enraged just now, but at this time, his cold and ferocious appearance was completely gone. He stood in front of the bed against the light, and although his expression was still cold, Huo Wujiu captured traces of helplessness in his eyes.Those eyes, one after another, glanced at his legs.For some reason, the irritation that had been pent up in Huo Wujiu's heart for a few days gradually dissipated at this point, turning into some compromise-like helplessness....No wonder I thought wrongly. Is this Jingwang confused about how to treat his collaborators and someone he admires? Obviously, he got involved with me because of his own interests. However, is it necessary to feel so genuine? It made him feel as if his anger for his supposed bullying was his care for him.After a pause, Huo Wujiu spoke indifferently, \"Do you need anything else?\"Standing at the side of the bed, Jiang Suizhou came back to his senses with an, \"Oh,\" then said, \"This Prince...I just came to see if you're okay.\"\"I'm fine,\" Huo Wujiu's reply was dry and sharp.Jingwang moved, as if subconsciously leaving obediently, but his feet stopped in the same place.After a pause, he lowered his eyes and looked arrogantly at Huo Wujiu, saying in a cold voice, \"Do you think you'll be fine if you say you're fine? That day when it rained, you also said you were fine, but what happened?\"After saying that, he didn't wait for Huo Wujiu's response, then he looked sideways at Meng Qianshan who wasn't far away.Meng Qianshan understood and hurriedly brought a chair for him and placed it by the bed.Jiang Suizhou sat down on that chair with an unrelenting look on his face.\"This Prince will watch over you,\" he said.Huo Wujiu glanced at him. \"As you wish,\" he said indifferently.Jingwang no longer spoke, but took the booklet handed to him by Meng Qianshan and sat straight where he was, reading it.Huo Wujiu's gaze faltered, and then he withdrew his eyes.There was no question that Jiang Suizhou was unlikeable and even extremely annoying, but he brought him doses of sweetness from nowhere. Huo Wujiu felt annoyed with the mere thought of Jiang Suizhou, but after seeing him, he couldn't control the corners of his mouth.It was very strange.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 68Although Jiang Suizhou looked like he was reading a book, his eyes were sneaking peeks at Huo Wujiu.He knew that Huo Wujiu was the kind of man who wouldn't say anything even if he was dying of pain, so Jiang Suizhou would probably have to wait a lifetime for Huo Wujiu to take the initiative to say he was hurt.However, Jiang Suizhou also knew that even if Huo Wujiu was in severe pain, he was helpless and could do nothing but nailbite.But he just couldn't help it. He wanted to know Wujiu's condition at all times.Jiang Suizhou saw Huo Wujiu sitting on the bed, as silent as a grave. His eyes were closed, as if he were refreshing his spirit by closing his eyes.However, his lips were white; his face was unsightly, and his eyebrows were very tight.Jiang Suizhou also felt inexplicably uncomfortable.He seemed to be particularly reluctant to see others endure pain by themselves.A moment later, Jiang Suizhou hesitated before speaking with uncertainty, \"Would you like to read a book?\"Huo Wujiu opened his eyes and looked at him.He heard Jiang Suizhou seriously say, \"It's more or less a distraction.\"He was partly sincere. He didn't like to watch TV and play video games since he was a child, and had always felt that the noise was bothersome. His family was in chaos, and there were so many messy things that he loved to hide in his study. Although they were rather obscure books read by adults, they could make him concentrate on them and unconsciously kill time.However, Huo Wujiu was sizing him up for a moment, without speaking.Huo Wujiu didn't know Jiang Suizhou's experiences and thoughts. He only knew that he would get a headache from reading since childhood, and that hadn't changed now.For him, what was even more cruel was that he was now unable to move and could only read books to pass his days, like a bandit being forced to recite scriptures.However, when he heard Jiang Suizhou's proposal, he didn't feel bothered.Somehow, not even when Jiang Suizhou looked at him; he was expressionless, but looked like a gentleman.Huo Wujiu had hated gentlemen since he was a child.However, Jiang Suizhou's appearance looked surprisingly pleasing to the eye, as if he wasn\u2019t be a high and mighty Prince, flaunting his powers, but a teacher covered in ink.If he had been a teacher...He probably wouldn't be the kind who would hold a ruler and force his students to read. The moment he took a seat and looked at people quietly, people would have an impulse to listen to him.Huo Wujiu didn't recover his senses for a while.Jiang Suizhou asked in confusion, \"Huo Wujiu?\"When Huo Wujiu returned to his senses, Jiang Suizhou said, \"Shall I ask Meng Qianshan to bring you a copy?\"Huo Wujiu paused, feeling that he had been bewitched just now.Would he read or not? He was usually forced to suffer from this kind of mental torture purely because he had nothing to do. He was numb with pain now. It was hard for him to speak, so he'd better not make himself unhappy.\"No need,\" Huo Wujiu said faintly, and then closed his eyes again.He had constantly sustained injuries, big and small. Every time the pain was unbearable, he would recite the spiritual calming mantra that his martial arts master had taught to him, and it was quite effective. He had been chanting just that. Although it didn't really alleviate anything, it could purge the disquiet in his heart and improve his endurance to some extent.Unbeknownst to him, Jiang Suizhou got the wrong idea.He only thought that Huo Wujiu's momentary daze was due to the pain in his legs. On second thought, he had to endure both severe pain and presumably all the flowers in front of him, so he had even less energy to spare on reading a book quietly.An extremely immature impulse suddenly sprouted inside Jiang Suizhou's heart.He blurted out, \"How about...how about I read to you?\"Only after saying this did he suddenly come back to his senses.What am I doing!Am I trying to read a story to the War God Huo?!Jiang Suizhou was shocked by this realization. He looked at Huo Wujiu somewhat hastily, waiting for the latter to say something in refusal so that he could take the opportunity to retract what he had just offered.But he saw Huo Wujiu reopen his eyes and look at him quietly.Huo Wujiu said nothing.Jiang Suizhou stared at him for a moment and spoke somewhat stutteringly.\"Th-Then, shall I start?\"\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou was holding a travelogue in his hand.He had read a lot of ancient official history books. On the contrary, most of these folklores were lost in later generations, and many were compiled and distorted, mixed with unofficial history. So after transmigrating, Jiang Suizhou got interested in these 'leisure books'. In addition to reading official documents and secret reports sent by his staff, he would read these books to kill time.He read to Huo Wujiu from where he had left off last time.Fortunately, he was a teacher by nature. Except for feeling squirmy at first, he gradually immersed himself in what he was reading.His voice was gentle and soothing. Perhaps it was because his tone had a great impact on his voice, so when he was reading the book, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s voice sounded seemingly clean, making the surrounding atmosphere rather serene.Meng Qianshan stood nearby with bated breath, tsking deep inside.He said to himself, My master is really good at chasing someone.Look-look, he's reading to him. What ordinary person can think of this kind of method? Who else with his identity can do this?I believe that even if Madam Huo has a heart made of iron, it would be melted by this.With this in mind, Meng Qianshan couldn't help but look at Madam Huo.However, he found that Madam Huo was just sitting on the bed with eyes closed and without saying a word. His face was still white, but his frown seemed to have disappeared...I told you so! I guess it won't be long before I can help Madam Huo to move back into His Highness's room once more!Meng Qianshan thought this way and could not help but cheer up.Just then, Madam Huo opened his eyes.A pair of thick black but transparent eyes coldly looked at him.Then, Meng Qianshan witnessed as Madam Huo faintly glanced at his master, and after seeing that he was absorbed in reading and not paying attention to his surroundings, he raised his eyes to him again.Those eyes appeared a few drops colder, and his brow was furrowed with a chill.Even someone as dull as Meng Qianshan understood Huo Wujiu's point.That master thought he was in the way and wanted him to get out.Meng Qianshan was entirely sensible. He bowed silently to this master and hurriedly slipped out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His reading was akin to talking to people, gentle and clear, completely different from usual.Huo Wujiu's breath unknowingly calmed down.He didn't expect that a leisure book, read by Jiang Suizhou, would be much more useful than the spiritual calming mantra.The content of the travelogue was actually not interesting. A literary man with nothing better to do than to run around and play, wrote some leisure books to record his insights.But Jiang Suizhou seemed to be quite interested in it. Even he himself did not notice how vivid his eyes were when he was reading.The corners of his lips were also curled up, looking quite delighted.Huo Wujiu's gaze paused for a moment. Then, he turned away and slowly closed his eyes.He hated reading books, not only because he was too lazy to read the words, but also because he was disinterested in the contents of those written, all together.But at this time, when he closed his eyes, the clear voice seemed to have become a flowing and clear river, flowing through Bashu and Huguang recorded by the literati, and sparkling under the thousands of miles of sunshine.He seemed fond of those things.For some reason, it also gave Huo Wujiu an impulse.He wanted to make those things that Jiang Suizhou liked all belong to him.He was like a secular person who had finally been canonised and had finally become a believer of God and Buddha.This gave him the urge to kneel before the statue of God, wanting to offer all the wealth and treasures that belonged to him and those that didn't belong to him, all together to God.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou stayed in the room until nightfall.He naturally had dinner with Huo Wujiu before getting up to leave.Seeing that he and Huo Wujiu were getting along quite well, Meng Qianshan stepped forward astutely and asked with a smile, \"Will Your Highness still come tomorrow?\"Jiang Suizhou stopped in his tracks and couldn't help but look at Huo Wujiu.He actually wanted to come. These days, he was pretending to be sick and resting at home, so he didn't have to go anywhere. Hence, he was very idle. Huo Wujiu had just started treating his legs this while, and according to that doctor, the pain he suffered today would persist for another month.Jiang Suizhou was a little uneasy.Perhaps because he was too afraid of death before, it made him develop the habit of putting Huo Wujiu first in everything. It made him a bit unable to change over for a while.Huo Wujiu raised his eyes and met Jiang Suizhou's gaze.\"You don't need to ask for my opinion,\" Huo Wujiu stilled for a second and said somewhat awkwardly.Meng Qianshan's face lit up with joy, and before Jiang Suizhou could speak, he smiled and exclaimed, \"Oh! Then this servant will arrange for someone to pack up and bring all the books and official documents that Your Highness wants to read to Madam Huo!\"Jiang Suizhou glanced at him.He saw Meng Qianshan smiling and saying, \"Perfect! I also think that Madam Huo's light here is better than that of the Prince's study. It's only right for His Highness to bask more in the sun!\"This kid was so enthusiastic, but it saved Jiang Suizhou a lot of trouble.He did not refute. And as a tacit acknowledgement, he hummed and got up to leave.That night, a letter was delivered to Jiang Suizhou's room.It was sent by Xu Du. The scouts he had arranged in Changle Square sent back news that the officials of the Ministry of Justice had mapped out the location and would be raiding the residence in the next two days.As early as they made this plan, they knew that because Chen Ti had invited Huo Wujiu to the flower viewing banquet last time, he had quite a face in front of the Hou Zhu. Thus, he landed a cushy job these days and was right in the middle of work in Suzhou.The only person in the house now was the woman he was keeping there. She was a woman from the brothel, so she most probably would get caught in front of the Hou Zhu in the next two days.Jiang Suizhou finished reading the letter, pondered for a moment and smiled.According to the historical records in his memory, although Chen Ti apparently flattered Pang Shao, he actually had some small selfish schemes. Pang Shao was greedy for money, and even his men couldn't escape his scavenging. Therefore, Chen Ti's house was unknown even to Pang Shao.In that case, when the Ministry of Justice closed the net, that mansion, along with the woman from the brothel, would be the first to be counted on Jiang Suizhou's head.Thereafter, the Hou Zhu would definitely investigate deeper. This case was also bound to be a huge trouble for him.By then...they only had to wait for them to use their own spear and attack their own shield.Jiang Suizhou felt that there was a good show waiting for him to see. His mood lifted, and even after putting the letter away properly, his expression remained pleasant.Meng Qianshan, who peeked at him, tsked inwardly.Normally, when the Prince was dealing with official business, had there ever been a moment where he was so carefree and even smiled at a secret letter?What could be funny when the secret letter was full of important matters?The Prince must have been distracted while reading the letter and thought of Madam Huo.With this belief, Meng Qianshan sneaked a peek at Jiang Suizhou as he withdrew from his bedroom and smirked.His smirk was rather ambiguous.The author has something to say:Jiang Suizhou: What are you smiling at?Meng Qianshan: I thought of something happy :DPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Two days prior, the Ministry of Justice suddenly discovered a clue about the whereabouts of the embezzled money. Indeed, it was a mansion purchased by an official from the palace.His Majesty gave orders at once, sending people to seize the mansion.The Ministry of Justice immediately sent personnel to set out. Because the operation was sudden, it was rather successful. Not only did they seize an astonishing amount of gold, silver and antiques from the mansion, they also found a prostitute kept there.For some reason, after His Majesty learned of this matter, he was not concerned about how much money the mansion had hidden. Instead, he was extremely interested in that woman, and immediately sent someone to investigate the master of the mansion, along with the background of this woman.But unexpectedly, the Ministry of Justice official discovered that the mansion was under the woman\u2019s name. This woman was actually redeemed by the Ministry of Rites\u2019 Chen Ti.And Chen Ti was the very first to find the clue that day and reported to the higher officials about Ji You\u2019s corruption.This result was unexpected to the palace\u2019s higher and lower positions.Somehow, the Emperor was extremely dissatisfied with the outcome, and lashed at the Ministry of Justice official. Afterward, he gave orders to severely punish Chen Ti, not merciful in the least.Buying out a woman from the brothel was not considered a crime, so Chen Ti couldn\u2019t really be convicted. However, it could be verified that this mansion, as well as the residence\u2019s gold and silver money, were all Chen Ti\u2019s possession.These years, very few officials in Southern Jing were incorrupt. The amount of this embezzlement was not considered much to them, but the Jing Dynasty\u2019s laws and decrees had written rules which stated that once an official was captured, the penalty naturally had to be dealt out according to the laws and decrees.Few days had passed before Chen Ti was convicted, and thus, the wind sighed and the crane called* on the palace\u2019s officials for a period of time.*wind sighing and crane calling (idiom) - extremely jittery and scared\u2014\u2014The peach blossoms in Pang residence bloomed just in time, buoyantly filling the garden with blossoms.A neat and quietly elegant stretch of fresh greenery could be seen in Pang Shao\u2019s courtyard.Those were Huizhou and Shexian County\u2019s green plum blossoms. Because the previous emperor was fond of it, ever since decades ago, it would be delivered to Jing\u2019s imperial harem every year.Because the water and land were different, it was difficult to transport, so every year, no more than a hundred plants would be sent to the palace. This year, even outside Hou Zhu\u2019s palace, only a few were planted. But in Pang Shao\u2019s courtyard, the whole courtyard had been planted like cloud and mist*.*cloud and mist (metaphor) - obscured/packed/fullTea was boiling on the stove in front of Pang Shao. An official was respectfully sitting on his right-hand seat. Another knelt before him, trembling all over, not daring to lift his head.It was the Ministry of Justice official who went to investigate Jiang Suizhou\u2019s residence the other day.Pang Shao lifted open the teapot and leisurely took a look inside. Among the dense steam of smoke, he slowly asked, \u201cWhat did Jingwang tell you?\u201dThe official trembled and cried, \u201cPlease investigate, Chief Minister! This humble one enquired His Highness Jingwang as instructed. His Highness Jingwang\u2019s statements are all recorded in the book, this humble one by no means has lied!Pang Shao smiled faintly.\u201cThen, what of that residence?\u201d he asked.The official said, \u201cIt\u2019s what Jingwang Manor's youngest concubine said!\u201dPang Shao\u2019s movement paused, and he covered the lid of the teapot back.\u201cHe told you?\u201d Pang Shao\u2019s expression was rather odd.The official shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not it! This official had eavesdropped\u2026That concubine was complaining with his maid, said His Highness Jingwang keeps a mistress outside, and also bought a residence in Changle Square for that mistress\u2026This official thought, this information was significant, and had to let His Majesty know, this is\u2026!\u201dHis frightened voice trembled.Pang Shao smiled lightly. \u201cWhat is Zhang-daren nervous of? I am only asking,\u201d he said.The official trembled to the point of not being able to speak.Pang Shao said with a faint smile, \u201cAlright, my tea is almost done, I also won\u2019t keep Zhang-daren here anymore. Please, go back.\u201dThe flustered official got up from the ground.He wanted to bow and express his gratitude, yet he heard Pang Shao open his mouth again. \u201cBut, Zhang-daren.\u201dThe official hurriedly answered, \u201cChief Minister?\u201dHe watched as Pang Shao picked up the teapot from the small clay stove. The flame from the stove jumped once in a while, glowing with a hot, red light.\u201cSee, if a person makes a mistake, they must pay the price.\u201d Pang Shao did not lift his eyes, pouring the tea as he spoke.\u201cThis price, if you don\u2019t take the initiative yourself, you can\u2019t blame others for doubling it.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he put down the teapot, and lifted his eyes to look at that official with a smile that was not a smile.He saw the official dumbstruck, then saw him repeatedly bowing with his hands clasped in front, saying, \u201cMany thanks, Chief Minister! Many thanks, Chief Minister!\u201dPang Shao lifted a teacup with one hand, while he waved languidly with another hand.The official retreated down.Pang Shao blew and drank the hot tea. He lightly smiled and commended, \u201cThe Dragon Well tea from Jiangnan indeed is clearer than Ye City\u2019s.\u201dSaying this, he picked up the teapot and said to the official on the side, \u201cDo you want to have a taste, too?\u201dThat official was the official responsible for searching and sorting the embezzlement of Chen Ti\u2019s residence.He dared not let Pang Shao pour him tea, so he hurriedly took the teapot with both hands, and also put out the stove on behalf of Pang Shao.\u201cChief Minister, why did you let him go just like that?\u201d the official asked.Pang Shao hmmed.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of keeping him? It wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d Pang Shao lightly smiled, his expression lukewarm and generous.But the official understood what Pang Shao meant.There were a couple of people in Pang\u2019s faction who had previously provoked Pang Shao. Pang Shao had found their vulnerable points, spared their lives, and brought them into the adherents. These people had no choice but to put double effort into slaving for Pang Shao, as well as giving more beneficial results.To Pang Shao, keeping him was more profitable than killing him.The official laughed upon hearing his response. Following Pang Shao\u2019s words, he commended, \u201cChief Minister is always generous and kind, and has great wisdom and knowledge.\u201dPang Shao only lightly smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chief Minister, we must not let Jingwang have his way, must we?\u201dBut Pang Shao shook his head and sighed, lifting his eyes to watch the abundant green plum blossoms outside the window.\u201cHis Majesty already issued an imperial edict, how could I dare to disobey?\u201dHe lightly sighed, as though having seen a dead bird that flew past, casually uttering.\u201cWhat a shame for Chen Ti, that child.\u201dThe official on the side shut his mouth immediately, losing his bravado to talk again.Today, who honored their words in the palace? Even when one closed their eyes, they would know. It wasn\u2019t His Majesty, but rather, Pang-daren.There was no imperial edict that Pang-daren could not change; Pang-daren merely did not want to change it.This official came here originally because of Chen Ti\u2019s case. He probed with a few words, and soon vaguely understood.Pang Shao had never cared about Chen Ti, and only regarded him as a dog that he could order about as he wished. These two times, Chen Ti had acted on his own, crossing him to curry favor with His Majesty, which had rubbed Pang Shao\u2019s sore spot. Such large amounts of hidden gold and silver, which Pang Shao was oblivious of, were also discovered. So even if the Emperor did not raise his hand to handle the matter, Pang-daren would also not spare his life.The official sighed in his heart.It was Chen Ti who was blinded by greed and was not sensible.Nowadays in the palace, whose life was not in the hands of Pang-daren? Doing little acts behind his back, would there be any good end?Then, this made it clear what the official ought to do.Naturally, it would be before Chen Ti\u2019s deathbed that he would be trampled on, in exchange of Pang Shao\u2019s joy. And in the process of delivering the gold, silver and antiques into the exchequer, he would think of a way to take 20-30% and send it to the residence of Pang-daren.The official inwardly planned.He then heard Pang Shao suddenly give out a light, rueful sigh.\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect, the loser dog confined in the cage is still figuring out how to bite people.\u201dThe official did not understand.Pang Shao also did not explain. He lowered his eyes and drank his tea, concealing the stern countenance in his eyes.\u201cTruly interesting.\u201d\u2014\u2014Although Jiang Suizhou was not beside Pang Shao, he was aware that Pang Shao resented him a lot.Although Chen Ti was not a high-ranked official, who in the palace didn\u2019t know that he was Pang Shao\u2019s distant relative, that he was one of Pang Shao\u2019s people? Even though Pang Shao did not place much importance in him, he himself had his own selfish calculations. But the penalized Chen Ti just had to publicly slap Pang Shao in the face.It was a blunt, cold knife that brought dishonor.However, this did not stop the joy in Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart.He had long seen Chen Ti as an eyesore. This time, since Ji You\u2019s rescue went smoothly and Chen Ti was also disposed of, to him, it was a successful kill of two birds with one stone.As for why Pang Shao resented him so much\u2026Anyway, even if Jiang Suizhou didn't do anything, Pang Shao would still not let him off. It would be better to fight with him, and not let him win.Ever since receiving the news, Jiang Suizhou was filled with exuberance. He sat down in front of Huo Wujiu\u2019s bed, and immediately felt Huo Wujiu\u2019s eyes on him.\u201cHow are you today?\u201d Jiang Suizhou asked.Huo Wujiu\u2019s complexion was still ghastly, but his expression was composed. His hands were extremely pale*, but he still had miniscule energy left to glance at Jiang Suizhou several times.*the literal translation from Chinese is \u201cthe veins on the back of his hands were vivid\u201d, but it\u2019s to show that he\u2019s pale and unwell, so I translated it to \u201chis hands were extremely pale\u201dJiang Suizhou noticed his scrutinizing, and his twinkling eyes stared at Huo Wujiu, waiting expectantly for him to open his mouth and ask.After all, looking at this whole world now, there were few people who could talk with him, and there were fewer people whom he could share his joy with.Huo Wujiu, however, counted as one of them.But he saw Huo Wujiu pause, withdraw his gaze and indifferently say, \u201cDoing good.\u201dIndeed, he did not say anything else.Jiang Suizhou felt his breath stuck in his throat, not going up or down. It was truly awkward.For a moment, he only stared blankly.Why didn\u2019t he ask! Huo Wujiu, why didn\u2019t he ask!Though unaware, Huo Wujiu, who squinted a glance at him, silently clamped his lips in agony at the bottom of his heart.This Jingwang was already dying with \u201cI have something to tell you\u201d etched on his face, and was only waiting for him to ask, but instead, he chose to tease him.Huo Wujiu\u2019s expression was indifferent, as though not at all realizing Jiang Suizhou\u2019s abnormality.Then, he saw Jiang Suizhou taking the book Meng Qianshan brought. But over and over, he kept biting his tongue, so he neither looked nor flipped the book.Those glossy black eyes repeatedly shot a glance at Huo Wujiu several times.Teasing him actually made him soft.Huo Wujiu paused, and finally asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dSure enough, those eyes brightened at once.Huo Wujiu only felt that those legs that were hurting so much that it made him want to kill someone, had gotten far away from him.He saw Jingwang looking solemn and unyieldingly putting on an indifference. But that ostentatious expression couldn\u2019t be concealed, quite like a cutesy cat.\u201cThis Prince saved Ji You,\u201d he said.Huo Wujiu nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201dThen, he heard Jiang Suizhou followed with, \u201cChen Ti was beheaded.\u201dHuo Wujiu hmmed and pondered for a moment, connecting these two matters together. \u201cScapegoat?\u201dJiang Suizhou nodded.He merely settled his gaze at Huo Wujiu. This look was the same as waiting to be praised. Huo Wujiu paused, and could not bear but to compliment, \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant scheme.\u201dBut he heard Jiang Suizhou repeat, \u201cIt\u2019s Chen Ti.\u201dHuo Wujiu was quite puzzled for a while. \u201cWhat about him?\u201dHe saw Jingwang staring at him, his satisfied expression natural. He blurted out, \u201cChen Ti, did you forget? The one who gave you the flower banquet invitation, who wanted to humiliate you, that one.\u201dWith this said, Jiang Suizhou smiled faintly. \u201cThis Prince brought disaster on his head.\u201dHuo Wujiu was dazed for a time.He just realized; this Jingwang was this happy to tell him about this matter, not because he had saved the life of the Minister of Rites, but instead because\u2026Jiang Suizhou wanted to tell Huo Wujiu, he had taken revenge for him.The author has something to say:Huo Wujiu: Thanks for inviting me. Although I know he doesn\u2019t like me, my heartbeat still starts going insane.Wei Kai: He doesn\u2019t love you.Huo Wujiu: I know, hehe.Wei Kai: ?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon after, several members related to Chen Ti in the Ministry of Rites were convicted. Although the charges were not as serious as Chen Ti's, they were more or less demoted.But Jiang Suizhou did not expect for Ji You to also be among those ranks.This case originally stopped at this point, and in no way was it related to him, but after two days of him being released from prison, he was demoted under the jurisdiction of lax charges, and was transferred to Huizhou.Huizhou wasn't very far, nor was it as remote as Lingnan, but at Ji You's age, being demoted to outside the capital was equivalent to ending his career as an official.Ji You didn't have a criminal charge, yet Pang Shao still tried every means to make things difficult for him, thus thinking of this idea. When he thought about it, Jiang Suizhou knew Pang Shao was using Ji You to fight with himself, to give him a warning.Pang Shao was telling him, while under Pang Shao's leadership, even if the rescue of someone was successful, it wouldn't come to a good end.Jiang Suizhou felt his breath stuck in his chest.For two consecutive days, he didn't look for Huo Wujiu. In his study, he found some of the original owner's hidden rare books, along with some silver notes for travel, and had Meng Qianshan deliver them to Ji You's residence.Meng Qianshan soon returned.Ji You accepted those books, but returned the silver notes.Meng Qianshan gave the silver notes back to Jiang Suizhou, saying, \"Your Highness, Ji-daren said his traveling expenses are sufficient, so you have no need to spend.\"With this said, he fished out a thin letter from his arms and handed it to Jiang Suizhou. \"Ji-daren also wrote a few words, and asked this humble slave to pass it on to Your Highness.\"Jiang Suizhou opened the letter and saw eloquent, unrestrained writing on the paper.\"Thank you for your Highness' rescue, and I ask Your Highness not to blame yourself.\"Huizhou has lovely scenery, the plum blossoms are especially lavish, I have yearned to see it for a long time. If you think about it, if I leave a bit earlier, I can catch up before I wizen, and see Huizhou's green plums for myself. Wouldn't it be wonderful?\"Jiang Suizhou read until this point, and the corner of his mouth relaxed, before finally forming a very shallow curve.In life, each one has their own preferences and pursuits. But Pang Shao imposed his preferences on others, thinking that career and wealth were the things everyone liked, which made him think that ruining Ji You's future prospects was the most appropriate punishment.But he didn't know, his so-called punishment was nothing to Ji You. To Jiang Suizhou, this was luck in misfortune.But\u2026Jiang Suizhou studied the letter for a moment, and put it away like it was a precious thing.Although this demotion only tickled Ji You, and instead gave him the chance to enjoy the scenery to his heart's content, Pang Shao's animosity would never be forgotten by Jiang Suizhou.He also must make it clear to Pang Shao.But today, Pang Shao hoodwinked the court, and most of all, the Ministry of Personnel that was in charge of transferring and promoting officials, was practically grasped in Pang Shao's hands.Even if he wanted to oppose Pang Shao, the fact was, it would be extremely difficult.\u2014\u2014For two consecutive days, Huo Wujiu did not see Jiang Suizhou at all.Every day, after taking his medicine, he could only wait in the room. Sometimes, he could see people going in and out of the courtyard from the window, but he couldn't go out.He only felt, after taking the medicine these two days, the pain in his legs was a bit severe, so much so that his mood was poor. No matter how many times he thought of solutions to forget the pain, it did not work.To him, these two days felt a little longer than usual.Until the third day.Just like the previous days, Li Changning gave him acupuncture and moxibustion. When he reached half of the pincushion, he suddenly heard Huo Wujiu ask, \"Did the medicine change these two days?\"Li Changning was stunned. \"It didn't!\"He raised his eyes to look at Huo Wujiu, and saw Huo Wujiu sitting there with a frown. Hearing his answer, Huo Wujiu raised his hand to rub the space between his brows and hmmed.Li Changning hurriedly asked, \"General, these two days, did you feel especially different?\"Huo Wujiu paused. \"No, just asking.\"Li Changning gave a response, and continued pricking his needle.Wei Kai turned his head to see Huo Wujiu with this expression, and knew something was wrong. He hurriedly moved to the bed and asked Huo Wujiu, \"General, what happened?\"Huo Wujiu was silent for a moment. \"These two days, what's unusual happening in Jingwang Manor?\"Wei Kai pondered. \"This subordinate has not heard any rumors, but this morning, when this subordinate followed Doctor Li to come here, that eunuch who's always beside Jingwang told this subordinate to be a little careful.\"Huo Wujiu paused, and lifted his eyes to look at him. \"What did he say?\"Wei Kai was dazed for a while. He felt that when the General heard this, he would speak a little faster.He hastily said, \"He didn't say anything, he just said Jingwang is not very happy these two days, and asked this subordinate to not invite bad luck.\"Huo Wujiu withdrew his gaze.So something did happen.He didn't ask again. The two men also gave a meaningful glance and went to do their work. Only until both finished adding the needles, giving him all the medicine, and withdrawing, did Huo Wujiu lift his eyes to look outside the window, the space between his brows furrowed very tightly.He was perfectly fine two days ago, what happened that made him so upset?Huo Wujiu's heart was in turmoil, and he came up with a guess.Could something have happened in the court? But these two days he didn't see Jingwang go out, let alone see anyone from the palace visiting Jingwang Manor.Huo Wujiu's brows didn't loosen the whole day.Luckily, when nightfall came, Jiang Suizhou showed up.By now, Huo Wujiu had had his dinner and was sitting on the bed, randomly flipping a book distractedly. Jiang Suizhou sat down beside his bed and asked, \u201cAre you well these two days?\u201dHuo Wujiu put down the book. He didn\u2019t answer his question, and instead said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dJiang Suizhou couldn\u2019t help but freeze for a moment.He didn\u2019t expect this matter would reach Huo Wujiu\u2019s ears, and also didn\u2019t expect he would ask so naturally and as a matter of course.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because he was those people\u2019s \u201cmaster\u201d, they didn\u2019t dare provoke him, much less to be so bold as to ask what they shouldn\u2019t ask.He naturally was in no position to bring it up to people, and pouring his heart out was out of the question.Although he usually wasn\u2019t a sensitive person, such sentiments were always kept in his heart. There was not a person whom he could talk with, so he felt suppressed.But he didn\u2019t expect Huo Wujiu would ask, nor did he think that he could speak about this matter with Huo Wujiu.He paused, before slowly explaining, \u201cMinistry of Rites\u2019 Ji-daren has been demoted. In a few days\u2019 time, he\u2019ll be sent to Huizhou.\u201dHuo Wujiu frowned. He asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it have nothing to do with him?\u201dJiang Suizhou said, \u201cHe was convicted of lax charges. After Chen Ti was arrested, this matter was entirely handed over to the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Personnel. This Prince is unable to intervene.\u201dHuo Wujiu was silent for a moment and said with assertiveness, \u201cThat\u2019s an order by someone below Pang Shao.\u201dJiang Suizhou smiled, and slowly breathed out, \u201cIt\u2019s Pang Shao. He has suffered from this Prince\u2019s loss, so he wants to give trouble to this Prince. Ji-daren is only a troubled fish in a pond*.\u201d*\u6b83\u53ca\u7684\u6c60\u9c7c - taken from a literature: there's a fish pond under a city gate. One day, the gate is on fire, so the people use the water from the pond to extinguish it. In the end, all of the fish in the pond die as their water is drained. This is to say, Ji You is only an innocent bystander.Huo Wujiu said, \u201cSince he joined the palace as an official, he has to be prepared for such risks. But it\u2019s only a demotion, the place he\u2019s going to is also not remote, and far away from the court. To him, it might be a good thing.\u201dBut Jiang Suizhou shook his head.\u201cOthers can think like this, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn any case, his disaster is all because of me, I can\u2019t just stay idle.\u201d After a pause, he softly sighed.\u201cThat\u2019s Pang Shao for you.\u201dHuo Wujiu didn\u2019t speak for a while.Jiang Suizhou also knew he was confined in the residence every day and couldn\u2019t even walk. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t do anything. He wasn\u2019t hoping for Huo Wujiu to say anything. After he spilled it out, Jiang Suizhou\u2019s heart felt a little more at ease. He picked up the book Meng Qianshan had placed next to him and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t come for two days, and quite forgot where I stopped reading.\u201dTo change the subject, he proceeded to read the book for Huo Wujiu to listen to.Huo Wujiu silently looked at him as he put forth a look as if nothing had happened, lowering his head as he flipped the book. His chest felt very stuffy.\u2026It wasn\u2019t something he should bear, but because he was born in the emperor\u2019s house, the pressure fell on his shoulders.If he really was a cold-blooded, heartless bastard, then it would be fine. Only, he was an extremely tender-hearted person. Whether it was his business or not, he had to take all the responsibility on himself. In the end, even if he couldn\u2019t stand it, he had to hold out.He saw Jiang Suizhou flip to the page he stopped at last time and gently, quietly read aloud.But before he could read two sentences, his voice abruptly ceased.Jiang Suizhou raised his head in surprise, to see Huo Wujiu somehow came and snatched the book from his hands.\u201cLet me,\u201d Huo Wujiu said.Jiang Suizhou revealed an astonished face.He watched Huo Wujiu moving the lamp a little closer. Although his expression was indifferent and alienated, there was an inexplicably little awkwardness.He clearly didn\u2019t lift his eyes, much less look at him, but it was as though he was clumsily comforting him.Jiang Suizhou was rendered speechless for a while, and only felt that his chest was rather hot. It was like the dreary feeling that silted up inside him, was slowly being burned away.He fixed his gaze on Huo Wujiu, and didn\u2019t speak for a while.He watched Huo Wujiu lower his eyes, flipping open the book in his hands.His indifferent look suddenly went rigid on his face.After that, his eyebrows gradually scrunched up, and lifted his eyes to look at Jiang Suizhou.\u201c...The book you read a few days ago, it was this one?\u201d he asked.Jiang Suizhou stared blankly for a moment. \u201cYes?\u201dHuo Wujiu\u2019s gaze gingerly settled on the book.It was different from the simple vernacular prose Jiang Suizhou read out these few days. This book\u2019s content was difficult to understand, it was all rare words placed before Huo Wujiu, just like hieroglyphics. It only took two glances to make his brain ache.Jiang Suizhou moved closer to take a look, and realized what happened at once.This book was indeed written in extremely obscure classical Chinese. After all, the one who wrote the book was the previous dynasty\u2019s renowned erudite scholar. All of the wordings and phrasings needed careful study. The spoken and written language of the ancients were, after all, completely different. These sentences couldn\u2019t be read out, and naturally had to be translated first before it was able to be read.Because Jiang Suizhou originally had this job, he could translate with high proficiency with absolutely no effort.\"It's the same book, but what's written in the book is not easy to read, so I adjusted it a little,\" he said.Huo Wujiu was speechless.Jiang Suizhou looked at Huo Wujiu in bewilderment.Although he went to war, he was still a person from the ancients, so he should be able to understand it, right?But...why did he have this expression on his face?Before Jiang Suizhou could make sense of it, Huo Wujiu suddenly closed the book in his hands and lazily put it to one side. He lightly said, \"Change to another book, I feel very bored of this one from two days ago, it's not interesting.\"Jiang Suizhou was even more skeptical.\u2026No way, when I read it to you two days ago, you looked like you were listening enthusiastically though?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/After the Disabled God of War Became My ConcubineCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Disabled God of War Became My Concubine Chapter 74Luckily, Jiang Suizhou was also not very fond of that book. Since Huo Wujiu didn\u2019t want to read it, he didn\u2019t press on the matter.The second day, Li Changning felt like Huo Wujiu looked a little better than two days ago.His complexion was still pale, but it wasn\u2019t as obvious as two days ago. Seeing him coming into the room, he lightly nodded at him.Li Changning only thought it was because of the medical treatment process; it was normal for a patient\u2019s condition to inevitably fluctuate.He smiled as he said, \u201cGeneral Ye looks great today, did the treatment two days ago have some effect?\u201dHuo Wujiu didn\u2019t feel any particular effects, but still gave a flattering light nod.Li Changning was delighted.When the treatment was done for today, Li Changning cleared away the medical kit, but as he was prepared to leave, Huo Wujiu raised his hand, calling Wei Kai to come.\u201cGeneral?\u201d Wei Kai hurriedly went to him.He then heard Huo Wujiu say, \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to do.\u201dWei Kai revealed a surprised expression. \u201cGeneral, please speak!\u201dHe knew he and the General were in the enemy camp now, so even if they had a plan, they had to quietly wait for an opportunity. At this moment, besides having done his best to find a way to cure the General\u2019s legs, he couldn\u2019t do anything else.But he never had the chance to lay down his life for the General yet, causing him to be extremely eager.Hearing Huo Wujiu say this, Wei Kai\u2019s eyes gleamed with light.Then, he heard Huo Wujiu say, \u201cOur men in the city are currently idle, right?\u201dWei Kai vigorously nodded.\u201cWithout General\u2019s order, no one dares to act rashly. This subordinate has arranged for them to hide in the inner city of Lin\u2019an. If General has any instructions, this subordinate will immediately get in touch with them.\u201dHuo Wujiu gave a sound of understanding.\u201cThen, these few days, think of a way to give Pang Shao some trouble.\u201dWei Kai was dazed for a moment.This\u2026it\u2019s fine if General doesn\u2019t give orders, but once he does, is it this exciting?Wei Kai stared blankly at Huo Wujiu, and for a moment he forgot to respond.He then saw Huo Wujiu lift his eyes, glancing nonchalantly at him.\u201cNot asking you to assassinate him.\u201d Huo Wujiu\u2019s face betrayed a subtle look of dislike.Wei Kai blinked, then stammered, \u201cThen\u2026what does General mean by finding trouble\u2026what kind of trouble?\u201dHuo Wujiu shifted his gaze and nonchalantly ordered.\u201cHe has many errands for Jiang Shunheng, right? Make him screw up one or two times. If it\u2019s significant, stir up trouble in front of Jiang Shunheng.\u201dWei Kai fixedly stared while nodding.Huo Wujiu lightly said, \u201cGo.\u201dWei Kai then retreated out with Li Changning.Huo Wujiu quietly looked outside.The things he could do right now were still small, but at least he wasn\u2019t staying idle. Since Pang Shao wanted to give trouble to Jiang Suizhou, then he could also think of some ways to give Pang Shao trouble.Although the battlefield was big, there were some imperceptible light breezes which could decide the whole battle.He just needed to control where the breezes blew.Huo Wujiu impassively withdrew his gaze. He picked up a book next to the bed, and furrowed his brows as he studied it in genuine scrutinization.It was precisely the unfathomable book which he had thrown aside and labeled as \u201cboring\u201d yesterday.\u2014\u2014Lin\u2019an rained a lot. It had not been sunny for long before it rained again for several consecutive days.It wasn\u2019t strange for Lin\u2019an to rain, but this time, the rain forced everyone on tenterhooks and feeling queasy.Because this rain had toppled the ancestral temple in the northern side of the imperial palace.The construction of that ancestral temple had just started two months ago: it wasn\u2019t finished yet. The rain came ferociously, destroying the imperial palace built in the recent two months into bits and pieces, practically into a pile of ruins.This was truly a big taboo, an absolutely terrifying omen!The tributes in the ancestral temple were all for the past emperors of Great Jing. It was the foundation of the imperial court, and was a place more important than the palace itself. Because Great Jing moved to the south, the Emperor harbored great aspirations, specially constructing the ancestral temple to face the north with its back to the south. This was to let the great ancestors oversee what was gained and lost, pointing to Ye City.In the end, Ye City still had not recovered. Yet, this ancestral temple collapsed.For a while, the rumors among the people caused a tremendous clamor until it couldn\u2019t be suppressed. Everyone said, Great Jing might perish. Even the children all around the city had composed a nursery rhyme about the perishment of Jing and the rising of Liang.The Hou Zhu flew into a rage, and the court was in a chaotic mess.Jingwang Manor, on the other hand, remained tranquil unlike the outside.After the acupuncture session today, Huo Wujiu\u2019s legs could already move slightly.The range of movement was very small, almost negligible, but because the wound had not healed, it was less easy to move. To him, however, it proved the effects of Li Changning\u2019s medication. For a while, the few people in the room held their breaths with rapt attention, jubilant.Only Huo Wujiu on the bed had an indifferent expression.He tried to move his legs as he said with an impassive voice, \u201cThat ancestral temple incident, you did it?\u201dWei Kai mischievously laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Didn\u2019t General say to stir up trouble for Pang Shao until it reaches the dog* emperor? Our men in the city had discreetly probed for information, and found that the construction of the ancestral temple is Pang Shao\u2019s biggest project! This subordinate was a bit unsure at first, but the leader in charge of those men is clever, and guaranteed that it will succeed!\u201d*expression of cursing, like damnedHuo Wujiu raised his eyes to look at him, the corners of his eyebrows and eyes forming a smiling expression. He commended, \u201cYou\u2019ve got guts.\u201dWei Kai knew his General normally looked down on the masses, it was rare to see him smiling. With such an expression, it meant he was extremely pleased with their work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The constructed walls are all hollow, the material is also poor. Our men were only mixed in the workforce, and with just a small trick, the palace collapsed from the rain!\u201dLi Changning heard this, and on the side, he smiled as he chipped in, \u201cThat Pang-daren must have lived in the north for a perennial time, he had no idea that the rain in Jiangnan is very heavy, so he dared to be in deficit with the construction. With him constructing like this, even if you don\u2019t act, that ancestral temple will surely not stand for many years.\u201dSaying this, he and Wei Kai laughed.Huo Wujiu followed with a nod, and then raised his hand, interrupting Wei Kai\u2019s laughter.\u201cThe work is done, but don\u2019t lower your guard,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them pay attention to Pang Manor\u2019s activities. Pang Shao has suffered losses, he\u2019ll definitely retaliate.\u201dWei Kai said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, General, this subordinate has made arrangements!\u201dHuo Wujiu gave a sound of assent, and lifted his eyes to look outside the window.In the main house of Anyin Hall, people went in and out, all in an orderly manner.\u2014\u2014Jiang Suizhou also immediately received an intel.He didn\u2019t expect that such a big change would occur in history. In the historical records, although Southern Jing\u2019s court was corrupted, the ancestral temple collapsing as a result of corruption had never occurred.However, to Jiang Suizhou, this was a very good thing.Although Pang Shao was normally unruly, he wouldn\u2019t bring corruption in the presence of the Hou Zhu. He had made a commotion for the Hou Zhu, and hustled money behind the Hou Zhu\u2019s back. Even if he hustled more, he wouldn\u2019t let the Hou Zhu know.But this time, this embezzlement of his was discovered by the Hou Zhu. In addition, it was because he had razed down the ancestral temple where the Hou Zhu placed the ancestors\u2019 memorial tablets.As this matter was serious, although Pang Shao didn\u2019t build the ancestral temple, it was entirely under his supervision. As soon as the temple collapsed, the Hou Zhu immediately wanted to send people to investigate, but the ruins were piled up there. Even if Pang Shao was very cunning, he couldn\u2019t confuse black and white* and shirk from responsibility.*confuse right and wrongSince the Hou Zhu ascended the throne, this was the first time Pang Shao threw a curve in front of him.Hou Zhu was enraged with Pang Shao for a long period of time, so much so that several adherents of Pang Shao were deposed and prosecuted. Most importantly, the Hou Zhu originally had complete trust in Pang Shao; small and big matters of the palace were all handed over to him with confidence. Now, cracks appeared in this trust.This was the most satisfying thing for Jiang Suizhou.He read the information several times, over and over again, only to think that Heaven\u2019s eyes had opened, having dropped such a heavy rain.However\u2026Before putting away the information, his gaze settled among the most unnoticeable section of words.Among Pang Shao\u2019s adherents who were discharged, there were several officials from the Ministry of Personnel. People were dismissed, so the positions had emptied.Usually, the Hou Zhu let Pang Shao arrange the transfer of officials. But now, Pang Shao was the one who committed a crime, so the Hou Zhu was clueless.Hence, he settled with Qi Min\u2019s petition, and promoted several non-Pang party officials to the vacant seats. Some of them were young, novices who had just taken the imperial examination a few years ago.Jiang Suizhou frowned.He naturally knew Qi Min held absolutely no selfish intentions, this was entirely for the sake of the Jing Dynasty. But because of this person\u2019s seniority and bad temper, he was rather straightforward in speaking and doing things.He had always been aggressively against Pang Shao, but because of Pang Shao\u2019s big influence, he had never achieved much. But since the beginning of Chen Ti\u2019s conviction, Pang\u2019s faction had suffered from several attacks in a row. In this stand, Qi Min got the upper hand.Jiang Suizhou smoothened the edge of the paper.He knew, to Qi Min, all of the defeats before were smoke bombs. Pang Shao knew he was all talk but no action, so he didn\u2019t regard him as anything special.But now, Qi Min had encroached on Pang Shao\u2019s interest, becoming the person who seized the opportunity to hit him when he was down.So, even if Qi Min is a venerable minister to three emperors, Pang Shao can also stir his heart.In the historical records, Qi Min died unnaturally.Before the Jing Dynasty was wiped out, his letters colluding with Northern Liang were found in his residence, so he was sentenced to death together with all his relatives. Until the later generations, historians had disputes over whether Qi Min really joined hands with Liang.If it was true, it would be one thing, but if it was false\u2026Then this incident would most likely happen in advance because the butterfly flapped its wings.\u2014\u2014When Jiang Suizhou entered Huo Wujiu\u2019s room at dusk today, Huo Wujiu was reading a book on his bed.He looked as though he no longer needed Jiang Suizhou to accompany him every day, but both of them seemed to have reached an intriguing agreement, no one brought up this matter.Instead, it was rather natural to spend some time together every day.Seeing Jiang Suizhou sitting beside the bed, Huo Wujiu lifted his eyes to look at him. He asked, \u201cSomething good happened?\u201dJiang Suizhou wore a joyful expression. He faintly smiled as he said, \u201cYes, actually.\u201dWith this said, he picked up the book next to the bed. He flipped as he said, \u201cHave you heard? The heavy rain these two days razed down the ancestral temple in the northern side of the imperial palace.\u201dSaying this, he raised his brows, looking at Huo Wujiu.His joyful look was so obvious that Huo Wujiu couldn\u2019t resist reminding him, \u201cIt\u2019s also your family\u2019s ancestral temple. The offerings inside are also your ancestors.\u201dJiang Suizhou paid no heed.\u201cWasn\u2019t it only halfway built? The memorial tablets hadn\u2019t been moved in yet, right?\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, it was messed up by Pang Shao. If the great ancestors want to blame someone, they can\u2019t blame me for schadenfreude.\u201dHuo Wujiu paused after hearing what he said.It was not really Pang Shao\u2019s bunglement. In essence, this incident was his doing.However, Huo Wujiu even had wantonly beaten the country of the Jiang family; it was but an icing on the cake to bear another revenge in mind about destroying someone\u2019s ancestral temple.At this particular moment, he heard Jiang Suizhou open his mouth with hints of a smile.\u201cIf it\u2019s like this, you\u2019re someone who\u2019s married to this Prince\u2019s residence, and is also recorded in this Prince\u2019s genealogy. This revenge of destroying the ancestral temple, this Prince has recorded it on Pang Shao\u2019s head for you.\u201dThe author has something to say:Jiang Suizhou: Since you\u2019re married to our Jiang family, our Jiang family\u2019s ancestors are also yours.Huo Wujiu: That\u2019s your maternal family, doesn\u2019t count.Jiang Suizhou: ?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
